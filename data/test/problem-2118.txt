“Look, Potter, do you remember Draco’s funeral?”
You collapse on the floor, and you pretend its cool embrace can protect you from the void inside your chest.
(You can’t. You can’t. You can’t.)
You drop the last remnants of your shield, and you grasp that chance with both hands. You feel it pulsate, warm and gold, against your skin.
Your hand hovers aimlessly before falling limply back to your side.
“I don’t know if that says anything about me, though. I guess… I guess we’re both a bit broken. But… do you think we can build something from this if we’re willing to work on it?”
The voice is deep and male. The question startles me. I turn around. Behind the counter, the wizard repeats:
The very first spring after the war, they asked Harry to speak at the very first war memorial.
Predictably,
, Harry told himself at first,
He’s good at cutting straight to the core of things. At finding the right words and asking the difficult questions. I answer him in the quiet of my living room late that night.
He stormed out instead, slamming the door behind him. He made it all the way to his flat before panic took him apart. As he lay on the rug, with tears in his eyes and trying to remember how to breathe, he vowed never to have another anxiety attack in front of Draco.
Pictures. Shit. You try to think when they could have caught you with Draco. You remember you knocked on his door in the middle of the night, dishevelled and frantic. Of course, you know what it looked like. It looked like exactly what it was.
And then, she’s out of the door, the sound of her heels the only reminder she’d ever been here. I collapse into my chair and don’t move for the rest of the day.
After that, we seem to settle into a comfortable routine. We take turns asking each other questions. One a day has become our unspoken rule. We write it early in the morning, and we usually wait until evening to discuss it. It feels nice. Familiar. Some nights, when I undress, I stare at myself in the mirror and contemplate his handwriting crawling on my skin with a warm feeling behind my ribs.
Draco’s babbling against the skin of your back, he’s biting your shoulder and working your trousers open. You’ve never felt so good in your entire life.
But then: Draco wakes up and everything is a disaster again.
And you know you should get up from that bed. You know you should put your clothes on, and walk out of that door, and forget about this whole disaster of a night.
Let us think, dear reader, about what it means for these two men to cross paths at that instant in time. One is desperately in love and spends a solid hour or five every day staring through the window at the object of his affection. The other is also desperately in love, albeit in a very different way. The other doesn’t feel like he’s worthy of affection or attention at all, so love turns his heart into a painful pincushion, turns his skin into Armenian paper and his bones into chalk.
sits in the middle of your chest like a stone.)
Draco’s almost done packing when Harry barges into his room, and the sight of the suitcase punches the air straight out of Harry’s lungs. Draco steadfastly doesn’t look at him; he folds another shirt instead.
(Also left thigh: Traced words. Illegible.)
The quote goes on for a boring quarter of a boring page and this is the point where I can’t take it anymore.
, although some scholars, such as Plutocrasius Merriweather, have theorised that it can be traced back as far as Antiquity. Little is known of the use of the spell until the late 13th century; in the 14th century, however, it seems to have gained in popularity, and by the middle of the 15th century, its use is attested, both in literature and in magical theory, as a mean for young people of all social strata to ensure they are entering a successful marriage.
“No, it’s fine, don’t mention it.”
“I guess I haven’t been that reliable, have I?” you say, hands falling away from Draco’s face and down to his shoulders, his arms. You can’t bear to stop touching him, so you let your hands take his instead of falling limply by your sides. “Maybe you were right before, maybe I am too broken, but—”
“Draco. Draco, listen,” he says softly, the words unhurried and unstoppable like water gushing from an alpine spring, like the endless motion of the waves, “I know you said we couldn’t work out, and I know I said I’d respect that, and—I’m sorry, Draco. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you how much I wanted you to stay. Let me do it now, Draco. Let me fight for you.”
I pause for a while. I can’t think of anything to ask him that won’t give his identity away, but I don’t want to waste a precious question either. Then, I ask:
“It’s nice to meet you,” Harry says after a while. “I mean, it’s not nice in the sense that I wouldn’t be meeting you like this if you hadn’t—you know—died, and I’m not saying I’m happy that you’re dead but I… Oh, I’m making a mess out of this, aren’t I?”
It wasn’t until he came to Switzerland that he finally found a place that cast a hook in his heart. It wasn’t until he saw the
“No, no.” Draco grabs Harry’s wrists in his hands, and the contact of his skin strikes Harry like lightning. “Don’t. Don’t say that. You’ve always done that, you’ve always made your pain invisible, negligible. You’ve always forgiven and understood. I hurt you, Harry. I really did. I can see it now, and I could see it then, but I didn’t know how to do anything else. I thought it meant I was too broken for love, at the time. Still do, if I’m honest, but I regret hurting you. You deserved someone better than me, Harry. You deserved someone who could love you in all the right ways, who could tell you with all the right words exactly what you meant to them.”
I’d hold you tight against me. I’d feel your body, your entire body against me. Your flesh pressed against my flesh. It’d feel good, just knowing you’re there, in my arms. Then, I’d start moving against you.
There’s something fierce burning behind Iris’ eyes: it ignites something deep inside Harry’s chest. (Something that has been dormant for a very long time, something like hope or desire or the will to fight.)
“It’s the least I could do,” Draco replies with a sad sort of smile at the corner of his lips, “after everything that happened.”
“Yes.” Harry’s voice is sob-strangled and bark-rough. He knows he’ll regret it as soon as the word spills from his lips, but he’s too far gone to fight. “Yes,” he whispers again against Draco’s collarbone, delirious with want and love and grief.
“What of it?”
“I can’t believe you came for me,” Draco continues, “you complete madman. Oh, you reckless idiot. Oh, you came for me. You came for me. Oh, I love you, I love you, I love you.” (Harry lets the words drip all over his skin, warm and sweet like honey.)
You don’t recognise your life anymore. Inside your chest, winter has turned into spring. The frozen grounds of your ribs have thawed and there are all sorts of things growing on your lungs now.
That night, when I stare at myself naked in the mirror, I imagine the words covering my skin are bitemarks and nail scratches. I imagine they’re remnants of him, touching me.
The second time the exploding extension explodes, it is not an accident.
(You can’t. You can’t. You can’t.)
“—I love you,” Harry finishes in a whisper.
Do you believe in soulmates, Harry? Do you believe that someone out there will fulfil your every need, wish and desire? Do you believe there is someone out there who was meant for you? Many young people discard that idea as romantic nonsense nowadays, but there was a time when people believed in it. There was a time when people knew how to find their soulmates and there was a time where a certain spell was commonly used, among young people of marrying age, to ensure that they would be happily wedded and that their marriage would last.
When Harry makes it back to the
“And then, we’ve got to figure out how to teach the fuckers some basic human decency,” Ron concludes and sets the parchment and quill down.
Then, of course, at two in the morning, I write back. I can’t sleep. Every stupid thing always seems so much smarter when you can’t sleep. Every stupid thing always makes so much more sense in the dead of night than in the light of morning. I take out my journal and open it.
“We don’t have to live here, not if you don’t want to.” (And it breaks Harry’s heart, the thought he could leave this place, but he’s desperate and he’s falling apart, so the words tumble from his mouth all the same.) “I’d leave this behind for you. We could go anywhere you wanted. I’d follow you. I’d never complain, not as long as I could hold your hand and kiss your hair. We could go live at the Manor. We could never go back to England again. We could start anew anywhere, Draco, anywhere you wanted. I would be good, Draco. Oh, I would be quiet and soft and I would never hurt you again. You wouldn’t even notice I’m there, I promise, Draco. I promise. Just don’t leave me behind. Oh, please, don’t leave me behind. “
I try not to think of how distraught Pansy was yesterday because I can’t entirely bring myself to believe this man, however disagreeable I may find him, is the type to be running an illicit potion trade, which means I have no lead on her case.
Wait.
I love you. And I won’t stop telling you until you come back and kiss me. I won’t stop until you’ve told me that you don’t want me, and exactly why you suddenly don’t want me. Because I still want you, Draco. I still love you.
They’re still kissing when Jemima approaches them with requests for eyewitness accounts and signatures. She stops in front of them.
Hermione lets go of me to wrap an arm around him and pull him in the hug. I hold them both tight as Hermione’s breathing gradually grows calmer again, more regular.
“I love you too,” he whispers.
Nott runs a full battery of tests. Then, he runs some more.
Around them: smooth flat stone, and small patches of sea-grass, and the endless crashing of wave after wave after wave. (In the lighthouse, the lantern burns in dotted lines across the minutes.)
“I want this building to look the exact way it did when it was first built,” Harry tells them. And: “I want it to be a place of beauty again, I want it to be a symbol of pride for the valley again, but most importantly, I want it to be a place for healing again.”
“Yes, I will continue burning things down until you talk to me,” Harry yells. Charred pieces of wood are falling all around them. Gold-bright flames are licking at the once-orange walls. Jemima Graves has just Apparated a mere handful of metres from them and is staring at the half-burning street with a face full of disbelief and exhaustion.
“I still don’t understand how that was supposed to work.”
Harry Potter was spotted last weekend at ex-girlfriend Ginevra Weasley’s wedding. As Ms Weasley, seeker for the Holyhead Harpies, tied the knot with her girlfriend and owner of highly fashionable sportswear line
just so,
“I’m happy you’re saving that house,” he says softly. “It’s beautiful. I can understand why you felt called to it.”
All the time.
“Thank you,” he tells Iris before he leaves, when the laughter has died down and the light outside is beginning to fade.
His words are quick. His face is pained. You stifle a laugh. Of course, you’re both broken. Of course, it was never going to be easy, you and him, because there have always been expectations placed heavy onto your shoulders, heavy and cold, because you grew up around a war, like trees around metal fencing. There are cracks in your sense of self, and they run too deep to ever heal without leaving pink-ribbon scars, raised and smooth and shiny-skinned. Of course, you’re afraid and hurt, but you’re never going to be any different, you realise. This is who you are: broken and half-healed. You can’t be anything else, not right now, not when you’ve only just started to put dow your shield and show yourself to the world.
It has long been pointed out by scholars that certain spells might fall out of use, not because they are harmful or because they are rendered inefficient or inadequate by the progress in magical spellwork, but because they don’t fit with the social mores of the time. Amorae is a perfect example of such a spell.
He pauses.
, I think.
“This is not a house.”
) Draco never answered in kind, of course, but he looked like an ice shelf fissuring, bright and broken, as he whispered
Harry,
I do not wish to interfere with your private affairs, but I couldn’t help but notice the dreadful sadness emanating from you when I looked at those pictures in the Daily Prophet. I can’t imagine how it must have felt like for you, watching Ginny on the happiest day of her life and knowing that you’ve lost her forever. But, Harry, I come bearing hope for you, for I am quite certain that Ginny wasn’t meant for you.
(Finally.)
“There are some ghosts who aren’t the nicest to have around. Mrs Golay, for instance, has failed to learn how to shut up for a single second in the past ninety years she’s been here, and I wouldn’t want to compare her voice to nails on a blackboard but—no, it absolutely sounds the same. Mrs Brodard is awfully racist too. Some of us who died young and tried to keep up with the world as it moved forward have been trying to teach her not to use slurs, but it’s an uphill battle with her. What I’m saying is, they’re not all like me, young and hip and fun. Some of them are… lacking in the human decency and social graces department.” She pauses. “We’d still want them to stay, though!”
“He was never going to stay,” Harry whispers, as if to himself, in the hallowed silence. “He’s done what he came here for, so he left.”
(You will take the memory of being touched by a man, of his firm, bony shoulders under your hands and of his stubble on your chest, and you’ll shove it down, down, down and you’ll forget it because you can’t be gay, not when you’ve jumped over so many hurdles already and not when you’re holding your happy ever after in your hands and not when it’d destroy the life you worked so hard to build for yourself. But most of all, you can’t be gay because you stopped being a freak when you were eleven and a large man knocked on your door and took you away, and you promised yourself that those days were over. And you became the golden boy and the sacrificial lamb. You became the hero and the martyr, and you were none of these things, not really, but it never mattered because, finally, you weren’t a freak anymore.)
“Wait,” he tries to plead. “No, no, no, no! Don’t make me go yet, let me stay here!”
“Good work, boys,” comes a cheerful voice from behind them.
“The house wouldn’t let me bond to it because it was protective of you. Draco’s the one who figured that out after he met you and you introduced him to all the other ghosts. Once I promised I would let you all stay, the house accepted me as its owner. So Draco left.”
Blond-haired came out and started yelling too. Then, he read the piece of paper and yelled some more, but not at black-haired friend anymore. (Side note: I would not like to be Pansy, the cow, the bitch, the traitor, who will die many painful deaths.)
“I know.” Harry huffs a dry little laugh. “We both were. Not easy living through a war before you’re even properly an adult, is it? It broke me, but you were broken too. You shouldn’t have been expected to fix me.”
He takes a sharp breath in.
“I will translate for you,” Iris continues. “This time, mind you. I won’t always be around. I’d say I have a life of my own, but clearly, I don’t. Still, I might have better things to do, you know? A girl can hope! So… As I was saying. I’ll translate for you into French, and then Annemarie said she would translate into Swiss German for Greta and Vreni. So we all know what you’re saying and we can give informed consent—that’s the phrase, isn’t it? Informed consent? Or was it enthusiastic consent?”
“I can’t believe you came,” you whisper like you’d pray a soft Ave Maria in the hallowed silence of a church.
Draco hums and moans around him, and Harry turns into the earth or the sky, something vast and impossible and all-encompassing. Everything about him is burning, burning, burning under Draco’s pleasure-spit touch. His nerve endings light up like sparks. He turns into a constellation. He can’t think. He can’t breathe. There’s nothing else here but him, and Draco, and the natural-disaster pleasure unfurling in his chest. (A flood. A forest fire. A hurricane or an earthquake.) He’s going to come. He’s going to come with Draco touching him, stroking him, sucking him—and then it’ll be over, he remembers.
“I know, love. I know you do. It’s fine, love, we’re together now. We’re together now.”
“I want you to fuck me,” you repeat. “I want you to ruin me. I want you to tear me to shreds and pick me apart and destroy me.”
“I…” Hermione starts, then stops. “Well, I forgot to eat lunch. Theobalt from Ancient Manuscript finally found the time to bring me that 14th-century treatise on mind magic I requested a couple of months ago and I just couldn’t wait to open it. I nibbled a couple of biscuits from the packet I keep in my desk drawer—not while I was reading, of course, I have manners,” she adds with a pointed look at me. She always used to give us grief when we opened our school books at the dinner table and stained them with all manner of edible matter.
The extension explodes again little more than twenty-four hours after that.
I stand up and turn. Every inch of his skin is covered in my handwriting.
It’s not that Harry ever meant to buy a sanatorium, and it’s not that he ever meant to find himself here in the first place, but he’s been grabbing the first Portkey to anywhere for years, now. He’s been trying to leave England behind like adults leave their childhood, locked in a toy chest in the bedroom that used to be your own but is only ever a guest room or a memory now.
Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.
Harry lets the warm-amber of the brandy trickle down his throat as image after image of Draco flash in his mind. Draco refusing to hold his hand in public. Draco refusing to meet his friends. The row they had after Harry, hurt and exhausted from never feeling good enough, had told Draco he loved him, despite Draco’s insistence Harry never speak the words.
“I… What? How do you know? Did he tell you that? He’s never said it to me. Wait, no. It’s not that he’s never said it. It’s that he kept repeating he wasn’t in love. Every time, Pansy. Every time we met, he’d say it. Again and again and again. He's never once given me a hint he liked me at all, and... it hurt. Every time.”
Hermione,
“I want you,” Draco kisses into the skin of Harry’s neck, and Harry thinks he could weep from the words.
You don’t know what to do with yourself. Everything hurts and your chest is on fire. You’re not going to make it through the night, not without seeing him, not without making this right.
It feels ridiculous, dragging this on now that we’ve admitted our feelings. Unnecessary.
I don’t know, and yes. That’s how you’re supposed to know who your soulmate is. Don’t worry, though, the writing fades after a day or so.
“Harry? Harry Potter? I don’t think we’ve seen each other since we left Hogwarts!” He extends his hand towards me, a wide smile spreading across his face. I have no idea who he is.
Later that night, desperate and drunk out of his mind, Harry Apparated to Hermione’s flat.
You’re not gay.
PS: I don’t think Pansy’s very happy. She says you’re to bother Blaise. Something about stopping him from making the worst decision of his life.
The ghosts are friendly and chatty and very interested in Harry’s plans for the restoration.
You want to tell him how wrong he is. How different things are, this time. You want to hold his face, and you want to tell him you’ll never reject him again if he’ll have you. But time’s running out, and you have a job to do, and you’ve never been good with words, have you? You’ve never known how to use them unless it was to goad or hurt. So you just blurt out the first thing that comes into your head, and it’s confused and wrong, but Draco agrees to see you again, and it’s good enough, you think.
She doesn’t say anything else—not hello, or how are you, or I need your help. She doesn’t request a chair or follow up that statement with anything at all. She just says she’s been drugged as the words have been sitting like knives upon her tongue for days and waits.
“Are you going to stop staring at some point? Or are insults your kind of foreplay, and we’re going to end up fucking against a wall again?” you spit. You’ve got nothing else to lose, there’s a hole in your chest already, there, just there where your heart used to be. Nothing matters anymore, now, and you savour the words on your tongue—you hope they hurt him, you hope they make him look away in shame or guilt. You hope they break this semblance of normalcy between the both of you, where you pretend that everything is still the same, that you can still trade barbs and be enemies and that the entire world didn’t go down in flames before you even were properly adults, that you’re not battered and broken and entirely out of place everywhere you go.
Her report, when she turns it in the next morning, does not state that the explosion was an accident. It is filled with sharp words and she’s underlined the words “highly illegal” three times in blue ink.
, he thinks, and it cuts him in half like a guillotine.)
“Sir? Can I help you?”
“Silence!” Iris eventually commands. “We have a bonding ritual to complete!” she adds, first in French, then again in English.
When Harry asks for Draco, the elf disappears with a loud pop. There are irises spreading their yellow-purple petals in gouache-fireworks along the facade of the house, and Harry decides it is a good omen. (Still, in his chest, his heart sends his blood crashing against his ribs like waves.)
It’ll all be worth it because you’ll forever love him, with every single inch of your being, so when he tells you he wants you, he’s wanted you for longer than he can remember, you answer, “You have me. You have me for as long as you want.”
Tomorrow will make you or break you.
I love you.
You run out of words, suddenly. It is overwhelming, acknowledging this. You let out a heavy sigh. You’ve gone this far, you remind yourself. You’ve told him this much. And you’re still afraid that he’ll reject you, still afraid he’ll tell you he never loved you, still afraid it might have been just sex to him—but you’ve lied so much already, and you’ve hidden so much already, and if he breaks you? You know you’ll heal. You know you’re strong enough, now.
“And it’s not like that—I mean, yes. I know. We broke up. But you’re still the only person that might be able to help. I tried the bonding ritual, you know? It didn’t work. The house rejected me. No one had any idea of what went wrong. I’m not trying to get you back or anything weird, I swear. I just really need you to help me figure out what’s wrong.”
Please note that this chapter is explicit. If that's not your thing, you can skip to/wait for the next chapter.
“Harry.”
Harry answered the very same night.
Him and you—it just works, you decide. You’re not gay, of course, but you’re still single. There’s no harm in having a good fuck once in a while. Some of your friends do it. It doesn’t have to mean anything. No one else ever has to know.
The days pass in a blur of tears and sleep and unbearable pain.
You don’t even know who I am!
They do not stop kissing.
“I told her we’d do it without her,” she adds, clearly delighted by her own story. “I know she hates feeling left out.”
Our burrow is getting crowded. Aunt Gnomina will not stop talking my ears off. Decided on digging a new burrow by the cabbage patch. Dug ten inches. Took a nap in the hole. Good day.
“Älgen äter min halsduk,” Harry’s translation spell says.
You climb into bed and softly shake Ginny awake. She looks at you with sleep-heavy eyes. She cries when you tell her you’re sorry, and she kisses you when you tell her you love her, you really do, and you’re going to be better now, you’re going to make her happier now. She falls asleep between your arms, her head resting on your chest, her ginger hair on your face. You can smell the green apples in her shampoo, and when you remember that Draco smelled like cedar and smoke? You shove it down and decide to never think of it again.
“Nothing! I’m not going to do anything, Iris! I can’t! Don’t you think I asked him to stay? Don’t you think I begged? He asked me to let him go. He said I hurt him enough already. What was I supposed to do?”
“Oh, you’re awake,” you say instead. Obvious observations, always a suave choice. Small wonder Draco hasn’t asked you to marry him yet with wit that sharp.
For a long time, no answer appears. Then, later that night, I feel my shin grow warm. It’s almost time for bed then and I’m sitting in the soft light of my bedroom, listening to the wireless and absentmindedly stroking Freya, my favourite kneazle
It might have ended there, reader, but it doesn’t because in the aftermath of the explosion Draco Malfoy comes out of his shop.
Draco nods and cries and doesn’t say anything else. Harry kisses his hair, then slowly lets his arms fall to his sides and takes a step back. Draco doesn’t look at him.
and she spoiled you rotten for a good two years before she died. She was married once, long before you were born. Her husband, Lucius, my father - he wasn’t a very good man. He had artifacts in his possession, before he died. Dark, dangerous, powerful artifacts. And you must understand,
“Vous avez ma bénédiction,” Mrs Brodard continues, her voice rough but firm.
The daughter, it turned out, studied biology at the local university and spoke almost flawless English. Everything was easier after that: the building had once been a
Harry walks through the bushes and the brambles that now grow wildly in what was once an immaculate park. He should not have snapped at Draco, he knows this.
It’ll be okay.
Fistfuls of bramble cut Harry’s hands with their thorns as the rain peppers cold kisses down his neck and weighs his woollen sweater down. It hurts, and it is cold, and every inch of Harry’s skin sings with pain. Still, it hurts less than remembering that he loved Draco (than remembering Draco never really loved him back.)
I’m not the marrying kind, Draco. You’ve got to understand that. I’ve been bound to too many people already, everyone’s always expected so much of me that I’ve never really felt free to chose my path in life. I wish I could have accepted your ring. I wish I could have worn it, I wish I could have been happy about it. I can’t — and in a way, this is also something that’s been stolen from me. But it doesn’t mean I don’t love you. It doesn’t mean I don’t want to spend the rest of my life with you.
(All you could do is done.)
“It’s a bit predatory, don’t you think, going after blokes who are too young to remember your role in the war.”
“Et la mienne,” a woman in a stiff woollen suit adds.
“I can’t kiss you, Malfoy.”
He’s fucking himself on your cock, and you’re crying out his name, the carefully distant “Malfoy” blurring into the round syllables of “Draco”, because he’s been Draco ever since you first fucked against a wall in the back alley of a dingy pub and you’ve only been kidding yourself ever since. He’s moving excruciatingly slowly, lowering himself down the length of your cock, stroking himself, eyes half-lidded and pleasure-blurred. And if you could think clearly, you’d realise he knew exactly what you needed him to do. He made you give up control, he made you let go entirely. He made you feel safe and warm and seen, in a way no one else seems to be able to.
“Yes, that is exactly what you asked me here to do, isn’t it?”
Fuck you. Fuck you for making me feel like I do. Fuck you for making it impossible for me not to love you when you went a rejected me. Rejected me, Harry. Do you have any idea how that feels? I loved you so much. I loved you. I still do. I can’t stop loving you. [words angrily traced.]
She floats down to Harry and sits her fog-like form down on the pew next to him.
and Harry’s filled with pleasure so bright that Harry thinks his lighthouse heart must light up the entire room—the entire city even. The entire country, perhaps. So he does not die, and he does not stop moving inside Draco, he does not stop turning into a beacon of hope and pleasure and he does not stop calling out Draco’s name.
“I loved you,” Draco says, staring into the distance with tears on his face. “I loved you so much. I was too broken to tell you, too afraid of rejection. Too afraid you’d leave one day and I’d be left with a hollow heart and no way of ever patching myself up. I loved you and it broke my heart, seeing you give and give and give everything you could to people who never deserved it. It broke me to see you attend memorials and galas and speeches. You always came back so drained and were sad for days afterwards, but still, you went. I could never protect you like I wanted. I never knew what to do about it. I wish I could have told you this then. Told you how much I loved you. Begged you to keep what little flame of happiness you had in your heart, to let me tend to it until it turned into a fire again. I could never, and then you left. It was my fault, but it still hurt, you know? It was important to me, what we had. You were important to me. I wish we could have said goodbye.”
But this is the wrong boy, and the wrong room, and the wrong dream.
I shouldn’t, of course. I should wait a few days, I should clear my head, talk it over with Ron. I should do a whole lot of things that I don’t feel like doing at all, so I don’t do any of them. I just leave my office on my lunch break and walk through the streets of London.
So Harry walks, and all the while, the lighthouse lamp goes round. And round. And round. And Harry lets it guide his steps. (
This owl, however, was not on the roof or in the street or sitting on the windowsill. This owl had found its way into Harry’s bed and was nestled under Harry’s blankets, hooting softly with satisfaction. Harry should have thrown it out, but it looked warm and comfortable and Harry didn’t have the heart. So he fed it a treat and let it bury its funny little owl head in his pillows while he opened the letter attached to its leg.
I answer immediately. I’ve taken to carrying my pen and journal in my pocket wherever I go. I do not tell my mind healer what for, but I’ve been feeling a lot happier lately. I’ve been smiling a lot wider. I think she’s happy with my progress.
Good. Yes. I am. Male, I mean. Moving on. Second question…
Under his fingers, Draco comes apart. The room fills with sounds of ecstasy (moans and whimpers and sighs.) “Let me come inside you,” Harry begs, his voice rough with pleasure and desire and anticipation all at once.
The word is whispered in a language Harry understands. The wind hasn’t spoken it, nor the lake, nor the leaves crunching underfoot.
“I can see why you like the building,” Iris cuts in, lounging in mid-air with her legs crossed, “it’s beautiful. My parents sent me here from Lausanne, and I don’t think I’d ever seen a mountain this close before. I remember I loved it here before I got too sick to go outside. They’d let me walk in the mountains for hours. My parents wouldn’t have approved of that, but people here are from a different stock. They respect the way good exercise and mountain air make you feel.”
I also try not to think of the particular way Draco used to stand hunched over cauldrons in his lab at the ministry when I visited him.
Harry turns the key in the lock and pushes the door, Iris goes straight through the wall and swoops a few times in mid-air before disappearing again.
never fell from my lips—but I lost you in the process and when I lost you, Draco? When I lost you, the entire world went grey and I lived every day like I’d been wrapped in gauze or smothered in fog. When I lost you, I became a ghost or an empty shell, and life isn’t worth living like this. Life isn’t worth living without you.”
You're kissing him.
The ghost mimes throwing up then lets out a thrill of laughter.
“Harry.”
“It’s okay. You did the best you could. I’ve forgiven you a long time ago.”
The words are a silver bullet through Harry’s heart, and Harry thinks his thick jumper might grow red with the impact of them (a pain-peony blooming warm and wet across the cable-stitched wool.). He wants to punch Draco or to kiss him or to fall apart entirely.
“And you should be warned, I will stay here until he comes back or until you tell me where he is. Because I really cannot stress how important it is that he knows that leaving him the first time was the worst mistake of my entire life and that I am not letting him go once again if I can help it.”
PANSY!
“I bought a house,” Harry says. It is an early April morning and he’s standing at the gates of Malfoy Manor, drizzle sticking his hair to his forehead and dripping down his neck.
“Stay,” Harry says again, taking Draco’s wrist in his hands and holding them as gently as if they are a fragile heirloom or an injured bird. “Stay—please, Draco. Please. I’ll be better. I promise I will. I’ll change. I’ve changed already. Stay, Draco. Stay for me. Please. We’ll make it work this time, I promise.”
Draco turns to leave.
It took Harry a week of desperate hope and bitter disappointment to decide he needed to turn over a new leaf. A clean break, in a new place. Somewhere he could start putting himself back together.
All sorts of conflicting feelings immediately bubble up inside Harry’s chest at the words. He is speaking before he can stop himself.
In this too, he was lying.
(And again.)
It was not always bad, being in love with Draco Malfoy.
“I don’t even remember leaving her,” Pansy whispers with shiny, round tears rolling down her cheeks, “I loved her so much, and I don’t even remember leaving her, and when I woke up I was going to marry that idiot Bletchley.”
Harry barely lasted six months until he decided he needed a change of scenery again. Luna was in Iceland, at the time, looking for an imaginary animal or other and suggested Harry join her. Harry did, and he spent weeks traipsing through volcanic rocks and along jagged cliffs above the sea. Then, as surely as he did the first time, he grew restless again.
He should not have looked at Draco’s face and seen the past there, is the real problem.
The man shot him a doubtful look. He took his mobile phone out of his pocket and pointed at it.
Harry sobs softly at the words, standing statue-still and grief-frozen.
“Je beaucoup argent. Faire attention. Très aimer,” Harry’s disastrous translation spells said.
I pause.
I write until the page is entirely black with my words. Then, I turn the page and start again.
At quarter to four, I am losing my mind behind a glass case containing an oddly shaped marble sculpture, mysteriously labelled
When you finally get home, after a long talk with Nicholas and too much paperwork, you close the door gently behind you.
There were days that stuck to Harry’s skin like tar, dark and sticky and pungent. There were days that wormed their way into his heart until he thought his entire bloodstream was poisoned with the terrible feeling of never being enough (mercury ran through his veins, then, dazzling as love and deadly as loneliness.) And slowly, like sand trickling through in an hourglass, it became too much.
Love,
“Oh Draco,” Harry finally whispers. “Oh, Draco, god, I love you.”
“It wasn’t right, I see that now. A child cannot grow up without being allowed to laugh, and cry, and love. But I never had the opportunity when I was a girl myself, and I didn’t know how to tell my own child I loved him more than my life. I hurt him, denying him a normal childhood. I taught him to put up walls that he never knew how to take down, and by the time I realised how much damage I’d done, it was already too late… You’d already left.”
“I want to see you. Please, I want to see you,” he pleads, molten-metal eyes heavy-hot and resting on Harry’s skin.
“I’m sorry,” I whisper. “I’m sorry this awful thing is happening to you. It is not okay and you have every right to feel violated.”
“Don’t apologise, you don’t have any obligations towards me,” he cuts in with flint-hard hurt dancing in his pupils. Your chest fills with the deafening sound of fissuring ice shelves. You did this, you realise. You put this hurt in his eyes.
Harry wanted to scream or sob (to punch every word through a wall),
Mrs Malfoy’s face is perfectly composed and perfectly neutral as she politely listens to Harry, her porcelain hands demurely joined together in front of her. Harry continues:
“You have come to the right place, Harry. Come, come, let us go at the back of the shop and I will put together a potion especially for you.”
She absentmindedly plays with the understated strand of pearls around her neck. Despite her serene face and her gracious posture, this is not an easy conversation for her, Harry realises. (It is not an easy conversation for him either, learning of a past he’d never looked close enough to see. It’s not an easy conversation at all.)
Draco walked over, shook Harry’s hand.
The thought struck Harry like lightning as Draco spoke to the casket in soft, wet tones.
“Fuck you, Malfoy,” you hiss through your teeth.
who was kind enough to point out a handful of mistakes in this chapter. All remaining typos are mine.
Can you see everything I write?
The lighthouse in Draco’s chest does not die out.
Harry’s whimpering helplessly now, he’s overflowing entirely with words and feelings and want,
Draco sobs quietly, shoulders shaking.
“What can Plopsy be doing for visitor, Sir?” he asks, dignified and stiff.
She pauses. Hesitates.
“Excuse me, gentlemen,” Jemima Graves says after a while. “There are some forms I need you to fill in if you don’t mind.”
Because here’s the thing about you: your body’s filled to the brim with the mindless routine of all the days you rolled your tired body out of bed, numb and exhausted and animated only by your sense of duty. And you’ve been so busy crafting this careful identity for yourself that you can’t quite remember you really are. You don’t know who Harry is when he’s not the hero and not the Auror, not the golden boy and not the protector. You can’t believe it’s never bothered you before.
“You say you woke up,” I ask. “Can you tell me what you mean by that?”
They still do not stop kissing.
“There’s got to be something. I know they’re not normal dreams, Nott. I woke up with bruises from Draco’s fingers on my wrist. Normal dreams don’t do that, do they? There has to be something wrong, something you’ve missed. Something you’ve overlooked, something you’ve not tested for?”
That night, when Harry slips underneath the crisp cotton covers, he thinks the man might have been a powerful legilimens too, from the way he smiled and winked and always seemed to know exactly what Harry wanted to say.
“I love you,” Draco says as he holds Harry through his orgasm. Inside Harry’s chest, happiness pools warm and rich, like honey or gold.
“I knew I’d see my mum, you know. And my dad. Sirius too,” he continues because the words have turned into a waterfall, now and because he’s been drowning in the ocean of that story since the war ended, “I knew I’d be reunited with every single person that ever loved me in the entire world. I knew I could decide to walk into their arms and never have to fight or hurt or bleed again.”
Pansy’s eyes are bright with tears when she stops speaking. She reaches over my desk and covers my hand with her delicate fingers. Her skin is cold and smooth on mine, and I look up from the notes I wasn’t taking anyway.
I sit. The corridor is clean, if bare, and dimly lit. There certainly aren’t any signs that someone is living here but I can hear several voices coming from another room. Before I can change my mind about being here, the witch appears again.
(How much Draco wants him.)
Draco doesn’t move, and you think he’s going to push you away, so you murmur into the skin of his neck: “Don’t you want to take the golden boy apart, Draco? Don’t you want to stain him, to taint him? Don’t you want to show him exactly how dirty he is? How inept a saviour? How much of a sinner? Isn’t it what you want, Draco, what you’ve always wanted?”
It’s not what I’m asking, not really. As far as I’m concerned, he could be fifty and I don’t think I’d bat an eyelash, but I want to know if he’s lived the war too. If we were in this together, if he’ll understand when I inevitably tell him that I don’t know how to grieve.
“That’s bollocks,” Draco answered immediately in his knife-like voice (Harry only was beginning to be familiar with it then.) “You suffered more than all of them put together, and still they expect you to dance in front of them like a trained monkey. They did nothing to support you, Harry. This entire year, they did nothing but go on with their own little lives, leaving you behind to cope with all the wounds of the war. You owe them nothing.”
You owl Malfoy a little more than a month later.
“That’s enough, Potter. Hand over the bottle. You’ve had plenty enough to drink,” he orders.
It matches you with your soulmate.
Later:
At some point during the exchange, my hand has moved to my crotch and I’m stroking myself in earnest now, imagining his hands, his mouth, his skin. I let his words dig a nest into my heart until I feel like the months of April: entirely new and bursting with life. When I finally come, I suck at the skin of my wrist where his last words have appeared and I quietly mouth
I need to warn you about one thing. I’m sorry I haven’t told you before. There is a distinct possibility you know me. Please remember the person you’ve come to know through our conversation. Please.
So here I am. In the pouring rain. All the doors look the same. No sign of a clinic at all. No sign there’s anything here but rows of cheap council flats and a few choice rats rummaging through the rubbish bins. I double-check the number on my parchment and I knock. A middle-aged witch answers. She looks nothing like a healer. She’s got bright blue hair and she’s wearing Doc Martens.
“He’s an idiot, but Lord help me, you are too!” she replies, jabbing a ghostly finger at the centre of Harry’s chest. “Do you know what I would have given for a chance at love when I was alive? Can you even understand what it feels like for everything you want to be completely impossible? Completely unspeakable? You think you know because you’re so very sad and the one boy you love so very much is being an absolute cretin, but you have no idea. No idea. I’d have had to marry a man, had I lived. I’d have had to kiss him and lie with him and bear his children without ever loving him a single day in my life. And you know what? I would have given anything to find a girl with whom I could make it work. I would have killed for that chance Harry, and I will not watch you throw it away like it’s not worth fighting for!”
The man doesn’t turn around, but he’s got starlight hair and he’s wearing a fuzz-soft jumper despite the biting cold of early morning, and Harry would know him everywhere. (Draco. Draco. Draco.)
When Harry is cold and restless like water at the very bottom of a well, the next day, Draco wraps a gold coin in soft paper covered in handwritten well-wishes and leaves it on Harry’s pillow (there are seven beds in the room, and the evening sunlight illuminates only three of them.)
Once was already more than enough, and twice was ridiculous, but three times? Three times, Jemima Graves decides, three times is nothing short of an affront!
I hear a frantic voice asking me if I’m okay. I know that voice, but grief and loss take up all the space in my brain and I can’t remember who it belongs to. A hand grabs my wrists and pulls me flush towards a warm body. Hermione, my mind supplies as my face is buried into dark curls.
So what becomes of Jemima, you ask? Well, reader, if you were to visit Jemima in, say, a year, you’d find her in a field in the Andes. She’d be wearing a pair of corduroy overalls and bright yellow wellies. Her hair would be long, flowing down her back, and she’d be carefully feeding a bottle of milk to a young orphaned Mooncalf. Rest assured, reader, that she is happy in this new life of hers, far away from burning streets and illegal extensions and report forms. And rest assured that the other protagonists of this story are happy too, as they learn to live and love and trust and to not set anything on fire.
You open your mouth. The journalist doesn’t let you talk.
Harry,
The softness of your words, or perhaps the meaning of them, surprises Pansy. She stops rubbing at the bridge of her nose with stress-headache fingers and looks at you. For the first time, her black eyes are filled with silence, and not with judgment or annoyance at all.
“Well, I thought you’d never ask.”
very silly to write you a whole letter when you’re barely old enough to talk and won’t be reading for years yet, but humour an old man,
“I remember Draco’s funeral. I remember coming home with Luna afterwards and I remember two weeks after that, maybe three. I asked Luna to move in with me, and she said yes, and I remember it was the first time I thought maybe I was going to be alright.”
Marstrand is beautiful and quiet, with cobbled streets and old houses and lilac bushes spilling in soft hues of purple and mauve over every fence. Harry books a room for himself at the
“Charlie could use help with the dragons,” Ron suggested one day over a late evening cup of tea. Harry had been telling them he couldn’t stand the idea of going back to Grimmauld Place when every single room was still filled with memories of Draco. He couldn’t stand facing them yet. “I could owl him if you liked. Might do you good to be on your own, for a bit… Go back to nature, you know. Supposed to heal you and all that.”
He’s not there, and you are alone.
Yet, it doesn’t matter.
“You’re not? Well, you’re doing a great job hiding it.”
He doesn’t answer.
“Ha! See, I told you I was keeping up with the real world! Well, what are you waiting for? Open the door! Let’s get in! Let’s go meet everybody!”
Fine. Do you think it’s possible to be entirely honest with someone else? Do you think it’s possible to always share, to the best of your understanding, your feelings and motivations with someone else? And more importantly, do you think one should?
Ron’s there too, I realise. I can’t imagine why. They weren’t there when I fell asleep last night. Hermione’s still hugging me tightly. She’s sobbing. Ron looks like he hasn’t shaved in days.
You should let it go, you think, fiddling with the silver clasps on your travelling cloak. You should let it go, you should grieve the love that you’re not allowed to pour into the cup of his hands, and you should let yourself wallow for a while, do something stupid. Get a tattoo, climb a mountain. Whatever shit people do when they’re heartbroken.
whispered into hair or soft skin. (The blade-glint hope cuts deep gashes into Harry’s skin at the thought.)
“I’m not saying the world isn’t full of misogynist pricks. Believe me, I’m not. But we’ve established that whoever drugged me had both a despicable sense of moral and an impressive mastery of potions. And that’s exactly the kind of person who’s behind the potion Pansy’s dear father thought acceptable to drug her with.” Hermione sets down her beer on the side table and twists her hair up into a bun that she secures with her wand. She sighs, then adds, “Besides, do you really think it’s a coincidence that Harry followed a lead while investigating Pansy’s case and now there’s Draco all over his dreams? You know it has to all be linked!”
spell even is.
My pen is on the paper before I can stop myself.
I don’t know what I expect from him, in that moment. I expect him to take me in his arms, maybe. To kiss me, even. To say something witty or cutting or self-deprecating.
The inside of the shop is surprisingly bright, given the lack of windows. I suspect someone with an expert hand at interior design charms has had a hand in that at some point. Other than that, the shop is entirely unremarkable. The hardwood floors are tarnished with time, and pine shelves full of boxes and bottles and jars stretch from floor to ceiling on every wall. I recognise raw ingredients—nothing rare, things like asphodel and dittany, things I remember using in potions class at Hogwarts.
Their kisses turn savage after that, full of bruising fingers and teeth and love confessions hissed against hot skin.
New human in the garden, today. Long blond hair and smells like food or flowers or both. Her name is “mother”. Sat on the lawn with the blond-haired nuisance and spoke a lot. Did not yell, but also did not give me a biscuit. Unsure whether I like her. Said the word “Draco”. I have heard that word before. Feels like it has significance.
Draco does not look away. He walks towards you briskly.
“He came to the Manor, you know? The day after you left. He stood in the dining room, and he listed everything he blamed me for. I think it took the better part of an hour. He wasn’t dignified about it either: he screamed about the war, and about letting Lucius entertain a genocidal madman, about the loneliness of never feeling that my love was unconditional. Then, he cried as he told me he didn’t know how to be loved. It ruined his relationship with you, he said, and he didn’t want his relationship with me to go the same way. I cried too, that day, for the first time since I was a child.”
And this is when Jemima Graves snaps.
, Draco’s waiting for him on the balcony. It’s a beautiful day, the spring sunshine warm and generous and flooding everything with light.
When Jemima Graves makes it to the scene of the explosion, it’s four in the morning and half the street is on fire. As she steps gingerly over the flames to inspect the faulty charm-work attached to what was once a gaudy yellow and orange facade but is currently a jumble of charred wood and a thick layer of soot, her left shoe catches on fire. If Jemima Graves were a different person, a less professional person, perhaps, she’d decide this is not worth her time. She’d take her shoe off and throw it at the burnt facade, she’d promptly Apparate back to her own pristine home to lie down in her soft bed and leave this awful, flammable mess to be dealt with in the morning. But Jemima Graves is not that person, so she settles for casting an Aguamenti at her feet and pointing an accusing finger at a tired, confused red-headed man in happy-hippogriffs pyjamas.
There are many questions sitting on Harry’s tongue, all of them about Draco. (
“We’d like to meet them,” Draco adds. “If you’d be so kind as to arrange that for us?”
“Please don’t repeat what I said a long time ago. I still hated you back then, I wanted to break you, but you’re not broken, Harry, no more than I am.”
I stare at him in disbelief.
I walk towards him, not entirely certain what to tell him when he saves me the trouble by recognising me.
“Potter,” Draco replies in a voice that sounds like granite or gravel, and Harry feels his dry-clay heart fissure behind his ribs.
I’d kiss you back. Oh, if you had any idea of how badly I want to kiss you. How I’ve wanted to kiss you for days.
Draco
he wants to cry.
Come, let us walk out of the shop, let us consider the shop next door.
When their bodies crash together, it is beautiful and inexorable, like waves against rocks; they kiss like they’re drowning, violent and desperate, with grabbing hands and halting breaths.
Edit: I am in debt of the lovely
“Yes.” Draco’s voice is rough as pumice and sweet as honey as he answers. “Anything you want, love. Anything at all,” he adds as his motions become slow as treacle dripping from a spoon. His hand on Harry’s cock slows too, coaxing every feeling of pleasure out of Harry’s chest and onto Harry’s skin.
Nott is silent for a little while and massages the bridge of his nose, standing in the makeshift examination room. I stare at the passé flowered wallpaper and try to think of what I could say to convince him to look again, to look harder.
Everything smells of smoke, as they kiss in a half-burning street, hungry hands fisted in each other’s shirts and robes and hair. Everything around them is burning, and still, they kiss and kiss and kiss, and the world could be ending, they wouldn’t stop kissing because, reader, they’ve waited so long for this moment to finally come, they’ve wanted this for so long, and they’ve been so ashamed and afraid of wanting it, and it’s here, oh, reader, it’s finally here.
Have had an idea. Will make blond-haired read the parchment so my friend will come back. Have talked cousin Gnorothy and great-grandma Gneodora into helping me. They will make noise until maybe-Draco comes out and then I will run and place the parchment inside his home.
Immediately after writing that sentence, I remember with more than a little shame that they have witnessed more than one graceless breakdown. Why on earth would they want to kiss me?
You’re the only person I’ve ever been this in love with. You’re the only person I’ve ever bared my entire soul to. You’re the only person I can imagine myself with.
You should really define what you mean by knowing someone. Is it even possible for a person to know themselves entirely? Is it possible to be aware of every emotion? Every motivation?
Cousin Gnorothy found the noise button next to the door and threw rocks at it until maybe-Draco came out. Dragged parchment inside and left it on the floor. Took maybe-Draco’s scarf and heaped it on top, so he would see. Bit a small hole in it too. Cashmere and silk. Very satisfying but not as tasty as fudge. Strongly dislike human burrows: nowhere to dig. Was happy to get back out.
Black-haired friend came back! Held a piece of crumpled paper and yelled very loud and banged against the door. Great-grandma Gneodora almost had a heart attack, but it scared away the large frog that was trying to eat cousin Gnolanthe.
I think, and I forget about it.
“You think you’ve been targeted because you’re a woman?” I ask. The look Hermione shoots me makes me wish I had kept my mouth shut.
You close the door behind her.
I guess what I’m trying to say is—we don’t know each other. And I’d like to try to get to know you, if you’ll give me the chance.
Harry does not mean to answer that it didn’t hurt when he died because he’s never told anyone about it and because it would be a stupid answer anyway, wouldn’t it? But it’s the only one he has, this stupid answer, it’s the only one that wouldn’t feel false or trite or useless, and so the words escape his mouth unbidden before he can even think about holding them back.
(Later, you’ll throw up in the Ministry loo, shame and want and anger leaving your body all at once. Later, you’ll punch the wall, and it’ll stop you from crying, and you’ll pretend that it counts as being fine.)
But you can’t, suddenly. You can’t. You can’t bear to hear ‘it’s only sex’ again. You can’t bear to be reminded that he doesn’t love you. And you know he’ll only ever give you the scraps, the unwanted crumbs of him. It hurts like an iron brand to the chest, and you keep coming back to it all the same. And it’s always so good, but it’s ever enough, is it? It’s never enough, and the black-ink void behind your ribs eats away at your liver and your spleen a little more each time, and when there’s nothing left of you anymore, what will you do then?
“I don’t want to say that’s good–because it’s not–but that limits the pool of suspects, doesn’t it?” Ron continues, paying me no mind. “Did you eat or drink anything that you hadn’t prepared yourself or that might have been laced with the potion?”
At these words, Iris swoops down until her ghostly face is almost touching Harry, her eyes wide and bright under her line-thin eyebrows.
Draco’s face stays impassible.
Wands are drawn shortly after that, words turning to curses and hexes.
he thinks before realising the shape is all wrong, the face too round and the hair too long.
The words ring hollow, and you regret them the moment they spill from your tongue, but you’re a statue of pining and grief, and the sea of him keeps eroding at everything you are. You’ve given up  everything already, you’ve placed your heart and your life and any tiny chance at happiness you ever had on the altar of this impossible love, you’ve taken every single scrap of feeling that could fit inside you, and you’ve laid it at his feet, and—you’re empty now. Empty and hollow and broken, and all that’s left of you is the golden shell, the medals and the dress robes, the newspaper headlines and the gala invitations. You can’t let him take those too, because who would you be then?
I wrap her in my arms and hold her tight. I know what it’s like to have something foreign on your skin and something foreign in your head, and to not be able to feel entirely safe in your own body. I would have fired every spell I knew at my scar, back then, if I thought it might have helped.
The wonderful
I try not to wince at that. I try not to tell her that there are days when Draco’s funeral is all that I can think about. I try not to show that Draco’s death is still etched into every single one of my bones, a terrible sort of tattoo made entirely out of pain and loss.
“You’re not dead,” he finally says because he does not know what else he can tell Draco (because “I love you” and “You wanted me once” and “Could you still want me?” can never make it out of the cage of his teeth.)
“I don’t know what to say, Harry,” Draco finally says, and the sound of your name on his tongue for the first time fills you up like lightning or high tides. You’ve been calling him Draco since that first time in the dirty-dark of a back-alley, but he’s called you Potter all the while. (
He’s lying.
You lose yourself in the motion of fucking Draco until your body is made out of light and you feel the pleasure rolling down the mountain slopes of your chest like an avalanche. You’re holding him, and you’re calling out his name, and he’s matching every thrust of your hip, whispering dirty come-ons ionto your naked skin.
for treatment in 1935,” Draco says, “she’s one of the many people who passed away here during the time this place functioned as a sanatorium.”
“I shouldn’t have brought your role in the war into our argument,” Harry replies. He’s well aware this is not what he’s supposed to say, but the words have been burning his lips for too long and he finds he cannot keep them in his mouth any longer. “On the day we broke up. I’ve been thinking about it, and it was uncalled for. I’m sorry. It hurt at the time, that you left, but I understand why you did now.”
Understanding hits Harry all at once like a tidal wave. He’s spent a lifetime of running away from everything—from grief and from the war, from impotent rage and from heartbreak. From love too, from settling down somewhere and making a home. And it was never healthy, any part of it. Underneath all the Portkeys and the adventures, underneath the silent awe and the solitude, throughout every forest and every desert, on the edge of every cliff and every sea, he was always going to be the heart-broken boy who loved too much and was never loved enough. He was always going to be the grief-crucified boy who lost everyone before he was ever properly grown and who walked to his death before he had ever started to live, and—
, the letter said. And:
Tears roll down Draco’s delicate cheeks. The salt-wetness of them kisses your fingers, and you don’t know what it means. You want to wipe the wetness away, want to soothe the sadness away, but you’re not entirely certain he’d let you. You’re not entirely certain where you stand at all, and your anxious-wait heart sends blood crashing against your ribs in frantic waves.
“Tell me how you found my shop again?” He asks, grinding up the thick leaves of some sort of succulent plant into a paste. “Not that many people manage to find it by chance, especially since I can’t afford to have a proper storefront yet”
Grimmauld Place is dark and empty, and the loneliness of it sits heavy in my chest as soon as I’ve stepped foot on the old flagstone floor. I have no idea how I am going to make it through another night of not seeing Draco and I have no idea how I’ll survive seeing Draco again. I’m about seven coffees into not thinking about it when the Floo blares open.
When they tumble down on the rocks, when they pull at each other’s clothes and Harry’s back rests flush against the cool rocks as Draco touches him with hands careful and reverent as a saint holding a rosary, there is a light so bright in Harry’s chest that he thinks he might catch fire with it. (That he might burn and burn and burn until there’s nothing left of him but ash on a rock by the sea.) But he is not a pyre, and he does not consume, so instead he loves, and loves, and loves. Instead, he holds and he touches and he is touched until moans of ecstasy echo the faraway cry of seagulls.
spilling from his lips unbidden. He does not hold back. He does not try to protect himself. He gives himself entirely to Draco, and it’s reckless, and it’s glorious. And it’ll hurt him, oh it’ll ruin him entirely, it’ll hollow him out and it’ll burn him to the ground. By the time Draco’s done with him, he knows, he’ll be a shell of a human being, with sea-glass bones and armenian-paper skin, brittle and thin. Still, when Draco positions himself at the entrance of him, Harry fists his hands into his starlight hair and gazes into his storm-grey eyes, and whispers, “I want you. I want you. I want you.”
Then, both words are angrily scribbled through. I stare at my skin, fascinated.
And they should have been happy, then. They should have held onto each other. They should have healed and been healed and been safe. But they weren’t and they didn’t. In the real world, Draco felt like a granite cliff, immense and cold and entirely unmoving, and Harry kept running headfirst against the solid stone of him.
Harry and Draco walk up the winding path in silence, taking in the mountains and the meadows and each other’s comforting presence. Then, Iris appears behind one of the large Lebanon cedar trees and nothing is quiet anymore.
That’s all we can ever do, really. Learn from our mistakes and help others not make the same.
(You’re still waiting for the vines to break your bones, for the fruits to poison your bloodstream, for the orchids to clog your lungs.)
And just like that, Harry decides he’ll go. Immediately, a weight lifts off his shoulders. Immediately, there is laughter bubbling in his throat, and when it spills from his mouth, it echoes against the flagstone floor and reverberates across the vaulted ceiling until Harry can’t tell if Iris has joined in, or if he’s laughing alone, but he finds he doesn’t care because, for the first time in years, his life is his again to steer in the direction he wants. Because, for the first time in years, he wants to take a chance, he wants to jump off that cliff and find out if he can swim. Because, for the first time in years, he’s realised some things are worth fighting for.
Then:
“I’m sorry too,” Harry replies, instead of telling him he understands him or forgives him or loves him because he’s been avoiding thinking about their failed relationship ever since it ended, because the memory of it still splits  his chest into splintery halves, an ancient oak struck down by lightning.
I look into her face. I don’t think she’s joking. She looks resolute and terrifying and whoever wrote threats on her skin? Has no idea who they’re fucking with and exactly how much they’re going to regret it.
“Will you go on record and tell us about your whirlwind romance with Mr Sterling?”
“I’m not gay,” you say, because you aren’t, are you? (And would he touch you again if you were? Would he call you love and gently brush his long fingers along the line of your jaw if you were? Your chest constricts with a painful kind of longing at the thought.)
It takes me until the middle of the afternoon on the next day to find a strategy to get him to talk to me.
I smile and reach for my pen.
“We broke up, Harry,” Draco says slowly, the words cold, like dead fish in his mouth. “You left. Years ago. I haven’t seen you since.”
Sincerely
is my first thought upon waking up. Promptly followed by
“Please come in,” she says, stepping aside, “Let us discuss this in the morning room.”
I write late one evening on the pages of a brand new notebook.
Inside Harry's chest, his heart is a lighthouse (on fire.) He’s alive, and he’s burning, and he finds that he can’t tell the difference between both these things. (Perhaps he never could.)
It is plain to see from that extract, that the performing of the spell would have been a familiar occurrence for its readership, as none of the particularities of the spell are explained. Furthermore, it is not only well known but it is also extremely ritualised and codified: not only do the young people not cast the spell on themselves, instead relying on the elder to do it for them, there is also the existence of a sacred book in which each one of them must write their name in order to be assigned to their soulmates. It can be said that the ceremony is very much a part of the social mores of the time and that it would have been a milestone in a young person’s life, an important aspect of coming of age. Less than three centuries later, however, the practice has entirely disappeared from wizarding society.
Draco is sitting cross-legged on the floor again and talking to the ghost of a young woman. She’s dressed in an old-fashioned, knitted dress with ruched sleeves and a large bow at the collar, and her hair is all done-up in curls. On her face is a large, delighted smile as she talks. When she throws her head back and laughs, the sound is crystalline and joyous, and Harry thinks he’s never heard a sound quite as beautiful in a long time.
She leaves after promising that she’ll make Draco listen to that interview if she has to tie him down herself, and threatening you twice more for good measure.
“When Draco came along, your magical core started to open again. It was a slow process, at first but within a week, your core was lighting up all over like a Christmas tree. We thought that’s what he was helping you with. That’s why I couldn’t understand why he left.”
Love you,
“We usually only treat werewolves here,” he says when I’m done pouring my heart out to him. “We don’t even have enough beds for all of them. We don’t have enough funds.”
Iris eyes Draco lifting one eyebrow up.
They do not stop kissing.
There are many detailed accounts of the spell being cast. One of the best perhaps can be found in the 15th-century novel
I raise my sleeve, slowly.
It is the first time he offers information freely. My heart is beating in my throat. I can’t write my answer fast enough and then, I await his description of the ideal man with bated breath, feeling every bit the lovelorn heroine I’ve always insisted I wasn’t.
There’s no emotion in his words. No warmth, no surprise. They’re careful. Measured. Indifferent. Everything inside your chest turns to stone, heavy and cold.
He’s over Draco, he has been for years. Draco stole his breath and broke his heart and left him alone to painfully puzzle all the pieces back together, but he’s grown since then. He’s mended his heart, and he’s forgiven Draco, and he was going to be okay—being in the same house as him, working under the same roof. Working. It’s just that, it’s just working. Just this once, Draco said. Just this once and never again.
“You don’t have to, love. I’m here. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere. I’m here.” Draco slowly shifts Harry onto his back, spilling kisses and warm words of reassurance over his skin, licking at his nipples and trailing down, down, down over his sternum and navel and between his legs.
As far as he can remember, he’s always thought of Harry as water. It helped, not thinking of the real world, when Voldemort brought death to the manor. It helped, imagining the boy as a river (ever changing, ever moving, impossible to grasp or trap or own) when Draco’s own breath grew thick in his chest. In the aftermath of the war, when Harry was all that everyone would talk about, Draco decided that he was a brook (babbling and lively and impossible to ignore). To tell the truth, Draco doesn’t remember much of that time, except the number of cracks in the tiled floor of the kitchen, and the number of threads on the sleeve of his favourite jumper, and that Harry Potter would forever be a waterfall.
Draco’s left hand has five fingers, which is divisible by nothing else than one and itself, but they interweave with Potter’s own darker fingers and the skin inside his palm is smooth and sensitive and this is when Draco realises he’s hopelessly in love. He doesn’t say it, not yet. Instead, he decides Harry is the ocean, breathtaking and endless and beautiful.
“I have to.” Harry’s voice was flat and almost inaudible as he let himself fall onto the sofa and stared at the ceiling. “They’ve suffered too, they need someone to hold on to, to tell them it’ll be alright.”
Then, Draco finally comes, shuddering beautifully under Harry’s fingers and clenching around Harry’s cock, and Harry is filled with more pleasure than he’s ever experienced before (his vision goes white with it, his heart glows bright with it.)
Nothing works and his heart keeps beating slow and steady in the unbearable emptiness in his chest as the name of the only person he will ever want sits on his tongue and sticks to the roof of his mouth like honey.
I nod all the same.
he tells himself.
“Don’t you dare presume that you know anything about me, Harry James Potter. Now if you don’t mind, I will require that you stop your inane chit-chat and let me focus on my diagnostic charms. Why don’t you go outside and be useless there, mmm?”
“The view is incredible, here,” Draco whispers.
You'll be alright.
“Can I?” Draco asks, tugging at the band of Harry’s trousers. The lightning in Harry’s chest spreads to his limbs and throat and mouth. He does not give a coherent answer. He throws his head back, instead and whispers Draco’s name like a mantra or a prayer until Draco’s fingers are on him, gentle and tender and reverent. It is pitiful, how broken he sounds. How needy. How hollow. He tries to keep the desire behind the vault of his ribs, but it is too bright, too vast, and entirely too much. There is not enough space in Harry’s lightning-storm body to hold in exactly how much he wants Draco in that instant, how much he craves his ruinous touch, his match-stick gaze. He can’t move. He can’t. So he stands still, leaning against the bark. Want-frozen. Shame-cheeked.
After a lot of yelling, blond-haired and black-haired made water come out of their eyes and joined hands. Then, they engaged in the human ritual of licking each other’s mouth. Very entertaining, we all came out to watch. Cousin Gnorothy said it is how human babies are made. If it is true, I hope the new human will give me biscuits too.
, try talking to him like an actual adult instead of whining like an idiot.
I love you, Draco. I will forever love you.
Thank you for answering my questions.
“We’ll need a full list,” Ron says. “But this is good, it really is. From there, we can narrow down who had both motive and opportunity and we can figure out who did this.”
I’d start with your shoulder. I’d touch the skin there, softly. Then, I’d run my fingers gently along your collarbones and up your neck. I’d caress your jaw bone, I’d learn its shape by heart with my eyes closed. Then, I think I’d move on to your mouth. I’d trace your lips with my fingertips, I’d press one inside your bottom lip until the pad of it is wet.
Despite Harry’s translation spell, he can’t quite make out what the man is telling him. Asking if something was nice, perhaps? Or was it the word for green? He smiles politely, fully intending to make his way to the door without getting dragged into a conversation he only understands a fraction of, before he realises this man might know about Draco. Draco’s mother said he came here regularly, after all, and surely people would notice those things on such a small island?
it has white and blue flowered wallpaper, a white-painted desk, and a view of the sea. There is something calming about the air here, about the way the architecture is delicate and gorgeous, with white lattice-worked wooden balconies and pastel-painted facades; Harry feels almost at peace for the first time since Draco left him in an alpine inn, alone and heartbroken with an empty house that was always meant to be shared.
I come back with a large book in my arms. On its cover, the words “Magic in the Middle Ages” glimmer in gold lettering. That night, after I’ve fed the animals and done all of my chores, I sit on the sofa and start reading.
“Yes,” Harry whimpers. “Oh, Draco, yes.”
Shit.
It feels lush and lovely, and you can’t remember the last time you felt so alive. You’ve felt alive with Draco, yes, but it was a different feeling altogether. You were a lightning storm, then, or a forest fire, wild and dangerous, destructive and ravenous. You were the kind of alive that can only stay alive until it’s devoured everything in its path, the kind of alive that was always going to starve away sooner or later. There are vines hanging from your ribs, now, weighed down by orchids and lush fruits.
“You disappeared from your bed the instant you fell asleep,” Nott says as he waves his wand over me in a series of complicated diagnostic spells. “Completely gone. No trace of you. Not even a magical signature.”
. He walks through every room, opens one of the numerous pots of paint sitting like silent soldiers against the wall in the corridor, paints a room, or two, or three, or however many he manages before pain breaks him in half again.
(Because this is the thing about hope: it’s bright and warm and more dangerous than anything. It’s a million flint-firework sparks, and Harry’s made entirely of tinder and dry straw, and he’s been building fireproof walls of indifference and distance around his petroleum-puddle heart for longer than he remembers.)
Harry,
(I fail on both counts.)
“He’s in Sweden,” she answers in a soft voice. “A place called Marstrand. He always goes there when he’s not doing well. There’s something about the sea, I think. Something that always makes him feel better.”
My heart deflates as I read his questions. Of course, he’d be interested in the famous Harry Potter. Of course, he’d want to know all about him, because who doesn’t? I sigh and run my hand over my face.
“This is Iris,” Draco says, pushing himself to his feet. “She’s—well, a ghost. You’ve gathered that much, I imagine? Iris, this is Harry. He bought this whole building for reasons entirely beyond my comprehension.”
He’s put his beer down in favour of a quill and a parchment and is taking notes. I can’t remember him ever being so keen on writing stuff down before. Has to be Hermione’s influence, I think and it makes me smile. They deserve each other, they really do.
“You feel so good, Harry. You feel so good. Do you like this? Does this feel good? Tell me what you want, Harry. Tell me. You can have it all. Anything you like. Anything at all. Tell me.”
materialises in neat silver-white letters on my left elbow.
And so follow the man everywhere, I did. The expedition was a disaster. You grandad is a great man,
Draco, are you going to be pestering my girlfriend every time your ex shows up at your door? I’m not averse to it, but if you are, I will be having a word with Harry. We need to work out a schedule for his lovelorn break-downs so Pansy and I can go out on dates without a flurry of owls losing feathers all over our food.
I scribble the words, sitting on the grass in the mooncalf enclosure and balancing my journal on my knee. The answer comes almost instantly.
“I’m glad you’re here too, Draco. I’m glad we’re doing this together,” Harry replies, and it’s every bit as beautiful as he promised Draco it would be, once, on a rock by the sea. It’s every bit as warm with affection and blinding bright with happiness, and there are still days when Harry thinks he might burst with the intensity of the love that lives in his chest.
I love you.
Up close, I can see the details she’s trying to hide behind her put-together facade—the sharp eyeliner highlights a redness in her eyes that belies too little sleep and too many tears; her hands are flat against the houndstooth fabric of her skirt, pressing just a little too hard onto her thighs, the finger joints just a little too white. Everything about her form is just a little too tense, the shoulders just a little too square underneath the soft pastel knit, her chin just a little too jutted. Whatever it is she thinks happened, she’s not coping very well at all.
Ginny breaks up with you two weeks after that.
, my skin finally says.
“I’m afraid you’re going to pull out at the first homophobic slur thrown at you because those are bound to come. I’m afraid people will be angry with me for stealing you, for having the gall to tarnish you. But mostly I’m afraid that—I’m afraid that if I get what I’ve wanted for so long, I’ll end up losing it, and I don’t know if I’ll be able to recover from that.”
You’re probably right. I don’t think I should be forgiven, though. I don’t think I deserve that right. I need to learn to live with the knowledge of what I’ve done. I need to turn it into something productive too, I imagine. If one day I can honestly say that I took all the mistakes I made and helped others not make the same, that day I’ll be a happy man.
If you show up on my lawn once again, I will call the Aurors on you.
The shirt falls to the ground.
Then: you sit and stare at the wall.
Hermione nods and takes another drink from her beer.
“I want you,” Draco whispers against the shell of Harry’s ear, fisting rough-pull hands in his hair. And everything inside Harry’s chest melts like wax with the warmth of Draco’s voice, dripping softly behind his ribs and pooling in the pit of his stomach. His vision swims. He’s pinned against a tree, and there is a thigh between his legs, and he’s entirely certain he’ll come without as much as a hand on him.
Edit:
“I’m not gay,” you announce to the eerie stillness of the room.
he thinks and smiles at the man.
“You’re right,” you tell Pansy, wiping your eyes roughly with the back of your hand. “I’ve been too wrapped up in my own head and my own problems to really look at him. I didn’t think it would matter so much, he kept telling me he didn’t love me, and I thought… I guess I thought it was okay, and refused to acknowledge that maybe it wasn’t.”
“I won't,” Harry breathes. “I promise you, I won’t. There is nothing to forgive that hasn’t already been forgiven years ago. Tell me where he is. Let me make this right. Please.”
is the loveliest and she took the time to point out a few mistakes that I had left in this chapter. All remaining typos are strictly my own.
He asks me this less than one week before we’re due to finally end this… arrangement we have. It’s not his first question of the day; I woke up in the morning to a short line on my ankle asking me what my favourite subject in school was.
“I’ve talked with the ghosts,” Draco says as Harry leans against the balustrade next to him. “Mrs Brodard is every bit as awful as Iris said she was, but I don’t think they’ll be a problem. They’re all rather excited to have living people in the house again, and they’re relieved they get to stay.”
By the time Harry reaches the lighthouse, dawn has begun setting fire to the sky in earnest. Warm orange light is pooling in the crevices between the rocks and glittering softly on the crest of every wave. Harry could stay here his entire life, he thinks, stare out at the sea and the light kissing the water softly; he could calcify or solidify or turn to stone entirely. (He could be a part of this scenery, accepted and still, and not a boy standing on the verge of rejection like on the edge of a cliff, ready to jump and afraid of the fall.)
I have taken the liberty of casting that spell for you, Harry. I know I perhaps shouldn’t have. My friends always tell me I meddle too much, but it is my firm belief that no one should spend their life alone and without the light of love to guide them. And especially not you, Harry, not after all you’ve done for us all.
He sighs, tired and weary. “But Draco was my friend,” he adds in a soft voice. “I miss him more than I can say.”
The next morning, Draco’s already spent most of the morning at the house when Harry arrives. There was a meeting with the historical building committee he needed to attend. He presented his plans for the renovation, and some people on the committee brought him archive pictures of how the
“I love you,” I say, and my arm says it with me, with his words and in his precise hand.
You crowd Malfoy, you push him against the wall with violent words sitting on your tongue and fight-tight fists. You know this, you know the contact of your bodies, vicious and shock-sharp. He’ll hit you, you think. He’ll hit you, and you’ll hit back, and the skin over your bones will stain purple-black with his fists. And you crave the pain, oh, you do. You need the shatter-pain contact of his knuckles with the bone of your jaw. You need the blood-crack of split lips and the taste of iron and salt on your incisors. You need to wipe away the sticky salt-red and smile and taunt, your entire body reckless and alive. You need it like a missing limb or a broken tooth.
“Potter,” he said. The tone was cool but his eyes were burning holes into Harry’s skin.
Are you a Muggle-born? I am assuming you are. You seem to be using a pen instead of a quill.
Harry silently sits down next to Draco. Clouds shift and the warm light of sunset floods the room, the sharp lines of mountains cutting through the stream of light like dark knives. The sight of it paints awe all over Draco’s face, his eyes gleaming burn-gold with the warm light as he stares through the window at the scenery.
Harry hasn’t bought a house. He’s bought an abandoned sanatorium at the foot of a Swiss mountain. An abandoned sanatorium that’s both magical in nature and steadfastly refusing to bond with Harry.
Harry’s quiet at first, the swelling waves of anger too far away from the shore to be seen. He sits alone, still and static, though his friends push plates of food his way and let their fingers ghost on his arm. Then: the waves come crashing down. Draco is carefully aligning all his ingredients on his table, organising them by size and colour and potential lethality when Harry throws his cauldron onto the floor (the liquid ripples and rushes across the floor, splashing the dry stone tiles), cheeks stained with tears and voice broken and bruised with anger. Harry’s incandescent as everyone stands very still, and Draco feels his heart light up with the need to reach out somehow (but then: the moment’s gone, and Harry’s friends gather around him, and he is ushered out of the room.)
kisses
Because your life is Ginny and your life is happy and safe, now.
“I’m glad you came back. I’m glad you made good on your promises to fix the place. You really had me worried, you know? What were you thinking, leaving this idiot to mope all alone in the chapel? How on earth did you ever think he was going to do anything useful on his own?” she adds, jutting her head towards Harry.
Harry bought a different kind of paint, then. Bought a primer, too. Painted the walls again, and again, and again, and every single time, the paint slid straight off the walls until Harry was at his wit’s end.
Eyes turned to the heavens above, Harry catches fire all the same. He grips at the trunk with both hands because his legs stop working all of a sudden. The bark scratches dots and lines onto his back as Draco’s tongue traces warm swirls around his left nipple. Everything in Harry’s chest has turned into pure electricity. Raw. Crackling. Harry’s hands fly from the trunk and to the heavy wool of Draco’s robes, pushing it off shoulders and arms until it falls on the leaf-covered ground. Draco’s buttons are smooth and hard. Draco’s flesh is warm and firm, as Harry’s greedy fingers learn every inch of it by heart (and Harry’s greedy tongue, and Harry’s greedy heart.)
“I needed it more than most,” she answers, sitting perfectly still and perfectly straight, brandy held daintily in her right hand. “I don’t need to tell you that, you’ve seen it first hand. And I don’t mean only the time you’ve been here before… I mean Draco too. I’m afraid I wasn’t a very good mother. No—no, don’t protest. It is true. I’ve never learned how to express my feelings and when I married Lucius, I soon realised there was safety in politeness and silence. I taught Draco to do the same. I only ever wanted to protect him, you understand?”
He feels at peace.
thought that my skin was an appropriate canvas for their piss poor threats,” she hisses as she unbuttons her jeans and pushes them down to her ankles. She tramples the fabric furiously until she’s standing in the middle of the living room in her socks and underwear, chin raised in defiance and eyes full of tears. I can make out words wrapping along her left thigh, creeping up, up, up and under the sensible white cotton panties. The skin is violently red around them, I can tell she’s been trying every spell she could to make them go away. I exhale, a long shaky breath.
Are you alright?
he wants to scream. He wants to tear out his hair or crush Draco’s wrists between his fingers or pin him against the wall and kiss him like a wolf bites.
What does it have to do with Jemima Graves and the Unthinkable Affront, you ask? Hush, dear reader. We are getting to it.
THERE ARE WORDS APPEARING ON MY SKIN AND I DON’T KNOW WHY. HELP?
The forest disappears, and the lake, and the sky. And Draco, too, of course, and that’s the worst loss of it all.
(You can’t be gay, because you know, deep down, that behind the masks of the saviour and golden boy, beneath the fragile veneer of glory and fame, under the weight of medals and dress robes—you’re still a freak. And you can’t stand the thought of anyone else knowing it but you.)
There is no sympathy in Iris’ voice, but it is not unkind. She sounds like she’s caught an unruly child or an over-eager dog doing something abominably stupid, and she’s trying to understand how on earth they ever thought that idea was going to work.
But everything in your life has been so wrong for so long, and Draco is making you feel alive with his solid, warm body, with his bone-sharp hips, with the sandpaper-roughness of his stubble on your neck. And Draco is making you feel right, finally, finally. Draco is filling up all the holes inside your chest, is mending all the cracks along your bones, is braiding the torn filaments of your heart back together and you never want it to end, the motion and the friction, the moans and the desperate grasping at each other, not when it feels this good, not when it’s the only thing that’s felt right since the war.
“I’m sorry too,” Harry whispers. “I’m sorry that it ended the first time. I’m sorry that I hurt you. I love you, Draco. I always will. I respect that you need to leave. It’s okay. I wish we had more time, I wish life had been kinder too.”
The first thing Harry registers is the sound of loud sobs, echoing in the empty room. It is the wrong dream, he realises instantly, and it is the wrong boy too. The one that doesn’t call him Harry with a voice that sounds like the warm summer wind, the one that doesn’t hold him or kiss him or want him at all. But the wrong boy is huddled in a corner of the too-white room, and he’s crying, and it’s the only thing Harry can think about.
“I think I still love you, Harry.” Draco’s face is inches away from Harry’s now, and Harry catalogues the soft eyelashes, the alabaster skin and the quicksilver eyes. Everything in that face is beauty and pain all at once, like diving in the arctic ocean or staring at the sun, and Harry knows he loves Draco too. That he has loved him through years and continents and hasn’t ever stopped, not for a single second.
And if I died, who then would tell you about me and your grandad? Oh, your mum may try, but she’ll forget all the important details and it wouldn’t be as good a story as if I told it myself. So settle down, my little love, because this here is the story of how I fell in love with your grandad.
“I’ll make you feel so good, love. Just you wait, darling. Just you wait. I’m going to make you feel so good.”
I don’t notice the writing on my skin at first. There is much to do here. The litter of kneazles Luna brought in last week need to be fed every hour, and I’ve been preparing the Erumpent’s winter feed. By the time I finally see it, others have already started to appear on my skin. I catalogue:
Harry feels a weight next to him on the bed and a warm palm on his hand.
He fell to his knees.
I can’t wait to see you.
He does not find Draco the next day, though he explores the nature reserve that takes up most of the island, walking along lily-covered ponds lined with gnarled pine trees that shield his head from the soft rain and stepping over lichen-covered rock, among wind-swept trees and wild grasses. There is a cave, too, he finds, at the end of a past that twists through tall bushes of Queen Anne’s lace. The whole population of the island hid here once, a sign informs him, and there is a story in the ancient stones: a siege, and a priest, and the birth of a son, legend blurring with truth in every word. He stands in the soft darkness for a while and listens to the echoes of water falling somewhere, treasuring this liminal space he’s carved for himself here, between the not-knowing-yet and the anticipation of what will come next.
(Later, when you grieve for that future in earnest, you’ll realise it never was your happy ending at all, and you’ll bury every last scrap of it in a shallow grave in his memory, and you’ll cover it in daffodils and nostalgia. But it is not later, not yet, and you’re leaning against the cool wood of the door and choking back sobs, and you still believe you want it in earnest.)
Harry didn’t realise how much it hurt him, at first, as he loved Draco through sleepless nights and cold shoulders. He told himself it didn’t matter if Draco never said
“Oh, don’t worry, Potter. I’m not here for love. There’s nothing but sex between us. Absolutely nothing but sex.”
Harry slams the door behind him as he exits the room.
Draco turns around, and the world stops.
There is an instant of blinding brightness, and Harry feels like he’s grown another pair of lungs suddenly. He can feel the house breathe underneath his skin. He can feel the loneliness of it, the slow decay—and the hope for a better future too, shining warm and bright behind his ribs.
