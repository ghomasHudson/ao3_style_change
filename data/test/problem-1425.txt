“Are you doing necromancy?” he asked, and Draco laughed against his lips, stroked fondly through Harry’s curls, tugged at a tangled handful.
And of course it was his father, Harry thought. Lucius Malfoy, off in Azkaban, no one ever mentioning him except Draco calling out for him in his nightmares, the same every time, a murmured frantic litany of “Father!”, and “please.” And then Lucius prison-sick, disdainful and distant even as he watched his son so hungrily on that last, awful visit. And at the very end, in St Mungo’s, an inconveniently early death, slipping away quietly while holding Draco’s hand, just enough tenderness left in him to make sure that Draco would miss him forever, and would be eaten up with guilt.
Harry knows he can’t be dreaming because he knows his own brain could never recreate Sirius so accurately, so cruelly. Nearly all the lights are off, and Harry tries to cast a Lumos, but he must have left his wand somewhere, and then Malfoy is beside him, sleek as a seal in his best travelling cloak, eyeing Sirius warily. Malfoy never drinks, doesn’t trust the letting go.
They had the fucker who had cast the curse, at least. But he wasn’t talking, and Harry hadn’t recognised the words nor the wand movement, so Harry knew that the Healers would have to take Draco away eventually, so they could work out exactly what had killed him.
“It’s all I ever think about,” Malfoy said, voice warm and amused and very close to Harry’s ear, and Harry remembered with a flash of heat some sort of guitar player dream-Malfoy, sinuous in leather trousers, groaning in dream-Harry’s ear, “You’re all I ever think about.”
Gloriana, Draco thought. He wondered if they’d get on, if she’d be magnificent like Harry. The Woman Who Lived, they could call her.
They don’t say goodbye to anyone, but Dudley nods at them across the room as they leave, and at least his girlfriend seems nice, Harry thinks. On their way out, they stop to collect their coats, Draco passing the baby to Harry, Ron lugging the changing bag, Hermione and Ginny and Pansy grinning, slightly tipsy from the cheap wine.
After a while, Harry stopped minding. He hardly saw Malfoy at work, even though technically they were on the same floor, because they were always on different jobs. And dream-Malfoy was fine, actually. Dream-Harry was certainly fond of him; they were always friends in Harry’s dreams, in a way real-Harry and real-Malfoy never had been, and really there were only so many nights Harry could spend dreaming about Malfoy being nice to him before he stopped hating the thought of him (the real him).
Malfoy's hands dropped to his sides and he shut his eyes as though he was in pain, which maybe he was. This war was hard on the body. Just in case, Harry took his time undressing him, hands sure and careful over all the buckles and straps, fingers easily teasing out the brass buttons that this dream-Harry had been the one to polish. He pushed the jacket off dream-Malfoy's shoulders, tugged off his vest until finally dream-Malfoy was pale and naked in the candlelight. None of the dream-Malfoys had real-Malfoy's scars, but this one had some that were all his own, puckered and angry like an inferno of damage across his chest. He hissed when Harry put a hand on him, but pressed eagerly into the touch nonetheless, and then he started to take Harry's clothes off too, fumbling with all the buttons but no less gentle than Harry had been.
“I suppose my stone was an off-cut of the original,” Harry says, already moving into an almost-dream, the shadows of the Forbidden Forest moving sinuously across the ceiling of the room. “I wonder why they buried the wand with her, though. It’s so…”
“Are you nearly there?” Draco asked, and Harry nodded, hips pressing upwards faster, one hand dropping to the base of Draco’s spine, and then lower, touching the stretched skin where they were joined.
“They’re all going to know what we were doing,” Draco said absent-mindedly, pressing at a bruise on Harry’s throat.
He hadn’t been sure that he would ever tell Malfoy, first because it was about the Hallows and he would never have imagined trusting Malfoy enough to tell him. But also because he didn’t
to know, either. Before the whole thing happened, Harry would never have imagined losing Draco, not when they were both still so young. Draco always seemed so alive, brimming with a gleeful sort of energy, and it had always made Harry feel hot-blooded and taken over by him. He felt like Draco couldn’t possibly be gone, not really.
He didn’t go over that night, though, because when Seamus finally gave the dog back to Malfoy, it curled right into Malfoy’s chest in a tight circle of limbs and then seemed to fall asleep. Malfoy carefully buttoned his jacket up over it again and got up to leave, his arm a careful cradle around the misshapen lump. But the following Sunday Harry was walking through Victoria Embankment Gardens, clutching a bottle of some cheapo fizzy white wine that was sweating gently in its paper bag, when he saw Malfoy sitting on the grass, all by himself, except for the dog of course.
. The kiss was almost absent-minded, though he had to strain to drop his mouth onto that pale secret nook of skin at the back of Draco’s knee, but Draco had shivered at the touch.
When they arrived at Privet Drive, they all stood at the door for a few moments, momentum lost, before Harry shrugged and stepped forward to ring the doorbell.
“Christ,” Harry said, and he dropped into a pew that had been shoved back against a column. “Thank fuck for that. We stand a fighting chance, then, especially if he’ll instruct the armed forces in our favour. Did Fred and George manage to sit down with the defence secretary yet?”
“Is that hair on her shoulders?” Draco says, sounding a bit hysterical, leaning closer, running a finger reverently across the sloping slack line of her arm.
“They’re teal,” Draco hisses, “and I got them in the big M&S in Hackney, now can we stop talking about them?”
He wakes silently, thankfully, but through the wall he can hear the quiet wakefulness of someone moving around in Hermione’s bedroom, and he thinks of her with an open suitcase on the bed, and how easily her dream body moved towards the door. When Malfoy stirs beside him, murmuring something incomprehensible into the pillow, Harry curls around him, waiting for morning.
“I doubt it,” Malfoy said, yawning right in Harry’s face, only partly from real exhaustion after a long week of potions raids. Even six months before it would have made Harry want to punch him right in his stupid open mouth, but they were friends now in that intense way that Aurors often were, after dismal months of forced proximity and dull assignments and partnerships that didn’t seem to make sense at first, until they did. And now, because they were friends, seeing Malfoy yawning just made Harry want to wrap him in a blanket and cook him a nice dinner. Which was, funnily enough, what the most recent dream-Harry had been doing for his dream-Malfoy for weeks now, because the dreams were as vivid as ever and they were no less frequent.
was. He knew he’d be just as sure there that Harry would come and get him, make him new. But that was the thing about Harry, of course; loving him was always going to be an unmaking of a kind. Not even a little death would ever change that.
“I could kill them,” he said quietly when Harry came up behind him, hooked his chin over Draco’s shoulder so he could look into the dark space under the stairs. He felt okay about it, with Draco’s body between him and the cupboard.
That night Harry has the worst dream of them all. Not a ghost this time, so at least he knows he’s dreaming right from the start. He’s walking the hallway in Grimmauld like he always does in dreams, but he’s in Hermione’s skin. He can see the familiar shape of her as he passes the big mirror at the bottom of the stairs, possessed by self-possession. He knows if he opens his mouth it’s her voice that will come out, but that’s not what makes him wake, shivering with a cold sweat. It’s just that in the dream he’s making his way to the front door, through endless dream corridors, never looking back.
He’s still holding Malfoy’s arm, which is blissfully warm and solid under his fingers, and Malfoy looks at him like something has shifted, gone awry, and then licks his lips. He’s blushing.
“It’s important that I’m ready to greet them when they arrive.” Dream-Malfoy ran his thumb consideringly over the slopes of Harry’s knuckles. “My father…”
He was still good at that, being impossibly posh and commanding, Harry thought dimly, looking up at Petunia from the front step. She was so tall. And then she stepped to the side, leaning back against the wall as though she was very tired, and Draco steered Harry past her so fast that it was over before he even had to think about it, and he could breathe again.
Harry didn’t remember much from the funerals after the Battle, but he dimly remembered the wailing, though he hadn’t known it was part of the ritual until Narcissa crooked a finger at an old witch in a hooded cloak, and the woman started shrieking. Beside him, Hermione murmured, “How ghastly,” in a fascinated voice, and then looked guiltily down at her hands.
Harry wonders if everyone who’s been through a war feels constantly surprised by joy like he is, and before he can do much more than hug Ron back the bells start to ring, echoing back through the crescent of the cliffs, and they file out of the church in a crush of lavender and warm bodies, and Harry has Ron ahead of him and Malfoy behind him and the sky is still the same hectic unblemished blue of Ron’s eyes.
“I’d hoped,” is what he actually says, going over to stand behind Draco at the window, sliding an anchoring arm around his stomach, pressing his face gently against the back of Draco’s bowed neck, “that you might decide to stay for good,” and Draco doesn’t answer but turns and kisses him.
“It’s pretty simple really,” he tells Teddy, because despite all his show of reluctance, Teddy is a bright kid, and also he’s part of Draco’s family even if they don’t really talk about it.
“The question isn’t what they did to me, it’s if what they did to me was worth it,” Draco tells him, and “Ask me later,” he says, before he kisses Harry back hard and splits his own lip open again against Harry’s teeth.
“You’re a show-off.” And that was all real-Harry, though he sounded soft and admiring, and he stepped closer, nudged at the thin curl of hammered wire, tugged at Malfoy’s earlobe. “They’ll eat you up, Draco.”
Once the Floo is connected, Draco stays over quite a bit, and he often goes swimming in the morning, a towel rolled loosely under his arm and one of Harry’s Weasley jumpers over his shorts. Harry goes along too sometimes, in the summer, but Draco swims all year round, and when he comes back his skin is pink and raw from the cold water, and Harry can taste the salt on his skin. He says he doesn’t feel the cold because of growing up in the Manor, where everyone wore two jumpers and extra socks from October to April, because sometimes it was colder inside than out, but when he talks about it he shivers, so Harry runs a bath for him and rinses the seawater out of his long hair until he warms up again.
“Speaking of forever,” he says, and then he rolls back under Draco just in time to catch him when he drops loose and satiated, shaking with release. Harry has one arm around Draco’s neck, and he’s very pink and pleased-looking, and when Draco stretches out beside him and presses along his side, his arm tightens.
"Draco," he said, and his voice was too loud in the small confines of the tent, and Malfoy's eyes flickered sideways towards the opening in the canvas, but Harry had tied it shut after him, and anyway there was no one outside to hear. But he dropped his voice anyway, and it was almost a whisper when he looked Malfoy in the eye and murmured, "Sir."
Harry sighs, yawns, reaches half-heartedly for Draco, who bats him away and kneels up, already so close that his own hand is enough, feeling the preemptive shiver of exhaustion under the building tension of pleasure that means he’ll be able to sleep, soon.
It was a shock to realise that he could still hurt Harry, even after everything. Draco had thought he was so
Neville was already at the tv cabinet, rifling through the drawers, casting detection spells. Behind him, Luna was methodically patting down all the couch cushions. The tinny blare of the television was unceasing, figures in lycra moving in sync.
too tired. I can hardly move.” But even as he says it he drops his mouth to Draco’s cheek, kisses him sweetly, and his hand is a hot greedy clasp around Draco’s throat. He squeezes, barely a flex of the fingers before he releases again, but it leaves Draco panting.
The ring is slim, a pale clear gold, engraved with Tudor roses, and when Draco lifts it out of the box it’s already skinwarm. It should probably be in a museum, he thinks.
Paz tries to cut in, but Harry just clings tighter to Draco, and they allow themselves to be swept around the dancefloor in the throng. The singer in the band dips the microphone low,
“I would hate you in any universe, in any lifetime,” he said cheerfully, and Harry would have lost his temper at that, before, but now he noticed the slow pinkening at the base of Malfoy’s throat, and the twitch of his fingers around the mug, and he thought about the latest dream-Malfoy—swaying opposite Harry on some anonymous crowded subway carriage in some anonymous crowded city, with his head shaved to a velvet sheen, his smiling mouth a careful lipsticked red—and Harry wondered.
Harry didn’t remember ever wanting someone more—there was a confidence to knowing Malfoy so intimately (the wet velvety inside of his mouth, the soft resistance of fucking into him, the look on his face when he came), and Harry was absolutely mad for him in a way he hadn’t expected.  He wasn’t any of the dream-Malfoys, but then Harry wasn’t dream-Harry either, and maybe what they had between them was nothing, but nothing was more than enough for Harry. And then they stopped it all, whatever
“Maybe next time,” Harry said, and kissed him. “Maybe next time I’ll let you go on a murderous rampage.”
Harry told him—told him the thing that hadn’t told anyone else yet—and held his breath with the magnitude of it.
“Cunetio,” Harry replied, testing the name on his tongue, and Malfoy looked at him sharply, though without surprise.
“You’re edible,” Harry tells him as they dance. “You look like dessert.” And he does, sugared almonds and pistachios and set cream, and he tells Harry to fuck off in a pleased voice, and his mouth under Harry’s tastes rich and fruity from the toasting port. Seamus barrels between them mid-kiss, tie wrapped around his head, shirt translucent with sweat, bellowing
The sky is swollen with unshed snow, and Draco’s forgotten his gloves, and Marie is looking a bit tired after the walk to the top of Parliament Hill, and that’s
“I wanted them to feel at home.” He turned, finally, to face Harry, and his eyes were bright with amusement. “Look.” And he shook his curls back so Harry could see the gold loop through his ear, that stupid Roman affectation that on anyone else Harry would have hated.
“I’m into it, Draco. I am very, very into it. But we’re both exhausted. And you don’t have to punish yourself all the fucking time. It doesn’t always have to be… intense, you know? We can just go to sleep, and when we wake up we can fuck then, and it’ll be just as good in the morning.”
Harry moves away from him, just a little bit closer to the other side of their big bed, though he turns on the pillow so he’s watching Draco. His glasses are off, and in the strange spill of winter moonlight, across the stretch of white linen, he’s washed out and colourless, nothing like himself. His mouth is a petulant curl.
“Well,” Teddy says impatiently, “when you and Harry have kids—” He looks down at the ground, and his face is blotchy.
Sirius laughs, puts a steadying hand on the wall, the row of house-elf heads staring sightlessly down at him, grotesque. Why haven’t they taken them down yet, Harry wonders.
“Well,” Draco said firmly, “we like having you around too, and they had their chance when they were still, you know. Alive. Their time is literally past.”
“You should eat,” Harry tells him. “We need to finish it today, if we can. I can already feel—” He pushes away the plate, tightens his grip on the holdall, swallows sickly around the same old feeling from the Forest of Dean; the desperate reek of old canvas, damp undergrowth, cold beans again, Ron slipping away in the night, and nothing but rage left behind.
And Harry was fully naked all of a sudden, and Draco stood up to take his own jeans off. He had got as far as unbuttoning them, when he looked at Harry very seriously and said, “Wait.” And Harry did wait, just rolled over onto his side and propped himself up on Draco’s pillow and watched as Draco eased his rings off—the heavy silver signet that used to have the Malfoy crest on it but was now blank, and the small twisted gold wire one that Draco flicked at unconsciously when he was nervous, and the slightly lumpy one that Draco had made himself at a silversmithing class in the local adult education centre that he took because he was bored one winter—and placed them on the bedside cabinet. Each one made a low dense thump as he put it down. The room was very quiet, and Draco took his time, and he watched Harry the whole time as he slid the rings off ever so slowly. And Harry watched as each finger was revealed, and then he thought about what Draco was going to do with those fingers now the rings were off, and he had to hide his face in the pillow for a minute as Draco laughed quietly at him from the edge of the bed.
“I suppose I always thought I’d bring you to Paris.” Draco hefts the bag in his left hand, the Mark on that arm still raised and ugly. “Not for grave-robbing though.” And he strides off in the direction of the Gare du Nord, and Harry sees him backlit by passing car headlights, a beacon, before hurrying after him and taking the bag back.
“No, I like them,” Harry says, and he has to clear his throat. He touches the straining fabric lightly, watches in fascination as a small wet patch forms under his fingers. “They’re bright. Looks nice.”
His hands were inside Draco’s open shirt now, thumb pressing a nipple to an insistent point, and Draco pushed Harry’s jumper up so he could get at the buttons of his jeans.
“It’s not about today,” Harry says. “I just miss you, that’s all.” Behind them, Betsy starts to cry properly, in protest at the sudden stillness when Draco turns the engine off. “It feels like she’s so important to you.” And he stops there, appalled at himself and what he might say if he keeps going.
Malfoy to think that this was some sort of destiny, some fated path for them to tread. Because it wasn’t, of course. Not really.
Dream-Malfoy pulled back, confused, but he was still touching Harry, one hand deep in the curls at the base of Harry’s skull, the anchoring pull of his hand strangely familiar. Dream-Harry, the Harry who seemed to know what this was, tried to chase the kiss, but real-Harry managed to stop himself.
Malfoy’s shoulders stiffened, but his face was a pleasant blank when he turned to Harry (carefully cultivated, Harry was sure. Malfoy had never been able to moderate himself around Harry before. And of course dream-Malfoy never had to try. Harry had forgotten that).
“I got you this,” he says, and places a small box on his own bare stomach. It sits there incongruously, right on the softest part of Harry, covered in slightly threadbare velvet with a tiny jewelled button at the front—antique, obviously, Draco doesn’t even need to ask. It shifts slightly with every softening breath that Harry takes.
They were right next to one of the big flower beds, and the dog was leaping in and out of some phlox, sending dusty puffs of dry mud into the air with each thump of its little paws. Malfoy was trying to hold the lead and eat sushi out of a takeaway box at the same time, which didn’t seem to be going too well for him, but from the way he was looking at the dog Harry thought he probably didn’t mind.
And just like that, Harry was back in the drawing room, gripping the flannel with one hand and Draco’s ankle with the other, and Draco’s feet were clean and damp, and the first, worst bit was over.
He’s massive, the werewolf is, even though it’s another week until the full moon, and Draco has dropped the crossbow somewhere; he doesn’t even have his wand out. Harry starts moving, but then Draco ducks smooth as liquid, sliding under the vicious arc of the pool cue, and he kicks the werewolf hard in the balls and stamps on his face when he goes down groaning.
But Draco is easy to see where he sits at the bar, his hair the brightest spot in the place, and Harry fixes his sight on the defeated drooping snowdrop curve of Draco's neck as he works his way through the crowd.
“Someday,” Harry murmured, “you’re going to want to hear about this.” But Malfoy—real, solid Malfoy, standing right there with Harry in the tiny Ministry kitchenette—just smiled and went digging in the fridge for some milk.
“Fuck you,” Draco says tiredly, and then shakes his head, presses the heels of his hands into his eyes. “This is just the Horcrux talking, you know. The sooner we get rid of it…”
, Harry lying on the couch trying to get comfortable around his huge stomach so he could nap, feeling like his whole body was swollen and unfamiliar, and Draco’s light reassuring touch on his forehead sending him safely to sleep. “I thought I was so lucky.”
“They didn’t want me to leave,” Harry said, and closed his empty hand into a tight fist, though not before the tremble took root. “They like having me around.”
“Seamus’s dad is a greyhound trainer and Seamus has two massive rescue greyhounds living in his flat in Shoreditch,” Malfoy said primly. “Seamus is great with dogs. But Peggy is very nervous, especially of men. She’s had a tough time of it. So you have to be careful with her.”
Cynthia is a Muggle, but Harry wonders if her words are just another one of those signs he always seems to be seeing, because less than a month later Harry is in St Mungo’s feeling absolutely grotty, scarcely able to smell food let alone keep it down, and so grimly exhausted that just waking in the morning makes him feel like crying.
Together they drank the spiced wine, sipping one after the other from the same glass; they poured more firewhiskey into the fire, making it roar; then Draco pressed the point of the knife into the thinnest part of his own palm, and Harry’s, hard enough, just about, to break the skin.
Luna was the only one of them who still looked unperturbed. Rather, she looked steely—strong, unmovable—as she stood with hands on hips and stared at the body.
When Malfoy kisses him, Harry wonders for a horrible second if this is just another dream. It wouldn't be the first time, after all; Harry’s subconscious conjuring up Malfoy, long-haired and smiling as he pushes Harry up against the wall, one careless hand at Harry’s throat, the other in his hair; or Malfoy pinked up from bed-heat and rumpled from sleep, moving slowly over Harry in a bed that’s too comfortable to be a Grimmauld bed and too big to be anything but a dream bed.
“Have you heard of the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics?” Harry asked Malfoy cheerfully as he finished filling his cup and nudged the kettle handle around to Malfoy, and then smiled to himself as Malfoy started to laugh.
“Look what I found,” he says fondly. “Dumped on Archway Bridge, can you imagine? They like your desk, Potter.”
that Draco's had to glamour away the lines of tension around his eyes for tonight. Harry wonders what it’s all for. No one in the Ministry believed Narcissa when she told them at the trials, and they still don’t believe her son, no matter how many hands he shakes or how sweetly he tries to convince them.
Malfoy made a pleased sound in his throat, and then his arms were going around Harry’s neck, and Harry was clutching at the small of his back, fingers whispering over the cool landscape of the linen and down to grasp the hem of Malfoy’s toga in his greedy fist.
“Why didn’t you get that healed?” he asked brusquely, then worried for a moment that he’d shattered the fragile peace. But then Draco had sighed and said, “I didn’t want to be late to the party,” and dropped his hand with a grimace before walking away, and Harry had stared at his back with a sort of uneasy curiosity and thought,
home, Harry is so full of a strange new feeling of having something all of his own. Months later, Harry—vaguely horrified at himself—remembers that feeling, and wonders if he had made it all happen. If he had somehow
Draco smirks at him infuriatingly, and Harry lazily pokes him in the ribs with his foot, and then Draco continues, sounding totally unperturbed, “When I first started going to church, Easter used to remind me of
Draco lifts his hands off the bar, turns them over so Harry can see the shake in them, curse tremors rippling from fingertips through to the flexing tendons of his tender, pale inner wrists.
“I can’t believe it’s this easy,” Draco whispers as they stand shoulder to shoulder, looking at the monument, but Harry can
So it was almost unbearable when Luna said quietly, “You’re doing great,” and Harry blinked back into the room, and was assaulted anew by the endless stillness of Draco’s fingers, and he squeezed them gently (probably for the last time) and then put Draco’s hand down.
at Malfoy’s shoulder, but Malfoy murmured something about how he should leave it unless he was prepared to redrape it, and anyway Harry found he could get at almost all of Malfoy’s skin by going in from the hem up, and when the dream started to fade, Harry woke with the memory of Malfoy’s ribcage shuddering beneath his fingers. But this time, real-Malfoy was next to him, sprawled in sleep halfway across the old carved tester bed in his old room in Malfoy Manor, and Harry could touch for real.
And Friday night had been brilliant, and awful, like it always was with Malfoy. And then Harry had Saturday night alone, and spent all of it waking, shivery and unsatisfied, from dreams of Malfoy—all variations on the same dream, over and over and over, dream-Malfoy on his haunches in a shallow stream, nose red and peeling, a wide-brimmed hat jammed on his head, the rough cotton of his shirt dark with sweat. He was laughing up at dream-Harry, and in his hands he held a large flat gravel-filled pan which he was swishing through the water. Harry thought if he had to watch Malfoy’s smile begin one more time he might go mad, and he couldn’t imagine why Malfoy was even in his head at all. He certainly thought he’d fucked Malfoy out of his system fairly efficiently the night before. But Harry knew that the dreams didn’t ever go away for good.
“You have it,” Draco said, stuffing half the shortbread into his mouth. “This one is fine.” His voice was muffled by biscuit, but his eyes were still sharp when he looked at Harry. He swallowed hard, and then said, “You’re allowed to have it, Harry.”
“Henri,” Malfoy said, and the concerned little crease between his eyes deepened as he looked down at Harry. “Myne owne hertis rote,” Malfoy said quietly, and real-Harry didn’t know how he understood, but he did—and in that one suspended dream moment, he was so glad to be able to understand, and he wanted Malfoy to say it all again, so badly—and he smiled at Malfoy, almost unable to help himself, real-Harry dimly horrified at himself for it but dream-Harry just allowing himself to do it, and enjoying it.
The trenches were so hot and dirty, and real-Harry could feel in the itch of his skin that dream-Harry hadn't been properly clean in a long time, but it didn't seem to matter much when he and dream-Malfoy were both naked and lying on one of the scratchy army-issue blankets on the tent floor. They had to be very quiet, and it was so hard, because Harry wanted Malfoy to talk to him while they touched each other (like real-Malfoy did in Harry's real life, spilling everything he felt breathlessly into Harry's ear, mouth wet and hot and wanting). But dream-Malfoy was so quiet even at the end, when he just gasped silently and arched upwards, coming over Harry's hand, and Harry kept his own face buried in the pale curve of dream-Malfoy's neck to muffle his own sounds.
“I’ll get it,” he spat, casting a vicious glance at Hermione, who only sighed again. Harry wished they wouldn’t fight so much, knew they probably always would.
“No, no, don’t be silly,” Draco says. “That’s my father. If anything, I’m a dragon prince?” He tries for arch, wondering whether it’ll land. There’s no telling with Teddy these days, who’s in his second year at Hogwarts and seems to find everything and everyone tiresome, and who keeps his hair black most of the time. But he’s inspecting the sword with interest (and that had been fun for Draco, carrying it on his back on the Tube hidden by one of Harry’s epic cloaking spells). Draco thinks there might be a small smile on Teddy’s face, and his hair is flickering at the ends, whispers of neon sizzling through the strands, a sure sign that he’s forgetting to think about himself for a minute.
“Right,” Draco says. “I see.” He wriggles a bit under Harry, just gently, watching Harry as he does it. “Would you ever think about… so
He slid his hands around her flanks possessively, stroking her into sleekness. Her eyes rolled in delight before she flopped full-bellied onto Malfoy’s thighs. Harry chanced a rub behind her wonky ears, which she tolerated, eyes sliding shut. Around the muscular span of her neck, Malfoy’s fingers met Harry’s, stayed there.
“I wasn’t going to tell you,” Draco said, placing the knife carefully on the garden table. “But it had to be tonight. I just thought… my father, you know.”
The baby is solid and plump and very much herself. She doesn’t have the Potter nose or the Malfoy hair, or Lily’s eyes or Narcissa’s pointy chin; she’s cheerful and brown-eyed and content, and though they had talked about all the flower names and all the star names, and names of all the people they had lost, and names of people they wanted to remember, in the end they call her Elizabeth, simply because they both like it and it doesn’t remind them of anyone except her.
smile, even if it’s on that stupid borrowed face. “Thank you,” he mouths at Harry, though Harry’s not sure what he’s done to be thankful for, and then Draco twists and lunges upright and makes a break for the edge of the wards.
and Draco was under him, this time in Harry’s bed, his ankle resting on Harry’s shoulder. He was wearing all his rings that time, and they caught the moonlight where his fingers were tensing and releasing in the sheets. Harry was still over him—in him—aching to move, but waiting for that curious flood of fullness in his chest to pass, the one that caught him off-guard so often and left him undefended against that careful, wanting look in Draco’s eyes.
“You haven’t changed your mind?” Harry asks, too quickly, but Draco shakes his head, and that’s that.
Malfoy told him then, about the new job at the DMLE. About how he’d be reporting to Robards, same as Harry; working out of Level Two, same as Harry. It was why he’d come back to London, it turned out, not that he had said that to Harry all those months ago in the toilet cubicle, when he was fumbling with the buttons of Harry’s jeans and muttering expletives against Harry’s lips. Or any time since, for that matter.
They spend so long thinking about names that they almost forget that at the end of it all, there’s going to be an actual real baby, and in any case they can’t agree so they just decide to just leave it until afterwards. Harry is too tired to argue about it, and it’s easier not to discuss it, because whenever Draco talks about the baby he gets tense. Harry isn’t sure what he’s worried about—after all, it’s not as if he’s the only one who grew up without a good role model for fatherhood. They’re both going to be figuring this stuff out anew, together. Because even though Harry wants this—his own family, finally—more than he thinks is normal, he doesn’t know how to
“I don’t like it any more than you do!” Draco wishes he sounded less defensive, but he’s exhausted after a long day of trying to be friends with various Weasleys, and he doesn’t have the energy. His eyes feel scratchy, his body strung tight with the strain of the day, quivering with tiredness. He’s too tired to sleep.
“I don’t even know if it’s here,” Harry said, as though he hadn’t told them that over and over. “You saw her—she hates us, and she hated my mum. Why would she keep any of her stuff?”
“I do,” Harry says, strokes up the sweep of Draco’s inner arm and then down again. He wants to follow the path of his fingers with his mouth, wonders if he’ll ever get enough. “I really hate it. Not you, though. I the-opposite-of-hate you.”
“Placet,” Malfoy answered, because of course he knew Latin, like the entitled prick he was, and he was standing quietly with the sun in his eyes and his hand cupping the base of Harry’s skull, and he was smiling.
real, he has to be. He’s in the corridor outside Harry’s room and his hair has the dull petroleum sheen of a night of running with wolves, and all his aristocratic bones are just a little too close to the surface of his skin. Every step is a sway, a concentrated roll from heel to toe, firewhiskey-graceful.
“I’ve broken the circle now,” Draco told him in a dissatisfied tone, and flicked a chicken drumstick lazily into the bonfire. “But it’s just that, tonight, the veil is so thin.” He didn’t need to finish speaking, just gestured in the air, the restless flutter of his hand somehow capturing the whisper of gauze, something filmy and ephemeral, and then he made a twisting motion with the knife, a flick upwards through the air, a brutal cut. Harry shivered.
“Is all of this your doing?” Harry asks, gesturing surreptitiously at their friends, who are bright and vivid against the backdrop of the horrible beige sitting room, with the couches that Harry was never allowed to sit on, and the big tv in the corner, now silent, and the wall of family photos that Harry isn’t in.
He doesn’t know how to finish the sentence, doesn’t know if he wants to try, but he thinks about Andrew—not Reverend Andrew, chilly and distant and regal up in the pulpit, but Andrew as he might be if he was allowed to show how he feels, about that sweet, rare smile of his, his big hands, the strong curve of his shoulders under his black cope.
“We’ll see their dust long before they arrive,” dream-Harry went on. “You might as well come and eat.”
Draco didn’t even have his wand out, which meant it couldn’t be a proper spell, but the liquid in the cauldron surged to a boil then settled, clarified.
Dream-Malfoy had looked at him with the same dismissive sideways glance that real-Malfoy had given him so many times, only in the dream, Malfoy’s eyes were soft and confused. He had no wand in the dreams either, Harry realised, though he did have a big fuck-off longsword that he was wielding with two hands.
and Harry was twenty-two, and feeling a bit less miserable, and he was sitting by the Lake with Hogwarts behind him and the shimmer of a Warming Charm around him. Draco was skimming stones.
“Men?” Harry asks, thinks about Ron’s generous mouth, the span of his shoulders, the self-conscious flex of bare bicep, those big hands. “He’s relaxed about that stuff. Not
“But,” Draco said quietly, “if you like, I can mind it for you. And you can have it at home with a cup of tea.”
“You’re really jealous?” Draco asks, and Harry pulls him up to sitting too, and eases his t-shirt over his head, shivering a little at the sight of all that skin being uncovered.
Harry sighed heavily. “We’ll have to have guidelines. A contract, even. That’s the next thing we have to hammer out, make sure everyone’s on the same page before we… you know… resurrect anyone. More meetings.” He dropped his face into his hands, bared the defeated-looking curve of the back of his neck. Draco put a hand over it, palm cupped around the notches of Harry’s spine. The skin there was chilly. Harry had always been so warm, before. “Means I’ll have to go back there again, I think.”
"Potter," dream-Malfoy said, "you know I'm not very brave. But I would die myself, and gladly so, if it meant that I didn't have to send my men out into that tomorrow."
“I think you should go out with me,” Harry said. Which. Well, it wasn’t exactly what he had come up there to say, with the storming and the brandishing of the teacup and all of that, but all Harry could think of was all the dream-Malfoys—the kissing one, and the one who looked like he very much might have just got off a horse before the dream started, and the one who Harry had met in some wild dream woods who had an
“You should see the other guy?” he says, but trying to talk makes him wince, and he looks horribly sad—sick and hunted and despairing. Harry could have told him that these tips are hardly ever worth anything. They’re usually from people asking for trouble, and judging by the state of his face, Draco had walked straight into the middle of that.
Harry would come. He was late, later than he remembered, but he’d come. He cared. And he was so good at saving him. He wouldn’t miss this opportunity.
‘Labellum terrae!’ he screamed across the field, the only thing he could think of that would stop him, thrown with more power than he’d put behind it before he wasn’t expecting the effect it had.
Voldemort continued to move around the room, almost circling Severus, waiting to attack his prey like a shark, or a vulture. When he spoke again it was in the same measured voice. From Severus’ flinch there was far more to it than that.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione ran forward to help: Jets of light flew in every direction and the man duelling Percy backed off. His hood slipped and they saw a high forehead and streaked hair –
‘What’s wrong with that?’ If Harry hadn’t been stuck so far in defensive mode, he would have picked up on the meaning behind that comment earlier, at least that’s what he told himself afterwards.
‘Well, it’s the bloody Room of Requirement isn’t it? Surely you could give me something more than four ashy walls?’ He gestured around him, sweeping a ghostly hand against the wall and examining his fingers with disdain.
He stood up straight, pacing the carpet of the room in long, confident strides and timed his breathing with that. It was five steps, five second.
Percy and Ron dropped to Fred’s side, clinging to him though he was the least injured of the lot of them. It really helped to have a human shield in these moments. He ignored Harry’s eyes on him, he didn’t have time. There was one life left. He couldn’t save Vince for himself but there was no way he was going to let Severus slip through his fingers. He had to get there before Voldemort, before Harry, before that fucking giant snake.
Draco turned to stare at him and Harry shifted to glare back, daring him to argue. Obviously, Draco still managed. Arguing was one of the few things he could still do.
He sat down at the Gryffindor table, eyes no longer searching out the silver pair across the hall. He knew where they were, he’d seek them out as soon as the others were asleep. Hermione thought this meant he was getting better. Finally over his obsession and his guilt.
‘I wouldn’t have flown back if I’d known.’ This time it was Harry’s turn to look away beneath the gaze of the other. ‘I only went back because it was you.’ He hoped there would be no further questions, he wasn’t sure how to answer anything that followed on from that.
He gagged over the toilet bowl, coughing up bile from the bottom of his stomach. Whether that was the baby or just his horror at the situation was anyone’s guess.
‘I’ve been sleeping more and more when you’re not here. But- well- it’s not like sleep. Not really. It’s kind of waiting. Or … moving. Closer and closer to … not here.’ His voice was less steady than before, it had a more Luna Lovegood vibe to it.
He heard the thump of something falling through the hole in the side of the building. It sounded suspiciously like a body but he couldn’t stomach that thought. Curses began flying over their heads and Draco ducked as he kept moving. He had to get out of here.
He spun and practically launched himself on his friend, ignoring the thick arms trying to shove him off. He was alive! Of course, he was … that meant today really was … the day …
‘Sorry Draco, quick summary. The war is over, has been for years. Voldemort lost.’ He yawned through the salient plot points that had controlled Draco’s life. ‘We’re married. You’re just, kind of, visiting the future briefly. Sorry hun’, you’ll just have to cope for a while. ‘kay?’
‘We’ve talked enough, Harry.’ He laughed, closing the distance between them, arms – solid, warm arms – wrapped around Harry’s waist, pulling him against him and back into the heated kiss.
As Severus’ eyes settled back on Voldemort his face was set in a waxy-ashen white. He knew. There was no question of how this was going to play out. He tried one last time, but his eyes were blank, there was no hope, he was just going through the motions he thought were required before death.
‘We're gonna be rewarded,’ or maybe they would, Vince’s voice cut through his thoughts, he sounded so excited, so proud of following the orders of a mad man.  ‘We 'ung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to 'im.’
The castle shook as spells pounded against the defences. A great cavalcade of transparent figures galloped past on horses, their heads screaming with bloodlust under their arms. Harry staggered to his feet when the Headless Hunt had passed and looked around; he was taking in the mess of the battle still raging. The battle he was at the centre of but never quite a part of. They could hear screams from where they were, but it was hard to tell where or who they might be coming from. Harry looked panicked.
*Full line breaks mean changing from past/future to present/past (makes sense to me, yay time travel!)
‘What the fuck are you doing here.’ He hissed when they were close enough, glaring the twins down, glancing quickly around the room to try to find out who was here to pick him up.
Of course, the battle didn’t start through the day. He had hours of walking through Hogwarts, pretending that everything was normal. He managed to get his hands on a pensieve and studied the memories of the day. The things he had to make sure played out the same in order to let Harry win the war. The things he knew about people’s deaths in order to try to stop them. He catalogued all he could, waiting for the battle to being and the end of this stalemate that no one else knew was coming. He was fidgeting and restless all day, ignoring the looks he got from his friends until they were all swept into the Great Hall. Ready for the Battle of Hogwarts to begin.
He quickly got changed, surprised at how natural it felt to still pull on his uniform, working his way around the boys’ bathroom to get ready for the day as quickly as he could. He paused about to slick gel through his hair. Harry preferred it without it, he’d grown it out a little so it wouldn’t really suit anyway.
The instructions had finally come, he even had someone out there waiting to take him home. At least that’s what the note said, crumpled in the Auror’s fat fist the second he’d finished reading it out loud to him.
He thought of the Room of Lost Things, but there was nothing from that he needed. It was hard to keep it set in his mind without that desire.
The stands were full, the reporters gasped as he was led in. The third Malfoy through the trials. The youngest Death Eater. Possibly the last official trial of the war if he was as low on the priority list as the guards had indicated. Oh, the headlines they could write.
‘Great, that’s just great. Exactly what I wanted to hear.’ He sighed, catching himself before mimicking Potter’s gesture of hand through his hair.
He woke up with a decent amount of sanity, of clarity. Then he saw Potter and … well … it went downhill from there. By the end of some days he almost thought that this might be an okay life. An okay future. Maybe even one to aim for?
Christmas day, Harry paced the corridor, trying to picture it. A room he required, one that he really wanted. He needed the emotion to convince the room to bother changing for him.
Of course, he was worried about her, he tried to ignore the flair of jealousy, he’d worked past that a long time ago.
From what he could translate from the stuttered Potterisms he – the him from the future who was stuck in the past – was pregnant with Potter spawn. In the war. Quite possibly headed to Azkaban. Though, probably not, the men around him had lived through it, they’d know if there had been a problem, wouldn’t they? Was that the way time travel worked? The extent of his knowledge on it was a short excerpt in a book about the use of time turners.
He liked McGonagall; he really did. He just couldn’t exactly remember why right now. She’d seen what Snape had spent the year trying to do, she knew he’d given up his whole damn life for this cause better than most people. It was amazing how quickly Gryffindor loyalty could switch with one little murder. Slytherin bonds were made of stronger stuff.
His fingers scrambled against the stone wall, ignoring the streaks of blood he left as he managed to drag himself to his feet. None of the attention was on his embarrassing attempt at least, the fight having drawn everyone’s attention.
The room Draco woke up in wasn’t familiar. It had enough touches to feel like something he’d see at home, but it wasn’t. He knew it wasn’t. He was still there.
The Gryffindor’s were scattered as the wall fell in on them. He could hear the lions scream, he felt a good chunk of the wall pound against his shoulder and by the grunt from the man in his arms, Fred knew where that chunk had almost landed. He tried to push himself up off him, shifting the rocks from his back. It took a few turns of his arms collapsing back under him before he managed it, looking around the wreckage through the dusty corridor to spot the others. The chilled night air cut through the pain, sweeping through the hallway to settle the dust. There was so much blood on Harry’s face, but he couldn’t comfort him. It wasn’t his place. Not yet at least. Hermione pulled herself to her feet next, beaten by the other two Weasley’s to reach Draco’s side.
He twisted his arm to look at it out of habit. He liked the tattoo that covered it, he remembered the week Luna had scribbled it over his skin fondly and knew that emotion was reflected on his face. He didn’t use the Malfoy mask nearly as often anymore.
The more he thought about it the more he spiralled away. The other thing that they’d slowly bonded over was being there for Teddy. He had his parents now-
From the look in the eyes of the men trying him, that still might not be enough though. He needed something else, something more, something that proved he wasn’t just a Death Eater.
With a whiplike movement, Crabbe pointed his wand at the fifty-foot mountain of old furniture, broken trunks, old books and robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, ‘Descendo!’
He frowned. Sure, yes, he’d often thought that, but he’d never shared the thoughts. Maybe he did have to accept he’d shared something with the twins. That they might have some kind of spot in his future.
‘You have me.’ He murmured, not sure how that was really meant to comfort him, but it felt like the right thing to say, it made him smile at least. That infuriating, knowing smile that was all Draco.
Harry groaned, letting the door slam behind him as he walked in to collapse on the bed. The sheets were soft, there were even bloody rose petals beneath him and the soft floral scent on the air, cut with the warmth of the log fire.
Potter hadn’t given him any other names of friends that he might be willing to invite over, and he was desperate enough to agree.
‘Fuck it! This isn’t fair!’ He bit into his bottom lip, refusing to turn away. ‘Why … why wait until now to want me?’
‘I don’t want to go there after Hogwarts.’ Harry tried to continue, letting Draco move past it or stop, whatever was least awkward.
‘Potter, I think that’s enough, don’t you?’ There was a chuckle in his tone, even if Malfoy was resisting outright laughing at him.
‘If you are of age, you may stay.’ She seemed proud to, agreeing to let children walk to their deaths, he liked McGonagall now, but he wasn’t sure he’d ever understand what was going through her mind in this moment.
He stood up straight, picking three squares in the cell that seemed spaced out about the right distance for comfortable long strides and began pacing. It was five steps, five second.
Then Snape spoke, and Draco’s heart lurched: Snape was there, alive, and for now, there was nothing he could do. Hearing him again hurt more than he thought it would.
Not the home he had here to go back to, but back into his Harry’s arms. He’d be so excited. His hand traced gently over his stomach. There was nothing noticeable there yet, but he knew. Losing half his food each day was reminder enough.
He stretched out a few times, brow furrowed as he flicked through pages of random books just as Harry was trying to read them. It didn’t take long for Harry to give up, study wasn’t that interesting anyway. Not that he had a chance on focusing when he was this tired. He still had the nightmares every night. Malfoy’s hand slipping through his haunted him. He stared at the see-through fingers, tossing and half slipping through the paper.
Draco tripped forward, caught by Blaise’s strong arm around his waist. He couldn’t have done that. He didn’t have that kind of power. He couldn’t have killed. Lupin started to run towards them but he couldn’t meet his eye. He didn’t know if it was to support them or to fight them and he could risk either of them. The coin in his pocket began to burn. He turned on unsteady feet and began sprinting across the battlefield again.
‘Honey, I’m home.’ He called out, letting the door close behind him as he walked across to where Malfoy had settled for the day. He always seemed to choose the least ashy spot for them, Harry had learnt to trust that.
He threw the pile to the side, rolling over onto his back and staring at the ceiling. It was a good idea to update their room, this carpet was much nicer to roll over. Draco was reading each of the sheets over his shoulder and clicking his tongue or shaking his head or twenty other reactions that he deemed subtle, and Harry deemed infuriating.
Harry was edging back toward the tiara he’d been trying to get before. Draco knew now that it was a Horcrux, he didn’t know how he hadn’t felt it at the time, that cold, foreboding power throbbing from it. He couldn’t let him. He knew it had to burn.
‘Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste. Lord Voldemort is merciful. I command my forces to retreat immediately.
‘Sorry- I mean- you don’t have to answer.’ Harry picked up his own parchment awkwardly staring at the blank page as though it held all the answers to his OWLS.
There was silence in the Hall now, the kind of silence that presses against the eardrums, that seems too huge to be contained by walls.
Draco frowned very slightly, the corners of his mouth twitching as he tried to keep his face as neutral as possible, he was surprisingly good at reading what Harry needed in the moments he wanted to try.
‘Don’t call me that.’ He grumbled, settling into his favourite armchair, a beautiful Slytherin green.
Harry pulled the diadem from his wrist and held it up. It was still hot, blackened with soot. A bloodlike substance, dark and tarry, seemed to be leaking from bottom of it. The tiara shook and then broke apart in his hands with a distant scream. Two Horcruxes left for them to kill then. And Draco had two lives left to save.
No, he didn’t want a bedroom, he wanted a nice room he could study in. Something comfortable for Draco to live in. The basics, table, couch, chair, maybe a fireplace? That could be nice. The flickering light across Draco’s pale face, romantic. No shit no. Basics, what are the basic things in a room. A bed. A large double bed for him and Draco.
He liked her, he had to remember he liked her. Draco stood, arm wrapping around Pansy in comfort as the rest of their peer pushed back from the benches and dragged themselves out of the hall.
He allowed himself the indulgence for a second before admitting to what he was actually doing. Just casually groping at Potter after he’d witnessed a full-blown panic attack. Yeah, that seemed completely normal. A fine thing to do the day after you wake up in the future.
Harry closed his eyes, imagining he could feel the warmth of Draco’s skin under his touch, and lent forward. Godric, he wanted it so bad, he could practically feel the huff of Draco’s breath against his lips.
Draco could have confirmed but he really didn’t have the strength. The boy they were talking about was an idiot, sure, but he was dead. There was no reason to rub in insults now.
His palm ached. He could still feel Malfoy’s hand in his. He knew that death wasn’t his fault, somehow it felt like the one he should have saved though.
Harry took off the invisibility cloak and looked down at the man he hated. Severus’ eyes found Harry’s and he wheezed through a gurgle of blood as he tried to speak, his bloodied hand clutching the front of his student’s robes as he dragged him forward, pulling him close enough to try again.
Draco cringed, not at the name but at Harry’s terrible attempt at a distraction technique. What, was his plan to ask inane questions until the other two turned up to fight three on three? As if they’d let him waste their time like that-
Harry grinned, scribbling across the page as Malfoy spoke. This was a much better way of doing homework. Hermione would be thrilled and shocked to see what he’d actually managed to do, and it did actually seem like it was sticking in his mind. Malfoy had a theatrical way of speaking that was easy to listen to. A dramatic way of explaining what and why that let him understand what he was actually talking about.
Draco clapped enthusiastically. ‘I didn’t think I’d live to see the day - Figuratively speaking of course - he can be taught.’
‘No!’ he shouted, clutching at Vince’s arm so he couldn’t cast, the next line, he had an excuse here… ‘If you wreck the room you might bury this diadem thing!’
‘No, Potter! Crucio!’ the curse missed, hitting the stone bust, which flew into the air; the diadem soared upward and then dropped out of sight in the mass of objects on which the bust had rested.
‘Right,’ Harry voice came out croaky and deep, he cleared his through before continuing, ‘I’ll keep my eyes out for that then …’ He could feel the warmth on his cheeks and hated knowing what that must look like, he tried to think of the next topic he could.
As the students kept pressing into corridors it was easy, like it had been the first time, to slip away from the stream, hiding in a semi-hidden alcove. Pansy pause, watching him move, but a sharp shake of his head and she continued on. Blaise slide in beside him, closely followed by Greg and Vince. He hadn’t done that the first time. They’d been too distant at this point for him to even notice. Or maybe it was just the panic of the day that flew by?
Sure, he’d only been here *insert unknown amount of time here*, and didn’t know how the war had ended. Or what he did. Or who he knew anymore. Or … well anything. But Potter didn’t get to keep him prisoner. Regardless of how nice the beds were!
He remembered that moment, he might be friends with the man now, but in this second, Salazar he hated the boy.
A quick glamour and he was back to who he remembered. The gaunt, broken boy he was before the battle. The boy he had never wanted to see again.
A few more stilted conversations and subtle (whatever Potter may say) observation (not admiration) and he gave in.
‘You should have died in the war! Harry and I would be together-! It shouldn’t be like this!’ He gasped out,
The enchanted ceiling of the Great Hall was dark and scattered with stars, and below it the four long House tables were lined with dishevelled students, some in traveling cloaks, others in dressing gowns. Here and there shone the pearly white figures of the school ghosts. Every eye, living and dead was fixed upon Professor McGonagall, who was speaking from the raised platform at the top of the Hall. Behind her stood the remaining teaches, including the palomino centaur, Firenze, and the members of the Order of the Phoenix who had arrived to fight.
‘Not anymore,’ panted Harry, tightening his grip on the hawthorn wand. ‘Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who's lent you theirs?’
Crabbe outstripped all of them, looking terrified. Harry, Ron, and Hermione pelted along in his wake, and the fire pursued them, leaving Draco dragging Greg along well behind them. He wanted to scream out to them, wanted to beg for help, but he bit through his lip to stop himself. If they paused they were all dead. He let them fade out of sight, moving as fast as he could with the added weight at his side.
‘They were only there because of me really. We knew each other since we were kids and they’d always been good followers. That suited me fine, so I encouraged it. In little way, rewards, treats, reassurances, all the ways that you really shouldn’t train other people. I continued it when we got into Hogwarts, they really were my friends though, they were all I’d even known even if it wasn’t a healthy friendship. They gave me their loyalty and I protected them.
‘You mean, apart from to be alive?’ Draco quickly grinned, watching Harry squirm under his gaze before continuing, ‘I don’t know, a pogo stick might be fun … oh, wait … similar issue …’
‘Huh?’ Harry could see a gap down the front of his shirt. Weird concept given that all of his was see through but they were separate layers of invisible, and the collar bone through the top of the shirt was new, caught his focus in a way he hadn’t really experienced before.
‘CloneCo?’ They dropped on the couch, facing each other, he couldn’t see the missing ear and didn’t really care enough to work it out.
Who the hell refused to wear a shirt in their own house? Not just casually, occasionally caught without it but legitimately seemed religiously opposed to the damned things. He wasn’t an idiot. He knew he was strictly doing it for the reactions it got. WHICH IT DIDN’T GET!
Draco cut himself off, looking back down at Harry who was staring at him at this point, waiting for the next sentence. Draco shook his head.
‘Thank you, Miss Parkinson. McGonagall clipped voice broke through the silent threat. ‘You will leave the Hall first with Mr. Filch. If the rest of your House could follow.’
‘Moving right along.’ Draco looked away awkwardly, gritting his teeth to continue the conversation. ‘What’s your problem with her?’
The hat had placed very few people in the Slytherin House this year. From the whispers in the corridors, it seemed like they’d all begged it not to. He wanted to argue with them. Wanted to shout at them that there was nothing wrong with the damned house, if that’s where they belonged then that’s where they should go. He couldn’t say it though. Even if no one knew how much of a hypocrite it made him.
Lights sprung out of the plastic bottles, dancing around the air above them, flashing like miniature fireworks as they squealed their cheers. Draco winced, backing away from them, why was everything created by Weasley Wizard Wheezes so damn loud and annoying?
This wasn’t his life. It couldn’t be his life. He had to get back to what it actually was, which was going to be a hard task when Potter wouldn’t even let him out of the damn house.
How was this his life? Yes, okay, with the power of hindsight along with a safe haven right now, following the Dark Lord might go into the ‘bad idea’ category. But there had been extenuating circumstances. He deserved a trial. A fine. Maybe jail time. MAYBE a tiny bit of time in Azkaban. But NOT THIS!
‘My Lord knows I seek only to serve him. But – let me go and find the boy, my Lord. Let me bring him to you. I know I can –’
Crabbe wheeled around and screamed, ‘Avada Kedavra!’ again. Ron leapt out of sight to avoid the jet of green light. Left wandless in a fight against three stun happy Gryffindor’s and a curse happy mountain in a room that was about to burn wasn’t ideal. He crouched behind a three-legged wardrobe, steadying his breath as he waited for the next part of the scene.
‘Why do you think it would do it anyway? The room hasn’t even appeared for anyone else. I don’t think it’s working anymore …’ More reasonable concerns, they seemed to get a little more consideration from Draco this time.
Green eyes found the black, but after a second, something in the depths of the dark pair vanished, blank, empty, dead. The hand holding Harry thudded to the floor, and Severus moved no more.
'Yes, and obviously that worked out stunningly for me, didn't it? Not only did I die, but I died hated by all. Just fantastic.' Draco threw himself back onto the couch with a dramatic sigh, sinking just a bit below the line of the couch.
Then he had a night in his bed. His plush mattress pressing the perfect amount under his weight. The luxurious brocaded quilt pressing reassuringly against him. The kind of perfect setup that reminded him of home. Reminded him of who he was. Then his actual brain took over thinking again.
He knew where Vince, Fred and Snape had died; the first two in front of him and the third was publicised enough afterwards to mark it as the death of a hero. That left the werewolf and his cousin. He just had to hope that none of them overlapped. So, straight into babysitting duty then make sure they were back in the room in time to almost bake to death, then face giant snake. He choked down his fear and nodded. Sounded like a fun day.
Remember comments and kudos are love! I grin like a maniac when I get the notifications so if anything in the chapter made you smile then do the same for me! 😊
Hermione continued with barely a glance at them. ‘Let's stick together. I say we go – Harry, what's that on your arm?’
your stupid Harry. I want to go home.’ If he was standing, he might have even stomped his foot, he sounded so sulky.
Harry looked up, watching every twitch of his expression as he began to speak, he looked calm, kind of a combination of resigned and wistful to final be telling his side of that moment. His last moment and the moment that haunted Harry’s dreams. As though he could feel the green gaze, he glanced up, meeting his eyes and offered him a shaky smile before looking away again.
‘Okay, we’ll move away from that then. Draco Junior?’ That was the one missing an ear, which one was that?
He hadn’t lost as much as he should have. He had a family left to celebrate with. The Weasley’s, the Lupins, both were still complete. Surrounded by family he’d forgotten him.
‘There’s fucking life Severus! You know how hard that can be! He needs someone! He needs fucking family!’
Harry laughed, kind of, it barely passed as laughter. His eyes were darting around to try to spot his friends without taking them completely off the Slytherins in front of him.
The commentary in his head had an annoyingly posh tone. After the war he’d started doing that for a few of the people he’d lost. It was comforting to think he was keeping their spirits alive, if only in his head. The people he knew well enough, the ones he’d loved.
His heart was thumping, and he wasn’t quite sure why. There seemed to be levels to this conversation that he was missing. He’d said it before, Draco had him to keep him company, him to talk to. But when he’d said it before it had been Malfoy, not Draco. When he said it before the room hadn’t felt like this.
Lupin walked up to Harry’s side; hand clasped warmly on his shoulder as he pulled him into a hug, quickly joined by a very alive Tonks.
‘So, Harry, you sure you don’t want to come home with us for Christmas? Gin would love to have you there. Give you a good chance to
He turned away; pointing his wand at the starry cage holding the snake, which drifted upward, off Snape, who fell sideways onto the floor, blood gushing from the wounds in his neck. Voldemort swept from the room without a backward glance, with the great serpent floating after him in its huge protective sphere.
It was weird having his own little Malfoy … ghost … secret. By Christmas he’d adjusted and almost wasn’t sure how he’d managed without it … without him.
‘You sound like Lucius. Neither of you understands Potter as I do. He does not need finding. Potter will come to me. I knew his weakness you see, his one great flaw. He will hate watching the others struck down around him, knowing that it is for him that it happens. He will want to stop it at any cost. He will come.’
Or … he wasn’t … he was just where a Draco Malfoy was married to this Harry Potter … but not him, not really.
‘Merlin Potter, there’s a lot to unpack there. There are a bloody lot of things I’ve done that you have a right to demand an answer to … which bruise would you like to poke at now?’ Draco flashed him his crooked smile, trying to lighten the tone, even if it was an offer to answer whatever question was weighing on him.
‘Hello, Minister!’ bellowed Percy, sending a neat jinx straight at Thicknesse, who dropped his wand and clawed at the front of his robes, apparently in awful discomfort. ‘Did I mention I'm resigning?’
Even with his steps his breathing wasn’t working right. How the fuck did he usually take five seconds with each breath in and out? He gasped it in in a second, desperate to fill his lungs. It left him with a wheeze, sucked from his body just as fast.
This joke of a bed, the taunting painted light and the heavy bars that trapped him were all he would know until they decided he was a priority. Or run out of everyone else.
He dropped his arm straight away, letting the loose sleeve of the grey prisoner robe fall back over it. The court took a while to settle down again, but the Minister dragged it back under control, handing it back to the Head Warlock to ask the final question.
He wanted to tell him he didn’t need it. He wanted to tell him that it was already destroyed. But maybe Harry needed to see it to believe it. He couldn’t change anything.
Draco didn’t move towards it, his eyes followed it for a moment then moved back to Harry, he’d get his answers directly from him.
He doubled over. It didn’t help. He knew it didn’t help. It did the opposite of help. But his head was starting to spin. He couldn’t think clearly. He couldn’t make himself walk down.
The man in question winced slightly, he did every time Draco called him that name. He got a warped kind of pleasure out of that. At least one reaction similar to the time he was from. Potter left without complaint though, leaving him alone with the twins. He led them into the reading room that he imagined he had designed and styled. He was comfortable here, in his own space, and he needed all the strength he could get if he was meant to face the two gingers.
Draco smiled, a sparkle in his eyes at the words. He took a step towards Harry again before letting the smile fall sad, still pulling his lips up at the ends but it felt tragic.
Draco fell asleep bathed in murky, green light filtered through the water of the Great Lake, in the Slytherin dorms. The chill of the dungeons settled in his bones, the fear of the day to come chilling him to his soul. He closed his eyes, half hoping he wouldn’t have to open them again.
‘No, I have performed my usual magic. I am extraordinary, but this wand...no. It has not revealed the wonders it has promised. I feel no difference between this wand and the one I procured from Ollivander all those years ago.’
The hesitation was enough. The rest of the students had already passed, sending Blaise out into the corridors on his own would be like signing his death warrant, he was a Slytherin so both sides wouldn’t hesitate to fire at him. He bit his lip, staring at his three accomplices.
‘C-Crabbe,’ Draco managed, choked on ash and tears, he knew the answer, but he still had to ask; he was meant to have saved him. ‘C-Crabbe...’
If he was released that meant mother would be there, here. He’d have to answer questions. Starting with the same one everyone so far had asked: “Who was the baby’s father?”. He couldn’t tell her that. He’d changed enough – too much – already. No one could know the truth, no one could be trusted not to hurt him, or the baby, or his timeline if they found out. Maybe Severus, but he’d already given him another task. That catch up would have to wait.
‘Ahhh … well …’ Eloquent Potter, really impressive control of the English language. ‘We kinda knew that- what I mean to say is-’
How didn’t he remember this? He knew that waiting was hell, but it felt more … frantic last time. Time seemed to slip through his fingers as he awaited Azkaban. This time he knew he was just counting down the time until he could go home. Merlin, he wanted to be home right now.
The Minister gestured to the Auror’s at the side of the room and they moved towards him as one. They had to get him out of there before he caused more of a stir. It was quite a claim, a pregnant pureblood male would be rare enough to be protected. Or at the very least not killed.
He knew how this part went. He was thrown into a small square cell in the middle of the room. Last time he’d been terrified, he started stoically forward and accepted his fate, still just stunned he was alive.
‘You little cheat.’ Draco smirked back, a flash of teeth in his smile. ‘Alright, I’ll see if I can dumb down my answers enough for the teacher to believe it came from you.’
‘I wouldn’t have saved him. I was never that kind of hero.’ He tested the thought, he’d never said something like that out loud, Malfoy looked confused, but didn’t look like he was judging him.
Ahhh … shit. Of course, that was another dig at something Draco should have. He was doing so well at torturing him about the life he was missing today.
Snape did not speak. He knew the danger he was in, at the moment he lacked the right words to reassure his master. Draco wanted to reach him, wanted so badly to help. He closed his eyes, this part he had to let play out.
His breath came out in a rush, he wasn’t thinking. He couldn’t think. If he had been he wouldn’t have said what he did-
There were flashes of spells from down the corridor, shouts of curses and pain echoing through the halls. They’d made it into Hogwarts. He knew it was up to that time of night but Merlin, he was so ready for this to be done.
‘Reactions and volatile combinations of basic bases and cauldron materials in healing potions. Really? You think that will be necessary in the day-to-day training of Auror’s?’ Ron snorted into his food.
There was a reason he was his best friend after all, willing to take him at his word when he needed it, even if they both suspected it was a bit of a lie. He smiled at Hermione.
He tried to ignore the pouting ghost in the corner of his vision, but that was harder than it sounded. He might be translucent, as thin as air and dead, but he was still Draco-bloody-Malfoy, and Harry had never been able to ignore him.
He clamped a hand over his mouth, the problem was too much oxygen, not not enough. He forced himself to breath through his nose, limiting his intake. It wasn’t pleasant. It took a while for his body to believe it wasn’t just dying. But it worked.
Harry frowned. That whole day was hectic, he remembered the moment, but it had changed so many times as he dreamt it every night. The day partially eclipsed by his own death. He really couldn’t argue the details.
Harry shoved the books and paper back into his bag, heading to the door. He paused, hand on the handle, not quite ready to leave.
He didn’t remember this part. Had it happened the first time or was this something he’d changed? He started with his go to sneer.
He looked around the room thoughtfully, it didn’t look like he was considering it for the first time.
He doubled over. It didn’t help. He knew it didn’t help. It did the opposite of help. But his head was starting to spin. He couldn’t think clearly. He couldn’t make himself walk down.
Draco shifted closer to Greg, checking his vitals, steady, just unconscious from the spell. Not that either Gryffindor would be nice enough to wake him. Two wandless children, one unconscious, in the middle of a battle? Yeah, that sounded safe. Save them once then done.
‘Don’t be naïve Draco, the list of people who will grieve me begins and ends with the man standing in front of me now. I’m glad I got the chance to say goodbye to you, but with this my duty to Potter ends. So, yes, I intend to leave.’
For once Malfoy was silent. That was even more disturbing than his constant prattle. He was waiting for Harry to fill in the blanks, to explain what the hell he was doing.
There was still a glimmer of hope in those last words. He knew that this was the end. That this was the only answer he could give. But somehow … he still sounded like he expected Harry to say something, something left that would still fix it all. He was Harry-bloody-Potter after all. If he couldn’t do it, if he didn’t get the happy ending, then who the hell did?
Only one more person he knew for sure died after this and he couldn’t get in the way of Harry’s death.
Harry lent off the side of his broom, reaching out for Malfoy’s outstretched hand. His fingers brushed against his just as the blonde boy dropped his arm, shifting back and sliding a step down the melting pile. Crabbe’s thick arm lunged out immediately in his place, clutching to Harry’s arm, yanking the broom to the side as he was pulled up to safety. The whole thing only took a portion of a second and he swerved away, rushing to the exit, hoping he could still survive this. But that final expression on Malfoy’s face stayed with him. Determined, resigned, his lips set in a hard grimace against the pain, but he looked proud, even with tears streaking down his face, as though he thought he’d done the right thing for once.
Something more than blood was leaking from Severus. Silvery blue, neither gas nor liquid, it gushed form his mouth and his ears and his eyes, they were the memories he’d given Harry. Draco didn’t even know they could be given that way. Harry looked lost and, not for the first time, he was relieved for Hermione’s quick thinking as she conjured and forced a flask into his shaking hand.
Greg’s wand flew out of his hand and disappeared into the bulwark of objects beside him; he leapt foolishly on the spot, trying to retrieve it. Draco jumped out of range of Hermione's second Stunning Spell, and Ron, appearing suddenly at the end of the aisle, shot a full Body-Bind Curse at Crabbe, in the chaos of everyone else’s movements it narrowly missed. Well done, the battling lions had managed to rend the two ‘not attackers’ wandless. Very helpful.
She glanced at Snape's body, then hurried back to the tunnel entrance. Ron followed quickly after her then Harry with his Invisibility Cloak clutched in his arms and the flask in one hand.
‘I wasn’t sure I’d get the chance … but I’m glad I did. It’s a portkey, will take you to wherever I am. I’m still your godfather- if you ever need me …’
Voldemort's tone was musing, calm, from the flicker of Severus’ face he could read the fury building behind it.
Shit, he was already royally fucking this up. There was no time for that though. The walls trembled with the first volley of spells as the Death Eaters broke through the first barrier. He locked eyes with Blaise.
Draco nodded and saw what he needed to in Blaise’s face to turn and walk out of the castle. The fist death was Lupin’s from what he could tell. Dead before the Death Eater’s broke into the castle proper, which meant, to save him, they were heading outside, into the centre of the war.
Potter sat up, pulling the blanket over himself as he actually opened his eyes and looked at him properly.
Draco stared back at the ceiling, humming softly in what could have been agreement, or just general sadness. There were no words that could follow that. Nothing left to be said in that moment between them.
to her. You know, in private?’ If Ron’s eyebrows when he said “talk” weren’t bad enough then then wink he gave him when he finished really sealed the deal.
It wasn’t very late in the day, which was surprising to Harry, who felt like hours had passed. But the sun was still in the sky (presumably—behind all the clouds) and people were milling about. It looked like rush hour.
Maybe he’d make a bookplate and number it, like Malfoy did with his books. The first book in his very own library.
Harry was looking at Malfoy instead of the books. “Have you ever been to a Muggle bookstore? Since you have all those Muggle books…”
“Ready to go?” Draco asked, having come up. He put a hand on Harry’s shoulder, his grip firm and reassuring.
“Maybe. I…” Harry rubbed his eyes. “I’m not sure I can do it alone. I don’t know where to start, or where to get two more players, or uniforms, or—” He cut himself off with a wave of his hand. “Or the paperwork.”
“Confused. Relieved? But confused.” Harry drew in a deep breath. “He said it was off the table then, and we haven’t talked about it since. I…don’t really understand it. If it were Ginny, we’d have fought about it. But he just said okay. I don’t know what to think about it? It’s weird. How could he go from being really…like, really into it one moment and then just flip to completely disinterested the next when all I said was no?”
“Not at all.” Dean clicked his glass to Harry’s. “Everything all right? You look harried, if you’ll pardon the pun.”
Everything was off kilter. Ginny was going to break up with him. Harry knew it as surely as he knew the colour of the sky.
“Harry,” Draco said, “it’s pointless discussing it further. Mood thoroughly ruined and all that. We can talk about it later if you want, but right now I just want to get back to my tea and maybe try to catch up with Pansy. I haven’t…been the best of friends, to her, lately.”
The blizzard had subsided into heavy snowfall, but Harry decided not to un-cancel the Little League training. Perhaps he should’ve, to work off the restless energy and distract himself, but it was too short notice. He’d do some shopping and then grab the chance to finish that bizarre classic Malfoy had lent him.
here now.” That part of it was more than nice, Harry thought. Over these past few weeks, he’d seen glimpses of Draco’s core, got really close, as they talked about books and ideologies and told each other things—Draco had perhaps opened up more than Harry had, in some regards—but being like this, skin to skin, was a different kind of closeness.
Ginny didn’t come home the following day and wasn’t responding to owls (Hilde returned increasingly antsy and aggressive every time Harry sent her out with another letter), so Harry took the opportunity to unpack the rest of the boxes and search for his books. They were meant to have a housewarming party, but boxes were still stacked in the living room (what was even in those boxes, Harry wondered, he couldn’t recall seriously missing any items), and they just hadn’t got around to it.
“It just came with the robes,” Draco said, showing him the now tear-splotched handkerchief. It was the same colour as the accents on Draco’s robes, but made of a softer material. “It matches.”
By the time he got back to the table, Ron and Hermione had arrived, and only just; Ron was helping Hermione out of her coat. Harry greeted them and guided Hermione into the chair he’d been sitting in so he would be at a slightly safer distance from Pansy.
She sat on the sofa next to him, slowly, gingerly, like she didn’t really want to, like any sudden movement from her would shatter the earth.
Harry kissed Draco again and then jogged back to Ginny and the teeming mass of excited children and parents and assorted family members. Ginny handed the kids off to Harry with desperation, which Harry thought wasn’t entirely fair. He had only been away with Draco for a moment.
Harry removed the ice pack to look at her lip. It had stopped bleeding and wasn’t as swollen as it could’ve been. “I’ll put some salve on that. Hugh, you’ve been quiet.”
“Maybe? I think so. I don’t know. It’s…weird. But nice weird. I’m…working through some stuff.” Harry focused on his sandwich as he spoke, not sure why telling Ron about therapy seemed so…revealing. He’d told Draco, and it hadn’t felt like this.
“All right,” Harry cut in, before they could wind each other up again. “Betty, I thought you liked the yellow bat best?”
“Hey,” he said. “I love you. I’m not breaking up with you.” He didn’t really understand why she’d think that—sure they had their problems, but breaking up? It had never even registered as an option.
“What happened? You look awful. Have you been crying?” Ginny reached for him, concerned, and Harry winced, taking a step back.
Harry gave it a cursory glance to check that it was indeed a request form. “All right, a ludicrous amount of deaths coming your way. I’ll be a moment.” He rolled his chair out from under the desk and headed for the levitating platform. (Why they didn’t simply install ordinary elevators was completely beyond Harry.)
Hilde was resting in her cage, so Harry wrote a cancellation for Little League practice, duplicated it, and sent her off with all twelve notes. He couldn’t face people anymore, not with the growing abyss of terror and desperation within him.
“That’s really great,” Harry said, even if he couldn’t help being just a smidge jealous. “Congrats.”
Which was why Harry was now trying to find out if he could find Dudley. He checked Surrey first, in case the Dursleys had returned and Dudley had chosen to stay close to his parents, but while he did find his aunt and uncle back at 4 Privet Drive, Dudley wasn’t listed at that address.
And now he was here, a whole fifteen minutes early for his appointment and still muddy from Little League practice, trying not to pace nervously in the small receiving room. There was a comfy looking sofa and a chair, a large potted plant with vicious looking red blossoms, a coffee table covered in a mix of Muggle and wizarding magazines of a kind that Harry didn’t care to investigate further, and a rack full of pamphlets and leaflets and copies of what looked like a Muggle psychology journal.
“I had a crush on Cho,” Harry corrected, annoyance rising up in him. His eyes were no longer burning, but his throat still felt rotten and now he was arguing about…what? His sexual orientation? As far as he was concerned, he probably didn’t actually have one, because it’d likely died when he’d died. Back in the forest, all those years ago now. Only he’d come back, and it hadn’t.
“Don’t stop on my account!” Harry hurried to say. He liked this side of Draco, liked seeing it, and didn’t want him to take it back. He’d never seen him so excited about anything, not even the most obscure coroner reports he’d managed to dig up for him. “It sounds interesting. I’ve never thought about those things.”
They ate their lemon tarts in silence, the rain falling off Malfoy’s invisible umbrella in a neat round curtain.
“I did love you,” Ginny said after a breath. She was crying, but silently. “Still do. But you never—I didn’t feel like you loved me. Not in the same way. It was like I was just…I don’t know, some kind of means to an end, or an ideal personified, or something—I don’t know. As much as you talked about wanting kids, you never were very interested in actually making them.”
It was ostentatious and marvellous and completely ridiculous, but Harry loved it and the kids loved it—having stopped cheering and screaming just long enough to notice—and there wasn’t anything else Harry loved more in that moment but the pure and unadulterated joy and awe on their faces.
. Three months into the year, and he’d been dumped, gone back to school, started a Quidditch team, got a boyfriend, started therapy, and now, apparently, was meeting with his cousin over bloody
He wondered if it’d be the same with Draco, if he’d need this prop to actually enjoy it, or coax Draco into doing things differently. Different from what? Harry had no frame of reference because he and Draco hadn’t done anything, hadn’t even kissed, and maybe they would never get that far, maybe everything would fall apart before they even got the chance. Maybe they wouldn’t even have to.
why he was messed up like this, and—reality came crashing, as Harry remembered that Draco had left and hadn’t answered his owl and might not want to talk to him at all.
… Harry weighed the book in his palm. It was a ridiculous book, but it had been a gift from his best friend. He couldn’t dream of throwing it away. In the end, he placed it on the same shelf as the photo book, but leaning against the opposite wall.
“Like children made it,” Harry finished for him, with a grin. “It’s a Christmas gift from my daycare kids. We painted trays last year for gifts, for their parents, and they painted me one too. Isn’t it great?”
“So you will neither confirm nor deny the rumours that Weasley is having a romantic affair with a teammate?”
“I think,” Harry said, dropping into a crouch so he could get on eye level with the kids, “that somebody has been teasing these broomsticks, and now they’re too embarrassed to fly.”
“Harry, what do you want from this meeting?” Gladys finally asked after ten minutes of Harry deflecting everything. “What’s your goal today?”
“That’s hard to say. It’s complicated. I’ve learned that recovering from mental illness is a crooked thing. It’s not a straight line. It was good in some ways, not great in some others. I’m doing better now than I have in a long time.” He looked serious. “I might never completely recover, you know. Mental health recovery doesn’t really have an end date. I’m never going to be the same person I was before. I might get worse again—we’ve changed my medication twice already. I mean—I just need you to know that.”
“Two am,” Harry confessed. Having that in common with Malfoy…Hope surged. “This morning. I liked it, even if nothing actually happened in it.”
“I suppose,” Harry said, frowning. He’d taken Calming Draught a number of times and didn’t care for it at all. It didn’t compare to a bath bomb, in his opinion. “I don’t think they’re the same.”
Inexplicably, Harry’s throat seized up. He knew, objectively, that he’d had a terrible upbringing, he knew it had been abusive, he knew it had been traumatic, he knew—he knew all those things. Hermione had pointed it out to him, Ron had been horrified, he would still make an offhand comment about something and meet distressed silence. He
He Apparated straight to the Chudley Cannons home stadium. Little League training wasn’t for another hour or so, and the stadium was empty. He hadn’t had dinner, and on an abstract level he knew he should eat something before having to deal with twelve kids, but right now there was no way he could muster the energy to deal with something as simple as food acquisition. Instead, he sat down on a trunk in the equipment room, and exhaled.
“All right.” Harry resisted the temptation to rub his face. He’d learned the hard way not to show his frustration around small children. “You run off, now, Avery. I’m going to have a word with Charlie for a second.”
“Hmmm,” Harry said, seriously. They were all standing in a circle around the grounded broomsticks, Charlie and Alice fidgeting, while Avery, Betty and Hugh were trading looks. “I see the problem,” he said. “Yes, it’s very serious indeed.”
“Uhm.” Harry didn’t know where to start. Gladys had had to ask him probing questions to get him to talk—to articulate his feelings. “Standard stuff,” he said, eventually. “Like—beat me, terrorise me at school, all kinds of…that. My aunt and uncle were the worst, though. They—they used to lock me up. It used to be, my Uncle would punish me for breathing, and I wouldn’t get dinner, or—” Harry cut himself off, acutely aware that Draco’s grip on his hand had become painfully tight. “That kind of thing,” he finished, lamely.
“Yeah?” Ginny got into his space, arms slinking around him. “Want to skip home from the pub early? Or skip the pub entirely?”
was a pattern, this and all the times he’d gone along with it instead of saying no for whichever reason—avoiding a fight, doing something nice for her, wanting a closeness but not
It was impossible to stand still—his kids were giving their all, and their enthusiasm and excitement was contagious. Harry barely noticed the crowd in the stands, being too busy yelling encouragement and suggestions at his players and rotating them out when he saw them flagging.
Malfoy stood there, uncertain, looking like he wanted to say something, or maybe like he didn’t want to want to say something but wanted to say it anyway—which was a sentence Harry thought would sound crazy if he said it out loud—and didn’t say anything at all. Then he turned and walked out and was gone within seconds.
“It doesn’t really matter? If you want to see all the colours it’s easier if you drop that in first, but it’s also fun to watch it fizz around you in the water.” Harry checked the temperature. Still good.
, Harry definitely still hated the press. Hackles raised, he leaned towards the amplifier. “Did you have a question relevant to the topic at hand?”
Harry forgot he meant to ask what Malfoy wanted with all those reports and only remembered when five o’clock came around and he had to politely chase Malfoy out.
Ginny stood up and came over to kiss him, her hair falling over his face like a curtain. “Want to show me just how much you love me?”
“It's not really called Big League,” she said, giving him a smile. “Whatever you want. I was actually looking forward to teaching the kids the Finbourgh Flick tonight.”
“Mr Potter, rumour has it that you and Ginny Weasley, Chaser for the Holyhead Harpies, are no longer together. Do you care to comment?”
“Oh?” Draco smiled, a corner of his mouth curling just so. Harry both loved and hated that he knew how to read it.
“I’m sorry I can’t be what you want,” he said, forcing the words out through the knot in his throat. “I wanted to be enough for you. I wanted it to be enough that I love you, that nothing else mattered, or…”
“Yup. Not yet—but the process starts next month. By July we’ll be settled.” Seamus was grinning again, but it was softer now, and aimed at Dean.
“Perfume?” Malfoy asked, looking at the nearest pile. It consisted of round bombs swirled with pink and purple.
“Chilling, isn’t it? I guess Dad wasn’t considering the impact it would have on our revenue stream when he allied himself with a genocidal madman,” Malfoy said dryly. “We lost all our tenants, so we couldn’t afford to keep the estates in good repair, et cetera.”
“It might.” Ginny gave them another once over. “You look good. I—I’ve got to go. See you later, Harry. Draco.”
“Quidditch analysis articles,” Ginny said, shrugging. The tension around her eyes leached away. “I don’t have time for much else.”
“You should check these out,” Harry said, wanting to move on. He showed Malfoy little oval green bombs with a leaf pattern. “These make me think of Quidditch. They smell like the outside. Well, like mud and wood.” He gestured at his cloak, which still sported mud-splatter from Quidditch Daycare that morning.
“Yeah. Hey, I’ll take this stuff back to our lockers at the Cannons’,” Ginny said. “I think someone is waiting for you.”
Charlie had three Chasers coming at him, flanked by both Beaters, and everyone was watching—holding their breaths—to see if Charlie would block the goal. Two things happened: Charlie blocked a Bludger with a sidekick to the left, and the Quaffle with his face, and Alice floated on her broom towards the grass as casual as you’d like, reached towards a flower—and caught the Golden Snitch.
“Living,” Malfoy answered, following Harry out onto the Muggle street. “I’ve never been through this way. Where are we?” He looked around and up and down, as if the answer was to be found in the sky or on the curb.
Malfoy frowned. “I’d have thought…well, I guess the administrative centre and the government are here too, so it makes sense that that the National Archive is here, and…”
was attractive, but he’d been gearing up for it all week. He wasn’t going to back out now. “I—I don’t know what to think of the whole thing, but I think I’m willing to see what happens.”
Ginny wasn’t here, so he would have to get somebody else to be assistant coach. Harry hadn’t realised that breaking up also meant
Harry was staring, trying to believe what was happening—he was paralysed, hot and cold at the same time, and there was this din in his head like a large machine had taken residence there just to make noise.
They spent the rest of the ride home going over the drills and practices Harry was giving his kids and discussing possible uniform colours for the team to be. He was letting the kids name the team, he decided, once he had a team—they might not all want to join.
Thus prompted into action, the kids all—all but one—stopped crying. They picked up their brooms and trotted over to Harry.
“Right. Okay. Yes.” Harry exhaled. He couldn’t argue with any of that, and maybe he could believe that Draco would stick around—he had, in fact, stuck around for six weeks before Harry had cocked up the other night—and maybe he was also actually hungry. “It smells delicious.”
Ginny paused. She had a fork stuck in her noodles, wound tight. “Malfoy?” Her voice had an odd quality to it. “What was he doing there?”
Ms Baxter gave Harry a long-suffering smile. “He’s been practicing with apples at home,” she confided with a whisper. “He managed to charm them himself.”
Malfoy pointed. “That one is a classic, a coming of age novel about a wizard, not personally my favourite but it’s not bad. It’s, ah, a cultural corner stone? The saying to be as stubborn as a cabbage comes from there. And that one is a Muggle romance novel, that is to say, it’s not written by a Muggle, but it’s about a wizard who falls in love with one. It came out last year. That one is a collection of poetry, which I don’t know if you like, but I thought it amusing and clever. Critics hated it, though. And that one on top is a Muggle novel.” Malfoy leaned closer. “It’s a s
The Butterfly Bumpkins had won their third game by a hair; Candy Cranes had put up a good fight. As much as it could be called a fight with children this age—but the weather had been good, the kids had been in a good mood, and everyone had had fun. The defeat to the Fishes the previous weekend seemed all but forgotten, and when the game ended with the Snitch still on the loose and Butterfly Bumpkins ahead by ten points, the kids were happy.
Harry turned around, left Diagon Alley, and headed instead for his favourite Muggle shop. He wasn’t running low on bath bombs exactly, but there were none left of the kind Ginny liked. She was a shower person, but sometimes Harry could persuade her to join him for a soak.
“Yeah. I wanted to repair them and give them away. Continue to fix what I broke, you know? And give back. But the problem was, most of those properties were dead, and many were in Muggle areas. So I couldn’t use magic to fix them, and while I could give them to magic folks, well. They were still dead, you know?”
“I guess,” Draco said and sipped his tea. “But I wouldn’t have liked it half as much. I like—I like seeing people earn their happy endings. It’s—on a narrative level, I think it’s more satisfying to structure a love story that way, but personally, emotionally, I just…like it more.”
Harry had a busy afternoon at the Archive, as the grad student in the office next to Malfoy’s needed help deciphering some medieval manuscripts, a task that was, frankly, way above Harry’s paygrade. If he got into the archivist course he’d have the option of taking Medieval Palaeography but until then, those manuscripts were as much a mystery to him as…mysterious things, such as the existence of hiccups.
“Right. Well, as you can see,” she gestured at herself, “I’m transgender. I realised fairly early on, but I also realised that if I let it fly, my parents would turn on me the same they turned on you, and I didn’t want that to happen. And I didn’t want them to find out or raise suspicion, so…I took part in their abuse, of you.”
Charlie and his mum were at the game, just two seats over from Harry’s. The game hadn’t started yet; they’d arrived early—Harry did indeed have a hangover, but he’d dragged himself out anyway—and Charlie was bouncing in his seat, waving frantically.
Draco hadn’t touched his food either. “I just don’t understand,” he said, “how, after everything we did, we deserve anything at all. The book—those characters all did some truly awful things to overturn the government, and they just…went and got married and that was it? How did they deserve that? How do we deserv—”
Well, sort of. Draco hadn’t colonised Harry’s wardrobe or anything, but he did have a toothbrush in the bathroom, and even if he didn’t sleep over every night—Draco usually opted for Flooing home, and some days he never came over to begin with, like on Tuesdays and most Fridays.
All the same, the whole thing appealed to every fibre of Harry’s being—training a little team from the ground up, seeing them through a couple of games, helping them win a trophy, and at the same time raise money for a charity of his own choosing? Harry could think of more than a few causes he wouldn’t mind putting his support behind.
“That’s great,” Ron said, sincerely. “We all could use some of that, yeah? Put our heads on straight and all.”
It wasn’t used much, as it looked to Muggles like a narrow passage between two large buildings barely large enough for a cat to pass through, and to wizardfolk felt a little like rubbing shoulders with an electrical outlet. Most preferred to enter and exit the district through the Leaky Cauldron.
“I think I liked it. It’s complicated—it’s like the robots book. No definitive solution to anything.” Harry held the door for Draco, then fell in step with him, their shoulders touching. “But I think I liked it?”
Harry didn’t turn around until he heard the front door open and close and he was certain Ginny had left. Then he let himself collapse, exhausted and confused—both feeling better for having cleared some of the air between him and Ginny, and worse. He needed to talk to Draco more than ever, to understand what exactly had gone wrong—Harry was sure he had part of the answer, but he needed to think, to see Draco, find out if there was a way back.
“Mhmm, yes I think so. Whatever you’ve got in the next century.” Malfoy tapped the pencil against the notebook’s open pages. “Come to think of it, why are the Irish reports here and not in Ireland?”
Indoor activities weren’t Harry’s favourite as a childminder—which was why he’d opened a Quidditch Daycare—but law dictated that attention should be paid to intellectual and artistic stimulation. He spent enough time indoors in the Archive and relished the chance to spend half his time outside in the fresh air. When he’d been looking for locations for the daycare, he’d come across a small cottage with a large field, bordered by woods on two sides and the cottage itself on the third. The fourth was a road, and on the other side of it sat a row of squat little houses. It was secluded and private, and the village was mixed Muggle and magic, so nobody would bat an eyelid at a bunch of kids on broomsticks.
“I just want to know you,” Harry continued. “Like—what do you do all day? I mean. You’ve never told me, what do you actually…spend your time doing? I know you’re not working, and you don’t come to the Archive anymore, so…I’m, like, super busy all the time and I hardly think you just sit around all day waiting for me.”
Mystified, and not altogether unaffected by his admission that Malfoy was looking cute, Harry tried to pull himself together. “So…more of those for you today, then?”
Pansy shrieked suddenly, a cue that some particularly exciting person had arrived. Harry turned to see Blaise and Millicent making their way over, carrying a large number of drinks on fire. “Millie!” Pansy shrieked. “I thought you weren’t coming!”
want to have sex with them was so entirely foreign to Harry that he didn’t know what to think or say. Ginny had wanted him all the time, or so it had felt; it hadn’t happened very often that she turned him down. Possibly because he hadn’t asked very often to begin with. It was usually when they’d been fighting that she didn’t want to, which had made a lot of sense to Harry. He’d never wanted to either, and especially not then.
The three of Harry’s daycare kids who’d already turned five had all signed up for the Little League team. So many kids and parents had turned up for the try-outs that he had twelve players; seven for a team and five to rotate. Teddy wasn’t among them—he was in the upper age bracket and had joined a team with a base near Andromeda’s house. Harry had been given carte blanche to use the Chudley Cannons home pitch, so here he was, standing in a muddy field in Devon, with twelve excited faces looking up at him, their parents standing at the edge of the field chatting to each other.
“You,” Harry answered, looking at Draco. “I wanted to know more about PTSD and all that, so maybe I could understand it better. I was curious, too—I wanted to know more about what it’s like for you.”
“I see.” Harry glanced at her. She looked genuinely upset, and understandably so. He closed the jar of salve and cut out strips of band aids for Hugh. “I will talk to Avery about this. Is that all right?”
“Keep it, toss it, I don’t care,” Ginny said. “What do you want to do about the flat? I think I can withdraw from the lease if you want to stay, but I don’t want to just leave you hanging with the rent all by yourself…”
Okay. Harry could live with that. He hadn’t worn hats since he’d had to wear them for his Hogwarts uniform, but he could make an exception.
“Are you ready to play another game?” Harry asked them, conscious of not using too much language about winning and losing, just in case they lost today’s game.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, relieved she didn’t seem injured and that there’d been no outburst of accidental magic.
The game passed almost without Harry’s noticing, and before he knew of it, it was over and the Harpies had lost.
“Marking my spot?” Malfoy looked at Harry again. “Is that not okay? I would like to return tomorrow and resume my work.”
“I thought you didn’t mean it, before,” Draco answered, still flushed. “It wasn’t—it just seemed like a thing to say, random, not really…”
Draco wouldn't know that Harry wasn’t at work, so Harry rushed to the Archive, hoping he'd catch him still there.
They were still a fairly haphazard team; they’d only been training together for four weeks, and some of the kids hadn’t had any formal Quidditch training at all before joining. Even so, Harry was confident they would do well at the game on Sunday. They had another training session on Thursday, which was also when everyone would get their player uniforms and they would check over the equipment to make sure everything was in order and ready for the game.
“Oh—yeah, it was just, there was nothing else happening but them falling in love,” Harry said. “There was no…world-saving plot or anything. Just the two of them falling in love and having lots of sex and, I dunno, it was just boring. I wanted there to be other things too, like, like that book with the detective and the magician, they were working together to save England’s magic, but were also obviously falling in love on the side, you know? I liked that. But instead there’s just this witch and wizard and they do nothing but fall in love, and…” Harry trailed off, not sure how to articulate himself beyond ‘and it was boring’ for the third time.
“I did, it was amazing!” Harry told her, giving her a clap on the shoulder while still keeping half his attention on the game. He’d have to rotate Joseph, Denise and Love out soon so Emma, Nathan and Anthony could get their turns.
They walked the short distance to the tube in silence, and got to the platform just as the train pulled in. The only other people in their carriage were an elderly lady with a small dog, and a man in a suit.
Thankfully, Malfoy either didn’t notice or he pretended not to notice, so Harry’s dignity remained intact.
“But what if I never want to?” Harry blurted out. “I mean—I don’t know, I don’t want to—I don’t want you to resent me.”
How was he this close to basically asking Draco to move in with him when he and Ginny hadn’t lived together for
(e.g. get an erection -> sustain the erection -> please the partner -> ejaculate, with no space for the male partner to not climax at all (the male partner not climaxing being seen as a slight on the female partner), and on it goes.) as well as build
had my big gay awakening,” Pansy then said, thoughtful look on her face. “There was a girl in Durmstrang who just,” Pansy gestured, “did
“Come to the pub with me,” Harry repeated. “It doesn’t have to be tonight, it can be next week, or the week after, or sometime later, but promise you’ll come.”
“I thought that was a rumour? Good for them.” Pansy frowned. “Well, there’s Cornelia, but we dated once, and I think Abby and Ursula broke up again. Anyway, Ursula and I hooked up once.”
“That’s quite all right,” Malfoy said, but he had that formal, polite tone back in his voice. He hovered there for just a moment too long, as if he didn’t know what to do next.
because I don’t know what it is yet. It’s not been a week.” He threw the paper onto Hermione’s desk and started in on his soup. “I’d like to think it’s a good thing. Maybe permanent.”
“No, actually…” Malfoy’s mouth twitched. “I like to read in bed. It’s not very practical either, I suppose, but it’s very comfortable.”
“Maybe.” Malfoy paid for both their lunches and gestured for Harry to get a move on. Their plates, as always, floated gently ahead. “Maybe it’s all of those things. Smelling the weather, tasting the food, talking to you. It’s a particular kind of peace.”
“ALICE,” Harry yelled, finally noticing her standing there after witnessing the sheer implausibility of what Charlie had just done. “WHAT IS THAT?”
Asexuality had nothing to do with dying, she’d said. There were limited resources and knowledge about asexuality, she’d said, but one thing she did know: it didn’t come from death.
Charlie stepped up to the broom, held his hand out and looked at Harry, uncertainty in his eyes. Harry gave him a nod. Charlie drew in a deep breath and then: “Up!”
Harry stood at the edge of the gravel pathway to the Manor, reluctant to go near the building at all, but also unable to spot any other structures nearby. Draco had said the house was a dower house and that his mum had moved into it when both he and his father had gone to prison. When Draco had been released he’d moved in with her instead of getting his own place or living in the Manor as the de facto head of the House.
The week went by quickly. Between Little League practice, starting the Archive Studies course at the College, and the readings that came with the course, Harry had little time to himself. He’d cracked open one of the new books Malfoy had lent him—a Muggle science fiction novel with robots on the cover—but hadn’t made much headway with it. He did chat with Malfoy at the archive when he could find a spare minute; with the spring semester starting up at the College, the Archive was seeing an increase in patrons and Harry couldn’t skive off work to chat with Malfoy as often as he liked.
category, which was a dumb, undefinable category with a host of uncomfortable connotations attached to it.
Draco looked mildly terrified that he was going to be left alone with Dean and Seamus, but he asked for tea and took a seat. Seamus asked for a refill and Harry fetched the drinks, going for a tea for himself as well. If Draco wasn’t drinking he wasn’t comfortable getting inebriated himself.
“You three.” Harry turned to Charlie, Alice, and Avery. “If I give you a Quaffle will you go outside and play nice?”
minutes late. There’d been a conflict at the daycare, which had delayed everyone, parents and children alike, and eaten into Harry’s lunch hour.
“Yeah, no, yes, it’s okay. I just hadn’t expected—look what you’ve done. You’ve gone and made me fall in love with you more,” Draco said, voice rough and terrified.
“Yes, well, I think this argument has rather soured the experience,” Harry bit back, a dark coil of anger and hurt unfurling in his stomach. “I was fine, I didn’t want to fight, but you just had to—”
“Don’t try to understand it,” Padma said. “I’m a Ravenclaw, by the way. I’m not part of this Gryffindor-Slytherin thing.”
“I have it,” Malfoy said, fishing the folded piece of paper out from a hidden pocket and handing it over.
“They really do,” said someone from behind—Blaise, accompanied by Gilliam, Pansy and Padma. Pansy was holding her hand in such a way that nobody with functioning eyes in their head could avoid noticing the very shiny golden ring on her finger.
Harry signalled to Faulkner that everything was in order and the game resumed. The Snitch had vanished, Anthony scouting after it diligently, the other Seeker on his tail. “You did good,” Harry said to Alice as she was being checked out by the Mediwitch. “You would’ve gotten it if not for that Bludger, I’m sure of it.”
“Yes.” Malfoy drew out the little black notebook from some invisible pocket or other and extracted a folded request form. He unfolded it slowly, then held it in his hand as if he wasn’t sure whether to give it to Harry or not.
Harry’s insides flipped and the familiar black feelings started roiling in his gut. “Yeah. It’s no big deal—I’m fine, really.”
“No, I mean…” Draco trailed off, frowning. “How do they…” He gestured. “That’s an offensive question, isn’t it?”
“That’s great teamwork!” he called out, jogging out to meet them. “I’m glad to see you’re all getting along!
Harry took the slip, but before he went to fetch the documents, he walked Malfoy through the rules and restrictions. They were much the same as for the reading hall, but there was greater personal freedom to be had. “Grad students often get one of these for their dissertation research and writing. There’s one in the room next door.”
Ginny didn’t ask him again for what remained of the practice, though she did continue to shoot him speculative looks. As soon as practice ended, and the last child had been whisked away by a parent, she caught the Snitch out of the air before Harry could get to it. The Bludgers had been secured already, but the Snitch, as always, proved elusive, even when charmed to stay within a limited parameter.
Three things were happening at once. The brooms were all unresponsive and dead on the ground, all five kids were crying, and a tree was on fire.
“Are you coming to bed?” Ginny had withdrawn her hand, Harry now realised. She’d crossed her arms, and there was a small wrinkle on her forehead, the kind that usually meant she was concerned about something or was about to get upset about something—usually Harry and his reluctance to sleep with her.
Unpacking went slowly. Between Ginny’s long days with Quidditch practice and Harry’s two jobs, neither of them wanted to spend all their free time dealing with finding new places for everything. Boxes stayed piled up in the living room, and two weeks later were still largely untouched. Harry never uncovered his books and rather feared they’d ended up in the charity shop pile somewhere along the way.
“No, I want to celebrate in the pub,” Harry said. “Everybody is there. And I want to talk to Oliver.”
Harry's nerves were fraying at the edges, in the middle, and everywhere in between. Three months of practice and games and more practice had led to five victories out of six games: they'd made it to the semi-finals.
She leaned in to whisper. “We could go home first. I’m in the mood for some insanely celebratory shagging.”
Malfoy’s eyebrows rose almost comically high. “Are these things actually magic? I have to ask, because I’m not sure I understand why anyone would want to sit in a bathtub so often and for so long.”
Harry wasn’t sure what he meant, but he nodded anyway, still munching on the scone. It was better than talking. Draco shifted, their legs knocking together, and then manoeuvred himself across carefully, until he managed to slot himself between Harry’s legs, his back against Harry’s chest. Harry automatically put his free arm around Draco’s waist.
The rest of the day passed in a haze. He retrieved documents for other patrons, helped Fraunces catalogue a collection of letters from an apothecary, and thought about Ginny every second he wasn’t thinking about shorthand, or which order the letters should go in.
“Yeah.” Harry bumped his shoulder against Draco’s. “I told them you and I are dating. Kinda had to, after that picture got in the paper.”
The moment Harry walked in with Draco there was a loud crash from the corner by the window. Looking over, Harry saw a broken cup in a pool of tea on the floor, and two girls at the table staring at the two of them. A member of staff came over to clean up the spill.
He led him down the same hallway that lead to the reading hall, but this time he turned to the last of several short hallways on the left, each lined with two to four doors. “We have a bunch of vacancies at the moment, and I got you the corner study,” he said. “It has two windows.” He turned down the furthest of the short hallways and stopped at the farthest door on the right, and opened it.
“So you will quit your studies and your job at the Archive,” Draco said, when Harry had momentarily stopped talking to shovel in the last bites of his dinner. Draco had finished his own a long time ago, by virtue of having been eating while Harry had been talking his mouth off.
They nearly collided with Ginny in the doorway. “Oh!” she said. “Sorry—Harry, you dropped this.” She gave him the team notebook, the one that held all his notes about his players, game plays, and everything. “Uh.”
“Hullo,” Harry said in greeting the moment Malfoy came through the front door. He’d been waiting for him to turn up; he’d already been filled in on his new rota of tasks and seen to two of the research rooms and all that was left was Malfoy. “How’s our favourite murder boy today?”
Harry wouldn’t mind if he came over all the time, to the extent that he never left at all, but Draco wasn’t there yet. And even if he did move in, Harry was sure he’d still spend Tuesdays at his mum’s. And even…well, Harry wasn’t sure he wanted Draco to move in so much as he wanted them to move in
?” Harry asked, pausing at the threshold, such as it was. The inside of the barn was dim, though less run-down than it looked on the outside. It didn’t smell like cow dung at all—in fact, the only thing Harry could smell was dust and wood and dirt. The floor was a dirt floor, packed tight from centuries of animals and people walking on it, and just inside the large doors were a work bench and tools and several half-finished pieces. Fresh wood shavings littered the floor.
“All three of you need some of this blue for your cards,” he said, pointing at the paper. “The paper is this big.” He demonstrated with his hands. “Can you think of a good solution to this problem?”
But it wasn’t about him, it was just a book, a fiction. Teenagers waging a war that their parents were unequipped to deal with, suffering heavy losses to take down corruption and injustice and coming out the other side victorious.
“Uh—” Harry floundered. It didn’t have to be, no, but he wasn’t sure this feeling would last, and if he waited then maybe it’d be too late and—
What kind of question was that? Harry’s brain stalled. Get back together? Maybe if she’d asked—no, it didn’t matter. She was right: he hadn’t fought the break up. He’d let her leave. Amidst all the heartache, he’d felt
He had meetings with Faulkner and Pomeroy, he put a notice in the Prophet for team try-outs (and then took it out already the following day when he’d received more sign ups than he could handle), he finally secured a sponsor for brooms and another for uniforms, he held try-outs, he formally signed the team up for the League, he chose a charity (well, three charities) to support, found a venue to train the team at, he did…everything. And he did it without Ginny’s help, even if she was supposed to help him. She was supposed to be there, and she wasn’t.
Dean and Seamus cracked up, and Lee bumped Harry’s shoulder with his fist. Harry grinned at Draco, inordinately pleased—not just that Draco had claimed him, but that he wanted to, that he was here, that he was doing his best to joke along with Harry’s friends.
“Quidditch Little League,” Lee explained. “It’s a new thing, not terribly official. I hear the grand prize is a trophy made out of chocolate. Oliver is setting it up with a couple of lads he knows, all professional players. It’s a charity thing.” He grinned. “Don’t you have a little team?”
“Not as hard as I thought it would be,” Draco said. He put his hand over Harry’s, stilling his fingers. “I—thank you for not judging me,” he said. “I was terrified when I first brought my anxiety up, but you just…took it in stride. Didn’t ask questions or looked at me differently. It felt safe.”
“Okay, if you don't want to talk to me, you don't have to,” she said, frowning, “but you're clearly not okay. I still care about you, you know. That didn't stop, just because we…” She gestured between them.
They stayed like that for a bit, but then Draco pulled his feet out of Harry’s grasp and clambered over to kiss him instead. “I’ll find you a different romance novel,” he said. “Something with a secondary plot and no Black Moment.”
Harry considered this. “I’m not sure I understand. Edwarde is…he’s not a good person. He’s just not! So far, he has ignored his fiancée—and okay, maybe one shouldn’t get engaged at fourteen—robbed a jeweller’s store, tamed a Granian, and started a revolution, and I’m only on page 73!”
A good number of the captains were—or had been—professional Quidditch players, but the rest of them were a mixed bag of known personalities. Harry didn’t recognise anyone, aside from one person who he thought might’ve been a cookbook author.
“Hi,” Harry said, awkwardly. “Uhm.” He glanced at the other girl. “I, ah. This is Draco. My boyfriend,” he said, practically dragging Draco in front of him. “Draco, this is, uh, Peony, my cousin, and—”
He couldn’t say he’d said it without thinking. He’d said it deliberately, to hurt, to shut Draco up.
“Mmh,” Ron vocalised, around a mouthful of sandwich. “What else is new in your life? You and Malfoy getting hitched soon or something?”
Harry made it into the kitchen without fainting (a useful skill to have; thanks a lot, Aunt Petunia) and made toast. He had jam on his toast, a lovely blackcurrant and lime preserve with star anise that Draco’s mum had made last summer, and as Harry slowly munched through it, with the taste of sun-ripe berries on his tongue, the light-headedness went away.
For a long time, Harry didn’t say anything. Neither did Draco. The bowls emptied, little by little, and Harry was acutely aware of all the things that hung in the air between them.
Ron shrugged. “There’s not much else to say, is there?” He speared another dumpling. “Unless there’s more to say?”
They went over every single bath bomb and bath melt in the store. Harry stocked up on his favourites and Malfoy carefully selected a small number of bombs to take home and try out. In addition to the rocket-shaped bomb, the rain bomb, and the Quidditch bomb, as Harry had dubbed it, he also had a galaxy bomb (peppermint, vetivert, and cedarwood) and a robot-shaped bomb (lavender and chamomile). The basket was bulging; Harry had never actually made such a large purchase before, preferring to come in more frequently to just get what he was in the mood for.
Draco had pushed his food aside as well, and was twisting his hands instead, so Harry reached over and took Draco’s hand in his. He had nice hands, strong, slender fingers, but his palms were rough. Harry didn’t know what to do to help calm him down, or what exactly was wrong, but something wasn’t right.
“Much as I enjoy sucking dick, I don’t enjoy it when the person whose dick I’m sucking doesn’t actually want me to be doing it,” Draco snapped. “That does rather sour the experience of it.”
Harry knelt by the broom, running his hand alongside the shaft. The broom was very much alive; he could feel the low thrum of magic when he focused on it. It was only playing dead. These brooms typically weren’t temperamental, and generally not prone to hysterics just because small children happened to say things around them; it was more likely that it was picking up on something in Charlie that he hadn’t communicated out loud.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat and then floated all the way up to his throat. “Yes,” he said, grabbing onto Draco’s hips. “Please.”
“Now that’s just not true,” Harry told him, using his best and most patient voice. This one usually worked. “This is just a bundle of twigs. It’s not alive like you and me, it just flies about and does whatever you want it to do.”
“Sometimes I read,” Harry said, going over to grab a ball of sunshine, the one he used for the rare early morning bath. “Sometimes I just want a break.” And sometimes he had company, when he could get Ginny to join him. There was a pink bomb with jasmine and rose she liked, that Harry was now eyeing. He had one left at home, that they hadn’t had the chance to use before Ginny left.
Harry stared at her. The realisation that she was right came crashing over him and abruptly he remembered what Gladys had told him about patterns—
It was easier to let the tears come under the warm spray of water, where he could pretend he wasn’t crying at all and where it felt like all his ugly mistakes washed away.
“You’re welcome to come over sometime and look at the horses,” Seamus was saying. “Harry’s got a standing invitation; that includes you.”
“Thank you,” Harry said. He had only one big pocket, and it was currently holding a large paper bag full of bath bombs. He put the book down there with them. “I…appreciate it?”
, which Harry decided was ultimately a good thing. Those receptionists were supposed to be friendly, welcoming, and able to make the patients feel calm. At least that’s what Harry thought, only rarely having actually been to the dentist. “How can I help you today?”
“For company?” Malfoy asked, reading the label. “Jasmine and clary sage are both an aphrodisiac, though jasmine is also a stress reliever. Interesting that they paired it with rose and ylang ylang…” He made a small assenting noise. “Or perhaps not; this seems like it would support a soothing, sensual and romantic atmosphere.”
His reading was definitely getting faster now that he was doing it regularly. It also helped that the books were good; he agreed with Malfoy that the detective and the wizard should definitely be boyfriends and made a note to pre-order the sequel with Flourish and Blotts the next time he was heading that way. The second he was less sure about, but felt he needed to finish the book before he could really talk about it.
? Harry chanced a look at Draco, something he’d studiously avoided all this time, and saw he was hard. That was even more confusing; by Harry’s reckoning, if he was in the mood then…that was
“Er—this is a payphone. I don’t have a telephone.” Harry frowned. “I could give you my address? I receive mail the ordinary way…you could send a letter?”
Strange, thought Harry, watching him go. Both Malfoy’s choice of reading material and the detached way he’d spoken to Harry, as if they were...strangers. Interacting with Malfoy in the past had usually been coloured by annoyance and alcohol, even when they’d been civil—and on rare occasions, even friendly—and this had been anything but.
“No.” The trials had gone on for two years. Harry had done his community service in between testifying—every week he’d had to show in court again—and most evenings he’d been at Pansy’s parties or in bed with Ginny. Those were the years where the exhaustion had carried him through everything. “That was when I started working here, and the year after that I started the daycare.”
“Yeah, an undergraduate degree. I continued with the Master’s and have almost finished it—I’m missing one course and my dissertation—I, well, my mental health imploded, so…” Malfoy shrugged. “I took a break. I think I’m getting ready to go back and finish it. The course I’m missing isn’t offered until summer term, and the dissertation isn’t due until September if I go back now, but I want to…you know. Ease into it.”
Malfoy’s cheeks pinked ever so slightly, and then Harry held the door. A gust of wind stirred up Malfoy’s hair as he passed through and he waited while Harry locked the door behind him. “I’m sure you have other plans,” Malfoy said.
He didn’t have to wait long; she’d showered quickly by the looks of it and her eyes had that determined look that usually followed a defeat.
“Yes, that’s right,” Dean answered, surprised, if a bit wary. “I’m in marketing these days, I design advertisements and labels and that kind of thing, and do my own art on the side.”
“Yes. So anyway, when you come back on Wednesday, everything will be where you left it, but you can also use this simple Charm to sort the documents into whichever category you require. Just hold the categories in your mind as you say the spell, for example Read, Unread, or Maybe Useful, Look At Later, and so on.” Harry showed him the Charm.
—that game had been fun, some decent plays, the weather had been nice, nobody had caught the Snitch, the teams had been fairly evenly matched.
Harry was brought up short. “Which would you rather it be?” The wild hope in Harry’s chest clamped around his heart.
“I don’t think it’s weird,” Harry said. Malfoy’s lip was red. Harry wanted to kiss it. “What’s your thesis about?”
“Yeah,” Harry said. He dropped his robe, trying not to feel self-conscious, and got in the tub. When Harry looked, Draco was unbuttoning his robes with his wand, so he averted his eyes and waited until Draco had climbed into the tub with him to look again.
“After the game,” Harry said. “Uh. Do you want to come? You don’t have to,” he added, his fingertips—now at Draco’s lips—tingling with nerves. What was he doing meeting his cousin? Why was that a good idea?
Malfoy exhaled. “Okay. Good. Sorry, it’s just, you looked like you were having a panic attack or dissociating or something like that.” He put his hand on Harry’s arm. “I’m sorry for asking. It’s clearly not a safe topic for you.”
“Do you know which position you want to play?” He remembered her being fast—as fast as one could be on training brooms, anyway—and thought maybe she could be a good Seeker. He hadn’t tried the kids on a Snitch, though. Not yet.
Harry took Draco’s hand again. “Hang on tight,” he said, taking a deep breath. A swish and a pop and they materialised in a narrow laneway, scaring a cat and two pigeons. “You okay?”
Harry hesitated. He’d taken this job only to have something to do, and greeting people and fetching documents and occasionally helping with the cataloguing seemed as good a job as any other. Learning the actual ropes? He’d never considered it. On the other hand, he might need something to do after spring, if he ended up closing the daycare (not that he wanted to close the daycare).
Harry considered this. “Kind of,” he eventually said. “I think for me it was more…slow. Like…Dean and Seamus came out
Harry stared at the small stack. The topmost book had a black star strewn cover, with a large non-earth like planet on it and a space ship in front, and the title printed in large silvery letters.
He sent her off, and while Betty, Hugh and Avery were occupied with either watching Alice zooming between the apple and pear trees at the edge of the field, Charlie got his own broom to obey.
Malfoy didn’t even pause in his work to get a bite of food or a drink from the small café that was attached to the Archive’s western wing. Harry headed down there himself around three to fetch a sticky bun and a cuppa.
“Sorry about that,” Harry said. “It’s, uh, we shouldn’t really give patrons nicknames, but you’re…because of the coroner reports,” he tried to explain, “not because of, uhm, the War. I mean, you didn’t kill anyone. Directly.”
“Not at all…” Malfoy fished his little black book and pencil from his inside pocket. He scribbled something on a blank page, then tore it out to give to Harry. “It’s a small clinic, run by three therapists. Muggleborns, it’s all Muggle science.”
This wasn’t. And that was the weird thing: even if Harry knew that what he’d been put through wasn’t right, it’d been easy to brush off when it was Hermione saying it. She was always finding something wrong with the world, something to fix, something to feel sympathetic about. Malfoy saying it…Harry had once considered him a nemesis. They’d hurt each other, tried to kill each other—for Malfoy to say it, it was making it all real in a different way.
“Let’s get out of the kitchen.” Harry slipped the outer robe off completely and draped it over his arm, knowing that if he dropped it here it would also bother Draco. “Bed?”
. The words had burned themselves into Harry’s brain and wouldn’t leave. Had Ginny really been that unhappy with him that…it’d come to this?
“Yes. Yes!” Harry was. He wasn’t being very good at it right now, but he did see that they needed to go over the formation again. “Let’s pause and show them again?”
“I’m glad you came,” Harry said, and kissed Draco again. His left hand had somehow found its way to Draco’s neck, his hair tickling his fingers. Harry’s thumb brushed over Draco’s earlobe. “What are you doing after?”
Harry stared at her. “Traumatic experience?” His brain shut down. “Like—like rape?” Nausea filled his throat. It couldn’t be—Ginny would never—that couldn’t be—
By Friday, Harry was looking forward to being able to just go home, run a bath, and sink into it for a few hours. He wasn’t going to the pub; he had reading to do and this weekend the Little League had a press event—the first games weren’t until the following weekend, but Harry had to make an appearance with the other teams’  captains for the kick-off event and photo ops with the sponsors and charities.
. Something that got him excited, something that felt meaningful in a different way. Something that wasn’t dusty and about preserving history, about posterity, something less steeped in questionable methods and practices, something whose history didn’t include cultural theft and colonialism—
The meadow painting was sunny and a few butterflies Harry was certain he’d never seen before fluttered over the grass. They were a bright blue, bluer than the sky and brighter than the sun, and too early in the season to exist.
Malfoy slowed down. “Something about getting you some books. You said you wanted some of your own the other day, and I thought…” He gave a little half shrug. “It’s a terrible excuse.”
They took a couple more shots throughout the evening until they fell asleep. When Draco woke up Harry had already left. He dragged himself out of bed, dressed, and went to work.
Cell phones had been gaining popularity in the wizarding world. They were faster than sending letters by owl, and the recipient didn’t have to be home unlike with the floo network. But Draco didn’t have a phone. There was nobody he wanted to talk to.
When he had been walking for just over an hour he started to regret not bringing any water and wondering if he could dip behind a building to conjure some. Then he heard a familiar voice.
Harry’s eyes widened. Of course Draco wasn’t entertaining muggles. These were undercover wizards, though to what end he wasn’t sure.
Harry had to clamp his jaw shut to stop himself from gasping. Draco was entertaining muggles. They were playing muggle games on enchanted-to-look-like-muggle furniture. There was a dog on the couch. Didn’t Draco hate dogs?
When bright light shone through the window signalling the end of the morning, Draco finally awoke. He tilted his head to smile up at a softly snoring Harry and gently nudged him awake. When he finally noticed the sight in front of the couch his eyes bulged.
His fine leather boots clicked on the cobblestones as he stepped out into the chilly night air. He paused for a moment before turning away from the direction of home and walking to the end of the street, silken cloak swishing behind him. He stepped into the black shadows beside a closed shop and swiftly punched the jagged brick wall. His hand made an unnerving smack against the stone and his knuckles erupted in bloody spurts. He could easily have healed himself before losing even a drop of blood, but he did nothing to fix his injury. Instead he focused on the pain, willing it to overwhelm the guilt clawing its way into his throat. He leaned his forehead against the freezing stone and let out a moan as he began to tremble. Then he rolled over against the wall and let his backside sink down onto the street, ignoring the lustrous fabric catching and ripping against the wall. For once his usually perfect outside could match his ragged inside. He sank his head into his arms crossed over his knees and started to cry.
Fresh rage skirted over Harry’s face and he dived toward Draco, stopping when their noses were practically touching.
“I don’t understand how you can forget about everything at Hogwarts so easily. He used to beam when muggle-borns were killed. You of all people should remember how fucking awful he was.”
“We have something for each of you,” Harry said smiling. “Well, except Hagrid. Sorry, we didn’t know you were coming.”
Just as Harry caught up with Draco someone shrieked behind him. He wheeled around to see the pair he had just fed with grins on their faces. The mother snatched a very shiny piece of paper off the ground and tucked it carefully away in an inner pocket. Harry was sure the ground had been completely clean a second ago. Harry alternately stared at Draco and back at the mother and daughter.
“You’ve seen how Weasle- Ron. You’ve seen how hatefully Ron looks at me when I’m just passing by. How will he accept that we’re dating?”
Draco considered his options and finally said “okay.” He put an arm around Harry’s shoulder and apparated them into his living room. Harry sank into a nearby armchair barely taking notice of his surroundings.
“I’ll speak for myself,” Draco cut in. “I know I’ll never make up for what I did; I was a brat who used every dirty trick to get my own way. I’m sorry. For how much I hurt each of you. I will do whatever you need to prove I’m not that person anymore.”
Draco had to admit he didn’t. The Weasleys and assorted remaining members of the Order were for all intents and purposes Harry’s family. Harry couldn’t keep them separate forever, nor would he want to.
All eyes were on Draco now. He rolled his own and walked to the far side of the pub, barely hearing Ron say “he’s still a slimy git.”
Draco’s Harry-dry-spell continued for another booze-filled fortnight. Then one evening he was wrapping up his work, considering again fucking off to the Scottish woods for a bit when a livid Harry apparated into his own office with a crash. Draco strode over to see what was happening. He peered through harry’s open door and found him feverishly shaking with glassy rage in his eyes. Without warning Harry punched the wall creating a sizeable crater.
“Fair point. They won’t be coming over much with the holidays approaching. I reckon I could keep you secretly stashed away while we keep trying to ease them into the idea of your very existence.”
Harry dived toward him and yanked the front of his robes so their faces were inches away from each other. Harry glared down at him, clearly unsure what to do next. His hand faltered and he accidentally ripped Draco’s robes, exposing a lean white torso. Harry stared down in shock.
“Among muggles I’m nobody. I’m a young man with a funny name, nothing more. I can be whatever I choose. Even my dark mark is just an edgy tattoo, not something I have to desperately keep out of sight.”
“Fine, but you cannot leave me alone with them for even a second. You must be present at all times.”
“Well, his dad is in jail for mass-murder and his mother is now a professional drunk, from what I hear,” said Ron.
The whole house was different. There were clearly lots of enchantments to make it feel natural to Draco’s guests, and it had been well cleaned, but there was more than that. When Harry was there the first time the house seemed to shout “stiff upper lip!” but now the atmosphere was comfortable and dynamic.
“They didn’t tell you, eh? I was the last of seven horcruxes. Meaning I lived with a piece of Voldemort’s soul inside me since the night my parents were murdered. I have felt different since the last battle, but I have no idea if that’s because Voldemort is no longer with me or just because that was the end of my adolescence. I feel like a chunk of myself is missing, but I don’t know what it was supposed to be. I don’t know what I’m good at or bad at — I mean, I know I’m good at flying; I’ve done that plenty since then, and I think I’m a pretty good auror, but nobody gives me real feedback, so who knows.”
Draco sucked and used his hands to squeeze Harry’s tight arse. Harry carefully slid in and out, enjoying the friction of Draco’s tongue on his underside. It didn’t take long before Harry spurted his own white ribbons into Draco’s willing mouth.
“You should be more mindful of where your things end up, Potter.” He continued his way to his meeting, trying not to shiver.
In the wizard world the options for games were pretty much chess, or thoughtless toys for children. There was nothing as sophisticated as what was being described to him. He was also amazed by the muggles’ patience for fiddly little pieces. Items had to be carefully placed on the board or you could irreparably confuse the situation of the game. Scores had to be calculated, often in parts, and tracked over several rounds. This wasn’t like Draco’s world where you could simply put a counter in the air and glance at it at leisure. He watched Amanda and Kevin do these things with skill throughout the evening. Perhaps this muggle world wasn’t so simple after all.
The conversation for the rest of the afternoon was awkward, but everybody managed. Draco no longer felt like he was constantly being stared at, and he was happy to focus most of his attention on Dominique whose unbridled joy was infectious.
“Really? It’s just a coincidence I’m the only one with a pile of busywork this high? Why doesn’t Shaughnessy have to do this; we worked most of our cases together?”
“I see how much you’ve changed. I’m sure they will too. With time. Perhaps we can start being friendlier little-by-little when I’m around Ron and Hermione. Ease them into the idea.”
Harry stood up to leave, but Draco stopped him with an open hand held out for his files. Harry handed them to Draco who silently signed them with barely a glance and handed them back.
Draco had managed to keep his feelings on even ground so far. Harry was right - out of the Weasleys Draco had been worst to Ron at Hogwarts and even Ron would tolerate him, however much displeasure the notion brought him. But Hagrid was another matter. Draco was flooded with all the memories of trying to disgrace and remove him from Hogwarts. Hagrid looked back to Harry, all the warmth of his expression was gone. He gave a small grunt and resolutely turned to his plate for the rest of the meal. Very little was said by anybody and Draco was relieved nobody was comfortable asking him a direct question. The chatter was mostly about how tasty one of Mrs. Weasley’s dishes was, or how Bill and Fleur were managing with Dominique.
Draco was relieved to have someone foreign in their company. Yannick made pleasant conversation with the whole table and either didn’t notice or wholly ignored the tense atmosphere.
Draco stared at her. He didn’t know what to do with kids. He was hardly around any, and he had few memories of his own childhood. The few he did have were mostly unpleasant. Dominique pulled herself up, gripping Draco’s robes and held the block up for him to take.
“If you have a problem, you can shout this drivel at Mr. Bathurst directly, be my guest! I haven’t bossed anybody around since school, Potter! I haven’t done anything wrong here, but it makes no fucking difference!”
Careful not to glance at Harry standing nearby, Draco lowered his gaze and mentally chastised himself for not noticing the glaring gold H. He pulled the jumper off and threw it roughly at Harry.
Harry yanked Draco’s hair back and smacked him, but slowed his hips to a gentle grind. Eventually Draco let out a moan and Harry sped up, smashing into Draco, and biting his neck. He paused to flip Draco and bend him over the desk, ramming into him deeper. He spanked Draco as hard as he could and with a final thrust he released all he had and slowly slipped out and sank to the floor exhausted.
“Look, Dominique, zis iz for you.” Fleur helped her daughter unwrap the box. Inside was a set of chunky building blocks that would act out little scenes when assembled into something recognizable. Dominique picked up a block and toddled to Draco, plopping onto her bottom at his feet.
“… That’s right.” They really were muggles. He hadn’t just been recognized. Draco really had a house full of muggles.
Malfoy scowled and righted himself in the most dignified way he could manage, disheveled and covered in dog slobber. With Snoopy pulled off him, Draco took a magically absorbent handkerchief from his breast pocket, wiped himself off, wrung it out, and replaced it.
It took a lot of willpower for Draco not to kick the dog that kept jumping on him. He didn’t like animals altogether and this one clearly didn’t understand its place. He was relieved when they got to the dog park and Snoopy was let free to roam away from him.
Kevin and Amanda continued making idle chitchat, leaving Draco wondering why he’d ever decided to skip the pub.
New tears started to form in the corners of Draco’s eyes. He prayed Harry hadn’t noticed, but this seemed unlikely as Harry stopped yelling, turned on his heal, and calmly walked away. Eventually Draco found some motivation to apparate home and pass out on his bed, letting the blood from his hand stain his white sheets.
Draco stepped in front of his large windows and stared at the street below. People were walking and chatting; children skipped on the cobblestones. Draco wondered what would happen if he let himself fall through the glass. Obviously he could save himself with just the slightest effort, but what would happen if he didn’t? Would anybody notice if he didn’t come in tomorrow? Would the people below try to save him, only to realize who he was and carry on instead like nothing was happening? Would anybody tend to his broken body in the street, or would they just step over it?
Lunch time rolled around and Draco considered nipping off to the pub for a couple rounds because why the fuck not. When he sat at the bar he was unpleasantly surprised to hear Ron’s voice from a nearby table. He got up to move further down the bar away from them, but couldn’t help stealing a glance at Harry after last night. He looked happy. Almost.
Hagrid stared at Draco while he unwrapped the box, clearly suspicious. When the box was open he peered down, unsure what to make of its contents. But his eyes lit up as Draco spoke.
“Mr. Fawcett told me I’d need sign off from the Under Secretary. He didn’t tell me who the Under Secretary was. Did your daddy buy you this job?”
He thought he’d make a better impression if he brought gifts, but gift-selection was an art of which Draco was no master. If the gifts were too unimpressive, they would be insulting; if they were too expensive-looking it would come off as a humble brag. He took his best guess and tried not to dwell on it. Harry liked them because they were kind, right? He’d never spent significant time with any Weasley older than Fred and George; if Ron whom he tormented could give him another chance, surely the rest of his family could too.
Draco quickly ordered and downed another fire whiskey when he heard a familiar voice enter the pub. This had become his custom - days drudging through a job where everyone hated him, evenings in the pub where, well, everyone also hated him, but his inheritance could still buy good service. He would throw back shots until he was just bleary enough that the idea of another night passed out on his bed seemed almost tolerable, and would drag himself home. If he’d thought about it, he would have realized he was bound to bump into an uncomfortably familiar face eventually, but he didn’t think about it. He didn’t think about much these days.
The next work day Draco entered his office and much to his horror found Harry sitting in a chair in front of his desk. Harry’s face fell too when Draco sat in front of him.
Weeks flew by like minutes, then months like hours. Over this time Draco’s whole demeanour softened. He hadn’t visited the pub once since he befriended Harry. He often hummed to himself as he worked. When he passed people in the office corridors he would nod, and sometimes even smile, not caring that many of them muttered feigned concern over his mental health as he passed.
“Ron, I think I dropped my keys outside. Could you look?” asked Hermione. “Harry, why don’t you go with him, we have things sorted in here.”
Draco had his doubts. In school he and Harry were proper rivals. It had been for very different reasons, but both their names were well-known. They were both rich — even if Harry wasn’t raised so — their families both respected, and things came easily to them because of their reputations. There was a sort of equilibrium between them. To Hermione and the Weasleys, Draco was a simple antagonist. He wasn’t so sure they could ever be convinced.
As fogginess cleared from his brain he noted it was Saturday and opted to dress in jeans and a sky-blue t-shirt. They had nothing on the poise of wizard wear, but casual muggle clothes were so easy. He understood the appeal.
The venue this year was no doubt a brilliant idea by the the senior Weasley, Draco thought with a sneer. It was a regular muggle hall in the middle of muggle London. Weasley had just managed an extremely difficult muggle-relations case so the other departments were being very agreeable to his odd interests. The hall kept at least a skeleton staff on duty for each event, so the guests were told to use predetermined apparition points nearby and walk from there. Since they would have to walk muggle London everybody was in their own interpretation of muggle formal wear. Had he been less hated, someone might have commented on how smart Draco looked in his tightly tapered tuxedo.
Draco’s sex-addled brain was struggling harder than otherwise to make sense of current events. Was Harry Potter actually beginning to like him as a real person?
The whole room seemed to hold its breath. That stung. Even as the worst version of himself Draco would never intentionally hurt a baby. He held out his hand to accept the block and the room breathed a sigh of relief. He let Dominique climb up his robes and plunk herself in his lap. He wasn’t sure what to do. He rested a hand on her side so she couldn’t fall over and offered her the block. She gave him a huge grin when she accepted the block and he smiled back. Finally the remaining adults in the room saw what Harry had seen. They had never seen Draco smile. He must have changed.
“I know you’ve changed. I realize I don’t know the new you that well, but I’m impressed with what I see. I like you. I thought we could be more than we were. Maybe friends with benefits? But actual friends.”
“Yeah,” said Harry. “But I wish they’d have taken his soul out on the spot. That guy shouldn’t have the faintest chance of being back in a world with people.”
Usually when Harry had gone to the Weasleys they would tuck in nearly as soon as he’d arrived, but he was used to being the last at the table. This time they had to wait for one more guest. A guest Draco was not prepared for.
“I suppose I could buy another house. I can’t imagine I’d be able to sell this place with my name attached to it, but I could let it rot.”
“A small token to acknowledge the difficult life you led. Especially with slimy gits like me about.”
Harry laughed, then eventually said “how about half boy, half horcrux? Last known address of Voldemort’s soul.”
When Draco opened his bleary eyes the next morning he saw that no traces of Harry remained in his room. Ah, he thought, they were more amicable fuck-buddies now, but still just fuck-buddies. That made sense. How could he have expected anything else?
As Mr. Bathurst left Draco pulled out the instructions and was greeted by a very friendly, albeit slightly baffled wizard demonstrating how to use the phone. The demonstrator took three tries to turn the device on and nearly dropped it when the screen lit up. Draco flipped to the last page and saw his phone number illuminated in a vibrant green. Another way for nobody to speak to him. Just what he needed. He shoved the phone and manual back in their envelope and tossed the whole thing in his desk drawer.
Draco ascended the stairs. When he returned a few minutes later Harry handed him a shot glass and led him into an armchair. Everybody sipped their whiskey and tried not to make too much eye-contact.
“Dr- uh,…. Draco,” he finally said when Amanda thrust her hand out to shake. He was fairly certain this was not a typical muggle name, but he didn’t know of any he could summon on the spot, so his real name would have to do.
“Those are the collected works of your great-great-grandfather. He was a pioneer in wizard psychology. How could you disg-.”
After preparing himself for the worst, Harry’s mouth fell open when he saw the Draco that answered the door. He was smiling. Not sneering, or smirking. Smiling warmly at someone inside. And he was wearing muggle clothes: khakis and a white v-neck t-shirt. Draco faltered when he realized who was at the door.
They easily fell into a pleasant pattern: they took frequent trips to the muggle world where they could be seen together without raising any eyebrows. Harry joined Draco at Amanda and Kevin’s from time to time for board games. At work they remained completely aloof and usually called each other by surname to avoid any suspicion. On weekends they shagged like rabbits and occasionally during weekday lunchtimes if the workload was light.
He opened the box and revealed a black jumper with a silver D on the front. It was the first hand-made gift Draco had ever received and it nearly brought a tear to his eye.
He eased himself off Draco then collapsed beside him, putting an arm around Draco’s torso and pressing his face into Draco’s neck.
Harry smacked Draco’s ass and pushed him down onto the desk behind him, removing the remaining fabric barrier. He pulled off his own robes and pushed down his pants to free an erection he hadn’t even noticed he had. Draco dug his nails into Harry’s back. Harry muttered a lubrication spell and pushed himself into Draco’s tight arse, and Draco let out a pained yelp.
“This is for you,” said Mrs. Weasley. “I wasn’t sure what colour was appropriate,… so I kept it neutral,… Draco.”
A moment later the blinds were drawn, the room had an enchanted silence, and the doors were triple locked so Harry could ram into Draco sloppily bent over his desk and his paperwork.
He stepped back form the window and opened his desk drawer. He supposed he could spend the evening setting up his phone now since he was sure he’d get an earful from Mr. Bathurst in the morning otherwise.
“No!” Harry jumped to his feet, clattering his dishes. “Look, Ron, we all have a history with Draco, but the others will at least try to move forward.
“You’re in the department, you get a phone, simple as that. Instructions in the envelope; number is on the back page.”
“Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.” Draco opened his top drawer to let a brush and comb set spring forward. They began tidying his hair and smoothing his ruffled clothing. Apparently he had not been completely forgotten. It was a shame Mr. Bathurst didn’t notice this was the first time ever Draco had been late or unkempt.
Easing Ron and Hermione remained a challenge. Ron continued to glare and Hermione usually opted to ignore Draco completely when they saw each other. The evening after their last failed attempt the lovers were lounging in matching flannel pyjamas. Harry was sprawled out on their couch with quill and newspaper puzzling over the crossword. Draco stepped over Harry to curl up beside him, brandishing mugs of hot chocolate against the blustery November weather.
“That is the first ever encyclopedia of dragons written in English. It was a gift to an ancestor who imported magical animals. I’ve enchanted the pages to be oil- and water-resistant so you can actually read it.”
Harry wasn’t sure what he expected to gain from visiting Draco, but after seeing him help muggles he had to speak to him. To see if it was part of some nefarious plot, or if Draco had been murdered and replaced by someone using polyjuice potion. He was glad he’d paid attention when leaving the house the last time or he’d never have been able to find the place. Harry couldn’t exactly ask someone for Draco’s address.
“Why don’t we brighten it for tonight?” Harry enchanted the room to be less bleak: he replaced the peeling wallpaper with sunny paint, modernized the huge bed, and made the moth-eaten rug look whole.
Their arrangement, however, was still a precarious one, at least for Harry, so it naturally came with its share of hiccoughs. One unseasonably chilly afternoon Draco was rummaging in his desk for a sweater to fight a draught blustering into his office. He pulled out a maroon jumper he didn’t remember seeing before. He shrugged, assuming it was a forgotten muggle-safe garment he’d tossed in there in case he had to venture out on a cool day. He pulled it over his head and left his office for his upcoming meeting. He had only taken a few paces when he heard “Oi!”
“Come on, let’s get cooking and let these two get organized.” Ginny pulled Ron with her by the forearm. He resisted, but ultimately had to give in to her surprising strength. The other two slowly followed leaving Draco and Harry to climb the stairs and dress properly. As Draco walked he noticed his bottoms hanging particularly low on his hips and realized how tightly he’d been squeezing his muscles. He tried to take a calming breath, but he could not undo the knot below his ribs. Draco had barely started moving things from his previous address; all he had with him were muggle clothes. He pulled out a pair of black jeans, a lilac t-shirt, and a beige cardigan. He felt extremely underdressed. Everybody else would be wearing robes; this would be his first time in wizard company when he was dressed to anything less than the nines. He supposed he could probably fit Harry’s clothes, but it might be more awkward if someone at the table recognized his garments as not his own.
The tension finally eased and everybody else unwrapped their presents. Mr. Weasley examined the muggle board game he unwrapped — “you mean the players have to move all the pieces themselves? But there are hundreds of them! Astounding!” Mrs. Weasley cooed over an ornate device that looked like a globe spinning in real time. Instead of countries it had pictures of her family members’ faces and would count down to their birthdays, as well as holding their favourite foods, colours, and a handful of other preferences.
The whole table was mulling over Draco’s words, but the next moment was the key to making them sink in. Harry was gazing lovingly at Draco. And Draco was smiling back. Not sneering or scowling; smiling. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny had never seen Draco smile. He looked like a completely different person.
Harry put his glasses on the side table, then sat on the bed, slowly undressing. Draco undressed as well, and kneeled on the bed ready to spread on Harry’s command. To his surprise Harry gently pushed him onto his back and continued to kiss him. When Draco was throughly flushed Harry lowered his head to Draco’s throbbing erection and teased it with the tip of his tongue. He traced little swirls over Draco’s creamy thighs and hips, and finally took the length in his mouth when Draco started to twitch.
When the games ended and the guests were leaving Harry offered to help clean up. Draco nodded, unsure what to expect. Harry didn’t look like he needed a shag, but what else did he ever want from Draco?
Harry took a few steps closer and saw the blood trail from Draco’s hand. He muttered a healing charm and watched the broken skin reform. Draco turned to face Harry. He stared at him with dead eyes as he balled his hand and punched the wall beside him as hard as he could, undoing Harry’s work.
“Half of my friends died with the help of your family, your father’s friends! You’ll have a damn hard time getting any sympathy from me for your shitty, snivelling life!”
As he picked up the envelope a napkin scribbled with ballpoint slipped from his t-shirt front pocket.
Draco nodded, but wondered to himself how he could get out of it without cutting ties. This was a little too deep into muggleness for his comfort.
Draco was immensely glad he and Harry had been too tired for sex the previous night, seeing as how they never bothered to dress before falling asleep. In fact it was a fairly common occurrence for Draco to wake up to Harry sucking him off, so all in all this situation could have been a lot worse, though it definitely could have been better.
Draco gave a curt not, then turned away ducking behind the first building so he could apparate home. He made a mental note to be extra careful to actually end up alone next time he ventured out.
He tried to drown out the noise with fire whiskey, but failed to make a dent in his perception and cursed his high alcohol tolerance.
Nearly a quarter of an hour had passed before they returned and everybody sat down to eat at the round kitchen table. Harry sat down beside Yannick and Ron immediately took the chair on Harry’s other side. Draco wasn’t sure if this was a slight or an oversight, but he tried not to dwell on it either way. He sat opposite Harry.
One evening at the end of a Harry-free fortnight he knew that Harry was expected to wrap up a particularly difficult case and thought he’d stick around to be Harry’s punching bag, but when 8:30 rolled around he decided it was time to give up for the night. He choked down a plum and a few bites of crackers and cheese — the bare minimum dinner he figured he could eat to avoid starvation — and considered where to go. He didn’t fancy going home — now, or ever, but particularly now. He thought of apparating into a secluded park and wandering aimlessly until he had only enough energy to get himself home. He picked a spot in the north west of Scotland, but as he was about to apparate, a precarious ink bottle fell off his desk and surprised him. Distracted, he mistakenly apparated to a residential London street.
The dark wallpaper had been stripped, the doilies were removed, and the heavy curtains had been replaced with airy pastel fabric.
“Actually,” Draco pulled a neatly wrapped box out of his leather shoulder bag and floated it to Hagrid. “Sorry, it was a bit rushed.”
“Come on, Ron, he works in Harry’s department. Don’t give him a reason to make life difficult for Harry.”
“So, will you tell me what happened, or are you going to make me guess?” Draco asked, sitting on a couch facing Harry.
After a long pause Harry finally said “I was arresting one of your dad’s cronies who managed to fly under the radar until now until he got bored and tortured some poor muggles. I wasn’t prepared for how unrepentant he was.”
