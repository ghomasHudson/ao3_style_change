"Draco Malfoy!" Tom looked shocked.
Remus shook his head. "Only in form. They are entirely a magical manifestation of violence, with any thought or will borrowed from the hatred left by the dead. A Kneazle is closer to human."
"Distracted by your pretty boy?"
"Harry," she called, as he stepped through the portrait hole. "There's room here!"
"Look, about tryouts...."
Dumbledore's dry comment broke the mood, somewhat. Harry snorted.  "Oh, they didn't listen for long. They're probably as afraid of me as of you."
"Of course, Harry," Draco answered, emphasizing Harry's first name ever so slightly. He rose gracefully and crossed to the fire. When he reached over, his arm nearly brushed Snape's filthy hair, but he extricated the kettle without incident, and poured the water into the teapot that Harry had prepared.  Afterwards, he went to wash his hands.
Harry couldn't hold back the laugh. "Sorry," he gasped. "Curses for tots, damn!"
, he thought.
Sunday was a brewing day, but Quidditch practice both Saturday and Sunday morning had left Harry with a lot of schoolwork to do. He cast a cushioning charm on the floor and worked, rather than socializing, through most of the time that the potion was simmering and cooling. Millicent's schedule having been similarly busy, she was happy to do the same. It wasn't until they were ready to leave that they began to actually talk.
of. I can imagine situations where I wouldn't care
"But let's finish, first."
"Excuse me?" Draco asked.
"An unspecified future favor."
mad with imagining it? I haven't done anything at all sexy -- they
"I see," Snape replied with a sneer. "Yes, I think this one will be a natural for you."
Harry would get himself killed approaching people whom he would regard as allies. He decided that if I'd been sent by a nymph, sex-magic would be the best way to reverse it...."
"Oh, dear. So many stories make more sense now."
He caught her on the street, walking towards the Leaky Cauldron.
Beside Harry, Draco nodded, as if to himself. Across the floor, Lucius Malfoy managed to look disbelieving and offended.
"Oh, lovely! There's a marvelous new place down Fortune Row called the Grand Game -- you'd love the rabbit confit."
"Out."
"Good morning."  Draco sounded slightly amused, as he often did where other people might be cheerful. Harry sometimes wondered if his fifth-year self would hear it as mocking. "I can't open the door, I'm afraid -- Severus's doing -- and probably won't be able to enter when you do -- that would be Mother's."
Hecksban nodded. “Correct. And this is what we’ve been fearing. Until we find the anchor, I cannot lift or break the curse; it is not
"Have you had your first Flying lesson yet?" Harry asked Sammy, and Sammy had made a face.
Ron's eyes narrowed. "Off being Head Girl, and don't change the subject. You hid out with some friend of Malfoy's, didn't you?"
He braced himself. "Don't say unicorn blood."
"Mm. Good."
"Well, it rather undermines our credibility, doesn't it? In our own houses?"
"Complicated," Harry said. "But most recently, he helped me undo the curse."
Right. Harry?"
"Well, yeah."
Malfoy looked politely incredulous.  "What about the French Veela?"
"All right!" Harry said quickly. "Enough of that." He opened a butterbeer and cast a quick warming charm on it. "Ron?"
Gryffindor," Draco retorted, the usual fiery spike that Potter brought to his thoughts overcoming any conversational posturing. "They will all be humiliated if he is carried off like a rabbit."
"Probably."
With a snarl, Snape came to his feet. "Because she can see reason!"
"That works for me also."
"I think I'm set with that," he lied.
“Foolish,” Snape sneered. “You would all eat it in stew without a second thought.”
"I'm coming along," Draco said.
she repeated, horrified.
"Oh. Yes, of course."
Taken aback, Harry frowned for a moment. "Sort of," he said.
my face changes to the motion of your tongue. (I'm so hard, Harry --
Snape looked around the room with notable suspicion, but Dumbledore, in contrast, had a slightly questioning air, which Draco ignored.
"You think so, do you?"
She twitched. "Right. So you're mad, but you're supposed to be." She frowned. "Snape knows too?"
of those things, she made one additional suggestion -- that someone
He caught her point, but was annoyed enough to go along, and they left by the huge French doors onto the patio. Indeed, the garden behind the ballroom, though not summery like the nuptial garden, was magically warmed. It had also clearly been designed for winter color. Past the white marble benches and silver trees, straight shoots of dogwood flared from orange up to red alongside white gravel paths that curved out of sight. Closer to the door, red berries clung to silvery branches on two trees, each set in a circle of glossy green ground ivy and curved white marble benches. Amongst the natural color, hothouse flowers were arranged in pink marble urns, lending ephemeral beauty in the unnatural warmth. Harry had no doubt they would be dead by dawn tomorrow, after the party ended and the warming charm lapsed, but for now, they were lovely. He walked with Esmée, her arm through his, down one of the curved paths, out of sight of the doors. He hoped that Snape, as well as Draco, had
Best wishes,
"Just in Gryffindor."
"We could meet again this evening," Hermione said uncertainly.
The witch's house was a grey stone cottage with larkspurs blooming by the gate. An enormous grey cat greeted them just as they stepped onto the garden path, and wove between Harry's feet, purring loudly. The door opened as they reached it, and Snape pushed forward to enter first, his wand drawn.
"I must not tell lies," Snape read. "In something close to your horrific first-year penmanship. Tell me, Mr. Potter -- how did you get this?"
Harry didn't think he would have made any sense of that if Draco hadn't emphasized the last word with a tilt and press of his arse. Harry locked his mouth on the back of Draco's neck, both intensely turned on and struggling not to laugh.
"I'm not taking your risks for you, Potter. I haven't even figured out how to get what I need myself."
"Gryffindors are bold about it," Eugene corrected, settling at Malfoy's other foot. He glanced at Harry. "Watch."
submission to my pleasure.  You, of course, are wide-eyed and shocked,
"Because that doesn't make any sense!"
"Later. I will not speak to you now."
He brought his hand out and looked at it. It was fine.  Shrugging, he put his head through. He couldn't see anything.
"Hm." Millicent considered. "I can see some point, if you were told both and then had to choose."
he wrote,
"Ron!"
Astoria looked dramatically askance at him. "And I thought you were good to Muggles."
"Nonetheless. As I am yours, you are mine."
"Course," Harry answered, standing up. He grinned at Seamus, who was trying unsuccessfully to muffle a laugh, and Parvati who was managing an almost convincing concerned expression. "Catch you two later."
"What?"
Harry had found the words for this with Draco. "Because people are more important than games."
Harry looked at her incredulously, his brow tightening. "What?  Hermione, disguises could be critical to my survival. I can't always use Polyjuice, you know."
"I think being paired with you was a piece of good luck," she confided in his ear. "Would you mind missing a dance? We should talk."
"The trainee colors for my side," Cornelia answered.
"I doubt she's your
them."
They were coming up the last curve of the drive, and he still wasn't sure why Draco had wanted him to meet this girl, but Draco wasn't leading the conversation. Instead, he snuggled contentedly into Harry's side. "This isn't enough of a reunion. Let me know when you're done meeting your Head of House tomorrow?"
"And it might be just as well," Harry said quickly. "You know how I can get when I'm in a sulk. Look," he added, as her face started to fall, "let's study together after lessons."  That, he hoped, would keep any conversation to safe subjects.
"And she
"Professor Dumbledore might be doing something too.  I mean, he and Snape were both gone."
"Which does not convince me that this could work."
"That would be great."
"And getting me worried about your balance for the last two weeks?" he demanded furiously. "I was
Linnet frowned. "Does she have children? Oh, yes, there's a girl, isn't there? Older than us, and rather clumsy."
"Oh. Um, when I said 'made from champagne,' I meant '
"None."
She sniffed. "Searching for
"Yes, yes, while the iron is hot, and all that, so no need for it now!"
Ron crossed his arms, but his glare was for Harry.  "And you skipped lunch because...?"
He had been carrying the money since morning, but on his one trip down to Snape's office, had found the door closed. After that, other things had distracted him.
"Mm. In other news, you really should try to be back on your feet by this weekend."
"But I didn't come by Floo. My guardians are Muggles, you know."
That's what this is about. She and my uncle didn't like having freaks
"Linnet?"
"Would you like to take his place?" Harry invited, his voice low with contained lust. "I want more. Come here."
Snape glared at Harry. "What a curious time to begin obeying rules, Potter."
In contrast, Harry's shrug was pure nonchalance, dismissing the issue.  "You can compete just as well with women, I'm sure."
"What?"
"Take it off?" Cornelia asked, as if the concept was absurd. "Oh, you can't do that! It's permanent."
"There. Now, you will stay precisely there until we have finished, so the Tendon-mend has time to work." He smirked. "It will be a much needed lesson for you, considering your usual active style of magic use."
"But they believe you?" Hermione asked eagerly.
that I learned to tune out before I was attracted to anyone."
In the clear air above, the sun was bright and the breeze frigid. Looking down, he saw what appeared to be pools of blue water, impossibly stretched from twig to twig. Certain these were the skyberries, Harry dropped down to hover above one.
"Oh." Harry felt his face heating. "Well, I didn't realize, then, that the wizard-raised students weren't as bothered by it, mostly, and--" His voice caught.
She sighed. "Obviously."
me as a boy, but we'll always be natural rivals, as boys."
Harry shrugged. "There is most of the time. A lot of people know it, though, so he'll set it to something else while we're here."
"He will hear if you call. I'm certain of it"

Harry took a deep breath. "I just want to talk to you privately," he said.
"-- and only if you promise not to do anything we wouldn't do."
"I take over Slytherin; you take over Gryffindor," Draco repeated, as if this were simple. Harry sat up. It hurt.
"Pansy, as most people, is aware that we
Julian laughed. "Love the name!" With a sunny grin and a deferential nod to Draco, he shook Harry's hand, and then stepped past to hold his hand out to Susan. She and Caradog had arrived a few minutes earlier. "Good evening, Miss Bones," he said, bowing over hers. "A pleasure to see you. Socially, I mean." He hesitated. "This is socially, isn't it?"
"Hm. Well, if you're taking this one for twelve weeks--"
"Ah." She nodded. "All right. Rather harmless, really." She hesitated. "Mirrors aren't expensive for Muggles, are they?"
"Well...." The question was so wrong that she couldn't think how to answer it. "I help him with research, of course, but it's not part of some
Harry raised his eyebrows. Draco looked sidelong at him.  "That is, er, twice?"
Tonks and Shacklebolt looked at each other.
"Oh, hello, Tom."
“Ten points to Gryffindor!” McGonagall. He was on a bed, with the sudden, welcome weight of a wool blanket keeping him safe, but shooting through corridor after corridor in a searing cloud of pain.
Or he tried to. He felt the warning tingle of magic -- through his hand from the chair's arm -- an instant too late, when his weight was already back off his heels. The seat of the chair met his descent, and pushed him forward and down. He twisted enough to narrowly avoid the table, and set out his hand to protect Susara, who was tightening around his arm. His hand and hip, and then elbow, hit the inlayed wood of the floor hard, but he could feel his pet, alarmed but safe, tighten around his triceps.
"Can't win without cheating, Mill?" he snarled.
"Stable for how long?"
"But it ought to be a Slytherin," Padma reminded her, gently rolling the green and silver bead in her bracelet. "And I could say Blaise, but only because he's clever with theory, which is a Ravenclaw trait."
Uncle Vernon roared.
"Right." Ginny showed Susan bracelet. "We were playing a parlor game; you can't tell anyone outside this room about it.  Someone said he'd never stolen from a Muggle girl, and the people who had -- that's Harry and Cornelia -- had to take a bead."
"Anyway," Hermione said firmly. "Back to the divinations. We are here to review what you've done, what was said, and what you
Ginny offered her hand again, and Millicent took it. "Weasley," she said, but politely enough.
"Oh yes," Harry said, pushing back up so he could return one of his thumbs to exploring Malfoy's crack. With the other, he fumbled for lube in the bedside drawer, found it, and got a squirt out, glad of the convenience of dispensing charms. "Much better for both of us, I think." Perhaps in agreement, Draco pushed back on his now-lubed thumb. Harry growled and twisted it in.
Mr.  Parkinson. He's the one who attacked me. I don't suppose I can press charges?"
Harry tensed. "Neither of us is a girl, Cecilius."
"I do hope you're better protected than you seem."
"I thought you were avoiding me too."
Harry couldn't keep from thinking of the way Snape sometimes seemed to like him -- a cool, almost mocking approval, with just a touch of connection. Draco, also, had his father's shifts to remember. Harry wondered suddenly if Draco was afraid of losing him that way.
"It's always ambiguous. 'Miss Weasley' isn't, but it makes feel like everyone's treating me as a child. It will have to be Ginny."
A year ago, Harry might have taken that as a haughty pureblood's coded refusal to speak to a Muggleborn. Now, with rather more experience with Slytherins, he decided that could just be an opening to negotiate. "Seventh-year girl with bushy hair," he said brightly. "She'll be the Gryffindor surrounded by more books than a Ravenclaw. I'd be happy to help you with a spell in return," he added. "Anything assigned in Charms or Defense Against the Dark Arts."
She snorted. "Good, but not good enough. He shouldn't get away with that."
"Another?" Ron asked hopefully.
"Oh!" She looked startled by that. Draco nodded.
"Still, he's selling himself short, not demanding what resources he can. As are you. If you're each only taking what scraps the other has left, neither of you is getting what you most need."
"Because you hate her!"
"Excuse me?"
"He is extremely powerful, and, in some, inspires devotion. If you truly do not wish him harm, I suggest fuller disclosure in the future."
not too deep. No, you use me when you need numbers work -- one of the many things that makes me indispensable to you. Here! I have an idea."
"Does that tell you it's possible?" Snape asked, and Harry steadied as his professor's voice took that idle tone he used when coaching Slytherins.

This time, Ron's
"Go ahead."
"Air Crash in Sumatra?"
Ron nodded. "Well, good. That sounded uncomfortable." He hesitated. "So, I know you want to make this about destroying You-Know-Who, but I think we should look at the more immediate threat."
"Well, yeah. Though if he'd been a bit less authoritarian about it, we might have cleared Sirius that night." At Hermione's glare, Harry sighed. "Don't get me wrong. It was
He stopped, not bothering to hide his trepidation as he looked up to meet Malfoy's eyes. That was right, wasn't it? If he'd truly been through that sort of curse, he would be feeling just as vulnerable as he actually did, right now.
," Hermione said firmly. "For example, with plants. And Neville, really, you're no worse than normal with charms, once...."
"Oh, you know how Voldemort is. He couldn't just curse me; he wanted drama. What good is a basilisk if you don't use it?"
"Veritaserum resistance potions," Draco said.
"My!" she exclaimed appreciatively. "Are you sure you won't take your shirts off?"
"I'll hear it," he said.
The bird in question was folding its massive wings in front of Harry's plate. Imperiously, it thrust one burdened foot out towards him, black talons stretching out below the parchment.
for sweets that make them break out in spots and vomit,
He paused at another picture of their mysterious young man, and then shook his head. He was distracted; this was someone else. He had darker, curlier hair, and a rounder chin. But even as Harry listed the differences, he saw what had caught his eye: that fleeting lost look, replaced by hard scorn. Hair color could be changed even without magic, and glamour or creams could soften the lines of a face. Mannerisms were harder to change, especially ones keyed to emotion.
Millicent scowled, in a way that Harry would have found distinctly hostile a year ago. Now he was fairly sure that it just meant she was thinking hard.
Harry bit his lip. "We've shared secrets," he said. "That's one."
"Gryffindors," Draco growled.
Harry stared at him incredulously, and Draco's sneer dissolved into a sigh. They were a good distance from the castle, now. "When Professor Snape talked to the house last night, he said that you should be regarded as a potentially valuable resource, and as such, were to be considered as under his personal protection."
Draco shook his head. "You can't protect every square foot of something that large. Traditionally, one concentrates on the entrance, and has a sequence of them, as he did."
Draco sighed. "Please fuck me, Harry," he said, with theatrically breathy desire.
"SHIT!"
"Oh," he breathed. On himself, that didn't feel like
"So you're not entirely an idiot," Mill snarled.
to learn your personality! I know you are an arrogant, bullying, reckless fool, who returned to school as a murderous creature, knowing the risks you posed your friends--"
"There was very little blood in the first ritual," Harry said. "Just a few drops, but he predicted Nott would murder someone that night, and he did."
The invitation gave off a bright sound of ringing bells as Harry tilted it, reading the elaborate gilt script. "The Malfoy Yule Ball, apparently."
"Oh." Harry shrugged.  "Maybe. But he might invite her and she might not accept."
He hadn't really been planning on that, but maybe it would be a good idea. Ron wouldn't be there ignoring them, at least. "Great."
"But what if it's messy?"
"Oh, don't!" Harry exclaimed. "I hate that." Looking at Ogden's haughty sulk was giving him a strange feeling of being out of his own body. It took him a moment to turn the impression into a thought.  The boy looked everything and nothing like first-year Draco Malfoy, making him seem too small and far down. The connection lent Harry some empathy. "Voldemort's a mixed-blood, you know."
They slid the cylinder back in the wall and rejoined it with a repair charm, and moved further down. There was room for only one of them behind the bed.
Draco gave a small, tight shrug and poked at his mutilated egg. "Can't."
"They're fifth years," Harry said. "They'd be impressed by sofas and some butterbeer."
"Angry?" Snape suggested. "Defensive? Yes, probably. They've picked up on the idea that you are an out-of-control mess."  He shrugged. "By the end of the week, you will no doubt be a healthy young lad having a bit of fun."
"Because I dated a girl for two months?" he hazarded.
"Will be
"I think Mudbloods are rather interesting," piped up one of the fifth- or sixth-year boys. The one next to him twitched.
"I was

seemed like a better idea to get out early than to wait for an
"Sorry," Harry said. "Guess I'm not much of a bodyguard."
"Does she have connections in other houses?"
"Gilbert--"
In a few paces, he was at Harry's side. "Mr. Potter.  I'm afraid we need you to answer a few questions."

from Death Eaters.
"Grey would be best."
"Ah, it's fine for you, Harry, but 'tis a different matter for those of us without a Slytherin lover."
"I don't care," Harry said stubbornly. "Not if I can stop him."
"He was after you?" Mason suggested.
“Oh, you
"I cannot
"This one," Draco said, "is the least Dark. The base potion is not Dark at all, and the components were fairly easy to procure. As the diviner, however, you would need to draw Harry's blood -- not much; a prick of the third finger should do -- and drip it into the base potion for the scrying."
"I can't stay long," Harry apologized, as he set down his bag. "Gryffindor drama."
"I know he bullied you -- more than me, even. That doesn't mean you should bully him."
"Well, yes, but we'd never met. I suppose she saw me when I was a baby, but you must remember that she had spent most of my life in prison."
Harry looked at Draco and shook his head.
want?"
"Not with others coming," Draco returned.  "And in any case, I still have reservations about him."
"As long as it isn't our Charms assignment."
With a brief puff of breath, Snape dismissed the matter. "I am not avoiding him, Potter. And I have yet to have an account of the letter. If I feel we need to talk privately later, I will send you a note this evening."
Snape waved the matter aside. "This is Albus Dumbledore we are talking about. I would make no assumptions. He often approaches things with levity."
Afterwards, they lay together, sprawled in a loose embrace, until Harry's charm began to fade and the floor grew hard. Sighing, Draco pulled his left arm out from under Harry's neck, and Harry his right leg from under Draco's left.
Ron's eyes darted to Neville and then away.
"Exactly. You have only one term left here, Harry, and your short excursion showed the dangers of departure. However, you are not yet mature enough for the role of professor, and I will not offer you even the Defense Against the Dark Arts post."
homosexual?"
"Why lavender?"  Millicent asked, squinting at Cornelia's bead.
"People might start wondering about your bat being several inches from your hand."
"I can't figure out how to make a bracelet without it being too long. I mean, I can't do it on my wrist, and if I make it long enough to get on once it's a loop, it gets in my way."
Esmée took two rapid steps back, Draco's glare following before he pivoted back to Harry. He drew himself up haughtily, orange twigs still hanging off his collar and sleeve.
Draco lifted his head from biting their prisoner's nipples. "Oh, you can go first," he said, "as long as I get him too. Would you like that, Severus?" he said coaxingly. "Both of us in you? Claiming you?"
Others were arriving now. Some people set bags where they wanted to sit first, while others went straight to the food. Harry watched contentedly while they greeted each other and settled.  When the last person had sat (it was Caradog today), Harry stood up and clapped his hands twice, like a professor about to start a lesson.
sort of progress." Snape's lip curled. "I have alluded to the potential threat."
"What? I am entitled to my opinion. You would do well to have friends who keep their own and express them honestly."
The writing stopped.
"But in Dark Arts itself -- well, the few spells I've done -- everything just bursts out. Draco thought I might be drawing power from..." Harry hesitated, gesturing at his scar. Snape hated him saying Voldemort's name. He remembered how he had felt looking at the name he had drawn in the Slytherin Common Room, and wondered if
"So," he tried, "do you think we can consider all the new Uncommon Room invitees safe?"
"Sirius knows Narcissa," Remus said grimly.
be jealous?" The question would have been more threatening if it hadn't swelled with arousal.
I beat him, and while he's probably already told Voldemort, I don't want it being public knowledge that I can cast a wandless Stupefaction hex."
"Just ... just
"Thank you," Draco said. "I'd like to try being your lover. I don't, though, want to be anyone's secret."
"It just feels..... You're still dressed."
He had been unable to keep from watching Malfoy during class. Harry didn't think he was really attracted to Malfoy as a boy -- in fact, he found the thought of doing anything more with him disturbing. Still, he couldn't help remembering what a pretty girl Malfoy had made, and how good it had felt sliding into his slick folds and pumping into him ... and then he would wrench himself from the fantasy and discover he was hard, and still staring at

"You could now," Draco pointed out, which Harry couldn't argue with. He didn't like using things he didn't know the feel of, really. He snapped the tongs against his thigh.
"What?" Remus asked innocently. "Might as well just get it out there."
"Yes, Snuffles, I'm happy to see you too. Now get

were taking an illegal potion--"
"And Malfoy?"
Draco stiffened. "I could pay your standard rate, I expect."
He missed his warm weight for an instant, and then the ridges of fingers were replaced by the broad smoothness of a cockhead pressing against his entrance.
"Mm-hn," Luna answered. "I remember when I discovered that. It was comforting to realize that beautiful things were mathematical too." Her already dreamy gaze grew more distant. "Arithmancy can be very dangerous," she said sadly.
Snape snorted. "I now know one thing that you and your paramour
"Except this," Ron pointed out, with a scowl. "And Nott. I can pay attention if it matters."
"Talk," Ron demanded, as soon as the door closed behind them. Harry glanced down the tunnel. From here, you couldn't see if anyone was in the main chamber, and voices tended to carry.
Snape's mouth twisted. "Of course not. However, the disorientation of being immersed in such delirium should buy us some time. We were in luck Wednesday night; several of us were meeting outside the school when Lupin received the signal--"
"Well, it could be. But I'll promise you the next Christmas, if you want it."
"Case in point. You were also miserable."
to open the Chamber -- everyone seems to know that -- but it takes a Parselmouth to actually do it, and she isn't one."
"I'll do it." His drying and warming charms were not constrained to Harry's shoes, and Harry felt better after them. "And step in here." He ushered Harry into a small audience chamber next to the cloakroom, and set the fire going with a spell. "Brr.  I've been standing in the wind by that gate for ages!" Nudging one of the armchairs closer to the fire, he gestured to the other. "Pull up a chair."
you why he killed him. I heard that much."
"You and Horsyr."
"Why does everyone think I'm so awful for her?" Ron demanded. Parvati surged to her feet.
"I need to confer with my lover." Harry folded his arms over his chest. "And possibly the Minister."
The next afternoon, while the twins were working, Harry took advantage of the offer. He was surprised to find that Polyjuice Potion with Fred's hair wasn't disgusting, just hotly spicy and a bit odd. It was the perfect time, he decided, to return to Gringotts and get the money he would need for sphinx feathers. He stuffed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, just in case, and headed out.
Harry thrust the stiff snake at Ron, who took off like a shot.
it." He raised an eyebrow at Harry. "She isn't my father, darling. I am expected to make the most of my considerable talents, not to prove that no one else has any."
Most likely, no one was listening to them. There were no portraits nearby, and they were between turns in the corridor. Still, he didn't want to say too much, and she didn't push.
"Come inside, good sir," a voice invited him. "We have the most eager young girls--"
"Really? I thought Slytherin was about results."
"Who was Regulus?" he asked.
is not repeatable." Clearing her throat, she pushed the second strand at him.  "Very well, Harry. I find your explanation -- scant as it was -- sufficient. You may go -- but do continue to spend adequate time on your class work between games. "
Harry felt a surge of relief lessen a tension that he hadn't known was there. "Will I?" he asked, reaching out to touch the side of Draco's face. Draco closed his eyes and leaned into the touch.
Harry thought they would go to the Uncommon Room, but Draco led him to the storeroom. Ten minutes later, they were sitting on their plastic sofa in the Chamber of Secrets.
shy."
Snape's face scrunched in as if he had bitten into a lime. "I hardly think it necessary--"
Streams of paper shot out of Draco's wand as if raining down on a parade. As he twirled it in little circles, they curled, one into another, to make a chain.
"Good, good," Draco answered, nodding. "The Ministry could use more public servants who are genuinely helpful. Did you get his name?"
"I wish I could say things half as well as you do."
Harry winced. "Okay. So...."
Hermione glared at her. "With all the time Harry spends with Slytherins--"
Gilbert waved acceptance.  "We'll see you tomorrow, I expect."
"Of course it is," Harry answered, rolling his eyes.
"We've brought people without everyone's approval before," Harry argued.
Confused, Harry turned and looked at her. "Why on earth would I?" he asked, surprised into normal volume.
"Later, Snape," Harry said.
She nodded. He knew she would know more about it than he did by the end of the day, which made him think he should have talked to them before.
"Mm," Draco said finally. "You quite wore me out."
"We'll get them back to you," Harry promised.  He turned questioningly to Draco. "You wanted ivy?"
."  A hard chop of his hand toward Harry illustrated the second point.
"You're sweaty."
"I see." Dumbledore didn't seem in any hurry to answer. "I had expected a different inquiry. Is that all?"
"What?" Confusion pushed out suspicion in Draco's queries. "Why?"
"Oh -- yes! Please."
"I know we're not the well-behaved sons --"
A familiar giggle came from the drain in the floor. Harry jerked back. Moaning Myrtle shot out of the drain in a silver blur.
That settled, a number of people returned to looking at Harry and Draco. Seamus whispered to Millicent, who snorted, and Draco's cheeks flared with pink. Obviously everyone thought they had done it, rather than pussyfooting around like a couple of nervous virgins.
"Hermione...." He moved close again, slowly this time, and stroked her back. "He
"You'd better return me, then," Harry said boldly.  Only the potion kept him from flinching when Snape whirled on him, his lips pulled back in a snarl.
Slowly, he nodded. "I couldn't imagine it at the time, but yes. Dumbledore?"
"You'll be fine," Draco said firmly.  "Harry will get you past everyone and up to your dormitory, and guard you until the visions stop. They're not real, and if one is, he'll protect you."
"Probably a good idea. Do you know where Draco is?
"Hi," Harry answered.  "Sorry to keep you waiting."
"Ah." Draco sighed. "It's the library for me, I'm afraid -- at least until practice."
Everyone was over by the sideboard now. There was a moment of silence.

Nott hesitated. "He used to be dependable," he said.
, and we have devised protections, and Harry has, of his own accord, decided that the value of this action is worth the remaining risk."
"Having spent several days with the person in question," she said, "I won't dispute your language."
However, just as he reached the Common Room, Creevy burst in. He was covered with drying mud from his right hip to his feet, with patches of it splattered over his upper body. Harry dashed over to him.
"Does anyone want wine?" he asked. "We have a Vouvray, and claret."
"Please be more exact."
you.  I don't see anything else that could get him."
"Me?"
Dumbledore's head came up sharply. For a moment, he was silent. Finally, he sighed. "True. It was not my intent to create that association. I had grown used to them; they happened to be close at a time when I was alarmed. Do sit, Harry."
July 26, 1997
“But long enough,” Draco added. “More than an hour.”
"You didn't?"
, Harry realized.
"Well, yes. It's rather stupid, really."
Snape lifted his eyebrows. "The point is preserving your life, Potter, not muddling your Quidditch skills."
"But she still won't be here."
"Oh." Harry felt his cheeks stretch from the smile that overtook him. "Yeah. Still want to." His fingers moved deeper into her hair, wrapping around behind her head to pull her into a full kiss.  For a moment, they lost themselves in that, before drawing back to the quieter pleasure of looking into each other's eyes.
"Ah." Harry nodded. "Yeah. I remember how far I got trying to explain that I had
"You know how I am at Potions! Archibald does our interaction checks."
Draco snorted. "As if Snape would stick to that. I bet he applied some logic to it too."
Curious, Susara circled behind the mirror and then back in front of it. She didn't seem to notice her own image. Harry brought his hand to the surface and touched his fingers to their reflection. He could feel her understanding. It reminded him of light returning as the sun emerged from a cloud.
There was no help from Draco, who tensed and looked at Harry pleadingly, clearly willing him to not complain. Snape looked coldly amused. Eyes flashing, Harry turned his back on Narcissa, and instead focused his anger on the chair that had upended him. Under his breath, he muttered a detection charm from October's work in Cursebreaking. He could see the curse, he was certain -- a muddy red that followed the grain of the wood. The upholstery and brass showed no taint of it. Ignoring the others (Narcissa was speaking lightly, and Draco quick and low), he stepped close in and stroked one wooden arm. Again, aggression rose up to his touch. The curse responded so readily that he thought he could easily draw it from chair's frame. Unfortunately, that was only half a solution.  Though originally mild, the curse was old, and soaked deep the wood. If he just moved it to some other piece of wood and stopped there, it would spring back to its home. Whatever he transferred it to would need to

make his or her judgment in haste. By that point, Harry guessed an hour to have passed, and "haste" was the last word he would have associated with the proceedings.
"Right," Harry said, overturning the basket and setting the platter on it. "And anyway, since when would two bottles of
"Oh. Um -- so I was sent into another world," Harry said. "And the people there tried to send me back, but I ended up in
"What, having you to myself for two weeks? Of course!"
"Yes."
"Ah."
Hugh came half out of his seat, but then -- slowly -- sat back down. Pansy was glaring at Blaise. Harry thought no one quite wanted to call Blaise out on the implied characterization of Voldemort, because that would make it explicit.
The man who was Sirius shook his head. "
"An invitation." Harry sat down on Ron's bed, across from Neville, who was sitting on his own. "Draco and I have a mixed-house social group. It's been going for about a month now, and we've decided to expand. We think you'd make a good addition."
"'Kay."
"Hm." Millicent's small eyes darted from person to person. Harry wondered what she was evaluating. Seamus had the fewest beads, with one, but Blaise and most of the girls had only two. Draco was only missing only the green he gave to Harry, giving him five. Cornelia, Gilbert, and Harry had three.
Harry didn't know where to start. He wasn't all that sure how the Muggle courts worked, and his only sense of Wizarding trials was what he had seen in Dumbledore's Pensieve during his fourth year. Certainly, Dumbledore was far more qualified than he to get Lucius and his cronies thrown in prison for the rest of their lives.
sort he usually likes to kill, though."
“However, intensity doesn’t always correlate to destructiveness,” Blaise pointed out. “The second-highest in intensity was the glow spell.”
Zabini looked up, and the nascent welcome on his face turned to disgust. "Get lost, Weasley."
"No, of course n--" Draco frowned. "Well, in the last few weeks. Perhaps...." He hesitated again. "Perhaps since -- Well, I'm sure I did once in October. But he's
"Very good," Harry said, taking it. "So you gardened at home too, I see."
"No, it's--" Harry didn't want to explain that he wouldn't have been allowed to play, even if his cousin had owned the game. "My cousin was the sort of kid who'd upend a board game if he wasn't winning, so he didn't really learn any of them, and didn't like them."
"Draco," he said. "It's good, okay? Really good. It's just hard to explain."
"You're wasting your time," Zabini protested. "But go ahead. It's not a bad precaution."
"Yeah?" Harry asked. He rocked forward, pressing the side of his cock against Draco's arse. "And this?"
it would be."
"So eloquent, boys."
"So he knows about you."
To Harry's amazement, the Slytherins did, indeed, take notes. Snape pointed out to Harry that 'cordially', while generally indicating good will, was a mimicry of the official invitation, and therefore non-committal. Draco observed that acknowledging that Harry's ancestors had previously attended Malfoy events was somewhat of a concession, while the oblique mention of Harry's maternal line a reminder of his blood status, and as such, a tacit insult. Snape wondered if it was significant the Narcissa not mentioned her own line, the House of Black.
"Exactly," Draco said darkly. "Them. Do you remember?"
If you can't recall what Harry is talking about, I recommend chapters 10-12.
"As you volunteered nothing, I wanted to observe you for a little longer."
Draco looked around, and Harry did too, at the bright green moss, and dark green leaves, and creamy white blossoms. There was a bench under the arbor. A fairy thumbed her nose at them and dove under glossy foliage.
that is?"
"Zabini. He's been friendly since last spring."  Harry decided to push ahead. "You know, since the House Cup."
"He was addressing you as an adult who is capable of discretion."
Malfoy's eyes opened and he rolled onto his side, off Harry.  "Oh."
"You shouldn't have!" he heard the boy say fiercely, behind him. "He's a Gryffindor!"
Harry laughed.
"Um ... Should we go?"
Hermione didn't sound pleased. Harry stopped a few steps above the third floor landing and schooled his face into a neutral expression before turning.
They decided on long, curved beads for the signals, to increase skin contact for the warmth that would alert them to a summons. They communally agreed that would be better than the bead lighting up. The challenges of
"So," he explained, tapping a biro against his leg and trying to picture Miranda as an adult, rather than a child not old enough for Hogwarts, "I suspect St. Mungo's can't help you until the Death Curse is out of the way."
Harry
Harry sighed. He would never figure out the potion on his own, and the others deserved to know why to be suspicious. It wasn't being hasty.
"I had Ron to counter her, and he was first. Then there was the team. I wasn't friends with Hermione until after Halloween."
Sighing, Draco took Harry's hand. "Because this room is magically connected to one on the second floor," he said. "Now let it go. Come." He pulled Harry towards the Quiris, and Harry went. Cheefi's fur was as soft as he remembered. Hermione released a soft breath as the nearly-white Quiri swung onto Harry's lap, and Harry rubbed his face against his mane.
"I'm frighteningly aware of that. But in the steeple...."
"Agreed," Draco said. "We have a considerable volume of the substance to experiment on, and I can get use of one of the potions labs, although not a key to the supply cupboard." His sour mood lifted into mischief. "Who's up for some investigative potions work on a Saturday morning?"
"I didn't agree to this, you know. I don't think I want--"
He opened his eyes to her puzzled frown. "The curse isn't on
Gilbert frowned. "So since you were a Muggleborn--"
"Well, I suppose it's my turn," she said brightly, already reaching for the beads. "So -- I've never wanted to submit my research for publication."
"Hi, Kingsley," Harry answered, trying to sound ready for business. "Problem?"
"I thought you didn't want to be seen."
"He was still a girl when I left." Sighing, Harry stepped forward. "Is that it? I mean, are you okay with the rest of it?"
information. Perhaps Potter would even give his servant a look at the Gryffindor contrivance in return for his assistance.
Harry had to watch her freeze, and then unnecessarily force a smile. "Rest," she said again, and whirled away, grabbing Draco's wrist in passing. The door shut behind them.
"I'm hoping not."
Hermione bit her lip. Ron shrugged.
"Sorry, sir."
"But I wonder if you are letting your obsession with Harry Potter overrule your sense of strategy. A Contrivance that targets only the opposing Seeker is of limited use." His mouth tightened. "You may want to defeat Potter, but I want to defeat Gryffindor."
Ron waved at the bowl. "Dump them. I never had any control over that."
at him? "Oh, that's just persistence. Draco and I together are hard to refuse."
"Well?" Gilbert drawled from his armchair. "I'm quite breathless with curiosity."
Dear Draco
"I just thought we should talk," he said casually. This clearly wasn't the place. Slytherins and Hufflepuffs were passing by, and some of both scoping out the encounter in passing. Harry wondered if Millicent had used his last name out of habit or to establish distance. "Come for a walk with me?" he suggested.
"And?" Harry demanded furiously. "If you were a boy, I'd--" He stopped. "Look," he said, more moderately, "how would
"Oh, neither was I. I got him away, of course."
Harry shrugged. "Boys, men, women, Centaurs, House Elves...."
"Any mention of Peter will damage our credibility, Harry. You must remember, he is known to be dead. Such a maneuver would increase our chances of losing the case without much hope of helping Sirius."
She sighed. "Okay."
You're welcome to join us for lunch, if you want. I just don't want to deal with your
Draco smirked. "You got Ron Weasley to run a message for me."
of a problem. I've generally curled up and been miserable."
"You weren't acting like it last spring!"
"Oh?" Harry didn't doubt it, but he wanted her to understand. "If
"Can I see them?" Ron asked.
Draco's incredulous look was answer enough. "Yes, Potter. Actually, I probably would have done it just for the sex."
"Sorry, but yes. When anything is afraid of you, you're terrified of what that says about who you are. You need to belittle them into insignificance."
of them."
In the end, with only two fifth years under consideration, they decided no schedule changes were needed, that two signals would be more urgent than one, and that they would have a short meeting on Monday night for final decisions on proposed members. Those items settled, the members of the Uncommon Room began the important work of adding to everyone's beads.
Harry
"Good, because I think I'd need a Stupefaction hex to stop."  Draco eased out and pushed in again, spreading more of the lube. The next thrust was smoother. "I can hardly believe I'm doing this -- that you're letting me do this."
"Another what?" Draco asked, his nose wrinkling.
"Well, I've just--
"Ah. Anything of use?"
"Think of it as a picture of what you're leaving."
Harry sat. The arrangement was oddly social. It made him think of the first stiff interactions with Narcissa. The headmaster, however, had not distracted him with a cursed chair. Dumbledore seemed equally at a loss.
With a lopsided smile, Millicent nodded and took off her robes. Despite the weather, she was wearing a loose short-sleeved shirt under them. Her trousers, at least, looked thick and warm. Harry found the frayed edges of his glamour and dispelled it with a flick of his wand.
"Regulus?"
Millicent grinned. "Ha! Your problem is that I know it too."
"Don't mock. It doesn't suit you." Draco swallowed. "I don't want to lose him, as I did my father."
Biting her lip, Millicent nodded and put the bottle on the table. "Blaise? Help Malfoy keep an eye on the booze. Oh, and take some. I'll risk keeping hold of my glass."
elated, expecting you to be impressed, or at least amused, and
"Really?" he said, leaning back against the now-closed door panel - for safety as well as a pose; no one could come at him from behind.  He flexed his arm slightly against the length of his wand. "I'd heard a rumor that Snape implied I could visit."
Slowly, Dobby's eyes opened, and he nodded. "Dobby will do as Master Harry wishes," he said. "Is there anything else?"
She laughed. "Your new clubhouse?"
"Perhaps because they
Harry thought that he was expected to laugh, but he couldn't manage it. He forced a sickly smile and stuffed some toast into his mouth to obscure his dismay.
"Indeed." Dumbledore settled back, but his eyes shone, and his voice slowed with satisfaction. "An excellent choice. If you wish supplemental instruction, please feel free to call on me. I believe my training in the matter is significantly different from Professor Snape's."
look different. Still, there was nothing for it but to stand across from the man and produce a flawlessly even "Good morning, Professor."
, Harry wanted to protest, but he could see that this wasn't the time to try to convince everyone. "All right then. It's just residue of his spirit in my scar, but something triggered it."
"A bit big, isn't it?"
"So," he asked, trying to sound merely curious, "how long is 'not permanent'? You never said."
"To developing skills," he said dryly, raising his glass in toast.
Ron looked about him at the comfortable furniture and small tables. "Right. Seamus said something about this."
"Oh, how lovely!"  Hermione said as surveyed the spread.
"All right," Thornton agreed easily. He frowned down at the pile of stripped uniforms. "Are you certain the Gryffindors are targeting by color, sir?"
"Because it is!" Fred added.
"True silver. My great uncle Stephen had the best hair. I think it will be."
"Well, the ball itself, yes, though only some of it seemed that way." Harry looked back down the stairs. "Look, want to go somewhere and talk about it?"
Dean looked away. "Yeah." He took a deep breath. "Sorry. I wasn't thinking." He cleared his throat. "Still, if they start talking to Slytherins that young, they're bound to pick up bad attitudes."
Harry laughed. "Look at it this way," he said. "All my ability to play unfair, I'm saving for the war, okay? I'll cheat to put one over on Voldemort -- not on a bunch of kids who are mostly younger than me."
"Let's discuss it when you leave school," Sirius said.
"No. Spilled into a small heap. I will know if it is enough."
The door banged open. Professor Dumbledore strode in with a Slytherin -- Julian -- floating before him. The boy was pale, and his leg scraped bloody and swelling, but his mouth set in a firm line.
When Harry woke up the next morning, the swirling thoughts in his mind had settled into a path. He needed to ask Millicent for permission to tell Draco about her project, so he could explain what he had done to Hermione without looking like a paranoid loon. Having decided this, he was tempted to try to talk to her as soon as he could -- before lunch, or even before Potions -- but firmly told himself to hold off. He would be meeting her to renew her glamours after he got out of Symbology, and he had the slot after that free. If he walked down to Hagrid's with her, they would be able to talk without fear of anyone overhearing.
"It's almost impossible! I'd have to be revising five hours a day, in addition to doing assignments! So if someone else led her through the critical thinking part -- like helping her make a list of all my known activities -- Quidditch, and my Transfiguration project, and so on -- they might be able to convince her that it was mathematically impossible."
"That's it," said Harry. "Breathe. For as long as you are in my bindings, you are under my protection. You know I'm good for that."
She bit her lip. "Not the Imperius Curse, then."
"I'm afraid you must choose one or the other. Now mull it over while I measure out your potions.  Just let me raise the bed--"
"I have a new approach for glamours."
is what second rounds are for."
"But you're upset."
"So why are you telling me this? I won't be able to lie anyway, so--" The sound of an opening door silenced him. The door banged shut, and footsteps -- two people, he thought -- came down the hallway.
"Ron..." Sighing, Harry rubbed his forehead. "Look, it's not like I
, as we know he isn't involved," Cartwright argued. "He was negotiating the purchase of a bitch during one of the sales, and this is his location during another."
"No, he hadn't...." Harry trailed off, thinking. Draco had often spoken of Hermione as a rival. "I suppose that makes sense."
"Yes. Quite." Snape cleared his throat. "We should discuss your allies and advantages at another time, I think. We may have been concentrating too much on your enemies. For now.... Yes, Draco's theory seems plausible."
They walked.
Harry winked at her, hoping she took it as understanding.  "Wasn't I all right last time?" he coaxed.
the bastard...."
The Slytherin first-year girl from the night before was waiting in the hallway. Harry gave her a smile as he waved her in.
he thought furiously. He felt ridiculous. When he spoke the incantation, the feather didn't so much as quiver.
"Now come here," he said, over his shoulder. Harry approached cautiously. He couldn't see Malfoy's mouth, but his cheek lifted with a hidden smile. "I just want you to touch me," Malfoy coaxed.  "Sit on the bed. Long strokes, everywhere. Don't worry about pleasing me, yet. Just explore."
"Relax, will you? I'm not a Dark Lord." Leaning forward, Harry blew softly along Snape's skin, and the man shuddered. After checking the clock -- had they really been an hour at that? -- he reached for the lube. "Shall we change the pace for a moment?" he murmured, and he stroked down Snape's arse again, exploring the cleft between his cheeks.
"There isn't really anything
"There you are, Harry!" Draco said, stepping forward to give him a frustratingly chaste embrace. "Will you ride with Linnet and me?"
"Oh!" Harry found himself heating at the idea. "Um...."
Draco lifted an eyebrow. "And?"
"It's my paper," Dean stated, standing with Hermione. For the first time in the encounter, Draco's expression soured. Harry jostled him.
This time he got to see the purse of Cartwright's lips.  "It is relevant to the investigation," he said, "that before slaughter, the birds must be --"
"Harry." His voice was uncertain.
"God. I wish I could just drag you off to bed."
"Would he work for the Uncommon Room, do you think?"
be, and other boys matter more to that, as I recall." He glanced past Harry, at Draco.
Malfoy walked back, more slowly. "So ... want that kiss, now?"
Millicent, her own copy of the article tucked inside her robes, left them just inside the Entrance Hall. Ron followed them up to the second floor landing. There, he paused and cleared his throat. "Er, would you like another...?"
"It wasn't poisoned, Draco. I sealed the room when we left."
"Well, the first set isn't so bad. That one is to make changes in my bone and muscle structure -- I'll get slightly taller, and my hips will change, for example. The sources all say I'll be a bit achy through it, but the components are all ones used in healing potions. I still don't want to buy them openly, of course, because no one's going to think anything good of a student needing that many unauthorized healing potions, but that's the worst of it." She took a quick breath. "If I start that in late September, I should be done with the course during December, but as that is also the point at which it can be paused for a few weeks, I plan not to start the second course until after the Christmas holiday."
"Because he's the Boy-Who-Killed-Voldemort," Snape sneered.
“We were just saying that we hoped this week would be calmer,” Harry said, as if that explained things. Perhaps it did. “Though I don’t think it’s likely.”
"It might be subterfuge," he said, shifting uncomfortably on the sofa. "She's avoiding me, but it seems too abrupt to be real."
Hands over her face, she stumbled in her hurry to flee, teetered, and caught herself by moving faster.  The door to her room slammed behind her, leaving Ron agape.
"Oh, she does!"
"No one is required to play, of course."
Harry laughed. "Your alpha. I like that. So off-balance is good."
"Oh." Harry leaned back, belying the way his heart sped up. Would this dangerous topic destroy his short alliance with Snape? "I've become interested in it. Hermione is so ..." He grimaced -- "
"Yes, of course." She looked away. "None so pleasant...."

"No." Snape's voice was suddenly harsh. "Tell me, rather, what you were thinking when you

He's going to testify against his father."
Fred nodded. "A larger group never hurts."

"To do what?"
"How's life with Malfoy?" He tried to make the query normal, but it came out tense.
get caught here. We should always be in this room as briefly as possible."
Draco relaxed more. He opened his eyes and looked up. "How like you," he drawled. "Do trust that I will complain if I am dissatisfied."
"I'm cold," Ron complained. "And it's not ghosts."
"Oh, I was. But--"
"For anchoring the buoyancy charms to--"
"He's always like that, you know," Remus said. "There's no point in being offended."
"About Hermione?"
"Quite," Draco said, with a satisfied lift of his head. "Of course, all we had to fill was a Chaser position, but the competition was productively intense. And yours, my dearest rival?"
Harry shoved hard against him.  "Don't you want to come for me? Don't you want to come down his throat? Gotta watch him milk you with his tongue, like he does--"
"Here," he said, holding out a cup. His eyes tracked down. "One swallow apiece. I can't imagine you'll mind sharing."
"We're going to have that party in June," Draco said, settling next to him.
"Of course it is."
Malfoy snarled before regaining control. "Yes, of course, Potter. You all would
"But you could have played with friends."
"Yes." Dumbledore stood, leaning for a moment on the arm of the chair before straightening. "That, I will do. Thank you all for coming to me. Now, I believe I must arrange a visit to London."
Carla and Hannah had moved to the loveseat between Neville and Ginny’s small sofa and the larger one that Millicent was sharing with Cornelia. That side of the room seemed a bit too Gryffindor to Harry, but as he scanned through, he decided that was partially due to a protective buffer around Dean – Seamus was with him, of course, so he and Parvati were there, rather than on a mixed sofa with Padma, and Ron had sat on Dean’s other side.
"She's not as good with that. Status among her friends is very important to her."
With a hard nod, Shacklebolt stepped back. "Proceed, then."
"Yes," Draco said petulantly, but then he laughed, lying back down on his side, bringing the covers up over his thin shoulder.  "In a trivial sense."
"I had to cast a Silencing Hex on you," Tonks said.
Harry shrugged. "Privacy would have been better, but I guess it was okay. I've no idea why Draco wanted me to meet that girl, though."
Snape thumped a stack of books down in front of Harry's chair and had him put his foot up on it. After a few diagnostic charms, he stalked off, still muttering, to get potions. All tasted -- or smelled -- foul, but that was now reassuring, and the liniment he smoothed along the lines of Harry's ankle provided instant relief.
"Is he back in the Slytherin dormitories?"  Ginny asked.
By now, Harry would usually have turned to directly face Cornelia, ignoring the lower-years. Instead, he watched Sajid roll his eyes.
"Do you want to come down here for Christmas morning?"
"You're mad, Harry. You know that, don't you?"
here, you know."
Harry felt his heart sink. She had done it as a diagnostic, he was sure, and she wouldn't taste anything, so it might help allay her suspicions, but it meant she was treating Ron as a boyfriend again. After their last fight, and her talk with Harry, she hadn't been, and he had allowed himself to hope it would end quietly.
"You certainly should be!"
"Well, it's what he says now." Harry stuck his tongue out at George. "Which gives us a few better things to do when we hide out together."
that someone is involved -- and I will confirm the three professors you
Breaking into a smile, Harry finally looked at him again.  "No. He had a Plan, of course, with a capital P."
"Decided to be decent about it." Eugene's mouth twisted down. "Get back to Gryffindor, now, or I'll have to take points."
"We didn't find anything in the
"That's mad!"
"Oh, Harry." Molly started to reach a hand out to him, and then changed her mind. She clicked her tongue nervously. "I didn't mean to hurt your feelings. I didn't even know that I had."
"Right," Seamus said.  "The rest of us, you know, know to drop Hermione from the set if we're evaluating our ability at Charms, and Harry, if it's Defense Against the Dark Arts."
"She's bringing Susan."
"That would be ideal. It shows caution on your part, and she will infer you are under my influence, which will alleviate her discomfort."
"Yeah. Being--"
"Wonderful!" Harry hesitated. "Could you have something done by three?" Afraid of seeming too demanding, Harry amended that. "I mean, I don't need you to do, but I have an appointment then, and if you can, it would be useful to be able to ask if they were okay."
"Are there any, um, requirements?" Ron asked, frowning at Harry's beads.
"I still have trouble believing Mother did that," Draco put in.
"Yes. You might have trouble with pesky details like "up" and "down," for example."
Draco gave him a sly look. "Do you prefer more
Harry could see the change in Malfoy's body, as limp release turned to active lounging. "Oh, really?"
"Please." Narcissa stood straight. She looked pale and slender against the dark wood and stone behind her. It was easy to imagine that she was frail, but Harry suspected her slight form was no more yielding than a steel blade.
"As Head Girl and Head Boy," Draco said, "we represent the students in general, as well as the two houses most closely tied to the matter."
Again, there was silence, lasting until Ginny smiled brightly at him. "Good enough for me," she said.
"Godfather?"  Yolanda asked.
"That wouldn't matter to mine."
"Clever, yes. Fun, yes. He even knows you're more powerful than him, I expect. But he's a

"Good point."
That done, Harry made himself look heavier, especially in the face. When he was satisfied with his appearance, he extended his hand to Susara.
"I'm not very good," he said awkwardly, "but if you like--"
started it?"
Thornton huffed in an almost Thornton manner, and Draco smiled. His boy's features began to distort, and his body to grow. The magical bonds adjusted, pulling higher to keep the captive's chest raised and abdomen taut.  Draco turned fully and his gaze swept the man head to foot.
"Never looked in that detail," he said. "Not that I want him poking it in our business," he added.
Harry sighed and evaluated the matter.

Draco's tongue clicked against his teeth. "This is what prepares us for 'the real stuff,' as you call it."
Nodding, she stood up. "I think I can manage. Watch this."
to have some manners."
"Of course."  Millicent's brows drew down as she thought. "Harry... he won't. There's nothing like that to get him past believing that he's superior to us."
"I suppose I should go," Draco said, but he didn't pull away as Harry's hands settled at his waist.
"Great. The rest of you get flowers and I get a poison." He laughed. "Actually, I bet that's what Malfoy wanted it for, not some hokey love divination--" Harry's eyes widened.
"Beyond me? Professor McGonagall. Remus Lupin. Alastor Moody, which is what I
"I get to hold you," he said wonderingly, and Draco pressed close, his head under Harry's arm.
"That is one of the things I would like to know.  Don't worry -- you're certainly not a suspect."
Harry thought he should remind him not to talk like that, but it was a marvelous fantasy. He was trying to decide, when Draco turned to kiss him. That was much simpler.
for news. He looked at Ron, who gave him a nod, and they got to their feet and waved a quick goodbye to anyone who was looking. Across the room, Draco stood also, and preceded them to the door.
"Well, I had ...
"Oh, all right."
"Yes."
, not more pleasant."
"They said they didn't trust you and it was for my own good."
"Damn it! You timed that, didn't you?" Harry accused.
"Have you started it?"
Harry stared. "I came here to avoid--"
"They'd be delighted, I'm sure." Harry said "But what about Hermione?"
"But as Draco said, it's all worth thinking about."
Draco's smile faded quickly at the reminder. To Harry's disappointment, he rolled away and sat up.
"I don't read gossip columns."
of us wouldn't have a bead in another house's colors."
Harry tugged Draco a little closer to him. The room had no seating intended for two, so he had settled on a carpet on the floor with his back against the base of a stuffed chair, and Draco was sitting between his legs, leaning back against his chest. Draco sighed and relaxed further into Harry's embrace, and Harry stretched forward to kiss him.
Ginny glared. "Like that counts!"
"I'm not a Weasley," Harry replied, his voice low. "I just grabbed a hair last time I was visiting."
"What did you tell her?"
"Exactly. But first..." She suddenly looked a bit shy. "Um, he -- the one I've never met, of course -- was asking about you. How you were, you know? And I'd like to get to know my other cousin better. May I take you both out to lunch, after we're done here?"
Draco snorted. "The dust probably wore off. Don't buy him more of that."
her, Draco. That's how people make babies, don't you know that? It's not done by signing your name on a
"Very well." Snape scowled. "Was that how you recognized the impersonation?"
"If you like," Harry said, "
"What?" Ron asked, staring at him with honest confusion. "You know, if she's going to run a household, she won't have time to be after the neighbors about humane treatment of ghouls, or whatever her cause of the month is." He sighed. "Mum says she'll settle down once she has a baby to focus all that energy on, but I don't know."
"Oh? I though I just needed to bind you and fuck you."
"We had a lot to catch up on," Harry added quickly.
Severus came silently and copiously, flooding his mouth with thick and bitter fluid.
"Zabini, but only once, by chance."
"Will they have a spectacular row?"
"After school. Not
Harry and Draco looked at each other. "That sounds brilliant, actually," Harry said, even though he knew they could not include Hermione.
"Over Christmas. He's friendly with Bill -- my oldest brother -- you remember how he said 'you must be Ron' that first day?"
"A rupture of blood vessels in the brain. Or heart failure. Or failure of some other vital organ or function, like breathing."
"It doesn't have anything to do with being a man, you know. It's not necessary that you like it."
older than us, you know --"
"You weren't so generous with me."
"She's a
"What of it?" he asked, trying to look puzzled.
"He's not paying for it, though."
Snape drew in breath. "Either she did not consider me a
He shrugged, trying to stay relaxed. "I never got invited to parties."
"Sirius."
"Trouble I went into willingly," Harry pointed out.
His eyes closing for a moment, Draco took a long breath. "Terribly Gryffindor of you," he said dryly, his face turning bland again, "but that, I believe, is a more important secret to keep. The chances of her reporting such an incident are far higher, although it would be done with your welfare in mind."
"No. She was here from the Sirius Black investigation -- no repeating this, you realize -- to ask me for a memory and limited Veritaserum testimony. But after that, she invited Draco and me to lunch, and since the headmaster had approved it, it would've looked strange if I hadn't gone." He took a breath. "Sorry I couldn't get word to you earlier."
"Perhaps, perhaps. Although with Severus, one never can tell. And his support may lose you that of your own head of house."
"Considering recent events," Draco said tightly, "she might have cause to reevaluate."
"Rested?" Harry asked incredulously. "Do you know how far up Gryffindor is? And my room is on the top floor of the tower." As Gilbert smirked back, he realized that he may have been giving them an excuse to change their minds about staying. He had probably done as much as he could here, and the longer he stayed, the more likely that Nott would show up. He looked at Draco, who was surveying his housemates in a bored manner.
"Among other strange speeches, yes. So I believe his uncle was rewarded by means of contriving his release, and Theo has been told this to strengthen his own loyalty."
"What the fuck was that?" Cornelia said furiously, overtaking Harry as he reluctantly spiraled down.
"Like what?"
A strong arm helped him lift up from the pillow, which was scooted under his back.
"What? I thought it was a waltz."
"Oh, he talked to Snape -- Headmaster Prince, rather; your father helped him claim his mother's name as part of the adoption, so I could still grow up with a proper Wizarding one. Then he led me into a trap."
"Still...."
"Oh, Harry!" Hermione said sympathetically.
"What? I'm not embarrassed." Harry looked up at Ron, who was wide-eyed and clearly horrified. "Sorry you asked?" he asked tartly. His heart was hammering. Draco would have to go ahead with it now -- maybe even tonight -- because Seamus, at least, was sure to ask.
"She has a family," she spat out to his scrunched shut eyes. "A mum and dad. Did you think they might make plans? Care whether their daughter was coming home, perhaps?  She can't back out of that, you prat!"
"As long as he doesn't see this." Malfoy let out a loud breath, and then stilled as Eugene began to stroke a pearlescent lotion across his brow. "He'd make sure everyone knew. Probably send that prat Creevy to take photographs."
want." He stepped towards the door and stumbled, pulling heavily where Harry had caught his arm.
Draco's body twitched against him as he held back a laugh. "Got it. I can take a little more, I think. I mean, it doesn't
After a moment, Snape nodded.  The tight line of his lips relented to speak. "I expect you for the review of this lesson promptly at 3, as we discussed."
"Shh," Draco soothed, gentle now. "Lie down. Relax."
The phrase was wrong, Harry thought, but once he realized that the correct form was "Credulity curse", he didn't want to correct it.
before."
Narcissa gasped, and then finally tittered behind an upraised hand, the sound artificially bright. "Could you really? You didn't think of it in time?"
"Draco," Harry said soothingly. "It was months ago. I lived."
"For now, yes. I don't know your history, or what binding might mean to you."
"But it can be," Harry protested. He thought he might be getting what she meant. This was the
Draco squirmed and whined. Harry felt his voice drop into a growl.
Harry expected that to end the matter, but Padma looked intrigued as she leaned forward. "How do we define the difference?"
Harry liked this shirt, but some things were worth sacrificing. "Go ahead."
"Ah." They watched together for a while, and then Hermione came to pull Ron back into the circle. Feeling strangely lonely, Harry returned to Gryffindor tower.
"Is something wrong?"
"Sorry. I must have been crushing you."
Snape cut him off. "Adequate treatment of that subject would require a lengthy discussion. Some other day, yes, but not during my office hours. I can only leave the door closed for so long."
"And I know who everyone will go after," Seamus said darkly.
Ignoring Ron's darkening mood, Harry continued conversationally. "Draco thinks you may have the Sight, you know," he said.
Getting back in bed was easier said than done. He couldn’t lift up on his toes at all, and she had to lower it for him. She applied liniment from a small jar to his lower legs and then pulled the curtain so he could do his thighs and buttocks himself.
Breathless with lust, he reached out to seize her hips.  "Fine with me." If his view of her face had been better, he might have said something about taking it like a bitch, but he didn't feel like risking it, considering. He bumped up against her for a few seconds, enjoying the heat, before trying to go in. It was a bit more difficult from this angle, and Malfoy confused the issue by whining with equal fervor whether he was prodding her pussy or her arse. He finally gave up and found her cunt with his fingers and guided himself in by hand. Her answering cry had a touch of alarm in it, and he forced himself to stop at the top of the thrust.
Susan, who was also a prefect, nodded. "He seems nice."
seems happy enough with me!"
Sirius smiled bravely. "Thank you," he said. "I mean that.  Even if-- well. Thank you for considering it, Harry, really. You're a good man."
"It can't have been that impartial, then."
Harry paused in his story, and for the first time in several minutes, focused on Draco. Draco noticed, and his uncertainty changed to a mocking sneer.
Draco's mouth twitched, but his voice, when he spoke, was hard. "The Ministry took from us, Auror Potter. Dignity, a home, a livelihood, a life. What do you give?"
"Your love can do the same," Ron said conversationally. "But it's also a strength. It's a tree, here. It grows out from you, and people gather around it. You're going to have a rough winter, though -- harsh and mild by turns. Mum always said that brought on colds."
He took the calming breath that he wanted her to take, and pushed all the reassurance he could into his voice.  "I think you'll be fine. But I have a backup plan."
you're not."
busy, as far as I can tell."
Harry felt cold again. He could know any number of people that Shacklebolt would not expect him to. Gilbert, Linnet... He was suddenly aware that more people had dark hair than not.
"Damn it all!" He stomped down three flights of stairs to where a group of fifth year boys were speculating about something related to Quidditch. His boy belatedly noticed his presence and scrambled to his feet. "Creevey!"
At that, Harry had to laugh. Fred and George would be horrified. "Don't take too much," he warned. "I'm rich, and they're not."
"Do any of your friends--"
"And he said. But you should write to her."
"Apparently. Kiss me."
"Yes. And he was trying out for a different position."
Draco set his lips to hold back a scowl. The minor victory of having brought Snape down to using his first name barely penetrated his humiliation. "I understand. Have you any concrete objections, sir?"
Harry nodded. "And looking for Horcruxes. That's the same as the last place. And Ron Weasley -- there's a strange thought! -- had been with you, but he left and was killed."
"Are any of them members?"  Seamus asked.
"DRACO!
"That's fine." She slid her finger -- or maybe fingers, Harry thought -- slowly out of Harry's arse, and let the other hand slide up as she lay down beside him. "Kiss me?"
"Harry, no." Setting her shoulders, she confronted him. "I can't talk about this now. I'm angry, and I'm hurt, and I'm not going to be able to make rational decisions. I certainly don't want to listen to you
Draco did not know what had possessed him to spout innuendo at Potter -- except that there was nothing else one
The professors glanced at them in passing, but Snape’s warning glower was the closest it came to interaction, at least until Petunia’s stiff form had rocked down onto a cot, legs mercifully obscured by Snape’s robes.
Her voice was barely audible, and a faint, sympathetic "oh," came out before he could stop it. He sounded like a girl. Draco gave up waiting for Pansy to take his hand and moved it to her shoulder.
"Sure."
"Yes, but--" Severus let out an angry huff. "I've changed my mind. I want my
McGonagall. We're starting a project next week."
"And that this gathering would protect me," Draco said testily. "All worked as planned."
"Draco talked to me," Millicent said, as she and Harry walked down towards Hagrid's hut.
Draco hissed in surprise. "Yes."
"Well, you won't next time! We need some safer way we can find each other."
Hands on the table, Severus started to rise. "I won't stay here to--"
"Well, that's most of what she's told me. They got on all right, and she wasn't worried about me, because she thought I was in his world. Of course, all that time I thought she was with my Muggle-hating counterpart and was afraid of what he might do to her, and Draco One was equally worried that

without any belief in his own skill. I think you rather can be
"If you must. We did start with a secrecy binding for the negotiations."
"Well, Ravenclaws were no problem," Harry said awkwardly. "One of my housemates has a Ravenclaw twin."
"Yes," Susan said.  "Well put."
"None of that!" Harry retorted. "After that, I think I should stay Harry, even if--" He shrugged, unwilling to say the words. It wouldn't hurt to pretend a little longer. "Hold on." He lunged to hang off the side of the bed and scrabble through discarded clothes. When he raised his wand, his stag exploded from it with no marshalling of memory.  "Miranda," he said to it, "that's excellent. Yes, Draco Malfoy and I may have broken the curse. Give me ten minutes to get home, and then Floo me there, if you can. Oh -- it's 'New Life House.'"
"Your turn, Millicent," Harry urged.
"Oh, after walking in on him in a leather collar and slashed jeans and nothing else, serenading his boyfriend with 'I Want to Be Your Dog', I'm pretty sure which end he favors."
"Really," Harry assured him. "Do it."
"Do wizards
"Is it not?" Snape was still angry. "Potter sweeps in and commands things -- sending the Wizengamot to change centuries-old edicts, and you to pour the tea."
"This is not an Inquisitorial investigation."
"When you were firing spells off at the Muggle offices to see what protections they had? Like that."
letter!" he crowed. "Was his substitute entertaining?"
"Because I was sorry! Hermione, I acted like an idiot, and I basically said we weren't friends any more, and she was hurt!"
Just then, the instructor dashed into the room. His brown hair was mussed, and his robes askew. He tugged them quickly into place and gave the class a quick smile.
"What?" she snapped back.
Draco's face crinkled in disgust. "Veela
was just playing God with potions."
, he remembered, and half-expected Draco to say it again.
He leaned in to kiss the side of Draco's mouth. Draco remained stubbornly still as Harry brushed his lips as far forward as he could reach. Slowly, Draco's mouth opened, but not to turn and kiss back.
Harry sighed. Ruthven had winced. "Yeah." He frowned at Draco. "She threw him out?"
"Which you could do yourself, I expect."
He showed how had snarled at her, and a moment of her dismay, and cut it off.
as Madame Pomfrey was saying I could go, Professor Dumbledore came in with
and then didn't
They had just begun to kiss, and Draco was rocking suggestively against Harry, when they heard a knock on the door.
"Stage one of a six-month sex-change regimen."
Draco was hunched over the table, staring at his wine. "So. In that time ... he offered to help me-- I mean, help him. Draco Three, I suppose."
"Leave dinner with me tomorrow," Harry suggested. "I'll take you from there. Oh -- and skip puddings."
"I think we could prevent that."
She hesitated. "Yes," she said finally, the word coming out quick and uncertain.
"Basically, yeah. I mean, not one I hadn't read about multiple times." Harry shrugged. "So tell me about Skyberries."
"We're not doing anything horrible, Dobby," Harry interrupted. "I mean, it's nothing that Dumbledore would hate, just something he'd rather not find out about, I expect. We're, um, planning a party, and we realized we forgot to get a few things, that's all."
At the thought of his snake, he reconsidered. Quickly, he crossed the street, went up the steps to the patio, and slid into the chair across from Zabini.
"Leaving the tarnish as streaks," Draco added. "That turns out to be important, as is the fact of payment."
"But that's no fun either!" Parvati objected. "Now I know that Harry's fallen asleep in the library, maybe I want to tease him about it. Isn't the point to be become better friends?"
"Much to my delight."
"There," he said. "Shall we check it out?"
? Oh, that's brilliant! We have to tell everyone!"
"Actually," Hermione said deliberately, "some of the best investigative teams in Auror history were Gryffindor/Slytherin partnerships."
Harry looked over at Draco, who was staring, eyes wide, at the dark face in the fire.
"The eggs, though...." Blaise made a face. "There was a wave of food poisoning among children when I was eight that was traced to a doxy infestation in a candy kitchen. When the eggs get in food, they cause horrible vomiting. I didn't get it, but my brother did, and came home from Hogwarts for a few days, because the hospital wing was out of beds."
Hecksban opened a package of colored chalk. Doodling a little house on the board, he continued. "Okay, let's say you've been sent out to a cottage that everyone says is cursed." He added jagged green grass in a line under the yellow house. It was a typical child's representation, with a peaked roof, a centered door, and two windows. "You check out the front door, and don't find anything. You open it and check out the door jamb, and something seems odd, but you can't pin it down and aren't entirely sure it's malevolent. What do you do?"
"Oh, you're gorgeous," Harry said, quite without meaning to.
Gilbert raised his hand immediately, as if he were in a lesson, and Caradog and Linnet followed his lead. Harry supposed that made sense. The sixth years who weren't in Gryffindor wouldn't have spent time with her.
Hermione glanced over as he sat down next to her. She had a book with her, but to Harry's surprise, she stuck a piece of parchment in it and closed it.
They were trying to be quiet, so as not to give warning. Harry was bent over, both hands clutching a wall sconce above, forehead leaned into his elbows, and both slick with sweat. Draco, behind him, was holding his cock tight to get the head in. At the clack of the door and Snape's gasp, Harry twisted his head to look. The man was twisted away, yanking furiously at the persistently open door.
"I'm dropping Potions," Ron said quickly.
After he had left, Harry cast a noise block on the door and lay down beside Draco. "So, Slytherin, how much of that was real?"
"Yes. You did." Harry brought his hand down on the dark lines across Draco's arse, and Draco yelped. "Now, what do you say?"
"Yes. In its purest form. You focus Dark energies into a physical push. The end result, reputedly, is that of a particularly violent Disarming hex."
"Don't dress like it."
that you've done it isn't. Next challenge?"
The name helped. That snort of derision was Tonks. "Yes, of course. I'm letting my frustration get the better of me."
"Two matters, Mr. Potter.  First, while the Forbidden Forest is not entirely forbidden to staff, only Hagrid and the headmaster enter it alone. Second, why should I hover at such heights when I have students who enjoy it at my disposal?"
"Really!" huffed Parvati, beside her. "I know you don't admire me, but you must know enough of my housemates to pick one."
dormitory at night?"
moronic, then. And it may make you less of an enemy to those who formerly had no opinion."
Draco
"Right." Draco Summoned the bowl back from near Ginny, and took a bead.
Ginny nodded acceptance, Padma sniffed in contained amusement, and Sophia called a vote. The new rule passed.
"No." Sighing, Harry sat up. This wasn't going to be settled quickly. "That isn't punishment." He studied Severus for a moment.  The man was all tension again. Except for the oddly clean hair -- ragged, now that it was untangled -- it might have been two days ago. "Flogging you wasn't either, you know."
"The house colors -- both, as exactly as you can manage -- of whichever house you have most often disparaged in that manner."

"I fell for a trap," Harry confessed. "From ...
Harry turned his head away. "Not really." He wasn't sure when that had changed. He didn't have a real plan yet.
"Yeah." The room had a sofa as well as the one chair. Harry sat on the end nearest Remus. "I have a new appreciation of what it must be like for him. And I've been doing this for less than three weeks." Speculatively, he looked at the door. "I wish I could turn into a dog."
"Look," Seamus asked. "Is this important?  I mean -- a yellow emergency, or red?"
"Yes." Harry glared. "I trust him."
"Dropped off for a minute and then woke up again," he said. He scraped his tongue against his teeth. "And there's this taste in my mouth like the fire backed up."
Draco sniffed. "Gryffindors are strange."
"He has the letter, doesn't he? And
"Is that why you thought to use a Warming charm? Because it's cold there?"
think it's horrible," Harry explained. "They didn't let me do my homework, some summers. Uncle Vernon said he wouldn't have that 'freakishness' in his house, and he locked up all my books as well as my wand." He was amazed he could say this, now. Maybe it was because he was never going back there? It would have seemed humiliating to admit to while he was younger, but now he was a legal adult, and he could talk about it safely in the past, he found himself thinking that could maybe help someone else, if he had a housemate too proud to complain about a similar situation. Sammy was looking a little
"Me," Draco said tightly. "Us. We're people he wants to kill."
Harry shook his head. "It's not that simple," he said. "He was brought up to think that way."
like me, though -- or rather, your counterpart does."
Harry turned the words over in his head. "The Dursleys?" he guessed.
"Oh." Harry thought he'd have to think about that.  He had managed to teach Neville a couple of things; maybe he could teach Millicent. "What name will you use?" he asked, suddenly wondering.
"It's the only position worth playing."
“Merpeople manage their own affairs,” Susan objected.
Remus frowned. "Ironroot?"
"Me?" Ron answered stupidly. He sat down heavily next to Harry. "I mean, yeah -- of course."
Again, Harry kissed the back of his neck, but gently this time. "You can be so vulgar when you're being cruel. You need to learn to do it when you're nice."
Draco nodded again. He hadn't expected Potter, who was all thunder and lightning and storm clouds, to be so sweetly reassuring to his boy. His plan was lost behind a fog of wondering if he might be kissed.
"The monster," Harry explained. "When those people were paralyzed and Ginny Weasley was kidnapped? It was a basilisk that Salazar Slytherin had hidden deep in the school. Someone let it out, and it traveled through the walls next to the plumbing. I could hear it hissing
Harry studied him for a moment before making sense of it. "You want to show your room off!"
Sophia and Gilbert were quietly taking beads.
"If you must know, he says he'd love to see me, 'but Slytherin doesn't work that way.' Apparently the first night back is too socially important for him to disappear."
Madam Pince paused to turn and glare at them. Ducking his head, Harry beckoned to the first-years to follow. To the side, however, movement caught his eye, and he turned to see Hermione stuffing books into her bag. She slid one towards a Ravenclaw. That done, she picked up the remaining two volumes and hurried towards Madam Pince's desk.
Draco laughed and pulled him down. Suddenly, no amount of touch was enough. Harry had to run his hands over every inch of Draco that he could reach, and Draco looped a leg over Harry to pull him close. They rubbed together in a frantic rut, Harry touching Draco's back, Draco's hair, and feeling Draco's teeth on his shoulder as another embrace. Draco lifted his head to cry out, and the drag of skin on skin was suddenly slicker. Harry pumped against Draco's suddenly collapsed weight.
"Oh dear," Narcissa said, amusement clear in her voice, as Harry twisted to his feet. "
"Pretty much." Harry looked at the latest stretch of cleaned wall, with its darkly glittering lines above and below the unlit strip of white, and then past it, to the dirt-encrusted rock beyond. "I think that's enough for the day. About time for your glamour, isn't it?"
"Brilliant!" Ron exclaimed.
If anything else is declassified, I'll let you know.
avoid further trauma.  Dueling was often unpredictable. "Until when?"
"How could you? You don't know her."
"Right. Just don't want you to get the wrong idea."
"Brilliant!" Harry exclaimed.
"No, but a day or two." Harry sighed. "Or maybe he's learned something and will apologize for dragging her into a fight with me."
"Yes." Harry had moved back up to use the pillow, but Severus had lain down in place, his cheek resting on Harry's thigh. With a satisfied sigh, Harry ran his fingers through Severus's hair. It was fairly clean -- he vaguely remembered Draco going after him about it the day before, perhaps to some effect. "And it would be hot to turn you over to Draco for instruction," he said lustfully. "Would you like that? Being told precisely how to please me?" He tugged at the hair in his fingers, but Severus either didn't understand the signal or ignored it.
"No. I was just shopping. I've disappeared, you know."
After a bit of fussing with Harry's bed, angling it slightly so that he could converse without sitting up, Madam Pomfrey set her tray of potions aside and consented to retire to her office for a few minutes. Harry thought her instructions about not moving around unnecessary. He didn't think he could.
Draco showed up, a mostly-empty school bag over his shoulder. "Let's go!"
"You cook?"
"Come in," he said, gesturing to the sofas and chairs clustered nearer the windows. "A House Elf brought the furniture this morning -- it's not covered with fur or anything."
"Here," Sirius said, setting a rack of toast and a bowl onto the table. "Mushrooms." He sat down and took a slice of the toast. "Enjoy."
A wave of constrained motion came down her body.
"No. That was an unnecessary embellishment by my father."
"Horsyr's, I think. It's not permanent -- she just wasn't sure they'd be safe where she was traveling, so she only took the older two, who have more control and are easier to conceal."  He bit his lip for a moment. "And she said Cheefi didn't want to leave me.  I may regret it, but I had been missing them in advance, and she asked me in front of them, so of course I jumped at the chance."
on me, yes. I do." One of his hands moved past Malfoy and stroked down his arse. "Even for this." He gripped briefly, and let go. Harry was embarrassed to hear himself whimper.
That was enough to pull Harry back. He reviewed the team in his mind, confirming that everyone else had left. "Okay."
He grabbed Harry's hand and pulled him over to a desk. From the center alcove, he drew out a large box and set his wand to the top, murmuring a password. It opened to show a pile of newspaper clippings. On the top one, Harry saw a picture of Lucius Malfoy, walking in consultation with someone. "These are all articles about you. Reading them may help jog your memory."
"Look, are you going to teach me this curse or not?"
"Slytherins don't fall in love, Moony."
"Oh." Nervously, Millicent stood up. She paced over to the cauldron, looked in it, and walked back. "Between Potions and lunch, perhaps?"
"Not till May." Linnet shrugged. "It doesn't matter to me anyway." She lifted her pumpkin juice in emphasis.
"I am not amused, Mr. Malfoy."
"Anything."
There were no other changes to the decor yet, but a large bundle of daffodils stood in an ewer of water on the table in front of the blue couch, next to a large hamper. Leaving Draco to his work, Harry investigated. He found a tray of small, sugared rolls, and under that, a bright mound of mandarins, their clear citrus scent rising as they were exposed. To the side, in protected compartments, were whole, bright strawberries, and delicate crystallized violets.
"It's a point," Cornelia said, leaning back. "That's a crack to slip a knife in, isn't it?"
-- Pomegranate seeds (from a whole pomegranate)
"Yes, but that's always true, isn't it?" Blaise objected. "I mean, that's another aspect of it being conversation compressed."
"Of course not. Dumbledore will spring it on me right before, I'm sure." Harry hesitated. "I plan to be gone before then."
"Get out." When Harry had his hand on the door, Snape added, "And be glad I find you preferable to the other cretins he might consider a dalliance with."
"Then you have nothing to worry about." Harry nuzzled Draco's arm above where it still gripped his shoulder. "Rub up against me for a little while, at least? You never do that for long enough."
Millicent had reached them. Harry settled on the arm of the sofa, one hand on Draco's shoulder, confident that she had his back. "I'm rather looking forward to it, actually. McGonagall tries to keep me from getting too much private time with him. We haven't had a good talk since summer."
"Still dangerous, though," Harry continued. "I've asked Bulstrode to keep an eye on him for me."
"Merlin, Granger!"  Millicent exclaimed. "Issues, much?"
Potter snorted. "I don't think
"Well then," he suggested, reaching for the wine, "do tell me more about the sex."
"No!" Hermione and Draco said in unison.  Hermione leaned forward. "Don't go getting into one of your pig-headed, obsessive theories now! That's absurd."
That, Harry understood. He laughed slightly. "Yeah, I guess."
"I did invite her!"  Ron protested.
Harry rolled his eyes. He had to work to keep his head still, so that his scar would stay covered. "How much," he said clearly, "for two sphinx feathers?"
His quarry was far ahead, but also seemed to be heading back to the maypole. He disappeared into the crowd before Harry reached it, so Harry ducked behind a hedge and took off the cloak. When it was safely back in his coat pocket, and his coat resting over his arm, he came back out to check out the dancing.
"So," she said. "The other day...."
"But someone magical."
“But how can you joke about something like that? This isn’t to humiliate, or alarm, or deter.”
"I looked!"
"I am not snubbing him!"
accept protection," he said, staring fiercely at her.
Harry studied Draco. He was slightly flushed -- a good look on him, but many things were -- and despite the nonchalance of his pose, much of his weight was on his toes, as if he were ready to launch forward. "You really want this to work."
Harry pushed a hand down between them, rubbing awkwardly along the hard line of Draco's erection. "Yeah." He moved his knees, pushing up a little to give his arm more room, and managed to get his hand into Draco's trousers, letting out a little moan at the brush of his knuckles against smooth skin. "God, yeah."
"No," Harry said, but Malfoy stopped anyway. His hands moved in long, firm strokes down Harry's body, and Harry arched up, seeking more.
"Mr. Nott did not threaten to 'destroy' you."
"What?" Draco snapped. "No! You will not impose on Mother during--"
"Well, a lot does."
The words were thoughtful, but Harry knew them as a correction. He felt himself flush. "Oh, all right. Privacy for that, but you can't hide in there."
hands to open it, that worked."
"No. Not really."
"I think I'll head out, then," Blaise said awkwardly. "Have an essay to finish."
me, and I would have died if he hadn't, and Slytherin deserved to get just
"I'm surprised there haven't been dozens!"  Blaise said cheekily. "Although the portkey failing has probably staved off some, as has Professor Snape taking his side about it."
To Harry's relief, they had arrived at the archway that marked the entrance to Snape's rooms. Before Draco could say more, Harry revealed the door and rapped the gargoyle knocker smartly against its plate. The gargoyle stretched out its wings and bared its fangs, but didn't bite. It knew Harry by now.
"Um -- he does make sure we can all cancel a Muting hex wordlessly, though," Harry added quickly. "But if you hit that one, we'll be here."
"Good lord," Remus said, making the identification at about the same time. "I suppose they can't use magic to get it down; it will obscure curse traces."
Harry grasped the meaning immediately. He didn't want to come yet? Well, that was all right. He stood, letting his opened trousers fall and parting his school robes to display his erection. "So what about you, Malfoy? You'd look pretty on your knees, with those skirts all spread around you, and your tits showing when you leaned forward...."
"It's not bad," Harry agreed, groaning as he hid his face in one hand.
"You didn't know?" Hermione winced. "Oh.  Maybe I wasn't supposed to tell you. It's a nuisance, though, because he isn't on the train, and I had to lead the prefects' meeting by myself."
Harry laughed. "I'd have loved to have seen that!"
"You cannot be serious!" Gilbert exclaimed.
Harry glanced around for other people, but they were alone. That wasn't surprising, as there were fewer than a dozen students in the school for this week, and half the staff had left as well. He still didn't want to mention Millicent; it would be just his luck to have Peeves shoot out of a crack in the wall, cackling lewd insinuations. "Ordering the satyrs' hooves," he said quickly.
"He didn't know then," Draco said at a soothing near-whisper. Harry summoned Dobby, and released the restored mouse. After a few seconds of panicked immobility, it shot away into the ivy-covered pile of rubble, vanishing just as Dobby returned with a bowl full of sunflower seeds.  "Thanks," Harry said cheerily, pretending not to notice Hermione's glare, and after taking a handful of the seeds, put the bowl on the couch behind him, next to Ginny. Quickly, he cracked four of them and held the hull halves to Ron. "Do you want to add them, or shall I?
Harry's idea won out, that year. It wasn't just that he was famous, or that even he was team captain and one of two eighth years on the team. It was that the designs were chosen -- in great secrecy -- by the team, and after the behavior of the Slytherins in the final match of the Quidditch Cup, everyone jumped at the opportunity to rough them up a bit. The Contrivance had to be at least half mechanical, and standard Bludgers were almost entirely magical, but a 90% mechanical solution to the Bludger had been devised nearly a century ago, and was well-documented. The Gryffindor team took out the complicated -- and highly explosive -- buoyancy unity in favor of a neutral flotation spell, added mechanical color-detection with an alchemical check, and presented their plan to Professor McGonagall. After imposing only the most minimal safety adjustments, she signed off on it, and production -- with the inevitable modifications -- began.
"Because you bullied her, I expect!"
"You wouldn't ... wouldn't leave, would you?" Ron asked, similarly stripping down to work clothes.
He stayed near the window -- the one with Draco's tiger -- with a wall to his back. Some guests glared when they saw him, but they all seemed to lose interest after a few seconds. More ignored him, at least overtly.  Nearby, a group of three women, just ahead and to his right, were having an animated conversation about their children's latest activities, but they were not so close that Harry had to listen to the details. He took the time to survey the room for people he knew. From here, he could see Pansy and one of the Greengrass girls at a sideboard, talking to someone who might be Hugh Cecilus, and he thought the little boy strutting back and forth at the far end of the hall might be Ogden. However, there was no sign of Gilbert or Linnet.  Harry wondered if her parents had changed their minds.
"And saying Trent was the sexiest thing at school?"
Before her little kernel of hurt could grow, Harry stroked her shining scales.
"Two bottles, actually," Harry said loftily. "One good, and one very,
seem to think of me as your girl. I suppose it makes you less bent."
"Taste in chocolate."
," he said finally. "Of course, neither is apparating out of someone's house, but I didn't want both of us to have our backs to her."
it, either. I'm much happier as a Slytherin Beater, where I'm treated as one of the boys....."
"Oh." Her brow furrowed for a moment, and then cleared. "Thank you. You'll be back on time?"
"Wow," Seamus said, peering down the corridor, dimly lit by the light of four wands, into darkness.
Harry rolled over, showing his unrelieved erection. Draco ran his pale hand reverentially down the blood-darkened skin.
"Perhaps someone could fill me in as to what
For a moment, they just breathed.
At last, Dumbledore broke the silence. “Would a transfigured animal suffice?” he asked gently.
"With you?"
"Vulnerable?" Harry exclaimed. "It's not harming her any, is it? Talking to me?"
"Two..." After staring at him for an awkward moment, her face cleared. "Oh! The Fairy gift--"
An awkward silence followed. "The blonde, that is," Draco clarified, his voice tight, which helped not at all. Harry finally reached under the table and gripped his thigh. Briefly, Draco brushed his hand, but the muscles of his leg remained tight under Harry's touch.
!" she shouted, as she pursued him. Harry chuckled to himself. Definitely a Sorting problem. He lengthened his stride, and caught the shifting section of wall before it could close behind their argument. The stones stopped in mid slide, much like the door to a lift, probably due to much the same safety considerations, however differently fulfilled.
"Ah -- as a cover, really. It's the other thing I'd definitely need if I was actually making healing potions."
"Hey!" He hurried after them. "Draco's in a private meeting! You stay out of there!"
"He'd never heard of the company before, much less applied there. A beautiful saleswitch hop-apparated down from their 'volcano' laboratory with a generous offer for him to do fascinating research in weather work."
"Breathe?"
Harry shivered and touched more. That had to hurt, but Malfoy didn't seem to mind. "Isn't this better than wanking?"
"Startled?"
"I believe I explained our task."
He snorted. "That hadn't crossed my mind. Here --" No one else was near. He pulled her into a window embrasure at the landing. "Let me show you."
"But he was right. The energy felt more accessible.  I think I could have done more with it."
"We'd talked about Sajid," Harry said.
She jumped back to her feet, letting out a little cry.  "No!"
"Ah." Harry felt the hairs behind the touch rise, sending sensation up his scalp. He stretched back into the contact.
Harry wondered what he would say when they stopped with enough privacy for conversation, but Draco drew him to long sideboard that was covered with half-unwrapped bundles, and began pulling them open, spilling out little toys and ornaments and other small things. As he started on the third, Harry picked up a hair clip. It was well made, but surprisingly plain.
Harry bit his lip. "She's expected to be ladylike, I think. She's said her mum disapproves of Quidditch."
"Want what?" Harry demanded, moving a hand down to the curls at her pussy. "Say it."
"I've heard of love spells."
She shook her head. "Gryffindors!"
During the trip up to and back down from Gryffindor, they settled the amended story of their encounter with Sirius, and decided that if a dog was necessary, it should be one that Sirius had kept under magical control.  Harry raced off to Defense Against the Dark Arts feeling giddy with hope.
"Yeah." Harry took a deep breath. "I can't imagine -- I'm certain I wasn't capable of it. Maybe it
"I'm up for it," Blaise said heartily. "But don't we have Apparation?"
"Ah!"
Draco sighed and levered himself out of the chair. "Give us a few minutes, Harry? I'll come to your room when I'm done."
"That's an advantage though," Blaise put in. "It narrows things down." Hermione had pulled a self-inking quill from her bag and was writing "tastes good to Harry" on a piece of parchment.
"Oi!" called out a voice, as he set his foot on the train steps. "You sir! Students only!"  Bustling into conversational range, Ernie Macmillan returned to his usual self-important tone. "Regulations, my good man, you understand -- for the children's safety."
Suddenly, Harry wasn't sure he could eat.
"Hm. Well, then it will just have be enough that
"Right. Oh! Do you have pictures of yourself? I might need those, later on."
"Merlin!"
Draco cut Hermione off with "hush."
With a huff, Draco strode over to the grate and threw in some floo powder. "Kitchens!"
She reared up, coming strangely close to his eyes to look at the scar. He could feel her distaste as she tested the air in front of it.
"Right." Sirius smiled engagingly. "In the manner of young men."
"Yes, I am. Do you think this place can manage pheasant? Perhaps if they send someone out to poach it...."
"Oh, I see! Was it important?"
"Well, there must be something!" Harry glared at Snape. "I want him taken out."
"Well, that might be okay if I cast a cushioning charm where they'll land."
Ginny's face contorted as if she had bit into a worm. "It is?" she asked finally.
for it," Harry exclaimed angrily. "For Bellatrix. I was trying to lose them as fast as possible, and she'd been so angry before--" He looked away. There was silence.
"And aren't you Slytherin enough to chose your words for your audience?"
"Shall I go on?"
"Oh, don't tell me you believe they're still living in secret!" Linnet exclaimed.
“That would be difficult, but not impossible.”
"Rough," Harry admitted. "Though I seem to be okay with Hermione now."
"Half?" Dumbledore looked puzzled. "I provided inter-house space--"
Shamed, Harry looked away. Yes, Ron had taunted him, but he had just attacked, like a child with no self-control at all.
For a while, Harry lost himself in the kisses, and the press of skin to skin, but then Malfoy pulled back, returning to her knees above him.  She pushed a finger inside again, and kissed Harry's breasts, and Harry curled to kiss her hair.
Harry, through thoughts of Nott, and divination, and murder, distantly wondered why Draco wanted to meet in the Uncommon Room, when they could be guaranteed privacy in the Chamber of Secrets. When it came down to it, though, he wasn't in the mood for romance, or even sex. Perhaps, he thought, Draco felt the same.
With a wobbly smile, she nodded. "He hasn't spoken to me since I said it was okay that you went to Slytherin."
"Except when sneaking," George amended.
"Yes, Blaise?"
Draco lingered at his elbow. "Something I should know about?" he whispered, his eyes narrowing.
He gave her a devilish smile worthy of his predecessor.  "Of course. The Hermione in my world does." Smirking, he dropped down onto the comfortable chair and lounged there, one leg tossed carelessly over an arm of it. "In return for my public favor."
"Shove off, Weasley."
you."
"No, but you could walk away when someone with no authority over you insisted on it."
"Gryffindor," Harry said strongly. "Or it was, until I left school to try to get rid of Y-" He found he couldn't say "You-Know-Who." Snape
"Draco. What a pleasant surprise."
"So." He could still glare. "I'm here."
He had possibly, Harry thought, cast it. It could have been on last year's list. It was that sort of thing.
"To believe me, I mean," he said. "But it went totally wrong, and you believed everything I said for days, until I managed to lift it."
"Just," Harry answered, as two potions vials were set down on the table beside him, with the clack of glass on wood. "I'm sure she's more tired than she's letting on."
"I just ... I haven't seen him. And we're due here this afternoon--"
"Oh here -- let me push your robes up." In a few seconds, Draco was fumbling with Harry's zip, his knuckles brushing haphazardly over Harry's cock. "In an emergency, just do the button and drop your robes into place."
"And you," Harry said. "I don't know the Slytherin students nearly as well as I ought to."
"Merlin and Morgana."  Draco shuddered, but stepped forward. "I'm so glad I didn't join that madman."
"Over the holidays, perhaps," Dumbledore suggested, getting to his feet. Harry didn't feel like they had got anywhere. Had Dumbledore just wanted to know about Snape? Before he even spotted Madam Pomfrey approaching, he found himself confronted with another dose of the putrid ooze. After that, she handed him a clear, almost unobjectionable potion to chase it. Before sleep took him, Harry saw her returning to her office with the headmaster.
"Because you care," she said simply. "Harry, look at me."
, blinded by your dislike, may have missed is that people
"We thought," Draco said neutrally, "that you might inquire as to whether there was some extraordinary justification for this oversight. A hostage, perhaps, or a delicate plan to recapture the fugitive."
"Well, it's not like you're doing anything, or want to be
It was a valid question. Draco couldn't claim he didn't find the task beneath him. He picked up one of the new Chaser's jackets -- heavy padding in the body, lots of give in the arm attachment, fitted lower sleeves -- read Vaisey's name from the inner collar, and summoned Vaisey's old uniform from his cubby. "Think," he said caustically, as he laid the old uniform out on the bench to his right, and the new one to his left. "Would you trust Crabbe or Goyle with this? Bulstrode? And Sharpe isn't worth the trouble."
Harry shrugged. "So?"
He slept.
"Most haven't been bitten by it twice." Harry cast a spell that Snape had taught him. He and Draco glowed briefly, but he didn't see any other bright spots. "We seem to be the only magical beings in range."
He didn't see Ron until dinner, when he finally showed up, Hermione's hand held firmly in his.
"We won't do that one again."
, what were you upset about?"
"Oh." She blushed. "Maybe I should have been clearer. I didn't want to push."
She swept her wand back and forth over the beads. Four long ones, in house colors, glowed. "These four are charmed."
The door opened and then closed again. "Hello?" called Neville's uncertain voice.
As he was winding down to huffs, Draco said "typically vigorous," which set them both off again.
“Not entirely better, I guess.”
"I see your point, but I don't think he needs any further experience."
Her gaze fixed the pyramid of books, she drew her lip under her teeth. "I'm not sure he's going to invite me again."
"Your nephew's escort," Snape said coldly. "We will go to his room. If you do not complain or interfere, I may restore your husband's voice before I depart."
"We were thinking of adding fifth-years this term, though we haven't discussed it yet. Is he discreet enough? I mean, without Babbling Draught?"
"His marks are better than mine," Harry said protectively.
. He tried to envision it rising into the air. Nothing happened.
magic, Mr. Potter, not wandless and non-verbal."
She stuck her tongue out. "I've heard that theory."
"Maybe we should talk to Professor Dumbledore," Hermione said.
"You are quite welcome." With a little bow, Dumbledore swept out of the office, although Fawkes, Harry noted, stayed behind on his perch.
"You see," Draco drawled, "the headmaster is genuinely as mad as he pretends to be."
After a few spells, George announced that the ankle wasn't broken, and cast one spell to reinforce where it was strained and another to dull the pain. Draco came gingerly back to his feet.
Harry considered. If the spell had been Dark, he didn't want to say anything too incriminating. On the other hand, there were only so many colors. "Orangish?" he hazarded.  "Maybe more red. Not green, at any rate."
Draco had stopped short at the corridor. Harry tugged on his arm to get him moving again. "And I read the first three chapters, all right? Just like he said. But it might as well have been Gobbledygook, for all the sense it made."
"I don't know, actually.  He disappeared right after his test."
Smirking, Mill handed her a glass. "Enjoy your dreams, Carter." She grabbed two bowls of nuts and one of the tarts, breaking the perfection of the display. Within seconds, Susan had scooped up a plate and started choosing things to put on it. A swift flow of people followed, and the room was soon filled with the bright sound of clinking china, and cheerful chatter, and the scents of beer, pastry, and crunched nuts.
“Oh, don’t look worried. I won’t spend it all.” Remus had tugged Sirius back toward the hut, and Harry and his friends followed in a cluster. Harry hoped Sirius wouldn’t be recognizable from the castle windows, especially if he remained facing away. “Tell you what – I’ll bring you to my vaults, and let you calculate a budget for us.” He grinned back at Harry. “That will be hilarious.”
. This Snape wasn't a childhood friend of Lily -- though he may have liked her, and he did hate James.
"Look, what if you conjure a mirror, all right, and then I do the glamour? We can do it in the space behind the pub."
He looked at the sword, at his hands, at his body. "I think so?"
"Exactly. Which means they're a slightly different green
"Obviously," Padma said. "That's why we have colors."
"I brought refreshments. You can unseal it."
There was a sharp rap at the door. "Time's up, Potter."
"Of course they think I ought to! Look, don't worry about it, okay? I'm still on the team, and it's not my problem, now." Harry turned away to loosen the cord on the bag of fluxweed. "And while it wasn't penance, it seems to have worked that way. They were far less angry at me today."
"Good afternoon!" he returned, following her. "Am I late enough to miss prep?"
It took a moment for Harry to translate that to 'Gilbert'. "Reasonably," he replied. "How did you know?"
"Hm." Parvati considered. "Perhaps not, if we're playing next week. I don't want to run out of good conditions."
something with someone."
"If he was stuck with Malfoy? Hell, yes!"
They stayed out long past lights out, the Slytherin girls cooing over the Quiris under Horsyr's amused eye, but Harry still woke up early, as he had much of the year. That Defense Against the Dark Arts was his first lesson four days a week had done wonders for his ability to get up in the morning. He stumbled down to the Great Hall with Neville and Ginny -- Ron still being asleep -- and they joined Hermione at the house table and began selecting food from the platters there. He had woken up enough to wonder what Gentian might ask to learn -- what did first year Slytherins want to know? -- when the post owls swooped in. Unlike his first few years, he now looked up hopefully, just like the other students. There might be a letter from Sirius, or Remus, or Tonks -- or even Esmée, who had accepted his apology with a sweet "I understand! It must be so hard for you, all these enemies!" adding a chatty page about her return to France. He smiled to himself. There were actual possibilities
"Well," he said, "the Slytherins aren't all bad, you know. But there is a good deal of house rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin, so you should take anything they tell you with a grain of salt. I'd say ask, but be polite when you do it, and cautious about the answer -- don't just blindly do what you're told."
Harry nodded. "Well, we'd been sitting and kissing for a while, then, right?"
"Very much so." Harry shuddered. "Thank you. If I see Pansy, should I send her here?"
"Poor babe." Harry tried to keep his voice light as he drew his arm back. The tails hissed a moment's warning before snapping down hard on Draco's arse.
At his first bite of a ham sandwich, Harry realized that he was ravenous. It wasn't until after finishing the sandwich, an apple, and several chocolate biscuits that he felt sated enough to relax.
"Yeah," he said. "I do." His ears had apparently deceived him; Snape did not emerge. "Care, I mean. I want to tame him."
All the girls took one this time, as -- to Harry's surprise -- did Draco and Gilbert.
"Yeah," Ron said, finally raising his head. He aligned the stiletto and hesitated, the thin point just above Harry's skin. "You okay with this?" he asked. His gaze flicked significantly over to Draco and returned. "Really?"
Draco giggled nervously. "You're vulgar."
, and I really think I can
, Harry. You should thank me."
Harry's eyes met Draco's. Draco turned toward his old Head of House.
Hermione grimaced. "I see."
"And who are you?" he spat.
Snape did not quite manage to contain his shudder, and Harry felt a surge of bitter satisfaction.
"It will only be a meeting or two, and I will be here for the rest of the holiday. Don't sulk."
"With Fred and George," Ron protested.
"Yes. And advice.  Godfathers do that, as I understand."
"What?"
Harry coughed. "All right then." He picked up a forkful of couscous.  "So, what about you? Any fascinating research?"
you have secrets, and this is the safest."
When they had gathered, Harry stood on raised grid in front of the showers. "I'd like to cede captaincy of the team to Cornelia," he said bluntly.
"What, have you
"Professor McGonagall? May I speak to you for a moment?"
"Doxy eggs!" Hermione exclaimed, horrified.
"Seamus, I don't think they know me well enough to aim."
"You don't know?" Draco asked incredulously.
"Ah. But we volunteered to carry messages, as we had intended to speak with you anyway," Fred explained.
Harry hadn't realized Blaise knew so much about Potions. He sounded almost as knowledgeable as Draco.
he was protecting me, and looking back on it, considering what he knew, what he did was very brave." He was admitting that to himself, for the first time, as much as to them. Snape had known he was facing an unmedicated werewolf and a man who had carelessly nearly killed him as a boy, and he had thought he was facing a mass murderer. That wasn't just vainglory, or hatred of Sirius -- he must initially have been moved as much by the need to protect three students from what he feared himself. "It's just that he wouldn't
"Like
"Yeah." Harry had to lean against him again, to breathe in his scent. "You died when I was fifteen. I barely knew you."
"Oh, Merlin, no! It will take a week to get the paperwork started, and then we need to agree upon the questions." In a sudden dramatic movement, she put her hand over her mouth. "Oh, dear me! I seem to have forgotten to record this conversation! We'll need to start again."
"Alright, then." Harry stood up. "Let's go."
when you do that."
"True," he said. "But he'll get over it."
"When was this?" Ron looked confused. Harry hadn't realized he was listening.
"You said Saturday was study time."
Eugene hit him.  He really had a pretty good punch, Harry decided, for someone who'd been raised as a girl -- good enough that Harry felt entitled to punch him back.
"Okay." She spent a while fidgeting with her hair -- dragging it between her fingers and studying the spread-out strands.  "So, how much use will this be?"
event...."
"A little." Harry patted the cushion next to him. "Come and sit down."
"Well, life as a fugitive is kind of boring, okay? I promise you, I have no intention of using gargoyle dust."
"Sorted?" he asked companionably. Draco's nose wrinkled.
He had met it as a joke, but she turned away, shoulders slumped. He laid a hand on her back, settling it into the thick wool of her winter robe. "Hermione?" he whispered.
Snape rolled his eyes. "A bit paranoid, perhaps?"
he wanted to take that course. He would be happy to be rid of all the Not Recommended courses as well, so that gave him one free slot. He looked back up at the word "Potions," and the strong line beneath it and shook his head. "Any other year," he muttered.
"Yes."
She laughed. "But you only heard that one in whispers?" she suggested. "He's my dad. My mum is Andromeda Black."
"Witches and wizards of the Wizengamot," he said, bowing politely, "I do not deny that I was present at this gathering of supporters of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, nor that I followed those of his servants who pursued my only son and heir. However, my presence was not willing, and I followed Draco only to protect him."
"Harry. Professor Dumbledore told me you were returning from the forest." His eyes flicked to Snape, who was coming up behind Harry. "I had not realized your company."
"So lovely."
"Well, I was using her," Draco pointed out, "but not
"Boys!" Mrs. Weasley reproved. She smiled at Harry, and patted his hand. "Harry is right. Fair play is more important than winning a silly award."
That would make Linnet second and Gilbert third. Harry looked at Draco, and they nodded at each other. It would be a good start.
A year ago, Harry might have dismissed that, but he had since had multiple conversations about Draco to put Sirius's attitudes in clearer light. "He has warned me about Slytherins," he said neutrally.  "I take it he didn't get along with his family?"
Harry shot her a look. "Hi," he said tersely.
"The one that keeps the Ministry -- well, at least four departments of it -- from being able to hire Slytherins?"
"I have some work to do in Charms," he told her.
"Harry!"
"Think about it. You don't need to know what Voldemort's weakness are -- those are
His face turning pink, Draco shrugged. "If I'm feeling especially overwhelmed."
"No."
"Well, we have a list, don't we? Divination, war strategy, winning over our respective houses...."
Hermione glowed. “I transfigured
in the brain, somehow. I think I had my memories magically, and
Ron was waiting half-way between the main staircase and the library, and he stepped out of the shadows silently, giving Draco an almost furtive nod. Going along with the mode, Harry grinned at him and gestured at him to come along as he set off away from the library and toward the back stairs.
this worthwhile, but he will eventually come to resent you. Surely you
"I wasn't offering!" Malfoy shouted after him, and took off in the other direction.
Harry shrugged. "I'd been talking to your spellfather."
Severus considered this. "But if he accepted me?" he asked.
"I know." The professor's first diagnostic spell shot up and down Draco's body, tingling along Harry's arms.
"The what?" Harry asked, but Snape motioned him to silence. Frowning, Harry decided to accept that now, and then press both of them for answers later.
"No," Malfoy snapped. The others both laughed. Harry squeezed him reassuringly.
"Oh." The assertion settled in Harry's stomach like a lump of lead.
at something, wouldn't it be stupid not to do it because you thought it was too feminine? What does that
Harry felt a hot flash of anger at the memory of the two labels overlapping at their forward edges. "How does he kiss?"
"Should we try a false location, first?"
"I'd be much more likely to get caught--"
"Why ask her in the first place?"
"Ah, that."  Dumbledore waved a hand. "I will let Professor Hecksban know that you may be allowed a localized armoring charm -- you have learned those, correct?"  At Harry's node, he produced a dark purple potion which he handed to Harry.  "Take a sip of this -- exact quantity does not matter, but it must go down in a single swallow -- at 4:00 every day. If you experience any difficulties -- for example, nausea or pain -- see me or Madam Pomfrey immediately."
"I...." Harry's voice caught in his throat. He wanted to protest that he didn't know Malfoy; not to be reassured by his presence, and certainly not to be lying with him in this intimate manner, which he had never done with
Draco swallowed. His expression darkened, and he opened his mouth to speak.
"Indeed, it is damning with faint praise. I expect I am 'better company' than a Blast-Ended Skrewt, in that case." His eyes raked Harry up and down. "Put on some decent clothes, Mr. Potter, and I will escort you to our meeting."
Harry evaluated his changed friend. He looked flushed and anxious, but more concerned than afraid.
"Well, that's mutual," Harry interjected. "So, when should we go and see the Quiris?"
"Forget I said anything."
"Or whenever you have time," Harry added grudgingly.
Curious, Harry reached for the article, but Draco held his hand back. "Wait. One more thing. Top right-hand drawer, now -- the password is 'mastery', but you have to say it."
"Losing the game," Harry answered. "He's just-- he's upset at me."
Ignoring the accusing tone, Draco studied his nails. "How perceptive of you to notice."
The Ravenclaw sniffed contemptuously. "As if little kids can't keep secrets. I don't know why grown-ups think that."
"Harry's half right," Draco said. "Except you don't just imagine it; you also draw it with your wand."
"Okay." Reluctantly leaving
. No truth magic. Why would anyone want to lie anyway? I don't think any of us object to having a mysterious string of beads. The only secrecy charms should be that you can't tell anyone outside this room about the Game, or what beads mean."
Harry paused. That indicated an alarming lack of experience. "You've never done this, have you?"
He chuckled. "Hermione thought you should bring Polyjuice potion. She was trying to figure out if hair from a month ago would make you look like you did then."
that you are playing with so cavalierly, and a student in my house." Snape leaned close enough that Harry could smell fish on his breath from breakfast. "As Madame Pomfrey related her suspicions about
"Nix on that," Harry said. "We
witch would know that. It's the right sort of curse, though, isn't it? I mean, if you remember some of your lessons, and less about your usual companion, and nothing at all about sex?"
Harry nodded into a shrug.  "Yeah. We're friends again, though. She says at least I didn't cheat on her."
Auror Tonks nodded. "I think that will do for today, then. I expect that Ron Weasley would be able to provide us with a picture of this rat?"
"And we have an idea."
The delivery contained nothing too damning, but the quantity of fluxweed would be hard to explain.  Fortunately, the twins had included a large number of samples: Tilt Lines, Babble Drops, and Twister Jacks, as well as more familiar things like Skiving Snackboxes, so Harry had goods from the package to bring down to the Common Room. He unrolled one of the Tilt Lines safely away from the windows and fire, and challenged people to walk on it. When Hermione returned, Sajid was trying to stay on the line for its full two-meter length. He had his arms held out and was teetering madly as he inched down what looked like a stripe of paint on a quiescent carpet. His housemates cheered him on, with those who had already tried it especially enthusiastic in their mixed encouragement and laughter.
"Lucky for all of Europe, I think."
The dinner plates had just disappeared, and everyone was looking around for puddings, when the owls arrived. Two flew straight to Harry. One was the Malfoy's eagle owl, although Harry thought it too soon to be a reply. The other was an unfamiliar barn owl, bearing a red envelope. Harry lurched to his feet as the missive skidded across his napkin. At his touch, it exploded open.
"This hearing will continue while we await the arrival of additional Aurors. Professor McGonagall? You may continue to question the witness."
Fred shook his head. "No deal, Harry."
Draco pressed his fingertips warningly into Harry's leg.
“Feels? Yes.”
-- Sphinx feathers (or, less powerfully, Great Eagle feathers)
"Mr. Potter," it said, inclining very slightly. The words were scrupulously polite, but Harry fancied that he could still see hatred snapping in those black eyes. "Mr. Malfoy. Are you recovered enough to report?"
The twins, amusingly, looked as if their mother had caught them at mischief. "Well...."
"No. I mean, right. She's not."
"Oh, don't make guesses!" Harry objected
"I spent the last month making my own decisions about my life," he protested, "and making them work. I'm learning how--"
"No telling," he said. "It might just be about Quidditch, or information about Nott. Harry,
"Lupin!" Draco squeaked.
"That was recent, was it not?"
Draco coughed slightly. "Ah," he said. "The twins."
"Are you doing them any good?"
and what you want to be are different. And--"
"That doesn't make sense," she complained. He supposed he could see her point. He didn't tend to research potions components on a whim.
"So they can't be trusted," Ron said sharply. "Stay away from them."
"Oh!" she cooed, as if he'd handed her a dozen roses. She swooped closer. "You don't have to worry. I
Harry smiled at the parchment. He penned a quick reply, addressing it to "Remus" and explaining about his contract with the twins, and their cooperative use of Polyjuice potion. When it was finished, he sealed it and headed off for the Owlery. Halfway across the common room, he was interrupted.
He managed to slip out of the classroom while Hermione was still cleaning up her work area, and chose the nearest bathroom as the easiest place to duck out of sight. In the cubicle furthest from the door, he peered into his bag. For a moment, he thought the addition must have been charmed to go invisible, but then he found it -- a folded parchment lying alongside his Transfiguration text.
get out of this?"
"How about Justin?" Parvati mused.
"He's not fair, though -- you know he's not!"
Harry glanced at Draco before looking back at her. "We need to talk privately," he said. "My room. After that, I think we'll want an escort in Diagon Alley."
"So much for that."
"Hanleys?  Linnet's family?"
The offer knocked the breath out of him as effectively as a Bludger. It was generous, he knew. It was also, most likely, a negotiation with Draco through him. He shook his head.
"Not constantly," Ron answered. "Besides, it's not even
"Ah." That made sense, Harry realized. They would have needed to talk that out at some point. Still, it had probably renewed Hermione's anxiety to discuss his use of Dark Arts when he wasn't there to be reassuringly normal. "Well, when I confessed to Dumbledore, he pointed out that I'd learned two control spells--"
"There are many spells which block off or enhance feelings in yourself or others -- jealousy, anxiety, recklessness, caution -- almost anything but hatred or love."
"Obviously. Is
"Hi. I brought food."
"Fanged Frisbee out of nowhere, wasn't it?" Mill commented, her voice low. "They were blaming it on Peeves."
She looked down. "You were out, last night."
"Because I won't go back on my word!" That set Ron back. Harry knew he had better make his case fast, before he recovered. "Pansy Parkinson and I have an agreement. I'm sticking to that agreement.
Choking, Neville sat up. "That can be really dangerous, Harry!"
"Not personally," Harry admitted, as Cabot's hand took his in an almost painful grip. "Hello, sir."
Hermione laughed. "It's good to see you comfortable with them."
With a grin, she punched him gently on the shoulder. "That's really quite a good plan. It can't be a sex change potion, because that will interfere, but I could use something else that alters appearance -- an Uglifying brew, maybe, or Ancestral Revelation." She shot Harry a look. "Ask Malfoy for me?"
"-- to walk so far to see it," Seamus concluded, but at a whisper.
"That was idiotic," Draco said, as they headed up the stairs.
"I have a job for you. I want you to tail Potter after lessons -- tell me where he goes, what he gathers, what he gets out of stores, that sort of thing."
wanted things to stay just like this.
Harry consented to having his hair patted for a moment -- even though he could feel his stored anger weakening with the touch. He walked over to Hermione, swerving as little as possible as he moved among the hanging vines and ropes to the clearer space by the second floor entrance.
"Hermione!" he shouted, panicked. "STOP!"
Harry shrugged, trying to look neither hurt nor concerned.  "Well, I enjoy your company. Let's leave it at that."
"For potions ingredients mostly. As you might imagine, I needed a place that would forgo the usual identification checks for certain items." He was rather proud of
"I see." Remus sounded disappointed. Harry sighed.
Harry stopped. "No. I mean, she is less reasonable about you than about Draco, but the real problem is that I don't have explanations for the time I spend with you. I can't even tell her that it's with you, or she'll look into it more. That means she asks more questions about other things that she'd normally let slide. If Draco is willing to say I was with him, every other Sunday afternoon, that should help a lot."
"Well, we're listening," Tonks said. "Tell us what happened."
"Whom had you intended it for?" At his silence, her eyes narrowed. "Who?"
was the problem?"
"I'm being careful, sir. Really."
"About last night...." Harry advanced.
"Social gatherings are expected to have flowers," Draco protested. "We often have flowers in the Great Hall at dinner."
to transfer it to.”
"Don't listen to her, Harry," he said. "You have
"Buy..." Harry frowned. "Oh, the Gargoyle dust?"
"Hermione?" Draco's settled back on his heels, his eyes narrowing as he studied Harry. His voice slowed to a haughty drawl. "Do tell."
I make introductions?" At the Auror's nod, Dumbledore turned to nod himself, but at Harry. "Harry, this is Auror Richard Mason and Auror Nymphadora Tonks. Please cooperate appropriately with their investigation. Auror Mason, Auror Tonks, this is Harry Potter, a tolerable student, but an impressive young man, and a quintessential Gryffindor."
"-- and how nosy and ill-mannered we are."
While he was considering this, Hecksban returned with a satchel the yellow of lollipop lady's vest, and set it down behind the Pensieve.
Harry sniggered. "I may have dropped something about a feisty white barb."
Shacklebolt's eyes widened. "And that is not ridiculous?"
"Didn't--"
"I suppose not." Draco gestured toward the younger Slytherin. "Harry, have you met Gilbert Clarke?"
"What?" Harry dropped into one of the previous batch of chairs. They were stiffly uncomfortable, but a beautiful match for the sofa. "What's wrong with it?"
"How common!"
"Now wait a minute--" Dean began.
At their nods, Harry sighed. "So Voldemort knows."
"I meant," Hermione said hotly, "the vicious girl who pounded on me during our second year."
clothes.  You want to get rid of that and start afresh, so you can enjoy yourself."
"Yeah?"
On Sophia's other side, Hannah shifted, pulling her hair a little more in toward her face. "Um, we've
"Could you use
," Rob said, exasperated. "Kath was talking about it, because she thinks Harry is--" With an apologetic glance at Harry, he ducked his head. "Well, too willing to think the best of people."
"All the more reason to not admit he lost one," Harry said bitterly.
"Oh, sorry. Dad charmed the set to do that."
"Why isn't that sufficient? He obeys you, from what I've seen."
about Skyberries, Potter?"
"I love you too," Harry whispered.
"Oh." Ron ran a hand back through his hair.  "And after?"
"It's hard not to get in the way," Harry said.  "We'd agreed he'd set it off, but I still tried to shield him."
He grinned at her switch to offense. "Right. You wouldn't want anyone blowing their cover over a few harsh words, right?"
"As?" Snape prodded.
Harry wanted to wait for them to emerge, but it was cold to be out walking, and he was afraid he would be too conspicuous loitering by the greenhouse. Reluctantly, he returned to Gryffindor, reasoning that Hermione would look for him there.
"Could have done that without Malfoy there," Ron objected, not seeming to notice Hermione's frown. After a glance at Harry, she set a hand on Ron's shoulder and when he turned naturally towards her, smiled and rose up on her toes. They kissed.
he commanded, willing it to open. To his satisfaction, it swung wide.
"Well,
from his vile family."
"I trust you to a certain point," Snape said coolly, "but not, my good witch, with Potter's blood. You will find your pretty new bowl unharmed."
Draco's cheeks raised in an unguarded smile. "Not at all. We just need to be sure that the Gryffindors believe that you are in change, and the Slytherins believe that I am."
When Harry stepped through the open entrance, Draco was already there, rising from the furry plastic sofa. He stalked towards Harry, meeting him halfway.
Embarrassed, he put her on the floor. She slithered through the dust, past Draco, and to the very edge of the bed. There she reared up, and flicked her tongue out at the wall.
Shacklebolt's eyebrows rose. "You
Ron glanced around, and Harry followed suit. No one appeared to be listening to them.
an exhibitionist."
"Yeah. She thinks children will settle you down."
Harry wondered if this place by the fire was to be for that. "There's an organized group of people -- ones who might show up to defend against Death Eater attacks, or to investigate their plans."
"Yes?"
"Yes. She escaped." Draco shifted, settling an arm over Harry's chest. "And terrifying as that was, having you lying around like a doormat all night was no better. You let me beat you in a fight, you know. And you wouldn't mount me."
"Or it might be intended to mislead," Draco countered. He turned to Professor Hecksban. "However, I do believe it to be a worthwhile endeavor."
early start. "I'll come by Slytherin before breakfast," he offered.
Millicent nodded and grinned. "Ginny then," she said cheerily. You can call me Mill, if you like."
"Is this why Pansy wants to talk to you?" Hermione ventured.
. My life here is still controlled. I don't know what I want -- what I'll like -- out in the world."
Harry looked incredulously back at the scowling potions master. "You can't think you needed to come here to tell me that."
"Er... He took it, actually, while I was trying to wake Ginny. I didn't understand that he was an enemy."
"Because malice isn't justice." Draco's hand was resting on the back of his knee, and, deliberately, Harry wriggled his arse back against him. "We probably have to talk this out sometime, but the energy's fading. Tell me what you want right now."
"But I take good care of you, don't I?"
Harry took the Knight Bus to the Leaky Cauldron, persuading Stan and Ernie, through combined gratuities and flattery, to let him leave it with his invisibility cloak on. Stan actually held the door to the pub open, allowing Harry to haul his trunk inside. Harry left the unwieldy burden by the door and slipped into the warm front room. He was struck, suddenly, by the memory of when he was thirteen, and he had lived here for two marvelous weeks. It wouldn't be the same now, of course. That was before Voldemort had regained his body, and even with the supposed threat of Sirius Black, escaped convict, he had been free to roam Diagon Alley as he pleased. Now, even if no one was telling him it was too dangerous, he would be aware of how dangerous it had become. The smell of beer washed over him, and incongruously, he found himself longing for tomorrow's breakfast, when the crowd would be thin, and that scent stale and bitter and comfortable.
"I don't think there's any rush--"
Draco made a face. "
"Oh, I always love parties," the man replied airily.  "Although the change in decor was a shock. Do you suppose our hostess is trying to break with the past?"
When Harry finally got to Snape's office, the professor was scribbling notes in a small book. He looked up, nodding approvingly when Harry closed the door.
"No more than you." She had stopped working on his trousers to encircle his erection in one hand. "Oh. Yeah."
"How unfortunate for him."
Love,
"Again, yeah. Like that." Her bum came higher and her chest went lower as he moved. "Oh! Faster!"
"I have had
"Settle me down!"  Hermione's face scrunched. "I'm not some sort of wild playgirl."
"No!" Harry took a breath. "It wouldn't tell us anything anyway. She always believes me."
quail. She had specified that it should be male. Looking around, he saw that most of the other students -- including, surprisingly, Hermione -- had the same problem.  Draco, however, had somehow managed to produce the prettier male bird, as had Seamus.
The voice helped him look away. "Er ... thanks, Sir."  After the first awful swallow, his head slowly began to clear. It was reassuring to think that his dizziness had not been entirely emotional weakness. Harry tried not to look at the bowl again, but the motion of the Seer lifting her flask drew his eye. She tipped it over the bowl, and a muddy liquid flowed out of it and dripped down to collect in a green-grey puddle in the dark blood. With her wand, she stirred the air above the bowl.
"The problem is how you keep showing up. Someone might think you were involved."
They apparated to a windswept field that overlooked the ocean far below. Curls of white speckled the grey water, and Harry's robes whipped about his calves. He felt a spiral slide up his arm as Susara moved further from the draught of his jacket cuff.
"How so?"
"Yes! The hedge would vanish before us as we left.  Well, if it worked with a man. I mean, it might require reproductive sex. It works for a man if the heir is a woman."
Potter, rather than launching a barb back, stared at him with his mouth open. Draco had the sudden thought that Creevy might not be much like Thornton.  Before he could decide what to do, Potter had sunk down to the seat beside him, and laid a hand on his arm. Draco tried to contain his panic. Potter wouldn't do anything to him in the open, would he?
"It was obviously killed by an animal?"
When the corridor forked, Harry started for the back staircase -- the den staircase, Finch-Fletchley had called it -- but Draco caught his arm.
The change in topics left Harry feeling spun around. He had thought of his project with Snape as official, like the one with McGonagall, but of course it wasn't. It just wasn't
He was too thoroughly out of the picture for Harry to be jealous.
Harry moaned and started sucking on Draco's neck, which he supposed was response enough. Draco had a sexy voice, when he was in that mode.
"Of course not! I'll just ask him about the taste -- 'I thought potions couldn't be sweetened. What makes this different?' As if I was sure he made it."
"Quite a few. The official mixed house social space is inadequate, as you said yourself--"
“I am Linnet Hanley,” Linnet declared in turn. “I suspect that Gryffindor would have been enjoyable enough as a house, but that Slytherin has better developed my political skills.”
memories physically, but I could only get to his when I -- really, completely myself -- stopped thinking."
"Can I?"
"Huhn. We should get someone from Artifacts in to trace it." The Auror looked over at them. "Potter, Malfoy -- are you all right?"
"Right," Harry said patiently. "I
Harry's eyes widened. "Excellent, Sir!"
"I am --"
"Oh, Merlin, not that!"
"We should probably warn Professor Snape," Harry said.
"She wants to be a man," Harry explained quickly, "and she has to do a slow change, so her family can't just reverse it. I'm helping her with potions and glamours, so we're brewing every two weeks, and we have to meet every day for the glamours, because I can't make them last much longer, though maybe what Hermione said today will help. That's why I made up with her when I did; if I'd left it until morning, the glamour would have worn off, and she'd be caught, and that would ruin the whole thing."
"Well, of course!"
Draco hesitated. "If the person expects it ... well it would be bad for business to not pretend to want to as well. But mostly they don't."
"Don't even try it," Sirius retorted. "The last time you clung to me like this, someone had died. And I'm here early because Hermione's message said there was a problem." He shifted, and his hands went to Harry's shoulders, moving him away while still holding on.  "Where is she?" he asked.
Nodding, Harry spread his hand between Ron's face and the bowl. "With me," he repeated, and Ron seized his hand.
"If what you
"Well, one that's supposed to be haunted. But it isn't, I promise."
Hecksban came into sight first, with an unconscious Petunia Dursley floating behind him. Her legs were bare, and flayed to meat. They glistened with unclotted blood, but it did not fall.
Harry shot her a look, narrowly biting back the observation that she'd know.
"Ah!" Draco's head tipped back. "Harry, don't tease," he pleaded.
"Oh?"
"May I ask, my dear madam, what options our young friend is being asked to choose between?"
Harry laughed slightly. "Yeah. The telling detail of my life was that I wasn't involved with you."
"Like what?"
Harry tensed. "Actually, I've worried about being too much of a security liability."
"Oy! I didn't get that reaction!"
Before Draco could speak, Severus stepped forward with oily grace. "You should not permit him to speak to you that way, Harry."
either, but it is restricted to Aurors and such."
obscuring my trail than I could on my own.
Draco reached out to both of them. Harry took his hand and held it tightly. Pansy's arms crossed over her chest.
Dumbledore nodded. "Or to plan future moves, or to brew potions. And yes -- you are correct that Professor Snape is one of that group, although I would still counsel you to consider his advice with care."
George grinned. "We're always open to new experiences, aren't we Fred?"
"Muggleborns and Weasleys and all?" Gilbert exclaimed.
"Only some of them," she said. "I'm horrible at transfiguration, but I'm fine with some charms -- except all the appearance ones, unfortunately. I know they're not transfiguration, but they
"Here -- what about this: if you will let me invite the other seventh year students to observe, I am willing to set aside three evenings for the effort. After that, if you have not broken the protections, I will give you recommendations for professionals."
Madam Langston straightened. For a moment, she just stared straight ahead, and then, shaking herself much like the cat had, summoned a cup of water.
Draco put on a sullen pout. "He's
"Good thing next weekend is your last autumn match," he said.
"She's
"So," Harry said, swallowing, "I wasn't in as much of a hurry as I should have been. Unfortunately,
"Do you still have this ring?"
"And fourth year you were Krum's hostage," Ron put in. "That counts."
"I...." Harry didn't like the idea. "No," he said. "I don't want to be carrying it in the halls, and I brought it for here, anyway. Let's stop at the kitchens for butterbeer and cakes."
, Harry reminded himself -- seemed worthwhile just to have dinner out with Draco.
"No." Draco bit his lip. He settled into the chair. "Harry,
rude," Draco corrected.
"Oh," Draco sighed, as Harry pushed in further.  His eyes were wide again, but his mouth wasn't tight. "Is that in?"
"-- treasonous," they finished together.
He saw comprehension flash across Draco's face, and was sorry he had said anything. They couldn't have Snape probing about that. As Millicent's head of house, he would need to put a stop to it.
“’S’okay,” Harry managed, as the pain slowly ebbed. His eyes cooperated, finally. He was in the hospital wing, and the extra person was an unrecognizable blur. Harry shifted to sit up, but only succeeded in raising his head an inch or two off the pillow before collapsing down again. He had a moment of fear for Susara before remembering he had left her in Gryffindor before going to the Pensieve practical the night before. She must be worried about him.
Crossing his arms over his chest, Harry glared back at the headmaster. "I'll be 'of age', as you say, in less than three weeks.  If you give me enough trouble, you probably
"Besides," Draco said, "you've started on butterbeer. Thus, business is concluded."
"No you don't."
Draco hesitated. "Actually, I thought it would be barely adequate."
Startled, she looked at him again. "What makes you think he won't?"
"It was Dumbledore," he said. "I hadn't been at the door a minute before he showed up. He has to be watching the place, somehow."
Dumbledore relaxed back. "Ah. I see. Harry, none of the guilt for Cedric's murder, or Arthur's--"
For a moment, Harry was stunned into silence. He drew a breath. "You can't expel her! Her father was just
"But then he did something foolish, and didn't return--" Harry stopped, swallowing.
"Malfoy," Sirius said darkly, but he didn't seem surprised.
"Did you

to wear it. Showing. And you can't tell anyone why. And when you have to take a bead, everyone else gets to vote on the color."
Madam Pomfrey cleared her throat.
In the charming of the favors, Harry had nearly forgotten the tense exchange that had preceded it. "Do you mean you'd pretend to hate Muggleborns if I wasn't here?" he demanded.
Barbed as that was, it relieved the tension. Snape snorted. "Hardly. However, I seldom hear Mr. Potter so lauded in the staff room."
"Yes. I mentioned Hermione specifically." Draco smiled at her. "You'll need to stay out of the library, I'm afraid. Many of the books are restricted to specific bloodlines, and my ancestors were not
"Don't show that off unless you intend to use it."
"I'll plan for that." Draco smiled lazily at him. "And you really believe resigning will improve your standing in Gryffindor?"
Draco blinked. "They just ... happened to," he said slowly. "You didn't make it a condition."
"No," Ron said flatly.
He didn't get to finish the sentence. If regular Apparation was like being squeezed through a hose, House Elf Apparation was like becoming part of a waterfall. After a moment's glorious arc, he found himself standing outside the doors of the Great Hall, with Dobby just letting go of his wrist. Before he could open his mouth, Dobby was gone again. He returned a moment later with Hermione and Draco.
Finally, it was Draco who said his name, and Harry put down the book and walked over. Fred was looking mutinous and George worried.
At a sound from the direction of the corridor, both of them twitched and Draco fell silent. Harry twisted to watch the passage. At the other end of it, the door clicked shut.
"Freedom is good," he repeated. "
"As it happens, I was on my way upstairs not by chance, but to find Mr. Potter." He looked at Harry. "You may recall suggesting, last term, that I remind Narcissa of the threat Nott poses to her son, in hopes of gaining information."

Draco came up to his knees again and licked up Severus's cock while Harry snugged up close against his arse. He didn't try to keep himself from rocking this time, although he left his jeans on.
Belatedly, he realized that was awkward. "Or not," he said, pulling out jeans and a red striped oxford shirt.
Gratefully, Harry took the glass and downed the rest of the water. It had a faint aftertaste of lemon. He decided to believe it was
"Every Slytherin family and every pureblood family with a child within three years of your age was there," Millicent returned. "Otherwise, who would you have had to show off to?"
"So, we're taking December off?"
"Yes."

"No," Padma said. "That would require there be more trust to begin with."

"Is everything set?" Draco asked, as they walked up the stairs to Charms the next afternoon.
"And that excuses you?"
"Before we begin the marvelous feast that awaits us, I have a few announcements. First, I would like all of you to still be here at the end of the term.
"Where else would I be?" The answer sounded reasonable, but he was still staring down.
Draco's reply was drowned out by competing incantations.  Fred went crashing into the door, and Harry felt a stinging lash across his chest. He pressed forward anyway, standing over Fred. Footsteps clattered inside the room, and George hastily ended his charm.
or anything," he said airily.
Harry grinned. "She may have said something about hysteria about young people's fashions."
"I wasn't harmed. Not like Zabini or Nott."
."  Taking a swallow of his drink, he scanned around the room. "There
With a slight cough, Snape put down his fork. He sat even straighter. "Ah." He looked Harry up and down, his dark eyes glittering in the shifting light of the candles on the table. "Yes. That is how you survived the Dark Lord, initially, as I understand it. You can seize the power he sends out."
Harry dressed slowly, retrieved his wand, and cancelled the confining circle around Malfoy. The naked girl was starting to shiver; Harry cast a warming spell on Malfoy's robes and laid them over her. He placed Malfoy's wand a few feet away, where it would not get rolled on. After one final soft kiss to white-blond hair, he left the room, closing the door quietly behind him.
"Of course. You're good at Astronomy, as I recall."

"I think my questioning was different," Luna said quietly. "Instead of asking about particular beads, Professor Flitwick asked what could I tell him."
Hecksban nodded. "Agreed. Attempt it after showing your previous work."
"And?"
"True, but she likes to watch," Draco said loftily. "Sometimes she notices when you run the water."
"Remus
made it a grievance. Before that, it was a matter of understanding my place." He glared down at the remains of his beans. "Now, I expect her to understand hers."
It was agonizingly, gloriously, slow. Only when he'd made an inch did Harry pull back, redistribute the lube, and start again, immediately gaining ground.  "Draco. My love."
Harry found himself glancing quickly among the people who would understand this.
She expected ranting, but he smiled even more easily than the last Harry. "Very good. And you? Still a Gryffindor?"
Harry shuddered. Voldemort's icy amusement echoed in head with no invitation. That had not been what he'd meant when he said Kingsley should tell her what he could. "Sorry," he said. "You didn't need to hear that."
"Sammy," Sammy said, shaking. "First."
"So." Professor Hecksban leaned back his desk.  "Is this class work, or something more complicated? You're both doing well, if you're wondering."
, but he wasn't sure.
"Agreed. If you give us enough information for us to find what we want, we'll kiss for you for five minutes, next time."
"If we can identify the top curse," Harry said, "rather than just removing it, it might give us a clue."
"It was clever," his memory self said boldly.  "I'm sorry I lost my temper." Around him, eyes widened further, and jaws went slack. Dumbledore said "Ah," with an air of satisfaction, and past-Harry moved forward, his pace steady as he passed through the enemy throng.
With a glance over at Draco, Harry dug in his pocket again, and pulled out the marble that had once been a portkey. "Draco.  Make me a glass, would you, please?"
"Ron!"
"Well, not really. But you know when Luna got that dog? The one that had been abused? It's like that. It would be ten times sweeter to have him come to my hand."
"Which isn't to say you're not fun," Astoria added. "Please do visit again."
Harry tried to pull loose without appearing to struggle, but Snape pretended not to notice. Trailed by the guard, they went up the stairs to the secure rooms, and Harry found himself released into a bedroom much like his own, while Snape told the Auror guard to remain outside in the corridor.
"Cousin?" he asked Draco at a whisper.
"I am
"So you just want me to tell you about it?"
Harry took a long breath.  Evaluating where everyone was, he stood and moved in front of the sideboard, where they could all easily see him. He had thought about what to say, but he couldn't find a way to make it graceful.
Hecksban looked briefly across her cot at them. “Stay quiet.”
let them define me."
“So not even a cursebreaker can lift it here,” Ron added.
After weeks of making the same potion, the brewing was fairly easy. Once they had set the cauldron aside to cool, Harry turned to Millicent.
Millicent spat out the answer like a challenge. Hermione stumbled back. Her eyes widened, and Harry didn't think it was entirely from hearing Millicent use a word like "regimen."
"I still don't think I have any."
conceited. Everything is all about you, isn't it?"
Harry nodded. "Malfoy's boy, right? But more likely, Malfoy himself."
Draco wasn't sure what about the question bothered him, but something did. He frowned. "You doubt my reasoning now?" he challenged.
"Yes," Hermione said. "That's the second time you've lost focus, and we just sat down. You liked my chicken tagine, last I knew."
"Trouble?" she asked, looking around.
Voldemort wasn't the goal. He probably wouldn't have minded if he had, but there had been enough failed attempts that I think they were pretty sure that stabbing him wouldn't work. The attack was to get enough blood for the spell they created so that I would develop attuned to his power--" Harry's words slowed as he recalled the sensation of pulling power from Snape's casting of the Dark Mark -- "and with five times the chance to destroy him."
"You would? Why?"
"No price." Harry shrugged. "It's all right, Bulstrode."
"Attack at--" Hermione confusion cleared. "Howell Parkinson's funeral?" Her eyes widened. "Oh. Her
With a snort, Draco took a bead. "Overly specific," he argued, as Harry turned it gold.
Startled, Harry straightened in the chair. "It really is cursed, then?"
"Right. We should reinforce the walls here, and then move back into the habitable areas."
, Ron."
"I'd suspected it might be that," Gilbert said evenly. "After all, Harry, here, is similarly widely regarded as showing off, but in the course of socializing with him, I have come to believe his recklessness is innate, and he is scarcely aware of how other people regard it." He smiled disarmingly at Harry, and then at Draco.  "Perhaps I should start. I am Gilbert Claudius Wilkens Clarke, Slytherin, sixth year. I have two older half-sisters, who were also in Slytherin, and a younger sister in Hufflepuff, third year."
Draco, no doubt listening from the bedroom, chose that moment to stroll out, Harry's longest shirt open over sleek grey trousers.
"It was, sort of. Without, you know, saying it, which might seem...."
"No, but you're not entirely reliable at it either, and the potion is neither easy nor safe to brew. I wouldn't want it wasted. I can form the bowl for you if you command me to do so, but it must be a command."
"If the money gets to the right person."

"We had a
"Yes. Interfering old coot."
"If we take his terms, you'll own more of the shop than we will!" Fred exploded.
"Who aren't all purebloods either." Millicent gestured down her changed body. "One-eighth
"Bulstrode," he said in acknowledgement, shaking her hand. "Can you find your way back to the Cauldron?"
After lunch, they had Defense Against the Dark Arts, which wasn't too bad. Harry didn't know the professor, of course, but he was perfectly comfortable with the sort of battle hexes under discussion. Better yet, no one seemed to find his proficiency worthy of comment. Charms was a little more difficult, but not as incomprehensible as Transfiguration.
Malfoy wrinkled her nose. "He's practically
"At a distance, yes, they learn to ignore some of the residue. But she doesn't think the time aspect changes."
Harry wasn't sure Draco and Hermione would appreciate having a fifth person along. On the other hand, he didn't think he could stop her, and that was definitely where she was heading as she strode off down the fourth floor corridor, pulling Ron along by the wrist. Ron wasn't protesting, which was worrisome, and he was nodding at the portraits, which was worse.
"Slytherin?" he asked.
Draco scowled. "Only of exploding from frustration.  This won't work."
Sirius grinned. "Not a one."
"Background, then?"
"I assure you, Slytherin will have the cup again."  Draco's eyes sparkled, and Harry bumped against him.
You let Nott stay!"
Hermione pursed her lips. Draco nudged her.
"It was Ron's off-the-cuff-interpretation of a divination picture," Harry explained. "Last spring. Draco had things to say about it."
"Whatever you may be trying to prove, Draco, I would appreciate--"
Harry,
how Cecilius would react because of watching him last year.  Keeper is a great position for learning about people."
falling,” she said. “I thought it was the Cruciatus Curse. Since we knew you were in danger, I’ve been studying first aid spells. I used one intended to prevent auxiliary damage from convulsions.”
"Don't worry about it."
Harry choked. "Perfect!"
Harry thought back. "Sirius was over the summer," he said. "And there were so many other things to say -- and so much to argue about. I didn't even remember to tell Draco, honestly.
"I thought he was quite interesting," Remus said mildly. "I admit, I've never discussed freedom with a House Elf before. Of course there is no reason that loyalty should require subservience, but it always seemed that way with them." He looked keenly at Harry.  "That was the Malfoy Elf that you freed when you were in your second year, correct?"
"No, of course not."
that I felt like I was an oddity. It's reassuring to find other kids had the same problems, even when the people raising them didn't hate them."
"Well, maybe the Owlery, if I finish," Harry amended. "If I'm not in the Common Room, I'll see you in the Great Hall, okay?"
"Mr. Potter." Snape pivoted from where he had been sneering at sample vials on his desk.  "Detention."
In the end, Harry ended up casting a cushioning charm next to the pile, and a silencing charm on the room.  Millicent tossed stones on the cushioned spot, and Harry levitated them out, one at a time, to chink into the pile. He felt like there ought to be something like Draco's glass spell for melting rock so he could bind them together. He should ask McGonagall, he decided, and then Flitwick, if she didn't know. Or maybe Draco could just do it.
"No curse?" He couldn't keep the incredulity out of his quick reply
"What about...?" She pushed in deeper, so her knuckles pressed into Harry's cheeks. Her fingertip did something that sent a sudden shiver through him.
Sighing, he laid his hand on top of hers. "I know you will, love. You'd do it for me, even if you didn't want your own Harry back, and I'm sure you do."
.  So I don't see what else I can do. If adding the potion triggers it, I have no chance to siphon it off."
"Look--"
"Oh, you're impossible. I don't see you panicking on Fridays, either."
"Of course you haven't!" Draco snapped. "He's either on dust or hiding!"
"As his stupidity was not your responsibility, his ill-behavior was not theirs."
"Waking up with you. Those few days this summer weren't nearly enough."
"Great. Cloak, now."
Slowly, the confusion cleared from her face. "Well," she said, flipping her hair back over her shoulder. "You can't blame people for being concerned, Harry." She bit her lip. "I mean, if there's been an attempt already."
"Nah, I thought I'd let you do the work." Harry kept his tone light, although again, the comment worried him. "Don't want to choke you.  Though actually, you seem to be doing that on your own."
"You're involved with one," Ron retorted.
"But you should try firewhisky," George said more brightly.
whatever Malfoy-the-girl was. He began to feel annoyed. "What's wrong with you?"
Her brief smile ended with her sticking her tongue out. "I didn't think she was your type."
"Agreed," Harry said quickly. He reached out to set a hand on Draco's blanket-covered leg. "Would you like ... well, something else?"
Her eyes widened. "But I shouldn't--"
Narcissa's hand flew to her mouth. After a moment, her hand dropped from a smile.
A flight of stairs down into the dungeons, he encountered a complication. Draco was coming up, and they spotted each other simultaneously. Harry slowed, but so did Draco. They met on a landing.
Draco snorted. "Ravenclaws are less boisterous," he pointed out. "And my housemates, of course, adapted."
"Is that a problem?"
"It's just weird, that's all."
When Parvati and Seamus arrived at the Uncommon Room on Friday, they chatted over collecting plates of food, but then went to sit separately, Parvati with her twin, and Seamus with Millicent and Cornelia. If they hadn't kissed before parting, Harry would have wondered if they had split up. Looking around, he thought that the group was more mixed than it had been.  The new Hufflepuff, a pink-cheeked blond girl named Hannah Abbot, was sitting with Susan, but they were on the long sofa, sandwiched between Luna and Linnet.  Besides, Hannah was new this week, and Susan was the only other Hufflepuff.  Cadwallader had apparently not been interested.
The thought of losing Ron for another week or more was hardly to be borne. With each step, Harry felt more weighed down by the thought. Was Ron still upset with him about the game? Even Draco felt he had the right to be, Harry recalled. What had he said?
He shrugged awkwardly. "Not a lot, or anything.
"I've finally got it," she muttered, not lifting face or quill. "How it all fits together. I need to get this down before I forget."
Ron nodded again, and set out with Fred. As soon as they were moving, Harry dropped down by Draco.
Ron's face scrunched up. "The Chaser?"
Linnet's finger stilled his lips. "Harry," she chided. "You can do better than that."
"I-- Would you be my sweetheart? I know that's all backwards...."
"Ah." Wide-eyed, Ron looked at the passage. "Um, will anyone mind?"
Ron scowled. "I think Harry can't give me assignments."
“He offered it like a sweet; a secret family curse – one he would pass on to me if I applied myself.”
crowd?"
They were too far apart to speak without being audible from the corridor. By silent agreement, they met back by the wall.
"Oh." Draco's hands flew over his face and clothes, alarm clear in his wide eyes.
"And I expect you noticed that we received exactly nothing that we were promised."
Tonks laughed. "Hm," she said, her expression mischievous, and the pink of her hair turned black, blond, and chestnut in stripes.
"We hadn't asked for that," Harry said honestly. "The first time, all we were asking was if he could tell me from Voldemort in a blood divination."
Ron silenced. Malfoy coughed slightly.
Harry couldn't think of anything, really, or at least not anything fair. Hermione nodded.
"I understood
"Oh yes. And took his best bitch with her -- pregnant yet. The bitch, that is, not the wife. So he's without a direct heir. On the other hand, that doesn't matter as long as Tatiana is around and ruling the family. The reason I brought it up is his dinner companion. The chances are he was a date, and maybe a paid one. You might want to get a look at the Avalon Club guest book, either officially or unofficially. I wanted to ask if you had a preference before I tried to finesse an invitation."
"I have contacts in several places."
Harry laughed. "Well, let me think about it. If I decide I'm going to learn anything else, I definitely think that one should come with it."
Harry made love to him as tenderly as if he were still wounded.
Harry shook his head. He wanted Ron to really understand this. "No. Next week will be soon enough."
"No." Harry let out a harsh huff of a laugh. "No, that was all the day I got caught. I didn't go back there until the row about the House Cup, and that was alone."
"So, Mr. Potter," Snape said, when they had finished their soup, and he was slicing across a slab of pink beef, "I believe we have a conversation to resume."

Harry hid his face in his hands.  He was, at once, amused, dismayed, embarrassed, flattered, and insulted, and the muddle left him unsure what would show.
"Mm?" Malfoy questioned. "Did you come?"
"Well, it's why I talked to her this summer. We have a deal."
"Snape?" That jolted her from the edge of tears. "Papa looked nothing like Professor Snape!"
"And Hermione," Parvati put in.
"I looked it up!" Harry protested hotly. "I checked Hermione's dictionary, and "kinesthetics" is the ability to know where your arms and legs are. It didn't help."
"What?" he asked, as if the question was nonsensical. He was really quite a good imitation.
"Harry!" Linnet warbled, with delight overt enough to actually get them a glance from the women discussing their children.  "How lovely to see you!
"Oh, I'm telling anyone who asks that the letter made clear I wasn't to accept. I don't think anyone saw it but Ron, Hermione, and Neville, though."
As nonchalantly as he could manage, Harry nodded. "She's okay."
"Attack you," he answered. "Go around you."  From her expression, he obviously wasn't giving the answer she wanted. "Oh.  Dark Arts?" That made him feel better, although he knew it probably shouldn't. It was easier to think about than emotional complications. "You should probably make me go see the Quiris with you, then, at the beginning of next term, which will be as soon as I can, if I don't do anything else."
Malfoy was lying on top of his back. Harry could feel him breathing. It felt rather nice. He stretched and shifted under the warm body to feel more of it.
"Then why are not applying the principle of imitative kinesthetics?"
discuss its cost.  Do not assume I am being irresponsible."
"Not a big attack," Harry reassured him. "One killing."
"Okay, but not for that, either."
"Right." That put Harry on the spot. He plowed on. "So, um, I think I shouldn't learn any more Dark Arts now. I thought maybe we could go back to that wandless magic idea?"
She grinned and tapped it "Most likely. My mum's cousin is also a breeder, and was delighted to spend all evening giving me dirt on a rival."
"It will be fine," Draco said. "Warn the others ahead of time, limit any wine and beer to those of us who are of age, and there's nothing to fear. She may not approve, but she won't tell."

"Which is another advantage to the Graphorn blood experiments as a cover," Draco said, sending Blaise an irritated look.  "One combination I tried caused an explosion, so we can explain that as well, if it happens."

"I..." Harry felt a trembling start deep in his gut, and tried to keep the surface of his body still. He could remember the details all too well: how tightly he was bound, the flat headstone unyielding against his back.
"Draco!" two voices shouted, and Draco turned quickly.
"Afraid?" Hermione sounded perplexed. "Why should Bulstrode be afraid of me?"
"But my blood...." Harry shrugged. "I don't think that's actually wrong."
"Of tricking me?"
"You didn't!"
"Too bad!" Ron said sympathetically.

He wore the cloak again, but he stumbled this time. By the fire, Remus looked up.
His voice was low, but not so low that the others couldn't hear. Pansy tittered, and Harry felt his face heat.
"Understood, sir."
"Oh dear," said Dumbledore softly. "Very well. I will relay your feelings about the matter."
"Isn't he?"
Harry nodded. "Should I ask?"
Harry considered this. "He may have been worried himself. He likes her -- your mother -- I think."
"Relax, mate. It takes a couple of months with anyone."
"I had not considered it in that light," Dumbledore said. "Forgive my presumption."
She nodded briskly.  "You'll tell us more in private, I expect. Tomorrow, after classes and before dinner?"
"Damn. And there'll be no way to visit; you can't leave Hogwarts and I can't go there." Harry propped himself up on one elbow. "Maybe they won't send me back right away?"
"And that purity of blood was unimportant," Draco said coolly. Hermione did not chide him, this time.
"You can back out of this whenever you like, of course," she added brusquely. "But if you do, my side of the deal is off, too. That's not a threat; I just won't protect him."
"You know we'd abduct you for the Dark Lord if we could, right?" Cecilius called over.
Everyone Harry could see looked up at that. Millicent appeared from around the corner, striding towards them.
Shaking her head, she turned away. "I'm not sure there's any point. If he hasn't learned by now that when he invites someone out, he should compliment them at least once, he's not going to, is he?"
"Not taking them," Draco said. "But they can go out their window onto the roof. I was quite terrified the first time I saw them do so, but of course they take naturally to heights."
"But that's not really enough." Lifting her chin, she stepped away, out of reach. "I don't want to get you in trouble, but I don't think I should let it go."
"Until it had been here too long," Hermione added, her cheeks widening with her smile.
"Muggles have lots of ways to create pictures of things that aren't real," he explained. "It's not like wizards.
Snape, Harry thought, had a lot of gall to give him that advice -- but then, perhaps it came from mistakes made. "I'll try," he said, managing not to sigh. "Do we have time to talk about Death Eaters?"
"What day is it?"
"No!" The leg tightened behind him. "Just-- Roll over! I want to be on top this time, because I

"This is great, isn't it?" Harry replied, delighted. "Well, once I'd decided I was safe."
"Yes, but she was supposed to be

Dumbledore nodded. "Perceived, but not processed. Yes, that is one of the advantages of it. It is frequently more accurate than conscious memory. However," he continued mildly, "you are quite clever. I do not intend to give you the opportunity to verify your redactive skills." He waved toward the Pensieve. "The next one, if you please.  You may watch them all with me when you are done."

as vicious as if aimed at a stranger!" Justin shot back.
"Er, yes?"
"He does seem to take unprepared to an extreme," Draco agreed.
"Oh, believe me," Draco drawled, "if I eat you, you'll enjoy it."
"If nothing Dark, then why Professor Snape?"
by being a spy." He let out a breath, and tried to let some of the old anger go with it. "Really, Severus -- that's what you're best at -- potions. And I do think you helped us more than you did Voldemort, though more important people may not be convinced. Now come back under the blankets; you're shivering."
“We can’t have someone here all the time,” Hermione objected.
Draco stepped aside. He hoped his cheeks weren't as red as they felt. Of course Potter was here as a customer.
, Draco."
Harry took the vessel and found his middle finger slid nicely into the space between the head of the snake and the next coil. The glass was not quite as thin and fine as the ones Draco had from home, but it was much less thick than those Draco had made before, and shaped like a proper snifter.
Harry grinned.  "Very," he said, answering the question intended. Then he thought about the previous year. "Not as much flying around as last time -- no Muggle shops -- but we kept ourselves entertained."
"Why do you--"
"Excellent," Dumbledore replied, as if everyone had been cheerful about the arrangements. In the hallway, he briefly laid a hand on Harry's shoulder. "I appreciate your maturity and cooperation, Harry. I know that your Aunt's house is not your first choice of dwelling place."
for a while, but yeah, I could get it in."
Up in the eighth-year boys' dormitory, Harry sank down onto the chair from his desk, and Creevy perched tailor-style on the end of Ron's bed.
“Just sore,” he said, and moved them gingerly over the edge of the bed, making the thighs burn.
"No, you idiot! Cock." Malfoy's smile was just as wicked in a girl's face, and much sexier. "While I have a cunt, at least."
"Neither of us would snog a Malfoy."
"Yeah. They don't work on me anymore," Harry completed quickly. "So changing the wards is a bit much."
"He hasn't spoken yet."
"For not charging extra?"
"That -- that Auror?"
"But as a teacher--"
"No! Just that weekend.  It's all she wants, I believe. She expressed no opinion about Christmas itself." Draco's face twisted. "The object is social introductions, not family togetherness."
scrying potion poured into a shallow marble bowl, and to this, added a few drops of Harry's blood, is that right?"
"Is she being protected?" Harry tried to sound concerned, rather than curious. He wanted to know if Dumbledore would tell him as much as Snape had.
"I can't really hear how it sounds," Harry admitted. "To me, it just sounds like sort of hissy English."
"But not involve any professors just yet," Harry countered.
At his first cry, Draco reached out, seized both paper chains and
"Of course." She frowned. "What were you sending at the other doors?"
"Well, no," Draco objected. "It isn't. We also know that the Dark Lord's new body has no nose, for example, but that does us no good."
Severus jerked back, knocking over his wine. He and Harry both froze.  Sighing, Draco charmed the wine into a liquid ball that floated over to the sink and splashed down into it.
not happy."
"Like disguising yourself.  Exactly!"
"We found your note."
"What has he done to you?"
"No. He needs to meet with a former professor."
Harry didn't think he could say anything. However, Snape apparently read his expression correctly.
"Shh." Warmth drew back over his ribs and up to his shoulder blades, and then looped down and forward again. Harry waited motionless as Draco brushed tantalizingly along the waistband of his jeans only to continue up, over his chest, and then return to his shoulder.
of you Calming Potion." He started with Justin, who took it gratefully, then moved on to Draco and Blaise.
