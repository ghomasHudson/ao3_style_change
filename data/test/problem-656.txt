It only works for seconds at a time, and he rolls his eyes and takes a large swig of it, gasping as the fiery feeling courses through his throat.
He feels one of Harry's palms slip down from his shoulder and rest over his heart, too, and he hears the soft possession when Potter also says, “
He's a bit thrown off by Blaise's sudden change of place again, but Draco has honestly stopped caring about it. There's bigger things to think about, like how Potter didn't look away from him much at all during breakfast, and how Potter didn't even try to
Draco chokes with embarrassment, scowls, and slams the door behind him as Blaise falls back to his bed in relief.
Nonetheless all Potter's done since is toss his wand back to him with great, visible gratitude and eyes loaded with questions, and Draco's done well avoiding him with just a few routine snipes when they grow too near one another to let things seem normal on the outside to the rest. But on the inside he's draining to the point of wondering why he's still here, still enduring glares and arguments, still being distrusted by Potter's friends.
His excited grey eyes take in Potter's round green stare, notice Potter glance about until the Gryffindor comprehends how tight a space they're in and just silently nods.
He comes the moment after Draco does, entirely amazed by the intensity of Draco's visceral, yet soft cry of his name. Not his surname. Not any number of insulting or bantering names. His
Draco sits in the library, not surprised when he finds Potter entering minutes after he does and pretending to browse about again.
Draco reclines his head as much as possible and lets his fingers trace Potter's bicep down to his wrist of the free hand resting on his thigh. “Yes,” he breathes out with a sigh.
Harry waits until Malfoy is far enough away to slide the cloak from his body, wiping the bit of nervous sweat from his brow. His heart's pounding the way it used to do when he'd sneak about Hogwarts with his hunches, but the rest of him is also reacting lively, too: His nerves are almost electric and jerking his limbs, and when he'd seen Malfoy emerge from the bit of wall he'd entered, Harry had stared in shock.
And when Potter eventually gives up, leaving after a half an hour when Draco doesn't even glance his way once, Draco sighs out a shaky breath and imagines what might have happened had Blaise not interrupted today...he silently thanks Zabini, no matter his friend's personal reasons, for saving his stupid arse.
he know? Who else studied Potter for years? Who else stared at him enough, even after the War—especially after the War—to be sure the beloved Hero was functioning?
“Why did you leave her, all those years ago?” Draco asks, the burning need to have that question answered having haunted him for-fucking-ever.
Each day Harry grits his teeth when Zabini's tall body shields most of Malfoy from his vision across the Great Hall at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and each night Harry opens the Map in bed with his wand softly out for light, staring at Draco Malfoy's name in the Slytherin dorms and waiting.
Draco shifts for a moment, and then there's a soft light again from the tip of that wand Harry knows so well, and Harry stares upward. He sees the grey eyes become gentle and anxious and then grow bold like he loves before they
Draco rolls his eyes, still feeling the heat in his cheeks, and he can't help but wonder for a single moment just what Potter's cup might tell him. Despite its chances being utter shit at likely being real, it is still a strangely melancholic thought to imagine some girl in Potter's future, and his face falls slightly.
Harry's reclined on a lounge chair, hands going from holding his head to sliding down over his face for the briefest of moments. And that's all it takes for him to suck in a breath, square his shoulders, and shove his own feelings down to his gut where they belong.
Draco stomps Blaise's foot as he hears Weasley's snickers from among several Gryffindors chuckling lowly, and he turns, noticing that the professor is smiling at him and gesturing for him to step on down to her table at the front.
Potter sheepishly swishes the bottle a little. “I honestly don't know. Ginny and I had been sort of expected to be together, I think. And Cho was attractive, but...I got more out of that for having any more reason to be jealous of Cedric. People thought he was perfect.”
, thank fuck. And when Malfoy had come to him later that night in the dorms, asking quietly to be penciled in twice a week after a class that Blaise
in the library when Potter's sneaking skills fail him and Draco rises to get another text and finds him awkwardly nose-first in a book Potter hastily grabbed, titled
Draco snickers. His sympathy is so deep that it has no end. He boldly reaches and pats Harry's leg once before resting his hand to his right knee. “I understand. I mean...why do you think I'm stuck?”
Draco starts suspecting Blaise is acting strange when at breakfast the next morning Zabini sits across from him instead of beside him, blocking his usually open view of Potter.
“Yes, well, apparently his quota for me isn't full yet,” Draco mumbles, looking forward as well as Trelawney rights herself and nearly chokes on her own large scarf when shutting a cabinet door.
And then Draco Malfoy appears in his vision standing before the solid wall, dressed not in night clothes but in his clothes from earlier that day. The Slytherin seems to pause a moment, head cocked as if listening and hearing Harry's heavy breathing.
to acknowledge his presence in the library today as he has been doing with a smirk or sneer the last few times.
But not now. Not when he's been burning in a unique way when he's caught those grey eyes staring at him softly while no one else is paying any attention.
Still, now he's doubly fucked with both Potter sneaking after him and Blaise acting all odd about changing his time in the alcove.
He stops trailing them as Zabini drags his person of interest towards the dorms, not stopping despite the arguing echoing down the halls behind them. Zabini's never interfered with the routine that Harry knows of, and he's watched it fucking closely enough the past couple months to know.
He huffs and looks away, then lifts the pot and pours the tea. One sniff tells him it's nasty stuff, and Draco scrunches his face, but takes a sip and then another. His eyes close as he decides to ignore the rest of the room, and he actually finds himself doing as the professor suggests without meaning to do so as the magic of the tea works: Draco tunes everyone out for a moment and just imagines himself in a vastness of space and time, and something inside of him reaches out, feeling a pulse. He grabs it in his mind, pulling it like a string, fascinated by the warmth and humored loving feeling it gives off.
“You're right,” Harry finally sighs and reaches for the bottle again. Draco gives it to him, watching Potter stare into the liquid of the glass pensively. “Something is...on my mind, yes.”
His trousers are straining against his erection, and his hands roam Potter's shoulders the way Potter's do up his legs and stomach.
And he wants that Gryffindor heart all for himself, here in his palm that rests upon Harry Potter's chest.
Like every prior instance of it happening, Draco feels the heat sizzle between them, and some part of his mind wonders how
Draco sits straight up, bottle swishing a bit in hand. Grey eyes are firm upon Potter's subdued form. “You...what?”
He's managed to avoid the Chosen One as much as possible the last couple months of this strange term mostly because he has no answers to questions he knows Potter wants to ask. Draco doesn't know why he spared him at the Manor, and he doesn't know why he tossed the idiot his wand in the end, risking his own fucking neck in a rash of Gryffindor-like courage that
“Fascinating! Mr. Potter has a dragon. Such a rare symbol, you know, but it is one of raw power focused by the dragon's control and cleverness. You've a handful here, Mr. Potter, and my advice to you is to be respectful of the dragon by seeing all the little parts of it—the magnificent fire, the scales, the wings and the hidden, protected heart. Dragons are such misunderstood creatures with their temperaments. Don't fret if your love is a bit covetous of you; it is a protective trait too often mistaken for selfishness.”
And Harry swallows, fingers gripping the book tightly in his hands as he continues to hide and stare and ignore the rush through his body when Malfoy runs a tired hand through his gorgeous hair.
The professor brushes her unruly hair from her face and stares him down with her magnified owlish eyes. “Are you ready to look?”
of all people in the fucking library. Harry calls it luck that the Slytherin didn't fight him, didn't hex him right then and there and instead played back until both of their legs were threaded through the other's beneath the table's surface.
And Draco shrugs at him and goes back to pretending he's reading anything at all out of his bloody Potions book while Potter sits there silently watching him, declaring his intentions.
It pisses him off, but he gets it, and that's why he's even stopped glancing Potter's way at dinner when he sees Weasley's sister sitting so close to the person he wants more than anything.
“The difference, Harry, is that the first group only cares about a name that was established before you ever knew its significance, and the latter group cares about what
One morning he wakes up, gasping, from a dream of yelling at Malfoy in the library with his demand of answers to
Even so, Blaise isn't stupid. He's seen the way Draco's become quieter since he's inserted himself between them as a partial buffer to help his silly friend, and he's
Harry Potter only smirks handsomely with confidence that both rattles and emboldens Draco and says, “Just trying to be respectful to you, you misunderstood, covetous lizard.”
staring at you,” Blaise teases, looking over Draco's head as Draco refuses to turn his face to follow.
Draco can conceive of why. The papers and coverage of Harry Potter as a topic haven't dimmed over the years since the War; they've simply changed focus on him from a child to an adult, digging into speculations as to his personal life and covering the times he is public.
The smile eases his panic, though his nerves still dance, and Draco takes what air he can get. “Harry?”
A few weeks of adjusted routine have let him find release in a mental and physical way he never had much before, and Draco now walks down halls a little less annoyed and a lot more confident, gaining his old stride back.
jealous, the kind that comes about when one fancies another person and feels threatened in it. Potter's behavior as of late certainly points to it, including the one very nasty glare sent to him just this evening at dinner when Blaise had risked a glance over his shoulder at Potter's table.
And when Draco and Potter both stare at him in mild surprise before turning to look at one another across the room in what is at first mutual relief before it becomes glares covering bared egos, Blaise understands.
Harry manages to untangle himself from some of the people and strides after Malfoy a bit, hoping to seem as if bored and going to speak to Slughorn for some advice in the dungeons.
He eyes Draco's breathless form as he enters the room with a swagger in the low light, clothes entirely mussed and hair sticking several directions. There's a large mark on his neck right at his collar, and it's nearly as red as his clearly kissed lips are.
Harry laughs softly, warmly, and the hand on his hip shifts direction, moves southward until it's warm and heavy over Draco's hard cock and trousers. “Good.”
Long, slender fingers he's admired for months in the library weave through his, tighten them together, and Harry finds a strange sense of peace and comfort as Malfoy bucks beneath him, thrusts awkwardly upward with his hips over the stone bench, and clenches his fingers in Harry's hair so tightly Harry actually feels pain. Thankfully it's pain that crosses with pleasure, and his own demanding need is pulsing and ready and wanting, too.
“As if they'll be more than a clump of crap for her,” Crabbe mutters under his breath, and Pansy shakes her head, getting Trelawney's attention off of her before Draco watches Pansy jerk Crabbe by the ear and bark something horrible into it.
Because this is about being a friend, and because no one but Lovegood's ever even considered that Draco's held a torch for the Gryffindor.
is Blaise's little game—toying with Potter and himself to get them nagging each other for his amusement, of course, but giving Draco tools to agitate Potter more so than usual by subtly making him rearrange his schedule.
,” Draco gripes, but snickers when Harry chuckles quietly. He glances about them, taking in all the damn pots of flowers outside with a little glare. “And, naturally, I don't have my medicine with me.”
class, he knows he can break later in the Slytherin alcove, hand around himself and lips parted in a moan, mind running rampant with images of Potter being the one to touch him, of Potter shoving him into a wall outside the Charms room and kissing him senseless.
about it, not even perturbed by the cups in class either, and then he smirks, follows Potter on down, and speeds past, risking
the same to him for a long time, far back to when they'd fought in the bathroom and Harry had learned what it really was to feel shame. Just briefly thinking about it makes him clench his eyes and wish again that he'd not used that awful spell.
smirking Zabini. It's always felt that way around Potter, though, hasn't it? Maybe he drank too much of that strange tea.
Draco barely hears a Hufflepuff shush the Ravenclaw. It's as if he can't move. He certainly can't put the cup down, and he absolutely cannot tear his eyes away from its contents.
points to Draco for the way Malfoy had caught the title, sneered, and quietly asked Potter just how well the text was aiding him in romancing the Weasel. Potter, of course, had snapped some nonsense Draco's way before even knowing what was being talked about, before even looking at the cover of the book in his fucking hands, and then he'd blushed severely as he quickly shoved it back on a shelf and ran for his scrap of dignity.
He tries to sniff again, gets a little more air through his nose this time, and sighs long and low. “Because, Harry. I'd only be in their way.”
But he can't. He can't stop seeing that smirk of knowledge on Malfoy's face, and he can't stop feeling that need to kiss it away, can't
Malfoy sucks in air, and his long fingers grip Harry's tousled hair, and Harry decides to try something he's dreamed about extremely recently after seeing those little Malfoy feet move along the Map so late.
The smile that crosses Harry's lips is dazzling. Blinding. And it holds Draco's gaze without any mercy, refusing to let him look away.
Harry slips the cloak off once he gets to a secluded spot far enough out of the dungeons and tucks it into his bag with annoyance.
“Mine,” Draco murmurs instinctively, nails scratching over the muscle there as he feels the heart pounding against his fingers.
He waits in the spot he remembers being the first time he saw Malfoy disappear, the cloak covering him head-to-toe in the dark with only torches for light in the dungeons.
He hears the thrashing, knows Draco is deeply asleep, but try as he might to smother himself to death with his pillow to not hear Potter's bloody name being
So Draco smiles to himself as he goes to dinner after dropping his things off on his bed, Zabini at his side as usual. They enter the Great Hall, and Draco at once feels the hot green eyes on him with almost
Harry just hopes it's enough. He hopes he's anything decent because he's never done this before, never thought about doing this before with another bloke, but he knows he wants it
“Thanks for the reminder.” Potter looks him over gently, kindly. Almost shyly. “Do you...I mean, if you've not dated since, clearly this someone is more special than a passing fancy.”
It's irritated him enough because where those grey eyes had often been pretending to look away from him as though they'd never been settling on him at all, now they're
“Ahh,” he gasps out, catching his breath. Harry smirks down at it, then at Draco. “All right, Malfoy. You tell me why you've been alone all these years, and I'll tell you what's in my head.”
And Draco's heart pounds as they sit there for another almost forty minutes, silent, yet talking loads with their legs and feet constantly rubbing one another.
expression, sees Draco's eyes widen dramatically, and steps forward long enough to add as the spell begins to take effect on the wall, “I imagine it'll be over quick if you think about Potter. Don't forget to clean up.”
Draco's eyes narrow upon his parchment as he thinks about the timing of it all, about possible motives each idiot might have.
does. It's as if the bloody rooms have gone up another few degrees of temperature already, and Draco holds his sneer perfectly, bouncing his brows up and down twice until Potter gets a shoulder jerk from Weasley, who merely scowls towards the Slytherins.
Draco's reaction is instantaneous. His hand slips from Potter's brow, grabs that fucking sexy hair, and jerks that handsome face even closer for the hottest kiss of his fucking life. Harry moans into his mouth, and Draco tastes the Firewhiskey between them, strokes Harry's tongue with his once, and pulls back enough to get more air through his stupid nose.
“I hope they don't,” Harry admits, shuddering. He shakes his head, too, one arm leaving his knees to gesture as he explains. “And no, I'm not seeing a muggle woman. I met with one to buy some furniture, and someone followed me, clearly.”
“Rotten scoundrel,” Draco groans again, feeling the warm fingers trace his shape and tease at the button of his trousers. “I...it's...it's for
. Harry kisses him enough to distract the gorgeous snake, and when Draco starts to let go of him to hold his face and deepen the kiss, Harry smirks and backs away, bending lower to kiss a path across Draco's throat to the open buttons of his shirt.
Draco sighs, relieved, at finding the bait to lead Potter away from his endangered heart. “Of course. Who wasn't, honestly? The fucking Hufflepuff was gorgeous.”
Such thoughts nag Blaise as he sleeps and bat at him through class the next day, and he decides, silently, to perhaps just let things be. Blaise doesn't want to see Draco break, but his friend
So what if Potter had caught himself falling as Draco had expected of the athlete, rolling for a moment and bending with his robes shifted to the side for Draco to see something he's been growing more and more curious about each passing day?
As Draco curses the apparent costs of being a good mate to someone, Potter murmurs, “I know. That's...one reason I didn't, too.”
Of course Malfoy would have simply gone around Harry's awareness by waiting until late at night to do whatever it is.
He doesn't dare look at first, because even if he doesn't believe it to be worth anything, there's just that slim chance it
Potter's mouth leaves his to travel down his neck, sucking and licking, and Draco gasps, slides his fingers inside Potter's thin shirt to touch hot skin, digs them into a muscled back.
And as Trelawney's voice swells, signaling he should pay attention, Draco takes two more seconds to look Potter's way. His mouth drops open slightly when he catches Potter staring at him oddly; the idiot blinks when their eyes meet, and then he immediately turns away, rosier through the cheeks for some reason.
But this time he's not rooting for Draco to overwhelm and smash Potter to bits, finally, after all these years. Nope. His money will make itself better with a new bet.
“Silly snake,” Harry teases and cups him, strokes over the trousers until Draco moans his name. “So tell me, Draco. Tell me what you do in here in
While the need to know Malfoy's secret is burning hotly within him, Harry feels strangely jealous of Zabini's sudden behavior and equally, bizarrely, protective of Draco Malfoy, too.
“Yes,” he agrees, lips to Potter's brow moving to kiss that famous scar. “Yours, you fucking arsehole. Always
Stalking after a possibly plotting Malfoy is excusable, but going after a Malfoy who might be doing nothing harmful at all makes him feel wrong.
Draco breathes rapidly, forces himself to sit down upon the bench, and holds his burning face in his cool palms.
it is. Rivals can know someone better than friends might. We don't wear rosy glasses to color you with, yes?”
Malfoy is clearly onto him about some of his snooping, if he's adjusted his routine so much. The Slytherin hasn't gone to the alcove since that Harry can catch, and he's been in and out of the library mostly instead, ignoring Harry there.
Harry frowns, but shrugs and rests the bottle against his knee. “Well, I promise I'm not upset over Ginny getting married. We haven't been a couple for almost three years, and that's absolutely fine.”
Draco slows his walk, mind going faster than his broom in the wind as he tries desperately not to cling to what he's just seen and heard. It's meaningless, and it's barely magic at all. Trelawney's full of it, and her vision of the Grim in Potter's cup a while back was entertaining enough for him to pretend to believe and rile Potter up with it.
“Fuck off,” Draco whispers, heart racing. “Why? If you and she genuinely parted without problem, and you're here today fully supportive, why the
He watches Malfoy's little feet strutting through the dungeons toward the dorms just like they have the last few times he's done this private investigation, and when Malfoy reaches a certain point between the dorms and Snape's old rooms, his feet vanish right off the Map.
“Could always Apparate. There's a muggle pharmacy not far from here. They've got decent medicine for that sort of stuff.”
Because not only has he made his strange admiration and want of Draco Malfoy known to his old rival with their seeking legs and constant hall presences, but he thinks Malfoy is telling him something, too. He thinks that Malfoy wants him to figure it out, wants him to
He rolls his eyes, but stands and moves to the aisle between the sections. Grey eyes dart down to his side where Potter is sitting a few seats inside to his left, and the green there isn't glaring like usual but is staring oddly again. Almost as if curious.
He even throws an old, familiar smirk Potter's way once upon passing the Gryffindor into the Great Hall for dinner, shoving Potter away from him and getting an open mouth with the little glare thrown back.
Rather than examine it, Harry turns on a cold, alerting shower, and later that morning awkwardly glances towards Malfoy's table at breakfast, green eyes taking in the fresh look the snake seems to have about him as he retorts something Zabini's just said. Malfoy looks healthier than he has, thankfully, and Harry just
Entirely satisfied with himself, Blaise sits across the library watching Potter watch Draco, both of them totally unaware of his personal seat to their special kind of sport.
Trelawney summons a Ravenclaw down to try the tea, explaining to the class that this kind of reading involves special teas and special symbols that can be difficult to decipher as they're related to a specific person tied to the viewer.
“Point is there's no reason for you to be nervous over someone as such,” Draco grunts, mood souring more with his swallowed heart, stuffed nose, and a reminder of his own standing in society. “Besides, I understand. Personally.”
possibly out there who'd love you,” someone mumbles between the Slytherin and Gryffindor sections while he's staring at the cup.
Harry guides their clasped fingers back downward to his own cock, notes the exact moment that Draco snaps aware to what he's doing, and sighs inwardly as Malfoy tries to return how he feels, tries to touch him as much and with as fierce a possession in those slender fingers soft upon him while groaning louder and louder above Harry's head.
Draco says nothing, hoping Blaise will drop the subject, but his friend snickers and whispers, “Five galleons says he wants you.”
“I know, believe me. I guess what I'm saying is that after years of thinking on it, I think part of me was...attracted...to Cedric, you know? A little, anyway.”
like Blaise being in the way in the Great Hall, and he clearly detests Blaise in the halls or library, too, when he does venture in to sit by Draco and drive Potter insane with his additional presence.
Draco has been using the alcove late at night to avoid Potter, and it's worked perfectly. He's had to use it almost nightly now with Potter being so bold and daring, weaving their legs together in the library twice a week without fail and following Draco to and from the Great Hall a few times a day.
He comes with a moan to the visual in his head of Potter on his knees with that often scowling mouth soft and warm around his cock, and Draco's stomach clenches harder. But even as he sighs in relief of tension from Potter's ridiculous staring contest in Charms today, he feels a bit empty, too.
“So share your misery. Might as well. I can barely breathe, yet here I am risking my life out here for your moping,” Draco teases, lip curving up as Harry smiles down at the bottle. “You
Later that afternoon when Draco enters the dorm, looking a little more relaxed, Blaise rightly assumes his friend's gone to his new scheduled time in the alcove, and he only nods to himself, hoping that maybe Potter will chill out on his trailing after Draco a bit and go back to his glaring.
They pant in the tight space that feels even smaller now, darker and with less air between the two of them gulping loudly. Harry briefly kisses the tip of Draco's very nice cock before resting his lightning scar right to Malfoy's chest, right to Draco's heart.
The rest of the guests continue dancing and laughing mutely behind them, and Draco blinks rapidly, trying to deal with a drunken body and a brain struggling to be rapidly sober in its shock all while Potter grows to fidget beside him uncomfortably.
He carefully adjusts, pretending to be bored, and makes sure his robes cover his front where he's possibly visible and panicking over it.
Two days later, though, Blaise rolls his eyes when Potter is in the library, watching Draco and casually following him back out and down the halls.
Blaise acts like nothing is different as he butters his toast and reaches for jam and tea, and Draco frowns at him, but in the end lets it go while trying to glance over Zabini's tall form to Potter in the Great Hall. Draco flushes slightly when he sees Potter trying to do the same thing, leaning left and right to see around Blaise's back to get a look at him, too.
pair of bloody eyes upon him at once. His face thankfully isn't so warm now, even though he knows Potter is staring, too, because he's far too annoyed to even be down here to care about people eyeballing him.
Harry instantly pulls him half-off his chair and over Potter's own body, snogging the life out of him with unrestrained need.
Something has to give soon, he decides, still waiting for whatever it is he's waiting for to show itself. Something has to give, or he will, and Harry has
Potter snickers against him, but angles his face for a kiss, fingers moving to grip at his hip. “I've spent
The time for his heart's introduction to the world is coming, though. He feels it rapidly approaching, and when he sneaks out of the dorm to the alcove, desperately needing some relief from the thoughts Potter constantly inspires in him now, Draco knows the tipping point has come.
Potter startles next to him, jerking slightly at the sudden sound and demand of his voice. Green eyes blink in the evening lights of pink and red, orange and purple, and Potter shrugs, naturally, with a deflective, “Nothing.”
Harry can barely swallow without choking as he shifts back enough, feeling Draco's physical accompanying response to that moan slide down his throat safely. He tightens, everything within him tightens, and he bursts, relaxing only when he feels Draco keep hold of him, as if trying to claim every bit of Harry that releases.
Potter grins and takes it from him, downing his own coughing gasp even as he sighs in appreciation for the prized liquor. Draco receives it back when the bottle is held out again, and he settles against his chair, long legs crossing at the bottom.
His grey eyes dart about more than usual in the afternoons a couple days a week, and he disappears between classes where he'd once been easy to track straight to the library.
Green eyes lift up. They're definitely not entirely sober, but they're still sharper than Draco expected them to be.
Draco keeps to himself at his usual table with his work out before him, and Potter breaks expectation again by coming to sit in the chair opposite him.
“Shove off,” Draco growls back, legs crossing awkwardly at the ankles beneath the desk as he wills his stupid body to cool
Harry suddenly moves, standing slightly so he can adjust the chair to be even closer to Draco's at his side. Draco stares at him, head throbbing with slight headache and eyes moist and reddening from continually breathing in fucking pollen. Potter is just scant space away, face tilted against the pillow of his chair, the green eyes boring into him within breathing distance.
. Draco brings the bottle to his lips without looking, sipping a little more before he shoves it away, overburdened. He feels Potter take it from him, their fingers brushing warmly together, and he fights the shiver that threatens his entire body so close for Harry to witness.
The dinner is just as beautiful and delicious, and he partakes of the five course meal alongside everyone else, sandwiched between Longbottom and Lovegood. While Neville chats away with Ron to his left at the wedding party table, Draco notices Luna staring at Potter up from them.
Beyond ecstatic, curious, and turned the fuck on, Harry Potter follows, rushing a little in the cloak to make it just in time.
He also knows what Draco Malfoy feels like to kiss, knows what the Slytherin tastes like and how smooth and hard his long cock is in Harry's hand. He knows what his dream self had always known would be there, and Harry succumbs to that tie between them, lips meshing with Draco's as he palms that heated hardness in his hand with desire.
Potter cackles loudly next to him, one broad palm smacking a thigh. “Damn, I forget how funny you are sometimes.”
And he settles into his seat more with a contented sigh, wishing he had some fucking food next to him to finish the arena's image.
“So, talk. Or drink. Or both. Keep me company, Potter. Anything to keep me away from a drunk Granger trying to drag me out for a dance because she thinks it's
our times were our own,” Draco snaps, frowning and crossing his arms. “Why the hell should I rearrange my time?”
“Harry, I'm not bothered by...I won't judge you for it being a bloke, all right?” he manages to spit out, those fabled butterflies making him almost nauseous. “It's fine. Just surprised me.”
“He's everything,” Draco says softly, eyes downcast. “I gave him everything I've ever had. And he is everything to me.”
Potter catches his frustrated sniff, smiles, and almost shyly glances to him as Harry sits up more in his seat. “Um. Just...something. Got reminded of a...thought I've been dealing with, is all.”
But he relaxes back into the chair, scowling as he drinks more and feels the alcohol really start to take effect. “Well, Potter, it's complicated. Father wants me to marry among a certain circle of people, even tried to arrange something between Pansy and I. She's...a sister to me, for one, and for two, she only cared for me in such respect in school. She's grown out of it, thank Merlin, and we both refused the arrangement. And it wouldn't...wouldn't matter anyway.”
, putting out the light. He leans back until he can sit down on the little bench that he's spent so much time in here upon, touching himself to thoughts of the person right before him now, and Draco smiles in the dark when he feels Potter bend down to kneel between his legs, warm palms spreading themselves over Draco's thighs.
“Unfair trade. For all I know, you could have some obsession with Warbeck and have been writing her secret fan letters for years while I pour my secrets to you for
Inwardly curious and very flustered at Potter's direct attentions on him, Draco subtly kicks Potter's shin under the table while turning a page in his book.
, and right then and there in the fucking quiet of his own ex's wedding, Potter declares to his face without blinking, “I've wanted to tell him for a long time.”
Malfoy toward the Great Hall, Harry is in step at his side. Nervously he glances over and sees Malfoy looking everywhere but at him, and Harry bumps the stubborn snake's arm with his in reflex to be
So he waits and watches again this year, this ridiculous excuse of a year where they are all buried face deep in N.E.W.T.s preparations and little else. He waits for the matches to resume, for the tourney to begin anew with clean slates between the pair of them since the definitive events of the past months, but to his shock nothing happens. Potter goes about his business with his mixed House crowd of friends, and Malfoy withdraws into himself in a way he never has—just sits through each class silently, elbowing him at dinner occasionally if he can manage to agitate the pale snake just enough.
All he does know about that moment is that with Potter seeming dead he'd felt dead himself, resigned to doom, and wishing it was already all over. But the second Potter had tumbled from Hagrid's arms to stare that monster down, Draco had felt hope—true hope—for the first time, along with relief his brain can't begin to catalog somewhere in his subconscious's well of feelings for Potter.
“Bastard. Always thinking the worst,” Draco admonishes and pushes at Potter slightly in retaliation.
Harry's smiling again and to anyone but apparently he and the Ravenclaw, it would be entirely convincing. A second later Luna looks to him right at her side, and the message is clear.
But Potter holds firm to him and kisses him once more, admitting, “I know. I'm sorry. But I don't anymore. I even got...worried, when Zabini got in the way.”
When he leaves class this time, debating if he should even try for the alcove for his slotted appointment at all now, he hears the steps behind him, muffled, but firmly following.
“Volunteers? Come now, your section is very engaging at times. Ms. Parkinson, would you care to try the special leaves?”
But Draco Malfoy sits nearby, totally unaware of his thoughts or presence, grumbling to himself about some ingredient counteractions as he scribbles down notes with a black quill.
Harry shifts, rolls to his left shoulder to stare right at Draco's profile. “Why haven't you told him?”
As he chews on his apple, Blaise smirks to himself and weighs his galleons on Draco still winning, but with him winning Potter
did a whole spread over it. Some muggle woman?” Draco wants to sneer, but doesn't. Instead he winks and snickers softly, “That rag will be full tomorrow about your ex marrying and pitying you. I can see the headline.
“Your someone is a bloke, too?” Harry asks, eyes so goddamn round behind his glasses that they could rival the moon now, as it hangs high above them in the dusk.
Blaise Zabini lies staring up at the canopy of his bed, now feeling a mild sense of guilt for his part in possibly making Draco's situation worse. Because while he'd always imagined Draco to be attracted to Potter in their rivalry, he's
here in the dark, in the magicked space that he's likely broken all the rules for in sneaking a Gryffindor into it with him.
When the pair kisses, laughing at the same time, cheers erupt in the crowd. His gaze immediately moves to the face he always keeps aware of in any room he ever enters; he's done it for years now. Green eyes light with the smile that touches upon the thinner lips, but there, just there in the off-shine of the glowing candles against that emerald, is a hint of something.
“Can you deal with his effects long enough if we just move the time down an hour or two?” he offers, hoping that might be enough to throw Potter off sniffing after Draco until he can discern Potter's real motivation.
At first the routine for this new development seems to be restrained to the same two days a week when Malfoy would disappear in the afternoons before. Over a brief spot of time, though, Harry sees the amount increase until it's almost nightly.
moan in his ear as Harry gently bites at his ear lobe, arms under his and around clasping his shoulders from behind and holding them tightly together.
He's got to fix it somehow, got to do something to spare Draco the backlash of the final match coming lest it destroys his mate's soft emotions hidden from even Malfoy himself.
“Of course he would,” Blaise says for him, more pleasant and mannered than the bastard's ever sounded in his fucking life.
“I didn't...I didn't mean that, Draco. But thank you,” Harry says, confusing the hell out of what sober voice is in Draco's head keeping him talking. Potter grips the neck of the bottle tighter, thumb rubbing over the opening of the mouth of it. Draco's brain immediately conjures up another image, a much more
And then a broad palm cups the side of his face, and Draco stops breathing, regardless of his stuffed sinuses.
The Hufflepuff glances about shyly when she notices the rest of the students focus on her curiously, and she mumbles, “She read leaves that were supposed to reveal something about one's true love.”
already cast upon it. Potter's chair is far to the side, mostly away from the eyes, and Draco takes a second to glance up at the full moon starting to move up the sky, unobstructed by clouds and enhanced by the last bit of sun.
But he can't help but wonder what it would be like if these fantasies he allows himself twice a week would ever become more than simple thought.
The bartender holds his hands up to indicate no offense meant, then slides the bottle as requested. Draco goes behind the crowd, able to avoid people much easier as he's not quite as beloved or personally known by them as Potter is, and he pauses by the long window.
Blaise drags Draco with him through the dungeons, ignoring the bitching at his back from the posh git demanding to be let go, and he stops only when he stands before the magicked bit of wall. Zabini pulls his wand out, mutters the secret incantation taught to him by his uncle, and the alcove shows itself.
How he manages to make drinking fucking tea into something sensual, Draco doesn't know, but Potter manages to do it perfectly. Draco's teeth gnash his lower lip, his fingers grip the desk, and he feels himself harden a bit again, terrified but unable to do a damn thing about it.
It might even be Draco's own fault for never speaking with Potter after the Battle here and answering questions Potter had tried asking and gave up bothering him with since.
“Am not,” Draco spits, grey eyes solely focused upon Potter as he begins pouring his own cup down below. “Like any of that is real.”
At first he's quite determined to wait out the magic and flee the area in case Blaise is watching for his exit. But then he thinks back to what Zabini had said—that the space is timed, yes, but he'll only be let out when he's performed the intended action the magic is covering from others.
Draco stares at him, not even trying to hide it as he attempts to comprehend the action and its meaning and the heat of Potter's leg to his own. And it's only with his own staring that Potter finally breaks a little, glances away and grows rosy through his cheeks, slumps in his chair and bends his knee to Draco's slightly.
he shares with Potter, Blaise simply nodded and marked it, not needing to push Draco anymore than that.
Draco steps around him, pale eyes standing out against their slight spots of purple around them, and he peers into the dark hole with a sneer. “The bloody hell is that? Are you planning to throw me in there and kill me, finally, or what? Don't think I haven't caught onto your annoyed looks lately.”
For if Potter is spying on him, it's likely he still only thinks the worst of Draco, and Draco then doesn't know if he's better off cutting these needs entirely out of him or if he's only making things worse by using the stupid secret room to enable the desire.

The both of them are digging into his already very busy schedule by making him think far too much about
Potter pushes closer into him with the kiss, and Draco finds his neck jammed between the ceiling and Potter and grunts, one hand moving out of the cloak to push a little at Harry's chest.
He doesn't understand what's going on, but he believes Zabini knows what Malfoy is up to and has been doing all this time. Zabini had been standing exactly near where the spot was, as if he knew its precise location, and likely also its purpose.
personality. But you must be careful, Mr. Malfoy. Lightning is as destructive as it is empowering. Be cautious with your love, but unafraid. Embrace their wildness and enfold yourself into their energy with trust,” Trelawney predicts across from him, sitting his cup down and clapping her hands. “Another volunteer?”
want from him,” Blaise begins quietly next to him as they hear the Hufflepuff drink a bit loudly. “You owe me five galleons,
While he isn't really one for weddings and all, Draco could admit that even a Weasley can have taste. The hall rented from some old society witch is gorgeously decked with streams of red and gold, and Ginny Weasley stands across from a grinning Dean Thomas with a smirk that makes Draco smile to see.
Draco jerks Potter's head to the side and bites along the bared throat. “You imbecile. I've thought of little else for
One particular match Blaise awards Potter victory because Potter manages to rattle Draco well enough by plopping down outside near where Malfoy and Blaise had sat on the weekend, both bickering about N.E.W.T.s. Blaise pretends to not pay a lick of attention while Draco grows continuously uncomfortable from Potter's blatant staring before the idiot Gryffindor walks past with a likely unconsciously sensual strut and a smirk.
, only to have the posh prick smirk and Harry reach across and grab that pale hair to kiss the bloody expression off the fucking Slytherin. He wakes up terrified to tented sheets and an erection that
And it's only when Draco sits down to Charms and catches that hot, determined green gaze on him that Draco remembers feeling watched last week, and he suddenly
It's not easy. There's lots of people trying to talk to him in the way, and Harry politely tries to weave through them, green eyes solely focusing on the tall pale Slytherin elegantly walking down the hall away from the crowd dispersing from class.
He breathes in again, feeling a slight hint of headache now, and walks forward enough to catch Harry's attention before plopping elegantly down upon the lounger next to him with a scowl, bottle in his hand.
His fingers still rest against Potter's brow, but he can't stop the shaking in them. His heart pounds through his veins, his pants and trousers feel even more uncomfortable tilted this way on his side with his desire coursing through him, and Harry leans closer, green eyes more open in that moment than they've ever been to Draco Malfoy in his life.
“Like this?” Potter asks, popping buttons and sliding his hand right under Draco's pants, wrapping his fingers around the heated cock hidden there.
Potter folds his knees, wrinkling his suit a bit as he hooks his arms around them on the chair. “I want someone, yes.”
Harry just knew that after Zabini's change again at breakfast that he had to act fast. He didn't know what was going on between the two Slytherins, and it made him nervous. Jealous. Afraid. If
Blaise understands and is even encouraging of it, happy to keep the pair of them sneering and smirking in the halls and library and have Draco stay reserved to protect himself from Potter's advantage over him.
Fucking odd. Draco cracks one eye open, arches a brow, and nods against his chair's pillow. “Yes, Potter. Really.”
Whispers and rumbles of sound immediately erupt in the room, and Draco at first refuses to look at the one pair of eyes he can
When Ron enters and asks him what he's thinking about that's gotten him so rosy cheeked, Harry just shrugs him off, climbing into bed with his suppressed desires coming alive in his dreams again for him to wake, entirely aware to why he can't let anything go...to why he
Draco takes the hit against his leg and tries one more time to get Potter fleeing away with a higher smack of his heel, very uncertain of just what the fuck is even happening anymore between the two of them.
Malfoy quickly looks to him, finally, stares but a single second, and as he faces forward again, he sends an elbow right into Harry's side and pushes past quicker into the condensing flow of students.
Harry shudders against him, against that firm body he's dreamed about for a while now. Something in him urges to dominate like it does then in those sexy moments of prowess he hasn't felt much otherwise, and Harry gives into the feeling, takes claim of the next kiss and rubs the pad of his thumb under the head of Draco's cock after his latest sliding squeeze.
him with rawness that he's just heard, and he can feel the Slytherin arch his back as much as possible towards Harry as Harry lowers his mouth again and takes more, sliding away to suckle slightly before resuming a steady rhythm. Draco's arms lie heavily about his shoulders for a second while he tries to find a way to deal with the onslaught.
“And what would that be, my dear?” Trelawney asks, eyes magnified behind her giant glasses. Honestly, the woman always appears to be a sentient mass of wiry hair, robes, and eyes. Terrifying.
with him, he has to follow after him again, but with Malfoy going at random points throughout the nights of the week, Harry has to use a little magic. A little divination luck of his own.
Harry feels immediately slighted, disappointed, and vaguely rejected in a different way than usual, but he sees the object of his confusion stop in the mixture of cross traffic.
Draco instantly stands, fighting the looks and gushing around him, and he pauses at the base of the small steps when he hears a single voice speak above the rest.
His lips part over the head of it, and in his mind he sees what he's doing in the darkness just like he had in the one dream. Gently he moves back and forth, taking a little more each time before withdrawing briefly for another lick and even a kiss to the side of the shaft still in his now slippery fingers.
Because it would be disastrous for himself and these stupid feelings inside of him to walk out of the room thinking Potter was
When Malfoy suddenly changes direction far ahead, breaking off from the small group he'd been walking with and going elsewhere alone, Harry grunts in annoyance. If he follows now, people will notice what he's doing. After all, there's no reason for him to head towards the Slytherin dorms.
Potter laughs loudly, startling him. “Yeah. He was. I felt...I felt so bad for trying to help him, only for him to fucking
Of course, it's weird the next times he does see Potter around the school, but Draco simply sneers or pretends to ignore Potter and watches the redness fluster across the back of the Gryffindor's neck either way.
One magnificent eye roll has Potter rolling his, too. Draco waves his fingers at the idiot. “Potter, there are women that throw themselves at you simply for your name. And there are women who will do so because you're you. No reason to worry, so just...just get that stupid courage of yours back and talk to her already.”
Draco waits with a cocked brow, taking another sip. “So, what is it? What's got you so caught up in your head that you can't pretend like me, for instance, that you want to still be here and dance and partake in wedded mirth with the couple?”
Harry knows the wall that Malfoy vanishes into is barely open long enough to even let the Slytherin inside. He can't just show up
“Draco! You look lovely, dear” Mrs. Weasley said as she squeezed his cheek like he was one of his godsons.
“I don’t have a chimney in here, but I could open the one in my workshop or give you access to apparate. And I would rather do this tomorrow, if you don’t mind”
“I saw him on the main floor. He did not look fine. I think he is ill, you need to go find him” she explained “Please, do not tell anyone I told you” he nodded again and she ran away in the opposite direction.
He straightened a bit in the bed, facing the man who, seeing his expression, stopped the movie and shifted to look at him directly.
He continued trying on doors and corridors with little luck. A first year girl that was stepping out of the kitchen asked him if he needed any help but he didn’t answer. Did he? No, he didn’t.
“Fuck this” he drew his wand out and pointed it at Draco’s neck, breaking his connection with Alexei. His boyfriend stopped shaking as the ink mark disappeared, but passed out immediately. Harry positioned him on his lap and then pointed his wand at the few peasants that had stopped to watch them “
“You are evil, Harry Potter. You have a dark soul and you keep making the world believe you are a hero”
“Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter” Harry offered, even if it was not necessary. He liked fallowing protocol sometimes. Made him feel like a normal person.
Once they were all closed, and the potions had made their work stopping the bleeding, Harry focused on the chills and the fever. Draco was sweating non-stop and his body was shaking. Harry had taken measures for the infection and temperature, but it would take a while.
“Oh, come on, you are a healer, dude. You need to think of some weird condition that persuades her. Please, I’m your best friend” he was just half joking. Hermione had really started labor in the middle of an investigation.
“He is Voldemort” Draco’s eyes opened impossibly and Harry had to control himself not to laugh. Luckily, the blond composed soon enough, realization spreading over his features.
“Smells good. What are you making for us?” she left a bag of cookies over the table before kissing his cheek; she always brought cookies and he loved them.
“Yes, we did. Well, Harry did. He talked to him about Rasputin and his relationship with his family. He did not know he was a wizard, but I guess that was his intention” Draco went to look at Harry but found out he was no longer in the room.
A completely absurd prophecy, if you asked Harry. He had cracked most of the meaning while he talked to Death. He was the one it loved the most, he was supposed to have helped Draco and Alexei and he had been there, chatting with a psychopath…and Death. But he would deal with his insecurities later.
“I thought you said you were not an irrational being” Harry was angry and disgusted and he was insulting Death itself. He had finally lost his mind.
“Why would Harry have a room full of…” she stopped, midsentence, her gaze fixed in one place. Draco fallowed it and found his father, dead. She screamed and when he looked at her, startled, she was pointing her wand toward a different place, where Draco’s own body was laying, also dead “
Harry had been too fired up to reason at that time, but he had been certain of something: he hated the thought of Draco Malfoy getting hurt. That was not going to happen, not on his watch. He had tried for some time to convince himself that the reason he felt so protective over the man was that he was his patient, but that was bullshit. He had always been attracted to him, even if he hated himself for it, and now, that he had met this new Draco he couldn’t help to go down with the ship.
“Shall we go into the main house then?” Draco asked and when they all agreed Narcissa led the way while talking to Herm about something.
“I have grown up, Potter, thank you very much” he said crossing his arms over his chest making the other laugh while finishing with his thigh, which he was working hard not to think about.
“Death is supposed to be simple. Life is the complicated one” he answered back and tried to dodge it.
“We’ll go over it when you have had some glucose in your system and I’m sure it’ll be fine. You have been right so far, haven’t you?” they finished and went down to the kitchen where between jokes and teasing they both left the bad thoughts behind.
The day passed with them on bed, Harry checking on him every hour and Draco trying to make some sense of his latest dream. He had not told anything to Harry yet, since the wizard didn’t need another reason to worry; he had enough on his plate already and it was all because of him.
“I have another question” he said instead, turning to look at Harry “Just an insignificant detail” the brunet nodded “Do you mind telling me why the fuck was Death protecting you?”
“Take that back, you monster!” Harry laughed “For your information, I have no problem with alcohol, it’s just too hot in here” he was lying, shamelessly, but Harry wouldn’t push. He went back to his sauce and to check the oven before entertaining himself cutting vegetables for the salad.
Harry knew Draco was having fun, he had been sentenced to bed time for months now and this was the first time he had the chance to explore and walk freely. Harry was just happy he could make his boyfriend smile that way. They had kissed and hugged and held hands as much as they had wanted to. A young girl had even told them they looked absolutely cute together, which had made Draco thank her with a smug smile.
“Hi, Kreacher, this is Draco Malfoy, Draco, this is Kreacher” the probably blind creature looked at him abruptly and held the necklace he had, a sort of locket with an S. It didn’t look like something a house elf would own.
“For fuck’s sake, Harry, take this damn thing off” Harry laughed softly and did as told doing the same with his trousers and Draco’s pajamas.
“Let’s take care of that leg” the thigh wound was the nastiest one. The others had healed just fine, the stitches had vanished by themselves, leaving a thin red line that will soon disappear too, but that one was giving him hell.
“So, let me see if I get this. A muggle soul, which could not, under normal circumstances, survive in our world, was forced by a dark wizard or witch to take over my body and, somehow, it passed its condition to me” Harry nodded “And we still have to verify this theory, but this could be the explanation why my core didn’t reject the intruder”
“Voldemort could decide what to do with me. He could control our connection at will, even when he had no idea it was because of his soul fragment. You had to be unconscious for it to take over your body and, as I told you then, it didn’t seem to me as if he was trying to possess you”
“This way, please” Ellias guided them through a sort of scan point where they checked their identities and then started to move towards the stairs “I have arranged for you a reunion with the head of Security Enforcement, she should be able to give you access to Koldovstoretz and then, if you are allowed to go, I will take you to a hotel until you leave to the school”
“Oh, I don’t know, Draco. Because he is your friend? Because he just wants to help? Because he is a sweet man that would not see you only as his patient? I was as shocked as you are, but you need to calm down. I tried hard, but he was honest and insistent about not taking it and I can’t do anything against that”
“Do you know Russian?” he was going to answer but shut his mouth “I thought so. Well you said something in Russian, you said you were not Draco, or at least I think you did”
makes more sense than anything else ever has in his considerations of the pair through all these broken tourneys over the terms at Hogwarts.
Draco holds his breath, heart lurching bizarrely in his chest. He ignores everyone else around him, doesn't hear the soft discussions of curiosity, just zones in upon Potter's face as he watches Potter stare into his now empty cup.
“All I've ever heard from Granger is how barbaric muggle medicine can be, and considering how ridiculous muggles
When he spells himself clean, zips up, and exits the magical alcove, Draco shakes his head, smiling and briefly wondering if Potter will be using another random book in the library as an excuse to spy on him again today.
And each time Draco endures the Charms class he shares with Potter, feeling those green eyes squarely upon his back
Blaise casually raises a hand, hoping to throw Malfoy off as he grunts, “Oh, believe me, I don't want anything to
Draco nods, refusing to look at Potter in that instant. He knows if he does, it'll all be right there in his eyes for the Chosen One to read and interpret, and then all that change he fears will happen. He'd
Everyone grows quiet, even Crabbe and Goyle with their bickering over a small cake they'd sneaked out of the Great Hall, and Draco watches, body burning with nerves, as Potter's strong, handsome throat swallows down the tea.
Thus, he makes a decision he hopes will kick off the matches of the year—that he hopes will lead to a
There's a silence, a different one from before when they were just sitting without their souls bared to one another over the bottle of Firewhiskey. It's a nervous silence now, but a longing one all the same.
He smiles to himself and picks at his eggs, wondering why Potter's doing so, why Potter was also in the library last Thursday just as he'd expected him to be, standing between aisles with another irrelevant book and pretending to read each time Draco peeked through the rows at him.
He lets the silence go on for a handful of minutes, sipping a little more from the Firewhiskey, before he finally, with
Blaise marks the tally as Draco's grey eyes follow Potter's arse away, teeth over his lip, and he settles into his spot on the ground more, counting points.
Harry's been lost since he'd seen that brief glimpse of Draco's flushed, gorgeous face in the light of his wand. Hell, he was likely gone to it all the second the wall had shut them in with the magic.
Near one-thirty in the morning, Malfoy's little feet begin to move in the dorms on the Map. Harry quickly spells it shut and tucks it away under the cloak, holding his breath with anticipation.
Even he follows Draco a bit after Charms, laughing to himself when Malfoy veers straight for the library and not the alcove, and Potter stares after his friend, completely confused.
Draco smirks, a hand smoothing his black suit leg. “Because I've known you forever, and I'm your friend, Potter. I know you more than most do.”
“Yes, well, perhaps Lucius Malfoy was kept out of its secrecy in case he tried to dominate the shared space,” Blaise explains, knowing damn well that's what his own uncle has told him.
The thing he's been waiting for finally shows itself one night when he cannot sleep yet again and is staring at the Map in bed with his curtains drawn tight.
“Harry,” Draco whines, holding Harry's head closer instinctively as he teases his thumb about the head of Harry's cock.
Potter's apparently been avoiding his friends on the topic if his red face and blubbering excuses are anything when Draco sees the pair of Gryffindors practically tackle Potter away from him once or twice.
Harry rubs his nose to Draco's cheek and kisses his mouth firmly, stealing Draco's breath. “I imagined you were up to no good, and then I figured you were doing something to stay calm and level. Nothing bad at all.”
unable to look away and covering it up with arguments. You're both honestly pathetic, regardless of rivalry or
His change of plan seems to be working. Blaise smirks to himself when he continues to sit in front of Draco in the Great Hall, feeling the heat of Potter's annoyed eyes upon his back and Draco's own glare at his face simultaneously entertaining the shit out of him.
“Cheer up, mate. He's staring again. You know, I never noticed how much he does it. Always thought it was
Draco Malfoy sits trapped alongside a mixture of other third years in a hot room at the top of a tower, all with a professor who strikes him as a woman several galleons short of a proper Gringotts account.
Harry briefly checks his watch, waits for the ticking arms to cross at two-thirty in the afternoon, and when they do he looks quickly to the magicked Map upon his lap, green eyes roaming for that name that's haunted his sleep so heavily for months, if not secretly for years before that.
Even if he waits for Malfoy to reappear, he hears a crowd coming up from the dorms' way for class change, and they
Harry's getting exhausted from waking to run to the bathroom and deal with the results of such dreams, shocked the first time he touches himself and whispers Malfoy's name, lost to the sensations that arise from the combination and have him coming and hissing through his clenched teeth.
“I can’t assure you I will heal you, but I’ll give my best, if you want me to” who was this man and what had he done with Potter? For the first time since he woke up Draco stopped to detail the person in front of him.
“I know this will sound weird, but I was thinking about babies” he blurted out. Harry looked momentarily confused but then chuckled.
He got up the bed slowly, knowing that, otherwise, he would fall right into the parquet, and made his way to the bathroom. Maybe because he didn’t look at the mirror, or perhaps because he was still feeling dizzy, Draco missed the hand shaped bruising in his shoulder until he came out of the shower. He didn’t have that in the morning, for sure, and it was a really strange place to have that mark. Touching it was not a good idea, as he discovered after hissing in pain when his fingers moved over it; he ran his eyes through his reflection looking for another new alteration in his skin, but that was the only one. The black circles under his eyes were not different than usual, maybe a bit darker, but nothing he wasn’t used to, after all, he had more bad nights than good ones; or it could possibly be the contrast against his face, paler, even for him.
He reached the bottom and continued to walk through the narrowest passage he had ever seen. The RUMMA one had been massive compared to that, but he had to keep going forward. The answers were there, in the library.
“Fine” Draco’s voice came up harsher than intended but Harry didn’t look his way. He hadn’t for a second “I’ll go on my own, you don’t have to worry about getting in trouble. No need to save me this time” he turned around and started walking.
When they landed, and the blond managed to recover from the nauseous feeling due to the lack of recent practice, Draco noticed they were in a sort of hall, simply decorated, but with a powerful aura. He felt somehow welcomed and he attributed it to the Black part of his blood.
He would never have to come alone to that field again. He finally had a special someone to share his life with and he couldn’t be happier.
“Of course, my prince” he stood up and Draco rolled over to his side of the bed hugging his pillow. Harry bit his lip and made his way to the kitchen after taking a shirt from the wardrobe. They looked like a lifetime couple and for some reason he loved that.
The squawk alerted Harry, but he wasn’t expecting the size of the damn bird when he turned to where Draco was looking at.
“Mr. Potter should tell Bibly his favorite dessert, sir. That way Master Draco can choose it for you next time” they both blushed. That elf was too straight forward.
Harry slid a hand under Draco’s left thigh, lifting it into the air and guiding it until his foot was resting on the warm skin of his shoulder. Then, Draco fell back moaning when Harry’s tongue touched his entrance for the first time, feeling like fire had just kissed the sensitive skin. He tried to hold onto reality by grasping the sheets with his fist.
“Oh yes, I’m so excited. I just can’t wait for the lot of them to go to Hogwarts, it would be like us all over again” she looked so excited that it was contagious. He was a bit jealous though. All his friends were already having families and kids and while he had Teddy, it was not the same. He had always pictured himself with a bunch of little terrors, a big happy family, and there he was, lonely and seeing everyone move on with their lives. “Don’t worry, Harry. You’ll get there, I’m sure there is some devilishly handsome man out there, who we all will approve and consider good enough for our best friend, it’s just not that simple” she said holding his hand, probably sensing his sadness. He had to laugh at the mental image.
They walked behind Ellias and as soon as they turned the corner they encountered a street full of people, very different from the one they came from. Harry couldn’t get a word of what they were saying, but none of them seemed to be paying particular attention to the three wizards. They continued walking for a couple minutes until they reached a public bathroom.
“I’m sorry. I will sleep today if this goes well” Draco, already sited, looked up to the dark-haired man with concern “It cannot go wrong in a harmful way, but I couldn’t say it went well if it doesn’t work, right?” he explained comfortingly and Draco nodded “You may want to take the shirt off. This will stain” he added with a bottle of enchanted ink and a thin brush in hand.
“It’s perfect” he praised, interrupting the girl, mid-sentence, when he tasted a sip “How did you know I don’t like sugar?”
“I don’t know. One of the elves called me and I found him in his workshop, it was a mess, he was bleeding, surrounded by wood, splinter everywhere in his body. He has not said a word. Harry, please, help him” the wizard nodded but didn’t move his eyes away from the task.
He got downstairs just in time to see the fireplace his mother had installed in his absence, flash, letting Granger, and her huge belly inside.
He was being kissed like he had never been kissed before, Harry’s hands where on his hip, keeping him as close as possible, like he was going anywhere. The soft contact of the cool metal of Harry’s frames against his cheek, the hungry lips devouring his, his tongue tasting Draco’s eagerly, as if he was trying to steal the flavor out of him, to never forget it.
“I could use a shower; do you think I can manage that without hurting myself?” he didn’t know how to deal with stitches or even if he could stand, but he was craving hot water and soap.
This is it dear readers, the happy ending. I hope you have enjoyed the story so far and I thank you all for your support. Happy Epilogue!!
“Yes” he answered simply. Death was still behind him. He had no clue why. It could not be afraid and if so, Harry thought of himself as a very little comfort.
“When I chant the spell” Harry dropped the brush and the bottle, after taking it form Draco, on the bedside table and drew his wand out “Ready?” Draco nodded
“I am the guardian of those secrets, Dmitri. I can do whatever I please with them, so yes, I did. In order to help his friend”
Harry soaked the brush and leaned in. Draco stretched his neck to grant the healer better access and comfort to draw. The black hair was tickling his nose, but he controlled the urge of scratching; instead, he focused on the musky smell that came from it. Harry was so close to him that Draco was having a really hard time not looking at his lips or eyes, or anything that he could lose himself in. He was not made of stone.
“Sorry we are late” she said. The tension was almost physical and not even her peculiar presence did much to change that.
They said their goodbyes and his mother walked him out of the room. It didn’t take Narcissa more than eight minutes to get back. Yes, he had been counting.
“I love it! Thank you, Harry” he looked like a little kid who had received exactly want he had asked for Christmas, and even when Harry imagined that his boyfriend had always got his every wish it still made him happy and he ended up smiling like an idiot when Draco kissed his cheek.
They walked the path the man had pointed. The tip of a cross could be seen over the trees and as soon as they passed the vegetation they found themselves face to face with a static bronze statue of a family. A man was in the middle, between a lady and a teenage girl, and on the back of the monument, a couple steps up, there were three other girls around different ages. It was beautiful. Harry had little information on the assassination of the royal family but he knew it had been awful and that was a beautiful place to be remembered, but both their attentions were locked in a single thing: the little boy cuddled in his father’s arms. He was so small, he was so real, so near. Alexei had a face for them now, a body, he was no longer an intrusive voice inside Draco. The poor boy had died too early and he had not even been able to rest with his family, trapped in some kind of spell that had kept him wandering for years, only to wake up in some foreign world all by his own.
“All right, I’ll get it ready for you. Wait here” Draco let him go reluctantly and he stood up. He drew his wand out and located a jar that he transfigured into a big enough bathtub. Then, he filled it with water and took it to the perfect temperature with some spells. He grabbed the muscular-relaxant salts he had in his medical bag and added some scented oils before feeling satisfied with his work. Once done, he helped Draco undress, carried him on his arms and deposited him inside the tub but, when he was going to turn around to leave him alone, his boyfriend grabbed his trousers.
A couple minutes later they were still in the bathroom’s floor, holding each other, as Draco recovered.
He had spoken in plural when he proposed the trip because at some point he had started to think of them as a team; he had the feeling he would not have the strength to go anywhere to solve this if he didn’t have Harry to lean on, to make him feel safe. But the asshole had decided that scare and worry him was a better approach. Good. He didn’t need Potter. It was his soul after all.
“We have concluded that it has something to do with a former student of this school. He was the only person Alexei identified as a wizard in his surroundings” Alexander’s eyes opened.
The bed sheets were barely wrinkled, as if the man hadn’t moved in his sleep, but judging by the tiredness in the wizard’s eyes, he had probably not slept at all; the desk was overflowed with books and discarded papers, and a box of cigarettes laid empty in the window frame.
Draco woke up before his boyfriend, who was still holding him. He had probably slept less than six hours on the last three days, he had to be exhausted, doctor or not. He made a little funny noise, and moved his nose where a strand of hair was tickling him. Draco smiled and stroked the hair out of his face, unfortunately, waking him up. He was about to apologize when Harry smiled, stretched and said in an impossibly sexy, husky voice “Hey, beautiful” and Draco melted again.
He tried again, thinking that nothing in the bathroom could hurt him. A water column rose and started moving, but Draco’s eyes caught a glimpse of the mirror and it dropped back into the tub. Wood had been awful, but glass…
“I did not, but if he was I know how to confirm it” the man looked around and got closer to Harry “I am trusting you with valuable information, my boy. This is one of the most guarded secrets of this school and that is saying something. You must promise me that you would never speak a word about it with anyone; not even Mr. Malfoy” Harry knew the old man was not referring to some empty oath; he was asking for something more secure and definitive.
“No” he answered when he found his voice. The room was dark, but Draco knew it was not nighttime yet “Can you open the curtains?” the hand never left his head, but the light came through the windows instantly. Draco looked beside him founding Harry’s eyes, stained with concern. They were still in the guestroom; apparently, he had fallen asleep while being healed. There was a chair next to the bed, so he guessed Harry had stayed by his side.
“When I started studding here, I was curious about many branches of magic. Dark Arts can be a fascinating subject if you use them correctly, but even in that world there are certain thing one must not tamper with” Harry knew a thing or two about that. He had fought a lunatic that had gone too deep and too far into the Dark Arts and lost his sanity and many lives on the way “I found out, in this same library, that there were subjects, currently forbidden in the school, that had once been part of the curriculum. One of them was Soul Magic” Harry had no plans of interrupting Alexander so he let him continue the story “I asked why to one of my professors and the answer was that some student had involved with taboo things and the school had decided to take the subject off the study plan to avoid temptations. Years later I learned that that student was no other than Grigori Rasputin, the infamous wizard that ruined the Russian royal family”
When the time to return was approaching they made their way back from a different direction, so they could see a couple more things before heading to the tavern where they should meet Ms. Kozlova. They were almost there when a particular construction, a white building with a lot of golden domes, grabbed their attention. It looked like another of many museums or memorials but it had something more solemn to it that the others were lacking. Harry asked an old man who told them that the place was called the Church on the Blood. He actually gave them a lot of information, glad to get a couple of strangers interested in his country’s history.
, a Russian demon that made its victims suffer the loss of hope and devoured them. It was way much smaller than the representation of the statue, but it still made him wonder why would someone put that in the entry of the ministry. Aside from that, the building was impressive: marble floors with different patterns, golden and ochre decorations everywhere, the ceiling had moving paintings of different passages of the Russian wizarding history and the main hall was crowned by a golden dome. There were carpets covering every set of stairs and the steps moved like the muggle mechanical stairs Harry had seen on the stations.
Something was trying to come out, desperately. Harry grabbed the stone around his neck again. It had never worked since that time at the woods but it gave him a bit of comfort, a bit of hope.
Ellias knocked and the door opened. A big, blond woman was behind a desk. Her hair was like Hermione’s and her office as tidied up as his friend’s. She stopped reading and looked at them.
“I’m not crying” he said wiping his cheeks and making the older man smile “I didn’t know your friend was sick, I’m sorry. I won’t complain anymore” he hugged his godfather and Harry stood up, carrying the boy.
“Didn’t have you for a kid’s person, Malfoy” he joked. But Draco was not joking and he apparently felt it since he stopped smiling “Are you serious?” he paled “Are you pregnant?”
“Relax, Draco, it doesn’t hurt. I will try to reach for your soul in a much more innocuous way than Dementors do. It may feel a little invasive, somehow like mind reading, but it’s not painful, I promise” Draco nodded but he didn’t look any less concerned “I will stop if you ask me to” Malfoy fixed his eyes in Harry’s and his shoulders relaxed with a sigh.
“A deceitful man; a wizard, like you. He wanted me to return his soul back from my domain once he died, and, in exchange, he would gift me with five pure ones” it made a pause “Your kind seems to have a dangerous taste for immortality” Harry knew it meant Voldemort.
The man took out a small knife and made an extremely dramatic and deep cut on his palm, letting a couple drops fall on the rug and finally made his way towards the entry.
He kept his eyes locked on the veil. It’s not like he believed Death, but he wanted to. If Rasputin had come back after so many year, his boyfriend should be able to come home to him. He had no idea what kind of test was he facing, what kind of trial he had to surpass, but he hoped he would choose him.
“That sound” he checked his pockets but he hadn’t even brought his cellphone with him and it was not that kind of buzzing. He could recognize that sound anywhere, even with his current fatigue “Is that a snitch?”
Draco noticed he had left a couple books and a bunch of handwritten papers from last night behind and he took the liberty to go over them. His name was all over the parchments with various schemes and question marks. The name Alexei was there too, butt had way less information around than his. The books they had been reading were all related to dark magic and forced possession, and for the first time Draco was feeling fear; what if they could not find a solution? Harry was not going to be around all the time, he would have to live with that and he didn’t want to.
He managed to get there without being caught and locked the door behind him; he also added some silencing spells as soon as he deposited Draco on the bed. He ran to look for his medical bag and started to treat Draco.
He made a couple diagnostic spells and decided he could give Draco the medicine without danger since he was apparently stable. His vitals were fine; the damage was not physical. He would check his soul when he recovered a little, but for now he tended to him as he had done at the beginning.
Every wall in that house had a painting, but most were empty, just the canvas with a nice landscape, or a chair, or something like that, only a couple were still present and moving. There were also empty spots, places where most definitely a frame had been once. Draco could imagine the reason. The portraits of his ancestors were probably not really polite with the new owner of the house; the image of his aunt yelling at Potter every time he went to get a glass of water was actually very disturbing, so she was, no doubt, one of the missing frames.
“That’s a bit harsh. We are just going to investigate, find a way to help Alexei, so I can finally get my soul back. It’s not that dangerous” Harry’s sardonic laugh made him tense.
“No. This is a terrible idea, the worst one we have had so far, but we have to do it” he answered while struggling with his tie. He had never had problems knotting it but he was very nervous.
He reached the field and sat on a rock to relax. His knee hurt and while it was bearable, he knew he needed to rest a moment before heading back. He took a flower between his palms and rub them together, the smell of it intensifying. He picked up a bunch of them and tied them after transfiguring a leaf into a green ribbon.
“I know. Take your time to think over it, I’ve had mine. I’ll be in your guest’s room until is time for your treatment. Let me know if you need anything” Harry stood up and grabbing his stuff, made his way out of Draco’s bedroom.
Ten minutes had passed when Alexei seemed to calm himself enough. Harry stood up and handed him a glass of water from his desk that had been definitely empty, but the boy was not looking, so he filled it up magically.
“Only if he chooses to” Death must have seen the confusion on his face because it elaborated the last statement “These veils exist to connect the two worlds, Harry. They make my job easier, but they can’t kill anyone, not on their own”
“Of course. Those kids had no future back then. Russia would have made a joke out of them after killing their parents. They were born with a bright destiny but they lost it during the war. I can see the future and I knew they were going to be humiliated, they were going to be miserable orphans. I changed that. They went to the other side with their parents, as victims, as martyrs” Harry controlled the retch that overwhelmed him. That man was completely convinced that he had done nothing wrong.
“So?” that man was an imbecile. That was for granted. Draco’s chest was still moving and that, along with Alexander’s presence, seemed to have calmed Harry enough so he could think properly.
He lost control of his limbs for the next minute, his body completely loose. As much as he wanted to touch his boyfriend he only managed to return Harry’s kisses, tasting himself in the other’s mouth.
“What happened?” he asked to the witch while running the diagnostic spells and getting the basic potions from his bag.
By the time he left his workshop it was almost four in the afternoon, he still had another hour to meet his mother, so he decided to take a stroll around the house. Draco’s chalet was one of six in the area. It was located in the outsides of the city, in a small open field, where the six houses were distributed, far enough from one another and all of them belonging to magical families. Draco was the only single man in the area and the only one living by his own. He had looked for a place to live for months, but nothing convinced him, until he found that one. The house itself wasn’t as spectacular, but if he walked down a near hill, he would find the most beautiful, wild lavender field. He loved that place and there’s where he was heading.
Four hours, eight coffees and twenty-three parchments later, he had two things: a crazy theory and a massive headache.
“Teasing you. I didn’t notice it mattered to you that much” he turned to look at Harry. He was almost sure he wasn’t crying yet, but he was about to.
“I already told you, mom. I was exhausted, I had been working non-stop for hours” he answered patiently while pouring some milk in his coffee, he wasn’t feeling like having it black that morning.
“I guess I am not feeling like it. I have no energy today” Harry was about to ask more about it when Alexei’s body shook and Draco hissed in pain.
Wait, was he being manipulated right now? Rasputin lowered his hands and clasped his cross. Harry started to drop his wand too.
“Shut up and come back here” he said, craving for Harry’s lips one more time. The brunet obliged and kissed him, his hands everywhere in Draco’s body. He moved his mouth to his jaw, his neck, his collarbone, his chest, entertaining himself for a while with one of his nipples, making Draco release the obscenest sounds. He continued lowering, scratching the blonde’s skin with his beard while his hand stayed back to torture his other button. Draco supported his body on his elbows and stared down at Harry, watching as his length disappeared between the brunet’s lips a couple times before he stopped to suck the sensitive gland, making Draco’s legs shake a bit; but Harry ditched the care of his member too soon and kept moving down, liking the skin under his testicles.
Draco had suggested to invite Harry’s cousin and his family, since they had been closer after Dudley’s daughter turned out to be a witch and he had gone to Harry for advice, but the brunet had convinced him that it would be uncomfortable enough without a bunch of muggles there.
“I won’t ask why, obviously, but I have to admit I’m surprised he reached for you, unless he had completely lost his mind”
He made his way to the cellar and picked a basket from the entrance, just like a supermarket. He went through the meat section and picked a juicy piece of beef before moving to take a bunch of mushrooms, eggs, potatoes and pastry. He got a couple bottles of red wine, spices and some more stuff before going back to the kitchen. He rolled up his sleeves and spread the ingredients. The cigarette was still in his mouth, almost fully consumed, so he vanished it and began to work.
“And this chair gets stuck everywhere” Lucius added. He had made quite a recovery. Harry had used some of his especial medicine and in just a month Lucius was back on his feet…well, so to speak. He could not make any effort, so he was on the chair most of the time. But he was alive, and that was more than enough for Draco “And your mother has to push it harder” he had been told many times that Draco was his son and he had just assumed it was true, but he didn’t remember having a son. He was still a little out of himself, but they had never expected that to get better.
“There’s nothing to thank for, I’m glad to help. See you soon, Draco” and with that he left the room. He heard distant voices coming from downstairs before it went silent and in no time his mother was opening the door.
“When Harry told me about this I remembered something I read once in one of the case reports from the curse-breaker’s files at the ministry. It clicked then, you are not cursed as Harry initially thought” Hermione intervened.
“Now, do you have any idea how to bake a carrot cake?” Harry laughed at the sight of the kitchen turned upside down, flour covered every surface, the carrots where grating themselves and falling out of the bowl and the vanilla bottle laid open in the counter, dripping to the floor, as George read a book of recipes that was clearly not very helpful.
“I don’t know, I’m sorry. I can’t tell you anything about yourself. Everything I know about you is that you are inside my patient. That’s how I found you. Can I ask you something?”
“Not here, Draco” had he made Regulus angry? He didn’t usually talk to him like that. He closed the door and was about to go down stair to his mother…
or tried, at least. It was, according to the other man, some kind of offline, whatever on the name of Morgana that was, database, which was a more comprehensible term for Draco, a portable, shrunken library. The single constant thought in his mind had been that, for a muggle thing, it had a very wizarding-like name. He could imagine himself waving his wand and saying
According to the book, he had studied in Koldovstoretz and formed on the way of dark magic, where he had apparently been one of the most talented scholars. He had dropped his studies before graduating and returned to his village for some personal matter, but he never stopped practicing the dark arts, creating a bunch off items and conjures that were seen as God-sent gifts to help the others. He was speculated to be the one that helped the tsarina conceive a male son to inherit the title and rule the country, but those were mere rumors.
“I spent the night thinking about what you told me yesterday and, even when I believe you, I found this situation most intriguing” Harry had described Draco’s condition to the man, he needed an ally and Alexander deserved an explanation after what he saw; but it had not been easy “How is it possible?”
“I will tell you, but please, if your conclusion is going to be along the line that I’m mental, save it”
“I don’t. But I feel like I should” the dark-haired wizard, who kept running his hand through his hair, sat by his side in the mattress “I had a nightmare. I think I know what Alexei meant by his family being…” he swallowed hard “If what I saw has something to do with the reality, I know why he felt so distressed. Harry it was horrible”
As soon as Draco awaked he would write to a German colleague who would, hopefully, be willing to help while they were in Russia. Harry would personally treat Lucius once they were back but he was not sure either of them could change the picture too much; anyway, he had to try.
“Of course. Come in. The Weasleys are already arriving” by the time Draco returned to the living room, Molly and Arthur were already there, the woman hugging the air out of his boyfriend while Andromeda tried to contain Teddy from fighting with Victoire.
“I hope it still does. Darkness is always around, and joy is most needed even in the brightest of days” he answered, as dispassionately as he could, before heading towards the victoriously smiling duo that was calling for him.
He had immediately given him a key, a small, golden key that, he claimed, was made by goblins and was the only way to enter a certain room.
They entered and the smell of toasted coffee beans embraced Harry like an old friend and the sudden touch he felt on his ankles made him crouch.
He wasn’t going to read Hermione’s but he opened his mother’s letter as quickly as he could and read the content anxiously.
Draco opened his eyes just to shut them again immediately. The room he was in was too bright, a conspicuous difference from that godforsaken chamber where he remembered being before everything went black.
The one on the right was too small; Harry wouldn’t fit there either, not even the big elf from the castle would fit there.
“Drarling! How are you?” Blaise was there, sharing a cup of coffee with Harry, who had stood up to help him walk without looking at him, for some reason.
He woke up screaming. When had he fallen sleep? What time was it? His throat was dry and his eyes were so clouded with tears that he couldn’t see a thing.
“I’m all right, mom and I need to finish a couple things today since I haven’t been working in almost a week” he adjusted a lock that had escaped the bun and went back to carve the hornbeam wand in his hands. He liked this wand, he was working with the materials provided by the client, which was uncommon, but the man had claimed that a phoenix had took him to that specific tree and left him a feather. Draco was no one to doubt the wizard so he took the wood and the core and started working, hopping he could make a very special wand for his client.
Harry's eyes round behind his glasses, and he stares, looking anywhere else in the nearby vicinity of the Maurader's Map, like he has each time before, wondering how Malfoy is doing it. The Map shows everyone on the grounds and in the castle, and it shows even those magicked or hidden by a cloak like his own. So how is it that Malfoy, two days a week at this time of day, just
“Because, Potter, not only would I be in the way, but it would change everything,” Draco despondently replies, wanting to curl in upon himself. “Because I'm selfish, but I won't be
“Have something to insinuate, do you, Zabini?” Draco questions, hoping to throw his friend off while Trelawney finishes setting up some display with everything she's gathered despite continuously babbling to the Hufflepuff.
Potter blinks, as if shaken out of his thoughts, and gazes over at him. “Huh? No. It's not about Ginny or Dean at all. I'm happy for them.”
For a moment his entire face reddens; he can feel every bit of his skin flush, can feel his mouth open in shock and his eyes widen in panic that the very deep, worrisome thoughts he's been having manifest into his dreams lately about Potter have somehow made themselves known.
The soft moans drive him wild, the little thrusts in the tight space into his fingers give him courage, and Harry nearly collapses when he feels insistent hands yanking him closer to find his zipper, to bring him out into the open and palm him, too.
Blaise rubs his lips together as he thinks quickly, turning to see Malfoy uncomfortably sitting on the edge of his bed staring at him. “We just need to reschedule,” he replies, thinking that might work.
Draco nods as he tips his glass back, finishing the last sampling of wine he wanted to try. The party breaks up for dancing, and grey eyes cleverly follow the dark head as it weaves through, only stopping to briefly twirl Molly Weasley about for a moment before it heads outside onto the balcony.
Armed with the Map in his pocket, Harry decides to try something different this time. Instead of following him to the library in hopes that Malfoy will give some sort of clue up then, he's going to follow him right after their class.
“You know, that might actually work on your other friends, but it doesn't me,” Draco begins, and Potter's head swivels to stare at him in surprise. He nods, using the bottle as an accentuating physical object for his point as he tips it Harry's way. “You've come out here, Potter, because you've a thought in your Gryffindor brain that won't leave you be. When you genuinely are bothered by something, you often hide it. You mull over it like this, alone, so you can be stuck in it with no one nagging you or mothering you to death.”
