“How so?” Lupin glances up at her, as though he doesn’t know, as though it hasn’t been splashed over every newspaper in the UK.
That was that. Every lesson, the professor would slip Harry some work, and he’d pass it on to Hermione, who stood outside Malfoy’s door for at least 20 minutes every day before being allowed in. Surprisingly, she wasn’t irritated at him for lying to her; in fact, she seemed incredibly pleased that he was helping Malfoy. Unsurprisingly, Ron didn’t share her views.
“Draco, I don’t know how to tell you this nicely.” Black pauses, hand coming up to gently stroke his hair. A sense of dread creeps up on Draco, winding around his heart and lungs.
“Mister Harry Potter, sir!” A small hand grips his wrist, and suddenly he’s in a bedroom, the raging emotions gone as quickly as they had arrived. He blinks, staring down at the watery-eyed house elf.
For me, it'd definitely have to be 'Halo' by Zizou Corder. This book has been my favourite for years, and a huge inspiration towards my love of the Ancient Greeks and Romans. It may not be that impressive as I get older, but the way it manages to combine so many of my favourite ideas in books will always make it special in my eyes.
He shakes his head, then curses himself. He shouldn’t be responding to the man. If he is under a hallucination curse, he would look insane right now, shaking his head at nothing.
“Gobsy would liked to have had young master Draco well again. Gobsy thinks it is too quiet here.” The house elf lowers his voice. “Gobsy thinks mistress is ill, too. Gobsy knows mistress can’t go away, but Gobsy thinks he would like to take her anyway. Too much death. But mistress will stay for young master Draco, and so Gobsy will too.”
“Your son painted you.” Pansy pats a hand on Draco’s shoulder, breaking the awkward silence that had followed his question. “We’ve just found out he can do that.”
The argument from that lasts less than three hours. He sends a note after Harry, apologising and begging forgiveness. He doesn’t deserve it, but Harry returns with teary eyes and tight hugs, and they’re back to the hesitant relationship they’ve been cultivating. Not that everything is suddenly perfect. Harry’s magic sputters and spits while Draco’s explodes, and he’s not oblivious to the resentment in Harry’s eyes whenever he casts a spell. Hermione jokes that it’s Harry’s punishment for doing that stupid spell which started this mess. Draco thinks Harry secretly believes her.
Parkinson snorts. “Yeah, right. I know what Potter’s been doing. I know he wants Draco all to himself, cause he’s a spoiled brat! Don’t try to argue with me, Granger, I’ve figured it all out. He’s in love with Draco, so like the possessive prick he is, he’s separated him slowly from his friends so we won’t get suspicious, then locked him away and cast Imperius. Why else would Draco invite him in and not me?!”
His real father is dead. He’ll never know all those flaws Draco kept hidden. This painting is only a copy, and what’s the point of spending so long perfecting it if Draco still only hides and buries himself beneath layers of doubt? If this is not the time to show him his true self, when will it be?
No! Draco wants to scream. No, because you and the rest of my family didn’t ever give a shit about me! I was branded, used, abused, and then thrown aside because none of you ever cared! Even my own father couldn’t protect me, wouldn’t protect me! Why can’t you see that?!
Draco cringes, remembering countless conversations about his weak health. His father says it’s made Narcissa dote on him too much, but Draco knows it’s made his father think of him as a weakling, some puny skeleton that can be trampled easily.
McGonagall. Why would she do that? There's no way they're going to survive a whole year without killing each other now, even with that Michael person in the room. Perhaps the stress of becoming Headmistress has finally made her snap.
Draco wakes up alone. Everything hurts, despite the soft wrappings, and Draco prays that Poppy will return to give him something to stop it. The potion to help him sleep, preferably. Nothing can hurt when he’s asleep.
Professor McGonagall, now Headmistress, stands and claps her hands sharply, signalling for silence. Once the chattering has petered out, she begins to speak.
He watches the red liquid drip to the floor in horror, the red haze draining away to leave a hollow fear.
“The ministry is calling me a trainee Mind Healer.” Luna says, brushing off her previous confusion. “I don’t know why they aren’t calling me a therapist, but it’s either change the name entirely or stick ‘magical’ in front of it. I’ll take Mind Healer over that.”
“You did kill him using expelliarmus. Like, not even some awesome powerful spell. You chose expelliarmus.”
Once more, their eyes lock. This time, Malfoy refuses to shy away, but there's no responding flare of challenge. He arches an aristocratic eyebrow, posture unusually slouched, and sighs as though this silent battle is the most exhausting one he's ever been in. Harry stares him down, determined for an unknown reason to win this. Malfoy rolls his eyes, and looks away.
I would be a Fwooper, although I wouldn't like to be kept as a pet with a silencing charm over me. What's the point of having a twitter that makes people insane if you can't use it?
Harry is a different matter. There’d been a long silence when he said he didn’t understand how he did that, how he didn’t think he had the guts. Harry had killed him. Accidentally, but… he had died because of Harry.
“Gobsy didn’t think where else to go, sir.” The house elf mumbles. “Mister Harry Potter should not be in young master Draco’s bedroom. Mister Potter should follow Gobsy now, sir, yes he should.”
Theodore had been on trial before Draco, charged with a number of crimes. During the war he had fought on Vo- on the Dark Lord’s side, fought, not hid in Hogwarts like most. His father had brought him to the forefront, just like Draco’s had, wanting the power and money. It seems Theodore has paid a similar price.
Draco trails behind the rest of them, his house separate from the main huddle. While McGonagall had noticed his unusual attire, she had apparently decided against calling him out on it, for which Draco was especially thankful. He doesn’t think he could have handled the sudden attention.
I wish you could have focused more on your own family, Draco thinks. I wish you could have seen what was happening, seen what would have happened to me, and tried to stop it instead of worrying about a boy who has everything he ever needed. Potter is fine without you.
They all hold their breath, crammed together around the painting, Draco nervously biting his nails. Pansy had told him to stop it, since it was a ‘disgusting habit’, but after the fifteenth time she’d given up. Besides, the waiting put everyone on edge.
In that moment, he hates Malfoy more than words can describe. This disgusting boy had made every interaction hell, had fought on Voldemort’s side, and now to make it all ten times worse, he is making Harry feel pity for him.
So I've seen some writers do this thing where they can put the name of another work in their notes, and you can click on it and it will send you through to that work. This would be incredibly helpful in my recommendations, so if anyone knows how it's done, please tell me! Thanks!
Pansy watches them leave, giggling together, and shakes her head. She’d never thought Luna and Ginny… but something must have happened. Luna isn’t easy to get to know.
Be warned: most of you will not be happy with this. What happens in this is not permanent, however! Please don't murder me for it!
“It was two days ago, in the morning.” He begins, heart in his throat. “The night before, I had… I cast a spell on Draco. I wanted to make him feel better, so I cast a spell to grant a wish of his. He wished for his D- Dark Mark to be gone, but something must have gone wrong because he-.... Narcissa, I didn’t mean for it to happen, I… He c-c-carved it out, and he died. I’m sorry. Merlin, I’m so sorry.”
But… this isn’t Draco’s choice to make. Much as he would like to rely on Harry to levitate a blanket to him when his wandless magic is too volatile, he can’t stop Harry from doing this. He’s clearly thought about it, otherwise he wouldn’t look so nervous and still bring it up. This is Harry’s choice.
Christmas comes and goes, presents overflowing from their two beds, and soon Poppy declares them suitably fit to leave. Sirius is practically howling at the walls by this point, setting pranks and pacing the ward like there’s no tomorrow. Draco is less eager, especially when this means the press is certain to get news of his reincarnation. Piles of howlers, here he comes!
He remembers the silken feel of the black fabric, cold and warm all at once, his seven-year-old back pressing into a bony leg. The cloak, his vampire cloak, shuts out all the screaming and whispers. He’s safe in the cloak. Sev’s hand, long fingers just like his one day, ruffles his hair. And then, as he peeks up to catch a glimpse of his face, the whole scene fades away, and he’s left alone, listening to Potter’s voice outside.
“Harry.” The voice is deep, warm, familiar in a way he can’t quite recognise. “Harry, breathe with me. In… Out… In… Out…”
“We just don’t fit, that’s all.” Nott folds his arms. “He has some deluded idea that he’s responsible for everything that happened in the war, and I don’t agree, so we broke up. That’s it. Go and tell the whole world if you want, Potter. But you won’t.” He leans closer, voice lowering to a whisper, eyes alive with a sort of self-destructive malice. “Because I know you like him, and wouldn’t it be funny telling everyone their Saviour’s in love with a Death Eater? A boy Death Eater, at that. I’m sure the whole world would be so... accepting!”
In a last ditch effort, he turns around and wraps his arms around Black’s torso, clinging to him for all he’s worth.
He nods slowly. Maybe he was overthinking this. Harry doesn’t have the capacity to be as subtle as this in rejecting him, and that saving-people-thing is too deeply ingrained into him to humiliate Draco in front of all of these people. He’ll wait until later, reject Draco in private.
“Of course.” He bites out immediately, standing and fumbling with his wand. “I’ll- I’ll just be leaving now. I’m sorry, Narcissa.”
“Well that Parkinson girl isn’t doing a very good job! I say one thing, and she attacks me like a pissed-off cat!” Ron retorts, still sulking.
Luna pulls her wand from behind her ear and starts fiddling with it. Draco had never told her he could make paintings real. It’s a skill most wizards and witches struggle their whole lives to do. Only a rare few are born with the natural potential, and even fewer of those can paint well. It’s why moving paintings are such an expensive, rare thing. Most people use photographs these days.
His chest tightens, nerves firing up. Pansy whips around to rip into the perpetrator, only to find they've slipped back into the crowd. Thank Merlin. The blame for any trouble caused would land directly on their heads alone right now.
“Right.” Harry bites his lip, finger tapping rapidly against his leg. Nerves. Blaise supposes even the Saviour of the Wizarding World gets nervous. At least Blaise is keeping up a calm front, chin tilted up and waves of arrogance flowing from him. Arrogance gets the job done. Nerves don’t.
Potter makes a little fist and punches it in excitement. “Thanks!” He almost seems a little too happy, Draco thinks, too full of energy and too annoying even for Potter.
“Well, since Jaebo be alive, sir, Master Draco must be a moving painter maker!” Jaebo smiles, throwing his tiny arms in the air and doing a little jig. “Jaebo be Master Draco’s first moving painting! Jaebo feels so happy!”
“Headmistress…” He starts, then pauses, his prepared speech flying out of the window. “Uhm… I would give you a long, well-thought-out speech, but I’m not too good at those, so…” Not too good at remembering them, either. “I’ll just ask you straight up.” Ouch, ok, neither is he good at improvising. Might as well come out with it before he messes up again. “Would you let me drop from lessons and train to be the next groundskeeper with Hagrid?”
“I hope you are all aware of how utterly atrocious this is. The war is over. I’m not asking you to forget those you lost, only that you do not ever think it is alright to attack another innocent person who almost certainly had nothing to do with their deaths. Revenge is never the best path.”
Luna darts over to the two of them, sweeping her wand in a circle and muttering words. A large blue bubble surrounds the two of them, rippling when they move.
Harry nods wordlessly, trying to remember where he’d seen that outfit before. Green silk, silver sash. Stitches careful but a little too large, done by someone inexperienced.
Draco reaches out a shaking hand, doubts suddenly invading his mind. What if it didn’t accept him? What if this was some sort of prank? What if it had broken sometime during the war? What if it did work, and then he realised he didn’t deserve it? What if the wand remembered all those lives Draco’s responsible for taking, and sets itself on fire?
Draco feels a panicked clenching in his stomach as he tries again. This doesn’t make sense. A lucid dream usually lets him do what he wants, even if he’s being followed by Vold- the Dark Lord. Magic is always there, just like it is in life, because a world without magic is unimaginable. Black is getting closer now, wariness tensing his muscles, so Draco opens his mouth. If the dream won’t let him use magic, it could at least let him speak.
“Sorry.” Lupin sighs, sinking into an armchair. “I would have made it myself, but they just kept insisting…”
“Anyway, I’m getting morbid.” She snorts. “Vold- Voldemort was just a guy who happened to be both twisted and powerful. It probably doesn’t mean anything. Uhm, while we’re on the subject…”
Pansy has slowed her pace to let him catch up, but quickly realises he’s hanging behind deliberately. After so long alone, having her constantly around him is… uncomfortable, to say the least. Not that he doesn’t love her anymore. She’ll always be the only one who gave everything she could for him.
He has to know. He can’t survive in a relationship where his partner doesn’t care about the past. It eats him up everyday, the guilt gnawing at his stomach, so he can’t stand by someone who doesn’t care about any of it. He needs someone with the moral compass to make sure he sticks to doing things right, without any exceptions, like ‘it was to save your own family’.
“Mister Harry Potter, sir, you should never go in that room, sir!” He squeaks, letting go of Harry’s wrist and shaking his head furiously, making his ears flap against his head. “Bad place, sir, no good for your head, sir. No one but the master allowed in there. Mister Harry Potter, sir, should never go in there.”
She couldn’t help herself. She can suffer through everything they do with a smile, but she will be damned if she’s going to keep her mouth shut. They murdered her husband, and let hate spread so far her son was killed in the mess. Slipping in a few bitter remarks is all she can do about it.
‘The Votum spell, or the fairy godmother spell, is used to grant the wishes of the intended target.’
“Mister Potter for you, mistress.” The house elf bows low, nose brushing the stone floor, and then pops from sight.
“Learned habits, I suppose.” She shrugs. “And I’m not going to start making my friends freak out by saying his name. He may be dead, but his sickness still carries on tormenting a lot of people.”
After the battle? What on earth is he on about? Everyone knows the Malfoys hid in their Manor until the trials came. How is that anything important?
- If you wouldn't like to read this, read only up to the ~~~ at the end of Draco's section. I'll explain in the end notes what has happened in the other section.
A few more questions are passed around, mostly about the worrying dorms, and soon McGonagall holds her hands up.
Ron quickly stuffs the remains into his mouth, making Neville marvel at how it seems to disappear as fast as the leaves of a Chameleon Flysnap. With that sorted, they stand and make their way to the front of the hall.
Pansy scowls at her, folding her arms. “Oh, you can’t be serious. He cannot. That’s just not possible. He’s hexed me fifty times every month!”
Finally, there was the aftermath. The unbearable effort of getting out of bed every day, walking through memories in every room, venturing out so little his skin became practically translucent. By the time the owl arrived, he had resorted to staying in bed all day and night, in a haze of half-sleep, ignoring the trays of food left by his bedside. The burst of anger is a welcome change from the numb feeling that has consumed him.
“It can’t be!” Harry hisses, annoyance rising at Blaise’s apparent disregard for the fact that his magic just isn’t working anymore. “It can’t have just shrivelled up, that’s not how magic works!”
Draco doesn't understand. He hates Potter, hates him with every fibre of his being. He wants to see Potter punished, which is exactly what this spell does, so how does it fail him now? How can it work on innocent muggles, yet refuse to make the man who destroyed his world do more than wince?
“Zabini.” His father sticks his nose up, a familiar cold mask slipping on, and Draco could almost cry at the sight of it. “I hope you hired a decent painter to paint me. I would hate it if I looked imperfect.”
“Ron, don’t be ridiculous. Parkinson won’t hex you when she’s surrounded by us.” Hermione sighs, looking drained as she stows her wand up her sleeve. “Let’s ignore them for now, they haven’t done anything yet.”
“Anyway, the point is… I’m sorry about everything that’s happened. I’m sorry I was mean to you, even though you did deserve it back then, and I’m sorry you had to live with Voldemort, and-”
He still can’t quite convince himself he’s more than a murderer, but at least it’s improvement. When he feels like sinking into the pit in his stomach, he’s learnt to ask Poppy for another blanket, which she and Sirius have adopted as their private code for ‘please talk to me, I’m not feeling great’. Sometimes he hates it, wishes they would care less about him and let him stew in self-pity. But most of the time he’s grateful, listening to Sirius ramble on about motorcycles or his horrible family, or watching Jaebo pull faces and dance about.
“Oh, Remus, Narcissa might show up at your door, just a warning. It’ll be perfect! We’ll get one of Hermione’s therapists to cure Draco, and Narcissa will be fine away from the Manor-”
Quidditch. Late nights in the common room, playing dumb games. Mother reading to him by his bed. Father smiling at him for once. Pansy tearing into another girl for insulting him. Snape giving him a wink when he gets full marks.
“Alright, okay, I won’t go in there.” Harry frowns, looking about him. The room is clean, but the windows have a darkening charm on them, and candles are scattered everywhere. A book lies on the bedside table, along with an empty tray, and Harry wanders over to investigate. The smell hits him then, and he has to stop himself from bursting into tears.
"Come on. They're not worth it, Pans." Blaise murmurs to her, then raises his voice. "Fucking coward. Got a problem, they should say so to our faces!"
‘Then, once the meal is rejected, the spellcaster must taste the meal themselves. This will begin the spell, and they should waste no more time before asking the intended their wish. They must respond within thirty seconds.’
Harry stares at the word, Crucio, as it fizzles out above Malfoy’s head, dropping them into the darkness once more. He lifts his wand once more, muttering a Lumos, and gazes around at the calm after the storm. The room is a mess, pillows burst open and scattered on the floor. Corner really won’t be happy about this.
“Haven’t you heard?” Luna drifts over to her place by the fire, carrying one of Neville’s plants. “Theo and Draco broke up. I’ve been trying to get some sap from this plant to calm Theo, but he hasn’t been talking to me. Aryana says it’s because he was only friends with me for Draco’s sake.”
But he doesn’t write any of that, because why would he tell Potter? Instead, he spells out the first thing he can think of.
The ministry worker laughs uproariously, then stops hesitantly when he sees Harry’s face. “You serious?”
Tears sting his eyes, ripping him from the shocked calm. Draco opens his mouth, shame and humiliation filling him, but he can’t say anything. What could he possibly say to make the man let him fall? Oh. There is that.
The words give him an abrupt spike of determination, enough to make him open his mouth to try and choke out words. “I-” He starts, hope and excitement filling him at managing it, but then it comes crashing down as the air blocks up his throat.
“I’m not begging- Oh, Merlin, come on.” Harry huffs, marching out of the room with Blaise trailing behind him.
McGonagall lowers her quill, peering at him over her spectacles. “I see. Mr Nott, I hope you understand that the Ministry has put very strict rules over your-”
Remus’s grin falters. “He’s...alright. Andromeda is doing a good job. Says he’s changing his hair colour to match her clothes these days.”
“It’s lovely to see how many friends you have.” Draco’s mother says softly, carding her fingers through his hair. “It’s more than I could have hoped for. You’ve come a long way, darling.”
“I found a spell to give someone a wish and I asked Draco for his and he said that he wanted his Dark Mark gone and I cast the spell without anyone knowing about it and then I came in the next morning and the spell had worked but it killed him, Nott, it killed him. I’m sorry. I’m so sorry, I didn’t mean to do it.” He rushes out the words, voice strained and panic building again. He can’t look at Nott’s face, knowing the anger and disgust must be building on it.
Limbo? Harry’s been into Limbo. Where he saw Dumbledore and where he chose to go back. Sirius is there?
Then Pansy woops, and the room bursts into noise. Harry hugs him tightly from behind, muttering praises as cheers flood the room. Hermione looks to be discussing the finer points with Blaise, Neville holds his excitedly-waving plant in the air, and Jaebo is busy screeching his enthusiasm from a banner.
“Thank you, kind aurors.” She smiles at them politely, noting the way they glance at each other apprehensively. “I appreciate the time you took out of your busy schedule to escort me. I’m sure our community will be proud to hear you’ve been taking me from one place to another when these so-called ‘vigilantes’ are still at large.”
“Only around thirteen days, Miss Luna.” He pipes, now sitting on top of a T. “How old is miss? If you don’t minds me asking.”
Fear? Hermione is right - he really does need to see one of those mind healers. The words 'Malfoy' and 'fear' do not go together in any way, shape, or form. Well, perhaps as in someone being afraid of him. Never the other way round. It doesn't fit.
“Hey!” Harry punches Theo’s shoulder, who snickers. “I defeated Voldemort, you know. You can’t go around insulting the Saviour.” He doesn’t miss the way Theo flinches at the name, or the way his expression quickly schools itself into blankness.
The excitement dries up rapidly when they stop at the bottom of a spiral staircase. Harry starts leading him up, but pauses as he sees Draco’s face. “What is it?”
Time passes him by, without word or meaning. It could have been a day or only a few seconds before another knock comes at his door. Blaise? Or Pansy again?
“I’m sorry.” Harry mutters, watching Nott gripping the counter tightly, his back to Harry. “I didn’t know. Is that why you’re working here?”
“Bring me that book, please. The one with the spell you cast in it. And… I don’t hate you. You did what you did, and I’ve done what I’ve done, and if you can still think I’m decent after that, I can give you a chance too. Call me Theo. Just don’t cast stupid spells again.”
“What do you mean?” Pansy questions, a breath of air passing over his soaked skin as she turns to him.
“Hi, Harry!” Ginny sounds overly excited as she greets him, likely hoping he’ll change the subject rapidly. The three of them have a habit of spiralling into obscure topics, linking plants and creatures and Luna’s psychological research like there’s no tomorrow.
The reaction is gradual, spreading like a ripple in a darkened lake. Older students, those who lost friends or family, notice them first, hate spitting from their eyes as they pull away. The younger ones, aware of the sudden tense atmosphere, recognise them too. First years only look a little confused, until brothers or sisters whisper in their ear, eliciting gasps of fear. By the time the spectacle has spread enough, their group of four has a wide circle of space around them.
“Be careful, Harry Potter!” The man seems to get over his initial shock, pulling out his wand and readying it. “I doubt she’ll be so friendly now that her husband’s dead.”
Oh, this. The snake in the common room had told Sir Pedlington, who had translated it to Aryana Griffith, who had whispered it to Red Hawk, who mentioned it to Luna as he was chasing Light Breath. Luna likes Light Breath more than Red Hawk, but she would never tell him, or he would stop telling her what he hears. It’s interesting. Especially when he tells her what Grendel Rouge, an expert in love, sees.
“Quidditch. Holyhead Harpies.” Ginny recounts, small giggles slipping out. “I’m gonna play chaser when they’ve finished my training.”
“Sorry, guys, I’ll talk later.” He says to them, taking Draco’s hand and walking away. They each call a goodbye after him.
Draco collapses against Lupin’s chest, anger and disgust at himself overwhelming him. The building tears begin to streak down his face as he breaks, all at once, forgetting the werewolf holding him.
“Jaebo can’t leaves, miss.” The house elf shakes its head sadly. “Jaebo has to stay, or poster will be thrown away. Miss Pansy says so, she does. ‘If this house elf weren’t here, this poster would be terrible. I’d have to get rid of it’.” He mimics Pansy’s voice.
“This is the last day you’re wallowing in self-pity. Tomorrow, I’m gonna drag your ass out of there so we can eat ice cream and plan revenge on Nott, ok?”
“Better?” Nott asks, a streak of dirt across his cheek moving with his jaw. His eyes are concerned, even when he’s as stony-faced as ever, and somehow Harry doesn’t feel angry or cold towards him. Awkward and self-conscious, yes, but not hating.
Harry blows onto the steaming liquid, letting the silence settle a little. It sounds nice. He’s always hated being in the spotlight, being relied upon. At first, he missed the purpose and direction of fighting against Voldemort. He didn’t want to fade away quietly, with no real aim. Now he thinks he was wrong. It wasn’t the action he was missing; it was having something to work towards.
Harry sighs, turning away and trudging towards the lake. All he wants right now is to sleep, but he can’t bear the thought of walking inside his room. Too many reminders of draco lie around every part of the castle, even by the lake, but at least he won’t be disturbed there. In late december, not many students will be around outside to ogle him.
Thud. He lands on the floor, eyes blown wide up at the person hurrying so fast they didn’t see him. They’re male, and as he turns hastily, an apology written over his face, Draco sees the black hair and green eyes and those ridiculous glasses and knows he’s screwed.
He doesn’t want to die. He might be already dead, but he doesn’t want to go, not yet. He wants to wait here for his mother, however long that takes.
Harry rolls his eyes, standing. “Ok, I’ll see what I can do.” His hand goes into his pocket, fingers dancing over the singed letter inside.
“Shh...It’s alright, Draco…” His voice is soft, too soft and caring for the boy Draco has become, and the sobs only wrack his body harder. No one has been that gentle with him since… since… he doesn’t know. It’s all too much, all at once, and when his father eventually finds them, he’s relieved. Mask back on. Tears wiped away. A sharp look threatening the werewolf to never, ever, mention this to anyone.
Harry, heart pumping, rips out his wand from his pocket and throws a spell, any spell, at them. In the end, it doesn’t even come out as a spell, just a raw wave of magic that throws the four away from the one in the centre. They yelp, crunching against walls and skidding across floors as Harry rushes forward.
The room is silent, entranced by the pure energy in his voice. A soft white glow outlines his body, slips from his tongue, winds around the room and brightens every expression in there.
“Master Draco can paint more peoples like Jaebo!” Jaebo squeals from the table, waving his arms to catch Draco’s attention.
He waves his ticket lightly in the air, the material creased from the amount of times he twisted it, and gestures towards the train.
Harry makes a face, and Nott snorts with laughter, as though he and Harry have been bosom buddies all this time. For the moment, Harry lets it go. After what Nott has just done for him, he doesn’t think he has the right to start giving the boy the cold shoulder. Besides, Nott is working for Hagrid now, so he can’t be as bad as Harry had thought.
“Oh, sure.” Harry digs in his pocket and brings out a few galleons, handing them over. “I’ll put in more when I’ve got stuff from Gringotts.”
He stretches, shirt riding up. This time, Pansy’s tongue is pinned into place by her teeth. “Fine. I’ll do it. You keep an eye on everyone else, make sure none of them get too horny.”
Unfortunately, Draco hates the other professor on sight. He’s a sandy haired, disgustingly attractive, blue-eyed fool. It’s obvious in the way all the girls, and some of the boys, cheer when he flashes them a bleached-white grin. Making an annoyed hiss, Draco scowls at him. Doily. Yeah, that suits him. A man as unnecessary and frilly as him should have a name like Doily.
There’s a light, pulsing inside his father. Lucius pulls away, tear-streaked face filled with astonishment and a sudden peace, and gives Draco a last smile.
Perhaps he should do as she asks, though, for now. With a wave of his hand, the magic sinks into the two people and they fall to the ground.
Harry dumps his head on top of the page and groans. His eyes burn, his stomach growls, and some foggy part of him is getting convinced that he should just go and let Hermione do the work for him. A nice long sleep sounds perfect.
“Me, and Ginny. I’ll pay for us both.” He watches her scribble it down. “So what is this new charity, anyway?”
Draco’s baleful glares when Harry says something sensitive. His sneering face right in front of Harry’s, just begging to be punched. His snooty sniffs as he passes Harry in the corridor, muttering an insult. His huge grin when Harry gave him his wand. His confused eyes when Harry stood up at his trial. His laugh, more of a breath than anything, when Harry lost yet another game of Exploding Snap.
“It’s amazing, Harry.” Black closes the book, eyes wide. “Honestly, you could make a business selling books like this.”
This only makes him scowl more. "Too good to talk to me now, Malfoy? I expected at least some politeness after what I did, if not any thanks, but I guess not." He folds his arms and marches off towards a ginger head bobbing inside a crowd.
All fifteen of them gape at McGonagall, horror evident. Not being able to stay in Gryffindor tower? Worse, having to share a common room with Slytherins?! Harry exchanges astonished faces with Ron, whose ears are turning red, and glances involuntarily at the Slytherins.
Maybe it’s Malfoy’s lot. He had basically attacked him for no reason, and Slytherins aren’t the sort to turn the other cheek. A pit has grown in his stomach since that had happened. Every time he learns something more about Malfoy, from Luna or Hermione, he feels the guilt of what he did weighing him down. But Remus had said to stay away, so stay away he did, even when Malfoy fell asleep in Nott’s lap, and when Nott carried him up to bed. Harry wants to be the one doing that.
“Draco, love, Theodore needs people to go to. All the compartments are full, and those filthy Gryffindors are stalking the corridors like bloodhounds. You don’t mind, right?”
"Draco? Draco, darling, is that you?" The familiar whine of Pansy comes from the other side of the door. Pansy. He hadn't even considered that any of his old friends would come back, especially as most of them were cleared of everything. Letting out another sigh, he resigns himself to listening to her whine until they get to Hogwarts.
The front doors are already open when he reaches them, but no Narcissa greets him. He steps inside nervously, looking around the large entrance hall. Portraits look back, murmuring to each other, a few with hideous scratches along them. Werewolf claws, by the looks of it. Greybeard.
I've just wrote this, and I'm updating early so that I don't have to read through it again. This one's tough. It's probably harder to write than it is to read, but... if you've got invested in these characters... be warned. We've hit the climax.
Theodore sniggers, trying to make light of the situation, but that’s not how Gryffindors work. The tip of a wand is instantly poked into his face by Neville. “Don’t be so cruel! You may have bullied us before, but in case you haven’t noticed, you aren’t exactly the top dogs right now.”
“Sorry, headmistress.” Theodore huffs, reigning his anger back in and trapping it under a stony mask. “But what I’m trying to say is that they wouldn’t really care if I wasn’t going to lessons. They’d actually be happier if I was with Hagrid every hour of the day, because it’s far easier to keep track of me with him. Plus, I’d be staying in Hogwarts for the rest of my wizarding career, and so would have no ability to go out and do Death Eater things. Please, headmistress. At least talk to them.”
Oh, thanks Ron. Harry scowls. Ignore him when he needs you, then expect Harry to help when you need him. It’s basically the story of his life.
Should this be only these three doing all the work together, or should they set up a group of them to work together on this? And if you think the second, who should be in it?
Taking this as his cue, he turns back to the railing and puts a foot on it, preparing to resume the process. He only gets about halfway over before the other snaps back to reality and tugs him back, this time holding him still as Draco starts to struggle in earnest.
A knock comes from the doorway. Harry turns, smiling as he sees Draco standing there. His muggle jeans are a light shade of blue, the sweater over them a deep purple. His beanie from the beginning of the year is tucked over his hair, loose strands of pale blonde messy under it. Harry walks over, running his fingers through it to try and get it to stay down, which it does, unlike his messy mop. Draco does the same for him, although it’s unfortunately in vain.
Wiping any pained expression from his face, he pulls himself to his feet and unseals the door, dragging it open. His torso is instantly wrapped in Pansy’s arms, sending stabbing pains through his body at the pressure. Behind her, Blaise stands, arms folded and chin raised, looking as neat as ever. Of course he does. He hadn’t been through the war.
“There’s too many wrackspurts buzzing around the eighth years there.” She smoothly descends into the seat opposite Ginny, next to Ron.
“I’ll kill them. I will.” Theo’s face darkens, grabbing Draco’s hand and holding it tightly. “No one hurts you without feeling the consequences. They already took everything from us, why do they need to hurt us too?!” He drops the hand, standing and starting to pace furiously. “It was a stupid prank, smashing up their precious little house points, there’s no reason to fucking attack one of us! Those Gryffindors had it coming. They’ve been torturing us the second we got here, and the professors have done nothing! Why is it so wrong to take it into our hands?”
Draco’s dead. His mother, with her sallow cheeks and red-rimmed eyes, has to carry the consequences of Harry's stupidity. He can’t do this, can’t lay the burden of more death onto her already heavy shoulders.
“That’s fine. Thanks, Harry.” She smiles at him, tucking the money away into the donation box. “Hopefully some people will start listening if they hear you’ve donated.”
On the first, the press and parents were allowed into Hogwarts, for the official ceremony. Both seventh and eighth years received their graduation certificates, along with their final grades in each subject. The other students had already gone home for summer, leaving the castle and graduating students free to have their photos taken. This day was the worst of the three; not a second passed where any of the famous eighth years could catch a breath, too busy answering questions for the press or avoiding them like the plague.
Anything to not focus on the mound of hacked out flesh, a pale, scarred snake tattoo winding through a skull, the blood around it creeping steadily towards Harry.
Besides, Draco’s yawning absence is always there, a huge black hole, an uneasy gap that makes them all a little too snappy and a little less wary of boundaries. He can forgive them until Draco is safe and back with them.
There he is, the stupid green-eyed prick, the one whose kiss Draco can still feel on his forehead. An inexplicable joy fills him, burning brighter than he has ever felt before. He isn’t dead (he’s alive!) and he’s staring at the foolish handsome face that makes his heart soar and merlin, he loves him so so so much, and so maybe his future self will forgive him when he leaps forward and wraps his arms (his clear, smooth, unmarked arms) around the absolute dickhead and smashes his lips against his.
With every word, Draco feels his heart tighten. Forgiveness. How can he forgive him? His father had put him in impossible positions again and again, taught him hate and fear and prejudice from the moment he was born, spat at him and glared at him and cursed him until Draco did exactly as he was told. His father was the one who’d lead him down this path of destruction and pain and death. How can he forgive him?
“I am ashamed of who I was then, but I refuse to be ashamed of who I am today. I’m going to live the best life I can, and by the end of it, I hope to be remembered for every good thing I’ve done, not the bad. I’ll miss my days at Hogwarts, even after everything. I’ll treasure these memories, and in ten years time, I want to see all of you taking your learning here to heart. To everyone standing here today, I’m proud of all of you. No matter what you’ve done.”
Oh no! I'm sorry, I didn't realise deleting the chapter would delete all your comments... I still remember them, though, thank you.
Harry falls silent, the most important but most awkward question on the tip of his tongue. “What… what about Teddy?”
His fingers clutch the railings, knuckles whiter than his face, refusing to let go. Somewhere in his mind, a desperate little voice pushes out, begging not to die. He’s so scared. His heart is thudding in his chest, but he wants this! If he can’t be killed fighting, the story still needs a conclusion. He needs to die.
“Because, as I keep telling you, people with mental difficulties need friendly support. So I’m his friend. Which is really strange to say, but it’s the truth now. As McGonagall said, the war is over, and we need to focus on building positive relationships.” She says firmly.
“No, I know, it’s a big thing.” Harry turns fully to him, swallowing. “I’ll use magic if I absolutely have to, but I need to do this. I want to learn to help without just throwing magic at things. Please, Draco? I promise I won’t take it too far.”
“No, it was probably just your imagination, mate.” Ron bumps Blaise on the shoulder, relief slipping onto his face.
“Was that a please? From our Lord and Saviour, the One Spell Wonder, the Boy Who Lived Twice, Harry James Potter?” Blaise presses a hand to his chest in mock surprise as he stands. “Never thought I’d see the day when our beloved scarhead would beg me.”
A choked gasp, and nothing more. He tries, pushing all of his energy into it, battling against the sudden spikes of guilt and shame. Still nothing. Again. His throat rasps, burning the skin inside of it, blocking up and ripping open when he coughs. Nothing. Over and over again, there’s nothing.
“Oh, Harry, don’t let this become like sixth year…” Hermione sighs, forehead creasing in worry. She’s been doing that a lot lately.
(“I’m sorry.” His green eyes were wet, voice trembling. “I didn’t mean to. I thought you might- I thought it would help. I’m so sorry.”)
Again, any ideas you have for future chapters (or even ideas for one-shots, I'm thinking about writing more of those), please put them in the comments. Thank you!
“No.” Nott sighs, picking the kettle up as it clicks. “I’m tired of being angry at everything. I’m not going to keep on hating everyone and myself. I’ve already destroyed enough of my life doing that.” He pours out the tea into the cups and turns to set one in front of Harry, the other one cradled between his hands. He looks old, far older than a boy of eighteen should look. “If I can stay here, just living and working without having to be dragged into the world again, I think I can be happy. Or at least a little more at peace.”
He forces himself to calm down enough to not hex Malfoy when he raises his arms, or when he straightens up. See? No need for hexing. The ferret hasn’t got a wand in his hand anyway, unlike his friend.
Spell after spell is cast, hexes and jinxes and counter curses flying everywhere. Draco can feel the bruises and burns accumulating, slowing him down, but he refuses to stop. He can’t let Potter get away with all the pain he’s caused. He has to make Potter pay. But he’s running out of things to throw at him, and this feels far too much like sixth year for his comfort. The only thing that has changed is that he’s not a pathetic child anymore. He’s been through a war, and the curse he tried back then for the first time has been cast many times since. He can do it now. Then Potter will suffer.
Which has been your favourite chapter (if you can't remember exactly, just describe your favourite scene.) and why?
Slowly, he warms up to it, joining in with Harry’s words, their voices speaking at jarringly different speeds. Harry slows down, rubbing his thumb across Draco’s hand in a soothing motion.
Theo? No, he’s broken up with Draco, he wouldn’t know about him now. Unless Potter made Draco do something to push Theo away? If that is the case, perhaps Theo would be the best person to talk to. Even so, she would rather go to someone else. Theo’s face is overwhelmingly punchable right now.
Harry grins, a puff of air escaping him. “Thank you. Really, I won’t let you down, I’ll prepare for everything and set out plans, Hermione-style. Thank you.”
Harry’s entire body is tense. It’s been too long since he was in a situation like this, pointing a wand at someone who might attack him, and he’s slightly ashamed to say he’s enjoying it a little too much. The adrenaline is pumping through him, faster, faster, urging him to stop waiting and protect himself. Or attack the half crouching boy in front of him. Either would be fine.
“They keep saying that they need to hold a trial for Sirius, since he was never officially cleared of his crimes, and the fact that we know that slimeball Pettigrew did it apparently doesn’t change that. He can’t have a trial now, he’s only just become alive again.” Remus rubs the bridge of his nose tiredly. “I think they just want a reason to make use of their court system. All that investment after the war, all of the money spent reforming the system, and they’ve barely used it since the Death Eater trials. Dragging up a dead case through the system will stop people complaining that they should have spent the money elsewhere.”
“Mistress would like mister Potter to follow Gobsy, sir.” A house elf pops into sight next to him, bony fingers fiddling with a silver sash.
Hermione’s forehead wrinkles as she leans on one arm. “Ron, you shouldn’t get so angry at them. I’m sure they’re just trying to survive this year without fighting, like us.”
Yeesh.. Ok, this chapter and the next were supposed to be one, but it went on for quite a long time, so I'm publishing this half now as an individual chapter and the next half later (when i actually finish writing it). Lots of Harry content, lots of Malfoy Manor content, and a whole lotta angst. Woop!
Thrusting out the magic, he envisions it like a hand, and reaches out towards the whispering concoction of intertwined magic. There’s some startled muttering and scratching of quills behind him from the Unspeakables, but he drowns it out to concentrate, scowling. The Veil hisses eagerly as the hand delves into it, shifting through the clawing magic to search for the distinct Draco inside there.
She opens her mouth to respond, then closes it, blinking rapidly. Her fingers are tight on the cup. Harry’s scared it might break, shattering and falling apart, and he imagines for a moment that the cup is her heart.
The Dark Mark is gone, just like Draco wished for, but Harry didn’t think it would be anything like this.
“He likes you.” Luna smiles, remembering how excited Grendel had been when she told her in person. ‘All those looks he gives her, all those looks she gives him! It’s delightful! Oh, how I wish I could be young and in love again…’
For everyone who has been reading this up to the 12/11/19 , I am so, so sorry! The chapters have been mixed up due to drafts being saved when I didn't want them to be.
This was a bad idea. She should stick to talking only to herself and portraits from now on. Or getting a pet would be good, one that sits there and listens, without understanding a word of what she’s saying. She should get a kneazle.
Harry brings Draco breakfast, and finds that he has died. His wand is destroyed, and his dark mark has been removed from him physically, with a mirror shard. Hermione sees after Harry, then another person who screams, which brings the rest of the eighth years over to see. Pansy checks on Draco, announces that he's dead, and then Hermione makes everyone leave. Harry is frozen for all of this.
Distantly, Harry takes in her swear word, brain fixated on the strangeness of her voice using it. It rolls over in his mind, repeating in her voice, then Ron’s, then Pansy’s, then Luna’s, then Harry’s own.
He can’t do this. Merlin, he can’t open it and find out that he’s too late, or never had a chance at all. The forehead kiss was for the damn spell, it didn’t mean anything, and he kissed Harry in front of all of these people, all of his friends, when Harry didn’t want to be kissed.
At the start of the year, he was little more than a ghost. Now, he is living, properly living, and has people there to catch him if he falls again.
He stares at the dead man in front of him. It does make sense. This is just his punishment, isn’t it? He should have kept the list, he should have tried to make amends, but he’d been too caught up in Theo and his own head. Now it’s too late.
McGonagall's voice snaps him from his rage. “Whilst you are studying seventh year material, you will not be in seventh year classes. This year will mostly be independent study, with lessons spread out through the week, where the professor will take you through the material and leave you work to do in your own time. Some may invite you to join a certain seventh year class, but be warned, this is likely a sign you are falling behind.”
Theo pauses, anger melting into the face of a dog caught stealing food. “I... You’ve seen how they’ve been treating us! It isn’t right! I can’t just sit there and take it, that isn’t fair, that isn’t what a Slytherin should do. We fight back.”
Sirius tries grabbing his hand, eyes wide, and Draco clings back as though Sirius is his last lifeline. Which he is, Draco supposes. This thought makes him grip tighter, a whimper escaping his throat.
Lupin had ducked into the common room briefly, only explaining that he thought Harry was ready to know. The letter he’d passed through is wrinkled and smudged with dirt, most likely from the battle. The edge is singed, bringing unpleasant memories of the heat and panic of the Fiendfyre. Crabbe had died in that fire. Harry remembers how angry Malfoy had been telling him about it, how he’d wished Harry had saved Crabbe instead because…
From his pocket, he pulls out a crumpled letter, singed with Fiendfyre. He’s lucky he didn’t die in that place, for the letter would have been burned up there. Now, at least, his mother and father can know his final words.
Perhaps they were, because this force is stronger than him. His heels dig into the ground as he’s towed forwards, towards the arch. No, no, he doesn’t want to die.
There’s a few moments of joking as the two struggle with the tightly packed wrapping paper (“Why did you put three layers on one box Hermione?” “I just had to make sure it wouldn’t fall apart!”) and then Black finally gets his open, revealing two books.
‘Father, this is Harry. My boyfriend.’ He rushes out, holding it together as best as possible. Harry stiffens behind him, and for a moment Draco thinks he’s done the wrong thing. Then Harry presses a kiss to his cheek with a massive grin, and Draco breathes out a sigh of relief, eyes focused on his father.
Hesitantly, he pokes it with his wand. Was that a twitch? Or just his imagination? It’s hard to tell with the light, so he squints closer, and then a brighter light floods across the page and he turns to thank whoever it is and stares up at Luna and Theodore in the doorway.
Alive. He- He drew… Jaebo… and now Jaebo is alive. Draco may be a little frazzled, but he’s not stupid; he knows what this means.
Forcing his hands not to tremble, he gradually lifts them in a placating gesture above his head. Don't hex me. Merlin, don't you dare hex me. Thankfully, no spell is cast, and they allow him to stand. Even if they don't lower their wands.
Theodore sighs. “We learnt about her in History. I know Binns is dull, but if you make a game out of his words, you can convince yourself to listen. In third year, us slytherins used to cast another mist charm word every time he said a date. By the end of class, we could usually barely see each other through the fog. I guess that’s why Draco could make those black letters so easily. He always made the darkest mist.”
Hermione ducks as the paper birds shoot over her head. “Looks like you’ve got that spell. Why don’t we take a break?”
Hermione’s heart twists at the thought of Dobby, now reduced to a little cross on a hilltop. She might fundraise sometime in the future, get a statue to commemorate all that he had done. Still, that was in the future, but now...
Thank you so much for all the comments! There was a load of them last chapter, I really love reading through and seeing your opinions. Theo will be the focus of a chapter soon, just to explain why he said the things he did, but for now he's going to be put to the side. After all, this is a drarry fanfic.
He shakes his head. The last thing he remembers is falling asleep as usual, in his own bed, thinking about Harry bloody Potter and his lips. He flushes.
Lucius swarms forward, pulling Draco into a tight hug he isn't sure what to do with. His throat is clogging up. He wants to say something, needs to spill out all of this emotion, needs to tell his father everything he’s been holding inside since he learnt how to hide.
With that, the man disapparates, leaving Harry reeling. Dead? Lucius? Surely he misheard. It would be wrong for both Draco and his father to die at the same time. It’s too much of a coincidence to be real.
"Guess we'd better go. Good luck with whatever you're supposed to do this year!" Ginny beams, grabbing Luna's hand to pull her away.
After this, Harry is brought to tea with Narcissa, and Draco is brought to lunch with the Weasley’s. The tea is sufficiently awkward, as one might expect with a combination of Sirius and Narcissa living in the same house. The renovations have been accelerating far quicker with Narcissa there, so at least the setting is pleasant. Kreacher apparently doesn’t welcome the influx of new house elves, so has retreated to the furthest corner of the house. This makes Sirius incredibly happy, but less so when the Malfoy house elves badger him about setting his feet on the coffee table, or leaving dirty laundry on the floor. Not only this, but every time Sirius makes a raucous joke, Narcissa sighs exasperatedly, and every time Narcissa dances around a sensitive topic with delicate words, Sirius gets irritated and snaps at her. Draco has a feeling that the only reason they didn’t descend into a shouting match was because Remus kept both of them on a tight leash.
Personal note: My sister is improving, now she's at home with her family and old friends. She's defintely less under stress, and thinking about different ways open to her, which has helped get her out of her trapped mindset. Your concern about her and me is really sweet, and I appreciate it so much, especially when you don't have any obligation to help me.
A choked sob escapes him, so he lets it all out and screams. The sound echoes through the trees, primal and raw, fueled by horror and guilt and pain. He shouldn’t have done it. Draco was getting better. He’d wanted to help, he’d wanted Draco to do everything he ever wanted. He wanted Draco to speak. He wanted Draco to tell him how grateful he was, to tell him he loved him.
Theo and Blaise exchange shocked looks as Remus nods. “Yes, they’re still trying to work it out. I’m sorry, Harry, I might have been a little too eager when I-”
Potter. That fucking lunatic. Pansy knows she appears crazed from the frightened looks she’s getting, but that dungheap of a wizard has crossed the line. First, he decides he likes Draco, so evidently he set all of this up just so he could get him.
Eyes wandering, she notices a lump in the closed curtains, which is moving. Ah. Cursing Blaise for telling her to stop anyone, she stands gracefully and glides over. If she has to behave like a chaperone, she may as well do it in style. With one flick, she pulls back the curtain, raising her eyebrow at the mass of ginger and blonde hair.
It wasn’t until the year after that he’d rediscovered it, around the time that he’d accepted the agony that was love for Harry Potter. Harry’s scent still clung to it, grass and broomstick polish wafting over him, so he’d cast a spell to preserve the smell and snuck it under his pillow. It was the only thing that helped him sleep at night for a long time, until it became far too dangerous to own something of Potter’s.
Draco buries his head into the dark, and tries to slip away into nothingness. It doesn’t work. It never does.
He had focused on studying in the Before, to impress his family and live up to their high expectations. Even when he was a child, running about their grand house, he had spent most of his time in the library, trying to cast spells with his mother’s wand. They never worked that well, but he was always delighted at the small showers of sparks or bangs.
(The redness, gaping open, blood and bones and muscle and Harry can’t fathom how he could ever have thought he’d seen everything. Bodies. Blood. Death. They’d hung around him for years, leaning over his shoulder, invading his life, but this is a thousand times worse. Draco’s eyes, blank and glassy, staring up-)
The first chapter, for me. I began with so much enthusiasm and inspiration that I can feel when I read it, even if I didn't separate the paragraphs back then and had no real plan. The start and end of a work is always my favourite, and the amount of thought and creativity I put into that first chapter is strange to read now that it's coming to an end. Plus... I just love angst too much, and that chapter's purpose was almost solely to convey how terrible Draco's life was.
They share a kiss, Harry’s scent washing over him, and Draco feels a swell in his heart as he realises he can savour that comforting smell whenever he wants, now. Perhaps it isn’t healthy to depend so much on one person, yet Draco can’t bring himself to care.
They slip into the silence again until Black speaks up. His voice is little more than a mutter, rambling to himself rather than actually addressing Draco.
“Ronald Weasley!” She tuts, letting Harry relax. That’s the only benefit to them fighting all the time; Harry doesn’t have to answer difficult questions. “Anyway, you haven’t answered my question!” She pokes him, and he groans in despair.
“I spent the last of my money getting this done.” He says, letting Harry trace the circle in astonishment. “White magic, specially created to withstand dark magic. It’s rare, impossible to find unless you know where to look. My mother did. I went through her journals, and found a white tattoo artist, who did this for me. The dark magic inside the circle is contained, and can’t do any damage outside of the circle. Therefore, it can’t make me feel pain, or make me think about the Dark Lord, or tell him where I am if he ever does come back.”
“But that isn’t what you called me for, right?” He tilts his head, revealing the smooth skin of his neck, and she digs her nails into her palms. Not yet.
“She was thinking about helping him with the line, but I got her to think about the worse off house elves and she agreed to take over F.H.E. as her main project. She’ll still advise on the fashion line, but we’ll spend a lot of time together.” Hermione speaks up, a wistful edge to her voice.
Pansy’s already sprawled on a chaise lounge, suspiciously similar to the exact one she had claimed in Slytherin, excluding the colour. This one, like many others, is a deep purple. It reminds him of a bruise.
Harry watches Malfoy from the other side of the Great Hall. He’s dropped his head on the table, platinum blonde hair falling messily over the wood.
Draco shakes his head vehemently, stomach lurching at the thought of having to see Mr Ollivander. The man had been kind during his stay in Malfoy Manor, but no one is kind enough to not hold a bitter grudge about that.
Lucius pauses, mouth pressed in a thin line. There’s a long, long silence. Pansy coughs awkwardly. He gets a sinking feeling that he should leave, right now, before his father starts shouting.
“Are you sure you should do this, Harry?” Hermione looks at him nervously. “What if you don’t have enough-”
Draco shakes himself back to the present, hand and cheek stinging from the harsh contact. Stand up. Face the gap. Step through.
Harry frowns slightly as ginny launches into an enthusiastic rant. She’d moved on too quickly. Normally, she would ramble on about whatever creature she’d mentioned for ages until someone stopped her, but she’d just turned and forgotten about it. He hates to suspect his friends, yet Harry is certain that Luna had lied to him.
Leaving his room. Draco digs his fingernails into his palms at the thought. He hadn’t been out for Merlin knows how long, and now Hermione is suggesting he leave just like that? As though it isn’t as hard for him as going up to McGonagall and punching her in the face.
“Harry, this was only for the spell-” Theo starts, worried, but Harry cuts him off, caught up in his own excitement.
Harry winces at the bitter tone of her voice, heart plummeting at her words. Lucius really is dead, then. How can he tell her about Draco now?
He isn’t surprised, honestly. The three of them only came back because Hermione wanted to, and Neville had needed to if he wants to apprentice under Professor Sprout. Hogwarts is a place stained for them all, now.
The common room is empty for once, most people out to help Harry and Theo or to arrange Narcissa’s move. With all of the pressure from them and their families, the ministry is bound to relent at some point. Luna would like to help, but she’s in the younger year, and Hermione insists they focus on their lessons.
“Like cold cream, remember? Cold cream and liquid strawberry.” Pansy mutters beside him. “Can you feel it?”
“Better?” Blaise smirks, brushing away a speck of dust on his shoulder. “I hadn’t noticed. Maybe we should try another round, and you can show me again how dismally poor you are at this.”
What is the dick playing at? Pretending to be cursed? Harry’s wand dips in his confusion, a bewildered expression spreading across his face. This is Malfoy. Malfoy who loves the sound of his own voice, especially when it’s saying cruel words to Harry and his friends.
“What are you staring at?! Luna may not move too quickly, but I am Sir Leofwine the Rapid! Onward, boy!” The knight speeds off, hollering and blowing a trumpet.
“Try not to spike his drink this time, yeah?” His traitorous red-haired friend snorts, as his sister turns to him with a confused and slightly dangerous expression.
Settling onto her favourite chaise lounge with another bottle, she surveys the room. Hermione is upstairs with Draco, teaching him charms, and so Ron is unrestrained. He’s got his arm around Potter, who looks exasperated, and is singing the Chudley Cannons theme song. Terry Boot is booing very loudly at him, which Pansy appreciates. They really are a terrible team.
He pushes himself to his feet hastily, brushing down his robes. They need a thorough wash after today. The gaps looms in front of him as he marches towards it, shuts his eyes, and waits for the tingle of magic.
With that, he turns to shuffle out again. The students hurriedly stand, gathering their friends, and follow him through halls they remember off by heart. Harry keeps pace with Ron and Hermione for a bit, before the space becomes too tight, and he’s forced behind. He starts to move to Neville, but he’s engaged in conversation with a hufflepuff girl. Baffled, Harry walks alone.
“I think I’d prefer to be helping people with better laws, rather than running the whole operation.” She says modestly, tucking her clipboard underneath her arm. “There’s not much diversity in the ministry yet. That’s something I’d like to fix.”
“I’m getting to that.” Theo sighs, rolling his eyes. “Some say she eventually decided that other people were getting too good at casting her spells, and so she cursed the spells themselves. Unless the caster had her blood, the spell would fail. Only her descendants could undo the spell, too.”
“The professors will be aware that some of you are further behind than others, so they have received a report on each of you, describing what you have or have not done. In our meetings, we have decided to start the year by working out your personal abilities. Therefore, the lessons will be quite flexible. Any more questions?”
“I don’t know. Isolation is bad for him, he needs someone there to talk to. Perhaps I should go.” Hermione stands, but Ron quickly leaps over and pulls her back down again.
And yes, maybe his future self will be cursing him to the high heavens, but he had to do it, and he doesn’t regret it one bit right now, even when they both fall to the floor in a mess of exhausted limbs, giggling madly.
“I’ll get you some tea. The living room is a little empty at the minute, there was a lot of… there was a lot in there.” He gestures to a door which she glides through, sitting gracefully on a sofa. The house elves bundle through the house after Lupin as he heads to the kitchen, all except Gobsy, who stands behind her.
Harry frowns at the thought, a little disturbed. It’s the same feeling he had when he learned his wand was Voldemort’s wand’s twin.
“Our years of Hogwarts have never been about the spells, or the potions, or any of the actual schoolwork. They’ve been about learning to become our best selves. They’ve been about the friendships we’ve made, the conflicts we’ve faced, the changes happening inside our own minds. Our learning was more unconventional than anyone else’s, but we should be proud of that! We should hold our heads high, and say ‘I was a fighter! I lived through a war, and came out the other side a better person than I was before!’ If we are to truly honour every life lost, and every memory made here, we should try to become a person we can be proud of.”
“Unfortunately, you are not allowed to join your house’s Quidditch team, but you are welcome to attend their meetings to give advice. Also, the school’s brooms and pitch are available to you outside of official practising times for personal use.”
“Hey, hey, calm down.” Black stops moving, holding his hands out as though he’s taming a wild animal. “It’s ok, I’m not going to hurt you. Even if I wanted to, which I don’t, I couldn’t hurt you in here. Do you know where you are?”
Draco lifts a hand to his forehead, lightly pressing his fingers on the wet spot. Yes, Harry James Potter, the Boy Who Lived Twice, the Saviour of the Wizarding World, had just kissed him on the forehead, just like that.
“Merlin.” Pansy mutters from next to him, pressing her scarf over her nose. She has her wand in hand, ready to intervene in case everything goes wrong. Hermione insisted she wasn’t needed, but she came anyway. Draco is her best friend, closer to him than anyone else had been.
“Do you think I should have done something differently?” Black glances at him, then stalls as he sees Draco’s expression. “Are you alright?”
“Anything for you, fair maiden.” He simpers, tucking his wand back into his trousers. He’d designed the pocket there himself, fully warded and disguised. Smart, really, but Pansy is more appreciative of the uninterrupted view of his ass.
Harry flinches, shoving the image away as he examines the room. It must be Draco’s. No guest room would smell this strongly of him, and his parents room would not have an empty wardrobe. Well, almost empty. Robes hang there, green and black and silver. Harry wonders why Draco never wore anything but muggle clothes under his cloak.
“It’s ok, Luna, you don’t need to know.” The redhead reassures her, kissing her lightly on the head and trying to contain any further laughter.
Inside, everything is exactly as it had been. The only difference is the professors sitting at the head, and the number of students left to be there. Every table has gaps, not noticeable to any newcomer, yet so large and gaping that a stab of guilt rips through Draco’s stomach. Gaps where grinning faces once talked and laughed together. Now they will never laugh again.
“The owl dropped this outside. I think it’s from your mum.” He lights a couple of candles, bringing a dim light to the room that Malfoy won’t complain about. The blonde squints at him from under the blankets, mouth downturned.
Harry knocks lightly on the door, a tray of food in hand. He’d woken up earlier than usual, filled with nervous energy and excitement. Draco doesn’t have a Dark Mark. Draco will be happy! All because Harry had spent sleepless nights pouring over books, and had found a cure. Hermione will be so proud of him when she finds out!
Draco shrugs, dropping his slender arms to tuck his hands into his pockets. He’s still skinny, but he’s nowhere near the skeleton he was all those months ago. Harry supposes his posture helps to make him look less dead - the slight slouch in his shoulders is gone, replaced with the confidence Harry remembers from their younger school days. Somehow, his annoyance at it has gone since then. He feels more happy about it than anything else.
Instead, he lifts his head and flips to the next page of the book. The candle beside him flickers dimly, making the words on the page dance.
Theo stumbles back as Draco’s yelling punches inside his mind, smashing every barrier like a mallet to sugar.
Oh, and one more quick one: Would you rather have more time with Slytherins or Gryffindors (+ Luna)?
“Give it up.” Blaise drawls from the corner, nose buried in a newspaper. “It’s gone. Kaput. Flown out the window. Buried itself in a hole and died there.”
Potter and his friends are at the front, despite their intolerance of Argus, voices raised in boisterous chatter. Pigs. Can’t they lower their voices just a little?
(Pale blonde hair, surrounding his face like a halo. The picture of an angel, floating up to heaven, except his skin is cold and his eyes are ice and there’s a drip drip dripping of blood-)
“Leave him, Pans.” Blaise smirks. “If you tell him to get up, he might just stay there out of spite."
“Harry!” Luna’s voice, sharp and urgent, snaps at him from behind. He turns, frowning, to find her dreamy expression twisted in concern. “You need to go to the fourth floor corridor. Now! Don’t ask questions! Go!”
“I thought you meant ‘exciting’.” Hermione shakes her head, one hand pressed to her temple. “This is giving me a headache.”
He shakes his head, snorting. Competition? Please. The only competition for attractive, smart boy is Blaise, who’s already won by the state of Draco’s entire being. No girl is attracted to a black mess on the floor.
The portraits twitter around him as he sets off into a sprint, abandoning his bag with Luna. It’s only when he’s halfway there that he starts to question her blind panic, wondering if this is actually just an elaborate prank. Real danger, or prank? How can he tell? Either he goes there and risks falling into a prank, or he doesn’t go there and risks someone getting hurt. Without realising it, he’s slowed his pace, doubts falling thick and heavy.
Woah! So many responses! It's wonderful to hear about you all, seems there's a lot of slytherins here. (Although this is a fanfic focused on Draco, a slytherin, so I really shouldn't be surprised...) Next question is at the bottom! I can't wait to see what you think.
“Even so, I’m really grateful you decided to try.” He holds out his hand, which she shakes. “Have you told Neville yet?”
Hermione and Ron have drawn away from him. They don’t pair up with him in class, or force him to do his homework. He has to sleep in the room where Draco’s body lay, cold and still, because he can’t bear the thought of having to ask Ron to move to his room instead. Half of him thinks Ron wants him to, so that they can talk it out and be friends again, but the other half thinks Ron doesn’t want to be around a killer.
He shakes his head in frustration. “You know that’s just a trick, headmistress, they don’t give a fuck about us!”
He lifts and drops his shoulders in a shrug as Blaise closes the door behind them, seating himself opposite. It wasn’t that he didn’t want them there - indeed, he was glad he would have someone to stick up for him - but he wasn’t ready for these questions. He just wasn’t ready. Why could nobody see that?
Gently, Harry places his wand on the floor, letting the light dim, and wraps Malfoy into a hug. For a moment, he’s worried he’s done the wrong thing. Malfoy tenses, body shaking, but then he relaxes and dumps his head into Harry’s shoulder. His tears leak through Harry’s jumper, but he doesn’t mind at all. A snotty jumper is a small price to pay to make the person you love feel even a little bit better.
Parkinson and Zabini glare at each other, challenging the other to speak up first, while Nott's face is stoic. Harry snorts inwardly at their perfect sense of Slytherin preservation - to challenge McGonagall would be either very brave or very stupid indeed. His eyes rest on a mass of fluffed blonde, which has replaced Malfoy’s face. Harry's amused expression morphs into annoyance. He's not even paying attention, head resting on the table again.
“Draco! Stop!” He called him Draco. “You didn’t kill- you just didn’t. Calm down, you aren’t thinking straight.”
‘The intended does not have to answer verbally, however it is recommended. If they answer truthfully, the spellcaster must kiss their forehead, and the spell will be cast. If they answer dishonestly, the spellcaster must spit out the meal and the spell will be null.’
Would you prefer a more spaced out layout? For example, I would split the paragraphs up more, and leave larger gaps between sections.
She grins happily. “Thanks Harry. I just hope it works, and isn’t abandoned by the Ministry like some other projects.”
Except he won’t die. He can do this. If some old wrinkly ancestor of his can do it, then surely he can save one measly soul.
As soon as he’s left, Draco rubs his eyes wearily. Far too much is happening today for his liking. All he wants is to be back in his room in the Manor, curl under the covers, and sleep until it all goes away. Heaving himself to his feet once more, he grabs his robes from his trunk and steps out into the corridor.
Mind magic, mind magic… Aha! Harry pulls out a thick book, suppressing his coughs at the flurry of dust, and tucks it under his cloak. It’s not like the book will be missed.
“No, Harry, listen.” The other boy rubs his eyes frustratedly. “Only her descendants. After she died, her son felt guilty for all of the horrible results from backfiring spells. He wasn’t powerful enough to undo her work, but he found a way to change it. No one could truly die as a result of a spell backfiring. Instead, they would be sent to a safe place until he, her only descendant, could undo the spell. In time, people learned not to cast any of her spells, and so he stopped needing to save people and moved on.”
Harry looks over at the person shaking on the floor, and his mind stops functioning. He’d recognise that beanie anywhere.
Harry stares at the name. Crabbe, Draco’s lackey, who died in the fiendfyre. He remembers Draco, tears running down his face, screaming that Harry should have saved Crabbe and not Draco.
The Saviour, true to his nature, rushes forward to grab Argus, but it’s too late. The old man’s foot goes straight over the rubble and off the building.
This is so mad. I was supposed to be doing my GCSEs this year, but I guess not! I hope everyone is staying safe, washing their hands and surviving isolation. I myself am fine, as I'm a huge introvert who adores hiding in my room with many books, so I wish everyone else the best. Maybe I'll update more often, now that I have too much time on my hands, and you can fend off boredom with this!
He’s almost convinced. Almost. But new hope is a lie when the sea of students recoil from them as though they’re dementors. Briefly, his grey eyes scan the stream, picking out familiar faces. Longbottom. Loony Lovegood. The she-weasel. Abbott, Macmillan, Finch-Fletchley, and Bones from Hufflepuff. Boot, Corner, and Brockle-something from Ravenclaw. And of course, the weasel, Mudblood, and Golden Boy. (Not mudblood you don’t call them that it’s muggleborn you fool muggleborn NOT MUDBLOOD!)
“You could tell him you like him back.” Luna suggests. “I’m pretty sure he’s straight, even though he did kiss Draco once.”
It's not often I'll do this, but I think I'll start recommending writers or specific fanfictions to you. (I really just need something to do or write about, and I've seen other people do it, so I thought, why not?)
Harry sits back, pushing his glasses up his nose. “Don’t worry, I wasn’t going to leave until you called. How are things back in Grimmauld Place?”
“None of your business, Potter.” Blaise spits, already back to that pretentious pureblood sneer. “If you want to find out, go ask him yourself.” With a dramatic flick of his cloak, he glides away.
Draco nods, tucking away the garbage wand. He knows he needs his old wand back, but how is he supposed to ask Potter for it?
Gradually, he regains enough of his balance to walk unassisted, yet the house elf insists on staying by his side, ‘just in case youse is gonna falls, sir’. He doesn’t change, not quite yet ready, so they make their way through the empty halls, Draco’s eyes fixed on the floor, until they reach the kitchens. The house elves don’t shoo him out politely like they used to do. The dining room is a closed off area now, crackling yellow spells across the doors as though they could hold in the nightmares of that place. Even if any of them could steel themselves to go in there, the stench of dark magic and death would be enough to drive them out.
“Great!” Remus pulls a face. “Well, Kreacher is being a pain about some objects. ‘It’s Regulus’s favourite watch’ or ‘that was built before you were born, you can’t throw it out’. That sort of thing.”
“Malfoy?!” Ron stares at him from a large circle the group has made, which includes a flushed Pansy sprawled all over Blaise. A lot has happened, it seems.
“Oh. Uhm. Would you like to come and find some knotgrass with me? Pansy wants it to make a potion for Blaise.”
“Oh, another thing.” Harry looks a little sheepish, rubbing at the back of his neck. “When this year is over, do you… want to stay at Grimmauld Place? It’ll be a little crowded, with me, your mum, Sirius, Remus, you and sometimes Teddy, along with all of the house elves, but… it housed the entire Order of the Phoenix at one point, so…”
Despite the Ministry being badly understaffed, they are taking precautions against any applicants. After the war, with the whole wizarding world crippled, the Ministry has become mortally afraid of any corruption. The slightest ripple of trouble could send the whole structure tumbling at this rate.
“No, no, I think we’d actually like your help.” Harry slides his chair closer to the fireplace. “You know Vizzini?”
There’s a startled pause. Then strong arms envelop him, press their bodies closer, and he’s kissing him back - he’s kissing him back! - and Draco doesn’t even process the shocked noises around them because his heart is on fire and he’s alive alive alive alive alive alive!
She nods. “Psyche ward. It’s only for me at the moment, until I pass a test they’re going to make, and then I’ll be teaching others and practicing on my own patients.”
“Well you’d better eat a lot at the feast tonight, I can’t bear to-” She cuts off, suddenly noticing his outfit. “Draco! What in Merlin’s name are you wearing? Is that...muggle…clothing?” Her nose wrinkles up, and she not-so-subtly shifts away from him, as though afraid it might stain her clothes.
Remus shakes his head, dropping into an armchair. They’d all congregated in the eighth year common room, the rest of their year group migrating to their rooms so they can have some peace. Remus and McGonagall are in the process of madly trying to convince the ministry to not let the newspapers grab hold of the story whilst also trying to agree how best to handle the situation with the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and the Department of Magical Accidents and Catastrophes. All in all, it's been a hectic night.
"Pansy, Slytherins can't be given special treatment. You're not going to need wards or a wand during the night, don't be so melodramatic. Sit down."
Perhaps he could own a little potions shop, with strange mixtures in jars like Snape had… Then again, he’d need customers. Customers who’d buy from an ex-Death Eater. Customer’s who’d buy legally from an ex-Death Eater. Unless he wanted to go into selling illegal potions, he’d go bankrupt in less than a month.
Draco nods, setting his potions essay down and rubbing his eyes. He holds his hand out, and Hermione watches a glass of water fly into it with pleased eyes. His non-verbal magic has been getting better, especially now he’s stopped using the useless wand. She could see from the second that he picked it up it was all the wrong shape and size for him.
“I’d rather try to recreate it by myself. Can I see it, please?” she asked, holding out her hand politely.
Viktor, as usual, remained impeccably still and unperturbed. Really, for all that he despised the status, he truly was the perfect teacher’s pet.
“Well, English is the first language for the large majority of the students here,” Draco said. “They probably don’t need the translation spell all that much, to be fair. That’s not to say we should excuse their incompetence, though. They could have looked for a more efficient one.”
“So you’ve said, loudly and multiple times,” Harry said drily. “I’m sure the Sorting Hat would try to sort you to it if you came within a hundred yards of it, even as a foreign student.”
When he did, however, he saw that it didn’t look at all like it used to. It had lost its blurriness, and acquired some sort of definite contour and a more solid color, though it still had no recognizable shape.
"I..." Harry was at a loss for words, and he gulped. He had thought about it at length during the past weeks: what would he say, what would he do, if Draco ever offered to resume whatever had been going on between them? During the first week after the Potions lab, he would have scorned the offer, without any hesitation, or at least he had thought he would. After, he had rejected the very possibility that it would ever happen and now, confronted with it, his feelings were so overwhelming he couldn't parse them out. He had been so angry at Draco, he was still so angry, and hurt over the whole event. He had still not gotten any sort of real explanation about what it had all been about, and from Draco's words, it didn't seem like he would ever get any. Yet his chest was full to bursting, and the contact of Draco's hand on him still filled him with nervousness and hope. He
Draco shrugged. He didn’t think anything, hadn’t really had time to explore the idea anyways. It was a grand idea, that was for sure, that this boy he was pashing on shared a soulmark with him. But they would not be the first two people with soulmarks to think they had found each other, then realized they were mistaken when the first of their marks settled, and the other’s didn’t.
Time to go, then, he thought as he took one last glance at the other Champions: Cedric and Fleur had both opted for the Bubblehead Charm – which Hermione had, quite insultingly, considered as way too complicated for him – and Viktor... Viktor was now a weird mix of human and shark. Durmstrang really had a weird way of teaching its students.
He was not helping, he knew that, but he was also quite unclear on whether or not he really wanted to know where this was going. Not that Harry seemed likely to quit his efforts to say his piece. Damn that Gryffindor courage. Draco wasn’t sure he could handle it.
“Grimhildr!” she said, and clasped her hand over her mouth, her eyes bulging out. Viktor looked flabbergasted. Glancing around, Draco caught sight of numerous other students displaying similar reactions, which he guessed came mostly from pureblood families. Most of the professors’ expressions ranged from shocked to completely furious – Draco would have advised Rita Skeeter to stay out of the path of that Transfiguration professor, or all bets were off for her life.
On the last week of October, Ron apologized to Hermione, and acknowledged that maybe, being in Slytherin didn’t automatically make you a minion of Evil. Hermione, who had never been accused by anyone of being a gracious winner, offered to accept his apology if he joined S.P.E.W. That started another round of fighting, but Harry somehow enjoyed the squabbling.
“Why, Rasputin, can’t wait for a few minutes?” Draco ribbed, as if he had not been the one playing the mystery up. “You have no patience at all.”
Draco really should have seen that one coming. He had know the kid was clueless, after all, a walking disaster, even.
“Oh for Merlin’s sake,” he had time to hear before Draco tackled him to the floor, yelling “Protego maxima!” over his shoulder.
There's only one rule to remember about Durmstrang, as far as Draco is concerned: it's always Rasputin's fault.
Yep, definitely crushing hard on the Potter boy, that girl. He couldn’t help but think she was onto something, though. His mother had always expressed a lot of surprise at the thought that her cousin had betrayed the Potters to the Dark Lord, as he had always rejected the
“Uh, yes you do,” Ron said, giving him a weird look. “You’re always behaving like a dolt in front of him, just like you do around Cho or Cedric. You’re always going off to meet him, mate, you even blew me off the other day because apparently that was the only time he was free. You’re going to the Yule Ball with him!”
“Look, I just wanted to thank you for the tip last time,” the Hufflepuff said, leaning forward a bit to whisper this. “Without you I would have been toast.”
I kinda like the parallel that Harry and Ron had a fight previously in part due to Harry's interactions with Draco, and that now Viktor and Draco sorta have one as well because of the discontinuation of the interaction.
“Well, I told him, didn’t I?” the guy replied. “You’d think he’s the one who’s lived in Britain his whole life, the way he went on about how we needed to be ready for the wilderness of Hogwarts. Like it ever gets as cold as Durmstrang here.”
It would have been too much to expect, probably, that no consequence would follow of these awful circumstances, though. The jury had barely given them their notes, and left them free to get dried and changed in relative peace, when Draco ambushed him.
“How did you even get to the conclusion that I hadn’t liked it? I kissed you!” he exclaimed, instead.
“What Blaise means,” Pansy interrupted, glaring at her friend. “Is that Potter and his friends have a tendency to attract attention.”
“They must be stewing,” Ron giggled as he elbowed Harry. “Look at them, they’ll be as red as their robes in two minutes.”
“You said you had been forced,” he hissed, feeling as if he had been immerged in some burning hot liquid. “You said you had been Imperius-ed.”
Draco would firmly deny any accusation that he also seemed to randomly hang out in areas where Potter had been known to loiter around that time, no matter how many times Svetlana repeated them.
It seems as if, everytime Harry is in a hurry, something conspires to make him late. That day, it's Diggory, and of course Draco
“Hum, so,” Harry started, and stopped. “I was wondering,” he tried again. “I mean, I have been wondering.”
you wearing, Weasel?” Draco said in horror as he finally took a good look at him. “Grimhildr, this is even worse than I dared to expect. Don’t you have
“Why would I even want to put myself in harm’s way?” Draco rolled his eyes. “Rest assured, I have not developed any Gryffindor-like suicidal tendencies in four months at Hogwarts.”
Yeah, well, worrying endlessly about what he had done to Draco before going back to his dorm wasn’t very conductive to rest, Harry had found out. He had only managed to fall asleep in the early hours of the morning, which had led to missing his alarm, and now he was late. He didn’t feel tired, though, propelled forward by anxiety and manic energy. What if Draco had already left? What if Draco didn’t feel like seeing him after that stupid, stupid kiss? Worse, what if he didn’t want to talk to him anymore?
Svetlana was a short and stocky witch in her last year, who always wore her long reddish-brown hair in a low ponytail and always looked vaguely disappointed in you. She was also quite brilliant at duelling, and Draco was confident that she would be amongst the eleven Karkaroff selected to attend the Tournament.
Which was very much not an apology. Harry hadn’t expected one, exactly, because he knew by now that Draco didn’t really
Harry turned and, sure enough, Mrs Malfoy, if that was her, was fussing with her son’s collar. She was a beautiful woman, with blonde hair several shadescloser to golden than her husband and son’s, and she was talking at him all the while she straightened the otherwise impeccable outfit. The boy – Draco – smiled at her indugently between his answers, as he let her touch him as much as she wanted. To Harry’s eyes, it did not look so much as she was spoiling him rather than him letting himself be spoiled for her own pleasure. He thought it was sweet,just like when Molly tried to feed her brood each enough roast for ten persons at once. Different styles, same sentiment.
His roommate hadn’t fared quite so well and had ended up with his eyes sewed shut for months. His countercurse was simple, so long as you weren’t so hated no one was willing to look it up for you. Dąbrowski belonged to that category, and it had taken so much time for him to rope a first year into telling him the solution, he had had to repeat the year. Draco would always remember the moment they had learned this with fondness, both for the look on Dąbrowski’s face and the pleasure he himself had felt in the knowledge that he would be assigned a new roommate.
“Of course,” Draco sighed. “Soulmarks are old magic, older than any written or oral traditions, and they’ve always, always been between people who changed each other’s lives in a positive manner. You can be exceptionnal all you want, you will never be the exception to the oldest rule of magic that we know of. Don’t worry,” he added, tracing Harry’s scar with the thumb of his free hand. “That’s the only mark the Dark Lord’s left on you.”
It went something like this, as far as Draco managed to retrace the precious few minutes of calm that they experienced that morning: he sat down between Svetlana and Viktor for breakfast at the Slytherin table, as per usual, and looked for Harry’s mess of hair amongst the red and gold. He found it, and found the green eyes already turned towards him, and smiled at him half-teasingly, and Harry, to his great delight, answered with a shy smile of his own and ducked his head, before raising it again. Granger, by his side, seemed to be acting in a similar vein with Viktor: the only one who appeared disatisfied with the situation was Weasley, who by his expression and the way he glared at Draco before dropping his head in his hands, must have been bemoaning the situation at length.
"They're calling you to give off the marks," the Durmstrang boy said, before stalking off towards the shore, leaving Harry's shoulder burning with the imprint of his hand.
"No," Harry snapped, unable to help himself. "You don't get to say that, and I don't want to hear it."
No one could care about the minutiae of ancient enchantments as much as Svetlana Rasputin, anyway. If you let her, she would talk your ear off for hours, and keep at it even if you fell facedown in your soup bowl from boredom. Draco had learned early on to prevent such diatribes by expressing his disinterest loud and clear.
Draco had resisted telling Antoniy about the Triwizard Tournament, and the fact that he would attend, for the whole length of their first afternoon at Durmstrang. He had only hinted that he knew something big while they unpacked their trunks, and that he would be part of it, and overall riled up his roommate nice and good about the whole issue, just for the pleasure of seeing his friend’s indignant face when Karkaroff announced it.
“Mr Potter, what are you doing here? The ball is over, you’re supposed to be on your way back to Gryffindor,” the woman had just come their way, and watched them severely over the rectangles of her glasses.
, and burrowed under the covers, hoping to sleep until he forgot ever having met Draco Malfoy, sleep for so long it might as well have been forever.
This launched a lengthy explanation of all the exploits Harry Potter and his friends – a Weasley and a muggleborn called Granger – had been involved in during their three previous years, which did make for an impressive list considering the short amount of time they had had to perform them. Some sounded quite far-fetched, and had likely grown deformed with the rumour: Harry Potter had killed their Defense teacher during their first year, Harry Potter had met Nicolas Flamel and been given his philosopher’s stone, Harry Potter was a Parseltongue, Harry Potter had killed a basilisk with his bare hands, Harry Potter had killed Sirius Black, faithful servant of the Dark Lord, and hidden his body while the murderer awaited the Dementor’s kiss, and so forth and so forth. For a fourteen year-old, he certainly sounded larger than life.
“Well, you’ve got me, obviously,” he said with a grin. “And I’m the superior dancer in this whole school, teachers and foreign students included.”
“This is not about stupidity, Draco. This is about loyalty,” Lucius said, his voice low and his eyes focused.
She raised for her hands in defense, not saying one word more, and Draco went back to staring at the Gryffindor’s table, which had the merit of immediately alleviating his irritation.
Draco could see how it would be, from their point of view: he knew they had hoped for him to meet his soulmarked at Durmstrang, filled as his school was with European witches with the best pedigrees, and here he was, with a partner that, in all probability, attended the very school they had sent him away from. When she had heard about his friendship with the Rasputin siblings, Narcissa had encouraged him to meet as many as possible of their family: a soulbond with someone of the sprawling Russian family would have been a master stroke, an alliance such as the Malfoy line could only have dreamed of. They spent too much time with muggles, to be sure, but that could be ignored in the light of their political and financial influence.
“SILENCE,” Dumbledore’s amplified voice thundered above the general noise, which pettered out. As one, all the students turned to him: he had rised, and his uncharacteristically serious face silenced the last remaining murmurs.
Spontaneous combustion was not a thing, to the best of Harry's knowledge, though he had never given much thought to the fact since discovering the world of wizardry. Maybe it was indeed a thing in this world, he thought dazzedly as he acquiesced and watched Draco's mouth descend towards him. His lips were soft, even softer than that time they had touched Harry's cheek, that time before the train. Harry felt like every nerve on his body thrummed, like before a Quidditch match but better somehow, different.
Draco deflated under the combined weight of both his parents’ stares, Lucius’, so close to disappointment, and Narcissa’s mixed equal parts with sadness and hope.
“I can’t even understand vy it is so bad,” Svetlana said. “I do not even have zat much of accent vhen I speak English!”
“I vill not vear a badge for Hogvarts,” Svetlana said flatly. “I am supporting Viktor, you know, like a good friend should.”
“You do know you’re supposed to cheer for our champion, not Hogvarts’?” Svetlana said as she installed herself on the other side of the Slytherin table.
“You can sit down wherever you want.” I yell to him as I start opening cupboards looking for a vase or something. “I’m just trying to find something for these and I’ll be right there.” As no response came I looked back towards the living room to find him sitting down, finally. His choice being on the far end of the couch.
I hadn’t seen him for years. Back then he was all sharp edges, with pristine clothing and not one hair out of line. I couldn’t stand him, his words just as sharp as his appearance. Ron and Hermione agreed every time I would complain about anything involving him. During the war he changed; he seemed to be losing his sharp exterior as if he was fighting himself. He proved me right when he fought alongside us in the end. I never managed to thank him, seemingly just having disappeared.
“Maybe you need to” Grabbing the bottle out of my hand and putting it on the bar beside us, he removes his hand from my knee before continuing. “You’ve never done this much cleaning in well, I think since the Dursleys mate.” A slight chuckle arose from the both of us.
Thank you all so much for reading. I do have another part planned but with it being the weekend and me not being in the best place mentally it may take a bit. I want it to be good for you all so I don't want to rush, especially with the dialogue. I will be keeping this as fluff as I can.
“You’ve moved that five times already mate, it looks fine.” Ron said as I went to lift the bowl of candy he’d brought.
As if sensing I was looking at him, he looks up at me. Shocked at first but then he showed a knowing smile, reminiscent of how he’d look getting a question correctly in class. I smiled back in only what I can imagine as awkward. He looks back down at his book after a few moments.
“Yeah, a movie could work.”  Pulling out my own phone, I typed in his description of what type of movie we should watch. “Do you think I should get snacks too?”
“So how’s writing going?” Ron asked, making me drop the quill and almost spill ink all over the floor. I could see him holding back laughter. Crumbling up the ruined parchment I threw it at him, mumbling obsenistys as I grabbed the quill off the floor and this time going for a muggle paper. Ron chuckled, raising his hands up in defense before grabbing the crumbled ball and throwing it in the bin.
He walked over to the couch, owl still burrowing into him before he continued. “I didn’t notice til we were older, but she has quite the inkling of helping broken things.”
“I told you to plan this so that would be fine.” Draco spits out, rather fast. Hands clenched at his sides once again. The loose shirt he was wearing showed his breathing had quickened.
“They do sound nice tonight” Finally looking at him I notice he is looking at the ground, trying to focus on something other than me. “Is there anything you wanted to talk about tonight?” I ask, this causes him to look at me. He sighs before fixing his posture and pulling that smile again. Still, I don’t quite understand how it looks like that, how he could look like that.
“Okay,” I replied instantly. Before looking at the time and realizing I’m late for a meeting. “I have to go but maybe we can meet again?” Looking at me he smiles again.
“This is the last family portrait we took before I realized he was wrong.” He looked, younger than I would’ve thought. It looked to be second or third year. Flipping through the book again he points to another photo “This is the last one we ever took as a family, or rather, being on speaking terms with one another.” It was right before sixth year, you could tell because Bellatrix was in the background. Putting the book back in his pocket he just sat there.
“Perfectly clear Ron” I say as I start to stand up, my hands going numb at this point. He sighs as he sees me get up, footsteps starting to follow me as I walk to go grab a drink.
If it is all the same to you, I would truly enjoy ‘hanging out’ once again. This time rather, how about you pick the time and place? Maybe then you wouldn’t fumble your words as much.
Sadly it will be a few more days before I can return to London. This business truly takes a lot of attention, as annoying as it is.
“Yea why not?” He asked, going to throw away his own drink before joining me again. “The woman I’ve been seeing recently? Her and I watch movies all the time at our places.” Pulling out his muggle phone that Hermione made him get, he pulled up a picture of them. It looked like his living room. And there they were, just sitting on his couch in nightwear, all smiles and just, happy looking.
Ron had showed up early, bringing twenty times more candy than I needed him to. I don’t really know why, but he was convinced that everyone that would be attending would need two bowls of candy to themselves. Which goes to show why I’m the one always hosting the get togethers. My poor coffee table had at least ten bowls on it alone, that left hardly any room for people to actually put their drinks on the damn thing.
“I hope this isn’t a bother but I was wondering if I could come in.” He spoke up after a moment of me just staring at him, looking up at me as he did so. Silently I moved out of the way of the door, opening my arm to allow him inside, not really caring about the inevitable water he was tracking into the house.
"I don’t know what a ‘movie’ is, so I don’t know what to expect” Oh, I guessed I had figured he had gone into the muggle world when he left. Pink turned red as he looked back to the television. Remembering how I explained it to Neville when he’d first been asked to go to one by that girl. Now that I think of it, he had been quite scared too, maybe it wasn’t because it was his first date since the yule ball.
I waited til everyone left, which wasn’t too long. Ginny and Luna decided to go back to their flat shortly after the whole owl incident,considering Luna was already in and out of consciousness. The twins went with, saying they were getting a new shipment of something, I really don’t want to know what, for a new product early and wanted to be awake for it. Fred held the door open after he shrunk their chest, while George helped direct Ginny through the door. She decided that she needed to carry Luna out to not wake her.
“Is this seat taken?” I ask as soon as I get to his table. He takes a moment to look up from his book before he smiles again, nodding his head in the direction of the empty chair.  As I’m moving to sit he starts to grab the scrap paper next to him and puts it on the page of his book, before slowly closing it and setting it down on the table.
Following behind him I close the door with my free hand. Without looking I almost run into him, seeing as he is just awkwardly standing just in front of the doorway. His hands shoved deep into the pockets of his jacket, shoes close together as he just looks at me.
“It’s too crowded” Draco said the moment I got to the restaurant. “I went in and could barely even hear my own thoughts” He seemed slightly on edge and starting to bounce back and forth. Yet, he seemed to forget his hands were full.
Ron reaches his hand down, waiting for me to grab it. Pulling me up before putting the drink far out of my reach. Mumbling about magic and how I always forget wizarding things. I just stood there, my heart practically beating out of my chest.
“Why France? Couldn’t find a job around here” With his skill, it shouldn’t have been hard. No matter how much of a prat he was, he was still one of the smartest in that whole castle.
against the table as we spoke that day causing me no anger, yet when Ron would do it I’d imagine cutting his entire hand off.
“So let me guess, marble floors and chandeliers?”  The sarcasm evident in my voice, finishing up the letter as I whistle to Hedwig to come down from her perch.
Also the unnamed Ravenclaw? Will remain unnamed because she is me. This isn't self insert thing I just need this for my sanity so I don't write a whole fanfic for myself :)
Draco’s owl is an exact replica of how he was most of Hogwarts. Six times, the little shit woke me up six times. At first it was just flying across my room, and yes, I’ll admit I am a light sleeper so this didn’t annoy me. The second time was chirping, Hedwig and him seemed to be having quite the conversation perched right outside my door. They only stopped ‘talking’ to one another when I got up, kind of like they wanted me to believe I was only hearing things. The third, fourth, and fifth were very similar, the owl was just really loud. He just felt the need to do the loudest things he could do. Walking around instead of flying, knocking things off the counter to see if it’d wake me ect. Half the time I just had to pretend to be asleep, for some reason I thought that’d stop him.
“I just did it, without much thinking really.”  He looked at me again after the laughing subsided. Taking his seat back, a much more serious look on his face.
“Not knowing why.” He offers me a smile, pulling out one of the stools and patting it, before sitting on the one right next to it. Sitting down he puts his hand on my knee, obviously trying to calm me. It proves true when he summons a bottle of water and hands it to me. “Have thought about why?”
I’ve never been good with owls. Writing to people has never been my strong suite, finding out exactly what to say makes rewriting the same thing over and over unavoidable. Most of the time I tend to avoid owls, just using floo calls or muggle devices.
“I didn’t think of it until you said it honestly. Didn’t even think I was into blokes.” Thinking about it now I should’ve known. I’d caught myself watching the quidditch games a little too closely back at school.
“That is exactly what I said Ron.” His laugh gets louder and I can feel my nails digging into my palm.
Throwing my wand onto the ground I lay my head back down, slowly wrapping my hands around Draco. As I do so, he burrows his head further into my chest.
“Maybe just think about it? Things like this take time.” Swiftly he pointed to the clock on the wall. “And hate to break it to you, but it looks like he’ll be here soon.”
“Reminded me of Lovegood, only she made more sense, most of the time.” Tying the paper to Hedwig I nod at him to continue. “She also had a small muggle flag in the shop, one of those Pride things I believe they’re called?  It read very open-mindedly, you’d be comfortable there I feel.”
Pages from the muggle magazines everywhere, some ripped to shreds, others just thrown haphazardly. Bowls and silverware scattered across the floor of the kitchen, thankfully nothing was in them. The roll of paper towels was now completely unrolled and wrapped around practically everything above a certain height. Candy wrappers from last night now out of the trash and piling up beside it.
He didn’t do either, actually. Slowly his glare holding my own stare softened. Going from anger to slight confusion, his eyebrows furrowed together as he got up. Letting the blanket fall from his chest, he carefully, as if the ground was covered with glass, walked over to me. When he got to me he watched my face for a moment, maybe waiting for a Weasley prank to insue when he got too close. After waiting for a few seconds, he caved.
“Well I guess the thing to think about is, where do you want to go with this?” Glancing towards me before continuing. “Like, where do you want this relationship to go with him?”
Draco was just standing there, clothing soaked from the constant rain. His hair was going every possible way, the wind blowing it as such. A few stray pieces had stuck to his forehead, soaked with the rain.
“I wanted to be him so bad.” Draco spoke up out of nowhere, in the quietest whisper. “Mother made it seem as if I had to be, as if it was this honor to even know him. I know now she did that to protect me, but it was all I wanted back then.”
“Well of course I do.” I hesitate before I continue. “I still don’t understand why this would answer my question.”
“You don’t?” He has walked back over to the couch, once again grabbing the blanket, only this time resting it on his lap. Watching me as I struggled to move the vase onto the table, I heard him chuckle as I placed the flowers inside and water starting to overflow. Rushing to grab towels, I heard him laugh. Stopping for a moment I looked at him, his head was buried into the blanket as a stifled laugh rang throughout the rooms.
“No!” He yelled soon after, looking startled. “I was thinking maybe we could just go on a walk?” Taking a pause to look around us and then back at me. “It’s rather beautiful out and it’s quiet enough that we could talk” Smiling back at me again, somehow it looks more stunning than the last time I saw him. I nod back at him and move out of the way so he can start walking.
But this Draco? He was no longer the Lucius Malfoy direct copy, he wasn’t the death eater's pride and joy, no longer Voldemort's secret weapon against me. He wasn’t predictable. He wasn’t the draco I once knew, but did I ever actually know him? I couldn’t predict his next move, whether he was going to yell at me or just walk out the door.
“Didn’t settle quite right with you did it?” I simply nod and he chuckles before he continues. “It wasn’t just the stigma I was afraid of. You see, my father was not the happiest when I betrayed everything he taught me. While in the end neither of my parents genuinely supported that side, my father still held his prejudice.” Taking a moment to look at me, and then back to the sidewalk in front of us. “He was furious that I showed I didn’t agree, I suppose he would’ve rather seen me stay by him then fight for you. At least then it still seemed I believed I was better than you, but I knew as well as everyone I wasn’t.”  I cut him off.
I hope you all enjoyed it. I zoned out when typing this but I feel it's almost exactly how I was planning it to be!
“Always the oblivious one.” Smiling at me again. “I came back to try again with you if you’re willing.”
Getting dragged out of my thoughts by Ron’s continued banging, I grudgingly walked over to the door. Manually undoing the locks so I could at least try and stop them in seeing Draco. Pulling the door open just enough to see them I smiled with a fake cough, my head sticking out of the crack.
“You’ve also done that three times now.”  He said as he walked over to me, snatching the blanket out of my hand. Then lazily throwing it on the armrest so it looked like a bunched up mess. He smirked at me while taking a drink right after, watching me reach to fix the blanket.
Thank you for writing me. There was no need to apologize, work gets the best of us. Your owl didn’t quite come at the best time but no harm there, honestly, you might find it quite hilarious. He’s currently sleeping inside the bag of owl treats and I’m planning on leaving him there til morning.
Dracos laughter at some joke on the screen was the last thing I heard before I let sleep overcome me.
Sighing I put it back down where it was. Moving over to the blanket on the back of the couch and reaching to refold.
His hands had a tight hold on the flowers previously shoved into my face, fingers rhythmically tapping against the tightly packed stems. Looking at them closer I could see they were roses, some in the bold red you normally see on the muggle romance holiday, while others held the green that Draco himself dawned every day back at school. They were seemingly placed together carefully, almost showing a pattern within the petals.
“Ignore me, continue” His laugh rings out as I roughly push the chair out of my way without remembering he was watching.
“You don’t get it alright” I angrily whispered  back to him. Quickly I walk over to the couch, putting my head in my hands as I sit down. Trying to take deep breaths as I can hear Ron coming back over my way.
Sitting there for a moment, I reread the short yet somehow mesmerizing letter multiple times. Was it over some imaginary line, I don’t really think there is a line, not that I’ve put anyway. I never knew what would come out of any of this and I still don’t.
“Have you lost your mind?” Neville laughed so loud that it caused the birds walking along with us to fly away. His head thrown back and his hand residing on his chest. Harshly, I pushed his shoulder in an attempt to get him to stop. Shortly after that he started to calm down.
Very slowly I reached out to grab them, our hands just slightly brushing beside one another before he quickly pulled his hands away. Running them through his hair once again before putting them by his sides. The rings on his right shining bright as my porch light reflect off of them just right.
Getting back to what Draco said, that part still freaks me out. What do I want to know? What did I actually think I would gain from this? “I know you said you left because of the stigma around your family, but why did that scare you?” He looks at me startled, like that wasn’t the question he expected me to ask.
He chuckled, again acting as if this is just old friends reconnecting. “People here were far too afraid of the Malfoy name so soon.” Looking at me almost making sure I was listening, he continued. “Mother and Father wanted to stay here, so of course that meant I had to go, for their sake and mine truly. Staying would’ve meant their faults being my downfall, I needed to leave so I could make something of myself and prove too, well, myself that I wasn’t like any of them in the end.”
The crazy amount of cleaning I did, that I didn’t even do when I held the ministry party here last year for the minister himself.  How I dug in my closet for an hour, throwing on every single dress shirt Luna helped me buy over the years, before deciding on the tight fitting black one.  Buying that insanely expensive shampoo that Seamus had been recommending for the past year after I’d gotten Dracos reply. Hell, even the fact that I call him Draco in my head now should’ve  been a goddamn clue. Or the fact that I read it over a hundred times before putting it down, reading the line ‘Dearest Harry’ over and over.
“Easy.” The words were barely audible through his laugh. I shoot him a glare and he sarcastically throws his hands in the air. “Basically the smaller one didn’t think she needed flowers, while the taller one disagreed, obviously wanting to buy her the flowers. Went on practically the entire time I was there, swear the shorter of the two was planning on hexing her partner by the end of it. The shopkeep told me they were friends of hers, so the flowers were being bought regardless.”
As not to ruin this closeness, I spell the movie out and replace it with a random one Neville had lent me when I flooed him in a panic the night before. He’d laughed at me while handing me a box of the things and saying “Any of them will be fine, nothing too over the top”
“Better than, truly.” Smiling at his phone, he shut it off and put it back in his coat pocket. “We tend to just hang out and watch movies, the trick is to pick one that isn’t too interesting. So if you want to talk through it you can and you won’t miss anything, and if you don’t you actually watch it.” He skipped over a crack as he said so, his face showed knowing glee.
“I’m just saying, everythings a possibility.” His voice cracked with laughter as he said so, quick breaths coming through his nose. He put his hand on my own shoulder this time, shoving me but not as harsh as I did to him. “But hey, if you just wanna have a nice, friendly, night with him, just watch a movie.” Friendly was emphasized. All they do is mock me, every single one of my friends, mock me, for no reason.
“Pretty sure I didn’t do anything to bring you back Malfoy” Realizing just after it came out that it made me sound as if I didn’t want him back. Wait, do I actually want him back here?
“I’m just going to go up to a bookstore right round the corner then head home, I can manage on my own. Anyway you need to get back before Granger sends the entire ministry after the precious chosen one.” The wind starts picking up again and his hair starts going everywhere. From where it was softly laying on his shoulders, it is now blowing wildly behind him.
There will be a part 2 to this I promise!! I'm going to write it over the course of a few days so I can get my best ideas and input from my friend who writes much more often.
“Wait!” I call out after him jogging to catch up with him. “Do you need me to walk you somewhere so you can get home?”
I hope you all liked this! I'll post part 2 soon.  This was my longest chapter and I hope I can get more with this length.
So now it was just Ron and I, and due to the fact he’d obviously ate a whole bowl of candy I figured he wasn’t leaving any time soon.
As he still remained shocked I made my way to the television and put in a random disk I didn’t even bother looking at. Quickly it started showing up on the screen so I walked over to the couch, taking my spot I had the previous time.
Luna had shown up late, mumbling something about her earrings not wanting to work, still haven’t got the slightest clue what she meant by that seeing as she was wearing earrings. She’d brought Ginny with her, who was also mumbling about quidditch. The both of them and their constant mumbling, if you;d ask them to elaborate they’d act as if they didn’t say anything. They had taken up comfort on the stairs, then the floor, then the guest room, and quite honestly the farthest they could get from the twins that my house would allow. Over the years Ginny slowly started getting annoyed by their pranks, preferring to be able to ride her broom during practice than have it explode ink into her face the moment she got off the ground. I believe she regrets telling them that she’d test some of their products, none of them specified when and where. Half way through the night Luna had fallen asleep on Ginny so Hermione had to help keep the twins away, one of the few things she can’t really do.
“I said I don’t know Ron!” I scream back at him, my hand whipping around and knocking the small glass onto the floor as I try to face him. The shattering echoing as Ron looks at me, completely stunned. Only my breathing and the slight dripping of my drink off the counter could be heard.
“Did you want to do something else?” He shook his head no as he looked back at me. As he did his chest began to rise slower, hands unclenching, muttering something as he crossed his legs. “Sorry I didn’t hear that.”
The volume on my television was barely covering the claps of thunder that seemed to occur every few minutes. At one point I can hardly remember I stopped trying to out sound it or whatever you want to call it and just laid on the couch, turning the television off and throwing a pillow over my head in hopes of possibly tuning it out at one point in the near future.
“I hate to leave, but I’ve got to go. She invited me to a muggle movie and I don’t want to be late.” So the movie probably started in three hours then.
Not knowing what to do I put my hand on his shoulder. I could feel his breathing quicken and how he was shaking. All I could hear was him mumbling nonsense over and over again, as if reminding himself of something. I’d never thought I’d see him like this. Somehow this was different from that one day in the bathroom. Admittedly I was angry, I couldn’t think straight and I only really saw rage. That was the closest I’ve gotten to seeing him vulnerable like this. I’d wished for so long that I would’ve done something different.
“Everyone has someone they want to be like when they’re a child.” I remind him, personally I didn’t have one. The dursleys never really gave me a good thing to imitate, but Ron told me it was true. He wanted to be like Bill, Ginny wanted to be like the twins ect. Apparently this was the norm in most families, I just never really understood it.
“Believe it or not Potter, you.” That smile, something I never thought him to be capable of. Never really thought him to be capable of anything besides mocking or fear. But that smile, it’s almost memorizing, just barely making his eyes do that wrinkle thing everyone says means it's genuine. It’s just shy of perfect.
“It looks beautiful doesn’t it” Draco spoke out of the blue, his eyes were blown wide and focused on the night sky on the screen.
“Well this little guy.” Reaching up to scratch the top of the owls head. “He had a broken wing when she got him, broke it as a baby, spent 2 years in the shop before she got him, said he’d been hidden in the back of the place. Funny thing is, she doesn’t even like owls” The owl chirped as Draco was talking, practically shoving himself into his hand. “Not to mention she has shelves full of damaged or once alone trinkets and stuffed animals she’d find at stores.” Walking the owl back over to the perch and setting him down he spoke. “And me of course, don’t know how she realized it before me, but that's the past right?”
Hermione on the other hand was skeptical. It was more expected, I think out of everyone she has the most reason to not trust him. She even tried to convince me to let her and Ron come with us as a “safety net”, which sounded like another insult to my abilities, to be honest.  Ron shut that down very quickly, saying that I can handle things on my own. I had to go on promising her that if he tried anything I’d get out of there as soon as possible.
