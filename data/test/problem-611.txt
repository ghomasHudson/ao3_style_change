“Harry, we’re ready to go,” says Chloe, suddenly appearing at the door and looking sheepish. “We’re going to a pub in Diagon Alley. You should come with us. I’d like you to...”
He loves their home, a little house on the beach, not far from the university campus.
He wants to spend his evenings curled up on the sofa, trying to make sense of what’s happening on Italian Muggle television. He wants to make love with Draco, whispering that he loves him beyond words. He craves the mundanity of routine, of going to the market every Wednesday and Saturday morning to buy fresh fruit and vegetables. Of learning Italian and feeling little by little that he belongs here. He wants to have a baby with Draco. To have a place to call home with him here.
“Let’s sit on the bed,” Harry says, moving first, before he loses his nerve. Draco casts a locking charm on the door and then follows him. When he moves the bed curtains a bit, he notices it.
that Harry deflects with a mild
Harry notices George playing with his food throughout the meal, his fork pushing a carrot around the edge of the plate, his eyes empty.
He eventually took Draco’s jumper off and started kissing his neck, muttering that Draco smelled so nice and that it was making him light-headed. And then he moved back to Draco’s lips, drunk on him.
“Sleep,” he whispers. “It’s early.”
“Fuck, Draco…”
“Draco, I know you well enough to figure out that something is wrong,” he says. “Now, it’s Friday afternoon and you can tell me immediately or you can spend the weekend brooding like a moron and tell me on Monday morning. But I will send you at least a couple of owls to ask you how you’re feeling in the meantime and we both know you hate that.”
“Here, have some of these,” Draco says awkwardly, offering him the biscuits, then he sits on the sofa next to Potter, trying not to touch him.
They have breakfast and then exchange presents under the Christmas tree in the parlour. Harry feels ridiculously anxious about his, but also curious about the present that emerges from under the tree for him.
and having a crush on him. Does that mean that Draco wants to be kissed?
Harry goes back to his room and rummages through his wardrobe, letting out a small victorious
“Welcome all to your first DADA lesson of the year,” Professor Marelli announces with a bright smile. “I know you’ve been through a lot more than the average student of your age. Some of you have actually fought in a war. You will probably already know some of the things I will teach you this term.”
that makes goosebumps ripple on Harry’s skin. So he starts moving into the tight heat, holding Draco by his hips, fingers digging into the pale soft flesh as Harry desperately tries not to lose control. But it’s too much, and Draco feels so good and lovely under him, making those noises that should be illegal, meeting Harry’s thrusts with the rocking of his hips and moaning Harry’s name.
“What if someone sees me?” Draco argues weakly, turning to face Harry, running his fingers along his side, tracing the curve of Harry’s hips.
“Draco…” Harry whimpers as he slides inside in one delicious slow push, “god, you’re so tight.”
“Fuck, Draco,
He tried to keep to himself during the ride to the castle and then McGonagall was there, asking everyone to line up and telling the eighth year students to enter the Great Hall for last. And he was standing there, looking at the familiar faces, seeing hatred on most of them, as Potter chatted to Longbottom and Abbott, until the doors opened for them and he felt like a cold shower washing over his back.
“Nah, don’t worry. Draco is as emotionally constipated as Ron, so it might take him a while to figure it out,” Hermione says.
“I…I can’t…” Malfoy says, fingers trembling, scratching the scar on his neck.
Hermione makes them all consider whether to change their timetables at lunch, but Harry’s happy with the fact that his appears to match Draco’s.
When he goes down for breakfast, he tries to ignore Zabini’s knowing smirk, Parkinson’s gasp and the way she looks at Draco, who is busy pretending to read the morning paper, purposely ignoring everyone. Harry’s feet move under the table and press against his, and Draco lets his own foot stroke Harry’s calf, slowly.
He was the only student left in school and he enjoyed the peace and calm, the fact that he could go to the library whenever he wanted. He wandered around the school grounds, feeling lonely and sad. He didn’t even know if it was because of his first Christmas alone or because Harry wasn’t there with him.
“I’ll do it,” the Slytherin mutters, grabbing the packet with the fish and heading for the sink. Harry turns to look at him and notices the way his fingers are shaking, how tense his shoulders are. His breathing becomes laboured as his hands handle the fish, nearly dropping it in the sink several times.
“Circe, your hair is impossible, Harry!” she grumbles, pulling up her sleeves and cursing under her breath. “Where were you planning on taking him?”
He sits on his usual sofa in the common room and opens the box with the new letters. Draco said they were sent after both Perseus and Henry got married, after they had broken up. Some of them are obscure and hard to decipher, but others are just sad.
Harry bites his lips and sighs.
“Draco, please, let me explain,” Harry begs, hating how pitiful he sounds.
He had spent the war checking on it, every time he had a moment to himself, every time he could hide in the bathroom to cast that simple spell to make sure his bond was still pulsing, still stretching from his finger and fading into the distance, still alive.
Potter disappears with a crack, and Granger stares at him, still scowling.
“You deserve it,” Harry replies, and Draco looks at him in disbelief, but Harry smiles back at him. “You do, my love.”
“We’re all done here for today,” Auror Hopkins declares a few minutes later, as his team is ready to depart. “Harry, it’s been a pleasure working with you.”
“Oh, that’s all thanks to Draco,” Zabini replies, waving a hand. “One can determine the state of Draco’s mental health by how clean and tidy our room is. You should have seen it in sixth year, it was sparkling. The House-Elves were so pissed off that he was stealing their jobs. They even complained to Dumbledore about it.”
“I kind of suspected that you fancied men, to be honest with you,” Ron says. “Hermione and I have been speculating for years. But I’m happy for you and you know my family’s okay with it, what with Charlie being gay. Mum’s very supportive.”
“Thank you,” Harry says, his voice small, making him feel like the love-deprived child that he no longer is.
He looks up and finds her smiling at him, a determined look on her face. As if they were about to concoct a plan to take over the Ministry. As if they were still at war.
He lets his middle finger slide inside, relishing in the way Draco’s eyelids close and his lips part on a silent gasp. Harry remembers what he liked when Draco had done that to him, and he curves his finger, observing the way blond eyebrows crease in pleasure. Harry fingers him for a little longer before adding his index, pushing inside at a maddeningly slow pace.
“I’m in love with you,” he whispers as Draco sinks into him, again and again, calling out his name against his neck, kissing him with trembling lips.
There’s not enough oxygen in the tiny cupboard.
“For fuck’s sake,” Harry mutters grimly, gently skimming the surface of Draco’s injured skin with his hands and casting a wandless spell. He’s practised on himself all afternoon, and it works. Draco breathes out in relief, and Harry heals his hands and other tiny cuts on his arms and legs. “Better?”
“Could…could I come back and take these at the end of the school year?” he asks, eyes hopeful as Harry takes his hand and kisses the palm.
Harry’s eyes lock with his, remembering Zabini saying the same thing a few months ago.
Using his magic to clean the boxes, he realises that there are words written on their sides. Once the dust lifts off in a puff of grey smoke, he can see a series of names.
“Don’t you dare,” Harry replies, and Draco chuckles, pulling him closer.
, he thinks,
He can’t stop it.
“Harry, something’s come up. Could you please meet me at home? Sorry.”
Draco’s eyes turn icy as they cut into him. Harry feels a shiver running down his spine as the blond just glares at him for a couple of minutes.
“Fuck off, Malfoy.”
“Ron’s right,” Hermione shouted from the kitchen. “You should go on a holiday. Take Draco with you.”
, thinks Draco,
“I love you,” Harry whispers, stupid with a feeling so huge that it spills from his heart. Draco climbs into his lap, his fingers cupping Harry’s cheeks.
“Just leave it with me,” he says, looking competent and so bloody sexy that Harry practically climbs onto his lap to snog him senseless.
He tells himself he just wants to apologise.
“How are you doing, Potter?” Malfoy asks after a while. “I’m awfully sorry I haven’t managed to help you yet. It’s rather busy today.”
“Fuck, so tight,” Draco moans as Harry’s walls clench around his cock during his orgasm, and then he tips over the edge too, spilling inside Harry and calling his name, over and over again.
“I would like to welcome you all back to Hogwarts,” the Headmistress started, “it fills me with joy to have you all back to complete your N.E.W.T.s and the rest of the staff is equally enthusiastic about your return. Now, I know some of you have completed part of your seventh year and might just need to fill the gaps in your knowledge.”
Harry gasps and clutches the letter in his fingers.
“Spice things up…” Harry mutters and he can’t keep his eyes off Malfoy and his Knight in Shining Armour outfit, watching as he turns his head and his white-blond hair shimmers as if he were moving in slow motion.
“It’s fine. I hope he doesn’t give you too much grief about it and he doesn’t manage to change your mind.”
“Are you sure?” Draco asks, his eyes looking worried. Harry kisses his creased brows, then smooths them with his fingers, smiling at him.
She looks like a pale reflection of the woman Harry has seen in the photos at the Manor.
“Hm?” Weasley replies, his freckled face scrunched up in concentration as he stares at the chess pieces. “What for?”
“I’m sorry,” Harry mutters, thinking that Draco will get mad, but the blond grabs the front of his robes and pulls him for a bruising kiss instead. This time it feels more like the kind of kiss he would have expected from them, all heat and hands, claiming, touching, grabbing. Draco ends up sitting on Harry’s lap, forgetting all about the invisibility cloak and rutting against him as Harry moans helplessly into his mouth.
“We can always find a way to hang out tomorrow evening,” Harry says, moving one step closer and standing right in front of Draco. “I still have my invisibility cloak.”
“God,” Harry murmurs when they part for air. “I never thought…”
“Fuck,” Harry bites back a groan, his fingers skimming over the already tented fabric of his boxers, he keeps his eyes on the parchment and strokes a little harder, trying to imagine Draco doing the same.
“Lunch is ready!” Molly calls from the kitchen and they join the rest of the Weasley clan. Ginny’s not there, and Harry thinks it’s probably for the best. He still feels a bit awkward around her, even though they decided to stay friends.
“Potter, that’s the most hilarious present I have ever received,” he exclaims amidst fits of laughter that leave him heaving. “Thank you so much, honestly.”
“I’ve never had curried lamb before,” Malfoy replies, taking a seat on his sofa and crossing his legs. “As long as you sort out the meat.”
Harry is mesmerised.
Malfoy sighs and shakes his head, opening a book and starting to read. Harry thinks about Malfoy’s words, about the idea that he’s settling for the scraps, but it’s all just alien to him. Fancy clothes don’t really matter—he will grow out of them anyway. And the house, well, it used to belong to Sirius; he left it to Harry, so it means a lot. It’s not just a house. It’s the only thing left of his godfather, and it means more than an empty coffin.
The Minister stands there, his eyebrows knitted in silent disappointment and concern as he stares at Harry. Then he lets out a deep breath, and he shakes his head slowly.
He saw Potter standing up and marching towards the teachers’ table, a frown on his face as he talked animatedly with the Headmaster and she gently took his elbow and escorted him out.
Harry loves their life here. He loves the fact that no one knows who they are, that they can simply be Harry and Draco, instead of the Saviour and the Death Eater.
“Sorry, but I promised Malfoy I would help him with a difficult volume on cooking spells this evening,” Harry says, and he finds the other Aurors suddenly staring at him.
He kept on wearing black at the weekends, while Potter eyed him curiously, on his way to Hogsmeade to meet up with Weasley (always “Ron”, never “Ginny”, he couldn’t help but notice). And he tried his best not to get too used to Potter’s touch, to the way his fingers lingered on Draco’s when he was passing him something or to the way he looked when he was asleep, both of their curtains always open in the morning, in spite of Draco’s attempts to close them before going to sleep.
“Leaving you here over Christmas.” That was not the reply he was expecting. He wanted to tell Harry not to be a sentimental sap, that he was eighteen and he was fine. But he felt a lump in his throat instead, and he nodded, tears threatening to fall down his cheeks, as Harry put his arms around him and gently kissed the corner of his mouth.
“Come here,” Harry says, desperate to kiss Draco, to see him, knowing that the blonde doesn’t feel good enough for him, stupidly. Draco has written it down in countless letters, but never said the words out loud. He doesn’t think he deserves Harry, after what he’s done to him, after fighting on the wrong side.
Malfoy is so close that Harry can smell him, his cologne and his citrusy hair and a scent that is probably simply Malfoy’s clean skin, but that sets Harry’s senses alight. He can feel Malfoy’s warm soft breath tickling his face and his white hair caressing Harry’s cheek. Harry’s suddenly filled with the need to reach up and bring their lips together, to tangle his fingers in the white-blond hair to pull him down, to taste Malfoy and fill his lungs with his smell. Harry’s cock suddenly reacts, and it hardens against Malfoy’s thigh, making him feel like a complete idiot, wishing it would just go down, stay fucking down. He can never get it up, so why now?
But as soon as he leaves the Potions Lab, there’s a group of four girls, all holding out thick envelopes that smell disgustingly sweet, eyes bright and nervous smiles.
“What?” Draco asks in disbelief. “Since when?”
September rolled into October and Draco found himself wondering when Potter had become “Harry” in his head. When the scrawny little git had become a taciturn young man, his green eyes darker than they were before the war. He thought about all those months without seeing him, after spending six years constantly looking at him, studying his every move and learning to decipher every single expression on Potter’s face. After months spent wondering where he was, if he was going to save them all from the abomination that had occupied his house and terrified him, he had finally caught a glimpse of Potter’s disfigured face at the Manor and he had recognised him immediately (how could he not have?). And then in the final battle, Potter was a wreck, all skin and bones, long hair and a stubble, a manic look on his face when he finally defeated the Dark Lord.
“You should probably go home,” Draco suddenly says, avoiding his eyes. Harry falters and stares at his hunched figure. “Robards said they will collect me in the morning, but I don’t know at what time they will be here, and I don’t fancy getting caught in bed with you.”
So they ended up in the Lake District, since neither of them had ever been there. It was spring, and it was lovely, and Harry felt his heart beating a little faster than usual, watching Draco check the map, biting on his bottom lip. Draco was wearing Muggle clothes and looking absolutely stunning in his blue jumper and tight jeans. Harry remembers thinking that he was so lucky to have found Draco again, after all the bad blood between them, to have a chance to start all over again. A chance to fall in love for the first time. “I think we should go that way,” Draco said, pointing at a narrow path and a lonely sheep towards the left.
“Yes, of course,” Draco nods, looking desperate, “but are you sure?”
“Shit, Draco,” he gasps when Draco starts pumping his dick again, lost in the feeling of having Draco all around him, his mouth sucking on his neck and making Harry moan.
“Wow,” Harry whispers in awe, bringing it closer to his face to observe it. That’s when he realises that the wizard has blond hair and grey eyes. He’s a miniature Draco Malfoy.
“I know,” Draco whispers, his fingers finding Harry’s cheek, pulling him down for a kiss while Harry is still inside of him. They try to catch their breath as they kiss languidly, and Harry doesn’t want to let go, but he knows it will be uncomfortable for Draco. He slides out, carefully, watching the way Draco’s rim twitches, staring in awe as his come trickles out of his used hole. He places his finger there, sliding it inside once more, feeling Draco tense and then whimper as he relaxes and lets Harry touch him.
“Your face is all red,” Draco observes, tilting his head and tracing Harry’s cheek with his thumb. “Are you okay?”
Harry watches him as he walks down the path and then gets into his car. He spends the rest of the day in a daze, wondering why on earth his wolf feels more restless than usual.
“I mean,” Ron huffs, sitting up and pulling his legs up on the sofa, “I’m not exactly happy about you and the ferret messing around. He’s an arse, and we both know it. But this seems like a genuine misunderstanding. You could explain that to him. You know—that Ginny has a boyfriend, and you’re simply friends.”
He opens the letter, his breath caught in his throat.
“This costume was definitely a brilliant idea,” Draco murmurs, catching Harry’s lower lip between his teeth and making him whimper. “I think it’s time we move on to the second part of your practice.”
August. He keeps on thinking about the fact that there are only two more Saturdays left until he has to go back to Hogwarts, and he’s spending today in Hermione’s company. It’s nice, but he wonders what Malfoy is doing. If he misses some company, since he’s all alone at the Manor.
“What happened?” Marelli asks, placing his big hand on Harry’s elbow. Harry shakes him off and tries to take a step back, but he just hits the wall.
“I should be the one thanking you,” Draco says, a loose strand of hair covering his face. Harry reaches for it with trembling fingers and tucks it behind Draco’s perfect delicate ear. It’s a simple gesture that he’s dreamed of being allowed to do for years and he smiles at the thought of finally having this moment, and then feels terrified because he knows it’s not going to last.
“What are you going to do?” Harry whispers, casting a disillusionment spell around them.
Hermione finds him an hour later, with his nose deep in an essay on reinvigorating potions.
Harry disagrees.
Harry doesn’t say anything about the fact that Draco was only allowed to bring a handful of clothes to Hogwarts and decided to take Harry’s hoodie. He feels his heart fluttering, like a restless little bird, as his eyes lock with Draco’s.
He takes his time to do it.
“We haven’t had a bad fight in ages,” Harry points out, letting his fingers run along Draco’s back, tracing lazy patterns that make the blond shiver under him.
He stood up, vanished his clothes with a painful twist of his wand, and then remained still, contemplating the damage. He had a gash along his right leg and his left knee was badly bruised.
Draco is not sure what Potter meant, but he apparates to the kitchen, grabbing a tin of chocolate biscuits he baked whilst Potter was away, to do something with his hands while he waited for his return.
He realised that he didn’t care as much as he should have. But that was the case with pretty much everything these days. With Father locked away in Azkaban, Mother under house arrest at Aunt Andromeda’s, unable to even see him before he left for his own forced year at Hogwarts. It was part of his sentence after the Trials. One year at Hogwarts and then the impossibility to leave the country for at least 5 years.
Who gives clothes to a housemate? To their former enemy?
“I thought that Auror girl who has been hitting on you for ages was asking you to go to the pub again,” Malfoy replies, looking bored.
“Dinner,” Harry mutters after what feels like an hour, Draco breathless against his lips, “we should eat something and then start again.”
This time last year he didn’t even know if he would still be
Potter blushed and shook his head.
Draco can’t help but snort at that comment.
Harry whines and strokes himself harder, coming with a gasp, white spurts covering Malfoy’s groin and the lower part of his chest, painting his scars with white sticky semen.
“Because in spite of being a disaster team,” Hermione comments, raising an eyebrow at Harry as soon as he tries to argue, “they still have the highest crime solving rate in the whole DMLE.”
“A while,” Harry replies. “At least another forty minutes.”
“Are you going to finally agree to come to the pub with us, Harry?” Chloe asks, looking cheerful and eager. Harry tries to find the umpteenth excuse and sees the other Aurors rolling their eyes behind Chloe’s back. Harry doesn’t want to make her feel rejected, but he simply has no interest in her. Not when his mind is full to the brim of images of pale skin, scars stretching on a hairless chest, pink lips open on a moan.
And then Harry moves lower, kissing the small of his back, parting Draco’s arse-cheeks and flicking his tongue over Draco’s hole.
But Draco’s been acting weird lately. Harry knows something’s on his mind. He’s so attuned to Draco’s moods that any tiny change in his usual perfect demeanour sets off alarm bells in Harry’s brain.
He wants to kiss Malfoy so badly.
“I have no home. I can’t see my parents. I can’t become a curse breaker like I’ve always wanted to and I can’t even leave the country. All my plans have gone to shit and there’s nothing I can do about it. And…” he hesitated, wondering if it was the right thing to do, if he could say it out loud for the first time, “my soulmate’s dead.”
Harry walks back home, thinking about the unexpected encounter, and then he decides to go and pay a visit to Andromeda, his old Auror habits suggesting that he needs to learn more, to investigate.
“We could all be a family again,” Ron mutters, barely hiding the desperate hope in his voice. “You could officially become my brother. It would make mum so happy, especially...especially after we lost Fred.”
“Potions essay,” Harry replies and follows Draco to a crowded sofa. There’s no space for him to sit.
“The Muggles made you cook for them when you were a child?” he spits out, venom in his voice. “What kind of abysmal bastards were they?”
When they finally get to Hogwarts, Harry is excited and anxious at the same time. He can’t wait to be there again, to feel home. He wants to see Draco and wonders if he’s already going to be there, but when they get to the castle, the blond is nowhere to be seen.
So why does his chest suddenly feel so tight?
“I’m in love with you,” Harry interrupts him. “I fucking love you so much, and I’ve never loved anyone like this in my whole life. So please don’t ever suggest that again, or I’ll have to hex you and then kiss you better.”
!” Ron casts so fast that even Marelli is still paralysed with surprise, staring at them. Hermione is completely drenched, her eyes wide and locked with Harry’s.
“I wish we could stay here forever,” he says in the dream, and Draco smiles at him.
Harry wishes Marelli would just leave them alone, but the professor leans against the wall instead and keeps on staring at them. There’s a glint in Draco’s eyes, then he looks at their teacher and asks a question Harry doesn’t understand.
He retrieves the letter, wondering what on earth Malfoy wants again.
Draco makes him turn over and Harry sinks his face into a pillow, breathing deeply as he feels the blunt tip of Draco’s cock pushing against his rim.
Harry whimpers as Voldemort stands in front of them.
He lies in bed, turning on his side, then on his back.
He liked it. Salazar, he absolutely loved it. He enjoyed every single minute spent with the Gryffindor, from the incessant teasing to the comfortable silence in the evening, his fingers lost in dark curls as he peacefully read his books on their comfy sofa.
“Of all the places you could touch,” Malfoy murmurs in a daze, but then Harry’s index moves down his nose, up to the tip, descending to press against full pouty lips. They’re so soft that Harry can’t help but wonder what it would feel like to kiss them. Malfoy’s tongue flicks out, and Harry lets out a tiny needy sound, pushing his finger inside the wet heat of Malfoy’s mouth. He closes his eyes as Malfoy sucks on his finger, making Harry moan as his tongue wraps around his digit.
They're both naked.
Shit.
He counts the days and can’t focus on anything. Draco’s reply arrives on Friday morning. He sounds confused, saying that his mother leaves at one on Saturday, but why does Harry want to know? Harry doesn’t reply and sends Argo back with a short letter saying not to lose hope.
His parents. Sirius. Dumbledore. Remus and Tonks. Fred.
And Draco, who is always so composed, won’t stop babbling and saying how amazing Harry feels, how good he is, how much he wants him. Harry feels overwhelmed by it all and turns his face to look at the blonde. Draco is so stunning, fucking him with such abandon, his cheeks pink and his bottom lip caught between his teeth. He’s staring at his own cock sliding in and out of Harry, his eyes dark with lust.
His fingers prickle, and his chest feels so tight. Breathing is suddenly harder than ever as he keeps his eyes shut, trying to push the intrusive thoughts out of his head.
“Potter, you’re falling asleep in class,” Draco hisses in his ear. “Come on.”
“I will run you a nice warm bath, love,” Draco says instead, kissing his lips tenderly. “And then we can talk, okay?”
“You’re amazing,” Harry murmurs, grabbing his own present for Draco from his trunk and following him down the stairs.
“Alright, let me help,” Parkinson says with a sigh and five minutes later Harry is sitting next to a flashy big sign.
Harry stares at the soft-looking palm and long fingers, trembling slightly under his gaze, and he takes it. A part of him wonders if his life would have been different had he shaken the Slytherin’s hand eight years before. It feels like a lifetime ago.
“To what do I owe this fancy treatment?” Harry asks, grabbing the shopping bags from Draco’s fingers and walking with him to the kitchen. He’s already (still?) wearing his pyjamas and his hair looks like the loveliest disaster and makes Draco’s heart clench in his chest.
Harry’s eyes lock with his, and he notices how Malfoy’s cheeks are pink and his lips are wet, begging to be kissed. Harry works on his trousers, lowering the zip and letting them fall to the floor, then clumsily stepping out of them, nearly tripping. His old, faded t-shirt goes next, and then he’s standing in front of Malfoy in his underwear, his hard dick tenting it visibly.
The house begins to calm, becoming lighter as the wallpaper unravels and hangs limp from the walls. The wind turns into a gentle breeze, the chandelier swaying softly as a soft humming resonates around them.
Then, on the second Saturday of November, Hermione bursts into the common room, way earlier than expected.
tasted other men’s semen. The thought fills Harry with a burning need to break something into a million pieces. But at the same time, he feels relief. Because Malfoy called him normal. Like any other bloke. Not like the Saviour, or the Boy Who Lived, or whatever new nickname the papers have come up with to refer to him.
“But you don’t even live there!” Harry points out. “You haven’t lived there since after the war. You hate that house!”
“Are you going to answer my question?” Harry insists, wanting to know if Draco is seeing anyone else.
They sit there in the darkness, and time goes by, but the silence feels comfortable as it stretches around them.
Ron’s eyebrows go up his forehead, but then he scowls.
“Wow…” the blond murmurs in awe. “I’ve never seen a set like this.”
I post my Drarry microfics
“Have you discovered something interesting?” Harry asks after a while, impatient as always.
“Sure, but I thought you were with Ron in Hogsmeade this afternoon.”
“Thanks,” Draco says, looking tired.
Draco’s eyes lock with his for a few seconds, warmer than they’ve ever been, and then he moves again. He spreads Harry’s legs carefully, kneeling between them. He conjures more lube and coats his fingers with it, taking a deep steadying breath as he circles Harry’s entrance with his middle finger, stroking him gently. It feels weird at first, but then Draco’s delicious lips kiss the tip of Harry’s cock.
“Maybe we should eat first,” Harry suggests in a strangled voice. “You must be starving.”
“He’s a little fidget,” Harry says with a grin and Narcissa just smiles, placing her other hand on him and kneeling in front of him.
“Hermione said that babies react to their parent’s touch,” Harry explains. “Apparently they recognise their blood relatives by their magic and kick a lot more.”
“We could have a look at the other stuff your Auror friends are working on,” Malfoy suggests, looking innocent but with a mischievous glint in his grey eyes.
He calls himself an idiot. He calls himself pathetic a million times.
because he can’t read the signs. “But I must warn you that I get seasick really easily.”
It's always darkest before the dawn.
“Yes, I got it this morning,” Ron replies, scratching the back of his head, “but I don’t think I’ll be going back.”
He smiled that crooked smile of his that always made Draco weak in the knees and that made him feel like he was going to die under his gaze. The Gryffindor’s hands slid under his top and then went lower, moving towards the front as he looked for permission in Draco’s grey eyes.
“Shut the blinds, will you?” came Potter’s reply. He felt like telling him to fuck off, but there wasn’t much fight left in him these days. What was the point anyway? At least he had some company, after all those months spent talking to house elves and to himself.
Harry feels a jittery mess for the whole day. He’s restless and cleans the whole house, doing the laundry, changing the bedsheets and making his room look presentable. He barely sleeps that night and then sends a Patronus to the Burrow to tell them that he’s indisposed and won’t be going. He feels bad for lying, but then Draco appears through the Floo, his eyes a silvery shine and his cheeks pink, lips plump, waiting to be kissed.
“Leave me alone!” Harry cries out, turning to look at the map.
“Partly,” Draco replies, sitting up and playing with his hair, brushing his fringe in front of his eyes. “It’s the scars, and the Mark. And more scars…It’s a bit of a mess, really.”
“Is everything okay, love?” she asks gently, tugging a silver curl behind her ear.
“I can do it myself,” Draco explains, kissing Harry’s cheek sweetly. “I found the instructions on how to brew the ink for magical tattoos in one of Sirius’s books. It would be too expensive to buy, but the potion isn’t too hard, and I think I have all the ingredients that I need.”
Little by little it feels less like just a house and more like home.
The answer never came, Harry’s lips collided with his instead, dragging him to bed and undressing him with trembling fingers.
“I hurt so many people,” Malfoy replies in a thick voice. “I chose the wrong side. Fought for a maniac. I stood aside and did nothing while they were torturing and murdering innocent people. I tried to kill Dumbledore. Salazar, I tried to kill
What Hermione doesn’t know is that they also had to go home to their respective houses. And undress in front of a very large mirror. And shower. And wank, because there was no way Harry would survive an entire weekend with a Draco-induced boner. It was highly unprofessional, and Harry had ended up guiltily confessing it to Draco on Monday morning. The blonde had flushed scarlet and admitted that “masturbating is a natural bodily expression and one needs not to be ashamed”, basically implying that he had done the same. Harry was therefore forgiven, but still desperately and secretly in love with his Auror partner.
When they go back to Draco’s room to retrieve his trunk, Harry remembers that the only clothes Draco owns are just his school robes and his pyjamas. As he watches him rummage through his nearly empty trunk, Harry finds himself reaching for his hand to stop him.
He feels guilty and dirty for resorting to that, but the idea of spending two weeks with Draco at Grimmauld Place, just the two of them, sounds well worth it.
“And why would you want to do that, Mr Potter?” she asks. Harry hears Dumbledore chuckling in the background and Snape scoffing.
“I’ll need help changing all those nappies.”
want, Draco?”
He breathes deeply. In through his nose, out through his mouth, like Hermione suggested.
He opens his eyes, takes his quill and dips it in the ink pot.
“I think I’ve been cursed.”
They settle in a kind of routine. They go to work every morning, pretending that nothing has changed between them. They argue and bicker. Draco makes fun of Harry’s messy hair and uniform and Harry asks him when he’s finally going to take that stiff pole out of his posh arse. And then they go home and have sex.
“You made it more bearable,” Draco confesses, bringing their lips together again, opening his mouth so that Harry can slide his tongue in. He closes his eyes to bask in the feeling of having Draco in his arms, in his mouth, his smell familiar and intoxicating.
“Hmmm,” Draco moans after the first bite, closing his eyes. “Fuck, this is gorgeous. We need to buy more for the journey. Or you need to learn how to make them.”
on you. My reputation is already shattered. I can’t sink any lower.”
“What the fuck do you think you’re doing?” Draco shouts at him, wild with rage.
“They’re absolutely brilliant!” Draco exclaims, holding a cup closer to his smiling face.
, and by the fact that once again it feels more like an order. But he complies, showing the Slytherin how to chop vegetables and to fry them, explaining how to cook basic things like soup and rice. He feels like Malfoy takes from him what Harry is willing to give. He somehow seems to know how far he can push and pull, and Harry just goes along with it, like a fly willingly trapped in a web.
“Petunia’s made Brussel sprouts again,” Draco mutters darkly, frowning at the door. “She knows you hate them. I’m going to have to hex her.”
When Harry falls asleep, Draco thinks that he should leave, because this is not his bed. He gingerly stands up, but Harry’s needy voice calls him from the pillow.
"I changed my mind," Draco says.
“I’m rubbish at healing spells,” Draco confesses, still out of breath. There’s a pink tinge on his cheeks and he looks soft, unwound. Harry’s heart skips a beat as Draco smiles at him fondly. “Would you please cast a healing charm on yourself? I didn’t mean to hurt you; I’m so sorry…”
“I’m shit at tailoring charms,” Harry confesses, “but you can try. I know you’re much better than me at this type of magic.”
“Will you come for me, Potter?” Malfoy asks, his voice barely a whisper. “I’m so close.”
Harry laughs and pulls him into his arms, his hand cupping Draco’s cheek as they kiss. It’s cold and the wind feels like a slap on the face, but they huddle up and Draco’s lips are warm and soft, his fingers digging into the fabric of Harry’s robes, dragging him closer.
“It’s okay,” Harry lies, and then Ron appears, his face pale and furious.
“I’ve been offered a chance to go back to Hogwarts in September,” he replies stiffly. “This way they can keep an eye on me until the end of my sentence. I still need to decide what to do. It’s not like I have many options. I don’t have any money to rent a house, so I will have to accept McGonagall’s offer, I suppose.”
Draco slides out, and Harry groans because he feels a bit sore now that he’s coming down from the heights of his orgasm. Draco lies next to him, running his hand on Harry’s chest, spreading the sticky come across Harry’s skin with his fingertips.
“You can have toast with sprinkles whenever you want, love,” Draco replies, kissing his lips softly.
“If you don’t tell him soon, I’m going to,” Draco grumbles. “I won’t risk losing you, nor him,” he says pointing at the bump.
“Err…” Harry replies, heading for the dressing corner to hide his red face, “I was just helping Malfoy pack up.”
“Bloody Wizards,” she mutters, “they’re so old-fashioned and narrow-minded.”
“The ones I put there, you mean?” he says.
He wants to run.
“You say that because you don’t know Hermione,” Harry replies, putting his clothes on and wishing he could stay for longer. “She has already planned a full day of revision and homework in the library.”
He keeps on writing to Draco during the other morning lessons, but Professor McGonagall takes him aside at the end of Transfiguration, holding her hand out to him, her palm facing up.
“The midwife said it can happen,” Harry replies, sitting down on a bench and sipping on his decaffeinated tea. “It’s all because of this bloody morning sickness. And who was the wanker that called it that? It lasts through the whole day and night!”
“You’re wrong,” Draco interrupts him. “There’s nothing I’ve ever wanted more. You’re
Draco is humming something under his breath as he stirs a potion in his school cauldron, unaware of Harry’s presence. He clutches Harry’s wand with the tip of his fingers and lowers the flame, his eyes glowing bright as a smile appears on his face, stretching a scar.
“You could what?” Draco asks, his eyebrows arching in surprise.
Potter simply sat there and stared at him, unfazed, then he opened his bag and started getting food out.
“Me too, I managed to convince Mother to leave me alone with the excuse of a bug, but I doubt she will buy it for long.”
He remembers the first time he’s ended up in Harry Potter’s bed, a little over a year ago.
He feels weird after writing the letter and considers whether to bin it. He’s never opened up like this to anyone, not even Ron and Hermione. But he fastens it to Argo’s little leg and watches the owl fly away.
Molly freezes for a moment, then shakes her head.
“You might want to consider releasing an interview with one of the papers before the
“It’s alright,” Draco replies, shrugging. “I don’t mind them. Let’s go get some breakfast. I’m starving.”
“Makes sense,” Harry mutters.
It takes him hours to fall asleep, his heart a little more broken than he even thought possible.
“You deserve this and so much more, my darling,” Draco murmurs, and Harry feels like crying again. He fills his mouth with treacle tart instead, closing his eyes to enjoy it even more. When he’s done, he puts his arm around Draco’s shoulders, bringing him closer.
You can come and say hello on
When they get to the country house in Umbria, Harry tilts his head to look at it as they’re approaching it in the car. The path that leads to the house is an unpaved road with cypresses on both sides, standing tall and straight like guards.
“Yes, I…” he takes a deep breath. “I’ve been seeing someone.”
With a swift flick of his wrist, Draco removes all of Harry’s clothes, leaving him naked and at his mercy, lying under him on the bed.
“I love you,” Harry breathes out, relishing the slow drag of his cock sliding in and out of Draco. “I’m so lucky to have you.”
When they sit on the sofa, a warm cup of sweet milky chai in Harry’s hands, Draco brushes his unruly curls away from his forehead. Harry knows he’s not expecting a confession. Draco knows full well that Harry is shit with words, especially when it comes to baring his heart and talking about his feelings. So he does what he’s done a few times already in the past, when he was struggling to get the words out. He takes Draco’s hand, then his wand from the front pocket of his Muggle hoodie, placing it in his palm.
He shows Draco a memory of his very first day at primary school, the second-hand uniform dirty and too big, all the other children hand in hand with their mums or dads. Little Harry stands there alone, trying to hold back the tears, feeling lost.
“Oh, thank you,” Harry says, wishing he could stay. “I’ll write to you when I get home. See you tomorrow.”
“Bring your cloak,” Malfoy says with a sly smile as he opens the door of Study Room 3. “We can stay past curfew tomorrow. Practice makes perfect, Potter.”
He doesn’t reply, not until late in the evening, when he’s lying in bed, unable to sleep. He grabs some parchment and a quill and writes back to the Minister, saying that he wants to continue working at the Manor, sorting out the books, specifically.
“His Veela genes did not manifest,” Draco answers, “it can skip a generation or two in men. Obviously, I wasn’t that lucky...”
"This better not be for a surprise birthday party," Harry said starting to feel agitated. "I don't want one, not after what happened last year."
"That is correct," Draco lied and looked at real Harry's eyebrows furrow in confusion. He took out his wand and put it against the real Harry's chest.  "Don't think you can fool me, Nott." He saw a wand slide into Harry's pocket and moved back.
"Listen, I can explain everything," Draco said, looking up at him.
"Because, Potter," He stumbled forward. "You lied to me."
Ron was excused from retraining and thanked with the Head Auror promotion for his involvement in getting Nott safely locked up in Azkaban.
"Yeah," Draco smiled, rubbing the back of his neck. "I have wanted to do that for a long time."
"Thanks, guys," Harry said frowning slightly, anyone would think he didn't like the attention, Draco thought.
Harry was being pulled into the now crowded kitchen by Draco. Everyone had circled around the dining table where there were Ron Weasley on one side and Blaise Zabini on the other. Half of the room was cheering Ron, and the others were cheering Blaise.
Morty replied lolling his head back on the bed and getting comfortable.
"Fuck sake Harry," Draco exhaled, turning away from them both, his fists closed tightly.
"I am going to get this broom when I make it on the quidditch team," Teddy said excitedly, his hair turning from brown to blue.
Hermione and Ron had a baby girl named Rose, they could tell early on she was going to inherit Hermione's cleverness and Ron's bright red hair. The first time Harry and Draco had her for the night was the start of Draco asking if they would ever have one someday, to which Harry assumed they would.
"I do?"
"Hello, Pansy, I am well, thank you," He said, feeling slightly at ease with a familiar face. "Your Fiance, is doing an excellent job so far, thank you."
"From my side, it looks rather convenient for you to get your name out there a day before the announcement of the Ball being in your Manor," Harry breathed.
Draco still had his wand raised in his hand; Harry helped him lower it to the ground. "What the fuck, Draco?"
Ron moved one of his glasses forward "Check, Mate."
"No...I don't know...maybe? I have never done this before; how am I supposed to know if he is into me?" Harry asked sighing deeply.
Morty ignored him.
The table just looked at her bewildered apart from Zach who was leaning across the table to pick up her bowl. Just as he reached it the table cleared off and a new course was laid out, pork chops with applesauce, roast potatoes parsnips, sprouts, green beans and carrots appeared on their plates.
"Don't you?"  Malfoy replied as if it was a typical thing to carry a bag of gold.
"Come on, they aren't as bad as they used to be," Ron said defensively "I just wished I didn't have work or I would be in the same state as Harry."
"They don't count, and from what I have heard, not for a while."
"If it wasn't for Narcissa Malfoy," Harry repeated, turning back to Kingsley, "I might not have been able to kill Voldemort. You see, when I got hit with Voldemorts Killing Curse; we were both rendered unconscious. When we both came round, he sent Narcissa over to check that I was actually dead. Narcissa came and felt for a pulse. She then lied to Voldemort, her sister, and the Death Eaters that were there, and told them I was dead."
Draco gave Harry a scolding look. "I'm sure our guests wouldn't notice one half of the engaged couple missing," Draco said sarcastically.
"But..." Harry began.
Theodore shrunk a tiny bit, and his shoulder-length greasy black hair turned short messy and brown, his cold brown eyes turned shiny green as he was now staring back at himself. "I didn't think it would work so well," Nott admitted.
He gets up and paces around the house, feeling restless and useless, and then he decides he should just do something.
from his face and Harry inhales, admiring the lines on his pale skin, the way they make him look like a work of art.
“Sure,” Harry replies, standing up and grabbing the parcel Draco offers him. It’s a small, light thing, wrapped in green paper with little snakes wearing Christmas hats. Harry smiles as he looks at it, before putting it in his trunk with care. “Early Christmas present from Parkinson?”
“Malfoy!” Potter calls when Draco leaves the room and runs to his bedroom.
Harry swallows loudly and nods.
“This club was your idea,” she reminds him. “We’ve managed to earn over a hundred points and it’s been such hard work. And now we’re nearly back to square one. Why in Salazar’s name did you stay past curfew?”
As they lie in a tangle of limbs after they’ve both managed to catch their breath, Harry hears the soft thumping of the Boggart upstairs.
He wonders if there’s something wrong with him, searching for friendship where there’s always been hatred and animosity. A part of him wants to be careful, doesn’t trust Malfoy, thinks he’s up to something again. But he’s too tired to analyse every word and study his old enemy’s moves. He wants to let go, for once.
They feed Sirius, burp him, change his nappy, try to get him to sleep in his cot, but he normally prefers a cuddle and a nap in their arms anyway. They go out for a walk in the park, together, as a family. They try to eat a decent meal, but often fail. They barely sleep, sometimes forget to shower. But they’re so unbelievably happy and in love.
“Will you all stop talking about my boyfriend’s behind?!”
“So I’m your boyfriend, then.”
“You need to be more careful, Harry,” she admonishes him. “You’re in your mid-twenties and it’s about time you stopped being so reckless. You can’t always end up in trouble after every single mission. Last month alone you were hospitalised twice. Twice!”
“Why am I the only one who’s nearly naked?” Draco complains, raising an eyebrow. Harry kisses it, grinning like an idiot.
Harry doesn’t really know how to answer that question. He wishes he could tell his best friend that he’s just had oral sex, and that it felt amazing.
Day by day he falls in love with it.
Harry bites on his hand, trying to muffle his whimpers as Draco makes him fall apart with a swipe of his tongue, his pouty lips gently suckling on the head of his cock.
“Try not to die on me, Potter,” he comments. “I don’t fancy ending up in a cell again. I’ve had enough of it for the rest of my life, thank you very much.”
“I didn’t let Marelli heal my hands,” Draco whispers, his cheeks turning pink. “Would you do it for me?”
” he shouts, and the paper flies out of Draco’s fingers, ending up in a crumpled pile on Harry’s lap. He feels his lungs constricting, panic rising in his chest as he looks at photos. His breath gets stuck in his throat as he sees a scrawny kid, broken glasses and dirty oversized clothes. A school photo of him in year three, sporting a black eye and a broken lip. He remembers Dudley punching him and making him land in one of Petunia’s camellia bushes. He still vividly recalls how mad she got when she realised that he had ruined her precious flowers.
Harry looked serene, happy even, as they made their way to the Dungeons for double Potions. Draco was a bundle of nerves, his fingers trembling as he prepared the ingredients, casting furtive glances at their classmates, wondering if they could read on their faces what they had shared at the weekend. But nothing happened. The world seemed oblivious of the fact that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy had started something. He had no idea what, but it was definitely
“Er…” Potter replies. Always so eloquent. “I got hexed by a witch who wanted me to save her from an imaginary aggressor who turned out to be the neighbour’s cat.”
“That was…before,” he finally says. Harry doesn’t get it. Before what? He still thinks it’s better to leave it, so he asks Malfoy to chop some veg instead, and he prepares the meat.
?” Draco replies, cold and distant. “Where were
Draco’s cheeks turn red and his lips part and then close a couple of times.
On Saturday morning Hermione organises a get together with Ron at the Three Broomsticks. Neville and Hannah are there too and Seamus and Dean join them. But Harry’s distracted, he can’t focus on conversations and keeps on looking at his watch. He tries to eat lunch, but his stomach is still killing him, so he says he’s going to head back to the castle to see Madam Pomfrey.
“I’m happy to be here,” he finally says, breaking the awkward silence.
He has the parchment hidden safely in the pocket of his robes, but he doesn’t dare check it with his friends all there. He knows Hermione will know straight away that there’s something special about it.
“I had to spend a whole year without being able to use my wand as part of my sentence,” Draco reminds him, and Harry feels like shit for forgetting about it. “It’s bloody hard to move around without apparating. Malfoy Manor is in the middle of fucking nowhere!”
“Maybe it’s because you
“Yes, that’s at the opposite end of the house. We should have everything sorted by the afternoon anyway.”
And that’s when the first
“What…”
He testified in Malfoy’s and his mother’s favour, telling the Wizengamot of how they had lied to save his life in two separate occasions. Both mother and son got away with house arrests (six months for Malfoy, three for his mother). Lucius was not that lucky, but Harry believes he deserves to rot in a dirty cell for the rest of his life for what he has done.
Harry just stands there, feeling like a complete and utter idiot, wishing he could set fire to Marelli’s office. He grunts and goes for a walk, in spite of the spitting rain, just to burn off some energy and clear his head.
He wonders when Draco is going to break up with him. When he’s going to tell him that he can’t spend one minute longer with a broken thing like Harry.
,” Neville suggests, blushing. “I heard that Terry and Hannah go there every Saturday afternoon to spend some quality time together.”
“Thank you,” Harry blurts out and Draco looks at him, lifting his eyebrows.
Harry groans in reply, and he wonders if he should have stayed in bed that morning. Maybe he should have listened to Hermione’s advice. He wishes Ron were here with him, but his best friend is busy helping his parents and George cope with the loss of Fred. They need him to run the shop.
“Bloody hell, Harry!” he shouts. “What the actual fuck! We thought you had decided to leave your job or something!”
He believes it—he really does—but Draco doesn’t reply.
“I have an exciting side-project for you,” their Muggle Studies professor exclaims, clapping her hands gleefully. Parkinson and Smith roll their eyes, and Zabini groans, but Hermione looks like Christmas has come early. “I’m going to give each one of you an enchanted music box that will play a Muggle song for children.”
Comments and kudos make my day!
August doesn’t feel like a summer month, not when the sky is dark, and it’s constantly raining, the gardens of the Manor turning into a muddy mess under Harry’s trainers.
“They were presents from Mother,” Malfoy replies. “I got a set every year for my birthday. Sometimes I would receive one for Christmas, too.”
“It’s Saturday,” the blond murmurs.
“Merlin, even your dick looks beautiful,” he murmurs, licking the tip and observing Draco’s face as he gasps and his grey eyes lock with Harry’s.
And then there’s silence again.
“Yeah,” Harry replies as he averts his gaze, swallowing stones, a massive lump in his throat. “I’m fine. Coming.”
“I swear that if you hex me by accident with that crazy magic of yours, I will turn your cloak bright yellow.”
“You’re welcome,” Draco replies stiffly.
Harry opens his mouth and lets out a small gasp.
Harry grimaces and wonders how Luna can look so serene whilst talking about her imprisonment during the War.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Parkinson,” Ron mutters, and Hermione shakes her head, then sighs.
“Will you tell me what’s wrong?” she asks, snapping at him one evening.
Something bigger that has been growing inside him, like a vine that has gently wrapped around his heart, merging with it.
“Can I kiss you?” Draco asks, his lips so close that Harry can feel his breath tickling his skin. He nods, whispering another
Harry complies, a slow intake of breath from his nose, an even slower one out of his mouth.
The satisfaction rolls off Malfoy’s face like a wave. Harry thinks he looks like the cat that got the cream, raising an eyebrow with a contented smile on his stunning face.
“We’d better find an empty compartment,” she says, “and then lock ourselves in to avoid more requests for autographs.”
He’s been through a war. He’s survived worse gossip. If he wants to go on a date with a bloke, it’s really no one’s bloody business.
Harry doesn’t sleep that night. He keeps on writing messages of apology on the enchanted parchment, trying to explain what happened, but Draco never answers. Harry wonders if the blond has destroyed the parchment, the only connection between them during all the long and lonely nights apart.
“Well,” Ron sighs after a bit, “at least he’s got a nice arse, I suppose.”
“I don’t need my eyes to see how beautiful you are.”
“You never know,” Harry says, shrugging. “I’m sure they will let you keep something.”
He goes to work on Monday and Draco acts as if nothing’s happened. As if they’re not waiting to find out if he’s pregnant with Harry’s baby.
“It’s a shame they didn’t give you the Auror uniform,” Malfoy adds, eager to have the last word. “At least it would look better than your tatty t-shirt and torn jeans.”
“She still is,” Malfoy replies, his eyes finally meeting Harry’s. “How was your date with Granger?”
“Breathe, Potter,” Malfoy says, sitting up and grabbing his wand to cast cleaning charms on both of them. “You’re going to end up having a panic attack after a wank. Do you want to take a shower?”
“You’re late!” the man says, scowling at him, “I was worried sick.”
You can come and say hello on
The Slytherin uses the password to enter, and Harry follows him.
When it’s time to pack, Draco asks Harry to carry his Christmas present and the photo frames in his trunk, to avoid getting them confiscated by the Aurors, but he decides to leave the rest of his things at Grimmauld Place.
“You know you loved it,” he whispers in Draco’s ear. “You kept on asking for more.”
“It never works well with books,” he says, putting them back into his bag. “They always end up with crinkled pages and smudged ink.”
“You’re mad,” Draco whispers, looking at his left arm. Harry places his hand on it, squeezing it. “I’ve lost everything. If it weren’t for you, I would be in Azkaban.”
“Mum,” Ron protests, “leave them alone.”
Draco picks the other room on the third floor, because the house scares him and he thinks that at least Potter should come and help him if something tries to murder him during the night.
So many funerals and not a single tear.
The thought has never crossed his mind.
“Potter, there was a whole page in the Prophet about it, with witches and wizards sending their recipes to find the perfect one for you.”
“Hey, mate,” the tiny Jack Russell says, “come back to the common room, come on. We can talk.”
“Dinner,” Draco replies, realising it’s the first proper conversation they’ve had in the month they’ve spent living under the same roof. “Why? Does the Saviour not eat?”
“One finger?” he asks instead, and Draco takes a few seconds before he nods. Harry gently traces his eyebrows, the scar under his eyes, the slopes of his jaw. He lets his finger wander over soft pink lips, a delicate ear, silky hair. Draco lets him do it, closing his eyes with a sigh. His breathing slowly evens out as he falls asleep.
His blond hair is a tangled mess, and he has a spot on his chin, sleep in his eyes, but Harry has never found him more beautiful.
spell, flicking against a peaked pink nipple and along the line that cuts the areola, making Malfoy gasp. Harry does it again and again, enjoying the way Malfoy writhes underneath him, his pale fingers disappearing inside his hole and hand slowly stroking his hard cock.
“I’m calling it a night,” Ron declares, stretching his long limbs and revealing a freckled belly. He kisses Hermione on the cheek, making her automatically reach for his face, a hand stroking his chin tenderly. “I’ll see you tomorrow morning.”
The floor suddenly starts shaking, Harry’s feet trembling with the vibrations as his eyes lock with Malfoy’s.
“Mate, you might want to tone down your Malfoy obsession a little bit this year,” Ron says, pouring himself a cup of tea. “I’m not that fond of the pointy git, but it looks like he’s having a shitty time already. And I doubt he’s up to anything this year, especially with his wand blocked.”
Harry has just moved back to Grimmauld Place, after spending two months at the Burrow. Hermione’s in Australia, trying to restore her parents’ memories and the Weasleys are struggling to cope. George is a wreck; Molly and Arthur can barely function and Harry feels that they could do without someone like him intruding on their grief. Of course, Ron and his mother insisted on him staying, but he’s just broken up with Ginny and he feels like they all need some space. Besides, Ron has started helping George with the shop, and Harry doesn’t want to stay at home with Molly and his ex.
Draco laughs and then raises his grey eyes to the ceiling when there’s a loud thump.
Her eyes open wide, and a flicker of life seems to set them alight again at the mention of her son.
“Come on, Potter,” Draco says. “Show us some skin.”
“I know,” Draco murmurs, his silver eyes locking with Harry’s. “Now I know.”
“Thank god, he speaks!” Harry says, gabbing his robes and dragging him closer, “I thought you were having a stroke. Merlin, you scared me to death.”
(See the end of the chapter for
And it makes no sense. Because that’s not part of their deal. It’s just something Harry desperately needs and that Draco is willing to give him.
“Since when can you drive?” Harry asks, opening the door and peaking inside suspiciously.
“You need to leave,” Draco whispers, fastening Harry’s cloak around his neck and handing him his wand. “There’s a pub in town that has a Floo connection. If you appar-“
They all shudder at the mention of Nagini, and Neville shakes his head.
“You don’t have to…” he says, his voice cracking.
Draco’s smile makes Harry want to cry a little, because he never thought he would be allowed to feel so happy in his life. He thinks about all those evenings spent in his tiny cupboard in the dark, wondering if he would ever feel happy or loved or full. He wishes he could take a Time-Turner to hug his old self and tell him that he will be. He will feel all those things and so much more.
But Harry does worry and clings to Draco as they part in front of the floo, his hands cupping Draco’s cheeks, thumbs brushing gently the soft skin of his face.
“Not that it makes any difference,” Draco sniffs, standing up and pacing nervously around the library. “I doubt I will ever manage to earn enough money to buy it back. I hope they don’t manage to get to my secret room any time soon.”
“Oh, Harry…” he murmurs, taking a tentative step inside, then another. “You kleptomaniac…”
“Merlin, I’m fucked…” Harry sighs, looking at his Potions essay and grimacing. “It’s due on Monday and I have no clue what to write. I’m going to fail spectacularly.”
He marvels at how intimate it feels to dress Draco, possibly more than undressing him in the rush to touch him. He carefully gets each button into its eyelet, fastening robes and straightening Draco’s collar. He ties the knot of his Slytherin green tie with extra care, brows furrowed in concentration as grey eyes stare at him.
Harry’s blind and now he can’t even use his hands, completely at Draco’s mercy. And yet, he wouldn’t want it any other way. A shiver runs down his spine as he feels Draco’s smile against his skin.
“Harry, calm down,” Ron whispers in his ear, but then the Slytherins arrive. A roar welcomes Draco, who pales and looks around, confused. Harry thinks it’s all going to go to shit, that Draco will be attacked or bullied, but then McGonagall stands up and briskly walks towards Draco, gently holding his elbow as she escorts him out.
That night he dreams.
“What’s the worst thing that could happen if someone finds out about us?” Harry stupidly asks. He doesn’t want anyone to find out. He knows it would be a colossal mess. Everyone will think he’s lost it. Ron will hate him.
Harry is a soggy mess when he steps out, his clothes clinging to him. He casts several drying charms that make his hair stick out even more, and Draco finally lets out a shaky little laughter when he sees him.
“Anyway, that life debt,” Harry says, his left hand absent-mindedly tugging on his dark curls. “It’s water under the bridge.”
The tapping on the window in the middle of the night wakes him up from one of his nightmares. He’s sweaty and nauseous, so he feels grateful for a chance to open the window and think about something other than his horrendous dreams.
“Midnight snack?” Harry replies, and Zabini laughs out loud.
He feels an unexpected peace settle over his graceless heart. A sense of clarity as he puts some order to his thoughts. The need to see Draco, to be with him, is stronger than anything else, so he heads back to their common room.
The professor sliding a hand through silky hair, making Draco moan.
Parkinson runs in, tears running down her cheeks, hands covering her hair. Draco has his arm slung around her shoulders, an ugly bruise on his forehead and a cut across his nose. He’s moving his hand in an awkward way, wincing when he helps Parkinson sit down on a sofa near the fire, and Harry wonders if it’s broken. Hermione gasps as Ron sits up, mouth agape.
How odd, he thinks, to stare at two men who look like them and yet appear to be good friends, Henry’s arms wrapped around Malfoy’s shoulders as Perseus smiles at him, his eyes crinkling in amusement.
Harry thinks about them, about how hard it must have been to live through it and to be forced into an arranged marriage.
“Your potion making skills are abysmal, Potter,” Draco said, shaking his head and grabbing the onion that was thrown at him. “What are you making anyway?”
Hermione shrieks next to him, and Harry finally turns towards her, realising with horror that her hair is on fire.
“I have something for you,” he says hesitantly. “Don’t move.”
“Malfoy,” he says and he finally allows himself to properly look at him.
“Yeah,” Harry says, breathless with hope, looking at Draco and taking his hand, squeezing it when a small smile appears on the blond’s face.
“Even for me?” Harry can’t help but ask. “Marelli thinks I could become a Medi-Wizard.”
“Seamus and Dean are going to be there,” Neville adds encouragingly. “And Ginny says she might pop by.”
They face each other, Draco’s fingers buried in Harry’s messy curls, stroking them and letting them tangle around his thumb.
“What happened?” she demands, Zabini raising his head from his essay.
“Do you mind that much?” Harry asks, his fingers only inches away from the blond’s, wishing he could just reach for them, stop them from fidgeting so much.
—feels nice.”
“Please,” he begs, “I need you, Draco.”
“I’m still under
“Harry?” Hermione asks, emerging from her room, and then Parkinson steps into the common room and lets out a loud shriek.
“Sorry,” he mutters, “it’s just that…you smell really nice.”
Harry licks a long stripe from the bottom of his cock to the tip, suckling gently on the head and making Draco gasp. Then he proceeds to slowly suck Draco’s cock, at a maddening pace that makes his lover squirm and beg for more.
He knows Draco can be arrogant and petty and has been an absolute wanker to him in the past. They’ve been so horrible to each other, both of them. But Harry wants a fresh start. He thinks he deserves it and so does Draco.
“No, I haven’t,” he replied, hoping they would leave him alone, without hexing him.
“What happened to Draco?” she asks, looking around the Hall. Ron hands her a copy of the Prophet, and both Slytherins swear out loud as their eyes land on the photo.
Harry rolls his eyes and turns over, lying on his stomach as he scribbles his reply.
cooking.”
“Yes,” Draco replies, finally speaking for the first time. “I have the other one. It’s in my trunk.”
“You could simply call me Harry, you know?” he whispers. Draco buries his hands in the pockets of his robes and looks at his feet as they slow down. The Greenhouses are right in front of them, and there are still at least fifteen minutes before the beginning of the lesson.
“I don’t want to know,” Harry interrupts him. “Not from you, nor from anyone else. Only from Draco.”
“Yes, I want you…” that simple confession makes him feel ridiculously vulnerable and exposed, but then Draco sits up, covering his cock in lube and looking at him like he’s the most delicious dessert he’s ever laid eyes on.
He didn’t even know what they were to each other anymore. After Draco had purposely refused to recognise him and hand him to the Dark Lord, saving Potter’s life. After Potter had saved his life from the Fiendfyre.
“I’m going to be fine.”
“I love your letters,” Harry says, “they make me feel close to you.”
“Draco…”
“That was precisely my thought,” Kingsley mutters darkly. “The press is not going to let me live this down.”
“What is wrong with you? I was just worried because you look so upset,” Ron mutters, making Harry wonder what
“Stop hexing people who are peacefully studying!” Harry shouts angrily at the other students, making Madam Pince hiss at him in outrage.
Harry stares at him and lets a couple of seconds go by in silence.
But none of it mattered.
“Uh?” Harry asks, still confused, but he still does it. And it feels weird to have Draco’s eyes on him as he empties his bladder, but then he realises that he’s just literally been inside of him a few minutes ago, so this kind of intimacy is normal. He actually quite likes it.
There’s a moment of silence when the Medi-Witch freezes and clearly casts a glance at Draco’s left arm looking uncomfortable, but then she nods again and casts a series of spells on Harry. And then it appears, mid-air like a floating dream, a tiny foetus, all curled up like a little shrimp. Harry gasps and Draco starts crying again, then sits down on a chair and takes Harry’s hand and kisses it.
“Open your bathrobe,” Harry says, getting ready to cast a diagnostic spell he has just learnt.
“Anyway,” Draco continues, “it appears that if I haven’t produced an heir by the time I turn twenty-six, the Manor will go to Teddy Lupin.”
“Bloody hell, mate! Why did you not say anything?”
About going to bed every single night hungry and lost, an empty space in his chest, the void getting bigger and bigger as the years went by.
A moan, then a groan, and Potter’s coming too.
“Seriously Weasley? Maybe it was a little dragon,” she says, smirking at Ron, who pulls his middle finger up at her.
. A loud gasp escapes his parted lips as he paints his own belly with white streaks of come.
Malfoy’s eyes finally meet his, and Harry feels like they’re trying to burn a hole through him.
“Don’t worry,” McGonagall says, her tone calm and eyes kind. “I have a friend who is an experienced Mind-Healer. I will send her an owl straight away, and I am sure she will be happy to come to Hogwarts to offer her help.”
“Erm,” Harry mutters, terrified, “I’m sorry but I have to go through some Potions homework with Draco. I really suck at it, and I’m worried I might fail my N.E.W.T.s without some extra tuition.”
“I’ve…” Draco averts his gaze and suddenly looks sheepish, “I’ve already taken the fertility potion this morning, so it would be a waste and it’s my last dosage. I only have a couple of months left to…”
“That’s utter nonsense,” Draco mutters in between shaky sobs, somehow managing to still sound ridiculously posh. “Harry James Potter, you are out of your mind if you think even for one second that you might not be worthy of
,” the Slytherin accuses, disapproval written across his gorgeous face. “He was bleeding, and he was in pain, but he still insisted on waiting for you, Merlin knows why. But you weren’t there, so Pansy and I took him to the only person we knew would be kind enough to see past the fact that he was a Death Eater. And I’m glad we did, because Marelli was a real gentleman,” Zabini says. He glares at Harry, as if he were nothing but scum. “Unlike you, may I add.”
“Making you lose all those points,” Harry replies, “and making you feel like you had to take the blame.”
“We could go to Rome,” Draco suggests one evening, and Harry nearly drops the plate he’s drying. “You said you were desperate to see Caravaggio’s paintings, and San Pietro. I’ve been keeping you here because I needed to brew my potions, but I’ve prepared enough to last for a couple of months at least.”
“Find out, then,” he orders. Harry wonders if all the Slytherins are so bossy.
“Are you okay, mate?” Neville asks, looking concerned.
“I know you haven’t,” Draco replies, closing his book. He absentmindedly rubs Harry’s leg, making him relax and sink into the sofa. “I’ve finished my Potion Master’s apprenticeship, and my business will be set up by the end of the month. I can brew potions from anywhere, so we could travel for a bit.”
But Draco is here, and he’s placing a tender kiss on Harry’s lips in spite of his morning breath.
The midwife makes a squeaking noise and then runs out, calling for assistance.
“You’re never ugly. You’re so beautiful and graceful.”
He washes his hands too much, and tiny cuts start appearing again, so Harry brews a healing ointment for him. He gently rubs it onto his broken skin, holding his hands as if they were made of glass.
“Fuck, there,” he moans, “don’t stop, Draco, please.”
“When Father was sentenced to his life-sentence, Mother went completely catatonic,” he replies. “She wouldn’t speak. She wouldn’t eat. I struggled to get her to wash and go to the loo, Harry. One morning I was so desperate that I took her to St Mungo’s to get help, because I was on my own and had no idea what to do anymore.”
“Bollocks,” Zabini replies, giving Ron parchment and quill. “Take notes, Weasley. I’m going to give you a list of things you can still do to make Granger feel loved and appreciated on the most romantic day of the year.”
“Oh, cone, per favore,” Harry says and the woman looks a bit confused, until Harry points at the pile of cones and smiles sheepishly.
Again.
He dreams of the cupboard under the stairs, of waking up in the dark enclosed space, his heart in his throat. Before he can begin to panic, a hand squeezes his, and he realises that Draco is there, too.
“Yes, but the formal courting thingy,” Harry mutters, waving his fingers in mid-air. “I have no idea how that works and I don’t want your mum to change her mind about me.”
“Are you coming tomorrow?” the Slytherin asks nonchalantly, and Harry’s mouth opens, but no sound comes out. “It’s Saturday. I was thinking of having a lie in. Lazy morning in bed.”
“And why is that?” Harry asks, realising too late that he should have denied having any interest in Draco.
They put everything back in the basket, and Harry casts a last glance at the lake and the starry sky, wishing he could capture this moment in a vial and keep it safe forever, wanting to remember the way Draco’s palm is safely secured against his, the way his smile mirrors Harry’s.
Harry looks at the sepia photograph, his mouth opening as he finds an unexpected resemblance between his own face and Henry’s. They have the same hair and nose, he notices, and the same crooked smile. Malfoy’s great-grandfather has short pale hair and a silly moustache, but he also shares some traits with his descendant. Harry notices how good-looking he is. They’re both grinning, young and careless. He feels like he’s never really been like that.
There are wings on Draco’s back and he whines as Harry touches them with quivering fingers.
“Thank you, Professor,” Harry says, still in disbelief.
On Saturday morning Harry is a bundle of nerves. He is worried about Draco’s community service, but also about his own trip to Hogsmeade.
“Blaise is still in the library,” Draco murmurs. “We have time. Your turn now.”
He comes hard and whimpers through his orgasm, riding it out with a shuddered gasp as he fills Harry with his come.
It feels like adding insult to injury, Harry thinks, when the blond won’t even look at him.
He desperately searches for a white-blond head, and he can’t help but smile when he finds it.
Malfoy’s mouth opens and then Narcissa appears at the door behind him, an inquisitive look on her face.
“To be fair, I copied half of my essay from Ernie,” Ron confesses, which makes Hermione glare at him.
for the absolutely mind-blowing art they produced for this chapter. I had tears in my eyes when I saw it, and I still feel all emotional every time I look at it. It perfectly captures what is probably my favourite scene of the whole fic, so thank you so much for illustrating it!
“Greg, how many bloody scarves do you need to knit for us to get seventy points back?” she asks.
Once again in his life, he feels left out, useless. Voldemort is dead and no one needs him anymore. He’s finally free, but at the same time he feels like he’s lost his purpose in life. He feels trapped in his head, among bad memories and regrets. All those people he could have saved, but failed to.
“Okay,” Harry breathes out in relief, “thanks for letting me use your floo.”
“Harry…” he murmurs, his eyes shining in a way that makes Harry’s heart surge and his stomach do a backflip.
“Wondering if someone is shagging you so well that you’re walking funny,” Ron replies with a grin. “Hermione, mum wants to speak to you.”
Draco stares at her.
Harry feels a smile tugging at the corner of his lips as he stares back at her.
“Childhood memories,” Harry replies, waiting for a few moments to go by, before he adds, “My Muggle family used to make me cook for them.”
Draco would shower in the evening and Potter in the morning. On Thursday afternoons, Potter would have his weekly appointments with a Mind Healer. They always left him unsettled and grumpy, sometimes visibly upset, his magic playing up, in sync with his feelings.
“It’s not fair if it’s just me with my dick out,” Malfoy says, a sly smile on his face. “How about you show me yours, Potter?”
“Old photos and documents,” Malfoy replies. “She used to collect a lot of stuff. I wouldn’t touch them, if I were you. They might all fall down; that pile looks rather precarious.”
“Would you do it?” Harry retorts, his heart suddenly beating faster.
“You’re so good. Pulling your cock for me like that,” Malfoy whispers, his posh crispy tones inexplicably turning Harry on even more. He’s already so close to coming, even though it feels impossible. What is Malfoy doing to him? “Do you want to come on me, Potter? On my scars?”
“Well, in that case,” Narcissa says, “we’ll think about it. Won’t we, darling?”
“Oh,” Harry murmurs, feeling the tears dry up and a tentative smile curling up the corner of his mouth. “I thought he fancied you.”
Harry shakes his head but can’t find the words to express how he feels about who deserved what. They were sixteen, for god’s sake.
Just that. No excuses. No reasons.
Then he Apparates home and starts screaming.
“We could wait for your sentence to end and then go away,” Harry ventures. “We could have a cat. Just you and me, travelling.”
“What the actual fuck are you talking about?” Harry asks, fingers automatically tugging at his curls.
Additional thanks to
Harry sobs, covering his face with his hands, but Draco draws him closer, kissing the top of his head.
Draco groans, clutching his ribs, and shakes his head. Harry feels it this time, the hiss of a hex, nearly hitting them. He looks around to check who has cast it, but there are so many students all around them. And most of them are looking their way.
Marelli points his wand at Harry’s chest, reciting an incantation in what Harry assumes is Latin. A red orb appears just in front of where Harry’s heart is beating so fast that it feels like it’s about to jump out of his throat.
He wonders what’s going to happen once they’re back at Hogwarts. Where are they going to meet?
“They were going to burn everything,” Harry insists, letting Draco kiss his cheek, then the corner of his mouth. “Besides, I worked for free for the whole summer. They asked me what I wanted in return, and I didn’t say anything. But I wanted this. I wanted
Hozier, “From Eden”
“Me too,” he murmurs and then it’s skin against skin, Draco burying his cock deep inside him, his lips on Harry’s neck as he calls his name repeatedly.
“Sorry for waking you up,” Harry murmurs, and Draco’s eyes open lazily, his hand sliding down his waist, cupping his arse and staying there.
Harry takes a shower and puts his pyjamas on, then lies awake long after the others have fallen asleep, listening to the rhythmic sound of Neville’s breathing, when he suddenly remembers the enchanted parchment.
“I destroyed the parlour,” Harry replies, “but nothing expensive. Just old stuff.”
Draco groans and takes him deeper, his mouth hot and delicious and Harry moans loudly and arches his back as he comes so hard that white sparks appear under his closed eyelids and shudders shake him as his fingers tug on Draco’s hair.
He hadn’t even finished the sentence, when he felt moisture between his thighs, Harry’s cock sliding deliciously against his skin, brushing against Draco’s balls and making him shudder.
“Oh,” Harry says, checking his watch. He didn’t realise it was so late.
Draco sighs in relief.
They watch as the bird disappears, then Harry spots some mistletoe hanging from the ceiling and drags Draco under it for a heated snogging session.
“At the Burrow. I’m sure I told you about it,” Potter says, licking what’s left of his chocolate mousse off his spoon. He eyes Draco’s pot hungrily, and Draco hands it to him. “Are you sure you don’t want it? It’s delicious.”
. Wanking with his former enemy. But there was nothing. Harry checked every single paper and there was absolutely nothing. He wonders if Malfoy is still discussing the details with Skeeter; if he’s simply deciding how to torture Harry more effectively.
“You told Marelli you don’t want to be an Auror anymore,” Draco says, surveying his reaction. Harry realises that Draco was listening to their conversation, and he swallows loudly, fearing where the conversation is going.
“I’ll work with Draco,” he announces, and the Slytherins freeze, glaring at him.
What if he’s been attacked?
Draco is a bundle of nerves the day of his first exam, but Potter keeps on telling him that he will be fine, that he’s spent months studying and he’s brilliant. And Draco stares at him, wondering when things changed between them.
“That’s not what I meant.”
“I’ll save a couple of sandwiches for him, then.”
on the low table right in front of him.
“Stay,” he murmurs. “Please. For a little longer. I want to talk to you.”
“You’re doing extremely well, sweetheart,” Draco said, his cheeks colouring when he realised the word he had used and then noticing Harry’s smile.
“Where is he?” he asks for the umpteenth time, panting and groaning.
Draco doesn’t get out of his room that evening, and he skips dinner. Harry writes on his parchment, asking if he’s okay. He only gets two words as an answer.
“I didn’t have one,” he mumbles, so low that he hopes Malfoy hasn’t heard him. As soon as the words are out of his mouth, he wishes he could take them back, stuff them in a dark corner of his heart where he stores all of his childhood memories.
“Exactly because of that,” Ron replies, his face looking determined. “Things will never change unless we do something about it. We used to respect the Aurors. We wanted to be like them. And I refuse to let the Auror forces go to waste because there are a couple of wankers who are making the whole system rotten. I want to change things.”
“Shall we have an ice-cream?” Draco asks, but then his eyes open wide and his face pales as all of a sudden he’s hit by a stinging hex.
He searches for his glasses and his wand instead, wondering what time it is.
When Harry’s fingers come in contact with the blonde’s hand, it’s like he’s been struck by lightning. Draco’s fingers move and their eyes finally meet.
“Shh,” Draco whispers, pressing a hand against Harry’s chest. “Lie down and focus on breathing.”
On his own.
“Then allow me to explain,” Voldemort announced. “This is the day, Draco, that your dreams come true.” The same sickly twisted smile was still on the Dark Lord’s face as he stared at Draco, his eyes unnervingly focussed.
Draco’s trepidation at his mate’s approaching fury melted away briefly into mild amusement and a soft chuckle escaped his lips as he shook his head.
Harry’s cheeks burned and he fought the urge to fidget. “I forget sometimes.”
“Truthfully?” Potter answered quietly. “I’m worried you’ll use what I’m about to say as a means to tease me.”
Harry snorted. “I’m sure.” Grabbing his laptop he followed Hermione out of the library. He still had no patience for Malfoy’s rudeness and he wished that just once Malfoy would treat him like an equal rather than dirt.
of him. His mate was fire hot, skin burning beneath Draco’s touch as his hands swept over every inch of his skin. He allowed a hand to drop, teasing fingers gliding alluringly over Harry’s abdomen, stomach quivering from the touch, before the brunet choked a sudden gasp, Draco’s hand wrapping possessively around his hard cock.
Draco found himself frowning bemusedly. “No.”
Harry stared down at his essay with wide eyes before turning them to Hermione who was staring worriedly at her best friend.
The blond smiled and pressed a finger to the brunet’s lips before leaning down to capture them in a sweet forgiving kiss.
“You didn’t tell me either!” Harry retorted.
“…Three thirty in the morning,” Ron replied sheepishly. “I found those things that muggles call ‘movies’ and watched a couple. It was so cool though! The stuff that muggles can come up with without the use of magic is amazing—Harry! Why didn’t you tell me about this sooner?”
Clicking on the link, Draco waited patiently for the page to load, eyes scanning the small amount of information that was set on the left hand side.
They walked a few steps, Draco’s curiosity beginning to peak. He could hear nothing to give away their current surroundings, however, there was a distinct and familiar scent that tickled his nostrils. It was a soothing scent, one that he knew he was familiar with but could not quite place.
As his body began to rise and the tripping jinx removed, Draco started to count himself lucky that Professor McGonagall just happened to be near—
Ron snorted. “No, no, Perce,” he interjected, “it has to be something special. Something that will catch his interest, you know?” The candelabra suddenly gasped, a wide grin splitting his wax face. “Wait a minute!!” He turned excitedly to Harry who watched him warily. “I know just the thing!”
Harry thought blissfully, enjoying the steady pounding of the spray against his back. He tilted his head to rinse the soap from his hair and scrubbed his hands over his face, keeping it trained on the warm stream as he hand groped for his soap. When his fingers closed over the slippery brick, Harry began to rub it over his skin, his other hand following behind as it scrubbed the soapy texture into thick foam. His hand brushed carelessly over his flaccid cock, the interest in fooling around seeming nowhere in sight. He finished soaping up, standing motionless as he watched the water wash the bubbles down the drain. His mind had calmed thankfully, allowing comments to float dazedly through his head about his conversation with Parkinson. There had been something strange with some of her answers but Harry tried not to overthink them—overthinking is what caused his confusion initially.
“Maybe we could make it a regular thing.”
“I did not.” A third voice joined them and Harry and Hermione looked over to a rather dishevelled Ron.
“Roll over, love,” he managed to whisper, swallowing back a groan as his erection positively hummed with impatience in his grip.
Harry jerked, knocking over his goblet of pumpkin juice. Ron snorted with laughter as he watched his best friend pull out his wand to clear the mess, his cheeks stained with a red flush. With a grin, the red-head dropped into his seat beside Harry, snickering.
Draco sighed aloud but minimised the window. He flicked his wand to admit Pansy who entered immediately, laptop clutched to her chest.
“Stop being such a melodramatic twat,” Pansy snapped. “You honestly have no idea how Potter will react to this. Given by what Granger has told me, I’m not entirely sure that Potter hates you.”
Harry snorted with laughter. “I don’t know if that is much of a threat,” he chuckled.
?” Pansy asked, her eyes widening with each explanation.
Uncorking the vial, Draco poured some into his right hand, coating his fingers thoroughly before placing it aside and nudging one of Potter’s legs. Potter shifting his leg away silently, watching Draco’s every move.
“Maybe we can make Malfoy jealous!”
Malfoy ducked his head, words failing him momentarily. Where would he even begin? Harry had given his trust and Draco had torn straight through it, lost in the frenzy of his hunger. He could have seriously hurt the Gryffindor—
just say that,” Draco replied, glancing over his shoulder.
“No.” Pansy rolled her eyes. “He’s being such a prat.”
fancy anyone here?” Harry shot back, startling the Slytherin slightly.
But, good god,
“That was infuriating,” Draco muttered as he connected his laptop to a printer.

“Thanks, Granger, you’re a gem.”
,” he whined. “All he’s ever done for the past month or so is make you happy. ‘
“Here, Draco,” Ginny piped up, hopping over to his side of the table. “Have some tea. Mione?”
“You’ve done enough,” he uttered as the door slammed shut. “If you really want to help Harry, you’ll leave him alone. Whether you like it or not, Hermione, your actions have caused this.”
“Yes,” she murmured. “I knew.” She watched Harry storm to his feet, his face darkening when he turned to glare at her. “Harry, please, I—”
Harry thought tiredly.
“Hmm, maybe the fact that we’ve spent the last seven years loathing one another?”
” The Gryffindor gasped weakly, as Malfoy glided his tongue around the base of his erection. His hands had found one of the legs of Malfoy’s bed and were gripping it for dear life as the Slytherin demonstrated just how wonderfully his tongue was talented.
Harry grinned. “I don’t hate you either.”
The corner of Potter’s lips quirked in a half smile, his eyes warming. “I’m not interrupting am I?”
Despite knowing how much he stilled cared for the blond, how much he’d
“They’ve what?”
It was obvious Potter was still reluctant to reveal whatever it was he was hiding. Draco, however, was prepared to see if this friendship would work and that meant sharing something of his own.
Harry nodded, offering a small smile. “Yeah, I’m fine—was just looking for you.” He looked over his shoulder, unable to stop himself from speculating about Malfoy’s abrupt departure. He frowned as he turned back to his friend who was watching his curiously.
Draco laughed, feeling better than he had all afternoon. “I don’t know what I would do without you, Pansy.”
Green eyes flew open, shock evident in their depths. Harry turned to the young man kneeling on the floor before him.
The bushy-haired female blinked once more. “Harry... that’s... I didn’t know you could draw.” She watched the shy smile appear on Harry’s lips. “It’s amazing.”
alone!” Harry raged. “I’m sick and tired of this!”
“Can I put it on my Facebook?” Hermione asked.
“Thank you, Pans,” he mumbled.
, Potter. What’s your favourite?” Malfoy spoke slowly, the obvious connotation that he believed Harry to be slow dripping with each word.
“Has no fucking idea,” the other female finished, holding Granger’s gaze determinedly. “Draco apparently accosted him an evening about a week or so ago. He assumed that Potter would remember—it did not occur to him that perhaps his vampire charm would affect his potential blood-mate.”
Ron whistled in a descending tone. “Shit.”
“There will be other times,” Harry replied offhandedly. “I can’t imagine you’re jumping for joy about it.”
Turning roughly onto his side with an exasperated sigh, Harry punched his pillow in tired frustration, knowing a couple of blows wasn’t likely to fix his mental lament.
“No, no, you’re good here with us,” Hermione agreed, smiling at the confused male. Harry was too busy glancing around to see if anyone was witnessing their strange conversation. “Are we embarrassing you, Harry?”
A faint pink tinge had appeared on Malfoy’s cheeks.
“What if I’m trying to be respectful?”
Draco yawned widely as he stepped into his room. The day had been almost perfect, sitting out in the sun with his friends; what a shame it had been at school and not at the manor. It didn’t help that Potter had been sitting near them, obviously creating more drawings. Draco had been sorely tempted to find out who or what it was he was drawing, maybe even chide him a little, enough for a heating argument. They hadn’t had one for a while now, it was rather saddening.
“I will join you for breakfast,” he offered, eliciting a twittered meow from Crookshanks as his fingers scratched a particular spot on the cushion. “If you don’t mind, I would prefer to bathe beforehand though.”
The gentle murmur of voices and the crackle of flames filled the classroom. Draco found it almost effortless to prepare his potion and still pay attention to the room around him. His senses were stronger and more aware than ever, something, since this mess with Potter had begun, he was eternally thankful for. He could hear Potter’s characteristically familiar voice clearer than any of the others and he found his gaze constantly drawn to the Gryffindor who stood across the room.
“Thanks, mate,” Harry smiled. “You and Mione are the best things ever to happen to me.”
“Yeah, I know,” Harry remarked with a crooked grin. “Pretty dumb considering.”
Draco was about to step from the shadows when the Weasel returned, dropping a large book onto the table with a grimace. The blond scowled and remained where he was, eyes steadfast on the dark-haired male who was gazing at his friend with a frown.
“And what were you considering, my lord?” the blond replied, mouth slightly dry.
“Uh huh, sure, mate, whatever you say.”
Blinking blearily, Draco peered drowsily around the room, wondering if Harry was in the bathroom. The door was ajar and the room dark, indicating that the brunet had not sneaked off for an early shower.
“Snake pit it is then,” Harry grinned, downing his wine before getting to his feet. “Lead the way.”
.” She sneered at her best friend. “Draco, I love you, whether you like Potter or not. But you and him? Honestly?”
“If half of what the textbooks describe is true, my life is going to become rather interesting,” Draco commented wryly, an ironic smile quirking his lips as he followed his best friend into the classroom.
to ground him; he felt unnervingly shaken from the matron’s unexpected understanding.
“Just like you,” Harry smirked. “You guys should date, you’re so in tune.”
“I’m sure most of you will find using this new technology to be a fun and interesting experience,” Dumbledore continued. “There is much to be said for embracing new ideas; please do not fear that you will be unable to understand how a computer laptop functions. There are many students here already equipped with knowledge on how to use them and I am sure they will gladly help anyone who needs a hand.
Draco’s jaw dropped at her audacity.
Harry’s heart skipped a beat. “Um, nothing at the moment,” he replied elusively. “Just thinking of ideas, you know?”
?” Harry replied. “I don’t believe you.”
“Then why—”
A predatory smile began to spread across Draco’s face and he stepped forwards, pegging Harry with a penetrating stare. Harry backed away with a teasing grin, his heart beginning to thump. Instead of apprehension surging through him however, this time there was only bubbling exhilaration. His back bumped into the cool stone of the wall behind, eyes focussed on the blond as he stalked forwards, and he was unable to wipe the smirk from his lips as Draco’s leer focussed on his mouth.
“Hmm? Oh, up there? Nothing! Absolutely nothing worth seeing up there in the Gryffindor tower,” Ron babbled.
“Or what about the gardens? Or—or the library?”
Smiling ironically, Hermione allowed herself a brief chuckle. “I doubt any other vampires would even get the chance to come within ten feet of Harry if Malfoy is reacting the way you’re describing.” The bushy-haired female shook her head. “No, Pansy, Harry isn’t some fancy vampire cuisine.”
“Got lonely?” Potter asked with a crooked smile.
“What has you so preoccupied that you didn’t even realise I had sat down?”
Something fluttered in Harry’s chest and the words that he had originally wanted to say flew from his head. “I’ll—um—okay.” He turned away awkwardly, unaware that the blond’s gaze followed him until he’d left the common room.
“I… I took too much,” he admitted, fingers tightening their hold into the blankets once more.
Parkinson blinked. “His
“Why not?” the brunet replied.
Relief settled across Ron’s face. “That makes sense,” he grinned. “Don’t worry we’ll find you a good looking blond who’s really nice as well.”
“Okay, alright,” she began. “That sounds a little more like you. So what’s the deal then? How is this possible?”
“Are you alright?” Harry asked.
“Do his parents know?” Harry asked.
Now it was Malfoy’s time to stare.
he snickered silently.
“George,” Potter growled in warning. His green eyes were blazing again. Both doors snorted in derision.
Harry thought miserably.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’ve managed to survive quite a few Valentines without someone.”
“Indulge me, Potter,” Malfoy queried, “why were your friends so desperate to hook you up for Valentine’s?”
“I will try my hardest,” Malfoy drawled.
The magic around Harry crackled threateningly.
,” she spat, returning her attention to her own breakfast.
“Please refrain from talking to yourself whilst around me,” Snape muttered. “It is exceedingly distracting.”
Malfoy’s voice was low, husky, and definitely filled with promise. Harry shivered.
“Not yet,” Draco said aloud, moving his cursor to the reply icon. “There’s no reason to.”
“A man of fine taste,” Draco stated.
And, much to Harry Potter’s displeasure, his friends had dragged him out with one specific goal in mind.
Perhaps forging a relationship between the two of them would not be as hard as they initially considered.
.” The blond gestured towards the dungeons in an obvious indication for Harry to follow him.
“Guess it depends how personal.”
“Why would
“I’ll save those details for later,” Draco replied, dropping his books onto the desk. “In a less conspicuous atmosphere.”
A sneer curled at Nott’s lips but he remained quiet, eyes on the location where he had last seen Potter.
Harry’s face fell. “I’m sort of hoping it’s not,” he pouted.
Once the cursor was where it needed to be, Ron began carefully pressing letters and Harry left him to it to start up his own laptop. After charging it and switching it on, Harry took a glance at Ron’s screen and smiled.
“I’m only twenty-five!”
“Loud and proud!”
“That much is evident,” Pansy replied snidely, coming to sit on the edge of the bed.
… the voice in his head stated.
The fire crackled merrily in the grate as Draco pushed a soft cloth through a bowl filled with hot steaming water. Hermione sat beside him, adding a touch more liquid when required, her eyes careful as she looked warily to the huddled form of the brunet curled up in a squishy armchair.
Harry shook his head and sat up, not caring that his jeans were halfway down his legs and he was still very much exposed.
Pansy smirked. “Father’s work needs him. Not that they’re terribly upset, it was only to visit relatives.” Her expression softened then. “Why don’t you stay with us?”
Draco’s face soured. “You weren’t exactly a basket of pleasantries yourself.”
Harry grinned. “I like that.”
“So what’s the point of this thing?” Ron asked, reading the statuses on Harry’s news feed.
Harry narrowed his eyes at him.
. We should make him feel welcome here.” He turned to the young man, gesturing to the table. “Come sit down.”
It was one thing to hate someone.
Eli immediately brightened.
“Me too,” Harry sniggered. “So do I look better without glasses? Tell me honestly.”
“How so?” Harry asked, coming to a halt at the edge of the lake.
“Be gentle, Harry,
Then there was Pansy, right on his heels and with a look of such determination and eerie understanding that Draco barely had time to time to construct how he was going to explain this sudden issue to his best friend before she was steering him into a deserted classroom, closing the door behind her.
Draco was surprisingly warm as he woke. There was a gentle crackle, the familiar sounds of fire caressing his ears. His eyes opened blearily, gaze landing on the large tongues of fire flickering merrily in the hearth and he stared at them in drowsy amazement.
“Hmm, some teasing probably wouldn’t hurt the bastard.”
“I don’t think drawing Malfoy in secret though is the best way to go around,” she murmured. “It’s a little creepy.”
“Come on, mate, why else would you be in here.”
Harry popped in his contact lenses, ruffled his hair to help it dry faster, and stepped into his bedroom where, thankfully, he had already lain out his clothing for the evening on the bed. Black button up, blue jeans, and black shoes. Simple but effective.
“Father?”
“If you weren’t so self-assured you would have been able to see that this was eventually going to happen,” Parkinson snapped. “How many times did I tell you?”
“I’ll be fine,” Draco replied. “It’s nothing a little Pepper Up won’t fix.”
Pansy sniffed. “As if I would.” But she did not press further. “Alright, fine but if something extremely juicy is revealed I want
“Stob dat,” Draco snapped. “You’re just taking too long iz all.”
… “Whatever, so I recognise he has talent, big deal.” Still, Draco felt strangely nervous as he replied to Harry’s message and he couldn’t help but glance around his room to make sure he was alone before sending it.
“The Headmaster would like to see you,” the Potions Master stated in his usual monotone. “I’m afraid your—discussion—with Miss Granger will have to be scheduled for another time.” He eyed the Gryffindor dismissively.
Hermione huffed in amusement. “There’s a little more to becoming a vampire than just exchanging blood, Harry. This bond between you and Draco is entirely different and involves... a certain act. But I—I think that should be something you ask Draco when the time is right, okay?”
Reaching her best friend’s door, Pansy pushed the door open, her eyes falling onto a familiar blond head. Relief coursed through her as she shut the door, leaning against the wood as she stared through the darkness to the male sitting on the bed.
“So I’ll see you around?”
Harry was still head-over-heels for Draco Malfoy.
And did a double take.
Ron snorted. “Yeah, ‘studying’, sure.” He heaved a great sigh and dropped his quill onto his Transfiguration book. He glanced at Hermione who was scratching away fervently at a draft study timetable. “Hey, Mione, can I ask you something?”
The female simply smirked. She turned towards the door, crossing the carpet smoothly. “Things will be alright, Draco.”
, there could be more between them than he’d originally assumed.
Trekking down the staircase and through the Slytherin common room, Draco was just leaving the dungeons and advancing towards the Great Hall doors when a little fourth year Gryffindor approached him looking rather timid.
He had barely slept a wink the past two weeks. Every night had been the same; nightly visions plagued with fiery touches and whispered words. A shiver coursed through him. Memories of that night—no, wait, memories of the
“Hmm…” Madam Pomfrey tapped a finger against her lips. “And what did Professor Snape have to say?”
The brunet simply rolled his eyes in response but Weasley’s face went a wonderful shade of purple. A sadistic smile appeared on Draco’s face. Anger was good. He understood anger.
“Well, it hasn’t technically worked as of yet. It will only be a success if we go out on a date or whatever. In the meantime…” He shot Pansy a glare. “
course
His mood began to clear as he found the files he’d saved and began to print them. Being the Slytherin he was, Draco had made sure to collect evidence against Harry just in case the annoying prat decided to ignore Draco’s blackmail. At least with tangible proof he’d be literally able to wave it in Potter’s face.
The blond wasted no time in attacking that spot with his teeth and tongue, causing Harry to squirm beneath him, his back arching and muscles clenching as Malfoy teased him ruthlessly. Despite his best efforts, the brunet was unable to escape the Slytherin’s attack and was left simply moaning his name in a pleading tone.
Potter looked startled, as if the concept of a bath had become entirely foreign to him. Judging from his ragged appearance, Draco was pretty sure it had.
“And yet all this is from girl’s gossip?”
“Yeah, those are what you press to put letters on screen; it’s called typing,” Harry said. “And see that long blank button? Yeah that one, that’s the space bar. You press that when you want to put a space between words and this one here, Shift, hold that down before pressing a letter and it makes it into a capital and it also makes those little symbols available. Caps Lock permanently makes letters capitals when you press it once. Press it again to make them small.” Harry shuffled forward to point at the screen. “See that little arrow? He’s called your mouse. He’s what you use to select what you want or where you wish to type. That black square just below your keyboard? Yeah put your finger on there,
“Mmm, you need to remove these,” Malfoy purred, fingers fiddling with the button of Harry’s jeans.
“My life isn’t as glamorous as the
“Would it make you uncomfortable if I invited Draco and Granger to join us for our study session?” Pansy asked, eyeing the Gryffindor standing across from her carefully.
“You still haven’t told us how and why,” Blaise commented dryly. “Since when does a Malfoy play with muggle items?”
The Potions Master knocked and they waited for the familiar pleasant “Enter”. Pushing the door open, Severus gestured for Draco to step ahead of him. He did so, taking in the acquainted sights of Dumbledore’s office. The Headmaster sat in his usual place behind his desk, his twinkling blue eyes set on Draco with a faint smile on his lips.
“We will bide our time,” the Dark Lord continued with a sneer. He took a step away from the male to return to his seat, lowering himself smoothly, eyes on Lucius all the while. His long slender legs crossed elegantly and he snapped his fingers, a house elf popping into the room instantaneously. “There is much we will need to know. Without the full knowledge of the curse, it would be redundant to attempt to storm the castle too soon.” He sent the elf off with orders of wine, taking pleasure in the fact that it was coming from Lucius’s private stores. “Until then we will arm ourselves with knowledge and prepare for the destruction of the cursed boy who tried to defeat me.” Drawing in a breath, Voldemort sneered down at the man before him. “You are dismissed, Lucius.”
“More like I’m not completely done with you,” the blond said.
The blond cleared his throat. “My Lord, what a pleasant… surprise.” Draco forced himself not to choke on the words despite how much his anxiety spiked.
And Harry was so tired.
“Do you want to go for a skate around the perimeter?” Potter asked, flashing a smile over at Draco.
“But it’s
“Your trust in me is illuminating,” Malfoy growled, shoving his wand up his sleeve.
Harry groaned. After all, if there was any truth to his denial about his crush over Malfoy, would he really be here lying in bed at two in the morning agonising over it? He didn’t exactly lie in bed contemplating Voldemort’s next plan to the point of obsession now, did he.
The look he received in return told Draco that Pansy did not buy his response in the least. Thankfully she seemed to sense his reluctance to speak about it in the middle of class and did not press further.
“It was inevitable!” Harry persisted. “She found something of mine and I sort of had to tell her.”
Malfoy visibly shuddered. “Ugh, no way.”
I’d make it good. I’ve seen you taking other guys home and you have
after all...”
“No not yet. I figured he probably slept in or something,” Hermione replied.
Harry shifted his arm away and lifted his gaze to meet the blond’s. Malfoy was watching him carefully, as if he was worried about what he had said would upset Harry. And yet, the hint of interest in the Slytherin’s eyes was hard to miss.
“Whether I can blame it on the wine or not, I’m finding myself actually enjoying this conversation,” Malfoy smirked.
Harry thought.
“That was mess with, Potter,
“Merlin, Potter, you really need to let the past go.”
“No time like the present!” George announced pressingly.
The brunet blinked. “Malfoy.”
“My name?”
Both Ron and Hermione drew a breath. “You
Harry left his friend to face McGonagall alone, following the stragglers out of the Transfiguration classroom and into the corridor. He looked around, hoping to see Seamus, Dean, or Neville who he could walk back to Gryffindor Tower with but they all seemed to have escaped early; the corridor was empty of any Gryffindors.
! It’s probably a phase or something, it
The blond sighed.
“Except you.”
“I—um—
“Oh, wicked way most definitely,” Draco replied. “That was, of course, until Miss Parkinson decided to be so thoughtful and interrupt us.”
Draco fought hard to conceal a shiver as he returned to the bench. Good god, his cheeks felt as if they were on fire—he could only imagine how they appeared.
Pansy narrowed her eyes. “You haven’t fed in four weeks, Draco,” she argued, “unless you’ve been sneaking bites in my sleep.”
“Oh hell,” the Gryffindor muttered, pressing his hands to his face. With a surge of energy, Harry found himself on his feet, gaze focused on the direction in which Malfoy had disappeared.
Ron bit his lip. “So... you don’t like girls then?”
Harry snorted inelegantly. His quill was still poised over the parchment but no words were being written. It was hard enough ignoring Malfoy sitting so closely beside him, let alone trying to make any sort of sense in his Transfiguration assignment while the blond stared at him openly. Gritting his teeth, Harry dropping his quill to the table and reached for his ink pot, corking it and tossing it into his bag before rolling his parchment into a rough scroll.
Harry gaped at Malfoy, surprised when he felt waves of distress wash over him at the sight of the blond looking so pained. The vampire was so desperate for him… and he had
Draco stared down in growing horror at the brunet limp in his arms.
“Snape…”
“Mione?”
“No, you prat,” the red-head said. “Come on, you can trust me. I mean, it’s not like Malfoy’s initiated the bond with you yet, but it’s weird that he—”
Harry glanced across the classroom to where the blond was sitting beside Pansy. The two of them were hard at work it seemed, comparing notes on a particular essay that had probably been set over the holidays.
Draco looked away and glared as he folded his arms defensively. He was thoroughly regretting inviting Pansy to his room to discuss the Potter issue.
“What?” he asked blankly.
suspecting that this was going to happen.”
“Well,” a laughing voice remarked to his right, “that’s one way to get attention.” The bushy-brunette coughed, her eyebrows lifting in amusement as a small smile appeared on her lips.
“Doesn’t mean I’ve stopped.”
; it was definitely time to get off his butt and create his own image.
,” Harry spat.
Harry smiled wryly. “It started how you would imagine, with us arguing,” he replied. “That was, of course, until he blurted out that he loved me.”
“Who say’s I want it to?” Draco spat back.
“Yeah,” Harry mumbled.
He moved his hands to gently cup Malfoy’s jaw, fingers sliding over the warm, delicate skin as the kiss deepened. He didn’t protest when he felt Malfoy move him, their lips breaking their connection momentarily as Harry was lain back against the duvet, the blond swiftly positioning himself above and reclaiming the brunet’s mouth. Harry’s fingers delved into soft blond strands, eliciting an appreciative moan from the Slytherin who nipped at Harry’s lower lip playfully. He sucked the abused flesh, running his tongue in a soothing manner before he left Harry’s mouth altogether, Malfoy’s lips trailed bruising kisses over the brunet’s jaw and down his neck.
“Potter, I’m a vampire.”
, Harry would be able to learn to feel something aside from anger.
“I can’t promise not to laugh if he has boils though.” Ron chuckled, earning yet another glare from Hermione. “Okay, okay, I’ll leave him alone,” he finished, lifting his hands in surrender.
to. This bond is like nothing you can imagine. Harry is Draco’s
“I’m just saying,” Hermione replied with a shrug, placing the newspaper aside. “What other logical reason could there be?”
,” Ron announced. “
The brunet burst out of the old classroom in a whirl of embers and wind, his eyes glowing furiously as he stormed through the castle to the dungeons. The veins beneath his skin grew darker; the entire castle seemed to shudder from his rage.
“What the hell are those?!”
“Yes of course,” Hermione continued exasperatedly. “Why so shocked? You thought I’d hate people who are gay?”
“Well yes but it’s not really common room conversation,” Harry replied. “I promise I will tell you when we have some privacy, alright?”
“Don’t you hate me?”
Harry rubbed his eyes for the thirteenth time. Below him, the words on his essay were beginning to blur. He had known coming straight from Quidditch practice to go to the library to finish his essay was going to be a mistake but if he didn’t, he’d fall excessively behind. He had needed to finish this stupid assignment and get it out of the way in order to begin the next three that were waiting for him back in his room. There was no way he was going to let Malfoy win their bet.
I'm feeling generous so I'm going to post a few chapters ^_^ I've been swamped with exam study but I'm lucky enough to have a break at the moment so I thought it would be nice :D
“Let’s just hope Ronald never wants a Facebook,” she finally stated.
Pansy smirked. “Woe is you.”
“It’s a
Pansy grinned, stepping out of the way as Draco pulled the door to his bedroom shut.
“You haven’t started Professor Snape’s essay either,” he snorted.
“Red seems too cliché after all and you’re much too extravagant for predictability—”
The blond chuckled in his throat, pausing in his ministrations to look up the length of the male beneath him. Harry’s cheeks were flushed, eyes dark pools of arousal. Slowly,
“Then let’s not waste time talking about it,” he murmured.
Only when breathing became an issue did the two young men slowly pull apart. Hearts were beating erratically, eyes dark with glittering arousal as they stared at each other.
“It juss doesn’ make sense,” he moped, removing his cloak.
As they neared a flight of stairs, Draco jumped as something soft, squishy, and purring, wrapped itself around his ankle. Looking down, grey eyes widened at the sight of a large fluffy ginger cushion rubbing itself against his leg.
“For the sake of my sanity, Pansy, you will shut up now,” Draco grumbled.
Draco practically purred at the idea. A Quidditch robe clad Harry Potter had certainly captured Draco’s attention even before his becoming a vampire. And, if he just so happened to bump into the brunet again, Draco could see no harm in furthering the attempt to win Potter over.
Harry glowered. “I’m going to kill Ron.”
“Don’t!” Harry shouted, backing away. “Don’t you come near me, Malfoy, or I swear—”
Lucius’s body instantly lit up, his muscles twitching as a thousand tongues of fire burned him from the inside out. He barely felt his body hit the floor, his limps jerking and throat aching as he contained his screams. Stabbing him like white hot knives the curse surged through Lucius with no mercy, leaving no place untouched, no section of his body spared from the agony. The Dark Lord held him under for a full minute, his annoyance in the older Malfoy’s failure complimented by the mere fact that Draco had yet to accept his gracious offer.
Harry’s smile was a relieved one as he grinned over at the frazzled female. “Sorry,” he said genuinely. “You would have found out anyway when you follow me so be thankful I told you now.”
After Harry had finished laughing, he’d admitted a secret of his own to make the Slytherin feel a little better.
Malfoy smiled. “Still cliché but I guess it sort of fits.”
“Your
“So? Who’s room?” Hermione pressed.
The blond sighed heavily. “What do you want me to do, Pansy?” he asked resignedly.
A faint frown worried his brow and he lifted his head slightly as he focused on the intruding scraping sound. He noticed as it paused, the sound disappearing.
Harry could practically
Turning on the water, Harry waited for it to warm before stepping under the cascade, rivulets coursing down his skin. Goosebumps rose as his body accepted the heat, indulging in the relief that seemed to settle over his shoulders. He ruffled up his hair, soaking it in the stream of water before reaching for his shampoo. The soothing scent relaxed him even further, the lather thick and suds following the rivulets down his body.
Ron nodded again. “Yeah… he actually does.”
Perhaps Potter hasn’t entirely lost himself to his rage…
“Kinky,” he said.
“Where did you hear this?” Harry asked instead.
Draco snatched the bowl she offered and proceeded to do so, shooting her dark looks all the while. Pansy on the other hand, trailed her finger across the page of her textbook as she made sure when to add each element. This particular potion was tricky, a typical favourite of Snape’s.
“No, I don’t think I do, actually,” the brunet replied. He pushed away at the wrist he was holding and Eli finally took the hint, withdrawing his hand.
The walk around the grounds had been more enjoyable than Draco originally anticipated. Whether this had anything to do with Potter’s calmer nature, or perhaps it was the fact that his object friends had joined them, Draco couldn’t be sure but he was grateful all the same. His short time at Hogwarts so far had been a whirlwind of emotions and stress, and Draco was certainly ready for some form of normality.
“Call it whatever you want, Potter, I’m a male and I have needs and I
Silence filled the corridor.
“Except it can do a lot more than a wizard painting,” Harry chuckled. “Alright see here? It’s asking you to set up your account and stuff. This means you’ll have a username and a password which only you will know. This stops people from accessing your files.”
The Slytherin table was sparse of students, many of them already on their way to Hogsmeade. Draco had been poking irritably at his food for half an hour, testily ignoring the many comments from Blaise and Theo as to why he was not joining them. A scathing remark from the blond had the boys backing away in surrender, leaving Draco to his little snit with Pansy rolling her eyes at his side.
“What was the reason that this occurred?” Madam Pomfrey asked instead, her frown deepening. She watched as a pained expression crossed the young man’s face, his eyes darting towards the bed.
Draco squared his shoulders. “I appreciate your support, Headmaster,” he said politely. “And I keep my word that should there be any issues I will inform you immediately.”
Potter inclined his head in agreement, his teeth worrying his bottom lip. Draco drew in a small sharp intake of breath and turned to look elsewhere, deciding upon Ginny who was now brimming with gently streaming tea.
“He’s not well, he’s deserves some sympathy I guess.” Harry smiled crookedly. “Do you need a hand?”
For a few minutes afterwards, Draco simply stared at the empty, glistening sink. He figured he should have felt better, knowing he had done the right thing… and yet, the blond felt almost hollow…
“Did you want to take a break?” Harry asked.
Smiling patiently, Harry downed a mouthful of his obscenely fruity cocktail Charlie had insisted on getting him. “Mione, we’re in the one place where finding a ‘Mr Right’ is far and few between. Guys come here for anonymous sex and one-night stands. I should know, I’m practically a veteran.”
you had known, you wouldn’t have done it in the first place,” Pansy snapped irritably. “You better pray to whoever is listening that Potter accepts this bond. To be perfectly honest, considering your
“Because I’ll be sweaty and gross.”
Well, no one except him and his new muggle followers.
Draco shifted subtly again, allowing his sweater to rise as he raised his glass to his lips. He caught Potter’s gaze flicker once more, the bright green circles darting downwards to his exposed stomach before refocussing on the glass in his hands, fingers beginning to fiddle.
“He doesn’t look, I dunno, different to you at all?”
Pansy’s eyes narrowed. “Are you messing with me?” she asked suspiciously.
Pale hands rubbed at his face as Draco sat up, duvet pooling in his lap. Had Potter seriously taken off without so much as a goodbye or morning hand-job? Okay, well, maybe not necessarily a hand-job per say, but a
“Draco?”
“Right then!” announced George.
“Harry,
“Mione! I don’t think being an artist would be the better career option.”
“Of course,” Malfoy replied, deadpanned.
“I’ll go when I want too!” Draco huffed, glaring daggers at his half eaten breakfast.
“Yeah,” Harry sighed. “Becoming a Healer was just an idea… I’ll never have the grades to become one though.”
“I’m full of them,” the brunet sniggered.
“Er, mate?”
“Where are you going?” Hermione asked, worried.
“Well?” he growled, spying Percy instead. “Where is he?”
“Good evening, Mr Malfoy,” the Headmaster greeted with a gentle inclination of his head.
... Harry smiled softly, scrolling through Blonds-Do-It-Better’s posts. He became amazed at the way this boy posted; he wasn’t ashamed of anything, not even his sexuality. He posted whatever the hell he liked and always stood up against people’s hate comments.
“I can try but I’m not making any promises,” Harry replied, hopping onto the ice smoothly. “Getting someone into one’s bed is not my forte.”
his subconscious commented slyly.
With a startled gasp, Malfoy pulled away to stare at the brunet in surprise. “Are—are you sure?” he asked, uncertainty in his voice.
“Yeah.” Harry smirked. “So… garlic?”
, his father, oh god his father was most likely in there. Where would Draco even start? The castle was impossibly large—there was no way he would be able to locate his father without being detected.
“No,” Pansy replied simply. “My father may not have brains nor a backbone but I certainly do.”
The Slytherin visibly sighed. “Harry...” he began, stepping towards the brunet.
Despite not watching the trio make their way across the classroom, Draco could envision every motion Potter would have made in his mind’s eye: the swish of robes, the easy way the brunet would have grinned at the Weasel, the haphazard slump as Potter fell into his seat with as much enthusiasm as a dead tree branch.
The blond stood gracefully from his chair, smoothing down his robes. “Yes, Tinky, please tell the Dark Lord that I will be right down.”
“Don’t you think it might be nice to show Draco here some effort?”
“Excellent.” Dumbledore positively beamed at him. “I believe that concludes our meeting for this evening. Unless there is anything else you would like to discuss, you are free to return to your common room.”
“You want to stay in the tower?” Potter growled.
He missed Malfoy, plain and simple. He missed the blond’s quips, his defiant smile, and his uncanny ability to read Harry like an open book. Most of all however, Harry missed Draco’s touch; the familiar press of warmth that he had become accustomed to in bed.
Shaking his head, Draco glared determinedly down at the wood of his desk.
?” she asked as she looked through Harry’s blog. “You re-post heaps of his stuff.”
Harry looked up from his position on the floor. His back was pressed up against the wall, knees bent and a large book of parchment resting against his thighs. Hermione, of course, was seated at the desk a little way from him, homework spread out in front of her.
Something woke within Harry, a niggling sense of his forgotten humanity, and he rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly, forcing his anger away.
“Er…”
“Not so bad?” There was a
“Ginny hasn’t mentioned that Dean has a camera—I wonder what sort it is,” Harry pondered. “I’m thinking of getting one and putting more photos onto my Facebook, what do you reckon?”
“Is it pink? Orange? Is
“No—no, wait,
All thought ceased in Harry’s mind once Malfoy’s lips caressed his own, his eyes fluttering shut. Trembling hands came to rest on the demanding blond as Malfoy tugged Harry into his lap, the brunet moving his legs to straddle the Slytherin.
“We have to stop meeting like this, Potter.”
“Whatever you want,” Harry smiled. “It could be ‘Weasley7’ or something.”
Draco observed the brunet carefully. “May I clarify something, Potter?”
a bad thing, Harry, you are free to love and like whoever you prefer.”
The brunet smiled sheepishly; Draco’s smirk grew.
The voices grew clearer and he was able to distinguish them as Hermione and Ron’s. Blinking sleepily, Harry lifted a hand to rub at his eyes, smiling when he heard Hermione’s relieved greeting.
“To be able to fly and breathe fire… hmm this option has potential.”
Panting, Harry levelled as much of a glare down to Malfoy kneeling before him as he could muster. “Oh, shut up,” he grumbled.
Pansy couldn’t help it. She snorted. “I look forward to seeing you eat those words,” she muttered. “Draco has—he’s done something remarkably stupid, Granger.”
“So far it has been quite pleasurable,” the blond agreed. “How long do you think until we get sick of each other?”
“Even I had a bit of difficulty with that one and Harry had absolutely no idea,” Hermione grinned. “How far have you gotten?”
“And everyone would no doubt buy your work—you’re
Laughing, the brunet shook his head. “Although maybe I should start considering the face you just pulled.”
“I am. Now hurry up and kiss me.”
option, clicking on it spontaneously to add it to his own blog.
“Yeah.” Harry smiled crookedly. “Something like that.” He sipped his Firewhiskey, mulling over the questions running through his head. “So does this mean we can give the entire school a heart attack when they return?”
The brunet’s head shot up, striking green eyes locking with Draco’s who felt a strange bolt shoot through him. For a few seconds, the young men did nothing but simply stare at one another, both at a loss for words. In the darkness of the dungeons, Potter’s skin was almost glowing, and Draco couldn’t help but stare at the striking contrast of blackened veins that spread like vines beneath the skin.
“It glows,” Ron gasped gently in amazement. “I thought it would be more like a wizard painting.”
“I believe I ordered you to return no later than two days.”
“Oh yum, roast lamb!” Lindy said excitedly from beside him, startling Draco from his thoughts.
“Alright,” he said. “I’m bound to spill the beans anyway.”
Across the room, Ron cleared his throat. “So… Malfoy didn’t touch you until you said it was okay, yeah?”
,” Hermione murmured encouragingly.
“Sweet Merlin, you’re ice cold,” Draco replied, eyes full of worry. “Who did this to you?”
attempts to get to know him, Harry’s nerves were right on edge and he was definitely desperate for some form of release. At the thought of the pale-haired Slytherin, a shot of lust to shot straight through him and Harry exhaled, closing his eyes briefly. He was tired of fighting his attraction to Malfoy; maybe it wouldn’t hurt to indulge. After all, there had to be a reason for Malfoy’s sudden approach, perhaps the blond found him attractive also—
yes right
“Thank you, Harry,” he said genuinely, voice soft.
Snorting, the blond rolled his eyes. “
for Merlin sake, stuck in a bloody great castle with an unhinged male who just happened to be The-Boy-Who-Lived.
And Draco was rapidly running out of strength.
“Done,” the male hissed. He passed by Draco who dropped to his knees, the severity of what he had just promised falling like a weight on his shoulders. He felt hands grab him and he turned, staring at his father helplessly.
Draco watched the interaction with a growing sense of amazement.
“Mmm.” Weasley hummed. “If I finish this essay Hermione said she’d look over it for me while we’re at Quidditch practice.”
“I know I probably seem crazy right now…”
With three minutes to spare, Harry looked around with a faint smile.
“Usually you’d plug it in to charge but considering it runs off magic, I wonder if there is a spell or something.” Harry rummaged through Ron’s bag and pulled out a booklet. He flicked through the pages, coming across the instructions on ‘First Usage’. “Okay it says here to cast
“And on top of that you were happy to push Malfoy and me together!” Harry stared at the female, betrayal and shock evident on his face. “Oh god, Hermione… how could you do this to me?”
“Don’t
date you?”
“Oh,” was all he said. Instead, he grabbed the order from the bench, eyeing the three coffees quickly. One skim latte. One hot chocolate. And one cappuccino.
“Apparently,” Harry sulked, leaning at the wall. “Why are you out here anyway?”
“Actually,” Draco replied, folding his arms as he leant against the bench, “I gave him mine.”
Blonds-Do-It-Better but the fact that he had said
“Shut up, Pansy.”
Yes. Yes he was.
Harry shifted, his body trembling with desire as he turned over. His eyes were dark with lust, lips parted as he breathed heavily, watching Draco as the vampire knelt once more in between his parted thighs, his cock lying thick and heavy on his stomach. One of the blond’s warm hands swept lovingly up his right leg, thumb brushing over the lingering bite mark on his inner thigh. Harry’s eyes rolled back as he moaned, legs spreading even further apart. With a gentle caress, Draco encouraged his lover to lift his legs and directed them around his waist. Draco swallowed in anticipation as he lined himself up with his mate, the head of his erection pushing against the loosened ring of muscle. Slowly, he inched himself forwards, surprised at how readily Harry yielded to him. But he was careful, sweet Merlin’s beard was he careful. He could feel how tight his mate still was despite being prepared so thoroughly and Draco made sure to keep track of Harry’s responses, progressing only when the brunet indicated.
Once his wand was in his hand, Harry flicked it once, eyeing the glowing numbers with little surprise. Both he and Malfoy had missed lunch—go figure. Reaching down, Harry fumbled for his jeans and wondered where on earth Malfoy had discarded his boxers.
“I’m not pestering!” Ron exclaimed. “I’m just concerned. Harry’s my best mate, excuse me for having doubts about the man we’ve had issues with since first year.”
“No.”
Ron snorted. “Hold on, allow me to contain my excitement at the fact that Malfoy was actually considerate for once.”
“Well, I was thinking that maybe you’d like to come to my place and I’ll cook us something.”
explains the crush you two had on each other during first year…”
“You alright? The potion didn’t get on you did it?”
“Oh, shut it,” the blond sniped, summoning a quill and some ink.
he thought morosely, following the familiar path to his bedroom.
The brunet stared at the blond, denial on the top of his tongue. How could he though, when even
“Oh.”
Malfoy’s sleek eyebrows rose in mild surprise. “You cook?”
With a determined nod, Ron got to his feet.
“You’re joking,” Hermione accused.
“No.” Draco shook himself slightly, turning his attention back to his potion. “No, I’ll be fine.” He was thankful when Pansy said nothing further. As much as he would appreciate her care when he had calmed down, at that moment her insistent worry was irritating him. Forcing himself to continue brewing, Draco kept his eyes on his cauldron until it was time to strain and allow the potion to cool. By the time class had ended, Draco felt unnaturally drained, body weary. He remained in his chair as the class began to file out, looking up only once as he sensed Potter getting closer. Silver eyes met with green as Potter passed by, the Gryffindor leaving the classroom with a faint frown.
be joking.”
Harry groaned as he flung himself back against his pillows. “I should have seen it coming,” he moped.
“Ronald! This is serious!” Hermione glared, hoisting her bag onto her shoulder. “Harry never misses breakfast; I’m going to go make sure he’s alright. Are you coming?”
“Sure,” the male replied, his breath finally catching up with him.
your arse?”
year!”
“I would never!” Harry huffed. “He told me so the first night we came back.”
Another whimper from Harry caused Draco’s cock to twinge again. God, he was ridiculously hard just from listening to the beautiful sounds the brunet made. Reaching down, his quickly unbuttoned his own trousers, hand diving quickly beneath his boxers to grip his own erection. He moaned around Potter’s cock, causing the brunet to jerk. Draco stroked himself with each bob of his head, taking Potter’s erection deeper each turn. The Gryffindor was emitting delicious gasps and pleading moans, his fingers tightening in Draco’s hair to the point of pain.
“This will go great with your hair,” Harry smirked, picking up the tiara and turning it so it sparkled in the candlelight.
Biting his tongue, Harry’s nostril’s flared with barely retained fury. “
Draco’s heart thumped painfully as Harry’s genuine concern washed over him like a gentle warm wave. He couldn’t help but relish in the moment, knowing that in a mere moment he would be overwhelmed by the Gryffindor’s fury.
“Ronald!” Hermione said disapprovingly, glaring at the male as she crossed her arms in annoyance.
“When are you going to give up this denial?” Pansy asked with a sigh. “It’s becoming rather tiresome.”
Draco almost moaned with relief.
Pansy gazed at him in confusion, the shock fading. “Then what…?” she began.
“You don’t think the ferret could be tricking him into anything?” Ron asked, his brow crinkling with concern.
One of Hermione’s hands flew to her mouth, her eyes widening in shock as Ron gaped.
“How’re you doing?”
Draco watched in amusement as Potter’s eyebrows rose. “You’re going to
“Nothing,” Harry replied. “I think he might want me there when he tells Pansy about us.”
“Hmm? Oh.” Harry blinked. “No reason,” he muttered, calming his motions as he continued to dish himself up some dinner. “Just a little frustrated is all…” Harry’s subconscious heartily snorted at that remark.
A sudden overwhelming urge to cuddle something overcame Harry and he pulled his pillow down vertically, hugging it tightly to his chest and wishing—not for the first time—that it was somebody else.
“You won’t know until you try,” the female replied persistently. “Ooh, looks like Charlie may have found someone.”
The smile instantly dropped from the blond’s face. “You’ll do
Hermione and Ron were both nodding vigorously behind Eli’s back, staring at Harry with identical threatening expressions. Harry suppressed a sigh.
“Eventually,” the blond replied, eyeing the brunet’s swollen lips, “at this moment however, I can’t resist how delectable you look all dishevelled.”
Harry entered Malfoy’s room feeling more resolved than ever and he smiled to himself.
Harry blinked suddenly.
“I just don’t think silly name calling or the use of ridiculous sayings is needed,” Hermione stated with a nod. “Surprisingly, Malfoy has been quite civil with me ever since McGonagall assigned us as study partners.”
Ron grinned evilly. “I can’t wait to wave this in his face.”
a soft voice within Draco’s mind murmured. He knew all too well the protection his own masks had fulfilled him in the past.
dare say that to
“Maybe you should start making them wear nametags?”
Harry nodded absentmindedly in agreement, unable to stop himself from looking over once more at the Slytherin table. A familiar dark-haired female caught his gaze, cocked an eyebrow and glanced fleetingly at the blond beside her. Harry inclined his head minutely, watching as Pansy then turned to Malfoy, asking him a question Harry couldn’t hear. He saw Malfoy nod and the two of them stood, making their way from the Great Hall.
“What do you want me to say, Pansy?” Draco sighed. “We’ve only been screwing around for two weeks.”
The Gryffindor versus Slytherin quidditch match had been the best game Harry had ever played. With his glasses no longer an issue, Harry had been free to pull as many risky turns and dives as he desired without the fear of losing them. Another matter that pleased Harry to no end was how distracted Malfoy had been during the entirety of the match. The blond had seemed no more interested in catching the snitch than he was during History of Magic. Harry was curious as to what it was that had been on Malfoy’s mind. It had almost seemed as if the Slytherin just wasn’t interested anymore.
Harry’s frown deepened and he stared at Draco warily, the worst possible scenario unexpectedly filling his head. “You’re not dying or something, are you? Is that why you decided to finally try and befriend me?” he blurted.
The blond blinked at the unexpected candour of Pansy Parkinson. The tiniest of smirks began to appear on his lips.
Chewing thoughtfully on a piece of toast, Ron frowned. “How long has it been?”
Harry’s wanton moans were going to be the death of Draco if he didn’t act. With a hurried whispered spell, his fingers became coated in cool, slippery lubricant. He lined up a single finger with his probing tongue and leisurely began to slide the digit into his lover, preparing him carefully. It didn’t take long before Harry was begging for more, his gasps and pleads fuelling Draco’s passion, and he added a second finger, removing his tongue so he was able to scissor them, stretching Harry properly. By the time Draco had three fingers inside of his mate, Harry was a panting, quivering mess and Draco was no better. He repeated the spell, this time coating his own cock.
Up ahead, Harry could see a figure with shining blond hair flying elegantly over the pitch. The full moon provided enough light for Harry to see Malfoy clearly and as he neared, he was exceedingly careful as he vanished his footsteps so the blond would not notice the sudden disappearance.
“How’s so?”
“Are you
“Excellent, I plan to have you for a while,” Draco replied, gesturing down the hallway. “Shall we?”
was why he looked so awful the next day,” she murmured, frowning at a particularly knotted floorboard. “If only I had known. I could have slipped him a blood replenishing potion.”
“I’ll—erm—see you there then,” Potter said roughly.
Safely ensconced within Harry’s room, Ron turned expectantly to his best mate, folding his arms tightly across his chest.
“Yeah but I was
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’re insatiable,” Harry chuckled, leaning down to capture Malfoy’s mouth. Warm lips met his and Harry fell right back into the comfortable rhythm the two of them had found.
“Give them here,” Pansy demanded, taking away the roots as she began to murmur under her breath. “
Harry’s head remained bowed; shoulders slumped in defeat as his arms tightened their hold around his torso. Hermione bit her lip worriedly, glancing at Ron who struggled to think of something to say.
Ron’s relief was obvious and Harry rolled his eyes, wondering when the universe had swapped his friends for morons.
“Two firewhiskeys it is then,” the dark man replied, flicking his wrist elegantly. Two tumblers landed on the wooden benchtop and skidded to a halt before them. A healthy amount of firewhiskey was poured into each.
“You’re not going to tell Potter about Draco yourself?” Pansy found herself asking.
“I don’t think you want to finish that sentence, Theodore,” a familiar voice drawled.
… Harry thought, carefully defining the blond’s light eyelashes.
“I was simply wondering if you would like me to heal the bite?” the blond asked.
Draco’s pale eyebrows rose at the suggestion. “You’re not going to Hogsmeade?” he asked, a faint smile curling at his lips.
“Nothing you need to know,” the blond replied bluntly. “Leave me to enjoy my fun won’t you?”
“I promise you can hold him after dinner if you’re a good boy.”
“The scary thing is I really do,” Harry murmured as he clicked ‘reply privately’. “God, two months ago I still wanted to kill the bastard.”
The Gryffindor willingly conceded, allowing her smirk to fall away. “I was being serious when I said do whatever makes you happy. And if Harry makes you happy, why deny yourself that?” If Granger was surprised by the revolted look Draco gave her she did not show it. Instead, she pressed on. “Regardless of your repulsion about Harry being your blood-mate, I know he could make you happy.”
Harry dropped his stare with indignant sigh. Coming to terms with his apparent crush on one Draco Malfoy was proving to be much more difficult than he realised. As much as Harry was attracted to Malfoy, he still really, really,
“Mate, come on…”
“Mione, I love you, but please remember that I’m not a homework fanatic like yourself,” Harry responded calmly, pencil moving across the parchment with ease. He glanced up again, took in the wave of Hermione’s hair and returned his gaze.
“Alright, fine.” Draco drummed his fingers on the table top, gaze falling to his laptop. “I have things to do anyway.”
His gaze tracked over the blond’s figure, his grin widening. Malfoy had proven time and time again that his tongue was exceedingly talented, bringing Harry to the brink over and over. His only concern was that he hoped he had given Malfoy just as much pleasure as the Slytherin had given him—needless to say Harry knew he had some catching up to do in the bedroom skills department.
“Harry? What’s wrong? You weren’t in class.”
“Probably didn’t want Quidditch to interfere with his work,” Hermione offered from behind the Daily Prophet. “This is, after all, our N.E.W.T year.”
“Well… what are you going to do about it then?” the brunette questioned.
“It’s not going to kill you if you miss a few minutes of class,” Ron panted, trying to keep up. “Besides, what if Harry really
Draco snorted. “My life is a complete bore, why the hell would I like it?”
“Didn’t go so well?” Draco questioned, his gaze falling to Potter’s lips. “It was Chang, wasn’t it?”
like I want to come?”
“I think there could be a better way.”
Draco felt his lips pull into a smile. “Our bet is still on however?”
“I’ve never thought of it like that before,” Malfoy admitted, gazing at Harry carefully. “It must have been a relief when Granger and Weasley supported you.”
“Er—ruined how?”
Hermione lowered her bag onto the desktop, flipped it open and removed some books. “Didn’t realise it was worth telling,” she said, smiling at the two. “Will you guys relax? I honestly didn’t bother telling you guys because I wasn’t sure myself whether or not she’d keep her word about moving on. It’s one thing to have hopes about being civil with a once enemy but it’s another to be blindsided by one.” She sat herself down into a chair and began flicking through her History of Magic textbook. “You guys will have to get over it sooner or later otherwise you’re going to be shocked every time she tries to have a word with me.”
Before long Harry was entering the dungeons, the cold air causing him to shiver. Unlike the rest of the castle, the only items offering any heat were the torches spaced equally along the corridors. Harry almost felt sorry for Malfoy and the other Slytherins until he recalled that unlike him, they probably remembered to use warming charms.
“What if Potter and his posse stay as well?” Pansy asked.
“You guys have to go already?” Hermione asked, frowning slightly as Malfoy and Pansy packed up their things.
“So, what?”
, although I can’t see why you didn’t asked Potter for his copy.”
“Careful, Granger, people might start getting worried if they hear you apologising to a snake.”
Hiding in their secluded alcove, Harry tried to keep his laughter subdued. It was one of their favourite nooks, one they saved for special encounters en route to class. “And here I was thinking we might be getting serious.” Gazing at the Slytherin with a curious smile, Harry nodded. “Alright, I’ll come after Quidditch practice.”
Harry’s smile widened; he was glad he had decided to remain behind for the holidays. Without this chance to be alone with the Slytherin, he and Harry might not have ever gotten together.
Extremely deeply.
Harry’s body flushed with heat. “Have anything planned during the day?” he asked instead, sitting up.
“Dragons,” Draco replied simply. “I adore the creatures and Charlie is the most talented dragon handler I know.”
“Until Malfoy can prove to me that he can actually care about another being I really have nothing to say to him,” Harry replied.
He rubbed a hand over his face. After his potions accident this morning Draco wasn’t really feeling up to acting social nor was he in the mood to deal with anyone who tried to tease him about it.
“Don’t like it? Go away,” Draco replied, picking his fork back up and stabbing at his food. A sudden slap to the back of his head had him dropping his utensil and turning wide eyes to the female beside him. “What was
“Maybe,” Draco replied with a ghost of a smile. He leaned down, eyes on Potter’s lips. He was glad when the brunet rose up to meet him half way; the shyness which Potter had exuded the first few times was now completely gone.
Harry blinked, staring at the large Christmas cracker the blond was waving in front of his face. He’d almost forgotten that Hogwarts went overboard with the Christmas crackers during the few days leading up to the joyous holiday. He smiled minutely. “If you insist.”
Ron’s eyes darkened. “I’m not going to be responsible for my actions if he hurts her in any way.”
“How did you find out?” Ron found himself asking. “Did he tell you?”
Pulling back, the blond smirked up at him, his hand sliding up and down Harry’s slick erection. “One would think you’ve never had a blow job before, Harry.”
Glancing at the male sitting beside her, Pansy shook her head. “I don’t believe so. She gave us her word that she would not tell a soul. If anything, we can trust in her word as a Gryffindor at any rate.”
Harry woke drowsily, mind foggy. He blinked, a frown tugging at his brow. He did not remember making it to bed last night—he must have been more beat from quidditch practice than he’d realised. Trying to collect his thoughts, Harry discovered he did not recall much after deciding to leave the library and yet… here he was. In bed.
“Yes,” Hermione replied. “And if you were to befriend him I’m positive he’d thank you for it... even if it was accidental—sort of.”
Footsteps made him look up. Potter, who had evidently caught sight on him waiting in the deserted corridor, had turned on his heel and started back down the opposite direction.
“Come join me in the booth, Potter, I’m afraid my arse cannot take such hard wood. Well, at least not in this form.”
“Yes!” Percy called, “we have exquisite tapestries—”

Ron stared at Harry for a couple of seconds before releasing a great sigh. “Well, mate, if he makes you happy then I say go for it. Be warned though, if he hurts you in
“How come you’re studying with us and not Malfoy?” Harry asked.
“Very what?”
want to be stuck in a new school with the likes of his cousin.
“In that tiara, Potter, you most definitely are,” Malfoy smiled.
It wasn’t uncommon for he and Malfoy to bump into one another during day-to-day life. After Harry had spoken on Malfoy and his mother’s behalf during the trials after the war, the two of them had decided on a tentative truce and parted ways. Ever since, whenever they were within social distance, pleasantries were exchanged and simple, meticulous conversations were sometimes had. Nothing more had happened between them, despite how much Harry secretly wished it would.
Keeping the strokes of his pencil light, Harry continued his drawing carefully, not wanting to give up the chance of having Malfoy to himself like this. The differences in Malfoy’s personality still astounded Harry; it was like having two completely different people in the same body. It was probably why Harry found it so easy to forget the annoying, rude, obnoxious Malfoy side, and enjoy the smooth, calm and laidback Draco side.
“O-Objections?” Harry frowned.
with information suitable for your classes this year.”
Draco thought, nearing the case. It stood on an awfully damaged bedside table by the very edge of the large window, spinning so painfully slowly it was hypnotizing to watch. He reached out an inquisitive hand, fingertips brushing lightly down the cold glass. He couldn’t help but notice that the wand seemed to be in disrepair; it had begun to flake, bits of wood peeling down the elegant sides, some splintered pieces already littering the table top. Lifting aside the case, Draco leant closer, wondering why on earth Potter had—
Heart pounding, Hermione clicked on the link and followed it to Harry’s supposed blog. After reading the information on the side, Hermione’s suspicion was confirmed.
“I apologise for him, Harry, Nott should not have said the things he did,” Draco began, holding Potter’s gaze.
“I am not,” Harry denied, not meeting the red head’s eyes.
“Yeah, mate, you do.” Ron smiled. “You’ll have the entire female population after you now.”
“I would like to study outside today,” Pansy announced as she arrived by the desk.
“Oh, indeed?” The smirk was back in Malfoy’s voice as he followed Harry into the kitchen. “What sort of snakes were
Chuckling at Ron’s comment, Harry allowed his thoughts to drift, thinking back to the first moment he had ever met Draco Malfoy. Harry didn’t think he would have found Malfoy so rude if he hadn’t known Dudley. After all, Malfoy had reminded Harry of his cousin to the point where it was almost scary. Harry

The pounding in his skull dimmed only slightly but he forced himself to ignore it as he closed his eyes. If his headache got any worse he’d go see Madam Pomfrey first thing tomorrow. Knowing Hermione, she was probably right about the altered ingredients.
Hermione snorted. “Even you can’t deny the way Malfoy and Harry were always in each other’s face. From day one those two have been dancing around each other in a shocking display of confused hormones. There is a fine line between love and hate and I believe those two have crossed that line several times over.” She quirked her head, an ironic smile twisting at her lips. “Come now, Pansy, don’t tell me Malfoy wasn’t completely obsessed with Harry before this all happened.”
Rolling off his bed, Harry made for the pile of homework and grabbed the first thing that lay on top. He looked down at the textbook, slightly happy to see it was Defence Against the Dark Arts.
“Draco!” Pansy leant forward in worry. “What’s wrong? Are you alright?”
Blaise, who was sitting beside him with his nose buried in a textbook, glanced up. He shrugged. “He, Draco, and Pansy have become pretty good friends,” the dark skinned male replied.
” he finished with a growl. Harry abruptly snatched up the beautifully carved silver mirror, holding it before him. “Show me the boy,” he ordered, teeth bared angrily.
“Told you he was handsome, didn’t I, Mione?” the teacup said, eyeing Draco with a grin as he sat back down on the leather couch.
“Given the change in circumstance… don’t you think it’s time to move on?”
“I’m in trouble, Pansy,” Draco mumbled in reply, keeping his gaze averted from hers. “The compulsion is becoming too strong.”
With a

each other?” Ron asked. “He’s such a prat! How can you manage to even stay in the same room as him?”
Harry’s throat suddenly went dry, his jaw clenching as he looked away. “I don’t know,” he answered finally, voice soft. “I thought I did—do—
Pansy grinned. “The way I heard it, Lucius can’t exactly punish his son for something he himself is guilty of.”
“Yes, you are.” Hermione smiled indulgently, closing the cupboard door.
Pansy huffed in annoyance. “
“Programs?” Neville bit his lip.
to join me for breakfast?”
Thinking quickly, Harry altered the colour of his crown to a deep emerald green and passed it over the disgruntled blond.
“So?” Harry quirked an eyebrow at his best friend. “What am I supposed to do? Walk naked back through the castle?”
“Harry? What on earth are you doing?”
A soft sigh fell from the blond’s lips. “And who is this gorgeous creature?” Malfoy murmured, gazing longingly in the large terrarium Harry had set up along the wall.
“Malfoy enjoying a muggle product? I never thought
“Cheer up,” Harry chuckled. “It’s actually something I think you’ll enjoy.”
He managed to get through one entire paragraph before the urge to check Tumblr became too hard to ignore.
Then his fireplace
“Must have been Care of Magical Creatures,” Hermione mused. “Wonderful, extra study time!”
Malfoy chuckled. “Man up, Potter, otherwise you’ll never keep up with my humour.”
“Don’t tell me you actually want it,” Draco sneered, ignoring the small jibe he felt. He of course, had printed off the picture Potter had drawn of him and hidden it securely. Pansy didn’t need to know that.
“What is this new site? Do I know it?”
“Potter keeps staring at me,” Draco growled softly. “Do you suspect Granger told him?”
“Obviously,” Harry moped, following the peculiar Slytherin out of the library. “So why the sudden urge to be outside?”
That’s why it had to be a muggle site. At least then Harry would be able to post and express himself while being treated as if he was like everyone else. And it would be perfect.
“Hey, Malfoy?”
“I became rather hooked over summer,” Hermione admitted. “One of my friends I see during the holidays got me onto it.”
“I didn’t mean it like that!” he said quickly. “Well, maybe a little,” he admitted. “I’m just looking out for you, mate, you know that.”
“Well, aside from you hiding in your room in the dark sulking?” Ron replied with a crooked grin, coming over to sit on the edge of the bed.
“You don’t know that.”
Malfoy was curled up elegantly in an alcove, a mug of something warm held in his hands. His blue eyes were surprisingly warm as he watched Harry, his head tilted against a pillar.
“Yeah but I’m not looking.” Charlie’s smirk had grown wider. “Perks of being ace, my friend. Besides, you’re getting on in years, you know?”
knows what Harry is feeling now—how could you do this to him, Draco?”
Harry stared at the Slytherin in amazement before he tossed his head back and positively roared with laughter. Draco watched in slight fascination as Harry’s face brightened with unbidden joy, eyes flashing with amusement.
“Hmm, that might be possible,” Hermione pondered, moving her gaze back to the headmaster and hoping she hadn’t missed out on anything important while they had been chatting.
had been condemned… and for what?
“Stop talking,” Harry gasped, pressing against the back of Malfoy’s head. Draco responding with a harsh nip of his skin and Harry groaned, pressing himself harder against the male who held him. Deft fingers began to divulge Harry of his clothes, his shirt and jumper sliding up his skin together and in a quick motion, the articles of clothing were pulled up and over Harry head, exposing his flushed torso. Immediately, a hot mouth latched onto one of his pert nipples and Harry felt himself jerk, body flooding with arousal.
Draco lifted an eyebrow to the young man opposite him. Potter smirked in response.
“And Potter?” Pansy questioned. “What are you going to do?”
Harry sighed and rolled onto his stomach, eyes falling on the frosty window. Snowflakes fell elegantly outside, undisturbed and peaceful. As Harry watched them, a soft breeze picked up the flakes and tossed them about in a whirl of excitement much to the brunet’s enjoyment. Harry had always enjoyed winter, particularly the beauty snow could bring.
Draco’s jaw clenched once more as another truth reared its ugly head. “It appears—” he cleared his throat awkwardly, “it appears you are the one I am attracted to. As such, it is your blood that I now require. This is the reason behind my… determination to befriend you.”

Harry giggled. “It’s not the date that will woo her, Ron, it’ll be

“Granger, may I have a word?” Parkinson asked, catching up to the trio before they started up the stairs.
the castle. He recalled leaving the manor with the intent to explore the school… but the next thing Lucius knew, he was entering the front doors of him home, knowing he was required to report to the Dark Lord.
“None of your business,
As he scrolled through numerous posts he paused, eyes drawn to particular intoxicating black and white photo. Two men were tightly entwined, lips locked and eyes closed. Harry bit his lip as he studied them, wondering—not for the first time—what it would be like to kiss another male. Hesitantly, he moved his cursor over the

Malfoy snorted, a delightful smirk curling at his lips. “Haven’t considered using a glamour then, Potter?”
“Excuse me, Granger? Slytherins
“No,” he said. “What if he turns on me? Makes
Malfoy smiled winningly. “You may.”
“Ready to go?”
The blond male chuckled indulgently as he slid himself gracefully into the recently vacated stool, offering a Harry a mischievous smirk.
“I’m telling you, Hermione, there is something seriously up with Malfoy.”
“To find Malfoy,” Ron growled.
Harry snorted. “Excuse me for noticing the one thing you seemed to love aside from potions,” he replied. “You love trying to upstage me and I know you love flying—why did you stop?” The brunet watched as a hint of sadness appeared in Malfoy’s face. He barely had time to make sense of this when Malfoy had slipped his usual mask across his features.
“Sure.”
The red head grinned as he sat down on the edge of Harry’s bed. “I always knew,” he said, pressing his hands to his chest and blinking at Harry.
“I’m not!” the red head chuckled. “Malfoy is going to be so
those?” he asked.
Harry felt a pang of excitement shoot through him. One of his followers wanted to get to know him better! He right clicked on the name of his follower, opening their blog in another tab. Blonds-Do-It-Better didn’t have much information in regards to their identity but it did show what age they were, that he was male and where he lived.
“Don’t you believe in house unity, Potter?”
Potter’s gaze, which had evidently been waiting for a snarky response as well, softened in surprise. He nodded but said nothing. Slowly, Draco could feel the Gryffindor begin to relax around him but instead of pulling back, Draco leant forward, capturing Potter’s mouth in a hot kiss.
“Pansy,” the female began gently, “it’s going to be alright. Look, there’s no point in either of us getting worked up about this. Yes, Draco has messed up, but we’re not going to know if it can be fixed until we try, okay?”
“Draco, you’re staring again.”
in denial!”
Grumbling, Harry returned his sketch book to his bag and opened up a fresh Word document. For the first twenty minutes of their double period, Harry dutifully copied down notes. When his attention began to roam, however, Harry decided to reward himself with some Tumblr.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t think he knows what happened,” the brunet muttered. “He’s become obsessed with his laptop. Didn’t look up once.”
Harry’s heart ached.
An explosion of purple smoke suddenly erupted from the potion and bright green sparkles shot out in every direction. The stench was absolutely foul and Draco felt his stomach lurch horridly as he lent to the side, dry retching. His stomach muscles clenched painfully and his eyes watered in response.
“Alright, alright, fair point,” Malfoy replied playfully. He raised his wine goblet and took a delicate sip, his silver eyes never once straying for Harry’s face. “And you were going to use tonight…”
“What’s wrong?” she asked.
“Shut up, Pansy,” Draco said with no heat. He ignored the grin his best friend sent him as he removed parchment and ink from his bag and arranged them on the desk.
his subconscious added helpfully.
Draco thought. “How many is that now? Eight thousand?”
“Well come on or we’ll miss breakfast,” Hermione continued, gesturing towards to the Great Hall. She, Ron, and Harry were crossing the surprisingly empty Entrance Hall when a lone figure suddenly bumped into them.
For the first time since coming to terms with his sexuality Harry was truly content. Hell, if Malfoy of all people could go out of his way to make Harry feel better about himself then why shouldn’t he be happy for a change? He couldn’t help the way he felt, he couldn’t help that he was attracted to males and it wasn’t his fault.
“Fuck off, Potter,” Draco snarled instead, his upper jaw beginning to throb.
“You don’t think Hermione’s falling for Malfoy do you, mate?” Ron asked sadly as they entered the Entrance Hall.
At Draco’s annoyed huff, Harry felt his smile widen.
The dark haired Slytherin’s jaw clenched as she sent a quick glance in Harry’s direction before her eyes snapped back to Hermione’s face. “We need to talk,” she said shortly.
Rolling his eyes, Draco turned to face the brunet, holding his gaze. “I answered because I wanted to. We’re trying to find out more about each other aren’t we?”
Harry paused, realising with a start of surprise that Malfoy was no longer beside him. He turned back to the doors with a frown, his eyebrows lifting in mild disbelief when he saw the blond-headed Slytherin standing in the shadows of the doorway.
Blinking, Draco focused on the screen of his new school laptop. It was slighter smaller than the one he’d bought and nowhere near as pretty. It did the job however, and soon he was back on his account on Tumblr—
“Yes.” Harry firmed his strokes, hand cupping Draco’s jaw and fingers curling around the side of his neck. “Even if that means drinking your,

“There are three steps in establishing a pure blood-bond between vampire and mate. Step one Draco has already performed by ingesting your blood. Yes, it would have been prudent to appropriately seek your consent beforehand but in the eyes of the bond, it has still been completed. Now, step two is similar, but requires a closer connection between the two of you. This is because you, Harry, will need to ingest some of Draco’s blood in return.”
fucked up a potion before.”
“What?”
“Yeah, well…” Hermione shrugged and trailed off as they exited the Potions classroom. The three of them sauntered down the dark corridor, none of them particularly in a hurry to get to their next class which was History of Magic.
“WHAT?!”
Harry suppressed a shiver. He glared up at the blond who was staring at him intently. “Since when were you so chummy?” he snapped.
Relief passed over the brunette’s face, mildly irritating Draco.
“No,” she said haughtily. “This is more important.”
Ron looked over at the brunet, not believing he was about to admit what he’d heard. “Harry… I might have overheard Malfoy talking to Parkinson today.”
“We’ll see,” Draco scoffed as he checked his watch. “Come on let’s go, I have some questions I want answered from our supposed Hero.”
Draco eyed the woman before him carefully. She seemed strained as she spoke and he wondered briefly just what type of man this ‘Dark Lord’ was to strike such weariness into his usually resilient mother.
“True,” Potter agreed.
A slow grin began to overtake Harry’s face. He could tell that Malfoy was attempting to relieve the nervous tension between them with his usual laidback attitude. Harry was thankful because it was working.
“Draco and Potter sitting in a tree…”
Exiting the bathroom, Draco’s eyes landed on his laptop.
“It does not worry me,” he voiced, quirking an eyebrow at the wardrobe where both faces grinned in response. “If you would be so kind as to direct me to the bathroom I will endeavour to be quick.” His mind was already working on spells that he could use on his currently clothing—would it be too inappropriate to simply spell the clothes he was wearing clean? At least until he could work out how he was to gain his own wardrobe?
Sunday is painfully eventless because there is an avalanche of homework to do, and Hermione insists on dragging all the Gryffindors to the library to study.
“C’eri quasi l’altra volta,” Marelli says to Draco, sounding encouraging and making Harry feel a little more desperate as he opens his eyes and notices Draco’s lips part and his tongue flicking out.
“If she says no, then I will go out with you,” Ron says and Zabini hits him with a book.
“I like you,” he replies. “And we’re…friends.”
“It’s okay,” he said and then Potter stood up and groaned, and Draco couldn’t help but notice the evident bulge at the front of his trousers.
Draco’s words are authoritative, but his voice wavers. His fingers are so tender on Harry, carding through his messy curls and waiting for him to find the courage to touch him.
He wants someone to kiss too. Someone blond and smart and with long legs and an amazing arse.
“Draco,” he calls and then after a couple of minutes, his old rival appears at the doorway.
“So the house was throwing a strop at me because it doesn’t want me, basically,” Harry sums up. “Is that why temperature regulating charms never seemed to work?”
He sat up straight and moved his legs, stretching them again, brushing against something and not seeing anything when he checked.
“Breathe,” Malfoy says, spreading his legs, fingers circling his cock in an obscene gesture. “We’re just having a friendly wank together. Look at me and take a deep breath.”
He hears Draco’s sobs. He feels his hands all over him, trembling fingers touching Harry’s face and arms, searching for his palms. But he goes on, because he doesn’t think he can do this a second time.
He sits on Draco’s bed, taking his cloak off, and then he waits. The minutes go by, and Harry starts wondering if this was one of the stupidest ideas he’s had so far when the door suddenly opens, making him jump as Draco comes in, stopping in his tracks when he spots him.
They shower in silence and then Harry gets dressed with a lump in his throat. Harry’s still sitting on the bench, tying his shoelaces, when Draco gets up and puts his satchel across his shoulders. Harry’s hand reaches automatically for his and they exchange a look.
“Eat your own, and don’t you dare take mine, you Gryffindor menace!” Draco warns, looking affronted as he glares at him under pale eyebrows. His hair is even lighter than it used to be, and there’s a sprinkle of freckles on his face. His pale skin is so sensitive that he tends to get sunburnt, so Draco is always covered in sun cream. Harry likes helping him put it on his back before they leave for the beach, letting his fingers run across pale skin as Draco relaxes under him.
“How long has this
“Here,” Draco whispers, “the water is warm enough now. Close your eyes, sweetheart.”
Harry grabs Draco’s wrist, feeling the anxiety creeping up his chest, making it suddenly harder to breathe. The tip of his fingers prickle as he presses them into Draco’s flesh, dragging him away, through narrow streets and canals, past the red-light district and into a small china shop. Harry realises when they finally stop that he’s nearly hyperventilating, and Draco touches his face, fingers sliding through messy curls as he whispers that everything is fine, that they’re alone now.
“I know,” Harry says shakily, stroking his back and laying a kiss in the crook of Draco’s neck. “I know…”
“Oh, Potter,” Malfoy says, shaking his head, hand on his hip as if he were striking a pose. “That won't do. It’s the Saviour’s birthday and we ought to celebrate.”
“No more interrogations?” he asks Kingsley, and the man slowly shakes his head.
“Fuck, Harry…” Malfoy moans. Green eyes open wide at the mention of his first name as his finger traces Malfoy’s hard cock, up and down. Harry wants to stick it inside Malfoy’s stretched hole; he briefly wonders if Malfoy will let him do it, if it will fit inside together with his other fingers, but before he can ask for permission, the blond moans loudly, and he’s suddenly coming all over his belly and hand, whimpering through it. Malfoy’s fingers slide out of his entrance, and Harry can’t stop staring at the stretched skin, glistening with lube. It feels impossibly intimate to be allowed to look there, to witness the unwinding of Malfoy, soft and lovely in his post-orgasmic calm. “Harry…”
“I could make you come like this,” Draco whispers, his voice hoarse and wrecked. “With my fingers and my tongue. I could let you slide your hands into my hair to take control. I could let you fuck my mouth, as hard as you want.”
“How is your mother?” Harry asks, trying to be polite.
“I didn’t think you'd want to…” Draco whispers, his lips red and puffy and Harry gets lost in his grey eyes for a minute, “I mean, we don’t have to…”
“Splendid,” Malfoy replies, his voice like sandpaper. “Never been better.”
“Why are you all dressed in black?” was Potter’s last question, when it was time for him to change into his school uniform and get rid of those faded jeans of his, “you were wearing black robes when I came to the Manor too.”
When they receive their timetables, they discover that they all have compulsory Muggle Studies (McGonagall’s idea, apparently) and that Harry will probably share most of his classes with Draco.
“I got a flash edition of the Prophet earlier,” Hermione explains. “They had to destroy the West Wing of Malfoy Manor, because they couldn’t get past Voldemort’s spells. The Aurors had to use some really powerful spells and get help from abroad. It’s all over the papers.”
When Harry wakes up, his mind is clearer than it has been in months.
“Maybe he has a lover,” Harry hypothesises. “It could be anyone.”
“It’s okay,” Harry mutters, because it is now. He has Draco all to himself, and the rest doesn’t matter anymore somehow. “I think we established that we’re both jealous idiots.”
“Because the house realised that we’re together,” Draco confesses, his cheeks turning red as he finally locks his gaze with Harry. “The house assumed that we’re a couple because of what we’ve been doing, so it thinks that I’m a perfect match for you.”
“Please! You’re Harry Potter, who wouldn’t want to be with you?”
“I love you too,” Draco replies, and watches him go.
He Apparates to Malfoy Manor.
“Please at least talk to your friends about this, before you make your mind up,” Draco begs and then their eyes finally meet. Harry feels like an electric shock going through his spine.
“Err…”
“You were by my side all day,” Draco reminds him with an amused smile on his face.
The Manor feels menacing at night, with the high ceilings and vast rooms imposing in their deafening silence. Every single step or movement echoes through the house, making goose pimples appear on Harry’s bare arms. He should have worn a jumper, he thinks as he walks around the house, looking for Malfoy. He’s not in his bedroom again, nor in the library or the kitchen. Harry tries the storage room, but he’s not there either.
When Harry gets to Malfoy Manor, Narcissa takes the cloak from him and puts it on Draco and then Harry can finally take his blindfold off and stare into empty space, where his boyfriend should be.
Draco sits on the bed, casting his own locking and silencing charm on the door.
“You’ve gone all quiet, Potter. What kind of nonsense are you brooding over?”
