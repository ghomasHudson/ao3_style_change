He shifted involuntarily, immediately stilling as he felt the toy brush against his prostate, not missing the smirk that hadn't left Draco's face all morning. When he looked at the clock on the wall, Harry groaned internally at the fact that it had only been less than an hour since they'd arrived at the Ministry.
They stayed like this, together, softly sharing kisses in the entryway of the flat, for far longer than they planned to. Eventually, Draco pulled away, staring down into his boyfriend's eyes, dazzling green staring back at him. "Do I not get a tour?"
It was fine at first. Harry was able to continue working, becoming used to the soft vibrations against his skin, as his cock fully hardened. For the first time that morning, he'd been able to look at the clock and notice that a chunk of time had actually passed.
"Please Dra-
Surely not. Everyone who he did love, knew that, even if he didn't tell them. But something told him that, maybe, Draco needed him to say it back and fuck, did that terrify him. What if he just couldn't? What if that was it for them?
Draco simply scoffed at Harry's begging, twirling his wand between his fingers in an oddly menacing motion. "What do you want, Harry? You promised me you could last an hour. It's only been." He checked the slim watch around his wrist. "Forty-seven minutes."
"No touching, understand?"
Harry only nodded, obviously finding his own feet much more interesting than this conversation, as he let his eyes drop.
would ever actually happen, and now I don't ever wanna let it go. Even just for Christmas. Stupid, I know, I'll see you in two weeks. Just, feels weird."
"Oh lord," Draco stuttered, running his hands through his boyfriend's curls.
Much to his delight, Remus didn't mind where Sirius smoked when he was drunk, as long as he could find a suitable ashtray.
"Okay, so he definitely saw that."
God, it felt good to be home.
before demanding to know what was going on.
It had all started last night. They were laid in bed together basking in the general afterglow of sex, Draco massaging the marks on Harry's wrists and whispering sweet words against his hair, when the words had just tumbled out of Harry's mouth. He'd thought that he'd just been thinking about it, but Draco's face had told him that he'd actually said them out loud.
Harry only snorted at this, earning another slap from his boyfriend.
Softly, Harry lowered his head to kiss along the material covering Draco's length, pulling even more gasps from the taller.
All Harry could do was nod and agree, feeling the exact same way.
"So," Remus started, looking down at his glass, rather than actually at Harry. "I think it's important to note that you have a lock on your bedroom. For. A. Reason." This only made Sirius bark out a laugh, Harry groan again as he ran a hand over his temples, and Draco to take another swig of his whiskey.
"I look forward to it, love," Draco replied, sending a sincere smile to the man sat opposite him.
All of the returning eighth years (of which there was about ten) had been told that they would be sharing with one other student, in rooms separate from their house dorms. Maybe Harry should have expected it, McGonagall always did seem to know what he needed most, but it was still a shock to walk into his new room, immediately spotting Draco Malfoy sat, cross-legged, on one of the beds.
His tone left no space for debate, only enough time for Harry to nod into the cushions before he continued his brutal pace.
Harry had known, since he was fourteen, that he was interested in both sexes. That had been 100% confirmed the first time Cedric spoke to him, the younger boy barely being able to have a complete conversation with him without imagining kissing his face off. It probably took him another year to realise that, maybe (definitely), his schoolboy
Needless to say, ten years wasn't enough for some of them to change their opinions of the blonde.
"You little shit," he teased, launching the empty packet at Draco's head, who was now openly laughing.
, more, please."
"You know I wouldn't mind."
Draco couldn't help but blush a little bit, registering the fact that Harry had now linked their fingers and had brought their hands up to his lips, placing a soft kiss against the back of the blonde's, smiling at him as he dropped their hands back to the table.
With a small, shared smile with Draco, Harry nodded again. "Very."
Mixed with the agonising stimulation against his prostate, Harry was slowly losing faith in his self-control.
He didn't waste any time in starting up a rapid rhythm, taking Harry's advice to heart as he hands pressed subtle bruises into Harry's hips. "You look so good like this, you know that right, bent over the nearest object because we both just couldn't wait," Draco practically growled, punctuating the end of his sentence with a particularly harsh thrust.
They spent the next few hours getting far too drunk for their own good, giggles constantly filling the room around them as they all processed what Sirius had just said.
Slowly, and with a lot of coaxing from his boyfriend, Harry managed to get himself out of bed. The blonde tried to get him to change but Harry had fixed him a hard glare and refused, insisting that nothing else would be possible until he had at least three cups of coffee in his system.
Before Harry can even
When he let his eyes scan over the boy's face, and the rest of the room, he came to the conclusion that he must've slept with his glasses on. He soon also realised that he'd fallen asleep fully clothed, staring down at himself to see his t-shirt rumpled and riding up his stomach. He let out another groan, running his hands over his face as Draco ran his own hands up his arms, chuckling quietly.
"Oh, there will definitely be a next time, maybe just a bit more sobriety and friendly conversation before all hell breaks loose," Remus pointed out, giving Draco a genuine smile.
"That's what I like to hear. Where do you want me?"
Harry kept running his fingers through Draco's hair and down across his chest, causing the blonde to let out a low growl. With a subtle flick of his wand, a bottle of lube and a pair of handcuffs flew into his hand. Harry pulled away, slightly, smirking as he noticed both items.
He couldn't bite back his noises this time, blushing scarlet at the moan that floated into the room.
"Oh, you definitely get a tour, may I recommend starting with the bedroom?"
, were loudly discussing their family, managing to smoke their way through Sirius' pack.
Sirius only nodded, dropping the cardboard into the bin, as he sat back down, wrapping his hand around his husband's. They shared a fond look, that seemed to hold an entire conversation, before both looking at the blonde.
and expect not to get stared at.
When he looked back around the compartment, which was now far more empty, Harry had fallen back asleep against the window. "I swear to god, Potter, wake the fuck up or I'm not coming over on Thursday."
"Fuck me, didn't realise there was a sign on the door that said queers only," Zabini exclaimed, smiling at his own joke.
"You love it, though," Harry replied, momentarily pausing his game (of trying to do what, Draco wasn't quite sure) to plant a soft kiss against Draco's cheek. The blonde only huffed, turning back towards the window so that nobody could see the smile on his face.
If there was one thing that Draco knew about Harry Potter, it was that he was
The room slowly became filled with the scent of sex and both men's panting, Draco taking his time in pulling out of Harry and letting cleaning spells wash over them.
It really wasn't that big of a thing, at least not to anyone else, and it wasn't the actual words that had Harry's mind racing. It was the fact that he couldn't quite imagine himself saying them back.
"Harry, tell me wha-"
In all honesty, this had been his idea, but he wasn't going to admit that to himself, because that meant he was to blame. No, he was going to blame Draco. That evil, insufferable, fucking
Harry walked them backwards until Draco's knees hit the edge of his bed, pushing him down softly before straddling his waist. He loved seeing the blonde like this, all laid out beneath him, every one of his condescending facial expressions wiped clean and replaced with that wild look of arousal and begging.
The blonde had never been shy about the little whimpers and moans he let out, insisting that they should at least try to take advantage of not being in a dorm, anymore.
Harry only shook his head as both adults laughed openly, folding his arms across his chest, wide smile still planted across his face. "I hate both of you," he whispered, pulling louder laughs from the two of them.
fuck you."
"Yes, kisses now."
Harry could only nod, mouth going dry as Draco pulled off his trousers, revealing the fact that he hadn't felt it necessary to put any pants on after his shower. The hitch in Draco's breathing was barely there, but it still brought a pleased smile to Harry's face.
The one thing that Harry's mind kept reeling back to was the fact that people
Harry had to jog a couple of steps to catch up with Malfoy's quick stride, but was soon close enough to slide one of his arms around Draco's waist and place a soft kiss against his cheek.
Draco was quickly pulled into a tight hug, face tucked into his boyfriend's shoulder, before they both pulled away. "See you on Thursday, yeah?" Draco only nodded, smiling down at him.
When he'd finally set foot back in the castle, everything had felt weird. Don't get it twisted, it had felt weird on the train, but he'd sat with Ginny and they'd chatted like they usually did. He'd sat at the Gryffindor table, watched the sorting ceremony, indulged in too much food. There was an odd air of normality, to the whole situation.
He ran the last few metres of the corridor, coming to a halt in front of the boy, who seemed to have also stopped as he noticed his boyfriend. "Hello, darling," Draco whispered, snaking an arm around Harry's waist and placing a soft kiss against his cheek.
"Okay, in my defence, you two were meant to be out. Why are you even back?" He adds, probably a bit too loudly.
"Hey, it'll be okay. I can apparate to make it less awkward, if you want," he whispered, earning a headshake from the younger. "No, no, please stay. Maybe I won't completely wanna die if you're there." This pulled a quiet chuckle from the blonde as he nodded, leaning in to place a soft kiss against the boy's lips.
Harry scoffed and nodded, placing a soft kiss against the bottom of the blonde's jawline. "You'd be surprised."
"Sirius, window."
Harry nodded, ushering Draco out of his room and down the hallway, noting that Remus was behind both of them. They made it into the kitchen, after what felt like the longest walk of Harry's life.
He was cut off with another one of his boyfriend's soft kisses, who only shook his head as he traced his thumb across Harry's tanned cheek. The boy nuzzled into the feeling, letting his eyes close as he prepared for the inevitable disappointment that was to follow.
Harry must've closed his eyes, because his head was suddenly yanked backwards and his eyelids fluttered open, landing on Draco's face above him. He was stood behind his chair, one hand firmly on his jaw and the other worming its way into his robes.
They slid into two of the kitchen table chairs, both being immediately handed steaming mugs of coffee, Harry being able to smell the cinnamon that had been stirred into his. He sent a grateful smile to the adult sat across from him, for once relishing in the fact that Remus had had to deal with one too many of his hangovers, knowing what fixed him almost instantly.
Draco simply nodded, ducking his head again. He didn't take Harry in his mouth this time, oh no. Instead, one of his hands came up to roll his balls between his fingers as Draco kissed all along Harry's thighs, sucking deep purple bruises against the skin.
"Hmm, you know I don't like that mouth on you."
, are you- is this, a regular thing?" Sirius asked, motioning his hands between the two teenagers.
It wasn't long before Draco had lifted his head, hand still working on Harry's balls, pulling soft moans and whimpers from the man. He gestured for his watch, taking it in his spare hand and watching the seconds tick down.
"No, I do. Please,
As much as Draco wanted to complain about his new friends, he just really couldn't. The war definitely taught him to listen more, to think before forming an opinion, and to not do things just because they made other people happy. Them returning had also, undoubtedly, increased the level of inter-house communication, something McGonagall commented on constantly.
Finally, just before lunch, Harry caught a glimpse of that white-blonde hair that he'd been longing for all day.
"Not currently, no. I have to return some books to the library and mail a letter to mother, but I suppose that can wait. What's up?" Draco replied, a small frown settling between his eyebrows.
One of Harry's absolute favourite things about sex with Draco was the noises.
Harry pulled off of him, slowly, looking up from his position on his knees as he swallowed, sly smirk making its way onto his face. He finally stood up, helping Draco tuck himself back into his school trousers, stepping into the blonde's space and wrapping his arms around him. Draco gave him a soft smile, seemingly full of questions, as he wrapped his arms behind his neck.
As expected, soon enough both men felt the tell-tale curling heat at the base of their spines, getting closer and closer to toppling over that edge. "Draco pl-please, god I'm so close, please let me come," Harry begged, burying his face into the material of the sofa cushions.
He slowly bobbed his head, letting his tongue swirl around Draco's tip, lapping up the bead of precum that dribbled from his slit. Just the feeling of the boy's lips around him had Draco's stomach fluttering, an undeniable heat pooling at the base of his spine.
He gulped down probably half of the mug before breathing deeply, shuddering as the warmth spread through his body.
To his disappointment, Draco pulled away and released his grip on his chin, letting his head fall forward. He eyed his watch and nodded, bending until his lips were in line with Harry's ear.
. Turns out, when you spend seven years hating someone, you don't really learn a lot about them. Over the past four months, Harry had made a mental checklist of everything he'd found out about Draco Malfoy:
anyone that he loved them, no matter how much he did.
Draco let out a proper laugh at that, even leaning forward to rest his forehead against Harry's shoulder, who was now laughing as well. "Okay, so maybe I shouldn't have said it quite like that, but the point still stands. If you're stressed or riled up, you could always take it out on me. I don't mind."
Once he sinks back down on their bed, right in the spot where he let Harry fuck him last night, he realises how empty this room feels. Without all Harry’s things there’s no life left in this room. The picture frames with pictures of Harry and his annoying friends and the one of his parents are gone, he even took the one with the picture of Harry and Draco together. There are no folders of Harry’s cases scattered about and his clothes are all gone. Draco’s clothes from last night still lay abandoned on the floor in front of him.
They appear on the pavement before Draco’s apartment on Cornelia street. Draco recoils, but Harry pulls him along into the apartment.
Millicent looks around the circle, “Definitely Potter. He’s wearing little so you can see everything that’s going on.” Millicent smirks, Harry frowns and Draco chugs his drink. “And… Draco.” Gasps sound through the circle.
“I reckon I could fit in these robes. But then you’ll have to take them off first.” Blaise says smirking.
“Oh, I wasn’t lying about that. I do really want to kiss you.”
“A kiss.”
“I would love that.” Draco says honestly as he presses even closer against Harry.
Apparently, he makes lots of noise because Harry comes through the backdoor, “Draco? What are you doing? Are you drunk?”
“Lunch?!” Michael looks like he’s seriously considering taking away Draco’s drink, so he downs it. It’s too much, so a bit drips down his chin.
“Why are you ignoring me?” Draco counters.
His arms give out and he collapses onto Draco. Both of them breathing hard. “That was,” Harry rolls off Draco and falls on the sheets next to him, “Merlin that was amazing.” He grabs Draco’s hand, “You were amazing.”
“And we’re just done seeing you mope.” Theo adds.
“You have no idea how bad I wanted to hear you say those words, but now. How – How can I trust what you say. I gave you everything I had and you,” Draco’s breath hitches, “You left me. When I was at my most vulnerable.”
“Yes, sure.” She gathers her books a parchments hastily. “See you later, Theo.” She says with a wistful smile. Then catches up with her boyfriend.
Draco’s eyes are trained on that one, lonely toothbrush as he stumbles backwards into the bedroom.
Draco wakes up, ultraviolet morning light coming through the window, he stretches. When he doesn’t feel anything, he shoots up and his eyes snap open. Harry’s not there. And there’s no note, like he leaves when he has an early day.
And Harry does, slowly at first. Trying to find the right angle for Draco.
,” Draco says pointing at Blaise over his shoulder, “but not from you.”
They don’t plan anything beforehand. Harry just shows up. Some weeks he’s here every night and some weeks he only comes once. So, Draco doesn’t have any illusions about today, there are no rules in breakable heaven. It’s a Sunday so he doesn’t have to go to work. Harry has dinners at the Weasley household, and he’s an auror so who knows when he does or doesn’t have to work.
“Yes. I – I do.” Draco frowns at Harry, who plates scrambled eggs and bacon on two plates. “Why are you still here?” the words are out of his mouth before he can think about it.
21st of February
Draco frowns, “What do you-”
“I need some air.” Draco rushes past his friends, out of the house. Ignoring Pansy who calls after him to wait.
“This is what I mean, you’re such a Slytherin.”
“You´re wearing all these clothes?”
“Smith,” Harry smirks “Now what do you say?”
“Well I was here first.”
Harry releases Draco’s cock, presses kisses on Draco’s thighs as he hoists his legs over his shoulders. Then murmurs something and continues on, making Draco moan and shiver. There’s been very little occupying Draco’s mind, but when he softly slips a wet finger between his cheeks before pressing into his hole, all clear thoughts really leave him. The only thing Draco can think is ‘Harry’ and how good this feels.
Harry shrugs his coat jacket off and throws it over the back of his chair. He rolls op the sleeves of his when he hears a familiar drawl from behind him. “Seriously Potter?”  Harry turns around and sees Draco Malfoy raising an eyebrow at Harry. “I thought Pansy was joking, but you really look atrocious.”
“Deal!”
“Yes I believe so.” Hermione says.
“Why would I ask for your floo address if I wasn’t going to use it?” Draco crosses his arms over his chest and looks at Harry like this is obvious. Then turns back to the pile of Harry’s clothes closes to him and starts sorting it out.
“So,” Draco raises his eyebrows, Harry looks at him confused. “I guess all the rumours are true.” Draco grins. “You’re my lover.”
Draco apologised so earnestly that Harry couldn’t help but kiss him. But as Draco fell asleep in is arms, Harry stayed awake and stared that the wall. He had never been this confused before. Maybe everyone else was right? Maybe he should leave now and figure things out with Ginny and if it didn’t work out, it didn’t work out. But he should figure it out first. That’s what he and Ginny agreed when they’d broken up and if he really is as oblivious as his friends say, he should maybe listen to them.
“I know, but Draco-”
“Is it?” Draco rolls Potter over ad straddles his hips, “Is it really, Harry.”
Ronald snorts, “Sure.”
Fucking Potter.
“Sure. Sure.” Draco says, not really caring. He’s relishing how Harry’s hand feels holding his upper arm and the way his breath feels against his skin. Harry pulls away, and Draco immediately misses the warmth he radiates.
Harry walks up to him and cups his face. “Draco.”
Blaise crosses his arms across his broad chest. “Stop messing with me Nott. What do you want?”
“Well not exactly no. I do help with some arrangements, but it’s because of all the weddings that are going to take place this year.”
“Err, I think I can ask Gawain about it. Why?”
“Help me?”
When they pull apart, she blinks a few times and flushes, “I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have.”
Draco sneers at him and tries to focus on the game. It’s Millicent’s turn to answer a truth question, “Who would you like to watch make out?” Hannah Abbott asks.
“Oh,” Theo says when she pulls away.
“Ignoring you? I’m not ignoring you.”
However what surprises Harry even more is how Draco Malfoy looked. His hair was still the same platinum blood of his youth, but that’s where the similarities stopped. His hair is not slicked back like how he used to wear it at Hogwarts, instead it’s messy and hangs in his eyes, even though it isn’t even that long. Draco Malfoy’s eyes were still the same stormy grey, but the rest of his face seems to have changed completely. His features are now angular instead of pointy. On his lips is a smile that brings out dimples in his cheeks and shows perfect white teeth.
Ronald blinks a few times. “You’re such a prick.” He says as he bunches up the front of Blaise’s shirt and pulls him against himself. Their lips crashing together.
His friends are still angry at him for not telling them about Draco and leading Ginny on. He understands it all. He does, but all he really wants is Draco back. To go back to their apartment, make love in their bed, hold each other close on the couch and bicker in the kitchen.
“Good. Now that we’ve established that. I think it might be good for you two to have a conversation. Malfoy can fill you in on what he does and it’s never too early to start a good working relationship.” Robards says.
“Yes, right. Yes, I’ll go right now. I’ll just have to-”
“Pictures of Draco dressed up as Potter. Draco with his Potter dolls.” Pansy says with a smirk.
“Yes, you pillock! Come here!” Harry opens his arms and Draco presses the frame against his chest as he steps into Harry’s embrace. Harry holds him close and presses a kiss on his temple. “Dinner with Ron and Neville fell through, so I thought I’d just come home, and we could order some dinner.”
“What?” Draco asks.
Pansy crawls into the bed and takes hold of is hand. A silent comfort. “Won’t Greg miss you.”
“Wait!” Theo hurries after him.
But now, seeing this article. Draco doesn’t know what to think. Sure, he knows you shouldn’t trust anything the Prophet writes. But it’s the picture that’s bothering him.
“Why not. Draco is very nice. You just haven’t given him a chance yet Ron.” Hermione says.
Nevertheless, he has spoken to more people than ever this year. Well, talking to is stretching it, people have been shouting at him throwing a curse every now and then. Though his eight-year classmates have been civil. Curses both vocal and magical have been coming from the seventh and sixth years. The eight years haven’t so much as looked at him let alone started any kind of conversation. Not that Draco cares, - much. His friends are still his friends, though he sees less of them. Except for Blaise that is. Whose been at Draco’s side all of this year, pining after a certain ginger keeper since Halloween. When Weasley was dressed in little clothes as some sort of bushman. Tarzan, Granger called him, who herself was wearing a yellow dress and an atrocious yellow hat. Draco has to admit his speckled chest looked good, but not in an attractive sort of way. Though Blaise begs to differ, he hasn´t shut up about it since the party.
Ronald and Granger come back down the stairs. Ronald looks a bit green.
“Oh really?” Weasley turns to his boyfriend.
“Flattery won't get you out of it.” Draco says, “Try it with these.” Harry catches a pair black slacks Draco throws his way.
Draco blinks back the tears that form in the corners of his eyes. He though they made up yesterday. He apologised elaborately and Harry kissed him. He fucked him. He can’t have gone after he did that to Draco. Could he?
“That’s none of your business Malfoy. You’re just here to do the research.” Johnson snaps then stalks off.
“You didn’t tell me about it either!”
When they've gone through all the bags and Draco finally gives into Harry's complaining, Harry lets himself fall on the couch with a moan of agony. “That was the worst two hours of my life!” He complains.
Draco rolls his eyes.
“Sure, I’ll be right back with your menus.”
“Yeah, we’re going to play a game. I’d love to see the look on your face when I beat you with your own set.”
Pansy and her friends huddle together for a minute, “Truth or Dare,” Lavender says, “I’ll start!”
Draco’s friends drive off with a final glance in his way. After a few minutes he sneaks in through the garden gates. Just to seal his fate.
Draco knows he and Harry aren’t a public relationship, but he at least thought they were in one. He even thought they were on their way to maybe take their relationship public. Harry is here every night now. His stuff is here, they’re practically living together. Even though they haven’t said it out loud, Harry calls this place home for Merlin’s sake! They even have a planned date night. The only thing their relationship doesn’t have is publicity. They don’t go out together in the wizarding world, at least not without Draco wearing an insane amount of glamours. And they haven’t told their friends, because the more people know the easier it would be for the press to find out. At least that’s what Draco’s been telling himself.
Harry snaps his face to Draco, “You were?!”
“Seriously Potter.” Malfoy drawls, “Do you have this Friday afternoon off?”
the weddings?” Harry asks.
Blaise laughs, “We’re they naked already?”
“I better hope not. Italy has a much better scenery.”
“You don’t need it!” Harry shouts after him.
Draco turns away from his friend, Michael; a muggle who’s shown him all the good bars and clubs to pick up boys. It’s dim in the bar and Draco doesn’t recognise the person at first, but something happened. He heard him laughing, saw the dimples first and then he heard the accent. “Potter?”
“Don’t mind that,” Pansy says, “We can play another game.”
Though Theo had the brilliant idea to steal the redhead’s girlfriend he’s afraid of conflict and especially with someone bigger and fitter than himself. He might be good in a debate but when it comes to strength, he doesn’t have a single idea what to do.
“Draco, I-”
“I didn’t.”
Harry hums, trying to sound unaffected. But they saw each other? Romantically? Sexually?! He tells himself to stay calm and just walk away. Maybe he can ask Pansy. “If you excuse, I have best man duties to attend to.” Harry says with a what he hopes is a polite nod.
“Oliver is getting married? To whom?”
“Yeah, Draco’s mum showed up during the ceremony ad Draco demanded she’d make wedding pictures like the ones he’d seen in his parents wedding album.”
Draco reads the note with a smile on a face. Though Harry´s handwriting is a mess and almost unreadable and he left him to wake up alone, Draco can´t help but be happy that Harry took the time to think about what Draco had said after their first night together.
“Slytherin?”
“What do you have there?” Draco asks. When Harry stumbles through the floo after his work on Monday with a black bag in his hand.
“Yes,” Draco says his voice hoarse, “Yes, do that again.”
“Potter and the Weasley girl are throwing a party, and-”
He braces a hand on either side of his hips and flicks his tongue against Harry’s stomach. He can feel Harry gasp against his lips. Draco slightly sucks the liquid from Harry’s stomach, and when he hears a moan escape from Harry, Draco can’t help but smirk against Harry’s stomach. With new vigour Draco slowly makes his way up with kisses and licks. When he reaches Harry’s chest and doesn’t taste any more whiskey he pulls away. Harry, however, doesn’t seem to agree with that and pushes Draco over on his back and kisses his lips eagerly. “Merlin,” Harry says as he pulls away slightly to breath, “That was so hot.”
“Draco.” Harry interrupts him. “This is truly one of the best gifts I’ve ever received.” Harry looks up and Draco can see tears in the corners of his eyes.
Harry pulls away from his neck and places his forehead against Draco’s. For a moment they just sit there and breathe each other’s air.
“You- I, I wasn’t supposed to tell anyone.”
Draco looks at Harry, who’s staring at him wide eyed. “Did I say that out loud?” Draco asks, softly.
“So, can you predict what I’m going to do next? Ronald says with a smirk.
“Really. We were just talking about McLaren, he’s one of my aurors he is looking after.”
stops talking.”
“Draco!” Harry is starting to lose his cool, but Draco ignores him.
Harry pulls his hand from behind his back. In it he held a steaming to go cup from the teashop Draco had been dreaming about just minutes ago, “One hot herbal blend tea and,” Harry shows Draco his other hand in which he holds a small white paper bag, “A still warm pain chocolat.”
“Yea Ron you can do better than that,” Seamus laughs.
“But…”
"This is the missing piece."
“I could kiss you right now!” Draco exclaims.
Ginny and Hermione laugh, but Luna is too focused on unwrapping the little box, when she opens it and pulls out the silver chain with an amethist stone hanging on it, she beams. “Oh it’s perfect thank you! This will keep the warspurts at bay Gin! And it fits perfectly with our wedding theme.”
“Not an insult,” Draco gets up and stumbles, “Not anymore at least.” He mutters to himself.
“I’m just trying to get drunk.”
Blaise moves his queen, “Check.”
Pansy holds him close, “What wasn’t enough?”
Harry, ever the Gryffindor gets up, “Come on then Malfoy.”
Malfoy orders a earl grey tea and Harry a regular coffee. When the girl leaves with a last bright smile at them, Malfoy grabs a menu hand hides his face behind it.  Harry clears his throat awkwardly, “So you’ve become a healer?” Malfoy hums in reply. Harry clears his throat again and flips the menu open. “I wanted to give back.” Malfoy says putting his menu down, “after everything.”
It takes forever to fall asleep and when he does, he dreams of the war. He’s back at the battle of Hogwarts. Voldemort’s enormous snake is circling him and Greyback is eating someone, who looks like Dumbledore. And it seems like Voldemort is winning. Draco looks around for Harry, but he isn’t there.
Potter sits up, an arm around Draco’s waist to keep him steady and kisses him deeply. With his free hand he unbuttons Draco’s trousers and takes out Draco’s cock, wrapping a hand around it. The angle is a bit awkward, but when Harry moves his hand, Draco gasps and moans. He tilts his head back and closes his eyes. Harry leans his head on the crook of Draco’s neck.
When the game ends Ronald throws Blaise one of his rueful smiles and Blaise can’t help but grin back. His heart pounding fast in his chest.
“Malfoy?!” Weasley says in an abnormal high voice.
“Have you made a career switch we don’t know about ‘Mione?” Ron asks, “Are you a wedding planner now.”
Draco grumbles, but settles into Harry’s arms. His back flush against Harry’s chest, Harry’s arm around his waist. Harry presses a soft kisses on Draco’s neck, “Better?”
“You’re an awful friend Gregory.” Draco says moping.
“I – What?” Was something wrong with Draco?
“I- yes. Yes!”
At the same time, Weasley recoils. “I really didn’t need to know that.”
A brilliant smile overtakes his face, “I feel brilliant. Today has been great, everyone’s here, the sun shines and Millie looks beautiful.” He looks wistful, “She just keeps smiling and she shines, and her dress is beautiful of course. But that’s thanks to this guy,” he slaps Draco on his back, “the best best man.”
“That’s not what I meant! Please and we just go somewhere else to talk about it.”
to. Well of course then bend me over for the chosen one. The saviour. He gets what he wants. One moment he wants to fuck the death eater the next he gets back together with his ex-girlfriend and to make ginger babies.”
Blaise shakes his head.
“Oh, like that isn’t long at all.”
Draco props himself up on his elbows, “You want to go on holiday to America together? With me?”
“Try not to stare.” Blaise murmurs in Draco’s ear.
“One kiss doesn’t necessarily make you gay.”
“All of them?” Harry asks.
“I think we’ve established that.”
Ron sticks out his tongue, “It is
“No way, it’s Malfoy.” Ron protests again.
When Weasley’s gone for about ten minutes, Theo realises now is his chance, he looks over to Hermione and she looks back at him expectantly. She smiles a soft smile that makes Theo’s stomach flip. Is she waiting for him to come over? He gets up and turns his attention on the papers and books on his table. He makes sure he’s gathered everything, before looking back up at Hermione.
“I didn’t think I’d see the day.” Draco Malfoy stalks towards Harry with a glass of Champagne in his hand. He has his suit jacket draped over one arm and his bowtie is hanging loosely around his neck.
Hermione corners Harry and engages him in a conversation about her work at the ministry.
“Bloody hell,” Harry says then follows him Draco over the edge, spluttering all over Draco’s hand.
Draco sighs and grabs the bottle, “You can’t yell at me.”
“You promised you’d never leave without saying goodbye.”
“I know it’s all me, in my head. I’m the one who burned us down.” Draco say the words he’s been practising. “But it’s not what I meant. I’m sorry that I hurt you. I know that I’m a handful and I know that I can be overdramatic.”
“Who knows Harry you could be head auror!” Ginny says.
“You don’t?”
“I’m fine!” Draco insists when he finally manages to get free from the belt and stumble out of the car.
“Am not.”
Draco takes a step back; his hands are shaking. His eyes flick over the rest of the bathroom. There are no towels on the floor, which normally he would be glad about, but now it just means that Harry isn’t here. The laundry basket is almost empty, he doesn’t see the usual red of the auror robes. And then he sees the cup where they leave their toothbrushes. There’s only one. And somehow that makes it all too real.
His heart ached as he untangled himself from Draco and placed his head carefully on a pillow. “Harry,” Draco mumbled a slight smile on his lip. It is probably better for him that Harry leaves him now, it’ll hurt him less if he does it now.
“Yes, I’m fine.” She says with a smile.
“McLaren?” Theo steps next to Harry smiling at both him and Malfoy. “I spoke to him once at the leaky. Millie knows him from work, she’s a receptionist at the ministry as you probably know. And all he talked about was his son’s toad.” Theo snickers to himself. “But how are you guys doing? The only single ones left.”
“Draco where even are we?” Pansy asks as Draco struggles with his seatbelt.
“Someone who used to be at school with me.”
Hermione whose eyes have been ping ponging between Ron and Avery now looks at Harry, “What do you mean ‘Harry’s usual type’? I thought he didn’t date anyone in Romania.”
“Shut up!” Harry can’t help but snicker too. “At least they don’t know it’s you.”
He’s not able to stop the moans any longer and now there's noone here to hear them he let's them come out loud.
Harry pulls of off Draco, “Right, you’re right.” He stands up and holds out his hand for Draco. Confused he takes it, and Harry pulls him to his feet and drags him across the circle.
Harry kisses him. It tastes salty, Draco realises it’s because of his tears. Harry pulls of Draco’s shirt and tugs him towards the bed, their lips not parting. Once they reach the bed, Harry turns Draco around. He undoes his trousers and pulls it and his pants down at once. “I’m sorry. I’m sorry Draco,” whispers in his ear.
“Oh that. Yeah we broke up.”
“Daphne is Millie’s maid of honour and Blaise is Theo’s second best man.” Draco says as if that makes him less impressive.
Draco eagerly takes it form him, “Thanks.” It’s strange to Draco how freely Justin used his first name, but since this is the first friendly contact he has had with someone who’s not one of his friends he’ll try and be polite. “Thanks, Justin.” Justin smiles and turns back to his conversation with Ernie.
“What would I need help with, with Potter anyhow?”
“It was spontaneous! Whatever this is stupid. Nothing happened.”
Draco tsks at him, “That’s not an answer.”
Ronald falls down beside Blaise on his bed, “What are you reading?”
Draco gasps as Harry sucks on the sensitive skin on his neck, Harry’s hands trailing over his sides down to his ass. “Not your fault,” Draco manages to grasp out.
“Shut up Potter.”
“And may I remind you. That
“Come in!” he hears Robards say from the inside and he pushes the door open. “Aah Harry there you are. Good morning, I hope you had a pleasant trip back to jolly old England.” Robards says.
Hermione smiles and closes her book, “Want to leave to studying for now and go to Hogsmeade instead?”
Harry doesn’t say anything when he comes and casts a cleaning charm. Draco crawls into their bed, he looks up at Harry, “You’re still dressed?”
“Then don’t let me wake up alone.”
“I’m,” Draco hesitates, can he really have a normal conversation with Harry Potter, the chosen one, the hero of the wizarding world and his school nemesis in a muggle bar. “I’m actually meeting someone.”
Harry had said. Harry saw Cornelia street as his home.
“We know, that you actually mean I love you when you say I hate you. But Potter doesn’t”
there.
“Yes,” Draco smiles to himself. Harry was right, Draco loves to be cuddled. Draco relishes in attention, and he knows it. The heath of Harry’s embrace, the afterglow of the amazing sex, lulls Draco into sleep.
“Thank you.” Harry says.
Pansy and Blaise step through the door, shedding their coats and gloves. “How was the game?” Hermione asks them, not moving away from her position at Theo’s side. It makes his chest flutter.
“No, let me finish. That night, you told me that I’d leave you for Ginny. That’s what everyone’s been telling me. That Ginny and I would make up and get back together. Ron even said that there’s no one for me, but Ginny. Mrs. Weasley always tells me how happy she’ll be when she can finally welcome me officially into the family. And Hermione started talking about children, and how ours will go to Hogwarts together.”
“No Draco, we’re telling the truth.” Theo urges.
“Should we take a seat?” Michael says.
Blaise seems to be considering, he probably wonders what would be worse. “Dare.” He finally settles.
“He’ll be fine.” Pansy reassures him.
“Speaking of which,” Hermione says, “we should go to the church.” When they step outside Grimmauld, they apparate to a small church.
“Well that’s too bad. I was really looking forward to go out on the pitch.” Draco says just to satisfy her.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
“Like you were any better.” Blaise counters with a wistful smile on his face.
Draco stops inspecting Harry's sweaters for holes and looks up, “What?” he asks.
“Maybe I’ll meet you there later. Ron and I need to talk.”
“I’m sorry sir, but I don’t know what that has to do with me.”
“So, you want to break up Gryffindor’s golden couple. So, they’ll go out with Slytherins instead.
“What have you done to Draco?”
“When you play like that, it’s like you want me to win.” Blaise moves his bishop, “check.”
“I- fine,” Ronald says still flushed. “But only because it’s a bet.”
Draco watches Harry walk away before grabbing the chair up from the floor and turning back to his work. The tea and pastry Harry had brought him wait on the desk under a carefully cast warming charm.
“You really don’t want to know what we heard. Thank Merlin we didn’t see anything.” Greg says walking up to the couch and grabbing Pansy around her waist.
Draco spots Dan clutching his face just a few paces away. “What the fuck?” He shouts. At who, Draco doesn’t know.
Harry knows that voice and spins around, “Draco?!”
“White begins,” Blaise says with a smirk and makes his first move on the chessboard.
Blaise stops Theo with his arm.
Draco flushes and tries to down the sudden heat with a third of his cold pint.
“I- uh I. yeah.” Blaise manages to ground out.
“Then I dare Potter to kiss you.”
Draco shrugs again, “Lunch?”
“Fine than I dare you to kiss Potter.” Millicent retorts.
“Oh right, I forgot. You always make someone else eat. You don’t like to do it yourself and you shouldn’t have to the saviour, -”
Draco freezes and his mug falls from his hands.
When they finally pull apart Draco´s sure his hair´s a mess and there´s a bruise on his neck where here kissed him a bit too roughly. “I need to get back,” Harry mummers, “I´m quite sure I spend at least most of my break finding you in this maze of files.”
“I’m sorry, it’s just her kissing you after a lunch date you kept secret from me.”
Harry wanted to interrupt her and say that he wasn’t single, but she didn’t give him the space. And if she would have, she would have pressed him until he told her who it was, he was dating. And he wasn’t ready to tell her just yet. He needed to speak it through with Draco first.
Ron stalks past Blaise to get to the dorms, throwing him an apologetic smile as he passes.
“So, I was wondering,” Maurice starts, and Harry forces himself to focus on the man in front of him, “that you could help me since you’re head auror. I just came to England, and I have completed my auror training in Germany and I’m looking for a position.”
“Just help me with these clothes please Kreacher.” Harry sighs.
“Oh yes, right. That really looks like lunch.”
Hermione cups Theo’s face with both hands and kisses him hard on the lips.
Harry looks down at the black suit that he found in the back of a closet. “It’s the only thing I could find.”
“You have no idea.” Harry whispers in his ear as he turns Draco around and pulls of Draco’s jacket and sweater at the same time. His hands skimming Draco’s sides his lips sucking the sensitive skin on Draco’s neck. “I’ve missed you so much. That mission took way too long.”
“Okay so this is the plan.” The returning eight-year Slytherins are sitting on a couch in the common room. Well the 4 boys are sitting on it; Pansy is stalking before it lecturing them. “Theo, you will go up to Hermione and ask her some complicated question about some complicated subject. Then you’ll both go to the library to research, but more importantly have alone time and flirt.” Pansy fixes Theo with a look.
“Ahh,” an awful grin spreads on Draco’s face. The one he always gets when he gathers useful information. “But Potter and the Weaslette broke up months ago.”
Malfoy smiles along, “Rita truly was a fan of yours.”
“Auch,” Greg says faking offence.
“Potter will mope about it, trying to get Weasley to stay, because Draco’s here talking to us. But then,” Pansy pauses for effect. “Draco will ask Greg for some one on one Quidditch game. Greg will refuse and Draco will say, loudly, ‘but I wanted to play quidditch so bad.’” Pansy mimics Draco’s voice horribly.
Draco takes that opportunity to pull of Potter’s sweater and undershirt. Then he shrugs of his own, new, sweater. Potter helping him with the last bit.
And Draco tries. He really does. But the game just goes on without him. Sometimes a loud noise will advert his attention for a little while, but his gaze always finds its way back to Harry. His muscles ripple beneath his skin. Every time he stretches Draco gets a clear view of his stomach, six perfect little packs and a small strip of dark hair leading down into his pants. Pulling Draco's gaze lower. Then he feels guilty and flicks his eyes back to Harry's face, starting the whole process again.
They enter the great hall and start toward the Slytherin table. Blaise spots Draco alone at the table, with a perfect view of Potter. Staring at the chosen one like he always does.
“Hmh,” Harry mumbles against Draco’s lips, “We should do this more often.”
When they've finished eating Harry vanishes the empty packages and takes the empty plates with the cutlery down to the kitchen. When he comes back Draco has grabbed a bag and takes out various polos in shades of green and blue. “Try these on he says without looking at Harry.”
“Just,” he turns slightly so his feet rest on the ground and pushes of his shoes, “taking of my shoes.” He climbs back on Blaise’s bed and now that Blaise sits up, he realises how small his bed really is. “How did your conversation with Granger go?” He asks trying to get the situation back under his control. He’d known Ronald could get to him; he just hadn’t realised how much. Because he never really tried before. It’s intoxicating.
“They’re comfortable.” Harry mumbles as he snags a glass of wine from the tray of a passing waiter.
Blaise gets up from the couch, “Ronald,” he says steering away the Weasel’s attention from Theo. “Yesterday I bought and antique chess set. Want to see?”
“What?”
Right now he’s laying with his head on her lap and she’s trailing her fingers through his hair, just like she used to do back at Hogwarts. Greg is in the kitchen cleaning up after dinner. She tried to pry a name from him, but when he wouldn’t budge, she let it go and settled in on comforting him and force feeding him.
. To hell what his friends say. Ginny isn’t the one he’s supposed to be with. The one meant for him is standing right in front of him twirling a potion bottle between his long fingers, a pout on his handsome face. His hair perfectly styled. He sees it now.
“At least we can blame it on our jobs.” Malfoy smirks, “Head auror and master healer. We don’t have time for relationships.”
“I really don’t want to know anything about it.”
Potter looks at him, his green eyes burning into his, “Okay.” The car drives away, as if the streetlights pointed in an arrowhead leading them home.
Harry clears his throat, “Yeah, yeah sure.”
“Draco?”
Draco takes a deep breath, “I love you!” he screams for whatever he’s worth, “Isn’t that the worst thing you ever heard?”
“Draco-”
Ronald is a challenge. One that Blaise would love to win. If the redhead just gave a change to play.
“Draco,” Harry starts.
“Draco please. I know I probably have no right, but please drink this so we can have a proper conversation.” Harry holds out a bottle of hangover potion.
Harry nods, trailing his hands over Draco’s bare chest, leaving Goosebumps in his wake. “You’re hot. So beautiful like this.”
Dan scowls but steps back, “If you change your mind, Draco. Call me.”
that I would wake up confused and upset. Exactly like you promised you would never do. You promised. The very first night you slept with me. That’s is really the thing I can’t understand. Why? Why did you sleep with me?”
Hermione raises an eyebrow at him.
“Dare.”
“Auch Greg,” Blaise says, grinning. As Draco sits back down on the bench.
“Draco,” Michael snakes an arm around Draco’s waist, “Who are you talking to?”
“How do they even know this!” Harry throws the latest prophet on the dinner table next to where Draco’s reading his potions magazine. Draco glances over to read the headline.
Draco scoffs, “I was the one that wanted to be friends.” Draco starts sorting through the pile in front of him. “I can tell the wrong sort for myself thanks.” He mimics a high whiny voice.
Red splotches return on Draco’s face and neck, “No! This is what I mean!”
Maurice nods, “Yes, and he’s been such a help since I’ve arrived in England.”
“Yes, Ginny asked me on New year’s.” Luna says as she smiles up at Ginny lovingly.
“Hey?!” Weasley says still in that high voice. “You’re sleeping with Malfoy?!”
“Before Luna and Ginny are getting married there’s the wedding from Dean and Seamus and Millicent and Theo and later this year Gregory and Susan are getting married. And then there’s Michael and Padma and Blaise and Lavender. And Parvatti is marrying a guy from Beauxbatons, his names is Pierre if I remember correctly. And of course Neville is marrying Hannah. Oh and Ronald your mother did tell me about Avery you know. Are you guys planning on marrying this year?”
“What?” Harry says arching a brow.
“He’s just drunk Pans.” Greg reassures his fiancé.
“I’m done talking.”
“Among other things.” Harry grabs Draco’s hips and pulls him against him. “There’s only one thing that makes me doubt.”
“I told him I loved him. I love him Pansy. And he still left me. He left me!” His hair sticks to his tearstained face.
“Keep me away from here.”
“Yeah, well then you should have let me start the game.” Weasley laughs.
“We could change that,” Padma Patil says, “I’ll snog Draco if you dare me to.” She glances shyly at Draco and Harry’s hand tightens around Draco’s thigh. Or is that just his imagination?
“Babe?” Ron asks, “Why are you asking so many questions?”
“Draco, I will make up for all of it. I swear I will.”
“Welcome to my world.” Ronald says.
After a few snogging sessions of various couples, Pansy gets up. “This is boring! It’s like spin the bottle without all the tension, because only people who like each other are snogging.”
year Ravenclaws sitting nearby hear him. Hermione flushes red. It’s clear she doesn’t appreciate Weasley making such inuendoes in public. But with a soft smile at Theo she led Weasley to a small empty table. It’s not particularly private but it’s clearly a table for two.
“Hey! Greg doesn’t look like that.” Pansy objects from the couch, her feet resting in Greg’s lap. “Greg looks more like he’s ready to pass out.”
When she walks away Draco asks Harry how he found this place.
“No, you didn’t.”
“Oh, that’s too bad. He’s talking about
Harry starts to take of his clothes. His tan skin covers smooth muscles, a few scars are scattered across his body. Draco wishes he could study them up close, but he can hardly crawl across the floor and start studying his body.
“Done?”
Harry hadn’t seen Draco Malfoy after his hearing before the Wizengamot four years ago. He hadn’t expected seeing Draco Malfoy again. And even if he had, he certainly hadn’t expected seeing Draco Malfoy again at his friend’s birthday party. Especially not Luna Lovegood’s birthday party. The girl who had spent a while in Draco Malfoy’s cellar. Most of all he hadn’t expected Draco Malfoy chatting with one of Harry’s best friends, Hermione Granger, the girl he used to curse out and belittle.
Harry gasps, there’s Draco. And he looks so, so good.
“You can mend it in the morning.” Harry says as he pushes Draco down on the sheets and shoves of his own shoes.
“Maybe we should go away together sometime?” Harry says suddenly.
"Yeah.... How is it you know everything?"
Malfoy snorts, “Don’t count on it. She bothers everyone. I can’t even read the Prophet anymore.”
Theo glances around. People are milling about the entrance, some going in others going out. This doesn’t seem like the ideal spot for this conversation, so he proposes to go somewhere a bit more private.
“Yeah when you beat me twice, I realised you were really something. You know, now one really beat me since I was eleven.”
“What even are you doing?” Harry steps closer to him.
Blaise whistles, “Looking good. Are you going out?”
Granger runs down the stairs a bag swung around her and books in her arms, “Ready?” she asks Theo. He nods eagerly and they start toward the door.
The rest of the dinner passes in a blur. Somehow Draco manages not to moan with every bite. But Harry hadn’t managed not to look smug all through dinner. They shared a dessert because Draco insisted, he was full, but he still managed to eat most of it.
Pansy squeals and Draco jumps up surprised.
“What?! No, I didn’t. When would I have done that? And why would I buy this much?” Harry looks round his living room which seems to be stuffed with bags.
“Great choice.” She says before taking their menus and walking away.
“Oh we’re back here again are we?” Harry laughs. “Seriously it wasn’t that bad!”
“If Harry wants a date to the weddings, I know this guy who works on Diagon near George's shop. He’s nice and blonde.” Ron argues, “I can introduce you mate!” Ron says enthusiastically.
Harry curls around Draco, pushing his face into his neck. “Yeah it was.”
“Told you everyone wanted to kiss your pretty face.” Pansy says, leaning over Blaise’s lap, who’s smirking cruelly at Draco.
“Colin Creevey, the kid that followed you around all the time at Hogwarts?”
Harry looks quizzingly at Ron, “Why not.”
“Yeah,” Theo says gathering his parchments. “I was wondering, I mean maybe if you’re free. We could, you know, go to the library to answer these questions together?”
“Why?” Pansy turns around and takes his face in her hands, “I’m sure there’s no one here who wouldn’t want to kiss that pretty face of yours love.” She drops her hands to his wrists and pull him along towards the circle that Lavender and Padma are urging everyone in. Pansy drops Draco next to Blaise, “You two sit down and participate. I don’t know why I didn’t insist on you two coming earlier.” She spins around and stalks to Lavender and Padma.
“See Ron’s busy. I’m busy Malfoy wants to play quidditch and you’re not doing anything.” Granger says. “Unless you rather study?”
Blaise shakes his head again. “No. You.”
“So Draco.” Dan whispers in his ear.
“We were. Then he left me after fucking me.” Draco downs his drink, “Literally not figuratively.” He waves at the waitress for another drink.
“Potter.”
“Truth or dare?” Draco loves his friend, but it’s time for him to stop moping around. And this is the time for Draco to force him to take action.
“I- uh, I think I’m just going to go.” Draco says, when he steps away from Potter.
“You should listen more often to your girlfriend, little sis.” Ron says with a smirk as Harry pulls the package from his pocket. He spells it back to its original size before handing it to Luna, “We hope you like it.” He says with a soft smile.
“I’m jealous of Greg getting a shag too. Speaking of, Draco are you up for a seeker game?”
When Pansy, Greg and Blaise showed up at the party, Harry’s heart sped up. Did that mean Draco was here? If he was here, Harry didn’t think he could fake not being in love with him. However, he wanted to see Draco badly. He hadn’t realised he missed Draco this much until he came so close to seeing him again. But he didn’t spot the recognizable blond hair.
“Merlin Draco.” She pulls him back in her embrace, “Who did this to you?”
“Girlfriend?! I thought you two were together.”
“Oh, now I just have to know. Spit it out Gregory.” Blaise says smirking.
Draco presses his face against Harry´s neck to muffle his cries.
“Really.” Draco and Potter say at the same time. Glance at each other, both smirking.
Harry takes a deep breath, “I’m sorry, but you were wrong.”
“Wow, Malfoy. You really have changed.”
“Merlin Draco,” Potter says training is fingers through Draco’s hair. The use of his first name makes something in his chest flutter.
“The know-it-all? Great my friends have to worst taste in lovers.” Draco sighs
Theo snaps his quill in half.
“Are you sure? Because it seemed like you and Weasley were off to have a tough conversation.”
“Why?” Harry looks sad that he isn’t kissing anymore, and it sends a thrill through Draco.
“Really?”
“Well yes of course Ronnie ponnie!” Ginny says,  “Don’t tell the others but you are my favourite brother.”
"I'm not!" Theo objects, "I was just wondering. Besides how do you know it's not going well with Hermione and me?"
Justin smiles quickly and turns to Ernie MacMillen on his other side.
“Do you want to know or not?” Blaise asks.
“You’re just sad that we don’t spend all our attention on you anymore.” Greg says while he’s filling his plate.
“Well Pansy and Blaise were going on about how hot you and Greg look in quidditch robes. How that’s the best part of the quidditch. So, I wondered if that’s true and maybe I’ll finally enjoy quidditch too.”
“No, what happened is you had a date without me. And what is stupid is that cheap, ginger, hobbit of a girl. Who probably only wants to sleep with you now that her pathetic quidditch career is over!”
“Just this morning” Ron says. “We dropped our bags at Grimmauld and then came straight here.”
“You can see that. It has holds under both armpits.” Draco grabs his wand and vanishes both the pile of throw aways and the one he was looking through, “All of them seem to have holes in there somewhere. Seriously, Potter how can you have kept them for so long. Did they never give you clothes when you were growing up or something?” Draco asks as he accios a pile of hoodies and sweaters.
Theo nods, “right.” He turns his attention back on the parchment in front of him and tries to swallow the bile in his throat. Normally Theo relishes in the silence of the Library, but right now all he can hear is the pounding in his chest and his own thoughts looping through his head;
“That’s what I’ve been telling you in all my letters.” Hermione smirks. “And don’t worry Ron. I’m sure you’ll like Pansy once you get to know her. She has the same sense of humour as you do.”
Draco chuckles, “I don’t think he had ever seen someone with such a lack of fashion sense.”
“You’re saying Potter’s your weak part?”
“But I didn’t say dare.”
Theo flushes, his light complexion makes him look as red as a strawberry. ‘I- Not that, but I-” he stammers, “I would like to get to know Hermione better. More than just a friendship, yes.”
Avery.”
“Well, I also want more.”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draco knows that if he’d look over to his friend, he’d see a blush on his cheeks, even through his dark complexion. But Draco doesn’t dare glance that way, because Harry’s fingers started moving over his leg and Draco’ll need on all his concentration to keep a straight face and not to make any strange noises.
“Not the girl one.” Theo adds.
Everyone around him sighs, “Don’t even try to deny it Draco.” Pansy says, “You have it the worse.”
Dan runs his finger over Draco’s jaw, turning his gaze away from Harry to himself. He wets his lips and presses them against Draco’s. Draco jumps away in shock, “What are you doing?!”
“Morning to you too, Draco.” Blaise says as he scoops some scrambled eggs on his plate.
“Well, not yet.”
Draco flushes all over, he didn’t know he was being so obvious.
Harry rolls off Draco, then turns to the side and looks at Draco. Harry’s green eyes always seem to look into Draco. He reaches out to push some stray hairs out of Draco’s face before cupping his head and pulling him close for a kiss. It seems like Harry tries to convey all his feelings in this kiss, it lingers and is full of love.
“I wasn’t glaring,” Draco mumbles.
was planning on sucking his cock. But sure. He’d rather speak with you.”
Hermione and Avery exchange a look like they want to object, but Ron nods understandingly, “And it’s not Malfoy.” He says to his girlfriend.
“Besides Ron and I have been dating since the summer and we’ve always been confused about our relationship. But we’ve wanted to try and at Hogwarts we had more space away from each other and re-met some people and both of us realised we’re just friends.
Draco wants to say, but he knows he can’t tell her. Pansy would tell him how stupid he was, thinking he could date Harry Potter. Falling in love with Harry
Draco stares in horror at Millicent, “What?” he manages to choke out.
Theo ignores him and continues. “But he’s dating Hermione-”
“That was a beautiful ceremony.” Draco states as he hands Harry a glass of champagne.
King’s Cross was as busy as ever. Sharply dressed businessmen and women stalked past carrying briefcases and heavy-looking shoulder bags. Mothers chased their small children as they darted through the throngs of people and ducked under legs. Harry walked with Ron and Hermione, with Ginny laughing loudly with Luna and Neville up ahead, as they pushed their carts and tried to navigate through the crowded platforms. Hedwig twittered nervously and ruffled her feathers in her cage as Harry’s cart hit a bump.
“Hey, uh, guys,” Harry said, clearing his throat awkwardly, “I’m feeling pretty tired, I think I’m gonna turn in early.” His friends all narrowed their eyes at him but opted to say nothing. All except Ginny that is.
"Of course," he said after a moment. "Now come on, Mrs. Weasley has probably had breakfast ready for an hour," he chuckled, noticing Draco was already settling back into bed.
"See, you're learning!" he exclaimed as he trailed behind the Draco, their fingers interlocked between them. They would talk about the visions and the voice later, Harry thought to himself with conviction. Not now. Not while Draco's happy and his eyes are shining with mirth. Not while his beautiful white blond hair, usually so precisely styled, is slightly mussed from sleep and kissing.
“Hi,” Draco said simply.
―Eleanor Roosevelt
"Ha! Says the one that I just carried down the stairs!" he countered.
“Father’s going to be released in a couple of months,” he said flatly, at which Harry frowned. “Good behavior,” Draco followed up.
“He’s doing better. He owled the other day, only one nightmare and some mild pain since…he, uh, passed out,” he replied. Draco had apparated back to Malfoy Manor two weeks before the start of school. Narcissa was under the impression that he was traveling with Blaise Zabini and Theodore Nott and he knew he needed to get back before she became suspicious, and… he wanted to be with his mother. Lucius being sent to Azkaban after the whole Ministry fiasco was wearing on her more than she’d ever admit. “Well, that’s good, right?” He heard Hermione saying as his mind flashed back to the conversation they’d had after Draco was able to relive the fainting ordeal without panicking.
“Bedroom,” he mumbled. Pulling Harry in again the pair began to make their way clumsily up the narrow stone staircase. Harry’s back hit the door, then they were moving again until his knees hit the side of Draco’s mattress. Hands were everywhere, both boys taking the liberty of mapping out every inch of the other’s body under their fingertips, the sounds of heavy breathing and quiet moans filling the room. Draco kissed his way down Harry’s jaw, moving to latch his mouth onto the infuriatingly beautiful dark skin of his neck, sucking a dark bruise there. Harry groaned lightly, relishing in the feeling when he remembered something.
Curiosity had bloomed in Hermione's dark features, but she all she said in reply was, "Oh, well, feel better then."
George clapped Harry on the back laughing. "Atta boy, Harry," he said and Harry couldn't help but grin, cheeks still on fire.
"Yeah, just a… little headache. I'll catch right up," had been Draco's reply. "Now go," he shooed. Harry had laughed, uneasy and slightly skeptical, but decided not to push, and after a chaste kiss, he jogged back to his friends.
Harry laughed, a deep rumbling sound, and Draco felt the vibration as their chests pressed together. “Come on, Blondie,” he huffed, still keening under the attention Draco was showing his neck, his earlobe. “As much as I… as much as I love… this,” he turned his head to capture the other boy’s full lips in a short, but scathing kiss, “as much as I love this it sounded important” he rushed out causing Draco to still again momentarily. Silver eyes flicked away and back to green quickly.
"Mmhm," Harry hummed, eyes closed with laughter, "Your father would love to hear all about this. Why don't you tell him about last night too, huh? In the garden? I'm sure he'd love to hear about tha-" He stopped dead and Draco gave a small noise of disapproval as his body jerked in the awkward position. The entire Weasley clan and Hermione had their eyes turned toward the couple. Arthur and Molly in shock, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny in amusement and poor Ron in unbridled horror. Harry dropped Draco unceremoniously back onto his feet, both boys' faces flaming.

“You like it? Thought I’d try it short,” she remarked.
"Fred, George!" He shouted frantically to the group who was already running nearer, faces painted with worry and confusion. "Help me levitate him.
Narcissa was already leaving, having only come to the platform to hug and kiss Draco goodbye until Christmas. Draco watched her retreating form, back straight as ever, but somehow he could see the physical weight on her shoulders, not that she would let anyone know or even suspect it was there. He sighed and tore his eyes away, then began to move swiftly through the crowd, trying hard to navigate through the throngs of witches and wizards. After a minute, a shock of bright red hair appeared in the corner of his eye. He smiled lightly and started to make his way toward the small group, using the two ginger heads like a lighthouse in the dark. As he approached, Harry caught his eye and his smile widened.
"In your dreams, baby sis," came one of the twins' reply. He laughed lightly looking out at the scene before him. They were all going out to play a little Quidditch. Fred and George, Ron, Ginny, and Harry all racing over the hilly terrain to the open field where they planned to play, brooms in hand, throwing their heads back and shaking with laughter. It made Draco smile fondly.
He kept walking, taking measured breaths to try to calm his migraine. Something flashed in the corner of his eye, black and blurry. Draco whipped his head in the direction of the shadow, only met with rolling green hills shrouded in the golden hue of the late morning sun. Closing his eyes, he breathed in deeply, trying to clear his head.
Draco sighed now, adjusting his grip on the broom he was holding. He couldn't see Hermione from where he was walking; he assumed she must be much farther ahead.
“That’s not all,” the blonde cut him off quickly, closing his eyes. “Mother insisted I accompany her to Borgin and Burke’s, there were others there. They want me to help him, Harry,” he rushed out, growing more and more frantic, “they want me to be one of them, I know I have the mark but I didn’t choose this, I didn’t want any of this I didn’t--” he broke off with a shuddering breath as arms quickly came around him holding him fiercely. Harry was shushing him, running one of his hands through his white blonde hair. Draco balled his fists in the front of Harry’s sweater and allowed his head to fall into the crook of the other boy’s neck.
"He was there? Are you sure it was him?" Harry asked tentatively.
"Congratulations, sweetheart," his mother crooned, caressing his white blond hair and lifting her chin to soak in the praise.
“Because I could practically smell the gay on you before I even walked into the station!” another voice entirely called out.
"Lucius," she hissed at her husband who had been talking quietly with Rudolphus Lestrange. "Lucius, come quick. It's beginning." After a beat, a dark smile crossed the wizard's face and, ceasing his previous conversation entirely, he swiftly crossed the room to where his son sat in a great curving armchair. One by one, the guests that filled the sitting room of Malfoy Manor came to circle around the boy.
They sat side by side on the bed now, the blonde still breathing deeply from the previous assault. Harry reached out his hand and grasped Draco’s, their dark and pale skin starkly contrasted even in the low light of the dungeon bedroom. Harry searched the face of his boyfriend for a minute in silence, letting the other boy catch his breath. He could see the stress on him, his elegant features pulled taut as a bowstring, eyebrows pinched, grey eyes looking far off in thought. He swiped his thumb across the pale back of Draco’s hand.
"Ew, come off it, George, that's my best mate!" Ron whined, only half serious. Harry laughed and squeezed Draco's hand underneath the table. He look around at the chaotic lot. Arthur talking excitedly to Molly about his most recent Muggle raid, the twins arguing over who gets the last piece of bacon, and Ron, Hermione and Ginny all laughing about some anecdote or another. His heart constricted. They had been so kind when he had first brought Draco to the Burrow with him. It made his heart ache with love- so much love- remembering how they had made Draco feel so welcomed and at home, just like they had for him all those years ago.
"I bloody love you too, Scarhead," he replied lacing their fingers under the table. Like tumblers in a lock.
"Another nightmare…?" Harry asked after another beat of quiet. Draco nodded into the crook of his neck. "Do you… do you want to talk about it?" Draco sucked in a breath and let it out shakily.
“Draco,” he managed to huff out, voice cracking, “didn’t you… didn’t… didn’t you need to tell me something?”
"Harry," Draco breathed. In a blink, there were strong arms enveloping him, holding him up. Draco buried his face in the crook of Harry's neck and breathed in deep allowing the strong, familiar scent of pine and treacle tart and something distinctly
"Stop." Harry's firm and commanding, yet gentle, voice cut through his nervous rambling and Draco's head snapped in the other boy's direction. "You can stop now, it's alright," he said steadying Draco's hands with his own. Their eyes met, green to grey, and Draco saw the pain that Harry's held. This affected him too. "We can talk about it later, if you're up for it. After you've had a little time to process." Draco nodded his head and Harry reached up to place a kiss on his forehead. A small smile made its way onto Draco's face. Swinging his legs up, he laid them over Harry's lap. With Harry's arm still around him and his head tucked underneath the other boy's chin, Draco felt safe, if only for this moment. Suddenly a very bushy-haired Hermione poked her head around the corner.
“So how’s Malfoy, mate,” Ron asked beside him as they neared the entrance to Platform 9 ¾. Harry sucked in a breath and nodded his head.
“Gay?” Ginny piped up, looking thoughtful. Even intrigued.
"Draco," Harry muttered darkly, "come on, love, wake up." He tapped Draco's cheek lightly with his hand; nothing. His throat constricted as leant down to check for breath and a part of his mind was relieved and overjoyed to find he wasn't dead.
"Merlin, Granger!" he protested, his skull giving a painful throb.
"That is true," Ginny said next to her.
“Oh, Draco I’m sor―"
“Whatever,” she sing-songed, snagging a roasted potato on her fork, “have fun shagging your boyfriend, oh Chosen One.” Immediately there was a chorus of lewd catcalls and dog whistles from the boys and he fought to keep his blush under control, scoffing.
Draco clenched his jaw and smiled a tight smile.
Suddenly two strong hands were gripping Draco’s hips and flipping him over. Nose pressed against the hollow of Draco’s throat, Harry pinched lightly at the other boy’s side causing him to jerk and cry out in that special mix of anguish and laughter that only tickling can elicit.
Draco hissed in a breath as fine lines began to swirl to life in his skin, the inky black cutting a stark contrast against the pale of his arm. More lines began to surface, finally taking the ominous shape of the Dark Mark, prominent on his skin. An excitable murmur broke out among the small crowd of people as Lucius placed his hand firmly on his son's shoulder, relishing in the praise and attention the family of three was receiving.
He groaned again and stood up to stretch his admittedly sore frame, when a figure jerked to life in an armchair in the corner.
"Draco?" rasped a voice as the figure stood running a hand through thick, black hair.
“Yep,” Zabini said, oblivious, popping the p. “She might as well have the word ‘lesbian’ tattooed on her forehead.”
"Pain," he muttered at last. "There was a lot of pain. In my head and my… my arm." His fingers ghosted subconsciously over the twisted snake on his left forearm. Harry was quiet beside him. He continued, not wanting to go back now. "But before the pain, there was a… shadow. I caught it out of the corner of my eye, but then it just- it wasn't there anymore." He had begun to wring his hands together, a nervous habit he hadn't done since he was a child and his parents would talk to him about the Dark Lord. "And when I had finally convinced myself it was nothing, it appeared right in front of me. It was the figure from my nightmares. And his voice was in my head. It was in my head, Harry, and I- I couldn't escape it- I couldn't-"
“I’m glad you guys came too; these games are always more fun with more people.” Justin Flinch – Fletchy says as he comes to sit down next to Draco.
Potter now standing alone, looking a bit lost grabs Granger arm, “‘Mione,” he whines, throwing a look at the couch. Granger follows his gaze and sighs.
was there.”
Blaise smirks, “You’re a sore loser.”
“Bye!” Michael shouts, slamming the taxi door close.
Malfoy chuckles, “Don’t worry Potter. The people still worship you.”
"Yes Potter. Look at them."
The curtains are pulled open and Granger and Weasley stare at them. “You did.” Harry says. Then he turns to his friends. “Hey.”
Harry chuckles, “I was thinking we could go after Christmas and celebrate New year’s together by sending it between the sheets?”
“What do you mean? You haven’t been here since when?”
"What-"
They pull apart slightly. Draco stares into Potter’s bright green eyes, lust gleaming in them, his glasses askew on his face. “Now you’re not glaring.” Potter says ruining the moment.
It came out as more of a whisper than he wanted, but he could tell by Remus' face that Sirius had heard him, the brunette giving him a soft smile and nod, murmuring something about him getting Harry to bed.
In that moment, Harry knew that there was one thing on his mental list that he was completely and utterly sure of.
Draco couldn't help but let out a snort of amusement, obviously much to his boyfriend's disapproval, as this seemed to earn him a stern glare. They could hear a hushed conversation out in the hallway, Remus obviously having been tempted by his husband's revelation, and managed to pick out
groaned, in sync, Harry now resorting to slamming his head against his wall.
"I wish I'd met him."
Draco was staring back at him, panting slightly, wide-eyed and full of embarrassment.
"Watch the time. I want you to come as soon as it hits the hour and not a moment before, understood?"
There seemed to be a moment of silence, followed by a reluctant sigh, before there was a soft knock against Harry's door.
of a smirk on his face, which still made Harry flush from ear to toe.
"Was it because of what I said this morning?"
The boy only hummed, but seemed to agree, as he swiftly pulled Draco's pants down, just enough so that his erection was free. He was obviously on a mission, because it was barely a second before he was wrapping his slick lips around the tip.
"Fuck, Harry, if you're going to pull me into a classroom to suck me off, don't fucking tease me."
Harry pushed open the right door, not bothering to kick it shut before wrapping his arms around Draco from behind, peppering kisses along the side of his neck. The blonde sighed, tracing his fingers over Harry's hands on his stomach.
"Pass one here," Draco exclaimed, locking eyes with his cousin, who only smirked and nodded, throwing the packet into his lap. The blonde slotted one between his teeth and lit it, in the same way Sirius always did, with a snap of his fingers.
he'd told Harry that he was going to stay for the feast that night and work on a new potion afterwards, specifying that he shouldn't wait up for him.
Draco's eyebrow rose further and his wand halted between his fingers. "You can last thirteen minutes? Right now, you look pretty desperate."
Draco hummed in soft agreement, wrapping his arms around Harry's waist and pulling him flush against his body. "I can get on board with that idea. What did you have in mind?"
"Thirteen minutes."
Draco's grip on his hips tightened and his pace quickened, something that Harry didn't think was possible, before he managed a response. "You're going to wait for me to come inside you, and then it's your turn. Understand?"
They stepped off of the train, together, Harry making a point to keep his hand where it was on the blonde's waist. In all honesty, Draco wasn't used to the stares
"I'm not lying! Every time I saw you, when you were a baby, I just knew."
Draco hummed in response, obviously happy with his reply. He stretched his legs out before swinging them over the side of the bed, finally untying  his shoes. Lately, Draco had taken to wearing a pair of black Dr Martens boots with green laces, that he'd impulsively bought in the summer, and Harry couldn't be happier. He loved the way they looked on him, the way hey were the exact thing his father would've hated. Weirdly, they made him,
The feeling of Draco's hands travelling down the small of his back to his arse made Harry gasp, but he quickly settled into the feeling of Draco kneading the delicate skin, thumb teasing down his crease. Slowly, Draco lowered his head to swipe his tongue across Harry's arse, smiling at the moan it pulled from him. He made quick work of delving into his hole, lapping his up like an excited child, all while preparing him.
"Is this really how we're starting sex?" Harry rolled his eyes and nodded, urging Draco to talk about his day. Once he realised that his husband was being serious, Draco relaxed into Harry's touch and started talking about his day. "Everything just felt so out of control. Half of my Gryffindors were hungover this morning, some of my first years made their cauldrons explode and then I ended up in the bloody commemoration hallway, by accident. They still all have a lot of things to say about my decisions," he sighed, letting go of everything that had been on his mind all day.
"I'll see you later, I have to run. Love you."
"Is that not what you want?"
to process his boyfriend's words, the blonde was turning on his heels and closing the door behind him. He hurried down the stairs, flushing slightly as the eyes of the Gryffindor common room followed him to the portrait hole, but he was used to it by now.
Harry chuckled softly. "Well, what's been stressing you out today?"
They finally arrived at Kings Cross, the sky already pitch black as the train shuddered to a halt. Draco shifted Harry off of his shoulder, giving his hand a gentle squeeze to try and wake him up.
Remus rolled his eyes and patted his husband's knee, taking into account the way he was clutching his beer bottle like it was a lifeline and was slurring his words. "You can't tell that someone's gay when they're a baby, Padfoot."
them. Maybe that was what he needed to do, just definitely in a different way to how he showed his friends that he loved them.
"Draco I-, are you sure?"
It was then that Harry opened his eyes and looked up at him, emerald eyes seeming to bore into the blonde's soul.
, it'll be fine. They always go out every Christmas Eve-Eve, Sirius insists, the sap he is."
touch me. Let me come."
"Yes,
"Don't say things like that, you'll give me a heart attack."
Unfortunately, Harry spent most of the day having not even the faintest clue to where his boyfriend was. He knew he was busy, their schedules barely overlapping and the blonde having prefect duties to attend to, but it still made his stomach turn.
Draco threw him an equally dopey smile as he worked carefully to release his wrists, stopping to place a soft kiss against the pale skin that covered his veins. "Thank you, love, I feel a lot better now," he whispered, wrapping himself around Harry. His husband smiled against his shirt, sighing at the feeling of Draco placing a kiss against his hair.
The blonde bent down and grabbed the packet from the floor, where it had landed, and threw it right back at the adult, who gave him a look that simply said
After kicking them under his own bed, and dropping his robes onto his mattress, Draco soon returned to Harry, curling up into his side more comfortably. He stared up at him, liking the faint sense of a smile that played on his lips.
There it was, that signature Draco
He simply nodded, running one of his thumbs over the smooth skin of the boy's cheek, pushing his glasses back up to the bridge of his nose. Softly, he placed a kiss against Harry's lips, lingering for just a moment, before pulling back an inch.
That was how Harry had found himself sat in his office, doing paperwork with Draco, with a vibrator up his arse. One that Draco could control, for that matter.
"Touché, Weasley."
Harry simply looked between his two guardians, nodding slowly, but not losing eye-contact. "Four months," he muttered, before either of them could ask anymore questions. He punctuated his statement by holding his eye-contact with both men, firmly.
Once he was sure they were gone, Harry flung the door open, head whipping to the opposite direction that they had turned. "Draco, it's all good," he whispered, smiling as he watched the blonde come out from his hiding place. He immediately received a slap on his forearm, letting his boyfriend in and slamming the door, again.
"Absolutely. I'll wait for you, no matter how long."
Draco shut the door with just a bit too much force, but he couldn't bring himself to focus on that, he'd had on of the worst days for a long time. All down to his students. Usually, Draco loved his job. He was so grateful to be offered the position, he loved his students (even if he pretended he didn't) and he loved the fact that he got to come up with new ways to make potions exciting, but everyone had been testing him that day.
. It never quite went away, even when he was pinned between his boyfriend's thighs, until he was truly and completely defiled.
Once they were in the kitchen, Harry locked eyes with Sirius, who was perched at the table, watching them over the rim of his coffee mug. He only grinned and raised a single eyebrow, pulling a groan from both teenagers.
Everything was so calm around the group that it was odd to remember the reason they were all in this situation, but nobody seemed to be complaining. Harry was just quietly enjoying himself, absentmindedly sipping his beer as he felt the comfort of drowsiness creeping through his body, fully settling into his position against his boyfriend's shoulder. Remus was sat slightly slumped over, legs resting over his husband's lap, and seemed to also be enjoying himself, even though he was probably just past tipsy. Sirius and Draco, who seemed to be equal levels of
"It's that type of tour, is it?"
"Something wrong, love?" If looks could kill, Draco would be six feet under by now but no, he was still seated across from Harry, paperwork duly ignored and smug smirk on his face.
Didn't hear th-
"Hey," Harry whispered, squeezing his knee, gently. "You're thinking too much. I don't know what about, but you're doing too much of it, relax. It's Christmas!"
"I'm glad. Now, how about that movie?"
The couple behind
Their conversations went from short and polite, to drawn-out and detailed. Their free lessons went from separate studying in different rooms to Draco helping him with his potions, Harry finding it increasingly harder to concentrate when Draco rolled his sleeves up or loosened his tie. Their nights went from deafening silence, to soft pants and the sound of their lips moving against each other.
Draco's thoughts stuttered as he felt his boyfriend wrap his lips around his length, looking up at him through his lashes, ridiculous smirk tugging at his lips. He swirled his tongue around the tip, lapping back and forth over his slit, hands splayed across his thighs to keep him still.
bastard.
Draco nodded and dropped his butt in the empty beer bottle, urging Harry to stand up and supporting him with an arm around his waist. Just before he lugged his boyfriend back to his own room, Draco leant down slightly and placed a hand on his cousin's shoulder, in a moment of surprising sobriety.
The blonde looked at him, something like disbelief painted across his features. "Of course, you git. You're sure it's okay though? Not 100% sure I'm ready for a conversation that starts with
"Mm, I'm just going to miss you, that's all," he whispered, eyes focussing on his own hand. Harry wanted to reply, of course he did, wanted to tell him he'd miss him too, wanted to kiss his stupid face off until he forgot his own name. He didn't, though. Better to listen, to let Draco say what he wanted to say, then it'd be time for kissing. "I didn't think that
