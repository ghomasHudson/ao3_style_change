“Well, this means we might have to stay till after five,” Potter said quietly. Draco was sure he and Smith’s groans could be heard throughout the entire DMLE. Mona had still said nothing.
“I’m in the right mindset now, Potter,” He whispered. Harry gaped at him, before smiling in slight disbelief, tugging Draco back in for another kiss.
“And you’ll be alright there, Harry? It’s not too late to back out- or maybe it is, but McGonagall would understand,”
Draco stumbled out of the 8th year boy’s dorm and into the common room. His body warm from sleep, hair rumbled up and falling into his eyes. Clad in one of Harry’s old jumpers, sweatpants and large socks, Draco gracefully plopped himself down onto one of the couches, letting his head fall back as he tried to keep his eyes open.
Harry’s eyes flashed with concern and sympathy and he nodded. The train whistle blew and Scorpius stepped through the door and luckily spotted Hugo already in a compartment. It was only his 2cnd year, but Scorpius was already used to the several bullies who thought it funny that his father was the arithmancy professor and his step-dad the defense professor. At first his fathers had tried to punish the students, but that only made the bullying worse and Scorpius had pleaded them to stop. His other teachers were aware of the bullies though, and never hesitated to take points or give detentions to them if something happened.
ok I'm shit at magical theory forgive me for this guys. Also get ready for some major bromance between Ron and Harry, also all-knowing and scheming Andromeda and Narcissa (sorry this one took longer to get out to you guys I'll try to post faster!) lots of love - Taline
He didn’t stop until they reached the car that was waiting to pick them up after the event. He pushed Draco into the car and followed after him, telling the driver to take a different route home as to not be followed. Draco was still unconscious, and Harry spotted a pin prick on the back of his neck, by the looks of it they had only drugged him with a tranquilizer.
“Well we weren’t that close back then Potter, do you remember how mad I got when one of your students set the pixies loose?”
The reporters had gone into a frenzy as he walked into building, shouting inquiries about his sexuality, and if he was in a relationship with Justin. He seemed a bit nervous, and Harry gave his arm a reassuring squeeze as they stepped into the hall the Weasley’s had rented for the wedding. Harry smiled at Justin before walking over to take his place at the head table beside Neville, who was Luna’s best man. They both gave their speeches that had half of the guests in fits of laughter, and the other crying from the emotional parts.
Draco wasn’t an idiot, he could catch the way Harry looked at him, how he smiled at him when Draco walked into a room. But he didn’t want to get his hopes up, he feared rejection greatly. Both parties had to be infatuated with one another in order for the classrooms to move, at least that’s what
“Alright I’m coming, I’m coming,” Draco said, prepared for a night of bad Muggle television, Bun on his lap, and the heavy weight that was Potter in his mind.
She was his best friend, and even though their marriage was arranged, he wouldn’t pick anyone else to be his wife.
Harry snorted and chuckled before he went back to his class. “Tell anyone you want, the review guide is still due Monday,” he smirked as they groaned and he began to start his lesson.
Draco knew that this meant Harry had to feel something for him, but then why hadn’t he done anything already?
“Draco,” Theo spoke to him calmly, “Explain,” Draco shook his head and raised his head to meet Theo and Ron’s gaze.
After a couple of seconds Hugo shouted “All clear!” and Scorpius let the blanket fall to the floor. His dads were laughing, but the shades of red on their faces was prominent.
“Papa, put me down!” Draco complied and laughed softly as Scorpius waddled off into the house. Molly took the shrunken parcel of presents from Harry’s hands and followed after Scorpius into the house. Harry placed his hand on the small of Draco’s back as they made their way in as well. Draco turned took at him and blushed at the way Harry was grinning at him.
“Well, Merry Christmas to you too, Malfoy,” Potter laughed. Draco smiled, shaking his head at Potter’s abhorrent sense of fashion.
Scorpius felt luckier than most of his peers too. He had four parents instead of just two. He only called his birth parents Mother and Father, and his step-parents were called Mum and Dad. Mum always knew the best pranks and Mother always let him help her in the garden. Dad taught him to fly a broom and they always rode together, and he and Father could go for hours reading books together without stop.
“Oh she’s lovely, I’m seeing her tomorrow night,” Draco raised a brow, this would be the fifth time she would be meeting up with Millie this week. “Speaking of dates, why haven’t I seen you with any hot young men?”
“You too, Granger,” Malfoy nodded at the pair politely as he made his way out of the entrance to the shop. His face was blank, but his ears were slightly pink, Harry noted. He followed Hermione into the cafe and took his place at their usual table.
Draco thought, reminded of the way his weakened mother would sit in the parlor behind the large windows, watching the snow gradually cover the Manor in a white blanket. She had died in the spring, a year after the war, and right when the snow was just finished melting.
Although that one class of Slytherin and Ravenclaws had known about their relationship, it had seemingly not spread throughout the entire school yet, or that many just didn’t believe what they had heard.
. He thought, sneaking another glance at the blond. Despite Ron’s charismatic empathy, Harry couldn’t help the gnawing feeling in his gut that told him Malfoy was much too far out of his reach. However, that didn’t mean he wouldn’t at least try.
“Uh, you ok Malfoy?” Potter asked, he stepped forward towards Draco and looked at him with a steady gaze.
Shuddering, Harry crept out of his bed and silently walked over to Draco’s. Peeling back the curtain just a bit, Harry looked down at him.
“You’re not what?” Potter questioned, eyebrows turned up cutely in concern. Draco willed his mind to stop thinking.
“You’re really staring, mate, it’s creepy,” Ron said, pink apron still tied about his waist even though he wasn’t cooking anymore, waving a hand in front of Harry’s passive face.
After several minutes, Ron ended up beating him, and Draco grinned as they shook hands. Scorpius giggled into his chest and Draco stood up, lifting him onto his hip. Draco raised his eyes and immediately found Harry’s across the room. He was smiling at Draco so lovingly that Draco’s heart felt like it was going to burst for a second time.
The war had changed all of them, but Harry wondered if Malfoy had always been this way, simply acting differently around Harry. Harry wanted to know Malfoy better, and if he couldn’t date him, he would befriend him instead.
Draco’s face remained sullen, not even surprised as he watched the fist come towards him and make contact with his jaw.
“Will do, Potter,” Draco smirked, and turned on his heel to walk towards his quarters. Circe knows he was going to need a drink after this. How was he going to manage a single session if Potter was blowing up a racket of grindylows and boggarts right next to him?
Draco’s office was shared with two other DMLE investigators: Mona Lambard and Zacharias Smith, both of whom hold extremely contrasting personalities, so much so that their interactions were the most common source of his headaches.
“Ok, Papa,” Scorpius smiled and fell into his father’s chest, hugging him. Draco wrapped his arms around the toddler and bit back a sob. He didn’t deserve a child like Scorpius, who was so good and pure, the opposite of what Draco felt he was.
Some of the younger students had gasped and turned their heads when they saw Harry Potter holding his past-rival’s son, but most of the older students were aware that he and Draco were far from enemies now and didn’t spare a glance.
Teddy then attempted to fly away from the pair so Harry set Scorpius on one hip and scooped Teddy up with his other arm.Teddy laughed and clung to Harry’s shoulder as he carried the pair back to the house.
“Thank you, Harry,” Draco told him, smirking at Harry’s shock of Draco using his first name. “I owe you,” Draco actually didn’t owe Harry anything, except money, but it was fun to see the blush that formed on the man’s face.
“You’re on the Roboro case aren’t you? Smith too?” Potter asked, jaw now clenched with anticipation. There was still a crumb from the biscuit on the corner of his mouth that Draco was focused on with slight disgust, but he re-centered his gaze with a slight head tilt as he looked at Potter. Smith was looking attentively at Potter with an equally curious expression, his eyebrows furrowed.
The thought of Draco waking up in the back of some car with a bunch of strangers, most likely going to be beaten and tortured for a ransom, frightened Harry, and he held Draco a bit closer against his chest. Draco shifted again and murmured something, before curling his hand into Harry’s shirt.
“I’m great Hagrid, it’s good to be here again,” Hagrid smiled and offered him a rock cake, which Harry politely declined.
“Mate, you honestly can’t expect us to believe that” It was in that moment that Scorpius chose to let out an excited giggle, reaching to Theo.
a damsel. Draco coughed and cast his warming spell again. Potter caught up to him, and they walked beside one another once more in silence. The apparation point felt eons away.
“N-no” Draco mumbled as he felt Potter turn towards the direction opposite of the 8th year common rooms. Lifting a frail hand, he pointed towards the once abandoned corridor, that now held the common room for all of the many returning students.
“Ugh, Longbottom ruined the mood,” Draco muttered. Harry laughed and kissed the side of Draco’s face before he was lightly shoved away.
Also, he and Ron constantly made bets on which students would be going with who to the dance. Ron knew most of the students from the store in Hogsmeade, which was extremely popular among students, and felt he had leverage because he could see who was on a date with who. Harry had won 15 Galleons last year when Coleen Kelly of Hufflepuff went with Anna Thorne of Slytherin.
Draco led him around elegantly, Harry prayed that he wouldn’t step on his feet and was luckily not terrible at the rythem they had settled on. To Harry’s surprise Draco had a slight blush on his face as Harry danced with him, and they were both grinning at each other.
“Potter? Do you need anything?” Draco made sure his face was blank as he took in Potter. He would never admit out loud it but Potter was cute when blushed. His tangle of curls were drawn up into a bun at the back of his head, his wand stuck through the middle as though it was holding his hair together. He was wearing muggle clothes: jeans and a black jumper. Draco scoffed at his lack of professionalism. Professors didn’t have to wear the heavy cloaks that his godfather had preferred, and most had opted towards casual clothes. Draco himself was in brown trousers, a dress shirt and a tailored vest.
“But I danced with Ron too! And me and Ron are just friends. How is dancing with Draco any different?” Draco nudged him with his elbow and Harry snapped his head towards him. “But-”
“May I take over?” he said, gesturing to Scorpius. Draco gave him a strange look. “Go dance with him, he won’t say no,” Ron told him. Draco opened his mouth to say something but Ron cut him off by taking Scorpius from him.
“And besides,” he continued, “You guys are right here in Hogsmeade, and Neville’s with me at the castle. If anything happens, I’ll be fine,” Hermione nodded, but there was still a hint of concern in her eyes.
“Unlikely. Now go teach your class,” Draco quickly dropped a kiss to Harry’s head before leaving. He laughed as he heard Harry sputter behind him.
As Harry laughed with his arms slung around Seamus and Ron’s shoulders, singing to a song they didn’t know, he felt like the pressure and guilt from the war was lifted from his shoulders, not entirely, but enough.
Draco laughed and kissed her cheek as he stood, “I’m going to visit Pansy, I’ll see you later, Stori,”
His eyes shut again but snapped open when he felt a healing charm rush through his body. He sat up and stared at the trio. Shocked
A while after dinner, Scorpius had just fallen asleep in his small bed that Draco had set up. Draco kissed Scorpius’ head and then crawled into his own bed with Harry. Harry opened his arms and Draco went into them. He shoved his face into Harry’s neck and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist. Harry’s arms came up around him and one was stroking his hair while the other was slung over his shoulders.
“I’m such an idiot,” Harry was cuddled up with his two best friends on the couch of their flat. “I’ve ruined everything, he probably hates me,”
When Blaise confronted him about it, he knew it was time to stop, he couldn’t let his feelings for Potter rule his life. So he married Astoria a couple months later and only had a couple of male partners each year. He knew that there was no way Potter could ever feel
After a fitful night of laughter and shared stories, Harry rested his head on the taller one’s chest. Draco ran his hand through Harry’s ragged hair, smiling down at him.
The car reached Draco’s apartment and Harry lifted the man into his arms before stepping out. He carried Draco up to the elevator, nodding at the guards Lucius had stationed there, disguised as concierges and front desk clerks. When they reached the apartment, Harry removed Draco’s dark green sports jacket, before placing him on the bed. He phoned one of the doctors listed in case of emergency, by Narcissa most likely, and they were over in an instant.
“Alright,” He said, and watched as Ron approached Malfoy and Hermione with his hands on his hips, before squashing himself right in between the pair. Harry laughed through his mouth a bit, and sipped his firewhiskey some more, letting the burn of it in his throat distract him from the scene in front of him.
“I have no clue what you’re talking about,” He said, and Mona laughed. Draco’s mouth quirked up slightly, and Mona then huffed.
While Smith was obnoxious and brash, Mona- who had been two years above them during Draco and Smith’s time at school- was kind and very headstrong. In the beginning, Draco had tried his best to remain silent unless necessary; he needed to appear as unapproachable as he could in order to avoid any possible confrontations. Draco had gained enough beatings and verbal lashings following the end of the war to understand that keeping his mouth shut at all times was in his best interest.
“I’m sorry, Draco” Harry spoke quietly, his hand still in Draco’s hair, the other tracing patterns on his back.
Draco watched as Harry laughed as Ron spun him around. When he first saw them going together, he had been confused. He had asked Harry if there was something between him and Ron, causing Harry to promptly spit out his drink and needing a full minute to stop laughing. Harry assured him that they were just friends, that Ron was his brother. Draco had tried to hide his relief.
“Cmon, we’ll miss breakfast if we stay here too long,” peering at Draco as they stood up and made their way to the door, Harry asked “You’re really gonna wear my sweater to breakfast?”
They were now sat together in a back alley nearby, while other mob guards fought off the rest of the captors. Harry began to lightly dab at a cut on Draco’s forehead, and subconsciously wiped a tear from the blond’s eye. Draco sniffed and looked at him brokenly.
“ENOUGH!” McGonagall shrieked. Harry and Draco both quieted and stepped away with wide eyes, frightened by her outrage. “You will both either behave like adults and handle this situation lightly or so help me I will give you the boot myself! Am I clear?”
Another realization for Harry, was that he was bisexual. When he told Ron and Hermione, they both gave him a look that said,
He greeted Pansy at the little cafe she had grown fond of, a little shop on the edge of Hogsmeade. Pansy’s taste was often questionable, but Draco found the little tea shop, with it’s fairy lights and light yellow walls, wasn’t all too bad. The tea was good as well, Draco thought as he sipped his peppermint blend. He crossed his ankles and relaxed as he listened to Pansy go on about how awful the man her parents had introduced her to the night before was.
“So I was right, you are teaching arithmetic while holding Scorp’” Draco scoffed and rolled his eyes.
if anything happened to Draco then Harry would probably be killed as punishment. Harry searched frantically around the dark room, praying to find him. A couple of seconds later, the lights returned, and Harry caught sight of two larger figures carrying a smaller one between them. He recognized Draco’s deep green suit and chased after them.
By now Harry would return typically his own room two doors down, but chose to sleep on the couch in Draco’s room instead.
Draco held Scorpius close to him as he went to sit down at the courtyard. Scorpius was trying to ask him why they had left with his limited vocabulary, and was confused as to why they stopped dancing.
pull it off. But don’t think I can’t see all those doe-eyed, Hufflepuff looks you’ve been giving him, not to mention the ones
“I mean, shared emotional trauma, similar interests, I was surprised it didn’t happen earlier this year,” Pansy explained to the group of huddled third years. “Keep in mind if any of you
As the two both settled to sleep in front of the fire, curled around each other, Hermione couldn’t help but snap a photo of the two.
“Their bodies can’t handle it,” Draco finished for him and Potter nodded, green eyes growing bright with excitement.
Draco downed the rest of his whiskey and buried his face in his hands. How was he going to manage a single day of class if Potter was making him want to physically combust right then and there?
“Death Eater scum!” shouted the 6th year as he kicked the frail blonde heap that was huddled onto the floor. Hearing the boy race off, Draco allowed his eyes to flutter shut. He didn’t fight back anymore, he didn’t have the strength.
“It’ll help-” he started, but Draco was already walking past him, ignoring the offer of warmth with all the dignity that remained in him. He
Draco’s class ended and he had an hour before his next class. He decided to go check to see how Harry was fairing with Scorpius. He walked into Harry’s classroom and was met with a group of giggling and whispering 6th years.
“If this happens again, he’s gone, Draco. Do you understand?” Draco nodded and turned on his heel, quickly leaving his Father’s apartment.
of the recent turn of events, I should remind you all of the proper etiquette and rules that we hold here. Anyone attempting to speak to Professors Potter and Malfoy on anything unrelated to school should expect immediate discipline,”
Harry beamed as he watched Ginny walked down the aisle. She looked beautiful in the tailored navy blue robes that complimented her flaming hair surprisingly well. He looked to his left to see Luna staring at her soon-to-be wife with loving eyes. Harry took Ginny’s bouquet from her as she took her place on the altar, opposite from Luna.  Their vows were beautiful, and had everyone in tears by the time they finished.
The pumping beat of the music and the movement of the bodies around him allowed Draco to forget who he was. He liked how everyone around him seemed to be as lost in the music as he was. But he wasn’t ignored. In fact, he always had at least a couple people, both male and female, trying to put their hands on his waist and their mouth on his neck. He always pushed them away, it never felt right.
“I’ll give you a bet,” Draco cocked his head in confusion. Harry continued, “If I catch the snitch, you allow me to buy Scorpius anything he wants from Ron’s shop,” Draco opened his mouth to object but Harry cut him off, “And if you win, you get to pick your reward,”
,” Pansy drawled with a laugh, and Draco looked at her in alarm, before sinking back down into the couch glumly.
After the war, Harry and Ginny both realized that they loved each other like brother and sister, and parted mutually as friends. In fact, their past relationship was often brought about as a joke, and Ron liked to tease that Harry turned Ginny gay. But everyone knew that Ginny and Luna fit better together than Harry and Ginny ever could, and Harry was quite relieved at that. He realized that he had used Ginny as a way to be legally apart of the Weasley family. When he and Ginny broke up, he apologized extensively for this, and Ginny with her fierce temper was mad at him for using her, but understood his reason.
Draco raised his left arm, showing the faded mark, “I think you may be forgetting a certain detail,”
“You can’t keep thinking about the what-ifs, Harry, or else you won’t get anywhere,” Ron placed a hand on his shoulder, “Mate, you need to tell him how you feel. Then, he won’t be worried about you pushing him away,” Harry breathed deeply and leant back on the couch.
She placed a hand on his arm as they engaged in some sort of small talk that Draco couldn’t be bothered to really think about, and were just about to leave when a scream let out.
Their flat wasn’t big, but managed to fit the trio just fine. Harry still had Grimmauld place, but it held too many memories that he wasn’t ready to deal with yet. There was a sitting room with an overstuffed couch and armchairs, similar to the ones found in the Gryffindor common room. Bookshelves lined the walls, holding the books Hermione couldn’t fit in her room, along with several photographs and potted plants.
“Really?” Potter asked excitedly, the man’s face lighting up like Teddy’s did when they put a slice of cake in front of him. He was bouncing on the balls of his feet, and Draco rolled his eyes, though he secretly kept the image of Potter’s face looking so bright away in his mind.
“Well, I mean, what’s the point, the castle probably got a little wonky after the war, and we haven’t had a problem with it,” Harry told her.
Luckily he had died in his cell in Azkaban a couple months after the war, and Draco didn't grieve. He had already lost the father he knew years beforehand, when he pushed his family into the holds of Voldemort. He and Astoria still went through with the marriage, for their mothers' sakes.
Harry was kissing him. Draco kissed back but pulled away, a concerned look on his face. “I’m sorry, it’s too early, you don’t have to say it back,” Harry continued to smile and pecked him once more before he spoke.
Draco opened up his bag, retrieving the case file on the drug he and Smith were currently investigating. The lack of information they had on the case made him want to rip his hair out on a daily basis, and having to deal with Smith made it
“It looks like St. Nicholas spilled his stomach on it,” Draco commented, head tilting to the side and his lip curling marginally in disgust. The sweater was ridiculous yet Draco found it somewhat endearing on Potter’s figure.
“Yes! Bless Merlin we did,” Draco began to tell her about the discovery Potter had told him and Smith- when a great shiver suddenly wracked through his body- and everything began to feel very cold.
“I don't need your help, you know,” Draco told him as they walked through the long corridor that branched off into the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
He smiled as Scorpius giggled and grinned. He was aware of the looks he was getting from some of his students. Many would never expect that their stern and strict professor could emit such emotion.
“Ready, mate? Peterson and O’Hagan are definitely going together this time, I’m sure of it,” Harry rolled his eyes and grinned, following Ron out onto the floor.
While walking through the castle, he noticed something strange. The Defense classroom was next to the Arithmancy room on the second floor, moved from where it had previously been on the 5th floor. He figured he would find out what was going on later, so he continued to Hagrid’s.
“Wh-” Draco let out a shocked noise as he fell right into Potter’s figure, bells sounded from somewhere though Draco wouldn’t be surprised if they were simply from his head ringing in slight pain.
“Hermione, it’s not like it’s my first time back to the castle,” Harry knew that she was concerned about his memories from the battle, and it would be too much for him to stay there. But for him, Hogwarts held more good memories than bad.
will help him with his homework over the hols!” The boys around them laughed at Scorpius, and he pushed past them with Amaryllis in tow. He saw Father and Dad in the crowd of students, Dad smiled at him and waved him over but Scorpius cocked his head to the direction of the bullying group of boys and shook his head.
,” Smith growled from his desk. Draco opted to take another sip from his cup, diving into the case file for the investigation. It would be a long time until the end of his shift, Draco thought dismally, holding back a third sigh (for Mona’s sake).
“You’re in shock, you’re not in the right mindset,” Harry whispered softly, he finished cleaning the cut and pulled Draco into his arms.
Draco stood and they both visited each family together, informing of them of the pregnancy, but only Daphne was to know of the coming divorce. Astoria trusted her more than she was willing to admit.
“Yes, but that doesn’t mean you can’t use a glamour and pull every once in a while,” Draco rolled his eyes. He knew he could do that, but abhorred the idea of his glamour fading and his partner recoiling in disgust at the sight of him. “And besides, there are plenty of men who would be willing to overlook it, you are very handsome you know. If I wasn’t a lesbian I would probably enjoy our sex life,”
I know that some of these people had more children than were in the story, that’s because one: too many characters I didn’t want it to get two confusing also two: this is an au so :/
“Well there’s been an occurrence of ten Muggle deaths- all in Wizarding London- via heart attack or seizure. But no one knows how they got into Wizarding London or why,” he said quickly, Draco and Smith didn’t reply, both silently urging him to continue. “I’m on the case ‘cause Robards thought that the cause of the deaths was due to a mutated Draught of Living Death- but when I was looking for patterns- I found out that they all had traces of a component from this plant in their system,” Potter said, opening the book he had been holding and setting it on Draco’s desk. Smith, with his mouth set firmly in a straight line, got up and stood beside Potter as they looked at the page he was referring too. “
Ron was going to run the newly opened branch of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes there, and Hermione would still live in their flat, but would floo to the Ministry each day for her job as the head of the Magical Creatures and Beings Right’s division. The branch was formed after the war by Hermione and several other activists who were vouching for werewolf and house elf rights.
Scorpius soon fell asleep again, Harry assumed from the excitement of his first day at the castle, and Harry picked up his sleeping form. He held Scorpius huddled into his chest as he sat down and leaned back in his chair. He fell asleep eventually as well, calmed by Scorpius’ quiet breathing and occasional snores.
“Hi, love,” he said rather loudly and several students gasped. Draco sighed deeply and gave Harry a pointed glare before turning back to the class.
But it was over in a second and Harry attempted to hide the pain as he returned his attention to Teddy. His brows were furrowed and he was pouting.
“I’m gonna go talk to Harry,” Ron said, “Nott, I’m gonna go find Harry, talk some sense into the git, will you?” Theo nodded and Draco rolled his eyes.
“What the hell, Malfoy! How could you just bloody leave like that?” Ron said, stepping forward and glaring daggers at Draco. Theo huffed and held up a hand to stop Ron from saying any more.
“At the moment I cannot come up with any Malfoy men who have produced a girl as their first-born, and you know I have the family tree memorized by heart,” Astoria sighed and shook her head fondly.
Harry walked back inside and closed the door behind him. He sat down at the table next to Draco who was talking to Narcissa in fluent french, while bouncing Scorpius on his knee. Harry realized he was staring and snapped his gaze to Andromeda, who was looking at him with an eyebrow raised.
“F-fine,” Draco almost whispered. “Thank you, Potter” He mumbled as he rolled over, hoping to hide the fact that he was shaking.
The walk felt like years. And Draco grew so tired that he didn’t even realized he had tucked his head into Potter’s chest. At least, not until the warmth left the side of his face and he was set down gently onto his bed.
“Astoria is needed at the hospital in Dublin next week, and none of my close friends can watch him, this includes Andromeda and my mother. So he’ll be staying here, in my quarters to sleep, and during the day he will stay with me during classes or stay with a house elf throughout the castle,” Harry grinned.
Harry was still blushing as he turned to face his class again. At least half of his Slytherins were giving him mischievous grins and the other half of the class was eyeing him warily. Amaryllis, a Slytherin began to speak.
Two years later, and not too far away, Draco Malfoy was on the receiving end of news that he had anticipated. He knew what was wrong the minute Astoria sat down with him.
A voice muttered in his head and Draco flinched. Potter cocked his head at him in confusion. “Malfoy?” He asked, concern laced in his voice.
“Papa!” Scorpius took his thumb out of his mouth and lifted his arms out, grabbing at Draco. Draco smiled softly and picked up Scorpius, plopping him down in his lap. He continued to bounce Scorpius on his knee as he played chess with Ron.
It wasn’t the first time Ron had joined him, for his past 3 years as a professor, he had taken Ron to the ball.Ron always liked to visit the castle and he and Harry often had fun as they tripped over each other’s feet, spinning around on the dance floor.
Christmas was rapidly approaching and with it the Yule Ball. Hogwarts didn’t typically have one until after the war, McGonagall had insisted upon it as a way to distract the mourning students from the fact that it would be their first Christmas without some of their friends and family members. It quickly became a tradition however, and they still had one five years after the war.
his mug into his hand and poured some tea into it from the kettle they kept handy around the room, sipping it idly before he truly sat down and began his day.
“I know!” Potter called. Draco shut his office door with a groan. He set his bag atop his desk and sighed softly.
“Oh- yes, Luna, I’m fine,” He said, nodding, “I like your earrings- Grindylows?” He asked, and Luna beamed.
Draco supposed that he and Astoria would be a good match if they both weren’t extremely gay. They had an agreement that as long as they produced an heir, they could go out with anyone they wanted while still being married to the other. Draco loved Astoria, but not in the way their mothers had hoped.
“Feels good to get something beyond a vague witness account,” Smith said gruffly, mouth quirked into a small smile, and Draco was surprised. Smith had looked kindly towards Draco, for once. Despite his shock, Draco schooled his expression and nodded at Smith in agreement.
“Harry, we’ll love you no matter who you choose to love, you deserve that happiness,” Harry beamed at their words and had enveloped them both into hugs. He felt so loved in that moment, and for the first time after the war, he felt a small shrivel of peace. Two months after that day he was walking into Luna and Ginny’s wedding reception with Justin Finch-Fletchley on his arm.
“P-Potter, stop, or else I’ll look like a spotted owl,” Harry pulled back, still smiling at Draco. Draco looked up at Harry, then he looked down, he shook his head “I can’t- Harry this isn’t right, I don’t deserve-” Harry cut him off.
Harry thought as he took another swig and shook his head as though to clear his mind of the thoughts.
“Merry Christmas, Draco,” Harry resumed his place on Draco’s shoulder and watched as Hugo and Scorpius had an intense game of Exploding Snap, Amaryllis cheering them on from behind Hugo’s shoulder. Teddy was laughing in the corner with Fred Jr. and Roxanne. And Dominique, Victoire, and Molly were all trying to charm little Vince’s hair blue. Harry could feel the rumble of Draco’s laughter as Theo walked over to them and picked up his son, scolding the three for attempting to cast a spell on his child. 6-year-old Vince stuck his tongue out at them as he was carried away and Harry found himself laughing as well.
“It’s not like I can help it,” Harry said, “No matter what I do.” Harry’s grip on his bottle tightened, “I can’t stop looking out for him,”
“To the happy couple!” Harry shouted, and the room repeated his words with enthusiasm. The rest of the wedding went very well. Harry danced with Justin a couple of times, and found him to be a fun, even if shy, person to be around.  They didn’t kiss, but promised to meet up for a pint sometime before Justin left for Auror training.
Harry said his goodbyes, wished Luna and Ginny a happy honeymoon, and left with Hermione and Ron to go back to the flat they shared in Hogsmeade. Ron and Hermione weren’t together either, understanding that they were both better as friends.
That was when he caught Draco looking at them with a small smile etched on his face. Harry set Scorpius down and smiled as the toddler waddled over to his father, his arms stuck out in front of him in a clear way of asking to be picked up.
Ever since they had both been put in the same wing of the DMLE, Potter had constantly made it his aggravating mission to help Draco out in any miniscule way possible. Opening doors, carrying his bags, lending him an extra coat, giving him cups of tea when they both stayed late. For almost every helpful action Potter gave Draco, Draco would deny his help- but the stubborn git had not once backed down- despite Draco’s very apparent annoyance. Although he would never admit it, a part of Draco knew that the relationship between himself and Potter had developed into something akin to a friendship. Once, while they were walking to a curry place to pick up lunch, Potter had asked Draco if his benevolence truly bothered Draco or made him uncomfortable.
“Yeah! The plant is supposed to help strengthen and heal them if they faced a minor wound, but too much strength- and their body is overwhelmed by the plant’s chemicals in their system- and as a result they suffer a seizure or a heart attack.”
“Right over there,” He pointed past Draco’s head to the couch and Draco thanked him before going on his way, relieved to be able to leave Potter and his frustratingly adorable self behind. Granger smiled politely at him, and he joined her on the couch.
“Harry,” Draco whispered, before resting his head over Harry’s heartbeat and finally falling asleep. Harry’s eyes widened, and he slowly raised an arm to place on Draco’s back, to prevent him from falling.
yes!! our boys kissed!! lol guys here's a drink game: take a shot everytime draco shakes his head (im just kidding but still omg it's like his signature move, forgive me lmao)
“No- I’m sweltering,” He said monotonously through the fabric. Potter snorted, taking Draco’s bag- slowly, as though giving Draco time to stop him- from his hands. Draco did not object this time, it was a relief to have the weight of his bag gone from him, as most of his depleted energy was directed towards a warming spell.
He pushed through the crowd, and ran as fast as he could to reach them, and once he did he kicked the closest one in the back, startling both of the captors. He punched the other one and dodged the kick that the first one sent him. He did however, cause them to drop Draco, and he soon scooped the man into his arms before running off.
Also there are a lot of characters so i added like a little family tree thingy for reference (scorpius is now in his second year and teddy in his 5th)
Harry let out a breath of relief upon seeing Draco alive, the opposite of his dream. Harry thought he looked peaceful without the familiar glare on his face, childlike even, innocent.
Draco had been contemplating who to ask, Astoria was out of the question as she was now on her honeymoon with Millie (Scorpius was staying with Andromeda and Teddy while Draco was at Hogwarts), as were Pansy and Blaise because they were visiting Pansy’s cousin in Cairo. He desperately wanted to ask Harry, but would their friendship still stand if Harry said no?
Scorpius had just caused Hugo’s card to snap, winning the game. He let out a shout of victory, but had the mistake of turning his head. He caught sight of Dad and Father kissing each other right out in the open, mistletoe above them.
. First off, you bloody bet on our relationship? And two, you knew about us before anyone else, how did McGonagall win? No offense, Minerva,” McGonagall looked at him sternly, but there was a hint of amusement in her eyes.
“You’ll go to that dinner at Granger’s, and I’ll go to my date, and we’re both going to give our men a chance, alright?” Mona stated, leaning over her desk slightly. Draco groaned.
Draco balanced the stack of tomes in his arms. The books were so old that he couldn’t even use magic on them, for it could possibly inflict damage on their condition. The pile was so large that it almost obscured his vision. He blindly groped for the door handle to his classroom and set the books down on the first desk he reached. He looked around the room and with a flick of his wand all of the dust that had collected over the summer vanished.
“I say hi to Teddy too,” Harry told him and Scorpius giggled and clapped his hands. He then waved wildly at Ron whose eyes were wide as he gave Scorpius a little wave.
“Hagrid, I noticed something strange, in the castle,” Hagrid stilled his hand from where he was petting Fang and looked at Harry with a worrying glance.
. And it was useless for him to try anything. So Draco buried his feelings in the depths of his mind, and refused to think about them again. He was bad at promising things, even to himself.
“I’m not a damsel in distress,” Draco said with a glare as he reached his office, Potter continuing down the corridor to his own.
“C’mon, drink up, mate.” Ron handed him a rather tall bottle of Firewhiskey. “It’ll help,” He said, and Harry gratefully took a large sip from it.
. Ron thought. He needed to do something about it. So he strode up to Draco and tapped him on the shoulder.
Harry’s broom wavered and he fell. He grabbed Draco’s robes and pulled him down with him. They landed in a tangle of arms and legs. Harry was ontop of Draco, arms braced next to the sides of his head. Harry’s eyes widened as he looked down at Draco, who was smiling up at him. His blond hair messily- yet somehow gracefully swooped into a halo that crowned his head, his grey eyes alive and cheeks flushed.
“You fill the whole space with negativity and soon we’ll all have that dreaded, grim look on our faces,” She said, thick and dark curls bouncing as she nodded to herself.
“I now pronounce you wife and wife,” said Luna’s great uncle, who they had gotten to be their minister. The two leaned in and kissed as their guests erupted into cheers and applause. Harry grinned and clapped along with everyone else, the love he felt for both of his friends was so strong, and he was extremely happy for them.
Two weeks later Harry was spelling the last box of his clothes into the wardrobe in his rooms. He placed the photographs of his friends, the Marauders (without Pettigrew), and the Weasleys on the shelf that lined the wall. Once he was finished he made his way to Hagrid’s, as he had promised to stop and visit sometime during his first day.
“Oh merlin, do you have to do that in the middle of the common room?” Ron groaned and shoved his hands in his hair whilst shutting his eyes. Draco shot up from the couch, hair slightly tousled, but he was thankfully clothed.
“I can’t lead him on,” Theo didn’t respond, urging him to continue, “He deserves far better than me, I couldn’t bear it if he r-” Draco stopped himself, he feared that he had revealed too much to Theo.
Draco had managed to pull a couple of times, but stopped after Blaise pointed out that they almost always had black, messy hair and dark skin. He never found anyone with the correct shade of green in their eyes, nor anyone who had hair as messy and soft as he wished. He was in for it bad, he knew, but always tried to tell himself it was pure coincidence the morning after.
Harry watched in amusement as Scorpius tumbled around on the floor with his dragon plushie in hand. Harry had attempted to make a character out of one of the plushies, but the tiny scowl Scorpius had given him was so similar to Draco’s that Harry stopped and had to keep himself from laughing.
A couple minutes later, after Draco assumed Potter had left him alone, he heard several footsteps approach his door. He turned his head away from the incoherent murmuring that he could clearly distinguish as Granger, Weasley, and again, Potter.
“I’m sorry Harry I-” They both spoke at the same time. Harry smiled softly and laughed quietly. Draco returned the smile.
Harry stopped stuttering and nodded slowly before turning back to his food. Draco helped Scorpius make a small plate and adjusted his son’s seat so that he could sit on the tall chair with little fuss.
If anyone noticed Harry and Draco’s clasped hands under the table, they didn’t say anything about it.
of his classes, at least the ones he had with Scorpius in them. Almost no one could pay attention to his lessons as Scorpius babbled around in the spelled play pen that Draco had set up. Scorpius would occasionally hold up one of his plush dragons or unicorns and show them to Draco, who, would nod his head and smile at him as though congratulating the plushie.
“You’re just too embarrassed to admit it,” Mona said, shaking her head fondly. “But if any man looked out for me and cared for me the way Potter does to you, I’d ask him out right away,”
” Mona cut him off, Draco leaned his head back to look up at the ceiling and closed his eyes with a grimace. Sometimes Draco truly detested how stubborn the girl could get.
Draco looked up to see his boyfriend staring at him with a wide grin on his face. “What is it, Harry?” Draco asked, confused to why Harry was beaming at him like a bloody madman.
“Yes, that’s right Scorpius,” Harry smiled down at his godson’s cousin and moved his arms so he had one arm underneath his short legs and the other underneath his stomach. Scorpius squealed in delight as Harry lifted him up and moved Scorpius around in the air as though he were a muggle airplane.
“It was Hermione’s idea to invite you- and I wanted to anyways,” Potter cut him off. Silence overcame them, the dying chatter of the Ministry at 5:05 pm on a Thursday and their shoes on the floor the only noise permeating the space.
A week after the students arrived, Draco had managed a steady rhythm. Luckily only 3rd years and above could take Arithmancy, so he didn’t have to deal with first and second years who didn’t have a clue about anything.
Ahhh!! last chapter!! thank you so much for all of the kudos and comments i love all of you sm!! I had so much fun writing this and I'm so sad it's over. This was my first chaptered fic and I plan on starting another one soon!! <3<3
“It’s not like he’s gonna blow up or something,” Ron said, “You don’t need to always watch him- it’s like 6th year all over again with that look on your face.” Harry huffed out a breath through his nose.
The pixies had flown around the classroom and while Harry managed to immobilize most of them, around five had somehow opened Draco’s door and wreaked havoc on his 5th year class period. Draco had been enraged and that was the day that they decided to set up sound and locking barriers on the door, that only they could get through.
“That’s the thing! I think it’s more than just a drug for Muggles- I think it’s the lead-” Draco’s eyes widened as Potter spoke,
“So the castle put the classrooms next to each other for the sake of the professors?” Inquired Andromeda. Draco shrugged.
It wasn’t a storage closet. In fact, it was another classroom entirely. It was almost identical to the Defense room, and Draco was utterly confused.
“And what of it?” Draco asked, “Do you have something?” He asked, eyes flicking to the book, and Potter smiled and nodded.
was far beyond the help of common magical remedies. His own weakness was a constant source of his frustration. For how could he proudly call himself a Malfoy when he barely had the strength to be on his feet for more than fifteen minutes?
“Then we’ll run some tests then, I reckon we’ll have to get permission from the Minister, but that won’t be any trouble if he’s as frustrated as we are.” It felt as though he and Smith had been running in circles over this case, weeks worth of work leading them to dead-ends and false leads. But now they had
Draco ignored his student’s pleas for Scorpius to stay as he walked over and passed his son to Harry. Harry looked a bit bewildered but he took him and watched as Scorpius happily curled into his shoulder and smiled softly in his sleep.
Draco’s eyes softened at the sight and he resisted the urge to kiss Harry’s cheek as he left. Harry smiled up at him before going back to his classroom and shutting the door behind him.
Draco flicked his wand and the equations he had planned out for his 6th years transferred onto the board. Draco ran a hand through his hair. He kept it short and without product like he had used in school. But despite its length, a few strands always managed to fall in front of his eyes.
After that night, everyone (save for some choice 8th years), was shocked to see the former rivals sitting together at meals, studying in the library, even going to Hogsmede together.
Even Ron had concluded some things from the way Harry would look longingly at both boys and girls during their Hogwarts years.
Despite the fact that the Malfoy’s were involving themselves in a holiday with a mainly Muggle history, the Manor never failed to hold its share of decorations come Christmas-time. The Christmas trees were always grandly decorated, 17 feet tall with a hundred silver baubles and a golden garland that reflected stars across the parlor.
“It’s too early for your sappy-ness Potter,” Draco murmured. Harry rolled his eyes but knew from Draco’s small smile that he didn’t mind.
“Damn, how do you always do that? You knew when I told you about my Healer internship and now this!” She yelled but there was no mirth to her words.
Once his last class of the day let out, an annoyingly boisterous group of Hufflepuff second years, Harry let his head fall onto his desk. He closed his eyes for a moment before sighing and getting up from his chair. He moved over to the wall that separated his and Draco’s rooms. He had become so used to it that he sometimes forgot it wasn’t there originally in the first place.
thank you all so much for the wait!!! I had planned to get this out much earlier but a lot of family stuff happened and I was in a rough spot for a bit but it's all good now so tada!! i know it's late february but it's still like christmas time in the fic if y'all are wondering. A big big thank you to all of my betas,(tagging their tumblrs)@magickfluffy, @weepinggolden, @its-the-ultimate-fangay @paceybunce, and others im giving many hugs and kisses <3<3<3
There was a part of his mind that told him to snap at Potter- make a big deal out of things and have him stop breathing over his neck- but there was another that reminded him of a bright smile, cloaks that weren’t his own being draped across his back, hands holding open doors and resting on his arm, awful jokes and arguments over Quidditch teams, biscuit crumbs and fierce green eyes. So many things that brightened up his day- even if only for a moment- that for some reason he couldn’t bear to lose. Bun leapt off the table and stretched out her back before trotting to the couch and meowing impatiently.
“Something like that, I suppose,” But Draco knew more than that. When he had fallen upon the records of the two professors and their classrooms, it turned out that the magical bond between the two was so strong that the castle’s magic changed to suit their wishes. In other words, they had loved each other so greatly that their classrooms moved themselves so they could be close to one another.
“Why you sad, Papa?” he asked him, lower lip sticking out in a pout. Draco gave him a weak smile, and he lifted a hand to wipe the tears from his own face.
“You were kidnapped last night, I got you back and you were only drugged with a tranquilizer, so no damage done. But-“ Harry sighed and scratched the back of his neck awkwardly.
He hadn’t told Astoria the entire truth. Yes, he was fearful of being rejected due to his mark and name, but there was another reason why he wasn’t frequenting bars and clubs to pull. After the war, a little while before the marriage contract was settled, Draco had gone out to clubs with Pansy and Blaise all the time.
“Bloody hell Harry this is amazing!” Harry listened to his rambling in silent amusement as Draco scribbled away with the pen. “Why on Earth do we still use those quills? This is self-inking! I swear muggles may not have magic but they’re pretty brilliant to have made something like this!”
Muggle holidays had always been a paradox for Draco. Although religion had never really been a big hit among wizards (Christ was obviously just an overly-ambitious Muggle-born), they still celebrated the most popular ones: Christmas, Easter, etc. However, they were celebrated more for the sake of celebrating rather than some moral, religious meaning.
“You’re acting like it’s a chore!” Mona laughed. “Anyways, I’m off on my own date tonight,” She smiled, twirling a lock of hair between her fingers, and Draco raised his brows.
So that night he entered the Great Hall next to Ron, and waited by the staff table for everyone to arrive. Harry was discussing a new formula for Puking Pastilles that Ron was testing when Draco walked in, with Scorpius on his hip. Harry’s words caught in his throat as he looked at the pair. They were both wearing light blue dress robes lined in silver.
, of all people was carrying him back to his dorms. Potter hated him, didn’t he? Sure he testified at his trial and allowed his sentence to go from one year to only a month, but he didn’t like him. Certainly.
Scorpius grinned as Vera and Fin entered their compartment, a miniature chess set tucked under Vera’s arm. As he laughed and played with his friends, Scorpius felt that he was very lucky indeed.
Malfoy’s snarky wit and failure to swoon at him like most others had made Harry have a slight admiration for him. The man he had run into at the tea shop, and seen during visits at Hogwarts, was different from the prejudiced child he had been during their early years at Hogwarts.
As expected, almost everyone had stopped talking and stared as Harry and Draco entered the Great Hall. Together. Holding hands. Scorpius was clutching Draco’s other hand as he followed the pair to the professor’s table. Draco’s face was blank and Harry looked as though he was trying to hold back laughter, and both were blushing ear to ear.
“We betted on when you guys would reveal it, you weren’t that subtle, after all,” Neville replied, grinning smugly. At Harry’s furrowed brow, he added, “Yule Ball,” Harry mouthed an “oh” in understanding and then spoke.
“Being right for once, must be a first for you,” Harry grinned mockingly and Draco had to hold back a second eye roll. “Here Potter, take him, he’s distracting for my students”
“Huh? Oh, sorry.” Harry scratched the back of his neck absently, moving his gaze from where it had been stuck on Draco, chatting lightly with Hermione, a small grin present on his sharp face. “Just blanked out for a bit,” He told Ron.
Despite how awful the subject of their conversation was, Potter was smiling, eyes ablaze and determined. The look he had was a tad frightening, Draco thought idly, but his determination made it so very endearing. Draco’s gaze flicked to Mona- who he had nearly forgotten was in their presence- as she had been strangely quiet ever since Potter entered the room.
“Alright there, love?” called Harry, kneeling down in front of his boyfriend. He brushed the hair out of Draco’s eyes and planted a kiss on his nose.
“Of course not, Harry! Blimey, calling you a freak would have me going against Ginny, wouldn’t it?” Ron had told him reassuringly.
win the house cup,” the students groaned and took their seats, some still whispering to their friends about the encounter. Draco turned his attention back to Harry who was now blushing furiously.
“That’s the second time you’ve signed in the past-” Mona glimpsed at the clock, “Two minutes- what’s wrong?” She asked, Draco quirked up one end of his mouth in irritation.
“I KNEW IT!” someone shouted and the silence was broken. People were either shouting, laughing, or attempting to ask questions.
It was just then that Harry poked his head through the door, and gave an apologetic smile to the students before saying:
“I love you,” Draco said and he immediately regretted it. It was far too early in their relationship for him to say it. Sure he had called Harry “love” before, but it was just a term of endearment. Of course Harry didn’t feel the same way.
from his Father, the Dark Lord, and the occasional Manor guest a myriad of times during the ages of 16 to 18, Draco was on a one-way path for long-lasting damage.
“Yes! Rolf got me them when we went to visit Russia, you know they have quite the infestation there in all of their lakes- it’s strange how Muggle-sightings have been so low with them-” Luna proceeded to talk about Grindylows for the next several minutes- Harry occasionally nodding and excitedly adding along what he remembered from his interactions with them during the Triwizard tournament. The firewhiskey in his stomach made him feel giddy and warm- and when he caught Draco’s glance from where he was cracking up over something with Pansy and Theo- he felt the warmth strike through his whole body.
Draco released the snitch that he had in his palm and they waited a couple minutes for it to fly out of reach, before they shot off. They both circled around the pitch slowly. A couple of minutes passed, and Draco caught sight of the snitch, he shot forward and Harry followed close behind.
The potion lead to unusual instances of wizards being able to perform spells much stronger and accurate than normal; its increasing popularity heightened the pressure on Draco and Smith to solve the case and shut down its production and distribution as quickly as possible. “I think it has the same capability to strengthen wizards as it does for Muggles, but with their magical-power instead of their wounds,” Potter finished, an excited flush strongly present on his face. Draco and Smith looked at each other in shock, looked to Potter, and then stood up rapidly.
Harry grinned, the exhilarating thrill of the game rushing through him. He and Draco flew fast, right next to each other. He turned to Draco and gave him a grin, winking. Draco stuttered and blushed, falling back a bit. Harry wooped and moved faster, leaning forward, hand outstretched to the tiny snitch, that was right in front of his hand. He was a couple feet above the ground, the grass a green blur beneath him. Draco was beside him in an instant, and he pushed Harry’s hand out of the way to stall him.
It was August, a little over two years after the war and Draco had surprisingly kept in touch with most of his Slytherin peers. He and Pansy had tea almost every Sunday afternoon, on Friday nights he would have a pint with Blaise, Millie, and occasionally Theo. And at least three times a month, he, Astoria, Daphne, Pansy, Blaise, Theo, Millie, and Greg would meet up to eat dinner as a group and get pissed.
“I just- I like him so much, and it hurts,” he frowned and shut his eyes. Ron and Hermione wrapped their arms around his shoulders, holding him close.
“What took you both so long?” She said once she had pulled away from Draco and Harry. She turned to his son, “Hello Scorpius, would you like to come play with your cousins?” Draco’s heart almost burst at that. Molly had been referring to George and Angelina’s children: Fred and Roxanne, Fleur and Bill’s children: Dominique and Victoire, Percy and Audrey’s children: Lucy and Molly, as well as Teddy.
Harry knew he needed to clear his mind. He had changed into a t-shirt and jeans at the flat, and rather than going to his rooms in the castle, he went to the quidditch pitch. He grabbed a broom from the shed and walked onto the field.
The whole room was immersed in a tumult as people scurried about. And it was when a gunshot was heard that everyone became even more frantic. The lights went out and Draco started when he felt someone grab him. He managed to push them off for a moment before he felt a prick on the back of his neck, and the already dark room faded from his sight.
Scorpius woke up around a couple of minutes after Harry took him from Draco. Harry still wasn’t over the look that Draco had given him. His usual stoic and masked face had melted into one of love an adoration, and Harry felt as though he were going to explode from the amount of love he himself felt for that man. Harry luckily didn’t have another class for another 45 minutes or so, so he spent his time playing with the small Malfoy.
“Sorry Scorp’!” Shouted Dad and Scorpius looked him right in the eye and made a gagging noise. Dad snorted and laughed and Scorpius soon found himself laughing too.
Finally out of the dorms, Harry settled for the Astronomy tower. Sitting against the wall with his head in his hands, Harry started to shake. Thoughts of Draco curled up, defenseless while other took turns kicking him, and Draco lying on the floor of the girl’s bathroom, shirt in ribbons and surrounded by a pool of blood haunted his mind.
“Hard day back, I take it?” Harry mumbled a yes and nodded. He had gone back to kissing Draco’s neck softly when the door opened.
None of which could be said in the same way for Smith. In all the time they had worked together, Draco was certain that there was not one look Smith had given him that was not full of disgust, anger, or both.
“Stori’s expecting,” Draco said casually in between sips of his tea. Pansy shrieked, attracting the attention of the people around them. She ignored them and clapped her hands.
At this point he would do anything to make himself stop thinking about how nice Draco’s light blue knitted sweater was, how cute he looked as he tapped his gloved fingers together in thought when talking to Luna earlier, or how great his arse looked in his-
Harry had barely knocked on the door once before it was flung open and he was enveloped into a big bear hug.
Draco breathed sharply out through his nose upon seeing Potter leaning against the wall-space beside his own office’s door, tapping on one of those Muggle communication devices in strange earnest. Draco threw his scarf over the lower half of his face and proceeded forwards. The click of his boot-heels on the floor had Potter turning his head up, glasses crooked on his face. He grinned.
No matter how many healing potions and remedies he used and researched, Draco had been facing a constant decline in his strength and stamina ever since he had first been given the
“Fine, Potter. Don’t get your snitch-themed boxers in a twist,” Draco grunted. Potter smiled- but his eyes still conveyed worry.
Hermione noticed his expression and added, “A lot of pureblood marriages are like that, they are only together for power and wealth, but for fun they go to others,” Harry sipped his tea, contemplating this.
Apparently that was not the reaction the man was hoping for, as he visibly gripped Draco tighter and placed his other hand on Draco’s wrist. Harry was over in an instant, throwing the man off of Draco and making sure he stayed back before turning back and dragging Draco out of the bar.
“P-potter, what?” he said groggily. In a flash, Harry raced out of the dorms. He had been so quiet, how had that happened? More importantly,
Harry laughed and stood behind Teddy as he raced on his little training broom. Teddy was laughing as he spun in small circles, around two feet off of the ground. Scorpius was giggling and clapping his hands from where he was held in Harry’s arms.
at the age of 16. As a result of the curse, he was often overtaken by cold spells, and sometimes blackouts- where he would simply lose consciousness and wake up a few minutes later at most. He knew there was no cure. The strength of the
Scorpius did not like the fact that his dads were his professors. Well, as of now it was just Dad, but in 3rd year he would have to deal with both him and Father. Dad treated him like any other student, but it was weird having one of the people you grew up with addressing you as Mister Malfoy. And he had accidentally walked into Dad’s office once to see him
“I need, er- an extra ink bottle? I’ve run out,” Draco gave him a strange look. Everyone knew that the ink bottles were self-filling. Draco handed out an ink bottle that he had produced from his desk drawer. He tried to ignore the warmth that shot through his body when his fingers brushed Potter’s. “Thanks, Draco,”
“Wait one second,” He stood from his chair and stomped over to his and Draco’s shared door. He opened it slightly and spoke. “Do you care if people know? I don’t!” He shouted. Draco’s back was turned and he was looking at a series of numbers on the board. Scorpius asleep next to him in a floating, enlarged pram. He didn’t say anything but gave a thumbs up without turning around.
“It’ll be a spring birth! Oh, imagine you getting the alert in the middle of a lesson!” Pansy laughed and Draco huffed. He had been the Arithmancy professor at Hogwarts for a year now, and was mortified at the thought of his students hearing about the birth of his son in the middle of class. He would much rather have a proper, public announcement.
Harry laughed, he remembered that day vividly. He had been teaching his fourth years about pixies. He had assumed that a group their age would handle them better than his year had with Lockheart, but someone had thought it’d be funny if they spelled the cage open.
“Y’know Hermione just came back from Australia, so we’re inviting some of our year over for dinner next Tuesday,” Potter started, “And you’re very much welcome to come,” Potter said casually as they walked. Draco’s heart stuttered in his chest.
Stretching his legs under his desk and frowning, Draco then proceeded to spell his materials back into his bag, mentally preparing for his commute home. He looped his bag over his shoulder, waved a quick goodbye to Mona and Smith (not surprised when only Mona returned it), and headed out the door.
“Merry Christmas, my love,” He heard Draco say softly. Harry lifted his head and turned to kiss him lightly.
Harry shoved his face in the place between Draco’s neck and shoulder blade, and then tilted his head up to kiss Draco’s neck. He felt Draco relax and Draco’s hand came up to rest over Harry’s clasped ones on his stomach.
“I always thought he’d end up with Parkinson- who knew they’d both end up playing for the other team,” Ron said. Harry nodded idly, as he watched Ginny laugh across the room, arm strung around Parkinson’s shoulders comfortably. His eyes flicked back to Malfoy, where he continued to sit in polite conversation with Hermione, pale hands curled around a glass of wine. “I think I’m gonna go steal my wife back from him now,” Ron said casually, and Harry snorted before patting his shoulder.
“We’ve gotten our breakthrough,” he said, smirking, and Smith’s expression matched his. Potter coughed and Draco looked back to him to see the git tapping his fingers together nervously. “What is it?”
“Yes,” They replied in unison. Both felt slightly affronted as they left her office together. Potter raked a hand through his shoulder length curls, letting out a breathy laugh.
“That’s quite alright Potter,” Malfoy said sarcastically, flashing a mock grin. Harry gritted his teeth, Malfoy was such a git sometimes. “Funny running into you here,”
He still struggled time to time from PTSD and nightmares, but it had gotten better over the last year. He would be starting as the DADA Professor that year, joining Neville who was Herbology, along with Malfoy who was Arithmancy.
The expression was so similar to Draco and Narcissa’s that it was a little frightening, Harry thought. He picked up his tea and sipped it to avoid her narrowing gaze.
“A Christmas sweater, what else?” Potter replied with a grin. “It’s December!” He added, as though that would give some explanation to the monstrosity he wore.
, Draco thought. She was looking at Potter with an unreadable expression on her face, finger tapping on the edge of her desk.
hello!! I wrote this fic over two years ago now- and looking back on it I really want to rewrite it- I think my headcanon had a lot of potential but I sort of smushed it all into a short 10k. I’m currently in the process of rewriting this- hopefully to clear up all the plotholes and make it a smoother and longer fic. I’ll be changing a bunch of stuff but the fluffiness and relationships will still remain the same- I’m just gonna hopefully make the characters less ooc and have more developed relationships.  Thank you to everyone who has shown me kindness on this fic!! I wrote this when I was a bit younger and someone had left a really honest criticism on this fic- I took it to heart and deleted it which I regret a lot as it was pretty rude of me lol- but now that just makes me want to write it better even more- so if anyone has any criticisms on this fic at all please let me know in the comments!!
Harry was very confused as to why Ron was now dancing with Scorpius, though Scorpius did look happy as Ron jokingly twirled him around. But Harry was more shocked as to why Draco was now asking him to dance. Harry blushed and nodded, taking Draco’s hand.
Ok so I have no idea if the Arithmancy room is on the 2cnd floor and if the Defense was on the 5th floor, don't come after me lol :^) Thank you for the kudos and the comments!! <33
“Now, Harry, I wonder, it’s been years and yet you nor Draco have attempted any discovery upon to why your classrooms are connected,” Narcissa said, turning to Harry.
“It’s just his bloody hero complex, he would’ve done it for anyone,” Draco twirled one of Scorpius’ curls in his finger.
“I wanted to make sure you were ok throughout the night, they could’ve hurt you really bad,” Draco’s mouth formed an “oh” shape and he nodded slowly.
Draco noticed something strange however, there was a door on the right side of his classroom that wasn’t there before. Assuming that it was just a random storage closet that the elves had put in, he opened it.
He sniffled, pulling his thick coat closer to his frame as he walked down the street that lead to the Ministry, forever cursing the policy of not allowing apparation within one mile of the building. (There was little chance that he would let himself step into a toilet- for Merlin’s sake- so walking it was.)
“Harry, love,” he whispered, making sure that the students couldn’t hear him. “You have to wake up” Harry mumbled something and his eyes fluttered open. He looked up at Draco’s face and smiled sleepily.
Harry started when he felt a hand on his shoulder. Looking up, green eyes met grey as Draco looked sadly at him. Harry sniffed and wiped his eyes on his sleeve.
“Yeah, I’ll leave two weeks before term starts. Can’t believe I’m actually going back now, though,” Hermione smiled softly.
Entering his rooms, Draco toed off his shoes and walked over to the small cabinet he had next to the fireplace. He poured a bit of whiskey into a tumbler and sipped it slowly. Sinking into his favourite armchair, Draco let the tumbler dangle from his fingertips as he rested his arms on the sides of the chair.
Draco had strategically placed his hand over Scorpius’ mouth to keep him from making noise during the speech and Harry had to bite back a laugh as Scorpius attempted to speak through his hand, mumbling incoherently.
He let out a relaxed breath as he kicked off, the cold air cooling him and blowing his hair out of his face. He turned when someone let out a soft noise behind him. Draco was there, still in his dress robes, his face illuminated by the moonlight.
“I don’t need your pity Potter,” Draco said, he meant for it to come out as snide, but was disappointed to hear that his voice was weak and small.
“So, professor, I’m thinking- 50 points to Slytherin-” a Ravenclaw cleared their throat and she added “-and Ravenclaw, and the answers for our OWLS? Or else we tell everyone of course,” she grinned up at him and Harry groaned.
“Merlin, sorry Malfoy didn’t see you there,” Harry shot out his hands to steady Malfoy’s shoulders when it seemed as though he was going to fall.
Draco had visited the Weasley’s at Christmas one or two times for Teddy’s sake, but Scorpius hadn’t joined him. So Molly Weasley welcoming him and Scorp like
In the end he decided to go with no one, he was a Professor after all, it wasn’t required and unlike most of his students it wasn’t considered socially unacceptable to go alone. He did however ask McGonagall if he could bring Scorpius, and she agreed.
“I wouldn’t say to forget him completely, but maybe it’s best to not push him to hard, let him work this out himself,” Harry looked up at her.
It was far different from dancing with Ron. They weren’t joking and stumbling around like idiots. He had to regulate his breathing as Draco placed a hand on his waist and took his hand in the other. Harry placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder and risked giving Draco’s fingers a small squeeze, receiving a small smile in return.
“The main component of Roboro!” Potter said triumphantly. Roboro, the center of their investigation, was a highly addictive and extremely powerful drug that had been circulating underground for months before the Ministry picked up on it.
“I have no clue what you’re talking about- and why do all the women in my life seem to know more about who I’m in love with than I do?” He asked amusedly. “Mona said the same thing to me earlier. You both really are alike, except she's a bit less of a slut,” He said jokingly and Pansy shoved him lightly with a smirk.
Draco’s head felt rather fuzzy as he awoke. Light streamed in through his curtains, and Draco grimaced as he realized he was still in last night's clothes. His throat felt dry and his head was still spinning as he sat up. He spotted a glass of water on the nightstand along with a benadryl and gratefully swallowed the pill before chugging the water down. Memories of the night before flooded back to him, and he remembered the old politician, the darkness, and Harry. Draco clenched his fists when he remembered how he had kissed his cheek and passed out on top of him.
“No, he’ll be killed if you let him go. Father-” Draco sighed, he clenched his jaw as he faced his father, “Father, I love him,” Lucius looked at him, shock and horror covering his features.
She sat down and though the students were still talking to each other rather loudly, the chaos had ultimately died down. “Mr.Longbottom I do believe you owe me 5 galleons,” she said to Neville. Neville huffed and pulled out the change before sliding it over to her. Harry watched the encounter, mouth agape.
“Malfoy, I need you to check this- oh err.. Sorry Harry, uh, I’ll just be- going now,” Harry turned and chuckled a bit as Neville blushed and hurriedly shut the door.
. Draco thought. It was strange to think that Potter had used his first name as though they had been friends their entire lives. He found that the idea wasn’t something he minded.
Draco remained silent, but smiled as he rested his head on Harry’s shoulder. This was just the beginning he thought, of something beautiful.
, from times he had stayed at Hogwarts with Father and Dad. And not only was that thought mortifying, but many students in his year now knew stories from when he was a toddler (apparently he was an energetic child).
Harry decided that the worst time of the school year was the first day back from the Christmas holidays. He was tired and all of his students were jittery and excited, tittering over what they had done during break and the presents they had gotten. And Harry very much wanted to crawl back into bed, hopefully with Draco in tow, to take a long nap.
It often pained Draco to think of how broken his family had become. Lucius was rotting away in Azkaban, and Draco’s physical health wasn’t one to vouch for. A once strong and prideful Malfoy family, was now reduced to rubble. The war had taken its toll on them, and as the years passed, it felt impossible to recover from it. Draco, who was now the only sane and living Malfoy left, was in a state far worse than one would expect from a healthy 23 year old. Having been given the
Bun was curled up on the kitchen table when Draco arrived home to his flat. He greeted the black cat with a gentle hand to the place between her eyes. She blinked her dark eyes at him in and twitched an ear in response. A chill swept through the apartment, and Draco started a fire up in the fireplace with a flick of his wand. Unfastening his coat, the image of Potter- arms extended and mouth downturned into a pout- flashed through his mind. His fingers clenched the fabric of his coat before he hung it up on the rack.
Harry was waiting for him in the hallway, arms crossed as he leant against the wall. He started when he saw Draco, and gave him a confused look as Draco marched right up to him. Draco tugged on Harry’s jacket, pulling him forward, before kissing him. Harry’s eyes widened, but he soon melted into the kiss, arms coming up to hold Draco’s waist. Draco pulled back and laughed a bit breathlessly.
“You go first, Malfoy,” Potter told him with a head nod towards the entrance. Draco looked between the door and Potter before huffing and squaring his shoulders.
Draco often told himself. As much as he despised Smith, he understood that the man’s loathing towards him did not come without premise. In fact, a handful of harmful looks and words throughout the week were trivial compared to some other interactions he has had in the past with those who had put it upon themselves to punish Draco themself for his crimes.
To his despair, most of his older students who were used to his typical emotionless demeanor found this endearing and some of them had the audacity to ‘aww’ at him. Once, during his 5th lesson of the day, Scorpius fell tired and Draco instinctively scooped him up in his arms. He didn’t even realize he had done so until Amelia Bennett asked if she could hold Scorpius. Draco declined and rather adjusted Scorpius while he went over the trigonometric procedure on the board.
“I dreamt that you died,” Harry whispered, lifting his arms to hug Draco back. “I needed t-to make sure it wasn’t real,” Draco lifted his head and looked at Harry with a small smile.
, Draco thought as he looked at the dull and simple garlands that were strung across the lampposts in Muggle London.
Scorpius went right to him and put his chubby arms around Draco’s neck. Draco picked him up and kissed his son’s temple. Harry wanted to burst with happiness at the sight, for a moment it felt like he was apart of that, like he was in a family with them.
After dinner, in which he had shared many stories about his students and discussed his support of Hermione’s campaign for house elf rights, Draco joined Ron for a game of wizards chess. He was watching as Ron moved one of his knights when he felt a tug on his leg. Scorpius was looking up at him, smiling around the thumb in his mouth.
Draco shamelessly clutched Harry tightly, sobbing into his arms as Harry held him close. He could only remember several things from the past couple of hours but it still shook him to his core.
Scorpius was a Gryffindor with Amaryllis, and Hugo was a Ravenclaw. The public had been shocked by the son and heir of both the Greengrass and Malfoy’s being a Gryffindor, but his parents had been nothing but supportive.
of you. His life is not as valuable as yours, Draco, this cannot happen again,” Lucius snarled down at his son, Draco glared back.
“Sorry, Ron” Harry said, blushing. “We should probably stop anyway, I’ve still got that Charms essay to do,” Draco reluctantly agreed and pulled his books towards him.
“That’s why I have you around, I thought” Draco cocked his head and laughed as Harry glared at him. “Just take me home now, Potter,”
Finally, he heard footsteps walking away, but was yet again shocked to turn and see that Potter was still there, looking at him with sad eyes.
Draco knew he had to leave the moment that Harry had looked at him like that. It had all seemed to good to be true, and he didn’t want to feel the sting of disappointment when Harry realized his mistake. Harry was too good for him, and he didn’t deserve someone like Draco Malfoy, who had been apart of the group responsible for the death of Harry’s loved ones.
Theo sighed, “Well, when you get your head out of your arse and realize that Potter is arse over tit for you, tell him,”
“Far too full of himself, and this is coming from me! It seemed as though he wanted me to applaud him for bringing the bloody wine! Fucking narcissist,” Draco smiled at her rantings, he didn’t realize how much he had missed hanging out with her. Nothing was ever normal after the war, but they were healing, very slowly.
Draco was checked, and the tranquilizer was indeed only to make him sleep, so luckily little harm was done to Draco. The medic left and Harry sat on the bed, looking at Draco’s sleeping form for a moment before he stood.
When the clock on top of the door chimed 11:00 pm, he and Smith decided to call it a night. Draco didn’t know if he should’ve felt relief or dread when they did. The thought of his armchair, fireplace, and Bun (his cat), were all very appealing. However, even the thought of walking the long and cold mile to the apparation point seemed to tire his body out. Snow was gently falling beyond the window of their office, and Draco watched it with discontent.
“There’s nothing wrong, I’ve just been feeling a bit more sick recently, if you must know- probably lack of sleep,” He explained, and Mona nodded but her eyes were still looking him over questioningly. “Really, that’s all it is,” He said again, Mona tilted her head.
The kitchen was full of muggle appliances that Ron refused to touch after a peculiar incident involving the toaster. There was a wooden breakfast table that had a view of the village, and even a distant glimpse of Hogwarts.
They shushed him and pointed to Harry, who was asleep in his chair, with Scorpius on top of him, snoring softly. Draco’s mouth went slightly agape and he walked over to the pair. He slowly lifted Scorpius up and held him in his right arm as he placed his left on Harry’s shoulder.
