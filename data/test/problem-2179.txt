In their temporary goodbye, Draco braved himself to give him a peck on the cheek. From the way Harry's cheeks reddened even more (it already was, from the cold autumn wind) it was obvious he wasn't the only one a bit shy from it, a bit delighted.
"As much as most rich kids do, with their parents busy twenty-four seven, with barely any time to actually bond and care for each other more than what is required of them, I suppose."
"And now you insist that I teach you what, to dance?" Malfoy shot back, distaste clearly plastered on his whole being.
, but Harry ignored that. “We watched Beauty and the Beast and he got so interested in dancing, he asked ‘Dromeda and got obsessed with the idea of waltz even though he’s never properly seen it.”
Harry clamped his mouth shut, before saying, "I- He's sick." He swore at himself that it sounded too panicky, Dra- Malfoy was going to see right through it.
. But alas, and perhaps fortunately so, he came up with nothing.
Draco hugged him. For real, instead of the close (yet never close enough) proximity that the dance had them in. “Shh, Harry, it’s okay. Breathe, love,” he whispered gently, as if talking to a child. And if hearing the word ‘love’ from Draco’s lips didn’t become his undoing, Harry didn’t know what would.
Harry Potter looked at the (somehow) heart-shaped bottle filled with pink-ish perfume which had just been shoved into his hand. He looked and stared and glared. And finally read, "Treacle… tart?"
He closed his eyes. This all felt too surreal. Too late did he realize there were tears escaping his eyes.
It was a long time ago that Malfoy changed into Draco, that hurtful insults turned into playful jabs, that punches became tentative touches and hate evolved into love. They were two sides of the same coin, always attracted to one another like some magnets that couldn't get enough of one another.
Draco wanted to roll his eyes. "It's nothing big, it's kind of embarrassing really. I just did a small mistake at school but my teacher wouldn't stop texting me about it."
Shame flooded him as he was reminded of the nice, extravagant life he owned. Wanting to throw that away just for a simple mistake seemed so… lame, especially for how far he'd come. How much he'd endured. It was just falling asleep in class, for god's sake. Why couldn't he-
Shaken out of his reverie, Harry could only, "What?"
Where was the cruel plan and the tragedy about to happen to him? He didn't see any evil within this container of treacle tart…
"Not all rich kids are like that."
The stranger was quite handsome, somewhere around Draco's age. His raven hair fell in wild curls, rampaging and creating a nest of its own on his head. His old-fashioned glasses laid atop his nose, it didn't quite match him but he also looked like he'd rock anything just fine. He wore a black coat to hide himself from the autumn wind.
Draco smiled, the feeling of Harry's hand so, very warm.
He had thought to talk to Pansy or Blaise about it, but they were different from him. They were perfect. They had no flaws, did no mistakes, and even if they did, they covered everything up perfectly well. And besides, the spotlight wasn't on them. He was the prince of Slytherin, no matter how much he currently loathed that title that was given to him.
"Not all," Draco easily agreed. "I wish, though. Having money and affection seemed like such an unfair… Well, I can't help but think I'd have grown up with less anxiety and overthinking problems had I gained more familial affection, I suppose."
Draco glanced at his evening tea. He wasn't in the mood to eat, yet the familiar treat he wished would calm him down brought nothing but a feeling of sourness on his tongue. It was too late to put it back in the teacup, that'd be horrible table manners. He forced himself to down it. He wondered what went wrong, maybe he sprinkled too much sugar?
"That's the whole point," Harry said with a lopsided grin.
Harry had gone to all kinds of perfume shops, muggle and wizarding alike, ranging from those that cost six figures to those that barely cost a cent. He had roamed through all kinds of stores to catch a whiff of each shampoo, each body-wash, each
Therefore, obviously the only answer was to confront the blond about it, so that was what he did.
It was arguably worse than—
The way Harry switched into Potter set alarm bells ringing in his ears, but he couldn't think. He couldn't process what was going on; a second ago his heart was beating so fast it might've burst out of ecstacy and now the (supposedly) love of his life was looking at him like was a monster, because of his own words nonetheless. "It- I
Draco snorted. Because Harry had gotten it right. He stretched his arms because it felt so nice to have gotten it out of his system.
How did Harry know this?
So one day, he confronted his boyfriend about it, asked which shampoo, body-wash, face maskers and perfumes he used. Hell, he even asked the detergent used for his clothes, because Harry was utterly mad about his smell.
are up to these days? Potter, Teddy is my cousin," Draco began. "I'm a Healer. If he were sick, Aunt Andromeda would've contacted me immediately. I also know for a fact that he hates dancing with passion, at least this type." He paused for a second, which was enough time for Harry to start panicking.”Now, we could sit down and acknowledge your raging internalized homophobia over tea, or you can get out of my Manor
“I think Teddy and I have heard enough,” she declared, lifting the sleepy boy from the chair. He’d dozed off, thankfully not awake enough to hear the dirty turn the conversation was taking. Harry felt his face burning and he wanted to scold Draco, but what could he say? He did enjoy some name-calling. “You have the guest room all to yourself, boys. Please do cast a Silencing Charm if you decide to practice the arts of name-calling today. I’ll see you tomorrow.
Harry Potter could only follow his blond prat of a boyfriend to their room, planning to perhaps buy a treacle tart-flavored lube later.
Draco felt a bit like something was choking him from the inside, slowing his breathing until he became restless. He wanted to reach out to someone, but what would he say? He'd done a minor fuck-up that caused him to have a small internal breakdown, but nothing actually enough to tell someone and have them symphatize, because it really almost didn't matter.
. And nothing could compare.
"And you can't even stand the big words. They're not even
Every time Harry thought back to that moment, he could still hear the echo of Draco's voice offering him happiness and love and. And—
It felt like deja vu, he just had to defend himself again, “I knocked!”
“Well, what’s new?” Draco gave a cheeky grin. It was like nothing had changed, but they’d grown so much. It was like coming home after a long, painful journey.
Harry could sense it in every corner of their home. Don't get him wrong, he smelt as aromatic as usual, but his snake had used a different perfume and Harry… didn't know how to feel about this particular change. He didn't dislike the new perfume, no, (as if he could ever dislike that Draco personally handpicked anyways,) but he had gotten so used to the old one, had made beautiful memories with it. It seemed sad to part with it.
He walked.
Draco nodded. He knew exactly that was the root of the problem, but he couldn't deny, "It is still my fault, in the end."
“I just- I didn’t know I hated myself so much, that I hurt you over it. It’s such a stupid thing. You deserve better, not someone like-”
had ensured all those and more.
He was so tired, but he willed his legs to move. It was late, but he couldn't bear to be inside this house any longer, just mulling over nothing that mattered. He grabbed his coat and walked outside, almost wanting to cry for the relief the evening wind brought him. It was ecstacy; temporary, fleeting.
“I’m sorry. I don’t want to start over. You’ve always said that you couldn’t erase your past, so me erasing what made us become us, erasing the very reason I fell in love with you is ridiculous. I’d never forget how beautiful you looked, I’ll never forget how beautiful you are. Draco, I.” His speech was yet to be finished, but he felt like his heart was exposed out in the open. It wasn’t a good feeling, like defenselessly letting someone hold a wand to his head, wondering at which point he’d be AK’d. His Mind Healer had warned him about this, but nothing could help with the painful sensation of his heart racing in his chest. His feet were getting wobbly and it made him regret that he didn’t take up the offer for tea. “I don’t want to start over. I want us to move forward, I want to be with you. You know what I’m asking here, Draco, please. I’m talking like a fool.”
"And whatever makes you think that I know this?" Malfoy asked, still not paying Harry a glance because to the git his plants deserved more attention than his guest. Then again, it might be that he didn't consider Harry a guest at all. Malfoy Manor was cold as ever,
"Hm, I guess for your simple Gryffindor brain, it would seem that way, but no," Draco paused, letting out another grin. "It's as much for you as it is for me.
"Not at all. I enjoy having you here," Harry replied. "Your presence is like the wind. I enjoy talking to you. Can we talk more?"
Voldemort was too scared to face Dumbledore and Dumbledore was… Dumbledore.
Behind the snow, when the castle was sleeping and it was only them two. It wasn't something that Harry'd envisioned of himself seven years before, having to run into the library to hide from his underclassmen because they were fans of the idea of him, the concept of the Chosen One. As if.
Some would say it was a very strange habit.
The second thing that Draco did was add some muggle tattoo to his Death Eater mark. He did not cover it, he decorated the symbol of racism with something from which its hatred came, creating an art with so much contrast and so much meaning. His history couldn't be erased just like that, he'd said, and he wouldn't erase it even if he had the chance. Everything would evolve.
He was desperate. It was simply a mystery he had to solve or else he'd die unsatisfied. And luckily, Draco was willing to explain, albeit with a flirty grin that Harry should've realized hid something behind.
about this new perfume. A strange feeling of familiarity, even though it was as unique as perfumes go. Yet another smell that Harry had never picked up before.
But nothing quite smelt like his boyfriend.
But today, Draco smelt different.
Draco gaped at him. Back then, Harry had thought it was because he was shocked at the rejection, but now he thought it was just because the outspoken lie was too outrageous. Unthinkable. "Is the concept of bisexuality lost on you, Potter?"
Five years. Five years and still, being in Draco's arms felt like coming home. Or so Harry thought silently as they danced.
kind, working." Before Harry could offer a rebuttal, Malfoy had pushed him out the door, his farewell being, "See you Friday, Potter."
"Yes," Harry said with all conviction he could muster, as if the word itself didn't have him questioning all his morals and life choices. "More specifically, waltz. Because Teddy wants to. Waltz, I mean."
"I get that. I also think it's such a small problem, I think that's what partly makes it so bad. I'm panicking over something so small that it barely even matters when just about everyone else out there has problems much larger than me," Draco admitted.
"I knocked!" Harry defended.
It didn't take long for Harry to realize that his snake had prepared something. After all, the subtle glances (Draco was a drama queen; if he seeked attention, he'd get it. And he was a sneaky git; Harry wouldn't notice if he
She and Luna headed for bed. The tournament was tomorrow and she needed her rest.
Arlene intervened, “then I’ll ask you, how does a squib take down a dragon singlehandedly?”
Harry and Ron on the other hand were obviously happy about her agreeing to their plan. They had smiles on their faces. Harry told her, “that’s all we wanted to talk about. Sorry to keep you from where you were going.” They waved bye to her.
George got enough control to say, “classic, going in the Weasley hall of fame that is.” They high fived and left.
When Dumbledore stood up Luna grabbed Arlene’s hand under the table. The headmaster spoke to the hall, “Today is a sorrowful day. We have lost far too much this year. Ron Weasley’s death was a tragedy. A tragedy I feel you should all know the truth of. The ministry is saying that Mr. Weasley’s death was an accident. That is a lie. Ron Weasley was murdered by Lord Voldemort.” Murmurs that died quickly flowed through the room. “We must all prepare ourselves for the coming months. They will be challenging times. Times where we must support our friends and family.”
The two of them walked for several minutes before they accidently found the other side.  It opened up rather close to where the Beauxbatons carriage sat. The lake was visible from here as well. Two slowly filling troughs in the snow marked where the students from the two other schools had walked to the ballroom.
Luna sighed and answered, “to be honest I don’t feel like teaching right now. Besides it’s more of a thing between my dad and me. If you want to do the dance we did before then I’m willing.” She shook her head and they stayed by the snack table.
Arlene wasn’t able to focus on it well. She had to think for a minute before the answer came to her. “An echo.” The knocker growled but let her in.
Joan asked him in a serious tone, “how do you feel about starting a relationship with someone?”
Arlene saw Adrian taking some of Harry’s blood. After he finished he took the bag to a side room of the Great Hall that had a low hanging mist coming from it. As if the room had been magically chilled.
He smiled with some red in his cheeks. While tapping the map away, he told her, “I just hope it’ll lead you to more information. I can’t relate but I know it can’t be easy not knowing.” His smile had faded.
The room went deadly silent. The two of them stood in the center of the room while everyone stared at them. That was until Madam Pomfrey screamed, “YOU DID THIS YOU EVIL BITCH?!” She kept at her work but screamed at Skeeter, “YOU WAIT THERE, I’LL COME OVER AND I’LL SHOW YOU HOW CRUEL A HEALER CAN REALLY BE!”
Joan told him, “I don’t think you should challenge the person who signs my paychecks to a deathmatch.” She had a half smile when she said it though.
“I know. I think she and I are going to have a private conversation about that article before she leaves.” Adrian maintained a straight face.
Adrian would never understand why wizards didn’t embrace the internet. It was so fast and useful. Instead of spending months looking through cemeteries he had a town already to search. “Thank you. You have a nice day.” He went behind a bookshelf and apparated back to the gate of Hogwarts.
Arlene stood next to Luna. Before she knew it they were walking forward. Her heart beat faster in her chest. This was the moment of truth. Then they were in the ballroom.
"Fine, I'm not going to dislodge you," Giving Harry's legs another squeeze, Draco carried him the last bit of the way to the lake shore before setting his Gryffindor down on one of the boulders. He scrambled up next to Harry, hooking an arm around him. Draco's chin rested on Harry's cowlicks. He swung Harry's legs over his until the chilly Gryffindor was practically in his lap, "What do you think of that sunset?" Harry sighed happily, curling deeper into Draco's side. His gaze traveled over the lake, where an eruption of bubbles spouted across the glassy surface.
“What did you do to her?” Harry asked. Draco smirked, cocking his head toward Snape. The professor had cleared away a path through the mess to the spot that Umbridge stood. His nose wrinkled as he leaned down to lift up something between his thin, potion-stained fingers. A pink worm wriggled in his grasp.
Harry hopped up, glad to have something to do. He slid back between the beaded curtain. The rainbows danced around the room, reflecting off the glazed teacups. Scanning the shelves, he caught sight of a blue set of cups, as bright as the door to the teashop. Raised dots of green colors speckled their surfaces. He stood on his tiptoes and lifted down the cups with their matching saucers. After stacking them carefully, he carried them back into the back room.
Draco wrinkled his nose. He leaned over to see the advertisement he's put in the Prophet weeks ago for the side business he'd started out of his tea shop. A tutoring service aimed primarily for children who were waiting for their Hogwarts acceptances. He smirked, "And what exactly do you need a tutor for Potter?" Blushing, Harry twirled his lord rings around on his fingers. He'd become Lord Potter and Lord Black when he came of age, but it didn't mean he was ready for all the responsibilities that came along with it.
Draco slapped his hand down on the table and asked, “then why can’t we do that?” He leaned against the table and answered his own question, “I know how two boys dancing at a ball looks. I know.”
Her hands betrayed her, as they fidgeted away. He glanced at them and raised an eyebrow. She asked, “Professor, does my partner have to be a…” if she finished her sentence then he would know but Flitwick had been nothing but nice to her. He didn’t seem like the judgmental type. She took a risk and asked, “does my partner need to be a boy?”
Hermione cocked her head.
Hermione could have sworn an emotion flashed across his face before he opened his god damned mouth and nearly shouted, “Granger, shut up!”
Hermione was confused, but obliged.
“Harry.” Hermione breathed. She looked from Draco to Harry, then back to Draco again, sensing a tension in the air so thick it could have been sliced with a dagger.
So Hermione would respond with minor details about her life. She’d grown a garden– her roses were now invading the place she’d designated for petunias and she couldn’t find a non-magical way to solve it. She avoided magic at all costs, but she never included that in the letters. When she first moved, she’d dyed her hair blonde and gotten it permanently straightened with the money she brought from home. That lasted her about half a year– the amount of time she had truly planned to stay– but once she started running low she had to start looking for a muggle job. She’d gotten an interview at a little muggle bookshop, and by rambling about her love of books, the little old man who ran the place said he just
No, it couldn’t be Draco, Hermione decided. She extinguished the flames of optimism that had sparked at the sound of the deep voice, and swallowed the bitter taste his name had left in her mouth. Straightening her wrinkled blouse, Hermione mustered the courage to spin towards the man.
quickly began to look a lot like '
wanted him to be.
His wand was out before she could even finish his name. “
“What do you mean?”
“We don’t know why they’ve waited this long to act on any plans against you. You’ve been lucky. But us showing up and looking around your place definitely set off a reaction. Aurors who were left at your home to survey the area caught men in black cloaks lurking around after the majority of us had left. When questioned, two of the men admitted to being Voldemort devotees, and two others actually attempted suicide before they would speak to us. So, it has been determined you are unsafe.” Draco finished. He looked at her again, eyes still hard. “
She felt the urge to grin and frown all at once. Another weight had been lifted from her shoulders, and it felt just as bittersweet as the last.
“Yes.” Hermione frowned. “Why did
to inflict that upon you.” His eyes were tearing up now. “I broke your heart, and I hate myself every day for it. Harry makes me happy– so happy, but no one could ever fill the you-shaped hole in my heart.”
She shouldn’t have expected anything less from Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter: the Boy Who Lived and the richest prick in the wizarding world. Their wealth combined was enough to build a city. One measly yet magnificent wedding wouldn’t put a pea-sized dent in either of their vaults.
come?”
But it never was.
“I know.”
The universe did not answer, and neither did the man at the door. Memories came rushing back, even as she tried to fight them– memories of Pride and Prejudice and the Room of Requirement and every single damned thing she’d ever done with Draco.
“No, Draco.” She forced the words to sound slightly confident– despite how utterly devoid of confidence she was. She watched him scan the room, looking at everything except for her. She felt her ears grow hot with rage before she spoke again. “I don’t care
“Because I loved you so much I started to hate myself. It was you or me, and I just didn’t have the strength to choose you.” He sighed. “You were–
“So you didn’t come to save me?” She winced at the sound of her own voice– shaky and hoarse. “You were just following orders?”
Hermione begrudgingly took a seat in the front row, next to Ron and Ginny, whose distaste was apparent on their faces. They never approved of Malfoy, but Hermione could still tell they were happy for their friend. She just wished she knew how to feel the same way.
sleep, I still heard you screaming. But seeing you in my dreams was like a reminder– a reminder that I had not seen you in years. I’ve driven myself mad remembering every moment I felt you staring years ago, begging me to look at you. I’ve practiced all the ways I could have apologized– gotten on my knees and begged you for forgiveness.”
Rage boiled in every part of her body. Draco was walking closer now, he was almost to the register. She pushed out of her chair and clumsily attempted to stand; if she was going to fight him, she couldn’t let him catch her off guard. However, in her drunken stupor, she tripped over her shoes and fell directly back into her chair. The world spun slightly.
TW // Alcoholism
“I love you, Granger. I always have– from the very first day I met you. From the very first time I called you mudblood, to the day I got married to someone else. And it kills me to see the pain in your eyes now, to know that all those years ago I
“Because you’re important.”
Theodore Nott gave a speech. She’d always loved his anecdotes at school– things he’d say to Draco when she wasn’t supposed to be listening. But she couldn’t stand the way he spoke tonight, voice full of love and a disgusting hint of delight. He told the hundreds of witches and wizards in the hall how proud he was of Malfoy for ‘
would solve this if she could just use fucking magic.
“Dramione.” Hermione whispered. She breathed, willing the church hall to stop spinning. “Dramione,” she repeated the word, almost desperately this time– desperate to feel how she had felt the first time she had said it– desperate to remember that feeling. But the word held no weight– no truth.
Closure is the last thing Draco Malfoy is offering when he walks through the door of Hermione's bookshop, but closure is the one thing Hermione needs.
When Draco realized she was not going to speak, she could see him begin to panic. His eyes scanned the room, clearly trying to find something else to focus on. But every time, they returned to her. For once, he couldn’t
about his fucking happiness.
“I don’t want to hear what you have to say, Draco, but at the same time I so desperately do. Don’t you understand?” She could hear herself slurring the words.
His eyes flashed briefly with an indiscernible emotion. She didn’t allow herself to hope that emotion was remorse or nostalgia. She held his cold gaze as long as he would allow before he turned away. Then he was gone and she was alone in a room full of people with only an empty glass and a broken heart to keep her company.
“Hurt?”
“I’m okay, Harry.” She chuckled– a true laugh. “Really.”
and then left to rot amongst a long list of secrets that Draco Malfoy kept hidden behind solid walls of stone. Like how his first kiss belonged to Blaise Zabini, or the way he secretly hated warm Earl Grey, but drank it to please the purebloods around him. She wondered how many of those secrets remained hidden from Harry, or if it was just her significance in his history that he refused to acknowledge.
This is the sequel to Now and For Never. I always wanted to write an extended version of the original one shot, because I feel like there were multiple questions I wanted to answer, and I wanted to give NAFN Dramione a bit more backstory. It's always been up to interpretation if Draco truly loved Hermione and I wanted to add onto that question. I present to you a little bit of joy, and a lot more pain. Feel free to skip this first chapter if you would prefer to start the sequel.
Hermione’s blood boiled. “Oh that is fucking rich–”
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. “I knew that.”
Harry looked at the glass she was still clutching and
He hadn’t even glanced at her all night. Still hadn’t, barely an hour before the damned ceremony was to be over. And there would be no after party for her to crash either. At least not one she’d been invited to.
Hermione hid her face in her hands. She didn’t want to see him anymore– his guilt felt like another weapon he could use against her. As much as she wanted him to regret hurting her, she didn’t want to be the source of his pain. She had enough fucking empathy for that. “You said forever.” She said, though it was muffled through her palms.
She chided herself.
Hermione’s heart kept breaking every time he opened his mouth. She couldn’t believe the words he was choosing to say. Never an ‘
There would be no now and forever. There never should have been.
“Hai cambiato i capelli.”
“Benvenuti in Libri Felici, fammi sapere se hai bisogno di aiuto.” Hermione forced herself to sound pleasant. She hoped the customer would in fact not need anything, so that she may continue half-reading this story she could have cared less about.
without him– in her life– her heart– her brain. She felt his absence in her soul where his presence had always been. It wasn’t letting go, but understanding she had been let go of. Understanding it was over. Understanding what she’d always known; the universe would not answer her late night pleas to bring him back to her.
Harry had nearly killed Draco once. Hermione remembered slinking through the Infirmary’s grand doors, scared to be seen, just praying he was alive.
Deep inside, Hermione felt that hope die. His apology was all she had wanted for years and years, and in that moment, as his eyes locked with hers, Hermione realized his apology could never be enough. If his words were truly a request for amnesty, he had earned the opposite.
blood never seemed to stop him from burying his cock inside inside of her, but maybe a public affair was just too far for Draco Malfoy. Maybe mudbloods were meant to be kept underneath the sheets and war heroes were meant for brunch in London. Maybe his aunt’s victims were meant to be tossed aside and childhood nemeses were meant to be arm candy to show off whenever Rita Skeeter needed a new front page story.
Hermione wondered if the reason she’d need to return to Britain would be liver failure– she knew a medic who specialized in liver treatment at St. Mungos. Maybe when she felt comfortable returning she would try rehab, or perhaps a mental mediwitch, if she was feeling especially healthy. But for now, she focused on getting through the day without contracting alcohol poisoning or getting fired for disorderly conduct. She considered that a successful day.
Three customers were waiting outside the bookshop when she pulled into the small parking lot out front. They turned to face her as she stepped out of her car. Hermione raised one hand to apologize and shielded her eyes with the other, nearly gouging herself with the set of keys she was holding. “Traffic. Uh, traffico!” She lied. “Mi dispiace.”
“Because deep down, I always will.” He sighed. Hermione thought she heard a noise from outside the shack, but she passed it off as a creaking roof. Draco seemed to not have heard it, as he continued to speak. “I’ve lost sleep praying you were alright– that we would find you in one piece. That maybe I wasn’t the reason you left. And when I actually
Hermione numbly clapped as the two men kissed, sealing a marriage she knew would never break. A marriage formed by love, not angst. They were in love, and there was nothing she could do about it. She wondered if Draco knew their love was at the expense of her pain— if he knew the sparks he must feel in the pit of his stomach were ignited by the burning in her chest. All she felt were flames licking at her skin— they surrounded her, dancing in the cool breeze. Rage and sorrow and the overwhelming urge to sob against the chest of a tall blonde consumed her all at once, because Draco Malfoy did not love Hermione Granger, and that was the irrefutable truth.
Of course, no one could ask her questions directly, since none of her friends truly knew where she’d gone. The quaint little home Hermione had found upon her return to Italy was far enough away from the rest of the Wizarding World that Hermione could make her best attempt at recovery without seeing
“Damn it,” She hissed. She couldn’t think of a better solution. Perhaps using a healing charm just this once couldn’t hurt. She prayed she was right as she reached into her bag and pulled out the wand she kept for emergencies. She glanced around suspiciously, though she had no neighbors for kilometers, before muttering a few incantations to heal the scrapes.
bad for my health.”
“Dra–”
As Draco and Harry’s dance came to an end, Hermione’s head was spinning. She accioed another glass of wine, because if anything could get her through this night, it would be the bittersweet numbness of intoxication. Perhaps if she got sloshed enough, her friends might send her home and allow her to leave this event without judging her for it.
Why would you come here, after everything you’ve done? I want to know
her, and only her, for the first time in an eternity. She realized there was no one else in the shop for him to choose to speak to. There was no one for him to play pretend for. No one for him to hide from, or impress.
The words stung her tongue like an acrid flavor of Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans, but nonetheless, she held out her arms and fought a scowl when Harry threw his own around her in return. The embrace was almost friendly– she played the supportive role well. She wondered if her best friend could feel how stiff she’d grown under his touch because he got to hold Draco like this every night— now and fucking forever. ‘
“Yes.”
The worst part of the ceremony was not, in fact, watching the first man she’d ever loved look at another person in ways he’d never looked at her. No. The hardest part was trying not to look at him the same way— trying not to look at him as if he were the sun and she didn’t care if her retinas burnt because
Draco didn’t speak– which she guessed she deserved, since she’d asked him to stop. But she so badly wished he hadn’t listened. She wished he had listened so many years ago instead of staring at her dumbfounded now. She truly wondered if he knew what he’d done. But he didn’t walk away, and that was something. She stared at him through the tears– standing stiffly halfway across the room, staring at the wall behind her. She couldn’t decode his expression– there was emotion, but not one she recognized. It was hard and cold, but soft enough to suggest the stone wall he’d built around himself was beginning to crumble. She prayed he would stay long enough for her to destroy the rest of the wall.
It was the wedding she always dreamed of. One she would likely never have.
Hermione’s heart stopped.
She wondered if he would judge her now, as she haphazardly raised her glass to join her friends in a toast, sloshing the red liquid onto the white tablecloth. It stained like blood. She wondered if he’d eventually see the stain and think of her, because he’d once said that she was
to her– lips that expected her to
“No. I came of my own accord.” Draco said. His tone was dry– empty.
But this time, it was not her who had spoken his name. Hermione turned her head towards the source of the voice, and gasped when she realized it belonged to none other than Harry Potter-Malfoy.
She gripped a glass of elven wine and tried not to remember the nights her father swung her around their family kitchen, instructing her on how to move her feet to the tune.
wearing white.
“It never ends. You scream and scream until your screams turn into a chorus of the screams of every single person I was forced to torture, but yours is still the loudest.” A grimace formed on his lips. “It’s you laying on that floor, green surrounding your entire body, and I just stare. I stare, and I stare until it’s me holding that wand. And you keep fucking screaming, and I can’t fucking stop. I’m completely fucking frozen. The world around us is frozen too. Except for you. You’re writhing on the floor. Shaking, trying to crawl away.”
But that was not the answer Hermione was looking for. With the alcohol muddying her brain and coursing through her veins, she felt the urge to interrogate him– to grill him for every ounce of emotion she could provoke before he left her all alone again.
“When I listened to the Dark Lord and my father talk before the war, they always spoke about moving the fight to Italy if all else failed. Voldemort never planned on dying, of course, so the plan went severely awry, and most of the Death Eaters who survived had chosen to go light before they could get killed by the Order, so they never made it to Italy either.” Draco muttered. “But what we did not account for, and what I did not know, is that Voldemort had already moved
Some days she was good at forgetting, other days not so much. But on September 19th, Hermione forgot her own birthday.
she remembered the name. How could she forget? After all, her mother had just smiled and laughed when Hermione announced that this soft little muggle song might be featured at her future wedding, because Gods, she loved it so much.
“You’re what? Getting PTSD from the fucking drawing room floor, Malfoy? Getting second thoughts about gracing me with your holy presence?”
looking at her. “Say something,
The shop remained empty for nearly an hour. She passed the time by eating a granola bar and skimming through an autobiography of an Italian political figure she’d never heard of. When the bell on the front door chimed, she winced at the sound. It was almost worse than the blaring music from her car.
Draco began to use his hands while he talked, something Hermione had noticed he only did when he was agitated. She began to understand that the situation he was describing had to be severe. She tried her best to fight confusion and process the information– treat this like another debriefing from the war– but his words sounded like a morning alarm in her mind.
Ron, on the other hand, had not married. In
Draco nodded and took a visibly deep breath before leaving the room. Hermione watched him leave without the pang of longing in her chest.
The couple didn’t buy anything– which irked Hermione to her very core. People who mosied through the shop with no real intentions of buying anything were the worst customers: she always had to determine whether they were thieves or simply just window-shoppers there to waste her time. The balding man brought four books to her counter and asked which one she would recommend. Having read none of the novels in front of her, Hermione pointed at the book on the far right because its cover was pretty. The man thanked her profusely and shoved money onto the counter. He had overpaid slightly, but he told her to keep the change. It was €6, enough to actually buy a book. Hermione weighed her options in her head: alcohol or a book?
He opened his mouth but a moment passed before he spoke. “I– I can’t do that.”
found her. She was so busy hiding from Harry and her friends, she’d done nothing to hide from potential enemies. She’d been living unwarded for five years, hoping the blonde hair and muggle garden would keep her safe. She’d never thought about enemies. Only Draco and how desperately she needed to forget him.
Hermione winced as he took a single step forward. She felt the earth shake under his stride. Draco’s face was still hidden in shadow, but she allowed her mind to form an image of what she might see once her eyes adjusted to the light. She imagined his lips pressed into a thin, condescending line with no distinguishable difference between a smile and a frown, and his eyes frozen in a cold, emotionless gaze– just warm enough to appear approachable to someone unaccustomed to the sparkle they once held. He would never be cold enough to the common eye– never cold enough to be confused with the man people wanted him to be. Only cold enough to show he was no longer the man
And that was it; he didn't want to disappoint anybody, especially his parents. Merlin knew if his nosy homeroom teacher would tell them, but if he did, Draco was certain he was done for. He had never been close to his parents (most rich kids weren't, he assumed, or he hoped) and the only string holding them consisted of hopes and expectations that he didn't dare to cross. But here he was, making a mess out of his life. Again.
Oh Merlin was it a secret.
syllable-"
"But I don't even know you!" Draco protested.
See, Harry found it hard to keep on being angry once ‘love’ came out of those sinful lips. He couldn’t fight the grin coming out his face. “Yes, yes whatever. I love you too, even though you’re the worst asshole to ever exist. Embarrassing us in front of my godson, Draco, my underage, innocent godson—”
being
Harry snickered. His hand loomed over Draco's before retreating. "The problem is more your environment isn't it? If you had made that mistake, at least you wouldn't be brooding over it so much like now."
She asked, “didn’t that library burn down over a thousand years ago?” She didn’t know if they rebuilt it or not.
She huffed and scolded her, “you should’ve thought of that before putting your name in.”
She made her way towards the scepters. She was no longer in second. Seven contestants lay between her and the scepters. She ran towards them. With her increased leg strength she made up the distance easily. Jumping two gaps and running around another pit of mud she made it nearly to the end. Just two large, ugly, and dangerous obstacles lay between her and a scepter.
George proclaimed, “why Fred, we had the wrong table at first. This is our table.”
Ginny could do nothing but watch and be led around in awe at his incredibleness on the floor. She was amazed and astounded. The whole time he stuck by her side as well. He always wanted to dance with her, even when she was having trouble keeping up. Some other girls would come up to ask for dances but he would say no and that he was there with Ginny.
The three of them were standing around trying to figure out what happened. Arlene looked to him and asked, “what is this place? Is this part of the trial?”
He had already put it on. “Thank you. It looks nice too.” He told Luna and Ginny, “sorry, I don’t have gifts for you guys. I’ve had a lot on my plate lately.”
The raven could only shake his head and start stomping down the guest room, face still burning and undeniably as red as the Weasley hair. He jumped onto the bed with crossed arms. “You shameless asshole!”
"Oh, am I ruining your me time?"
my life forever because I am so done with your bullshit.”
Slytherins aren't as simple-minded as you lot, after all. I was wishing, hoping, that with this," he trailed off slowly, motioning to the perfume, "You would be interested in eating me,
"You're more scared of your parents than of school?"
"I meant tomorrow and the tomorrows after, you doofus." Harry rolled his eyes with a smile. "So, can we? I have a cafe I like, since that's what people apparently like nowadays. Or we can just sit on whichever bench you want, if you prefer that."
"Why'd anyone be scared of something as trivial as school? I don't even care about it, I just care about my grades."
"Sure. I like whatever; cafes, benches, doesn't matter. Here, give me your phone."
When the war was over, the first thing that Draco did was dye his hair. He didn't get rid of the platinum blond, he loved his hair as he was undeniable and proudly vain. He simply added some soft highlights of pastel colors that made him look ethereal, more than he already was. He was a Malfoy, and if he decided to abandon the name that'd brought him thus far, regardless of at which point (very bad) he was in at the moment, he'd be even worse than a coward. He resolved to change, both himself and the very thing that'd been ingrained in his blood since birth, very literally.
"Maybe," he said. "What are you doing out here in this weather, anyway?"
"Excuse me, did I hear that right? You came here, barging in like some uncultured swine-"
Draco briefly wondered what Harry thought of him as a person. Perhaps he'd even gone and assumed the blond had no friends and was a loner, but the truth was, everyone in Slytherin knew how to socialize and they did it well.
"I'm flattered you think that way, Draco, but I'm not gay."
"Yes, waltz, geez Malfoy." He rolled his eyes, attempting to return the sense of rivalry that had since been long gone. "If you didn't want to, you could've just said-"
," Draco continued, entering a weird state of monologue and completely ignoring his boyfriend's existence, as per usual every time he wished to mock Harry. Even so, he still addressed Harry, "Dearest Potter, I came upon this perfume in an online shop and decided to buy it—because muggles make the most curious things," he said while he rummaged through his large dressing table, "And viola!"
It seemed a month of bonding was enough to make one fall head over heels for another. Harry had found out firsthand during that winter. Perhaps it was indeed the sexual tension hanging in the air between them since day one, but—
Harry had a habit.
If he'd fallen asleep in class every day, he'd have to say goodbye to his prince title. And probably his parents' sanity. His friends would think his sanity had flown out the window then, and he would agree.
Their footsteps, in unison, clicked against the stones.
"Potter, why in Merlin's name do you only have one shoe?" Draco's nose wrinkled at the sight of the grey, dripping sock. Harry gripped the back of his neck, flushing at the state of his appearance.
“Sorry.” He offered.
Draco swore, "Accio Potter's shoes." He waited for another pair of shoes to come careening toward the courtyard by the lake. None came. Draco reached into his pockets for something to transfigure, wishing he hadn’t banished the handkerchief. He didn't have anything else with him. The loose pebbles on the courtyard floor were less than ideal. He wasn't sure with the way his heart raced he'd be able to transfigure something anyway. Biting his lip, he examined the wilting Harry Potter. Without another thought, he scooped Harry into his arms and ran toward the castle's hospital wing.
at least once." Professor Snape turned away to stir one of the cauldrons simmering in the corner. But that wasn't an answer. Against his better judgment, Harry slid off his stool to follow him. The metal legs creaked beneath his weight. He shuffled across the stones to stand beside the man.
He brought them to the little side table, sinking back into the plush cushion, “Which kind of tea would you like, I’ve got black, green, earl grey, blueberry, orange-jasmine, peppermint, or chamomile?” Harry bit his lip, “Or I’ll just surprise you?” Nodding, Harry watched him fix the tea, “You picked what has to be the simplest set of cups I have in the shop, Potter.”
Draco's hand locked around Harry's forearm, dragging him up and away from the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall. His fork clattered to his forcefully abandoned plate with a half-eaten stack of pancakes. The dark-haired Gryffindor called an apology behind him to Neville. He promised to catch up with him later to hear more about the medicinal qualities of Shrivel fig. But any reply was lost in the groaning of the wooden doors of the sparsely populated Great Hall.
“It would seem the writ does not want to take any chances with Mr. Potter’s safety.” His dark gaze settled on Harry, “I suggest you make yourself comfortable. For the time being, you’re not going anywhere.” Harry nodded, “I’ll arrange it with the elves to have meals delivered for you. We’ll determine a course of action for your coursework on Monday, if necessary.”
"Good to see you both awake and in high spirits, though I only recall having one patient last night." Draco offered a sheepish smile to Madam Pomfrey, straightening up his sweater.
“You’ve never seen Blaise when he’s angry. Besides, the writ wouldn’t have been triggered if I wasn’t actually in danger,” Draco huffed. He turned, addressing his new house members, “Yes, hello everyone. I’m Draco Malfoy, a temporary member of your house and Harry’s boyfriend. Feel free to return to your own business-” He might have gone on if Harry hadn’t shut him up with a peck on the lips.
Harry shook his head fast enough that some of the excess cream sprayed out of his hair. Draco grimaced, wiping the flecks off his cheeks.
The door swung shut, leaving a flustered Draco behind.
Swearing under his breath, Harry threw on his slippers and chased the snitch down the hall. He leaped for it, but it flitted out of reach. Luna wandered out of her own room, her bunny slippers bobbling on the stone floor. She grinned at the sight of the snitch in the air.
"What about them?"
Snape bent over Harry's pale form in the bed that had appeared for him next to Draco's own bed in the Fifth-year boys’ room. He clicked his tongue, drawing the blanket up over the boy's shoulders before turning back to Draco. In a hushed tone, he addressed the blond.
"I'm sure even a dunderhead like yourself has read
One of the other fifth years strode into the common room and dropped onto a squashy cushion across from Harry.
Harry squinted at Luna’s scrawl on the page. Kiss me like I’m Draco. Beside the words was a crudely drawn picture of the snitch. He rolled his eyes, letting the paper fall to the table. He ignored the snitch in favor of getting dressed. But once he’s pulled one of his Weasley sweaters over his head and buttoned his jeans, he found himself drifting back to the side table where the snitch sat.
"How do you always know what to say and do to make it better?" Harry asked. Draco shrugged. He pulled Harry in closer to swing his door open and carried him inside the room. Dropping Harry on the bed, Draco smirked and smoothed the sheets over him. They settled onto the mattress, curling their fingers together and their legs intertwined.
“Good morning,” He began, reaching for a slice of toast from the tray between them, “sleep well?” Harry took a long sip of his pumpkin juice. The cup clinked down on the tabletop. He shrugged in response to the question, snatching up a rasher of bacon and dropping it on his plate. Harry tapped the edge of the tray as if to offer it to Draco, but the Slytherin declined the bacon, “I slept wonderfully, in case you were wondering. The quiet is really doing wonders for me.” Harry stuck his tongue out at Draco in reply, “Shame this little game will all be over once we go to class, isn’t it?”
"Who, the niffler?" Luna asked. Harry shook his head, "Oh, you mean Draco Malfoy." Harry almost choked on his cocoa, "Yes, let's put some into a tin for him. Then you can give them to him when you tell him you like him."
"You break it, you buy it, Potter." A voice broke the silence behind him. The hairs stood up on the back of Harry's neck. Harry snapped his hand back from the teacup like someone smacked it. He whirled around to face none other than Draco Malfoy. Eyes wide, he took in the blond. They hadn't seen each other since they left Hogwarts three years ago. Draco looked taller, dressed in pinstripe trousers and a matching waistcoat. The rolled-up sleeves of his white shirt were crispy pressed, "Is there something I can do for you, Potter?"
Harry hesitantly ordered one of his pawns to move forward in response. Blaise ordered the ruthless execution of that pawn. Pulling his knees into his chest, Harry told one of the pawns on the other side to make its move.
Draco threw back his blanket. He dressed and tugged his fingers through his hair before venturing back to the common room. Knowing that Potter never came back had kept him awake for what little sleep he could have gotten. He walked into the common room, ready for another outburst. But instead found Harry curled up on the stone floor in front of the enchanted window.
She waved bye to him and he returned the wave while leaving.
Dumbledore boomed, “SILENCE!” All noise in the hall stopped. “The trials in the tournament are dangerous and only students at the seventh year level will be able to handle them.” His demeanor changed to his more normal one. Arlene still noticed the madness in his eyes. “Now, off to bed everyone.”
Severus Pov
So it was almost a relief when he asked her, “do you want to go spend some time outside?”
Ginny spotted her and rushed to her. They met in a hug. As soon as they separated someone else hugged her from behind. She caught a glimpse of pale blonde hair and realized it was Luna. she let go of her and hugged Ginny.
Sirius raised an eyebrow. “And the one we’re trying to bring back?”
Draco shoved his hands in his pockets to keep them out of sight. He had to swallow before asking, “um, Harry, there’s something I wanted to ask you. Can we speak alone for a minute?”
True to her word something was spotted moving over the forbidden forest. Students began pointing it out. Ginny said, “finally, about time.”
Resuming her cooking, she said, “I know. They’re going to keep him there all day. I don’t know why. He runs the department that deals with muggle artifacts that have been enchanted. I don’t know what that has to do with what happened at the world cup.” She shook her head with a tired sigh.
“Your help in making a potion that will put a dragon to sleep.” She delivered it well enough that he was stunned into silence for a few seconds.
Now invisible, he passed right by a lighthouse that looked ancient. He pointed to it and said, “based on what my research says that’s where the entrance to the library is.”
Harry said, “if it is a group effort then Arlene could do something to distract while Ron and I use as many stunning spells on it that we can.” He looked to all of them for their thoughts.
As if to emphasize his thought another roar sounded through the air. After a few minutes of stiff silence Ludo Bagman, Professors Dumbledore and Karkaroff with Madame Maxine walked in the tent. Mr. Bagman said, “good day champions now by now it’s obvious that you’re going up against dragons.” He made motions to gather them around. He went on, “Now all you have to do is get past the dragon, grab the golden egg, and get away from it.” He raised his hands in a carefree gesture and said, “simple no?”
While Hermione talked and Luna wrote her words down Arlene thought on what she was hearing. Her own thoughts began to run rampant. How did the house elves get to this point? At one point they had to be their own independent species. They didn’t evolve into serving wizards. They weren’t created by wizards. At some point they started being slaves for wizards and forgot how to stop. Hermione paused so Arlene took the opportunity to ask, “when did the slavery of house elves begin?”
They looked at each other. Then back to her and Fred answered, “we saw the article and started spreading our opinion. We changed a few hearts and minds.”
Luna leaned in towards Harry and whispered, “I know how you feel. I like girls.” His head whipped around. Ginny watched as they smiled at each other. It was as if they had found some new friendship over facing similar harsh realities. Despite the fact that one of them liked boys and the other liked girls.
They sat down but almost immediately an Egyptian woman approached them and asked in English, “Mrs. Connery? Please follow me to the magical families histories section.” They stood up and followed her to a different elevator. This one was part of one of the marble pillars and it took them up. She explained to her as they traveled, “this is the largest magical library in the world. It boasts over ten billion books from all ages and all places. Some places that don’t even exist anymore. We serve magical peoples from all over the world on a daily basis.”
Arlene was enraptured by the pyramids. They had appeared behind a stone hut so no muggles would see them come in. Stepping out from behind it revealed that they were right next to them. It reached high in the air. The sheer scale of them was more than impressive. The people next to them appeared to be nothing more than ants.
He chuckled and answered, “I don’t know if that’s a good thing or a bad thing. Some great adventures come from that sometimes. Other times not.” He took a drink from his mug. “It can’t hurt I guess.”
Mr. Bagman told the room, “there is nothing to sort out. She will participate just like any other student. How her name got in the goblet is not an issue. It was likely a small prank gone wrong.” He turned to the champions and went on, “you will receive information on where the first tournament will take place with the rest of the schools. Be prepared for anything. You won’t know the details of the first tournament until the day of. Good luck.” He gave them all two thumbs up them walked out. The rest of the champions followed suit.
The song went on for several minutes with Luna humming it under her breath as they danced. When the song ended they moved to the buffet tables. She had enjoyed the dance but being out in front of so many people, lesbian or not, had made her nervous.
Ginny narrowed her eyes at her and said, “am I the one who needs protection right now?” Arlene showed her the amulet that she had gotten herself. Ginny nodded in approval. Then she opened Luna’s gift. Luna had gotten her a jersey from the Hollyhead Harpies. She smiled and told Luna, “thank you. This is great.” She looked at Arlene and reassured her, “I love your gift too Arlene. It is very nice of you.”
Arlene told him, “I can tell her that you’re here. I don’t know if she found out.”
The Durmstrang girl stood up and cracked her knuckles. Krum told her, “stop. There is no point in fighting here. If you think you are better than prove it in the tournament.” He nodded to Arlene. She decided he wasn’t too bad.
Dumbledore had started talking again. “With this will come the greatest prize of all. Eternal glory, forever being renowned as the winner of the tournament that restored the name of the Triwizard tournament to its full glory.” He spread his arms as students clapped and cheered. “Now off to bed all of you. It will be an exciting day tomorrow.”
“We’ll get there,” Harry reassured her. He leaned back in his chair. “every trial removes three champions from the game. Except the last which only removes two and leaves the final challenger.” He pointed between the two of them, “the great man who helped us out of our hell holes for homes, Professor Barnes, left a rule book on his desk a few days after the choosing of the champions.”
They passed by the forbidden forest. They all flinched when the first roar sounded through the trees. McGonagall urged them on, “come on, we have to keep moving.” At the top of a hill was a stadium that had been built over the last few weeks. Next to it was the same tent that had been at the first trial. They entered in a door that was on the far side of the stadium. On the inside they could see a tunnel that led to the stadium. There was a curtain blocking the view into it though.
They both turned to her and asked in unison, “what makes you think we know?”
They reached a new portkey that the Weasleys were all touching. Author waved them over and screamed, “Hurry! Only a few seconds left!” The three of them grabbed on to the old guitar case that served as the portkey. Mere seconds later they were whisked away.
Arlene began weighing the pros and cons of each potion in front of her. She also included her ability to brew them. Over half of them she hadn’t even heard of. She had always been good at potions. Not as good as she was at alchemy but still well above average.
Back in the Great Hall the visiting students had to squeeze in with the rest of the students although more chairs had been added to each table it still seemed an unnecessary inconvenience. A girl from Durmstrang squeezed herself in between Arlene and a Ravenclaw boy.
The stadium exploded with cheers as the troll handlers moved in to remove the beasts from the arena. The cleanup crew was already working to remove the obstacles from the Quidditch field. She couldn’t even hear the announcements over the cheers.
The gaggle of Ravenclaws reached Hagrid’s hut. He was already waiting outside. He waved them along and said, “this way please.” They followed him along the tree line at the edge of the forest. “Thought about going easy this year but there’s no fun in that. So we’re caring for Bicorns this year.”
Arlene waited until everyone was turned away and began drying her with her own magic. It felt good to literally let off some heat as she was still angry at the bully. She pushed a breeze of heated air at Luna’s hair and clothes to get the water out of them. Within minutes she was dry and Arlene only felt a little drained from it. They walked to their next class.
She had an entire tray of potions next to his table. She was making him drink every single one. He would need all of them.
Until today.
Then he woke up in his bed covered in sweat and panting deeply. He didn’t know how he knew but he knew that he had actually talked to Lily. He also knew she wasn’t happy with him. She wanted him to be nicer to Harry and move on from her. This event is what got to him. This is what moved him to become the man that he was needed to be.
They laughed and sat down with them. They received less odd looks with the twins there. All the students liked them so it was hard to judge them for doing the same thing. They laughed and made jokes. It sent most of the gloom away but not all of it. In the back of her mind Arlene knew the first trial was looming over her like storm clouds. Soon the thunder would be on them.
That gave Arlene hope for her idea. Her method of putting it to sleep was different though. She didn’t know how long the potion would take to put an effect on the dragon.
On the last day of school Ginny spoke to them.
Professor Karkaroff looked like he wanted to argue but couldn’t. He huffed loudly and said, “fine, but only since it is the one who will win in the end anyway.” He beamed at Krum who seemed to be breathing heavy but otherwise bored.
She knocked on Professor Flitwick’s office. He opened the door and looked up at her. “Miss Connery, how can I help you today?”
Weeks passed for Arlene with contentment. Her third elective, Gobblygook, was going well. As always she excelled at her classes. Impressing all the Professors. Even Professor Snape seemed to be nicer to her. Although the rumor was that he was being a little nicer to everyone, especially Draco and Harry.
They moved through an area that wasn’t being worked on yet and met with Hagrid. He saw them coming. He raised a hand in a wave. “Hey you three. Like the beauties?”
She looked up to the staff table to see Adrian was outright glaring at the goblet. He looked angry at it for some reason.
She left the dorms and went to dinner. When she got to the Great Hall she found Luna and sat next to her. She asked, “are you prepared for tomorrow?”
Luna said, “I’ll take one as well please.” She nodded and left to go get their drinks. When she left Luna said, “she remembered you. I like her.” It was such a simple statement but having the approval of Luna Lovegood would mean a great amount to those who knew her.
“Wait, we learned about a war?” Ginny had no idea what the lesson had been on.
He asked Hagrid, “so how’s the inside of your hut? You’ve been in there for a while you must know it well.” He remained silent. Adrian wasn’t going to give that easy. “you know my daughter, Arlene, and her friends have been asking to see you again. They say they miss you. No matter how much they knock on your door you seem to ignore them.”
Ludo Bagman and Mr. Crouch came forward. Mr. Bagman exclaimed, “I never expected anyone to get past the trolls that way.”
Take the normal dragon and add motherly instincts to protect their eggs at any costs. They were not rivaled by basilisks and giants. They hunted them. Male dragons made for bad fathers because the mothers will drive them off violently. A mother dragon will stop at nothing to protect her children. It is the dominant species on the planet. All the magic in the world wouldn’t help you if a mother dragon rips you in half.
Voldemort kept having to stop fighting the death eaters to shield himself from Harry’s spells. Harry continued to attack Voldemort while screaming at him. He only stopped the spells and didn’t say anything to him. He would take cover from Harry to attack the death eaters.
He nodded again and said, “I’ll open up to them. I should’ve known better than to think Harry and the others would’ve judged me. Especially Luna, I don’t think she’s capable of judging anyone harshly for something they can’t help.”
He recovered enough to reply, “you want to put an adult dragon to sleep?” She nodded. He nodded than told her, “take a seat. We’ll look at your options.” He went over the potions that would give her a chance.
She flinched back as Harry explained, “that means more students from the other schools will move ahead with us. That lowers our chances of success.” He leaned forward and almost seemed to be pleading. “Please, I know you didn’t want this but you don’t have to win. You just have to make it to the third trial. Or at least the second so we have a better chance to help Ron win. It’ll help Ginny too.”
He left her then. She wasn’t sure what to make of that. There was nothing that Luna and her particularly needed a room alone for. It would be nice to kiss her without someone watching. Even if it gave them nothing but privacy that would be nice.
After the three of them stopped laughing Arlene told them, “I have to go give my parents their gifts.”
Joan told Adrian in between breaths, “it was Skeeter. She shot something at the dragon while her photographer made the copies vanish. I saw them.”
Instead he mulled over his life decisions. Anytime someone got close to Lily he hated them. Her sister, Potter, her school friends. Why did he hate them? He knew the answer: he saw them all as competition for him. Which wasn’t a good reason in all honesty.
The rocks looked harder to run and jump on leaving only the dirt to move on. The mud pits were more frequent as well as the gaps and pitfalls. Then at the end, flanking the row of scepters, were two enormous trolls with muzzles over their mouths. “Shit,” she breathed but continued.
Adrian looked at him. “Sirius, I know it hurts. The wrongs that have happened and are happening will be brought to light. Either through legal means or not legal means.”
No one expected the Raven to respond. It did. “Oh okay, This year is going to be real fun for you then. You’ll get my best work. I hope you like sleeping on the floor.”
“It seems kind of dumb.”
They got their money and left. They went to the robes store first to get new robes. Something was off from the moment they walked in. Madam Malkin wasn’t as talkative as normal. She was faster with the measurements and once they had the robes she urged them to pay fast. She was polite but she seemed to be urging them to leave.
Arlene Pov.
His eyebrows furrowed. “Yes, but the details are fuzzy. That’s just one correlation. It still might be something else.”
She couldn’t help but return her smile. No matter what was happening Luna always had a positive attitude. This made her relax and feel warm inside.
Was that his fault?
He went back and barged in saying, “we’re being watched. You two no longer have a hand in this.” He grabbed the vial of his blood and told them, “I’m performing the ritual in a remote location far from here.”
Joan pulled her into a hug and gripped her tightly. They were standing by the doors to the entrance hall. For a long time they stood there. Joan let Arlene cry on her shoulder.
From the bag Bastion pulled a Swedish short snout.
She commented, “not what I was expecting.” This was less grandeur and more modern than she had seen coming. A simple shed that led to an elevator that anyone could get into didn’t seem like the way into the largest library in the world.
She was greeted by the sight of dozens of house elves. None of them stopped working except for one. The only one with any semblance of clothes ran up to her and said, “welcome to the kitchens, my name is Dobby. May I ask your name perchance?”
