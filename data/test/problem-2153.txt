McGonagall looks at him discerningly then.  He supposes all old hands at teaching must have a similar expression.  His pride vanishes in an instant leaving him on tenterhooks.  While he has never felt the press of her mind, he has occasionally wondered if she was trained in some legilimency.
It's curry night when Dad declares they're going out for dinner.  Unusual for his dad who loves to cook and stay home.  Usually Jamie’s the one who begs to go out, so he's excited when they get to the muggle restaurant.  He’s had pizza before of course, but he’s never seen it made like this.  The people behind the counters have a show of kneading the dough while others spin it in the air.  There are large brick ovens in back where the bakers put the pizzas in on large wooden spatulas that they’re told are called pizza peels.
“She wanted you strong.  You were her heir too.”  Lucius reasons.  Expression grim.  The worst part is that he can understand his father’s line of thinking.  Lucius’ obsession with power and wielding it and the determination that his son should too.  Draco used to eat it all up as sacrosanct.
“Oh, yes.  I know this one,” Draco says, expression turning triumphant.  “And I wondered where James gets it.”
“Are you certain I can’t get you a drink, Weasley?”  Draco offers, directing the teapot to fill the cups.  “There’s green tea or Darjeeling?”
“Shitting Merlin, Maud’s gone!”  He swears again.  Anxiety gripping him.  What if they couldn’t find her?  What if Bixby found her first?  How were they going to cover this up?
He feels a bit bad when he shakes his head.  Slightly embarrassed by their captive audience.  The last thing he wants is to make Lily unhappy on her birthday, but he must disabuse her of this notion.
Harry releases a shaky breath he didn’t realize he was holding.  “Draco, sweet Merlin.”  He gasps as goosebumps break out over his skin.  “My god.”
Harry sighs frowning.  “I knew something wasn’t quite right and I didn’t follow through.  I see how much he's improved already, and I can’t believe I let it go so long.”
Harry scratches his neck, thinking. “It’s just Hargreeves only sees me maybe every other month when it's usually checkups, and then it’s never at the same time.  Like I said, I have my kids when I’m not working, so I took a half day today.”
“Mummies grow them in their bellies.”  Rosie answers him distractedly with a roll of her eyes beside her brother.
“Yes.  Yes, of course.”  Hermione agrees sounding weepy.  She puts her glass down on the brickwork and hugs him tightly.  “We love you, Harry.”  She tells him.  Harry pats her arm and looks at Ron bewildered but relieved.  Ron shrugs, expression suggesting this is what Harry gets when he says something so personal.
After a while, Harry notices a pattern emerge.  Malfoy will meet up with him where Harry’s schedule allows.  Often arranged the day of with a quickly scribbled note from Harry he sends by his owl, Hestia.  They will talk or eat depending, Malfoy will do some quick diagnostics, and if neither has anywhere to be immediately, they will lapse back into conversation.
“I see.”  Harry responds.  This could be problematic.  He may have to blindly choose and hope for the best.  All the food he had seen brought out seemed small in portion and not quite edible in appearance.  He much preferred heartier food.
“And you can ask it to bring up a certain album too.”  Potter had demonstrated asking the device aloud, apparently also called seeri, although Draco was unsure how the device was a seeri too.  He imagined because it allowed muggles to see the images.
“I like bathrooms.”  Draco says suddenly.  Still facing away from Harry.  “The sound of running water always comforted me.  So I hid in them all the time as a child when I was upset.  Thought no one could disturb me there.  I was not allowed to be upset; you see – not with my parents at any rate.  It’s stupid.”
“Weasley,” Draco drawls, “Are you maybe . . . possibly . . . being a tad homophobic?”  He suggests, trailing off at the end.
“NO!  No – sorry!” Harry shouts, stuttering to a stop as he comprehends he yelled all that straight into the man’s face.  Feeling his own face flush.  “That’s not right.  Sorry.  I will be your friend.  I’d
“I ruined it right?”  Draco speaks voice breaking.  “We’ve never talked about it outright.  It was nice to pretend we could be friends – that you would care at all - but I cannot change what I am, and you cannot change who you are.”  Harry watches Draco shake his head.  Feeling torn between comforting the man and hearing him out.  “It was foolish to convince myself of anything else.”  Draco continues harshly.  “Astoria always says I’m too focused on the past – that I need to focus on what choices I have in front of me.
“Oh?”  Draco voices intelligently, blinking owlishly.  Warm all over and a bit tipsy.  It is the loveliest sensation.  The base of his spine is tingling where Potter is resting his hand.
Her expression is piercing as ever.  Making him feel like a first year in his first transfiguration class all over again.  “You have done wonderful work here.  I notice the fencing outside reflects your particular affinity with repurposing metals.  I am glad to see your skill has not waned.”
Draco does not react really to Ron.  Or even acknowledge that he is there.  Eyes skittering away like something is moving off to the side.
“We’ve not gone on holiday, Mother.”  Draco retorted, causing his mother to lift her brow in disapproval.  “The seal doesn’t need to be removed now or ever.”
Draco is excited for their trip and looking over at Harry it is obvious his boyfriend feels the same.  Grinning back at him.  Green eyes shining.
“Hi, Al.”  Gabby greets, smiling widely.  Draco notices she is missing one of her front teeth.  He remembers when she was born.  She was the first baby he ever held.  Also, the first baby to vomit on him.
“But it’s the summer.”  He comments unable to stop himself, feeling entertained and making grabby hands at plate Draco brings him.
“I’m sorry you had to overhear that.”  Dad apologizes, forehead lining.  “Tonight was a mess.  I lost my temper a bit and that's not okay.”
“Feels – yes.”  Draco answers, trying for some coherency and failing.  “Love you.  Faster.  Please.”  He groans out.  Whining, until Harry brings their lips together again.  Complying with his request.
The expression on Draco’s face communicates that would be a no.  “If you thought I had a storeroom’s inventory of belongings put away then you will be upset to learn how much my mother has stowed.”
“Are you really this paranoid?”  Harry interrupts, unable to stop himself.  “Really?  After all these years?”
Bill Weasley advised the charm might help take control of the place.  He told Harry he had seen it work wonders on wizarding homes where the family was feuding over ownership and they had cursed the other out of the property.  But the manor was much larger and older than in those cases.  Also, Draco did not want Bill involved.  Harry was trying to honor that but figured it didn't hurt to ask Bill and forget to mention his source of information.
He never considered himself good around children - when he did even consider them at all.  Potter had shown him a recent picture on the muggle cellular device he owns while they were sat in a corner booth at a muggle café near Draco’s own flat.  He had been careful when holding the device as Harry showed him how to scroll to another photo.
I love writing Lucius.  This chapter is one of my few planned out attempts at serious plot for this story.  I'm too enamored with fluff most of the time.  As always, I own nothing.  Thanks for reading.  All comments and kudos are so very appreciated!
“I see.”  Luna acknowledges nodding to herself.  “Unfortunately, we cannot remain hidden back here during the dinner party.  Your little crup would do all she could to join us even then which would cause more fuss.”
Every point where their skin touches is heady for Harry.  He loves how Draco’s skin feels against his own.  The way Draco’s muscles react instinctively.  Flexing or shuddering at his touch.  Fine scars and hair sparking contrasting sensations along his body but especially in his own scarred leg and hip.  Loves the smell of them together as they begin to sweat and move more easily against one another.  He wants to lick every inch of his boyfriend’s skin.  Instead he focuses on kissing Draco.  Breathing deeply through his nose and leisurely entwining their tongues as they snog.
“No, Malfoy.”  Harry forces himself to say without gritting his teeth.  He can be an adult here.  “No issues there.”  He would have brought that up with his healer if it was.  He did not have much of a ‘love life,’ as Hermione would call it, but he still managed to pull at the muggle pubs he visited the few times a year when he found an odd weekend here or there alone.
When Draco draws back from the kiss to gasp for air and grapple for some semblance of rationality.  Potter remains close, looking steadily at him, but he seems to get the message that Draco needs a moment.  Draco swallows once to see Potter’s familiar green eyes so dilated, eyes lidded.  Potter breaks into a grin, chuckling under his breath as his head tips forward, bringing their foreheads together.
“How dare you.”  He cracks back.  Reading through his options.  He does really intend to see this out.  Draco liked places like this and so did all his friends.  If he had to overhear his boyfriend sharing another story with Astoria about eating dinosaur-shaped chicken nuggets with their children, it would be too soon.
“Indeed.”  Severus concurs, frowning.  “Unfortunately, as much as I enjoy our conversations, Draco, you are in grave danger now.  I fear you do not even know the extent of it.”
“Daddy, can we have spaghetti tonight?”  Lily asks.  Jamie is certain she checked out of the conversation once she realized she wasn’t in trouble.  Her vote would be for Draco to date Dad anyhow.  Lily believed Draco visited just to see her.  She even put him in her pictures she sent to Mum with their weekly letter.
“Severus?”  He calls, confused.  Scanning the area around him until he finds his old potions professor.  Standing several yards away, facing away from Draco and staring out the wide paned window down to the courtyard below.  Hands clasped tightly behind his robed back.
It's not as obvious with Draco, but nothing ever was.  There is no doubt in his mind he wants to be with this man for the rest of his life.  They aren't perfect.  No couple is.  But they are right for each other.  If they got married, it would purely be for them.
“No, mate.”  Ron Weasley says, sounding far away.  “There’s no way.  He should still be sedated.  They gave him more Calming Draught than I’ve ever seen a person get.”
Harry imagines if he had not found the portrait of Walburga Black in the charred rubble of the main foyer at the manor, finally still and smoking at the edges and forever stuck in a hilariously unfortunate scowl with her eyes crossed; she would have screamed in a manner reminiscent of the time the Order of the Phoenix stayed at Grimmauld at the two women in her family attempting a reconciliation.
“And their wee little socks.”  Ron adds, looking wistful.  Harry chuckles at his friend.  Ron loved babies and babies loved Ron.  The man was his mother all over again.
“Oh right, this is Ephraim Doge.”  Harry introduces, gesturing to each of them for his boyfriend. “And Amanda Clearwater and Cleo Talbot.  They're aurors in my squad.  You might have heard the sprogs talking about Clearwater.  She’s babysat for me before.  You lot seem to know Draco.”
“I wanted to talk more about you meeting my kids.”  He clarifies.  It was time.  He had been content to wait and see where their relationship was going, but now he knew.  For him, this was the final piece he had yet to share with Draco.
The calls he makes are raspy and he doubts they can be heard over the sounds of the groaning building.  The dark, wooden slats of the floor are peeling upward.  Splintering in the fire.  He peers through the smoke where the floor opens to the foundation underneath.  Light from the fire making something metallic glimmer, sparking orange and purple in his vision.
“You split your head open riding it.”  Ron remarks, bemused.  “I thought Ginny sold it.  She hated it enough after you crashed it.”
“Forgive me for wanting to find out if Harry screwed Draco before he screwed him.”  Hermione responds testily.  “It could've been a honeypot.”
They are making something simple tonight: lemon chicken.  Hopefully, it will be simple enough.  Draco has made some of the most complicated, time-sensitive potions in the world but never cooked for himself.  It bewilders Harry.  Cooking was easy compared to potion making and many of the skills are transferable.  It seems simple to him.
The master bedroom is on the second floor, tucked in the back where they pass a library, hallway bathroom, and the children’s playroom.  Potter has the decency to look a little shy while he observes Draco looking around.  Inside the master suite, there is a small sitting room with a wardrobe and body-length mirror.  The master bath and walk in closet doors are both open.  Soft light emanating from the bathroom.  Draco spies marble tiled floors where he passes.
“It has been,” Draco cuts in, eyes still focused on the chessboard.  Frowning down at his remaining pieces.  “Challenging.”
His friend appears to consider this, looking down at his cup of tea.  Tapping his fingers on the table in a staccato rhythm.  “I want to be a good father.”  Greg admits after a while.  Glancing up at Draco with watery eyes.
“As I said, you have good taste.”  She repeats, corners of her eyes crinkling as she smiles.  Expression warm.  “I recognized you from a recent photo in the Daily Prophet.  I’ve been following your friend Hermione Granger’s career for years.  She has an impressive body of work campaigning for creature folk rights.  I was raised mostly by house elves, you see.  They are free in France, but not in most places in the world.  I was pleased to see her introduce a bill for LGBTQ protections here in Britain.  It’s long past due.”
fault the magic was corrupted.  It should have been able to tell the difference.  Our family is not exactly known for its gentle nature.  Malfoys are strong but harsh.  That is our nature.  I was
It takes a bit for Draco to find a rhythm.  Harry moans into their kiss, dragging his hands up to Draco’s chest, jumper bunching up to Draco’s armpits.  Criss-cross scars interrupting otherwise smooth skin.  He follows their rivulets with his fingertips.  Relishing the texture.  Draco shudders, burying his face into the crook of Harry’s neck.   Hand stuttering, long fingers flexing and re-gripping him and picking up the pace.  Twisting up in a corkscrew motion around the head of his cock.  That's just -
“Fine.”  Harry says with finality.  Using his commanding tone.  He can be mature.  “Be angry, Ron.  It won’t change anything.”  He grits out, moving to stand.  Suddenly feeling embarrassed at his own childishness.  He looks over to Molly, whose expression is upset and bewildered.  He tries to find the words to apologize for ruining her lovely meal.
“Fine.”  He blunts looking sternly up at the two adults.  “But just you two.  No more surprise guests from the hallway.”
Dad huffs a light laugh at that, waving a hand to turn off the bedside lamp.  “I do.  I like him very much.”
“I don’t know.”  Jamie replies with a frown.  The elf was supposed to fix the pitch, but he was also the groundskeeper here.  He might want to get rid of the crup entirely, but that seemed such a shame.  She was obviously a nice crup.  “Maybe if we can get her to stop digging holes, they’ll let her stay with us?”  He suggests, feeling satisfied with his stroke of genius.
Draco nods.  Lily was unaware of the accident and could still enjoy her birthday.  Nothing traumatizing infringing on her special day.  It is good James is here with them.  The boy likely needed some one-on-one time with his mother.  Harry and Ginevra had quite the talking to with James after they got back to the cottage once Albus was safely seen to.
The boys are playfully hanging upside down from the interconnected metal dome.  Black hair standing on end.  Quite over their punishment from earlier in the day – for now.  Other muggle children are doing the same or clambering to the top.  Lily chooses a peeling bouncy horse to play on.  The pigtails Draco put in her hair this morning, flapping in the wind.  The great big smile on her face reminds him of Harry.  All cheek.
The foot is not what woke him though it is the tap-tap tapping of a beak on the window.  Harry has the house warded against most owls and this owl is strange to him.  He has become familiar with some of the owls that fly by – many of them Weasley owned.  Draco does his best to extract himself from Harry’s hold without waking him or Lily to open the window.  It is not a success.  Harry groans groggily as Draco rises out of their bed.
Father drew himself up, affecting confidence.  Another show of his pride.  Draco was ashamed of him.  Ashamed of his father’s denials.  Refusing to acknowledge entirely what he did.  Spinning stories.  How he damned himself.  The dark lord had steered him wrong according to Lucius, but the essential tenets of dark lord's cause remained close to his heart, not that he admitted
It is the first time he has said it aloud.  A part of him had been afraid of jinxing it if he did.  Like it would be ripped out from under him if he acknowledged a wish.  Especially one this selfish.
“This could be a lot worse, Harry.”  Draco comments, setting the magazine down on the side table.  The picture of the two of them sitting for the interview is on top.  They look good, but Harry prefers the more candid pictures he has of his boyfriend and him together.  Those are not for the public.  Those are for his home and office instead.  They were more real to him anyway.
It is Astoria Greengrass naturally.  One of the few people he wants to speak with tonight.  She sticks out in the crowd of already somewhat eccentric dressers despite her diminutive stature.  Dress spun and layered around her, leaving one of her shoulders bare.  Her hair done up with peacock patterned beads stuck through it in a crown-like fashion.  Her face is made up nicely as well though Harry doesn't have the words to describe it accurately.  It reminds him of the women he would see clubbing when he was younger.  She is certainly no longer the mousy girl he half remembers.
It is late.  They are back in their suite in Brussels and he is in Harry’s lap.  Straddling him where his boyfriend is propped against the pillows and headboard.
“Shhh!  Lily!”  Jamie upbraids bringing his pointer finger to his lips and jogging over the remaining few steps to his sister.  “The crup is a secret!  Be quiet!”  He demands.  There is a loud click of the door behind him shutting making him wince, but it’s just Al when he checks.  Maud races straight to Al the moment she lays eyes on him.  Front paws digging at Al’s legs as his brother picks her up.
“Punctual.”  Harry teases, tilting his head forward to nudge Draco’s forehead with his own.  Bringing his arm back up to squeeze his boyfriend to his side.
Bixby so long as he allows.  If he does not permit it, please leave him to his work.”  He instructs.
“It’s my birthday!”  She continues to whisper badly, peering intently down at Draco as he squints into the dim light of the bedroom.  “Are you awake?”
“Hello, Pansy.”  Harry greets cordially, joining them.  He had been flagged down earlier by a couple Draco does not know.  Something about a field trip?  Draco can see some of the other parents still gawking at them.  Eyes shifting guiltily away when they spot Draco looking back.  He hopes they will get used to his presence as time goes on.  Then he can be just another person in the crowd.
“Why are you so obsessed with him?!”  Ginny accuses hotly.  “You can’t stop thinking about him even now?!”
Still, it takes some courage for him to open the door enough to peek through into the sliver of the opening.  He spies the woman he hoped to find standing in the middle of the passageway.  Hands clutched behind her back and looking up at the ceiling.  Humming tunelessly as she slowly spins in place.
“Of course not.”  Ginny rebuffs with a wave.  Then sighing dramatically.  “When we were good, we were great, Harry.”  She tells him with a wink.
“Potter, why would you do that?!”  Malfoy yells indignantly walking backward to the other side of the room.  Still facing him the whole way.  Stance defensive with his shoulders hunched and hands fisted, but expression neutral.  “Why didn’t you knock?!”
He discovers Draco standing on one of the stone walls, guiding a hedge to grow upward and fill in the space where part of the wall crumbled.  Brow furrowed in concentration as he gently prompts the plant upward.
“Were you ever able to produce a patronus?”  Harry questions curiously, turning to his side to see Draco clearly.  Frowning when he discovers Draco’s face looking pained.
“Let’s go.”  Draco announces suddenly, picking up his cloth napkin from his lap and putting it on the table.  “Take me to the nearest food cart, Potter.”
Al sags in relief next to him.  But Jamie can see Teddy fidget off to the side.  Jamie knows they aren’t done here.
All easy and carefree in public in a manner Draco is unaccustomed to but relishes nonetheless.  Taking pictures on his phone of local attractions and buying little trinkets for the children.  Content to laze in bed and walk around the city.  Walking together arm in arm.  Enjoying the sights and sounds around them.  Harry is a firm presence at his side.  One that relaxes and intrigues.
Ron brings out the chess set and invites Draco to play as they settle in for conversation and drinks.  Harry and Hermione share a look of cautious optimism as the two men set the board and begin a game.  They enjoy comfortable conversation for some time.  Harry had hoped it could be like this.  He had no illusions that Ron and Draco would be best mates, but he appreciates that they are both trying.
Harry raises an inquisitive eyebrow at that, chuckling a bit.  “His intentions?”  He repeats incredulously.  Not quite sure he heard that right.
“We cannot afford to lose our focus.”  Kingsley states in his deep voice, expression somber as he leans forward in his chair.  “The escalation in muggle attacks - while deeply troubling - has obviously become a smokescreen tactic to put us off the scent of our ultimate perpetrator.  This is eerily what it was like before the second war.”
It comforts them to feel helpful he imagines.  He is sure to thank them each time.  Astoria stays with them for a couple days post his release from St. Mungo’s.  This is terrible for several reasons, but mostly because Draco has yet to finish any of the guest rooms.  They spend the entirety of her visit pouring over home décor catalogues and sketching out possible options.  Olta keeping them well-stocked in swatches throughout.
Potter sighs appearing flustered and maybe a bit embarrassed.  Draco has found he still takes great pleasure in causing Potter to squirm.  He knows the feeling is mutual.
They have never had uninterrupted time like this with one another.  There was always some responsibility or facet of life that diverted them.  Now, Draco luxuriates in Harry’s undivided attention.  Confident that Harry is as happy as he is and equally as focused on being together.  The heady emotion between them intoxicating.
Jamie frowns, confused.  "I wouldn’t break something you gave Dad just cause your friends.”  He responds.
Draco turns back to the scene before him, stepping forward to examine everything.  It is simple enough to determine that she has been successfully locked away.  The woman in the portrait must be Walburga Black.  The great-aunt he met as an infant.  He erred in his initial judgement that this portrait was not a dark object.
Harry takes - what he hopes - is an unnoticeable deep breath to steady himself.  Internally prodding himself to move forward as Hargreeves turns to both in greeting, eyebrows and mustache moving in what Harry assumes to be the man’s customary pleasant smile under all the fluff of his hair.
“I participate in gift giving,” Draco explains, rotating his wand to finish a bow on Al’s gift.  “Whether it is for Christmas or Hanukkah.  There is a lot of overlap between those holidays and Yule.  Most pureblood families celebrate Yule along with one of the other major winter holidays.  The Malfoys only celebrated Yule, but my mother’s family indulged in Christmas on occasion.  As a boy, we did most of our gift giving on the winter solstice and the twelve days after were typically spent as a family.”
“I appreciated your original letter more.”  Hermione responds gently.  She takes Ron’s hand and looks up at her husband.  “He wrote to me and apologized years ago.  I kept the letter.  I ought to share it with you.”
want to do that again before they leave, but not now.  Instead, Draco wants to propose something new.
“I really don’t know why, Draco.  It’s like Lils and Jamie switched personalities when it comes to you.  Lily is the one who takes forever to accept someone new – if she ever does – and Jamie’s usually more like Al.  Pretty quick to make friends.”  Harry says, climbing into bed.
The lights dim twice in quick succession, indicating the main event.  Harry watches the emcee gesture grandly to Hargreeves as he arrives at the podium.  He looks as though his house elf did not warn him against hors d’oeuvres.  Harry feels jealous.
“I resent the implication, sir.”  Draco says out of hand.  He is fully capable of taking care of himself thank you very much.  He just preferred some assistance at home.  He will not apologize for it.
He turns them away from the estate over the rolling green hills that are being dusted by snow.  Sun rays break through the clouds and the sky he can see is a brilliant blue.  The trees they pass have the hangings on of a few autumn leaves.  Clinging onto the previous season.  When they have been up about an hour, he takes them down to the country road miles outside the manor’s exterior ward lines.  Driving along the road toward the estate.
“Yeah.”  Jamie replies.  It had been a semester study in school a year ago.  Lots of people in his family were different colors.  His friends too.  Racism was stupid bully stuff.  People were all equal.  “I remember.”
“I am grateful to anyone who has my children’s best interests at heart.”  Ginevra replies with an easy shrug, sounding sincere.  “They are lucky to have you.”
“Did you fancy your godfather too?”  Draco teases, jumping down to join Harry on the ground, walking toward him.
Draco nods and Harry leans in to kiss him.  It is so easy like this.  He knows in his heart how well Draco fits.  But he can also understand Draco’s hesitation.  Harry is nervous too.  He so desperately wants his children and Draco to get along.
.”  Astoria answers immediately, sounding desperate.  “We could leave here.  Live overseas like the others.  Date who we want.  Work where we want.
“Oh!”  Ron voices loudly getting their attention, face transforming with an obvious idea as quickly as it falls.  “Oh.”  He repeats more quietly.
Harry grins slowly, leaning in to kiss him.  There is a bit of a bite to it.  Leaving Draco feeling flustered.  “You’ll be my live-in boyfriend.”
It's a good bust.  They are able to get Spinner’s mistress too.  Clearwater and Doge managed that with minimal injury and no muggles any the wiser.  Shepard does a little jig in celebration outside the interrogation room which amuses the rest of the squad.  Harry leaves them to it.  Hopefully, this will be a fruitful line of inquiry.
He side steps and takes his brother by the hand to help him up when the shrubbery before them gives three barks causing them to freeze in place in front of the bush.  Its branches and leaves shuddering ominously.  A twig snaps loudly and something launches at them.
“Why not just keep the album at home and summon it?”  Draco had wondered honestly confused, observing the children rough house and yell over each other.  Intrigued that a sound recording was also a feature of the device.  Muggles really could be so clever.  A fact that would frequently re-astonish him.  Potter chuckled, resting his hand on Draco’s shoulder.
Draco is at a loss again.  Is this how Harry feels around her?  Turned one way and then the other?  He finds he does have one question though.  “Do you mind me involving myself so much with them?  Is it overstepping?”
The minister nods gravely.  “Perhaps.”  He responds, stroking his chin.  “Of course, the majority of death eaters responsible for sowing doubt and chaos in those initial days of each war are dead now or incarcerated.  It
He stands.  Murmuring to Hermione he would be right back.  That he will try to figure out what this crup wants from him.
“Ah!”  Al yelps.  Jamie throws himself forward to try and block his brother from the extended claws before he can even properly think about it.  Unable to brace for impact, they both get pushed back by a surprisingly strong force causing them all to fall down in a pile of tangled legs and sharp elbows and paws.
There’s another silence.  Harry gets out of bed and goes to stand in front of the other man.  Every part of him feels heavy.  Stoney.  Draco’s eyes flick over him before looking away.
There are several safe houses for British auror use throughout the country and internationally.  It has been a long time since Harry set up one for his private use though.  He takes the opportunity to dust off the rust planning it out.  He outfits the safe house himself.  Situating it on the edge of a moderately populated coastal village called South Ashwith.  A locale populated solely by muggles for miles.
“Yes.”  He affirms.  It pleases him now to understand that part of himself.  Questioning and being confused was hard and he was so alone in it.  “I am.”
“Molly said he talked late.”  Harry quietly informs him one night in the comfortable silence while they are relaxing on their bed.  Quilt pooling around their legs and propped upright by the overstuffed pillows Draco preferred.  Fireplace lit in the room over, chasing away the cold in the master suite.  It was the beginning of December after all.
“Both.”  Draco retorts automatically, brow furrowing and ire rising.  “How could you not know what you did?  That allowing us to be harmed by the dark lord perverted the foundational magic?”
It's probably the wrong choice, but he cracks the door open to peer inside.  Feeling worried.  He finds Draco tucked in the empty space between the counter and the tub.  Knees bent under his chin.  Hand gripped in his hair, making it a mess.  The tap of the tub issuing a steady stream of water.
“Are we good?”  Ronald asks, approaching with his hands in his pockets.  Breaking from the rest of their group nearby.  Casting fruitive looks between the lot of them.
“That’s right.”  Hermione says, considering the woman.  “I heard she was working overseas.  I wonder if she is one of the clinic’s patients?  She was always such a sickly thing – some chronic issue.  She looks well enough now though.”
“Wait.”  Harry cuts in.  Feeling surprised by his boyfriend’s answer.  Draco never mentioned anyone specific before.  “Who?”
Draco lowers his hand, face pointed determinedly away, and turning his drink again by the stem of his wine glass.  “I never . . . ah, this is strange.   I’ve made this awkward.”  He says sounding embarrassed.
“Life.”  Astoria replies.  Holding his gaze.  “Is this all there is?”  She waves a hand around them.  They are supposed to be courting, but all they have done is talk.  Draco had so missed having a proper friend.  Pansy and Goyle had been barred from seeing him.  Pansy by her parents and Goyle by his probationary officer.  Everyone else had fled the country or was dead.
James rolls his eyes, twisting around where he stands in the library.  Raising his hand and spelling out each letter in midair, using the toy wand Draco bought him.  “D. E. M. O. N. S. T. R. A. T. E.”
“And that’s another thing, I wish you would do more with Lily.”  Mrs. Weasley states sounding frazzled.  Voice emanating from the open kitchen just around the corner from him.
“Malfoy still might have some insight.”  Robards contends, tone resolute.  “He had close connections to most of Riddle’s lieutenants.  He learned from them.  Merlin’s sake, his father was the one who operated the underground network during each war.”
“Eccentricities?”  Harry prompts trailing his hand down Draco’s side, feeling the thin scars’ endings from the Sectumsempra curse there.  Raised slivers of skin.
The man before him sags.  Eyes searching out the other’s in the dim light of their room.  He watches him take a shaky breath, releasing the hand in his hair to grasp the top of the bureau for support.
“Please, that is not the only reason you’re staying, and you know it.”  Astoria replies, smile wicked.  “I don't care how happy work is making you.  I've seen you content in your research before this, you know.  If it were down to job satisfaction and cloistering yourself away in a potions lab you would have stayed in France.”
Talbot, Clearwater, and Doge look inquisitively between him and Draco like they are exotic animals in a zoo.  The three of them obviously dressed in club gear for a roaring night out on the town by the looks of it.  Only Talbot seems appropriately abashed at approaching them.  Her expression toned down compared to the other two’s earnest looks.  They were young.  He had to remember that.  Talbot was the oldest at twenty-three and Doge the youngest at nineteen.
“I am not ‘freaking out’ as you put it.”  Draco responds, expression serious.  “It is a little late in the day for that considering we live together.”
“Thank you.  I had an excellent teacher.”  He acknowledges feeling proud as he catches Pansy rolling her eyes at him behind their old professor’s shoulder as she trots by.  He can practically hear her sarcastic tone mocking him for his delight in the praise.  The cow.
His friend sags a bit.  Pursing her mouth and looking down at her hands.  “Is she your friend now too?  Did she know all about you and Potter?”
The rest of Teddy’s visit goes well and before he knows it Dad is taking him back to Hogwarts.  Leaving the rest of them home.  Working on their weekly letter to Mum.  Hestia, their family owl, hops around the library awaiting the letter to start her delivery.  Al is on the rug finishing his note.  Jamie dictated what he wanted to tell Mum about her recent match to Al.  Lily is sending two drawings this time.  One of her on a dragon and the other of all of them with Teddy over the weekend.  She carefully labels them in her large handwriting.
That earns a flash of a smile for their inside joke.  “You are.”  Draco returns appearing more sure.  “You are.”
Ron’s eyes shift between them.  Face suddenly apprehensive and sighing deeply.  “Don’t make me say it.”
It is not like Harry needs to try.  Draco is usually a bit overwhelmed still to be the focus of his boyfriend’s attention.  Harry is all tawny skin and interested green eyes slowly checking Draco over.  Teeth a pearly white as Harry flashes them at him again.  Fully aware of how he affects him.
“That’s what I prefer to be known for, yes.”  Harry replies, grinning up at the woman.  “I’m Harry Potter.”  He introduces, extending his hand.
“He wasn’t even around then.”  James cuts in sharply with a wave of his fork to punctuate his point.  “He’s not our dad.”
He was not exactly planning to get Draco a present.  It never seemed to really be planned when he found him something.  The cufflinks and watch weren't either.  Those were all borne from his gnawing need to give his boyfriend additional protections.  Draco can take care of himself.  Harry knows that logically and practically.  But Draco doesn't have to do it on his own anymore.  Harry is here now, and his boyfriend takes care of him too.
“Where do babies come from?”  Hugo asks the backyard at large.  Well, that is the effect of his question at least as he looks quizzically between Lily and his sister.
“Go relax in your room, Kreacher.”  Potter tells him with a wave.  “We don’t need your help tonight.  We can serve ourselves.”
“Now that everyone is present, we will proceed with the oversight hearing.  Guards, if you will please?”
The worst-case scenario was Draco being attacked or cursed.  They had been lucky; nothing had shown itself yet.  Harry had strengthened the wards on Draco’s flat accordingly.  Made it so no cursed mail or packages could arrive at his door or work despite Draco’s complaints that he could manage dark objects.  He gifted Draco a watch and cufflinks with strong protection charms inscribed on them.  Both of which Draco happened to be wearing now.
He tries to let Malfoy have a lie in that first morning, he really does, but eventually he gets bored putting around the house and it
Well, he never has been one to look a gift dragon in the mouth.  He is grateful to take Draco’s hand and walk the block over to a food cart he knows for a fact sells skewered chicken satay and absolutely no dinosaur shaped anything.
Kreacher wants Draco’s attention too - which is weird.  Jamie’s never seen Kreacher fall all over himself to serve a visitor.  He’s seen Kreacher happy plenty of times.  Like on holidays when the house looks best or when important visitors come to meet Dad and he gets to bring out the nice tea set.  But Draco is like the Minister of Magic and Christmas all rolled into one.  Kreacher
They had stopped at the café before going back to Draco’s flat.  Waiting outside for Harry.  His boyfriend had actually been in the restroom of the shop at the time.  Draco wonders what picture the photographer would have snapped once Harry returned to their group.
make him immortal.  He could be gravely injured in this form and die.  Although taking on this form could heal him somewhat.
“I did.  I appreciated the response.”  Draco replies shortly.  Harry has the sense his boyfriend is holding himself very still.  Waiting in suspense.
Harry sighs.  All he wants is to go home and talk with Draco.  “We kinda guessed.  Thank you for saying something.”
“Well, the Notts and the Zabinis are here.”  Pany begins, choosing to airily ignore Draco.  “Padma and her husband too.  Her married name’s hyphenated to Khan now.  You remember Leo Khan.  I saw Astoria briefly before she had to host someone.  She mentioned Millicent and her girlfriend came.  I even saw Seamus Finnegan.”
“Draco’s right, Lily bean.”  Harry blessedly cuts in.  Ginevra snorts loudly in front of them while attempting to hide that with a cough.  “Your mum and I are your biological parents, er – that is, the ones who made you.”  He explains.
The last time Father wrote to him was in November 1999.  All their correspondence was heavily monitored.  They had been instructed to only include personal information which was still subject to censorship before Lucius received it.  Mother had sent word that Draco refused the arranged marriage – that he broke off the engagement – that he would be refusing any marriage.  She did not inform Father as to the why.  He assumed she did this to maintain the family’s privacy as much as Father’s pride.
Draco notices most of the Weasleys glancing down toward the elongated end of the table where the children are.  Amused expressions forming before turning back to their conversations which briefly lulled.  Harry chuckles from his spot beside him.
I own no part of this series.  I just got plots.  I am unable to crank them out as quickly now since I'm working overtime, but I will complete this series.  Stay safe out there, folks!
Harry hums thoughtfully at that.  He often forgot Sirius was a close relative of Narcissa’s.  The two were polar opposites in so many ways.  But understandably, she would have some stories of Sirius he hasn't heard.
“Sorry.”  His boyfriend apologizes.  Looking and sounding utterly unapologetic.  “I’m just looking forward to adult time away from kids.  No accidentally stepping on toys.  No interruptions.  No having to be somewhere.”
Draco relaxes back into the bed.  Slightly mollified.  “You won’t get bored?”  He questions, critically watching Potter’s face.  “If we go slow?”
Their pace is slower which makes it easier on him.  Draco’s hand is warm in his own.  His boyfriend was not often willing to go along with public displays of affection so he tries to savor where he can.  Tonight they were just another couple walking along the sidewalk.  Pleased to be out together.
He doubts very much he will need to know how to transfigure a piece of metal into a skeleton key.  The Alohomora charm worked just fine.
“Mother.”  Draco groaned mildly reproaching her.  She was impossible when she made up her mind.  The guilt did not help either.  He knew how much he hurt her by refusing the marriage – refusing to continue their line.  Being gay was tolerable to a degree, but refusing tradition -
When they land in a small clearing in the woods outside South Ashwith, Malfoy staggers blindly to the side.  Barely kept from falling by the firm grip Harry has on the man’s wrist.  There is a cold wind permeating through the fir trees.  The force of it chilling even him in his thick cloak.  Harry will give Malfoy this, he doesn’t shout or try to run away or fight like Harry suspected the man might.  Rather, he just stares wide-eyed, body freezing in place the moment he catches sight of Harry.  Every part of Malfoy visibly on alert then.  It has been fifteen years since they last saw each other.  Malfoy was always a bit taller – that’s not changed.  The man is thin, hair long and unkempt, and vaguely odorous.  Skin nearly translucent with how pale he is.  Harry is well aware that the prisoners don’t get a lot of sun, but it looks like Malfoy’s been living in a cave.  There is a weariness in his expression.  Desperation.  In fact, Harry is fleetingly reminded of Xenophilius Lovegood’s appearance during the war with how tense and disheveled the man before him is now.
“It really is idiotic, darling.  I’ve forgotten how moronic the British press can be.”  Astoria drawls.
Lily runs over and holds Draco’s hand instead though.  “Why is your hair so pretty?”  She inquires, face tilted up toward the man.  Jamie doesn't hear Draco’s response.  He startles when Dad ruffles his hair.  He hadn’t heard the door close behind him.
They share a look for a moment, openly studying the other.  Grey eyes impassively meeting green.  Malfoy’s brow slightly furrowing.  Harry, again, has the sense he is being assessed and realizes he doesn't know Malfoy all that well anymore.  It is discomfiting, if Harry’s honest.  An irascible, bigoted, arrogant Malfoy he understands.  But that version of him may not exist to the same degree any longer.  Harry’s last few experiences with Malfoy, years ago now, were heavily laced with the man’s despair and fear.  Harry’s instinct is the person who sits before him now is a significantly transformed man – and he has come to trust his instincts.
“It’s about the war, right?”  Rosie prompts.  He and Al both shrug.  Rosie sighs put upon.  “Whenever people say mean things to Mummy and Daddy it's
Jamie wasn't best pleased that his parents divorced, after all none of his aunts and uncles did that.  Not even Nan and Granddad got divorced, and Nan was always after Granddad about something.  But at least a lot of the kids at his school had divorced or single parents too.  Ian even had two moms and Abdul’s grandparents took care of him.
His boyfriend attracts attention from women and some men as they pass up the line, going directly for the entrance of the club.  He has noticed this before when they have been out to pubs or walking around but the people waiting in line are here for fun and have no problem with openly gaping.  Not that he can blame them.  Draco was beautiful.  He puts a hand on Draco’s lower back as they enter the club.  Bouncers moving out of their way.  They don't even have to show the invitation.
“She’s a good mum.  My mother.”  Ginevra says mouth crooking slightly.  “But she doesn't understand me very well.  I think she believes the only way to be a good mother is to be there every day, taking care of your children – like she did.”
“I need to locate the core."  He responds, trying to refocus on his goal.  "I can attempt to restore the original spell or cleanse it or something then.  That is the only way I can escape this place.”
“They always write ‘and boyfriend’ before introducing me in these things.”  Draco considers, sitting in the open space next to Harry and leaning his head on Harry's shoulder.  “Why is that, do you think?”
His mother still owned the cottage and her letters were typically addressed or forwarded there, but Jamie knew she didn't often stay in it because of her job.  He knew this because the only times his mum was there, he and his little brother and sister were usually with her.
There is a sound of approaching footsteps causing the three of them freeze.  Maybe they weren’t the only ones to overhear the commotion?  Lily clamps both hands over her mouth, eyes growing wide.  Al’s got his hand on the crup’s snout to muffle any errant noise.  Jamie presses his ear to the door to listen.  He can hear a woman humming a song.  Her voice tugs at his memory.  He waits for an impossibly long moment, trying to discern if anyone else is out there.
“Well, you’re wrong, ‘Mione.”  Ron upbraids, causing Hermione to wince.  “Nothing pleasant here – not with
Before him, sitting lightly on rumpled bed linens with his wings folded, is a stunning swan-sized bird with grey and white feathers.  His claws and beak are a shimmering silver, bleeding into the darker grey feathers.  Eyes a deep black like Fawkes’ had been.  Watching him with a similar intensity.
On one occasion when he was maybe five, he was feverish and weak for several days.  Coughing and wheezing growing worse by the hour.  Mother stayed by his bedside the entire time.  Sending even his governess away and tending to his immediate needs.  It was a respiratory illness if he remembers correctly.  His parents had called several healers to no avail.  He has vague memories of them poking and prodding him with their wands and being asked to drink even more medicine.  All the while, his breathing got more labored and exhausted.
“This is the last, dear.”  His wife answers.  “I want to say hello to Millie and then go dance, and I can’t unless I’m a bit buzzy.  You know that.”
“I never thought I’d get a chance to do this.”  Draco says, expression suddenly shy, bringing the hand holding Harry’s to his chest.  “I’m glad it’s with you.”
Jamie despairs when he hears Hugo and Lily going down the stairs to the main floor.  He can hear their footsteps as they run past the entrance to the sitting room.  This was maybe not the hiding spot he had hoped it would be.  He buries himself back into his hidey hole.  Hoping no one will notice him.
“I can tell.”  Draco replies mildly.  He feels where Draco’s hand ghosts over his erection and groans.  This is not fair.  Harry opens his eyes and watches Draco set the bottle of oil to the side and summon a hand towel.
“Not sure.  Spinner and his lot seem too interested in holding on to dark ritual artefacts for that.”  Shepard theorizes.
Olta is there to take Narcissa’s coat and belongings.  They elected to have her primarily be the one to wait on Narcissa.  Kreacher was near hysterics at the mention of Draco’s mother staying with them for a few days.  Harry was concerned the old elf might have a stroke.  It reminded him of the early days of Draco visiting Grimmauld - not that the elf had stopped doting on the man - but his enthusiasm had cooled to genuine pleasure from rapturous bliss.  Regardless, the old elf had outdone himself cleaning and decorating the house.
The man drapes an arm behind Draco's neck as the other hand clutches at his hip.  Draco can feel where Potter’s fingers have splayed out.  His own hands have found themselves in Potter’s hair.  It is not like Potter will care if it gets mussed.  Besides, Draco has always been curious about the man’s hair.  The very thing that used to be a joke to him is now driving him mad every time he sees it.  The strands thick and lush under his fingers.
Draco hums his acknowledgement flourishing his wand to send the instruments back to their places on the shelf.  “Well, that's sorted now.  I will keep you apprised on the trial's progress.  I imagine you will want to continue use of the salve once it's approved for the larger market.”
It is a desolate place.  Draco put off coming here for just that reason.  Being here made him feel seventeen again.  Desperate and scared.  Malfoy Manor is a time capsule stuck at the end of May 1998.  The moment he crosses the property line he is hit with the smell of ash and decay as if there had been a large fire and somewhere there was something left rotting in water.  The metal gates are blown in and rendered useless.  Torn apart at the seams.  Gouges in the earth where ancient trees stood for centuries.  The entire east wing had collapsed during the siege.  The great hall burnt to hell.  Grand staircase torn apart and sticking oddly out of the second floor.  Ballroom, tearoom, pleasure garden, his mother’s bedroom, father’s office, the common family spaces all gone – as if some great, giant beast had ripped into the manor with its claws.
The bell rings and within minutes a stream of small uniformed children exit a dozen or more classrooms.  Spilling out from hallways and the stairs.  Draco finds James in the fray first, dark hair standing on end.  Albus comes along too after a bit.  Backpack in his hands and glasses crooked.  Frowning about something.
“He has his charms.”  Draco replies absently, brow furrowed in thought.  Harry will tear the manor down if he thinks it will help or save him.  But like him, Harry will need an opening to get past the wards the manor has on itself.  His limbs are numb now, he focuses on taking a deep breath through his nose.  Willing himself to calm.  He must think.
The man steps into Draco’s space.  Feet touching.  Potter reaches out, tracing fingertips over Draco’s scars from the Sectumsempra curse bisecting his torso.  Eyes thoughtfully contemplating him.
“I did this.”  Potter states quietly, expression suddenly sad, and staring at where his fingers touch.  Skimming across the scars there.  Draco closes his eyes, taking a deep breath and intertwining their fingers.  Stopping their movement.  He does not want Potter sad because of him.  This is the first time someone has seen his chest bare since he got injured.  He has always hidden it.  There was not a conscious thought to reveal it to Potter tonight, but it seems right.
Olta stays with them here too which is nice.  If he’s ever unsure where to go to meet up with everyone else, he can call her, and she’ll help him straight away.  Appearing next to him with the familiar snap of her apparating.  All the other house elves live at the manor and take care of it.  He’s not around them much.  Bixby and Dort mostly, but he isn’t supposed to ask them for anything like he would Kreacher or Olta.  Dad was very clear on that.
Another boom causes the whole place to quiver.  He hears the screaming sound again.  The horrid one he heard before when he would attempt to gain entry.  It is exponentially louder this time and coming from beneath him.  Each strike to the building causing it harm.  It is the core he realizes dully.  Scrapping his talons along the floor until he can fall into the open maw leading down to it.  Dropping several feet into the packed earth.
“Oi, mate.  Well done.”  Draco imitates in turn, trying to recall what Potter said about the last quidditch game they discussed.  “Got right in there, you did.”
“I have – I suppose you could call him my boyfriend.”  Draco answers, eyes sliding over again to look at Dad.  Dad grins back.  Looking keen.  Jamie thinks they have a joke but he’s not sure what it is.  Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron had ‘looks’ like that too sometimes.
It seems the moment is broken then as his boyfriend opens his eyes and Harry wipes a hand roughly at his own watering ones.  There is movement and the distinct absence of heat as the phoenix perches at the end of the bed.  Harry blinks back tears, clearing his throat.
It is a mad dash through the manor then.  Quickly scouring the family quarters and expanding past them to the rest of the second floor before descending in horrible defeat to the main one.  Keeping an ear out all the while for adults, house elves, and portraits who might be shouting in astonished dismay at the sight of a crup running loose in the manor.  Thankfully, most of the portraits they pass are asleep, but a few utter greetings and question their hurried behavior.
Draco jolts a bit at whatever she has said.  “No, nothing like that.  You needn’t ever worry about that happening – not with him.”  He dissuades matter-of-factly.
Malfoy shifts slightly in his seat.  “Well, it must have been hard to be married to you when you spend your holidays hiding recently released convicts.”  He remarks lightly.
.  Rosier was ruthless – more so than the rest of them.  A year older than him, Ethan Rosier was a graduate of Durmstrang and his aunt’s star pupil.
much better.”  Harry agrees, grinning.  Relieved that Draco appears to be having a good time despite their change in plans.  It is chilly out still; but their coats, food, and drink keep them warm.  Draco is stupidly attractive in his dark green winter coat and the silver scarf wrapped around his neck.  Pale hair ruffled by the wind.  Skin slightly pink from the cold.  Leftover peanut sauce left on the corner of his mouth that his tongue quickly licks away.
It is a learning experience for both of them.  Draco can readily admit that he was not half so patient as he once believed he was.  Potion ingredients did not argue back.  But James acquiesces more and more over time.  Getting straight to his work.  They practice separating words into smaller bits for him to read aloud together and physically spelling them in the sand.  Every day they do this for a minimum of an hour after school.
“It’s a hide-a-way room.”  Draco replies, face completely flushed now, eyes shifting away.  “VIP members have access.”
James is clearly uncomfortable in the office.  Eyes shifting between Draco and the healer.  Expression unhappy.  There had been several assessments.  Draco sitting in the corner as James interacted with the diagnostician.  Completing different tasks set before him involving a variety of subjects.
“I get that.”  Harry responds.  Remembering his own sons’ interest in flying.  The first time he helped Jamie fly a toy broom was one of the happiest moments of his life.  Jamie lit up like Christmas the first time, he was so pleased.
“More people should.”  Astoria remarks, watching him and relaxing her hold.  “It is an admirable trait: adaptation.  Changing for the better.  I am going to sound terribly sexist, but I have not known many men who can – change that is.  At least not to the degree he has.”
The next morning, he wakes to the sound of claws scratching on the wooden floor.  When he rubs the sleep out of his eyes, he discovers the crup is once again standing atop his brother licking at Al’s face.
“I should really get you something too.”  Draco voices.  His gifts to Harry tended to be pragmatic, but perhaps it is time he gets him something more sentimental.  “You’ve given me all this – what did James call that necklace of Pansy’s the other week?”
“My name is Hyperion.” The half-valkyrie man answers him coolly, expression guarded.  Golden eyes sharp on him.  “Remember it.”
Teddy wakes them up bright and early for waffles the next morning.  Dad’s sleeping in which happens on the weekend and Draco typically spends the first few hours in the library most days, so the four of them get to eat breakfast without pesky adults around.  They're talking about the English quidditch league when it occurs to Jamie now might be a good time to ask Teddy a question.  Teddy knew lots of things he didn’t.
Lately, they have taken to walking around for Malfoy to observe any changes in his stride.  It doesn't hurt that Harry likes Malfoy watching him, can pretend a handsome bloke is checking him out.  He will not deny that, and he
Draco knew when to stop pressing.  “Alright, then.  Let’s go see what your father and siblings are doing, shall we?”
The thing is Malfoy never asked for a wand.  Didn’t even hint around at it.  Harry waited on tenterhooks for that question all week and it never came.  It was one of the issues he wrestled with most about hiding Malfoy from the wizarding world: whether or not to give him a wand.  Potentially arming him.  A part of him thinks that it is because Malfoy
“It sounds like you are in good hands, darling.”  Mrs. Malfoy remarks tilting her head toward him and Al with a shrewd expression.  “Be careful not to engage anything too bitey, boys.”  She warns them with a smirk.
“Want you.”  He tells Draco dazedly, voice low.  His boyfriend’s hands are at his hip, heel of his palm pressing in and making Harry grunt.
The hell of it is Malfoy looks content.  Faint lines on his forehead easing and a spark of interest on his face.  Harry imagines everything here is a significant upgrade to Azkaban.  It might help that they spend a lot of that first week putting the finishing touches on the whole place.  That Malfoy gets to choose what goes where and what he wants.  Using the pen and paper Harry gives him to make notes on how to take care of and use muggle technology he still struggles with each time.  Harry doubts he will soon forget the hilarious afternoon Malfoy learned about batteries, electricity, and fuel powering varied devices.
The Historical Society’s approval meant a great deal, but the success of this dinner is the pièce de resistance.  As reconstruction of the manor progressed, he hoped – petty as it was – to hold an event like this because Father would absolutely loathe it.
When he is there, Harry keeps the other two occupied when they try to pop their heads in if they go over time.  Otherwise Olta generously keeps a watchful eye on them.  Lily is very concerned she is missing out on something fun whenever she sees the sand tray left out on his desk.
They rarely talk about Harry’s work which is a relief to him – most of his work is classified anyways – not that Malfoy pushes whatsoever.  Their conversation flows over so many other topics.  Debates about quidditch leagues, food and drink, Harry’s children, Malfoy’s work and their shared interest in dark objects that they've both encountered in their careers, Malfoy’s preparations to restore the manor, and the muggle things that befuddle Malfoy to Harry’s frank delight.  The day they came upon a group of muggles at the park LARPing as fantasy characters is one Harry will not soon forget.
They meet again for a kiss.  Every bit of him thrums with how much he has missed this.  He is even more pleased when Draco opens easily and lets their tongues roll against each other.  An electric rush filling him with heat as he feels his heart beat that much faster.  The hot puffs from their breathing intermingling as Harry hastily opens both their trousers so he can get a hand on them.  Magically lubing up his own palm as he goes.  He tries to push Draco backward as he ruts up against him, but it doesn’t quite work out as they both fall with a thump to the oriental rug beneath them.  Knocking the air out of him at least as he takes the brunt of the landing.
“What should we do?”  Harry immediately asks Hermione.  He has never seen an oversight hearing recommend Veritaserum before.  The whole thing strikes him wrong, but he is uncertain if court would be much better.  There would be news coverage.  Evidence, whatever it was, aired publicly.  And Harry
They enjoy their meal in silence for a while.  People watching.  It is classic date stuff for them Harry thinks, glancing at Draco from the corner of his eye.  His boyfriend raptly watches as a street performer garners a crowd – juggling brightly lit batons.  There is live music on the park square nearby.  It's a nice change for them.  Harry fears he has been a little lax in the dating department lately.
“It doesn’t matter now anyway.”  Draco responds with a half shrug.  “I’m thirty-four and living well outside of wizarding society in a muggle village of all things.”
She does not get to finish her condemnations of him.  Draco slams the seal – for he knows that is what it was now – back over her with a jerk of his wand.  Silencing her and containing her rage.  The echo of her screams ring in the attic.  Dust motes dance in the streams of sunlight that intersect the room.  Draco turns his head, checking on his charges.
The sight of Draco Malfoy being freed and looking adrift in the world stays with him for some time afterward.  A grey ghost of a young man at the periphery of his mind.  No longer the arrogant boy Harry met years ago.
Draco stares at him.  Disbelieving.  “You had all those things when he first came – when you welcomed him into the manor – for months.  You knew what Bellatrix did to me – to the others.”  He says, years of resentment rushing to the forefront.  “Why didn’t you protect me?”
“Jamie, you’re old enough now to start learning that people need to think for themselves – that includes you too.  They have to determine what’s important to them and figure out right and wrong from there.”  Dad states in his stern voice.
“Draco is my favorite.”  Lily informs her grandparents seriously.  “He does my hair better than Daddy.”
“Why?"  Al persists, brow furrowed.  Harry loved that his son was curious and stubborn in finding out new things.  But sometimes, Harry wished Al could let things go.  It made him feel like a hypocrite when he thought that at times.
It is his quiz.  The weekly spelling quiz to be exact.  Draco’s heart clenches in his chest as he scans over it - at the red marks on the top of the page.
Harry loves the intimacy and casualness of it.  Learning more about this man in his unguarded moments.  He has a few pairs of work clothes at the flat now since he's been sleeping over.  Draco’s house elf, Olta, has been kind enough to launder them.  Storing them in the closet space and drawer Draco cleared for him.  A similar one was created recently at Grimmauld for Draco.
– when you very nearly killed me once!  I wonder if you’ve ever apologized to my brother Bill for scaring him for life?  Or my other relatives?  You do know your people killed one of my brothers – do my parents get an apology?!  Apparently, you’ve apologized to my wife, but one never came my way.  I’m not good enough for that am I?  Are blood traitors worse than muggleborns?  I can’t remember now how your twisted mind works.  So you will excuse me if I don’t roll out the welcome mat.”
“We did not.”  Al argues immediately, crossing his arms.  Pouting from the wall he is leaning against in the sitting room.
“You’re here.”  Draco greets, distractedly.  Busy writing something down as he waves Harry in to take his usual seat.
“And you didn’t think I would want to know that?”  Ron replies, staring over his wife’s head at Draco, giving him a dirty look.
Draco ignores him.  It is their lovely little nightly routine.  Everyone hollering at each other until someone cracks and starts howling in hysterics.  Apparently, it is the height of entertainment.
The monthly inter-departmental security meeting almost always takes place in the Minister of Magic’s office.  When he was starting out as an auror he was frequently invited to give reports, but now he was one of the members of the round table.  One voice among the top ministers and chief members of the Wizengamot.  Over the years, the meetings have been everything from quick briefings to all-out war room strategy.  Today was somewhere in between with Kingsley asking him, Robards, and Hermione to stay afterward – for a private word.
Draco considers this.  It had been fantastic bending Harry over the back of the couch and having his way with him and he
The man lowers his head, seemingly dejected.  Harry knows he royally fucked this up.  It is pathetic how drastically unsure he is in his personal life compared to his professional.  If this was a mission, he could be a regular 007 – not that Draco would get that reference.  Harry sighs mentally rehearsing a better apology when Draco begins to laugh a bit hysterically.
Both Potters stare at him.  James enraged and Harry obviously concerned.  Green eyes flicking over him and lips drawing into a tight line.
At that time, he only had lovely memories associated with the bike.  Going out for country runs to taste the air.  Packing Teddy into the side car with care to go on an adventure.  His godson's cheery little face smiling toothily up at Harry from the little wolf shaped helmet he got him.  Or the times he and Gin would travel to meet with friends.  Enjoying their time together.
“They help so much already with pickups, and dinner, and looking after them when I’m late at work.”  Harry admits with a bashful smile.  “I’ve primary custody and Gin’s so busy with her own work.  She only gets to see them so much, you know.”
It is Friday evening when Harry finally leaves the ministry.  His meeting with Robards ran long so he walks quickly to the department floor’s floo before one of the younger aurors stops him with a question that can absolutely wait until Monday morning.  He steps through Draco’s floo a second later, wiping off the soot from his shoulders.
“Play is a critical part of social-emotional development.”  Hermione expounds, eyes bright.  “Really, muggle psychology is much more advanced than our own.  They have done a lot more research on what helps children succeed.  For example, I always struggled with the tradition of having wizarding children separated from their parents for so long once they reach their secondary education.  That seems harmful to me.  If I wasn’t so eager to learn and be immersed in magic, my homesickness at Hogwarts would have been much worse.”
His own pictures as a child were more dignified and respectful in their frames.  A favorite of his mother’s was one of the two of them sat, holding hands when he was little more than a toddler.
“She’s more attached to her father’s boyfriend than her own mother.  A man she met scarcely more than a year ago.”
“Can’t. I. Shrink. It?”  Harry repeats, disbelieving.  “You want me to shrink a classic motorbike that is already broken -
It occurs to him he has never seen Malfoy in clothing that wasn’t black or a Slytherin emerald green.  It's striking.  More than it should be probably.  Malfoy's hair was no longer severely sleeked back either.  Instead now loose and slightly wavy, combed back out of his way.  The length an inch or so longer than how Harry remembered it when they were in school.  The man seemed more approachable this way.  Less severe.  Harry is left thinking how good Malfoy looks, and forces himself to survey the room instead.
“We’re friends, right?”  Harry checks as they leave the clinic and begin walking side by side to the pub.  It is a bit chilly out though it is nearly summer now.  It had rained earlier in the day.
“I gave them to Kingsley the evening before the Malfoys’ trial.  We watched them in the pensieve together.  I wanted to be certain he saw.”
Al nods sagely like this is expected.  “Our Uncle Charlie has a boyfriend.  His name’s Laszlo.  He can breathe fire.  Can you breathe fire?”
“I wasn’t in that class after fifth year.”  Draco reminds, then looks at the rest of them.  “I was never very good at defense.”
Not unpleasant by any means.  Draco certainly is a fan of this act when he tops, but he always wondered what Harry liked so much about it.  Bottoming always seemed much more vulnerable to him.  He was afraid of it and any possible pain.  His hesitance greatly diminishes with his boyfriend’s careful movements and the reassuring hand stroking his side.
“He’s okay.”  Jamie adds.  Draco was a boring bloke when it came down to it.  He didn’t really play around like Dad, but he was good to them Jamie supposes.  “He makes Dad happy.”  He says finally, thinking of Dad’s goofy expression whenever he looked at Draco.
He feels a bit like a plaything during those first few visits.  Torn between Albus and Lily as they show him every nook and cranny of the house and engage him with their toys.  Draco acknowledges these actions.  Asks them questions about the objects that they indicate are important to them.  It is only polite after all.  The younger two are excited whenever he arrives.  Catching him up on their day as they tell him in their loud, little voices at the same time.  He has them take turns telling him after the few visits so he can parse out what they are saying.
After a while, he is less fascinating for them.  No longer the shiny new toy.  They run in and out of wherever he and Harry are.  Making their cacophony of noise with Potter passing down whatever judgements they need.
“Dad, Draco, look!”  James yells, he is still hanging upside down and holding onto Albus' ankles.  Dangling his brother by his feet.  Al is laughing, swinging himself back and forth, jumper exposing his belly, and yelling for their attention too.
“No.”  He states emphatically, shaking Draco once slightly in his hands.  Perfectly aware his boyfriend is trying to find an argument.  “Please believe you are good – that you’re capable of it.”
Strangely, the man accepts Harry’s plan with little fuss or suspicion.  Or perhaps, it is not all that strange.  The few death eaters who have been released from Azkaban all wound up dead within a month under mysterious circumstances.  It was well publicized.
“Severus,” Draco responds, touched.  He would probably feel more emotional if it were not for the mounting imminent risk to his life.  “I’ve never known you to be so sentimental.”
The next several minutes feel like a fog to Harry.  His entire body is cold.  Hermione’s hand atop his own is the only warm thing anchoring him.  The murmurs of the crowd are rising around them.  Buzzing.
“This is all very interesting, Potter.”  Malfoy replies, face displaying the opposite.  “But our research requires frequent check ins especially early on.  Unfortunately –
“You two are a cute couple.”  Pansy interrupts him, starting to yawn as she moves to stand.  Anthony gets to his feet as well.  Patting down his sides, checking that his wallet and wand are still on him.  “Even if it is
“Don’t worry, Draco.” Al chimes in reassuringly crumbs from his toast stuck to his face and licking the butter carefully off his fingertips.  “We’ll help.”
Harry gets to his feet to follow Hargreeves out of the examination room.  The corridor outside runs along a few central stations where healers and other medical staff go about their business.  He is led through an archway down a short stairway leading to the lab.  Potion stations and equipment set up throughout with staff at work.  He had been back in the lab a few times before to be shown different equipment and ingredients used in his treatment.  He had always been impressed by the modern aesthetic and clean smell of the space.  The potions classroom of his youth at Hogwarts brought to mind stale air and a deep sense of irritation.  This lab was a stark contrast.  It was a place Harry would not mind working.
Draco recounts the morning’s events and what he learned about the portrait.  Sharing how the boys used a contraband object from their uncle’s store to pop open the door which resulted in the thunk Draco heard as it broke the locking charm.  How they uncovered Walburga’s portrait and what happened afterward.
“Why do people keep asking me that?”  Harry wonders aloud.  He got the same reaction at work and now Draco is leery of the whole enterprise.  His children at least were supportive.  Excited at the idea they might get to go flying with him.
He had done it because he wanted to prove he could.  He wanted a trick up his sleeve for the next time aurors inevitably came knocking down his door trying to take him to Azkaban.  He wanted to be free.  Peter Pettigrew managed a slice of freedom as a rat for over a decade.  Draco had wanted that insurance.  He was not so proud by then.  Any animal would do.  Ideally anything easily forgotten or left in the background.  Quick to get away unnoticed.  He hoped to be a moth or a housefly or even a ferret.
Jamie sighs.  He liked Luna and he knew his parents were good friends with her, but sometimes she was just plain odd.  “Would you come in here please?”  He requests tersely.
Harry slowly gets up and exits the coffee shop.  He watches a uniformed delivery person (Talbot) take his flank as they meander toward them.  People rarely noticed the elderly or those in uniform amongst a crowd.  Spinner is talking to a possible associate as they turn the corner behind the shop.  Harry stops by a post box and Talbot pretends to deliver several packages on a dolly into the shop.
“Why because you’d want a witch, and you can’t have one?”  He challenges hoping he is not about to hear some pureblood drivel.  He’d been wondering if and when that would happen.  Thought it would slip out much earlier than now given their history.
Draco watches as Harry levitates it mid-air and cocking his arm back, sends the portrait flying in an arc into one of the ragged holes in the imposing front door.  Walburga’s portrait clatters to the floor out of sight.  Her screams echoing in the hollowed-out building as the place begins to tremble worse than he has ever seen.  The crack in the wall worsens, but then a gale of dust is emitted, making Draco shield his eyes.  Everything settles suddenly then, quicker than anything natural.  He cannot even hear her ranting anymore.
It is only a hop, skip, and a jump by means of apparation to get to Paris from Brussels.  Draco is truly giddy.  He has so many places here that he wants to share with his boyfriend that another vacation will be necessary to tour them all.
Dad and Draco look at each other for a long moment.  Dad starts to chuckle and runs a hand distractedly through his messy hair, expression baffled even Draco seems affected.
Afterward, they stood on the raised dais together.  Father and him.  Aurors surrounding them and unlocking his shackles just as they reattached the secondary chains to his father’s.  Mother crying softly off to the side.  Seventy-five years they gave Father.  A life sentence.  Draco stared at him.  Feeling no twinge of guilt.  His own testimony had hurt his father.  He knew that.  It was not meant to be cruel – only truthful.
, needs to keep his hands to himself.”  Harry complains with a frown, crossing his arms, reminding Draco sharply of the boys.
He manages through the sitting room as surreptitiously as able.  Careful with each step and more than eager to get far away from the argument.  He is nearly to the backdoor to join the rest of the party when he spots him.
They drop the children off with Ginny for a long weekend.  It's the first drop off Draco's been a part of and the first interaction his boyfriend has had with his ex-wife since they got together.  It goes well enough so far as Harry can tell.  The two of them shake hands and are otherwise civil.  Al and Lily are keen to show Draco around the cottage.  Ginny is game, but Draco has a guilty expression on like he is worried about intruding on her space.
Pleasure explodes out of him, ricocheting up his spine Harry arches forward as he comes against Draco’s stomach.  Moaning as his body shakes from the shock of his release.  Draco thrusting himself into the grip he left around them.  He feels oversensitive as his boyfriend jerks hard in his hand and comes too.  The man emits a grunt and there is a dull thud as the back of Draco’s head hits the mirror.
“Well, Draco and I are like Uncle Charlie and Laszlo.  We're a couple.”  Dad explains.  Making careful eye contact with each of them in turn.  “I like to have him around because we're dating.  We have romantic feelings for each other.”
“Professor McGonagall and I were in a conversation, boys.”  He calmly reprimands.  “Please apologize for interrupting.”
Everything is aglow from the cobbled streets of this part of London to the shops around them open late into the evening.  Burlesque it's called.  The club.
Harry sighs, aware he’s kicked up a pixie nest.  “Don’t be like that, Draco.”  He complains tiredly.
When the two women release each other, Narcissa takes a handkerchief from her sleeve.  Wiping delicately at the corner of her eye.
“You,” Lucius begins, expression suddenly twisting into revulsion, posture rigid.  “You are . . . in an unnatural relationship with Potter?”  He grits out like it hurts him.
They end up in the kitchen.  Harry pours them each a drink as Ginny sits cross-legged on the bench by the kitchen table.
Strange really.  She had not demonstrated any neediness toward him prior though they had only had her a couple weeks.
After dinner, Jamie agrees to play hide and seek with them.  Hugo and Lily are it right now.  They have to be a team because they're so bad at finding the rest of them when it's just one of them alone.  Jamie sneaks into the sitting room and hides in the alcove behind the tall, broken grandfather clock Dad stored books in.  He’s never hid there before.  They won't find him here.
Lily gets her own room cause she’s a girl, but at least it’s the smallest of all the bedrooms.  Jamie can sorta see why Dad wanted to keep them nearby, Al and Lily
It is a firework when he does come.  Spilling over on to Draco.  Cum splattering over the man’s torso.  His body still moving in response to Draco.  It is exhilarating.  The lamp beside him is flickering.  He realizes off-hand.  He did that sometimes.  Accidental magic.  Draco spasms and follows, adding to the mess.
Today is an important court date for him in a way.  Lucius and Draco Malfoy are being tried for their crimes.  The last time he saw the Malfoys they were huddled in the Great Hall obviously shocked to find themselves all alive.  He hadn't seen them since that day months ago.  Last he heard, they were both in Azkaban awaiting their final hearing as the remaining aurors and DMLE people processed all the evidence and statements.
The expression on Draco’s face is much less indulgent now.  He is glaring at his friend. "J’avais dit ça à Astoria en privé! ”
“Let’s get ahead of it.”  Robards states.  “We complete an internal audit like policy dictates.  If you’re good, you’re good.  If for whatever reason you’re not, we will reconvene then.  I just needed to inform you, Potter, and a hold the vote on beginning the audit.”
“Maybe later.”  James excuses, pocketing the wand.  Brown eyes shifting away from Draco’s observation.
His boyfriend embraces him, wrapping his arms around him.  Harry feels Draco lever himself to flip them so Harry is now on his back.  Chuckling as they go.  His vision filled with Draco’s amused face.  Grey eyes content and loving.  Skin littered with red marks and bruises caused by Harry they have yet to heal.  Marking the man as his.
know I am seeing someone but not that it's you.  So I thought, the clinic is hosting a charity gala at the end of the week.  Astoria’s my plus one and I know you are on the list.  You could meet her and leave whenever so there would not be much pressure.”
A painfully tense silence envelopes the room at Draco’s outburst.  It is the first time Draco’s ever raised his voice during an argument Harry realizes dully and it echoes through him.
He has to consider that question.  “You crossed my mind.  Wondered where you were mostly.  I knew you were overseas, but not where.  I always hoped you were doing okay.  Hoped you found something good for yourself.”  Harry answers truthfully, observing Draco’s curious expression.  “Did you think of me?”
A younger councilman clears his throat after a moment, then asks.  “Do you have any interest in his work as an auror?”
“You did it all for her, didn’t you?”  Draco says slowly, feeling as if he already knows the answer.  He was aware Severus acted as a double agent, but he did not know for certain until after his own trial that his professor was truly loyal to the Order of the Phoenix.
The gala is at its peak when Harry finds himself next to Draco, a way away from others, his back to the wall.  Harry casually hands him a drink and continues to sip his own.  Keeping an eye out for Ron and Hermione.  The lots are being read off by the emcee and winners in the audience being congratulated.  Harry watches Hargreeves and several of his staff get their photos taken on stage.  Hargreeves eyebrows are making their happy movements.  Harry is glad for him.
Dad takes a seat in front of them.  Eyes calculating.  “Knock yourself out.”  He replies, gesturing from Draco to the children sitting across from them.
“I think that happens only in stories you read the children.”  Draco replies wryly, fixing his clothes as he levers himself to his feet.  Harry isn’t far behind.
Jamie grimaces but marches forward.  Draco steps to the side and goes to sit on the big chair Dad usually favored.  Leaning back to rock them.  Lily’s red, sweaty face peeks over Draco’s shoulder.  She wipes her nose on Draco’s shirt and begins to hiccup.  Draco
“You aren’t your father.  You’re not like any of those other Malfoys.”  Potter states, looking contemplative.  “You changed.  Whatever you do with the manor will be good because you’re good.”
“Sweet Merlin.”  She exclaims with an eye roll.  “You know, Ron and I are quite anxious to meet this mystery man too.  How long has it been now?  Since you’ve gotten together?”
Harry frowns, mildly offended.  “I’ve been coming here for years.  I didn’t even know you worked here.”
There are laws about the treatment of freed death eaters – the handful that were and would eventually be freed.  Laws that he and Hermione never agreed with and had to grit their teeth through their objections as the Wizengamot enacted each one.
There is a silence, but it isn’t heavy or awkward.  Not like some of the others earlier in the week.
“My understanding is that Draco Malfoy wasn’t connected to the death eater’s shadow network.”  Kingsley remarks, considering Robards with a careful look.  “None of his statements indicated taking any part in that system.”
The boys voiced missing Ginevra, but there again, Lily never did.  The last two times Ginevra had her, Lily tantrummed at the pass over.  He was told this was typical.  Draco wrote it off as her being so young and not fully comprehending he and Harry would return as scheduled.
The kids have been with Ginny all week.  It's been great to have more free time to be with Draco.  He misses his kids, but he does not dislike the time for himself.  A sort of routine has developed between him and Draco during this time.  Now, it's easier to meet up with Draco at his flat after work.  They have spent more time alone in one of their homes like this than ever before.
During the last year he had pushed past every invisible line that kept him safe and relatively worry-free.  Moving back to Britain.  This mad relationship with Harry.  Then being around the children.  Living at Grimmauld.  Restoring the manor.  And Harry bloody Potter thinks he – Draco Malfoy – is equal to the task of being a parent to his children.  That he is worthy of it.
It didn't help that the entirety of the argument increased in intensity as he continued to drink throughout the evening.
“She doesn’t go to you.”  The Weasley matriarch continues dauntless.  “This whole day if she wanted anything she ran to Harry or Draco.  Doesn’t that concern you at all?”
“So, moving in together is going well I see.”  Hermione remarks wryly.  Ron chortles in response.  Leaning back in his seat and placing his intertwined hands on his belly.  Expression thouroughly entertained.  Harry scowls at both of his best friends.
Potter tilts his head at him, stepping forward to meet him.  “The seal was broken.”  He states as if this explains everything.
Most of the onlookers start loudly shouting and jeering, getting Harry’s attention.  The men led in chains into the chamber are ghosts of their former selves.  Draco looked bad the last few times Harry saw him, but now he seems decimated.  Hair limp, skin pale, and body thin.  A shadow.
Draco is almost comically wide-eyed by the time Harry enters their suite.  Half-dressed in his pajamas, haphazardly attempting to put his arm through the sleeve of his shirt as he reads from a sheaf of paper in his hand.  Normally neat hair disheveled like he’s been running his hands through it.  The whole scene makes Harry grin.  He loved messy Draco.
“He is very proud of you.”  Draco finds himself saying.  James looks sharply at him at that, eyes narrowing.
“Hello, Malfoy.”  Harry begins reaching out to shake his hand, hoping to start things off in a courteous manner.  Uncertain of what to expect.  Malfoy makes no move to shake Harry’s hand but does raise a skeptical eyebrow in response, eyes carefully assessing him top to bottom like the newest Nova broom for sale.  Harry half expects some smart remark, but Malfoy surprises him.
“Let me think.”  Jamie says holding up his hand for patience and searching around the room as if the answer might present itself.  Something.  There must be something he can use here to get around this.
Draco chose Harry’s outfit for tonight.  It's tighter than anything he would usually wear, and he refused shoes other than his boots.  He looks okay he thinks.  It isn't what he would normally choose for himself but it's almost better that way.  Draco is obviously pleased he allowed him to play dress up.  So much so, Harry catches Draco checking him out once or twice before they even make it out of the house.  That makes him feel good - more comfortable anyway.
He does not care that this boy yelled at him.  Shouted hateful things at him.  None of it matters.  All he has in this moment is concern and affection for him.  It is that which grounds him while a part of him tries to wander away.  A fleeting memory of his mother holding him similarly coming to mind.
Jamie and Al appear, both with ornery expressions on their faces.  Harry reminds himself sternly that Ginny can deal with whatever is brewing here.  He hugs them both.  Instructing them to behave and mind their mother.  Al hugs Draco goodbye after his boyfriend frees himself from Lily’s grasp.  Jamie even draws near to offer Draco a goodbye.
cautious.  He waits for the moment Draco tells him something that makes him hesitate.  That makes him unsure.  Drawback.
Draco gives him a rotten look for that but the twitch upward at the corner of his mouth gives him away.  His thumb rubs distractingly at Harry’s sternum where his hand rests.
“She isn’t dancing on the counters yet.”  Draco remarks.  “That’s the limit for serving her last I checked.”
the question, Potter.”  Draco tells him.  “I suppose I will start work on restoration.  Do you know anyone in the market for a dated, fixer-upper?”
Harry nearly chokes on his drink and works to clear his throat.  “I think you have the wrong idea, Narcissa.”  He breaks in hoarsely.  He did
His cock is definitely interested in the goings-on now.  Their bodies moving languidly with each other as Harry moves slowly, eyes on him.
“Don’t start.”  Draco states, smacking at his chest lightly.  Dry humor and embarrassment returning.  Harry can't help it.  Teasing Draco is too much fun for him to resist.
“This is going well.”  Draco comments, picking an invisible piece of lint off his jumper.  “If you’ll allow me?”
“Excuse me, are you Hermione Granger’s friend?”  A lightly accented, feminine voice asks him from behind.
.  Do you know what I believed in when I was five?  I believed Fred when he told me that you really did have eyes in the back of your head!  And in case you’ve forgotten, she is
“Six months in last time around, we saw greater flexibility here.  Of course, this could be due to the different materials we used at the time and the ongoing deterioration to the joint from the curse.”  Hargreeves muses, putting his hand to his chin in his pondering way Harry had grown accustomed to seeing.
It is his turn to be startled when the woman’s eyes bulge open and she begins to screech nonsensically.  Hands tearing ineffectively at the border of her painting.  Then, realizing her audience, glares down madly at the boys from the faded, yellowed paintwork.  “FOUL HALF-BLOODS.  CHILDREN OF BLOOD TRAITORS.  MY HOUSE RUINED BY YOUR VILE FATHER.”
Draco doesn't really react to the question at first.  Jamie is just about to repeat himself when the man speaks. “I didn't want to hurt people . . . or kill them.  I hated who I was.  I was a coward and feared I would die one too.  That is why I left ultimately.  I-I hadn't really planned on helping your father.  It was impulsive and even now I don't know if it was fully a choice.  He was the first person I helped; you know.  I let him take my wand so that he might live.  I abandoned the death eaters shortly afterward.”
“Well, I try.”  Harry replies with an exaggerated put upon tone, putting his arm around the back of the bench as Draco moves to sit closer to him.
“It's really okay, Malfoy.”  Ginny reassures, smile sympathetic as they stand in the entryway of the cottage.  “There isn’t a lot to it, but its mine.”
Harry cringes, expression caught.  Obviously thinking through his response.  “Maybe.”  His boyfriend hedges, stopping them in front of a public bench, and pulling Draco to sit down beside him.
“Inquisitors.  There was a group of them when I arrived outside your department.  They sent a fire summons to my work.  They told me you were being questioned because of me – that I had been accused of compromising auror investigations.  Then two aurors brought me here.  What happened?  What did I do?”  Draco says in a rush.
Harry playfully elbows him.  Draco dodging him gracefully, expression mirthful.  There is a respite in the conversation though as they walk on.  Harry notices Draco hold himself more rigidly like he does when uncomfortable or unsure – falling back on hardline posture.
“Goodnight, Albus.”  Draco wishes him, bending to kiss the crown of the boy’s head before he can reflect too much on his sentimentality.  “Sleep well.”
“Not on your life.”  Draco retorts waspily, forcing himself not to cross his arms defensively.  Really.  Of course, he was not the only one who realized how domestic this scene was.
“He taught Defense Against the Dark Arts in our third year.”  Draco answers, nodding between him and Dad.  “He was the best teacher we had in that subject.”
He has no problem with this.  If anything, he gets on swimmingly with Hermione.  He and Weasley have also come a long way and maintain a standing friendly chess rivalry.  However, there is a special quality to being around one’s best friends.  It is akin to coming home after a being away for a while.
Malfoy Manor was scarcely changed by time.  Grimmer and overgrown certainly, but indomitable, nonetheless.  He was led through the grey, solemness of the estate by a profusely bowing deferential house elf.  Until finally, he was directed to sit at the dying woman’s bedside on a chair that was probably older than his grandfather in a room that could have only been last redecorated during the Victorian era.  All heavy woods and rich colors save for the pale woman supported on the bed.
“Al.”  Dad calls out.  Clearly irritated.  Jamie watches him get up and leave the room.  Jamie wouldn’t want to be Al right now.  Draco pats Lily’s head, gently moving her hair out of her red face.  Lily hiccupping, “My a-a-rm, Draco-o-o!”
He has been many extraordinary places and played a role in many amazing events, but he has only ever met one phoenix.  And the last he saw Fawkes was in 1997 soaring over Hogwarts singing his haunting lament.
“You are right.”  Draco acknowledges, voice quiet but sure.  “I am sorry for how horrible I was to you and your family.  I can only ask for forgiveness for the things I have done although I know I do not deserve it.”
“Then for your sake, I hope it works out.”  Pansy says quietly.  Eyes softening at Draco’s admission.  “Love isn’t easy.  I know it cannot be easy with everything that has happened between you two.  However, I also know you and – I’d like to think – enough about him.  You two are both stubborn men who fight for what they want.”
“You want to know what my daily life was like here, Harry?”  Draco starts in a strained tone, expression haunted.  “I’ll tell you.  I scarcely ate.  I rarely slept and when I did it was on my mother’s bedroom floor for whatever veneer of safety that afforded us both.  My father was out of favor.  I rarely saw him and when I did it was unpleasant to say the least.  There were . . . trainings.  Bellatrix and her cronies were in charge of those.
“I couldn’t tell."  Potter says.  "It was the first time we had sex – of course it was a little awkward.  I liked it a lot though – if I didn’t make that clear enough before last night.  It seemed like you did too.”
The flat has flowy curtains that hang around the large window that overlooks the street two floors below.  It also has stairs that lead up to a lofted office.  He, Al, and Lily run up and down the sleek stairs a lot.  It's not carpeted like the stairs at home and much easier to slide down.  He even plays quidditch announcer up there while Lily and Al run round the room pretending they’re on brooms.  Dad charms a circular couch pillow to be their quaffle.  Dad and Draco all the while sitting close on the couch watching them as they talk about grown up stuff.
is the question you should be asking.”  Lucius replies vehemently, face distorted.  “The manor rejected
“There’s only us now.”  Luna promises serenely as she and her friend enter the room.  “How lovely, more Potter children.”  The woman notes pleasantly as she sees Jamie’s siblings.
“There’s more holes by that fountain over the garden wall.  We should look over there.”  Al suggests, pointing ahead, and already walking forward.
Harry shrugs out of his work clothes and exchanges them for a tee and joggers.  Suddenly feeling how tired he is.  Sometimes it seemed like the second he took off the uniform, his body reminded him that he was sore.  It’s late.  Almost midnight when he settles into their bed.  Scrolling through the news feed app on his phone, observing Draco finally turn in as well.  His boyfriend grabbing the book he’s been reading lately from the bedside table and opening it to the marked page.  Barely muffling a yawn as he goes.
“No, James.”  Draco corrects.  “Dyslexia is a disorder that can make it challenging for people to read and write.  This may be part of why you do not like to read.”
When the sentences are passed down, Harry does not quite know what to think.  Or how to process it.  He does genuinely feel happy that Malfoy will not spend the remainder of his days in Azkaban.  That is true enough.  The talk of probation is nearly drowned out by the uproar of the crowd.  Spitting, angry and yelling about Malfoy’s light sentence.
in them.  He lives with them.  He is a critical part of their routine.  He acts frequently as their guardian.  He is filled with pride when he watches James learn to read a new word or summarize what he read after such hard work.  Delighted when Albus shows a natural interest in potions and learning about magical creatures.  Endeared when Lily breaks into a run once she sees him at pick up.  Jumping into his arms like they have been separated for too long.
“It is wrong.  One day the boy met - a wizard.  He had been told all his life this wizard was perfect.  The
“I do.”  Draco allows, biting at the bottom corner of his lip like he did when he was scared to admit something that made him nervous.  “If I ought to have said it earlier, I am sorry for that.  I love you – much more than I know how to say.”
At least, Al didn't sneeze as much, and Lily’s smudged handprints were not left as frequently on surfaces.  Dad enlarged the small windows that ran along the main floor and the basement, making the rooms brighter and bigger seeming.  A paned glass door set near the entry of the pantry leading out to the garden.  Lighting up the mismatched tiles on the kitchen floor Dad had laid one day.  Jamie and Al handing different tiles over at intervals for him to lay with minimal swearing.
“What does it matter?”  He argues back, keeping his voice even as the others were trying to enjoy their meal.  “We’re the same distance away.”
“How did I earn this?”  He asks delightedly, settling his hands on Draco’s hips.  Smirking, Draco leans forward to kiss him.  Hands coming up to frame Harry’s face as he does.  The kiss light but no less for that with the initial touch sending shock through him.  His boyfriend's tongue peeking out at the end as if to tease him.  Harry is very much on board that.  Having Draco close like this is a treat.  Any time touching Draco was.  It could take a while to coax him to this point.
If it was down solely to logic he wouldn't choose this man.  Not desire this man.  Their history alone during the war should be enough for him to never want to associate with Draco again – not agree to be the man’s lab rat let alone his friend.  But it's not only up to his head.
“You’re Draco Malfoy.”  Doge says all in one burst, practically vibrating and thrusting his hand forward in an open invitation to shake Draco’s.  “You invented Serene Sunrise.  My gran had dementia and she did loads better after her healer prescribed her that potion.  She was able to sleep all through the night without getting confused and upset.”
He was going to propose they make a small trip there during their holiday, and he is pleased Harry has beat him to it.
“I am, you arsehole.”  Harry says, tone careworn.  “Merlin’s sake, Draco, why didn’t you wait for me before running into that bloody place?  I thought we'd agreed.”
“This is a date, yes?”  Draco checks abruptly.  He wants to be certain here.  Their last evening together at the pub was emotionally charged and they spent most of it looking shyly at each other still holding hands under their table.  Potter fiddling with the base of his glass.  Stupid grin on his face.
When they let go of each other, he clasps her lightly by the shoulders.  “I appreciate everything you do for me and my sprogs.  I love you and I’m sorry I’ve been such a nuisance today.  I hope you can forgive me.”
“You want me to leave?”  Harry restates feeling astonished.  The reality of the severity of their argument crashing around him.  “The manor?”
He isn't certain he said it aloud for a few moments.  It has been a long time since he felt his heart thud in his chest like this in uncertainty.  He watches the kids out of his peripheral vision.  It looks like they are having fun.
“Hi.”  He says dumbly when he realizes Draco is silently returning his gaze.  Staring.  Grey eyes going over him and making him feel warm despite the uncertain welcome.
“I love you.”  He tells his boyfriend when he’s drank enough and caught his breath.  “That was so bloody hot, Draco.  You were fantastic.”  He compliments, ducking in to kiss his boyfriend’s cheek.
Kingsley sighs.  A rare expression of frustration.  “Gawain and Harry can understand my thinking, I believe.  I was an auror for years.  You come to rely on your instincts and mine are telling me we are playing into whatever game this perpetrator is playing.  There have been some successes, certainly, but we need to formulate a novel approach.  Something whoever this is, isn’t expecting.”
Draco Malfoy is quite literally left at an icy dock on the North Sea leagues outside of Azkaban and miles away from the nearest muggle population.  It is the middle of December and the ground is frozen beneath them.  The cold biting.  Malfoy has no coat and no gloves.  Dressed in the loose, dark robes he was wearing when they imprisoned him that first day over a decade ago.
“Not entirely.”  Harry replies.  Thinking of Charlie and Dominique.  They have been openly queer for years.  Much longer than him and no less supported by the family.  “It's important to Hermione that people are treated fairly.”
“Very well.”  Mrs. Malfoy drawls blinking once tone nonplussed.  “How does that pertain to anything?”
“Do you see your friends very much?”  Draco inquires.  “I know you’re busy, but it was always you three together.  You, Granger, and Weasley.  They’re married now, right?”
“Nooo.”  He groans despondently sagging forward in his chair.  Bixby won’t let them on the pitch if he’s fixing it.  He didn’t like him and Al on the pitch anyways.  Said they were messy even when he and Al tried to clean up after themselves.  And worst of all, except for the pitch the manor was gruesomely, mind-numbingly
“Why don’t – why don’t I let you get ready?”  He eventually suggests gesturing slightly to the hallway.  Hoping to lighten the mood.  No need for this to ruin their morning he chides himself.  “I left a spare set of clothes and toiletries for you in the loo.  I can get some food for us in the meantime.”
Draco snorts.  Really.  But he will not look a gift dragon in the mouth.  Draco flicks his wand again, sending a cleaning charm across them.  He knows Harry prefers real showers, but Draco would very much rather not fall asleep in drying spunk and lube.
Narcissa Black Malfoy died in a back room of Malfoy Manor two days later.  Her sister and great-nephew were at her graveside when she was buried.  The two people she loved most in the world in Azkaban.  Her husband serving a life sentence and her son finishing his own in less than a year.  The estate, save for a few heirlooms that are owled to him, parceled off and sold.  The remainder of the restitution owed by her son finally met.
Hargreeves turns sharply and walks to an ajar frosted glass door off to the side.  Knocking hard twice.  A quiet “Enter,” emanates from the room.  The healer gestures Harry to follow, opening the door wider for them both.  Harry finds himself in a well-lit office with shelves upon shelves covering every free space of the walls filled with a wide variety of potions equipment and bottles.  Another tidy space clearly set up with the lab outside in mind.  The space was impressive like so much of the clinic Hargreeves had built, but that isn’t what makes Harry stop in his tracks.
“Can I have that in writing?”  Harry jokes with a wane smile, reaching out to rest his palm on Draco’s cheek.  Wiping away a tear with his thumb.  “I know several of our old professors would be amazed to see that.”
“My kids are with their mum.  They stay with her mostly.”  Harry admits feeling a bit sheepish.  They haven’t really talked about him at all.  Or anything too personal about either of them.  “I don’t know how much you know about my life since –
“I don’t really know how to say it so I just will.”  Harry says steeling himself.  “I’ve started seeing someone the last few weeks.”
They stroll away from Pansy, heading to the stairs leading to the wrap around balcony.  Astoria firmly leading the way.  There is a flash of a camera and Astoria is smiling brightly as they ascend.  Harry rather likes her he thinks.
“No, I am afraid I don’t know, Potter.  Care to inform the class?”  Draco retorts brow raising in challenge.  It is just to tease Potter of course, but Draco would appreciate some clarification.  Potter has consistently dumbfounded him after all.
His friend shakes her head, smile kind.  “A lot of people regret their actions and inactions during the war.  It changed all of us.  I hope for the better.  I'll try not to judge him for it.  I hope he makes good choices now.  We regret what we do not try after all.”
A gavel bangs on the table.  “We will reconvene in fifteen minutes.  We expect an answer to whether you will be providing a statement today or not, Mr. Malfoy.  Evidence submitted will be discussed at that time.  Do you understand, Mr. Malfoy?”
“Riva Costas.”  Harry correctly identifies.  Ron scowls.  “Retired curse breaker.  Bill’s old mentor.  Nice try.”
“There’s an open bar.”  Ron tells him, inclining his head meaningfully to one of the spaces squared off to serve guests.  He was a good friend.  Hermione smiles bemusedly beside them.  It was nice sometimes to be dressed up like this out doing adult things instead of chasing after sprogs - which is what he would be doing otherwise.  Tonight, that honor fell to one of his few non-Weasley babysitters: Amanda Clearwater.  The young auror had a knack with his kids.
Hargreeves checks his watch as Harry’s chart snaps shut on the desk and is summoned by the healer.  “You’re welcome to come with me to our research center, Potter.  There should be someone there now who can walk you through the trial process for the salve.”
“Nothing that you need to know about now, Jamie.”  Dad intervenes putting a hand up and stopping Draco.  “Do you remember the story I told you about the boy who changed by making choices to help people?”
