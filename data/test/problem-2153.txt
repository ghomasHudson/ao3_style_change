Half the village was there to greet them on the beach as usual. The Viking wives and their children were eagerly seeing the return of their families. A few others were there, hoping to offer their assistance to the Vikings in exchange for some of the loot they carried back for them as per usual. They weren't important though. Harry scanned the crowd for a pair of silver eyes under a mane of white-blond hair.
"Our son is going to have a sweet tooth just like his papa," Harry repeated in a grave tone. Scorpius giggled before quickly demanding for Draco to hide the cookies. "I hope you shared with James."
"I knew I should've kept you out of this."
"What—" Draco squawked, but before he could gather enough brain cells to form a proper sentence, Pansy was already skipping down the stairs that lead to the girls' dormitory.
"I never would've thought I'd see the day where Potter listens peacefully," Draco drawled before burying his face into Blaise's back.
Please let me know what you guys think about either my writing or the plot! I'd be happy to answer questions if you have any as well! Thank you for reading and see you next update! <3
Draco sighed. "Look."
"This is Draco's true nature, I'm afraid," Blaise sneered. "Petty and bastard-like."
"Mind you, I was unaware that you three were on good terms with my friends at the time. What happened during those two weeks anyways?" Draco asked curiously.
"And we want to help," Granger said.
Yaxley was one of the Death Eaters who escaped from Azkaban a week ago. All departments had their eyes set on catching all of them and Harry and Ron were assigned to track Yaxley down. Draco, who had remembered his disgusting and awful breath, supported them both and offered all the information he'd known about Yaxley and his safe-manors. Harry exploded a lightbulb when he heard that Yaxley was a specialist in developing new dark curses.
This man wasn’t his friend.
His papa had been cold at some point during the war, too cold for Scorpius to have cuddled back into warmth whenever he had nightmares or had a fight with Larissa.
Draco, used to hearing complaints like this from the younger Slytherins, waved him off. "Try and do it for a minute first. We'll be doing three sets right now to get you used to it. Then we'll move onto the next step of proper pureblood posture."
He had not meant to actually say that. He had been trying the best to not acknowledge it, and now his mouth decided it was time for him to just say it. Too bad it was in front of Malfoy himself.
"No," Draco breathed.
"And that something is...?"
Draco's eyes almost bugged out of their rightful sockets.
Perhaps it was because of how the grey eyes sparkled, dreams of belonging and love clearly within his reach. Perhaps it was because of how his uncle was wearing a grin, something that Draco had never seen in any of the portraits he'd seen before. Or perhaps it's because of how the man was wearing a bright pink sweater with an 'H' and holding a baby orange kitten in his arms.
He closed his eyes. "Mother said he was the most honorable and loyal man she ever had the pleasure of meeting, and she told me how Sirius would never be capable of doing what everyone had accused him of doing. Once Mother made those things especially clear, she told me a story about how a tiny puppy somehow wandered into a lion's den and was excluded for being an outsider. But then, a team of fierce cubs took him under their wing, and by the next time those other lions saw him, he became a guard dog who fought off two big, mean hippogriffs."
Severus smoothed his stormy facial expression. "Yes. I believe you will bring Potter a great ordeal of trouble."
"Yes, I've heard." Draco's tone of voice betrays the 'obviously, ponce' that he doesn't say. "And why aren't you celebrating?"
"Are you just offering because you feel guilty for what you did?"
Both of them marched out to the Great Lake,
He then maneuvered the book so it'd be within both of their views. The first picture was just plain beautiful— it was of a red-headed woman crowned with a flower crown and dressed in a gorgeous wedding dress whilst being carried bridal style of a ridiculously handsome version of Harry in a tuxedo. It was his parents, no doubt, and they looked so young in the picture. They looked carefree, like a war wasn't happening around them.
Harry shrugged. "Dumbledore wanted me to want to die for all of wizard-kind. So he left me with my muggle relatives."
Draco opened his mouth to tell them about the Dark Lord, but all that came out was a choked cough and (thankfully) muffled retch. He turned his back to them, feeling like he was about to faint from the lack of oxygen, and covered his mouth with his hands. There was a clamor around him as the petals and flowers drifted down on their own, but Draco waved them off. He wiped his mouth with his forearm's sleeve, disgusting himself almost immediately.
"Will you be staying after class again?" Blaise asked.
Draco rolled his eyes.
That's why he didn't cry out when a skeleton-like woman found him the next morning, disdainfully peering down her nose at him. That's why he didn't cry out when he met his cousin for the first time, who was an even uglier little potato than many claimed, and when he met a fat man with a terrifying voice and loomed over him like some nightmare.
"So are you?"
Which was wonderful, of course.
Draco turned away from him and tried not to cry.
"You're in trouble now," Blaise whispered to him.
"Perhaps."
They were the farthest thing from friendship.
"Please, Reg. You'd think I knew you better than that."
"Why don't you go on your own?" he asked, sighing. "Surely you could go on your own."
“I’m such an idiot.”
"'Was'? Draco, I think you mean 'is'," Harry snickered.
For as long as he could, he’d put off telling Draco that all of this was done out of revenge. None of it was real; it was all a sham to make his father pay for doing the very same thing to Hermione all those years ago.
"No. Why would I talk to her about it?"
At that, Draco sped towards the post office to owl an original jewelry design to Pansy, who delivered exactly what he wanted just before December 24th, allowing him just enough time to polish the ring and package it properly. He wrote a detailed letter to her afterwards, thanking her for not asking any questions about it and delivering the gift swiftly.
Draco snorted. "I told you it was final, Scarhead."
Draco had the overwhelming urge to snap back and apologize at the same time. "How is it weird? Aren't I allowed to choose when I look at you and not? I didn't think you'd be this self-conceited."
"I still don't know who she was referring to. She spoke of a cousin that had chosen their own path, but the only relative I know that did so is Sirius Black, who escaped Azkaban two years ago. Mother had once told me how close they'd been."
Pansy scoffed, waving him off. She seemingly regained her composure and, this time, she walked towards them instead of running. However, when she was only a foot or two away, she suddenly jumped and crushed Draco's spine with the strength of her hug. Suppressing a pained groan, Draco vaguely heard a voice resembling Blaise's telling him about the terrifying strength of witches.
"Er..." Harry shrugged. "Anything."
messed up.”
"Why not?" he demanded.
"So you're saying you're okay with his father
But compared to that, hearing Malfoy openly state that Harry had cursed him, had hurt him so profoundly, made his insides feel even more cold than natural.
"Oh," Potter dumbly said. He shifted on the balls of his feet. "Right. Er, so just talk a bit more like you?"
He then folded his hands behind his back, his eyes narrowing when he noticed the way Edgecombe's hands were folded in front of her lower abdomen.
Draco smiled. "Precisely."
"Yes. It had been the first time she mentioned him to me, and Father had been incredibly disappointed when I told him so. He didn't want me to believe Mother."
Harry secretly loved school and always volunteered to stay after school. He could clean really well and get compliments; he could help the janitor and earn a toothy grin. He could even make a only-for-a-minute friend and learn of some witty comebacks during a conversation he never heard before.
"More like safe-
"Oh," Harry breathed.
"He's not wrong though. You are dramatic," Harry noted.
"This..." Draco tried not to laugh. "This is a quill, Pansy. How in Merlin's name are you planning to kill me with a quill?"
"Alright. Well, we're here for you," Theo offered.
Again, Draco sighed. "Blaise, I'm not completely helpless. I know how to cast some wandless magic. I can defend myself if— and I really do mean
"He doesn't know who it is," Harry said.
The goblin opened the vaults, allowing them to peer into a slightly less wealthy vault but one that was wealthy nonetheless. Draco and Harry stepped in— Whisps standing outside as Draco had asked— and Draco followed as Harry began walking around the vault. When he finally stopped, they stood in front of a thick book. And when he flipped it open, Draco realized that it was a letter and a collection of baby pictures. He took a step back to give Harry some space.
"They're in classes right now," Madam Pomfrey replied, handing him a small, red vial. "They're getting ready for their OWLs."
"Draco, what are you doing?" Harry yelled, grabbing him by the arm before Draco could make an apology.
Thoroughly scolded and afraid for all the things (and person) she mentioned in her little tirade, Draco nodded sheepishly.
Draco unplugged his ears and sent a pointed look towards Harry. Although he must've been fuming, Harry winced and apologetically nodded towards him. "Sorry, Draco." Then his cheeks flushed and he apologized to everyone else who was present. Which was, obviously, not a lot.
"What?" Draco asked again stupidly.
There was no way to know when Harry would return though. Some raids took longer than others, depending on how far they sailed and how many villages they could find along the way. Draco had been warned of varying lengths of a few days to a whole month so he just stopped bothering to count the days and merely concentrated on keeping himself busy.
He was almost certain he pronounced the name wrong. How does one even pronounce such a difficult name like 'Hyacinthe'? His mother probably knew.
She followed his lead docilly, walking in step two spaces behind him.
Bellatrix fiddled with her wand. "No promises about him."
Of course, Harry didn't make it easy to resist.
The duel ceased— his father staring at him blankly, a question clear in his eyes, his boyfriend telling him to go away with his eyes, and Sirius looking at him like he was mad for coming into the room— and Draco swallowed thickly as he returned his father's gaze.
"Oh," Harry muttered quietly. "That's new."
"I'm fine with calling it whatever you want," Harry kindly prompted, "but frankly, I want us to be entirely exclusive. I'm… I can be jealous sometimes and I don't exactly like the thought of you kissing Zabini or someone else. So yeah. Exclusive is the thing I want us to be."
Draco jumped and practically attacked him with the cuff when he whirled around. "What?"
"Of course, Master Draco! Vicky will return to the kitchens now!" She disappeared with a pop, leaving Draco alone with a still-startled Gryffindor.
Malfoy sighed, finally releasing Harry's arm in favor of pinching his nose bridge with two perfect fingers. "You really are a pain, Potter."
"Time Chamber. You?"
"What did you used to do with Remus?" Draco asked. "Before you got married?"
Harry was sure he was not only blind, but deaf.
Draco gave him a nasty look. "It is my property. I'm not
Harry's shoulders rose and fell. "Just curious. You look at her different."
"Alright."
"I'd miss you," Harry replied casually, "but I guess I could understand why you'd want to go so far away. As for me, I don't know what I want to do after Hogwarts. I used to want to be an Auror, but… I've had enough of fighting."
Draco looked over his shoulder and snickered. "That's Severus for you."
"Nothing," Draco quickly said.
"I honestly have no idea," Montague sighed. Shrugging, he conjured a fork for Draco to use. "There's nothing to exceptionally admire about Draco. He's a chocolate-addicted, childish piece of shit. But I unfortunately still do harbor a few feelings for him."
So when they made plans to meet the day before Christmas, Draco wanted their eighth year Christmas to be memorable, to make up for his childhood misery.
"Yes. They were quite lovely. With feathers as extravagant as the gold from El Dorado and names as priceless as the constellations in the midnight sky."
"Rissse," Voldemort hissed. Draco did as he was ordered, making sure that his head was still bowed. Narcissa braced herself for the worst punishment; her right leg was ready to move in front of her son and take the punishment herself. Instead, Voldemort hissed, "Your misssion. Tell me."
"Yes. I just woke up one day to petals. It was all incredibly strange at the time, and I didn't want to rest easy until I figured out what it was," Draco recalled. Then he shook himself out of it. "Professor Lupin had too many scars for it to be considered normal. He disappeared for a few days the first month and then returned with a weary smile and new scar. And not to mention how Severus kept muttering werewolf remarks under his breath whenever Professor Lupin was nearby. The dots were already there. We just had to connect them."
Hermione and Ron nodded, although a bit reluctantly. Draco knew they were hesitant to perform any type of manipulation, regardless of whether or not Harry's fate was involved, but he also knew he couldn't focus on explaining himself any further. He was practically itching for answers.
He had gotten his way for so long— with his parents, that is, not with Harry— during his childhood and had nothing go his way as an adult so he wasn't entirely too sure how to respond.
"I know that," Harry said. "Of course I do. I just... well, in a way, once I heard him laugh, my mind cleared up and I was able to focus more. I think it actually helped alleviate some other students' worries about the exam and it helped lighten the atmosphere in the classroom. But if you want to pin this on someone, please don't blame Draco. It was me and I'll do anything to make it up to my classmates, him, and you, professor."
"Harry thought you wouldn't want to kiss him without him being affected by a different form of your Hanahaki," Blaise informed. Harry sent him a betrayed look.
Again, Draco did the same.
All of theme froze in their tracks. And whatever they were arguing about— Lucius Malfoy apparently— it couldn't have been good. Theo couldn't even remember the last time they fought over anything. Actually, he couldn't remember the last time he saw Draco
Harry was the more clingier of the two of them, always sobbing whenever Draco had to meet with foreign ambassadors. Well, he didn't
"Exactly! It was a secret,
When he had been preoccupied with the flowers, he'd been a bit to ignorant to the action effects of it. His fate wasn't that he was going to die alone by choking on bloodied flowers; it was that his magical core was slowly being drained of its energy. That was why Draco had felt so sluggish the week before he collapsed of exhaustion. The flowers' run on him that Valentine's night had been the one thing that pushed him over the edge. This depletion of his core's energy was also part of the reason why Draco was terrified on putting on his affinity's cuff.
"Does everyone know about runes but me?" Harry asked, his cheeks a light pink.
(See the end of the chapter for
By the start second month, Draco realized Harry was being serious about his confession and his heart actually thudded against his chest traitorously whenever he thought of it.
Harry frowned, but he didn't argue as Draco tugged him out into the empty corridors.
After all, for nothing more than a split second, he could have sworn he saw the war playing out in front of him when he stared back into Potter's stupid eyes. He could have sworn he saw Luna Lovegood in the cold, dungeon-like cellar of the Malfoy manor, her body worryingly pale and shivering like she was living through the Ice Age. He saw her pale, transparent eyes staring at him with nothing but kindness and forgiveness. He saw the chains around her wrists and ankles, and he could have sworn he heard Lovegood's slow breathing and even slower beating of her heart. He heard the distant rattling of chains, and the non-discrete screams of both pain and mortification haunted him in the back. Draco could've sworn he was back at the manor; he could have sworn he was still
Heat rushed to his face.
of his own character. And, guessing by how Harry laughed suddenly, Draco had said that out loud.
When Harry glanced away from Draco, he was greeted by the sight of a tall, Slytherin caveman loose in Hogwarts. The caveman nodded politely in his direction so Harry though that the caveman was not like the cavemen inside of his Uncle Vernon's telly. Realizing that he was being impolite, Harry awkwardly flashed a smile before turning back to Draco. He frowned when he realized that he probably messed up the weird caveman greeting the caveman had given him.
His father always said his papa could do the impossible. Scorpius was a fool for not reading between the lines.
," he commanded, his voice like thunder clapping on a desolate mountain.
"Alright. Then don't," Draco said.
new beginning."
Once again, Draco was reminded of just how different things were here. In Lucius’s and Astoria’s homes, there were cooks to handle the meals. Despite having the wealth to hire a cook if he wanted to, Harry had chosen to cook for himself. More than that, the very notion of someone cooking for him seems to never have crossed his mind.
Draco stared at the idiot, who stopped beside him and pretended like he didn't just draw the attention of everyone waiting outside the classroom and shock Blaise into stunned silence. Potter looked up once his breathing returned to normal, and Draco quickly looked away before muttering, "My favorite piece is the knight."
"Draco, I swear to Merlin and and all four Hogwarts Founders, if you do such a stupid thing—what does Cissy have to say about this? Is she in agreement?"
"I understand the appeal of doing so," he said carefully.
"Mother has already trained me in Legilimency and Occlumency, and I already developed an immunity against the Cruciatus Curse. Father also repeats all information to me because he believes I will always zone out during the meetings and, if I get caught, all I have to do is mimic whatever my father does and then pretend to be dead. It'll be easy for me to escape as well."
"I'll accompany you," Narcissa decided. She'd step in and offer herself up if push came to shove.
“You lay a hand on Draco?”
Draco and Harry glanced towards each other awkwardly from the doorway.
Draco stared at her dumbly.
Draco's eyes were wide. "And this is a gift?"
Professor Hayes did no such thing however. Instead, she smiled and kindly urged him to contribute.
"Yes, Malfoy?"
Regulus exchanges a glance with Severus, which made Draco grin so widely that Harry still teases him about being more happy at his godfather's engagement rather than their own wedding.
"Why not?" Potter asked like an idiot.
"Do you really think that you mean so little to me that I would throw you away?" Blaise cried out.
"And I thought I accidentally killed Harry last year when I gave him some gillyweed," Longbottom added. "I think that counts."
"How do you know that?" Hermione asked quietly.
Blaise pursed his lips. "Because you're undergoing a less horrific version of Draco's Hanahaki disease and telling him would one: help you, and two:
"No. Though... they somehow learned that Remus was a werewolf and started giving him raw meat."
Fred interrupted. "Hey Gred?"
"Really?" Potter asked, seemingly taken aback by that knowledge.
"It's fine. You should finish the assignments," Blaise added, unknowingly going along with the plan. "Harry, you too. The quicker we complete them, the less we worry about them."
Because the Dark Lord has been picking volunteers (see 'victims') to bring Harry's head to him.
So, instead of crying or packing his bags immediately, Narcissa pulled him in for a quick hug. "Draco."
"We were talking first—"
Blaise called bullshit.
"No, we're not," Theo replied, eyes not leaving his book. "Pansy's making sure you eat properly, I'm doing research, and Blaise is finishing all of his homework. We're totally fine. And so will you."
"Shut up," he hissed. Pansy laughed.
Even though he was confused, Harry didn't take the sudden warmth for granted. He pulled the thin sheet over his tiny body, tucking the teddy into his chin, and trying not to cry as the cardboard box stabbed cruelly into his side.
Reeling back, Draco coughed. "What?"
Bringing the slightly cooler cup to his lips again, Draco sipped some milk in a pleasant manner.
Everyone snickered while Pansy and Theo indignantly shouted, "Hey!"
"Three," Theo added.
He watched silently as Draco excitedly walked around, the slight tilt in his head telling Harry that he was disgusted with the dustiness and overall messiness of the classroom. Harry, not wanting to watch Draco's disappointment for much longer, glanced around. His eyes settled on a rustic ladder.
"...I'm not."
Draco's head snapped up. "Yes, Harry?"
“Shit, no wonder you guys hate them all.”
Draco smirked. "You're complaining simply because you want to look better in Harry's eyes. You've been complaining about him for a week or two already."
Draco’s eyes practically light up when he sees them and that’s when Harry knows he fucked up.
"I don't know. Perhaps... Potions?"
“There’s only one bed,” he blurted out.
Potter, who had no idea how deep into hell he just walked into, agreed.
Draco winced. Feeling emotions for Harry was worthy of things worse than death. Becoming friends with Harry allowed him to trick the Dark Lord and his factions into thinking he was attempting to lead Harry into a false sense of security before hurting him. But being in love with him?
Now, he desperately wished he was wrong for two reasons: he loves the git and the git was dying.
It was even riskier to talk to Potter in front of his friends in the busy hallway.
Draco glanced towards Harry, who was looking at him encouragingly. "He's punishing Father for losing this journal of his. And I took the Dark Mark."
"I do," Draco confessed, "it's been too long since I faced you on the Pitch. I'd have loved to kick your arse this year."
After the confession, Harry followed him around everywhere, barely giving him a moment's reprieve, and nagging him about everything he was too exhausted to think of.
"Harry should go with him," Hermione said as if nothing happened. "I'm sure that neither haven't started the homework yet, and since Harry and Draco got a head-start, they should be the ones buying lunch. Harry wouldn't mind, right?"
"No I didn't!"
There is no way he'll survive if he tried kissing Draco.
"Don't try, Granger. Either he stops or I don't help you at all," Draco said. At Granger's curious look, he pursed his lips. "It's awfully creepy, and I have other matters to concern myself with that has no connection to Potter whatsoever. If he has a problem, please tell him to grow some balls and hex me instead of staring."
Harry snapped out of his daze. "What? Draco—"
"Maybe I just needed to blink," Draco replied.
Draco tried to sound disgusted or something— hoping that the familiarity of rivalry would make him feel something— but he knew that he just sounded tired. "Whatever, Malfoy. Follow me," Harry requested, unknowingly confirming Draco's suspicion.
"I don't want anyone," Theo replied, turning away from him and Pansy. To anyone else, he might've appeared dismissive of the idea as a whole, but Harry saw Theo's ever-growing blush and the way the tips of his mouth quirked up into a shy smile. Harry heard the complete phrase Theo didn't say: 'I don't want anyone who's not Pansy.'
"I can't."
Like all the other nights before, Draco laid on his bed without the slightest hint of falling asleep. He had no doubt that sleep would never come by him again. It's been too long since he's had a good night's sleep, and that definitely wasn't about to change. Sighing, Draco stared into the silver ceiling and imagined how it'd feel to be crushed by debris and broken tiles.
"Then you stole me away from it!" Draco accused. He gripped Harry's collar weakly. "What do you have to say for yourself, Harry?"
Sighing, Draco leaned his head against the post of his bed. Pansy watched as he participated in a mental battle with himself. "...why am I getting the feeling that you know something already, Pans?"
So he didn't understand why Harry would want to go back to those days.
For example, since I've finished "Floating Black Petals," I'm planning to focus on my theatre-based fic: "Now Playing: The Potter-Black Deal of '76." In summary, it's a fic about how Draco and Harry are forced to engage in a muggle theatre class during their final year at Hogwarts and they uncover some secrets about Regulus Black, Sirius's brother and Draco's uncle as you all know it, and Hyacinthe Potter, the Slytherin Potter during the Marauder's Era. Their meddlesome teacher makes their lives much worse by making them the lead actors, forcing them to work together if they want to pass the class and, thanks to how muggle curriculum has become important in Hogwarts, their Eighth Year.
Draco chanted silently,
"Adrian, you’re talking like you totally weren't worried about him," Blaise snickered. He sent a pointed look towards Draco. "Shed a few tears and begged me to let him know when you wake up. Draco, he rushed off to the kitchens when I told him. He completely missed our first two classes."
Instead of doing as requested, Blaise plopped himself on Draco's bed. He hastily casted charms when Draco directed his glare to him. Then he floated his bag to sit alongside Draco's and patted the bed invitingly. "Come on, Draco. Sleep it off."
"Merlin, Granger," Draco snapped. His cheeks were uncomfortably warm, but Draco refused to acknowledge what he'd just done. Standing, he cleared his throat. "What are you even doing here?"
They spent the next seven months or so planning the wedding before finalizing a date for it.
horoscope?"
Draco gagged at the thought.
"Well, I'd rather have you pissed at me for the rest of your life than have to visit your grave for the rest of mine."
"Even Luna?" Harry blurted.
It physically sickened him to have to even speak to this vile excuse for a man, but Harry was more than willing to put up with these attempts to get under his skin. Because he wasn’t here for Hermione. He wasn’t here for revenge. He was here to save
"Merlin, I wish," Draco huffed. Theo didn't laugh.
Still, he ignored her completely. The sting of of Pansy's betrayal was still raw.
Draco paused, closing his eyes and pressing his lips together tightly. "Remember to what I said to you back in third year?"
"Yet, you have an adequate amount of research," Draco reminded. "Besides, you aren't entirely ridiculous in Potions. A bit slow and inexperienced, yes, but not Longbottom-bad."
Draco’s lips quirked upwards at that.
Harry couldn't even be mad for being insulted twice in a row. Remembering Draco's story of how Snape had been annoyed by his chocolate-seeking made him want to crack a smile. "Er... right."
Pansy and Theo had already been visiting the library occasionally to complete their homework or to research Draco's curse.
"You need to eat."
Even with his cheeks flushing slightly, Harry rolled his eyes. "After Buckbeak attacked him, he was complaining about it for days. It'd be weird if someone didn't pick up on it."
?" Draco asked. Then he shook himself out of it. "I have to return to the Manor. I have tutors—"
"I know, but that's not what I meant," Harry grumbled.
As consequence, they didn't get much done together.
"Draco's going to hate me," Pansy insisted. Tears welled up in her eyes as she tried to imagine that sort of dark world. "He's going to bloody tell me that he'd rather choke on Ron's stinky socks rather than spend another moment with me—"
"Yeah." Sighing, Harry patted Draco's hands twice. "Have a good nap, Draco."
Harry followed behind Dean, sizing people up to see if they were planning anything stupid. One man looked like he might— Harry makes sure to make a point by looming over him and scowling.
"Sensitive? Snape?"
The Ghostly Baron didn't budge. "No kiss goodbye to his Bianca, that Lucentio?"
Scorpius smirked.
Harry fidgeted. "Alright, fine. When it comes to a type, he is. But it's not him. I swear it, Draco."
"Draco gave that place to
"Hello then?"
There was a Lily petal the next.
And then Harry came along, professing his undying love for him in the middle of the corridors when Draco finally gained enough courage to tell him off for stalking him.
And yet.
To distract himself, Draco had confided in him concerning his plan to return to the Malfoy Manor. Harry still disagreed, but he wasn't as forceful as he'd been back then. However, his protectiveness was still overwhelming. Especially when Draco mentioned that he wanted to atone for his past choices and that he couldn't exactly care about whether he lived or not through the summer to do so.
Draco frowned, looking down to his still-full plate. "My plans for after Hogwarts include leaving for France."
"I like the sound of it but... but, you do realize that if we weren't wizards, we never would've met right?" Harry asked bitterly. He couldn't imagine a world without Draco anymore. If he could, he knew it would be a depressing and boring world.
Draco smirked. "And Weasley?"
Draco recalled. He bit his tongue trying not to say this however. He had a feeling Harry wouldn't react well.
"I thought you said he was going to accept?"
"Harry," Draco huffed. "What makes you think that I didn't want to do that?"
"Of course not!"
Harry was alive. Harry was smiling. Harry was wiping his tears away with the pads of his thumbs.
After that, Draco found himself completely and utterly speechless for the second time in his life.
She loved him unlike she should have as a pureblood.
"I see. Well, if there was an important message in any of them..."
"Harry!" she hissed, throwing a pointed glance in Draco's direction.
"It's not impossible if you simply take care of it."
"Severus and the Amorentia potion," Draco summarized. "It took a rather embarrassing amount of time for me to get my head out of my arse to see it. After that, it was just the matter of how I could tell you without embarrassing myself."
There was utter silence from Sirius, and Draco assumed he was giving Harry the 'bitch please' look. His mother did wear that very well whenever Severus claimed he did not enjoy Draco's constant pestering for chocolate frogs. Blaise did mention that Draco himself wore it well whenever Blaise claimed that he wasn't in love with Cassius. Perhaps it's a Black hereditary thing
"Of course he wouldn't immediately pull up his trousers. Perks of having a nice arse I guess," Draco muttered under his breath.
He laughed again as he let go and glanced around the kitchen, flicking his wrist to vanish the bacon bits that managed to stick to the ceiling.
Harry scowled and looked away.
At least, if it was, Draco just couldn't see it from this distance.
"Wait! Malfoy!" Harry called.
It was then that Potter bolted off of him. He held a hand out for Draco to take, but it was pointedly ignored.
The pink pig agreed.
Draco stopped and stared at him, unsure of whether Harry was pulling his leg or if he truly was an idiot. The sides of his lips curled into a small smirk that he quickly schooled.
"What?"
As it was, Harry needed to make a decision.
friends. I'm just that sick bastard all of you have to deal with. Besides, do you really think they'd want to help me? I cheered when they fell. I jeered when they didn't. I ridiculed them for their loyalty and blood. Pansy, I hated them. And they hated me. Enemies don't help each other."
Harry smiled. "Yeah sure. I'll think about it. I wouldn't know where to go afterwards though."
Draco rolled his eyes, folding his arms defiantly. "When did you become such good friends with Harry and Granger?"
"Good night, Hermione. Good night, Pansy."
"I know, I know. You struck a deal— one you won't tell me about— and you sadistically tortured her to fulfill your side of it."
He just woke up one morning in third year, and a single black flower petal was by his side.
"Merlin, Harry, don't you think he'd have liked to hear the solutions first?"
First the Dark Lord coming back, then came the slander on the Malfoy name, and then the application of more pressure. If Theo had been in his shoes, he would have combusted. But Draco hadn't. And now... well, even back then... Draco had gone ill.
"Of course," Draco replied haughtily.
They walk around the perimeter of Hogsmeade, eventually stopping near the docks they'd met at two hours before. This time, the docks were completely empty. Without really meaning to- way too caught up in each other's presence to pay attention to anything otherwise- they sit down on the grass to talk.
"Well, yeah that's why I asked," Harry said, laughing a bit awkwardly. "I mean, I'll have to get Ron and Mione to help, but they'll definitely do it."
Now happy that he had a plan, Draco looked around for Umbridge. He smiled warmly when he saw her.
Hermione hissed more sharply.
Draco watched as Harry's shadow began moving on his own accord. The shadow, which now looked like a hand, waved at him. Draco crouched down and gently touched the ground. "Shadow animation. You've done it, Harry."
Draco cocks his head to the right. "About?"
It was oddly warming to be someone that can be confided in.
The ring was not just any ring, however.
"Yes. I planned on stealing many more Snitches and watching you drown yourself in the showers because you're just that disappointed in yourself," Draco joked. Harry laughed. Draco felt the tension leave his body.
Draco shook his head. "No, Ron would not make a decent fire wielder. I suppose he does have a strong sense of justice and would gladly burn down buildings for the people he was loyal to, but... well, I suppose he wouldn't go overboard. His actions would never be equivalent to burning down an entire forest or burning people to death. Fire can be sinister. Ron, frankly, is not.
Potter had… well, in the three days that Potter avoided him, he had followed Draco's advice. He stood and sat with his back straighter now, and he appeared almost as tall as his Weasley. His walking was a bit more poised now, more calculated and considering. On top of that, his dark locks appeared healthier and neater.
is immune. They can built up a tolerance, yes, but it takes years and years of enduring the curse to do so. How long have you thought that you were 'immune', kid?"
"Morning," Draco muttered.
And if he could somehow hide his interest in Harry— especially from Harry himself— Draco would be damned if he missed the opportunity.
"He would do those things for any of his friends." Draco protested weakly. "And Chang was just being foolish. It can happen."
"It was during the first one, and he's not that bad, okay? He's just like you."
Draco looked down to his empty plate, his mind thinking back to his conversation with Sirius. "I hope so."
"Don't worry too much about it," Ginny advises. "But, make sure he says yes. I'm betting twenty galleons on this thing. You can't get a 'no', you hear me?"
"Well, I'm sorry, Draco, but we're clearly incapable of finding a solution. It's been almost three months. Christmas is coming. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to hear that Narcissa's locked you away," Pansy said sadly. Her eyes softened for a brief moment before they hardened. "If a small blow to your ego is all that it takes, I'm going to make you take it, alright? And I'm not wrong for finding help elsewhere."
. At least you have a father— even if that bastard only loves you as his heir, not as his son."
"Actually, Mother told me. She's been enamored with France ever since she was a student," Draco admitted. His delighted expression fell. "She told me that it'd one of the first place we'd visit if there was ever a chance for her to take me."
For them, Draco feared what it meant if he agreed.
Perhaps Harry could help him fill in the blanks.
"Yeah," Potter said, "apparently that happens after Regulus accepts Hyacinthe's proposal, and Hyacinthe was so happy, he kissed Regulus."
Within minutes, Pansy seemingly forgot about it. They dived into an interesting conversation about symbols on ruin guards, and then expanded it into an even more thought-provoking one about ancestral symbols that control ruin guards. It stopped all too quickly, though. Professor Vector dismissed them from class early and both of them relocated to the Slytherin Common Room. It'd be empty for the next few minutes or so since all of their elders and youngers were in class right now.
Now, as Harry anticipates the sight of Draco's arrival, he bids farewell to Hogwarts, his classmates, and his family who were oddly enthusiastic about him ditching them.
Granger looked up thoughtfully. "Alright. I'll try."
"So you approached me with the intention of tricking me into lending you a hand?"
"What? Are you having me on?"
"What are we going to do with everyone then? I mean, your mom, Pansy, Blaise, and all the others. If we have to go somewhere far away from them and people wanna, y'know..."
"Yes. They were quite lovely," Draco muttered. "With feathers as extravagant as the gold from El Dorado and names as priceless as the constellations in the midnight sky."
"A story of two men who live in poverty and wish for peace, only for one of them to brutally murder the other to save them from a much more painful fate," Blaise said.
Potter nodded gratefully. "Thanks. Sorry for lashing out just now."
She studied his facial expression for several seconds. Then, like the absolute idiot she was, she nodded. "Alright. I will leave this up to you then."
"Obviously," Draco drawled.
Snapping his head towards Draco, Harry gasped. "No. Don't go first. He did this last time and made me feel like shit. He should go first."
Potter rolled his eyes. "You wish."
Good day again!
Harry’s back was littered with scars, leaving Draco wondering why Harry was so unexpectedly kind when the world has not been kind in return.
"I see. So you would like for me to tutor him."
Harry beamed, a sight that Draco wished he could see every day for the rest of his life. But the bloke was not his.
The arrogant toe-rag had been alright with Draco ignoring his very existence up until two weeks ago. Then he'd ruined Draco's will to blend into the background of his stupid protagonist life, annoyed him to absolutely no end, and was practically beginning for Draco to hex him back into his place. Almost everywhere he went, Potter stuck out like a sore thumb and demanded attention. Before the war, Draco would have gladly stood up and given the stupid prat it just so Potter would leave him alone. But Draco couldn't bloody do that after everything he did.
"I— I can help. Get you out, I mean. If you, er, want."
That only made Hermione laugh harder. Draco grinned at the sight before turning back to Harry.
"Would you be interested in coming with me to see a Mind Healer?" Potter asked casually.
For some inexplicable reason, he found no pleasure in that. He knew he should have found some, if not a lot, but he didn't.
"Absolutely not," Draco said. Then he took a step back, facing Potter so he could physically fight the prat off if he tried to touch Draco again. Even the thought of Potter touching him had hatred brewing in his lower abdomen. "I need to get going."
"Okay." Malfoy seemed to hesitate for a moment so Harry waited to hear if he wanted to back out or not. It was entirely his choice after all, but Harry knew he'd be severely disappointed if Malfoy backed out. "You too."
— Theo!" she barked. "If you loved someone, wouldn't you know who they are?"
Goldstein smugly smirked as he went out, Draco sinking into his seat once he and Headmistress McGonagall were alone.
Potter huffed.
This was so messed up.
"Maybe? I don't know. You just came back all different and stuff so I wanted to know what was up. Kinda, I mean. Never even wanted to actually hurt you or anything."
“No… more like he’s afraid that Hermione’s going to see herself the way he sees her— beautiful, kind, and madly intelligent— and realize that she could be doing so much better than someone like him. That she would leave him without a second thought and find someone that is much more worthy of her affections. Ron said that it made him want to work harder, but…”
Draco glanced slightly at Harry, who nodded his head in encouragement. He had, after all, spent hours convincing Draco speaking to everyone during their wedding was a good idea.
"I doubt they will," Draco stated.
Harry nodded. He did as Draco instructed: he batted his eyelashes and then asked, in a rather splendid imitation of Draco: "Sev, may I have chocolate?"
"Draco caught me up to speed," he said pleasantly.
And, right before he slipped away, Draco wondered if Harry would let her.
Blaise cursed inwardly.
"We will," Draco promised. "Soon."
"Harry!" Then she seemingly noticed Malfoy, smiling awkwardly towards him. "Malfoy."
Blaise's jaw dropped. "Merlin's beard," he whispered. "Are you going to help me buy the materials too? Even if they do give you Muggle hives?"
They worked incredibly well together, and it was no surprise that their casting quickly changed the tides of the duel.
Good afternoon y'all. I'm just a teeney-tiny bit tired today since I just took my first driving instructing class. I've finally got my permit, but whoever it is that decided we should pay for driving classes ought to be questioned for his or her sanity. I've got no more cash in my wallet, but... well, I'll always got a sister who could pay stuff for me! XD
"Don't ask me that. You were the one to approach me," Potter continued carefully, as though he was trying his hardest to avoid saying 'er'.
"No, it's not that I don't like him," he said, "I just wasn't expecting him. Especially when you mentioned Blaise. He was referring to my stuffed dragon, Cepheus, which my mother had taken with her to France."
“I bet you were awfully brave, Harry,” Draco replied just as quietly. “You are an incredible professor, love.”
He knew the Ministry. He knew how long they'd been trying to get their clutches on it— Draco couldn't help but feel a bit worried. If he remembered correctly, his father had mentioned how the Dark Lord was looking forward to the Ministry uplifting Hogwarts. He'd mentioned something about how they'd use it to infiltrate the castle when Draco failed. Not when.
Their difficulties were resolved so easily, Draco almost couldn't believe it.
"May I?" Theo asked. He pointedly glanced towards a bowl of fruit, reminding Draco he had to eat something as well. He mentally cursed and gestured for him to go on ahead. He snatched a green apple with his empty hand. "Wonderful. So what do you know about runes, Harry?"
Harry knew this.
It was ridiculously romantic considering that they might be on a highly illegal— thanks to the maybe-involvement of a run-away ex-convict, Dark Lord, and torture— rescue mission. On top of that, no one had confirmed that Sirius was being tortured, but Remus had apparently confirmed that he wasn't at the safehouse in France. Harry had tried to reach his godfather through the mirror, but it seemed like Sirius didn't have his own with him.
He'd thought Potter might have thought his note was a joke or a prank and, as consequence, wanted to steer clear of the sixth floor and east wing. Actually, Draco hoped Potter had felt threatened or uneasy by the note and would gave Draco a valid excuse to not even try to talk to Potter. He technically had proof that he attempted to speak with Potter, and Professor Hayes couldn't possibly make him collaborate with a person who didn't want to be there.
Blaise smirked, leaning and resting the back of his head against the wall. "Very well then."
"I sure hope so." Harry shivered, seemingly forgetting that he was a wizard who could perform warming charms. However, Draco stepped up and casted one for him anyways. Harry murmured a quiet "thank you" before turning his attention back to the lobby of the mansion-like safe-house. Pansy watched the oddly warm scene with fascination.
That’s… blunt.
"It's okay, Draco," Pansy shushed. She ran her fingers through his hair and, even though he couldn't see it, glared at Harry over his shoulder.
"Don't tell me you're up for it, Potter. I suppose even golden boys are sensitive over their imperfections," he drawled. Then Draco smirked triumphantly as that competitive glint in Potter's eyes appeared. It's been quite a while since Draco saw that glint— picking fights with Harry had become rather difficult after he and Blaise transformed into good friends.
"My room?"
He'd obviously been particularly pissed because Draco had asked him to go to the library on a Monday, and
"Of course not," Draco replied, chuckling.
"Let her see. Maybe she'll even add a stab or two for the bloody heart attack this blithering idiot gave us!"
Potter laughed suddenly, shocking him out of cleaning up the mess.
"Gee, thanks," Harry deadpanned.
"They look like they're having a good time," Draco says off-handedly when a particularly loud round of laughter comes from his teammate's table.
They talk easily until they reach the establishment. The place is full-- as it was expected on the last day for seventh years- but they manage to get a small table for two in a far end corner. It works perfectly for Harry because the center of the room is loud and rowdy because of a big table of teenagers Harry just knew were his teammates. And although he knew that they wouldn't dare to interrupt and embarrass him, Harry still feared the prospect of humiliation in front of Draco. Merlin knows he didn't want to appear like more of a mess than he already is.
"I didn't say that," Draco retorted quietly. "I know that I matter."
"Yeah..." Potter echoed. "I think— I mean, since we're not really used to it, we should practice. We already did it once, but neither of us really knew about the scene yet so... we should probably try it again."
**Has not been fixed yet! If you would rather avoid a headache from the gender pronouns/other bullshitty stuff, please wait another day or so!**
Literally I'm so sorry about updating a day late! I've had an English essay to do as well as a whole bunch of tests so I've been up to the neck on time. Please excuse my poor chapter!
Harry let out a carefree laugh. "Sure. If it makes you feel better."
"Perhaps it's because you guys are acting strange?" Draco pointed out lamely.
“With you?”
While she didn't dare to continue questioning him, Draco got rid of the bonds around Harry's hands and feet and yanked him upwards as kindly, yet rudely as he could possibly manage. He shot a nasty glare at Ron and Hermione, who looked confused, and at Harry's other friends in the room. He also gestured towards his Slytherin friends, who were looking incredibly pleased with his display. They moved to grab the rest of those who were in the room unwillingly along with Harry. Then Draco smiled politely at Umbridge and walked out with them all in tow.
"Er..." Harry shifted uncomfortably. "Yeah."
Although Draco didn't quite know what was so important about this guest of theirs, Draco assumed that the guest must be in a much higher status than his father was within the Ministry. This was not the first time Draco went home with a guest awaiting him, but it was the first time that his mother appeared terrified of him coming in contact with this guest.
It was so exhausting, it was a relief when Draco was ushered into the reception hall they rented out two hours later. Harry met him there moments later, looking heart-wrenchingly beautiful with an emerald suit and with his hair slightly less ruffled. With his mouth open, Draco knew Harry was thinking something similar about him.
Blaise yanked his hair and the man yelled. “I told you to speak some sense. What happened?”
The wind seemed to blow in the opposite direction of the wizard, lightly brushing back the wizard's mop-like dark hair. Eyes brown and cheeks flushed, the wizard wore a charming suit. While he waved with his right hand, he fiddled with his wand in his left. Nervousness, obviously, but happy. Liberated.
Draco was vaguely impressed with all the work she did.
"Let Longbottom go, aunt Bellatrix," Draco demanded again.
It, like the Ministry of Magic, was empty.
Harry swallowed, feeling sick in the stomach once again. "I do feel guilty, and I always will. But this isn't about me. Me offering to help you isn't me trying to make myself feel better. I just want to help."
Draco could feel the last of his hesitation start to disappear right then and there. This was a society that wouldn’t judge him for beginning a relationship with Harry, and it wasn’t as though he could deny his own attraction to the pretty Viking. But, it was still too soon to act on it. He wanted—
Potter laughed, breaking the momentum they were on. "Sorry, Malfoy, but that's definitely something you would say. I mean, isn't that what you said about Dumbledore once?"
"Severus, I need to be on my way to Arithmancy."
But Draco's laughter stops his explanations.
"Mate, you are, at best, the bishop," Ron added from two tables away. Hermione nodded in agreement.
Never one to leave well enough alone, Blaise matched his pace.
Harry knew who he was in love with.
Afterwards, just as Professeor Hayes passed by them and gave them an approval-dripping nod, the two of them set up an actual time and location for their next rehearsal without arguing or awkwardness.
It was a good way to get an arrow through your belly if you walked into a trap so obviously out. Hiding behind his shield, Harry tried to look inside. The place looked abandoned, at least from this vantage point, so he took a chance and pushed the gate father open.
"Obviously not. I'm Draco," he joked, earning one of Harry's sassy, yet amused eye rolls. "But I'm not jesting. I understand it sounds odd, especially since I practically muggle-shamed Hermione and demonstrated a particular hate towards Muggles, but it's true. Can't you think of how much more simple our lives would be if we weren't wizards?"
A few strands of his dark locks draped over his eyes, making him look like a kicked Niffler. Draco's fingers itched to fix Harry's signature messy hair, but he barely restrained himself. Then, something became clear to Draco.
"I hate
Harry closed his eyes. "Dior Sauvage, chocolate, and..."
"You would if your brain wasn't so full of Quidditch and
"I'm alright," Harry assured, his eyes still looking to Voldemort's head.
Although a part of him shouted reminders that Harry was in immense pain, another part of him realized the Dark Lord was weak without a corporeal form. That part of him realized Dumbledore, if he really wanted to defeat the Dark Lord once and for all, would have to kill Harry.
Following her advice quickly, Harry stumbled over his words and his feet. In the end, all he could say to her was a small thanks for hearing him out and for telling him another piece of information about his parents.
Draco tiredly slipped under the covers without bothering to change. He knew that he would freak out in the morning, but he didn't care. Instead, he kept his eyes trained on Harry, who carefully lit a conjured candle and set it by his bedside.
"Oh." Potter shifted around uncomfortably, one of his hands raising to scratch the back of his neck and the other tucking itself into the pocket of his school robes.
and I wouldn't have to—"
"Precisely my point, Mr. Malfoy!"
"Draco orders!" Pansy quickly said. "He's the only one who can speak French."
"Yes, yes. Of course, I'll give you loads of cuddles," he reassured. "Once you're done, feel free to go to the library or anywhere else. I'll send a patronus when the food is ready."
," Draco hissed.
"No, actually I wasn't supposed to do that. You just weren't reacting to anything else that I was doing. That was really bad." Harry bit the inside of his cheek. With his eyebrows tightly knit together and tight shoulders, Harry looked sicker than Draco felt. For some reason, a part of Draco was happy that Harry had been worried.
Draco nodded.
Whatever life he was living, he knew it had to be a dream.
"I'm home!" Harry called out into the empty hallway.
Looking back, the petal was rather beautiful. His mind immediately synced it to symbolism that he's read about in books: death, hatred, and tragedy. So he was confused why a single petal would end up on his bed. And then he thought that it came from a bat orchid, but later came to the conclusion that it was a rose petal. Which only served to confuse him even more. He knew that roses were rare even in the areas where they should have grown splendidly. Pure black roses were even rarer. They could only be found in the remote areas of Tibet, and even then it'd be difficult to actually find one
"I apologize. I was lost in thought," he admitted.
"I can't help it, Harry. She said it precisely the way you do. Now, if she just had green eyes and a clearly-conspicuous pair of glasses..."
*Four chapter left :(
"My father said it served no purpose for Malfoys," Draco replied. He thought back to his father, who had more or less controlled his academic life. Knowing he wouldn't need to work with the inheritance he had from the Malfoy vault, Draco realized that perhaps his father didn't trust him with all their galleons. "I needed to take Ancient Runes in order to understand the glyphs and prophecies of my ancestors. Therefore, Arithmancy was to be my second elective."
It was then that his mother appeared on the platform, looking nothing if not disheveled. Clad in black, Draco knew that she had a reason to be late; and he knew that he forgave too easily now. His life was too short to hold multiple grudges at the same time.
He gasped for air with the aftershocks left his body, choking on air until blood started to drip out of his mouth. Draco wiped at it, but it did nothing to stoop the steady stream of bloodied flowers and the such. The petals flowed out of his esophagus at rates faster than he could gather them and, although the blood stopped leaving his lips, the number of flowers didn't. It was as if the it'd made space for the petals to tumble out easier.
He sighed. "Of course not. I was there. I'm the light of his life," Draco said, pulling a chocolate frog from his pocket and holding it out for Harry. He rolled his eyes, taking it.
"Yes."
Harry. The Valentine's party.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Yes, yes. I've heard from Pansy and Theo." Then he sighed and pursed his lips. "So, cutting right back to thick of things, what forced the Golden Boy, Weasley, and Granger to decide they needed to grace us with their presence?"
Harry's eyes snap to his. "What? No! Of course not! It's not like that-"
"Why not?" he wondered.
Harry remembered his first scar. Not the one Voldemort had given him, but the one his uncle Vernon did.
"Damn. Don't go batshit then. We need to take turns."
So… to hear Harry say that he was in love with him, previously daily tormentor and now exhausted Death Eater, was almost laughable.
"Mr. Malfoy, you gave us quite a start."
"You think they're dating?" she shrieked in-between her bouts. Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at her as if she'd grown two heads. "Merlin, Blaise is on the brink of accepting Cassius's unending number of proposals and you think that he's dating Draco? Merlin's bollocks, thanks Ron. I really needed that."
What he did know, however, is that he was crying. And he needed to stop it.
Harry thought numbly.
Pansy laughed at that. "That wasn't my concern, Harry. I mean, you do realize that she and Draco are related right? Second cousin fourth removed I believe. Of course she'll be invited! I just didn't realize you were acquainted."
Draco shrugged.
"Right. Sorry." Potter unwrapped it just as slowly as Draco had for his present, flipping the top open and picking up the ring that was inside. "A ring."
"For one, I'm a Death Eater."
Her hardest was not good enough.
Draco barely managed to set up a protective charm over him, Harry, and Sirius quickly enough, firing spells with quick succession. He barely noticed when his father began joining the duel since his father and his aunt both adapted and took turns in a civilized, pureblood way, allowing him to adapt and deal with the two of them as well. He did, however, notice Harry's and Sirius's joining in on the duel.
Fifteen minutes later, when they reach Harry's side of the family, Draco nearly loses it because everyone but Lily is in Animagi form. So, at the table, they see this adorable black puppy, a tiny brown rat, a medium-sized silver wolf, and a fat ass stag who sobs on Harry's shoulder when it sees him. Lily simply sips her wine glass and continues conversing with Narcissa, who sits in a table across from her. Hannah, Harry's younger sister, talks with the tiny brown rat like nothing is even wrong with the picture.
“Don’t worry,” Harry said as if he could read Draco’s thoughts. “I’ll give you a tour in a bit. First, I wanna get settled at home, make sure you’re comfortable there, and maybe get a real meal in you. We won’t be going on another raid for a while, so there’ll be enough time for you to see everything before then.”
"Lake, Hogsmeade, broom...?" Blaise piped up.
"A public society?"
Draco squinted at nothing in particular.
"Do you want some water?" Harry asked quietly. Draco's response was a shake of his head. "Okay. Is that person still here?" Another shake of the head. "Are you feeling better?"
"No!" Harry quickly said. His eyes were wide with alertness. There was a tiny hint of fear, which Draco didn't quite understand but decided to overlook. "No, of course not. I don't, actually. I prefer the way we are now. Y'know… arguments sometimes but talking through it."
"It wasn't fear."
Draco decided he really liked kissing Harry.
"Yes, but... well, I noticed you'd been gone longer than it takes for you to piss," Pansy said. "Thought
"As lovely was this meeting was, we have plans set for the Common Room," Pansy interrupted smoothly. She smiled softly at Draco. "We need to make sure that Draco here catches up with our curriculum."
When Draco didn't react, Theo asked, "Draco, remember that potion that I brewed for you a few weeks ago? It backfired, obviously, but with Hermione's help, I may be able to perfect it so you would never have to go through what happened again. And I know you might be thinking that I should just go to you, but I truly can't risk spilling it and ruining everything even more. I need Hermione's help."
How did she know whether or not Potter's feelings were hurt? For as far as Draco could tell, Potter have had a hard time feeling anything these past few years. His shoulders sag all the time, and his hair is even more like a dirty mop than per usual. His robes are always ruffled, like he can't help but fiddle with it now that he has no purpose in his life anymore. And his face— Draco noticed this in the very rare instances he allowed himself to glance Potter's way— was utterly drained of the caramel complexion he'd had before everything happened. He looked so pale, he reminded Draco a little bit about himself.
She didn't say 'to go home'.
This was the time to come clean. To confess and beg for forgiveness. To hope that Draco, his wonderful, beautiful, loving Draco, would understand and give him another chance. That he’d see that Harry cared beyond his petty need for revenge.
Draco wanted to see Harry fall over himself for Draco. It would never happen in real life so this class was the only chance Draco had at it.
"'Telly'? 'CDs'?" Draco wondered. Then, shaking his head, Draco said, "I'll ask Hermione if she has any of those things. We may have no idea what "Bohemian Rhapsody" is, but Hermione most likely will."
"To look at the stars," Draco brightly answered. "Harry here is completely daft and has asked me to teach him all of the constellations and the like. It was rather difficult to explain without looking at them, so we are."
"What do you think she wanted, Draco?" Harry asked innocently.
If she had, Draco was sure that neither of them could have decided what to share anyway.
Draco reveled in the silence and the loneliness Blaise's exit brought with it. He thumbed the cover of the book he brought, smiling softly as he reread the title over and over again.
Harry grit his teeth. "Of course not. And what are you going to do if Wormtail does?"
"Are you feeling alright?"
"A compliment, I suppose," Draco sneered.
"Well, the flowers do grow in your lungs."
He'd seen a red light racing towards Sirius, and he'd somehow been close enough to be able to knock Sirius aside before it hit him.
The first three days of Draco just listening to his friends' conversation passed by without the slightest hitch. Pansy had originally thought there was something wrong with him, but Draco was quick to soothe her worries by saying that he was worried about the grade he'd receive in Charms. After that, Harry just quietly led him to their table in the library and let him sit there, quietly admiring the carvings, instead of wallowing in his silence. And each time they returned, the subject was completely forgotten.
I hope you're all having a wonderful Christmas!🎄 Remember to stay safe everyone!
"What are you laughing at?" Harry asked curiously.
"So people who can use wands...?"
"'The Knight and the Dragon'," he read aloud. He closed his eyes and let himself get swept away in the memories.
"How long do you think Ron and Hermione will get their heads out of their arses?" Draco asked conversationally.
“I’m sure you did,” Draco replied almost fondly. But then he wiggled out of Harry’s embrace. “I have to help the other Viking wives cook a feast to celebrate your return.”
"So you didn't paint James' room Slytherin green and tell him a story about how snakes can bite off a lion's hind-leg to enforce Slytherin superiority?" Draco's cheeks reddened, telling Harry the answer even without him hearing the words from Draco's lips. "And you didn't tell him green was the color of American muggle money and that red was the color of a baboon's arse?"
"In the library, you nerd," Draco laughed. Montague left the Gryffindor Table and plopped himself down in the Ravenclaw table, no doubt going to cause trouble with his brother. "That's Montague for you. I can't recall a time where he didn't deliberately cause trouble."
Harry had pouted, glancing towards Dudley and wondering why he'd been pushed away from his cousin. He had only wanted to hear a nursery rhyme like all the other kids do.
"Well, it's more about the small changes of the face. We purebloods always have our heads tilted up in a way that expresses a superiority complex—" Potter snorted at this— "so our facial expressions give away most of our emotions. Mind you, these aren't loud and expressive changes. Just barely noticeable. For example, staring someone directly in the eye signifies respect or an attempt to intimidate. The difference between the two generally lies in the movement of the brows and quirking of the lips."
Draco's mouth opened to scream a warming, but Harry's ear-shattering one happened first.
Draco scowled, wondering if anyone would mind if he accidentally-on-purpose hexed his best friend. He was pretty sure the only person who would care was Pansy, but the witch was a bit too busy stirring up trouble in France at the moment. She couldn't hurt him from thousands of miles away.
“Leaving’s not an option in my book. You’re stuck with me for life,” Draco reminded. “And death,” he added as an afterthought.
He spent two weeks in complete silence in his new bedroom, the cupboard under the stairs, waiting patiently for his parents, uncle Paddy, Moony, and Wormy to come a-knocking at Privet Drive.
Another sigh. "Harry, you can't let your guard down with him. He's not even on our side for Merlin's sake. You can just tell by Lucius's face and his royal tree up his arse!"
Sirius's eyes narrowed, his irises becoming more cold and mean than Draco could've ever imagine him having. It was a look more fit for his father, not for Harry's wrongly-accused-of-mass-murder godfather. "Kid, I don't like you being 'immune' to the Cruciatus Curse."
It's not often that they graduate from Hogwarts with the same mindset and group of friends as before— perhaps due to being in completely different houses that cursed the other house.
Draco thought.
Goldstein shuddered and somehow managed to push Draco off of him from that ridiculous angle. "Can't fight me yourself, huh? That's why you gotta take a dig at my mum?"
"It was kind of cute," Harry snickered. He chewed on a well-cut piece of melon. "What about now?"
"Hmm? Oh, Cassiopeia and Cepheus are two of the most major constellations in the sky. I find them the most beautiful ones. Their main stars aren't as bright as Draco's or Sirius' ones, but they're still a delightful color."
Draco shook his head. "Go on. Ask away, Hermione."
Harry sighed. "No, I don't. It's not him."
Draco turned. He was about to order the carnivorous plant to stop when Vicky handed him a list of names. He scanned the contents, frowning slightly. "Oh. No worries. That wizard can't hurt us either. He's from Azkaban."
"Yeah, but I thought—" Theo cut himself off, his eyes fluttering shut. "I thought it might have helped better than that."
"You all slept on the same bed?" Harry asked, his voice tight. He was (sadly) the only one who didn't join the group hug. He was obviously too oblivious to get the memo.
"Oh." Draco felt his heart warm. "How considerate of you, Gryffindor."
“Thanks, Draco,” Harry muttered. He began to slowly peel his robes off and dropped them to the floor. “I don’t know what I would do without you.”
"Alright. Thank you, Malfoy."
"My notes," Granger repeated, her voice a bit louder. Draco's mouth opened and closed uselessly. Was he dreaming? Was Hermione Granger, the best friend of his arch-rival, offering to give him her notes? Her notes which helped her get better grades than him in almost all subjects? The notes which famously helped Potter and Weasel not-fail their classes? Even though they didn't even have all of the same classes? Why the
“Sorry, it’s just I’ve never been the religious type but…
"Oh, you've got it bad," George teased.
"Draco's awake. I should tell everyone," Harry replied stiffly. There was a hint of desperation in his voice. Not to tell Pansy, Blaise, Theo, Hermione, and Ron about his conscious state but... something else. Immense fear, perhaps. And is that a trickle of cold sweat Draco's seen?
"Thanks, pup. Now do you want to explain why the hell you're with a blond git?"
Potter couldn't bother him so Draco snuggled into Cepheus, his Hungarian Horntail plush, and pretended he was dead-asleep when Blaise stomped inside to drag him off to dinner. The tactic luckily worked in his favor. Blaise even closed the door as he left the room.
He flew to his feet and nearly tackled his best friend in a hug. It’s been months, maybe even a year, since Harry had seen his best friend, and Harry’s heart was delighted to see her now. “Fuck, Mione, it’s good to see you.”
Once calming down, Draco decided to not eat dinner in the Great Hall. If there was any place Potter could not enter, it would be the Slytherin Common Room. Not only because they'd tightened security after a pair of buffoons sneaked into the Commons in Second Year, but because the place would be swarmed with 'traitorous snakes,' as one of Potter's stupid lackeys once had the audacity to say to a First Year's face.
Again, they used the Slytherin Common Rooms simply because Umbridge was easier to persuade when it came to the House of most of her Inquisitorial Squad. All Draco had to do was bat his eyelashes and tell her that it would be a good way to demonstrate the Ministry's obvious superiority, especially on the day that the majority of students view as one of the most important holidays. Umbridge simply smiled and gave him the go-head to do so. Not that they would've changed the location if she'd said no.
Harry rolled his eyes, but his smile told Draco that he wasn't all too bothered by the insult. Then he took a step in the Great Hall, and Draco hastily followed after him. Students gawked and whispered as they made their way to the professors' table, but Draco didn't really care. He wasn't about to miss the front row seats to the show just because of some first-year gossiping.
, but here he was.
"I know, but that's not what I meant," Harry said.
Draco stared at the boy who sat next to him, silently remembering his haunted face when he had come back from the Triwizard Tournament with one very much dead Cedric Diggory in his arms and screamed that the Dark Lord was back. The very same boy suddenly snapped out of his daze, and a sheepish yet curious smile overwrote the haunted expression Draco had been remembering.
Draco yawned again, mindlessly agreeing. "Okay."
Draco didn't know what to say. So instead, Draco smiled and leant forwards to press a kiss to Harry's lips.
"Yeah, I was there," Potter reminisced. "I remember being really mad at you for that. Ron and Hermione were really mad at you for that too."
. "Merlin, I know all of them. I was so interested in Astrology, Mother brought a tutor in from New Zealand to teach me. Under her care, I learned almost everything I could about stars, constellations, planets, moons, and so on." He paused. "Why? Do you want me to point them all out of you?"
Potter rolled his eyes. "Whatever, Ferret Face."
But ever since he found out, Blaise finishes his homework in a blink of an eye without so much as a complaint. He reads books on his own violation. He
he could be.
Draco silently wondered.
Because he'd spent two weeks in the cold, dark manor that the Dark Lord had taken residence in, and Wormtail constantly stared at him hungrily. Surely, if Wormtail had been appointed to kill Harry and had accomplished his mission, Draco would be handed over like a consolation prize. He felt as though he was on the edge of the cliff, but when he saw Wormtail giving his mother the same glance, Draco had the frightening thought that maybe his mother was the one that Wormtail was really after.
"I understand."
"I call Draco on my team!" Blaise announced dramatically.
But, Dumbledore signalled the end of lunch then so Draco was forced to let the conversation go. He slung his bag over one arm lazily.
"And it might not work in general," Blaise agreed. "But it's the brightest shred of light we've seen in a long time, Draco. It's worth a try."
"Merlin, no. Blaise is just a friend. My feelings for him are exactly the same as my feelings for you and Theo."
Draco's heart plummeted to the ground. Blaise... didn't disagree with his other statement, which meant— "I'm one of the leads, aren't I?"
"Your father and I both saw the worst in each other first, meaning that we fell in love knowing full-well what the other was capable of being at their worst. We were prepared to love each other in spite of it," Draco elaborated.
"Whatever the cost," Draco repeated.
He was just like Harry. And he had two sides of himself: the one he shows to others and the one he shows to no one.
Draco gasped, sounding both offended and confused at the same time. It was cute.
Madam Pomfrey nodded. "Is he sleeping?"
She then paused, glancing around the silent classroom.
"And for the last point, you were clumsy enough to kiss me after letting me fix your hair."
But, to his utter surprise, she didn't try to engage in anything.
"Well that's the year that I found out about the disease and obsessed over it, Harry."
"Sorry to disappoint then. Why weren’t you there this morning?" Potter asked. "i thought passing the class was important to you. Turning up late certainly didn't show me that.”
"Why do you look so surprised then? Didn't think I'd like you?"
As per usual, his dramatic husband glared at him and mentally stabbed him in the face. Harry couldn't help but smile. "Don't you dare limit yourself."
He ignored the sad, kicked puppy eyes Potter sent in his general direction every time too.
"This prophecy," Mother had told him then, "was written long before Merlin's time. It was written in the stars, then it was etched in caves before it finally got translated to be printed in books."
No. Draco couldn't delude himself with such fantasies. He had to ask Pansy why the hell she had prepared fifteen scrolls for his wedding (while Draco was unconscious, mind you) a week ago.
With that, Draco made his way out of the Hospital Wing with wobbly legs. Pansy, Blaise, and Theo rushed out after him— Theo and Blaise pressing themselves against Draco's sides to support him. Pansy walked beside Blaise, her eyes still teary from earlier. "You should've given her a chance," Pansy said.
Though, Draco himself wasn't convinced they were harmless. So he devoted all of his time into research.
Now that his brain was catching up with the conversation, Draco felt as if they were all in on a big joke without him. "Are you all companions now?"
He was so focused on his last-minute studying, he didn't register Potter sliding into the seat beside him instead of his usual seatmate, who was now mysteriously absent.
Harry snapped his attention to the other end of the hall. He sat on a chair, raised up on a platform as though it were a throne, and watched idly as Harry crossed the distance between them.
He would have recognized his late uncle anywhere, but it took him several moments to truly,
When Draco arrived at the Manor, he wasn't expecting to see the Dark Lord in a good mood, his father in a bad one, and his mother in a melancholy one. He delivered a false report and uncovered nasty information from his father, and then he received a unrealistically heavy farewell from his mother. Draco boarded his broom with a unrestful heart and his mind spinning from what she'd told him.
"Because, although you may have gotten used to doing so, it's important for you to take care of your hair."
Draco groaned. "
in the middle of the war, terrified for not only his life, but for his looney classmate's.
Doesn't mean "manslaughter" sounded any better or anything, but it didn't change the fact that Draco had gotten rid of Voldemort. It didn't change the fact that Pansy would be mildly pissed at him for doing it either. Not because he'd gotten rid of Voldemort, but because she had to find out from various sources other than him.
"Pansy and I'll stay back," Theo added. "We'll have to be here to make sure Code Pink doesn't come snooping around for traces of you all, and if she does, we'll need to be here to steer her off."
"Mother," he greeted quietly.
Pansy glanced towards Draco, who gave her the go-ahead. "About a few days before that incident, Draco hosted his first piano recital. There were reporters everywhere, and one of the ambassadors of Spain arrived to speak with Lucius. Let's just say, Draco exposed him for his fake Louis Vuitton, his illegitimate sons, and his affair with his secretary. Nearly fifty million galleons worth of inheritance was transferred to this blond git, and the ambassador has a price on his head for it."
"So you would like for me to leave this all up to you?"
"No, I'm sorry."
Draco offered a tight smile. "I can imagine their surprise."
"He's failing," Draco said. He smiled at Harry, hoping his words were enough to reassure him. "And he'll always fail, Harry. No need to worry about me."
Blaise grinned. "Never thought you'd say that, did you?"
It was after he apparated inside the house that very same winter night without any other intention other than heating himself up in the thin blanket, which the Dursleys had given him after they realized they had to actually give him something to make the infant him stop crying at night. His uncle had been hysterical when he found Harry inside his broom closet that very morning, and he'd dragged him into his and aunt Petunia's room to whip him with a belt.
Not that he would though.
And then—
Like the idiot that he was, Potter grinned and stepped away. "Fine. See you on the Quidditch Pitch tonight."
Potter looked confused for a moment, as if he wasn't able to understand basic English anymore. Then he perked up like a puppy being fed and pulled a few sheets out that, of course, scattered.
"While you're at it, ask him what Macmillian wanted," Ron continues. When Harry sends him a look, Ron raises his hands. "Conversation starter, mate."
"Not true!" Hermione unexpectedly argued. "In fact, most of Gryffindor tolerates him. And that's saying quite a lot, Theo."
"Pfft, no. Don't jest, Harry." Draco grinned. "Besides, we were talking about how people can change what they say about you in a blink of an eye. I'm not about to stray from it."
"A simple 'yes' would be fine."
Harry laughed. “No. A man once tried to break into my house while I was out and Remus ripped his throat out. Poor mutt just gets seasick.”
"I know," Draco said. Harry was too kind and considerate to even think of meaning it. Well, he would've once upon a time. However, they shared a better relationship now. Harry wouldn't wish for him to die. And that's exactly what's going to make the end so painful. "It's alright."
Or something else.
Instead, he quietly washed the dirty dishes, dried them, and then retreated to his and Draco's room to hide inside his closet.
Even if it would destroy them in the end, it feels nice to be smothered in their appreciation and devotion.
Draco hesitantly glanced downwards, locking eyes. He took several deep breaths to stop him from falling into a rabbit hole of emotions, somehow feeling as though this was too heavy to talk about. For Merlin's sake, just yesterday Potter learned of his
"Ours," Pansy and Hermione both responded.
"It was. But I loved it. I loved sitting there under the trees and listening to my mother. I loved falling asleep under the stars and waking up to see one of the peacocks making a funny face at me. I loved playing the little violin she would bring out whenever I was feeling particularly down and she claimed she wanted to hear me— I loved being the reason why she smiled." He paused, the tips of his lips spreading into a gorgeous smile. "Everyone is beautiful when they do."
He had been motionless, unable to smile or laugh or— or be there to be the papa he'd wrote that he wanted to be.
Not a single one.
"Good luck. I'm sincerely grateful he is my godfather."
"I didn't know houses could do that," Harry admitted slowly. He continued glancing around the hallway curiously, his glasses nearly falling off before he pushed them up the bridge of his nose. "Are all wizarding houses like this?"
Draco nodded and included himself in the conversation. "It's seven, Potter. You're late already."
Draco shrugged. "Potter and I will most likely have to speak with her after class about the matter. Perhaps she'll let us off the hook."
Well, the Draco part was definitely not a bad thing. But, it was the most confusing and awkward thing Harry had ever put himself through. It felt wrong.
don't like being Harry Potter," he repeated. "People keep bothering me. They keep following me and asking me questions about the war. It's annoying, and if they're doing it because I'm, well,
All he had to do was have a single conversation with the one person who had his wand and could beat the living crap out of him with one spell. It didn't sound all too bad when Draco compared this nuisance to all the other things he was forced to do during the war. And if Draco could handle those things, he could handle a single conversation with Potter.
"You won't believe it."
"I see. Well, I thought it was an elaborate plan to hex me all at once," he said carefully. "The corridors are usually full at this time."
Harry took a seat on the edge of Draco's bed, shifting every few seconds uncomfortably. Draco would've felt bad if his thoughts weren't running a few hundred kilometers at the moment.
Draco nodded. "Did you take a look at your baby pictures? Surely you have a few embarrassing moments."
"Draco's returned."
"He'll be fine," Draco snickered. Then he stepped forwards to meet one of the goblins. "'Magical House Management' please. An anonymous dealing preferably."
And Harry hadn't even complained once when Draco had dragged him up there. No, instead, he complained about being cold. Of all things, he was worried about the
"No. No way."
"You're not going to spy," Harry repeated a bit dramatically.
"Something more civilized," he huffed in response. "I ought to hex him."
"I'm sorry. Professor Snape did what?" She took two deep breaths before continuing. "Will you please, for the love of my sanity, tell me everything from the beginning? Because you're saying Professor Snape, aka the most 'I'm-dead-inside' person known to all of wizardkind, told you Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived To Sass The Hell Out of People, was in love with you. Not that he isn't, but still.
"I told you to
Draco pressed a cool hand to his cheek. Harry leaned into it, his green eyes droopy as they met Draco's silver ones. "Taking a five minute break isn't so bad, love."
"It's also why there are so many chairs in Wizengamot. There are masters from each affinity and champions of the runes," Hermione added.
His father scooted a tiny bit closer, pressing a kiss to Scorpius' forehead. "Neither of us would lie to you. About this, at least."
And Draco had been sure of those things would occur until Ron decidedly walked into the party with the most atrocious looking robes and proceeded to get drunk out of his goddamn mind til his face was blue. Hermione was too busy chatting with one of the Ravenclaw girls— most likely about the History of Magic since they shared the class together— to even take notice. But, Draco didn't give up hope on his other ship (Pansy and Theo) until they got into an argument about whether or not she should be allowed to drink firewhiskey. That argument ended with Theo knocked-out from Pansy's vicious hexes and Pansy passed-out from the incredible amount of alcohol that she consumed.
Pansy folded her arms against her chest. "If it's an intellectual competition, Hermione and I would win of course."
"Of course you do!" his papa exclaimed.
"As I've always done."
Now, they sometimes spoke with each other and stopped each other from being annoyed with anyone who dared bother them. They were neutral enough with each other to acknowledge each other with slight nods in whichever classes they shared.
"Yes," Scorpius said firmly.
"Well, of course. It makes sense. Even before Fleamont Potter invented the Sleekeazy's Potion, the Potters were wealthy enough to own an entire army of house-elves— will you please direct us to Harry's vaults?" he added, addressing the goblin.
"At least, if Draco knew," Blaise continued, "he'll be there to keep you alive. You'll be able to keep Adrian away from him, and there will be no 'picking up of pieces' after a death. Maybe he'll return the feelings and, instead of a mini Draco with Adrian's eyes, it'll be a mini Draco with
