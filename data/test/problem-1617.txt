Harry didn’t point out that Malfoy didn’t seem sympathetic at all.
“I...ran out of aftershave,” Harry invents quickly.
Harry smiles weakly at her as she swaps his empty glass for a fresh drink, wondering if he ought to have stumbled to the loo first for a quick wank-break before ordering this round.
“There doesn’t have to be a point, we’re your best friends.” She doesn’t look ruffled at my less than friendly tone. “How long have you known?”
. The bedside table beside his own bed was strewn with his wand, his glasses and the clothes he’d been wearing before he’d changed into the pyjamas he’d been handed; the nightstand beside his neighbour’s bed however, boasted a blue ceramic jug and a tall glass.
“You two married yet?”
,” Granger presses, as she approaches his bench, “what are you--?” She breaks off abruptly, and when Draco looks around, he sees her staring, fascination clear on her face, as she heads towards the small, round pedestal in the centre of the room.
Harry’s swift inhale goes unnoticed as Malfoy’s head snaps up, gaze fiery as it meets Hermione’s. “I’m not here to participate in
did you fuck off to last night? Potter!” he snaps sharply so that the weary, virescent gaze lifts to meet the cold flints that Draco’s eyes have narrowed into. “If you think I’m going to let you treat me that way—”
“Yes, okay, be sure to mop those up,” Draco replies coldly, wanting intensely to tear sharp talons across the man’s stupid, swollen face.
Face burning, Draco scoops up his crying daughter, looking around only to gesture to Scorpius to finish his meal before stomping out and down the corridor to the main parlour where he hurriedly cradles Lyra close and speaks in a low, calming tone until she stops crying.
His yelp of shock is barely heard over Harry’s frightening snarl as he manhandles Draco off his lap and onto the bed on his front.

what the little nutter meant when it kept muttering about the Black line never dying,” Potter says thoughtfully. “Not that it’s an unusual thing for Kreacher to mutter about. Only, it felt rather sudden and completely out of context.”
) werewolf.
“James, hold on to me.”
“Yeah.” Harry licked his lips slowly, staring at the way the wet cloth clung to Malfoy’s body, imagining what it would be like to peel the material off him.
Malfoy, to Harry’s vague satisfaction, looked utterly gobsmacked. Harry held his breath, waiting for something nasty and along the lines of
from her.
“What does that mean?” Potter asks breathlessly, tripping over the leg of his chair as he joins Draco and Granger near the examination table. Draco remains silent as he undoes his robes and lies down but mostly because he’s dying to know what she meant himself. “How else is he relying on me?
“But I’ve noticed a certain reticence on your part around him lately.”
Draco flushes. “You said something about being self-conscious? Did you regularly molest Father while feeling like that?”
. He had to be mental or something.
Harry is staring down at his cock – his cock that’s hanging limp and heavy between his slightly sticky thighs. At Malfoy’s sharp tone, he looks up, gaping at him in silence until Malfoy makes another sound of vexation.
“I feel good,” Harry murmurs, nodding. “I usually do, while you’re around.”
“Why didn’t you Apparate us
“You know what,” Draco stuffs his wand back in with a pathetically trembling hand, “I don’t need this. I’m leaving. I’m fucking

this whole thi--” Harry’s increasingly feverish rant is cut short as there’s a sharp knock on the ajar door and it’s pushed open.
He cannot stop thinking about Potter. He cannot stop his mind from drifting back a week, recalling every little detail with painful clarity.
“You’ve tasted it?” Potter asks vaguely, his nose still pressed against the vial.
mouth of yours run away with you, Malfoy.” His fingers tighten around the handful of hair and Draco winces as a few strands are snapped free. “Open,” he orders calmly. Once he’s pushed the head back in, Potter smiles a slow, promising smile at him. “Lesson one,” he murmurs. “When you’re given a choice between sucking cock and bitching,
Harry, spitting out grass, tries to frown at her through his laughter. “Shut up, he’s not like that,” he says jumping to his feet and shaking more grass out of his hair. “Don’t make me regret telling you about him.”
Potter sighs. “Yes, Malfoy?” he asks with an overly patient expression.
“Yes, but I

with Potter and seeing him in joggers that sit too low on his hips and ripped jeans that cling to his rock hard arse and t-shirts that stretch too snugly across his broad chest and on one blessed occasion, in nothing but his fluffy, white towel.
Eventually, Potter became Harry, and Malfoy became Draco, and Harry couldn’t stop thinking about touching Draco; touching his hair, his face, the pearly white skin of his neck. Harry couldn’t stop imagining what it’d be like to hold him, to feel the warmth of his flesh against his own, to feel the faint vibrations of his laughter against his skin.
Ron rolls his eyes as he rounds his desk, pausing for a moment next to Harry’s to collect an additional two folders, before going and roughly dumping the whole pile into Malfoy’s arms.
“Hi,” he said shortly, plonking himself down opposite Malfoy and carefully moving the stack of books out of the way so he could see him clearly. Malfoy looked completely startled for about three seconds after which his mouth pressed into a very thin line and he pointedly looked back down at the Runes he was translating.

“Yes?”
When the water finally turns cold again and his erection stays stubbornly in place, Draco steps out with a sigh, drying his hair with a charm and towelling himself down haphazardly before donning the terry bathrobe hung on the back of the door. Then he brushes his teeth and works some hair serum into his barely damp hair, all the while imagining various scenarios in which Harry declares he’s too fat to fuck and goes to sleep in the guest room.
Harry falls asleep late, and wakes up late and opens shop late and so has to rush to get the fresh batches of ice cream out front on time. Lydia, his only employee, helps him carry out crates of fresh ingredients in from the delivery chute and talks without pause until he shoos her out to go mind shop out front. He’s just scraping out a batch of strawberry from the machine into its tub when the Floo bursts into a cloud of green and Malfoy steps out. Harry doesn’t look at him.
“Oh, but I ask for so
“Mother, kindly stop,” Malfoy mumbles, blushing slightly but letting her drag his head in so she can kiss his cheek.
in front of the baby!” Draco says hotly, pointing to his stomach. “God, you’re an idiot of elephantine proportions. The baby doesn’t know what ‘fuck’ means!”
Erickson’s eyes, a slightly eerie, pale gold, flash angrily at him. “I just asked for a colleague-to-colleague favour, Malfoy. No need to whip out the attitude. All you Veela—”
“Answer the question, Potter!” Malfoy yells. “Tell me the truth!”
“Don’t hurt him!” Harry cried, hurrying back in.
Harry’s breathing now, though barely audible, is ragged and strained, his chest heaving against Draco’s, his exhales unsteady. Just when Draco is starting to wonder if Harry is perhaps not as compos mentis as he’d earlier assumed, Harry’s arm around Draco’s waist tightens – just by a fraction.
Pretending not to notice, Draco sits down too, drawing his chair up close. “You said something just now,” he says flatly, “Alpha magic. What does that mean?”
for Malfoy just like he would for Ron or Hermione. When he’d realised a couple of years ago, after inadvertently overhearing Malfoy describe, in vivid detail, a night he’d spent with a date to Pansy (and then smashing his favourite mug), that Malfoy may just mean more to him than just a close colleague, he’d safely tucked it away well out of reach, not brave enough to ever let it be known, or even hinted at.
“Lunch, then?”
“You wish!” he says hotly at once. “You know what? Fuck you all.” He slips off the stool and starts walking away. “Move your arses, I want curry.”
Eight days he’d spent looking for the escaped werewolf who, as man, had gone by the name Trevor Markins. After he’d been bitten, given to the lack of immediate medical attention and too many full moons spent in the company of a particularly vicious pack of his kind, the wolf took over completely. Greyback had left behind quite the legacy, and while the Ministry managed to round up most of them, Trevor was one among the few particularly vicious ones still at large. And Harry had been dizzy with excitement to bring in the bastard.
“Just...so we might come up with ideas, Malfoy, don’t be such a prick,” Harry huffs indignantly.
“Couldn’t you fucking warn me?!” he yells in my face. “You lost me ten quid!”
--” he squeezes his prick under the head as Malfoy emits a garbled shout and starts to come all over his hand, “—until you fucking pass
think?”
Harry swallowed again. He could not withstand the weight of the question over and over. And it certainly was not fair on the kids.
Hermione’s eyes turn soft and warm. “And you don’t want to disappoint him?”
“You want to say that again?” Harry murmurs, voice deceptively soft, expression so frigidly minacious that Malfoy instantly fumbles for his wand.
“How dare you,” Malfoy says, voice quiet but shaking with rage. “You have absolutely no right, Potter--”
“Your baby is barely larger than a peppercorn, at this point,” she smiles, “there isn’t much to see now, but everything seems to be perfectly in order. You’ll definitely have something more discernable to see in your future scans. It’s the foetus’ heartbeat that people are usually worried about but again, everything seems fine there too, as you can hear.”
“Here.”
Harry groans into the bruise he’s sucked, immediately rutting into Malfoy’s hand, his whole body burning with sensation. “What don’t you do, Malfoy?” he remembers to ask after a second, yanking aside Malfoy’s collar some more so he can bite into the soft crook of his neck.
“You’re
He looks incredibly, effortlessly handsome and Draco, absurdly enough, suddenly feels self-conscious and unkempt. He’d thrown on his flannel pyjamas of
Draco simply stares back at him as the upbeat, cheery tune smoothly slides into a slow waltz, the music almost too sweet to bear.
“Harry!”

“Tristan!” I bellow back, covering my mouth to muffle the rather unmanly giggle that instantly escapes me.
I was, Potter! What, you thought I was
“I—this morning,” Harry lies smoothly.
“THAT’S MY NEW DESIGNER SHIRT!” Draco howled, flinging the book aside and charging at Moody, who upon realising he was being followed quickened his pace, scrambling away with the shirt firmly caught between his sharp little teeth. “GIVE IT BACK! GIVE IT
And so when Potter steps forward and covers Draco’s mouth with his, Draco flings his cigarette down and wrestles him around until he’s holding Potter pinned against the dirty wall. Potter makes a small sound of surprise but Draco doesn’t pause or slow down as he grabs Potter by the hair and kisses him with the same raw anger that’s been bubbling up inside him since he saw Potter walk into the pub.
“I can’t imagine what it must be like at that age,” said Harry, remembering what it was like at thirteen.
But Draco’s erection has already flagged and he’s already scrabbling for a towel to cover himself up with, cheeks and neck burning with embarrassment.
The enormous pot of Everlasting Ink shines serenely through the translucent, blue glass bottle, faintly shimmering and promising perdurability. The Self-Organising folder is in jet black, aged dragon hide, edged with silvery-green, the clasp a solid silver button. The flat, rectangular, velvet lined box containing three cloak-clasps, one of them pure gold and inlaid with citrines, the other two in platinum inlaid with sapphires and emeralds respectively, glimmers smugly up at Draco.
“If it’s called
!” he yells again, when their cocks slide against each other, the heads catching for a swift second.
“Haven’t you ever just fucked someone and left it at that?” Draco asks aggressively. “Or do you propose to all your one-night-stands?”
,” Draco says impatiently, snapping the lid of the box shut. “Look, I’m not trying to poison you, nor am I here to waste your time. I’m trying to help you. I will explain further, but first,
Harry is shuddering over him, one hand braced next to Draco’s shoulder, sweat beading on his forehead and trickling down his temple before plopping onto Draco’s collarbones. He’s pulling great big lungfuls of air through his teeth, hissing softly as he grasps at Draco’s hip with one hand, the other still holding Draco’s knee pressed to the bed, holding Draco open.
“Yes, and you did a pro job,” Draco says. And he’s definitely laughing quietly now.
“I dunno, I just feel like you’d know,” Harry eyes him carefully for a moment, “What would

be more careful?! Bloody bumbling son of a—” He breaks off cursing midway, lifting his injured foot to clutch at it—
“We have plans,” Draco informs him snootily.
Soft, amused laughter bubbles out of Draco before he can help it. “Why are you such an utter tit?” he asks with weary exasperation as Potter grins back. “I don’t—Let’s just go somewhere...not so fancy, Potter,” Draco says evenly, eyes on his finger as it traces the rim of his tea cup.
“It’s the same hair,” Draco says, swallowing hard. “It’s only my regular hair, Potter; I’ve just...braided it today.” Draco blushes even darker now for some reason.
while Potter is fully dressed and
That’s when he hears the Floo flare, the bell above the hearth tinkling merrily, followed by the sound of Caesar’s meow, one long, loud meow, broken with each bouncing bound of his as he, presumably, leaped out of the armchair he’d been curled up in and ran towards the visitor.
“This isn’t Lily.”
this!”
under him, squirming on his elbows and knees, working his erection against the sheets and lifting his arse high.
“Dad!”
I have no idea how long we stand there kissing except that we begin to attract a lot of protests. It’s only when someone, Parkinson I think, threatens to hit us both with Stinging Hexes, that I force myself to wrench my mouth away. I pull back and look at Draco; he’s flushed and breathing hard, eyes dark and twinkling, mouth red and already swollen. He’s pressed incredibly close, his arms tight around my neck, his champagne-scented breath puffing across my face as he stares back at me – he’s breathtaking.
?!” Potter asks, sounding genuinely incredulous. “I mean, thank god I’m allowed to touch you now. Do you know how
“Sometimes they go less fine,” Potter quips amusedly, taking another few sips of coffee. “What do you do now, then? Are you working?”
“Just so we’re clear,” Malfoy holds up a long finger, “
Hermione’s bushy hair is obscuring most of him as she crouches over his supine form, already on Healer mode. Bill and George are stood side by side, watching Hermione and – my heart does a dizzying loop-de-loop – Draco is kneeling on the other side, bent over his boyfriend, speaking into his ear, probably comforting him. Ginny and Ron break away as they see me approach.
“Good choice,” he replies with a venomous smirk. “He’s going to be in Mungo’s until next year.”
“We know, Dad.”

been a couple of cases or so in the past decade,” she narrows her eyes thoughtfully, “They’re just not bound to be very public about it, for obvious reasons. I mean, no wizard wants to—” She abruptly breaks off as there’s a low knock at the door, glancing sharply at both of them. Harry instantly looks terrified again and Ron gets to his feet, holding up both hands, eyebrows lifting in a wordless appeal for him to stay calm. “Come in,” Hermione calls out pleasantly, and then Draco Malfoy walks into the room.
, look,” Draco says impatiently, “the point is, Potter doesn’t have to live as a recluse, you know? He’s a government registered member of wizarding society. He can live a normal, healthy life as a free man – as a free werewolf, whatever. I’m willing to bet they’d even give him his job back at the DMLE – there are perks to being Harry bloody Potter, and he ought to

And now, a month and half later, he realises okay, well, wow, shit
More than five years Malfoy and he have been partners, going from barely able to stand each other at twenty-two, to whatever they are now at nearly twenty-eight. Ron is still his best friend, but at his lowest, it’s Malfoy Harry finds himself seeking out. Ron is still his favourite drinking buddy, but when he wants to avoid a Burrow full of loving, genuinely caring Weasleys, it’s Malfoy he Floos.

Draco snorts. “Yes, I’d love nothing more than to claim this
I nod again, smiling at him and hoping I don’t look deranged as I do. He smiles back. So I put my glass down again and lean in, kissing him on the mouth.

Distracted for the tiniest moment, Harry stares. Then, “Hermione made me,” he sighs. “I’m not a big fan of balls, to be honest.”
“If I hadn’t been pregnant...?”
“Potter,
“Does he feel ill or anything? ‘cause of the dementors?”
And then: “Please, Father. I... Is it really him?”
“Drinks, then? Or we could just cut the dung and go straight to mine. I’m free tonight?”
Draco calmly wipes his hands on his apron. “Yes, but I’ll make sure it tastes delicious.” Granger huffs, arms crossed, looking torn between genuine suspicion and some sort of grudging admiration. “Would you like to come in? I have a potion simmering.”
Turning to the nearest tree, Harry pulled out his cock and relieved his bladder, muttering furiously under his breath the whole time.
“Any excuse to, Potter,” Malfoy quips, wrapping long arms around his chest and wiggling even closer as the bike jerks forward. “I’ve been looking for one for years now.”

“I think I might be into blokes,” he blurts to Ron one day over lunch.

’ bob of her head.
Harry remembered the long blade of gold; he was certain he hadn’t imagined that.
Harry grinned. “Good.”
Harry didn’t get flustered. Instead, he leaned forward and brought the shirt around Malfoy’s back. “I do know.” He could feel Malfoy’s breath on his skin again. “I’m sorry.”
“Are you actually talking to yourself?”
Harry grinned back. “Well, you go through it every day. So ...” He trailed off, shrugging.
?” Harry shoots back, voice slightly hoarse. He glares up at Draco from where he’s slouched on the sofa, glasses slightly lopsided, cheeks a bit ruddy.
Potter looks like he legitimately doesn’t believe that what Draco said could be true. “But... I’m not Harry Potter anymore...? I’m not the Boy Who Lived—”
“Perfectly adequate, Malfoy,” Harry answers lightly, floorboards creaking under his feet as he slowly walks around the cramped room. “How—how long have you lived here?”
Harry swallowed. There would be time to think of her later.
Ignoring the wild cartwheel his belly does, Draco says hotly, “I’m not up to
“He didn’t do anything,” I murmur. “I’d just like an evening without Malfoy present, that’s all.”
“My feet are cold again.”
When he finally caved and let his gaze lock with Potter’s, he regretted it instantly. Potter was watching him, his gaze soft and dark, his mouth curved in a loose, terribly distracting smile that could only be described as
She blew up the door while cackling like some vengeful spirit, the red lights of her Crucios flared constantly and when the ones accompanying her finally snapped out of their shock, she was already casting a
"Yes, the kid survived, though," the Auror pointed to a bundle in a bassinet which was most probably taken there from upstairs taking into account the hour. It was really late. She walked closer to the bassinet and looked into it. A pink, pudgy baby was covered in a little blanket. He was sleeping but on his forehead there was a strange scar with the shape of a lightning.
The community only knew that Lady Dahl was sick with Dragon Pox. Since by the time they revealed it, she was indeed the only one sick. It wasn't until they moved to Umeå when they discovered their son was starting to show the symptoms of Dragon Pox too. Those were hard times.
Anyways! Hope you enjoy and thanks for reading!
He slowly raised his hand and gently patted the girl's back in case she was afraid, or about to get sick. Traveling by Floo was not pleasant after all. The girl opened her eyes and emerald locked with silver for a few seconds. Her eyes widened, and she quickly scrambled off the boy, kneeling his stomach in the process making him curl due to the pain.
Dowager Longbottom not only was displeased, she was even worried.
He looked at his Grandma barking at some man who tried to get close to him. The man looked at Neville with worship and gratitude in his eyes. That made an indescribable feeling enter Neville’s heart, the boy looked back at the man even when his Grandma dragged him to the Fireplace. Only then he noticed that everybody around them had the same sparkling eyes as they looked at him.
towards him.
"Look," he raised his sleeve to show his pale forearm and where the Dark Mark was.
So, they spent the days pitying each other and barely talking.
Bosse smiled.
Capella shuddered. Her latest lessons about Wizarding culture were about betrothals since she was at the age most respectable Pureblood families betrothed their kids. And her sister, Lyra,had asked what would happen if one was betrothed past 15-years-old. They were told only too young or too old Heirs were available. And most Heirs who were old were not the nicest of them. Her Father called them 'people unworthy of having magic'. And she had to agree with him about that.
“I didn’t sense any Magic.”
That was the Sirius he knew. Not the man having a bottle in his hand, drowning in his own pain, sulking, keeping everything to himself and broken; just how he had been feeling too. They were sometimes too predictable, too similar that he wondered why he hadn't done anything to help Sirius deal with everything before. It would have helped both, to be honest.
He thought that Voldemort would go to the Potters since Harry was born on the 31st while Neville was born on the 30th but he had no idea why he chose the second. Perhaps it was due to the fact that Neville was a Pureblood that he made him his target. After all, a half-blood like Harry wouldn't be much of a threat. Seriously, Albus sometimes wondered when Tom had started thinking of himself a Pureblood when he was a half-blood himself.
"You-Know-Who came and murdered them. We found Frank in the kitchen," he looked back to the body of ex-Auror Frank Longbottom. "There was a battle but he still lost. We found Alice upstairs in the boy's room. There was also a robe next to the body. The boy was crying and the scar was bleeding. We believe that he defeated He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named." A glint of admiration for the sleeping and oblivious baby shone in his eyes.
"I guess we'll talk about this later. I'll send Prim to take care of the library." Bosse sighed.
But she saw no one in the doorway from where she came from and neither from the front door. She was starting to realize that the place was small, maybe a cottage. She refused to believe that a nice-looking boy like Henrik was some common wizard; he had to be at least a Pureblood or a Half-blood with a good position. She looked back to the boy and noticed he was looking at the wall. She turned and came face to... paint? Portraying a woman. It was a portrait.
was simply too cruel and didn't leave much of them. The little that could be recognizable was from James and Lily, nothing left from little Harry.
"Oh my... I-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you." She stuttered all flustered because of her lack of decorum. Not only did she fall as soon as she stepped out of the Floo like some commoner, but even tackled a stranger. No matter if that stranger was a boy she assumed was her age, lack of decorum was lack of decorum for a proper girl like her, a Malfoy.
"What!" She shrieked. Henrik flinched at the volume of her voice. "You're telling me that I am in Sweden?! That I ended up in bloody Sweden through the Floo?!" She pierced Henrik with a look that demanded answers and hoping for him to tell her that it was some sort of joke. Henrik just stared back; he didn't get a thing she said, so he just slowly nodded not quite sure if that was what he was supposed to do.
Next day, they were captured by the Aurors not without giving some hell of a fight.
A blond man hurried along the drive, almost tripping in his haggard appearance, even forgetting that Apparating to the large and sumptuously decorated entrance hall of the house would have been easier than walking all the way to the doors. But he had news that would change his future and the one of his family. Whether it was good or bad news, he would leave it to the joint decision between him and his Wife.
"Grandma, why are these people looking at me?" Asked a pudgy boy while hiding behind the skirts of his grandma to avoid being looked at by the people who were also in Gringotts waiting to be attended.
"Are both...?" Her voice was low and broke in the middle.
Automatically, he started to envelope her in his magic to sooth her. Her breath hitched when she felt it but then just relaxed. She felt as if she was in her Father's arms whenever she was comforted when upset but even better. It was as if she was floating or lying on the fluffiest cloud. She felt so safe that she didn't want to move at all; instead she buried herself more into his small chest. The soft pats on her back almost lulled her to sleep but his stuttering and insecure voice took her out of the stupor.
"Anywhere," replied Sirius closing his eyes.
Narcissa's eyes widened for a fraction of second and then slowly raising her trembling hand, she gently touched his skin. The Dark Mark which was used to call her Husband and more often than not, to torture him, was not its usual inky black but a pale grey, almost fading. There was only a reason for this; the Dark Lord Voldemort was gone.
He reassured himself that he was prepared. That he was going to do fine. That the world won't crumble even if he made a few mistakes. That just how he was going to guide Borealis, Borealis was going to guide him.
"Better let her through, my boy, she may be old but she still has her wit." A man with white hair, a wrinkled face hidden behind half-moon spectacles, a long, white beard that reached his belt that was practically tucked in it, and bright orange robes came through the mass of people.
"Each kid has their own pace, Augusta. Neville can still be a magical kid even if he hasn't shown it. He has destroyed Voldemort," replied Dumbledore, a twinkle in his blue eyes. But even with his entire cheerful disposition, Augusta felt there was more to the wonderful and totally foolish story of a baby being powerful enough to vanquish a Dark Lord.
He huffed and without asking, took her hand and led her to the living room where there was a flag of Sweden, maybe like that she would know where she was.
She wanted to groan but her drilled manners told her to get herself together to apologize for her actions so she stood and looked for the person, because even she understood that he saw his Mother.
The plan was simple: capture them just in case. So they had to get in, stun the family and take them to their Lord. Something went wrong in between. The Dark Mark started to hurt just when they were about to break into the house and then it faded to a dull, really pale grey. That was all for the only woman in the group, the most loyal, to know that something was wrong and for something to click in her mind.
and just when he grabbed it, he felt a current of electricity running through his arm making him drop the book which opened and a violent wind came from it.
He couldn’t believe that a baby was offering indirect comfort; for the only thing in the house that was warm was the couch. The house and his heart were cold. Just like the night of that last day of October.
"There have been two fires in the whole country and none was that big for people to be involved or suffer damage. So there was no reason for him to be found in that state. He must have Apparated from another place. But for a baby to Apparate from far away... the magic..." Hynek trailed off. Bosse nodded.
So it has come to this, Hynek mused. The world has had some tumultuous times lately and to think that they have not ended. He sighed. There was nothing he could do. He had to do his job and knowing Bosse, he would do his no matter what. Even in mourning period. And that was just another thing he had to admire of the man. He was stubbornly determined, the perfect moralist and a charming leader.
Stay safe beauties!
Henrik sighed again and headed to the library where he was supposed to wait. Again, his curiosity and impatience led him to another adventure of some sort. He blindly walked to the Charmed books to get some light reading. He absent-mindedly picked one called
The fireplace shone minutely showing that it was open again, to family members of course. He looked back to Capella and nodded not paying attention to her widened eyes and gaping mouth.
After being smothered and scolded and smothered some more, Capella was sent to her room grumbling about the unfairness of being left without dessert and flying for a month. As if she was to be blamed about ending up in another country! Sure she used the Floo in a rush and while mad, but she didn't know that would happen. All in all, her parents were being too unfair about it and she felt she didn't need the punishment since she understood that what she did was bad, and she was scared, and she even cried!
"Uhm..." Henrik glanced at his Father who gave him a curt nod to go ahead. "A book was flying towards me and I knew it would hurt so I just sort of wished it wouldn't hurt me, and I avoided it by changing direction. Then, I just started experimenting with the magic around me and gave it instructions. Something like that." He fidgeted throughout his explanation barely making eye contact with the man.
"Maybe we should do just that." Sirius mused out loud.
She was too young to deal with all that. And being a Black was just adding a drop to her already worn state of mind. A bit more and she feared she would end up like her sister Bellatrix.
The Auror gave her a sympathetic look and led her to the kitchen where there were two bodies under white sheets. She stopped mid-step and felt her heart falter, her sight go blurry and her body sway until she felt an arm supporting her. She turned to look at the Auror and swatted his arm, her gaze falling on the two covered lumps on the floor.
"That your son is sick too." Bosse startled. Oh yeah, nobody knows that his boy died too, he thought. He sagged a bit and started to ponder.
Fates begin their course.
Sirius already sported a split lip and a bloody nose while Remus' left eye was starting to darken and swell. When Sirius kicked Remus on the stomach making the latter grunt and bend because of the pain, he was able to dislodge from the werewolf. A tiny part in his mind was scolding himself on how stupid he was to fight back a werewolf. He guessed the only reason Remus hadn't torn him to pieces was because he was his friend but with the growling coming from the man, he wasn't so sure anymore so he ran.
“When I was coming back, I sensed a strong magical fluctuation. I followed it and found a Ward; it was a powerful Ward that could put the ones from the Parliament to shame. When it fell, I found him inside. I think he created it, or more like his magic created it.” Lord Dahl mused out loud the events of the night.
His Father always tried to teach him to be patient. To wait for things to happen when they were bound to happen but it was for naught. Henrik Dahl was such a curious kid that he would always end up in some sort of magical problem. Like the time he touched a book he was not supposed to in his Father's study, and ended up glued to the ceiling for five hours, or when he ended up in the Ministry when he activated a Portkey and had to be held in the Security Office since his Father was not there.
She always thought that without her sister, her life would be incomplete.
"He's gone." He ran to his wife and hugged her. Some may call him a coward, but to Lucius Malfoy no cause was more important than his family itself. He always feared to leave his beautiful Wife alone to raise the kids.
That was when he realized the baby was cold. He ran to envelope the tiny bundle in his jacket and rubbed the little back to create friction and warm the baby. Was the ward keeping him warm and when it recognized that a person was near, it fell so whoever found him would be able to take care of the baby? Magic was able to do such a thing? It was as if it was sentient. He had read many theories about it but they were just that, theories. Well, almost everything was possible with magic, so the theory had its merits.
"Stop that." The werewolf pleaded and then sighed. "I don't know what to do about it, but I can't leave you alone because of your drinking problem. I don't know what you'll do if I leave you alone for even one hour-"
Despite being in his early twenties; his scars, the sleepless nights following the attack to the Potters, the many times he had to coax a bottle of Firewhisky out of Sirius’ hands to lead him to his room and get some proper rest, and his own grief were taking its toll on him. He was also afraid. It had been years since he last feared the full moon. He used to spend it together with his friends, running as if life was nothing. Free.
"What?" She asked wanting to confirm if what she had just heard was true.
Sorterarvägen Street is a street in a muggle neighborhood in Umeå, Sweden. But at the end of the street that is next to the river many forget how it’s called, there was a big white house with a red roof. It was the last day of October, and just like the previous nights when the temperature was starting to get colder and colder to let winter come, this night was cold too. But people still walked around or just sat at the benches by the river. All of them, muggles. Yet in this house, lived a Magical family.
"Bloody hell, Remus! That was my favorite table!" Sirius yelled when he was pinned by the werewolf. Both were panting because of the exertion as they had barely moved around the house the past days, so a bit of running made them tired.
A suuuuper long chapter for this fic... Let me remind you that this fic only had three chapters written so far and that it won't be updated soon. I hoped you enjoyed these three chapters... I will try my best to finish my other fics so I can resume this one.
She lost it.
Where was him when it all happened?
"Don't ask me. I'm half drunk and half beaten that I just want to sleep for a year." Remus snorted to Sirius’ words.
"I accidentally opened the book about storms from the Charm section." The boy said more composed and had the decency to look ashamed. By the face Bosse was sporting, it meant he wasn't supposed to go near there. The boy needed a bit of discipline but the uncommon situations brought his talent to the light.
"Hej, Henrik." The woman said with a soft voice and a soft smile. "Vem är din vän?" She blinked. Swedish sounded... different. She was learning French and Latin but hearing Swedish felt alien. Then, she heard Henrik replying his Mother and she instantly got fascinated by how he spoke. He sounded so... foreign. Ok, he
"Capella, dear, please calm down." The soothing voice of his Wife was enough to barely assuage the little girl’s anger. He glanced at Narcissa thankfully but regretted doing it as her expression was so unimpressed that he felt completely alone in that place. Having three women in the house was nothing to take lightly. And more if the three of them had Black blood in them. He cleared his throat to give himself some courage to continue with the disastrous meeting.
Bosse knew he had to see Andrea Morosini to report what Agnetha had said. Now that he knew what she meant with her words. He had hoped it wouldn’t have come to that point. It wasn't the best moment for him and he knew it. But, even when it hurt him, there were things that were more pressuring. He was at least thankful he had a few days to mourn his family. Yet when it came to his family business, then everything else was secondary, even his own feelings.
Then it clicked. The woman in the portrait was Henrik's Mother and she was... not here anymore.
For Halloween, All Hallows Eve, Samhain will never be the same.
But all that was thrown out of the huge window when he was faced with the person in front of him. The angelic face of their oldest daughter was blazing with anger. He could see how her blonde hair was starting to rise, an oppressive force like static present in the room. Lucius inwardly sighed. His daughter, Capella Lucila Malfoy was such a handful that he always cringed whenever he had to talk of such important matters with her.
For them, it was like the buzzing of several annoying mosquitoes that they, sadly, couldn’t kill.
Her eyes flickered to Theodore guessing the reason of her sister's anger was the boy present. Theodore shivered under her cold gaze; it was like facing an arctic desert with no chance of coming out alive that he just looked away. He definitely didn't like her. Lyra just smirked slightly at the intimated boy. She didn't need to be a genius to know what all the circus was about, and she just sent the same disapproving look Narcissa sported to her Father.
His friend, his first and best friend, his first and only love gone like the smoke coming from the charred wood; unrecognizable, if the fire was something to take into account. For nothing would have survived that catastrophe.
I hope you are doing well! Hang in there and enjoy the update for today! Tomorrow I will update I don't go looking for the Storm. IDGLS, in short... too lazy to write the whole title, lol I have a virtual class today in less than 2 hours. I still have to finish writing La Mia Stella's chapter, and then I will see what else I can write. I even want to start new fics or original works but I am drowning with the ones I have ongoing already! .... I'm busy, busy @.@
Lucius rubbed her back not knowing what was in her mind because he was busy with his own thoughts. There was a great sense of relief washing down his body to know that his ‘Master’ was gone, or at least he would have some time without him to completely concentrate in what was important: his family, his job and, for the time being, to avoid at all costs being thrown into Azkaban due to being a Death Eater.
"It's blocked." Lucius finally said.
Henrik still remember that incident but that didn't deter him to get his curiosity satiated when it came to magic. He has already read all the books about basic magic he was allowed to read, and it could be said that he has even memorized them. He even surprised himself when he could do magic without a wand and immediately showed his Father who spent several minutes with a gobsmacked face staring at a little orb of light coming from his hands.
"As if you have any right to say that to me! You are the pettiest man I've known my whole life, what with being a werewolf-!"
He didn’t know how long he walked, but when he looked around, he noticed he had walked a lot as he had ended up far from his house. He sighed and made his way back. It was past midnight, perhaps, so the Healers must have already taken her wife and son’s bodies to the hospital to burn.
"Then let's go after the full moon. We need to escape a bit. Enjoy our lives. Do it for them." Remus nodded at that. "And when we are ready, we can come back."
"Your tea has already gone cold." A gruff voice said from the kitchen doorway. Remus looked up and found Sirius standing there. He was nursing a half-empty bottle with what he was sure was Firewhisky in his arms, and on the verge of tears. An expression that was common on Sirius' face lately.
Next thing he knew when he opened his eyes, he was flying around the library. Or more like, he was caught in some sort of mini hurricane. Books and parchment were flying everywhere. He looked around panicked and tried to swim to the door to get out, but the wind was too strong so he ended up flailing like a chicken. Some books hit him and parchment found their way directly to his face. After minutes in the same situation he just laid there gliding the currents, enjoying the feeling of flying without a broom.
He grinned and leaped, his magic giving him the impulse to propel himself up.
The cold air hit his face and a shiver ran down his spine but it didn’t stop him from stepping out and walk down the street. The same street that was now void of people due to the cold breeze coming from the river too. His tired frame looked like some haunted spirit in the dimly illuminated street.
He knew that he had made a big mistake when he enrolled himself to ‘the cause’ but there was no way he could have said no to his Father and disappoint him in the process. Of course, he used to believe in what his Father believed. He used to look up to the great wizard his Father looked up to. It could be said that it was all an inherited respect, not something that was born from his thoughts. And that was his mistake.
"Um.. open now..." He said not sure if he said it correctly. Capella composed herself when she heard him talk. She eyed the fireplace and a sense of relief washed her body. She wasn't looking forward the trip but at least she was going back. She stepped forward and gave him a quick hug whispering a 'thank you' in his neck. She quickly separated and grabbed some Floo Powder, and then she stepped in theFireplace.
curse jeering at them from above in the sky.
His Wife was the sweetest woman he had ever met. She was a prodigy in Healing Magic that it was such an irony for her to be dying from Dragon Pox. But even with vaccinations, the illness was the cause of most of the deaths in Swedish wizards and witches. Everybody knew that it was because of the dragons that lived in the Reserve that harbored almost a hundred dragons. But as a community that respected all Magical Creatures, there was little they could do but to take precautions with vaccinations.
“I found this baby outside.” Lord Dahl’s voice reflected that he himself still couldn’t believe what was going on.
It wasn't until a hand squeezed his shoulder that he looked up to see the same devastated face he was sporting on one Remus Lupin; who at least had some self-control to not fall apart like his friend and cast an
Well, it seemed he did something wrong because she began to rant. He just stood there wondering if she had Banshee blood in her due to the volume of her voice. It was a possibility, though she was quite cute, so maybe it was a faraway ancestor. He wanted to laugh. The more she yelled, the more her hair stood as if she
"Well, it's not my fault I am the first daughter or even being born as a Malfoy. I know my duties but being involved in a betrothal is not one I want to fulfill. So, I have to make this clear, Father," Lucius winced again at the cold tone she used with that word. "I have no intentions of getting married with any man that doesn't accept me and Lyra together." She punctuated those words with a stomp.
She didn't say that last bit to her parents because that would give them the reason, that's why she just stood there to endure all the process. When she finally arrived to her room, she huffed and let herself fall gracelessly on her bed. She was tired but her mind was still replaying the events of the afternoon; especially when it came to that boy. A small smile adorned her mouth when she remembered the feeling of his magic. It felt so good. So warm.
"You're telling me you want to make this kid the beacon of Light?" The old woman asked the old man with a great amount of incredulity and disbelief.
It was the day before the full moon and Remus was restless, tired and wanting to sleep to never wake up. He didn't want to leave Sirius alone and he didn't want to be alone during the full moon. But he was unsure about the wolf, and putting Sirius in danger was not something he wanted to do. His thoughts were a mess and he wasn't sure what to do. He had no other place to stay and being near people was no option; but, thinking about going alone somewhere far, his mind numbed.
Some cried, others were consumed by anger but on that same night, in Wiltshire, on a big space of land where an elegant manor house stood surrounded by the darkness of the night, there was someone who was excited.
"Tomorrow's the full moon." Remus said in a low voice that had a hint to be mulling over what Sirius said.
Minutes later, they were sitting in Bosse's study, Henrik looking more composed and having been presented to the unknown man who was with his Father. Lorenzo Morosini was his name. Henrik didn't know why but being in the presence of this man made him want to do well and not disappoint him. He didn't usually felt like that as he would always get praised by his Father whenever he did an awesome feat with his magic; after being scolded, that is. But he felt that with this new man, he needed to do more than a few tricks.
It was a challenge from a good friend of mine, so I DO need to finish it, lol...
Neville Longbottom was left to the care of the House-elves since Dowager Longbottom had no time to take care of him and was never in the mood to even look at him. If what Albus was telling her was the truth then, it was that boy's fault that his Frank was dead. But her scorn had a new target and that was the man sitting in front of her.
Hearing her cackle every single time she kills or tortures someone, seeing the malevolent and frightening glint in her eyes that tells her that she more than enjoys what she does, was enough to convince Narcissa that her sister was a lost cause. But more than that, Bellatrix was proof enough that the Black Madness was not just some myth in the family and even showed its depth. Its insidious side.
“The baby’s a boy and he’s alright. His lungs just had some smoke in them and his eyes were a bit irritated but other than that, he’s healthy.” Hynek informed in a professional voice.
And just as if she was summoned at the mere mention of her name, another blonde girl appeared poking her little head in the room. Unlike her sister who had long, straight hair, hers was curly and shorter, reaching the middle of her back. Her eyes were the brightest blue and her face looked more lady-like instead of the mischievous one of Capella with her eyes like liquid silver. She looked like a mini Narcissa with all her poise and elegance, just with curly hair.
"Alright, I get it. Just come down!" The boy glided down and landed smoothly in front of them. His hair and clothes were ruffled and his cheeks were flushed from the excitement. "Now, tell me what happened here." Bosse said in a calm tone closing the doors of the library with a locking spell.
Then again, it was no wonder she had the job she had.
"You should air that head of yours, Albus, there is no way that child can even be magical." She said with disdain after sipping on her tea.
Henrik repeated her words in his mind trying to understand what she was saying. Fortunately, it was easy, or more like basic. He understood she was presenting herself. Her name was Capella. Her surname rang in his mind telling him it was important but he didn't know why; he saved that information to ask his Father later. The second part he didn't quite understand, ok, he didn't understand at all but after thinking hard, he caught the 'where' so he supposed she was asking where she was.
“I’ll—I’ll tell everyone.” Malfoy’s voice was a breathy whisper – Harry was stroking the inside of his wrist now, just above the bandage, and almost as if he were acting out of his own control, Malfoy turned his hand over, palm upwards, giving Harry better access.

“Not tonight, Potter,” he says, and something catches in his throat at the way Potter’s face falls. “Tonight,” says Draco, “you’re coming to mine.”
He can definitely hear something now – low thuds and dull, blunt scraping sounds. When he listens closer, he can hear a muted sort of baying, faint, animalistic moans of pain.

Harry checked to see if he could sit up; he managed it on the third attempt.

"I lost them too! We have lost Lily too! Don't think you are the only one suffering here. Don't be so self-centered to think that all the world's problems are on your shoulders! You don't even have to drink to look so petty yourself." Remus sneered.
"I like it." Lyra said getting a hum from her sister. "I want him." She said again after some minutes in basking in the feelings. Capella just smirked.
It was preposterous of them to say they knew what it felt like to lose one so dear. He had just lost his best friend, his brother in all but blood; his family. What did they know about him? What did they know about James? Nothing! They had no right to say that everything was going to be fine because it wasn’t! He had lost everything! Even his godson! Couldn’t they see that? There was nothing of his poor godson. There wasn’t a body to collect. To bury. There were just the memories to bury and they weren’t enough.
"Lyra, dear, these are Lord and Heir Nott, Theodore here is of your age." Lucius presented ignoring completely the disapproving look his Wife was giving him.
Capella pursed her lips. The woman made it sound as if she was an ignorant child that hasn't used the Floo. She just nodded since she didn't trust her mouth to say something without contempt. The woman just looked at her and nodded too, then she looked back at Henrik and told him something that made him blush and duck his head. Capella narrowed her eyes while watching the interaction.
He was still young, not even 30 years-old, with long blond hair, high cheekbones, a sharp nose and blue eyes; a handsome man to most women. So, if he so wished, he could meet another woman to conceive another Heir. Those would be the thoughts of the Noble Houses if they knew the truth about his situation. They would parade their daughters in front of him to pick like cattle. After all, who wouldn't want to be part of the Noble of Most Ancient House of Dahl?
He didn't know what he was doing. Well, he knew. He was going to the hospital but he wasn't sure why he had to be there when he was supposed to be mourning. It was just that he had the feeling that whatever was going to happen, what he was going to hear, it was meant to happen. He also had to know. His Wife would have been disappointed if he didn't ask.
In the Master bedroom of the house, the family was gathered together with the Healers. On the bed, the already lifeless body of their son was lying beside Lady Dahl who was on the brink of death. The Healers were called by Lord Dahl when he noticed that his son was not breathing anymore and it made his wife get worse due to the grief. Her breathing was labored and they were waiting for her last breath that came when the clock announced it was past 11pm.
"Ah, that sounds so much like Lyra."
"Well, you are not doing anything to help! I have lost James and Harry!" The black-haired man abruptly stood throwing the chair backwards. Remus didn't stay behind and did the same seeing the sudden motion. With the full moon close, his wolf was more unstable, reacting to the littlest show of defiance and hostility. It was with barely a little control that he wasn't growling to Sirius. Yet.
A shudder ran down her spine to the mere thought of the now Lady Lestrange. There were many words to describe her sister and deranged was the one that came often to the forefront of her mind.
He was surprised that not even seconds after they arrived at their meeting place, he was welcomed by a biting cold from a furious, cute blonde girl. She had caught his attention, totally; but even before getting the chance to say something, she stormed out of the room leaving him perplexed. Her magic was like a buzzing, tingling feeling on his skin and he rather liked that. Add to that the fresh scent of citrus from her hair and the silver eyes that barely gazed at him, made his heart beat wildly in his chest.
But he was wrong. Peter really was the Secret Keeper and that was the beginning of the end.
He knocked on the door and entered when he was told to.
After that, his Father promised to present him to a person who would be able to teach him more magic when he was a bit older.
Severus Snape couldn’t do anything but watch the destruction. It was like a vivid nightmare playing before his eyes. He didn’t want to believe but reality was a bitch and together with the screams of Sirius Black, he knew it was real. He didn't want to show his emotions like the mutt but he just couldn't suppress them. He indulged and promised himself it was going to be the last time because tears were not going to bring her back.
The senile old fool finally lost it.
He instantly developed a crush on his not-betrothed.
"Dumbledore," the young Auror squeaked.
Oh no. Henrik panicked. He knew what was coming. She dropped to her knees and started wailing. He was surprised because when crying she was even louder, but then he took pity of her and knelt in front of her to embrace her. She clung to him as if her life depended on it and he sighed. For some reason he was always the unfortunate soul that had to comfort people. Whenever he got together with kids his age to play, one would tend to end up crying and instinctively look for him even if he was far away.
Little they knew that in the shadows, there was another figure with a heart as broken as them.
“Smoke? He was lying on a bench near here…” Bosse trailed off. “There was a Ward.”
Fates intertwine.
But Augusta's expression was not the same as him. A scowl appeared on her face while she wondered why the Dark Lord had to attack her son's house. There was no way that a pair of Aurors and a baby were any threat to him. She wanted answers.
The past months were the worst of his life when the Healers found out that his Wife and son were dying from Dragon Pox, and it was under the Healers advice that hemoved away from the busy life of Stockholm so she didn’t suffer much. His son was another story, in or out of Stockholm he was going to be extremely uncomfortable during the illness until he dies. There was nothing they could do, just make them as comfortable as possible.
She regretted feeling nice about not knowing what they were saying; now she was dying to know. Soon enough, the woman disappeared from the portrait leaving a sighing boy behind.
Lord Dahl took that as cue that the baby was tired and without thinking it twice, he walked back to his house. A Healer stayed behind to wait for Bosse Dahl and inform him that everything was taken care of. The Healer expected to see a devastated man when the door opened, but he never expected to see Lord Dahl coming in with a baby in his arms.
But just that one traitor wasn't enough for him. Sirius knew that Peter wasn’t brave or skillful enough to do what was happening in front of him. No. He wanted the ones responsible for such an atrocious act. And he wouldn’t have known who did it, if it wasn’t because he got a glimpse of their figures just when they were Dissaparating.
"Lead them here." He plainly said. The House-elf just bowed and popped out.
His Father once told him that it was because of his magic. Most children had no control of their magic so it was in disarray. His magic was mostly contained and he exuded a calming feeling that children often mistaken him for an adult; though many adults didn't have the same feeling he exuded. His Father said that feeling was because he was a very powerful wizard even if he was young. Henrik accepted that reason because his Father had the same calming effect and he was powerful too.
After more experimentation with the directions and getting the hang of flying, he wanted to know if he could land. Leaning forwards as if he was riding a broom, he barely caught himself and avoided colliding head first with the floor but he managed to get to the ground. He noticed that once on the ground, he couldn't feel the wind around him even when his surroundings were in chaos.
"At least consider it." He said in a tired voice. "People already know he's the Dark Lord Vanquisher. The-Boy-Who-Lived. People need someone to believe in, someone to guide them."
Of course no muggle had any idea the house was there, they would just think it was an empty spot with overgrown grass they cannot walk in. That last detail was all thanks to the anti-muggles wards around the residence that made them turn around to walk away and forget about the 'empty' spot.
"Then, let's make a deal." She said with all the intention of the world. Her daughter, despite her age of 6 years old, was a bit skeptical. Guarded, would be the word. "If you find someone who can take both your sister and you as Wives before you turn 15, then forget about the betrothal. If not, your birthday present will be a betrothal with one of the few men without one."
“I said no!” The squeaky voice resounded in the whole room.
"Tell me exactly how you could fly back there." Said Morosini; his Swedish had an Italian hint in it.
They were staying in the Ancestral House of Black because a week after the funeral, Sirius was notified by his mother that his brother, Regulus, was missing and when she went to check on the Family Tapestry, it showed that his little brother was dead. Walburga Black, regrettably confessed to Sirius that he wasn’t officially disowned due to his Father’s, Orion Black, wish. He was simply erased from the Tapestry or burnt, just how it looked; meaning he had been Lord Black since his Father’s death.
"Cissa!" The blond man, all decorum and finesse of a Pureblood thrown out the window, yelled making her flinch in her seat.
"Augusta, we must talk," said Albus a few steps behind her. She turned around and her scowl deepened just seeing the old man. She was old but her mind was incredibly sharp. If anyone had answers then that must be Albus Dumbledore.
I have faith that one day I will have a six-pack with all the exercise I am doing while in quarantine. How about you? Have you taken up something new in your house? I am very seriously thinking on painting my room. When my Dad goes out to buy the groceries I will ask him to buy the paint if there is any store open that sells them.
What was a baby doing outside? Was this baby the one that created such Ward? That terrifying magic came from the baby? Did the baby have parents? Or more like, were they the ones who left the baby here? Or something else happened? The soot maybe had something to do with it. Why was the baby covered in soot? It was a he? Or a she? The baby was too pale to be a he, too… cute. Maybe a she. She was too pale and her lips were starting to get blue.
"What?" Remus furrowed his brows.
"Master Malfoy, sir, there's being guests in the Receiving Room, sir." The elf squeaked rubbing its hands together, nervous. He was young and new so he was prone to make mistakes.
Yet, she knew Albus wouldn’t tell her anything of it. What a waste of time, she thought. He tries to convince her of some idiotic hero ideas just to keep her ignorant of things. Well, she won’t play that game. It wasn’t worth it.
Hynek nodded while listening to that reasoning. It made sense and explained most of the diagnostic he had gotten from his check-up. The baby’s identity was still a mystery, but at least they had an idea of what happened to him.
How are you doing, lovely people?
It was shameful, but they had no desire to change their situation with what was happening. The funeral was just as dark and somber as they thought it would be. It passed in a blur, between words said by sad voices, light touches and pats and some more gestures they sincerely paid no attention to. It was too much. Support words sounded so empty, so meaningless. Reassurances that everything was going to be fine were laughable, such a tasteless joke.
Her influence in the Magical Society was not like before, so she wasn’t able to bury all those rumors about The-Boy-Who-Lived that had already spread. She even suspected there was someone behind the curtains fanning the fire of those rumors; that someone being Albus Dumbledore. She secretly gnashed her teeth and cursed the meddlesome old man for ruining a child’s life with such outrageous claims.
The new portrait Walburga Black left behind in Grimmauld Place of herself screamed her lungs out at them when they ran past her but they didn't care. Remus caught up with Sirius when they were running by the informal lounge. He threw himself to the black haired man and broke a table in the process.
The overall situation was too much for Sirius and Remus was of no help either. Or more like, both didn't know how to deal with everything that was happening around them.
It pained him to call this baby the same name of his now dead son, but he was going to be strong because now they both were alone in the world. They were the same. Bosse had nobody to take care of and the baby had nobody to take care of him. They needed each other. They needed to be for each other what each lost. For those who can't do it anymore. He was going to be strong. They were going to be fine.
Lucius didn’t need to be told twice when he was already walking out of the room followed by a worried Narcissa, the two soon arriving at the Receiving room. Lucius immediately took his wand out and began chanting. Narcissa waited for the spell to tell them where Capella had gone to. Her daughter didn't have many options to go to, she was friends with the Parkinson and Greengrass Heiresses but with her daughter being angry, Narcissa wasn't sure. She was unpredictable in that state.
"Alright. Take good care of him, Augusta." She scoffed and didn't say another word. Albus stood and left the Manor.
"Don't lie; you don't even like this house." Remus replied with no bite in his voice when his breathing went back to normal, and sighing, he moved aside.
Saying they were lost was an understatement.
It was fortunate for him the Parliament gave him some time to mourn. And as he couldn’t stand being alone in either of his houses, he went to see an old friend and told her his situation and her answer was nothing he expected to hear from her.
"Father! Father I can fly! I didn't know I could, I mean, it happened while I was being blown here and there because of the wind but then my magic came out and now I can fly!" The man had a bit of problem understanding the fast Swedish but he got the gist of what the boy said. In simple words, his magic made him fly. To say he was impressed was an understatement.
It was when he was back to Sorterarvägen Street that he noticed a strong magical fluctuation. The lights turned off in the whole street and he felt there was a powerful Ward by the river. His skin tingled with such thick and pure magic. It was a bit oppressive too, that, had he not been powerful himself, he would have dropped to his knees. He walked to where the magic was coming from and just when he was about to approach the Ward, he felt the magic enveloping him. His heart started beating really fast and for a moment he felt fear. It was an amazing and frightening feeling.
“Don’t pay attention to them,” the old lady replied glaring nastily to all those people gawking like animals at her grandson. She didn’t like it when she had to take Neville out but he showed signals of magic thus she needed to arrange his vault for it to be that of a wizard Heir and not a squib. It was always the same when they went out, people looking at Neville as if he was an attraction in the zoo.
"Something happened wherever you ended up in?" Capella opened one eye to look at the large mane of curly hair standing to the side of her bed. She extended her hand and Lyra didn't hesitate to take it to lie beside her sister. Through their link, she sent the same sensations the magic from that boy, Henrik, made her feel. Lyra clenched Capella's hand tighter and buried herself more into the sheets. "Where did you find it?" Lyra asked in a dreamy voice.
"I went to see Agnetha." Hynek's interest picked up at that. "Borealis has appeared." He relayed the message she had said. Then it clicked. Bosse had heard of a Borealis long time ago, and almost as if it was rehearsed, both their features darkened when they both reached the same conclusion. It has begun.
Augusta couldn't believe the nerve that old man had. What prophecy. What vanquisher. Thanks to that, Neville ended up an orphan and what's more, Albus wanted to make of that child someone to be worshiped when all he needed was to live a normal life. There was no need of fame, glory and all that. Just to live for those who can't.
Lucius was flabbergasted while his Wife, Narcissa, was impassively drinking her tea as if the situation developing in front of her had nothing to do with her. And she was a bit right, since she had warned her Husband that his idea was a really bad one; but as Lord Malfoy, he expected to be listened to without any sign of retaliation.
Lord Dahl thought it was lucky that he himself was not sick, as that would have meant the disappearance of the most prominent house in Magical Sweden. Not only the Parliament would be in such disarray if that would happen, though, he also didn't want to think what the rest of the Magical community would do. So, although it was Lady and Heir Dahl that were going to die, there still was one remaining family member.
"So you say, but nobody has seen it. And a prophecy is no proof of that. Many will believe that tale about destiny and an unknown power. Go feed them that but don’t come here and say this nonsense expecting me to believe it. That child has no power to vanquish nobody.” She dismissed with a wave of her hand. Albus sighed and shook his head. He knew that Augusta wouldn't believe what he had to say. She has always been... unreasonable, to say the least.
Family or not, he wanted Bellatrix's blood. He wanted her blood to run like the rivers of Ancient Babylon. He wanted to hear the screams of that useless husband of hers, together with his brother. Make her suffer slowly until she begs for him to end her miserable life and even then, he wouldn't give her the satisfaction of such an easy end. No. As a Black, he would never forgive himself if he were that soft with her. He was even willing to embrace the Black Madness if that meant enacting a just revenge.
"Lady, you cannot go further," a young Auror said stopping her strides. She threw him a nasty glare and the young man flinched back, but when she was about to make a biting comment another aged voice beat her to it.
It had been some pressuring years for both Narcissa and him. The more time it passed without them being able to have an Heir, the more the other Pureblood families were starting to whisper things. It was nerve-wrecking at first but then he learned to brush the comments aside while they lasted. After all, it was unbecoming of a Malfoy to react to such meaningless words.
Triad marriages were extremely rare but not frowned upon in the Wizarding world so he didn't worry about the matter. What he worried was the almost impossible task given by his Wife and what would mean for the Malfoy House to marry their daughters with a lowly House.
"Surely you are not acting like an adult either. Get a hold of yourself, Sirius!"
Henrik perked up with that. Amazing things with his magic? He already felt amazing with all the things he could do and most couldn't, according to his Father. Did that mean that there were things that were even more awesome? His childish curiosity picked and he found himself nodding energetically until he heard his Father clearing his throat. He blushed and dipped his head.
"Miss Capella." The woman's voice took her out of her thoughts and she felt ashamed that she had started to zone out. "My son tells me you are in a bit of a problem." Capella blinked. The woman was speaking in English to her. Granted, she had an accent but she could understand. Capella nodded and glanced at Henrik who was looking at his Mother with reverent eyes. Capella felt a bit irritated to be forgotten but continued to pay attention to the woman. "I already explained Henrik how to unblock the Fireplace. Your impromptu arrival blocked it since you are not part of the family. Once it is unblocked, just say the place where you want to go and it will take you."
Narcissa and Capella raised one of their eyebrows in the same fashion and looked at Lucius silently demanding for an explanation. Narcissa wasn't expecting any guests, she wasn't told of any arriving but she had a hunch of who they could be. Capella was just looking at the new elf in front of her. She hadn't seen it before and her mind was working at a mile to ask for it because she needed one. She was a Malfoy, and she needed her own personal elf.
Lucius watched with great interest how her daughter mulled about her Mother's words. She knew what was at stake if she accepted the deal so he approved his daughter thinking things carefully before coming to a decision. He had to accept that he hadn't thought of that option, looking for a person willing to marry two women. And it had to be a man really brave -or foolish- to marry two Malfoy women.
"They say women in Ibiza are beautiful." The grin on Sirius’ face promised nothing good that Remus laughed for the second time.
"Indeed you did," said Narcissa in a plain tone sipping at her tea that she warmed after being cooled down thanks to her daughter's rage.
"We shall." He replied offering his arm which she gladly took and both disappeared in the hallways of the large Manor.
I even forgot to send my homework yesterday, so I have to send it double today, lol...
Since when did the leader of the Light follow useless prophecies? Didn't he know that those are only fulfilled if you believed in them? Well, some are fulfilled either way but a great deal of them, however, was never known. There were thousands of prophecies in the Prophecy Hall in the Ministry, but how many of them were exactly fulfilled? Most people didn't even know there were prophecies about them! And then, this crazy old man comes and tells her that her grandson was destined to vanquish the most powerful Dark Lord of all times?
The war ended with cripples and heart breaking truths of the cries of children finding their parents no longer breathing. Children not separated by spoken alliances, lines drawn on the floor. All sharing in the same earth shattering reality that those who walked out the door that morning would never again walk back in.
