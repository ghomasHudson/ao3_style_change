Draco gets up from the table and walks over, picking up Daisy’s homework. On the paper there are numbers, letters, infinity symbols, brackets, and numbers under check marks. None of it makes any sense.
As usual, Harry falls out of the fireplace, but Pansy does not offer to help him up, already running to the door that must be Draco’s bedroom. Her heels clack against the wood floors almost as fast as Harry’s heart is beating.
To get away from the public and press, Harry and Draco had decided to live in Muggle London. No one besides their closest friends and family knows where they live. All their bills are automatically paid and any notices are held in a post office box. Anyone else who needs to contact them sends post to their workplace or, thanks to Hermione who has taught them the wonders of Muggle technology, sends them a text message. Harry doesn’t think that in the three years he has lived at the flat they have ever received a letter on their doormat.
When Harry steps out of the fireplace, brushing Floo powder off his Auror uniform, he freezes in his tracks. Draco is sleeping on the sofa, his blond head visible beneath one of Molly’s quilts that she had gifted them when they had first moved in together. On the table in front of him is an empty bottle of wine and a book is splayed upside-down on the floor - one that Draco must have been reading before he had fallen asleep. A whispered
Draco remembers George and Ron sharing a few laughs with Harry at the Burrow, but he had been too busy helping Mrs Weasley with the food.
“Well, for the way he treated us at Hogwarts. I know Ron still has a lot of objections about us living together. I couldn’t imagine how he would react with finding out that we are…together.” Harry began to feel his stomach twist and turn as he thought of what Ron would say.
“Flattery will get you nowhere, Harry. Besides, I’m not wearing Weasley’s tie for the rest of the day.”
Normally, Draco loves to sleep in when he’s not working, but late last night, he had an idea on how to make his own Weasley jumper. His plan is simple. He’ll buy a new jumper, one that’s as close to the blue colour that Harry tried to knit him, and add a simple
Hermione didn’t say anything and they both looked out the window at Ron playing with Lucky. Like Harry, Ron had a deep tan and he looked relaxed in his cargo shorts and white t-shirt. He was barefoot and when he laughed, it came deep down from his belly. The haunted looked from the war had disappeared from his eyes and all that was left was a carefree expression. Harry wondered if he would ever look like that.
“I’ll tell him. He will understand. And I promise you that we will visit you soon.” She Transfigured a postcard from a napkin and handed it to him. “Write to him. Tell him that you are going back home.”
“I love you, Harry,” Draco says, kissing him deeply. They only pull away when the smell of burnt spices sets off an alarm.
Chuckling at Draco’s enthusiasm, Harry reaches inside his jeans back pocket and pulls out a small black box.
“Good morning, Pansy,” Draco replies. “And please lower your voice. Harry finally came home last night and he’s still asleep.”
Harry’s here because he’s curious. He never thought that any magic would be passed through Vernon Dudley’s blood, as bigoted as the man was.
“Okay, I believe you. And I do want to help,” Harry says. “Most magic is harmless, especially if coming from a child. Draco and I can come over and help her, if you’d like. Or I have a friend, Hermione, who’s brilliant and knows practically everything. If anyone can help you, it’s her.”
It doesn’t take long to realise that Harry is laughing. “Oh, Draco,” Harry says, trying to breathe. “You scared me. I thought something serious had happened and the Ministry was in our living room ready to Obliviate Daisy.”
Before he can change his mind, Draco loops the tie around his neck, knotting it in place, and tucks the end in his vest. He’s seen couples wear each other’s clothing all the time, so why can’t he? Besides, Pansy is sure to notice and that’s all that matters.
Hermione rubbed soothing circles onto his back. “Harry, you need to think about this rationally. You told me that Draco has changed. Do your really think that he cares about your appearance?”
And, after that initial meeting, when he still had Harry Potter on his mind a few days later, then Draco knew that he was becoming obsessed with him yet again. It had probably never left at all and Draco had just managed to compartmentalise his emotions, but now it had returned in full force.
“It’s a basic healing spell the Aurors are taught in case they get injured and can’t seek medical help right away. Did it work?” Harry asks, holding out his hand.
“No, I’ve read your mind” Draco says, his voice cold. “The way you treated him, like he was no better than a servant, was unnatural. You never even tried to love him and instead made him feel like he was no one. All he wanted was the love and approval of his family. I thought my father was awful, but you are much worse.”
Harry takes a hard look at Dudley, who’s never been that good of an actor. His eyes are wide and his hands are clenched in fists that show off his white knuckles. His cheeks are red and he’s breathing heavily, opening and closing his mouth several times as if he’s figuring out what to say.
“My family does not have any association with Harry Potter. He’s a freak. Our lives were almost ruined because of him!”
Harry laughs. “That’s because I spilled some catnip onto the jumper as I was kitting it. I guess I didn’t get all of it out.”
Each morning, his first cup is taken whilst reading the newspaper and frowning at any article that seems out of the ordinary. His wife, Petunia, knows not to ask what’s wrong if he rips the newspaper in frustration, eyes twitching at the utter nonsense he has just read.
The flames went out in the fireplace and Draco looked up, alarmed. It was soon replaced with green flames and then two forms rushed out, tripping over the carpet, and coughing uncontrollably.
Malfoy laughs and the icy exterior he displays finally cracks. “Apparently, they are the ‘something borrowed’ Luna needed for her wedding, whatever that means. I don’t understand it, but they seemed to make her happy, so how could I say no?”
“Really?” Draco asks, grinning. “What a coincidence. I have a surprise for you too.” He pulls out a small black box and hands it to Harry. “Go on. Open it. It won’t bite.”
He really didn’t need to stay. In fact, the only reason he did was because he had enjoyed his time with Harry. Harry, who had become someone Draco could trust and whom he still had a bit of a crush on. Not that it mattered. Harry had never shown any interest in him other than friendship.
Malfoy falters in his step for only a second before he spits out, “Good for you. Regretting it already, Potter?” He sounds bored, but after spending the past few weeks with Malfoy, Harry knows that he’s great at pretending he doesn’t care.
“Funny you should say that. He grew up with a shit father and Draco thinks he’ll repeat his father’s mistakes. But I disagree,” Harry says as Draco begins laughing as the rocket soars over them in the bright blue sky. Harry turns to look at Dudley. “People change and he is living proof of that.”
“Oh, pardon me,” Draco replies. “Let me make up for my horrible behaviour.” In a matter of seconds, Draco casts several spells that clear Harry’s airways and Vanishes any trace of shampoo from his eyes. Harry doesn’t admit it out loud, but he loves when Draco uses wandless magic.
That morning, Draco had had enough and had gone to St Mungo’s for a check-up when he couldn’t stand the constant irritation. He had tried new shampoos and different potions to stop the pain, but with no success. Harry truly believes that Draco is afraid that his hair is going to fall out.
“Old habits die hard, I think,” he admits. “But if I call him that, it would certainly surprise him. He surprised me every week when we helped you with the wedding planning. He’s no longer the bully he was at Hogwarts.”
Draco closes the connection, already feeling better now that Pansy’s words have calmed him down. He dresses for warmth, choosing thick wool socks, a heavy jacket, and a scarf. After shrinking it, he tucks the blue jumper inside his coat pocket.
“I don’t know. This was on my desk when I arrived at work yesterday. Robards demanded that someone examine me just to make sure that I didn’t have any dark spells placed on me.”
She snorts. “Can you imagine if shops in Diagon Alley sold items with Harry’s face plastered on everything like the Muggle queen?” Pansy asks, holding up a gold-trimmed ceramic plate to examine it further.
“How--” Draco begins, taking a deep breath to gather his thoughts, “how do you go from hating me at Hogwarts, as you rightfully should, to inviting me to spend time with your family, to repeatedly asking me on a date? And then when I finally say yes, you show up with something so thoughtful and
Ron gives Draco a genuine smile. “Look, your NEWTs were excellent, better than any of the other applicants. Only one less than Hermione, mind you,” he says with a proud look on his face.
Draco hands the driver more than enough money to cover the ride, pushing open the door to step out. The driver’s eyes widen at seeing the note. “I don’t have change,” he says.
The pencil Daisy uses has been sharpened several times as she completes her homework, but now she is hesitant and has frequently erased her markings. She taps on the Muggle device in front of her several times, scowling and sighing every once in a while.
Harry smiles at such a harmless piece of magic. It’s something he imagines Hermione would have done as a child.
Harry’s eyes are wide and he scrambles to get his wand out of its holster. “Oh, Merlin! I’m so sorry, Draco. Are you hurt?” He moves forward, but stops when Draco shakes his head.
By the time he has finished his third cup, Vernon has already yelled on the phone for at least an hour and it’s time for his first break. He’s in a very good mood after securing a deal, so he walks down to the nearest coffee shop, which used to be a bakery, for his regular cup and a bun.
Harry takes a chance and goes to sit down next to Draco. “So I took a year off and wanted you to travel with me.”
He nodded and Ron breathed a sigh of relief. “Thanks. Hermione and I will come over this evening.” He threw the powder in the fireplace, called out his destination, and disappeared.
“No, it wasn’t that,” Harry interrupts. “Besides, anytime you were here, we seemed to get along just fine with no problems at all.”
Draco smirks. “As if I could forget.” He flicks his finger against Harry’s scar. “Does it work? Are you able to predict my future?”
“I don’t think it works like that, Harry. Doves are highly intelligent creatures and even Muggles use them in their weddings. It knew what it was doing and chose to give you the bouquet. Which reminds me, I never got to thank you properly for this wedding. You and Draco did a lovely job even if you only had a few weeks to help me plan it.”
Draco gave in and kissed Harry, who obviously had not been expecting it. Even a chaste kiss such as this was better than a heated kiss inside a nightclub. It filled Draco with a warmth that he expected he would never find anywhere else on this cold winter’s day.
Draco couldn’t help himself. He unwrapped more and more ornaments, looking at all the pieces and snapshots of Harry’s life, until he had them all spread out on the table. He was saddened at the thought that while they were on friendlier terms, Draco really didn’t know Harry as well as he thought he did.
so I think I’m allowed to do whatever I want,” Draco says, leaning against Harry with one hand pressed possessively against his chest.
The article is an in-depth interview with Lucius Malfoy who discusses every little thing about his son, from Draco’s involvement during the war to how he, Lucius, considers it a blessing in disguise that the Malfoy name would end with his son due to Draco’s deteriorating mental state. The line that sticks out to Harry the most is
a Death Eater, Draco. How many times do I have to tell you? You were cleared by the Wizengamot.” Harry reaches over and grasps his hand.
“Draco, you’re hurt,” Harry says, raising Draco’s hand for a closer look. The scratch across his knuckles is not deep or long, but judging by the look on Harry’s face, it might as well have been as serious as his Sectumsempra scar.
and have been co-workers with Rita Skeeter. Rolf didn’t invite any of his co-workers to the wedding and I heard she almost threw a fit. She would probably have an aneurysm if she saw Luna’s wedding dress.”
“Yes, but the Muggles don’t know that. All they see is a handsome young man carrying five overflowing bags of groceries in the sweltering heat. It’s a wonder I haven’t fainted already.”
“I thought he was a top notch Auror. What could have distracted him to the point that he became injured?” Draco said, crossing his arms. It felt good being a little petty. Ron’s face even turned a shade a red that clashed with his hair, something that Draco didn’t think was even possible. “Well, he should be as good as new by tomorrow, right? I mean, he did go through something like this in second year.”
Harry shrugs. “Perhaps. Now show me how to fix a bird’s broken wing.” Harry conjures a stuffed bird to which Draco folds the broken wing against the bird’s body and wraps vet tape around the wing making sure it’s secure.
Harry starts to shake his head, but then stops when he realises something. “Draco visited his father in Azkaban last weekend. He didn’t tell me about it, but I take it that it didn’t go well. He couldn’t sleep for some nights.” Harry clenches his hands into fists so hard the skin breaks. “I knew something upset him, but I didn’t want to pry. I should have been more supportive.”
Draco rubs soothing circles against Teddy’s back. “I know, Teddy. It’s not your fault at all. We’ll have a proper burial for him, okay?”
“I felt like it, so I went to St Mungo’s yesterday. They did a lot of tests and it turns out that in a couple of months, you’ll be a big brother.”
“Hermione wrote me a letter?” Draco reaches out to grab the scroll, but Ron pulls it out of his reach.
Pansy just reaches down and holds Draco’s trembling hands in hers as he continues. “Darling, that was very brave of you to stand up to your father.”
Draco didn’t have any idea on how to decorate the house. The house-elves usually decorated the Manor under the guidance of his mother. All he remembered was that icicles hung from the ceiling, ice sculptures would be at the center of the Manor’s gardens, and that underneath the tree would be a huge pile of presents that showed off his family’s wealth. Draco was more preoccupied on not disappointing his father as he mingled with the guests.
They fall to the floor, Holly hissing as she lands on her feet. She still has her claws in the jumper, sniffing at it before she begins to purr loudly.
“Julia has a degree in Chemistry. I don’t understand most of it, but I do know she’s brilliant,” Dudley says with a proud smile on his face. “She teaches me something new every day and that’s why she caught on that Daisy has m-m-magic.”
His latest mission involving a group of Aurors searching through Albania for rogue neo-Death Eaters had been one of the toughest cases yet. Whenever Harry had to cast a Patronus, he had thought of the last time he had seen Draco. Draco had pushed him against their home’s front door, alternating between kissing him and casting all the protective spells he knew to keep Harry safe and return him home.
He made it all the way to the living room before there was loud banging on the front door. He slowly approached the door, wand out in his hand, and peered through the eye hole. All he could see was green, but he did recognise the voice that said, “Open up, Draco!”
Harry’s so lost in his thoughts that he doesn’t notice Hermione asking him a question until she taps him on the shoulder. Harry looks up, hoping that he doesn’t look as confused as he feels. “I’m sorry, what?”
doesn’t make sense to him, but that only motivates him to look for something better. He doesn’t want to risk wearing it and then find out that electricity and the magic at the Burrow are an unstable combination and end up at St Mungo’s as a patient.
Harry doesn’t dare mention that he’s already felt the beginnings of an itchy scalp. “Right, that’s not a good idea. Well, we could always try to freeze them and see if they fall off. And then immediately
“They are not,” Harry says, lowering his voice when he continues, “You know perfectly well that we cast a weight lightening charm before we left Tesco. These bags are light as a feather.”
Harry smiles. “You’re right, Draco, but I’ve picked up a few tricks by marrying a Slytherin.” He pulls out a chair and sits in front of Draco’s desk. “Besides, I’ll make it worth your time. What do you say?”
“You were beautiful pregnant, Draco,” Harry says, but when Draco narrows his eyes, Harry hastily adds, “But that’s not what I see.”
Harry frowned, opening and closing his mouth as if he thought better of it. Instead, he reached across the table and took Draco’s hand in his. His fingers were callused and tanned, very different from Draco’s own, but they still sent a spark of warmth through Draco’s body.
Harry shrugs. “I may not know the answers, but you do.” He stands up and waves his wand to stack the parchment and journals neatly on the desk, before extinguishing the candles. At the door, he turns around and says, “You’re smart and you have your lucky rabbit’s foot. I think what you need is a delicious dinner, a relaxing bath, and a massage to relieve your stress. Do you agree?”
Ginny smiles at him before giving him a hug. As one of Luna’s bridesmaids, her dress is sky blue and she looks absolutely wonderful. Still, her face softens when she replies, “You were never the problem for why we didn’t work out, Harry. It was the circumstances. We just weren’t ready. We rushed into it because we thought it was how it was supposed to be. And then we broke up to find ourselves. That’s a good thing, too, or else you’d probably be an Auror instead of a wand maker and I would write for the
Draco returned to the living room with his sandwich and cup of coffee and sat down on the lumpy sofa that Harry insisted on keeping. A quick wave of his wand had a fire burning so that he wasn’t in shadows. He was dead tired, but wanted to stay awake until Harry arrived. Sighing, he reached down and plucked a random book out of the messenger bag he had brought from Montreal.
“You do it so well and she has no complaints. I bet you’ll be the best big brother anyone could ever hope for.”
For the past five minutes, Draco has felt Harry’s magical signature just outside his front door. When he peeks through the window, he sees Harry talking to himself, holding both of his hands behind his back.
“Help me? How will this, whatever it is, help me? It doesn’t feel like Felix Felicis, which I might add, is illegal for me to use,” Draco says.
“I love you too,” Draco says, right before ending the call. He knows he’s got a wide smile on his face, but he doesn’t care. He’s so happy because Harry’s coming home.
There is no use in denying it, not when he knows that this will make Harry very happy. When he nods, Harry kisses Draco, leaving him breathless.
“And you don’t need to,” Draco says. He tries to Summon the letter, flicking his wand with such force that Harry tears the letter trying to resist the spell.
Harry took several deep breaths and let them out slowly. “Fine, do you want to know what happened last night?” Harry asked.
“I know that. You know very well that I’m willing to forgive someone as long as I’ve seen they have changed.”
“I’m sure you have to know it would be stupid to ignore her recommendation,” Ron says. “So here’s your contract.” He pushes the briefcase forward and Draco opens the latch, raising the lid. How many documents are inside if the Weasleys had to use an entire briefcase?
hasn’t been this vile about me in a while and you know how people are willing to believe anything. I’m sick of it. I’m finally out of the papers and then this happens. I’m sick of all the attention.”
“I know Twilfitt and Tattings is already closed for the holidays and Madam Malkins only sells Hogwarts uniforms and robes, so we’ll have to shop in Muggle London. Let’s get a taxi.”
Draco takes off his coat and pokes his wand in the fireplace to light it. It doesn’t even come close to warming him. He desperately needs a hot shower. With a wave of his wand, he sends his shopping bags to the kitchen and makes his way to Harry’s bathroom.
Harry tightens his hold on Draco and kisses the top of his head. “I promise. Now got to sleep, Draco. I love you.”
Perhaps it was time to leave. Draco had already finished restoring and cataloging all of the books in the library. He had a list of books that Harry could donate if he wished to do so, and the few books that he could not salvage would be sent to the Ministry for further inspection.
the paper. “That’s rubbish. Make them print out a retraction. Or an apology though I doubt you’ll get that. I’m surprised Ron didn’t say anything yesterday when dropping you off. What about the other Weasleys? Or Nick? What does he think about this?”
“I thought it was you,” Draco replies, reaching for his wand on the nightstand. A second scream rips through the silent house.
newly single. It seems that all the single guests in attendance are invited to somehow catch the bouquet of sunflowers to see who the next one to marry is. Personally, my money is on Blaise. That is, if he ever decides to settle down.”
“Absolutely barking,” she replies, laughing softly. “But I can see why Harry loves you. You make life very interesting and I bet there’s never a dull moment,” Daisy says as she picks up her phone and dials a number.
“Yuck, no! Wait, don’t open your eyes yet!” Teddy exclaims. “I bet it’s something you’ve never seen before.”
Draco opened his mouth to protest that he was simply curious about the films, but Harry cut him off.
Relief washes over Harry as he closes the distance between them and kisses him, kisses away the tears that finally spill. The box falls to the floor, ignored for the moment as they both become lost in their own world. To Harry, nothing says home more than being in the arms of someone he loves and he will stop at nothing to make sure Draco feels the same.
?” she shrieks as loud as a Howler. The effect is immediate and everyone in the Great Hall stops their chatter and looks over at them.
“A little trouble out on a raid, but everything’s fine now,” Ron answered and he bent down to help Harry stand up. “What are you doing here? Weren’t you in Montreal?”
“Harry, you have to promise me that I talk to him first. I don’t want him to be overwhelmed when you barge in with your Gryffindor foolishness that only causes him to say or do something he regrets.”
“They’ll make the finals this year for sure! And then you’ll regret not supporting them, Malfoy,” Ron says, almost upsetting the slice of birthday cake he holds in one hand.
Hermione doesn’t immediately answer, too busy trying to hold her infant daughter without waking her. Rose Weasley is only ten months old and had spent most of Luna’s wedding being passed around to their family and friends. By the end of the evening, just as couples were starting to dance, she had fallen fast asleep.
They follow Amy to a table tucked away in the corner of the shop filled with different coloured jumpers. “This is our ugly Christmas jumper collection,” Amy says, “They’re popular with uni students.”
Harry can’t help it. He laughs and whatever tension he has coiled up inside lessens as he manages to say, “The Howler did not say that!”
The funny thing was that were he not infamous, this would not have made the newspaper, much less the front page. It was tabloid fodder and must have been the result of a desperate reporter on a slow news day. This particular photo had been taken three days ago when he was still in Montreal.
The whole affair should not take any more than fifteen minutes. Today, however, the queue is held up by a blond man who is taking far too long to choose a cup of coffee.
Draco gently strokes Teddy’s hair, the colour changing to brown as it does when he’s upset. “Teddy, sweetheart, I’m sorry you had to find out this way, but Mr Finny is dead,” Draco begins.
“If you remember how terrible I was in potions, then you’ll know that I’m not that familiar with potions herbs and plants,” Harry says, laughing softly. “However, Neville recommended some useful ones and even left the roots attached so that you could grow your own at home, if you choose to. I know you recognise aconite, sage, yarrow, mint, thyme, feverfew, and well, dittany,” Harry says, pointing to each one as he names them.
written underneath in white letters. Next to it, there’s a green jumper with a red stocking on the front that has a wine bottle tucked inside. The last mannequin wears a simple purple jumper with sequin letters that asks
“Well, we asked her not to knit any jumpers or cook this year because she’s been sick and doesn’t need that additional stress whilst she’s recovering. Instead, all her children and their families are bringing a dish for dinner tomorrow and wearing their favourite jumper to cheer her up.”
Pansy shakes her head. “I arrived yesterday from Paris, but I haven’t seen Draco since our brunch last Wednesday.”
“But you’re a wizard! Harry says you’re so smart and got high marks at school. I thought you knew everything.”
With those words, Malfoy turns around and heads back to the front of the crowd, stopping next to Blaise Zabini. Zabini asks Malfoy a question, but Malfoy only shakes his head once.
“No,” Harry says quickly. “At this point, I don’t even know if I have a chance. It seems that I’ve fucked up all the relationships I’ve ever had.”
Draco stood still. He had half a mind to just ignore Ron, but he was curious to see what really happened to Harry. “What?”
And so Harry did. He told her every little thing about Draco even if it seemed inconsequential. How Draco had been trying to change his views on things his father had instilled in him as a child. How he was apologising to the people that he hurt when he was younger. The way Draco had learned to cook without magic even if the meals never came out perfect. The way he treated Teddy despite who his parents were. How most of their conversations seemed to be just saying things that were on their minds and that it never got boring even if they stayed up all night. How happy it made him to see Draco’s smile and be there to comfort one another whenever they had nightmares.
Harry feels his heart beat faster now that Malfoy is actually responding to his words instead of telling him to leave. “Yes. I regret the way I broke up with him, but not the reason why I did it.”
As if she understood Draco’s words and is determined to prove them wrong, Noel jumps from the table and onto Harry’s lap, sending the bags of takeaway to the floor. Draco rescues them before they crash, and sends them to the kitchen with a flick of his wand.
Draco let out a sigh of relief. If Harry was coherent enough to insist that he was fine, then the raid must not have been too horrible and he could stop imagining all the ways Harry had been hurt. “Do you need anything? If you give me the list, I can brew some potions.”
Harry tries, and fails, to suppress a smile. “Then one dose should do the trick. Draco, you’re practically hairless.” Harry stops his teasing when he finally notices Draco frowning at him.
’d a book from his messenger bag and handed it to Harry, his fingers trembling a little as he waited for Harry’s reaction.
on the tip of his tongue, then thought better of it. Harry had insisted on teaching him surveillance spells if Draco ever thought something was wrong.
“We should find one for you, Pansy.” Draco reaches for a black jumper, Pansy’s preferred colour for clothes because it coordinates with everything. On the front is a fluffy, white sheep with fairy lights wrapped around the body. The phrase
“For good reason,” Draco said. His shoulders sagged as if a great deal of weight had slipped off and he knew that all the missed sleep was starting to catch up to him. “Perhaps the Healers should have done a more thorough head examination. They must have missed something if you are saying those things right now.”
They spent the afternoon decorating Grimmauld Place, arranging the baubles and figurines in strategic positions that only Harry could make sense of. The place soon buzzed with Celestina Warbeck singing and the two of them sipping hot cocoa with far too many marshmallows.
Another dolphin Patronus darts into the room, interrupting Draco’s thoughts, but he Silences it before it can speak. He doesn’t want to leave the warm bed, but Pansy can be a right terror if she thinks Draco is ignoring her. And although he wants nothing more than to share his secret, he misses her, too. So he settles for kissing Harry one last time before slipping out of bed and casting an
As soon as Harry had finished providing an extensive verbal report, along with Pensive memories, and had gotten clearance by the Healers, Harry had requested a meeting with Kingsley Shacklebolt. The meeting had only lasted long enough to have his request approved, before Harry had Apparated home straight into his bathroom, determined to wash away everything.
The blond man slowly turns around and he's nothing like Vernon has ever seen before. Vernon understands why the barista was flirting with this man, someone who is handsome enough to charm all the people around him. The blond man’s pale eyebrow is arched into a precise point judging him, his pale pink lips are smirking at him, and his grey eyes are wide in amusement. His dark blue suit screams money, and power, and high society. Vernon won’t admit it, but he feels inadequate standing next to this man.
“I was looking for some clothes to change into after my shower. I found this hanging at the back and Holly followed me in and immediately jumped on it. When I tried to take it back, she ran off,” Draco says.
“Draco, I’ve missed you,” Harry says, kissing him. Draco melts into the kiss, feeling all the tension and frustration leave his body. When Harry pulls back, his green eyes are full of concern as he gazes at Draco. “What’s wrong, Draco?”
Pansy nods. “I would never wear one in its original state, but there’s nothing a good charm can’t fix. However, I don’t understand, why would you dress your child as an animal?”
They look the same since their Hogwarts days, especially their red hair, but now their clothes are no longer second-hand and they have an air of confidence that only comes with being successful and having the world in their hands.
“We’ll be right with you in a moment!” A weary voice calls out from behind the counter. Draco doubts it, and decides to browse around the shop for a bit before asking for help.
After all, as far as Draco knew, Harry had never told his friends or the Weasleys about what he did every Saturday.
Pansy’s fingers dig into Harry’s arms as they step into the fireplace. Harry’s not sure which is worse, the
Harry breaks their kiss. “As lovely as this is, I actually did bring you over here to give you a gift.”
“Fine, but you have to Vanish any sick up I might have,” she says, her face turning slightly green. Draco nods, hoping she doesn’t get sick.
She looks at him in confusion. “Why not? I’m sure you’ll find something there, even if it’s not as soft as unicorn hair.”
Harry snorts. “My fans? Or just one fan in particular? Let’s face it, Draco, you’re a Harry Potter fanboy.”
Instead of asking him, however, Harry had leaned in and kissed him. For the briefest of seconds, Harry had completely forgotten about Charlie and had instead thought of how soft Malfoy’s lips were. He had immediately been pushed back and the only words Malfoy had said were, “I don’t date taken men, Harry. Not even you.”
Harry doesn’t stop at the Gryffindor table like Draco expects him to. Instead, he walks over to where Draco is, sitting down and looking as comfortable as if he were sitting with his friends.
to date you and we all know he doesn’t care what anyone thinks. He knows you’re not the same person from Hogwarts.”
The living room is minimalistic except for the giant Christmas tree in the corner. Harry had gone on assignment before he could finish decorating and Draco worked long hours at St Mungo’s that rarely left him enough energy to do anything other than to eat and sleep.
“Who brings a Niffler to a wedding?” Harry says, continuing to stare at the baby Niffler until it leaps from the suitcase. It lands on Harry’s jacket, tugging on the gold dusted sunflower in his front pocket. Both the flower and Niffler fall to the ground and it only takes a second before the Niffler is on its tiny feet running out the door.
“I would be stupid to pass up this opportunity,” Draco replies, picking up a quill and signing his name on the contract.
“I doubt it, Draco, if those are the best ones that the owner chose to display for a sale.” However, she still follows him inside, muttering something about being a lovesick fool.
There was silence in the room and Draco had a feeling that Harry was trying to figure out a way to get out of this conversation. He just continued to eat, ignoring Draco, who finally had enough of Harry’s evasiveness.
Ignoring Draco’s outstretched hand, George grabs a brownie and bites into it with a groan. “I’m starving! Sit down, Malfoy, we don’t have to go straight to business.”
“I’m sure you can,” Draco agrees. “However, I have an early Portkey to Paris tomorrow and the Weasleys are expecting you at the Burrow if they haven’t already figured out that you’ve returned.”
Draco smiles. “It does too. It’s a shame that not even a single Gryffindor thought of that first. Besides, Rose looked so happy with all of the eggs. You can’t blame me.”
s the cat treats, but they pay no attention to him as they purr louder and roll around on the jumper. He shakes the tin and the cats stop, but don’t move out of his way. Draco waits patiently, with a treat in his hand, and it’s not long before Noel sticks her head out from underneath the tree.
?” Draco laughs. “For what crime? There are two main reasons you get an Improper Use of Magic letter. One is for underage magic. I’m clearly not underage, thank Merlin, and I haven’t done any improper magic.”
’d. There was none. A little bit of panic began to set in. Draco had half a mind to Firecall Ron no matter that it was still early and he was probably still asleep.
The dining room and kitchen were also empty and Draco used his wand to see if there was any note that could be
Harry was tracing the words on the page, but he did look up in order to say, “Thank you, Draco. This is possibly one of the best presents I’ve ever received.” Even in the dim light, Draco could see the tears threatening to fall down his cheeks.
“He lives with you and I know that you wouldn’t agree to go out with someone unless you knew them really well and trusted them. Draco is the only person I know who fits that criteria.”
“Luna appointed him as the wedding planner and he was corralling his family’s albino peacocks into a pen. Since I was Malfoy’s assistant, I was helping him out.”
Draco knocks the crystal ball out of Harry’s hand and pushes him down on the grass, kissing him over and over again, his hands tangling in Harry’s hair. When they break away, Draco’s cheeks are flushed, but he’s smiling so wide, showing off the wrinkles around his eyes and lips, wrinkles that Harry will never dare mention. But it makes him happy, knowing that Draco is happy with him.
Draco smiles. “I Vanished the question. You can’t get a wrong answer if the question is never there to begin with.”
Draco shakes his head. “Not yet. Let me properly assess it.” Normally, Draco would have worn latex gloves and examined the creature on the table, casting diagnostic spells with his wand if Muggles weren’t around. Instead, his long fingers traces the thing. He doesn’t know what else to call it, but it’s about two and half inches long, furry, and with slight claws protruding on the end.
“Yes. You won’t be at peace until you do.” As soon as she said those words, Harry knew that she was right. He needed to go home before it drove him crazy thinking about it.
Draco nods. He remembers seeing the Weasley children return from Christmas break wearing different coloured jumpers, sometimes with their initials, every single year.
“How? I still see that you have two eyes, messy hair, and your skin is darker from the sun, but that will fade. The most important thing about you hasn’t changed, right? I meant your personality, not your cock, so take your mind off of that for a moment. I don’t see what’s different.”
Draco should have been embarrassed that Harry had taken notice of what he had thought had been discrete outings, but he was distracted by the hurtful reaction he felt hearing Harry say those words.
Draco didn’t even hesitate before saying yes. “I’d like that. I know Mother always wanted to reconnect with her sister and this would be a perfect way to start. Only if it’s alright with you.”
“As fascinating as this conversation is, it seems that Potter’s presence is now required for the bouquet toss.”
jobs!” He slides his card in the machine, signing the screen aggressively. When he turns around to wait for his order, he sees Draco staring at him with a calculated look.
“Prat,” Draco says, rolling his eyes. He takes Harry’s tie and quickly ties it in a proper knot, grateful that he can’t hear anyone’s reaction except for his boyfriend’s.
Harry took a deep breath and let it out slowly. This was going to be one of the most interesting and hardest conversations he ever had with Hermione. Harry decided he was going to tell her about Draco in the vaguest terms possible.
This interview is not going the way Draco had planned. To be honest, he didn’t know what to expect from them and that’s why he had prepared several speeches depending on what mood they arrived with. He sits down while the Weasleys prepare tea. Harry reaches underneath the table and squeezes Draco’s hand.
Dudley takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. “For being horrible to you when we were kids. I was imitating my father, but that’s no excuse. It wasn’t until after you left for the final time, that I noticed how terrible he was as a person. He was bitter, angry, and didn’t even change when Mum divorced him. He died alone because he pushed everyone away. I don’t want to end up that way, so I tried finding you. But you are very difficult to find.”
“I know that, but I’ve already lost my mother. And even though my father has done terrible things, it still stung when he disowned me when I wouldn’t agree to marry the woman he chose for me.”
“You’re welcome,” Harry says, holding out his hand for Dudley to shake, but Dudley surprises him by enveloping him in a hug. When they break apart, Dudley is smiling.
“You don’t need to thank us, Luna. We’re happy to help you celebrate your special day. Malfoy did most of it, really. He said he couldn’t trust me to handle something as important as your wedding.”
Malfoy squeezes Harry’s hand before saying, “Be warned, Potter, don’t you dare break up with me like that.”
Draco frowns. “Kreacher? Yes, he’s still alive, but he alternates between living at Hogwarts and Grimmauld Place. I don’t think I’ve actually seen him since September. Why?”
As much had he had enjoyed it in the moment, he had regretted it ever since. It made him sick and uneasy that he could twist’s Harry’s friendship for his own personal use. His disgust only grew when he read the
“It aches a little if I twist it the wrong way, but otherwise its fully healed.” Harry flexed his arm and grinned when Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco avoids Harry’s gaze and wraps an arm around Harry’s waist, pulling him close. “I’m Harry’s boyfriend and I was just trying to learn more about his family. He’s told me so much about you,” Draco says with a tight smile that does not reach his eyes.
is the brightest witch of our age and the future Minister for Magic. But she doesn’t know I’m here. It’s your back luck that no one knows I’m here.”
“I don’t care if she’s a witch! She’s my child and I love her. I’m not going to treat her like my father treated you when we learned you were a wizard. I just want her to be safe.”
?” Draco says, turning away when Harry attempts to kiss him. “I’m sure you would enjoy that so much more.” Draco steps out of the shower, casting drying charms and heating spells before slamming the bathroom door shut.
Before Draco can answer, a shop assistant named Amy comes up and asks, “How may I help you?” She looks old enough to be his mother, but has lines around her eyes and mouth that Narcissa would never allow. She beams at the outfit he holds in his hand. “Wonderful choice! My cat Cleo loves her reindeer outfit.”
“Pansy, what are you doing?” Harry says, but she only pulls out a rolled up newspaper from her purse. She hesitates, then asks, “You haven’t talked to Draco all day?”
He stared blindly at the words accompanying the photograph, too embarrassed to even look at Harry. The other man, just a kid really, was a university student whom Draco had worked with all week as he had restored and translated a rare potions book. Louis had flirted with Draco, bringing him tea and homemade pastries, and had insisted that they have dinner each night. Draco had done his best to dissuade him, but Louis had not taken the hint. It didn’t help matters that every time Draco had looked up, he thought he saw Harry, only to realise that it was actually Louis.
Harry shrugs his shoulders and Draco sighs. He taps his wand against the egg like the children had done earlier in the day to reveal their prizes. As the shell breaks away, Draco’s breath catches. There’s a transparent glass sphere with a single golden line going all around and a clasp in the shape of feather. Inside is a golden tree with a peacock nestled in the branches.
“I understand,” Draco says at last. “Perhaps next Christmas, then.” He shouldn’t feel so disappointed. Of course Harry will want to spend time with the Weasleys. Molly Weasley almost didn’t survive, but luckily recovered at the last minute. If the situation were reversed, he’d be by his mother’s side if she fell ill.
“I always knew he was a freak,” Vernon says, voice trembling with rage. “His magic made him unnatural and now this!”
“Don’t say anything at all and help me decorate the tree,” Harry said simply. He flicked his wand and sent their dishes over to the sink.
The silence on the other end stretches for far too long and Draco wishes could take back the question. What was he thinking, asking something like that?
“Oh, Harry. You do like this person. Is it anyone we know? I did notice that you were sending a lot of post via international owl this summer, but Ron and I never wanted to ask because we wanted you to be able to talk to us. We didn’t want to pry.”
Neville’s eyes are wide by the time Harry has finished talking. “You sound like you’re pretty serious about him, Harry.”
Harry strokes Draco’s hair as he thinks about why Draco is more vulnerable than usual. Perhaps it’s because it’s so close to the war’s anniversary that Draco feels this way, but Harry thinks that something needs to change if this is the way his husband reacts to his prolonged absence.
“Harry, Draco, meet my wife, Julia. She’s the one who convinced me to send you a letter after I told her about first signs of, well, you know,” Dudley says, trailing off to a whisper, looking to see if Daisy has heard.
Pansy is waiting inside the shop by the time Draco has ordered two cherry scones and two takeaway cups of coffee. Her eyes light up as she grabs a cup, taking a large gulp. “This is probably the best thing Muggles have invented.”
Draco’s voice faltered under Harry’s gaze. He didn’t recall the last time someone had looked at him like he was worth something. He was used to being glared at, spit upon, and sometimes just ignored, but Harry didn’t do any of those things. He had treated Draco as an equal and someone who cared a great deal about him.
The peacock and egg lay on the ground, forgotten, as the two men continue to kiss for a very long time.
Draco removes his hands from Harry’s shoulders and Harry lets out a disappointed sigh. “If? I know you did. If you didn’t, you’re a dead man, Harry.”
“What just happened?” Daisy cries out and she grabs Draco’s hand to take a look, turning it over to see if he’s hurt.
“I take it back,” Harry said when they broke apart to breathe. “That might be the best Christmas present I’ve ever received.”
Draco swishes his stick and Vernon’s eyes follow it against his will. “So you really are a w-w-wizard?” he whispers. Even after all this time, he cannot bring himself to say the word.
Harry chokes on his bite of cake, coughing loudly as he tries to clear his oesophagus. After a few frightening seconds, Harry feels Hermione’s magic wash over him as his airway clears and he can finally breathe properly again. Taking several deep breaths, Harry repeats her question. “Apologise for what?”
Pansy scoffs. “No they won’t, Draco. In fact, I don’t think they’ll even look at what you’re wearing. They’ll be too polite to say anything.”
Draco didn’t answer Ron’s questions as he was too focused on Harry who was still on the ground and was clutching at the sling. “That does not look fine,” Draco said, “what happened, Harry?”
“You should have seen his face when he was trying to hide his disappointment. I feel like I should make it up to him. You know, the reason he was knitting that jumper is because he wants to introduce me to the Weasleys.”
Teddy’s eyes are bright and he can’t contain his excitement. “Of course! I already help Aunt Hermione take care of Rose and Hugo.”
Harry mouths back and turns to find Dudley staring at him. “Sorry, he still isn’t used to being around Muggles.”
Harry raises an eyebrow. “What do you call this, then?” Harry asks, waving a hand around the room. “You’ve spent that last few weeks in this office and you haven’t been taking care of yourself properly.”
“Well, I don’t really look the same as when I left.” Harry gestured to his body, which was fuller and much broader than when he had first arrived in Australia. “I mean, I am fine with the way I look, but—I don’t know, Hermione. What if Draco still looks the same, but he finds me entirely different?”
“Oh, thank fuck,” Harry says. “I was worried all this time about asking you if you wanted to go public with our relationship. I figured I would start out small and invite you to dinner at the Burrow.”
as he runs to the tree and reaches underneath. His only racing thought is that he must save the jumper before it’s ruined.
He already has Harry’s friendship, and, if he’s telling the truth, his affection. Hopefully the other two meanings will come true with time.
Harry’s laughter trailed behind him as he hurried to his room. He opened his suitcase and threw all his belongings into it, not even bothering to sort them out properly. At the last moment he decided that he needed to change clothes. It wouldn’t hurt to make a good impression.
“Harry, thank you for coming. Come inside, please,” Dudley says, and then does a double-take when he spots Draco. “I’ve seen you before! I used to think you were following me around, but it’s been a while since I last saw you. Are you a friend of Harry’s?”
After making a cup of tea, Draco writes a note for Harry to let him know that he has stepped out to run errands. His next letter is longer, asking his mother to please forgive him as he’s cancelling his Christmas plans, but for a good reason. He also promises to make it up to her. He bribes his owl, Ptolemy, with owl treats to deliver the letter as fast as he can before sending him out in the cold.
He found himself with this job after the war as he was going through the books in the Manor. The Ministry had confiscated as many dark items that they could find and they had specifically targeted the library. Whatever remained was left in tatters and while many of books had been preserved and protected with spells, those had lapsed and were now in serious need of repair.
“Charlie, wait! You forgot your suitcase!” The suitcase begins to shake violently on the kitchen table. Harry dreads that it might be a Wheezes product, one meant to explode all over him now that he’s officially broken up with Charlie. It would be something that George would most certainly do.
Once Harry makes it outside, he has to hold back his laughter. The Niffler has run down the side of the house and into the peacock pen, causing them to squawk and fan out their feathers as they are chased by the Niffler. Feathers fly everywhere and Malfoy is doing his best to stun the Niffler, but with no success. His hair is ruffled and his shirt is pulled out from his trousers. He has taken off his jacket and his shirt sleeves are rolled up past his elbow.
Draco doesn’t know his way around children. He and Harry had agreed not to have children early on in their relationship. The only person he’s helped raise is his cousin Teddy, who has graduated from Hogwarts and is in Romania with Charlie Weasley. And whenever he visits the Burrow for Sunday brunch, all the children abandon the adults in favour of playing with each other so he never really interacts with them.
Pansy fiercely hugs Draco and whispers, “Darling, you have me and Blaise and Greg, but most of all you have Harry. You’ll never be truly alone.”
“Just a spell that causes your heart to stop beating for a few seconds every time you even think about Harry. Considering the state of your heart, I think it’s a fair price to pay for all the things you’ve done to him.”
“You’re alive, as am I, because of him. You owe him so much more, but lucky for you, he doesn’t feel necessary to collect any debts. I, on the other hand,” Draco pauses, “am not that noble.”
When Harry puts his glasses back on, he sees that Hermione looks slightly horrified and she opens and closes her mouth several times. Harry doesn’t quite believe he’s ever seen her speechless. There’s a first time for everything.
Ron and George are laughing hysterically and even Harry can’t hide a smile. After a few long seconds, a baby ferret comes out of the briefcase and brings forth an envelope for Draco.
Instead of joining them when they had asked, Harry had decided to stay in England. He thought it was his duty to join the Auror programme and help bring in all the remaining Death Eaters that had gone into hiding after the war. It had only taken a few months to know that he had made the wrong choice. He hated going out onto the field and having everyone expect him to save the world.
Harry smooths out a wrinkle on Draco’s forehead (not that he would mention anything like that to Draco’s face) and kisses him. He feels Draco relax underneath him before eagerly kissing him back. When they break apart, both are gasping for breath and it fogs Harry’s glasses a bit.
Harry grins and takes a hold of Malfoy’s hands, which are unexpectedly cold. He rubs them for a bit before entwining their fingers together.
Harry nods. Those seemed like perfect examples of accidental magic. “Well, what made you change your mind?”
“I’m happy for you, Harry,” Neville says, clapping him on the shoulders. “How did you find out he’s allergic to roses?”
The next morning, Draco wakes up curled up against Harry’s side. He slowly untangles their arms and legs, careful not to wake him up. Dark, unruly hair peeks out from under the thick quilt that Molly had given to him as a housewarming gift. Other than Harry’s soft snores, the room is quiet. Draco smoothes Harry’s hair back, kissing him on the cheek, and slips out of bed.
“Not that you need it, but it’s a lucky charm. Grandpa Weasley told me that it’s Muggle, so you can have it with you in the exam room,” Teddy answers. He goes behind the desk and gives Draco a hug, whispering, “You’re going to do great tomorrow. Soon you’ll take care of all the sick animals.”
“Sorry,” Harry says. “I don’t know how many times I’ll keep apologising and I still don’t think it will be enough.”
Draco gently lifts the peacock out of the tree, but his hands hits the edge of the glass sphere and something falls back inside. “I’m so sorry, Harry! I think I broke it,” Draco says, his heart beginning to beat faster.
Harry doesn’t realise he has closed his eyes until he hears Draco’s voice repeating his name and  rubbing soothing circles down his back.
Draco is sitting on the bed, but his face is tear-stained and very red from the fact that he has been crying. He’s wrapped in one of Harry’s hoodies, his hair loose and all over his face as if he’s trying to hide from the world. Even his voice is low and raspy and Harry discretely casts a charm that lets him hear what Draco is saying to Pansy.
Draco nodded. “You’ll be interested to know that I finished cataloging and restoring the books in the library.” He sent his cup over to the sink and flicked his wand so that it washed itself. “I fulfilled my end of the contract so, logically, it’s time for me to leave.”
Harry starts humming a tune, and it takes almost a full minute for Draco to realise what song it is. “You see someone getting married? Is it Teddy?”
Draco was surprised when he had received a letter from Harry Potter, on the advice of Professor McGonagall, asking him to sort out Severus Snape’s library. He was going to say yes no matter what. After all, who wouldn’t want a chance to look through his former professor’s belongings, especially when he had found out it contained private journals.
Draco sighs, like it’s such a hardship for him not to be able to cook, but secretly he’s thrilled. “Fine, but only because I don’t want to spend the limited amount of time I have with you arguing.”
“How was I supposed to know that Muggles like to dress up their pets? The only person I know who might do that is Hagrid,” Draco says.
Harry’s heart warms at hearing those words and because he can’t help it, he pulls Draco up into a kiss. They break away when they hear Ron’s groan.
Draco sighs. “You may keep the sentimental items, Potter, but everything else goes. Your clothes are too frayed and if you must wear jeans and t-shirts, then you will buy new ones.”
After the war, he continued to hide behind books. Harry had managed to spare him from Azkaban, but he still had to figure out what he was going to do for the rest of his life. Draco was fortunate that the Manor remained and that he still had a small fortune to live comfortably. His parents were alive, but had decided to take a permanent holiday in Italy rather than stay in England. Nothing was gone, really, except for his reputation. So he had to work, or he would go mad.
Harry’s heart beats wildly and guilt spreads throughout his body. Draco has never mentioned this out loud, but perhaps the wine has loosened his tongue tonight, almost as if he has swallowed Veritaserum.
Immediately, he freezes. Vernon swears that in that moment, those grey eyes are seeing right through him, reading his mind and looking at all the thoughts he’s ever had.
Unbidden, Ron’s words the day he had told Harry he was retiring from the Auror force come to mind. “I don’t know, Harry,” he had said, rubbing the back of his neck, “there are always going to be criminals in the world, there’s no denying that. But do I really want to keep doing this for the rest of my life, when I’ve already spent so much of it fighting? I have Hermione and my children, the people whom I love most in the world and bring me peace, waiting for me at home. I’d be a fool to give that up.”
and peer into Harry’s mind. But he couldn’t, wouldn’t do that to anyone. Especially after having the Dark Lord enter his own mind and seeing everything he wanted to keep hidden.
“I don’t know what you are talking about,” Harry said, adding more milk and sugar to his tea. Draco shuddered. He didn’t know how Harry could take his tea like that. However, he would not be distracted by Harry’s ridiculous eating habits.
“It’s snowing and it’s the first day of December. It’s time to decorate for Christmas so I had to get a tree,” Harry said, as if the argument last night had not happened.
“Of course I’m sure. I didn’t ask you on a whim, Draco. I’ve been planning to ask you for quite a while, but I didn’t know how to bring it up,” Harry says. “I understand if you don’t want to, or it’s too soon—”
Harry doesn’t realise that his voice has become so loud until there’s silence and that everyone within five feet of their table is staring at them. Rose also whimpers in her sleep, but thankfully remains sleeping in Ron’s arms.
to the front with a tailoring charm. It’s probably quicker to use one of his own jumpers, but he’s not willing to part with his cashmere ones.
They had agreed to meet at the Leaky Cauldron, where they would work out the details of the agreement. What he hadn’t expected was to see how much Harry Potter had changed. Physically, he was no longer the scrawny, malnourished boy he remembered from Hogwarts. The Auror training programme had done wonders to change that.
They go sit down in front of the fireplace and Harry sets his bags down on the table before using his wand to add more wood to the fire.
Draco shakes his head. “I’m afraid not. Harry’s the chef in the family. Anything I cook would probably be inedible.”
Hermione had a knowing smile on her face when Harry finished speaking. “Harry, you don’t need to worry about anything. It seems like he’s smitten with you.”
After the quickest shower Draco has ever taken in his life, he is finally dressed in his Hogwarts uniform. He’s standing in front of the mirror for one last look when he realises that he’s forgotten to put on a tie.
Draco hits him lightly on the shoulder. “You’re not funny, Harry. I look fabulous in Muggle clothing. Besides, it turned out to be quite boring. The good thing is that it’s over now.”
