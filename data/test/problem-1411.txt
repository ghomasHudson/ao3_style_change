But he was so invested in the ordeal, trying to not mess anything up, and the fact that it's Potter, it was so close-
Potter seems caught off guard a bit and remains unmoving for a while. Eventually, he closes his eyes, concentrating.
"Did we really came here to talk about who smells and who doesn't?" Draco speaks through gritted teeth. Potter so far has done nothing but wasted his time. Draco doesn't have it to play around, the clock is ticking and he can feel death breathing down his neck, every second brings him closer to the judgment, and all Potter does is annoy him. Nothing changed.
"Then what do you want us to do? We can't just keep going upwards and backwards, it's going to make us go crazy."
His words didn't even feel fake. In fact, they felt sincere, and the boy didn't even hesitate while speaking them, it felt natural. If Draco were to do that, you would hear reluctance in his voice at best. The most probable is that he wouldn't even open his mouth.
"Something is up." She whispered. "Maybe he'll give you a chance to redeem yourselves." She glanced at Narcissa tellingly, then her eyes landed on Draco again. "Don't waste it."
"No, it's not a dream. And you don't have hallucinations, because you didn't hurt your head, because I didn't let that happen."
"Why not? Why wouldn't I help you in such a situation? I am doing this right now, so if I saw you're about to faint in any circumstances, I would help you. Because, unlike some people, I am a decent human being."
"What's so hard to understand, Potter? I have to do this!" Draco's voice is wobbly. He clutches his wand involuntarily. "It's either Dumbledore or us! I have no other choice! I can't get my mother killed!"
Actually, this isn't a problem itself. The problem is, what is going to happen if anyone improper except Potter gets to know.
"Oh, c'mon, I didn't- Well, you were the one who assumed somebody will want to kill someone." Potter gives Draco an accusing look. "And you told me you would kill me in the Hospital Wing, so-" He sighs," Anyway, what promise would we make with that pact?"
He comes closer to the other boy. "Let go of this." He tilts his chin in the direction of Draco's hand in which he holds his wand.
Draco squints his eyes. He must have hurt his head and this is all a dream, a delusion. There is no logical explanation for this.
"I mean- I thought about it- I even- followed you, right- " His cheeks get adorned with crimson-"I mean it's not a surprise, considering your father is a Death Eater, but still-"
He's so tired and he wishes he could just be sure about anything and be able to not be afraid that someone will come and kill him. He feels like vomiting anew, even though his stomach is empty.
They stand before the Gobelin on the seventh floor covered under an invisibility cloak about which Potter didn't want to reveal a single thing. Draco therefore had no clue how and why he got it in the first place, nor was he willing to investigate further. It barely covered their ankles, but Draco knew by now that everywhere else except their feet it does its job. Obviously, he first refused to put it on, being fully aware how much proximity it would demand from both of them. Nevertheless, there was no other way but to hide under it in case someone walks by. They couldn't allow anyone to see them together.
Draco doesn't care now, he is going to erase Potter's memory anyway, so it doesn't matter what he will say or not.
"Don't scream, Madam Pomfrey is going to kick me out if you do. She's already looking at us." He glances nervously at the spot where the nurse was only a while ago.
Draco remembers just how many times Aunt Bella bragged this summer about killing Sirius Black, her cousin. She was so exceptionally happy about it.
In Draco's case, they do him a favor. He can peacefully come there from time to time, whenever he needs to be alone, which these days happens quite frequently.
"Oh- Well then. You must remember to fuel your brain, otherwise, it's not going to work as well as you'd wish."
Draco turned to look at his mother. Her voice wasn't tremulous, maybe because she has met the Dark Lord before. She didn't look at Him. Her head remained slightly bowed.
There is somebody with him and they told Draco he was not going to die, so he looks up and there's- There's Potter, and he's nice, so maybe Draco is dying in the end.
He swallows and comes to the table to get his mug, more to get some time to gather himself than to actually drink it. He didn't have the slightest intention to do so.
Aunt Bella came to Malfoy Manor in the late afternoon and she seemed to radiate happiness, although happiness on her face resembled more of madness than joy.
Potter visibly seems to relax, his shoulders slouch down and Draco could swear he lets out a breath he's been holding in.
"Alright." Potter seats on the floor with legs crossed. "Before you want to kill me, be a decent human being and consider that I don't have any sick or twisted intentions here, so if you want to fight, at least give me a chance to prepare."
"You're going to meet him, Draco, it's a great day!" The woman chirped as she cupped Draco's cheek with her cold hand.
"Swear on your parents." His eyes glisten and a smirk is creeping on his face. "You wouldn't lie using them, would you, Potter?"
"Listen here, Potter," Draco speaks through gritted teeth. "Remember when my father kind of let the prophecy slip out? Well, You-Know-Who got mad, really mad-" his voice breaks- "And let's say we're lucky they put my father in Azkaban because otherwise, he would have been dead by now."
He should be proud, shouldn't he? This was what he was made for. This was what he was destined to be since he was born.
"Is it better?" Potter's voice is so soft Draco has issues with believing that the boy is talking to no one else, but him.
Clearly, because he hears a creak of the doors being opened. He tries his best to remain quiet. Maybe someone will think it's just some ghost crying and go away. He hears the door close and before he can breathe a sigh of relief, he hears steps that only get louder.
He wants it to be over. As if this whole situation wasn't embarrassing before, now it's surely reached its peak.
"Secret, The Noble Potter and His Secrets, My Ass." Draco rolls his eyes and although he's very irritated now, he keeps his voice down.
He doesn't even blink once while speaking, even if he's staring directly into Potter's eyes, even if he's close to his face and he should feel uncomfortable about it.
Draco feels mad, but at the same time- He can't blame Potter. Myrtle didn't know anything important anyway, she just witnessed a couple of his breakdowns and maybe, just maybe, perhaps, Draco let himself spill a few his guts before her.
He finally reaches the door, opens it and closes it with too much strength, the sound reverberates around the room, but he's past caring at this point.
Draco sent Potter a letter where he informed that he had made his decision, they just need to meet and discuss it. Potter replied the next day, and Draco had to wait with opening the letter until he was alone in one of the castle's corridors, and then burn it because Merlin knows he can't have any evidence left behind.
But then, Snape would enter his mind, read his thoughts too, and that Draco can't allow. It's not like he would learn it in a week anyway. Legillimency is difficult as fuck.
"You are right, I thought you'd love the idea of, how you put it, running around with your wand and killing people. But I promise, I'll try to change the way I- perceive you, even though it won't be easy. And only if you do the same regarding me, I don't think I'd like to know what is it that you think about me there, in your twisted mind."
Potter is an idiot, but Draco highly doubts he would come to fight him without a wand, and if he had wanted to, he would have done it. They have fought before over the most stupid, pathetic things that they should have let slide, but they chose not to. If Potter had come to fight, he would have done it.
Draco feels very unstable. He doesn't want to get into more physical contact with Potter, but he's afraid that on his own, he will collapse and make an idiot out of himself.
The tip of the wand touched Draco's skin. The Dark Lord looked at Draco, smiling obnoxiously, and in no time, Draco felt burning pain radiate from his forearm to his shoulder. The first wave of it was so strong that he wanted to wrench away- He refrained. Draco looked at his mother, who just stood by and watched. He couldn't read her expression at all, couldn't tell whether she's immensely happy or terrified. Draco never was good at understanding her feelings. She just stood there, wide eyes unwavering on her son's arm.
It is a quite cozy, small room, with a comfortable looking couch and a fireplace. The floor is covered with a woolly carpet, and there is a small, wooden table at the center on which stand two mugs with something very hot, as Draco can see steam from where he's standing.
Nothing really happened yet, but nonetheless, Draco could feel that he is certainly not ready for whatever is going to come. He could  very well feel the deathly aura surrounding Him.
"Yesterday you seemed a bit- Distressed, so I thought that maybe overnight you changed your mind, so- No? Is that your answer?" Potter raises his eyebrows.
"Have nothing to say? I refuse to believe it's just a coincidence that you came here at exactly the same time as I did."
"Listen, I appreciate it very much that you're trying to save my ass, but I don't think it's worth it."
Draco thought that he must look terrified, but the shock was too great for him to control his demeanor.
Potter stands right in front of him, uncrossing his arms and letting them fall comfortably on his sides.
Or maybe he's not. In the end, the prize that he will need to pay to keep them safe is, frankly speaking, high. A bit too much of what he has in him.
"I- I admit I have already done something- but I had to Potter, I had to." Draco feels his throat tighten. "Aunt Bella sent me a letter, she said He's growing impatient, and I had this medallion just in case-"
Draco swallows in attempt to relax his throat. He doesn't want to close his eyes, in case Potter comes up with something. It's also incredibly uncomfortable to keep looking into Potter's eyes in this situation but there is no other choice-
"Okay. So, to sum up, you are a Death Eater, Malfoy- Okay just don't get mad at me for this, I'm simply curious. We followed you in Nocturne Alley, was it then-?"
Because Draco knows all of this. He knows, but it's out of his control. He can't just refuse to obey Him.
He doesn't even wish for actually being saved, he doesn't wish for Potter to get him out of this hell. He's completely fine with the sole thought that there was a chance for him.
Malfoy, with all of his will, tries to not panic. He remains seated, with a blank face and hopes that Potter didn't notice a shadow of fear that swept through it when he heard the boy's words. He must look ridiculous, trying to act composed when in reality his heart is beating so fast that he wouldn't be surprised if Potter could hear it.
Honestly, he doesn't even hope for anything. His situation is, frankly speaking, hopeless, and there's not much more he can do.  He's surprised that such an opportunity arose at all.
"So. Malfoy." Draco drafts his eyes away from the steaming liquid to look at Potter. "What did you decide?"
"Yeah." Draco breathes out hoarsely and harshly wipes away his tears so he can actually see the ghost.
"He's going to lay down, and I'm not going to annoy him or anything." Potter also shoots his puppy eyes at the nurse.
"Why not?" Potter turns his head to look at Draco as well and Draco realizes that they have never been this close. Ever. Or they were, but that was when they were in the middle of a fight, so he wasn't much aware of the proximity.
Something starts to rustle and both of them snap their eyes in the direction of the sound, and in no time, right on the table, appears a plate full of food that Draco finds strikingly familiar.
"Of course. And that's why I can perfectly control my thirst for blood when there's an open wound with hot, fresh blood right in front of me. Not that I'd want to drink your blood if I were a vampire, anyway."
"That's necessary, Malfoy. We both have trust issues, in case you haven't noticed, so that's the only way we can make it."
Aunt Bella immediately got to Draco and hugged him, which felt even more unreal than the Dark Lord's visit.
"Ah, very well, Draco Malfoy. Draco... Lucius... Malfoy." Every word seemed to be closer to a hiss of a snake and it made Draco's head spin.
He leans back on the door, hearing his loud breathing ringing in the closed space. He feels like he's going to collapse, so slowly, without pulling away from the surface of the door, he sits down and hugs his knees into his chest. He's trying hard not to cry, but he knows that it's for nothing, he already feels familiar burning in his eyes. His bottom lip trembles against his will, his throat is so tight that it hurts and Draco can't take it anymore.
"My Lord, that is, that is the most- We are so grateful-" quickly, but with a bit of bashfulness, she reached for the piece of His robe and gently, with the utmost care, she kissed it- "So grateful. This is an honour-"
"No. If you ask me if that is when I was- When He did this-" Draco points his chin at his left arm. "Then no. And honestly, you aren't exactly discreet Potter, I've noticed you."
"Think about it, Malfoy." His voice is just shy of a whisper, and then Potter turns around, saying goodbye to Madam Pomfrey and this time actually goes straight through the door, he's out of Draco's sight, gone.
Why would it get better, Draco is breathing but it feels like he's suffocating and he can't control anything-
Draco has never thought about Potter in that way, never took into account what the boy might be feeling. He didn't look at him like at another human being, because it was Potter.
"Fuck, just do it on the other hand." Gustily, he rolls up the sleeve on his right arm. He didn't even do that on the left side, and he isn't a fan of cleaning blood from his clothes.
He couldn't believe it. He wanted to say it out loud, to say that he will kill for them to be safe, but he couldn't. Everything would be fine if he killed Dumbledore.
Not waiting for Draco's response, Potter mutters something under his breath that sounds a lot like vingardium leviosa, swinging his wand, and the plate soon enough levitates in the air, flying to Draco.
Draco tried to calm himself down. He liked Aunt Bella, but since He had come back, she seemed to sink into the madness more and more. She became crueler and more decisive. Draco started to think of her more as of a murdering machine than a human and it terrified him. And since the failure in the Ministry of Magic, with how everything played out- Draco wasn't sure if they were safe with her around.
He has done his research before coming to meet Potter. He found a couple of magical bonds and vows, but there was one, a very peculiar one, that he found liking for.
Draco actually feels a bit more hungry after finishing the toast, so he risks and takes a bit of an apple-cinnamon porridge.
Even if deep inside Draco wants to accept this help, he can't. He doesn't know if Potter's words are genuine. It can end disastrously for everyone. Draco is scared of the consequences. Whatever choice he makes, it's going to end badly for someone. He doesn't want to test madman's patience. He doesn't want to know what it's like to pay for the betrayal.
His dark cloak rustled quietly as his weak, thin, ashen body seemed to glide along the floor. This body didn't match the face of the Dark Lord. It didn't match his eyes.
However, when they were kids, Bella would squeeze Narcissa's hand before they went to meet their father. She was doing it to ground herself down. The hand was always cold.
"Again, how do I know you're honest? How do I know, Potter, that this isn't some trap you and your lovely friends prepared for me?! Why would you help ME?"
"You think I enjoy this, right?" He looks at Potter with a grimace. "The thing is, I don't fucking enjoy any of this. And it's not even the worst, Potter! It's not the worst!"
The snake wrapped itself around His leg, and then they were gone, with a characteristic pop that always follows teleportation.
Draco is going to do what he wants anyway, he doesn't have a single reason to trust Potter. Maybe Potter didn't do anything to him while he was unconscious, but it doesn't prove anything. Gryffindors simply are like this, they all are righteous and just. Naive. Like Potter.
The second thing he sees in the morning (first was Madame Pomfrey who had woke him up to give him some water and meds) is the door opening on their own, but it isn't something that surprises Draco the most. It is the fact that soon after that, Potter's head appears right in front of him, and Draco nearly chokes on the potion he's drinking.
Potter's face twists with annoyance, but he obeys. The rest of the bathroom suddenly seems to be very interesting.
Potter leans to embrace Draco and help him get up, and Draco flinches. He didn't think Potter will take him to the nurse literally.
Draco still isn't sure, but his common sense tells him that there's no way Potter would use his parents for some wicked games.
One of the problems is Potter, anyway. Maybe he should risk it. If he doesn't, there is no hope. If he does, it can go two ways, he either ends up screwed up, which can happen regardless of Potter and his will to help Draco or he can get away from it all and keep his family safe if he only had some luck-
This is so exhausting. Why did he even want to help Draco in the first place, if he had known he was going to behave like a spy and not a helping hand?
"O- Okay. I, Draco Lucius Malfoy, promise I will not use any information I get in the future against you, I will not give it to the Death Eaters or- or-"
All Draco could do is listen carefully, nod, and swallow quietly from time to time to release the lump in his tight throat. He felt like crying.
That night, he stayed up late, crying, genuinely crying for the first time since he couldn't remember when. Clutching his left hand, nails digging into the sore skin. Feeling lonely and hopeless like he had never felt before. He couldn't believe it.
"I'm not trusting you. I can't do this Potter, it's not only about me, but it's also about my whole fucking family, and I can't risk putting them in even bigger danger than they are in now. And I told you it's not who I want to be, doesn't it mean anything to you?!"
And he didn't let Draco skull crush against the bathroom's floor. Which again, could be a part of a trap, making Draco trust him, nonetheless, it doesn't sound quite like him. Potter just doesn't seem like that kind of a person.
Draco tried to come to his senses. He should thank Him, not everyone got the honour of getting the Dark Mark, even if they were meritorious.
It's stupid. The thing is all covered up, there's no way Potter will notice it in this maze of lumber. He's not very observant anyway, Draco saw enough of it through all of these years.
"Like I said, it's very old magic. There isn't a spell for it or anything of that sort. I just know you need to cut your hand with a wand, and then you need to touch your hands flat with the other party so that the blood mixes. You say your words, intertwine your fingers, I suppose it's to seal the vows and the blood forms into a vial. That's it. And no," Draco notices Potter opens his mouth to interrupt him," No, we can't mix our blood in a separate vail. It's the skin on skin contact that makes it work."
"See, it was all safe and sound. Now. There's this thing, but before I tell you anything, just- Don't act like a stupid Slytherin and try to kill me before I finish talking. Or at least give me a warning."
If it wasn't for the effect of the nerve-calming tea, he would have probably got a panic or a hysteria attack again.
"To humiliate us. Or more to punish us." He opens his eyes. "Don't think I'm stupid, Potter, he has so many people that could do that instead of me. You don't have to search for long, he has my Aunt-"
"No, I won't, you will cast obliviate at me the moment you get it. So no," Potter shifts in his seat, turning more in Draco's direction," I'm not giving it back to you until you've listened to me and we've settled something."
Potter shakes his head in disbelief but does as Draco tells him, laying on the floor next to him, but still keeping enough distance between them.
He has never felt like this in such a situation. Sometimes they glared at each other, but Draco can't recall if they ever have just looked at each other. No grimaces, no slurs mouthed at each other.
"Just. Think about it some more. " Potter looks at Draco intently. His voice is calm, coaxing. "Please. I want to help."
They were red and looked so ruthless that just after a glance Draco could tell that there's nothing left in him of a human he once was.
Potter isn't smiling. In fact, he appears to be worried. Brows furrowed, eyes on Weasley. Not that Potter is usually cheerful, or particularly alive in the mornings. Just a bit dim. Among the three, it's Weasley who always looks half-asleep at breakfasts. Granger is the early bird. Draco didn't look at them before, maybe Granger has already left. Or maybe something happened-
"What are you scared of, Potter?" Draco gives Potter a daring look. "Perhaps you don't really have the best interest of mine in your mind?"
"Because you ask like you care about my well-being, which, is frankly, not possible, Potter. You're lying, I must have hurt my head and this must be a hallucination."
Draco looked at his forearm. The veins on the arm got swollen, clearly breaking through the flushed skin. And the tattoo- It was there, writhing, twisting like a snake as if it was a living being. He stared at it, eyes wide open, mouth agape, half fascinated and half appalled. It was too much to take.
'Let's not talk about my father. If it weren't for him, maybe we wouldn't be even talking right now."
"You don't have to listen." Draco hisses through gritted teeth. "What do you even mean by helping me, huh?" Even if he holds back so much to not cry, his voice is tremulous again.
Draco drank some nerve-calming tea with a bit of something that most probably was Restorative Draught. Now his mind is more tired, but also more clear without blood rushing through his head and a palpitating heart. Thanks to that, he's realized by now what he nearly did.
No. They will work it out. He searches his pockets for some tissues, sniffing, but finds there are none. This is pathetic.
At last, his vision gets clearer, and he sees that he didn't manage to knock Potter out as he tried.
Mother seemed not to be able to find peace, either. Her skin paled even more than usual, she didn't eat anything throughout the day just like Draco.
He truthfully will come of age 17 soon, but this doesn't change the fact that Voldemort has plenty of people on his hand, way more skilled and trusted than Draco. It feels like a mockery and probably, it actually is. He did it to humiliate Draco and his whole family.
"I know. Take your time." With these words, Potter turns on his heels, striding to the door, and when he's finally there, he stops. He bows his head, taking a deep breath.
It's something house elves would make at Malfoy Manor whenever Draco came back home. This food most probably tastes homey and comforting, and Draco is starving, but there's something that is nagging his mind, something he needs to clear up.
Potter gets up, exasperated, and Draco hopes it's the end, but it turns out oppositely soon. He hears the boy mutter something he can't make out, and after a few seconds, he's coming back to Draco.
"No one, just myself. It's a sign of intelligence, did you know? " Draco diverts his already normal-sized eyes from the spot and looks at Madame Pomfrey, who now strides to his bed.
The person comes into his view and Draco abruptly pulls up, at the same time casting a spell, and- his vision gets blurry, his head is spinning, his legs give up on him. And the damn ringing in his ears, he can't see, everything is black-
Draco gulps. It could have been better, but at last, he doesn't feel like he's going to explode with the rush of his thoughts.
Draco feels that if he doesn't eat or drink something, he's going to faint. He takes the mug and sips the (surprisingly, still hot) chocolate.
"Oh really? You know, Malfoy, I've been in this shit for years now, so best believe me I know how it works. You think I don't know? You think that I-" Potter steps closer to the other boy, " don't know who Voldemort is? I've known him longer than you do from what I see, so stop pissing me off, if you think I feed on other people's misery, then you're very wrong!"
Draco opens his eyes wide and blinks a couple of times, staring at the spot where the boy's head was just a second ago.
"You. You- Are going to kill the man who is the only obstacle standing in my way. The hope of these filthy, insignificant beings," Draco felt his blood rushing through his heart. His first thought was Potter. "the small, who think they are safe thanks to him, we are going to take him away from them. You will kill the man who is called the most powerful wizard of our time- Although, with your help, not anymore." The wizard smiled viciously and Draco held in his breath. "You will get rid of Albus Dumbledore, Draco."
Draco turns from side to side on his bed, unable to sleep. He thinks about everything that has happened.
"But it's true. I just didn't want to go to the same house as you and Voldemort- Nevermind. I swear, I swear on my parents I won't use it against you."
It's been a week. Draco's thoughts have been stormed with the dilemma of whether to trust Potter or to leave it as it all has been so far and simply obliviate him.
It was even worse when his father was absent. With him, they felt as if they had some sort of protection. In the end, it was Lucius who believed so firmly in the Dark Lord's ideology. He didn't have a particularly close relationship with Him, unlike Aunt Bella, but still. Draco felt more at peace when his father was with them, because that way, he could do all the talking. He was the one speaking for them, always, regardless of whether they wanted it or not.
Draco feels anger boiling in him. What does this even mean-? He tries to pull up, but Potter grabs his arm and pulls him down, and does it rather gently, contrary to the grip.
Draco feels awful and pathetic because he can already feel his eyes water and Potter doesn't take all of this seriously, which is what Draco should have expected-
hi if youve gotten this far pls leave me some kudos or,,,, a comment if youre feeling bold,,,, it helps to feed the writers its me im the writers
Potter looks down and shakes his head, smiling lightly. Draco doesn't understand what suddenly made him so happy and it irritates him.
Potter grabs Draco's arm to stop him from leaving or maybe cursing him. Draco looks at Potter's hand.
Draco turns so that he lies on his back and looks at the ceiling. Maybe it's because he is so tired that he feels as if this day didn't happen at all.
"How do you know I need it?!" He sounds petulant now, he knows, but he's past caring at this point. He feels a sob shaking his body.
"We don't have time for that." Draco's voice is rigid. "We need to intertwine our hands and say the vows."
"Just when I thought I can't humiliate myself before you even more today, I had a fucking panic attack."
"Stop interrupting, Bella! You got the honour to be here with them, yet you show all kinds of disrespect! If you don't calm down, I will make you leave!"
She patted Draco's cheek and went to the cabinet with alcohol. She got a bottle of whiskey and chugged from it right away.
Maybe they did. Once, at Madam Malkin's. A long time ago, when Draco was an ignorant kid blindly following his father, trying to impress him, and thought that it all was about just being better and richer than others, whatever it really meant.
"I was praying, Potter, that it wouldn't work in the end. I truly hope she gets better, I- You thought it's simple, didn't you? You thought- You thought I will just-" He inhales, it gets harder to speak while crying- " absolutely love the idea of run- running around with- with my wand, killing and torturing mud- people who are born in muggle families, am I right?"
It feels good to say it out loud. It's like Draco -at least for now- can stop pretending that he stands with all the cruelty happening.
Draco clenches his hands into fists and takes a deep breath, even if he feels uncomfortable this close to Potter. He can smell he definitely needs a shower.
Draco wishes he could look up from this spinning floor, but he can't force his eyes to move. All he can do is squeeze them shut, but the darkness is even worse than the spinning room, and his breathing is so loud, so loud and it doesn't stop.
Draco realizes that this may be his only chance. Everything seems to go in the right direction, Potter doesn't pressure him, it doesn't feel as if he does this to get his information.
"I'm not stupid Potter, after your "Dumbledore's Army" thingie last year I'm pretty sure the whole school knows about the Room of Requirements and how it works. Especially me, I caught you."
"What?" His voice goes up unnaturally high, he immediately stands up. Potter was supposed to not talk about this with anyone!
To the last words, Potter gives a small nod and it seems like he is very pleased with himself for some reason. Maybe he thinks he has Draco all figured out.
Draco, no matter how hard he tried to calm down, couldn't help his accelerated heartbeat. He knew that the Dark Lord can hear every single beat, just like Aunt Bella, but she didn't pay it any mind anyway. She was too concentrated on Him, staring at Him with utmost adoration. Her wide eyes and furrowed eyebrows, her opened mouth, all of this was showing that she's completely lost in the words.
"If you think so, then I'll swear that I won't use any information I may get in the future against you, or give it to the Death Eaters."
Draco feels sick of it. The porridge would taste so homey and comforting if only he was in a stable state of mind, but Draco isn't, and neither is his stomach. He leaves the unfished food and stands up from the table, trying not to look at Potter again. His gut is telling him that something is odd, but he ignores it. He's got his own problems he needs to deal with.
"You won't ever tell me why are you like this, will you? ", She tilts her head," The real reason?" Her voice isn't screeching anymore. It sounds normal, considering how the ghost is used to wailing and squealing to just kill time.
They keep their voices down and that makes it all a bit more intense. Sometimes, a quiet hiss can be much more powerful than a scream. Draco has learnt it his own way.
Draco nods weakly, feeling ashamed of what Myrtle could tell Potter. He sits down and leans forward, supporting his forearms on his thighs, head slightly bowed down.
Draco snorts. Potter trying to be funny himself is way funnier than his jokes. Or in more suitable terms, pathetic.
It sounds like a plead, Draco's shoulder shake one more time due to sob, and maybe that's what makes Myrtle back off. In the end, it's not the first time she sees him like this, and she has learnt that insisting won't help her to get anything out of him.
Draco feels very uncomfortable with Potter piercing him with his gaze like this. However, it also starts to amaze him how quickly the boy goes from annoyed to soft and all worrying. Truly uncanny.
Madam Pomfrey hums and turns her back on Draco, heading to her office once again with the big bottle of potion. Draco thinks that she must walk a tremendous distance every day, going between her office and the hospital room time and time again.
Draco stands up and ignoring his pounding heart, he starts to roll up the sleeve of his shirt, staring at confused Potter. Not even blinking once.
"I'm not going in there," Draco whispers as loudly as he can in the circumstances he finds himself in.
"Why have you come here?" Draco asks, trying to sound firm as to not let his fear show. He glances at Potter, who's staring at the ceiling.
"See, that's why we need that pact!" Draco gestures to the hand in which Potter holds his wand. "You don't even trust to be around me when I have my wand!"
"Did someone die?", she inquires with apprehension in her voice, and her brows furrow so strongly they nearly meet in the middle of her forehead.
Draco feels like falling under the ground and burying himself there all over again. He wanted everything to be set as quickly as possible, but now that it's come to it, he feels panicked. Everything is going to be clear.
"Who's there?" A high-pitched voice filled with concern irritates Draco's ears. He looks up, but he can't see much because of the tears.
"No. Now, don't try any tricks, because if you want to run away, I will find you, young man, drag you here and put you back to sleep. And besides, it's a very strong potion, chances are that you would fall asleep while walking."
If she only knew that the real reason as to why he's skipping meals is tremendous fear that constantly makes him nauseous, doesn't let him sleep at night or think about anything else than his mission.
Filled with excitement voice of Aunt Belle should have made him feel more confident. As long as she was sure that Draco supports the Dark Lord, she should try to protect him.
"Did you really forget that we are wizards, Potter?" Draco raises an eyebrow. "There's plenty of things that can make us keep our promises. Keep us from betraying each other."
Draco tries his best to have control over his nerves. He's lost it before Potter once already, and he's not going to repeat this mistake.
"God, Malfoy, do I fucking swear on something for you to believe that I'm honest or-? What do you want me to do?"
"Shut up and tell me what is going on with you. The way you're crying here isn't normal. It hurts to listen to it."
"I know you're uncomfortable, but trust me, I am as well. It's for your own good, so try not to be crass."
"No. I'm going to stay here. I'll finish this fucking porridge. Go to the potions without me, I'll join you later."
Then he was a bit older and lived in the belief that he understood it, that he could do this-but now he is sure he can't.
Maloy really has had enough by now. He wishes he could just use obliviate and make Potter forget everything, but somehow, he doesn't have the heart to do this. A big part of him wants it to be true, wants anyone to come and save him.
"Now we can talk, Potter. What is it that you yet want to discuss, eh?" Draco pulls his knees to his chest, not caring that he's still wearing his shoes and that he's sitting on a couch.
Draco feels his heartbeat speed up even more and his throat getting tighter. He's afraid to speak, knowing very well his voice will sound breathy and unsteady if he does.
Potter looks at the ceiling as if he expected for something to fall from the sky and strike Draco, he catches Draco's gaze for a fraction of second and then, his head is gone. The door opens quietly, closes, and Draco is alone again. He wishes he wasn't.
"Malfoy." Potter pulls his cheeks down with his hands. He looks exasperated. "Malfoy, I've sworn on my parents. They are the people who I love as much as Hermione and Ron. And there's no way, that I would ever, ever, ever swear on them and lie. Do you want me to swear on Hermione and Ron too? Fine, I'll do it, I swear I won't tell anyone about this unless you want me to. On Hermione and Ron."
"What?! Do I stop crying? I can't even cry in peace?! Without the Most Noble Potter coming here and-"
"You- You think Dumbledore will know, that he will know what to- that he will know what to do?" His voice starts to shake more and more with every word. "Okay. Okay. I'll- I'll give it to you straight then, Potter."
Draco runs his eyes around the room. He can't think, he doesn't have thoughts- There's just breathing and the certainty that he's going to end.
"It was your idea, Potter, and we've already settled for it. So say it. If I agreed to that shit, then you do that too."
Draco sensed there was something wrong immediately, not because of the look on his mother's face, but because they never, neither her nor father, would come to him unless there was something terrible or exceptionally important going on. They would always tell Dobby or some other house-elf to tell Draco to come down to the dining room or the living room. They would never bother to visit him themselves.
"Whenever you decide, just come to me." He gets up. "I don't know, write a letter or something. Whatever you decide so that I know where I'm standing."
A nearly transparent drop of liquid slowly forms right above their hands. It floats higher and higher, and when it's right above their heads, it starts transforming into a more familiar shape.
"Such a pretty boy." The wizard smiled and cupped Draco's chin with his cold, almost blue fingers and Draco nearly turned away with disgust. "Not like these filthy mudbloods. I hope you'll represent me well in Hogwarts."
"Give me.." A loud hiss filled Draco's ears. He shivered, and with struggle, he rolled up the sleeve of his shirt. The Dark Lord turned Draco's arm so that the inside of the forearm was facing up.
"No, I just don't want to get bound to you without making sure-" Draco pulls himself up from the backrest, giving Potter a daring look- "Okay. Do you know the spell?"
Maybe he was right. Maybe that is what Draco truly is. He doesn't even have the balls to do something that will protect his family and their honour.
But there is a chance, the slightest possibility, that Potter decided to just now, at last, let demons do their thing and screw Draco over. It could happen.
"For your information, I do shower. I told you I came here straight after training, also I thought you won't be able to smell anything since you always use so much cologne, people can smell you literally from the other side of the class. I'm quite surprised you don't smell of anything right-"
How much Draco would love this, for someone to come and save him, take him away from this all, make him feel safe. If it could be as simple as that, this someone could even be Potter.
"Okay. I'm leaving." Myrtle says in a small voice, slowly flying away, still facing Draco. "But if you'd ever need me, you can talk to me."
"That wasn't necessary, Bella. I'm sure the boy is just... Shocked." Draco felt the intense stare of the Dark Lord, yet he still couldn't find the courage to look up at Him.
Draco is certain he has never seen such a face on Potter before. The boy looks at him intently, his gaze is piercing Draco through. Draco wants to believe him, yet he can't bring himself to respond to that.
"No need to worry. I know what it's like. I've had this shit only twice, fortunately, but you know. No need to be embarrassed. I get it."
"Don't get mad at me for this, I had to have some background information. You know the situation we have here." Potter gestures to the air between them.
"It's a type of magical bond, an agreement, and it involves mixing of the blood of the two parties, not that I think either of us would particularly enjoy it. This blood turns into a vessel, sort of an ampoule, supposedly. You can't destroy it, and the consequences of breaking it can vary, depending on the relationship and the promise made during the act. Basically, if you tried to kill me, or did something not so in my favour, you could get seriously injured, or get yourself killed. But that's in radical cases."
As soon as Draco feels Potter move away, Madam Pomfrey comes back, the sound of her footsteps rings in the big room. She carries a big, brown bottle in one hand and a spoon in the other.
He exhales loudly with a wheeze, growing more and more irritated with the whole situation. Potter makes him anxious, Draco finds it suspicious that Potter came to the bathroom just when he was in it.
She was nervous. Mother told Draco once that when they were kids, Aunt Bella would get very nervous around their father. It was quite hard to grow up in such an aristocratic family, and even though Bella would rather die than admit it, the pressure coming from high expectations would always take a toll on her. Especially if she was the first child.
Just a while more and he's going to be there. No one is going to interrupt him, no one is going to ask questions, he will be able to just calm down and get himself together. Just a little more.
"I thought we leave the past behind, Malfoy." Potter's voice is softer now. "If I trust you, if I believe you want to change, you should believe that I know Dumbledore better than you do and I mean no harm. I understand you realized at last that Voldemort is the Devil. It's okay. Better late than never. You need help, and Dumbledore will get you out of this."
If there's something Potter values more than anything in this world, then it's his family and his friends. Even Draco knows that. He swallows audibly, reminds himself that he can still use obliviate on him if there will be a need to, and raises his eyes at the other boy.
"And what are you going to do?" He scoffs. "You could also spy on me or leak information about me to Voldemort."
"Stop it, Malfoy." Potter frowns and adjusts his glasses. "You had your little speech, now it's my turn."
Draco bites his fist to muffle the sounds he makes. No one comes near this bathroom, but it's better to be quiet in case someone walks by unexpectedly.
"I think we have something more important going on now. How are you feeling?" Potter sounds and looks concerned, this time peering at Draco with attention Draco isn't used to getting from people. and especially not Potter.
"You say you didn't come to spy on me, then what is all that for? I will help you, I can't just let you cry like that, what was all that for?!"
"Did someone visit me while I was sleeping?" Draco asks as he opens his mouth and swallows the potion. It doesn't taste of anything.
If he had had the courage, he would have looked up at Him, but he didn't. Instead, he stared at the floor.
Even though Draco had been poured alcohol, he didn't drink a drop. Dark Lord was saying a lot of things that Draco's father would say about the purity of magic blood, mudbloods, blood traitors. Then, he said that He's getting closer. That this time, it's finally going to happen. Nagini stayed still next to him, ogling everyone at the table and hissing ominously from time to time.
He is so much more than scary, His presence is so much more than bloodcurdling, Draco couldn't stand on his own legs next to Him.
"How are you going to do this?! Do you even have any idea what-" Draco bites his lip, it was close. If it keeps going like this, he's going to break, tell fucking Potter everything, and then regret it.
"I don't think that I can convince you at this point. Let's be honest, there's nothing that could convince you, Malfoy, so why do you ask?"
Potter nods, pursing his lips, and Draco waits for him to speak, for he's clearly debating on something in his mind.
Objectively, Potter could use Draco's weakness against him. Draco was terrible, he admits. And Potter hasn't been a saint either.
Draco starts to feel tingling traveling from the tips of his fingers, through his hand, and to his elbow.
Thoughts start to gallop through his head, all kinds of scenarios run before his eyes, his mother being tortured and then dying from exhaustion and wounds,- so many terrible things can happen, there's no way this can go well. There's no way.
It all could be a deception, a trap. Draco was an asshole towards Potter, so it would be no surprise if he tried to get his revenge.
Draco follows it with his eyes, mouth slightly agape, focused as if nothing else mattered at this moment.
He heard his mother standing from the seat and saw Aunt Belle falling to her knees before the Dark Lord.
Normally, Draco would probably scoff. But not anymore. It's not the way he wanted to go, not anymore.
Draco nods. Potter takes his hand, and soon, accompanied by Draco's hiss, the palm turns red from blood.
He thinks about Severus. The man for sure has sworn to his mother to protect him because he told him that if Draco doesn't know what to do, he will do the job. It's certain that he wouldn't do that out of his goodwill, or because he's a good godfather.
"You could have killed Katie. You're lucky she survived." Potter speaks in a low voice while glaring daggers at Draco, and it's more disturbing than if he started to scream.
He dreamt of this. Of some hero coming for him and taking him and his family somewhere far away, where no one can hurt them. He wished for it to happen, prayed for it.
Draco refrains from taking a deep, tremulous breath, and feeling his accelerated heartbeat, he raises his hand, palm facing Potter.
"And you can't destroy it, it will last until we die? Are you sure, Malfoy? We'll be bound by that for the rest of our lives." Potter clearly tries to talk Draco out of this idea.
"I don't know if I should continue, because if you're going to use it all against and go to Dumbledore, then- That's the least Gryffindor thing you could possibly ever do. And you better tell me so I can erase your memory and you let you live in peace, because if not, then I will kill you, I swear I will do it."
Draco's steps echo loudly in the empty corridor as he strides directly to the bathroom of Moaning Myrtle. No one ever comes there, mindful of the presence of the ghost, and  after Ginny had opened the Chamber of Secrets years ago everyone is avoiding it with double caution. It's completely stupid because the basilisk has been long since killed, but rumors do their job regardless.
"You promise you won't betray me, turn me in or try to screw me over in general, Potter. You'll do what you can to help me and let go of assumptions you've made about me through all these years."
Draco was laying on his bed, trying to sort out his thoughts. He knew there's a lot he didn't know, and he wished it would remain this way. All he knew was that his father is in Azkaban, and if he wasn't, he would have been dead by now.
Draco wonders why all of the places they could possibly go to, The Noble Potter wanted to go to the Room of Requirements. Going there would be the most stupid, along telling Potter about his mission, thing Draco could imaginably do.
"Can you, " his voice sounds tight and unnaturally high, and that makes him feel even worse, " Just- just leave me? Alone?"
"Let me eat. You keep saying I don't eat, but when I try to, you successfully stop me from doing so."
Draco doesn't respond. He clutches the material of his vest right beneath his chest and keeps breathing heavily.
Truth be told, Draco's life is one big failure, and the thought makes his chest burn, and it hurts, and it tears him, and that makes his sob sound inhumanly, so much he never thought he would be capable of making such a sound. He bites his fist because he shouldn't be making so much noise. He knows no one ever comes here, but with his current luck everything is possible.
Draco wants to be saved, he wants to feel safe, he wants someone to take off the burden from his shoulders, and yet, it's not just about him. His life doesn't belong to him anymore. And so much can go wrong-
"HAPPY?! That's the fucking thing Potter, I'm not happy one bit. And you will probably think it's pathetic and hypocritical, and honestly, yeah, it fucking is!" Draco's voice goes up with every word. "I didn't think it would look like this!"
He feels his eyes water, too, and the approaching disaster that will certainly come if Potter doesn't leave right now.
Draco is sitting in the Great Hall, next to Pansy and Blaise, trying to force himself to eat anything. He settled for a toast with butter. Better anything than nothing.
"Because-" Draco feels confused. He doesn't know whether he should tell him the truth or lie, it feels like it would be better just to not say anything. However, Potter is there, anticipating, and Draco can't find a good explanation. He just thought he will be able to talk Potter out of this idea, that he will say no and that will be it. He didn't expect he will need anything more than this and now if they go there, maybe Potter will see-
Erase it and try to get through this all on his own, as it was supposed to be since the very beginning. He feels his chest ache, it gets heavier, it's harder to breathe, nevertheless he raises his wand, aiming at Potter.
Draco pinches his nose bridge. As much as he feels dead inside, Potter always has his way of making him feel all sorts of annoyance, irritation, and anger.
"Okay." His voice is just shy of a whisper. "Now, if you believe me, you need to tell me what's wrong. I can't help you if I don't know."
"They don't know." Potter looks at his hands placed on his crossed legs. "I didn't tell them. It felt-" he lowers his voice- "too personal."
Potter scratches his head. From the look on his face, Draco can tell he's not going to like whatever Potter has to say now.
"Are you stupid?!", he shifts in his seat, and notices Madame Pomrey peeking at them, "It's not a good idea." H esays in much lower voice. "Things can change and this vow- This vow can be the end of us at some point. And we'd need a third party for that, anyway. So. Think of something else."
"Draco!" she squealed, pulling away. She squeezed his arms from both sides, shaking him "Do you even realize what great of an honour this is?!" she exclaims with a note of hysteria in her voice, "This is- Cissy-" She glanced at her sister, who was now standing, leaning on the back of the chair, staring at the floor. "Cissy!"
"That's not it. I already know you're a hypocrite," Draco scowls at Potter's words, but Potter doesn't pay it any mind and continues," I just have no idea what you're talking about. You're not being very specific, to be honest."
"Stop being dramatic, Cissy! He isn't a kid, not anymore, how old is he, 10?" Bella was clearly mocking her sister. "Remember me when I was his age?"
Since he's been commissioned, Draco found himself thinking about it more often than not. He can't possibly imagine fighting Voldemort. He nearly pissed himself just talking to Him, even though he knew that He wouldn't kill him. Aunt Bella precisely stated while talking to his mother that the Dark Lord would come to give Malfoys a chance to redeem themselves, and as much as Bellatrix was crazy and heartless, Draco likes to believe she would let them know somehow if the Dark Lord was planning to finish them off.
"There's-" Draco lowers his voice, "I've read about it somewhere, it's very old magic, but I find it safer since- you get scars after doing the Unbreakable Vow- And we don't want people to see we've done it, do we? Besides, we'd need a third party for it. I don't need anyone else involved."
"I know you're not going to like it, but I think-" Potter looks at his hands for a while, then looks back at Draco, "I think we should tell Dumbledore."
Pansy trying to get her hands on him and Blaise looking at him with this unchanging mocking expression on his face.
"Or the Dark Lord. I will not try to screw you, Harry- Harry James Potter, or your friends over. I also let go of assumptions I made about you throughout my life."
At least Draco was finally certain who dragged him through the snow next to the Shrieking Shack in the third year. It must have been Potter.
Maybe Draco should let him. Maybe he should allow himself to be saved at least today. At least for today.
Draco was shocked that these words left his mouth. He was paralyzed, felt like throwing up and fainting at the same time.
"Just- Your hand is so cold," Potter mumbles, pointing his wand at Draco's palm, and then his eyes land on the black tail peeking from the sleeve-
"Here," The nurse says as she pours a transparent liquid on the spoon, "Once you drink it, you'll be able to sleep peacefully for a couple of hours."
"If you tell-" he starts speaking in a low voice and scoots a bit closer to Potter- "If you tell anyone about what saw, I'm going to kill you. I swear, I will do it."
"I- I don't know, you didn't react, I didn't want to slap you, or touch you, so I just said it. And it worked, so that's all that matters."
"Oh." Dark Lord touched Draco's chin and lifted it so that the boy met his eyes. Draco felt piercing shivers running down his spine once again. "You better won't. Your father has already disappointed me, but this is your chance. Your chance to redeem your family's name. And you must understand, Draco, that this time, I cannot take any failure. Not anymore. I'm convinced you do not want to fail me as Lucius did."
"You should." Malfoy reaches for his glass from the bedside table, takes a small sip of water, and soon he's chugging it until there's not even a drop of the liquid left. Potter stares at him with amusement.
He moves on his knees deeper into the bathroom, and sits down again, leaning back on the wall between the two rows of cabins.
"Listen, I just want to yet tell you one thing." Potter doesn't look at him, he keeps his voice quiet and compassionate. "I- I've been through a lot in my life and it takes me a lot to say it, but I think I could understand, truly. It may seem like it's all easy, because hey, I'm the Golden Boy that you love to mock and make fun of, but- But I really, really know what it's like when you feel like you can't make it, or when you feel hopeless, and overwhelmed, and scared- And I really want you to know that."
Draco is nearly sure Potter won't lie when there are his parents considered and he's ready to hear a "no".
"You really don't understand, do you, Potter?! " Draco dips his head down and runs his hands through his hair, pulling at the ends a bit too much for it to be painless. He feels tears rolling down his cheeks. "You said you wanted to help me! Can't you really see, literally are you blind or what? I don't want to do this, how many times do I have to say that?!" Draco looks at Potter, not caring about how he looks. Potter has witnessed enough of his misery already.
"I would never kick someone weaker than me! You understand? I don't want to fuck you over, and Dumbledore will know what to do, he's the most powerful wizard of our time, so would you shut the fuck up and let me do this?"
"I thought you're on good terms with him since you broke my nose for his dignity or whatever." Potter gazes at Draco with clear suspicion. "Couldn't you- I don't know. You nearly killed Katie, Malfoy."
The air gets heavier and for a while, the only audible thing is silence interrupted by Draco's loud, still ragged from crying, breathing.
"Oh, so that's why you came here. I see." Draco's tone is dripping with sarcasm. Potter either doesn't notice it or ignores it.
The voice is so loud and annoying. Draco wishes he could just open his mouth and tell Potter to fuck off.
He wants Potter to be genuine. It doesn't even matter that it's Potter anymore, Draco wants to escape. Draco wants to be protected.
"Malfoy, I said something about you using your wand without giving me a warning." Potter's voice sounds more firm than before. Draco glances at his hand and sees that without even noticing it, he clenched his fist around the magical object. A little against his will, he lets go of it.
He feels pathetic for breaking down before Myrtle, who's floating above him, eyeing him with concern.
Instead, he shakes his head and keeps breathing, and it's just breathing, his chest is rising and falling in this irritatingly steady way that he doesn't even control-
"You must be joking, Malfoy. I mean- Why would he want you to do that? I expected that you must have gotten something, some mission, but-"
"Listen. You either listen to me and take it all seriously or go fuck yourself, because none of this is funny. And I am aware that I was an asshole, and let me tell you-" Draco's voice cracks. "During these last months and especially during this summer, I've seen enough and heard enough to know I'm not like them, And I regret- I regret some things I've done."
"I also promise I will not lie to you and I will trust you." The words barely leave Draco's mouth, and then he feels Potter intertwining their fingers. A bit too tightly for Draco's judgement.
"Mr. Malfoy, I'd rather if you stayed here for a few more hours and got some rest. Preferably, sleep. That's the best healer, along with time."
Draco refrains from snorting (again). Nothing was good and now not only has he Voldemort breathing down his neck, but also Harry Potter with his weird need to save everyone he possibly can.
"First, you eat. Then we talk about whatever the fuck is going on here, and then maybe I'll give you back your wand. Maybe. What's that, anyway?" Potter nods towards Draco's plate, now stably resting on his knees.
Draco feels hopeless. There's no one he can turn to, not that he doesn't have anyone. The reason is, he frankly can't. It would ruin everything if he tells anyone, he's going to be dead, and take his family with him to his grave. He can't allow this, ever.
Draco nods, trying not to focus at the feeling of their blood literally mixing and their hands touching.
Draco says in one breath and just then realizes. His eyes widen on their own and he opens his mouth unknowingly. There was one time when he cried so hard he actually choked and thought he's going to die. It was pretty recent. Maybe he's paranoid or maybe-
Potter proposed to meet on Saturday, at the seventh floor, and Draco found it suspicious since the very beginning. He thought about the Requirements Room but hoped Potter has some other place he wants to go, just picked this place for the sake of convenience since not a lot of people go there.
"Do you think it will be enough, Potter? Because I don't think that words will work well in our case."
"I'm not asking because it was weird- I mean it was, but that's not my point- I just didn't know whether it was true-"
Draco gapes at Potter through squinted eyes, tilting his head to the side and sighs with irritation.
"You know Potter, they have no idea-They all think it's so great, Pansy is so proud, the Dark Mark, Merlin!" He hides his face behind his hands. "They have no idea- I may be prejudiced, I may hate some people, but I would never-" He looks at Potter as if it didn't make it all harder to get out. "It's stupid and I'm pretty sure if they had to see what I've seen, they wouldn't be so optimistic about it. What happens there-"
Draco's raucous scream reverberates around the room. He has never behaved like that in front of Potter.
Draco would drink as well, but he was sure that if he drank, he would throw it all up at sight. He hasn't been able to eat anything.
She glanced up at Him and Draco thought she looked like a beaten puppy if that term was anything near appropriate to describe her with.
"I know, Malfoy." Potter sounds deadly serious. "I have encountered Him a couple of times already, and not only Him but actual Death Eaters that aren't my aunt or cousin of- I don't know, my dog."
" Don't look at me like that, I know what I said before, Potter. I wasn't in the right mind and i was exhausted. I didn't think." Draco defends himself.
Draco opens his eyes and lets the tears flow down. Potter has heard him crying anyway, what's the difference if he actually sees him doing it? There's no fucking difference if he's going to die soon anyway.
Draco wants to thank him. Everything indicates that Potter helped him out of the free will and without any sick or twisted intentions, so it would be appropriate to thank him.
Draco just nods, not looking at her, he's already hid his face behind his hands. He only hears the wheezy sound of Myrtle disappearing in one of the drains.
"Will you say something, Potter, or am I supposed to obliviate you already because you just wanted a proof that I'm a Death Eater?"
"You should drink it. Seriously, Malfoy. Once, a friend told me that chocolate makes you feel better and- And I think you really need some chocolate right now."
Draco opens his eyes. He can't see anything, everything is a blur, and so he blinks furiously a couple of times.
One part of Draco wants to believe that everything will be okay now. Another, bigger part of him, doesn't even try to do so. Draco isn't reconciled with his fate yet, but he doesn't feel like fighting it anymore either.
He sobs particularly loud now, and it reminds him of times when he was little and his father would hit him with the stick of his wand if he cried too much. His mother would tell him to stop it, that it "isn't the way to teach a kid how to behave" but his father knew better, of course.
