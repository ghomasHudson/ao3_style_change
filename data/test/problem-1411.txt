Hermione murmurs under her breath and the room is plunged into darkness, startling both men, before suddenly, there is a rectangular patch of light glowing against the wall, Malfoy’s belly seeming to glow with it. Stepping closer, Harry thinks it looks similar to a Muggle slide projection, but cannot for the life of him make out what he’s supposed to be looking at.
Harry mixed hot water into the porridge mix and ladled out bowlfuls for the children. The sun rose and coloured everything peach as the children sat together, spooning up sweetened porridge and chattering inanely. Harry sipped his tea and dunked a couple of biscuits in between feeding Lily her breakfast.
“I don’t think we need to be that concerned about it, Potter, don’t be ridic—”
Now, the thought of hugging Draco or being in close physical proximity to him in general – him with his abnormally bright hair, his puckish smirk and, fuck, that goddamn fucking

” coupled with a wild upward buck into Harry’s cock that made Harry see bright white spots.
Malfoy just continues staring at him, his expression oddly empty. A huge shudder wracks him and he hunches over some more, his arms tightening around himself. Harry is in front of him in an instant, crouching onto his haunches and cupping Malfoy’s damp face, pressing fervent kisses across it and fully expecting to be shoved away any second. But Malfoy just remains still and unmoving, and when Harry pulls back and stares desperately into his eyes, he just blinks slowly, sniffling.

Harry stared, shocked. When Malfoy caught his expression, he looked even more worried.
“Malfoy, I’m fucking serious. Go.
, that’s what you’re saying.”
, mate?”
“Ugh--”
Softly: “Give him a minute.”
Draco slumps backwards, turning half onto his front and burying his face into the pillows. Stomach rolling unpleasantly, mouth bitter with the aftertaste of too much alcohol, Draco breathes in deeply. He smells, very, very faintly, sweat and spunk...and Potter.
After several seconds of furious gulping, Ron asks with forced nonchalance, “So...you didn’t fuck him then?”
Harry’s heart was still racing excitedly, his skin tingling as he broke into a light sweat despite the November chill. His brain was buzzing – the way it probably ought to have buzzed

There’s a flash of white blond hair, blindingly bright under the midmorning sun, at the exact same moment Harry’s arm is ripped open, from wrist to elbow, on a jagged piece of glass in the shattered window.
“Your father and I are taking the children to the Manor for tonight,” she answers crisply. “I thought you’d appreciate the time to clean up and rest a bit.”
“I gave them something to lap up,” Harry says when Malfoy finds him after Potions.
“Your old job at the DMLE?” Draco asks, genuinely happy for him.
This time, the pause lasts longer.
After Potter had pulled his shirt back on, leaving it untucked and pressing Draco into the brick wall to kiss him some more, he’d whispered against Draco’s mouth, “So, what d’you think?”
“Shut up, Malfoy.”
“Dad.”
. “I hate you.”
Harry looked up. “There’s no roof, Malfoy.”
“I’m fingering myself, Potter,” Malfoy replied quietly. “One finger – as requested.”

Harry turns his head, vision swimming slightly. “Malf...oy?” he slurs, blinking in bewilderment at the long, pale form as he folds himself onto the stool next to Harry's.
Or maybe it was just Harry. Maybe
“Dad, I need to wee.”
“Above average attractiveness,” Potter snorts, “Yeah, I don’t think above average attractiveness is what’s responsible for making me want to attempt doing a back-flip off my roof and trying to land on my feet.”
It’s stupefying and utterly terrifying a realisation and Draco doesn’t quite understand why his heart seems to be swelling rapidly and gleefully.
“No. James. I—Listen,” Harry looked over at Malfoy who was now fiddling with something in his cloak. “He’ll—He won’t let anything bad happen to you. And I need to make sure you guys aren’t with me so that if there’s another attack, I can save myself quickly and also know that you’re safe.”
The uncertainty, the weary, self-deprecating resignation, the continued mental torment – Draco catches all of it flickering behind the half-lidded green eyes. Harry’s going to be beating himself up over this for days, weeks, to come and Draco knows it'll be up to him to hold him up through it, keep him intact and pick up the pieces if he crumbles again. Draco’s done it before and he’ll do it again.
“It wouldn’t go down, not until I got sexually involved with my...” Harry trails off, eyes going big and round, before eventually bulging slightly, “...soulmate.”
“Those aren’t a thing,” Draco says after a dazed pause. “Alpha wolves...beta, omega...they—those aren’t a thing.”

Ron’s eyes brighten as he comes up to us; he creeps up behind Draco, motioning to us to be quiet with a finger on his lips, and at the last second, just as the blond brings his hand back behind his shoulder, Ron jumps forward with a roared, “HEY, MALFOY!” grabbing him around the neck, and Draco throws the dart about two feet to the left of the board with a startled squawk.
“You can’t let it upset you this much,” he says softly.
“Er... That I had to use the loo?”
But his eyes are sparkling with smug glee, with wicked triumph, and I have to work really hard at smothering the hysterical laughter that’s bubbling up my chest.

“You bet your perfect, Veela arse, I’m sure,” he growls, immediately grabbing said arse.
sucking his cock now, fights not to buck up into his glorious mouth, forcing himself to lie flat and still, legs shifting restlessly on either side of Malfoy. For the first time in days, in
“First of all, no you’re not,” Potter says quietly, watching as Draco peels off the fancy golden paper with trembling fingers. “Secondly, it’s not even something new, so just shut it.”
“Absolutely nothing! I’m sure he begged real sweet.” He waggles his eyebrows suggestively.
“I’m not going to dinner with you,” says Draco.
Draco blinks, mouth working soundlessly for a moment before he answers, “Um, I haven’t, no.”
Malfoy laughs all the way down the corridor. Harry thinks he’d like to be the one to make Malfoy laugh a lot more often.
Draco felt as though
Wheezing under the stab of Draco’s elbow, Harry half sits up, hacking in a combination of laughter and breathlessness. “Fuck, you’re a psycho.”
Potter shrugged exaggeratedly. “Yours and whomever it is you’ve been—” He paused, licking his lips over his smile and giving Draco the mere shadow of a wink, “—sexually active with.”
Except it made all the sense in the world.
Malfoy pants softly at him for a moment, eyes boring into Harry’s, before slowly dipping backwards, fingers curled around the lapels of Harry's leather jacket , long neck straining as he wiggles against Harry, before he fluidly rises back up, bringing his arms around Harry’s neck, lips brushing Harry’s ear as he whispers, “I’ll be counting on you not to let me go, Potter.”
“Sorry,” I mumble now, concentrating on pulling out another cigarette and lighting it. “Just tired, I guess...”
Draco doesn’t have much choice but to meet Potter’s flat, almost entirely black gaze because Potter still has Draco’s hair in his grip, fist tightening very close to the scalp so Draco can do no more than just about blink without risking having a chunk of his hair torn out. He wants so desperately to be angry, to feel humiliated, at being
“Harry and Weasley have met him,” Draco instantly retorts as he leans into me, quite unaware that he’s not standing upright. “Not that I care about what you believe,” he waves one hand, “Now be a dear and pour me another.” I pull back slightly and shake my head vigorously at Zabini.
Malfoy sighs and lets Narcissa take his hand again. “I’m quite well, Mother,” he assures her, patting her hand once. “I’m—You see, a few months ago...” He trails off and clears his throat again, slowly going pink in the face once more. Lucius is very still where he sits, barely blinking as he stares at Draco. “I met Harry in a club one evening when I’d skipped my—”
His breath leaves him on a long whooshing sound and one long, white hand flies down to wrap tightly around the base of his prick. I sit back on my heels and watch him, his bare chest rising and falling, his ribs visible where the skin stretches tight over them.
“You’re like an animal,” Draco said, talking over the devastated little cry that he’d nearly let out. “Only animals eat arse with this sort of unapologetic enthusiasm.”
The line of diamonds sparkled daintily up at him, the platinum band so shiny it was almost blinding. Draco stopped breathing entirely, his body turning hot and cold in turns, making him feel dizzy and discombobulated. He could feel his eyes bulging out madly and his mouth was very dry.
with an impossible amount of pent-up energy; Potter’s uncomfortable intensity, his incredible, careless strength – it ought to put Draco off, all of it.
Malfoy keeps his gaze on his own hands, his fingers long, skeletally thin and white, nails bitten down to the quick, lunulae standing out starkly in the pink beds. His right knee bounces furiously below the table, a single, hot gust of air blowing out his flared nostrils from time to time. He has his scraggly blond hair pulled back in a tiny ponytail at the nape of his neck, several bunches of the dry, straw-like strands escaping the elastic and framing his thin face, the ends of it just falling past his jaw. His lips are chapped and bright pink, his nose almost unnaturally straight, and his dark blond, fan like lashes flutter as he finally returns Harry’s gaze, just for a beat.
“And let’s not forget
“Yeah, I know that,” Harry said casually, adjusting his cock in his boxer shorts. “But what’d I
He grabs up his own bottle of water and drains it in one gulp before he jogs lightly towards Malfoy, the ground soft from the rains earlier, the air cool and dense with moisture. It takes Harry a practiced burst of control not to sprint towards the stands at full speed like a maniac but it wouldn’t do to startle him and everyone else present — as it is, his feet seem to barely hit the ground but by the time he reaches the stands, he’s trembling with the pent up energy his body is demanding he spend.
A few beats later, the front door slams shut and the thick silence around Draco is absolute.
“I thought I just gave you your quality present.” Harry laughed again as Draco smacked him up the head. “Hey, extended rim jobs are perfectly acceptable presents, you spoilt brat. Learn to appreciate the sm-- Ouch!”
“He’s perfect,” Potter croaks suddenly. “Or she. I don’t care either way. It’s perfect.”
“Yeah, I’m just going to be at home tomorrow.”
, Potter!” Draco yells as the tears finally spill. “I don’t fucking know! My owls always come back unopened and I don’t know if they’re getting the letters and sending them back or if the birds simply can’t find them. I don’t fucking know and I have no way to find out. I don’t know if they’re even alive.
There are vases full of thick, colourful bunches of luscious, fresh flowers everywhere; on both nightstands, on the desk, on the little glass-topped table near the chaise, and on the mahogany vanity against the wall across from the bed, there’s a wide, silver bowl heaped with a variety of brightly wrapped Honeydukes sweets. The windows are wide open and the room is bright, airy, sweet smelling and flooded with sunlight.
Harry pauses on the second floor landing, looking between the flat on his left and the sheet of tarpaulin hanging over the doorway on his right to where another flat should’ve been. There’s loose rubble and several slabs of brick and concrete sticking out from beneath the tarpaulin, the place clearly undergoing repair or remodelling.
“Ever the paragon of modesty.”
Ron chokes a bit on his rice but assiduously continues to scoop more into his mouth, his cheeks bulging. Hermione is straight-faced, fingers laced in front of her.
where all those kitchen towels are!”
“Don’t—” Potter starts but Draco has already chucked his wand across the room. It bounces off the wall and clatters across the floor. “Yes, because a broken wand always produces a perfect Patronus,” Potter says wearily, picking it up and coming over. “Let’s just call it a day, hm?” His fingers are warm where he gently strokes Draco’s nape.

“I didn’t see a Patronus.”
Harry snorted. “Yeah.” When Malfoy just shifted from foot to foot again, Harry sighed, “Sit

“How about we just throw him out the window instead?!” Draco spat, turning around and slapping Harry’s hand off his arse.
“Malfoy,” he murmurs warningly against Draco’s temple, somehow still sounding rather plaintive.
“Did you,” Potter breathes, bringing one hand up, “
The lie slips out smoothly. “Lost control of the broom. Is he okay?”
thing. I can’t read some of the bigger books. Father says I’m not old enough. He says they have longer words than I’m used to reading. But I don’t know if I believe him. You see, I think they have a lot of scary details about the war you won and he’s worried I’ll have nightmares.”
!” Draco kicks at the door, bouncing his hips and clenching his arse as he eagerly rides Potter’s stiff tongue, “Yes! Fuck!
“You’re very rude, you know,” Potter says conversationally. “First, you leave my place while I’m sleeping. And now you’re wringing my cock for making you breakfast.” He pauses and grins again. “Are you this callous with all your lovers?”
“Yes! It’s not unlike having a wand pointed at you!” Ron has the decency to look sheepish now. “It’s...unnerving, mate.”
“I suggested we go with a French press or something,” Granger said, looking slightly pained and very contrite. “I mean, we all know how much Draco loves fresh coffee ...”
“Thank you for your insight, you giant orang-utan,” Draco grits, his hands clenched around the edge of his desk. He did not need Weasley to come and sound out the very thought that’s been bouncing around inside Draco’s head for over a week – how
“I do. Right here.”
His Floo, thankfully, is not warded shut. I spin into his unlit living room and he’s stretched out on the sofa, barefooted, head on the armrest, holding an icepack to his nose. He doesn’t look around when I Floo in. For a moment, I’m terrified that he’s crying but when I approach, he looks perfectly composed. Carefully, I sit down next to him and place my hand on his chest.
?” He clenches his hands tighter, grinding Draco’s bones together.
But he needs Harry to let it go for now, for tonight.
“It’s the ancestral Black home,” Potter informs him with a snort. “You sort of have claim over it too, I suppose.”
Sure enough, when I pull the door open, he nearly tumbles over inside, landing half on me and catching himself with his other hand on the door frame. He straightens up and sways dangerously. His eyes are bloodshot and pink but he’s paler than ever as he stands there trembling, glaring at me. His hair is in disarray and he smells very strongly of alcohol.
, Draco is being spun around and pinned firmly to the door, Potter, on his knees behind him, ripping Draco’s trousers and pants down to his ankles. Yelping and scrabbling to maintain balance, Draco lets his legs be shoved wider apart and cranes his neck to look behind him with a shrill wheeze of disbelief when Potter roughly pries his arse open with both hands and plunges his face in.
It takes a few minutes for Draco to find Harry; he’s standing outside the tent, smoking.
“Draco,” Potter calls softly and despite himself, Draco pauses. “Thank you for telling me.”
to listen to Luna.
“Because he’ll need to add in a bit of hair for the suppressant to be successfully introduced into his bloodstream,” Hermione answers, staring curiously at Malfoy, “A bit of his own DNA. Malfoy,” Hermione’s eyes are suddenly bulging a bit, utter disbelief writ across her face. “Malfoy, are you a
I yank back and he makes a minute, barely audible sound of surprise, following my mouth for half a beat before immediately pulling away as well, leaning back and looking at me as though waiting for further instructions. He looks very innocent suddenly, as if he hadn’t been taunting me just a few minutes ago.
They spend the Christmas break apart, Potter at Weasley’s and Draco at the Manor, writing each other every day, and the evening they return to Hogwarts after New Year’s, they make love for the first time.
Later, many, many long minutes later, they huddle together on the sofa under the old patchwork quilt, the cooling sweat on both their bodies making them shiver and press closer, the wireless crackling softly, the sweet melody issuing from it stirring something in Draco’s mind to the forefront.
Harry nods without looking away from Malfoy’s face – the dark pockets under his downcast eyes and the way his mouth is turned down at the corners – and swallows, before croaking, “Yeah, I’ll head over after...after I’m done here.”
, Potter!”
“Hey!” I reply overly brightly, turning around, clutching the cheese plate. “Brie?” Like a fucking idiot, I tilt the cheese plate to display its contents. The wheel of brie which I’d charmed to be soft and slightly gooey, slides off and splats onto the floor.
They were nearly close enough to touch now.
Their mouths moved wetly together; Harry's mouth tasted of sunshine and pumpkin juice. His face was cool from having the wind cut across it for so long and Draco’s fingers moved warmly over his cheeks, their lips curling into identical smiles of shy delight at the same time.
“I’m sorry if I was being creepy,” Potter says solemnly, stepping even closer now.
he’s pulled his fingers out of my arse,” Draco murmurs, running a hand through Potter’s damp curls. He blinks when Potter draws back with a wry smile, his own mouth curving up, his cheeks darkening, before he pulls Potter down into a slow, almost unbearably intense kiss. His arse feels tender and overstimulated, his cock a sticky weight against his thigh, but Draco doesn’t think he’s ever felt this
“Why?” Potter asks calmly.
He waits until Potter has waved the man through the Floo before stepping into the room, stowing away his wand and walking in soundlessly, Potter’s back is still turned to him as he stands with his hands braced on the mantel, head hanging between his shoulders.
because I’m in love with him myself, fuck you.
Harry stares, exasperated. “I have my doubts about Samuel something being my soulmate, but I still don’t intend to take him straight to bed to bugger senseless, Ron.”
with promise.
“I never did manage to beat the rumours and get there first,” Draco smiles mirthlessly, “Anywhere I went, they already seemed to know. It’s okay, though,” he says quickly as Potter’s face darkens further, “I managed to keep afloat. Slug and Jiggers – the apothecary on Diagon? – my grandfather was one of the investors when it first opened so I was able to pull some strings. Helped out when they needed an extra hand, even brewed for them – they had fixed rates but they always paid me on time. I...” he swallows past the sudden knot in his throat, “I had to sell the watch I was gifted when I came of age but it did bring me a neat sum, so, I won’t—So, I won’t complain.” Draco swallows again and pauses a second, staring hard at the plush cream upholstery of the sofa. “Plus I have my personal vault at Gringotts,” he finally adds, blinking and noiselessly sighing through his nose.
“Do you want it to happen again?” Harry looked up now, straight into Malfoy’s eyes, and didn’t even bother to keep the hope out of his own voice. “Because I can’t tell if you do or not, Malfoy. It’s
“Do you, now?” he narrows his eyes at me.
he’s always feeling now. It’s only with some effort that Draco managed to retain his mask of impassivity in front of Granger and Potter during these appointments, and he hasn’t yet mentioned to either of them that he reads to the baby every night now. He supposes he ought to feel guilty for not offering to let Potter engage with the baby too, but he’s not sure he’d be able to sit there and watch the git

collection,” I spit and Draco laughs harder. “I hate you, I’m never going anywhere with you again. Where did you fuck off to anyway?” I prod suspiciously.
“You heard me.”
“What’s not a big deal?” Draco asks at once.
“At one point, he had his whole—”
The cufflinks were gold and in the shape of a sinuously wound snake, jaws stretched wide, tiny fangs, also gold, gleaming on either side of the emerald in its mouth. Its eyes, small pinpricks, were also studded emeralds. They’d mainly caught Draco’s fancy because the model who’d been wearing them in the picture had been rather good looking and had winked saucily at Draco. And it was just like Harry to have fucking remembered and bought them for him anyway, despite the fact that they were actual
“You mean you
“HARRY!”
“You’re with me just because I’m fit?”
“What were you and Harry talking about?” he asks suspiciously. Harry still stands by himself in the corner, staring fixedly out of the window, his cheeks maroon.
It’s unfortunate, really, that Potter’s saying all these things, and
He’s spent five years almost constantly in Malfoy’s presence, and Harry’s at a place where he knows he’d do
Ron snorts. “Yeah, we all know what that means,” he glares at Harry, “Doesn’t your cock ever get tired?”
Harry didn’t say anything for a while, absently running his fingers through Lily’s hair. Then, “Seems like an awful waste of time and energy, though. What if you get too weak to swing a sword?”
“But...it’s been over a week,” I finally say weakly while Ron continues to gape at Draco, mouth hanging open.
“Don’t follow on stealth mode next time.”
“Making breakfast,” Potter replies airily, turning back around and picking up the spatula in the pan. “You hungry? You look like you’re going to hurl, though.”
, all the press around my wolf thing, but—” He leans back, crossing his arms, staring off again, “I dunno if you remember how it was back when—you know, when I was bitten. I mean,” he laughs rather derisively, “Puddlemere had just won at Nationals – they barely acknowledged
Harry fumbled on his glasses and lifted the blanket; she immediately slid under it, burrowing into him. She had a dried leaf in her hair and in the dawn light, Harry saw the streaks of mud on her face.
Harry licks his lips. “You seemed pretty into it, yeah,” he says hoarsely.
He felt like an utter arsehole. Anybody who even vaguely knew Malfoy would know that it probably killed him to do what he did, to earn his living by being yelled at and snubbed by people over the phone. Harry felt an odd mixture of remorse and genuine sympathy for Malfoy.
They move as one, Harry’s hips never stopping, never pausing, Malfoy’s hands in his hair, and his quiet whines of pleasure keeping Harry going for way longer than he’d ever thought he could go. The sounds they both make are low and desperate, their grip on one another never loosening, but the pace that Harry sets doesn’t speed up, doesn’t turn demanding.
“Will you let me help you in some way?” Draco asks in a murmur, fingertips moving gently over Harry’s scalp. “Please?”
And then Potter says, very quietly, “Because I can’t anymore.”
“DAD!”
Neither talks for a while, and Draco just sits there, pressed into Harry’s side, playing gently with some of the strands escaping Harry’s low, tangled bun. To Draco’s relief, Harry leans into him, his heat enveloping Draco even though something about the way he’s resting against Draco makes it seem as if it’s Harry who’s seeking warmth.
“Where?” Malfoy says at once, craning his neck and staring over where Harry had vaguely gestured.
both, you mean,” Malfoy cuts in coldly. “
And it pisses the fuck out of Draco.
And that had been Draco’s first date with Harry. It had involved mostly a lot of strained politeness, lingering glances and curious questions. There had also been, eventually, plates of crisps, fresh fish and chips and casual touches and firmer eye contact. It had been past eleven when they finally decided it was time to head on home. Potter had insisted on paying and had said, with a shrug, “You can pay next time.”
“Harry,” he reminds calmly, his fingers now moving with slow ease, Draco’s hips jerking with each press into him. “Call me Harry at least when I have my fingers in you.”
“Now there’s an idea,” Ron ambles in suddenly, “I can give mum earrings for Christmas too.”
, you’re repugnant!”
“No judgement, Malfoy,” she says liltingly, one arm hanging loosely over the armrest as she drinks her wine, posture and manner completely relaxed, face impassive as she turns back to the TV. “My opinion here hardly matters.”
A wry smile. “No. But I knew you’d get there in the end.”
“I bought you new dress robes; they’re upstairs in your wardrobe,” Potter blurts out, looking mulish as Draco throws him a rather nasty glare. “I didn’t pick them out, so you don’t have to start about my appalling fashion sense or something,” he snaps before Draco can open his mouth. “The assistant at the store did and she said they’re currently...‘in’,” Potter says, making air-quotes.
“Can’t you...take it before you eat?” Draco asks quietly, handing over his napkin when Potter fumbles for and drops his.
your fault.”
“How was Ankara?” I gulp down some of my truly horrid, lukewarm coffee.
Gasping and twitching with every stroke, Draco let his eyes fall shut, his cock grazing the cool countertop each time he was thrown forward on a particularly savage thrust. Harry was grunting softly as he fucked him, his hand tangled firmly in Draco’s hair, his fingers bruising Draco’s hip. There was no restraint in the way he just
“Almost done,” Ginny said.
Draco doesn’t know which part of that sentence to take offence to first. “Are you here solely to tell me that Potter fancies me?”
“How’s he showing it?”
“Oh, yes,” Granger nods proudly, “Harry’s blood would prove most efficient at helping other werewolves in need of blood transfusions. No, he can’t pass his Alpha gene on through blood transfusions,” she says just as Draco opens his mouth to ask. “Like I said, that trait is innate.” She shuffles some parchments, throwing Potter a fond, if rather tired smile. “Harry doesn’t like to talk about it because he thinks it shouldn’t be blown out of proportion; he thinks people would have the exact same reaction you just did – that they’d all conclude that Harry Potter

to you. Do you think I regret it? Do
, Harry lifts his face, pulling his fingers out and lowering Draco back onto the bed, panting loudly. Draco forces his eyes open, finally releasing the tight clench of his teeth, and stares down with lust blown, glazed eyes, his expression likely as helplessly desperate as he felt.
“I think we should have Hermione help us with this for the time being, Malfoy,” Harry says quickly, noting the way Malfoy further stiffens, nostrils flaring. “It’s just more convenient this way. She’ll be happy to answer all of our questions and there’s the certainty of discretion with her so...we don’t have to worry about the press or anything for the time being.”
Draco feels his lip curl derisively. “What do you take him for? He’d be the last person to hurt me like that.”
– is lodged firmly against Potter’s groin, and Draco wants nothing more than for Potter to maybe twist his neck until it snaps so he doesn’t have to live through whatever is about to follow.
Only two weeks since he’d moved in with him and Draco is already more comfortable and at home than he’d ever been in that filthy hole he’d lived in all these years. Potter doesn’t get in his way and never pries when Draco keeps to his room, but when Draco does deign to make an appearance in the sitting room or for his meals Potter seems ridiculously pleased and more than happy to spend a while in Draco’s company.

Ron rolls his eyes as he shovels the last bit of pastry into his mouth, stands and picks up the case file I’d been perusing earlier. “Thanks, Em,” he says thickly to the slightly bewildered looking young Auror. “I’ll just be a sec.” She nods and quickly ducks out, Draco grinning and deftly dodging Ron’s attempt at smacking him on the head. “I’ll see you ladies later,” Ron calls over his shoulder as he leaves.
Malfoy smirks, gaze sharp and merciless. “To
Harry smiles at him, fiddling pointedly with his wand. “I’ll take that as a wonderful compliment, old man,” he says, tipping his head courteously. When he looks around, Malfoy is watching him intently, the reluctant amusement in his eyes unmistakable, his pink mouth soft and twitching as he holds back a smile.
For one breathless moment, Harry fully believed that Malfoy would sneer and walk away without taking his hand.
on me and whether or not I’ve been collecting my dosages--”
And perhaps some counsel.
Straightening up once again, swallowing dryly, Draco says, “And well, after the War,” he blinks, suddenly looking back up at Potter, “after I saw the way you and your friends fight for everything you believed in, after you saved my life...” Draco trails off as Potter smiles awkwardly and dips his head, “I—Well, I decided I don’t want to be keeping such a huge part of me, my identity, under wraps anymore. The curse could only be lifted by a direct descendant of the line, so after a bit of research, and a

“You are, yes,” Harry’s arms tighten around him, “and that’s all that matters.”

, Granger,” he says, voice so low and dangerous that Hermione looks rather startled, flushing and spluttering for a moment as she shakes her head.
“I really need a fucking assistant, Malfoy.” Harry grinned as he thumped a fist into his forehead.
“Since Tristan,” Draco sighs with a dreamy smile.
“Shut
Draco barely even processed what he’d said. He just stared at Harry’s bare torso with all its many tattoos, his gaze slowly proceeding further south, taking in the tight thighs and the lean calves and the big, long feet before going right back to that inviting mound in his black pants. When it twitched, Draco blinked and looked back up at Harry, feeling his face heat as Harry’s face slowly split into a grin.
“Look, just—just come in for an interview tomorrow? Level Two, 11AM? I’m sure he’ll hire you on the spot.”
it’s Ron who says, “Blimey. Fucking finally.”
“Nothing,” Hermione replies serenely. “I’m just...” she smiles warmly, “I’m just happy for you.”
He doesn’t complain like I’d expected him to. He stares at me, out of breath and clearly a bit unsure of what’s to follow, like he can’t quite put his finger on what I might do next. I pointedly undo his jeans and slide them off his legs; his endless, shapely legs covered in a fine, barely visible layer of golden hair. He points his toes like a ballet dancer as I peel the skin tight denim off. When I follow it up with a kiss to the arch of his foot, he jerks in clear surprise.

“Wait for what; for

Malfoy doesn’t reply, staring at Harry over the rim of his slim, frameless spectacles like he’s a purple Erumpet wearing a vivid pink tutu that spontaneously appeared out of thin air to perform an energetic entrechat for his entertainment. Harry waves a hand before his face when Malfoy doesn’t even blink for several long beats.
Draco doesn’t know what he’s doing here, not really; he’s had almost a week to think about it. But from the moment he watched that house-elf Disapparate, he’d known that he was going to do this. He can’t fathom
Draco remains silent for so long that Potter starts to fidget. “When else have you fought it off?” Draco asks quietly. “During the—Did

do both of you know?” Ron scrambles around on the sofa to sit cross-legged and glares at both of us in turn.
“Tell me,” he urges softly. “Am I—did I do something you’re not comfortab—”
“Good. I wasn’t joking earlier. I’m not nearly done with you.”
“Cheers.” Ron digs in enthusiastically. “You go meet your boyfriend yet?”
When Harry finally reached his cock, Draco was ready to pop. But Harry kept his hand wrapped around the base in a firm fist and Draco could only moan softly as Harry licked along the slit, sucked gently at the glans and teased his foreskin back with his lips, taking Draco in deep.
Prongs was back but the streak of white was so much dimmer. The house was swarming with them now. James crouched on the floor, arms over his head, as three dementors pressed in on him. Albus’s looked up, rather impassively, at the cloaked figure looming over him.
Except this time, Potter’s fingers coast along his crease, his other hand holding Draco wide open, sending Draco into a shivering frenzy as he locates Draco’s clenching hole and rubs it. Potter’s fingers are slick and slippery, and Draco momentarily wants to pause and find out how he’d managed

“Potter,
“I guess, that explains why the memory of you getting her doesn’t work,” Potter says gently.
“And what kind of stuff are
“Crushed,” Draco corrects, rounding his bench and taking a few steps closer to her.
Malfoy bares his teeth as Harry yanks at him, his cloak whirling around and catching on his arm before he wrenches it free and then uses both hands to shove forcefully at Harry’s chest, a growled yell leaving him as he pushes.
“Potter,” Draco says in a small voice, staring down at his own hands, “I’m sorry.” When he feels that penetrating, green gaze on him, he says, “For everything you know... For all those years of...” Unable to find a way to finish the sentence without spontaneously dying of embarrassment and shame, Draco just lets it hang between them pathetically.

“Malfoy,” Potter says airily and with a deceptively sweet smile, “what if you weren’t pregnant and I’d offered to help? Offered to let you move in? Would you have accepted? How many owls would I’ve had to have sent before you’d agreed to let me help? Be honest.”
It’s a bit sloppy. The angle is all wrong and I’m weirdly short of breath and keep panting in his face. Still, he kisses me back, sweetly and steadily, and when I pull away to draw in some air, he smiles happily, looking so fucking perfect.
It was taking a considerable amount of physical effort to stop himself meeting Potter’s gaze, now fixed so firmly on him that he could feel himself starting to sweat a little.
“I lost that job,” Malfoy tells her very blandly. “I had a lot of trouble finding another. And since I was warded out of the family property, I was informed I had no claim to the family vaults either,” he continues, glaring daggers at his father.
His legs shoot out straight in the air when Harry snarls and cleaves his tongue into Draco, the stiff muscle pushing in until Draco can feel Harry’s chin buried in his arse crack, his shoulders pressing into the bed as his back arches off it. He cries out then, prompting Harry to worm his tongue out and stuff it back in, wiggling it around in him with rapid little shakes of his head.

“Don’t do what?”
“Pansy said it would do something or the other,” he replies irritably. “I’m sure this is just some cheap crap from those horrid BeWitching Beauty pamphlets that she wanted to get rid of.”
“Ignore him, Draco,” Pansy hissed from across him.
“Who is it then?”
“I didn’t think this far,” he replies seriously, eyes twinkling. “
When Malfoy doesn’t move at all, Harry drags his gaze back to him to find Malfoy staring up at him, chagrined and resigned, almost as though he hates
“Wait—you said it’s just an inter--?”
Deeming them sufficiently busy, Draco draws the shower curtain with a quiet scrape and soaps up his cock, slightly hard by now just from the anticipation of a good wank. He rolls his fist over it in long, slippery strokes, soaping the folds of his foreskin and carefully reaching lower to soap his sac.

didn’t want to tell anyone in case it somehow affected our N.E.W.T preparations.” Harry frowned at him as Draco moved back to look at him steadily. “Well? We’re done with our N.E.W.Ts now,” he said pointedly while running his thumb over Draco’s still-wet lower lip.
“I think it’s the fact that it’s the first snow since the War or something,” Draco says, tone vague and rather flat. After a beat he turns to look at Potter only to find him frowning thoughtfully.
at her the whole time, until a helplessly giggling Neville had dragged him away, apologising profusely to her; Ron and Neville attempting to demonstrate to Seamus, Dean and Harry what a traditional wizarding ball dance looks like while people around them hurried out of the way muttering under their breath as Neville had vigorously spun and dangerously dipped an out of balance Ron.
“Because you don’t want to tell me or because you haven’t seen it yet?”
“Harry mentioned you two had lost touch.”

“Aren’t we friends?” Harry frowns, “We hang out almost every week with the rest of our lot. You helped me crack that case with that mummified dragon egg last month. We even eat lunch together somet--”
“I can feel it sometimes,” Potter says quietly and quite out of the blue. He’s staring into the fire, eyes slightly glassy. “I can feel it trying to rise up in me, like it’s trying to get out.”
With Lily on his hip, Harry led his sons into the kitchen. Another trunk, this one filled with dry provisions, bottled water, and fruit, sat on the dining table, magicked down to the size of a thick novel. Harry set Lily in her chair and brought the trunk back up to full size. He flung it open and Summoned two bananas. Then he locked it and shrunk it back down before shoving it into his undershirt.
Malfoy instantly looks aloof. “I’m not worried.” He turns away stiffly to resume staring out the window, absently rubbing his stomach with one hand as he watches a kid dressed as an astronaut screech as he fights over a large slab of chocolate with another little girl dressed as a witch. “

“He’s with that fucking
He rolls his eyes as Potter snorts, but when he looks up, his belly flutters at the way Potter’s eyes are trained fixedly on him, every last bit of his keen attention on Draco, his pupils dilated round and dark.
Harry didn’t follow Malfoy the next day; he did, however, go and throw himself into the seat across from him at his table in the library as Malfoy pored over no less than four different volumes of Ancient Runes, after dinner.
“Well,

“Malfoy?” Harry whispered it this time, unsure as to

and Potter cups his free hand over his mouth. Clawing at it, Draco can feel the panic rising in his chest just as fast as his cock is rising in his pants.
“When I have a cock in my mouth, of course,” Draco answers without missing a beat, Ron shutting his eyes and sighing, Seamus and Dean’s wolf whistles drowning out my own light sigh. “Tell me, moron, does a day go by without you pissing your wife off?”
“Will you shut up?” Harry mumbles, face burning. “I’ve not— It’s not— Oh, shut
“No,” Potter says slowly. “You’re rather a lot more accomplished than any of us were back then. Your magic does really pack a punch, Malfoy. You’re just not tryi—” he breaks off suddenly and looks rather pensive even as Draco glares at him as though daring him to continue. “You
“No, Potter, but I really can’t accept any of your food. You have more children than I do.”
“In a room full of witnesses.”
“What do
“Well,
a hole in her arse?!”
Potter bends down and kisses him hungrily, sucking on Draco’s mouth before shoving his tongue in and licking around, one hand still firmly fisted in his hair, the other cupping his cheek. Draco leans in, standing up on his knees and dragging Potter closer by the hair to kiss him harder, gasping as Potter reaches down and practically lifts Draco onto his lap.
risk something happening to you both, especially for a stupid joke. I’m so sorry.”
Malfoy walks in, his rectangular, frameless glasses perched on the tip of his nose as he peers closely at a long scroll in his right hand, an enormous pile of colourfully labelled files clutched in the crook of his left arm. He’s garbed in neatly pressed grey trousers with a spotless white shirt tucked in, crimson and bronze striped tie knotted in a perfect double Windsor. His hair is as pale and shiny as ever, combed neatly into place, just a few errant strands falling across his brow. A fancy eagle feather quill is tucked behind one pink ear and there’s a smudge of green ink on his razor sharp nose.
“Harry?” Hermione’s voice sounds very far away and Harry realises Malfoy’s watching him with an odd look on his face.
It’s unplanned and clumsy and frantic and entirely too sweet, and Draco is mindless throughout, gasping out expletives the whole two minutes that Potter spends inside him, rocking unsteadily and groaning softly. He barely makes a sound as he flies over the edge, dragging Potter along too, and lies trembling in Potter’s arms afterwards, silent and overwhelmed.
“You don’t say.” I don’t look at him –
. And Merlin knows Lucius Malfoy would deserve it.”
“I...just didn’t think it would lead anywhere.”
It was small, just a few months old, Weasley announced, and had pure white fur and its nose and ears were very pink and it made strange, squeaky chattering noises and Harry had instantly been delighted, carefully accepting the creature from Weasley’s hands and cradling it, cooing at it and kissing its pointy snout.
“We fucked.”
“Fuck you.”
And it was after that next time that Draco, being pressed up against the wall in the alley behind the restaurant they’d dined in, had asked, between furious, wet kisses, to see Potter’s tattoo. Potter had grinned and pulled his neatly tucked shirt out of his crisp trousers, pulling it off over his head and turning to show Draco the bold black lines of the outline that stretched across Potter’s back. The stag’s head, situated between his sharp shoulder blades, was tilted back proudly and its antlers stretched all the way up to his shoulders. On the stag’s head was a wreath of lilies. There was no colour or anything flashy about it whatsoever, but Draco was left breathless as he ran his fingertips over the lines of the tattoo.
Because the next second Harry had grabbed him by one arm and dragged him to the counter, twisting his arm and pressing it to his back, grabbing the bathrobe and flinging it into the sink. Placing one hand just below Draco’s nape, Harry shoved him forward, bending him over, and without any sort of warning kicked Draco’s legs wide apart.
“We could, ah, go upstairs, I guess?” Potter suggests, hurrying past Draco to lead him down the hallway. He smells like sweat and earth and petrol and there shouldn’t be anything so wildly appealing about any of that but Draco wants to stick his nose against Potter and breathe him in. It’s wildly embarrassing and Draco keeps his head dipped and blush hidden as he follows Potter upstairs in silence.
Finally I clear my throat and straighten my back. “Erm. So, I’ve been out of town and just got back. So I’m not really sure what’s going on. Is—is Simon okay? What happened?”
“What?” Harry rasped in confusion.
backwards, flying off the bed so violently that he ends up slamming the back of his head into the wall opposite the bed. Malfoy shrieks, scrambling up, endless arms and legs flailing about wildly, pale hair mussed beyond recognition. He sits up in a kneel, looking around the room as though expecting to be violently attacked, before glaring at Harry with irritated incredulity.
I don’t expect him to actually use his wand. But then with a heavy flick of his wrist he’s thrown a jet of red light at me.
“Are you even really working on that essay?” Hermione’s voice made him jump a little and Harry looked around guiltily at his parchment; he’d written the date, the title (Zark’s Theory of Cross-Species Transfiguration) and had three lines of introduction which he’d basically just copied down verbatim from the textbook.
. Draco isn’t even pretending to read the book in his own lap –
“It’s that article,” Hermione says quietly, later that evening.
clean. The flagstones underfoot have been scrubbed spotless, and the copper pots and pans hanging overhead gleam blindingly bright. There’s an enormous, stone fireplace on the opposite wall where a fire crackles brightly, what appears to be an empty stew pot sitting on the floor beside it. There’s a large cooking range on the left, atop which sits a frying pan, sizzling quietly, while a tea kettle hums to itself on the counter beside it. Some sort of Muggle coffee appliance sits next to the kettle, and Draco can see, as well as smell, the rich aroma of the dark brown, steaming hot liquid in the tall, glass pot.
“Malfoy,” she says, crossing her arms again, frowning lightly.
“She rarely likes to talk about work during her off time, so I’m sure it’ll be alright.”
Harry licked his lips, barely aware of his own unblinking staring until Malfoy waved his hand rudely under his nose.
“Tell me what you want,” Harry breathes, finally drawing away long enough to be able to talk. “Tell me how you want to—tell me what you want.”
rare and really hard to find – even Slug and Jiggers didn’t stock half of them and they’re London’s primary apothecary.”
Heart pounding in his ears, he follows, landing with a slight stumble outside Grimmauld, the front door hanging open but Malfoy nowhere in sight. Leaping up the front steps, Harry storms in, throwing his bag onto the floor and roughly kicking his new boots off before he takes the stairs three at a time, loud, obnoxious stomping thudding from above. Barely pausing for breath, Harry catches up with Malfoy as he’s stalking down the corridor to his room, grabbing him by the arm and spinning him around.

“We were only
any of them to be.”
“Have you ever tried?”
Steadfastly ignoring the paranoia mixing into the warmth in his belly, Draco sits down and throws Potter a little smile of his own when he lowers the paper at once and draws his chair up like Draco, watching rather happily as Draco digs into his omelette and sausages.
“I thought it made you uncomfortable,” Harry replies, and there’s no room for dishonesty in his tone. “I thought
I shrug, eating a bite of chicken and rice just for something to do, pushing the food around my plate, feeling restless and unhappy.
But still, he’d believed that it would
“Both.”
“I mean, it makes no sense if you think about it?”
The old building is even grottier and more derelict that Harry remembers it being and he realises in hindsight that he ought to have checked this place first thing, three hours ago. Ignoring the grizzly old witch on the ground floor, sitting at her window and staring curiously at him, Harry flings open the rickety front door, nearly pulling it right off the single hinge it’s hanging dismally from, and hurtles up the stairs.
With a burst of effort that drains me of everything I possess, I yank myself away from him. For a second, he surges forward, following my mouth. Then he goes still. He’s not pale anymore but flushed a frantic pink. His lips are pink too, swollen and wet, his eyes wide, dark with arousal and wondering. He’s panting, wheezing, through his mouth. I can see the bulge of his erection in his jeans.
Draco is immensely grateful and violently angry, simultaneously, because it’s the weekend.
“Yeah,” Harry bobs his head with a sardonic smirk, “

“See you later, ferret.”

Malfoy is quiet for a very long time, still ignoring Harry’s proffered hand. Then, “I suppose I’ll need the time to pack my things,” he says softly, his expression hardening.
“So?” He can hear Lydia greet customers out front with her usual sunny cheer.
“I. Don’t. Care,” Malfoy says, his teeth showing with his exaggerated pronunciation of each word. “We just fuck, Potter, you and I. I can respect that.” He crosses his arms, his gaze glacial as his mouth slowly twists into a nasty little smirk. “And I’m willing to bet
Grimacing slightly he turns to look at Granger who’s, to nobody’s surprise, standing beside the wall of books with her arms filled with about six, enormous tomes. She’s
Draco has his head on my shoulder and is oddly quiet as he simply sits there with his eyes closed. I feel an inexplicable sense of satisfaction that it’s
Swallowing hard, I finally look up, seeking out Draco once more, and my stomach drops.
I pour us both some champagne, splashing large quantities of it onto the coffee table. When I hand him his glass, my hand is shaking so much that I accidentally spill some on his jeans.
Sticky-eyed and still half asleep, Draco stumbles into the kitchen and stops short at the scene that greets him: Harry, a paisley apron thrown on over his joggers and rumpled t-shirt, standing behind the centre island and poring intently over a large cookbook. Scorpius, still in his pyjamas, is sitting
Harry holds the tumbler with both hands, his expression vacant, head bowed, fierce, viridian eyes filled with pure, unfiltered anguish as he stares emptily at the floor. Draco’s stomach churns as he once again takes in the shapeless, damp patches of stickiness on his robes, the colour blending into Harry’s maroon uniform.
“I have another birthday gift for you,” he blurts suddenly, mouth still hovering inches from Harry’s.
Draco swallows hard, staring at it unblinkingly for far too long before hurriedly snapping out of it. “Oh,
He doesn’t wait for her to reply before turning around and striding away, making his way back to the little private lab he’d spent an extra fifteen thousand Galleons on when he’d bought the place.
Harry undresses him with an excruciating gentleness, plucking his clothes off him with a meek tentativeness that he’s never displayed before, running calloused hands over him with a sort of reverent tenderness, thumbs stroking over pink, tightly beaded nipples, open mouth running along the insides of Draco’s thighs propped on his sturdy shoulders as he kneels on the floor.
One of the many,
you would cheapen this in some way. Why can’t you just be a
“Yeah?” Potter replies at once, leaning forward attentively as he comes around.
Harry grins despite himself. “You’re insufferable, Malfoy.”
“So let’s fix that,” Malfoy whispers, yanking Harry’s head forward with the hand still caught in his hair.
He’s assaulted with vivid flashes of the previous night: the massive, black wolf, crouching in one corner as Draco entered, its low, rumbling growls making Draco erupt into gooseflesh; the way Draco had stood there for nearly half an hour, still and unmoving, hands raised before himself to make clear his wholly benign presence. The way he’d nearly screamed for Kreacher, his voice caught somewhere down in his chest, when the wolf had finally risen and lolloped over to him, limping slightly, stopping in front of him before butting its head against one of Draco’s hands.
“No, we had a—”
“Second degree burns from a potions accident,” Malfoy replied curtly.
and I don’t want you to be alone at any point! You goddamn
“Oh, go on then,” she waves one hand, “I’m sick of you hovering around me like an anxious crup.”
He was hazily floating on a cloud somewhere up in heaven, Harry’s fingers digging thoughtlessly into his soft bottom, his teeth scraping over Draco’s arsehole every few seconds. The sheets beneath him felt too hot and the room seemed to turn blurry and spin every time he let his eyes flutter open.
The kids?
“Harry!” Draco let out a startled yelp as a hand suddenly closed around his ankle and lifted his shoe-clad foot onto one sturdy shoulder. “Merlin, warn me, dammit.” He whined in disappointment when his cock was abandoned rudely, Harry moving down to catch Draco’s balls in his mouth for a quick suckle before he moved his mouth lower, so he could nibble at his arsehole again. “I was
Potter grins slightly but it’s only after several more beats of painful hesitation that he speaks. “Why...were you living in that—living there, Malfoy?” he asks carefully. “How did you land up there?”
“What else have you been lying to me about?”
“I didn’t ruin it the very first time,” Potter sniggers against Draco’s jaw, nipping lightly, “Hell, I barely remember the first time,” he adds as an afterthought, sounding rather morose about it.
“Hmm. Malfoy is particularly good at that sort of thing. I think he’s mentioned how he used to watch the elves at the Manor decorate the place. And well, he does have excellent taste. He always does a fantastic job of doing up your place.”
“Last night! You fucking vanished! Do you know whom I got stuck listening to prattle on and on?!”
“You really thought hiding the ring box in that little idiot’s nest was a good idea?” Draco asked, picking up his wand and turning to raise an eyebrow at Harry, although he couldn’t help the accompanying grin.
Harry’s gaze lifted and in the flickering light from his wand, there was a flash of, not silver, but gold.
It’s unnervingly quiet, Harry shuffling in quickly, looking around with his hand closed around his wand in his pocket as though he’s expecting to be jumped by a tome wielding old crackpot yelling ancient magical theories at him. There’s hardly anyone around though, just two witches poring over enormous, crumbling volumes at one of the tables, barely even glancing up at Harry as he hurries past, looking around desperately for that distinctive, bright head of white-gold.
“Fancy. What’s he looking for?”
Malfoy sniffs and lifts his nose high, although his eyes are still sparkling with mirth. “I’ll think about it, Potter.”
Their tongues meet almost immediately, neither of them bothering with slow, gentle kisses, and Potter’s got a hand just above Draco’s nape, right below the point his braid starts, fingers tightening in the roots as he gently guides Draco’s head into an angle he can better kiss Draco at.
“I already
Then Potter deftly buries two fingers into Draco’s arse until his knuckles are bruising the soft, clenching rim.
“To be with you.”

Never for one second had he
Then they’re both panting, completely winded, Harry’s hands slowly sliding up the cooling sweat on Draco’s back, Draco’s cheek plastered to Harry’s damp chest. The calm silence between them is somehow more significant than anything either of them could’ve said in the moment.
“Thank you,” he says abruptly, and Draco raises his eyebrows. “For...caring at all,” Potter clarifies, that small smile back. “My transformation went fine,” he adds shortly, not elaborating further, even after Draco waits in expectant silence.
“What...is the reason, then?” Draco asks warily.
“I can
“Thank you, Potter,” Malfoy said stiffly. “You can fuck off now.” He still had only arm inside the shirt and Harry realised that in the confused mess that had followed when he’d attempted to investigate the moans, he’d completely forgotten that Malfoy had very likely been having a wet dream – right before he’d
“Right.” Harry set down the trunks, picked up Lily and led the boys a little ways into the trees.
“No, I didn’t,” Draco bites out, before quickly plastering on a grin, and I exhale silently. “Stuff happened immediately after he said it, so...” The wink he gives Seamus makes me nauseous.
if that
“I’m sorry,” Harry said automatically.
“Fuck off.” The fondness in my voice isn’t unusual but it unnerves me anyway – I’m terrified that he might figure out how I now feel.
Potter meets his gaze calmly, like he’d known all along that Draco’s been watching him but couldn’t, until that very moment, be bothered to return his gaze.
Harry’s grip tightened around his handful of his bum and Draco muffled a squeal. “About us.”
“No, please listen to me,” I say desperately.

Both of them remain silent, staring off in opposite directions, Malfoy’s face as pink as his own probably is, bearing the same shock he himself feels. “Sorry,” Harry eventually mumbles again.
Harry fucked him slowly with just the one finger until Malfoy’s breathing was ragged and his arse clenched around his finger every time he pulled out. When his finger finally slid in and out without resistance, Harry paused for more lube and added another.

“I wasn’t at risk,” Draco says automatically, jutting his chin out even as his voice trembles and his stomach plummets a little.
He curled them tightly as Harry placed a soft kiss to his instep, just to soothe Malfoy (and truthfully, maybe even himself) before deliberately pushing his legs open wide. Stretching himself out in between, Harry took a second to try and calm his hysterically shrieking brain.
“You used to live with me. Things change.”
Potter tucks Draco’s hair behind his ear, his other arm tightening around his back. “I believe Hermione said they’d be here around seven,” he blinks, tilting his head, “Why?”
“Milk and two sugars,” Draco accepts with a tilt of his head. Potter watches him as he neatly pulls his gloves off, lifting the expensive suede off each finger before inching them off and laying them on the table in front of him, clasping his hands upon them. “What?” he sighs, when Potter doesn’t even blink.
“Is that right?” Malfoy sniffs, raising an eyebrow sceptically. “What’d you last cry about?
Then Prongs was there. Almost as tall as Ginny’s horse, he blazed a trail of blinding white light as he put his head down and charged at a group of at least fifteen dementors, forcing them back out the front door.
“It’s...hormones or something,” Harry says awkwardly. “Nothing to be ashamed of... Hey,
Draco starts in place, blinking around at Potter who’s watching him with a gentle little smile. “Even though this

Harry blinked. He was on the floor. He’d fallen. Lily was on the floor next to him, silent and unmoving. He had fallen over with his three year old in his arms and now she wasn’t moving. There was a thick blanket of cold darkness being forced over him. People were screaming. Wait. His

He’s finishing for the third time since he woke from his nap but this one is, by far, the most ferocious. Draco’s whole body seizes up, his bare, sweaty legs locking, fingers clamping cruelly tight under his cockhead, his arse clenching madly around Potter’s tongue. He’s mouthing silently, his throat bobbing as he tries to swallow, his eyes rolling back into his head as he clutches his stomach with his free hand and arches into the door.
“Frighteningly beautiful?"
Sobbing, Draco helplessly presses back into it all over again. “Potter,” he whispers,
“No no,” Hermione smiles, glancing up, “There are potions now, of course, that facilitate wizards to bear children if they desire.”
“Fuck,” Potter breathes, his head falling back and his hips canting out when Draco pushes his thumb into the slit and massages until a clear dribble of precome oozes out.
I feel like someone’s punched me in the gut, feeling breathless as my face turns warm.
“You’re literally the most irritatingly generous person I know.”
Harry swallows again, this mouth and throat suddenly dry, his cheeks slowly flooding with heat. “It doesn’t matter, really,” he replies, shrugging. “People will think what they want to think.”
“I had on new shoes and they were biting me!” he whimpers. “Can’t

“Well,
“Nothing to apologise for,” Potter says lightly, not seeming offended in the least that Draco hadn’t paid attention to something that was such a vital part of Potter’s life. “Not your fault.”
Harry drank his beer and Malfoy stared at the floor. Across the room, the children now had smears of chocolate on their faces along with the mud, and they were all, Lily included, giggling madly at something Scorpius was saying, Scorpius himself hardly able to hold in his giggles long enough to speak.
Malfoy’s lip curls, his cold, totally unimpressed gaze slowly moving up from Harry’s flapping cock, to his bright, excited expression. “You really are a fucking freak,” he hisses poisonously, “and a total fucking arsehole.” Malfoy kicks himself angrily out of Harry’s bed, picking up his discarded shirt off the floor while shooting Harry another glare that’s pure, venomous fury.
and Harry had grimaced and sullenly wished for better friends as he’d obeyed.
“You want to come?”
Looking curious more than excited, Potter obeys, stretching out on top of Draco and immediately kissing him again, the stag pendant pressing bluntly into Draco’s chest. There’s a wet spot in Potter’s boxers where his erection is seeping, but he seems most content to simply rut against Draco’s own renewed boner.
“Please what?” Harry presses, his own limbs breaking out in gooseflesh at the way his voice comes out a cruel croon; his cock is an aching weight inside Malfoy, his hips and back aching with how hard he’s pistoning in and out of him.
you made in class?” I ask incredulously, my voice echoing.
, and the tourmaline pendant he’d given me feels like a hot brand against it. My hand goes slack next to me, the Snitch flying away serenely, flitting between everyone’s head in a hypnotic dance while I stand there drenched in realisation, my stomach solidifying into lead, sweat breaking out across my forehead.
He’s left a large, horribly vivid red bite mark on Malfoy’s nape. It oozes lightly, the skin only just broken so that the punctures are already clotting rather than bleeding freely. It’s purpling around the edges of where Harry’s canines sunk in and the skin all around the bite is bright pink.
“Which by itself is enough to confirm suspicions,” Hermione says, nodding.
“Like what?” Harry pulls back when Malfoy doesn’t answer, “Like what, Malfoy?”
“Nothing happens if I miss a dose,” Potter says easily. “One time I developed a slight fever but it broke overnight. The other time I forgot, I was just really worked up and jittery by the end of the day. ‘s nothing uncontrollable; werewolves survived years without Wolfsbane, and then several more years with consuming it just a few days a month.

, of course, but I think it’d be prudent of us to—” Harry babbles blindly as one pale eyebrow slides slowly up Malfoy’s high forehead.
“He’s my
His gaze was on Harry.
With a final noisy suck over his nipple, Draco straightens back up, breathing noisily through his mouth, throat rattling. Swiping his slick hand impatiently through his own crease, Draco settles into place, only briefly using his hand to line Harry’s cock up to his rim, finding the tip with an easy swivel of his hips and bearing down to keep it in place.
up at him, biting pointedly at his lip until it crunches open and bleeds into Harry’s mouth. Undeterred, Draco continues bouncing on a gradually building tempo, murmuring nonsense against Harry’s lips as he babbles Draco’s name over and over, wrists pliant in Draco’s grasp but hands clenched into trembling fists.
Potter’s strangled, helpless cry of pleasure cracks around the room, leaving Draco’s hair on end. Hands descend on his head, needy and clinging, and Draco barely even feels as his hair is gently pulled.
time, Draco feels severely incompetent, not to mention thoroughly ashamed at the way his own throat closes up.
with you!” howled Draco, drawing his wand and simply levitating the fridge out of the way, the huge mass of metal hovering precariously in the air, the electric cord strained, the plug nearly falling out of the socket.
“Well, fuck,” Draco drawls, promptly shifting his foot back there, “as someone who currently flies every
Then the Invisibility Cloak, folded neatly, suddenly landed next to him.
Swallowing hard, the lump in his throat aching, Draco slowly turned around. For one wild moment he thought Harry had left. But then he looked down to see Harry on one knee, his face scarlet as he wrung his hands anxiously, chewing on both lips.
It felt like an appropriate moment to say it, so Harry said, “You know I’m genuinely grateful to you, right? Really. Last night...and...earlier today at Godric’s Hollow...”

, I am pulling ahead of him. I’ve already left him somewhere near my ankles as I pull ahead, my arm outstretched, fingers straining to feel the cool metal and the silver wings against my knuckles, my heart thundering in my ears as something that feels like white hot lava floods my veins, coursing through every last inch of me and I swear I feel like I’m about to spontaneously combust and take half the planet with me.
,” Harry blurts out, before sighing and adjusting the bundle of his work robes in his lap. “Why’d you have to go and get so hot?” he mumbles mournfully into his own drink. “’s really distracting.”
Harry whips around so fast that he sends one of the empty mugs set on the counter flying. It crashes into the wall near the door and Malfoy flinches as the ceramic splinters into a hundred shards. Harry can’t see or hear anything through the high pitched ringing in his ears as he advances on Malfoy who hurriedly takes a step back only to fall back in a sprawl into his chair, chest heaving as he pants loudly.

Damn the chivalrous bastard.

like he’s imagined.

“He asks,
Something much larger than your average biscuit toppled out of the folds of the t-shirt and Draco paused, scowling, as he flung the T-shirt aside and made a grab for it. It was a small, black, velvet-covered box and Draco turned it over and over in his hands for a few seconds, frowning down at it.
“Unfortunately.”
Harry smirks, wide and smug. “I’m not a vanilla prude,” he repeats simply.
“Why would Ginny want to poison you?” Harry asks calmly, reaching over to gently buff a knuckle across his soft cheek. Malfoy just stares flatly at him like he’s an imbecile. “Malfoy, she and I dated ten

“No, but still,” Draco mumbles. “You could’ve done something nicer. After the extravagant display you planned for my birthday, I mean it’s the le—”
with Potter in general.
Lip curling, Draco rolls them over before sitting up and flipping Potter onto his front. Potter yelps and flails wildly for a moment before lifting up onto his elbows and looking over his shoulder in shock.
But Draco isn’t listening anymore, for Draco has had such a sudden, brilliant brainwave, that his head
Potter stares warily at Draco, then at the vial, and then with a careless shrug, plucks out the little cork, and downs the mouthful of potion with only a slight shudder.
“Or maybe he’s
“Er... Yeah, I don’t think so, ‘Mione.” Potter doesn’t look at her as he speaks, half turning away and partially hiding his face as he mops it with one end of the towel.
“It’s not work when we’re all at The Leaky, though?”
With their respective new jobs and schedules it had taken them nearly two and a half months to finally find a place they both really liked and agreed upon and another six weeks to finalise the deal and finish moving in.  An additional month to finish setting up home and they were finally able to throw a housewarming party.
“I got plenty drunk that night at the club.”
Harry thumbs Draco’s jutting lower lip before holding his chin in a gentle pinch and bringing his mouth down to his own. “I’m pretty sure there’s all of one specimen of my preferred type,” Harry says softly against Draco’s mouth, “And I’m happy to report that I’ve already snagged him for myself.”
“So why not call it a ‘she’?” he snaps before huffing and throwing himself carelessly onto the sofa, giving Harry a mild aneurysm. “The rate I’m growing, you likely won’t have to wait very much longer,” he mutters darkly, glaring down at his stomach where it’s protruding threateningly, practically a separate entity by itself. “I’m done housing it, Potter. I want this to be over.”
“You—”
The current state of my life makes me yearn for the days when Voldemort would always be trying his best to kill me. Such a simple life it was back then.
you both, Malfoy?”
absurd.
Harry was getting Lily’s shoes on while calling to James and Albus to get their coats on; because it’s cold outside, Albus, and you have two different shoes on; James, help him, please.
Leaning forward in confusion, Draco watched Moody hop awkwardly around the large bundle of material, tripping over it, when it suddenly struck him that—
Draco keeps his eyes shut, his chest tight and painful as he tries to breathe in fully. He’s so close to what he knows is going to be a completely devastating orgasm that he’s teetering on the edge of consciousness just from the anticipation. His arse aches exquisitely around Potter, convulsing pathetically as though trying to force him back out. His own cock pressed flat along the curve of his belly under Potter and
“It’ll go away,” Malfoy gritted out. “Stop being a freak or I’ll--”
“Well, it’s not like I plan to marry him so it’s really no big deal.”
Because Malfoy is licking at his balls now, pulling them turn by turn into his mouth and lightly pinching the thin skin between his lips. He’s rubbing the smooth, spongy head of Harry’s cock around his mouth, down over his chin and up along one cheek, leaving shiny trails of slimy precome that glisten in the moonlight pouring in the from the window.
It’s a small, square room, bare but for an overstuffed sofa against the back wall piled with a few cushions, a pitcher of water and two goblets on a low, end-table beside it.
about him now, something that makes Draco wonder whether he himself carries an air of having grown up too fast, too soon as well, or whether it was just Potter.
He doesn’t wonder for long. At 11:42PM on Saturday, his front door is nearly razed down by a ham of a fist pounding at it, and when he opens the door and finds Potter standing there, he doesn’t even blink before stepping back and letting him enter.
“You’d know,” Harry says, pointedly lifting his hips so Draco can feel the ever-growing bulge in his pants.
Without looking at him, Malfoy laces their fingers together and squeezes, and Harry’s exhale of shocked delight is a sharp puff of air.
“Didn’t we decide to hold off on knowing whether it’s a he or she?” Malfoy replies, eyes already falling shut again. “Read to your offspring, Potter; pick any other book you like. I’m likely going to be asleep before you open it anyway.”
ed lightly, knowing there was absolutely
He slaps a hand down onto the man’s shoulder, squeezing hard enough for him to flinch in pain as he turns to scowl at Harry. “Fuck off,” Harry says mildly, but there must have been something in his expression that’s not entirely mild because without even blinking, the man instantly raises both hands in capitulation and backs away, disappearing into the crowd.
James sat by himself in a far corner, knees drawn up to his chest, crying quietly. When Harry tried to go up and sit with him, offer him comfort, James shook his head and elbowed him away. Helpless and slightly hurt, Harry went back to Lily.
“Curse Breakers work alone,” Draco daintily tears the crust off the sandwich with forefinger and thumb.

I’m standing here pretending that I didn’t just push his boyfriend off his broom in a fit of utterly
His thoughtful expression is so affected that I roll my eyes. “Most of them,” he says loftily, and I roll my eyes again.
Harry stares at him for a long moment, expression pained and turbulent, eyes slightly wild. He releases Draco and steps back, turning away and raking a hand through his hair before sighing and facing Draco again. “I—it’s the full moon in a couple of days,” he says, voice gravelly and strained.
“Draco,” Harry chokes out, falling forward, one hand scrabbling for the headboard, the other securely cupping Malfoy’s stomach, his orgasm slamming into him so hard that he blacks out completely, simply squeezing his eyes shut and hurtling over the edge.
“Uuuh, because he’s
Malfoy nods, eyes glinting wickedly. “Have you?” he asks softly. Harry nods as well, his hand still on the smooth bump of Malfoy’s stomach. “How was it today? What’s it like trying to train a bunch of mediocre players who won’t stop trying to grope you?” Malfoy’s tone is one of lilting nonchalance, but Harry sees the way his eyes narrow.
“When did you both leave?” Malfoy demands right away, his chin trembling for a beat before he firms it. “
“Are you implying that
“I did.”
“If Harry really is the other father of your child then you have

“Do not,” Lucius begins slowly in a low rumble, “tell me that the child is
relieved. “There’s this bloke George hired to help with the shop,” he says brightly at once. “Samuel something. Should I...er—Will you be doing like a dinner or something first? Or—you know, just straight away--?” He gestures to where Harry’s cock is standing at full mast under his desk.
“The DMLE didn’t even know they’d left the country until I told you about this,” Harry hisses through clenched teeth. “This isn’t even a chargeable offence as of now; not until they’ve been found guilty of performing actual Dark Magic of some sort in the last ten years.”
“No, you’re right,” she says. “He couldn’t have. Luckily enough, he had me to give us you. And darling,” she leans forward, expression kind, “I was out of shape for over a year after I had you. And despite all my self-consciousness, your father was lovely about it.”
Draco hurriedly straightens up, jerking his chin at the door. “What’d you wish for, then?”
“Shut it, you bint,” he says fondly. “Go shower; you smell like a Hippogriff.”
“Move in with me,” Harry repeats. “Move into Grimmauld Place with me.” Malfoy still looks like he’s waiting for the punchline, so Harry hurries to continue, “There’s plenty of room, Malfoy, and I have an elf who cooks and cleans and you’d not want for a thing over there.”
Delighted, Harry lifts his head to stare at him brightly, and when Draco simply sniffles and scowls at him, Harry kisses him again, slow and deep.
, anything;
“It makes me anxious to be away from you for too long,” Potter says abruptly, voice slightly gruff. Heart flipping over excitedly, Draco just stares at him in silence. “Even more so lately,” Potter adds softly, eyes sliding down to the swell of Draco’s bump, a sliver of skin visible where the buttons on his pyjama top strain slightly.
And there they are in the
“Would it help soften the knot if I panicked and thrashed about?” When Harry starts laughing again, Malfoy slants him a smirk over his shoulder. “I’m just learning not to be surprised about all these impossible feats only

“Because you’re trying to behave like it’s not a big deal!” Draco realises he sounds decidedly hysterical now. “Like

“...I’m calling about our top of the line torches, sir--”
Hermione smiles and wipes her hands on the bright yellow apron she’d borrowed from Mrs. Weasley. “Malfoy. And you must be the much talked about boyfriend,” she adds, leaning one hip into the counter.
Draco went very still, feeling like he’d been slapped. Weasley had gone purple in the face. Potter had his face in his hands and Granger looked utterly aghast.
“And why the moonlight now, at this stage?”
“No,” said Scorpius. “I wrote it and rewrote it half a dozen times. But I never did send it.”
“Theo asked me to marry him.”
His back ripples and swells under Draco’s fingers, the skin smooth,
Frowning slightly, Potter nods. “Yes, I said that fighting the wolf off is like—”
James looked stricken. “I thought... If you went away too...”
Harry didn’t say anything further; he just rested his chin on laced fingers and stared unabashedly at the snooty Pureblood sat in front of him.
“He’s
Neither spoke again for a few seconds until Malfoy asked, in a very small voice, “Are you going to tell people about my job, Potter?”
Potter seems to consider that very carefully. “Can Dementors actually laugh?” he asks curiously.
They eventually do make it up to Draco’s dorm room which lies halfway up the spiral staircase that leads out of the common room. There’s a pane of glass next to each bed and the Lake glows eerily green here too, but once they’ve gotten into Draco’s four posted and drawn the drapes, they’re in near complete darkness.
“Are you okay?” he asks in a weak croak. “Did I--?”
“That’s the bloody idea,” Draco breathes, tugging impatiently at Potter’s hair. “Can you get on with it?”
“Hmm?” Granger only seems to register Potter’s question now. “Oh, I just meant that he’ll inadvertently be seeking emotional support from you – it’s natural to expect it from your partner when you’re in a physically and emotionally compromised state, really.” She draws her wand, snorting at the way Draco is scowling at her explanation. “Additionally, he’s going to be relying on your magic as well.”
His mind feels wiped blank as Draco sits there, completely stunned and still teetering on disbelief. Next to him, he can feel Potter’s careless impatience, his sheepishness, and a hint of anxiety as Draco’s peripheral vision detects him turning to stare at Draco.
However, Potter simply opens his mouth, sticking his tongue out slightly so that the crown of Draco’s cock is resting on it and waits. Swivelling his hips, Draco shifts his cock around, so it slides up Potter’s cheek and then down his chin, before bringing it back to his tongue, gently tickling the ridge of his own cock against the velvety softness of Potter’s tongue.
“Say it,” Draco bends down to lick over one, still swollen nipple, “Tell me what you want.”
“No, Jesus, I swear! I really am sorry! I—I didn’t
Draco’s nostrils flare, his joy vanishing in an instant. “Excuse me?” he interrupts icily, voice barely heard. “Care to take that back?”
“Ron and I are going to go and pick up dinner,” he declares, taking Weasley by the arm and yanking. When Draco takes a step forward with his eyes bugging out of his head in incredulity, Potter just looks rather desperate.
is a shithole!” Draco declares brightly, already getting to his feet, grabbing his cloak and gloves. “I’m going to brew you something that doesn’t taste like death, Potter.”
James was crying now, properly crying for the first time since last night, tears running down his dirty cheeks and chest heaving with sobs.

“Okay,
Draco immediately feels his lip curl. “And I’d care,

But he’d never imagined a scenario where he’d be
He’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever laid eyes on.
“Not yet,” Potter says cheerfully. “I’d like to take out to dinner at least once before we put a label on this.”
By the time July rolls to an end, it’s blisteringly hot and nearly always threatening to break into an epic thunderstorm. They don’t venture out much during the day, preferring to stay indoors, sucking on ice lollies in varying states of undress with the Cooling Charms on. Potter doesn’t go out by himself very often either, attending a lot of his meetings via Floo calls or not at all, spending most of his free time with Draco desperately writhing under him.
“Are you going to tell me about that giant stick you’ve had up your arse these last few days?”
Draco doesn’t register the low rumble of voices as the rest of them start to gather their things, steadily filtering out of the room. Potter is very still beneath him, his hands, palms up, still flat above his head, his eyes intent and curious as he stares up at Draco, seemingly completely unbothered by the fact that he’s got his own wand trained at him.
“It’s a nice place, Potter,” he says quietly, placing his small briefcase on the floor, and carefully setting the wooden box on the coffee table. Potter remains silent, standing with his arms crossed and feet slightly apart, staring intently at Draco’s every move as he takes off his cloak and gloves, and neatly hitches his robes higher before sinking onto his knees behind the coffee table, foregoing the sofa or the matching chairs.
?!” he asks, finally lowering the vial long enough to stare incredulously at Draco. “But it’s not the week leading up to the full moon. I start my course exactly seven days before—”
Harry turns, eyes moist, and they simply stand there, nose to nose, beaming at one another. “I showed you, Malfoy,” Harry murmurs softly, buffing a knuckle against Draco’s jaw.
“Thank fuck for that,” Harry replied casualy, retrieving Malfoy’s bag and two of the enormous books he’d been carrying. “I’ve been trying to get people to see me for
“You want my arse?” Draco murmurs, twisting his hand right underneath the glans, rucking up his foreskin and bunching it roughly under his fist. “You want me to fuck your cock? Ride it till you come inside me?”
“Draco?” Narcissa whispers, one hand pressed to her chest, her breathing laboured.

,” I intone breathily, chugging some beer as he turns to scowl at me.
“We know what this is really about,” I tell him matter-of-factly.
“That was fast.” Draco looks up at me surprised. “What, you and Weasley got a bet going on again?”
“Good. So get the fuck out of my house.”
“What do you want, it’s the middle of the damn night and it’s bloody
“Fuck off,” I mumble, looking over at where Simon is standing at the bar.
“You’re not allowed to fly during your third trimester, okay?” Potter says absently, pushing his glasses up his nose and turning a page before lifting Draco’s foot off his cock.
The four of us at the bar heave with laughter while Draco turns a dangerously threatening glare towards Ron who is still draped around his neck, hooting in triumph. Draco shoves him off, his lip curling as he stomps over to me.
“AKA, me.” Draco smirks his best smug smirk. “That was the private business I ran, Potter. I
“He’ll get himself some cider if he wants some cider, Malfoy,” Ron says rudely as Harry comes and plonks himself down on the blanket beside Draco. When Draco and Harry simply relapse into fervent snogging, Ron screams, “’Mione!
Draco never receives visitors who use the front door. And so he’s decidedly puzzled when a sharp, firm rap sounds on it while he’s mid-brew. By the time he throws a hurried Stasis on his whole workbench, ingredients, half-brewed potion and all, and rushes out to answer the door, he’s comprised a small list of potential visitors.
Potter chortles along with him, eyes soft as he regards Draco. “Are we really friends, then, Malfoy?” he finally asks when Draco finally looks back at him.
“How can you still want me?” Draco asks abruptly, sounding partly petulant and partly genuinely curious.
Despite how forthright and honest a person Potter is, Draco doesn’t quite have the guts to broach the subject because he’s too busy enjoying the blissful little bubble that they’re both living in and he doesn’t yet want to risk popping it.
Harry’s cheeks burn hot but he sets his jaw tightly. “Yes, because you’re pregnant with my child,” he says firmly. “And because it’s my responsibility to make sure you’re well cared for during this time. And because this is no place for you to be living in
“Send her a message!”
When he looked up he found Weasley waving his arms like a windmill to beckon him over.
“Off our suppressant, are we, boy?” Lucius remarks suddenly, steely eyes carefully perusing Draco’s inordinate beauty, his glowing skin and bright hair.
“Right, that’s it. I’m leaving.” Harry drains his drink, throws twelve galleons on the bar and gets up, swaying just a little bit.
by one?” he adds with a cruel little smirk that promptly falters as he notes the way Harry just sighs resignedly and looks away.
“Is that what you’re doing on my front step at this hour, Malfoy? Thinking about it?”
It’s not like I’ve forgotten the past – it’s what made us both work hard at transforming the equation between us into what it is today. And I’m in love with the git
“Care to dance?”
Potter raises his eyebrows. “Is your Boggart a Dementor?” he asks dryly.
It had taken Draco entirely too long to recognise the freshly inked lines, each one connecting a series of dots, placed right over Harry’s heart. Mouth open, breathing loud, Draco reached up and ran his fingertips over the new tattoo, hardly able to believe his eyes. Upon looking at Harry he saw that he was pink cheeked and chewing nervously on his lip, eyes anxious behind his glasses as he regarded Draco.
Harry spent the remaining morning resting beside Lily. He felt shaken and drained. After he had put together another meal for the children, they wanted to go outside into the overgrown field. Malfoy quietly led them out and left Harry to shut his eyes for a bit; whenever he lifted his head and peered through the cracked entrance, he would spot Malfoy standing with his hands behind his back, idly kicking a stone or examining something one of the kids had found.
“No, but I’m willing to try,” Harry retorts grimly. “I’m willing to put the past behind us. I’m willing to make a fresh start. I—we owe it to—it’s the least we can do as two fucking
“I know it’s—I know I’m supposed to have found a way to cope with this,” Harry says, sounding desperately ashamed. “I know I’m supposed to be—to be

Draco’s lip curls. “Right, so I’m not as accomplished as the rest of your

Potter is as red as Draco’s own face feels as he coughs once more, tugging at his earlobe. “Um, you and me, I guess,” he mumbles. “It’s fine if you don’t want to,” he adds hastily. “It’s just...you never get out of the house and it’s your birthday, after all, so I thought...” he trails off, slumping slightly. “It’s fine if you don’t want to,” he repeats.
And then Draco just blurts out what he’d kept tamped down since he was eighteen. “I thought...I was just part of some prank you’re playing on the press.”
Malfoy just huffs derisively and fastidiously adjusts his cloak to cover himself more thoroughly. “As if I give a damn,” he mutters, twitching out the hem and draping it over his lap.
“Okay, let’s go get you your broom polish.”

“It makes no sense.” Harry looked around the little clearing again. Then he sighed. “I was supposed to make it to Wales. At

“Yeah, me too,” Potter replies clearly, expression and tone clear of any resentment or dishonesty. “I’m glad we’re friends now.”
Malfoy makes a muted, choking sound, his fingers grinding Harry’s knuckles together as he squeezes, his whole face and neck going brilliantly pink as he gapes at Harry, mouthing soundlessly. Harry, despite their audience and the fact that he’d just bared his heart in front of them, feels more self-assured and resilient than he thought one might in a moment like this.
going to be the one to ask the question that’s looming between them like a fucking shiny-arsed unicorn.
“Wonderful,” he drawled before placing the trunk on the ground and marching back into the trees.
“Yes, it’s Malfoy,” Hermione says carefully, twisting a hair tie around the end and throwing her braid back as she sinks onto the armchair, drawing her knees up to her chest. “And you’ve been joined at the hip with him for the past few years. Long enough to even make Ron absurdly jealous.”
Harry swallowed with difficulty. “I- I wasn’t staring at your crotch.” There was a derisive huff from Malfoy. And then, “Your crotch is covered,” Harry babbled unthinkingly.
, let’s snog a little more.”
“You can just ask if you want to eat me out, Potter,” Malfoy sighs, badly hiding a smirk as he adjusts the quilt over himself. “You don’t have to make up excuses for it.”
Malfoy laughed softly. “It’s hotter now, even if I do say so myself.”
Potter looks rather astonished as he leans forward and places his forearms on the table, silently inviting Draco to continue. Draco fidgets slightly before going on, “It’s in my blood, Potter, and we’re a whole family of Veela.
, Potter!”
“Fine, I’ll offer you the next new book I purchase.”
Ron makes a high pitched croaking sound at the back of his throat, his eyes popping out, Draco grinning happily at him across the table.
“What,” replied Harry gruffly, wiggling his head forward to force his tongue deeper into Draco.
baby too, right?”
Deciding to just carry up a tray to the living room instead of making Malfoy climb up and down the stairs, Harry starts pulling down bowls and forks when he hears a hoarse yelp from Kreacher and turns to find him lifting the heavy pot off its hook, the fire now green with an incoming Floo call.
Draco rolls his eyes. “You wouldn’t, that’s the point I’m trying to make,” he drawls. “You’ve been on the potion more than two weeks, and there is enough wolfsbane in your system to keep the worst of the wolf’s instincts at bay.”

So Harry sighs irritably - loudly. “Malfoy, what am I doing here?” he demands, dipping his head and trying to catch his gaze. “You did owl and ask to meet me, yes?”
“Fuck!” Maybe not as quietly this time.
“Will you have dinner with me sometime?”
“Do you regret what happened?” Harry asked bluntly, not ready to let Malfoy bait him into an argument. “You think I forced myself on you or someth--?”
“No no, of course not,” Harry turns to her with a wry smile, “He’d have blown up the place, the touchy prat.”
For all the cold derision Malfoy oozes, Harry notices the way his thin fingers clutch at the cloak he’s got draped over his arm. His eyes immediately find Harry’s as he steps in and Harry feels the knots in his belly tighten painfully as their gazes lock and hold for several seconds.

“I did it,” he whispers tremulously, and Draco’s chest aches. “I didn’t notice if mine’s bigger?” Harry says quickly, clearly trying to yank himself together; his chest heaves as he stares after his Patronus in disbelief, and he appears on the verge of tears.
“How’s the flat?” he asks, sipping some bubbly. “Find a new roommate yet?”
“Why are you sulking?”
I have the sudden urge to stand up and violently upturn the fifteen foot long table, half empty platters of food and all.
“How did you find us?”
I roll my eyes. “We don’t have a bet going on.”

“Dad,” James wandered over, “Can we get something to eat?”
And for all the generosity of spirit that people associated him with, Harry Potter was a possessive bastard – and was utter shit at pretending otherwise. This one time Draco had sat next to a particularly handsome seventh year Slytherin during dinner (because, yes, Harry and he had had a fight that evening and Draco was nothing if not hurtfully petty), Harry had more than satisfied Draco’s passive aggressive need to see him completely

it was to keep my distance before?!” He brings one hand behind Draco’s head, tugging off the black ribbon that’s already come loose during the course of their vigorous necking over the past half an hour, and sending it fluttering to the floor, pulling Draco’s hair out of the shapeless ponytail into a wide, white-gold fan around his head. “I have trouble breathing every time I lay eyes on you,” he murmurs, his gaze fixed on his own hand as it runs through Draco’s hair. “You’re
“Malfoy, though?” Ron deadpans. “
“Where’s your wife?” Harry blurted it before he could find a more delicate way to frame the question.
“Duly noted,” Draco says softly.
“Potter, you need to stop.” Malfoy’s words, muffled into his hands, made dread seep through Harry, a small part of him demanding that he simply carry on.
Malfoy turned to him, silver eyes flaming. For a second, Harry was convinced Malfoy was about to ask him to get the fuck out of his bed. And then, “Yes.”
“Of course. I’m going to be wherever you are.” A single tear slid down the side of his nose. Lily stared at it before reaching out and wiping it off.
“You want to ask me something, so go ahead.”
“Yeah,” Potter says simply.
“How do you mean?”
Harry shrugs. “I don’t talk about it much, do I? The wolf thing,” he specifies with a smile when Malfoy tilts his head questioningly. “It’s always on my mind, Malfoy. It’s who I am now and it’s not something that can be cured and...” Harry feels the familiar pit of despair growing inside him but presses on anyway, “Despite everything else that—despite everything else that I’ve done, it’s...all that people seem to want to talk about when they hear my name.” Harry is rather shocked with himself for saying out loud the things he hasn’t even voiced to Ron or Hermione yet. “So anyway,” he continues hurriedly, “that night, I dunno whether it was whatever I was floating around on thanks to Seamus or whether it was the fact that you were the most beautiful fucking thing I’d ever laid eyes on, but I wasn’t thinking about...
“And if you miss a dose?” Draco asks, unconsciously holding his breath.
Malfoy shot him a sharp look, but a moment later he leaned back against the wall and slid down, settling on the floor with a soft, whooshing exhale.
” Hermione turns to Ron impatiently. “Ron, we’ve talked about this. Harry’s in love with Malfoy.”
“Oh, let’s see.” Draco climbs onto the stool I’d just vacated, straddling it and tucking one foot under the rung. “Are you free, say, next

Do you know that feeling when you deliberately behave like a juvenile fuck with somebody so that they
Draco doesn’t answer at once. He takes a small sip of tea, perfectly brewed and put together, he clears his throat several times, tries to tuck back a long, errant strand of hair that’s escaped his ponytail, and then decides to undo and retie his ponytail altogether. He examines his nails, takes another sip of tea – still perfect – and then finally looks up at the man sitting across from him, intently staring at Draco.
“Lovely day?” he grits into the mirror as he ties his hair into a glossy ponytail, hands slipping on the satin as he tries to make the black bow stand stiff and straight.
Groaning and sinking his teeth into Draco’s neck, Potter follows, his arm buckling as his hips shudder heavily and finally still, his cock pressed impossibly deep, the hot gush of his release making Draco moan tremulously as he rides out the last of his own orgasm.
, Draco.”
From down the corridor, comes the sound of Lily’s shrill, furious screeching interspersed with long, throaty wails.
He’s breached at once, of course, Harry stuffing as much of his tongue into Draco as physically possible, growling and moaning as though he’d rather eat Draco open than fuck him or have his own cock sucked. It’s something that never fails to delight Draco, Harry’s unabashed enjoyment of eating Draco’s arse, and so with one hand on the wall and the other back in Harry’s hair, Draco rides Harry’s tongue in a slow, decadent bounce, looking down and watching his cock leak into Harry’s freshly washed hair and his balls quiver against that famously scarred forehead.
Lily emerged, pink-faced and smiling. Harry’s heart, riddled with punctures as it was, felt like it was slowly being inflated, filling his bruised body with a weak, flickering light. He had his children right there, healthy and unharmed, albeit a little muddy. If at all there was a way for him to communicate with Ginny, he knew – he knew it with absolute, unquestionable certainty – that she would rather
Pansy walks up to Draco as he watches Harry and Lovegood dance.
“Are you in pain?” Harry asks anxiously, immediately hurrying over. “Is the baby coming?”
, Draco suddenly thought back to their first kiss – hesitant, clumsy, and laced with Firewhiskey as they’d lounged by the fireplace in the common room long after everyone else had gone to bed. He thought of the kiss after their ‘first fight’ – Draco had screamed at Harry about how he probably still thought of Draco as nothing but a Death Eater who’d gone scot-free; it had been a completely irrational bout of insecurity and Harry’s eyes had been wet as they’d later kissed with a nearly violent need to reassure, shivering in the cold as they’d stood pressed together in the snow behind one of the greenhouses.
“No,” he sighs, settling back down. “’s not a crime. And Ron and ‘Mione aren’t the way you think they are. They’re happy for us.”
Harry sighed. “Malfoy, what’s the big deal?” Unable to believe his own temerity, Harry reached forward and gently pushed aside Malfoy’s injured hands. “Honestly,” he said softly, shaking his head as he began undoing the buttons, his knuckles grazing the damp skin of Malfoy’s chest as he worked the shirt open.
Without even thinking about it Draco picked up the delicate silver vase on the set of drawers near the door and hurled it at the ferret with a bellow of anger. Moody easily ducked away, the vase hitting the pillow and rolling off to drop to the floor with a dull clang. Moody hopped off the bed and darted into the en suite, hopping up onto the counter to crouch at the sink and drink out the tap. Immediately running in after him, Draco grabbed him with both hands and lifted his arms to fling him out of the bathroom, but the ferret beat him to it and simply wriggled out of his grasp and leapt down, scampering out of the bedroom and pausing only to grab the robes Draco had just taken off and left in a pool near the door.

, Potter,” he hisses, baring grit teeth.
It turned out to be Butterbeer and Harry chugged it gratefully, his throat feeling rough and scratchy. The potion was already taking effect; his eyes felt heavy and the dull throb in his side felt muted as he lay back down with a soft sigh, drawing the covers up and turning onto his uninjured side, curling up as much as his ribs allowed him to, mumbling out a reply to Pomfrey’s whispered
“Potter! What do you think you’re—?!” Draco’s startled barking breaks off abruptly as Potter tears at his flies, ripping them open and lifting Draco off his chest just enough to shove his trousers and pants down the rotund curve of his arse, Draco’s cock bobbing pink and damp, brushing Potter’s chin. “Potter,” he whimpers, breath catching in a sharp stab in his throat as Potter grabs his arse with both hands, massaging the fleshy roundness before abruptly hauling Draco even higher, so Draco’s cock slides wetly up his face on a dribble of precome.
“Okay.”
He suddenly sighs, throwing the robes onto his bed where several other sets of robes lie in a carelessly tossed pile. “Am I an idiot for hoping this works out?” he turns to me. “This thing with Tristan,” he adds.
Harry found himself on his knees. “Expecto Patronum!” he managed once more, but produced only silver mist. There were screams inside his head; so much screaming that he couldn’t tell his mother’s from his own or from Ginny’s.
Blinking in bemusement, Draco leaned back and blinked at the badge that had printed across it:
“Can you put it back inside me, please?” Malfoy demands loudly, irritably slamming his heel against Harry’s shoulder blade and grabbing his renewed erection to lazily fist it a couple of times.
Draco had known that it’d happen – that Harry would come up to him; that he’d have to
It was only when Harry had been in the shower, just before he’d gotten into bed, when he’d realised that he may have inadvertently humiliated Malfoy, speaking to him the way he had; asking him all those questions about what he did, just blurting them out like that.
It starts one day with a single Stinging Hex to Draco’s back while he’s on his way to Herbology. The incident is waved away.
“Fuck
Harry’s pained shout of release is broken against Malfoy’s open mouth, their lips moving slickly as Harry vigorously works his climax into him, pressing one foot into the bed to gain leverage, his arm tightening around Malfoy’s long, white thigh, his hips slapping loudly into the dampness of his sweaty lower back.
Out of
Draco sighs. “I know. That’s actually what I’m here to talk to him about. I want to help him,” he adds softly – and just like that Draco admits out loud to why he’s really here.
He was sure he was properly blushing now. And he was trembling very lightly from a mixture of genuine mortification and...

He runs. He streaks out of the castle, bolting towards the Quidditch pitch where he knows Team Gyffindor is still at practice. He nearly trips over and lands face-first in the damp grass before furiously waving Harry down from the air.
“You’re lying.”

“I’m going to bed,” Draco says coolly, brushing his cheeks with his free hand and not looking at Potter’s burning, open expression.
“What the fuck is your problem with the man, Harry?” I mutter as I wait for Zabini to notice me slouched across the bar.
“What, jumped you and then rushed out before I accidentally broke a few of your bones or something?” Potter smiles crookedly, “I usually just leave for the evening,” he shrugs, “Tell you I have a meeting or something. You never do ask many questions,” he adds, sounding a touch rueful.
Draco had simply stared at the gigantic, bright purple bag of sweets when Potter had heaved it onto the sofa beside Draco before looking back up at Potter in blank shock, at which point Potter had just shrugged and blushed and mumbled something about how Draco had finished most of the sweets in the bowl in his room before hurrying away.
Harry garbles something into the bed and Draco turns around with a snarl of frustration, stopping dead as Scorpius comes sauntering into the room, crooked smile of self-satisfaction directed at Draco as he holds his little arms out and spins in place, green eyes shining with excitement, jet black hair in a horrid, hopeless pile on his head.
Ron made a weird huffing snort into his arms – he wasn’t even pretending to work like Harry was. His head rested on his arms and Hermione reached over to absentmindedly run her fingers through his hair every few minutes.
“Is it why you had to go off your suppressant?” she asks in a hushed voice, leaning forward to cup Malfoy’s face, “Because you’re with child? You’re so
,” Harry repeats, laughing as Malfoy shoves one sharp elbow into his arm.
I’m barely even conscious; I don’t think I’ve ever come so hard in my life or that sex has ever felt so good before.
“No, absolutely not, I—I didn’t--”
Harry opened his mouth to tell him that he would never leave any of them. No sound came out.
“No,” Draco admits shakily, knowing full well what’s to follow. And sure enough, Potter’s mouth descends right back down, lips smacking around the vivid pink, pebbled skin, pulling at it on a leisurely suck, finding Draco’s wrists as he scrabbles wildly and holding them pinned to the pillows.
“Very
Harry snorts into the kiss and Draco makes a sound of annoyance, pulling away with a scowl. “That’s disgusting,” he declares, before turning to glare at Ron. “Stop saying shit like that, Weasel. We were

as nicely too?”
But then Draco is wandering back in, humming idly, pushing his sleeves up his arms. Ron wordlessly throws himself back onto the sofa, stretching his legs out and crossing his feet on the coffee table. Draco stops dead in his tracks, staring first at Ron’s relaxed form and then at me, just frozen in place and staring dumbly.
Potter had stood and watched Draco Disapparate, thick arms crossed, tiny, lopsided smile directed at Draco; as if he’d smiled like that at Draco his whole life, as if it wasn’t the most beautiful smile Draco has ever seen.
“Because Harry requested me to help him out,” she answers calmly, not ruffled in the least. “I’ve been reading up, and I’m fairly confident of my abilities to help. Healer Abigail Penman, one of our senior most Healers, will be more than willing to help, too.” When Malfoy just continues half-glaring at her, she adds, a tad uncertainly, “If Harry and you prefer to consult with anoth--”
Potter’s face softens a bit. “I’m sorry, Malfoy.”
And Draco responds with all the vehemently reassuring fervour he can manage, slowly sliding Harry’s hot, naked weight off himself and rolling atop him, holding Harry’s face with both hands and grinding their mouths together in a slick, scorching kiss that intensifies steadily until it finally ebbs, both of them gasping loudly for air by the time they pull apart.

There’s a knock and Emily, one of the junior Aurors, sticks her head in. “Auror Weasley, Head Auror Robards wants to see you.”
I pull away just in time and sneeze violently into the crook of one arm, once, twice, thrice, until Malfoy is shaking with laughter, his head thumping back onto the wood as he clutches his stomach.
that Draco feels for the git, day after day, coursing through his bloodstream like a hit of the most exquisite Pixie Dust galleons can buy, making him feel at once like he’s flying and drowning.
“What do you mean tired?” I ask sceptically, bringing one knee onto the sofa as I turn to face him. “Tired of what?”
,” Potter sighs, shoulders slumping and his chin dropping to his chest. “I just—I didn’t think you’d even care, okay? I knew you’d think it to be some...I dunno, display of superiority or something equally obnoxious and I thought it was just a conversation we could skip.”
“Fine.”
Then Potter barks out a short, slightly derisive laugh and turns away, striding up to the table, sinking into a chair and slumping down in an ill-mannered slouch. “You chose a hell of a day to come sneer, Malfoy.” When Draco just continues to stand there, he slumps lower in his seat and kicks out the chair across the table from his. “Sit.”
“You’re not giving me much reason to be brave!”
A loud, crashing sound of something hitting the floor makes Draco scramble out of bed and snatch up his wand. The sound seemed to have come from the kitchen, from where he can now hear muffled cursing.
“Yes, but I
, please—please don’t cry--” Draco sifts desperate fingers through Harry’s dirt-caked, blood streaked hair, “Ssshh. Don’t, just don’t do this to yourself, Harry.
Harry ignored his grumbling, pushing his tongue back inside him along with the two fingers in a slick, wildly arousing tangle. The fingers went straight for his prostate, no dilly dallying, and waged a direct assault on it, massaging and squeezing until Draco was sure he was going to pass the fuck out. He was moaning hoarsely now, his eyes rolling back into his head, and simply focused on staying upright and leaving some of Harry’s hair attached to his scalp.
“It’s...different,” Potter repeats, staring fixedly at the plait hanging past Draco’s chest, the look in his eyes making Draco’s breath hitch.
“Why’d you slink away?” He pops another chip into his mouth and comes to stand beside me, our shoulders brushing as he props himself against the graffiti-ridden wall. He smells of his sporty cologne and fresh, clean sweat. There’s a small hickey on the side of his neck, just below his right ear. I hate him for a moment.
“Tell me about the Veela thing,” Potter says.
The following evening, Draco cuts short his study session with Pansy to ensure he’s ten minutes early, hurrying up to the seventh floor, smoothing his hair down and sniffing his armpits, checking that his robes aren’t too wrinkled.
He shrugs. “
Malfoy didn’t look up from the floor. He didn’t react at all. Just when Harry became certain that he wasn’t going to reply, Malfoy said, “Kissed and taken.”
“What are you saying?” Potter leans back even further, until he’s kneeling between Draco’s thighs, head tilted, brow furrowed.
at Draco – and
Panting and sweating lightly, Draco turned when he heard footsteps approaching, waving his stolen bathrobe around just as Harry appeared, his expression oddly inscrutable, his erection long, thick and deep red, his Ministry issued badge (that now said SR. AUROR instead of TRAINEE) bouncing against his chest.
“I’m home!” Harry’s voice sounded from the living room. “Draco?”
“My back is killing me,” said Draco drily, quirking a crooked smile at the other boy before struggling off his lap (and cock). He slid off his thighs, landing on his bum with a grunt, hissing at the blunt pressure against his puffy hole, his arse deliciously sore.
After very little deliberation, Harry decided that the kids would be under the Invisibility Cloak. It was the easiest decision to make, really. How many times had Harry, Ron and Hermione used the Cloak for dangerous shit like this? He would’ve preferred they not go with him at all but there was no way he was leaving them with Malfoy – if Malfoy even agreed to watch them in the first place.
, snapping instructions at Draco, and Draco’s cock is filling out and lengthening because his childhood rival and the hero to millions is hissing insults into Draco’s face – while holding him down in a death grip.
“Why not?”
“So you...couldn’t get another job?” Potter still looks furious.
“Because you love me,” Harry answers at once.
“Do you really still hate me?” Potter sits back on his heels and waits, curious and keen.
,” Draco informs him before he can finish, his lip curled in distaste, “And you smell like a rabid, unwashed stray. Take a shower sometime, why don’t you? Not that it’d make me want to go out with you - nothing in existence will - but it might help with the stench.”
“Kreacher,” Potter calls quietly, and when the elf appears with a crack, asks Draco, “Tea?”
“Ten quid,” the man shrugs a shoulder. “No biggie.”
“When did you find out?”
Cursing himself for letting Hermione talk him into getting a fucking

“Off,” Harry mutters, trying to push the soft terry from Draco’s shoulders. Draco stands up on his knees and shrugs it off, gasping when Harry immediately lunges forward and sucks one tight, pink nipple into his mouth. “Fuck, baby,” he moans softly, as Draco cradles his head close and trembles.

“What is the matter with you?” Potter asks slowly, standing perfectly still, his wary gaze razor-sharp and fixed on Draco. “What brought this on?”
Pressing his lips tightly over his teeth to prevent any pathetic, premature sounds slipping out, Draco leaned his forehead into the cool stone and waited. He could feel Harry’s breath on his hole now and Harry’s fingers on the backs of his thighs, calloused and wonderfully warm, stroking him in slow, unhurried caresses.
“—but we have an appointment with ‘Mione tonight, anyway, so—”
Harry didn’t notice the empty classroom door cracking open just as Malfoy walked past it. And so when a hex flew out, sending Malfoy reeling forward, books and bags going everywhere as he went flying across the corridor on his front, Harry stumbled to a complete halt in shock, too taken by surprise to react even as three students toppled out of the classroom, hooting with laughter as they approached Malfoy’s feebly stirring prone form, wands pointed straight down at him.
Harry nodded. “Exactly.”
Draco stares at him, Potter’s words swirling around in his mind, blindingly radiant in its honestly. “Surely

didn’t want anything,” Granger says laughingly, “so we thought why not give him something that he’s going to be buying in a few months anyway.” She speaks with genuine kindness and warmth and Draco somehow can’t bring himself to snap at her with any sort of conviction.
Hermione perches on the sofa chair across from Harry and watches him worriedly. “Did you even go on the date?”
“Can you not?” Draco sighs wearily, rubbing at his forehead as he tries determinedly to not think about Potter’s cock – and failing.
He winces. I curse and bend to retrieve what I can of the cheese and clean up the rest.
, and I let Simon lead me out by the hand as he mutters under his breath.
then, you will pop in and Apparate me out of there, is that clear? You will not linger for more than the time it takes you to grab my arm and bring me out to safety. Do you understand?”

before, despite what one might assume just by looking at him. And so when they finally melt out of the kiss, Potter only pulling back enough to press their brows together, he whispers, “Harry...”
My frown deepens now as I continue to stare down at him now and Draco laughs. “It’s a rather silly thing, nothing great really,” he says breezily.
“He doesn’t want to see—” Potter started to mumble, but Weasley seized him by the shoulder and spun him around on his stool, nearly sending Potter sliding off his seat. Draco just had a moment to spot something silver hanging from a long, thin chain around his neck, gleaming against the dark material of Potter’s black T-shirt, before Weasley was waving the round badge, the size of a sickle, in Draco’s face.
“Did you paint these on?!” I tug fruitlessly at his blue jeans and he sniggers, his mouth clumsily landing on mine, whiskey and beer mingling on our tongues. “Why do you smell like chocolate?” I hiccup into his soft, flushed cheek, sliding one hand up under his un-tucked black shirt, immediately twisting the nipple when my fingers brush.
Still holding the glass of water between his thumb and middle finger, he lifted his hand and let his little finger slip into the gap between the curtains and twitched it open soundlessly, holding his breath as he peered inside, squinting through the darkness.
“I don’t care about that. I don’t want you here.”
“Draco.” I’ve called out before I can decide what I’m going to say – even though there is

“Childbirth, most likely,” Hermione answers quietly and Harry whips around to stare at her in mute horror. “Wizard-pregnancy related Healing wasn’t very advanced back then, Harry, we’re talking, two...three centuries, ago?” she adds, tilting her head at Ron.
After helping Lily eat a plain cheese sandwich and some chocolate, Harry brought Malfoy a sandwich and another can of beer. Malfoy was rifling around in his trunk and when Harry peeked in, he saw the food and beer he had brought over the night before, untouched.
“Because I
Malfoy scoffs, throwing Harry a look, his glossy hair sliding over his forehead and onto his eyes. “Weasley just invites me to be polite, Potter,” he says, absently swirling his scotch around the glass, long, agile fingers stiff as he holds the tumbler by the rim. “He invites half the department, and the only reason he bothers with me is because I’m your partner and share an office with you, and he thinks I’d be

over his shoulder, Harry hurried to follow, carelessly stepping over one of the Stunned Gryffindors.

“We should all probably catch up, I suppose.” Simon doesn’t sound very enthusiastic about it.
James, at only eight, already knew his father well enough to wield watertight arguments like these. He knew there were very few people Harry wouldn’t risk life and sanity for.
Draco’s breakfast suddenly tastes slightly bitter in his mouth. “Well, your

Draco had blushed and spluttered and
Because this Scorpius was clearly Malfoy’s son. The longer Harry looked at him, the clearer it became. The kid had the exact same pointed nose and chin, grey eyes, and flaxen hair that shone under the moonlight. What he lacked was the arrogant, slightly malevolent air Malfoy had always carried. He was staring at Harry almost fearfully but behind it, Harry could see the worshipful admiration he had grudgingly grown accustomed to over the past fifteen years.
Hermione, infuriatingly enough, looked like she’d

She sighs. “Not for the time being, no.”
“Bye, Papa!” Scorpius bellows, waving energetically as Lucius throws Floo powder into the hearth. “Dada, bye!” he adds before diving into the neon green flames. When Draco glances over, he sees Harry wave vaguely, his gaze immediately locking with Draco’s.
, fighting its way out of Harry on a hoarse chuckle.
Unable to form words yet, Draco sips some tea, staining the handle with chocolate before he instinctively licks his fingers clean, right over where Potter’s tongue had touched him, warm and very wet. Across the table, Potter inhales sharply.
“Shut it, Potty.” He peers around me at Hermione. “Hullo, Granger. Long time.”
When Potter talks, his voice is soft and his tone measured. “You’re not playing around with me, then?” he says. “This isn’t your idea of a colossal joke to play on me because the idea of messing with a werewolf is hilarious?”
Potter doesn’t seem to be able to help the slightly lascivious leer he throws Draco’s way and horrifyingly enough, Draco isn’t even a little bothered by it – flustered and a tiny bit aroused, perhaps, but
“Do you regret it?” Harry pressed. Malfoy looked like he was about to burst. He looked a little crazed as he glared down at his homework, breathing harshly through his mouth. “Malfoy,” Harry whispered his name, unsure as to why his voice broke.
“That can’t be pleasant,” Harry says amusedly, holding him tighter when he shivers, “Roses have thorns. Imagine getting a hundred thorns embedded in your cock and arse.”
Harry shrugged. “I just wondered, is all. You know what happened to mine.”
He is however more excited than he’s ever been in his whole, entire life. He’s not dared to hope for this, not dared to go beyond touching himself to mental images of Potter while simultaneously being mortified with himself and more aroused than he’s ever been.

at him before insisting on relieving Draco of his armload of books and carrying them for him.
“You’re not serious,” Harry can feel reluctant, mortified laughter bubbling up inside him, “I’m not going to talk to you about how I’m in bed, Malfoy!”
“We’ll see you later, love,” Granger calls again, taking Weasley by the arm and dragging him out. “Take care now.”
“They’ve taken the wards down,” Malfoy whispers shakily under his breath, appearing almost dizzy with relief. “Tilly,” he raises his voice a bit and addresses the house-elf.
, oh god!”
“Draco,” he breathed, his grip on Draco turning savage as he stiffened and let out a guttural cry, pressing Draco onto his cock as if determined to come as deep inside him as physically possible. Whimpering, Draco pushed off the wall and wrapped both arms around Harry, clutching him to himself and pressing hot kisses onto his face which was still frozen in that rapturous mien of completion. “Draco,” he whispered again, and then Draco kissed him.
I finish my smoke and grind it out on the wall behind me. He eats another chip, sucks the salt off his thumb, pulls out another one and steps forward, holding it up to my mouth.
“It’s fun,” Harry says, smacking his arse lightly as he moves away, Malfoy yelping softly. “Or so I’ve heard.”
Who are you, he ought to ask.
But there was no sweet answer, no pitter-patter of little feet on floorboards.
Draco glares even though his stomach plummets with disappointment. “That’s what I meant when I asked if you regret what happened, Potter.”
“That’s fucking

He’s just leaving, walking past the little service and enquiry kiosk, when the sight of what is probably the ugliest house-elf he’s ever seen makes him slow down a step, glaring at it in bewilderment – it’s horrifically old, has sagging, greyish skin, and enormous bluish eyes that are spotted grey with age. It’s wearing a clean white toga, tufts of fluffy, white hair protruding out its ears, and throws Draco a curiously interested look as he passes by before suddenly lowering into a bow.

“I—I mean--” Harry’s face matches his uniform now. In his pants, his cock spurts out a dribble of precome at the exact same moment Malfoy absently licks his lips.
Ginny backing away desperately, her breath fogging in front of her face.
“I’m really sorry,” I whisper. He just shuts his eyes.
“Anderson asked me to sit in on a briefing after you left,” I grouse. “Hermione not home yet?”
“When I do what, Malfoy?” he repeats patiently after swallowing, wiping the back of one hand across his mouth.
And it ought to have made no sense whatsoever; ought to have felt completely fucking ridiculous. Except that it was so utterly mad that he supposed it circled right back around to sensible.
“I know it’s also your birthday, you prat.” Harry laughed softly, burying his face in Draco’s neck. “I remember. I’ll catch the Snitch for you, I promise.”
Hunching over his desk, Draco writes back now telling Granger how stupid her idea of giving Potter some Muggle device called a
and with such formidable intensity that he nearly went blind from it.
Malfoy wasn’t smirking anymore and his eyes were like shards of broken glass that could cut you with a single look. “Even

Potter responds by cupping Draco’s arse with both hands and
He’s been using that smirk a lot lately – ever since he started ‘seeing’ that fucking
“Beats me,” he throws his hands up and comes to sit cross legged by my feet. “He says he doesn’t want things to move too fast.”
James didn’t answer at once, his face drawn and his chin soft as he simply stared at the jumper Harry held. Then, in a very low voice, he said, “I miss Mum.”
“Fuck you!” Draco screams, finally throwing himself onto the sofa and easing his foot out his shoe to clutch at his throbbing toes. “Just because it’s so fucking easy for you—”
you in months. I haven’t tasted you properly in ages.” He pulls back and meets Draco’s eyes squarely. “I’d like to look at you while I fuck you, if it’s all the same, thank you.”
, dammit! Fuck me!”
Malfoy smirks, and then instead of climbing on pillion, he straddles the bike facing Harry, settling onto the fuel tank and deliberately grinding their crotches together, his thighs settling atop Harry’s as he curls his legs around him. “You were right,” he murmurs, gnawing at Harry’s jaw. “I doubt I can sit very long right now, so get us there quickly.”
take care of Draco, and in dozens of different ways, but never in a way that asks to be noticed or thanked. Low, cushioned stools have sprung up everywhere in the house for Draco to rest his feet on where he sits; an elaborate kit of Muggle lotions and skin care products was left on Draco’s bathroom counter one evening after he’d gone to breakfast earlier that day with mild rashes down his neck, grumbling about the dry, itchy skin on his belly; crates of more books and a brand new Wireless waited for Draco in the library one morning, and the batty old house-elf dutifully loads Draco’s plate with fresh fruit and vegetables every day.
Draco doesn’t care, frankly; he mostly just wants to see Potter’s mouth drop open when he unwraps Draco’s gift. It’s time that bastard learnt to take it like he dishes it, Draco thinks irritably as he hobbles towards the bathroom, his cock now pressing against the underside of his belly through his pyjamas.
“Such a fittingly pretentious gift from the most pretentious ponce to ever exist,” Weasley says rudely, looking mighty smug.
Setting his bag down on the nearest armchair, Draco makes his way over. Potter doesn’t look up, and doesn’t attempt to hide what he’s doing. The large book he’d been carrying, Draco now sees, is a photo album, and Potter is wordlessly perusing old, spasmodically moving photographs.
Draco realises he’s been staring and quickly looks away, cheeks heating, just as Kreacher comes up and carefully lays a cup of tea in front of him, the china surprisingly elegant, cream with rosy flowers painted under the gold rim. Potter is handed a humongous, steaming mug of black coffee, half of which he gulps in a single mouthful before croaking, “What do you want, Malfoy?”

“To yell at me?” Malfoy snorted again but it lacked heat this time. “Why’d I need a torch, Malfoy? I’m a fucking wizard.”
“You’ve been asking me to come and watch you train for over a week now,” Malfoy drawls.
All they want is to have sex. Why must Harry make it so fucking difficult?
Draco gasps, cutting of a shudder midway, scrambling off Potter until he’s sprawled out on his bum, knees drawn up so his plight remains hidden, eyes wide and breath short. He watches as Potter coolly gets to his feet, and then stops breathing entirely as Potter bends down towards him, another puff of warm breath ghosting over Draco’s face as he easily tugs his wand from Draco’s hand, his eyes shining with something that terrifies Draco enough that he feels his cock start to go down.
“That might just be the most ridiculous theory I have ever heard in my whole entire life, Weasley.”
Harry opened the trunk of food supplies. “Sure,” he said. “And chocolate for sure.”
things. She can’t have got up and walked out anymore than the sofa could’ve. Where’s her body?”
Harry felt like they looked.
Draco’s shriek of fury is interrupted by a deep, unfamiliar voice and Ron and I quickly scramble around to see a tall, muscular brunet holding an armful of Draco Malfoy, whose limbs are sprawled out gracelessly.

not bothered.
“Did I go too hard?” Harry whispers, and Draco can only gurgle out a breathless chuckle in answer. “Fuck, you’re gorgeous,” he sighs against Draco’s jaw, nosing at the little nook under Draco’s ear. “I can’t get over it; I don’t think I ever will.”
“You know what I mean.”
“I do, Auror Potter.”
“Both,” Harry supplies, lapping over the bite mark again, “and I’m surprised you’re letting me touch you right now; I’m fucking filthy.”
“First tell me why you care.”
“The night I found out I’m a wizard,” Potter tells him, without a shred of hesitation. “On my eleventh birthday, Hagrid found me smuggled away by my Muggle relatives in a fucking hut in the middle of the sea somewhere near Cokeworth, broke down the door and gave me my Hogwarts letter.”
“What?” he snaps. “What the fuck is it? What

“Careful, Malfoy,” Harry finally manages, “You don’t want to be asking for trouble now, do you?”
Draco reads about how Harry stands staunchly by what he’d said in Draco’s favour at his trials, how Harry finds it ridiculous that anybody should think him
from having been thrown onto the training mats as many times as it had been in the past ten minutes.
Draco sighs as Harry places one knee beside Draco’s hip on the bed and conjures some lube to fist over his cock. His tender expression as he gazes down at Draco reflects none of the savage
“Been there, done that,” Draco snorts. “And you ask me if I miss being in the Corps.”
The fire crackles, spitting loudly, and Harry is sure he hears a cat purring somewhere in the room as he gives in and meanders over to Draco. The chill from the stone walls and floor seeps into the room, but the fire is a huge, bright vermillion flare, and that along with the ridiculously ornate Christmas decorations dripping from every available surface around the room (with the addition of the sight of Draco in a fluffy, pure white Weasely  jumper, pink nosed and bright eyed, kicking his shoes off and disappearing into the nest of cushions and quilts) lends the room an undeniable, comforting warmth that seems to settle into his very bones.
But even as he ate Draco’s arse open, it felt like Potter was in charge –
Exhaling shakily, he forces himself to look away, tremors zinging up his spine as he feels that penetrating virescent gaze stay firmly lodged on his face.
Harry made a show of looking around. “You want me to show you
Their cottage seemed deserted.
The bed is thrown into the wall with each thrust now, and Draco is done; he just physically is not capable of holding on any longer.
“Don’t see why you’ve got your knickers in a twist, though,” Harry says coolly, flicking ash off with his thumb.
Harry stared in silence. Malfoy looked like he had in sixth year – gaunt and in desperate need of sleep.
and sipping on his tea, darting frequent admiring glances at the ridiculously perfect V of Harry’s upper body disappearing into his joggers.
“I think I had a great-grand uncle who had a baby with his lover,” Ron suddenly says thoughtfully from where he’s lounging on the little sofa, booted feet hanging over the armrest. “His wife nearly killed him but then the bloke died so they raised the kid.”
, Harry doesn’t find himself seething with resentment at the sight of it, doesn’t find himself glaring hatefully before wrenching his gaze away because he’s trembling so hard.
The little creature jumps in place before turning, sending the vase crashing to the floor. It squeaks in horror, one hand clamping over its mouth before hurriedly snapping its fingers and restoring the repaired vase onto the table, tugging its ears a few times as it turns anxiously to Malfoy.

Malfoy made a soft sob of a sound, clawing Harry’s hands off him and scooting back to lean against the wall, letting his head drop back and wiping his eyes with the heels of his hand, shoulders shaking.
Potter looks like he wants to question it, like he wants to protest, but Draco gives him no time or opportunity to do so. Placing his hands on Potter’s shoulders, Draco pushes downward, exerting steady pressure until Potter  sinks to his knees.
A long, wheezing, rattle. Air being sucked into a shapeless hole.
“Potter, I n-need to sit down, you fucking fiend,” Draco says weakly, grinding into Potter’s mouth, his heart thudding so hard that his whole body seems to thrum with the vibrations of each beat. “Potter... AH!” Draco thrashes as Potter finds the thin skin of his loosened, moistened rim and
Potter looks fascinated. “Head of Veela Affairs, huh? Good for you, Malfoy.”
“Did you ever call that twink you took home from at the club last Friday?”

Harry grins, Summoning his own little duffle bag and pulling out his towel. “Give Luna my love,” he says, wiping his messy face. “Haven’t caught up with her in ages. Tell her to drop by sometime if she likes.”

“How’d you meet him?”
“Yes, but the
“Malfoy,” Harry says, carefully lifting both hands in front of him, “Calm down. Put your wand away. I just want to talk for a bit. I’m sorry, alright? I’m sorry I tracked my owl. But I was worried and needed to check that you were doing alright. Just...put your wand away.” Harry waits, watching the way Malfoy’s lower lip wobbles, Adam’s apple bobbing as he swallows loudly. “Lower your wand, Draco,” Harry tries again calmly, “before you accidentally take one of my balls or something.”
“Potter...?”

hurt, in that defensive, arrogant way of his, and I find myself short on patience even though the fact that I’ve probably caused him hurt makes me feel godawful.
“I wish we were smart enough to take advantage of the kids being out of our hair,” Draco says, stroking Harry’s swollen mouth with his thumb. “We ought to get our sleep.”
“Shut it, Malfoy,” I say fondly.
Harry was in the bedroom, folding and sorting laundry, and Draco’s mind started to wander from the Liver Strengthening potion recipe to form a mental list of all the things he’d need to buy the next day at the supermarket. Letting the book fall closed in his lap, Draco sighed and rubbed at one eye with his forefinger, the room swimming before him just as something blue flashed across his vision.
“’Morning,” Harry says, leaning across the island so Draco can peck him on the mouth.
It proves unnecessary though because then Ron says loudly, “Oi, mate! Ginny nicked the Snitch from her last match. Want to fly a game or two?”
“You don’t want to be friends?” Potter asks serenely.
“Maybe,” he says. “Or maybe I wasn’t paying attention.”
Harry tilts his head with a wry smile. “Because...men don’t usually possess tear ducts?”

Harry wants to ask but decides it’s prudent not to because Hermione simply nods at once and doesn’t prod him further, and Malfoy darts Harry a murderous look that clearly warns him of his impending doom were Harry to choose to ask about the tenderness.

with you?” Malfoy hisses at Harry with a wrathful glower, almost crushing his fingers.
“It was foolish of you to leave, Lucius,” Harry says, unable to keep the sneer out of his voice. “You’re lucky you weren’t immediately thrown into Azkaban upon being found violating the terms of your acquittal.”
When he turns, Harry’s standing right there, practically nose to nose with him, and Draco can’t help the soft splutter of surprise he emits.
“Good, good,” Hermione nods again, “Here are some pamphlets you can go through at your own convenience – basic do’s and don’ts, dietary requirements and restrictions, frequently asked questions and such. Is there anything you’d like me to clarify right now?” she adds gently.
Malfoy quirks an eyebrow at him. “Because you regularly attend fetes?”
“And my son-in-law,” Narcissa retorts smoothly. “Surely I’m allowed to have a conversation with him in your absence?”

The glass window is abruptly slammed shut and Draco watches with his mouth hanging wide open, his heart thundering inside it, as the old elf first folds up the receipt and tucks it into its toga before carefully lifting the vial off the counter with both hands, long, wrinkled fingers gingerly handling the glass.
Harry had also gotten a golden snitch tattooed beneath the nape of his neck after losing to Draco at a Seeker’s match. Draco had been gleeful and extremely smug, not to mention relieved because they had made a bet that the loser would get the tattoo the very same day and Draco had been terrified at the very notion of having ink punctured into his skin and left there permanently. Personally, the only marks he liked having on himself were the ones Harry left on him.
“Fuck, you’re damn near impossible,” he shakes his head, watching Malfoy blow his pinkened nose into the apron, “Are you alright?” he adds quietly.
“Not a lot of people around much now, of course.”
“Malfoy, wait,” Potter laughs, holding one hand up, “I’m a registered werewolf who has to collect
“Then why are you--?”
“Well, if it helps at all,” Malfoy reaches out slowly and lays a tentative hand on Harry’s arm, “nobody’s forgotten what you did. I doubt people

“But of course...you didn’t even tell your friends about it, so,” Draco shrugs, “as a
Hermione sags back in her chair with a weary sigh and rubs her eye with her knuckles. Ron looks rather queasy as he stares at me for confirmation and I suddenly realise that none of it even matters.
“Too bad, eh?” Malfoy rasps, his voice trembling. “I bet you’d have loved for them to have been escorted to Azkaban instead.”
“Are vegetables banned on one’s birthday?” Draco retorts dryly, but turns his attention to Lyra, leaving Scorpius to vigorously push his food around, and out of, his plate. “One bite, come on,” he says, gently pressing a spoonful of mushy peas to Lyra’s chocolate smeared mouth.
And then, just as Harry is pulling down the tin of tea, Malfoy speaks again, soft and almost breathless with fevered suspicion. “It’s the baby, isn’t it?” he says, voice quavering. “You want to take this baby away from me. You want to keep it for yourself and throw me back in that hole. You want to take it away and have me thrown in
His insides lurch violently and he can only stare with his lips parted as Potter slowly lowers and then gently drops Draco’s hand. He’s blushing too, but doesn’t seem ruffled or awkward about what he’d just done. The part where Potter’s warm, damp lips had touched Draco’s hand is all Draco can focus on as he ogles at him.

“Fucking--
“Fucking Malfoy. Of no help whatsoever... Could’ve at least told me where to head... Still an utter shit... I should’ve hexed him.
Draco starts to laugh and when Potter’s scowl only intensifies he only laughs harder, resting his forehead in one hand and snorting with helpless guffaws. “Veela technique,” he repeats, eyes squeezing shut with mirth. “Oh, Merlin—”
, Potter, I’m tired
“First of all, this isn’t about the actual Morgana,” Malfoy says, rolling his eyes exaggeratedly. “This is about a witch who’s separated from her—” He blushes faintly when Harry grins and raises his eyebrows. “Put away your teeth before I knock them in, Potter,” he snaps irritably. “I can’t possibly have you read me

you’re not a threat,” Malfoy hiccups, voice hoarse and wet, muffled by his hands.
Draco remains stiff as he’s nuzzled. “Are you going to?”
“Is it now?” I ignore the soft squeak Ron lets out at Hermione’s comment. “It’s wonderful that I feel this way about one of my closest friends, who, oh wait, has a boyfriend.”
“Oh, I think your dazzling personality would’ve more than kept all and any idiots away, Malfoy,” Harry informs him coolly, leaning against the wall behind Hermione’s chair and pushing his hands into his pockets.
“Well, you bought new robes, that does count for something,” Malfoy points out, licking a smear of chocolate off his lower lip.
Finally, the water turns clear as it burbles down the drain and Draco shuts it off with a careless flick of his hand, stepping out onto the bathmat, fetching a towel and vigorously drying Harry off before letting him step out as well, patting himself dry carelessly as they make their way out to their bedroom.
intensity.
“I’ve been in Paris – work related,” she replies, tossing her long sheet of dark hair back over one bare shoulder. “You’re looking good, Potter. We should fuck.”
“Ebony.”
Draco rolls his eyes. “He puts on an actual facemask every time I go over there.”
!” Malfoy spits back hotly, darting him an irritated look.
“Please,” Malfoy chokes out, rutting his cock in increasingly fevered strokes through the rigid circle of Harry’s hand, twisting and jerking each time Harry teases his cock under the glans and pinches the slit to squeeze out a drop of precome. He moans and flails under him, thighs falling wider and wider open, chest and swollen belly heaving with his laboured breathing, and when Harry finally crouches between his thighs and replaces his hand with his mouth, Malfoy screams hoarsely and immediately fucks deep into Harry’s throat. “Fuck! Potter,
He stares at me, his eyes very large. “Sure?” he says uncertainly.
ago,” Harry says with a sigh, clenching his hands as another bout of tremors surge through him.
Malfoy nods, wiping the corners of his mouth neatly. “Earl Grey, if you have it.”
“I thought you told him the appointment was to ensure that the foetus and he are doing okay,” Hermione mutters, not looking up from the file she’s perusing.
Harry doesn’t read the letter. He doesn’t even open it. He flicks a finger at it, and sends the envelope straight into the fire, not glancing up at Draco to see his reaction.
Nursing his foot, Draco drew himself a bath. He decided that a nifty hex or two along the bedroom doorway and around the wardrobes that would send out electric shocks should instantly ensure that the stupid creature would get nowhere near his clothes again.
“Hello to you too,” Ginny blows him a kiss as she saunters in, kissing Hermione’s cheek and then flinging herself at me.
“Why did you say yes?” Harry whispers, ashamed at the petulance in his tone.
, I forgot to let the butter soften,” he hisses suddenly, darting over to the fridge.

Draco turns just as Harry comes lumbering into the room, looking like he might burst into tears any second as he slumps facedown onto the bed with a sobbed groan.
It’s like a punch to the stomach and Draco is left reeling as he stares in shocked silence at Harry.
Potter groans even as he chuckles along. “Better still, throw away that rubbish for me,” he rubs his face with both hands, gathering his hair in the same movement and pushing it off his shoulders, holding it back as he rests his elbows on the table and hangs his head between his forearms. “That fucking potion has got to be the worst part of this whole thing –
“You just left,” Harry whispers again and Draco glances at him to see him wipe away a single tear tracking down his cheek. “Didn’t even ask me if
“Don’t be stupid,” Harry says at once, kissing him once more. “And even if
“What do you want me to say?” Malfoy laughed. Harry waited. Then, “I may be persuaded to do this again – though preferably never again in a fucking loo stall.”
“Ice cream,” he replies, producing a gigantic tub from the bag and opening my freezer.
“You did,” Draco mumbles, rubbing his face to hide it.
But Malfoy doesn’t look. He stumbles back a step, shoving one arm into his shirt sleeve, either not noticing or not caring that the garment is inside out. He throws Harry another frightened look as he backs away. “I don’t know if it’s the effect of some brain injury you suffered, Potter, but I know a lunatic when I see one and I’m not going to wait around to confirm whether I’m right.”
Draco doesn’t realise he’s giving Potter an incredulous, slightly pained look until Potter’s smile slowly vanishes and he leans forward, looking wary and worried all at once. Draco clears his throat and looks away, altering his expression into one of easily accessed impassivity.
“Get them off.”
on you.”
as ever, Malfoy had been
“He is not going to show anyone anything in public,” Granger stated firmly. “Malfoy,” she added and suddenly Draco wasn’t grinning anymore. “Would you like to join Harry for a drink? Ron and I were just leaving.”
Draco shushes him softly, leaving his cock with a final, long lick up the shaft, and then kissing his way up that faint line of hair leading to his navel. He presses greedy hands all over Potter, stroking his thighs, his heaving stomach, reaching up to tweak dark nipples. Potter is blissed out and boneless under Draco’s hands and mouth, squirming slightly when his navel is tickled. Grazing his teeth across the flat expanse of his midriff, Draco mouths his way to the large, grisly bite mark on Potter’s hip. He can just about make out where razor sharp teeth had sunk in – those marks are paler than the rest of the twisted scar. The healed skin feels fragile and wrinkled under Draco’s tongue as he laves gently over the entirety of the scar.
Harry looked up. “A Patronus?” Malfoy nodded. “That’s... Wow.”
Harry bent over, his pyjama bottoms riding low enough for Draco to see the top of his crack, and with a tug produced Draco’s white shirt, now covered in dust bunnies and chunks of dried ferret food.
With a rumbling growl that he shocks himself with, Draco gears into action. Following Potter’s own suggestion, Draco plants his knee sharply into Potter’s side, rejoicing in the yelp of pain he gets out of the fucker as he rolls him right over with a dull thud of his fat head hitting the rubber mat, yanking his wrists free long enough to scrabble for Potter’s wand, pulling out the length of holly from where it’s tucked into the elastic waistband of his track pants and jabbing the tip into his throat. His cock is pressed into Potter’s flat, hard belly, and Draco stays carefully hunched over so it stays out of sight.
“Oh, yes, there’s a hint of that
It’s what he said to console himself as he lay there, fucking

“Can you take it easy with the cloak?” Harry snaps irritably. “You’re wearing robes, and anyway, nobody’s going to be able to see your bump from way over
The line went dead and Harry stared down at the bright red receiver for a full minute.

for you.” Weasley rakes a hand through his hair, looking absolutely done with everything, before sighing through his nose, regarding Draco steadily. “You’re all he has right now and I think he’s already head over tits for you. Don’t put yourself in a situation where you’re not only in danger, but where
Before walking out any further, Harry scanned the skies, wand gripped tightly. He wondered if he even had the mental capacity to create a Patronus if need arose.
Harry grins lewdly. “That’ll come
It’s Draco.
“Then go home,” he answers coolly, pointedly stepping out of the way as the smoke starts drifting towards him. “Go to bed.” He starts walking away, shoulders stiff, fingers clenched around the half-eaten bag of chips.
Potter sniffles softly, giving Draco a tremulous little chuckle and throwing an arm around Granger’s shoulders. “Shut up,
Draco smiles softly, running his hand over Harry’s chest, palm grazing the raised buds of his nipples. “Let’s hope the crying isn’t a regular part of it,” he says softly, pressing his hand down over Harry’s heart when he feels him stiffen. “But you can always just ask if you feel like being bossed around,” he adds at once.
They talked after that, a lot: while studying together each evening, and then starting to walk to their classes together, eventually even sitting together during the lessons they shared. Malfoy helped Harry with Potions and Transfiguration, Harry helped him with practical Defence and some Advanced Charms he’d inadvertently learnt by himself over the previous few years. Eventually they started sitting beside each other at mealtimes, sharing common room passwords, playing chess before bed during the week, and flying together after breakfast during the weekends. Eventually they didn’t wait for lessons, or homework, to start spending time together.
“Since when do they...take away their victims?”
“It was not,” Potter says, still unnervingly steady and calm as he prowls closer. “That was Timothy McGraw; he’s the manager for the Holyhead Harpies.” Draco is rooted to the spot, almost certain that he’s been stealthily Body-Bound, when Potter finally stands inches away. “He brought over my contract to sign; I’m coaching the team for three months.” There’s a pause as Potter’s eyes narrow, his head slowly tilting. “Do you genuinely believe I’m attracted to him?” he asks softly, his tone making it clear that he believes Draco to be fantastically stupid.
He stands rooted to the spot as Potter approaches him, slowly winding his arms around Draco’s waist and leaning in to give him a sound, lingering kiss. Draco hears his wand clatter to the floor as he buries both his hands into Potter’s hair and opens his mouth for his tongue. His cock twitches against his thigh and Potter makes an odd, growling sound in his throat, pulling back and fixing Draco with a piercing look.
Harry is throwing his whole being into fucking Draco, thrusting hard at a swift, pounding rhythm, Draco arse greedily gulping him in, lube and precome squelching out of him with slick, squishing sounds that only serve to further stimulate Draco, the crassness of it somehow immensely hot. He’s throwing his hips up onto Harry’s cock, baring his teeth and tearing his nails down Harry’s chest as he leans further over Draco, slinging his knees over his shoulders and bending him in half.
, Malfoy.”
Hermione’s crooked little smile is uncomfortably telling. “Yet.”
using a Boggart-Dementor, then?” he demands.
Draco’s jaw is sore and his chin is slick with spit and precome by the time he pulls off, laying an open-mouthed kiss over the glans when Harry groans dolefully. His cock is flushed deep red, throbbing in Draco’s hand, the slit dribbling near constantly; when Draco dips his head lower and noisily sucks Harry’s balls into his mouth, they throb too.
“Well... Would you still look out for him after he’s given you what you want?” she questions tentatively, and Harry just stares at her, speechless and so openly horrified, that she instantly looks guilty. “I didn’t mean—” she starts.
