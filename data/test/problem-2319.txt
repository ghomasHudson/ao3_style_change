"Just?", Ron raised a deep ginger eyebrow, his freckled face showing bemusement.
Magenta. A very rare color to catch Draco's attention, due to it being bright and loud, most of the time it only made his head hurt. But today, it was well welcomed like a distraction from the situation he had with Harry. The magenta reminded him of jewels, diamonds, and everything expensive and hard to find. He noted how the color shimmered every time the girl moved, like glossy plastic which it was obliviously made of.

Parkinson had dark hair. Right? Wouldn't it perfectly go with Draco's lovely white strands? It was disgusting.
Please remeber you're loved ♡♡
Also, I am always here to hear anyone out, please remember that you are not alone, find me on tumblr as leaphyy.
Draco almost laughed at the sudden change of Harry's mood, and noted how the whole room felt way too hot. He dreadfully realized it was not from all of the confusing feelings he got every time him and Harry were close, but from the potion that now seemed to smoke a bit.
Green. Green as in Draco's silk bedding that he sooner felt rather than saw. His bedding was brand new, downy and rather warm from Draco's body that lay in it for the whole night. It was illuminating the dull colors of the mossy green room, yet not so much that it drastically stood out. It was like a newly grown flower, planted in an old garden full of history and stories, waiting to soon become one of them.
Red. He took notice of Pancy's red earrings which were the exact same shade as her lipstick.
"What about my notebook?", Harry said as he showed his books into his bag, "Not that it has anything written in it, really, but it might become useful at some point."
Draco Malfoy, who are you really?
And with the look of surprise all over Hermione's face, Harry was sure she would drop it. But she didn't.
"Were't you supposed to have that already done?", muttered Draco as he drowsy got up and made his way towards the tan boy, trying to suppress a yawn, but failed, "Correct me if I'm wrong, but you could've found time yesterday." He narrowed his eyes as he took notice of the Charm and Potion notebooks.
"Just my luck, I guess.", Draco forcefully said, wanting the whole conversation to end, "Yes? Is there anything you may want from me?"
"So you're basically telling me that I'm a lost cause-"
Draco's hand shot up towards his hair, shamefully petting it down, not believing that he was called out like that. By the sound of Blaise's muffed laugh, he assumed that he was only making it worse.
Aside from being in a really bad mood, having no appetite and feeling a growing headache, he cherished the moment and wished for it to never end. He didn't feel happy, mind you, nor was it fun to listen to these idiotic dorks insult each other, yet he did feel at ease. Only if it were't for those green eyes he still felt at the side of his head.
"Nonsense! Don't go discouraging Harry, Ron!", Hermione said while crossing her eyes and sending Ron a stern look.
And with that thought, he launched himself onto his uncle's shoulders, and ignoring the yell of surprise, started scratching his eyes as forcefully as he could. He scratched and scratched, until he could see his uncle's blood on his fingers. He wanted him to feel pain, for he must be punished for taking away something which only belonged to Harry. Everything after that became a blur, he gave into his ugly and burning feelings which he hid for so long, and was not in control of his actions whatsoever. He remembers being thrown off, and with one last look at his uncle, witnessed Nuri being ripped apart one by one.
"Please, Harry, just promise us this,", Hermione started while moving a bit towards Harry to lower her voice and whisper in his ear, "No matter the circumstances or reasons, you'll always tell us what's going on in that head of yours, alright?"
"Potter! Harry Potter! Get your filthy hands off of my friend-", Parkinson screeched, nails drawing blood on Blaise's hand who was currently firmly holding her from storming over the yellow fog towards them, "You've hurt him! You've hurt our Draco! I won't forgive you for this! Let go of him, now-".
There was silence in the classroom, and Draco faintly progressed when Potter took a few steps back, cursed a loud "Not again!", and quickly brought up his hand to his nose to protect it from the spicy, rotting smell. Draco hardly progressed anything, from the loud chaos that escalated quickly in the room, to Pansy and Blaise calling out to him, telling him to just move due to them not daring to take a step closer to the smoke.
Yet, as much as he knew he didn't have a choice, he wanted to see what the future held for those lovely green eyes that never left his mind.
"Try not to make this a habit," Draco snickered, as he moved away from Blaise's bed and towards his wardrobe to pick up his clean clothes for the day, "After all, two days in the row of making the same mistake is quite impressive, Blaise." He settled for a dark green, flowy, long sleeved blouse and dark gray pants, "I've never knew you had it in you, keep up the good work and you might just not pass this school year." He took his dark green cloak, ruffling his hair and not bothering to make it pin straight, "Pans and I will greatly miss you.", he faked a cry as he picked up his black shoes and bag and headed to the bathroom to get ready for the day, might as well get dressed right away after he's done with his shower.
"Malfoy, I swear to Merlin-", Harry grumbled, annoyance clear in his voice. He dumped the plant into the potion in one go, not caring about the splash it made, before looking over towards the other boy.
But he did not lie, the suspicion about the blonde was still there. The threat about Draco being a possible death eater was still high, and Harry would soon find out about it, one way or another, no matter the worry he felt for the blonde.

"Still doesn't excuse you from being an imbecile." Said Draco sharply as he swooned a little.
Draco stared as his yesterday's wounds, which did not have enough time to heal not even a tiny bit, bared the weight of the new ones. They were screaming to be covered up in a bandage and left alone until they healed, and Draco was having none of it. He drew his blade over his skin once again, but this time fully down the middle of his left forearm. He hissed as the new wound hurt a lot more than the other ones, noticing that he accidentally made the cut a bit too deep. His vision became a bit blurry, and he decided that he should clean up the mess, take care of the cuts, get dressed and head to the Great Hall to meet his friends for breakfast. He wondered where the sudden appetite for a cup of coffee came from.
Hurt him.
"But I've never leaned how to do that!", Blaise whined a bit and didn't bother to keep his voice down, Theodore's warning falling deaf to his ears, "Theo! You know how to do that, right? Come and help a bloke out, mate!".
Not only that, but he was sure the blonde boy was hiding something from the world's eyes, and that only made Harry's curiosity hungrier. He was sure Draco Malfoy was up to something, and that something ought to be evil in his case.
Harry decided it was not his own fault the white blonde boy reminded his so much of his overly loved dragon Nuri. The one he, no matter how much he tried, still could not forget.
"Well..", Hermione started, only to be interrupted by Ron.
The confusion from earlier soon became guilt, but it quickly faded to disgust as he took a step away from the platinum blonde.
"Harry?", called Hermione, quickly walking towards him before crouching down and picking up the books. Once finished, she left them in her hold. "Are you alright?".
And again for the second time, he hoped tomorrow would never come.
Blaise leered a little, as he huffed out a proud "Maybe-" , and before he could say anything else, a quiet thump could be heard, and both pair of eyes casted downwards, only to be greeted by the reason for their sudden silence.
What he didn't expect, however, was for Potter to suddenly bring it up.
'Will tomorrow come? Will Draco remember today? Will he eat again, or will he settle for coffee again? Will he choose the dark green thick sweater, or will he wear the thin dark gray turtleneck instead?'
He shook away the last thought, knowing that the Dark Lord wouldn't finish him right away. Slowly torturing him as he burned out like every singe candle in the manor, one by one, seemed more like his cup of tea. Draco soon found himself wishing that he was already dead, but still couldn't bring himself to feel any need to do something about the situation. It didn't matter to him either way.
He forcefully looked away. Describing colors was not supposed to be stressful for him, it rarely happened, but when it did he quickly tried to find something else to catch his attention before he could have a meltdown. That something being his burn again, but its texture instead of its color this time. It's way bumpy, swollen and it had painful and angry blisters all over, His skin seemed to have melted in a few spots, leaving a deep purple mark behind. He cringed at how his veins screamed at him in pain, and how the whole thing looked like a mess and it was such a nuisance. He couldn't even move his hand, let alone close it. it was such a bother, he hated it and he wanted it gone. Bruises and cuts, that he could handle, but burns? Burns were something he had no intentions of experiencing, let alone  having the consequences to deal with.
-Clementine
He hated every second that passed, knowing it meant that tomorrow was coming closer and closer, and after that he did not have anymore time to fix that damned vanishing cabinet. He was at total loss. He didn't have enough time, every second was ticking and he was just wasting it. He was doomed, and there was not much he could do about it, for he had tried almost everything.
And Draco steadily blinked as he became fully aware that this didn't happen for the first time, nor did it escape his notice that they went shopping with Pansy two days ago, not yesterday. His head suddenly started hurting, and his stomach growled reminding him that he didn't eat a single thing yesterday. The mistake was on Blaise's part, Draco decided, as it was way too early in the morning to make sense of Blaise's nonsense.
Ron and Hermione shared a look, and when they failed to catch onto the lie, smiled softly and started moving towards the common room. The pleasant silence was filled with their bickering.
"I do.", said Ron, sending Harry a bemused smile, "You totally suck mate. You're even worse than me. Sorry, but not sorry.".
A yellowish green is associated with sickness and jealousy, so which color is possessiveness?
Pink. The burn reminded him of so many shades of darker and lighter red and pink. His indecisiveness of not being able to pick a color for the burn started to bother him and made him feel uneasy, so he decided to settle with pink. Or maybe a salmon red. Or maybe a deep coral-
"Yes?", Harry bit out, trying to keep the waver out of his voice.
Harry softly smiled to himself when he remembered their unscheduled meeting. Draco was kind of adorable when he was embarrassed.

Violet. Violet for the birthmark of a fourth year Gryffindor in his Astronomy class. It was very dominant on the boys face, and Draco had to take a few looks to make sure it wasn't drawn on. He could see how the boy fidgeted a little, avoiding everyone's gaze while talking. He quickly came to the conclusion that the boy must be shy or ashamed to have it on his face. Draco thought he should't be ashamed to have something with such a pretty color on his face.
Draco quickly packed all of his belongings and walked towards the door, being fully aware of the almost impossible to ignore pain, and shot a glance towards Pancy and Blaise. The whole classroom was aware of the present happenings, so when the both of the shot him a wink and thumbs up, he felt better for closing the door with more strength than necessary after he heard their earned detention.
He quickly averted his eyes.
Harry waited a bit, around a few minutes or so, only relaxing and letting his concern fade when he saw the other's eyes clear a little. Harry looked at him, glancing up and down and making sure he was not harmed, and when he saw no injuries, lessened his grip on Draco's shoulders and carefully continued to stroke Draco's arms in a gentle pattern, an act full of comfort and care. Only when he felt the still dazed boy occasionally tense up under his touch, did Harry hesitantly stop comforting him, and with a last squeeze, let go of the boy completely. Harry couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed at how much the other distrusted him, apparently so much that Harry's touch disgusted him and made him uneasy.
They were never together, no, they just helped one another out into finding out about their sexual preference, maybe a bit more times than they should have. They did come to an agreement though, one rule which was strictly followed, 'Whatever this is, don't call it love'. It helped them control their feelings, and kept them from accidentally developing feeling which would only be in the way and start drama later on. At the end both of them were ready to accept that they like boys. That was at least a year ago, but Draco remembers it well enough as if it was yesterday.
Maybe it might have been a bit harsh saying that the handsome boy before him was the main cause for his miserable decisions. Deep down, Draco knew he himself was being responsible for all the actions he took and all of the consequences those actions had. Yet blaming all of his wrongs on someone else felt so much better.
Orange. Such a bright and deep orange, someone could mistake it for a fire.
Also, wasn't Draco supposed to be dead by now?
"I would call it practice, my dear friend." Blaise smirked as he put his hands on Draco's cheeks, clearly making him pay attention to him "Also, it gives off a mysterious aura, and the girls go crazy over that." There was a glow in his eyes.

That would mark the third time he screwed up the same potion, and erupted chaos among his class. Everyone was shouting and doing everything and nothing at the same it thus not helping him with the situation at all. Everyone but one pale boy.
"Hey-"
The first thing he noticed, while he was still in a bit of a daze, was the fact that he was sitting on an old and well used table, Snape's table to be exact, legs over the edge, and Draco wouldn't argue if anyone pointed out his sudden stiffened posture. 'How muggle like', he thought when he felt how uncomfortable the hard and cold desk was, he almost preferred sitting on the dirty floor. He struggled a bit to get comfortable due to the same hands that were now on his shoulders, keeping him firmly in place. He slumped as he gave up on moving off of the table, or moving at all, feeling way too drained to fight off the owner of the hands.
⋆❀⋅❀⋅❀⋆
He watched dully as everything before his eyes came in synch as yesterday's happenings, even Blaise's words and the theft of his blueberry. This time, however, he decided not to comment about his nail polish at all for he did not care in a slightest bit. Also, he got his answer yesterday. They were over that conversation already, bringing it up again would only be weird for all of them.
do?", he finished cutting and carefully put the knife down, looking over the freshly cut plant and making sure it was done perfectly.
But he couldn't since there were no 'normal  days' to begin with.
After washing the toy and carefully fixing its delicate wing, the dragon looked brand new. Mostly because it was, but Harry still took pride into his sewing skills, even if they were a bit wonky. The red did horribly crash with everything else, just as Harry expected, but it somehow gave the dragon a unique touch. It gave it Harry's signature, something no other stuffed animal had. The red was personalised to Harry, so he grew to love the flaw. Harry looked over the dragon with awe and wonder, admiring its soft and pastel green color, sparkly pale wings and deep silver eyes. He ran his fingers against its wings, carefully tracing the angry red lines. He smiled to himself as he stroked its white scales all the way down towards its tail, which was doted with dark green dotes. His dragon was beautiful, and Harry loved everything about it.
"Didn't you just touch it?", asked Harry mentioning towards Draco's right hand, still not letting go of his wrist, clearly worried, "Shouldn't we check your palm first?"
"Hey,", he said slowly and carefully, fearing as if anything he says right now will only lead to chaos, "Just wondering what date today is?".
"Oh, I think I'm going to vomit,", whispered Blaise as he looked between the two boys, his whole pajama still full of ink, "Think you're done with that? I still need help, you know!"
Green. Green for the eyes that were currently watching him from afar.
His supplies were limited, since his aunt never liked doing any choirs around the house, sewing was one of them. He did manage to make the most out of it, finding a needle was a great start. However, when it came to the thread, he did not have such luck. After a while he did manage to find a red thread, which was buried deep down into one of his aunt's closets. Harry quickly took the thread and carefully made his way towards his cupboard, but when he closed the door, it was then when Harry hesitated. The harsh red would terribly crash with the soft and pastel green colors of the dragon, it would be even worse against the milky white delicate wings. After giving it a thought, he decided to go through with it no matter the color of the thread. The color itself would be a nice memory of Harry caring for the poor thing. The red against the wings would be just that, a fresh memory.
"Colors?", Harry asked as he looked over him, carefully making sure if Draco was alright standing on his own. 'Must be his damned hero complex.', Draco sourly thought. "Who would have thought! You usually wear dark clothes, green being the only exception of course." He smiled a bit at Draco's sudden blush who just then put two and two together and realised Harry was not making sure he was alright, but mocking his completely dark outfit.
Draco started to get up out of bed and pulled Harry with him, fixing his boxer briefs back so they covered his bits properly again. “Put some shorts on. You’ll see when we get down there.” Soon, both were properly covered and in the kitchen. Draco reached to the top cabinet where they kept their wine, which Harry never selected, and pulled down a small, wrapped gift with a gold bow on top. “Here you go.”
“Has it really been three months?” Hermione asked in a small voice. She seemed shell-shocked, as if such a thing were unthinkable. “They can’t give up on him. It’s Harry! We need him! What will they tell everyone? It’s not something you can just come out and say! What are they going to do? What are
“Why do I have a horrible feeling?”
“Well now, where are you two lovebirds off to?” Mrs. Zabini asked with a large smile. There were still tears in her eyes. It’s not everyday that your only son gets married to Harry Potter.
“Damn it!” Blaise swore. “I said I didn’t have time to explain and apparently you don’t know. Do you know where Draco is? Or where he could be?”
Snape kissed the robe of his master as all the others before him. “Of course, my Lord, you know I live to serve you and only you. I was not told of Malfoy’s heir leaving Hogwarts in any other means besides those which would transport him back to Malfoy Manor. I was even asked to brew several potions for him, and give them to the school mediwitch so they could be given to him.”
“He’s not touching my son!”
“Malfoy!”
“The Forest has its own wards,” Shaklebolt said, looking at the Map. “This is amazing. Where did you get it from?”
There was plenty more gesturing from Harry and lots of yelling and talking from Draco. After several minutes of this, Hermione leaned over and started explaining Muggle sign language to Ron: how it worked and why it was formed. While she was telling the story of a young girl named Helen Keller, Draco interrupted her.
Enough was enough. There were outbursts that needed to be had so the catharsis was over and done with, and there were temper tantrums. Harry would stand for this tantrum no longer.
“Ssso why wasss I not notified when he left in the firssst place?!”
“But, why couldn’t we see either of you? Why did you suddenly disappear, or become silent or whatever?” she asked.
“You… you said ‘our son’!” Harry cried. “It just sounds so good to finally hear that. Give me McKay, Theresa. I want him to get a good look at his real daddy. McKay, you remember Draco right? I showed you pictures of him and talked to you almost every day about him. Blaise is your other daddy, and I’m the daddy that carried you. But this is your real daddy. Do you remember?” McKay just giggled and reached out to Draco. Slowly, carefully, Draco picked the child up and held him. “You won’t break him, I promise.”
“Ah. Apparently you two were the last to realize you love each other. There was apparently a card game in – Not a card game? With a card game... A bet? Ah, there was a bet in Gryffindor on how long it would take you two to go exclusive. I can see that. Why you two couldn’t is what amazes me. Hey, who won the bet?”
“Yes, Mimsy. I am getting ready for my wedding. Follow me.” Now was the only time he’d really hated having to have the house elf with him at all times. It wasn’t as though he’d never gotten dressed in front of someone before, it was that he’d only been around Harry for the last five months. Being around someone new, even a house elf, was slightly distressing for Draco. As he was brushing his hair out and securing it in the clasp, he gasped. “That’s it! I know what to do for something blue! It will be perfect!”
“Okay, but if we get in trouble…”
After the second interview with Luna Lovegood for
“You did it again, didn’t you?” Draco said, his eyes on Harry. “What have I told you about that? If I don’t want to sleep then I’m not going to! You can’t do this alone! I need to-” He stopped suddenly and looked around, as if he was just realizing where he was. “We’re… we’re back? It wasn’t a dream?” He looked at Harry for his answer, and received a shake of the head. “Oh thank Merlin, Harry! You did it! You got us back!” He sat up quick and threw his arms around the dark haired boy’s neck, loudly weeping into it. “I thought it was a dream. I thought it was all a lie and that I’d wake up in your arms back in the Forest and wonder how the day would go. I was so worried that it was all a dream, that my- Harry? What’s wrong?” He pulled back and looked at Harry in concern.
“I’m sorry Blaise, but Draco’s not here.” She didn’t get to say another word as Harry’s knees gave out under him and he began to wail most piteously. “What the, what is wrong with him?” she asked over his sobs.
“After being on missions for so long, my Lord, some of the men were rather lonely. Numerous women and girls were raped before they were finally killed.”
happen. Got it? Okay then. On with the fic.
“Yes.”
It seemed Voldemort was
Blaise stood and went over to him, grasping him gently by the shoulders. “Harry, Harry look at me. It’s okay. I don’t appreciate being yelled at, and neither does Theresa. But we know why you’re doing this. A man was never made to get pregnant, and the chemical unbalance in your system is making what normal women go through twice as hard because you’re a man. I’m not saying it’s okay when you throw your tantrums, but we do understand why they’re happening. It’s okay, as long as you know you’re doing it and feel remorse for it, genuine remorse. Now, we were talking about you. Would you like to know why we were talking about you?”
“Shut it, Weasley! You know Potter's a queer as a two-knut coin!” an Auror co-worker called out, causing most everyone in the room to burst into raucous laughter. Then the music started, people started to party, and the food and drink began to flow. Dancing, talking with friends, munching on snacks. It was a great party, and it lasted for quite some time.
“Harry!”
The words appeared on the paper Madam Pomfrey had given him.
“When did he lose the ability to talk?” Snape asked, his embarrassment forgotten now.
This time, Harry came first. It was a rare happening, but one that both enjoyed to no end. Then again, the mere thought of Harry filling him with his come, of that come producing the child that lay within his belly, of Harry losing control like that, was enough to make Draco follow directly after. They cuddled again, Harry hunching in around Draco for warmth and protection and just so they could touch one another. Again, Draco thought that the day apart thing was sheer torture, but only allowed the thought for a few moments before he turned his thoughts back to the nirvana he was in now. Again, another Muggle term. But it fit.
Narcissa would take time to heal. The physical injuries, those were healed within a day. But the psychological injuries from her brutal beating and rape would take far longer. She seemed to do so much better after Draco told her about the baby. Once she had something to focus on, she really came out of her shell. That’s when Harry learned about the
“To take care of the pregnant wizard, of you.”
“More specifically?”
“Good night Hermione, Ron.” As Terry walked away, Hermione shut the door.
“No, but it’s bloody annoying not being able to feel anything. I mean, those are my bits down there!”
“Yes, Mr. Zabini. Mrs. Mitchsens and I are very happy together.”
“And that goes for you too, Severus.” They waited in silence for a moment before said man walking into the room with a scowl on his face. “Harry’s hearing, smell, taste, and magic are beyond advanced. He knew you were here before you even walked into the Infirmary. I didn’t expect you to linger at the door and listen in on our conversation.” He placed a hand over Harry’s as he began to gesture. “I expect both of you to get along, because I’m not leaving Harry, and I won’t stop seeing Severus. You’re both family to me now. I need you both.”
“Because my father was an arse and I wanted to make sure I lived through any meals I know he ‘oversaw’ or ‘checked’ before eating them,” Draco answered with malice in his voice. “Screw him. What are we going to do now? I won’t let you stay married to Blaise, no offense my friend, or McKay to remain a Zabini.”
If you want to.
“A quick question for Harry,” Poppy said at the same time. “Does Draco know about what we were talking about before you woke him?”
Across the potions room, to the Slytherin dorms
She mouthed her answer, but no sound came out. Before she could be questioned anymore, a loud sob came from the left side of the office. All eyes were suddenly on the boys there: Draco had his face buried in Harry’s chest and was clutching his robes tightly in his fists. Harry’s eyes were blazing; he had one arm wrapped around Draco and the other outstretched toward McGonagall. After a few moments, that hand lowered to wrap around Draco as well. He kissed Draco’s head, but kept his eyes glued on McGonagall.
Profero chorion – produce afterbirth – removing the afterbirth from Draco
“Okay, you may continue.”
But Harry did argue. It may have been silently with Draco speaking, but he was arguing. “He says he doesn’t need it and he doesn’t want it. He lost his glasses about three months in, and they were cracked long before then. His eyes slowly got worse and worse, and the nundu attack didn’t help any. He uses his magic to sense things around him. His hearing is amazing. He can smell and taste the smallest hint that something is off or wrong or added or whatever. And his magic is amazing. He does it wandless and ‘sees’ with it. Surely you can’t deny that?”
Harry held Draco’s hand and brushed two fingers over his cheek before repeating the sign on Draco’s cheek.
“How? How is that possible? Albus has tried before,” Pomfrey whispered frantically. “He couldn't do it!”
“That’s not what you were saying last week,” Blaise joked.
“It wasn’t too long after we returned, still hidden away mind you, that Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape were to be killed by the Dark Lord for their failures to him.”
“The Forbidden Forest.”
“Thank you Kipper,” Harry whispered. The house elf looked wide eyed at the man on the bed, blushed bright red, and disappeared in a hurry. “She’s sweet.”
Draco smiled now. “I felt the baby move.”
“Of course Headmaster. Would anything less be tolerated?” They both snickered at their private joke.
Before he could slam the door closed again, Blaise stuck his foot in the doorjamb and hit hand on the door to keep it open. “Damn it Harry! I know you’re going through a lot of shit right now, but you need to think for just a moment! I am here for you, and although I’m not him I am doing my best. I’m sorry that the one thing you need I can’t get you, but I am trying my best to get you anything and everything else that could help! Now, my mother is downstairs wanting some answers. And I think she could help as well.”
“Excuse me?!” Harry asked, jumping to his feet and swaying slightly. “I'll have you know that I happen to be the top more often than the bottom. Draco just happens to like my cock up his arse. And I just happen to like Draco on his knees. If you really want to know-”
“Draco. What exactly did I tell everyone last night?”
“Good,” Minerva said with a single nod. “You will continue to tell no one. If it weren’t so against my morals, I’d Obliviate you so you couldn’t tell anyone.”
To help get his mind off his physical condition, Molly would often discuss Harry’s birthday party. They’d skipped over Draco’s June birthday at his insistence because he said he was too large to celebrate, that he didn’t want anyone to see him that way. Harry had been a little upset at that, both because he wanted to celebrate his husband and because he didn’t like the idea of Draco resenting their child just because it made him fat for a while. Draco had rushed to assure Harry that wasn’t the idea at all and that it was just hormones and vanity talking and that
Harry Potter, yes? Well, the only people who know this marriage is a farce is you, Harry, Blaise, me, and Mrs. Zabini.”
“Draco, what happened?” Immediately, Pomfrey got to work, scanning the unconscious Gryffindor and Draco in turns to snuff out all injuries. Finding none on the young blonde, she turned her full attention on Harry. “Head trauma, magic depletion, physical exhaustion,” she rattled off quietly.
“I really don’t think now is such a good time, Lucius. They’re in that room just there.”
“And if he's badly injured and you can't get to him in time?”
Knowing better than to try and get Harry to talk about what had just happened, Theresa also pasted a fake smile on and nodded. “So far so good,” she whispered. “This is McKay’s heartbeat. And here he is. See? These are his feet, and here’s his head. He’s perfectly happy, so long as you don’t eat anything spicy, okay?” They laughed lightly, although it was strained. “Here, wipe off the goo and sit up again. We’ll see how you’re doing now.” She waved her wand over him to see how he was handling the pregnancy. “You seem to be doing okay. But take it a little more easy; you’re getting tired faster.”
Harry shakes his head. “No, it’s just chocolate. Remus always offers me some when I’m feeling down.”
It’s not that he cares about the bloody exams, or even about Malfoy’s career prospects, it’s just that after years of sharing classes with him, he had inevitably noticed that the Slytherin was very thorough with his homework, and seemed to care about school just as much as Hermione did, proven by the fact that he was second only to her in most of their classes.
And obviously, Draco had known that Potter had a life outside of school, that he must be doing something during his summers, but he had always thought that the boy was busy throwing himself into other adventures, and not sitting on his hands in a muggle suburb until two years ago where he was rescued by Black and Lupin.
“Potter, did you use the spell that was written in the book?” Snape asks, more so to confirm, since Harry is sure he already knows the answer. Harry can’t bring himself to make excuses or lie, not after what he’s just done.
A month ago, he would be revolted at the thought, but as he looks across the table at the black-haired boy with his glasses askew, in the midst of an animated retelling of their game, he feels oddly at ease.
“That I was a bigot?” he says, plucking a small potato with his fork and chewing it before he speaks again, with a hope that Potter would see it and pick up some table manners.
“Yeah, right,” he huffs and looks down on the book again so that he doesn’t have to meet Potter’s intense gaze.
, of all people, and it scares him.
“Don’t look at me like that!” Draco rises from his chair in order to leave the room before he starts crying again, and is about to push past Potter, when the boy grabs him by both arms, keeping them down to his side, and forces him to stay still.
He finds himself turning the conversation over in his head, trying to make sense of it all.
But Potter is nothing if not confrontational, so Draco can only hide away for so long before he eventually corners him in the library.
He draws the curtains around his bed and lays in a red-hued darkness, watching the specks of dust dance in the beam of sunlight that shines through a gap between his curtains, his head too full of thoughts to just
Harry graphs. “You’re one of them…”
“The point?”
Draco huffs. “Well I’m glad there’s at least one sensible person in your little group, or else you’d all be failing your classes.”
His mind is racing, trying to come up with something, anything, but he can’t make himself leave Malfoy’s side to find help, so he results to calling out, hoping that someone would hear him.
“Remus told me your exams went well, congratulations.”
It’s closer to dawn by the time the party dies down, and Harry, followed by Ron, makes his way to their dorm.
A moment passes, and it feels like an eternity, as Harry takes Malfoy in his arms and tries to shake him awake. He’s pale, much paler than he should be, and Harry feels a sense of dread take over, and calls out again.
Lupin meets his gaze with a look of disbelief.
“The one you use to cure yourself of hangovers,” Ron finishes for Harry, before he begins to fill up his plate with every single thing in his immediate radius.
At that, Neville’s face lights up, and he casts
Draco has to hold back a laugh. “Flattery will get you nowhere, Potter. Get to the point already.”
Draco wants to laugh then because it’s not comforting at all when it’s coming from Potter, who has a habit of getting him and his friends into near-death situations on an unnatural basis.
He looks up to meet Potter’s gaze over the top of the parchment and is horrified to find him looking
He writes back with things they can say, but he knows it’s in vain, because by the time exam week rolls around, everyone and their mother will know that he’s a filthy little blood traitor and there will be a price on his head when he returns to Hogwarts after the summer break, assuming he returns at all.
Harry leans in so that their faces are under a meter apart.
He decides to shower before heading down to breakfast, and afterwards, feeling somewhat refreshed, he puts on a fresh set of clothes, before making his way down to the Great Hall. He eats in silence, occupying an empty bench at the Gryffindor table, and when he’s done, he flees to the library until his detention, too exasperated to deal with the disappointing glances of his teammates that he’s sure to be met with as soon as they come down for breakfast.
In the middle of all of this, a very silly and insignificant worry pops up in his head, and he feels dumb as soon as he says it.
He realizes then, that Snape must know what he’s done, what he has asked the Order to do, and he’s not sure, he’s never sure when it comes to Snape, but he thinks he can see a bit of relief in the way his shoulders relax, as if...as if he
“You’re a pragmatist, Hermione. Of course, you have a cure for hangovers stashed somewhere.”
He looks down and turns on the faucet. The water runs red as he tries to wash Malfoy’s blood off his hands, scrubbing them manically until they’re burning, until they’re clean.
“Is it true? Did you and Malfoy fight last night?” Hermione asks. Harry nods, and then, he’s just about to tell them everything, right there in the hall, but thinks better of it and instead pulls them into an empty classroom and places a Muffliato charm on the door before he recollects last night’s events.
Harry snaps out of it and shrugs their concerned gazes off. “It’s nothing…”
Ron chews his lip, still contemplating.
“Get on with it then. I’m sure you’ll only get a rap over the fingers from Dumbledore, after all, nobody will miss the evil Slytherin.”
He sits, and notes that she only calls him by his first name when it’s something serious. His mouth feels dry, and he has to hide his hands in his lap, since he can’t stop wringing them in anxiety.
“It doesn’t, but it makes you look sloppy. At least cast a self-correcting charm, or write with a quill that does it for you if you can’t spell.”
“Found it,” Neville says, rubbing the back of his head with a grimace as he picks up the shoe.
if he wants, his only option is to stay put, like a good little boy, and let the adults decide what to do with him, which isn’t that much different than what he had just escaped from, and the irony is certainly not lost on him.
“That being said, I am aware that professor Snape is taking care of your punishment, a very fitting one at that, I must say. But…”
“Detention, every Saturday morning for the rest of the semester, and you’re lucky that it’s not a direct ticket to London.”
“I’ve seen evil, I’ve looked into Voldemort’s eyes and seen nothing but hate and insanity, but when I attacked Malfoy in the bathroom, he was
Maybe, Draco thinks, as he takes his place next to Lupin at the long table in the kitchen, they could even become friends.
in front of him, the way he whimpered like a first-year, as if his mother hadn’t taught him better than that.
“He’s a kid, just like me! He told me himself that his father made him do it…”
“You’re here,” he says, not so much a question as it is a statement.
“We’re trying to eat more Indian dishes to help Harry get in touch with his heritage,” Lupin says next to him, which surprises Draco since he hadn’t even thought that Potter had problems with that.
Draco holds down a whimper as Potter’s wand burrows into his skin. He’s about to object, about to provoke the other boy more but thinks better of it. It’s not smart trying to start a fight with him in his own home, let alone when his guardians are downstairs. So he drops it, even if his hands itch to hex him.
At that, Harry lets out a snort, which quickly turns into a giggle, and before he knows it, he and Ron are laughing so hard, Harry has to lie down too. However, as soon as he does, the soft mattress seems to swallow him whole, and soon enough, he closes his eyes and lets the sleep take over him. For once, he has a nice, dreamless night, where doesn’t wake up to the sound of his own screams.
“I’m here,” Draco answers dryly, not meeting his gaze and instead pretends to be too occupied with the book in his hands to acknowledge Potter any further.
“For almost killing me? Apology accepted, but next time, you should just use the killing curse, much less painful and doesn’t leave ugly scars.”
“They say you’re in your room a lot.”
“What is it? Is everything okay?” Harry asks, sitting on his bed and putting a Mufiliato charm on the door. Luckily, he’s alone, since explaining the other three why he’s talking to his old professor through a mirror would be a bit too much for a Sunday morning.
And now, he was a prisoner. They may not have said it out loud, but Draco wasn’t stupid, in fact, he was more perceptive than people thought. It was all in the looks they exchanged, the hushed voices and the permanent Muffliato charm on the door to the dining room.
“I promise, I’ll protect you.”
Hermione is fresh as a daisy and reading the morning’s paper when they join her at the Gryffindor table. Ginny’s already there, hunched over a plate of eggs and bacon and a big mug of coffee.
“Why does that matter?”
His head is throbbing and he’s too exhausted to make a decision. In the end, he buries the book underneath some clothes in his suitcase, which he then promptly shoves under the bed, before laying down again and covering his eyes with his arm.
“Malfoy…”
“I promise.”
Potter had promised to protect him when he can barely protect himself, and it’s ridiculous, not to say embarrassing, to trust someone like Potter, who stands for everything Draco is supposed to be against, and yet…
Relief washes over Harry instantly, and he must show it on his face, because Remus just smiles fondly.
“Sit, Harry.”
He takes another potato and makes the mistake of looking up. Potter is looking at him with that satisfied smirk again, and Draco raises an eyebrow at him. Potter just shakes his head and returns to his plate, and Draco mirrors him, confused at the warm feeling that spreads in his chest at that moment.
He closes his eyes and lays there, letting his thoughts wander. It was still hard to believe that he had offered Malfoy help, but he knew it was the right thing to do. Even with that mark on his arm, Harry did not see a Death Eater when he looked at the boy. A bully? Yes. His rival? Definitely. But a Death Eater? No.
“Talk to you later, Harry,” Remus simply says, and then Harry’s looking at his own exhausted reflection. He sighs deeply and plops down on his bed, with the mirror on his stomach. He has done all he can, and now it was up to the Order to decide.
Harry sits on the tiles for what seems like hours, but it couldn’t have been more than minutes. In the end, he gets up, and goes over to the newly fixed sink. He glances in the mirror, only to see a boy with bloodshot eyes and scrapes on his face.
“Wait, I told you that?”
But of course, he had given too much credit to Potter's ability to read between the lines, and the idiot continues on as if Draco has not made it clear that he is not in the mood for this conversation.
“Are you enjoying your meal?” Potter asks, at first glance genuinely, but then Draco sees the wrinkles in his eyes as if he’s holding back a laugh.
They must be putting something in the water at Gryffindor, because it’s so obvious to any person capable of complex thought, that Potter did not come to make small talk, and is simply stalling for time, thinking that he has to warm up to the thing he actually wants to say, when in fact, there is no need, because Draco is seventeen, not five, and can handle whatever it is Potter wants to tell him.
He passes with flying colours, of course, he expected nothing less, and is only a bit flustered when Lupin congratulates him on his marks. Afterwards, he is exhausted, but satisfied nonetheless.
“He’s not evil, professor,” he finally manages to get out.
He’s fine, honestly, they don’t need to worry about him, but he appreciates it nonetheless, even if it does make him feel guilty at times. He knows he’s prone to attract danger, in fact, it seems like that’s the only thing he does, but he can’t help it.
He feels a headache coming on and has to lie down for a moment. He stares at the ceiling, trying to justify Potter’s actions, trying to explain them, but he can’t. He can’t understand why he would do this, why he would save
In the library, he takes out his charms essay, and tries to work on it for the next three hours. He’s sitting by an open window that’s looking over the quidditch pitch, and can hear the students make their way towards the stands shortly before the match starts. He wills himself not to look, knowing that it will only serve to make him miserable, and instead stares intently at his essay, reading the same passage over and over.
He wants to hex him, just so he’d stop looking at him, but then he would have a new problem to deal with, so instead, he just averts his gaze and walks past him towards the door. Potter lets him through without objections, which he is thankful for.
Harry has no idea where this sudden empathy comes from, just yesterday, he didn’t hesitate to shoot a curse at his rival, but after seeing him in the hospital wing, crying because he was sent to kill his headmaster, something clicked in Harry’s head, and his protection instincts were activated. He knew then, that he had to save him, had to help him, before it was too late, before Malfoy became what he clearly feared to become - a killer, a Death Eater,
All this time, the boy who he’s been taking advice from, who’d help him through a subject he hated, all this time, that boy had known a dark spell that could have killed his rival. Harry wants to throw the book away, or better yet, burn it, to make sure that no one ever saw the spell written in its margins.
Harry shrugged his shoulders with his hands palm up beside him in the air. He pointed at Snape, pointed at himself, then intertwined his fingers together.
“Do you really mean it Blaise?” Harry asked. “You really want to stay here? This is where we’d live?”

She left and Harry warded the door before turning to Draco. He lightly scraped his fingertips over his right cheekbone before doing the same to Draco’s left cheekbone.
“Harry?” Blaise asked groggily as he sat up. “Are you okay? What’s wrong? Did something happen?”
“I am in the middle of a lecture. This had better be-” Severus stopped mid-sentence when he saw just who was interrupting his classroom. There, standing in the doorway as if nothing had happened, was Draco Malfoy. And just behind him a step or two was Harry Potter. “Wha-? Where-?”
“No, it means he’s wanting to push but doesn’t know it. Give it just a few more minutes Harry. You’re not fully dilated. And if you’re not fully dilated, this is going to hurt like hell. Think of it as not having any preparation before having sex.” Harry and Blaise both winced. “Yeah, compare it to that. I have no clue what that feels like, but your facial expressions sum it up pretty well. I’m going to check again. Hold on.”
Harry looked up, fear in his tearful eyes. “What? What could you possibly want Blaise?” he whispered.
“Mmm, good morning my love. How did you sleep?”
“At least you knew the proper spells to place on him,” Snape said, still trying to help Lucius in his pain. Now that Draco was out of the room, Lucius was not holding back his anguish. “I need another dose of the potion, but I've never given two doses to anyone before. I am unsure as to the side effects. It could help him, or it could kill him.”

Hermione jumped off the rock and pulled her boyfriend along behind her as she ran all the way back up to Gryffindor Tower. Ron was shoved toward the stairs leading to the boys’ dorms to get the map from Harry’s trunk. That was another thing that confused them. If Harry was gone, wouldn’t he have taken his trunk with him? She didn’t think long on it as Ron came back down with the map in hand. “I solemnly swear I am up to no good,” he recited. Hogwarts slowly began to bleed onto the parchment in black ink. “Start at the top of Hogwarts and make your way all the way to the dungeons, then to the outside grounds,” he ordered, watching as the map moved around to show what he’d instructed it to.
. He didn’t bother with anyone else in the battle; he left that to his fellow Order members and allies.
“Of course, Poppy.”
“Please, Harry. Don’t try to deny it. It was obvious to anyone with eyes.”
“I led both of them to the birthing room I had set up early on and coxed them through everything from the temporary canal forming all the way through feeding McKay for the first time. I’ll spare the details, but suffice to say I am 100% positive it was Harry that gave birth that night. And I’m sure Blaise can attest to his hand being nearly broken from the pressure put on it.”
“Draco, is it true that you come of your own free will and accord?”

“I need your memories. No, I need just one of your memories,” she corrected. “The one of two days ago when Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy came into your classroom. I need to see it so I may see for myself what happened. Not that I don’t trust your word, Severus. It’s just that you may have overlooked something that I deem important or unusual for one or both of the young men in question.”
“Us? What about us? What’s changed with us?”
he corrected, blocking his path. “Severus? What is it? What’s happened?”
“Excellent!” came the jovial answer. “I do believe Madam Pomfrey wishes that you have a bit of both, Draco. It is cold this night, no matter how spelled your robes are. Harry, my boy, how is your salad?”
Harry’s grip on Draco’s shoulders tightened minutely, but enough that Snape could see it. He smirked. “Severus,” Draco warned, “if you bait him, I will not stop him from hexing you. Or make him reverse it. I don’t understand why you can’t play nice. Sometimes his mothering is annoying and I feel as if he’s smothering me. But at least I know he’s trying to help me because he loves me and wants nothing but the best for me. Sometimes I feel like you’re only helping so you can get Harry riled up so you two can fight. I will not be a part of this, gentlemen.” And with that, he stood and walked to his and Harry’s room. A second later, his voice rang out loud and clear. “And these two beds will soon be joined to make one bed!”
I got a brand new boyfriend.
After several minutes of silence and blank looks, Snape asked, “What just happened here?”
“Of course, Master Draco, sir! Just bes waiting one moment. I’s be moving yous.” The little elf raised her hands and muttered under her breath. Using her elf magic, she levitated Draco from the bath, magicked him dry, and wrapped a warm towel around him. Running over to another chair, she grabbed the robe there and helped Draco into it. “Yous be getting ready for yous’s wedding to Master Harry, Master Draco, sir?”
“Set him down there Severus,” she sighed, and immediately began working. “Calming Draught and Dreamless Sleep I believe will cover it,” she said after a few moments of silence.
“Ready, and here we go!
“What? Why?” Draco asked. “He’s already passed out. He doesn’t need either,” Draco said as his godfather went to a potions cabinet and retrieved two vials. “There’s no need to choke him! He’s already unconscious so he won’t-” He was cut off as Severus tilted his head back and forced the Calming Draught down his throat only to have it followed shortly after with the Dreamless Sleep. “Damn you… Sev…” Draco too went out like a light. Both he and Harry awoke the next morning.
Poppy turned to look at Draco only to see that Harry had drug him off the bed and backed them into a corner with Draco clutched to his chest protectively. “Be very quiet, Headmaster,” Poppy said softly. “You’ve spooked him something awful. I was able to get a preliminary readout on their injuries. Both have scratches and lacerations, bruises and sprains, dehydration and slight malnutrition. Both are in need of a shower and clean clothes. Mr. Potter has lost the use of his voice and eyes, possibly for good. Mr. Malfoy… Mr. Malfoy is pregnant.”
Several people flinched at the name, but most started nodding in agreement. Harry’s eyes flew up to meet those of his best mate, questioning his feelings. It wouldn’t be the first time Ron had turned against him if that were the situation here. Instead, it seemed Ron was excited for him.
I never seem to get a lot (ba ba da da, ba ba da da)
“McKay Draconis Zabini.” Draco’s head shot up, a fire in his eyes. “I married him to keep him from being in the spotlight of the news and papers. He’s had his own private suite just down the hall from my own at our place in France. I hired one of the best medi-witches around to help and she’s here with us today. Harry got real depressed after McKay was born and locked himself in his rooms. I finally got him to come out with the promise of taking him anywhere he wanted to go. He wanted to go island hopping, starting in Jamaica. I’ll go get them so you can meet your son. Hold on.”
“If you must know, I was in the midst of a relaxing bath. It was so rudely interrupted by your Gryffindor husband bursting into my private lavatory and summoning me from my tub where he then Apparated my dirty work robes onto me and physically pushed me in here. Where you stood catatonic and most distressed. Now that you are neither, I am going to return to my bath. Do. Not. Disturb me again.” In true Snape fashion, he whirled about and stormed off, slamming their bedroom door behind him.
Blushing profusely, Draco hissed, “
Harry nodded his head and Poppy was off to get the Quill and some parchment. “Okay, just touch it so it can read your magical signature. Very good. Now then, I have some questions about your time away from Hogwarts. How did Draco get pregnant?”
Even with their story out to the public, they weren’t to leave the castle. Draco, especially, was in now condition to go traipsing about Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley for baby furniture or supplies. First, Narcissa Malfoy had her personal house elf gather Draco’s baby things and bring them to the couple for perusal. After that, Molly Weasley said she could dig some things up too, and asked if she could knit a few things for the baby. Harry smiled at the ‘few’, knowing better. Draco thanked her and welcomed all gifts.
“With whom do you come and whose blessings accompany you?”
“What does he understand? Why did you call in? A Sober-Up Potion and I'll be fine.”
It was silent in the hall. McKay, sensing something was going on, was quiet in Harry’s arms. Theresa didn’t say a word. She was sure the others had forgotten she was even there. Blaise slowly sat in his chair once more. After a few moments, he gently cleared his throat so as not to scare Harry when he spoke. “I think you need to get out of this house and go somewhere. You were cooped up for your pregnancy, and you’ve hidden away in your rooms for five months now. Where would you like to go?”
Wild gesturing.
“By doing as he was told, yes. Do you know what he is told to do? He was told to do it then, and he’s told to do it now.”
She didn’t hesitate for a second. “It’s none of your business.” The three other doctors gasped at her audacity while Blaise just smiled and sat back. “This is Harry’s pregnancy, and I know there’s something out of the norm going on here. I believe that you are married, but… and I’m sorry if I overstep my bounds, but you have always called him Harry. You don’t have any pet names for him. You mentioned you were married within the last week, but his pregnancy is two months along now. If I were to become Harry’s mediwitch, I would talk to him about everything. If he wished you present, so be it. If there was something he did not want you to know, I would not tell you. Unless it was life threatening. I am not asking that you tell me what’s going on; it’s none of my business. I am here to take care of Harry and his baby.”
“You should care about your health, Draco,” the headmaster urged. “It is of greater importance, now more than ever.”
While Snape’s face turned an alarming shade of red, Draco looked at Harry in confusion. Hurriedly, Harry began moving his hands in weird twists and shapes. After a few moments, Draco nodded and smiled softly. Then he laughed outright before turning to his godfather. “They thought you were after the Philosopher’s Stone? Well that’s a laugh!”
Draco turned to see what Harry’s answer would be, but found his lover dead asleep on the bed he’d been pacing in front of. The pen and paper floating next to him paused in its writing of his thoughts. “Sleep well, Love. You need it.”
Even though he couldn’t see it, Harry blushed. “O-only if you’re okay with it.”
“Any of what?”
More congratulations, more gifts, and more letters of encouragement were sent by the adoring public. Certainly there were howlers and negative letters too, but Dumbledore and Snape edited those out and burned them. Despite hating the idea of being ‘handled’, Draco was secretly happy they were keeping the negativity away. It was bad for his mental health, especially this late in the pregnancy. Almost daily Narcissa and Molly were at Draco’s side. The two women were getting along smashingly; it pleased both Harry and Draco to no end. Sometimes they discussed It and possible names, and sometimes they discussed the future renewal of vows.
Harry started to push in, slowly, and wrapped his hands around Draco’s belly.
Harry just nodded.
“He came home yesterday afternoon and said he was leaving for a property. He didn’t say which, just packed two bags and apparated out. What in Merlin’s name is wrong with him? Oh my- Is that Harry Potter? What is wrong with him Blaise?”
Harry grinned at the idea and decided to do just that. He pounced and pinned Draco to the bed, ready to please his husband and please himself. He decided to get a little revenge for the treatment he'd suffered yesterday.
“Harry? Did you hear me?” Draco asked, standing up to look at Harry fully. “What's for dinner?”
The next morning, Harry walked passed one of the sitting rooms, still in his pajamas, and yawned loudly. “Blaise? Are you in the kitchen?” he called out. Five sets of eyes watched him pass the sitting room, one of them in amusement.
“Okay,” he murmured out loud. “I need something old, something new, something borrowed, and something blue. I can get the old from Madam Pomfrey she said. Something new can be the robes. Something borrowed and something blue. I need something borrowed. Something borrowed.” He lay his head back on a soft cushion and thought about it. After several minutes, it finally came to him. “I’ll ask Severus for his boots. They are so comfortable!” With that he set to washing himself with the fluffy loofa sitting near him on a small ledge.
“I trust you, Harry, but I don’t trust him. If he’s taken in, me and Hermione are staying at Grimmauld Place too, to make sure he doesn’t try anything.”
“I can’t do it,” Malfoy says, tears streaming down his face. “I can’t, I’m not…”
He trusts Ron to fill them in, and feels therefore no guilt for calling it a night at five o’clock.
A quarter before ten, he sighs and puts the essay away in his bag, having only written a few lines and corrected one spelling mistake during his impromptu study session. He’ll make Hermione help him, she always does, even if it does come with slightly annoyed muttering.
, who care and want to help you. You did well by reaching out to Remus and Sirius, and now, you need to let go of this, because there’s nothing more you can do.”
Harry almost laughs at that, as if there isn’t someone trying to kill him every year, but holds back his amusement and puts on a serious tone instead to say:
“Have you considered summoning it?”
Draco raises a brow. “Do you want me to?”
“Oh yeah, that’s right,” he says, as if it makes perfect sense. Harry scoffs but smiles nonetheless.
Two weeks later, Lupin informs him that Dumbledore has died. Passed away in his sleep, he tells him, before leaving Draco alone in the library.
No, Malfoy was not a Death Eater, and he was not a killer. He was a boy, just like Harry, caught in a war that is much, much bigger than himself and forced to choose sides lest he be disinherited by his own family.
They answer him back with questions, as well as updates on the general gossip (Blaze) and the reactions of their peers (Pansy), and he knows they are trying to soften the blow, but he can read between the lines. His departure had created a rift in Slytherin house, with half of them supporting him, and half insisting on a new leader.
“Harry, he was about to
“Are you sure that’s a good idea, Harry?” she says then, putting down her book and meeting his gaze.
Some are in languages he can’t read, but those that he can, he reads eagerly, even when the text is as dry as the paper it's written on, because if he doesn’t do something, if he doesn’t keep his hands and brain occupied, he might actually go mad out of boredom.
“I didn’t...I did it for my father, he…” His words die out on his tongue, but Harry can figure out the rest. Lucius Malfoy was imprisoned last summer after being caught in the Department of Mysteries, together with a few other Death Eaters. It was only a matter of time before Malfoy was pushed to take his place.
Hermione lays a hand on his shoulder. “You couldn’t have known.”
“I mean, it’s not like it’s uncommon within pureblood families, surely you know that, Black?” He leans in over the table to meet his cousin's gaze, who's sitting on the other side of Lupin. Black just smirks at him with bemusement.
However, when he’s finally under the covers, wearing his sleeping shirt this time, he’s not able to sleep at all, even with his eyes burning with exhaustion from the day’s events.
“I hate to say it, but I told you so.” Her voice, however, lacks the usual self-assurance, and is instead low and pensive.
He does, however, wake up with a hangover that feels like he’s been sucked dry of all the water in his body. As he gulps down several glasses of water, Ron stirs awake and meets his gaze groggily.
He realises then, that he’s already done it, he trusted him with his biggest secret, and instead of antagonizing him, Potter risked it all to save his life.
Such a silly thing, really, to cry over a forgotten birthday. He hadn’t expected gifts or any celebration, he doubted his prison guards even knew it was his birthday, but still…
Potter sighs then, but that little smile does not leave his face. “Yeah, I know, she’s brilliant.” Then, as if he has realized something: “You didn’t call her a mudblood.”
At that, Sirius and Remus exchange a look, and for a moment, it looks like they’re having a whole conversation, before Sirius sighs in surrender and nods. Remus turns to Harry and says
“I wasn’t really trying,” he mutters, but Harry just looks at him in shock and horror.
It takes him two days to gather up the courage to join Potter and his guardians for dinner, and when he finally makes his way down to the kitchen, he is met with three confused looks, before Lupin pulls aside a chair next to him and motions for him to join.
“I’ll help you with your Defence essay?” he offers, and Draco snorts.
Harry nods again and stuffs his books in his bag before he makes his way towards the hospital wing.
Hermione huffs. “Is it so hard to believe I simply have a high metabolism?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And my mother? I can’t leave her, not with
And Harry does. When he’s finished, Ron is looking at him with confusion and worry.
“Let me see,” he says, motioning for the parchment, and Potter slides it over.
you saved my life by moving me to this safe house, when in fact, you have only extended it. If anything, now I’m even more of a target, because not only am I a traitor, I am also a liability for the Dark Lord’s plans. Who’s to say my dear cousin isn’t going to spill some Virateserum in my morning coffee and make me tell them all I know about the Dark Lord’s plans?”
“Harry? Are you okay?”
“Look, if your father or Voldemort is making you do something, something you don’t want…”
He lets out an exasperated sigh. “I know you’re not here to make small talk, so just say what you want to say already.”

“You’re so young, and there’s so much weight on your shoulders, I can practically see you crouching under it,” she says, her voice tender now, maternal even. Harry just shakes his head, but the tears are burning behind his eyes, and he doesn’t know why, but he just wants to cry, wants to let go and just

this to happen.
“So, could you help me with the essay?” Potter looks like a puppy begging for snacks, and Draco has to hold back a laugh.
“You don’t understand. He’ll kill me.”
Hermione seems to notice his distress, because she flips the newspaper in half and puts a soft hand on his.
He reads through it and sighs. “How is it that a sixth-year does not know how to spell ‘rejuvenating’?”
talk about Remus and Sirius like that, got it?”
He hums as a response, but Potter is not done with him.
He walks in a pattern, trying not to remember it, so that he is not tempted to return the book.  He passes a small hill of broken chairs, and a Vanishing Cabinet, before he reaches a stack of jewellery, and then finally, a mountain of books. He stuffs the book into the pile, and then, for a moment, he regrets it, and tries to pull it out again, but it’s lost. He shakes his head.
His birthday has always been the highlight of the exam week, falling mostly on the last day, and afterwards, the Slytherin common room was brimming with people celebrating him. It seems juvenile to miss those days when a war is brewing on the horizon and he has just betrayed his own family to hide with the enemy, but he can’t help himself.
, Potter is actually not expecting anything from him, and genuinely just saved his life because he
“Just now, you didn’t insult her.”
tie,” he says, before gulping down more water.
His eyes glide mindlessly over the Slytherin table, and he humours himself with the drowsy look on Parkinson’s face, as she nips on her breakfast. Clearly, someone’s been out drinking last night.
“And what can you offer me in return, Potter?”
“Good game. Let’s do it again sometime,” before he runs out of the room and leaps down the stairs towards the kitchen.
bedroom.
He thinks about Malfoy, and Dumbledore, and wonders if the headmaster knows of the attempts to assassinate him. He thinks about his friends, the seemingly permanent looks of worry on their faces when he’s with them.
Maybe all the time he has spent in solitary has affected him, made him softer and more perceptible to Potter’s attempts to indoctrinate him, or whatever it is he is trying to do because he must have an ulterior motive, right?
He doesn’t know how long he lies in the dark, could be minutes, could be hours, but eventually, his mind shuts down in protest, and he falls asleep, his dreams filled with green light, accompanied by a maniacal laugh, then the body of Cedric dropping in front of him on the graveyard, except that when he looks at him, it’s not Cedric, but Malfoy, crying and whispering “Help me.”
“Everything is okay. I just called to tell you that Malfoy’s been moved to the Headquarters.”
They tell him he is allowed to leave whenever he wants, but that is just another lie. Where would he go? Back to the manor, where his mother is hosting a madman who will kill him if he ever sees him again? Or do they think he will take a crack at London and live out his secret dream of living without magic in a filthy city filled with even filthier muggles? Yeah, right.
With a curt nod and a mental note to mull about this interaction later, Harry rushes up the stairs and towards McGonagall’s office. When he’s let in, the witch is sitting behind her desk, pinching the bridge of her nose as if she’s trying to fight off a headache.
at him.
Malfoy meets his gaze again, and while his face is unreadable, his eyes swim with emotion.
He’s faced Death Eaters, been at the receiving end of their curses, and while Malfoy did almost
Ron laughs at that, but it comes out strained, seeing as he’s still lying on his stomach.
“Breakfast?” he asks, as he puts on his shoes, which had been lying between his and Ron’s beds.
is a zefri root?”
Draco had forgotten how much he loves to fly. Because of his mission, he had to quit the team, and he had not competed since fifth year, and even then, it was not the same without Potter, who has always been the only one who could keep up with him.
Hermione takes his hand in her own. “Let’s talk about this later, okay. We’ll be late for class.” Harry follows her absentmindedly out of the classroom and towards their next class.
Draco follows him at a slower pace, as that warm feeling begins to grow in his chest again. It’s odd to have Potter
“Ten o’clock, Saturday. Now clean yourself up and go back to your dorm. And next time, try and think before you use an unknown spell. You’re lucky he’s alive.” Snape sneers, and with a flick of his wand, the stretcher hoovers above ground and follows him out as he leaves.
Harry nods and feels a rogue tear stream down his cheek. He dries it irritably and appreciates his professor for ignoring it.
“I-You-You don’t know what you heard,” he stammers out, but Harry has obviously hit something, so he prods on.
“You’ve done all you can, for now, Harry. And that was more than enough.”
He takes a gulp of water and meets Potter's gaze, who just smirks at him with amusement.
“The food is decent, if a bit spicy for my taste. But compliments to the chef,” Draco says with an air of nonchalance that he has perfected over the years.
“I’ll let you ride my Firebolt?”
They play for hours, and only stop because Kreacher calls them down for dinner. When they land on the wooden floor and put away the brooms, Potter puts a hand on his shoulder and says:
“I don’t-I just wanted to see if you were doing okay,” he says, and Draco’s just about to roll his eyes at the notion that Potter, of all people, would care about
“You alright there, Neville?” Harry asks, not able to hide his amusement, and Neville just nods before curling up in his own bed, still wearing his clothes, but mysteriously only one shoe.
He dares to sneak a glance at the other boy and is almost amused by the boggled look on his face.
Harry is confused for a moment.
At that, Potter’s eyes soften, and no, no,
But maybe, just
The news is met with expected outrage and debate, but Harry is too tired to argue about it, and just pulls aside the alternate Seeker, a fourth-year named Tallulah Jacobs, to quickly discuss strategy with her, before he retreats to his dorm again, followed by the worried gazes of Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Neville, who are all sitting around the fireplace when he leaves.
After that, Draco joins them for every meal, and soon finds out more about Potter and the other two. He finally gets the full story of what happened in third year and how Black had managed to escape from right under Fudge’s nose, how he and Lupin had the idea to renovate the house, how they saved Potter from his muggle relatives the summer after fourth year and went against Dumbledore’s wishes for him, for the son of their best friend.
“The necklace, and the mead, they were both meant for Dumbledore…You’ve been trying to kill him the whole year.”
“I’ve already learned Hindi and we’re planning a trip to New Delhi when I graduate,” Potter proclaims proudly.
“Well, my mother certainly never approved of the relationship,” he says, at which Draco has to huff because come on, obviously that wasn’t the reason.
“Good thing you aren’t a Chaser, Potter, because that was a very sad excuse for a throw.”
Neville is puking loudly into the toilet, with the door open for everyone to hear, while Dean is passed out on top of Seamus on the former's bed, both seemingly half-dressed. Harry smiles and shakes his head at the couple, before making his way towards his own bed, and plopping down on it. Ron mirrors him but is only able to sit up for a moment before he falls back on his mattress with a groan.
A couple of days after that, Potter comes back from Hogwarts. Draco makes himself scarce as the boy talks with his guardians in the kitchen.He can’t face him, because he’s still ashamed, but more than that, he’s furious at him for putting all of this in motion, for attempting to save his life.
So, that night, after he’s made sure that everyone is asleep, he sneaks down to the kitchen and steals a scone from the pantry, before he makes his way to his windowsill and sits watching the lights of the city, and thinks, that in the dark, it almost looks beautiful.
Before Draco can finish, however, Potter rushes towards him and grabs him by his shirt, making the book in his hands drop to the floor with a thud.
you…” Ron argues.
“Go, be with your friends, and try not to worry about it, okay?” the witch says softly, but in a tone that leaves no room for discussion. Harry nods again and is about to leave before he remembers, and turns around to ask:
“Professor McGonagall wishes to see you in her office, Potter.”
“I didn’t do it because I felt guilty or felt I owed you anything. I did it because it was the right thing to do.”
Remus lets out an exasperated sigh. “We’ll see what we can do, but we can’t promise anything, not yet at least.”
“He has to. There’s too much going on right now, Harry, I can’t explain all of it, but we’ll be able to tell you soon. Just worry about school for now, okay?”
Maybe his summer is not going to be as dreadful as he thought.
“I wouldn’t say killing the most powerful wizard in Britain is a ‘simple task’ for anyone, let alone a teenage boy with a chip on his shoulder.”
And how could Draco say no to a challenge?
Draco considers it. He hasn’t been on a broom in over a year, and he knows that the Firebolt is supposed to be leagues better than his own Nimbus 2001.
Anyone else got really into HP during the quarantine or just me? Anyway, this is my first HP fic so don't judge, and also, this is kind of written already in the text, but just for clarity - Sirius is alive and well, since Harry actually used his mirror in fifth year, and Harry is staying with him and Remus over the summers.
Then, he hears footsteps, and he turns to see Snape enter the broken bathroom, and he had never been so happy to see his former Potions professor. Snape’s face is a mask, but his eyes are wide and livid, and he doesn’t hesitate as he kneels next to Harry.
“Take it,” he says, and Malfoy eyes him suspiciously.
, Potter. You only saved me because you felt guilty for almost killing me because you have a hero complex bigger than the Black Lake because you took
He’s just about to vomit every time he remembers it, it’s that revolting. He didn't need his pity, he was doing just fine without it, but no, Harry-The-Boy-With-A-Hero-Complex-Potter just had to swoop in and save him from his miserable fate, didn’t he? Well, he can go and drown in the Black Lake for all he cares, because as far as he is concerned, Harry Potter had ruined his life.
“But you are not Atlas, Harry, you do not need to carry all the troubles of the world on your back. You’re surrounded by people who care for you,
Draco looks at him in disbelief, because how can he ask him that? After everything they’ve been through, after six years of animosity and rivalry, how can he ask him to trust him?
Malfoy nods, then shakes his head. “Where would I even go?”
“Wake up, please,
, he couldn’t do it. It would have been so easy, to just take out his wand and kill the old man, but instead, he just sat there, like a disobedient schoolboy waiting for his verdict after being caught red-handed.
“You were complete prats, but it was very entertaining,” Ginny comments from her seat next to Hermione, making Ron stick his tongue out at her. She returns it with a grimace, before turning back to her untouched eggs.
Hermione and Ron share a look then. “Yeah, among other things. You were very talkative last night.”
“Can’t blame him,” Ron says from where he’s lying. “He tried to out-drink Hermione. It’s always the smart one’s that party the hardest.”
that, saved his life.
But, of course, Malfoy is too proud to apologize or thank him, which Harry can’t blame him for. They’ve been enemies for years, and this sudden act changed their whole dynamic. Could he even call Malfoy his enemy now that he was actively helping him? He puts the thought aside to mull over it for later.
Ron smirks, and Harry knows he can see right through him. “Try me.”
McGonagall lets him speak, sitting perfectly still in her chair like her animagus form, her eyes intense and watchful.

, because he doesn’t need his concern, he doesn’t need
“This bloody Potions essay is doing my head in. What the
“What?”
A few days after that first dinner, he decides to tell them so.
No one just does things for people without expecting anything in return, that is what he has been taught from birth. That everything comes at a cost.
Malfoy is sitting up in the bed and reading a book that Harry can’t make the title out of, but it looks French. Harry clears his throat then, and Malfoy looks up to meet his gaze with his pale blue eyes. They’re bloodshot and tired, but are filled with the usual malice that’s only reserved for him.
Harry realizes that he should have brought something, as some kind of peace offering, and searches his bag for a last moment proxy, until he finds a chocolate frog, which he holds in his hand as he opens the blinds slowly.
, he was breaking down, he couldn’t do what he was sent to do, he told me as much himself!” Harry rises then, placing both his hands on the table, and looms over his professor.
“Wait, so does that mean you can’t play quidditch on Saturday?” Ron asks, which earns him a smack on the arm from Hermione, and a somber nod from Harry.
Harry quirks an unimpressed brow at her, as he takes a sip of his coffee.
“We’re not
His words sink in, and it dawns on Harry that he had never sounded that...
Up until this point, Draco had been eating his meals alone, however, now that Potter’s here, and he has made a promise to trust him, he decides to begin eating his meals with the others, as a way to uphold his end of the deal.
When he’s done, he dries his face with the back of his hand and sighs, before returning to the book as if nothing has happened.
“Did we win the match, professor?”
for him, as if he
At that, the blond’s eyes widen, and the little colour that was on his cheeks disappears.
“We just thought-”
“We have to talk this over with Dumbledore before we make any promises, and he’ll have to be interrogated…”
Harry can accept those conditions. It’s not perfect, but it is something. A part of his mind, the part that suspiciously sounds like Tom Riddle, tries to make him question his haste decision to save Malfoy, but then another voice, a louder voice, and sounds like Dumbledore, tells him that everyone deserves a chance at redemption, even the enemy.
Harry nods absentmindedly.
“I’m sure he’s fine. Besides, didn’t McGonagall tell you to leave it to the adults?”
Draco rolls his eyes at his surprised voice. He can be nice, if he wants to, there’s no need to make a big deal of it. The conversation continues, and Draco tries his best to take part and be civilized, and it’s worth it, if only to see the boggled looks on their faces.
with a flick of his wand. For a moment, nothing happens, but then they hear voices downstairs, and soon enough, Neville’s left shoe is flying up the stairs and right into the back of Neville’s head, before promptly falling on the floor with a thud.
A fifth-year he doesn’t remember the name of notices him and announces to the room: “Harry is back!” at which a loud cheer erupts, and before he knows it, he is swallowed by the crowd and hoisted up by his quidditch teammates, who have seemingly forgiven him for getting detention or have had enough to drink to forget it, as they are chanting his name.
“As if you care about a runaway Death Eater, as if you care about
He’s so furious, the book is shaking in his hands, but he feels like a weight has lifted off his chest, so he continues:
And then...and then he thinks about Potter, and that stupid look on his face when he witnessed Draco’s breakdown in the hospital wing, as if he actually felt
If he wants to stay alive, he has to put his trust in Potter.
“Is it about Malfoy?” he asks, perspective as ever, which Harry realises, he doesn’t get enough credit for. He had matured a lot since the attack on his father last Christmas, become more observant of other people and their emotions.
Malfoy shakes his head. “No, I-I can’t.”
“Are you okay?” And what a stupid question that is. Draco finally meets his gaze over the top of the book, and hopes that it conveys all the fury he is currently trying to prevent from coming out through a hex.
He wants to say no, to tell him to piss off and do his own homework, but then he remembers that he’s supposed to be civil, that he wants to prove to Potter that he’s more than a pitiful Death Eater, and he resolves to help him.
Potter seems defeated, but only for a second, then he brightens up again.
have a chip on my shoulder! And it should have been simple, if I had only just pulled myself together, found the right angle, but I couldn’t - I can’t - I’m not-”
Draco doesn’t even dignify that with a verbal response, and just huffs as his eyes glide back to the text. Potter still can’t take a hint.
He returns to his text, something about dark artefacts and immortality, but he can’t focus on it. The book is shaking in his hands, and before he knows it, he’s sobbing. He lets himself cry, because he’s alone and there’s a slim chance anyone can hear him.
“But you’ll do it?” Harry egged on.
“No. Like it or not, you’re under the Order’s protection now, and despite what you might think, no one in this house is out to get you, least of all me.”
“Deal.”
Potter holds his gaze for a moment before lowering his wand and letting go. He doesn’t move away, however, and stands looming over Draco as he says,
But then he sees the sincerity in his eyes, and against his better judgement, he finds himself believing it.
As he makes his way back, he realizes that with the book gone, he can say goodbye to his good grades in Potions, but in hindsight, grades seemed so meaningless compared to the repercussions of a spell like that falling into the wrong hands. Or even in the right hands, it’s still dangerous.
Hermione simply shrugs and attempts to hide her smirk behind her newspaper.
And then he looks at the small calendar that he had requested for his room, and realises that it’s his birthday, and all of the sudden, he’s just about to cry.
Harry swallows his protest and nods, but seeing him squirm, makes the elder witch soften.
Inevitably it was a suicide mission from the beginning because he could never do it, and the Dark Lord knew that, he knew that Draco would either die trying or fail, at which he would kill him himself, if only to punish his father.
Draco attempts to focus on his book. It's a light read of five hundred pages on healing magic, which he had been practising in secret since last summer, in case he should ever need it, but the frustrated grunts coming from Potter keep distracting him. He’s just about to hex him into silence when the boy says:
His first instinct is to take out the map, but he had left that in the dorm. Then, an impulsive thought occurs, and he’s about to go over and ask Zabini himself where Malfoy is, because he’s not here,
Something passes over Black’s face, and the next moment he’s barking with laughter. Lupin joins him with a silent laugh that he’s trying to hide behind his hand, and Potter simply stares at Draco with a bemused grin.
“Harry, what’s wrong?” His voice is quiet now, worried.
Draco makes his way towards the table and sits across from Potter, tucking his feet under the chair.
Potter just looks confused, and Draco feels like he’s talking to a toddler, not a sixteen-year-old that has supposedly faced the dark arts more than once. If this is their Savior, they’re most certainly doomed.
It would be so easy to throw a wordless hex on his legs then and make a break for it, but something in Potter’s gaze keeps him frozen in his place.
The wing is empty, except for Madam Pomfrey and a single occupied bed that has the mint green blinds closed around it. Harry meets her gaze, and she nods over to the closed-off bed, with a worried wrinkle between her brows.
He thinks of Snape then, of the man who used to be a Death Eater and a spy, who has bullied him for six years, and yet still jumped between him and a werewolf when he was thirteen, kept down the fort when Dumbledore was banished last year, rebelled against Umbridge in his own way, by seeing through fingers when he saw DA members sneaking around.
At this she meets his gaze and holds it as she says:
“One would think a sixth year would know better than to use a spell he’s found in an old textbook, but alas, I always seem to underestimate your stupidity, Potter,” Snape says, looking down on him.
Ron enters the empty dorm to find Harry lying in his bed, fully clothed and staring at the ceiling.
“He will be able to take them here, with me as the examinator,” he says calmly, and Harry nods in response.
(See the end of the chapter for
Something mischievous flashes across Potters features and he says:
The room is at least twice as small as the one he has -
“It was you,” he breathes out, and Malfoy meets his gaze with a somber look.
He didn’t even know Slytherins went to parties hosted by the other houses, but it made sense, since all the students migrated between the common rooms for this or that. In a way, it was kind of a nice thought, that a party, of all things, was able to erase house prejudices.
“He might as well because that’s what they’re going to believe. That I betrayed my own, that I was too weak to handle a simple task, and that I am a spy and a disgrace to the Malfoy family name. Do you understand now?”
“Malfoy’s missing,” he simply says.
to, because it was ‘the right thing to do’.
It was a lot like being with Blaise or Pansy, and surprisingly enough, Potter could even keep up with his dry humour.
“Yes, please!” Ron exclaims and abandons his bed in favour of food.
in the house.” Harry knows he means Voldemort, and for a moment, he’s terrified for Narcissa Malfoy, but he pushes the thought aside and focuses on the boy in front of him instead.
him, Harry remembered the look on his face as he did - anger masking regret, a resentful scowl and tears streaming down his cheeks, the desperation sipping through his voice.
“Sirius would never do that-”
I have so much fun writing in Draco's POV, he's such a pretentious prick lol. But also, he needs therapy.
The boy considers it for a moment. What does he have to offer Draco? Not much, to be honest, definitely nothing within the limits of their current situation.
Also sorry for the vague summary, I suck at those, and I'll probably change it later.
“I know what you did for Mr. Malfoy, and that, Harry, took a lot of courage and generosity, considering your shared past. He’s with the headmaster as we speak, and while I cannot promise anything, I do know that Albus sees the best in people, and that no student, no matter their status or house, should be forced to join an army at such a young age, let alone a dark one.”
“Even when I try, trouble always seems to find me.” It has become a kind of an inside joke between them, and they share a knowing smile, before Remus fades out and Harry is alone once again.
He hates hearing it, but he accepts it, if bitterly. In truth, it had been a huge strain to take on Malfoy’s case, on top of all the other things he had to worry about. He’s lucky, really, that the adults around him are competent enough to take some of the load off, but still. Sometimes, he truly feels like he’s carrying it all on his shoulders, and it doesn’t help that he’s still plagued by nightmares from the events of two years ago, and that now they’re joined by the incident in the bathroom.
But Potter, that bloody Gryffindor, doesn’t waver, and instead meets his gaze with a concerned look, which Draco
…” He tries to feel for a pulse, but his own is too rapid to make out Malfoy’s. Hot tears stream down his face before he can stop them.
His throat feels dry and he gulps down a glass of water from his nightstand. Ron is snoring peacefully in his bed, drooling on his own pillow, and Harry smiles fondly at his best friend, before he remembers his dream, and out of pure paranoia, he reaches for the Marauder Map and locates the Slytherin common room.
“But guess what? I didn’t need your help, and I most certainly do not need your pity. Thanks to you, my life is ruined. Thanks to you, I’m stuck in an old dusty house with two degenerates as my prison guards, and -”
- back at the manor, and he bites back a comment as he’s led into it by his former Defence professor. He doesn’t comment on the state of the man’s clothes either, nor his shoes, or the house that they're currently in, even if all three look haggard and antiquated.
“Have you considered that maybe it had more to do with him being a werewolf than a man? Just a thought.”
“Hey, look at me,” Potter says, and Draco has to will himself to look up, only to find Potter looking at him with an unwavering resolution.
“Oh, so you know the meaning of ‘unexpected’ but you can’t spell ‘rejuvenating’?” Draco says dryly, but can’t hide the smirk on his lips. Potter blushes, which is odd, and then throws a piece of crumpled paper towards him, which Draco catches with one hand.
Then he remembers that everyone is down in the Great Hall for dinner, and almost sighs with relief. As soon as he enters the common room, he makes a b-line for the dorms. When he gets to his bed he draws the curtains and locks them in place, before taking out his potion’s book.
“There's no 'd' before the 'j', and it's with an 'e' after the 'v', not an 'i'. You wrote it ‘redjuvinating’”
“One of these days, you have to teach me that charm,” Harry says as he sits down across from her. She meets his gaze above the newspaper, smiling innocently.
“Malfoy?” Hermione asks from where she’s sitting next to him. Harry nods.
“Harry, are you sure he’s not tricking you? What if it’s a part of his plan, what if he was sent to kill
“Do you promise to trust me?”
The next day, Potter finds him in the library again, but this time, he simply sits by the table and takes out his homework to, presumably, do it.
He’s out of bed in a flash and digging through his suitcase before he finds the potions textbook. He knows what to do with it.
“You can insult me all you want,” Potter says, voice quiet but none the more serious, “but don’t
“I’ve already done it. And mind you, my marks are just as good as yours in that subject.”
And that has to be good enough because that's all either of them can give right now, a promise to protect and to trust, because if they can’t do that when caught in a war against a madman, what else is there left for them to do?
On the days that he can’t find anything to do, and he’s too exhausted to read, he sits on a windowsill in the library and stares out on the street. There’s a park right across from the house, and he watches the couples and families walk around as his thoughts whirl around in his head.
Yet he finds himself moved by the notion, by a simple promise made by a boy, a boy he’s supposed to hate, a boy that
thing?”
His tone is oddly lacking any contempt, and Harry turns to look at him, but as always, his face is unreadable, and his eyes even more so, even if he does see a quick flash of something behind the facade.
However, an eye for an eye, he’s not gonna do it for free, he’s a Slytherin after all, he has to keep his principles.
Harry knows only two people who could help them. “I have an idea. I’ll need to clear it with them, and I can’t promise anything, but…”
Snape traces his wand over Malfoy, chanting a spell, and soon enough the wounds close, and a little colour returns to Malfoy’s cheeks, but he’s still unconscious.
“Fine,” he snarls, curling his lip in disdain.
Draco huffs. “If you’d read the book, you’d know that it’s the root of the zefri plant and that it’s found in tropical environments. It is also a key ingredient in any healing potion.”
“You know why,” he says, and then tugs up the sleeve on his left arm to reveal the Death Mark, tattooed in ink-black on his ivory skin.
Ron scoffs at this, but Hermione sighs and puts down her paper.
He ends up falling asleep, and his dreams are haunted by a boy with green eyes.
“Shut up.”
As he walks, he tries to think of an excuse, something that can explain where he’s been without telling the truth, but his mind is blank, except for the image of Malfoy bleeding out on the tiles.
“You sound just like Hermione.”
He thinks about his friends and how they’re handling the Slytherin civil war, he wonders if they miss him, even though they keep reassuring him of that in every letter. He thinks about his mother, alone in a house with the Dark Lord and his pet snake, with only his delusional aunt as company, and wonders if she resents him, if she’s angry at him.
The words flow out of him before he can stop them and he looks up to meet Potter’s surprised gaze. He can practically see the gears turn in his head before an idea lights up his face.
“No, no, no…” Harry mutters, panic sipping through his voice, as he desperately tries to stop the bleeding with his hands. He only ends up getting covered in more blood, and then he sees Malfoy’s eyes glaze over, and he takes his face with his bloodied hands and tries to wake him.
When he rises again, shoe in one hand and wand in the other, he meets Harry’s gaze, and they both erupt in giggles that soon turn to laughter, and in that moment, Harry thinks to himself that maybe everything is going to be alright after all.
If you're interested in beta-ing, I'd appreciate the help, especially if you're familiar with British slang and culture, as I'd like to incorporate as much of it as possible. That being said, the next chapter is probably my favourite, and I can't wait for you to read it :)
Mountains and mountains of stuff make up a deep labyrinth inside the room, but he does not have time to explore the wonders of all the things that have been hidden away by the previous generations of students.
Breakfast goes by without any major events, but while Harry tries to follow along in the conversation, his gaze keeps slipping back to the Slytherin table now and again, and each time, he feels more and more nervous. Malfoy never shows up.
He doesn’t say any of this to Ron, though, thinking that it’s a discussion for another time, and instead, they make their way down to the common room to announce to the quidditch team that Harry will not be playing tomorrow.
Harry shakes his head. “Maybe so, but what I did was worse, much worse…”
“I deserve it.”
Afterwards, they go back to the common room to sober up, and Harry enters the dorm just in time to hear his name being called from the drawer on his nightstand. Quickly, he takes out the mirror, and Remus’s face comes into view.
Malfoy’s name is written black on white in the sixth year boy’s dorm, and Harry feels a weight lift off his shoulders. Of course, Malfoy is not dead, he’s alive and well, sleeping peacefully in his bed.
Harry wakes up in cold sweat, gasping for air, and feels locked inside the curtains, so he pushes them aside with so much force they almost fall off. The sun is rising above the treeline of the Forbidden Forest, and after a few deep breaths, he’s able to breathe normally again.
“Right there,” Blaise said, pointing as Harry ran toward it. Immediately the sounds of retching were heard. Blaise set the bags down and followed his fri-
“Fine. Let the wand decide.” He and Harry got out of bed and kneeled down on the floor beside it. Draco set Harry’s wand on the floor and gave it a spin from the middle. Just as it started to slow down, their door opened.
Their assignment sat in front of them in two places: the instructions were written on the blackboard at the front of the room, and the cage with rabbits in it sat in front of them on their desks. They were to turn the family into a complete tea set with little spoons and everything. It was hard to turn a family of seven rabbits into a tea set that had more than twenty pieces to it. And there were extra points if you could get a good cup of hot Earl Grey tea in the pot and one of the cups. Milk and sugar weren’t extra, however, because that was part of the tea set.
“Dennis? What was his bet?” Ron asked. “And what was yours for that matter?”
“Yes,” Pomfrey replied. “But he is reacting differently. Mr. Potter-Malfoy even removed it in a different fashion from your experience. It seemed Severus’ Mark was more deeply ingrained. He seemed to have a more troublesome time removing it, and then left the infirmary quickly despite my protests. Our question for you is if this has something to do with something else entirely.”
That same parchment showed new writing on it, the same words Dumbledore had just spoken.
he signed slowly, well aware that Draco wasn’t following along as closely or thinking as quickly as normal.
“Yes, Miss Theresa, ma’am.” She blinked out of the room. Theresa turned away from Harry for a moment and conjured a sturdy table and then a smaller table to place McKay once she could hold him. When Kipper came back, she simply gestured toward the table. “Here is the water, Miss Theresa. And the towels too, Miss Theresa.”
“I love you too, Harry. And you have nothing to be sorry about. Madam Pomfrey gave me many pamphlets and books on what symptoms to expect during each month of pregnancy. I must admit, I am not going to enjoy the last two months. She suggested you read over all of these as well so you know what to expect. I believe everyone will want to fuss over you first. And, depending on the time, I believe Granger and Weasley should be arriving any–”
“Very, very slowly,” Draco said with an exasperated roll of his eyes. “We worked on the most needed words first. He’d make a sign over and over until I guessed correctly what he meant. Eventually we realized that writing in the air or conjuring a paper and pen were easier than that. His sign for me, other than pointing at me, is to slick his hair back.” Harry demonstrated as Draco explained. “For Professor Snape, he points to his nose. Harry assures me that this is because of your talent at potions and nothing else.” There were a few titters from the crowd at that. "Headmaster Dumbledore’s sign is to stroke his beard. Please is a rotating fist on his chest. Hungry is eating a sandwich. Thirsty is drinking a glass of water. Sleepy is placing both hands under one side of his head with palms together.
“An annulment has nothing to do with the length of time that you’ve been married, Harry,” Blaise began.
“Before I was Mr. Zabini, Blaise’s husband, who was I?”
Dr. Morris sighed. “Theresa Rhodes was hired as a live-in medi-witch for Harry. There. Okay, let the questions begin. Harry, how many men have you had sexual relations with?”
Draco came and went throughout the two months, and they shopped together in Diagon Alley for their seventh year school supplies. And then, once school started, it was much like the second part of their sixth year. Classes were held and homework was done… sometimes. Gryffindor won the House and Quidditch Cups. But the day before graduation, Draco walked out of Harry’s life. All because of a misunderstanding. Knowing how important everything that was going on was, Blaise stepped up. He comforted Harry and got him through the night. When they couldn’t find Draco the next day at graduation, he kept the Gryffindor calm once more.
“Because I was asked. Because it will be a challenge. I was told that I am not to tell anyone anything about what goes on in this house, or any other that concerns you. Simply because you are Harry Potter this is a high priority case. My care will be silent, but the best.”
..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l.. ..l..
Harry’s eyes remained wide for a moment before tears began to appear. He blinked once and lay his head on the bed before him, silently crying now. “He really did leave me,” he moaned. Blaise hurried to the other side of the bed and wrapped his arms around the Gryffindor in comfort. Eventually, he had some of their dinner brought to them via house elf. They ate in silence that night before Harry drifted off into another fitful sleep.
Still like two kids with stars in our eyes.
“Not right now they’re not,” Theresa said. “Now push or you’ll suffocate your son.” Harry pushed and a loud wail went through the air. “Again, that was just his head.” Harry took a deep breath. “And one more should do it. That’s it! It’s done and over with Harry! Hang on while I get McKay cleaned up.” There was a lot of moving around, lots of crying, and a little bit of noise Harry didn’t quite get. “Here is McKay Draconis Zabini, born December 22 at 4:09am. Say hello to your son Harry.” She handed the wrapped bundle to Harry and then went to cleaning and setting things to rights around her and the area.
doctor Harry, not mine. I simply allow them to live in the house and pay them. I want you to be comfortable with the doctor because they will be around everyday eventually. The time will come when the doctor will stay with us, either here or back at Zabini Manor.”
“Positive mate. Now put your ring on. Draco would be ecstatic if he saw you with it on.”
I do not own Harry Potter, etc. I wish I did, but that belongs to JK Rowling and all her people. Lucky bastards...
Wow. I don’t know what to write here. Oh! I know! Sadly, Sirius is dead. The events of

“He doesn’t need to hold it anymore,” Draco answered. “So long as it’s touching his skin somewhere, he has access to it’s use. Right now, it’s up his sleeve. It really came in handy while we were in the Forbidden Forest.”
! It's time for everyone to go so I can take you to bed and ravish you.”
“He's your best friend!”
“As if that great oaf knows anything about this place. I’m going back to the castle.” He started walking, not bothering to worry about Harry or Hagrid or even Merlin himself.
“We will continue this discussion tomorrow, Potter,” Snape said calmly before walking to the door. He paused. “Goodnight Draco. Sleep well. I will see you tomorrow.”
respect my wishes on this! No writing, no air talking, no legillimancy. They don’t need to know that! Nobody does!”
!” A complicated wand movement, and magically there was a baby in Pomfrey’s arms. She continued to wave her wand about, muttering different charms over both Draco and the baby. “
September first came. Harry was nostalgic over all the students returning, seeing the first years line up to be Sorted, and returning to their common rooms for the year. It was the first time he’d not seen his friends and gone to the Gryffindor common room. Tomorrow, classes would begin. Another school year. Things didn’t stop just because Harry’s life had changed, even though it had changed tremendously. As Snape liked to remind him, the world did
By the end of the class, Hermione had everything but the teacup filled with Earl Grey. She was given eight out of ten extra credit points, and full credit for everything else. Ron had a teapot, milk dish, sugar dish, four teacups, and all the accompanying parts to each of those. Two of the teacups didn’t match, and there was no tea. He was given full credit minus ten points for the two teacups. Neville hadn’t done that badly either. All of his tea set matched, and he even had a bit of tea, though not Earl Grey, in the teapot. His problem was that instead of handles, all the teacups and the teapot had fluffy cotton tails instead of handles. He had fifteen points taken off.
"But I'll be happy to do the rest of your jeans for you," she said. "Maybe I'll even rip a couple more."
“You really need to tidy up in here,” Harry said straightening.
Draco couldn’t find the strength to keep a hold of his wand as it flew out of his grasp.
Less than halfway down the corridor stood Blaise in immaculate robes and his hair carefully combed and parted as always. The expression on his face was bland but he had his wand in hand and that was enough.
Draco hadn't laid claim to Potter yet when it happened – something he'd remedied soon enough at the party. And as much as it made him want to punch something, there was no legitimacy on which to base his anger at Blaise.
Harry sat opposite Ron and Hermione with various aromatic dishes between them, unable to resist the smile that found its way onto his face. He was glad to be back at Hogwarts if only to escape the Dursleys for a few more months. The summer had seemed especially long and he would have contemplated finding his own way to the Burrow had Dumbledore not given him a proper reason for his continued stay there.
They sat wrapped in each other’s arms for most of the ride. Draco instructed the drivers to stop about three hours in and made Harry eat a sandwich from a run-down café. Harry hadn’t wanted to eat anything but he had anyway, Draco didn’t fuss often.
His cock was painfully erect and Draco’s calm strokes were doing nothing to alleviate the sensation.
Nott’s eyes wouldn’t meet his.
Draco who was dressed in a simple pair of trousers and a light shirt did not look amused. His hand gripped Harry’s arm and yanked him away and Harry was so shocked that he let himself be drawn to Malfoy's side with little more than a grunt.
"It's only been three hours and you've had five of those."
“Today, I think. We’ll see him in Hogwarts but…”
Being back gave Dumbledore’s words more significance than ever. Harry’s knowledge of his promise and his decision to forgive him for not revealing it earlier meant nothing if Dumbledore died either way. They would both suffer a loss – Harry of Dumbledore and himself of Harry. He knew enough to predict that he would be the first person to blame.
"Need... sleep," he mumbled into the cold sheets.
A quick trip to the bathroom revealed Draco hadn’t hidden his bath potions away since the last time so Harry got to work on drawing a bath. Even so, he hadn’t learnt how to combine the potions and struggled to take his time. He scrubbed until his skin was raw but drained the tub long before half an hour was up.
“Draco–”
Harry nearly dropped his wand but forced himself to keep it together. Draco could endure this.
Draco nodded once and Druella whisked him away.
“Two or three maybe? I don’t know.”
Just a little further.
He ignored it as best as he could.
Draco ignored his anger.
"No clue. There was no return address."
“I’m sorry.”
“It has to be done?”
Harry swallowed and tried to go back to his food.
“Fred and George would take offence if I took any less precaution.”
"Entering the damned lake," Blaise said gesturing to the water. That it was cold did not take precedence over the fact that it was a large body of water.
She turned as though she could sense his eyes on him but she didn’t look at him.
Draco’s body jerked upwards, eyes already amber and unseeing.
Confusion clouded Draco’s eyes. “What?”
Harry dragged a chair before him and sat in it. At first, Draco frowned at the scissors in his hands then his eyes widened.
He wouldn't know, he'd never tried.
Harry was not as calm as he seemed. Draco was too angry to tell that.
"Nothing," he said and Snape's eyes narrowed in obvious disbelief. "Except Pomfrey's pain-relieving tonics which taste about as good as slime."
Malfoy said and Harry let out a cry of surprise when he found himself dangling upside down in the air.
Draco shoved the uniform his way with a smirk. “Maybe you did, maybe you didn’t. We’ll never know, will we?”
Harry lingered a moment. Cool fingers found their way to the warm skin underneath his jumper. He swallowed and wondered what Alphard would have to do if he had to come and get them again.
Malfoy swallowed. “I’m not here to impel you to do my family’s bidding.”
{HPDM}
After a moment, he cleared his throat and learnt forward slightly.
Afterwards, he remained behind under the pretext of finishing his food – which he had taken an extraordinary amount of time to chew – as Pansy and Blaise headed off to the dungeons.
“I don’t know,” he said. “And the blood isn’t mine.”
"What? I thought you said you heard from William who heard from Hannah who heard from Lavender who heard from Parvati who overheard Crabbe say he saw Malfoy and Zabini snogging."
Warrington lunged for him but Draco was expecting it. He sidestepped the blow but forgot to account for his reduced speed. Warrington caught him on the chest – just inches away from his left shoulder – and slammed him into the wall.
He didn't sound very sorry.
Ginny smiled. Harry was so lost in his disgust for Slytherins that her sudden change in expression confused him.
“But how long has this been going on?”
“I do. But it’s not… It would be so much easier if… I know so little about… you.”
"Alright, alright," Ron said. "Don't rush it, this is a very delicate process by the way."
Fuck. How would he begin to explain this? What was he supposed to say? How could he describe that need he’d felt deep within without sounding like some sort of predator? Or worse, revealing how deep the desire he now knew he felt.
He’d gotten so much better at projection his thoughts.
Harry was about to continue down this line of thought when Draco came to a stop before a large, unadorned door. He turned to Harry who thought he stopped a trace of nervousness in his expression.
The redhead seemed to notice him then and Potter froze eyes wide in shock. But Draco did not get to savour that look because something wrapped around his leg, something soft and slippery, and yanked him down just as he saw a flash of red.
“Oi!” Madam Pince called footsteps coming faster now.
He stood up and walked to his trunk when he was done. The sound of silent whispering set him at ease. He couldn't hear what they were saying because his bed was on the opposite side of the room but that didn’t matter.
Draco swung his fist into the wall and cursed again.
It could have slowed Harry’s descent but Malfoy could have done wandless magic for that. He was particularly skilled at it. His fatigue and oxygen deprivation wouldn’t have made it impossible. Not if he only needed to do it for a split second, which he would have.
“My version of events?"
Several irritated groans were the only answer she received along with a 'get out!' from Theo who'd probably been out till late snogging some Gryffindor or the other. However, she was not a Slytherin for nothing and her steely nerve was one her most damnable traits. She marched right to Draco's bed and threw back the drapes before yanking off the covers.
“What then?” he said padding down the corridor.
“There’s a reason those gates are locked. Now it appears you’ve convinced this young boy that he should engage in unnatural behaviour as well.” Cygnus looked down at Draco with disgust.
Draco raised a brow but she ignored him and left.
“I know,” Draco said. “I want you to promise something else.”
“You never have?” he asked surprised that he was surprised.
Neither did he looked away when he whistled to get the drivers’ attention. He flicked his wrist and the one in the passenger seat pushed a button that rolled up the partition. Draco turned back to Harry and cocked his head to the side.
"Is that what you want to do, talk? Or do you want to interrogate me?" Draco spat turning to face him.
Draco rolled his eyes.
In Ron’s room, he was surprised to find a bed had been prepared for him. He took off his socks and shoes then the scarf, jumper and trousers before sinking into the bed. He let himself drift and when Ron whispered his name hours later, Harry pretended to be asleep.
"Hmm," Draco said looking at the grass beneath his feet.
Only then did he allow his body to betray its exhaustion by slumping against a tree. He slid to the ground with a shallow sigh. He wasn't even that deep in the forest and he was already exhausted.
Sensing that Malfoy was about to leave, Harry stepped away from the door and hid in an alcove a few feet away from Moaning Myrtle's washrooms. He heard footsteps as Malfoy exited the washroom and he began to follow him once more. Instead of taking the stairs down to the dungeons as Harry had expected he would, Malfoy instead took the flight of the steps that would lead him to the seventh floor.
Draco released his hold and Blaise stumbled back, massaging his reddening wrist.
"Yeah," she said silently.
“Why does it feel like that?” he asked tamping down the urge to move closer.
The team grumbled their assent and trundled off the pitch lead by Ginny who Harry promised himself to seek out and apologise to.
It was a long time, more than he knew he would have, and still, he’d said,
“I’m sorry,” Harry said cutting him off.
Draco’s gaze travelled from the apple to his eyes and Harry didn’t miss the fire in them.
He let out a yelp.
"Then why did you let me postpone it?"
“It’s between us.”
“No, Harry. Maybe if you woke up you would see the world as it really is. Why do you think Dumbledore left it to me to tell you this?”
But that sort of information wouldn’t be free.
Harry thought he caught a glint of wetness on his cheek but said nothing. He followed in silence, grasping Lupin’s arm like he had Dumbledore’s a few months ago.
“You mentioned that,” Draco said moving to the window. There was nothing, of course, but the illusion having a window in the dungeons created was very real. “What happens then.”
Ron frowned but nodded once the aroma of cooked food began to call to him.
How was he supposed to know what he felt when he couldn’t rein in his own emotions for ten minutes? It was so easy to think of things as like and dislike when there was a spectrum of emotions between those two and an even bigger spectrum between dislike and hatred.
a relationship.
“I meant… where are you taking me with so much …” He waved his hand about in a vague gesture.
It wasn’t often that he read it before lessons but a little preparation never hurt.
Draco paused, breathing audible. His gaze from Harry’s lips to his eyes. “Why?”
“We can’t face them alone.”
Hermione frowned and shook her head.
Malfoy's regal demeanour as he looked down at Harry garnered an irritated sigh. For a moment Harry thought Malfoy would kiss him again. But he brought his face lower until his nose brushed against Harry’s cheek. Hot breath swirled in Harry's ear and he knew what would happen if this went on.
He rummaged around the cupboards for something to eat and came up with cereal and candy bars.
Malfoy moved further out of the shadows.
If what he and Draco had
From Potter’s frown, it was clear he didn’t understand the relevance of this term. More so it’s relevance in contrast to the term
As much as he was relieved to be on speaking terms once more, all he wanted was to get a little more sleep. He hadn't slept well in ages and he felt like he would pass out of he didn't get enough sleep again.
Harry didn’t think that warranted a response.
Draco’s lip curled at the small smile Potter threw in the headmaster’s direction. A smile the old man had no eyes for.
Draco laughed and undid the
Harry thought of returning to the window but something in him was beginning to fray.
A couple of brocade jackets hang on the rack. The rich material slipped beneath his fingers and gleamed in the light of the room. Harry couldn’t resist the urge to reach out and touch them. Everything about them was elaborate, from the stitching to the cut, the colour…
"Back to the castle," responded Harry. "Move."
“What are you making today?”
Her face had gone red and her breathing had picked up. Harry waited for her to say something else but she just shook her head and sank back into the chair. Harry moved closer to her and lay his head a few inches from hers.
"Save it, Potter." He turned around. "You know where the door is."
"What is it?" asked Hermione following his gaze before quickly looking away.
He’d been wrong to stop thinking Draco was a prat. If he thought less about getting him in bed then he wouldn't look the fool so often. He wouldn’t have this cold unfeelingness directed his way. He’d almost let himself forget what it felt like.
Narcissa nearly dropped her cup of tea. She did not know if it was the lack of fear or the fact that he had become accustomed to The Dark Lord's presence but Lino's face showed no change as he delivered this statement. He merely watched his mistress politely from beneath hooded eyes awaiting her orders.
“Things they don’t mean?” he asked.
"Draco-"
Cherry red hair and an intent gaze. Harry’s eyes widened even more when he spoke in that self-confident but guarded way that he seemed to have about him.
{HPDM}
“Know. Yes, I do. But…”
He slipped them past his bed hangings then recast the
Harry frowned.
“More.”
“I’m sorry, Dobby. I’ve been very busy but I’ll make an effort to drop by the kitchens soon.”
Harry smiled despite himself. “I’ve done my fair share of stirring.”
