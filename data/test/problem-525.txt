Wandering over to the discarded pizza boxes, Draco quickly tidied up the mess and made the bed. Letting out a sigh, he ran a hand through his hair and cast a quick cleaning charm over himself. He really needed to get home, his boss had sent him a ton of messages already.
Mrs Dunn seemed to perk up at the prospect of her pumpkins being returned, a warm smile appearing on her face. “Well come on then you two, inside, a cup of tea! My heroes, such a lovely pair.”
“Are you straight?” she asked, her eyes never moving from Potter’s face for one second, the man’s cheeks pinked slightly, he ducked his head down and cleared his throat. “Err, no.. I’m not.” he stammered, rubbing the back of his neck.
The thing that he was worried about the most was Louisa, how the hell would he be able to talk about what had happened? With Louisa obsessed with the ginger moron it would be nearly impossible to bitch about the Chosen One without getting her back up. When Louisa obsesses over someone she really does. Though this seemed different to Draco, he just couldn’t quite put his finger on it.
“They’re trying to recreate the Deathly Hallows, but in mass. So they can equip all of their followers to be the ultimate masters of death.” Wilson continued, ignoring Harry’s question. Zabini let out a sigh. “You’d think it would be impossible, but they’ve created an exceptionally powerful weapon already, we seized an early copy of it from a wizard that under imperius entered the Ministry of Magic in an attempt to kill the Minister.”
“So I guess I get to watch documentaries on dolphins, pharaohs and what was it? Sad doggies needing rescuing?” Draco said quietly, a smirk appearing on his lips. Draco was barely conscious but he’d heard Harry talking. When he’d asked the Healers, they couldn’t explain it - other than perhaps they’d caught it very quickly.
Harry and Draco stepped inside the vault together, their eyes wandering around the contents. Draco had never seen this vault before in his life. There were hundreds of paintings, scattered around the back wall, units as high as the ceiling ram packed with different artifacts. He stepped towards the first unit, frowning.
Three days later, Draco was following Potter down the streets of Diagon Alley once again. He'd seen him every single day since and he'd followed him every day since too. 'What was he up to?' Draco thought. He watched as Potter pulled out a black cloak and threw it over his shoulders, pulling the hood up. He took note of his surroundings and began to walk down that narrow alleyway once again, this time a lot slower than he'd previously done. Draco knew he couldn't follow Potter, he wasn't sure there would be a way he could hide without being noticed. Sighing, he retreated once again.
It took Draco a long time to get to sleep, unable to push the wild thoughts running through his head to the back of his mind.
The room was silent for a few moments, before Kingsley let out a sigh and shook his head. “Keep an eye out for things that are similar to their past actions, liaise with the Department of Mysteries, share information, go through old cases and Auror Lockwood’s files, triple check. All incoming cases scrutinise for anything relating to the Serpents.” he said, dejected. Harry knew this case was serious, he knew they were at a loss. It was terrifying.
He heard a thunk from behind him, he turned around his eyes resting on Draco who had slid down the door and brought his knees up to his chest, burying his head. Without thinking, Harry ran over and knelt beside Draco, placing a gentle hand on his back. “Are you alright?” he asked cautiously, he knew Draco didn’t like to feel vulnerable, but he hated even more when his vulnerability was shown around others.
“So what kind of stuff do you do at work?” Potter asked, still staring at Draco with interest. It wasn’t as unsettling as it had been previously, but Draco had to wonder what the man had to actually look at. Of course, Draco knew he was attractive but in that I want to murder you, resting bitch face don’t talk to me or I’ll skin you alive kind of way.
“Well you’ve lost your friend now, Ron’s never going to shut up about Quidditch for the rest of the night now.” Potter moaned, running a hand through his unkempt hair. Draco tutted.
Draco snorted and shook his head. “They never last long with Louisa, I’m afraid,” he replied, looking up at Potter. “She’s not one for settling down.” Potter looked at her for a moment then back to Draco, shrugging his shoulders. “When you find your person, you know, y’know?” he said. Draco didn’t know actually, he’d never found his
“Really?” He asked, tightening his hold on Draco’s waist. Draco narrowed his eyes, feeling his cheeks flush. “Yes,” He squeaked, ducking his head down. Harry put his hand under Draco’s chin and tilted his head up towards him, grin still plastered on his face.
Kingsley let out a sigh, rubbing his forehead. “I can’t authorise you to question the suspects, the Unspeakables want to interview them first. However I can let you sit in.” he offered, Lavender was a wild card, feisty and unmovable, he’d been overjoyed when she joined training. The woman fought well during the war, she’d recovered well and she’d even taken in a few war orphans whilst the Ministry found them suitable homes to go to. Lavender was quiet, but strong.
Harry frowned and shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t know offhand but I could check.” He rounded the desk and opened up a green filing cabinet at the back of his side of the office, this particular filing cabinet was only for death related cases. Once he found the file he handed it to Draco, who began to read it.
"Nothing, I just thought you'd be hosting society galas and drinking expensive wine of some sort." Draco rolled his eyes and snorted. "No, Potter. I'm not."
Draco was entirely the opposite, he had a lot of compassion and his love of animals was unparalleled. He’d been hassling Harry for the better part of a year about getting a cat, but every time he’d ask Harry would mention they didn’t spend enough time in their flat - the cat would be lonely.
Harry looked at him, his mouth shaped in a perfect ‘o’. “Uh, well, I spent my entire life fighting dark wizards, I thought maybe I could just be ah - well, Harry,” he said, scratching the side of his head. The other man looked awkward, Draco noted. “But yes, finding out his name seems like a good idea.” A small smile appeared on his lips, it was a little comfort to see, but didn’t cure the uneasy feeling settling in Draco’s stomach.
“Is Weasley a relationship kind of guy?” Draco asked, he knew he shouldn’t get too far into his best friends personal business, but he didn’t want to see her hurt either. He’d never seen Louisa this enamoured with someone so quickly. “Like, does he fuck em and chuck em?” Draco asked.
The obnoxious sound of Draco’s alarm clock beeping woke Harry up from his peaceful sleep. Admittedly the most peaceful sleep he’d had since well, probably the last time he’d slept with Draco beside him. He opened his eyes and squinted at the clock, it was 6:45. That was why Draco was always ready before him he thought. Nobody needed to be up at 6:45. They didn’t start work until 8:30.
Draco knew Potter didn't join the Aurors, actually he wasn't entirely sure what career choice he'd went with. He knew a few students had returned to Hogwarts to complete their exams, he knew that Hermione Granger had been one of them - he'd never returned himself - but he knew that neither Weasley nor Potter had joined her. Sighing, Draco rolled his eyes. He wasn't sure why he cared.
Harry nodded, it was always painful to lose a friend. A pang of guilt and sadness hit him as he thought of Fred, it had taken George a long time to accept that his twin was gone - he’d gone to see a Mind Healer in St Mungo’s for a while, he was doing relatively well now and the Wheezes shop was doing phenomenally. Though every so often, he could see that far away gaze on George’s face, Harry knew Fred would be proud of what his brother had accomplished.
Harry nodded and rubbed the side of his face, taking in a deep breath. “Okay then, let’s check the forest boundary. I doubt there would be any blueprints to that forest, unless there was maybe a cabin in the middle or something.”
“You’re helping.” Draco pointed out, looking a little confused. Harry smiled at him. “Yeah, why not?”
Draco copied his nod, walking off to the right where he sat down on one of the wooden benches along the back wall. Harry sat down beside him and put a comforting hand on Draco’s knee. “Do you know what’s in the vault?” he whispered. Draco shook his head. “No, but knowing my father it will be a load of expensive junk.” he spat, bitterly.
I’m relieved they’re sending the eggs to Charlie, though I expect you’ll need to provide an entire rundown to Hagrid on the dragons, down to the colour of the wings. According to Neville, Hagrid has been talking none stop about your secret mission, I've told you once and I will tell you a thousand more times - Harry, Hagrid is the least reliable source to give information to. I implore you, keep your beak shut.
I’m glad to hear about Pansy though. She might be the snarkiest witch that we know but she’s been a good friend to us both. You know, I wouldn’t be terribly surprised if she and Ginny were to follow us down the aisle before much longer. Now that they’re together I should think that things will move speedily along. Merlin, but she’ll be a bridezilla and no mistake! She was forceful enough when you and I got married. All that fuss over the right colour for our robes. I still can’t tell the difference between Egyptian white and ivory. No doubt that her and Ginny’s ceremony will be the wedding of the wizarding year.
“Hello, I’m Auror Potter, this is my partner Auror Malfoy - we’re here about your missing pumpkins.” Harry recited, as politely as he possibly could. Draco smiled and nodded to the lady, who was eyeing Draco suspiciously. “Malfoy you say?” she looked thoughtful for a moment, then nodded her head. “Come in, would you like tea?” she offered, gesturing towards the worn green couch that stood proudly in front of her fireplace.
You’ll have to excuse my handwriting and the shoddy state of the parchment. I’m having to use what I can get my hands on at the moment. Hermione was absolutely correct: this mission could go on for several more weeks. Slowly, but surely, we’re closing in on our targets. They’re a dragon egg smuggling ring and even I think they’re a very nasty bunch of characters. We’re having to be very careful: Polyjuicing our features so that we can move amongst them and gradually gain their trust.
“I think that yourself, Auror Malfoy, Finnigan and Thomas should be the only Auror’s working this case.” Harry frowned. Endelton, Henderson and Brown were important parts of his team, but he couldn’t disagree that the spy may be within his department. Dean and Seamus were inherently trustworthy and would stick by his side no matter what. Kingsley had been skeptical when Harry first told him Draco would be his deputy, but the sheer volume and quality of his work spoke more than his past.
Nodding, Draco turned his head towards Louisa again. It was always a safe bet to turn his attention to her. Not that she was really paying any notice but he felt some comfort from his best friend, like it was a safe space. It was really unexplainable. “Yes, it’s called Blue Waves in London,” Draco said, he began to pick at the skin on his thumb, a nervous tick that he’d developed during the war. “I learnt to drive, I have a Mercedes.” he said, the skin around his thumb always red and painful, it didn’t really stop him from doing it though.
After they’d finished watching the movie, they went on to watch a documentary about camels, which was in itself the weirdest experience of Draco’s life. He’d not watched many documentaries, nor did he really know much about camels. It was at least something to talk to Louisa about.
I have to admit, the image of you pissing in Trish’s tea made me laugh ‘till tears were rolling down my face. I had to stop reading, you absolute swine. My ribs were already aching from the spells I’d caught on the field and laughing made them worse! Trish’s breath isn’t the freshest, I’ll admit that much (not quite dissecting-Flobberworm-entrails-during-Potions-lessons bad anyway!) but she is a fine enough Healer. You absolutely do not have my permission to be adding any wee to her tea. That includes Orion’s, your own or any other that you might have acquired in your travels! I’m entirely serious Draco. I’m giving you my most severe Auror face right now!
“I told Ron that we were coming here today, I hope he notices I never came back.” He said, shaking his head in dismay. Draco let out a sigh. “I didn’t tell anyone, I don’t really talk to anyone except you.”
“No, darling, Draco here likes cock.” Louisa grinned. Draco cringed, he hadn’t known her to be so crass, she must really fancy the oaf in front of him. ‘Get some taste, darling.’ Draco thought, rolling his eyes again. Weasley’s cheeks went beet red, he nodded his head quickly and cleared his throat. “Right, so does Harry.” he said, making an enthusiastic hand movement towards Potter, who looked less than amused.
“Right, I’ll play eye spy with you then,” Potter said, looking around the darkened room quickly, he looked deep in thought, before he turned his head to Draco. “I spy with my little eye, something beginning with L.” Potter said, staring up at Draco with an intensity that made his skin prickle.
I’m allowed to melodramatic, you cheeky, lovely man! You’re pregnant, glorious and I haven’t seen you in far too many weeks. That’s very soon to be rectified, though! Our mission here is France is officially over. My bags are packed and the paperwork is pretty much completed.
Harry entered the break room and frowned. Draco moved towards the refrigerator and opened it, peering inside. “What was that all about?” he asked curiously, watching Draco’s features for any tell tale signs. “Oh nothing, nothing important anyway.” Draco shrugged. He pulled out a sandwich and frowned, shrugging his shoulders.
“So, where’s this warehouse then?” Potter asked, he appeared to be oblivious to Draco’s discomfort, so he decided to put the thought out of his mind and focus on the task at hand, after all that was why they met up in the first place. They’d only been meeting up for a little over a week and Draco could already feel the obsession he’d buried deep inside him ready to burst to the surface.
"Alright Malfoy?" Came a voice from beside him, Draco spun around and fixed Potter with a scowl. “What have I told you about heart attacks, Potter?” Draco spat, brushing down his suit jacket. He’d opted for a regular charcoal suit today; he’d given up on robes quite a while ago. Not for any other reason than societal norms making absolutely no impact on Draco these days.
“Is,” Draco began, looking up at the green eyed man beside him. Biting his lip, Draco felt a blush creep onto his face, he felt irritation rising, unable to place just
“Yes well, semantics.” Draco declared, shaking his hand in a circular motion. “Put your bloody clothes back on you heathen.” he shook his head, trying to sound as put out as he possibly could. Harry just laughed and unbuckled his belt, tossing it onto the sofa.
The only thing that didn’t add up is the murder. It was nowhere near North Yorkshire, they’d found the warehouse on the outskirts of Darlington, the second crop circle that had appeared was in a field not four miles away from the original. It was almost like this group were taunting them. He wondered what they wanted, what their end goal was. It seemed like a potions smuggling operation but he was sure there was more to it than that.
I absolutely loathe Trish, why is she our regular Healer? I swear I heard her whisper under her breath about me, I gave her a death glare but she looked as smug as I do. I want permission to put Orion’s piss in her tea, Harry. Please give me permission or I may end up pissing in it myself. You need to come back soon before I lose my mind entirely and end up cock out pissing in a Healer’s tea.
Draco moved away from Harry and towards Seamus, spotting a figure in the corner of his eye Draco pointed his wand to the third hooded figure, who began screaming “LEAVE, NOW.” in a thick Irish accent. The hooded figure duelling Seamus immediately disapparated, furious, Seamus swung round to the man Harry was currently duelling, who with a sadistic smirk also disapparated. Draco, caught unawares was hit by a stupefy propelling him through the air and down onto the forest floor with a thud. Harry’s eyes widened, the third figure quickly disapparated. Seamus immediately began setting up traces and Harry ran to Draco’s side. Groaning, Draco stood up slowly and gave a sheepish smile to Harry. “Caught me off guard.” he winced, he quickly cast episkey on his finger which was bent the wrong way and he groaned as the hot feeling enveloped his finger, before snapping back into place.
“He’ll be out there somewhere,” Molly reassured him, and he didn’t want to ask how she knew what he was thinking about. Obviously he wasn’t doing a great job of hiding his feelings. She drew him into a conversation about baking and Sunday lunch, and Draco soon found himself agreeing to help her bake cookies for an orphanage at Christmas time. Draco had never baked in his life.
If someone inquired about the number of bathrooms in his house one more time, he was certain he’d go insane.
Draco should have anticipated that becoming friends with Harry would present far more problems than it solved.
His mother had developed a sudden interest in the history of the silk trade after taking muggle history classes in France, and Draco had purchased an old Japanese book that had been written a few years before the beginning of the second Muggle world war. It was just his luck that the little antique shop above Fortescue’s was the only shop that didn’t allow you to receive items via owl.
The cafe was tucked away between a stationery shop and a broom servicing store. It was decked out for Christmas and Draco had never seen so many tiny christmas trees in one place. Everything was covered in a fine layer of red and green glitter and Draco could already tell he was never going to get his new jumper clean again.
As he looked through the notebook, he began to realise that it was, in fact, a diary. Each photograph and written entry was carefully dated, and the bits of paper seemed to be from significant points in Harry’s life. One was his A-Level results, another a letter from someone called Sirius, and several were Christmas cards with long, heartfelt messages inside them.
“Professor,” Draco greeted her with a polite nod and a tight smile, resisting the urge to grimace as heads turned at the sound of his name. She laughed, patting his shoulder and grinning at him fondly. He could smell Firewhisky and Butterbeer and he had a sneaking suspicion that she was very,
Draco must have inhaled some of the fumes from his latest potion. There was no other explanation for Longbottom insisting that they should be on first-name terms.
The child - Jess or Jackie, he couldn’t remember - nodded and frowned, deep in thought. “Maybe that’s what I’ll do when I grow up. Invent the table potion.” She stood up and hurried across the grass to another blanket, waving goodbye to Draco and immediately engaging in a very intense conversation with her friends, presumably to inform them of her future plans and the benefits of a ‘table potion’. “
As Draco pushed the door open—the sweet, familiar scent of the cafe washing over him—a man shoved past him and ran from the shop, hitting Draco with his bag as he turned out of the door with no hint of apology.
Despite McGonagall’s best efforts, she had been unable to return him to his normal state because the spell had been so inexpertly cast and hadn’t responded to the usual reversal spells. She’d eventually made the decision to wait until the spell wore off itself, which she guessed would take anywhere from five days to a month.
He had been trying to catch up on the work he’d missed in the three weeks he’d spent in France looking after his mother, who’d fallen down the stairs in her home. Hermione had been a great help at first, but for the past few days, she’d been stuck fending questions about baby names and her due date from her mother-in-law, and hadn’t had the time to shove her notes down his throat. On top of worrying about his mother’s health and trying to study nearly a month’s worth of work alone, someone had spilt their coffee all over him and his laptop on the train and he’d lost half of his files. He’d carried more books back and forth from the library in the past four days than he had in his last three years at university.
too long, too caught up in the case of two small children and the development of the potion to realise how close the date of the camp’s departure was.
Their conversations slowly became less stilted and they ventured away from safe topics like books and the weather. Harry talked at length about his job and the dueling techniques he’d learnt since Hogwarts, and Draco could tell from the passion and affection in his voice just how much he adored his job and the children he worked with.
He glanced in the mirror as he made his way to the door, wiping a spot of dirt off his cheek and patting his hair down in a feeble attempt to make it look a bit less like he’d lost a fight in Snape’s potions cupboard.
He frowned, playing with the corner of the page. Technically, Harry didn’t have to know. Draco could read this entry, close the book and hand it over to the staff without him being any the wiser. In reality, Draco knew he was far too curious to just stop reading. He was already itching to go back to the start of the diary and read from the beginning, to find out how and why Harry had started mooning over a man he’d never met.
He was itchy, sweaty and he had vastly underestimated his ability to keep his cool when Harry - because it was
“Hello, Luna,” Draco replied blearily, already trying to think up an excuse to get out of whatever crazy activity she had planned for the children today. He wouldn’t use any of them, but it was nice to imagine that he had any sort of willpower when it came to refusing Luna. “What brings you here?”
They were just two months away from NEWT exams and the teachers seemed to have decided that they needed to spend every waking moment writing essays or poring over textbooks. He’d barely had a moment to himself to breathe.
“You lasted longer than most people. The kids are used to duels that last a minute or two and Harry winning with ease, not by chance. They look up to you. Nothing cooler than someone who almost won a duel against
It wasn’t the romantic, fairytale ending Draco had dreamed about. They didn’t stare endlessly into each other’s eyes, hands clasped together as they confessed their undying love under the stars. It was shy, awkward and ridiculously endearing, but it was
The knocking was louder this time, and more insistent. He supposed it was too much to hope that someone who had gone to the trouble of climbing up a hill to his front door would just give up after a few knocks. With a heavy sigh and a great deal of annoyance, Draco threw his cloth down and extinguished the flame underneath the potion. He’d give the lady a discount and hope he didn’t lose her business over the delay, he decided, vanishing the potion that was rapidly turning a dark shade of purple and checking that the batch of Wolfsbane in the corner of the lab wouldn’t bubble over if he left it unattended.
Draco adjusted his robes for what must have been the millionth time and smoothed his hair down. He had no idea why he was so fussy about his appearance all of a sudden. Being a potions master wasn’t the most glamorous of jobs and it had been a long time since he’d made a decent attempt to look presentable, much to his mother’s horror.
Luna had owled him a few times, to let him know that her blue-haired vine plants were growing at a rather alarming rate and that she had noticed Harry seemed to have a lot of Nargles buzzing around him recently. He had replied politely, doing his best to skirt around the subject of Harry - he couldn’t bear to go back to calling him
With that he exited the cafe, leaving Draco speechless and red-faced. Being forced to write that diary might have just been the best thing that’s ever happened to him.
Thankfully, the door hadn’t been locked yet and he walked in, heading straight to the table he’d been sat on to see if the book was still there before he bothered the staff.
Draco sat back, resting against the bar as he scanned the crowd for Harry, absentmindedly wondering where he’d get good biscuit recipes from. He spotted Harry almost instantly and the sight of him in fitted robes was enough to have Draco salivating. They hugged him in all the right places and he had never seen a more perfect arse than Harry’s in those trousers.
Harry hadn’t said anything about their relationship out of fear that Draco didn’t feel the same. If Draco rejected him, he’d lose the quiet moments they spent together when they were alone, curled up under the blanket Molly had knitted for him, whispering about everything from their plans for the future to gossip about the teachers. He just couldn’t bring himself to take that risk.
“If you insist,” Draco said, biting the inside of his cheek to hide his smile at the joy that lit up Harry’s face.
“Opening party?” He wouldn’t promise Harry anything - he still thought it was far too optimistic to believe Molly Weasley would welcome him into her home - but Draco supposed he could try for Harry.
and smirking at him in a way that made Draco wish he could punch the expression off his stupidly handsome face.
Harry Potter.” Longbottom grinned and pointed across the grass, where Potter was kicking a ball about with the younger kids and making exaggerated dives. “He’s a softie, really. He isn’t interested in old grudges; he wants to move on from the war. That’s why he worked with McGonagall and the Board of Governors to set this camp up, so we can educate children about Muggle and Wizarding culture, and teach them skills that aren’t covered in the Hogwarts curriculum.”
He couldn’t wait to get into his pajamas and watch people on the Marauder's Map until he fell asleep. Hermione would probably complain about him missing out on precious revision time, but he was just so
“Congratulations, Malfoy,” Potter said from behind him. Draco turned around and barely refrained from pinching his arm to check if what he was seeing was real.
to you, young man. I won’t have someone Harry cares about being so formal.” Draco glanced out over the hall, where a dance floor had been marked out in the centre of the hall. The house tables had been pushed against the wall and were piled high with food. He had yet to see Harry anywhere and he was beginning to wonder if the man had skipped his own party.
A picture was stuck to the next page. A young boy with blue hair and fluffy wolf ears—who must have been Teddy—was holding up a pumpkin cupcake to the camera. The man next to him was hugging Teddy to his side and Draco nearly gasped out loud when he registered that this ridiculously handsome man must be Harry.
“Morning, Draco!” Luna greeted him as he opened the door. She was kitted out in yellow shorts and a t-shirt with a bright orange cat on the front, wearing a smile too bright and eager for any sane person to be wearing at half-past seven on a Sunday morning.
Harry was unbearably breathtaking, all tanned skin and easy smiles, and Draco could barely contain the urge to jump him.
As he approached the cafe he could see the staff cleaning and quickened his pace, hoping and praying that it was still there. He hadn’t realised how close it was to closing time and he hoped he wasn’t too late.
aren’t people I want to teach. I want you to be there.” If he didn’t know better, Draco would almost think Harry was asking him on a
. Underneath someone had stamped ‘Property of Hogwarts High School’. He recognised the name, as Hermione loved talking about the time she’d spent there, and he vaguely recalled her mentioning someone called Harry. It was a very common name though. He couldn’t be certain it was the same person.
“Oh, do go fuck yourself, Rita dear, and let an old woman sit down.” Molly Weasley appeared at the bar next to Skeeter and none-too-gently shoved her off her seat, taking her place and waving down the bartender for a round of Firewhisky.
Harry couldn’t believe he’d been stupid enough to leave his diary at the cafe. He’d kept it safe and in a relatively good condition since he was 17, and now he’d lost it.
They come up with some wonderful ideas, don’t they?” Luna laughed, handing him a cupcake. It was green and there was something purple sticking out of the middle, but Granger had eaten two since they’d sat down, so Draco supposed it wasn’t dangerous. “You’re good with children.”
Draco groaned as the cafe came into sight. Every table was full and with his luck, all the croissants would be sold out. Those book club ladies were like vultures when it came to fresh pastries. After the week he’d had, he was quite sure suffering through a banana muffin for breakfast would tip him over the edge.
"Come sit, boys," McGonagall says. They both do as such. "Now, I know you two boys haven't gotten along since first year, but this is just getting ridiculous. If I see any more of this hexing and fighting, I will expel you both." Both Harry's and Draco's eyes widen. "Now, since you two haven't been able to get along, we have devised a plan."
"I snuck out! She won't let me see you so I took matters into my own hands." Neville replies with a smirk.
He waits, and even eats dinner and takes a shower. Even after all that, nothing comes back until finally, after many hours, his owl comes back with a letter in his beak. Neville smiles and catches it as it falls.
"Blaise Zabini!" His mother's banshee voice screamed. He jumps up from his seat and stares at his mother with wide-eyes. "Turn that revolting music down and- have you been drinking?!" She shouts, "Answer me!"
The next day was all but uneventful. During potions that morning, Goyle towered over Neville Longbottom and threatened to beat him like there was no tomorrow just because he accidentally skipped a step.
"Over there!" Blaise says, pointing to the right of them and tilting his broom ever so slightly that way and riding ahead of him. Neville follows him closely and notices him leaning his broom down. He looks ahead to see where Blaise is going and notices him getting closer and closer to a field of wildflowers colored purple, yellow, blue, and white.
“Teddy, why don’t you tell your Uncle Draco about the potion you made with your class this week?” The change of subject was unexpected, but he went with the flow, chatting to Teddy and Victoire about Pepper-Up. Harry stared silently into his mug, as if he was hoping to find all the world’s secrets at the bottom, and leaving Draco feeling as if he’d done something terrible.
“They’re very responsible,” she insisted, staring Potter down and making Draco very glad he hadn’t refused a lunch invite. “They don’t need help. Besides, with you we have a perfect number of players.”
The next few entries were very similar; short and mostly about Hermione annoying him into revising and completing his homework.
why he was so distracted that he didn’t notice one of his oldest friends. He raised an eyebrow when Draco glared. This was obviously all Blaise’s fault, Draco was certain. He couldn’t pass up an opportunity to embarrass Draco and what better way to do it than turning up at his house with Draco’s old rival/not-so-secret crush? He wouldn’t rise to the bait - they were adults now, Draco could simply play nice for a few minutes then shut the door in Potter’s face, without any childish insults or violence.
“That’s what I wanted to ask you about, before you left for Switzerland,” Harry replied, suddenly appearing uncharacteristically shy and uncertain. “I wanted to invite you to the party. It’s for the dueling centre, of course, but the press made it a big deal, so McGonagall said that we could host it at Hogwarts during the October half term.”
On the inside of the front cover, a name had been written in cramped, spidery writing, which Draco could just about make out as ‘
“It is. We have managed to provide it to some of those who are connected with the hospital, but the Ministry refused to even let the healers at St Mungo’s take a look at it, so we haven’t been able to treat everyone.” Draco had a sneaking suspicion that his name on the papers that went with it hadn’t helped their case in the slightest.
“Aaaah!” They were doused in water as two of the children jumped into the pool next to them with screams of joy, pulling Draco from his daydream and interrupting Harry’s monologue about sandwiches and seats. Harry dived after the children with a playful growl and as Draco watched him swim away, he could think of little else other than
”How’s the dueling centre going?” Draco asked as they sat down in a booth. He was already starting to regret agreeing to join them; Harry seemed distant and rather off and Draco anticipated a long hour of silence ahead of them.
They both moved at the same time, lips brushing and Harry’s the cool metal of glasses pressing against Draco’s face. Harry was hesitant, as if he was terrified Draco was going to pull away, but pressed closer, his hands sliding up Draco’s arms to come to rest on Draco’s shoulders. It was brief and clumsy and
to see you again,” Draco drawled, folding his arms and straightening himself. Potter winced, running a hand through his hair nervously. There was a snigger from Potter’s right and Draco suddenly realised that Blaise was standing amongst the children, smirking in a way that told Draco he knew
” Draco cursed his luck as he fell to the floor, wand slipping from his grip. Potter was on top of him in seconds, kneeling over him as he pushed his wand against Draco’s chest and reversed the spell. Potter’s face was close, too close - Draco could see every speck of colour in his irritatingly mesmerising eyes, see every little crease in his lips and each and every freckle covering the bridge of his nose. He pushed Potter away, the applause from the children gathered around them snapping him out of his thoughts.
It surprised him, the intensity of emotions Potter was awakening in him. The swirl of anger and competitiveness rising in his chest was something he hadn’t experienced since the Gryffindor and Slytherin quidditch matches at the height of their rivalry, when his life revolved around finding ways to attract Potter’s attention. The thrill he got from Potter’s unwavering gaze awoke old emotions Draco had forgotten existed and he knew that this could only end badly.
After the trip to the beach, Draco had expected himself to be able to keep himself under control around Harry, despite his gorgeous figure.
Ms. Gallagher was overjoyed to hear that Draco was bringing children over. She was a painting that had come with the house and an 18th-century farmer’s wife who took great joy in mothering him excessively and criticising his eating habits. Her favourite past time was pestering Draco about starting a family and following him from portrait to portrait around the house, insisting that he wasn’t getting any younger. She was a pain in the arse most days, but he was certain he would have gone insane without her incomprehensible nattering while he brewed in his lab.
Harry couldn’t be certain when Draco would be back to his usual, less furry self, but he knew that when he was, Harry wouldn’t hesitate to show Draco just how much he cared.
“I make potions that help sick people, I don’t think turning my customers into tables would make them feel very good.”
“Why didn’t you say hello to me at the party?” Harry asked quietly, breaking the rather tense silence. They’d just stepped out of the cafe and into the snow, Victoire and Teddy running ahead of them to throw snowballs at each other in the nearly empty street. “Molly told me she spoke to you, but I didn’t see you at all.”
"Since late in fourth year... I never once thought about liking a guy, not even a Gryffindor before... But then I started to observe you. I will admit though, I observed you for selfish reasons... But then the more I looked at you... Well, you know how it goes." He chuckles nervously.
"No... he'd think I'm lying. Besides, it won't be true because well... it's more than like. But if I said I love him then that would just be worse. He'd think I'm some freak."
He rushes into the room, noticing Bellatrix holding her wand up to Hermione Granger's throat and Greyback doing the same with Ron Weasley. He looked over, seeing a boy with a puffy, swollen face being held in place by Peter Pettigrew.
"No, you apologize, Harry. Draco hasn't said a word." Dumbledore says, peering at Draco with his pale blue eyes. Draco tenses up. "No need to feel threatened. I'm here to help you, not harm you, Draco." Dumbledore gives him a smile.
"I'm fine." He grunts, "I need to get back out there." He says, trying to stand up. Blaise tries to grab his hand but Neville pulls away. "Why are you trying to help me? Why are you here?" Neville asks.
"Neville, you have nothing to worry about. Just relax, alright? Everything is ok." Blaise says softly, giving him a kind smile. "I'm not Professor Snape, you know."
"Well, you don't seem like the type to do that and well, don't think an old man doesn't notice certain things..." Dumbledore smiles.
"Don't worry. Even if you do, that'll only prove how much heart you have." Harry says with a smile. "Come on," Harry says, grabbing his hand and leading him back inside.
"The one thing I remember most is the time when Fred and George came by here and tried to order firewhiskey in their fourth year." Neville says with a small chuckle.
However, they are both quickly stopped when Hermione comes through the door with a distraught Neville. His hair was a mess and the bags under his eyes were gray.
"Yes I was! I was arrogant and mean to everyone. But why? It's not like I'm special or perfect enough to act like that. Father was right, I am girly and whiney. I am weak! Why can't I just look and act like a normal, perfect person?!"
“You look pleased with yourself,” Draco smirked, handing his key card to the receptionist on the desk. “Good night?” he asked, nodding his head as the receptionist explained his card had been charged for the room.
“That’s Potter? You said he was gangly and gross.” she moaned, shaking her head. Draco shrugged his shoulders, giving Harry a quick once over with his eyes. “He’s not bad,” he said, nonplussed. Sliding his Gucci sunglasses up his nose, Draco opened his car door and slid out.
“I suppose not, no.” Potter said, he looked perhaps disappointed. Draco chewed the inside of his lip and let out a sigh. “So, you wanted to watch movies, yes?”
“Head Auror.” Wilson greeted, swishing round the room with her charcoal black robes, her posture and swish was something even Snape would be envious of. “Unspeakable.” he nodded. Hermione closed the door behind her and walked around to the other side of the table, taking a seat next to Unspeakable Wilson.
he was blushing. “Is there something you wanted from me?” He managed to finish, quickly averting his eyes from Potter who let out a soft chuckle that made the blonds heart skip.
I’ve just had the most wonderful news Draco! Robards has just sent his Patronus. We’ve been given official permission from the DMLE office to stand down. I’m going to send this letter now, but you know what?
He decided on "When You Were Young" by the Killers. (when he'd told Pansy of his new iPod and music, she'd called him 'dreadfully edgy and not at all strange.' He turned the music up to full and closed his eyes, leaning his head back as though he intended to sleep.
Potter sat next to him, they were sitting so close together their thighs were touching. Weasley sat on Potter’s right, Longbottom on the end of their bench. The other side of the table had Hermione, Luna who Draco actually had a few conversations with, Dean and Seamus who appeared to almost be sitting on Dean’s knee.
“Everything okay?” Draco asked, a frown on his face. He’d been staring at Harry for the better part of fifteen minutes. He wasn’t usually able to stare at the other man interrupted but on this occasion he wondered if Harry would ever come out of his daydream. Biting his lower lip, his words did nothing for Harry’s current state. He repeated himself again, but still no joy.
Draco ran his hand through his hair and looked around the area, there was nothing out of the ordinary, the wheat field was high enough so the farmers wouldn’t notice them in the middle, the nearest building an old dilapidated barn, beside that a horse stable and to the far left the farmhouse itself. Biting down on his lower lip, Harry went through a mental checklist of where they’d looked at the last time they were here.
“I bet you did, do you want some food, good puss cat?” Draco cooed, he leaned forwards and rubbed his face on the cat, causing Potter to let out a chuckle. “I didn’t realise you liked cats so much, Malfoy.” He said, moving towards the two of them.
“What the fuck else was your father involved in?” Harry spat venomously. Draco let out a groan. “Fuck knows, but we’ll have to take this to Kingsley.” Harry nodded and looked at him sympathetically. “I guess there goes our evening plans.”
Draco walked towards the sofa and shifted Harry’s legs to sit down, once he was sat down Harry placed his legs on top of Draco’s thighs and threw the remote to him. “So on our only day off for the foreseeable, we’re going to watch shit television and sit around?” Draco asked, turning his head towards Harry, who looked effortlessly ruffled. Clearly, the man hadn’t bothered to change out of his pyjamas, nor did he brush his hair today. “Yeah, pretty much.” mumbled Harry, his eyes still fixed to the box.
After a few more bad guesses, Draco finally took pity on the man and let out an over dramatic sigh. “Well since you didn’t get the answer, I suppose I’ll have to tell you won’t I?” he said.
buy junk, I bought everything we need for spaghetti bolognese, I also bought new shampoo and a rubber duck, because I heard Arthur bring them up for about the hundredth time.” Harry burst into laughter, wiping a stray tear away from his eye. “He’s been talking about rubber ducks since I was about twelve.” admitted Harry, slumping back onto the sofa.
When you go to sleep tonight, I want you to close your eyes and imagine my arms wrapped securely around your middle. My face will be nuzzling your silken blond hair. Both of our bodies will be pressed tightly together, love. We’ll be one long line of heat that stretches right down to the very tips of our toes.
Potter turned around, his eyes resting on Draco almost instantly. “Oh, Malfoy.” he said, his eyebrows knitting together. Louisa was right, of course she was. Gone was the gangly, undernourished boy he once knew, stood before him was some sort of fucking golden Adonis. Draco groaned inwardly. “Potter.” he greeted, nodding his head. Harry’s eyes moved to Louisa, he gave her a quick up and down look, before offering a smile. “Hello.” Potter said, nodding again towards Louisa, who was rendered speechless. There really wasn’t a single part of Potter that was unattractive, not in the slightest. Draco was sure it was the worlds way of fucking with him just once more, just for shits and giggles.
“Hi, er,” she looked a little uncomfortable, narrowing her eyes she took in a deep breath. Harry always felt uncomfortable looking at Lavender, she had deep gouging claw-like scars that started at the top of her eyebrow to the bottom of her chin, no matter how many years passed they were always red as though it had been yesterday they were done. A result of the war, she’d suffered badly after the war was over, but returned to Hogwarts for her eighth year like the rest of them. A brave girl, with outstanding marks she was another Auror that aced her training and deserved a spot on Harry’s team. Gone was the chattery girl she once was, now quiet and reserved. Harry knew she shared a flat with Pavarti and Padma, but he really knew little else about her apart from what he’d learnt during Hogwarts.
“Shall we go to the Horse now, or?” Louisa asked, her heels clicking against the pavement - Draco chewed his lower lip, debating on if that seemed maybe a little too eager, then shrugged his shoulder. “I suppose, couldn’t hurt to get some food before we drive back,”
My chest is swollen with an absurd, illogical pride. I never believed that anyone would care, or want me enough to share their lives with me, let alone choose to carry my baby. Even though we’ve been separate, a part of me is still there with you. You’re growing our child, Draco, made with our love (and, I’m sorry, just a few atrocious tasting potions!) and they are getting bigger and stronger with every moment that passes.
In the morning, Draco awoke to an empty bedroom. It wasn’t entirely unsurprising Potter would’ve left before he woke up, then again they usually did that after they had gotten what they wanted from Draco. He would be a liar if he said it hadn’t stung a little. Draco was unbelievably close to making an idiotic mistake last night, kissing Harry Potter? What the fuck was that all about?
Walking next to him, Draco looked as lost in thought as Harry was. Since they’d found the Celtic Serpent trinket box in Lucius’ vault, the other man has seemed distracted, on edge. Draco worked damn hard to prove himself to the Ministry, they were ready to throw the towel in and declare him more of a nuisance than he was worth. After all, how could the Ministry of Magic protect people if those people didn’t trust them? For all Draco had proved himself, there were people who didn’t quite agree with an ex-Death Eater being a part of the Ministry.
“Err, I have no idea what that is?” Weasley replied sheepishly, scratching the side of his head in embarrassment. Louisa raised an eyebrow and let out an uncharacteristic giggle. Draco frowned.
Harry knew he was staring off into space again, but he couldn’t bring himself to do anything about it really. He was bored. Draco had been distracted ever since Harry had caught him in the break room with Hermione, he’d tried to ask again what they’d talked about but each time Draco brushed it off. He was starting to feel paranoid now.
Over the next few hours they began talking about different music they liked, different genres - until they moved on to books they liked reading or places they enjoyed visiting. Draco was shocked to discover Potter had a great deal of travelling experience just after the War, when he’d taken some time for himself. It seemed reasonable, he wasn’t entirely sure why the Wizarding World expected Harry to just throw himself into Auror training without a second thought, but it wasn’t Draco’s business. Draco finally explained his previous relationship with Samuel, his voice shaking as he described the amount of distress he went through in that particular relationship. Harry’s sympathetic responses somehow calmed his nerves, rather than got on them as they usually did when he spoke of it.
“Mm, I’m going to bed I think.” Draco sighed, rubbing at his temples. “We have that stupid Illegal Potions shit tomorrow.” standing up, he turned to Harry who had finished his tea and placed the cup down on the coffee table. “Mm, true.”
Sometimes Hermione would talk about Potter, mostly complaining to her husband about how Potter seemed to do absolutely
Sorry it's so late, I've had quite a few personal problems lately. Next chapter is coming very soon.
Potter pushed his copy of the Daily Prophet towards Draco casually, he then picked up a piece of the uneaten toast off of Draco’s plate and began munching on it.
“This wasn’t filled out by Lockwood.” he frowned, scanning each piece. “This here,” he tapped the file he’d taken out of the cabinet with his index finger and looked up at Harry, who was watching him closely. “Is a report I watched Auror Lockwood fill out, I know because I was teaching him the correct way to fill out a report.” he snorted at the memory, Lockwood had been absolutely atrocious at filling out correct field paperwork, he’d often miss sections or just write complete garbage, it irked Draco so much he stood for two hours discussing the proper way to fill out reports and basically micromanaged him. He never did it again after that.
Draco rolled his eyes, his eyes travelling down Harry’s body. He swallowed, then his eyes rested on the only article of clothing left on his fine physique. “Oi!” Draco shouted, it sounded unlike him and horribly common coming out of his posh mouth. Harry frowned. “What?”
“You do realise your house is like 400 odd miles away, right?” Potter said, scratching the back of his neck. Draco let out an uncharacteristic sort of cackle snort hybrid, his eyes widening as he realised his reaction. “Potter,” he said, trying to muster some sort of eloquence. “We’re
“Down the street, you won’t miss it - it’s ghastly.” Draco said, shaking his head at the thought. It seemed rather intimate really, considering the amount of time and galleons Draco had spent at that particular cafe, to take Potter of all people. A chuckle came from the dark haired wizard, Draco raised an eyebrow and simply shrugged.
Louisa nudged Draco’s arm, it seemed she and Weasley had stopped chatting a good five minutes ago to watch the exchange between Draco and Harry, Louisa had that mischievous look on her face again, causing Draco to scowl at her.
Harry shrugged his shoulders, then pulled his trousers down when the last button was undone. “Someone who doesn’t want to be muted, here you go, come bite my dick off then, I dare you.” he winked. Draco looked at him for a few moments, jaw gone slack and made a beeline for Harry, who started to move too. “No! No!” he exclaimed between laughter, he began running around the sofa, past the coffee table and towards the front door in just his boxers, Draco hot on his tail.
Draco looks at him, his tough act completely dissolved. "I suppose you're right." He sighs once more and says, "What about your family, Potter? What are they like?"
Draco bites his lip before saying, "I... I don't know... Maybe someone else can go first and I'll go last?"
He didn't tell her about his relationship with Blaise for many reasons, one of them being he just didn't think it was the time. The other being that he was terrified to tell her. What would he even say if he was asked if he was gay? He doesn't even know the answer to that question. To be perfectly honest, the only person he ever had feelings for was Blaise. Not even once did he think of anyone else or even consider dating anyone else. So, what was he exactly? He didn't think he was gay, but he for sure wasn't straight either. It's not like he wouldn't be open to dating anyone, but the thing is, he hasn't seen anyone that he's liked ever. Only Blaise. That's what confused him the most. But all of those thoughts seemed to dissappear when he was with Blaise. Everything seemed to go away with Blaise. Everything except him and Blaise.
"Me too." Draco whispers. "I've always kind of liked you, although I was also just incredibly jealous of you. I mean, look at you! You're Harry Potter... of course I'd be jealous of you... But I didn't expect that I'd want to kiss you too."
"Yeah! I mean, surely it didn't mean anything. I mean, perhaps the veritaserum was messed up... there is no way we'd like each other. Right?" Harry asks.
He looks back at Luna and she looks at him with a smile, "Anyways, I wanted to say that I've told all the Ravenclaws that we aren't dating. I know, if you've heard the rumors, you know what everyone has been saying." She sighs, "Some people just are so quick to believe everything they hear. Shocking to know they call me the loony one." She jokes.
Harry interlocks their fingers and gives him a warm smile. "That's great! Would you want to keep it secret for a while until we get comfortable or..."
"Draco, believe it or not, I am your friend. You may not like me, hell I know you don't, but I promise I won't tell anyone what you tell me. I won't even say I saw you today. Now I want to help you so please tell me what the hell is wrong with you." Blaise begs. "Seriously, you're kinda scaring the daylights out of me."
"We'll be prepared. Let's go." Harry says, rushing out the door and waiting for his friends to join.
He thanked his loud house-mates silently for walking in, as it quickly took away to scary, way too complicated thoughts he was getting into. Fred and George walked in laughing like maniacs with a few other Gryffindors who were nearly screaming every sentence.
Blaise stares down at Neville's arm as well, but not out of anxiety but rather debating whether or not he should hold his hand. But, why was it such a big deal? He held onto Luna's hand and it was no big deal. Why does this have to be a big deal?!
He sighs and walks off. Why did he still feel so terrible? Hannah was nice to him and actually seemed to like him, at least he hoped so. He trusts far too much. Yet, even when someone expresses care for him he still feels nothing, nothing at all expect dispair.
Blaise takes his pointer finger and places it under Neville's chin, lifting up his head softly. Neville stares up at him, eyes filled with a look of innocence.
"W-well, he doesn't seem to know to the concept of uh... Human versus t-toad food." Neville explains.
Draco sat on the bed across from Harry. The silence had lasted ever since he had gotten back from the hospital wing and it was deafening.
"Whatever. Goodnight." Blaise says, walking away as quickly as possible. He can't let her know how he really feels, how he truly thinks.
Neville and Blaise both had gotten married in the year of 2002 and stayed married until their death. Blaise had decided to drop the name 'Zabini' and is now Blaise Longbottom. They had one child named Naya Longbottom when had gotten sorted into Slytherin. When Naya was six years old, Neville had gone to visit his mother and learned that she was able to talk to him again! She didn't remember anything after the incident that put her in the hospital, but she was amazed to see her son all grown up and be able to meet his husband (which she supported fully) and their daughter. Sadly, though, she died two days later.
Neville jumps up and hugs her tight. She squeaks in surprise. "Thank you!" He shouts with a bright smile on his face.
"That's wonderful that you're safe as well! Merlin, I was dreadfully worried about you. I noticed how torn up you were about Dumbledore's death. I am so sorry about that. I wished I could've hugged you and told you it would all be ok. It hurt so much to see you that way, but I'm sure you were hurting more than me. But you're strong, I know you can pull through, with or without that bracelet. But I'm so happy that my gift has made your days better. You should give thanks to Harry and Luna, though. They were the ones to help me figure out what to get you since I wasn't in your house and well, we don't speak really at all. Also, thank that Hufflepuff named Hunter as well, he was very patient with my efforts at making those cookies. I ruined it maybe twice and he still was composed, even after I nearly threw a fit about burning the cookies. Now, to answer how I feel... I'll tell you that at the moment I feel amazing. I mean, I'm talking to you and you're safe and I'm actually getting good meals and I've been sleeping a bit better. I feel phenomenal! As for what it looks like here, it's so beautiful you wouldn't believe it. Right outside my door is a field of flowers with every color imaginable and there is life everywhere you look. The birds are singing and the sun is bright. It's amazing. It really lifts your spirits. I never would've imagined being in a place like this. Luna says it isn't much, but I think it's the most luxurious place I could've ever been put in. It beats my once dark home covered in dust and spiderwebs. There never seemed to be sunlight there. As for my friend... that's an issue. I don't know where he is. After Dumbledore's death I haven't seen him at all nor have I heard from him. It worries me a lot, but I try to not dwell on it too much simply to keep myself sane. But I keep telling myself that he's alright, even though deep down I know something has to be wrong. I just hope he's safe and alive. But at least I know one person I care for is alright. Also, what do you mean by figuring yourself out and why does it make you feel like that? I apologize, I'm not a ravenclaw."
Blaise furrows his brows and thinks for a bit. He's right. If he never met Neville he never would've known what true love felt like and would've been stuck in a life of lust and manipulation. He never would've known empathy, compassion, and most importantly: happiness. Even if he did feel miserable at the moment.
The Dark Lord was very close to him, stepping closer every minute. He pressed his lips together at an attempt to keep them from shaking.
Dumbledore then raises his wand, waves it in a spiral motion, and taps the bracelet three times. "There's the first step. Give it a whiff!"
He instead runs to his dorm and closes the door tight. Luckily, no one was up there with him. He closed his curtains, casts muffliato, and puts the covers over his head.
"Please look at me, Draco." Blaise begs but Draco doesn't do it. "I hope I didn't upset you or anything by not standing by you-"
Harry is baffled. They're the ones who took the potion?! Not to mention they're doing it all to humiliate Neville. He wonders if Blaise is in on it. He wouldn't put it past them.
Draco wanted to just ignore it, to walk out of the room and sleep elsewhere, but he couldn't move. Not when he was so in shock.
“They like you,” she said, passing Longbottom the sausage rolls and brushing a fly off her jeans. “It’s very difficult to get seventy teenagers to like you.”
Hermione could tell the man was nervous, his hands shook maybe a little more than what would be considered normal. Hermione made a noise in the back of her throat, feigning impatience. Harry knew she rarely threw her weight around, but desperate times and all that.
Draco wanted to know every last detail of this sordid affair, even if it wasn’t strictly his business. After all, he had Bethany to contend with. How the bloody hell would he tell her Louisa shacked up with war hero Ron Weasley for the night? Bethany was even more of a gossip than Draco was, and that really was saying something.
“You don’t usually help.” he mumbled under his breath, pulling out the minced beef from the fridge. He cut open the packet and dumped it into the frying pan, placing it down on the front ring of the hob. Harry shrugged his shoulders.
“Are you sure?” Harry frowned, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder. Biting his lip, Draco looked at the hand on his shoulder and let out a sigh. “I talked with her family, it’s weird. I spent so much time with her and now she’s gone.”
“What are you doing here?” asked Draco as he exited his Mercedes, he wasn’t even sure how Potter knew where he lived. If he had to hazard a guess he’d say Louisa, the sneaky bitch. Potter shrugged his shoulders casually and walked forwards, passing the pizza box towards Draco.
“Think we’ve found Endelton, does Hermione need you for anything else?” Harry looked around, not seeing Hermione anywhere, he needed to ask how the interview went but he’d do that when they got back, there was no time for it just now.
“Anyway, he was asking about you because he doesn’t know a lot about you - we all know from experience that Harry loves to find out about Draco Malfoy, in any way he possibly can.” The chuckle that escaped Hermione’s lips was very unlike her, and beside her a smirk settled on Ron’s face.
Looking down at his watch again, Seamus realised one thing. Auror Lockwood would’ve had one too. He thought back to the meeting they’d had when they were told how to use them, he remembered it registered coordinates of other Aurors at all times whilst the watch was being worn. Which meant Lockwood always knew where the others were. No wonder they always got away. A shift beside him caught Seamus’ eye, Draco began stirring. Dean quickly removed the stasis charm and knelt next to his fallen friend. “Are you alright?” he asked quietly.
Looking down at his mobile phone which had just alerted him of a message, Draco frowned, it was a text from his boss. Draco still hadn’t the heart to quit his job, he worked in a dentists’ office in London, when he was declared fit to use magic again, Blaise had been there - which was the last time he’d actually seen him.
Draco snorted. “I very much doubt that, Potter, you’re the most famous wizard in England.” He shook his head. It was true, Draco was pretty sure Potter was more famous than bloody Merlin himself now, but he wouldn’t admit that to Potter.
Harry groaned and peered down at the parchment in Draco’s hands. Seamus turned to the two men and walked forwards. “There’s faint spell traces here, they lead off to the edge of the field. Maybe a few days old, they’ve definitely been back whoever it was that was here.”
“Morning,” he smiled, kissing her on the cheek lightly. Louisa smiled in response, brushing a strand of her golden blonde hair out of her face. “Sleep well?” he asked, his eyes drifting around the large lobby towards the reception desk. “Yes, actually.” Louisa nodded, a light blush stained her cheeks.
“Unspeakable Zabini is one of our deep undercover Unspeakables, his cover being Gringotts.” he started, Harry’s eyes widened his head immediately snapping towards Draco, who looked equally shocked. “Unspeakable Zabini has a lot of connections, as well as a lot of skills that we do not like to announce to the public.”
Draco and Harry had met up for a week straight, following the man in various different ways, first with the invisibility cloak, then with polyjuice potion. Draco had gotten bored one day and decided to just walk up to the man and ask what he was doing, although it hadn’t gone very well and resulted in a very sore black eye, which he was teased for relentlessly by Harry.
“Uh, hey Malfoy,” Potter said, sitting on the bench across from him. The other man looked awkward, out of place and entirely uncomfortable. “How are you?” he asked finally, his eyes fixed to Draco’s plate of pancakes, avoiding his gaze.
Harry’s bedroom was definitely not as impressive. He walked in and closed the door behind him, shaking his head in response. Pulling his t-shirt over his head, he threw it down on to the floor and pulled his joggers down, stood only in his boxers. Draco blushed darkly, luckily there was very little light in his bedroom - Harry would probably not notice. Draco followed suit and threw his clothes on top of Harry’s. It felt intimate somehow, but regardless he padded over to the right side of the bed and pulled back the duvet.
“Has anyone been out about this crop circle yet?” asked Draco, frowning. Seamus nodded his head and stood up. “Nah not yet, we were going to have a look but we wanted to wait for you two first.” Draco nodded in response. Chewing his lower lip, he turned his head towards the office door and sighed. “Well whatever they’re doing is private and important so how about us three go and check it out?”
“Except we didn’t, we didn’t find out anything - we got trapped in a supply room and talked for the better part of five hours,” Draco pointed out, nudging Harry back in response. “Not only that, a visit to the Ministry and St. Mungo’s and they took my bloody book.”
“At least we have three.” nodded Lavender, they made their way towards Draco and levitated him up. Harry bit his bottom lip hard. “I’ll take Draco to St. Mungos, Dean, you and Seamus take him to the Ministry” He gestured his head towards the man they’d taken, with Seamus’ impressive crotch Stupefy. “Lavender you take Lockwood, Endelton and Henderson take the one back there. Put Lockwood in maximum security, the rest in the holding cells.” He pointed over his shoulder at the perp he’d taken down. Watching the expressions of his team, there was no way he could keep any of them out of the loop now. He’d told Kingsley his team worked better when they were all together. Without Lavender today he’d not have been able to do what he had. She was an invaluable member of his team. He smiled fondly at the woman beside him.
“Trying to suffocate myself, Draco nobody gets up at 6am.” he whined. Rolling his eyes, Draco shifted closer and wrapped his arm around Harry’s waist, shuffling closer so he could snuggle in. “I set it because I like to sleep in, this way it feels like I’ve done it and I still have time to get ready.” he mumbled into Harry’s bare chest. Harry just laughed. “That’s a solid idea actually.”
I’m glad I can get such a reaction out of a simple letter, perhaps I should write to you more often. I wish you were home, it’s quite lonely here without you. Orion is still whining like an old bint. I fed him a sausage, I’ve never seen anyone eat it as fast and as messily as he did and I’ve eaten at a dinner table with Ronald Weasley.
“Have I really been sat there for four hours?” he moaned, turning his head to Draco who’s smirk had deepened, he’d not really seen that since school and it unsettled Harry somehow. “Well, I did talk to you a couple of times but all I got was a series of grunts, caveman like, you know?” A wicked grin spread across Draco’s features.
This state of affairs between Ginny and Pansy does seems to have gone from tepid to sizzling hot in the space of only a few weeks. I agree with you: it all seems rather sudden. I mean,
It had been four days since Kingsley had ordered Harry to go dark on the Celtic Serpent group. Everything seemed to be going well so far, Endelton, Brown and Henderson hadn’t suspected anything was amiss, but Harry was growing more and more frustrated as the days passed. They hadn’t gotten any new evidence, information and as they seemed to have gone dark, so had the Celtic Serpent group. The only thing keeping him sane was the fact that Draco had kept letting him sleep in his room. He’d asked again the second night and Draco had merely shrugged his shoulders. By now, he didn’t even bother asking he just joined him as soon as he said he was going to bed.
“Never gets old.” Harry smirked, shaking his head. “What doesn’t?” Draco asked, shoveling the piece in to his mouth. There was no grace in eating pizza. “You eating pizza, Mr Pureblood pomp, gourmet extraordinaire” Harry teased again, opening his own pizza box. “Oh that’s a big word, have you been perusing that thesaurus I bought you for your birthday?” Draco teased back, winking at him.
With his father in Azkaban, his mother moved to Paris to get away from the haunting darkness of the Manor. Draco felt unwavering loneliness, his friends had all moved on and found something worth living for, whereas he felt like he was stuck in an endless cycle of hating himself, hating life, no motivation and the lack of enthusiasm for breathing. He wasn't depressed, per se, he was just - tired. The motivation to find someone ‘special’ (as Hermione had put it) filled him with dread, especially considering the last relationship he’d tried.
Pansy had become pretty good friends with Hermione and Luna, but Luna more than most. Being the editor of Witch Weekly, they talked a lot of shop what with Luna being the editor of the Quibbler and they liaised on quite a few articles between them.
Draco finished writing in the notepad and picked his tea up again, listening intently as Harry had a light conversation with Olive about her pumpkins - then her grandchildren, what turned in to a light conversation turned into a full blown discussion about cooking. Harry enthusiastically discussed Draco’s cooking, praising how much he enjoyed it when he did cook, then explained they were much too busy for that these days. Olive had put a hand on his thigh and smiled. “Well, if two lovely young men like you can work together too, you’ll be married for years! Just like me and my Henry.” Harry blushed profusely and shook his head, but Draco couldn’t help but notice he hadn’t put her right about their relationship.
Once all four of them arrived back at the Premier Inn, as fate would have it once again there were only two rooms available. Draco definitely didn’t want to share a room with Louisa and Weasley, of course he loved her to bits but there were certain parts of that woman even he didn’t particularly want to experience. So in one room housed Louisa and Weasley and the other Potter and Draco.
“Alright then, let’s go see another Quidditch match.” he said after a few moments, sounding utterly defeated.
Draco had planned to meet Potter at the Hungry Horse which was about a mile away from the arena, an hour after the match ended. Draco secretly hoped Weasley would accompany him so he could show Louisa that he really wasn’t anything special - but another part of him wanted this to be over quickly so Draco could retreat back to London to the comfort of his flat, where his cat Meowth would be waiting for him.
Seamus let out a breath and shook his head. “Murdered, but they’ve…” he trailed off, swallowing a lump in his throat. “They’ve cut…” he stammered, shaking his head again. “Merlin, you just need to see it - it’s unexplainable.”
“Yes, it was in my memo pile, nobody can get through those office doors unless they’re you or me, or one of us is present when they enter.” he frowned down at the sticky note and levitated it into a spell proof clear plastic bag, sealing it at the top. “I wonder if Hermione has seen anything like this.” Draco wondered out loud, causing Harry to chuckle. “If she had she’d not tell us, Unspeakable nonsense and all that.” Draco nodded in agreement and stood up, picking the bag up. “I’ll take this through and see if there’s any curses on it and see if they can maybe trace who sent the memo.”
anger Harry, but it was the fact Draco had not told him that hurt the most. It was written in perfect handwriting, not too different to Draco’s but Harry had spent enough time and read enough of Draco’s writing to know it wasn’t his.
After the three of them had securely warded the area and set up boundaries so they’d be alerted if anyone apparated or disapparated nearby, the three of them apparated to the Ministry to report their findings.
as smooth as anyone on the team might have wanted. I caught a couple of hexes and have the most vicious looking bruise that even the most powerful healing magic has failed to vanish.
Lavender’s eyes wandered to Harry, she looked as though she was going to say something so Harry waited expectantly. However she ducked her head down and began scribbling something on a scrap of parchment that lay next to her. Once she’d finished, she walked quickly over to Harry and passed him the offending parchment. He nodded his head and stepped back.
Harry wasn’t really sure what was going on between them, but they came home so exhausted at the end of the day they barely got around to eating nevermind talking. He was sat at his desk, twirling his self inking quill round his fingers. He’d assigned Endelton to clean up after a few wizards got in a heated debate which resulted in a duel, slap bang in the middle of Carlisle. Brown had gone with him, he suspected something was going on with Henderson and Brown, but he didn’t pry into his Auror’s personal lives.
Harry had decided to clear his head, he’d take Draco with him to visit Mrs. Dunn about her prized pumpkins. He wasn’t sure if this was Kingsley’s idea of a joke passing this particular case on to his department, but he decided not to press. There were other Aurors that could deal with this sort of case, but then Harry mentally scolded himself for thinking so highly of himself.
“Hermione.” he sighed, a breath of relief. “I know, before you say - that you can’t tell me anything that happens here,” he started, narrowing his eyes and glaring at the witch on the desk. “But I have some information to share, just in case you’ve come across it to.”
Once Draco had been patched up, he was immediately discharged. It amused him somewhat, he got better service when people hated him because they just wanted to get rid of him as fast as they could. “Well at least we figured out the riddle.” Harry said, nudging him gently.
Draco must’ve zoned out somewhere, because he was suddenly being nudged by Potter. “Malfoy?” Potter asked. Snapping out of it, Draco blushed scarlet when he noticed all of the tables occupants now had eyes on him.
When they entered the Ministry, both seemed in good spirits. Though, neither one of them dared to talk about what happened this morning. Whenever they’d catch each other’s gaze they’d simply just smile, like they had a secret that nobody else knew.
“Couple of hours, that department is an absolute joke.” he moaned, dropping down to his office chair with a thud. “I don’t know why it takes so long for them to do anything but it bloody does”
Harry pressed a kiss to Draco’s forehead, then moved towards the seat beside his bed, plonking down into the cushion. Draco began to explain what the Healer’s had told him upon waking up, there wasn’t much of it he really understood. Something to do with curses that tie to your dark mark, some malarkey. To be honest, Harry didn’t care either. The only thing he could think about was taking Draco home, locking him in the flat and then never leaving the safety of their comfortable place again.
“That’s because you’re a bit of a sap” Seamus smirked, causing Draco to glower at him. “I am not, that one is full of tragedy!” he stated. “My entire life is a tragedy, I want something scary.” Harry smirked, shaking his head at Draco’s reaction. “You’re scary enough.” Draco scowled.
“Yes well, I’m full of surprises clearly,” Draco drawled, rolling his eyes. This really was the most surreal experience of his life. Once Potter had gotten the dvd put in the player, he grabbed the remote, jogged to the kitchen and reappeared a few moments later with the pizza box, which he placed on the coffee table in front of the sofa.
“Auror Lockwood said something to me the last time I spoke to him, he said ‘I wonder how the guys are doing with those crop circles’ and I just shrugged. I didn’t like him very much, he was a bit of a pompous prick,” Draco’s sentence was a said just a little faster than his usual tone, he was surely excited about this find. “I never thought about it at the time, but he inadvertently slipped up, or maybe he meant to do it but I just didn’t think about it.”
Kingsley sighed. “We need to talk to her anyway Harry, you know this.” Harry nodded, he felt guilty. He’d not even told Narcissa that Draco was in hospital yet. He’d told nobody, he didn’t want to, he just wanted to be with him. “I haven’t told her he’s in hospital yet, neither Andromeda.”
Once dinner was prepared, Harry began to set the small circular table near the window. Draco had frowned deeply and watched him for a few moments. The question was on the tip of his tongue, there was definitely something wrong with Harry. Draco had made such an effort to learn how to cook and he was very proud of himself, but Harry
As Draco arrived outside Thistle Do Nicely, he frowned at the sullen look on Harry’s face. He sat down quietly beside the other man and chewed on his lower lip. “Are you alright?” he asked, immediately regretting the decision. Potter looked surprised Draco did indeed ask, but he studied Draco for a moment before shaking his head. “Not really,” mumbled Harry.
with Potter, and he’d heard from other people the other man could be a bit of a sassy arsehole, but he’d never witnessed it himself.
Harry chuckled and shut the door behind him. “I went to the Department of Mysteries, showed them our paperwork, got a scowl off Wilson and came back here.” he countered, slamming down on to his office chair.
“Nothing.” Harry replied simply, turning his body towards his desk. “Right well, I briefed Kingsley, you did the field report, we’ve sorted the evidence out. I’ll ask Dean and Seamus to assist Auror Endelton to the Cabin for investigation, I’ll ask someone from spell damage to go with them just incase,” he ran a hand through his hair, he seemed to be picking the habit up from Draco. “If you go down to International and maybe see if they’ve reported any of the Celtic Serpent group in their countries, maybe we can figure out if it’s worldwide, uh.” he trailed off, frowning. Draco stood still, listening to Harry intently, he nodded his head in agreement and waited. “I’ll speak to Hermione, I know the Unspeakables can’t tell us anything but if we share it with the Department of Mysteries maybe they won’t be so…”
The fourth time it happened, Draco had been staring at a sausage on his plate for a good twenty minutes, often he’d zone out and start thinking about something that carried his attention off somewhere else. On this particular occasion, Draco had gotten a little stuck thinking about a book he’d been reading, he’d taken a particular liking to muggle romance novels, a man in his latest edition called Thomas had fallen in love with a local drug dealer (to which Draco had to search the definition of) the story itself was fascinating and he found himself spending all of his waking moments reading or thinking about it.
“Fine.. Merlin.” Harry whined, hoisting himself up off the sofa he slipped his boots back on and frowned, looking down at his robes. “I’ll change first, don’t want to scare the muggles.” he mumbled, wandering off to the left. Draco smirked.
Mrs. Dunn let out a gasp and then growled. “Bloody Tommy, that’s Jim’s brother! I bet he stole them for him.” she let the cat down from her arms and placed her hands on her hips in defiance. “If I find those bloody pumpkins anywhere near our competition I will be setting them on bloody well fire!”
He knew Unspeakable work was, well unspeakable, but he wondered if his wife knew. Ron didn’t know much about Hermione’s work, but he did know she was an Unspeakable. Harry supposed it was because Hermione was so known in the wizarding world, it would be almost impossible to be in Blaise’s position for Hermione. His thoughts travelled to how it would be for Blaise, hiding a part of himself from everyone that knew him.
Beside him, Harry didn’t feel any better. He’d been surprised when Draco suggested sleeping with him. Admittedly his mind drifted to other things ‘sleeping with’ meant, he had to turn away to hide the blush that rose up his neck, staining his cheeks. If he was honest with himself he’d often thought about Draco in.. Certain sexual terms. Rolling his eyes, he turned his head and looked over at the other man. Shifting closer to Draco, he wrapped his arm around Draco’s waist and rested his head on Draco’s chest. Hoping it wasn’t crossing a line, he waited for a moment but when he heard no response from Draco he bit his lower lip. “I hope this is okay.” he whispered, he felt awkward.
Draco opened his eyes, squinting at the light. The most indescribable pain like a lead brick pressed against his temple. “Ughh” he moaned, bringing his hand up to his head. “What the fuck..” he whispered. Pulling himself up onto his knees, Draco noticed Auror Lockwood studying him. Draco’s eyes went wide. “Fuck, what the..” he was caught off by the sound of pounding feet only somewhat muffled by the grassy field. He turned his head and spotted Harry, relief flooding through his entire body.
of lovemaking you’ve envisioned will be enough. Certainly, it won’t be for everything that my rioting imagination desires… I’ll leave the rest of that sentence unfinished, love. I’ll write the end tonight, lay in my lonely bed; my dreams flooded with images of your soft, flawless skin and the scent of your lemony soap.
I had better go Draco. I need to have a little nap before this evening and centre my thoughts on the job. Give my love to Orion, that spoilt, wheezy old Crup. I hope he’s not quite as chubby as I envision that he’s gotten from your letters. Otherwise I’ll have to race him around the Grimmauld garden until he’s in better shape! I know that you don’t need me to tell you this either, but please watch the Potioneering too. Promise me that you’ll not attempt to brew Wolfsbane. Your health- and that of our baby- is far too important.
Shaking his head, Draco picked his own fork up and held it in his hand for a few moments. “You don’t help cook, nor do you set the table. We rarely bloody sit here, what’s wrong?” Harry shrugged his shoulders and shovelled a forkful of spaghetti in to his mouth.
“I can’t wait to lay down,” Harry said as they apparated just outside their flat in an alleyway to the right of the building. “I’m knackered.”
My mother has been rather irritating too, she keeps coming to Grimmauld with all sorts of ‘herbal remedies’ to help with male pregnancy, she’d read about them in an old book in the Manor Library, honestly Harry, I’m about to flip. I said, Mother we have Potions now for that, you know this. Can. Not. Get. Through. To. Her.
I’m thinking that you’ll need to give me some extra special TLC when I’m at last in your arms. Every part of me, body and soul is crying out to be with you. I can’t wait to wrap my arms around that newly ‘rounded’ waist of yours (I’m sure Pansy was only being honest!) and show you exactly how much I’ve missed you…
“Wow, I’ve never seen Ron so interested in someone since Hermione.” Harry laughed, shaking his head in disbelief. Potter had been trying to get Ron’s attention for several minutes to no avail. Instead, Harry ordered a third Full English instead. Draco ordered the Caesar salad for Louisa and two Gin and Lemonades.
Hermione followed him into the room and closed the door behind them. Immediately walking over to the chart at the end of Draco’s bed, she picked it up and began scanning it. It wasn’t different to the one the Healer gave her earlier, but she wondered if they’d kept something from her. Hermione often worried that Draco would be refused treatment because of his status during the war.
“The Unspeakables will be questioning the suspects.” Kingsley said evenly, smoothing down the papers on his desk. He stood up and eyed Lavender. The woman let out a noise of protest, shaking her head. “This is ridiculous, we brought them in,” she growled. “The Unspeakables have Lockwood in their department, why can’t we bloody well question the suspects we have in
The Malfoy family had lost quite a lot of money due to reparations, but still held ample resources even afterwards. Narcissa had sold the Manor and moved to the south of France, she once commented she belonged there. It always brought a smile to Draco’s face.
Harry gathered Seamus and Dean and they congregated in the break room, once they were both inside with Harry and Draco, he locked the door and cast a silencing spell around the room. Seamus looked at him with a frown. “What’s up mate?” he asked, sitting down on the sofa near the shuttered window.
Olive grinned and nodded. “Yes yes, my pumpkins - oh, my grandchildren I mean, they like my tea too.” She stood up and wandered back off to the kitchen, returning a few seconds later with a tray of biscuits.
“You really should start dating again, Draco,” Hermione said, looking at him with a pained, sympathetic expression on her face. It wasn’t that Draco didn’t
“Oh, but what about dessert?” suggested Louisa, giving Draco a pleading look. For such a petite woman, Louisa didn’t half know how to eat. Whenever they were in company they didn’t know so well she’d order a salad, but in private they’d gorge themselves on pizzas, kebabs, burgers, well anything really.
Harry shook his head in dismay. “I think Ron’s in love.” he said, turning his head towards Draco. The fond smile on Potter’s face reminded Draco of himself, every time he looked at Louisa. Sometimes, when Draco thought about it he wondered what the hell happened to him - he used to keep others at arm's length, they were just useful. It was true he still kept in contact with Blaise and Pansy, but they were never as close as he was to Louisa.
A gentle tapping on his office door pulled him out of his thoughts, he snapped back abruptly, staring at the door. The tapping was a departmental memo, he looked down at Draco who seemed to be mentally putting himself together. He cursed his luck, shaking his head. This was a conversation for another day.
It had been two years since Draco’s trial, he’d been sentenced to house arrest for six months and lost the use of magic for those two years. During that time, Draco had decided to integrate himself into the muggle world. Although he was grateful for Potter’s testimony, he did suffer from crippling depression in the six months he was stuck in Malfoy Manor. That was one particular place he never intended to return to.
Harry nodded and waved him off, watching as the blonde exited the office. He sighed and looked down at his case pile, it was going to be a long day. The top folder was purple, which meant it was from their Spell Damage department, he remembered getting the folder detailing Ron’s spell damage, it was so extensive they thought he would lose the use of his leg and for the Wizarding World that was rare, especially with their advances in healing and spellwork.
“I’ve never been on holiday.” Potter admitted, he turned away from the canvas, his eyes resting on Draco. A fond smile appeared on his lips, he walked to the couch and sat down beside him. “I brought Lethal Weapon, Lethal Weapon 2 and Lethal Weapon 3,” Potter said, passing the DVD boxes to Draco, who took them with a smile. “Oh, I like those, which is your favourite?” Asked Draco, he looked down at the boxes and he could tell Potter had watched them before, the disk boxes were quite worn, a rip on the plastic sleeve of Lethal Weapon 2.
“Food, then?” suggested Draco, looking up at Potter for confirmation. Harry nodded. “Yeah, sounds good.”
It worked like a charm, every time. Hermione coughed and narrowed her eyes. “Harry isn’t like that, is he Ron?”
After the war, Draco had written letters to all of the people he’d hurt - explaining that he understood he deserved no forgiveness, but he was deeply sorry from the bottom of his heart. Harry remembered before he went back to Hogwarts for his Eighth Year receiving such a letter, tears springing to his eyes as he read it, Draco had desperately wanted to seek approval of his father. Lucius had been killed by an Auror as he was escorted to Azkaban prison, which spurred Draco in to writing the letters, no longer held back by his father. Before they’d returned to Hogwarts, Harry had returned for rebuilding and sought Draco out accepting his apology, he’d offered his own apology and they’d worked together to rebuild Hogwarts, along with Hermione and Ron, Neville, Luna, Ginny and Lavender, who had recovered well from her attack.
Tapping her fingernails against the desk, Unspeakable Wilson gathered the paperwork up and waved her wand, they instantly disappeared. Harry didn’t bother asking. “Like I say, I know you can’t talk about anything you do, but in the interest of cooperation and catching these guys I thought it was important to share it with you.”
’ I am, bloody slut shamers,” Harry started, shaking his head. “However, I’m a virgin.” he said quite proudly. Much prouder than Draco would’ve ever assumed anyone would be at that announcement.
They’d talked about it in detail once before, what would happen if one of them died in the line of duty almost like a married couple would do. The thought caused Draco’s stomach to flip violently. He could remember the pained expression on Harry’s face as Draco explained things he wanted done on the event of his death, he was sure the man was about to throw up.
He was immediately rewarded with a bone crushing hug from his partner, his eyes widened he then smiled softly and wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist. “I’m alright, let me go before you break more bones than I can heal.” Draco scolded.
“Oh hush Draco, you’re such a boring bastard,” chided Louisa, swatting his arm with the back of her hand. Louisa was just lucky he loved the bloody wretch. “What’re you having?” Louisa asked, looking towards Weasley, a smile never leaving her face.
“Well, you see…” Draco looked down at his feet, he felt somewhat uncomfortable asking this particular question, he’d rehearsed it in his head for two years now, but now the day was here how do you ask your former rival for your bloody wand back? Especially the one he took from you?
“Well, I’m actually here to see you,” Draco said, he kept his tone as neutral as possible even with his inner turmoil going on. “I actually got the tickets off Granger..” he trailed off, gauging Harry’s shocked expression. The man was all rippling muscles in his tight t-shirt and jogging bottoms, a golden tan that looked as though he’d been bathing naked in the sun for months. Draco really needed to get the image of Potter sprawled over a deckchair completely naked out of his brain.
They arrived outside Gringotts and Harry had to mentally prepare himself. After what happened during the war the Goblins absolutely loathed him, he always felt deeply uncomfortable when he entered the bank. He cast a sidelong glance to Draco, who smiled at him apologetically, before they entered together.
It just had to be Draco’s luck that the Magpies did indeed win, so here he sat in some dingy pub in Edinburgh opposite Potter once again, with Louisa to the side of him fawning over Weasley. It was becoming some sort of cosmic joke that was his life, he was sitting watching the Quidditch match wondering if he wanted them to win or not, while Louisa was utterly engrossed he phoned his neighbour to check on his cat, he’d left enough food out to feed the bloody cat for about ten years, but he worried nonetheless. As it turned out, the cat was fine.
Draco nodded his head, frowning at the pizza box in front of him. “So?” Draco asked, opening the box up. He took a slice of pizza and brought it up to his mouth, sniffing a little before he took a bite.
“You’re mental.” Draco said, shaking his head. Louisa made a noncommittal sound, shuffling around in her seat. Granger had given him really good seats, obviously not in the box where he usually would’ve been, but they were excellent nonetheless. “Oh it’s starting!” Exclaimed Louisa, a bright smile on her face. Draco narrowed his eyes, he really loved this daft woman. Often, he wondered what his life would’ve been like had Louisa been his sister, they shared a connection unparalleled. Actually, he’d quite like Bethany as his sister too. It was funny to crave something you never had.
Harry cleared his throat, looking up at the door in front of him once again. “He’s going to be alright, isn’t he ‘Mione?” his voice faltered, he was trying so hard to hold back the tears threatening to fall. A sympathetic look flitted over Hermione’s features, placing a comforting hand on his shoulder, she nodded her head. At this point, nobody really knew whether Draco would be fine or not. “Of course.” she tried as hard as she could to support him, but she could tell Harry was falling apart with each passing hour. Six hours was far too long to wait for an update. Hermione walked over to the door, knocking on smooth wood gently.
Potter couldn’t help but smile with that fantastic dazzling smile that he had, sending Draco’s mind into overdrive once again. “Finesse,” Harry said, raising an eyebrow. Finally, shrugging his shoulders Harry nodded. “I suppose she does.”
“Oh, er, well Luna plays this Sims game and he’s one of the characters - you know what, it doesn’t matter,” he let out a strained chuckle and closed his eyes.
Potter looked at him with a raised eyebrow, scanning Draco’s features. He then shrugged his shoulders. “Ron was devastated when he broke up with Hermione, they don’t really speak much now either,” he sighed. “He dated Pavarti for a little while after, but she left him for Dean so that was even more awkward.”
Merlin. If I’m this protective now, I can only imagine how bad I’ll be when it’s finally confirmed that you’re expecting our baby. Your every whim will be my command! I’ll probably end up growling at people for coming too close or something equally embarrassing. That’s why I’m loath to criticise Narcissa too much. I know that she’s overbearing but she’s only showing how much she loves you in her own
“Eye spy?!” Potter spluttered, sitting up on his elbows to look at the blond. “Are you serious?” he asked, grinning from ear to ear. Draco rolled his eyes and lifted himself up, propping his back up against the headboard. “Well we’re not going to get to sleep with Sir Shags-alot and his Mistress, Lady Sausage Wallet are we?” he groaned. This only caused Potter to laugh even louder, he fell back against the pillows, clutching his stomach.
Draco walked off to the right, immediately walking through the high tree trunks, branches, leaves and twigs crunching under his boots. He quickly cast a silencing charm on his feet and stealthily jogged through the forest, his eyes scanning for any signs of movement.
“Ron would like to know if you wanted to go to their match today, he can get us tickets.” she smiled. The hopeful expression on the woman’s face was all she really needed, Draco was putty in her hands. It was weird how much he cared for this annoying, wonderful woman.
“You’re wasting time.” came a voice from Lockwood’s right, the cloaked wizard who had spent the entire exchange casting had walked towards Lockwood, his tone was cold, uninterested. “Let’s just get this done.”
The second time it happened, Draco had been sitting out in the courtyard, he watched as light snow fell through the sky, landing gracefully to the floor. Draco could see his breath before him, he had his gloves on but he’d forgotten his hat, his hair had grown quite a bit, sitting just below his shoulders, his fringe fell in front of his eyes.
“Same as the other one.” she said when she caught Harry’s eyes on her. He nodded. “Right.” Harry walked towards the bed, settling on Draco’s right side. The sides of his hair still covered in blood, but he was now wearing St. Mungo’s pyjamas. Harry frowned. “Why didn’t they clean him up?” he asked, his eyes narrowing. Hermione sighed, “They probably didn’t want to touch the wound.” she offered, sitting down on a wooden chair near the window.
“Did you catch my pumpkin thief? Was it Jim? I told you!” she pointed at them, shaking her finger. Harry bit his lip, trying to hold back a laugh. Draco cleared his throat and nodded his head. “We caught the pumpkin thief, it was apparently Tommy Jenkins, is that name familiar to you?” Harry noticed Draco had tried to sound as professional as possible but really, it was a case about a missing batch of pumpkins.
Draco’s heart leapt. "Why is that excellent?" he asked, turning his head towards Potter once again, the look of pure confusion on his usually impassive features.
“Fine, and you?” Draco asked cautiously, expecting at any point Potter was going to start fisting him. Realising what he had actually thought, Draco ducked his head down and blushed scarlet.
“Harry!” Hermione called, running towards him full pelt. “What’re you doing here?” she asked curiously, a frown on her face. Harry had walked in to the Department of Mysteries ten minutes ago and spent that entire ten minutes arguing with the witch on the desk. Every time he came here, same with International Cooperation he had issues with the staff. He wondered if Kingsley purposely hired people for these desks just to piss him off.
“No wards?” Potter asked, closing the door behind him after he entered. Draco merely shrugged his shoulders. “Not really much point, I live in muggle London and I’m rarely in the Wizarding World,” he walked inside, through the corridor and into the kitchen, pacing the pizza box down on his kitchen counter. “I can’t say anyone has ever really tried to find me.” Draco finally added. He turned around to face Potter, who was looking curiously around Draco’s kitchen.
Harry nodded, though Draco probably couldn’t see it. “Yeah, she’s really the only one that understands how absolutely fucked up I am but doesn’t push me to ‘do better’,” he said, the latter dripping with sarcasm. “Hermione constantly reminds me I should be doing better with my life, Ron tries to get me to join him in the shop, if I talk to Neville he suggests 'oh Harry, how about you come and be a teacher at Hogwarts!'” Draco could hear the slump of Harry’s head hitting the wall behind him. “It’s utter bullshit, I’ve never even had a proper relationship, I’ve gone on like three dates and somehow the entire Wizarding World assumes I’m some sort of Don Lothario, playboy fuckboy.”
“I think we should give up and get trashed instead.” Harry concluded, nodding his head as though his mind was made up. Draco snorted, shaking his head. It worried him a little, he seemed to spend his life drifting from one moment to the next with little interest or motivation to find something better. The last week he’d spent with Harry actually felt
When Draco came to, the first thing he noticed was the absolute stench he could smell. It smelt of sulfur, rotten eggs, perhaps a gas leak, something of that sort. Opening his eyes, he let out a groan - there was a dull ache in his head, as though he’d been hit over the head by a spade several hours prior.
They’d known each other less than twenty-four hours and they already seemed besotted with each other. There was no way Draco actually believed in love at first sight, but he was beginning to question his judgement a little.
They watched the rest of Alice in Wonderland, Draco made commentary here and there, he jumped like an excited child at some parts, near the end of the movie Potter solely focused on watching Draco instead, he was intrigued by the blond. This was not the Malfoy he remembered, he always suspected there was more to the man than meets the eye, he found himself captivated in a strange way.
Draco nodded in agreement. They walked up to the door together, Harry lowered the wards and unlocked the door, letting Draco go ahead of him. “Fancy pizza?” asked Harry, walking in after him he locked the door behind him and raised the wards again. Draco frowned at him and walked through the door to the living room.
He had it in his breast pocket, folded neatly. His heart began to race wildly as he’d read it. He reached into his pocket, his fingers tracing the edges of the paper. He thought about showing it to Harry before they entered the Ministry, but he chickened out at the last possible moment. He knew Harry would be angry, so instead he kept it to himself.
Bang on five minutes, Harry apparated to the coordinates just East of the first warehouse, he could feel his heart begin to beat rapidly in his chest. Quickly taking in his surroundings, the place was deathly silent, not even a bird in the sky. He took note of this quickly, walking slowly towards the warehouse.
We did it, I can’t believe we did it! Come home soon and safe, I love you, I told Orion and he jumped up on me, I think he’s happy too or perhaps I fed him too much chicken, but he's a fiend Harry! A fiend I tell you! Regardless of that, Potter, get your hide home before I tan it! I'm so happy I'm about to throw up again, which is
“Err, yeah I have.” Potter nodded, turning his head towards Draco. Their eyes met for the briefest of moments, Draco ducked his head down a pink blush tinged his cheeks. “It’s a good one.” Draco muttered under his breath, his eyes wandering towards the television screen.
Draco’s head snapped towards Harry, who had put on Whitney Houston. A tsk escaped Draco’s lips before he could reign it in, causing Harry to chuckle lightly. “Come on, give her a chance Draco,” Harry said, shaking his head at the blonde.
Harry nodded in agreement, his mind flashing back to Draco’s frail form lying unconscious in the field. “He was hit by a Stupefy, which propelled him backwards - he hit his head off a rock jutting out of the grass, he woke up briefly and cast a Petrificus Totalus on a perp, to which he then passed out.” he frowned, turning his head towards Hermione. She held her hands up “I wasn’t there, but you can’t get curse damage unless perhaps the rock itself was covered in something?” she then shook her head. “I can’t really say either way, I haven’t heard of a concoction that causes damage to nerve endings.”
“Ugh you do it, I’m Head Auror I’m a busy man.” he moaned, putting his arm over his eyes in mock pain. “I’m Deputy Head Auror, I’m busy too.” Draco pointed out, clicking the kettle on. “For fuck sake Harry buy the bloody pizza before I starve to death.” Draco groaned, pulling two cups out of the cupboard overhead and placing them down on the counter beside the kettle.
They sat in silence for around twenty minutes before Healer Jenkins and another healer Harry hadn’t met before entered the room. The woman walked towards Draco’s bed, pulled her wand out and cast an incantation, Harry watched confused and awed at the same time. His entire body illuminated with specks of gold and silver, before dulling down, turning to a deep red.
Potter’s eyes widened, he nodded slowly and cleared his throat. The other man was clearly awkward too, why the hell did he keep doing this? Draco was about to pull his newly returned wand out and just hex the bastard, maybe if he threw a few unforgivables around he’d get put in the Janus Thickey ward, because obviously he was losing his mind.
“Harry are you alright?” asked Lavender, her tone was soft, something that didn’t usually come from the woman. Harry nodded slowly, a pained smile directed towards her. “Yes, thank you.” he whispered. Harry thought back to Lucius Malfoy’s vault. They’d seen the trinket box together, but Draco had been the one to shield it and bring it to the Ministry. “Lavender,” he started, he frowned the overwhelming sense that he’d forgotten something - he clicked his fingers. Harry’s eyes then widened. “Lavender, can you go to the Ministry, ask for a meeting with Unspeakable Wilson, the box, the box we recovered from the vault. Ask Unspeakable Wilson if she’s scanned it.” Harry gave her a knowing look, Lavender nodded and stood up.
“Yes, she's very good, she has a powerful voice, an attractive lady if you can get past the fact she has the wrong parts - she has…” Draco trailed off, trying to think of an adequate word to describe his favourite singer. “Finesse,” he settled on, nodding his head in agreement of his own words.
Draco shook his head “I only know what Granger told me, he’s doing a Quidditch match in Edinburgh and she bought me tickets” he laughed.

Harry often felt the cold, which amused Draco since he always felt like he was on bloody fire. “Yeah usual place, er - can I get two chicken chow meins, some chicken balls with barbeque sauce,” he looked over to Draco, who was nursing a cup of tea and leaning casually against the island counter in their kitchen. Draco had also changed into a pair of soft black linen trousers and a long-sleeved green top. Harry mouthed ‘do you want the chicken stuff?’ to Draco, who nodded in agreement.

Passing over a piece of parchment, Harry’s fingers curled around it, crumpling it slightly.
