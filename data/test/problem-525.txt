Harry stiffened, and glanced at Draco who’s face had an unreadable expression on it. He didn’t look at Harry, and Harry felt like a fool. He didn’t know why he felt the sudden need to explain that he didn’t want Draco to misunderstand what Luna said.
“Why, Draco you look positively relaxed, have you done something different in your relaxation practices?” Astoria asked, leaning over the table slightly in interest.
Harry half-heartedly agreed with her, he wasn’t too sure about staying with Draco after everything that had happened. Also, because of the strange attraction he had to the blonde, it would be awkward. He thought about what Draco said about letting his guard down around the servants of this castle. They’ll strike at any sign of weakness, and what time would he be weaker and more defenseless as when he’s sleeping?
“I have to say Miss Granger. You made quick work of him, he’ll make a good servant yet.” Queen Narcissa nodded towards Hermione. Hermione smiled and bowed. Queen Narcissa turned back to Harry. “She really did do good. You’re a quick learner, we need more servants like you.”
“Prince Malfoy, as the messenger and maid of your mother the Queen, I have been ordered to do whatever I deem fit to get this information to you. If you do not open this door, I will.” Hermione waited, and Draco still did not open the door for her. “You leave me no choice then.”
This took longer to get out than planned, but it also turned out longer so hopefully that makes up for it! Hope you enjoy it!
“Cedric, Cedric Diggory. Head chef, I make all the meals.” Cedric took his hand back. He pointed to the boy cutting up raw meat. “That over there is Seamus Finnigan, my right hand man and-” He pointed to the African-American boy. “Dean Thomas, our dish boy.” Cedric snickered. Dean flipped him off, and continued washing dishes. Draco chuckled, and Dean flipped him off as well.
“You may punish me as you wish later, but please spare him if he is not guilty of anything. I could teach him to clean, he would make an excellent servant if given a chance,” The girl held her hand in front of his face as she spoke to the woman. He watched through the girl's fingers as the woman crossed her arms and turned her glare to the girl.
“So, what do you do here? You’re too pretty to be a servant,” Harry asked Luna. She looked up at him and laughed. Harry blushed, perhaps he’d been too blunt. She set down the shovel against the side of the overhang. She wiped her hands on a rag.
I love and accept all feedback, I don't bite. Please leave comments!
On his walk through the castle. He tried to figure out where Luna’s room was to see if she was there. Confused about the layout of the castle, Harry walked up to a servant with a red ribbon tied around his belt.
He was woken from his trance by her hand sliding over the back of his. His hand had stilled on the knife. He took a deep breath and the pang in his chest began to subside, he looked down at her and smiled. He moved his hand out from underneath her hand and continued chopping the rest of his potatoes.
The guard bristled; his eyes shifted between the two teens. After a couple seconds he frowned and nodded. The grip on Harry’s arm loosened and the guard used his hand to gently guide Harry down the hall.
Harry was about to inquire what Draco was doing when the door flung open. Luna stood, panting in the doorway, before taking a deep breath and calming herself. She takes a look at the situation, before walking in. She needn’t announce her presence, as Draco called out from behind his wardrobe dress sheeting, “Shoo, Loony.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Do you know how long it took for me to get him to sleep comfortably? Why’re you here Luna?” Harry frowned at her. She took a step back in bewilderment.
Everytime his fingers accidentally touched the Prince’s skin the blonde would jump a little. He stopped at about mid sternum so a small bit of collarbone and neck could be seen. Draco began to tuck his shirt into his pants.
He takes a step back, and then a few more. He stumbled back, over a rock, and crashed to the ground.
Harry let out a deep sigh and began taking mental pictures of how the armor was put together, before taking it apart. He set each piece away from the next, while also keeping it in a good order so he knew how to put it back together. If he got confused he’d ask Draco, and then ask Hermione later if she could teach him.
Draco attached the sheath and slip to his belt, hanging one on either hip. Harry watched in awe as Draco slipped his sword into the sheath. He’d never seen Draco with the sword before, and he looked magnificent.
They rode slowly next to each other. Harry had his hands stuffed into his pockets, and Draco kept a hand on the horn of his saddle.
Lucius Malfoy entered first, and Harry shuffled behind Ron a smidge. Ron smirked at him, but said nothing. Lucius sat at the end of the table in his large chair. Harry swallowed as Narcissa sauntered in, her gown flowing steadily behind her. She sat with grace, and gestured with her wand to fill her glass with some sort of red drink, Harry couldn’t tell. Luna came running into the room, galloping and twisting and dancing to her seat, in which she sat down and waved at Harry, who blushed and waved back. Ron stared at him incredulously.
“Yes that’s me, hello.” He removed his hand from the excited grip of the other. “Would you happen to know where Luna’s room is?”
Draco walked up behind Harry to say something when the Princess turned around again. Draco had paused and Harry looked over his shoulder at him ready to ask something when Astoria shouted, “If you need some help with the dinner tonight Harry you can ask one of the Greengrass’ servants, they’ll help you with anything. They’ll be wearing a red ribbon in their hair to help decipher the difference between everyone else who works here.”
“Miss. Granger, you dare question us?” The woman snapped at the girl. The girl looked to her.
“That’s quite alright Harry, you need not worry about it if it makes you feel uncomfortable. I can have one of my girls help me. Sorry for the trouble Draco.”
Harry shook his hand and wondered if everyone in the Greengrass’ palace was as decent and gentle as the people he’s met so far.
Draco heaved a sigh. As he began to explain the days schedule Harry began to dress the Prince.
“Of course I’m bloody beautiful, I’m a Malfoy.” The Prince boasted with a grin. Harry sighed into his hands, the Prince was too much to handle.
“Oh! Prince Draco, how lovely you look! You’re positively glowing.” The girl had long braided dark hair and her smile was so bright Harry’s chest fluttered at it. This girl was so much more pleasant than Princess Pansy.
“No, no! I’m not insulting you. Ah, haha. You’ve taken the words from me,” Harry laughed. Draco’s frown dropped from his face and a look of shock appeared as what Harry had said sunk in. Harry blushed, and cleared his throat.
Harry woke up with a groan, the sun had just come up and was shining through the thin windows onto his eyes. He sat up and looked around. His blankets had fallen off the bed, and his back ached. Hermione was already showered and dressed. Ron had just returned from the door across the hall, Harry guessed it was the bathroom. When he was washed, he dressed in spare clothes Ron gave him, and hurried out to meet Hermione.
“There’s some suit armor in there, and some swords. I’d like you to polish them. When you’re finished cleaning the armor, clean my room, and prepare me a bath. I’d like to take a nap after you’re done. When you’re done you can do as you please.” Draco nodded to the armor, and then to the room. “I have some studying to do for a meeting with my father tomorrow, please don’t make too much noise.”
Harry crawled onto Draco’s bed and curled up on top of the blankets, facing him. He began shushing Draco, any whimper that escaped the Prince’s lips was met with a quiet ‘shh’ from the servant. Harry wiped the tears from his Prince’s face with the pads of his thumbs. Draco’s cheeks were softer than the skin of his stomach. An embarrassing comparison to make, Harry realized. Draco’s whimpers had stopped, but the boy still continued to shake. Harry brushed the pale blonde locks from Draco’s eyes and traced gentle touches on the boy's face.
Harry’s legs felt like lead, and each step took a little more energy from him. By the time they reached the third floor, all Harry wanted to do was sleep. It’d been a terribly long day, one of the longest he’s had in awhile. He missed his mom, her voice, lulling him to sleep after a hard day. He missed working on the farm, plowing fields, and playing with the dogs. Those were good long days.
“He is the prince! You work for him as punishment for breaking the law. He doesn’t know your life, he’ll treat you as he sees fit until he does! He is great and he is powerful but even he has limits to what he is allowed to do. Didn’t you learn anything from your conversation with him yesterday? He’s young just like you, forced into things he does not want to do. You have different lives, Harry. You won’t understand his life because you haven’t lived it.” Her voice trembled.
She smiled back at him, before waving her wand at the food, levitating it down the hall. Harry ran out after her, and watched as she placed each plate at each setting at the table. They backed away and stood by the doors as the Malfoy's poured in for breakfast. Harry's eyes scanned the room, and landed on Draco's empty chair. He hummed and excused himself from the wall, walking over to the table politely.
“I’ve got it Malfoy, you can rest.” Harry whispered, sliding his hand over Malfoy’s to take the knife and the squirrel. Draco’s hand twitched as Harry’s fingers brushed over his knuckles, and he jerked his hand back. Harry didn’t question the action, nor the tingling sensation that crawled up his arm. He began to skin the two remaining squirrel. Draco stood up and wiped his hands clean on a rag.
Harry stood up and turned around, “Ah!” He gasped when he almost bumped into the annoyingly curious boy. He placed a hand over his heart and glared up at the boy. “If you would please move, Malfoy is waiting on me. I would rather not lose my head, thank you.”
Harry was puzzled for a moment but continued cutting. He wanted to mention that he saw her earlier but didn’t know how to bring it up. He kept sneaking looks at her out of the corner of his eye.
“Harry?” Hermione crowed. He snapped his head towards her. She smiled at him. “I’ve been trying to get your attention for a bit now. It’s beautiful isn’t it? The cool air, the warm sun, the peace? It’s my favorite part of the day. The royals aren’t up yet. To answer your question, it's about five in the morning. The sun wakes us every day, we bathe, we dress, we do our morning chores, and then we eat.” Harry looked at her incredulously.
“She was a maidservant in my palace, she had a daughter who worked in the palace with us. Her daughter was pregnant with child, and we set them up with a home shortly before the fall of my kingdom. They managed to escape before the tragedy. It’s nice to see her every time I come here with Draco to see Pansy.”
But somehow the prince had assumed that harry wouldn’t hurt him. There was an underlying trust, and Harry felt something in his chest move at the thought. He couldn’t discern what the emotion was that he felt.
Harry’s eyes filled with tears at the memory of his mother, he never had any bad dreams when she held him. He grabbed his sheets and pulled them off his legs, and swung them over the side of the cot.
Once everything was placed, he walked back out into Draco’s room in search of a bucket and rag. When he didn’t see one in sight he walked out into the hall, aware of the eyes on his back. He walked to a hall closet, and grabbed a bucket and rag, perhaps they refilled themselves magically, because the bucket was full. He looked around at the small closet for anything else he could use to clean, and when he found none, he shut the door.
The next morning, Harry was awake as the sun rose, they bathed, dressed and cleaned. Harry was faster than the day before but nowhere near as fast as Hermione. Harry had made sure the stairs to and from the floors were cleaned well, as Hermione had scolded him on how terribly they had looked yesterday.
The guard led Draco and Harry into a large barrel-vaulted hallway. Harry walked slowly to admire the art on the walls and the textured tiles that made them. They looked to be all hand painted with delicate work. Draco glanced at him and whispered, “They were made by the townspeople.”
He saw Neville, standing in the middle of the room. He glanced between Draco and Harry and then ran into Harry’s room. Draco smirked, and walked out of the common room. Harry stormed after him, pissed off with him for acting like a spoiled brat.
“Hello Draco, always with the few words. So stoic of you, so much like your father. How is he, finding his power a little lacking lately?” Draco stiffened at her words. Harry already didn’t like the vibe of her aura. Harry didn’t miss the jab at King Malfoy’s power, though he didn’t understand it. “Oh, and if it isn’t Loony Lovegood, we’ve missed you terribly here. The servants have been restless without their favorite toy hanging around, they’ve almost been asking for more work.”
“What’s with the face, Potter?” A low voice came from down the hall. Harry jumped and dropped the broom. His ears red with embarrassment he scrambled to pick up the broom. Only managing to kick it further, he grabbed it and then ran his free hand down his face. Luckily, he didn’t kick it down the stairs that were just behind him.
Harry walked over to the closet, and took a look inside. There were clothes everywhere, everything was sorted out neatly. The shirts were hung up and in color order. The shirts that didn’t fit on hangers were piled neatly in opened drawers, with pants and shorts of the like. Draco’s shoes were arranged along the bottom side of the closet walls. There was another door inside the closet, a small personal armory. Harry opened the door fully, and walked inside. The room was bigger than the actual walk-in closet, and he had to have guessed it was the work of magic.
Harry's face heated in embarrassment, and he shook his head. Draco walked over to his bed and laid out his clothes. Harry watched the blonde boys limp curiously. He decided to poke fun at the prince.
Harry realized that the third floor was much nicer than the first and second, this must be where their rooms are. The stone was much lighter, had more of a slippery feel to it. Hermione had cleaned the third floor, she knew it better. Harry could almost tell the difference between his and Hermione’s cleaning. Perhaps Draco was right to make him clean the Throne Room again.
“Nothing, Granger.”
“He waited until my room with me while I changed,” Luna shrugged. Harry immediately felt like he was in hot water with her admission. Draco turned to look at him, and Harry cowered under his gaze.
“Hey, Hermione?” Harry asked. She looked over at him from where she was standing by Cedric. “Would it be possible for us to go into town together sometime?”
Harry couldn’t see the Prince’s face, but he knew he didn’t need to, to know how the Prince was feeling. Draco was about to begin a decision that would change the rest of his life, and he didn’t even have a choice in the matter. Harry swallowed, realizing his throat was dry, and nodded. Draco made the servants seem nasty, and from what he’s heard from Luna and Hermione if their Princess was just as nasty then he’d understand.
“Gross, I hope not. The bloody gits got no good qualities. I don’t even understand how his parents love him.” Ron shivered as disgust rolled down his spine. Harry smiled grimly at Ron. He could see where the ginger was coming from, but he wouldn’t go so far as to say those horrible things. “Blimey, and he’s ugly too.” Ron added. Harry stopped short from responding when he realized he disagreed, he thought Draco was bloody beautiful, minus the blonde’s personality.
“What'd you trip over a log yesterday or something?” Harry chuckled, halfway out the door. Draco looked back at him, an empty look in his eyes.
“I hate him,” Harry seethed. He clenched his fists, and slammed one into the wooden kitchen door. Blaise jumped, and nearly spilled the trash on the ground. The boy glared up at Harry, and gathered himself quickly. Cedric handed Ron and Harry the plates they needed to carry, they’d return or more, since Hermione wasn’t there to help.
He covered her hand with his and squeezed it. “You know you’re very motherly when you try,” Harry laughed. She flushed and pulled her hand away, swatting him.
“You can tell me with the door open, or you can leave,” Draco spoke. Harry’s eyes widened. Hermione looked between Draco and Harry, her eyes lingered on Harry for a second longer before she nodded.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m doing swell, love. How are you doing? Is it any easier after the child?” Luna asked, and led them into the shop. She waved for Harry to follow the, in while chatting away.
Several other servants he didn’t know were playing a cards game at another table. A few bedroom doors were shut, like his own, but several were open. There was a heat orb in the corner of the room, and a few floating candles lit the room from above them. He needed warmth, comfort, but he didn’t know where to get any, so he walked into his room and sat down on his bed. He glanced briefly over at Hermione and Ron, they were still asleep. Their clothes were soaked with sweat and they reeked.
“These almost look like temporary shops.” Harry muttered, and followed him. Draco nodded.
“Thank you for the help Harry, give Cedric my thanks for a wonderful dinner,” Luna smiled at Harry. She touched his hand gingerly with her own, before skipping out of the room. Draco was the last to leave, standing up from his chair slowly. Harry wandered over to him.
“You seem very fashionable, everything you wear is in good taste. You look really handsome in anything you own, while I can’t tell the difference between blue and black in certain cases.” Harry heaved a sigh, and looked down at his outfit. Maybe if he had better clothes, his tastes would improve? He seemed to dress Draco well but he could bet Draco would look good in anything, the damn prat.
“Uh, you mean, Luna and I packed, while you did whatever you did,” Harry corrected. Draco shot him a glare. Luna laughed at the both of them, and jumped on her horse.
Before he knew it he was done, he opened his eyes slowly and looked in the mirror. His jaw fell open slightly, as his hair was shorter but curly on the top with short almost shaved sides. It was more masculine than what he’d had before, when his curls hung down past his ears. He could see his jawline, and his ears perfectly now. He looked clean, he looked good.
Once they reached their room the guard stopped and reached his hand out to knock on the door. The door swung open and Harry couldn’t control his surprise. Draco frowned at him and raised an eyebrow at the noise that had come out of Harry’s mouth. Harry chuckled to himself, embarrassed. He cleared his throat and stood back up, as he’d taken a step back in his surprise. There was a pretty girl on the other side of the door. Harry felt stupid, he thought maybe the knock had opened it with a sort of wandless magic, but someone had simply opened it from the inside.
Since dinner was supposedly already being prepared, and he’d never served dinner before, he absolutely needed to wake them up. Under any other circumstances, where he knew what the fuck he was doing, he would have let them sleep. He glanced around, before he muttered a cleaning spell at them, an action he could do wandless. He would’ve removed their clothes physically but he figured it would be painless to do it with magic so he wouldn't have to peel Hermione’s shirt away from her new and slightly old injuries. He gently shook Ron to wake him.
And his chest clenched together uncomfortably when he lay awake at night, thinking about what had happened the second day at the manor. He thought about Draco opening up for that brief moment, allowing Harry to see the torment he was facing. He thought about Draco facing away from him, refusing to look at him, too overcome by the feeling of having made himself vulnerable.
, Harry almost let himself think.
Their eyes met, and Harry’s fiery green determination was met with Draco’s glistening grey contemplation. Harry searched Draco’s eyes for doubt, fear perhaps, something that was making him hold back.
“You need to concentrate”, Draco began, speaking slowly and purposefully.
losing. Bets, games, arguments, anything. Harry watched, amused, as he grit his teeth and shook his head.
He thought about the time he spent with Malfoy, about how well they’d worked together, about the fights they didn’t really mean and about the one that they did.
“You did it”, he repeated again, almost yelling, “oh, Harry, you’re incredible!”
Harry climbed on top of him and they fumbled with each other’s clothes, Draco desperately tugging off Harry’s shirt as all the tension they’d built over the last days (or much, much longer, which neither of them were quite willing to admit to themselves) overflowed. Harry, who was far less patient, simply vanished Draco’s shirt before flicking his tongue at one of his nipples, grinning as it turned hard. Draco moaned as Harry licked it again, brushing his finger over the other one.
On the fourth morning they’d argued again, and for the first time they both felt genuine anger. They’d just cracked through the last of the curses and Harry suggested they go in and start the raid while Malfoy argued that it was stupid and they should call for backup given how advanced the curses were. So naturally Harry had suggested Malfoy go find a better partner if he thought he wasn’t good enough for the job.
“Want to put me to the test, do you Draco?” he taunted, eyes narrowing.
In the split second the wizard Malfoy had been duelling was distracted by this manoeuvre, Malfoy cast a rapid succession
and he was sure Draco knew his.
“Oh fuck”, Malfoy cursed, and it sounded like a mixture of desperation, lust, and residue anger. And then he grabbed Harry’s face with his hands and crashed their lips together.
again and he only held out for a few moments before the memories came flooding back; even when he called it a day and thanked Draco, when he apparated back to Grimmauld Place, when he went to bed that night.
The rest of Harry’s sentence gets stuck in his throat as he watches Lucius Malfoy walk slowly, purposefully, towards his son. He looks almost manic, his eye twitching occasionally as he looks down at his son.
Draco sat up- now face-to-face with Harry- to remove his turtleneck, and it mussed up his hair in the process. Harry, who was already shirtless, stared.
”, every “harder” that escaped Draco’s mouth.
In return Potter had spoken for Narcissa and her son at their trial.
, we both know you’re wrong here.”
Malfoy obeyed. He didn’t object, didn’t tease Harry for his suddenly more dominant tone, he didn’t even smirk or sneer. He simply turned around, lying on his stomach, and Harry
Nevertheless, he himself would not be able to hold out much longer, so he gave in and lined up his cock with Draco’s hole, pushing in in one go.
And his chest clenched together uncomfortably when he lay awake at night, thinking about what had happened the second day at the manor. He thought about Draco opening up for that brief moment, allowing Harry to see the torment he was facing. He thought about Draco facing away from him, refusing to look at him, too overcome by the feeling of having made himself vulnerable.
Draco looked at his wand in Potter’s hand, almost incredulous. Potter cleared his throat lightly and extended his arm further.
Draco sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose; Harry had seen him do it before, in the Great Hall at breakfast before an exam. He knew all his habits, how he behaved when he was angry, when he was frustrated, when he was upset. Harry knew all of Draco’s
Harry, who pulled away slightly, waiting for Draco to yell at him, to call him disgusting and weird, to get up and leave.
Draco and Narcissa had thrown out everything but their beds, wardrobes, and the three armchairs of the living room, along with two chairs and a table to eat on in that same room. It had brought back too many memories, too many awful flashbacks every time they saw the large conference table on which Professor Burbage had been violently tortured and murdered, every time they saw the bed Voldemort had slept in, the cabinets that reminded them of the Vanishing cabinet. Everything was just wrong and they tried helplessly to erase every last memory of the war by burning down a pyre of everything they didn’t absolutely need.
“You may enter,” a soft voice called from within the room. Harry cracked the door open a smidgen to peer into the room, before stepping fully into the room. Luna was sat at a desk, writing away in what looked to be a diary.
“Potter,” Draco spoke. His voice was light, and Harry glanced into his eyes. He froze, a shudder washed over him as he met the stunning grey eyes that bore into his soul, and his breath caught. He watched as Draco’s eyes wandered down his form, and back up again to meet his frozen gaze. “I needed to speak with you, it’s good you’re here. Come pack my clothes while we talk.”
“I am always alone. I prefer the solitude.”
“How was your day Harry?” Hermione asked, keeping Harry from leaving, even though he had one foot out of the door. He pulled his foot back in and shut the door gently.
“Every wizard is trained in combat. Every mudblood, every half-blood, and I should pose the idea of muggles training in combat but my father may not like the idea too much.” Draco informed him as he walked down the corridor to a room.
“Well, I’ll attend a royal breakfast, and then I have to go on several dates. I must try to court one of the three Princesses here today, I’ll go out with each of them to figure out which woman would be the best fit to be my Queen. Tonight there will be a ball, so I’ve asked Luna to take you down into the town to buy you proper clothes. This ball is very important, as it should seal the decision I must make. Do you know how to dance, Potter?”
Draco stopped. Harry took another step back away from the Prince and towards the door. Draco looked regretful, in a way. Harry didn’t care, he kept going.
His ears flushed with embarrassment. “Sorry I was,” he paused.  “Why were you crying in the hallway earlier?”
“What are you doing here Luna?” Harry asked, glaring at her. She got really close to face and he backed off from her, leaning towards the wall his bed was perched against.
“You like what you see?” Draco asked him, smirking through his breath. Harry took one last sweep of the room with his eyes, and shrugged.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw movement and glanced over at Draco, who was out from behind his wardrobe and was watching them closely. Harry flushed and looked back at Luna.
Harry reached out and held Draco’s hand that clutched the bed sheets, and brushed his thumb over the soft skin. The touch seemed to shock Draco, and the boy’s demeanor suddenly changed. The movements stopped, and the boy stopped shaking. Harry watched as Draco curled in towards the body heat he presented at the side of the bed. The grip he held on Draco’s hand loosened when the grip was reciprocated. He slipped his hand out of Draco’s and walked back towards his cot on the other side of the room.
“Why Prince Malfoy, just what do you have in store for Princess Pansy, that you would feel the need to go alone?” Hermione giggled. Draco blushed and glared at her, though it didn’t look so menacing with the blush on his face.
“Don’t you mean Loony Lovegood?” Ron chuckled. Hermione swatted him on the shoulder, but then turned back to Harry. Harry was glaring at Ron, feeling protective over Luna.
“Another time.”
“I-I’m hiding, I guess you could say,” Harry stuttered. Ron leaned in, curious. Hermione nodded for him to continue. “From Lord Voldemort.” Ron’s eyes widened, and Hermione gasped.
He stood in shock as Draco grabbed Hermione by her hair. She screamed and cried.
“What do your parents do Hermione?” Harry asked, thinking perhaps a change of topic was best. Hermione beamed at the question directed at her.
“Why are you asking about Luna, Harry?” Hermione asked, leaning forward. He smiled lightly at her. He began to tell them about his meeting with Luna. Hermione’s attitude brightened as she listened to Harry talk about Luna. When he had finished telling them about Luna, Hermione glanced over at Ron.
Harry was shocked at her tone of voice. Harry noted the slight cock of Draco’s head and realized the Prince was also surprised by her sass. Pansy continued,
“Meet me outside when you’re ready.” Luna pointed at Harry, and then turned around and walked away. Without a word Harry turned back to his work and packed many shirts that looked like the shirt Draco was wearing earlier in the day. Harry paid no mind in what Draco was doing, and only focused on folding his shirts and trousers.
on the one who had cast the ropes around Harry, then stupefying him.
Harry had locked his leg firmly in place, and kept his angle, with every thrust sending bursts of electricity through Draco’s skin. He groaned.
He had no reason to come back. His business there was done.
“This okay?”
“I’m going to use the spell on you now, Potter”, Draco warned him.
The sun had been down for a good hour and it had been equally long since they’d spoken to each other. Harry sat by the fire, watching Malfoy work. He stood in front of the cave, wand and hand raised as he moved both in intricate movements, mumbling words Harry didn’t know. He listened to the soft tapping of the rain on his dome of charms as he mused on the man in front of him. The fire illuminated his back and seemed to dip his body in soft gold, the flames dancing on the fabric of his dark green jumper. Even from behind, Harry could watch him work silently for ages, but decided that he better make sure they both rest as well.
“I should have known it was a bad sign when I was having fun on the job”, Malfoy snapped, his eyes narrowed, staring defiantly into Harry’s own.
Raising Draco’s left leg slightly with one hand, Harry guided his cock into Draco with the other. They both groaned in unison as Harry pushed inside him in one go. And then he pulled out again, almost all the way, before pushing in. Harry repeated this, and his pace gradually grew until he was fucking Draco with a steady rhythm.
“Fuck, Potter, I said
Satisfied with Draco’s response, Harry pushed his cock in entirely in one go, hard and fast, and began thrusting in a similar fashion.
“I did it because I had realised I was on the wrong side. And I cared, Potter, I still do. About everything. And I’m s-”
Harry slipped his softening cock out of Draco and rolled onto his side.
at Harry (who nearly choked on the pasta in his mouth). It drove Harry wild, the usual confidence he knew in Draco paired with this newfound, far more amiable side of him.
“Malfoy, why the fuck is this relevant now?”
The blond’s pupils were blown wide, and a rosy shade had crept up his cheeks, contrasting his porcelain skin perfectly. He was
Harry thought to follow him for a second, to try and convince him he could be open about how he had felt, to offer to talk it all out. But he realised that perhaps enough boundaries set up for self-preservation had been crossed for one day.
Draco’s blush deepend to crimson red, high on his defined cheekbones.
“Don’t tell me you’re
Harry grinned, the bastard.
And he cut himself off with a loud moan as he felt Harry’s blunt tip stretch the rim of his hole. And he pushed back into it, relishing that burn that came with Harry being inside him. He wanted it, he wanted it so badly, and he let Harry know with every inch how
Draco only whined and whispered a shaky
“That’s it, Draco”, he groaned, “look at you. You’re doing so well.”
“You will be the only auror, yes, but you won’t be alone. We have received intel on some dark wizards hosting a black market for magical creatures. Of course the place is warded well with highly dangerous curses. I have got someone from the Curse Breakers’ department collaborating on this case. I’ve got all the relevant documents here. You will report to my office Monday morning at eight.”
He cocked his head sideways, studying Harry, who was catching his breath. Harry prayed he wouldn’t mention what he saw, and he didn’t.
“Do you want me to fuck you, hm?” he taunted, “is that why you’re all shy and flustered? Want my cock inside you, do you, Draco?”
Harry enjoyed watching Draco, he admired how he held himself- poised and elegant- and he loved it even more when he could make the affectation crumble. It was perhaps why he’d always let himself be provoked by him, why he’d retorted and dialled up the argument, however mundane it was. He didn’t particularly care about the matter, or even care about getting Draco to be angry. Harry simply wanted to see Draco without his mask, without the fake extravagance and pureblood bullshit.
“I’m sorry your godfather died, Harry”, Draco said, and for the first time in a while they made eye contact. Harry thanked him and they talked, conversation beginning to flow steadily; for a brief moment he thought back on Slughorn’s hourglass and how the sand would be in stasis right then.
“Harry Potter is dead!”
“Malfoy, what the fuck?”
(See the end of the chapter for
So Harry got up and retrieved the nearest piece of parchment and a quill. Sitting down at his desk, the parchment faintly illuminated only by the
Draco looked around the room, examining everything. Harry felt awkward for a minute, but soon realised it wasn’t scrutiny.
But somehow it felt right, them there, together, practising magic. It seemed to slowly bridge over the abyss of war that had separated them. It seemed to slowly mend some wounds of the war that weren’t visible.
His tone had changed. It was shakier, there was more disbelief, and for once, Ron heard Malfoy speak without that constant sneer plastered all over him. It was strange, so
It was already going a lot better than it had gone with Snape trying to teach Harry. But he still struggled and after a second or two of holding on he felt his mind pouring out as memories flashed in front of him.
Harry enjoyed watching Draco, he admired how he held himself- poised and elegant- and he loved it even more when he could make the affectation crumble. It was perhaps why he’d always let himself be provoked by him, why he’d retorted and dialled up the argument, however mundane it was. He didn’t particularly care about the matter, or even care about getting Draco to be angry. Harry simply wanted to see Draco without his mask, without the fake extravagance and pureblood bullshit.
Harry scoffed. Now this was the Draco he knew; yet he couldn’t help a small smile creeping up on his face.
“Gonna come inside you, Draco”, Harry moaned in his ear, “You’re so tight, Draco, I’m so fucking close”.
“You’re doing so well, Draco”, Harry murmured, his voice having dropped what felt like an entire octave to Draco. It was raspy and spoke in dulcet tones.
“Mother is sleeping”, he explained, “come with me”.
He was quieter around Ron and Hermione, although he brushed it off as fatigue when asked about it. It wasn’t like he could casually explain he had been round his former rival’s place a few times even though it wasn’t entirely necessary and he was thinking about him more than in sixth year.
A few years ago there had been a lot. When their rivalry bore no actual weight, before it was burdened with the lives of dozens. Draco had never understood why Potter would choose the poor Weasley boy over him, over power and pride. After all, Draco had been brought up to believe that those were the most important things in life and that they came with blood status. So he’d spent his childhood resenting Potter for rejecting his hand on his first day at Hogwarts, resenting him for rejecting the values he thought to be the only ones that mattered. He’d spent his childhood settling for negative attention from Potter, figuring it would be the only way he’d get it at all.
“Potter-”
And so Harry drew his wand once more and spoke the incantation.
Ron’s eyes widened, and he lowered his wand. Perhaps he wouldn’t need it after all…
feedback would be greatly appreciated!! i hope you guys are enjoying so far
Draco looked around the room, examining everything. Harry felt awkward for a minute, but soon realised it wasn’t scrutiny.
, yes, right there”, Draco moaned and pushed his hips down in an effort to get Harry to fuck him faster.
do let me know if there's any spelling mistakes or anything that seems weird to you!
in response. Harry grinned against his neck and bit down playfully, licking the spot afterwards.
Never in his life had Harry felt the way he did as they moved their lips together.
It was his eyes. Harry knew exactly how Malfoy’s eyes lit up when he broke a curse, how they glistened with fiery determination when he duelled or argued, he knew how they stared into the distance when he was deep in thought. He could decipher everything about Malfoy just through his grey eyes.
But now that he knew he would be spending at least a few days side-by-side with Draco Malfoy, Harry knew he’d have to remind himself to concentrate on his work rather than his colleague. That’s all they were, after all.
“Potter”, he said, because he couldn’t say anything else. What was there to say?
“When you come I want you to come on my cock”, he said, and kissed Draco again until his lips were plump and glistening and he was rutting up against Harry.
In return Potter had spoken for Narcissa and her son at their trial.
So Harry got up and retrieved the nearest piece of parchment and a quill. Sitting down at his desk, the parchment faintly illuminated only by the
“I’m going to use the spell on you now, Potter”, Draco warned him.
“Harry Potter is dead!”
In response, Harry pushed all three fingers back inside him, thrusting them. Malfoy was beside himself in pleasure; he grabbed the bedsheet and moaned, and when he’d caught his breath, all he could say was:
. His thoughts would drift away from his eyes and back to his body, how his muscles contracted and relaxed as he moved, how his knuckles would turn white from gripping his wand too hard sometimes, how his eyes would flutter shut when he concentrated. That’s when he would allow his hand to snake into his pants, cursing and muttering Malfoy’s name as he wanked.
“Don’t,
And so Harry drew his wand once more and spoke the incantation.
Narcissa nodded, and Draco too sat down in the third armchair of the room. It was the only furniture in the room; in fact, it was almost the only furniture in the entire manor.
Draco held onto Harry for dear life, his breath in synchrony with Harry’s thrusts.
“You’re aroused”, Malfoy breathed, barely loudly enough for Ron to hear. And then his breath hitched.
“Potter”, he said, because he couldn’t say anything else. What was there to say?
“Like that, Draco? Do you like that? Like feeling my cock deep inside you?”
He unbuckled Draco’s trousers.
Narcissa formed the beginning of a sentence, but burst into tears before anything coherent came out. She rushed out of the room, ashamed, overwhelmed.
“We were just the same, if you think about it”, Harry reflected, smiling at Draco’s last remark, “both fighting for our parents, what we believed to be the right side. I think that’s why we’re both here right now, don’t you? Because we understand each other.”
“Want to put me to the test, do you Draco?” he taunted, eyes narrowing.
Draco walked over, sitting down beside Harry on the bed.
“Fine”, he answered through gritten teeth, “now will you
Harry sat down on the bed, watching Draco in front of him, beginning to explain.
and leave it at that, to shut Potter out of his house and mind for eternity. But he couldn’t quite do it. Too many things were left unsaid and so he looked him in the eye and replied.
“No, I just”, he bit his lip and contemplated, “I come whenever I manage to reach that spot”.
“Someone like Voldemort”, Draco said so quietly it was almost a whisper, “and you mustn’t let that fear guide you”.
Draco sighed, sitting down beside him once more.
It felt like coming home.
“Is that why you invited me?”
“Ohhh
But that had been years ago. The war had divided them cruelly and Draco had stopped hoping to ever get on better terms with Potter even before he’d realised his feelings. That he was on his doorstep now threw a wrench in the works.
They talked about the divides in wizarding ideologies and beliefs, about how deeply they were rooted in wizard culture.
The table and Death Eaters dissolved and he saw himself, his face disfigured from Hermione’s stinging jinx, a flash and he was gone, it was only Lucius left in the room. He was shouting and Harry could only make out single words- failure, disappointment, shame- but he was furious, and when he raised his wand and muttered
“I’m sorry”, Draco finished, and Potter’s eyes flit back and forth between his own. They studied each other for a second, perhaps because they needed the familiarity.
“Potter”, Draco began, then hesitated again.
He circled one finger at Draco’s hole gingerly, pushing it in slowly, and Draco pushed his hips back onto it.
“I hope you like slightly-overdone asparagus”.
“Oh, Draco”, he sighed as they broke apart to breathe.
Harry kissed him again, hard and fast, and walking them into his bedroom. The backs of Draco’s knees hit the bed and he fell backwards onto it.
He snorted.
Harry nodded.
He was quieter around Ron and Hermione, although he brushed it off as fatigue when asked about it. It wasn’t like he could casually explain he had been round his former rival’s place a few times even though it wasn’t entirely necessary and he was thinking about him more than in sixth year.
curse.
“Let’s please get back to this project?”
“It’s hard the first few times, isn’t it?”
, Ron thought, but regretted his relief when Malfoy spoke up again and he realised he was stupid to think Malfoy would let go an opportunity to piss Harry off.
But for the first time, his confidence seemed to fade along with his composure, his face rapidly reddening.
So Potter followed him into the only other room with a place to sit down, Draco’s bedroom.
Rematerialising in front of him was the Room of Requirement, fire chasing up a pile of furniture, flames licking at tables and chairs, devouring everything in its heat. Then he saw Crabbe, clinging onto a chair desperately, losing his grip and falling into the fiendfyre. The last thing he saw was the fear in his eyes, the terrible, awful fear that Harry knew all too well, the type that only came from knowing you were about to die.
“I’m not done with you yet”, Harry continued, “I still want to touch you”. His kisses trailed down farther, and soon he spread Malfoy’s cheeks with his free hand.
Draco was taken aback a bit and about to ask why when it probably occurred to Potter that he should explain himself.
“Hm?”
They acknowledged each other’s presence with a curt nod and turned to Shacklebolt, who proceeded to explain the location of their portkey, which would be their method of travel both there and back.
Harry kissed the back of his neck, moving down slowly as he kissed each shoulder blade, his hand never leaving the blond’s arsecheek. Kisses trailed down Malfoy’s spine like butterfly touches, and he shuddered as he ground his hips into the bed.
“Is that why you invited me?”
“Is that why you came?”
“You don’t need to apologise. She’s like this most of the time”.
“Fuck”, he agreed, and cast a cleaning charm as Draco pulled the blanket from the sofa’s backrest over them.
That piqued his interest. It was usually Millsworth that would inform him of new cases, or his head of department if they were more high profile. But the minister himself? That was curious indeed.
“Narcissa”, he said, speaking softly, and Draco leaned slightly forwards involuntarily, “I want to thank you for saving my life”.
had not been part of his plan.
charm from his wand, he began to write.
“You have a fine arse, Malfoy-”
So he just refused to think about it at all.
, not that it was the first time that Harry was realising that. Flashing memories briefly reminded him of countless wanking fantasies, how many times he’d touched himself to the sight of Draco Malfoy, half hard and blushing, in front of him.
“Maybe I’ll turn it into a place for students to stay in during summer if they’re not welcome at home”, he mused, “I think Sirius would have liked that”. They both smiled, neither sure of how to continue until-
They were in Draco’s bedroom again, Harry not really making any improvement. His frustration grew until he snapped.
“I can’t live at Grimmauld Place”, Harry replied, thankful for the dim lighting because he blushed a little at Draco’s compliment. At Draco’s quizzical look, he explained how Grimmauld Place had belonged to Sirius, how it was dark and murky and carried the heavy weight of two wars.
He started pumping Draco’s cock in earnest, watching how it jumped and twitched in arousal at his every touch. Draco’s hips were still gyrating as he emitted small sounds with every stroke.
When he was done Draco looked as if nothing had happened; it was remarkable, Harry thought, thoroughly admiring how skilled Draco was, how he managed to look suave and unbothered despite fighting off an aggressive spell.
Silence.
Harry nipped at Draco’s earlobe as he began fucking him with his fingers.
“For crying out loud Malfoy, would you shut up if you saw it? Would that satisfy you?”
“You’re not protecting yourself correctly. You need to get a feel for the resistance you need to build up. Why don’t you-”
“Harry, please, faster”, he cried, “fuck me harder, please, I want it”.
Harry kissed him again, intensely, before lining his cock up with Draco’s hole.
, Harry, fuck”, Malfoy moaned as his neglected erection received the touch it had been deprived from. And it was touch from Harry Potter himself, his perhaps-not-so-secret crush of a few years, and known enemy. It was glorious, and it was
“With practically every woman in the Ministry fawning over you, I’m sure it wouldn’t be hard to convince someone to work with you”, Harry had said (or rather, half shouted) as he walked towards Malfoy.
Harry gripped Draco’s hips so hard he absentmindedly realised would be bruises the next day. It only made him grip harder, wanting to mark Draco as his. He angled his hips and hit Draco’s prostate with every relentless thrust of his hips.
“Do I smell Italian? Romantic”, Draco remarked, smirking. It wasn’t a smirk sourced in arrogance. It was a simple tease.
, right there-”
His obsession had grown- and been reciprocated- over the years and as he came to grow up way too quickly he learned of more nuanced feelings. He learned about crushes and found that the reason he never understood Crabbe’s interest in fit girls was because he didn’t fancy girls. And he’d come to understand that perhaps Goyle’s descriptions of his feelings regarding his female crush could be applicable to boys. And then he’d finally come to understand the reason behind his craving for Potter’s attention. And then he promptly pushed the thought aside because it made him feel nauseous.
“Like you’re one to talk”.
“Why are you here”, Draco stated more than asked, being far too surprised to even comment on Potter’s use of his first name. He tried not to stare at the man before him. He wore a clean, grey t-shirt that revealed the several bandages on his arms. Although he didn’t look as awfully malnourished, Potter didn’t look well. Draco felt stupid for thinking all would be well for Potter and his friends just because their side had won. A wave of empathy overcame him and it felt strange to stand across from him once again, yet neither insulting the other. They were both too tired.
“Potter, if you’d like I will let you in”, he finally offered.
“Shut it, Malfoy. You know very well you would beg to be fucked given the opportunity.”
“Merlin, you
It took Harry just a few seconds too long to grasp what Draco was referring to. But when he did, he rose to the challenge.
Decorating Draco’s neck with wonderful purple splotches, he didn’t stop the movement of his hips.
“I’m sorry”, Potter said immediately, turning to Draco, “I didn’t mean to-”
He leaned forwards until his mouth was next to Draco’s ear. He nipped at his earlobe playfully.
“I wanted to return your wand”, Potter finally answered, holding out Draco’s wand.
spell from those who can’t.”
Harry suddenly realised he’d felt more euphoric at Draco’s warm, soft hands on his face than he did making progress in Occlumency.
Draco took out his wand, pointing it at the man in front of him. Then he lowered it slightly and asked, “are you sure?”
I wanted to post two warnings for this chapter! In the middle of the chapter there is a slight bit of self harm but it doesn't go into detail, but I wanted to add this as a trigger warning so it didn't shock any of you. Another trigger warning I would like to add is near the end of the chapter there is reference to abuse. I have had abuse tagged for awhile on this story but I wanted to give all of you a heads up.
Harry stood up, panting. He looked around again, before looking her in the eyes. He nodded at her. She crossed her arms across her chest then, and slouched to the side.
“Where’s your gold Draco?” Pansy asked, gleaming in her diamonds and gold jewelry. Draco puffed up and smirked.
Harry somehow doubted that. Whenever he was left alone, his mind would retract into memories of his family, and many other things he didn’t want to think about. He didn’t know enough about the Prince to know what troubles he may have, but too long on your own can bring any bad thought to surface.
Suddenly something started glowing on Luna’s arm. Harry’s attention flew to the pale blue light that encircled her arm and he realized it was a bracelet. She had charmed it, from the look of it. He noticed her look toward his and Draco’s room, and it clicked for him that the blue light meant Draco was having dreams.
Harry looked up and Luna, and she smiled at him. He felt weird looking at her, knowing she touched Draco like that. Hermione and Ron had said there was nothing there, and why would Harry care anyway? Luna just didn’t seem like the type to get with a pure blooded prat like the prince. Harry liked Luna, he didn’t want her getting tainted, especially by a boy with sudden violent tendencies.
“So uh, about earlier,” Draco started, and Harry visibly winced, a minor ache in his head started to form at the thought. “I’m sorry.”
“I don’t have all day to listen to you insult me, Potter. Out with it.” Draco was glaring at him, arms crossed.
After they’d eaten and climbed back on their horses, they headed for the Parkinson castle. Luna had said they were halfway or a little more than halfway after their playfulness the night before. The sun had yet to rise when the left, so they followed the light of Draco’s dimly lit lantern. Luna had lit the candle with magic, so there was a small bulb of light radiating from a small glass box on Draco’s right stirrup.
It was cold in Draco’s armory, Harry noted. He needed new clothes, a jacket, some shoes that actually fit him. Draco had offered to take him out shopping but Harry didn’t know if he meant it or if it was part of Draco’s act. Harry felt his heart seize, honestly what was he expecting? He shouldn’t have expected anything. He has a roof over his head, meals, a bed, which was more than what he’d had some days back at home.
The downtown area of the city was very different from what he saw of the area downtown in the Malfoy’s kingdom. Though he didn’t get much of a look at it before he was taken in by the guards.
I appreciate any and all comments, hope you enjoyed. Stay safe out there guys.
“No, no that can’t be. You- oh god. Luna, no..” Harry whispered. His breath was short, and she stared at him, but this time she looked beyond panicked. “I’m- I’m from Azkaban!” Luna visibly winced at that name.
When he walked out of the room, he noticed that the afternoon had begun to slip into the evening. Draco was sitting at his desk, hunched over, leaning on his arms. Harry wondered if the boy was asleep, so he quickly cleaned the rest of Draco’s room, which wasn’t hard. Draco kept his room spotless, there was hardly any dust.
He hadn’t told anyone, not Ron, not Hermione, not Ginny, but it felt right to tell Malfoy in that moment.
He thought about their hug, how he’d wanted nothing more in that moment than to be there for Malfoy, how he had just
“Can you teach me Occlumency?”
A strange feeling settled in the pit of his stomach; it was a weird concoction of anticipation, excitement, and nervousness. He’d invited Draco over on an impulse, simply because he’d felt the need to keep the conversation going, not wanting it- and by extension their correspondence and interaction- to fade away.
”s and “
There was a knock on the door.
“Want me to add another, Draco? Think you’re ready for it?”
By the time he knocked on Draco’s door again, the statement was settled deep in his mind, and he began to understand what Draco had meant when he said to build an impenetrable wall of determination, not fear.
” escaped his mouth.
Their eyes met, and Harry’s fiery green determination was met with Draco’s glistening grey contemplation. Harry searched Draco’s eyes for doubt, fear perhaps, something that was making him hold back.
, Draco. Are you embarrassed to wank in front of me? Go on, Draco. I can see how hard you are for me. Show me how much you enjoy touching yourself for me.”
He saw the Manor, the great conference table, Professor Burbage in the centre, lifeless, a single tear trickling down her cold cheek, then Nagini’s jaw unhinging to devour her, with sharp, unforgiving teeth.
“I’m sorry your godfather died, Harry”, Draco said, and for the first time in a while they made eye contact. Harry thanked him and they talked, conversation beginning to flow steadily; for a brief moment he thought back on Slughorn’s hourglass and how the sand would be in stasis right then.
“Harry”, Draco half-moaned half-said, “please”.
Of course Malfoy was there already.
Arriving at an altered King’s Cross station, knowing he was dead. Seeing the bloodied, deformed creature on the ground-
“Their best Curse Breaker! Draco Malfoy, of course.”
It was warm and soft and wonderful and Draco gasped at their initial touch, his hands rapidly finding their way back to Harry’s face again.
He moaned Draco’s name as he came deep inside him before collapsing onto him.
“Fuck, you can come Draco, you’ve been so good for me”, Harry groaned as he snapped his hips into Draco again and again, “you’re so fucking tight, wanna see you come”.
It was why he’d looked into his mind.
He suddenly realised he didn’t want him to go, he didn’t want the night to end.
“Does that feel good?” he asked. He didn’t need an answer, but it sent a spark of electricity straight to his heart and cock when he heard Draco whine a small
The last part got stuck in his throat and Draco choked a little bit, collecting himself, willing the tears in his eyes back. He didn’t have to get this bloody emotional over one sentence and he sure as hell didn’t want to pour out his heart and soul to Potter, who had only come to return his wand because it was the right thing to do.
They were in Draco’s bedroom again, Harry not really making any improvement. His frustration grew until he snapped.
it felt.
And it wouldn’t open with
“You owe me nothing”, Harry interrupted him sternly, “Let’s try again”.
There it was again. Those things Malfoy would say, the obvious flirtations that were too obvious to be meant seriously, the ones where Harry sometimes wasn’t sure whether Malfoy was trying to get him to be angry or flustered. It frustrated him endlessly.
“I love it”, Draco said quietly, as if more to himself than to Harry.
Harry could always decipher Malfoy, though his facial expression always emanated nonchalance and professionalism. Malfoy had always been good at controlling his body, moving and talking with an elegance that made him almost ethereal. It made many women in the ministry giggle when he talked, many stare when he trained, and Harry was well aware that he wasn’t the only one who thought him to be fascinating. But it wasn’t his body that made Harry so interested, his body wasn’t what Harry knew better than anything.
“Fuck”, Draco stated.
Harry licked again, then moved his mouth farther up, where he began kissing and nibbling at Malfoy’s collarbone. It was carved so neatly into his pale skin, it was
Draco obliged and once they were both naked, Draco sprawled out before Harry, he stilled, admiring the man who laid before him.
“We caught the dark wizards, we secured their ware, I don’t know what more you want”, Harry retorted, stepping towards Malfoy now, “Perhaps if you weren’t so bloody stuck up you’d be able to see we completed the fucking assignment”.
Previously sitting on opposite ends of the sofa, they faced each other properly, now only a foot or so apart from each other.
Backing away from the door as cautiously as he could, Ron resumed his trip to the library. The last thing he wanted is to hear his best friend shag.
Shacklebolt smiled.
the smut happens
It was about two in the morning when his owl returned, a new piece of parchment attached. Harry’s heart skipped a beat, and he scolded himself for it. He wasn’t a bloody first year receiving their first love letter.
“And since no one can know we are working this case, we cannot risk Muggles seeing you either. We have provided you with a charmed tent in which you will stay while you work this case”, Shacklebolt finished his explanation.
“Please, Harry, I need you inside me. You have no idea how much I’ve fantasised about you fucking me so hard I pass out, how much I’ve touched myself to the thought of your cock and feeling it, how badly I want you to take me right now, I-”
Harry was sure he could come like this, just from watching Draco be completely debauched, just from touching him, but that would be a mission for another day.
“Draco”, Harry said again, trying to at least get his attention from afar. Draco turned his head slightly, his ear facing Harry.
When Draco lowered his wand, Harry was overcome with a feeling of euphoria.
“It’s not cursed or anything. I just wanted to return it and-”
Harry looked around the room. Draco’s four poster bed was in the centre of his room, headboard bordering the wall, and his wardrobe beside it. Other than that, there was nothing but a trunk that was open on the floor, half under his bed. Harry could make out several pictures of Draco and his friends- friends he had lost in the war- as well as his Slytherin robe and a few textbooks. It looked as if he had just come home from the last day of school, as if the war had never happened and he had simply left all his furniture at Hogwarts for some reason. Maybe it was intentional.
“Potter-”, he starts, “don’t tell anyone. Please”. Harry nods back and with a loud crack, Malfoy is gone.
It ate him up on the inside, wanting so badly to be faithful to his name and his parents while knowing it wasn’t right. The only thing he could do was feign uncertainty of Potter’s identity when he was right there, right where Draco was stood in that moment, not two months later even though it felt like a lifetime. Because looking into Potter’s eyes had solidified what he’d been trying to suppress; that he didn’t want him to die. Not only that, he cared. He cared about Harry Potter and he wanted him to defeat the Dark Lord.
“Mr Potter”, she said, just as surprised as Draco had been, her voice rough and raspy as though she had not spoken in weeks.
“We need to check the cave to tally the creatures they’ve got stored in there”, Malfoy yelled as he realised Harry had walked back to the tent to retrieve the Portkey.
Handing an impressively large file (with a big red “confidential” stamp, of course) to Harry, Shacklebolt wished Harry a good weekend and made his way out of his office. As Harry packed away the file into his bag and let the excitement of a special case wash over him, he realised he’d forgotten to ask something. He rushed to the door, Shacklebolt only a few paces ahead, and asked, “Who exactly will I be working with?”
. Need. More”, Malfoy managed to say past moans. Harry hummed in appreciation, which only made the other cry out and push his hips back.
He walked in long, quick strides, the hard heel of his shoe clicking on the ground with every step, the sound echoing through the empty hallways of the cold and desolate manor. From his back pocket he grabbed his wand- just in case. Draco couldn’t pretend to be a victim of the war, but its aftermath hadn’t been easy on what was left of his family. Once the proudest pureblood supremacists, the Malfoys were reduced to a whimsical duo of mother and son, their only objective survival.
”, Draco whined, and he looked on the edge of both orgasm and anger outburst. And then Harry decided he enjoyed riling Draco up like this infinitely more than picking an argument with him.
Yet Draco was still surprised when he opened the door to be faced with none other than Potter himself.
He opened the door and was faced with Draco. Contrary to his expectations, he wasn’t overdressed at all, wearing an emerald green turtleneck and simple black trousers.
“I’d explain to you that I prefer to spend my money on things that are fun, but I don’t feel like explaining the concept of fun tonight”, Harry retorted.
“I mean, unless you don’t want to or-”
Harry smiled, which only seemed to anger him more.
In fact, he cried out loud when Harry found
the smirk in his voice; clearly it had aggravated Harry.
“I didn’t hear you deny my claim”.
strange that he was sure this was a trap. There had to be a catch, there always was with Malfoy. It was one of the things that made him- Ron hated admitting it- interesting, in his own way. He never quite said exactly what he was thinking, he was cautious beyond anyone else, despite his cocky behaviour and stupidly childish endavours at Hogwarts. His actions weren’t, but his speech most certainly was always conceited.
Harry placed his other hand under Draco’s back and lifted him to get a better angle, kissing the corner of his mouth as he twisted and angled his fingers before-
He wasn’t sure how to feel about it.
Draco gasped then winced visibly and took several steps back in fear.
at Harry (who nearly choked on the pasta in his mouth). It drove Harry wild, the usual confidence he knew in Draco paired with this newfound, far more amiable side of him.
, just like the rest of Malfoy.
And as he slowly driften to sleep, neither of them were planning on ever letting go.
With a million thoughts racing through his head and a weird mixture of feelings settled in his stomach, Harry floo’d into the Ministry on Monday morning at 7:50 sharp and headed straight to Shacklebolt’s office.
“In the Room of Requirement”, Potter began, and the horrid memories of the fire flashed in Draco’s mind, “I asked why you didn’t identify me. I’ve come to realise that, if you don’t want to tell me, that’s fine. But I want to thank you, regardless of the reason you did it for”.
Harry explains to Shacklebolt that Malfoy was injured and has apparated to St. Mungo’s. No questions were asked and Harry went home.
Harry thinks he looks like he’s about to shatter into a million pieces so he closes the gap between their bodies and pulls him into an embrace. He doesn’t know what else to do, so he holds Draco close as he shakes and cries quietly into his shoulder.
They were grinding against each other in earnest, and Harry was determined not to initiate the next step until Draco asked for it.
They ate mostly in comfortable silence, making occasional small talk. And then Draco would make a remark, too obvious to be a come-on, but said with too much of a blush to be a joke. One time he’d even had the audacity to
Harry’s eyes widened as he felt his face get hot.
Harry categorically refused to acknowledge this. He knew he would be going down a dangerous path lusting after his former rival and he knew how easily it could lead to more than that because Harry had found himself respecting and outright admiring Malfoy’s character the more he worked with him. And he also knew that Draco Malfoy was dating Pansy Parkinson and Harry didn’t feel like dealing with unrequited feelings, especially when they were as obstinate as this.
, the other boy’s cheeks flushing, his hair messier than usual.
”, Harry pleaded, feeling completely drained within a matter of seconds. He was certain he would have collapsed had he not been sitting down in the first place. He expected Draco to yell, to tell him to focus, tell him that he wasn’t good enough, but Draco spoke as softly as he had before.
And so he raised his wand and whispered, “
“Wandless and wordless”, Draco panted, “Bastard.”
Harry tried to fight against his eyes fluttering shut, but as he looked up at Draco, who was already drifting off himself, he decided that an overdue talk about how they felt could wait a little longer.
, you need to banish it!”
“I need to talk to your mother. I need to thank her as well”, he said, as if that explained anything.
“-thank you for what you did”, Potter finished his sentence at the same time as Draco interrupted him.
Draco’s eyes rolled back and his mouth hung open as a string of almost unintelligible curses and moans spilled from his mouth.
“Fuck”, he borderline sobbed at the sudden loss. Harry turned him around gently, so tenderly that one would think Draco was made of porcelain, like his frame could shatter in Harry’s hands. He caressed Draco’s flushed cheeks for a moment, before kissing him, and slowly that primal arousal, that intense need to fuck him returned.
“Mhm”, Harry responded.
He’d broken up with Ginny for good shortly after the war had ended, quickly realising that it had separated them significantly. He still enjoyed her friendship, and thought it was ultimately better for both of them to have the freedom to experiment and try new things. At seventeen, a life-long commitment to his high school romance wasn’t right for either of them. Ever since he hadn’t properly dated, preferring to fulfil his sexual needs with occasional one night stands sourced from muggle bars. Ultimately he enjoyed those experiences, both with men and women, and he often found the best part to be the fact that he was regarded simply as an ordinary bloke. In the muggle world, he wasn’t The Chosen One or The Boy who Lived, he was just Harry.
“Is that why you came?”
He reached out his hand and from his bedroom he heard a few things rattle and crash- he couldn’t care less. A bottle of lube came flying towards him right into his hand.
“I need to talk to your mother. I need to thank her as well”, he said, as if that explained anything.
And then he took his cock in his hand and gave it a tentative stroke. It jumped in his hand and he moaned, stroking again. And again. And again, and soon he was wanking himself in earnest in front of Harry, who watched in awe as he held the base of his own cock.
It was all Draco had to hear.
Draco and Narcissa had thrown out everything but their beds, wardrobes, and the three armchairs of the living room, along with two chairs and a table to eat on in that same room. It had brought back too many memories, too many awful flashbacks every time they saw the large conference table on which Professor Burbage had been violently tortured and murdered, every time they saw the bed Voldemort had slept in, the cabinets that reminded them of the Vanishing cabinet. Everything was just wrong and they tried helplessly to erase every last memory of the war by burning down a pyre of everything they didn’t absolutely need.
Harry, now released, stupefied his dueller before he could cast
“Funnily enough, Potter, I’d figured that much out myself”, Malfoy retorted. Harry rolled his eyes. If one thing hadn’t changed at all since Hogwarts, it was Malfoy's comebacks. He seemed to have a snappy wisecrack for everything Harry said and it drove him positively insane sometimes. And yet he couldn’t help but enjoy the kick he got out of ‘fighting’ with him. Perhaps that was part of what made Malfoy so intoxicating.
“Mr Potter”, she said, just as surprised as Draco had been, her voice rough and raspy as though she had not spoken in weeks.
sounds he was making, how he was writhing under Harry’s touch and how he moaned and whined and begged, it was glorious. So he gave him what he wanted. Now fucking three fingers relentlessly into Malfoy, Harry thought that he might come just from watching Malfoy in ecstasy.
His relationship with Draco had been complicated, to say the least. Draco. That’s who he was. When the war had ended Harry had decided that Draco Malfoy was just Draco to him. His childhood rival. Not a cruel Death Eater, not someone who could murder his own headmaster, murder his friends or his godfather. Draco Malfoy became Draco when he lowered his wand on the Astronomy tower in sixth year, when he refused to identify Harry at Malfoy Manor in seventh. And now they were here, in Draco’s bedroom, in a surreal situation he could not have conjured in his strangest fever dreams.
Speaking of the devil.
And he wanted to see Draco laugh. He wanted to see him giggle so hard he would hold his sides and couldn’t breathe. He wanted to see Draco be fascinated, be excited by new things he discovered and old things he was passionate about. He wanted to see Draco feel, see him as he truly was.
“I did it because I had realised I was on the wrong side. And I cared, Potter, I still do. About everything. And I’m s-”
“Someone like Voldemort”, Draco said so quietly it was almost a whisper, “and you mustn’t let that fear guide you”.
“Just because I’m not an overly confident Gryffindor that gets off on walking right into the arms of danger doesn’t mean I’m a bitch”, Malfoy’s voice retorted calmly, but Ron could
“Mother is sleeping”, he explained, “come with me”.
“Thank you. For everything”. And because he knew Draco wouldn’t speak, he did as he said and left the manor.
Malfoy groaned as Harry kneaded it with one hand, pushing his cheeks apart.
“-gonna make you come so hard”, Harry finished his sentence.
“Fuck!” Draco’s back had arched off the bed, his eyes screwed shut as his breathing grew more shallow. Harry didn’t stop; as a matter of fact, he only went faster, relentlessly pounding Draco until he was a moaning mess, Harry keeping as quiet as possible so he could hear every whimper, every “
, the food”, Harry cursed, sprinting back to the kitchen to salvage their meal.
” as the chest’s lock clicks shut and he stands in front of Draco again. Draco who says nothing, the tears still fresh and wet in his eyes like blood from a deep cut. Draco who was confident minutes ago, who couldn’t be startled by any curse in the world, stands smaller and shakier than anyone.
“Here”, he continued, disregarding Harry’s lack of response, and handed him a bottle of wine that looked like it had cost more than every drink Harry had ever had combined.
They were outnumbered, and while Harry was duelling the largest and most powerful of the three he failed to notice another wizard behind him, pointing his wand right at Harry before casting
And then the scene disappeared and Harry was back at Hogwarts, an army of Death Eaters standing before him, Voldemort leading them to face the fighters on Hogwarts’ side- on his side- and he realised Draco was amongst them. Voldemort spoke, and it was just as Harry had remembered: arrogant, his voice drenched in the illusion of victory.
As he stood up he caught a glimpse out of the corner of his eye of red hair. There was a familiar sense in the air and he could have sworn that he heard a light bubbling laughter come from the direction in which the deer ran. Tears pricked at the back of his eyes as he thought of his mother, running through the woods with him as a child. He wondered if maybe the deer was the afterlife of his mother passing through.
Harry watched out of the corner of his eye as Luna turned around and began to change, her back facing him. Draco sent him a side glare and he looked away from the Princess. When Luna was done dressing she faced them and began to set up her cot. She spelled different things out of her pack, including what looked like a book. Harry sat down next to her on his bed. Draco began to move out of the corner of Harry’s eye. He began to peel his shirt off in front of the fire, grabbing his night clothes from his pack. Harry’s eyes lingered on the blonde’s smooth skin, the firelight licked the edges of his ribs and along the edges of his spine. There was a light around his hair, and the flames flickered light amongst the shadows. Harry swallowed thickly as he found himself wanting Draco to face him, and looked away when Draco pulled his night shirt over his head.
It was Pansy who answered him, “Why? Scared of touching a girl? You’ll never find a girl that way darling.” The Princesses giggled.
Harry felt immediate relief and smiled at her.
Draco crossed his arms and sighed through his nose. Harry took the moment to look him up and down, he noticed the blonde had changed. He was dressed down, in black slacks and a green t-shirt. There was a small snake embroidered onto the front breast pocket of the shirt. Harry groaned inwardly at noticing how well the shirt fit Draco. He tore his gaze away from Draco's clothing to his own. He was wearing the extra clothing Ron gave him, they were baggy and long. What a sight he must be, especially compared to the blonde. A question popped into his head and he looked over at Draco.
“I need to borrow him for a moment, Draco. I’ll have him back before you miss him.”
“Hello, Pansy.”
“Bloody hell, just look at the difference! There's so much dust on the floor! You must not have cleaned well enough the first time. Might as well clean it again,” Draco grinned. Harry wanted to throttle him, but got back down onto his knees and began scrubbing the floor in different areas.
Harry’s face burned at the thought.
Harry had been following her instruction this entire time, neither boy making a sound as she taught. He wondered how Draco would’ve taught him, probably with a harsher tone, and an impatient voice. He walked over to wear he’d placed the shoes just hours before, and grabbed a nice pair of black boots. Draco put his shoes on himself.
Harry took one last look out the window, and the girl had disappeared from where she was, the horse she had been tending to was gone as well. He started walking towards Draco, who turned and led Harry up the stairs.
“That was Draco Malfoy, Prince Draco Malfoy.” Hermione whispered. “He’s vile, and cruel, and his last servant committed suicide just two weeks after she was assigned to him. He loves no one, he’s never even shown interest in the princesses who visit. The only people he shows any sort of love or care for, are his parents. Every scar I have, Ron has, any of the other servants? They’re all from him. He’s a sadistic bastard, and I fear for any servant who has to care for him.”
Harry walked into the room further, finding it just the slightest different than his and Draco’s. Her chest was larger, and she seemed to have an open walk in closet to hang her coats. He folded his hands together and cleared his throat. She jumped a little  and looked up from her journal for a moment.
From what he remembered about his hometown, the servants were older, his mother had worked as a servant as a young girl with her sister, as far as Harry knew his aunt was still somewhere in the kingdom with his uncle and cousin. He wasn’t sure if they were still alive after the attacks.
“You look sharp Potter. You’ve found some clothes that fit you I hope?” Draco looked at the tents around them. He had his hands on his hips, which stretched the ties of his green shirt and opened the shirt a little. He looked handsome.
Harry turned around and stared wide-eyed at Hermione, whose back was blistering and scabbing over with dried blood from the torture Draco put her through. Hermione who was sobbing silently out of absolute fear for the boy she tried so desperately to save. Ron held her tightly, and he shook his head in sorrow for Harry.
Harry grabbed a smooth black jacket and walked behind Draco to begin dressing him.
Harry’s heart dropped into his stomach as he looked at his new friends knocked out on the floor, he wanted to cry. He couldn’t do anything to help them. He walked over to them, no longer petrified. He was stopped by a strong hand around his neck.
Draco clicked his tongue at her, and shot her a look that Harry didn’t quite understand.
Harry shut the door and walked away from it, still slightly flushed in embarrassment. He wondered if Draco found that outfit fit for a prince, or if he’d find his own outfit in his drawers. He sighed and looked around the hallway, before looking down the stairs, to see Hermione walking up the stairs to him. He smiled at her.
Harry looked up at Draco in surprise. His stomach grumbled and he glanced down at the floor in shame. Draco tapped his boot on the floor impatiently.
They walked together, out to the hay bails and the manure pile, which was hidden in a sort of overhang. Luna grabbed a shovel and started moving muck into the pile. Harry looked up and around at the grassy fields, his eyes landed on an old shed like barn, it wasn’t painted. He wandered down the path until it disappeared into the weeds. He stood at the end of the path and stared down at the old shed. He let out a deep sigh and looked back up at the castle. There was a slight movement in one of the high windows, like curtains fluttering. He scanned his eyes back down the castle, to the large barn, and then to the girl shoveling muck.
~*~*~
“Potter requested to give me a massage. It was quite relaxing, working all the tense muscles, I don't know why I didn’t ask it if him before.” Harry glowed under the praise, and sent a small smile in Draco direction from behind his cup.

“I have such horrid secondhand embarrassment for you, Potter.” Draco’s voice was heavy, he wasn’t looking at the servant. He was staring straight ahead, so Harry looked to see what he was looking at. There was another girl inside the room, she was folding sheets on the bed.
“My name is Neville by the way! It was nice to meet you, Harry!” Neville yelled from down the hall. Harry threw a hand up as a slight wave in response, and then practically galloped up the stairs to the third floor.
Hermione blushed, and Ron, who stood in the hall, shot him a glare. Harry immediately rose his hands up and laughed sheepishly. “I meant the three of us.”
Hermione sighed, and removed the blanket from around her. “I’m tired now. Both of you go to bed. Harry I hope you sleep well, we have a lot of training to do tomorrow.” Hermione glared at the boys, before slowly removing herself from Ron’s bed. Ron gently held her hand so that she could steady herself and get into her own bed. He tossed the blanket at her when she was under her sheets.
“No,” Draco whimpered, “Please no.”
They were led down a hallway opposite the Prince’s quarters, and the change in artistry on the walls began to dissipate. Harry got a chill down his spine, and wanted to curl in on himself due to the aura that wafted down the hallway. Luna had her arms crossed across her chest, and was looking around at the plain painted walls.
“Ron asked me the same thing. I don’t like her like that. I think she’s really cool and a neat girl but I don’t like her in a romantic way. I think she’s a great friend.” Harry clarified, and met Draco’s gaze when he said it. There looked to be a faint blush on Draco’s cheeks but Harry couldn’t see for certain. It must have been a trick of the light, but Harry wondered if it were a dusted blush on the Prince’s face, what it meant? He decided not to dwell on the feelings rising through his chest at the thought.
Sorry this chapter is a little bit late. I had a busy week. As always the characters are not mine they belong to J.K. Rowling.
Harry scrambled to his feet, and ran after Draco, not without missing the chuckled “coward” from behind him. His spirits dropped even further. He paused by the door Draco had pushed open, and glanced over to Ron and Hermione.
Will that change now, that maybe Draco heard him? Will Draco stop suspecting that he had feelings for Luna? He meant to make it clear that he was not interested in her in that way, he prefers her as a friend. Will Draco avoid him now? Will the Prince not allow Harry to change him? Will he-
“I never said I was a good person,” Draco spat in Harry’s face. “I just said I wasn’t a monster.”
The dining hall was full of dancers and maids and servants and the cooks bringing out food to surround the grand table. The largest most beautiful chairs were made for the castle owners, who sat in them dressed in their most expensive attire. Draco stiffened, and Harry hovered next to him.  The princesses were sat in the middle of the table. There was a girl there that Harry hadn’t met yet, Astoria sat in the middle of the girls. She looked beautiful, Harry thought Draco and Astoria would make a charming couple. The thought seemed strange to him.
He sat in the barber’s chair and saw his reflection for the first time in weeks. The barber left the small room to grab his utensils, and Harry stared in horror at his hollow face. It was as if his filth had sunken into his bones, and no matter how many washes he had he’d always be dirty. He wanted to cry. “Draco was right, who would want me when I look like this?”
“Stop following me, and stop asking so many bloody questions! Why not just ask Ron who I am when he wakes up?” Harry shouted. The boy flinched and took a step back, Harry took this as a chance to escape the boy. He ran down the hall to the stairs.
Thank you for your patience! If you don't follow my Instagram you should! I talk about updates and let you know whats going on in my life and I sometimes post tidbits of my computer or iPad screen. I recently bought a house with my fiance, so I've been working with him on that for a bit which made me slower to update. (The lady who owned the house before smoked 3+ cartons a week - oof). I hope to have the next chapter out as soon as possible, and I thank you in advance for your patience!
“It’s amazing isn’t it?” Luna laughed beside him. Her horse ran beside his. “The wind in your hair feels amazing!”
Draco looked thoughtful, “That’s different to what you said this morning isn’t it?”
“I’m sorry.” Harry muttered. She reached over and patted his knee. The touch brought back memories of his own. Memories of his mother.
“Is there anything I can help you with?” The girl shoved a bunch of potatoes into his arms and he scrambled to hold them all.
The reply came roughly a day later.
He said the beginning of a sentence, but Harry didn’t hear it because behind him the entrance to the cave exploded with the deafening sound of a
his vision went black.
They talked about the war, about the things and people they had lost.
“I wanted to return your wand”, Potter finally answered, holding out Draco’s wand.
Harry wanted to tease him; he wanted to give a retort and make Malfoy say it, say that he was a bottom and wanted Harry’s cock inside him, but Malfoy lying there, flushed and his arse on full display,
He came back balancing two plates of pasta and two wine glasses and with a crooked smile.
He wasn’t sure what he was expecting when he opened the door. Certainly not his father, that much was sure. Draco knew he wouldn’t be returning from Azkaban in a considerable amount of years, if he even survived it at all. He knew his mother hoped he would simply show up on their doorstep, even if she knew it was practically impossible.
Harry snorted at the remark and reluctantly backtracked into his office, offering Shacklebolt a seat.
“Thank you. For everything”. And because he knew Draco wouldn’t speak, he did as he said and left the manor.
He couldn’t see Harry’s reaction, which was quite daunting. Harry laughed too, and to Malfoy’s surprise, leaned down to kiss his neck before whispering, “knew you’d fingered yourself before. You’re a bottom, Draco Malfoy”. A blush spread over Malfoy’s pale body.
Harry knew what he meant and took Draco’s wrists, pinning both of them above his head with one of his hands.
He felt a hand being placed on his shoulder, and Harry moved his thumb over Malfoy’s finely carved shoulderblade.
They talked about the war, about the things and people they had lost.
They made eye contact again and for a second all dominance in Harry’s voice, his eyes, his behaviour was gone, and he asked, “this okay?”
Slowly he pushed in the head, teasing Draco’s entrance by moving it in and out a few times, intent on pushing Draco over an edge.
“Please,
It was about two in the morning when his owl returned, a new piece of parchment attached. Harry’s heart skipped a beat, and he scolded himself for it. He wasn’t a bloody first year receiving their first love letter.
“Thought you said you knew how to have fun, Malfoy”, Harry said, speaking slowly and making a point to lean against the wall with his hands on either side of Malfoy’s head, essentially trapping him. Harry smirked, enjoying every second of watching Malfoy fight desperately to keep his composure.
“Eager, are we?” Draco teased, and when Harry took his leaking cock in his hand in response, he moaned and his head dropped back.
Until Harry Potter showed up on Draco’s doorstep for the second time.
So he said, “I should go”.
“Draco?”
But then he did stop.
Harry was stuck in a trance for a few seconds, watching Draco’s movements, hypnotised. Then he snapped back to reality as he realised he was about to come, so he held onto Draco’s back and manoeuvred them so Draco was on his back again, Harry above him.
“Why don’t you try the spell on me, so you can feel the resistance I’m talking about. Okay?”
He had just been on his way to the library- Seamus Finnigan was making a right racket in his dorm, where Ron had originally gone to study while Harry worked on his project with Malfoy, with Merlin-knows-whatever-spell-he-was-mastering-now. Stopping in his tracks, he cocked his head to verify what he thought he had just heard.
By the time he knocked on Draco’s door again, the statement was settled deep in his mind, and he began to understand what Draco had meant when he said to build an impenetrable wall of determination, not fear.
They looked each other into the eye, Draco waiting just a fraction of a second too long to say something.
He wanted to take a long shower.
, Harry almost let himself think.
Having snapped out of his trance, Harry swiftly leaned forwards and pushed his tongue past the ring of muscle and into Malfoy’s hole. He saw him desperately grab the sheets, his eyes shut as his parted mouth uttered little “
“You need to concentrate”, Draco began, speaking slowly and purposefully.
“My apologies, Malfoy, I’d forgotten you’re dating that stupid bint Parkinson”, Harry retorted, walking closer until they were face-to-face, daring Malfoy to take a step back and admit defeat.
Harry moved his hand, placing it behind Malfoy’s neck to pull him in close. Their lips were mere millimetres from touching. He felt the other’s hot breath against his lips, and he was sure that if he looked down he would see their cocks as close to touching as their lips were.
Draco hated it, how much control Harry had over him now, how helpless he was, being fucked so hard he probably wouldn’t be able to walk for two days. But it was so
Harry’s apartment was small- quaint, as he liked to say. The walls were decorated with pictures of his friends that waved and smiled at him, but other than that, everything was muggle. The dining room was not much larger than the kitchen, the table just big enough to fit two people sitting at it. Accordingly, he owned exactly two chairs, two pairs of cutlery, two of everything.
“Yesyesyes, fuck, Harry I’m gonna come I’m-”
“You’re afraid”, he simply continued, “of someone like-”
“-thank you for what you did”, Potter finished his sentence at the same time as Draco interrupted him.
“Potter, if you’d like I will let you in”, he finally offered.
“You gonna come soon?” he mumbled against his lips, “I’m so close. Fuck, Draco, you’re so tight. You have no idea what you do to me. Been thinking about this for so long, your perfect hole clenched tight around my hard cock, fucking you until you have none of your smart words left, until you can’t remember your own name.”
It took Harry just a few seconds too long to grasp what Draco was referring to. But when he did, he rose to the challenge.
His relationship with Draco had been complicated, to say the least. Draco. That’s who he was. When the war had ended Harry had decided that Draco Malfoy was just Draco to him. His childhood rival. Not a cruel Death Eater, not someone who could murder his own headmaster, murder his friends or his godfather. Draco Malfoy became Draco when he lowered his wand on the Astronomy tower in sixth year, when he refused to identify Harry at Malfoy Manor in seventh. And now they were here, in Draco’s bedroom, in a surreal situation he could not have conjured in his strangest fever dreams.
”, Harry began, “
Malfoy didn’t answer. He pushed forwards against Harry, their lips slotting together as they fell into a hungry kiss. Harry, despite having initiated the closeness, gave a small yelp of surprise at Malfoy’s enthusiasm, then pushed back into the kiss. He wrapped his spare hand around the blond’s waist, and pulled him closer.
It was something he couldn’t ignore anymore. Not now that the waves of war had crashed over them, and all that remained was the rhythmic ebb and flow of life's ups and downs. He sought out Draco’s attention because he wanted to feel noticed by him, he wanted to spend time with him.
And then Harry lifted Draco’s hips just a little more until his cock hit his prostate dead-on with every thrust, and Draco positively lost his mind.
“I did it”. Harry grinned.
“Point is, Potter, I know you can do this, even if it takes work. I’ll help you get there. It’s the least I can do after-”
He walked in long, quick strides, the hard heel of his shoe clicking on the ground with every step, the sound echoing through the empty hallways of the cold and desolate manor. From his back pocket he grabbed his wand- just in case. Draco couldn’t pretend to be a victim of the war, but its aftermath hadn’t been easy on what was left of his family. Once the proudest pureblood supremacists, the Malfoys were reduced to a whimsical duo of mother and son, their only objective survival.
“Sorry I didn’t meet your fucking expectations!” Harry yelled at Malfoy, who was still furious despite his back being pressed against the hallway wall.
“Oh”, Draco exhaled, like all the air was pushed out of his lungs. He breathed heavily, his mouth hanging open as he began rocking his hips back and forth.
“I can’t live at Grimmauld Place”, Harry replied, thankful for the dim lighting because he blushed a little at Draco’s compliment. At Draco’s quizzical look, he explained how Grimmauld Place had belonged to Sirius, how it was dark and murky and carried the heavy weight of two wars.
his hands were. Perhaps this was the one thing about Potter that his father would
“Go on then”, Harry said, opening his arms to gesture at himself.
“I got a fucking lecture from my boss, who said we should have called for backup. Who said we should have put up more wards. Guess who was in charge of those two things. I don’t care how fucking arrogant you are in your own cases but not if you jeopardise my career with it!”
Harry had remained quiet, letting Draco talk. Harry felt strangely relaxed around the blonde. He nodded at Draco when Draco asked if he'd like a small tour now. Draco nodded and walked down towards the kitchen. Harry followed after him quickly, keeping up behind the taller.
He watched in amazement as Luna grabbed the giant satchel of Draco’s clothing and stuffed it into the tiny carry on bag attached to the saddle of the horse.
Draco nodded. “We should be nearing their castle soon. Are you prepared to act in your best behavior Potter? Some of the maids and servants in the Parkinson’s castle will keep you on your toes. They won’t hesitate to harm you if you let your guard down.” His voice was light, and it sounded like there was a hint of nervousness in it.
He couldn’t hold himself back from gently caressing the bruise and leaning forward to rest his forehead in the crook of Draco’s neck. He just wanted to give the smallest of comforts to his Prince. Draco breathed out deeply only for his breath to catch when he tried to breathe back in. Harry’s hands were splayed on the small of Draco’s back.
“Don’t make me repeat myself you twat. You heard me, I’m not saying it again.” Draco suddenly found the laces on his shirt far more interesting than Harry’s face. Harry’s mouth was dry, so he swallowed and coughed.
Harry opened and closed his mouth searching for an answer. He decided to end the conversation, and they just stared at each other for awhile. She glared at him, and returned to caring for the horses.
“You’re lucky my father approves of your mouth. Perhaps eventually I will as well,” Pansy flirted. Harry felt very uncomfortable suddenly, and shifted in his seat. Draco climbed back up onto Ulysses and gestured to the gates. He ignored her comment about his mouth, Harry noticed.
“What outfit did you choose for the dance?” Draco leaned forward and looked at Harry. He seemed interested, so Harry decided to tease him a little.
Wowza, this chapter is 30 pages long.
He knew his boots were perfectly fine. He wouldn’t trade them for the world, his father had lined them with the fur of an animal he’d caught. They’d smelled like death for a week, but he had loved the initial softness of them. To this day he loved the warmth they brang. They were a dark brown, which matched many of the things he owned. They matched the pants he wore, even the black pants didn’t look too terrible with them. He kept the brown pants on and tried on the red long sleeved shirt.
Harry recoiled. He gripped his shirt in his hands, Draco had been watching him change that day. He’d seen the scars and old bruises from the attacks on his village. He hated his body, hated how small he was, hated how frail he looked. Draco had heard him the night before, his sentence proved that without a shadow of a doubt and he’d used it against him. Draco had slammed the nail on the head of his insecurities.
Harry gasped when he saw Hermione’s back. He looked at Ron, and back at Hermione. Her back was scarred over from what looked like whipping from previous punishments. Her back was bloodied, and the marks looked deep. He watched as Ron wiped the rag over the wounds again, and Hermione tensed. He noticed the slight lingering of Ron’s fingers on her skin, and looked back up at Ron.
“You’re dismissed, I’ll come get you if I need you.” He heard Draco say. Harry nodded to the blank space in front of him and walked out of Draco’s room. He shut the door with a light click, and walked down the hall to the stairs. He wanted to go outside, to see the gardens, and perhaps the blonde girl.
This chapter came out to be 9,758 words.
They were in a small clearing of the woods, Harry hadn’t noticed the thick brush until Hedwig took off. He was new to riding, and nearly took his head off a couple of times from hanging branches and vines.
Hermione cleared her throat when she was dressed. “Well now, let’s have no more sadness. Harry I would like for us to talk, I want us to get to know each other. Ron too, we could stay up and talk for a bit before bed.” She smiled over at Ron, who nodded. The sun had long since gone down over the horizon, and the moon was high in the sky.
Harry’s breath caught in his throat, as he stared at her. His eyes were wide, and his body froze.
“Tell Cedric to create a beautiful feast for Harry Potter, he has not eaten in a long while and he will be of no use to me if he dies of starvation.” Draco ordered. Harry couldn’t believe his ears as he watched Draco order the elf.
“Set it on the table.” Draco spoke, his voice was tired, strained. Harry did as he was told, and turned back around to see Draco raise from the bed, and immediately stumble over. Harry ran to him, and reached out to steady him but the look in Draco's eyes reminded him of what he'd said the day before. He removed his hands from Draco's proximity.
“Help me carry these to the table please.” She turned around to grab onions off the table she’d been peeling them on, and went to set them on the cutting board. “Well don’t just stand there, if you’re going to help get on with it.”
“Only squirrels? Were the woods inactive today? I was sure they would be full of life.” Luna hummed. She grabbed the bow and arrow from Draco. Harry watched as she shrunk the weapons with her wand and tucked them into a pouch on the side of the prince’s saddle. He shifted his weight and grabbed one of the squirrels Draco had set next to the rekindled fire. He sat on the log he’d sat on the night before and grabbed a knife.
“You made such a mess. Mop it all up.” Draco gestured to the area. Harry looked around, and it looked clean. He wasn't about to question the prince, so he left the room and grabbed a bucket and rag from a closet in the hall.
~*~*~
Harry followed Luna out of the room when she started towards the door. Harry didn’t miss the look of confusion on Draco’s face as he laid back down in bed.
He thought.
Harry pondered to himself too long, as he realized he could no longer see the two blondes in front of him. A slight panic shuffled through his body and he glanced around in the dark of the night. He double tapped Hedwig’s sides and took off in the direction he assumed the royals went. Pain shot through his rib cage as his muscles shifted with the movement from his horse. He took a big breath in to calm the muscles. He could see the dapple speckle of Luna’s horse and sped up to catch up with her. He gripped the horn like his life depended on it. He strode past her on accident, the wind running through his hair, it was thrilling. He laughed. He’d never felt so alive.
