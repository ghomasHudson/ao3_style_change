, spreading the word about the Saviour and the Death Eater? I’ll be fair. It was inevitable that every last one of our friends would be informed sooner or later. Got to remind myself not to pick up any newspaper or magazine again for the next few months.
The oldest Malfoy on the parchment—and Harry has to get on his knees and crawl forward a bit to see the upper end of the scroll—is one Armand Malfoy who was born 992 in Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, France and died 1099 in Malfoy Manor, Wiltshire. “Wait,” Harry says, agitated, because he needs a moment to take in the information that Draco can track his ancestry back to the tenth century. That Malfoy Manor seems to be just as old even though Harry has no idea whether a house can get that old or if it was rebuilt at some point or not, or-
, then he had to be his friend’s straight-faced Harry because even the slightest burst of emotions he let on- it just felt like they’ve all been right all along with their worried glances, and their hushed words that they thought he didn’t hear. “
Draco nodded, his cheeks pink. He was biting his bottom lip, one of his anxiety tells. He allowed me to lead him over to the bed and he carefully climbed on. The Mediwizard looked down at him, giving him a moment to get comfortable. “If you could lift up your shirt for me,” he said, “and wriggle down your trousers, so I can reach your lower stomach, that would be excellent.”
“And she must’ve lived in Malfoy Manor as a young girl,” Harry realises, and Draco nods. In contrast to earlier, the idea is rather fascinating now than overwhelming.
“Harry,” Draco repeated, knowing that he sounded rather foolish but unable to help himself. In his defence, he had drunk two shots of whisky on an empty belly.
“Bloody hell,” Harry mutters, rushing past her, the towel wrapped around his hips. There’s a bloke right outside the bathroom, getting in Harry’s way, and Harry loses it, demanding to know who the fuck he is, and what he’s even doing here in his,
Draco hadn’t been at all well. His poorliness had begun the day after Oliver’s party, with a stomach ache, and sickness, and a migraine that wouldn’t shift. Nothing helped. He tried anti-nausea potions, Muggle and magic, but he might as well have been throwing his Galleons into the toilet.
, and I won’t ever leave you. Is that what you need, Potter? A bloody reason other than taking care of yourself?”
Draco turned and he angled his head under the racing water, closing his eyes as I found his lips. The two of us kissed, our bodies slick and sliding over each other’s, Draco’s round belly pressed snug against my flat one. I was the first to break our kiss.
The idea is completely hilarious, at least in retrospect because it did feel like mobbing rather than pranks. On the other hand, Harry gets why other students or especially Draco might have hated him, with his constant meddling and Dumbledore’s favouritism. Indeed, several professor’s favouritism if he is truthful.
It’d be difficult to hide the bump for much longer. Harry hadn’t asked what Draco was planning to do once the bump arrived, and that was a relief, because he wouldn’t have been able to give him an answer. The future was still opaque.
Draco’s eyes go blissfully vacant for a second before he focuses on Harry with a novel kind of desperate need that wasn’t there before. “Do it,” he says urgently. “Please.”
A faint hint of a bass accompanies Harry’s lift ride. He watches the digits of the display climb from zero to seven. Draco was right, Harry thinks, about moving to a small town, busy with people starting their lives and cafés occupied by spectacled eggheads clad in tweed jackets. It’s better than the literal cabin in the woods they had before, secluded from the world, just the two of them. Harry doesn’t like the fact that it was too much, too intense. He wanted Draco to want nothing but him.
“It was confusing,” Draco says, sounding blank. His eyes are directed at the box of chocolate, but he doesn’t look like he’s contemplating eating one. “All I ever believed in was loyalty and family. He didn’t tell me that you told the truth, Harry. About what happened at the end of the Triwizarding Tournament. I didn’t believe a word when you said that my father was there for the . . . resurrection. He said what nonsense that was even though he kept on going on, saying how times would change now and how he sensed the return of the Dark Lord. Well, that certainly held true when he-“ Draco takes a deep breath. “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t talk about this.”
Nick comes back into the living room, smiling about something without looking at them. Despite himself, Harry takes a step away from Tarquin, instantly feeling ridiculous.
I wouldn’t even have been mad if he had Polyjuiced himself to have sex with me. I understand that people have all kinds of weird kinks, and if he must get off on that, I won’t be the one to judge him. Even though I don’t see why he didn’t repeat that, why he didn’t hook up with me again as someone else. Did he
The best course of action would have been to leave Draco be, but when have I ever been good at taking the best course of action? Instead, I crouched down, and watched what my friend was doing. He was leafing through a big thick Healer coursebook. It was called the Gulliver’s Guide to Magical Physiology, and as I watched, Draco leafed through the pages impatiently and quickly. I couldn’t see the subject of what he was reading, but whatever was written down didn’t suit him at all. He scoffed at the page, slammed the book shut, and put it back on the shelf.
I’m utterly beside myself all the time. Both Pansy and Blaise keep telling me how tired and pale I look. I couldn’t even focus on hanging all the garlands in the ballroom for the Yule Charity Ball that Pansy is organising. It felt like I had to double the effort to wield even a spark of magic. She watched the disaster, thin-lipped and with her eyebrows raised, until she dismissed me with the comment that I was doing more damage than I was helping.
Malfoy grins, looking very much happy and relieved, and his nose is crumpling up again. Some strands of his white hair fall into his eyes. “You are alright. You’re . . . I always knew we’d get along, Potter. Always. And I bet-“ Malfoy stops, sitting up straighter as though he had the most intriguing idea, eyes blank for a second before they find Harry’s again. “Can I call you Harry?”
For future reference: average this week is 98 pounds per hour so far. Many blowjobs, often enough penetrative sex. One-off with this rich (or dumb, or both) bloke excluded.
Under tears, he tried to sell me the story that he had never planned any of it. That time had just slipped away and every time he intended to tell me, he was too scared of losing me. “I love you,” Harry even said, vehemently trying to take my hand. “I love you and the plum, and I couldn’t bear the idea that you might leave me.” And then he pleaded with me to stay. As if I had anywhere to go! As if I wasn’t in constant need of his magic! I’m not going anywhere. He’ll pay, in both the practical and the metaphorical sense of the word. I won’t free him from his responsibilities.
Ginny and Cormac, his Prophet colleagues, rolled their eyes, well used to Draco’s mischief-making. This wasn’t the first time he’d flirted while on the job.
“I mean, it’s only natural. You mend old heirlooms—who would have them if not the old pureblood families, right?”
Spending time with Ron that day feels familiar and refreshingly special all the same, and when Harry gets home, feeling like he ought to tell Draco all about it, he doesn’t feel sad but happy; happy that he has someone that he wants to share all these thoughts with. The joy of sharing happiness
“But he left us,” Harry emphasised. “We’ve been so close and he just- We shouldn’t have been so nice to him. I’m not sure he deserves it after- He just went away like we haven’t been through so much together. Through
He would have liked to drink his weight in champagne but he couldn’t touch a drop. Draco wasn’t a monster. The bump was coming to ruin his life, but he wouldn’t deliberately hurt them. They didn’t ask for this life, and he wanted to be kinder to them than Fitzgerald had been to him.
Draco avoids everybody’s gazes, trying with occlumency when more memories of the three bubble on the surface, gnawing at the edges of his sanity. More shouts and crying, the noise of an electric Muggle razor right by a child’s ear, a cruel desire to make him fit in with everybody else. Fears.
Between them, Harry and he had finished the bottle, and Draco reasoned he ought to Floo home before he could do himself or anyone else more harm. He’d have to dig out a phial of hangover curative from his bathroom cabinet before he went to bed, otherwise he’d be every bit as useless as a chocolate broomstick for hours when tomorrow came.
I’m not sure what I’d tell him. But he should know that he’s having a child (if either of us or both make it through the ordeal), and if he’s not interested in raising them, he should at least send me some money as is the custom with separated parents. It’s honestly all I can ask for. The one thing
I dried the pair of us with a charm, and then the two of us padded through to their bedroom.  “Lay down,” I said, as he propped a couple of pillows behind Draco’s shoulders. “
“I mean it, I’m not here,” he gestures, including the bar and her and himself, struggling with words, “because of
Fitzgerald didn’t care that he’d not listened to Draco’s pleas. He didn’t care that he’d violated Draco with his fingers and with his penis. Fitzgerald didn’t care that he’d made Draco leave a job that he loved. He didn’t care that he’d destroyed the longest friendship of Draco’s life, or that the thought of visiting wizarding London left Draco feeling ill. He didn’t care that he’d left Draco pregnant. Fitzgerald didn’t believe he was a rapist. He’d had a good time.
When I suggested dancing – half in jest, for Draco had glanced at the dancing couples more than once – he readily agreed. It felt fantastic to have my friend in my arms, it felt like we should have spent our whole lives dancing. Our bodies fit together like two pieces of a puzzle, and I watched Draco glance at my lips as we swayed together. If I hadn't known better, I’d have thought he wanted to kiss me.
With a grin on his face, Malfoy takes a moment to carefully select one of the fancy pralines he laid out for them. Some of them are covered in a metallic shimmer, others are topped with nuts or dried fruit. He takes a very dark, square chocolate with coarse-grained salt on top, biting off half of the tiny treat. He frowns at the cross-section of the chocolate pinched between his thumb and index. “I
I’m sure my aunt would cut ties with me, and Lady Zabini might throw me out. I actually wonder if Harry would stay friendly with me. He seems a bit twee sometimes. I wouldn’t be surprised if he had thought my occupation more of a dating service than actual fucking. But he’s so friendly, so good at heart. What’s it to me if he’s a tad naïve? I bet he wouldn’t judge me.
It’s useless. He has nowhere to go. What would Ron and Hermione even say? What would he tell them after—how long? Six years? When did these six years even happen?—after six years of absence. And he knows,
There’s another pause, and suddenly delighted laughter. “Oh, I understand. But that wouldn’t keep a young lad like you from fathering a heir.”
“It’s partly because you’re pregnant,” the git replied. But then he demurred with a self-deprecating laugh, “But trust me, I’m everything but a good person.”
Harry would have shown Pansy the door and never forgiven her, had that have been Draco’s wish. That wasn’t what Draco wanted, though. Pansy had been Draco’s best friend since they were tiny and in spite of everything, Draco missed her. “It won’t,” Draco answered. “Nothing could. I can’t hide behind the walls of Grimmauld Place forever, Harry.” He looked down at Daisy, sleeping blissfully, innocent as her name. “I’d like to talk to her.”
"In this very moment," Draco agrees, unblinking eyes on Harry. He simultaneously looks hopeful and perfectly at home with the prospect of having his heart crushed. Like nothing could throw him off kilter. Harry doesn't want him to feel this way, wants him to be passionate about Harry and get angry at him and make love to him and crumple his nose with delighted laughter. Whether the irritation he's feeling is directed at Draco, at himself, or at the world- Harry has no idea.
Draco shrugged, not wanting to lie anymore. He regretted fibbing, but now it was too late. Part of him considered casting a Memory Charm, but Draco knew that he wasn’t too skilled in that department. He’d never really mastered the
He finds Carol who already starts glancing at her watch because it’s getting late and she apparently has work in the morning. “You really ought to tell me your secret at some point, Potter. Spending all this money without a job. You’re not the old money type.” Harry is fairly certain that by
Harry was wearing the scratchy claret robes of an Auror, and he was carrying a bundle of court statements tied with string. “Draco,” Harry said, his voice warm and rich in the dignified atmosphere. “I knew I’d seen you around in the Wizengamot, but I’ve never managed to corner you and say hello.” He nodded to the statements that he’d dropped on the table. “I was supposed to give evidence in Court Three – you know, the Apothecary robbery? – but they’ve put the case back an hour, so I’ve got a bit of free time. Fancy joining me for a cup of tea?”
Too much beer and too little water later, Harry’s body still feels ecstatic and restless with energy and raw magic, so raw that he’s surprised that no one notices that there is something is odd about his presence. But then the bloke from earlier is gone and there’s Tarquin, only Tarquin, who looks at him with beautiful brown eyes. He’s pushing Harry against the wall for a fierce kiss, he’s pacing the bedroom, his hands all over himself, grimacing, and groaning.
“Mine is yours,” Harry replies automatically. His familiar fingers slip under the hem of my trousers, playing with the straps of the sock garters that—I know too well—Harry can never get enough of. “Even if I did change my mind, it’d be my fault completely. I offered it to you, now, didn’t I?”
Harry doesn’t want to go back to St Mungo’s. He doesn't want to go back to their clean white walls and their concerned, patronising faces. He needs to do better, though. Harry needs to prove himself to the Healers.
“But I’m sure the better part of the parents just wants an easy way to contact their children while they’re at school. Especially for the Muggleborn wixen—it’s hard for their parents to just accept that their children are meant to study and be so secluded from them. They are dependent on their children writing to them so that they can reply by return owl. It’s very impractical,” Hermione says. Harry realises that, back in Hogwarts, he never wondered much about Hermione’s parents or how they communicated. It’s not like Harry was in a similar predicament; there certainly wasn’t one thing the Dursleys would have wanted to write to him about.
his glamour the moment he closes the door behind him, and when Draco, without any metal protective wear this time, steps through the archway into the small space behind the till, there’s a delighted gleam to his eyes and to the way he says, “Potter.” Guilt strikes Harry upon being greeted so amiably, but he tries to pay no attention to the feeling while Draco takes a  minute to finish something in his workshop.
That it’s not even the point whether Andromeda will forgive him or not because he himself can’t forgive him anyway. That it’s unbearable to think of Teddy, and how he’s in his third year now, and that’s the exact same year in which Harry found out about Sirius. That he doesn’t know how to contact Ron or Hermione because, at some point, he has to talk to them and apologise for leaving them without a word. That he dreams about Dumbledore and Remus and Tonks thinking that he’s a huge disappointment, and that, sometimes, he used to wish he’d stayed dead because he was so, so alone in this world.
I love her, but sometimes she can be a bit much for me. I don’t at all feel like participating in all sorts of events these days. I always thought that I’d grow up to be the heart of every posh party and look at me now! I’d much rather enjoy a drink with just one or two of my closest friends than share the gossip with a dozen self-important sycophants. The topics one discusses in a smaller circle are just so much more meaningful; none of that superficial small talk nonsense.
“So it’s a camera as well?” Draco asks incredulously. “How in Salazar’s name does this nifty thing work?”
“I’ve heard you,” Harry repeated, his voice sounding more like his own. “I promise you, Draco, promise on my parent’s honour. On my mum and dad’s sacrifice. I promise that I’ve listened to you.”
They are in Malfoy Manor. Months ago they started clearing out things that were beyond repair and mending everything that seemed worth their time and love. Harry detected the cursed objects with ease and sometimes, was even able to break the curses after reading up on them in the impossibly huge library. He finds it calming to repaint things. He often does that while Draco is working on intricate charms and transfigurations.
Seeing Mother in Dartmore was something entirely else. Her eyes glinted rather cheekily when she told me the latest gossip. She almost doesn’t sound scandalised anymore when talking about all the lesbian affairs going on. I’d go as far as to say that having to spend time with “the common people” has been quite an enriching experience for her.
But how wrong he was, Harry thinks when he remembers the night following the battle. He woke long after darkness had fallen over a castle like a Stasis. The debris and destruction were devoid of screams and spells, making Harry feel like walking a museum. The Great Hall, a crypt for that night, mourned with a peaceful gravity, a hundred stars in their silent vigil above the dead.
And he starts to wonder whether he’s empathising with someone he once was or whether the feeling has always been there. That, perhaps, is why it’s been so hard to make out, for perhaps it is ever-present.
“We could try to restore it,” Harry finds himself suggesting, not meaning the Doxy-infested curtains but rather the whole Manor. He can’t get over the gleam in Draco’s eyes while he talks about these things, and if there’s anything he can do to keep it there, Harry will do it.
“Take off my clothes,” Draco said as soon as they were seated on the soft mattress, surrounded by plush cushions and their cosy quilts.
Before he leaves the office of the goblin in charge of his financial business, he politely asks to go to the bathroom and refresh the glamour he had to
Carol’s voice trails off, and Harry takes a bracing breath. He’s feeling dizzy, slightly nauseous, and perhaps he’s starting a cold or something, because he keeps on shuddering along to bittersweet pulses of migraine that seize his head every so often, despite being wrapped in a perfectly warm jumper that he’s even secretly charmed to stay warm.
“Your story. You frequent this bar quite regularly if I may say so. Trotting along with the aspiring youngsters of our branch. Yet still, there’s something rather different about you. That certain
A fission of magic washes over Harry, and then Draco is on top of him, between his thighs, and Harry can’t keep his hands off his narrow torso.
and having all his attention directed at himself, Harry feels so loved and in love with him that every inch of air between them feels like too much.
Back to spreading the news to my friends. I had a very long chat with Astoria that ended with her Flooing over when I couldn’t kneel in front of the fireplace anymore. She and Harry got along rather splendidly. I think they haven’t really known each other before, but they share an incorrigible enthusiasm about biscuits.
With Father’s birthday around the corner, I’m thinking of him more than usual. I would like to tell him about my life. That I’m finally making ends meet. He won’t understand in that delirious state he’s in, but perhaps my smile will mean one less worry for him. Aunt Andromeda swore that before her delirious mother-in-law passed away, she had one bright moment and thanked her for all the visits that she paid. I wonder if that’s how it will be for me and Father.
“Yes,” a woman agrees. “See, Carol- my friend Carol, she’s a close friend. Says he must be new money or something, but the darling is so modest and secretive, isn’t that right? But Potter is what she calls him.”
it for the first time to be precise. He’s used to it. He ignores the mild nausea that comes with the charm, the cold sweat forming in his neck, and a faint, tingly feeling that emanates in his chest and crawls into his brain. He doesn’t bother with fixing the jabbed vein, not with Malfoy watching him so intently.
“Not me,” Harry says, his temple resting on two fingers. He sits slouched into the corner of the settee, affectionate eyes on me. He can sense my interest. Not that I was trying to hide it, but he knows me better than I know myself. And just as visceral, I know what Harry is going to say before he opens his mouth again. But I let him say it. “I’ve had enough prophecies.”
But what if Tarquin needs his help? But that’s paranoid. That’s exactly that kind of paranoia he felt in the months after the war, seeing an escaped Death Eater lurking in every other shadow. There are hundreds of people here; Tarquin isn’t involved in whatever is going on in there. Still, he needs to fetch him. The police are hardly going to arrest every single one of them—almost everyone here is on drugs, and the police will surely know that—but still, he should leave or keep his head down. He won’t leave without Tarquin. Harry should simply Apparate inside, sort this out, find Tarquin, and have the Ministry and the Obliviators deal with the aftermath. But then he’d be seen and talked to and-
That’s even more infuriating. He’s way too sober for this. “Well,” Harry says through gritted teeth, repeatedly reaching for the dainty handle of his teacup before retreating from the hot porcelain. “Well, and I’d be bloody dead without you,” he grinds out.
He felt traitorous tears leak as the spell was cast, and he watched the glittering magic coalesce into the form of a baby. Draco saw tiny limbs wiggling and he saw their face in profile. The bump existed, and they would be born in just over eight week’s time.
Harry wakes, his muscles sore, his head buzzing with a pressing pain and a low beat that’s playing somewhere nearby. Light catches in thick curtains, painting the room a dim orange. Next to him, he finds the curve of a bare back, spine a gracious line and shoulder blades angular and lithe, attractive. Too devoid of freckles to be Ginny- no, Ginny was ages ago, right? Too skinny for Tarquin. Oh, but he is gone anyway. A stranger, Harry concludes.
You’ll read my journal from the day you were born, and you’ll know how very, very loved you are. I don’t know what your life will be like, but I do know this. They’ll never be a single day where you’re not the shining star at the very centre of it. I know that I’m going to make mistakes – Merlin, I only have to look back over the last nine months to see a parade of them – but I'm going to do my best.
. Or you,” I add after a smile, thinking that it’s the same anyway. The smile is returned, faint but there, and Harry toasts me with his glass as he sips his whisky and I chug down the potion.
Macintosh read Draco’s statement back to him at the end of their interview, and the two agreed on the facts of Draco’s accusation: that, on the 23rd August 2002, Stuart Fitzgerald had raped him.
I nodded my apologies to Ron and led Draco away to a park bench that had been placed on the edge of the garden. Draco seemed happy enough to be away from the crowd.
Harry extends his arm on the backrest, grazing the soft fabric stretching over Draco’s shoulder with tingly fingers.
“What are you on about, Potter?” Draco asks while some wand movements follow to prepare their plates. “I also brought this lager. It’s locally brewed, and I thought you might like it. I’ll even accept the humiliation of drinking something that has a big, fat red lion plastered across the tag. The owner—and brewer—is such a Gryffindor, it’s like she never really left Hogwarts.”
“I won’t. You’ve got my word.” He gestured towards the entrance. “Shall I go in first?” he asked. “Then you can see me. You can watch my every move and I promise not to come close. I’m not going to leave you though. I meant what I said back at the Manor, Draco. I’m worried about you.”
Sometimes I think it’d be brilliant to be clever, to be wordy the way Hermione is. To have the perfect adjectives slip off your tongue for every occasion. If I was, then perhaps I could do my evening – my night – with Draco justice. I’ve collected my memories in a phial so that they’ll never diminish or degrade, and I’ve locked them in my bedside cabinet.
Harry had left when Draco had asked him to, even though he obviously hadn’t wanted to. Harry had kept his distance, and he hadn’t touched Draco after he’d promised not to. Harry had listened to him, and respected his boundaries and that was more than anybody else in his life had done. Harry had deferred to his wishes.
the joke. Except that, well, you certainly can. But when you’re . . . thinking too much of what people think of you, it isn’t easy to just let go and laugh along.”
The other children used to talk a lot about what Santa Claus might bring them, be it the latest game, or a brand-new bicycle. I was always wise enough to keep my mouth shut. I wasn’t foolish enough to think there'd be anything in my stocking apart from hard work.
“I used to . . .,” Draco began to say, but his eyes were fixated on Harry’s crotch, and he seemed to forget that he was speaking at all. The moment Draco’s eyes focused, looking up into Harry’s own, he looked very much like the Draco Harry used to know; the Draco who knew what he wanted and just went for it, no matter what—admittedly, the scope of ruthlessness changed with his adolescence. But with his grey, beautiful eyes piercing Harry’s, Draco said, “I’m jerking you off.”
Malfoy doesn’t manage to stifle a huffed laugh himself. He takes off his metal apron and it flies into an open cupboard, stuffed with several other fabrics and metals and leathers, puts down his gloves on the counter and opens a door behind a thing that looks like an old-fashioned till. “After you, Harry,” he says, gesturing for Harry to go first.
Sometimes people were vicious about Draco, but he didn’t give much of a shit. They called him a cockslut, or said that Draco was living proof that all Malfoys were good for was taking prick. Sometimes people said that Draco had saved his family by sucking the cock of He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.
The afternoon was a pleasant one. Teddy and Draco played a few rounds of Exploding Snap, and then we ate a light lunch of sandwiches and more cake. By the end of our food, Draco was visibly weary, and – after he had yawned for a second time – was dispatched to the settee with me by his side. Andi left us to sit with Teddy while she set Cleaning Charms.
More memories, but slower than before. Loneliness. Darkness. The feeling of not belonging, of being unwanted.
-Death Eater, he reminds himself. Malfoy doesn’t seem hostile, and neither is he behaving suspiciously friendly. Also, Malfoy took the same stuff. Even cared for their needs with water and all. It’s fine. This is all completely fine.
For all the dire responsibilities I had to face over the past years, things are starting to look much brighter. The horizon is clearing up a bit and there isn't a cloud in the sky, only a scarlet shower of banknotes. Never in my life would I have thought that 1) I would have worried about money in my twenties, 2) that I would ever learn how the Muggle paper money works, and 3) that pleasuring men for money wouldn’t make my life a complete disaster. It’s not what I had pictured for me, and it’s certainly not what my parents had planned out.
But I got exactly the reaction I was looking to find. A soft little whimper, muffled by our kiss, when I squeezed his bum. After the sound, though, I felt his posture stiffen a bit, and he wanted to lean out of the kiss. I didn’t let him though. I couldn’t abide the idea that the kiss would end like this. So I whispered, “Let’s get more comfortable…,” and I guided him to the bed, feeling endlessly nervous that he would reject me once we broke the kiss; that he would come to his senses. But Potter let it happen.
,” Draco grinds out, catching Harry’s wrist, and Harry let’s go of Draco’s clenching bottom. He rises to his knees until his thighs line up with Draco’s.
And so, I decided to. Instead of confessing my dark deed, I told my friend quite truthfully – and shyly – that he was handsome. He nodded to my compliment and took my hand in his.
Draco enjoyed the train ride, though he made sure to moan about it as we were waiting at Euston Station. Apparition and Flooing were both more efficient, apparently, but they are both out of bounds in Draco’s current condition.
“Come over to Phoenix next week,” I said to Draco, nodding to the drawing. “We’ve got a new model – the MoonStar 3000 – and I think it’d be perfect for a certain little boy’s Christmas present. The altitude and speed settings can be fixed with a nifty little charm, one designed by yours truly.”
Cormac was the first to speak. He bounded over. “Is it true?” he shouted, getting in too close to Draco’s face. His face was contorted, and ugly with anger. “You lied to the Aurors? Told them a bunch of bollocks about Stuart Fitzgerald
Back to bed, but he tosses and turns. Thoughts inevitably drift to long lost times, another life he once had but lost, full of hurt and peril and unfulfilled expectations. Harry wants to feel better, wants to forget the inescapable flash of half-remembered people and places and voices in his mind, wants to come off this menacing feeling of his blood pumping against his tightened throat, a sickening reminder of bodily functions that still haven’t surrendered him. He needs to think straight, he decides. After a line of coke, he slumps on the couch, head buried in a velvety cushion that reeks of cigarette smoke and aggressive detergent.
After a short silence, a new song picks up, a Nirvana song, and the subject switches to Draco feeling bereft of 90s grunge as a wizard growing up in that era without any access to Muggle music at the time. “I mean, I’m quite certain that Kurt Cobain would have been able to solve all my anger issues, just like that,” Draco says, snipping his fingers and gestures to the wireless in the corner. “You see-” he stops, licking his lips, eyes blank. “You see, I’ve been thinking about this. That there wasn’t a good outlet for us. Well, except Quidditch maybe. But I would’ve been a lot more composed with something like grunge in my life. Or at least some art other than these boring portraits, chewing your bloody ears off, for Merlin’s sake.”
The ability to backtrack Apparition is not that easy a one to master, but it is one of the merits of Auror training. Harry Apparates, finding the general region from where he had Disapparated from Draco Malfoy’s home a few months ago with ease, though he won’t burst into the confines of his house or flat like a brute.
“Not at the weekend, no,” Harry answered, the lines around his eyes crinkling in amusement. “And I’ll tell you what Malfoy. Since I find myself at a loose end, why don’t you tell me what’s making you look so glum?” Hasty as always, Harry didn’t pause before he was turning in his seat and signalling to the barman. “We’ll have the bottle, Tom,” Harry said, with all the happy arrogance of a wizard that rarely heard the word no. “Just put it on my tab.”
This is all that American bloke’s fault. When Aunty mentioned that Harry had a date recently, I was reminded of the one thought that I shun from my consciousness very much like my worst nightmares: that Harry Potter is as bent as a broken wand.
“I drank,” Harry says as though he’s compelled to say the truth. “I drank and then I cut two lines of coke, and while doing the second, I was already regretting it. But that didn’t make me stop.”
But when Tarquin stops kissing him, his thoughts about fucking are quickly forgotten. Tarquin talks about his parents who own a huge company that distributes several brands that Harry doesn’t know but sounds like they could be to do with vehicles or some kind of heavy machinery. It sounds like a big deal, and Harry tries to understand how Tarquin’s train of thought goes from there, to the day his aunt had gifted him a book by Karl Marx, and how that had changed his views on capitalism at such a young age. “I saw it in them, everything that’s wrong with consumerism. I mean-“ Tarquin braces himself on his elbows where they lie on the ground, and Harry, unnoticed, refreshes the Warming Charm on their coats. Tarquin looks pale and agitated in the greying light of dawn. “I mean, for them, it’s always about
I felt my breath hitch: Draco’s magic felt like fingertips on my skin, and his action felt perilously close to erotic. I managed to croak out a greeting, though my voice sounded thick, throaty and entirely ludicrous. Luckily, neither Draco nor the rest of the company seemed to notice my very particular behaviour. Andi kissed Draco on the cheek in greeting, told him he looked more handsome every day, and left to rustle up some tea and biscuits.
“Give me a minute,” Harry replies. He strips off his pants and rolls on his back while still fisting his prick.
“There’s been some development,” Draco explains. “Phones and several other devices work with a certain shield applied. It’s still ludicrously costly to have that setup at home, but they use computers now in the Ministry. Makes less of a mess than all these notes and documents in the record archives.”
Theo was the first to regain the ability to speak. That didn’t surprise Draco in the slightest. Nott had always been too loquacious for his own good, and he’d only gotten worse since shacking up with Pansy. Their smug coupledom was enough to put anyone off their dinner.
Merlin, but the two Quidditch journalists disagreed on everything under the sun. Today’s row was over a copy of a non-magical newspaper, called the
“You sobered me up,” Harry points out, leaning back into the settee. He assumes that they both know it will just take a few minutes to kick in. He glimpses at Malfoy, seated right next to him now. This is so surreal. Beyond surreal. Their eyes meet. He looks . . . somehow the same as he used to but in a different way. He’s still skinny, pale and pointy, and still has the silky-white Malfoy hair which is long on the top and short on the sides. Naturally, he isn’t in a Slytherin uniform, and he also doesn’t wear a black suit, but a simple black dress shirt and these Muggle jeans that for some reason can't help but attract Harry’s gaze.
The alarm rings. Draco turns the ringing sound off with a practised, dismissive gesture of his hand. When he scoots backwards again, it’s the swell of his arse against Harry’s morning wood. Harry can’t help but let out a pleased groan.
“Exactly.” Teddy nods vehemently. “I’ve heard that they are always in search of Aurors with good glamour skills for undercover investigations. I wouldn’t need a glamour so there’ll be no spell that would wear off after a while or would be discovered by a Legilimens.”
Besides, Draco hadn’t come here to get blotto. He wanted to enjoy the main event, rather than pass out halfway through. He turned his body so that it was facing Fitzgerald’s, and he took the bottle from his hand. “I think,” Draco said, “that there are better things you could be doing with your lips.”
, Draco pointed out—that it looks like the most natural thing for them to wake up and start moving about. Their lifeless eyes are somewhat creepy though.
“I wouldn’t know,” Harry answers. He scoots closer to Draco until their sides align and their temples lean against one another. A warm, pleasant feeling floods his body. “I usually just drop my two bags and live out of them. But it just seems a tad unnecessary, considering that we’re surrounded with posh Cushion-Charmed furniture.”
took away my power but I’m allowed to take it back. This decision is the most important one of my life, and it has to be the right one for both of us.”
. I didn’t mean to be rude or anything. I just don’t like walking around the wizarding world as . . . me.”
“You can try,” Harry mumbles against Draco’s neck, not quite done molesting him. He runs his hands through his hair which seems to shine even whiter in between the earthy colours, not mentioning that the perfectly sleek strands are harbouring some dirt now. His mind spins to the bathtub where he’ll wash it out later.
Draco nods. “Anything that’s charmed or has otherwise magical properties. No wands though or things crafted from wand material. That’s very different from what I do. Whatever you try, they never work. They're almost unmendable.”
Suddenly Harry questions whether getting drugged in an ex-Death Eater’s home was a safe, wise thing to do and not completely insane. But he tries to calm his speeding heart.
Draco bit his lip. The truth was, there hadn’t been anyone else for Draco, not since the day he’d first clapped eyes on Potter on the Hogwarts Express. Even when he’d dated other people, Harry had still held his heart. Draco only wished that his lie was the truth, and that Harry returned his feelings.
So instead, I tried to stop thinking and just enjoy myself with Potter. I moaned his name (Harry was very responsive to that), and I loved how it sounded so different from the way I normally say it.
While something about this rings true, the chaos of thoughts inside his brain doesn’t allow Harry to think about it too much. There are pictures of Dumbledore and the Dursleys randomly popping up in his consciousness. Half-remembered thoughts that might as well be dreams or wild hallucinations on alcohol and drugs. He remembers looking at a huge serving of chocolate ice-cream while suckling on a stale lemon icicle, his mouth watering with a sadness that he didn’t understand back then and understands only partly now.
Harry zones out of the conversation. The tunes of a pop song become quite prominent. It might be a cover of a Weird Sisters song. He leans closer to Draco. “Glad we’re not listening to wizarding music at home. It’s awful.”
“I believe you,” Harry murmured into Draco’s hair. “I believe you, and I always have. Let me look after you, Draco. I can’t undo what happened to you, but I can take care of you. You and the bump too, if that’s what you want. I’ll support you. I’ll love you, love
It gave me the feeling that we belong together, even without any clear arrangements. I had a hard time picturing that he wanted to be in a real relationship with an unbonded father. Perhaps that was just my fear, though, to have all that – this thing evolving between us, that thing that was there the day we “first” slept with each other – that it would be wrenched away from me if I clasped it too tightly. And after all those headlines in the
On their way upstairs, Harry just tells him that his week was fine. In the living room, Harry gets his coke vial out of his back pocket and wiggles it in front of Draco.
Draco looked over to where Harry was fiddling with his strange paper money at the till, and unfolded the Muggle newspaper that’d been left on the table by the previous occupants.
The conversation is a bit stilted for a while, and Harry is only glad that he did a few grams back at Gringotts, perfectly aware how awful he would have felt otherwise. Even though his exhilarated mood is a bit tainted, he’s not feeling completely down. They’re mostly waiting for the high to kick in, exchanging only a few words until Draco puts on some music with a decisive flip of his wand.
The blanket that Draco had wrapped around himself had fallen to the floor while he was asleep, so I bent down to retrieve it. I was just about to place it back over Draco when I paused, astounded by the sight before me. If I hadn’t seen it with my own two eyes, I doubt I would have believed it. My friend’s shirt had ridden up, and where I’d normally have expected to see a dip beneath Draco’s ribcage, instead there was a subtle rounding.
- to get Draco talking, but what? One thing we haven’t done is buy Teddy’s Christmas present yet. I’ll suggest doing that later this week and ask him to call into Phoenix while I’m working the late shift. If I’m really lucky then I’ll manage to convince Draco to visit The Leaky with me afterwards.
“Looks beautiful,” Harry says, meaning the way the moon isn’t visible but still, they know exactly where it is hidden. They hold tightly onto each other as they stand there, and Harry feels the tension thawing from his shoulders. “You make me feel so much better,” Harry murmurs, his head on Draco’s shoulder. “Always.” He glances at Draco appreciatively, liking how his silhouette glows softly against the consuming darkness.
, they keep on reminding one another.  Sometimes Harry wishes they were better for each other; that they’d work in another way than secluded from everything they’ve ever known. But it’s easier not to think about the past. Only when the thoughts make themselves inevitable in dreams, angry shouts, and bitter tears.
do on his own. “You know what you’ll get when I’m back,” Harry quips weakly, shoving his hips against Draco’s. But Draco doesn’t let him get away with a half-hearted innuendo. Instead, Draco kisses Harry, very thoroughly, and just when Harry parts his lips with a moan, melting into Draco’s touch, Draco wrenches himself away from him, breathless and with a smirk on his beautiful face. “You’ll have to come back for more,” he says, an odd plea in his eyes which linger on Harry’s own just for a fraction of a second too long, as though he
They are dancing, and laughing, attempting to talk with yells that are abandoned halfway-through because the music is too loud. Harry has always felt insecure about his body and how it moves, how it looks to other people. Dancing certainly isn’t something he usually does, but it is, here and now. And the
He can’t though. He won’t. Harry repeats that like a mantra in his mind, feeling like he might forget if he didn’t.
“Sometimes I feel like I’m not even a wizard,” Harry says, half absently following Draco into the kitchen.
Then a flash, and there’s a wizard. Could it be . . . ? He looks like the head of St Mungo’s management. He smiles at me, white tie, his hair swept back in a neat hairdo, and I think what a smooth grey it is in contrast to Potter’s salt-and-pepper bird’s nest. I have him in a standing position, his hands braced against a grand mantlepiece.
It’s farcical, actually. Part of me dies a little with envy at the idea of Draco and these other nameless, faceless men, while the other part of me is protective. I want them to treat Draco with respect and not just fuck into him like he’s a living sex doll, made to their specifications, without any needs or wants of his own. I’m aware of how infantilising I’m being, and how condescending. Draco is an adult and a professional. This is his world, and I know he can look after himself.
He’d gone back to Fitzgerald’s room with the express purpose of having sex. He’d wanted it plenty. He’d dressed to impress, and groomed himself appropriately. He hadn’t been threatened or punched; he’d been told he was gorgeous, told that he was sexy. Fitzgerald hadn’t used his wand; he’d used lube, and prepped him so well that he could push his cock inside with ease. He hadn’t bled. There had been no force. Fucking hell, but Fitzgerald had even stroked him to an orgasm.
- doesn’t matter. Henry Potter—the one that got you cast out—his grandmother, Adelia Fleamont. See, she was born a Malfoy, daughter of Lucius Armand Malfoy, and she had phoenixes.” Malfoy gestures to the copper basin on the table.
Draco looked and sounded decisive, as though he’d planned this exact moment in his head and had played it through over and over again. “Darling,” Harry said softly, feeling the need to slow this down a little. “May I kiss you?”
“Let’s see . . . That man across.” Carol subtly nods her chin towards a very handsome man with perfectly styled hair and a casual looking suit that makes Harry wish that he had dressed better this evening. He wants to get the bloke out of the jacket, wants to get him out of all his clothing for that matter.
“Just take a bite,” Draco urges. He’s worried, and it shows. His posh voice is low, full of forced joviality. “It’s tasty, Harry. It’s nice. The elves haven’t buggered it up too badly.”
“It won’t take long,” Harry says, hoarse and urgent, rubbing his thigh against Draco’s crotch and feeling himself getting hard. “And when I’m back, you’ll take a break and we fuck. Do you want to tie me up?” Harry asks, licking over the shell of Draco’s ear. He starts to get the idea that Draco would like that. “You can tie me up, and you can keep me.”
Other times Draco has ridden me, slow and sensual, groaning whenever my cock glanced over his prostate. My hands have found his oversensitive nipples, and my darling has practically wept with the intense sensation of it. It doesn’t take all that much to make Draco orgasm in his current condition, and it is the biggest turn on in the whole world to watch his cum splatter all over the swell of his belly. Merlin, but there is no bigger privilege in the world than watching Draco in the aftermath of sex, overcome by his orgasm, red-cheeked and sweaty, and getting so big with our baby.
Harry pulls Draco close, emitting a huffed laugh in the other wizard. He kisses his chest, his hips, everywhere he can reach; nudging Draco’s shirt up until he can put his lips on the soft skin of Draco’s abdomen. Draco is laughing, his hand in Harry’s hair, pushing him closer. “You ought to stop or you’ll make me hard,” he says, twitching at all the ticklish parts Harry reaches.
“Look, you would never . . .” Draco catches his wrist when Harry moves to turn around, but Harry wrenches his hand away and starts pacing. He needs to move his muscles, get this electrifying feeling out of his system. Draco stands infuriatingly still when he ploughs on, voice rushed and almost free from any emotions. “You would never have talked to me the day I found you and Side-Alonged you to my house. Never. And that’s because you know who I am. You know my history and your own. I guess it was nice to have the first talks a bit . . .
Fitzgerald got to leave, got to begin afresh, but Draco had to stay. He had to live with the reality of what had happened to him. His words hadn’t been enough. If you consent enough times, you weren’t allowed to say no, not ever again. If you’ve fucked enough men, then one more didn't matter. You were fair game.
If I’d pretend to be anything but the heir of my family, I’d have to mention what I do for a living. And I don’t know one soul on Gaia’s green earth who wouldn’t be completely appalled.
I ought to talk to him. I need to tell Harry what I did, and I will need to actually apologise for breaking his trust. I’ll suggest that we try talking more often and about real subjects. We both try to be honest; I don’t doubt that. But there are things the both of us overthink until we believe them to be true. And we’re so scared of saying them, afraid that the other might leave.
The comment made me go quiet. I studied his face for a moment, then I kissed him. It took much more courage than before the sex when my prick had more control over my actions than my brain. But luckily, he didn’t reject me, but kissed me back with closed eyes and pliant lips.
It’s not until Draco comes back, beaming with excitement and affection, but his eyes focused with academic curiosity, that Harry’s mood shifts, unbidden and sudden. They kiss in the hallway with Harry’s arms holding Draco snug around his middle, when Draco holds him by his shoulders, pressing one kiss to Harry’s lips that feels hurried and final.
“They are good,” Draco replies, his voice rushed. He goes on to explain how most wixen overdo the charm and make the pillow overly soft and cottony, so that your head  sinks all the way. In Draco’s opinion, it needs a certain hardness to be comfortable or else he’d wake up with a stiff neck. He asks Harry whether he should change the hardness level on the pillow—it’s one long cushion that stretches over both sides of the bed—and after Harry refuses with thanks, Draco takes a shaky breath and puts his open palm on Harry’s chest.
Harry had been nervous before their visit, nauseous and a migraine had begun. But Draco had held him until they made themselves late—Draco hates being late—but which had placed Harry in a slightly better headspace.
The idea had been playing on my mind before, but it took form on Christmas. I feel disloyal for saying so but I don’t have another friend like him. That’s not meant to say the others aren’t good friends. I love Quidditch with Greg, gossiping with Blaise and Pansy – I even enjoy all these sappy, heartfelt talks I share with Astoria. Fuck it, I even enjoy the Quidditch rants over a few pints with the Weasel (Salazar save me, I just called him my friend), but… BUT.
“I was just about to come and get you,” Draco managed, after a couple of seconds had passed. I- I think it’s time to Firecall Healer Bartsch. I think- I know this is it. The plum. It’s time.” He took a couple of deep breaths before standing up again. “I’m terrified, Harry. Not sure that I’m strong or brave enough for this.”
“Potter,” was the first word out of Draco’s mouth when he arrived at my workshop at Phoenix, and when our eyes met, they were every bit as cheeky and as full of mischief as they always were.
It was time to go home. He’d go home, strip off, have a shower and take a sleeping elixir, just exactly like he’d planned.
“Oh, bloody hell,” I muttered, flustered, as I moved Draco onto his back and checked his naked body for injuries. There wasn’t anything visible, not that I could see, but I hadn’t a clue what had happened to him. “Draco love,” I demanded, hating how panicked my voice sounded. “What happened? Was it Kayden? Where has he gone?”
My hand was at my own prick, but Harry said, “Please, I need to see,” and so I turned around, back against the headboard, and I rubbed myself into my orgasm that went half on my belly and half in Harry’s face. I didn’t hesitate to lick some of my cum from his cheek and kiss him, using my last bits of energy for a fierce kiss, which Harry commented with a, “Merlin, Draco, you’re sex incarnate,” taking a calming breath and whipping sweat and spunk off his face.
“Die of starvation more like!” Harry groused, drinking a mouthful of tea. He winced. It had long ago gone cold, so he warmed it back up with a tap of his wand before speaking again. He leant back in his chair. “Ron said that you’d have to be Merlin himself to get a reservation. He wanted to take ‘Mione for her birthday, but all he got was a big fat nope. It’s booked up for months.”
, I am not enough. How I never have been. Not lordly enough for Father, not agreeable enough for Mother, not good enough for stupid Potter and the Weasel when we were eleven, not smart enough for Snape, not brave enough for Dumbledore, not enough of a ruthless killer for Bellatrix and that maniac.
Mike held my gaze. “Second is your attitude to relationships, Harry. Relationships are give-and-take, yet the whole basis of your relationship with Draco was based on you taking from Draco. Polyjuicing your features – disguising yourself – means that whole basis of your relationship was based on a fiction. That was a betrayal, and so Draco will see everything through that lens. All of your actions will feel like betrayals because that is what he is expecting from you.”
"When in doubt, it shall be the Sonos," Tarquin prompts without looking up from the book he’s reading. He’s lying on the settee, legs crossed at the ankles, book held up in an uncomfortable position. Judith sounds excited at the idea, and her friend's head—Harry forgot her name, but it might be Lynn or Kim or something—her head perks up at the mention of the club as well. It’s not a huge nightclub, but it is one of their regulars. Harry likes the idea. They’d find everything they need; it all flows freely there—drinks, loud music, MDMA, mephedrone, coke. It’d be a perfect night. Exhausting perhaps, but it’s exactly what he’ll need after the weird down he’s having. He remembers how oddly alone he felt this morning with all his friends just a few feet away. The thrill of music, a pleasant upper in his system, ideally somewhere to talk the night away with Tarquin after being sweaty and breathless from dancing for hours on end—that sounds just perfect.
I found his gaze, and I must’ve looked at him quite desperately, pleading and pleading for him to keep going with his prick buried deep inside of me, going in and out like butter; his hand tugging so perfectly in my prick. Circe, I knew I wouldn’t last another minute, and James didn’t leave me hanging. Quite the contrary. He doubled his efforts in fucking me, and he didn’t take his hand off my prick for just one second.
In his peripheral view, it doesn’t escape Harry how Neville’s gaze and mouth corners drop to their linked fingers, and something about that is almost too much for Harry to bear. They take a walk along the beach, only he and Draco. Ginny and Ron want to join, grinning and fierce as they are, but Harry hears Hermione tell them off without many words.
“Yes,” Harry said again, chuckling along with Draco who was positively laughing now. “What’s so funny?”
It’s only when they have cleared the table and are seated back in the living room again, that Harry looks at Draco for a long moment. Then he scoots closer and runs a hand through his perfect hair, sweeping the soft tufts back over his head. “I’m sorry that I left last week,” he says. “And that I ruined the mood when we . . .”
In the six years we’ve been friends, Draco has only mentioned Lucius a handful of times. At first, I believed this was for my benefit – after all, Lucius had tried to have me killed, more than once – but I soon came to understand that there was actually very little to tell. Lucius Malfoy is very unwell. He is confined to bed in the Azkaban hospital wing, nearly catatonic and withdrawn from the world. I wondered whether Draco would ever tell him about his baby, and whether, if he did, he would be able to respond.
Oh Merlin, I wanted to reply. I wanted to tell Draco that he could tell me anything, and that I’d love him anyway but that was the exact moment that the sky exploded into a blazing spectacle of Wheezes fireworks. Lions and dragons chased and danced through the sky on a background of rainbows and rockets.
I’m feeling horrible. I didn’t even drink that much, but I’m feeling so hungover I might as well have drunk Potter’s fruit punch all by myself. I couldn’t even take up on Lady Zabini’s offer to join her for breakfast – the smell of the cooked eggs alone had me gagging.
Before I thought about the consequences of my actions, I typed an email. ‘I like your pictures,’ I wrote without thinking. ‘I’ve gotten hard just looking at them. I imagine the real man would be even sexier. I’d like to spend quality time getting to know you better, Drake. I promise to make it worth your while. James Evans.’
Harry takes his hand out of Draco’s and places both his palms flat on his thighs, wiping off some non-existent sweat. He feels restless as his fingers dig into his leg. He excuses himself to the loo.
I only hummed along, barely registering what he said other than that he wants to Floo home after work so that we can get on the Knight Bus together, “or the Muggle bus,” he even suggested, but a pregnant bloke is a bit exotic, even for Muggle London.
That, dearest Harry, was how you managed to convince Draco to accompany you to the Weasley bonfire party. If ever, in the future, you happen upon these words again, be reminded that tonight was, without a shadow of a doubt, their finest party yet.
If I walk into a room where Draco is, he simply walks out of the door. He had instructed Kreacher to take him his meals up to his room, which is where he spends most of his time. Diary, I know it is selfish, but I miss him. I miss him, and the plum, and the life that we were building.
The Auror and he both signed the statement, and a tap of Macintosh’s wand made it official. Draco had expected that he’d feel upset, or distressed, but all he felt was a curious sense of relief. There was finally a record of what had happened, so if there was another accusation, it would point to a pattern in Fitzgerald’s behaviour. Even if nothing changed, one thing had. Fitzgerald would hear the word rape, uttered in reference to his own actions, and maybe, on some level, that might strike home. Draco would never know. If he lived to be a thousand, he never wanted to see Stuart Fitzgerald, not ever again.
I wish dearly that I knew how to begin that conversation, but I scarcely know how to form the words. I fear that when Draco discovers the truth, he will despise me, as will everybody else.
you Pansy! I believed every word you said.” He held Daisy close to his chest, held onto her tiny weight. Held onto his precious little baby. “You weren’t in my corner. You weren’t a good friend.”
“Feel that!” Draco demanded, taking Harry’s hand in his own, and pressing it into his belly. “They’re kicking me! They’re really there, Potter! Bloody hell, but that comes keen!”
Boring, straightlaced Potter, who had listened and had believed him. He’d never once let Draco down, and he hadn’t asked for a thing in return. Draco looked up at Harry through eyes that smarted and a head that ached. Draco nodded his consent, and let himself be held in arms that were warm, protecting and solid.
Harry didn’t speak for a minute. He sat quietly, and seemed to consider what Draco had said. Harry didn’t shift into Saviour Auror mode, insisting that Draco accompany him to the DMLE to make a statement. He didn’t make threats against Fitzgerald, and he didn’t shout that he was going to curse him into ashes. Best of all, Harry didn’t ask for clarification, or demand sordid details, or tell Draco he was right to blame himself; that he’d been drunk and wearing a revealing shirt.
Although Draco told the story of the night of Oliver Wood’s past as well as he could remember, the statement that Macintosh wrote hardly stretched over two sides of parchment. There was so little to tell. Yes, he had been drunk. Yes, he had gone back to Fitzgerald’s bedroom willingly. Yes, they’d flirted and
I suppose, given my history, you’d think that I ought to loathe Christmas. When I was little – even before I knew I was a wizard – it was always a lonely time for me.
Anxiously, Draco closed his hands around the glass, waiting for the inevitable angry outburst on Harry’s part.
When they said it for the first time, they were a wild tangle of limbs on the settee, their throats raw with laughter and singing along to the tunes of I Believe In A Thing Called Love with gay abandon. “
“Pretty legit opinion,” Harry replies with a grin. “I often forget to drink enough. But I could do with, I don’t know, a beer? Wine? Whisky? Alternating with the water, of course—what do you reckon?”
that’s been missing from his life for quite some years, he realises while getting a few things done around the house that would allow him and Draco more time just for the two of them without responsibilities or work on their schedule.
Merlin, but Draco has the most gorgeous prick. It’s long, and skinny, and the glans is the most delicate pink. It’s an odd thing for a bloke to say, but it was elegant. I couldn’t help but lick and kiss it through the gauzy material of Draco’s underwear. I’m not in a minute of doubt that this was odd behaviour from a client but in the heat of the moment, I couldn’t bring myself to care. All I wanted was to give Draco pleasure.
He seemed genuinely interested and ever so open-minded. So I tried to answer these questions, telling him about this one time that someone refused to pay me and I sort of had to run out of the hotel. But I also said that this was once in possibly a thousand clients that I've had over the past few years and how, normally, everything goes well, and most blokes just want sex or a BJ, and some even want a sneaky cuddle afterwards.
. “Need to catch up,” Tarquin says, and John seems thrilled by the idea of seeing them again over after work pints.
so that the Muggles sat around them wouldn’t overhear. “What’s happened? You look awful, Draco, like you’ve seen a ghost! It isn’t the baby, is it? Are you in pain? Talk to me,” he said, voice urgent. “Let me help you.”
“Salazar,” I sighed, burying my face in my hands. “Why don’t you fight with me? Is it only because I’m pregnant or are you honestly just to fucking good to get down to my level?”
“What do you need?” Harry teases, one hand diving between their bodies to stroke himself, to guide his well-lubed prick along the crease of Draco’s arse. His eyes flutter shut every time he feels his head against Draco’s pucker, barely able to delay the push just another second.
They are in Potter’s home. A crooked house with large windows and a charmingly overgrown back garden. It might as well be Draco’s home. The light feels too bright, the house too silent. There is no one near them, no one who has thoughts and memories and urges, and Draco wonders why Harry seeks the same seclusion as he does, wonders what his reasons are for finding people so obnoxiously loud.
. She’d been there with him, keeping him going and giving him something to live for, even on his darkest days. Harry came up with the name Daisy. It was a small, unassuming name, but as soon as Draco heard Harry suggest it, he knew it was perfect.
So yes, I’ve brought sex. Fact is, I’m randy. It’s been months since I split from Adey and wanking in the shower, while delightful and all, isn’t quite the same as having a man in your bed, all muscle, sweat and
“Yes, yes,” Draco interrupted impatiently, leaning over Harry’s desk. “I know all about your cases, Harry! I’m the one who has to argue them in the Wizengamot.” He frowned at the piles of parchment that littered the surface. “And I happen to know when you, my dear, are trying to change the subject. So, as I was saying, The Chimaera’s Den. It’s newly opened on Artemisia Avenue, the chef is a wizard from Paris and, most importantly, Pansy has heard that the food is to die for.”
So far it all seems very textbook. At least for witches. Almost every darn Healing textbook focuses on female pregnancies. I ordered two more books, one of which will be in antiquated French (good luck to my future self), to try and get more information on male pregnancies. I’ve also consulted the archive at the Ministry and dived to a catalogue of all the maladies they treated in St Mungo’s. They did have a wizard who successfully delivered a child from a pregnant wizard in the sixties. Too bad that the bedrock is not working there anymore but retired. Perhaps, I can contact him. I ought to try.
I couldn’t bear facing Harry after that talk, not for one single moment. Without one word, I Disapparated from the MATERNITY ward and made a beeline for my room. Much like a petulant teen, I locked myself in as though Harry wouldn’t have respected my wish to be alone for a while without an Alohomora… Sighing at myself here.
“Draco, stop,” came a voice, and it wasn’t Fitzgerald. Thank fuck, it wasn’t Fitzgerald. Standing beside him on the dewy grass of the Malfoy Manor lawn was Harry Potter, wearing ill-fitting formal robes and an expression of worry. “I’m sorry I surprised you like that. I thought for sure you must have seen me. I saw you make for the door and I was worried.”
“Can you . . .” Harry isn’t sure what he wants to say, what he wants to know about it. Every thought led him to unthinkable associations. He nods his head to the water glass and says, “Do you have something stronger?”
Yes, Draco might have fought on the opposite side during the war, but in so many ways our experiences were mirrored. The pair of us were misused by adults that we trusted with our lives and forced to carry our hatred like a shroud. The pair of us were lucky to emerge with most of our sanity intact and the freedom of long lives in front of us to live.
Pain had seared his chest and he’d found himself on his knees, panting and gasping. It had been the oddest, most sickening experience. After hours had passed, Draco had Vanished the disgusting rag with a swipe of his wand. He didn't want to touch the filthy thing with his hands. The shirt was a reminder of Fitzgerald, and the fewer of those there were in the world, the better.
Harry loves the irony of it. And he loves how most of the bands weren’t pretentious. If they put on a show it usually had visuals of  skulls or blood or upside-down crucifixes which, admittedly, is pretentious in their own way. But it’s completely different from those ludicrous pop artists they sometimes watch and laugh about on the television. In a way, and without feeling like he has the first clue about music, Harry thinks he’s starting to understand what Nick is going on about when he talks about handmade music and it being true to a certain concept—may it be a brutal metal gig, an advanced jazz band or an operetta. “
Fitzgerald didn’t last long. Maybe he’d drunk too much. Perhaps he was wound up, or perhaps Fitzgerald was genuinely horrible at sex. It didn’t matter, not really.
If the Mediwizard was shocked at Draco’s lack of treatment during the first months of his pregnancy, he didn’t voice it.
