Almost hesitantly, as if he isn’t sure it’s real, isn’t sure he can really touch it, he picks it up. Magic thrums through him.

he was at Grimmauld Place, knew Harry was sleeping just a few feet away from him….
Harry’s cake is divine, and before Draco has finished even half his slice he is feeling better.
“Horrified?”
“Muggles are one thing,” Macnair said softly, “but to have a fine, Pureblood at my disposal… Well, now, aren’t I the lucky one that the Dark Lord is pleased with me and displeased with you?”
Draco Malfoy was cleared of all charges, and Harry, personally, returned his wand and shook his hand as flashbulbs went off around them.
Harry wasn’t sure if Draco was fighting tears or a panic attack.
Potter is beside him, landing no more gracefully, and their heads collide with a sickening smack.

“Yes. You’ll say the lubrication charm… and you’ll start with one finger. This finger.”
And again the next. This time Malfoy objects.
“I’m glad... I’m glad you were here tonight.” Potter turns slightly, towards Draco, brushing his thumb, lightly, over his wrist. “I just wanted to say… I didn’t expect… this is going to sound so stupid… but just staying in and watching that film… with you… this was the nicest evening I’ve had… in a really long time.”
He lifted his head, only to realize that standing was out of the question; he would have to crawl. He was stiff and everything hurt. His back felt crusty in places and sticky in others.

They want to build a proper orphanage and Draco’s main objective tonight is to use Harry’s fame and the goodwill surrounding his name to see that sizable donations are made.

Draco isn’t even sure what he’s asking for. To be fucked by Harry Potter? Maybe. To have Harry Potter sweep in and set everything to rights? If only that were possible.
“Alright?”
Forever is a fact between them. But it’s a fact without any real details.
The shadows are long when Harry stops the bike. The towers… the bricks… even the hedges already look cheerful. If a house can look cheerful. Hopeful.
“I… know a few things,” Draco admits. “My great-grandfather… He didn’t have a wife. He had a

” before beginning to give commands like a drill sergeant.
Harry tucks himself back in and watches Malfoy try to right his clothing, watches him move with aching slowness into a sitting position.
He rises up on his elbow and looks down at Harry. He threads his fingers through his hair, brushes his cheek almost reverently, and kisses him deeply. Draco tries let the kiss say everything he can’t…
Draco wonders why it took Harry so long to come back… had Luna decided that he needed some time alone and simply delayed in telling Harry that he had left? Had she delivered his message with enough calmness that Harry stayed, sure that Draco was fine, to finish his beer and hear the rest of Finnegan’s jokes?
Draco takes another deep breath. “I’m booked for three hours… so as long as I don’t leave here before then, more or less, it’s fine. We don’t have to… fuck.”
The closest thing he had to a father was dead. The closest thing he had to a child was being punished for failing to do the deed. Severus’s own heart was in pieces; it had shattered when he cast that killing curse at Dumbledore.
Draco sits up and catches Harry’s eyes in his own. They are so beautiful: emerald, yes, but with flecks of turquoise and even amber. He memorizes every detail, every highlight, every sparkle… because he knows Harry will not come back… not to someone whom he cannot touch without hurting.
He points to two streaks of silver, one longer than the other, on his arm, just below his shoulder. “Here’s the marks from the Horntail’s tail… the Triwizard Tournament, you know?” And to the rough patch above it, spreading to the back of his shoulder. “A frying pan. It was hot.”
“I don’t know,” Harry says.
The man even has mud on his boots!

“I was wondering if you would like to go into Hogsmeade? With me?”
I catch Draco’s eyes and smile. He smiles back. Tentatively.
Harry watches Malfoy drain the sink, wipe it down, and rinse and ring out the cloth. He drapes it over the faucet and turns to face Harry.

Suddenly Harry is beside him, holding him tightly. “Just breathe, Draco,” Harry says, sounding far away. “I’ve got you. I just need you to breathe.”

The sun is out now, but it has been raining for three days and the garden is overrun with weeds. The garden is in a bit of a lull at the moment. The flush of springtime and early summer blooms have faded and the dark jewels of autumn flowers have not yet begun.
A man he doesn’t know places his hand—firmly—on Harry’s arm. “Is that Death Eater bothering you, Mr. Potter?” he demands. The man has battleship grey hair, is wearing a pin-striped suit and is already pulling out his wand.
I didn’t.
“Glad to hear it,” Weasley says. “Coffee?”
It just feels…
Draco stands up and walks out of the library. Lisbeth follows, like a dark shadow, behind him.
“That doesn’t seem fair.”
Almost.
Fortunately, Grimmauld Place’s wards extend all the way to the bottom step of the stoop, so none of the Muggles passing by on the street could witness such nonsense.
“It’s already gone, mate.”
Draco cuts him off. “There you go then.”
“No… I…” He is, he realizes suddenly. “Yes… But I’m not upset. It’s not a bad thing, I promise.”
The tub was filling too slowly. All he wanted was to get

She showed him how to move the hot iron across the fabric, using his fingers to smooth if first, then hold it flat, moving them only at the last second.
“No.”
Harry’s fingers continue tracing, then they yield to his mouth, warm and wet and tender. As his tongue traces the underside of the scar, Draco gasps, a high tiny sound accompanying the sensation of every nerve he has dancing just a little.
That’s not entirely true. The model the man preferred could have been a caricature of the man Draco is. Draco has seen the picture—the model is excruciatingly thin, all points and angles, pale to the point of ashen, with bleach-blond hair and almost colorless eyes.

“The night he came back. That was in a graveyard, too.”
“Thanks,” Harry says, his voice croaking a little.
Strong, slim hands hold him steady as he relieves himself of the remnants of his breakfast. Malfoy really is a University student, in his second year of a nursing course… of all the unexpected things.
Harry lets out a little sigh.
Ron spoke quietly. Harry’s exclamation of horror at that statement had overwrought the elf to such a degree that he had nearly bashed his head into unconsciousness before Harry managed to stop him. Harry had forbidden the elf to punish himself over it, though the way house-elves seemed to operate, Ron thought it was completely possible that Kreacher might well take it upon himself to punish himself for the original transgression, and then punish himself for punishing himself against orders.
“You can change in my room if you like,” Potter says. “I’ll just find you something… erm… warmer… to wear.”

“If I… Harry, this means something to me. Last night… I didn’t want to leave.”
Well, what is it then?”
“You remembered,” I say. And suddenly I want Draco’s hand back on my shoulder more than I want to take my next breath.
For a moment his eyes blaze again, then Harry Potter disappears down the hall, and Draco looks at what he has given him. It is a peach.
But Potter—and Granger and Weasley—had been kind… compassionate, even.
The boy didn’t scream. Stubborn child, Severus thought. It couldn’t last.
Draco doesn’t have an eating disorder.
Rose squirms out of Ron’s arms and high-fives Scorpius. Scorpius hugs Harry for about two seconds before he and Rose run off again, probably to plan world domination.
“It does, though,” Potter says. “Because—you deserve to be known as who you are, not who others think you are. And sure, there are some who won’t accept it, but you’ll find people who will.”
“I would hope not because I’m pretty sure Luna would kill me.”
“I know,” he says. “I just figured that it would be the nice thing to do.”
Draco understands
Potter digs out his phone.
Harry shakes the blanket out and wraps it around his shoulders.
“I chose to take the Mark,” Draco says. “I chose to try to kill Dumbledore.”
Harry wishes he were drinking, too, but the memory of Vernon’s drunken flush keeps him from any form of alcohol more effectively than any vow of abstinence.
“Right,” Potter says awkwardly. Draco can’t move, trapped as he is under Potter’s scrutiny. “Well, I’ll see you.”
“It’s nothing,” Draco manages to say.
For some people, it’s a slow process of self-discovery. For others, it’s a part of their identity that they knew all along. For Harry Potter, it was the moment Percy stood up in front of everyone with a new haircut and said, flashcards in hand, that his name was Percival and his pronouns were he/him.

“You’re awake,” Potter says, always the one to say the obvious. “Better?”
"He didn't," Harry says. "He wouldn't have--I would have known if he were starting to slip; I would have--"
(Except Harry does expect it because his foolish heart has no grip on reality.)
moves on. Everyone gets better--it's just Draco left to kneel in the dust.
Pansy nods slowly, but they do not look convinced.
Tessa sighs and starts snipping. When she gets done, Draco’s hair is about the same length as when Pansy cut it, but with more shape and volume.
“I’m getting waffles,” Malfoy says shortly. “You can tag along, I suppose.”
Potter doesn’t even
He knows better than to starve himself. (However, he also knows that he doesn’t
“I’m . . . I’m glad you’re okay,” Potter says. “I worried about you.”
“Hello, love,” Draco says, giving Scorpius a brief hug. “Want to show Harry your picture?”
Ginny is uncharacteristically quiet, but Harry doesn’t think much of it. After all, it’s a lot to take in—who wouldn’t feel a little shocked?
Potter rests his hand on Draco’s cheek, and Draco’s fingers close around Potter’s wrist.
That’s the only explanation for why he’s knocking on Potter’s door in the middle of the night, anxiety climbing up his throat.
"To what?"
He didn’t know what was wrong with him. And at the time, he thought there
“You haven’t fallen asleep,” Potter says, his hand still resting on Draco’s forehead.

He brushes Draco’s hair back, and Draco feels like his brain is about to shut down.

like they looked in their mirror and saw someone else.
The entire time, Draco does his best to hide the panic trapped in his chest, the guilt rising in his throat.
He doesn’t have an eating disorder. His throat is just too tight to choke anything down.
“Of course not!” Harry snaps. “They deserve to be happy—I
That should have been the end of it.
“Baby,” Harry says with dismay. “Baby,
“I haven’t started it yet,” Draco says.
"I miss you, Harry," Ginny says, her voice thick with tears.
As far as peace offerings go, this is an odd one, but Harry isn’t going to be picky.

There are days when Harry doesn't think about Draco. There are days when it's all Harry can focus on, like Draco's memory is a crushing weight obstructing the sun.

Someone took their happy pill today.
“Thank you,” Pansy says, lying on Draco’s bed and staring at the ceiling, “for not asking questions.”
“That, um,” Harry says, clearing his throat. “That wasn’t your real gift.”
“I don’t know,” Draco says. “I mean, people do that sometimes, right? Luna did.”
Draco peels the covers off his skin, then shakily makes his way across the room. He feels lightheaded and can barely keep his wand steady.
Would it be too much to ask for Draco to just . . . magically plant the perfect gift into Harry’s brain? But no. Draco is “fine with whatever you choose,” except that’s naturally a complete lie. Draco is

on the front. Draco’s mouth opens and closes.
Except he doesn’t have the references or a Muggle education necessary for a job.
Draco stares at his hands. There are so many reasons he could give her, but he doesn’t know how to begin to explain them all.
“Draco Malfoy.”
“That was rude of me,” Malfoy says. “I apologize.”
Well. She looks lonely. And she didn’t want to let Harry mope alone in the rain. And she likes waffles now, apparently.
“It doesn’t matter what I want,” Draco snaps.
Harry checks his other pocket, the insides of his sleeves.
“Only to complain,” Harry says automatically.
“No,” they said gently, “they don’t.”
He knows he’s screwing up. His two column method is

Harry chokes out. "I lost it, and he's
“Oh,” Draco says, panic still thrumming in his pulse. “How is she—“
“I’m drowning,” Draco says. “I’m no one. I’m—“

He apparates away before Harry can say anything.
What Draco
The only problem is, Potter doesn’t seem to have gotten the memo. They keep sending owls, full of inane chatter and random gossip. He keeps inviting Draco to go places, and the Fuck Around and Find Out dinners make

Before Malfoy can answer, Pansy bursts through, saying, “Sorry, Draco, I can’t find the other one in your size, but
Harry starts babbling about the random feel-good twattle that his therapist feeds him every Tuesday, but Draco is already tuning him out.
“If this keeps up,” Luna reflects over a glass of water, “we’ll have to close everything down.”
Draco doesn’t have the luxury that he did as a fifteen year old. He can’t let anyone see the person he is inside. The only things he has left to protect himself are his layers and layers of masks.
“I’m trans,” Draco says.
“Why would you—“
“You don’t need to thank me,” Draco says.
He has a Potions essay due on Tuesday, a History essay and a DADA analysis due on Wednesday, and a Divination report due on Thursday. It’s Monday.
Draco feels like nothing and everything is happening at once. He wants to die. He wishes Dumbledore just put him out of his misery the moment Draco pulled out his wand.
Harry runs his fingers across the cold marble.
Draco tackles Harry onto the floor, kissing him breathlessly, and the box slips through Harry’s fingers. Harry laughs and wraps his arms around Draco.
"Goodbye," Harry says, his voice rough.
He’s still a dick. This changes nothing.
“Do you talk to your dad?” Blaise asks.
“I feel like if I talk about it, everything will disappear,” Draco whispers. “Like it’s just a dream, and none of it is
“Let’s go,” Draco says hurriedly, grabbing Pansy’s hand.
Draco thinks it over carefully. Pansy is, he has to admit, the closest friend he has, despite her abrupt absence. If he were to trust anyone with the permission to ask questions, it would be her. The problem is, he doesn’t know if he would have the right answers.
“No,” says Pansy, “but it’s better than nothing. Besides, you
“Right,” Potter says. “Sorry for trying to be a semi-nice person.”
Words have no place under the waves.
Potter pauses, as if sorting through every word. He says slowly, “It’s good to have someone who understands to talk about this stuff. I had Percy and Luna. It’s only fair you have someone, too.”
He can’t ask Potter for anything. He doesn’t deserve anything. He doesn’t—

about things. Never asked for help, either."
Ginny says, striking a dramatic pose. "Ready the popcorn, babes--it's movie night."
The office is full of people, but he is the only one there. They have no presence; they have no voice.
Potter says jokingly.
In the long run, this is not a big deal. There are Squibs out who are starving for real, who don’t have an education past age eleven, who are living on the streets in squalor.
(Eager, warm,
Harry shakes his head so hard that his hair slaps his cheeks.
Harry pulls the ring from his pocket. It took him forever to find the right one. Draco was always so particular about what he wore, and Harry wanted to be sure that this was something Draco would want to wear for the rest of his life.
to eat, that he is still repaying a debt he has accrued over his many years of mistakes.) Thus, Draco sets up a reward system for himself.
“I don’t need your charity, Malfoy,” Ginny snaps.

right now, and all of it is directed Draco’s way. Draco understands now why Ron and Hermione followed him everywhere, heedless of the danger.
"Let's go home," he says flatly.
"I haven't felt like going out," Harry says.
“You’re a blood traitor,” Goyle says dismissively.
Narcissa looks at him with tears glistening in her eyes. Draco always thought tears softened another person’s face, but Narcissa looks so hard right now, with her jaw tight and lips pressed together.
Harry gives Draco a funny look. “Okay. Well, my answer is yes.”

Sure enough, Draco has a box full of chocolate frogs and fizzy lemon drops in his lap.
"Listen to me very carefully, Potter," Blaise says. "Draco Malfoy was like a house with the shutters closed. No one, and I mean
“Is it—is it not good?”
He needs to just stop talking and
Draco stares at Potter blankly, waiting for the punchline.
It's not just the scars that wind their way around his body. It's not just the mark burned into his skin.
Draco doesn’t have an eating disorder. He has a just punishment/reward system, and he is receiving his dues. He has kids counting on him, and he let them all down.
"Harry?" Pansy asks, confusion in their voice.
This thought keeps looping in Draco’s mind, despite any attempts to get rid of it.
“Would it be incredibly awkward of me to ask for your pronouns?” Harry asks. Awkwardly. As one does. “Or would you rather I just pretend this never happened?”
“Do you need help finding anything?” one girl asks.
“You gonna order?” Potter asks.
He’s been doing well, as evidenced by the fact that he’s managed to eat more often (four to five days a week isn’t bad). He’s managing it. He’s doing fine.
It's not that it's a bad night.
and he can’t let himself fall back down that hole of not having an effective system just because of forgetfulness. But it’s like there’s an external force, screaming in Draco’s ear, forcing him not to eat.
Harry stares at him blankly. They laugh nervously.
Draco knows he should be doing more. He knows it will never be enough. He just wishes that his mind would stop reminding him.
Upon hearing Harry’s voice, Scorpius quickly flips the paper over.
“It’s fine,” Harry says.
Still. A part of Harry wonders when Malfoy’s rough edges began to soften, when being
Draco has to force himself not to break out into a run.
Draco rubs his face. He’s fine. He can do this. He just won’t eat.
Interesting new way of greeting someone, but Harry can’t say he’s surprised.
Because materialism, that’s why.
Pansy wrapped their arms around Draco’s shoulders and pulled him close, their fingers gently combing through his hair.
"If I had read them--"
Draco feels panic shoot up his throat. This can’t be happening. They currently have twenty-three children in their program, and closing everything down would entail turning them loose on the streets. Also, this is probably the one good thing Draco has done in his life, and--
Harry should have

"I know this wasn't your fault, but I was so
“I’M GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU!”
“I can’t believe I’m saying this, but you aren’t a complete dick anymore,” she says.
“Are you drunk?” Draco blurts out, just as Potter starts to lean in.
“What is this?” Blaise demands, stepping closer.
“Look, as much as I appreciate it, I really don’t need—“
“You waved it right in front of my face!”
It’s nice hair, thick and wiry, and
“Why would he?” Ginny asks as she throws shirts and trousers at Draco to try on.
“I like your hair like this,” Harry whispers. “You always pin it up or tie it back or put it in a braid. I never get to see it loose.”
Looking slightly harassed, Draco steps next to Harry. Harry laughs at the sight of the paper crown on Draco’s head.
Draco backs away, his heart thudding. The columns flash before his eyes, and it feels like his tie is about to strangle him where he stands.
“I’m fine now,” Draco says, before Potter can say anything else.
“Nice job,” Draco says. “I always knew Scorpius would take after me in style.”
“Oh, that’s okay—“ Harry starts to say.
This is his punishment for joining the Death Eaters as a teenager, Draco supposes. As far as punishments go, it could be worse, but Draco wishes whatever God is in control of his pathetic life would just strike him down instead.
Harry looks at the ring lying in his palm, the gleam of gold and emerald winking up at him. (Gryffindor and Slytherin tastefully combined, as the jeweler joked.)
“I’ll have what he’s having,” Draco says.
Draco says coldly, “If you care so much, you can just buy it from me.”
A pained expression flashes across Robards's face. "No one is blaming you, Potter--"
Draco debates the pros and cons of changing his name and moving to Russia to live with Viktor Krum.
He could get a Muggle job, perhaps. No one knows him out there.
Harry looks up sharply. “They
"None of us saw," says Ron.
when they find out. They’ll probably give you a pin, maybe even a T-shirt.”
In the end, it doesn’t matter what Draco wears. He finds Harry sitting at the booth, a plate of untouched waffles shoved away, as they stare at a newspaper with knit eyebrows.
Ginny pulls back and tries to smile, but her eyes are too watery for it to look real.
“Dear Draco,” Blaise reads out loud, lounging in the corner like he’s sitting for a portrait, “thanks for coming to dinner last night—“
Draco quickly picks his burger up and starts to eat. It’s like ash trickling down his throat and mud sticking to his teeth.
fault. Not yours. Not Draco's. Sometimes--sometimes a person just feels trapped, and the only way they can think of to escape is--is--"
“I think you have a fever,” Potter says.
“No,” Draco says.
But Draco is already drifting away.
Harry thinks about asking why Malfoy is in the men’s dressing room, but he’s pretty sure asking that would somehow end in disaster. He instead settles on saying, “Nice braid.”
“Anyway, I’m trans,” Harry says over ice cream, one month, two haircuts, and one binder later.
“Why would you say that?” Draco asks.
Ginny pouts. “I dated him for months! I think I can tell how Harry professes his love. Besides, why did you give it to me if you didn’t want my input?”
The Manor passed to Draco after Lucius’s death in Azkaban, but—
"You're making me feel all greasy," Draco complains, brushing kernels off of himself.
“Ron,” Harry says from his seat at a few feet away, “Ron, it’s not a big deal--”
“I’m—“
Scorpius hugs back, but it isn’t long before he’s squirming away and running off with Rose.
"Sometimes it helps," Hermione starts to say.
“Um,” Harry says. “Why?”
Draco’s head hurts. He doesn’t understand what Potter is trying to do, and he wishes Potter would just get it over with because Draco is tired of the looming panic that pervades his every thought.
But every time another witch or wizard looks at him, he feels like he’s eleven years old again, sneering at Ron Weasley for being poor. He’s sixteen, terrified and trying to kill Dumbledore. He’s eighteen, trapped in his shell of a home, haunted by echoes of Voldemort’s presence wherever he goes. He’s twenty-two, shivering on the street, getting turned away from job after job after job.
Pansy or Blaise. They just . . . figured it out and asked him what he wanted them to call him.
“Just give him a nice massage,” advises Ron at the bar. “That’s what I do for Hermione, and it works like a charm every year.”
"I can imagine why," Luna says.
Harry nods morosely, and she gives him a look of deep pity. Tori nudges a deep green tie forward.
"I don't understand it," Harry says. He is kneeling at Draco's grave, running his finger across Draco's name again and again. "To be honest, I don't really understand you. But I know--"
“Shopping,” Ginny says shortly. She gives Draco a nasty glare. “For Harry.”
Potter pauses.
Harry is fond of saying that these people are fools, but Draco can't help thinking that Harry is the fool for choosing to stay with him. While their methods may be cruel and at times illegal, they're right about one thing: Harry Potter deserves better.
But he’s getting better. This is helping him do so.
Potter hesitates, then draws a wand from his robes. Panic shoots up Draco’s throat, even though he knows Potter isn’t going to do anything, not now, not during Luna’s party, not when—
Ginny stops and turns around.
Draco remembers the disdain on Tessa’s face when all he could say was
Draco is so cold.
“Oh,” he says. “Oh, love.” He hugs Scorpius tightly and kisses Scorpius’s hair. “Thank you.”
Harry is lost at sea, drowning underneath an icy torrent. He sits next to Hermione and Ron, their hands tightly linked with his. Ron and Hermione's voices overlap, but Harry does not hear a word.
for Harry fucking Potter!”
“But you weren’t a part of a racist cult, so you have that going for you,” Draco says.
Draco thinks he might have a fever. He can’t really tell because his hands are the same temperature as his forehead, and none of the Healers will admit him.
Ginny peers at Draco curiously.
Molly pauses, pulling away to look at Harry. Her eyes brim with tears, and Harry feels an unexpected flare of irritation. How
"I'm sorry," says Harry, "for not noticing that you were drowning. And I'm sorry for blaming you for something that was out of your control."
Draco kept looking at articles. He read about Luna and Percy and people he didn’t even know, some of them Muggles. He asked Pansy question after question, to the point that he was worried they
The words get stuck in Draco’s throat, and he can’t quite remember the exact thing he was going to say. Potter’s hands are still on Draco, and it’s been so long since anyone has touched him.
“I don’t drink,” Draco says.
“Sorry,” Draco blurts out.
Dead silence. Then:
When Harry and Draco get back, Scorpius and Rose are hard at work over drawings. Harry catches a glimpse of people holding hands on Scorpius’s paper and leans in slightly to get a better look.
When Pansy returns from France, she brushes off Blaise and Goyle’s questions with a simple “I was finding myself.” She also takes in Draco’s short hair and Muggle clothes with barely a raised eyebrow and moves on with her day.
If he were paying attention, he would have noticed the witch slipping her wand out from her robes and pointing it at his feet. But he didn’t, so now he’s falling.
(He is not innocent; he is not a victim. Draco is stained, stained,
This is a bad idea.
“Not yet.”
Pansy shakes Harry's shoulders, but Harry keeps digging.
Draco tries not to flinch. He really does, but he can’t stop thinking about men grabbing him by his robes and slamming him against the wall and saying,
Harry pulls back, a puzzled look on his face.
He flees the dressing room, mumbling something about having to find Percy.
But it’s like he’s trapped in one spot, in one moment. Potter’s touch spreads through Draco’s skin and poisoning his blood.
Draco stumbles out of Potter’s flat. The wind slices through him, and he immediately regrets it.
Draco runs before Potter can say anything else.
“Hence the truck,” says Malfoy. “Pansy gave it to me. It was
Malfoy gives Harry a look of pure scorn, and Harry belatedly remembers that this is the men’s dressing room and that, even if Malfoy couldn’t tell the difference due to elitist idiocy, Pansy would surely know.
Okay, so maybe Draco should have known better than to go out with Harry and the rest of the Golden Trio. They’re idiots (not Granger, but Draco swears that her IQ takes a dip whenever she’s around Weasley and Harry at the same time). They convince
Nothing Draco does can be enough.
“No, what I mean to say it—“ Harry rubs his face. “I was going to do it there, but I didn’t want to embarrass you.”
“The Healers won’t—“
Fuck Draco Malfoy. Harry never should have eaten waffles with him. He shouldn’t have even gotten in the truck, and they definitely shouldn’t have let their gaze linger on the way Draco’s hair framed his face and spilled over his shoulders.
“I SAID, SHUT UP!"
So out Draco stumbles to find Harry Potter standing in the family room, clutching what looks like a cauldron.
But Draco was never safe, not then with the Dark Lord bored and seeking amusement and certainly not now with the Dark Mark permanently burned into his skin.
to touch me, and you all look at me like I’m some kind of infection, which
“I know that,” Draco says, his voice wavering despite his attempts to sound calm.
"I hate them," Harry snaps. "I want to burn them, but I--"
“He invited me to the ‘Fuck Around and Find Out’ dinner with Luna and Percy.”
Imagine the headlines.”
her hair looks so much like Draco's it
whatever it can be called (Harry can’t bring himself to call it a crush), is something else.
Poems of death and blood and loathing, of fear and failure, of the lines Draco was planning to trace in his skin.
Pansy is the one who comes up with a solution, as she often does.
“What are
Pansy just holds Harry, smoothing back Harry's hair.
Harry. Bad enough that Harry obsessed over Draco at Hogwarts—childhood rivalries are one thing, but . . .
Harry snorts and shoves Draco’s shoulder.
“Maybe it’s us,” Luna muses thoughtfully. “No one really
It took a while and the sun was beating down on him mercilessly, but he knew he couldn’t go in until everything was done … Petunia doesn’t allow breaks.
“for once I can say the same. It’s nice to see not everyone falls for your … charm” Lucius smirked and started walking away “lets go Draco”
“Yes,” Draco whispers, staring at his reflection. He touches his hair carefully, as if his fingers will burn the rest away. “Yes, it is.”
Percy sputters.
“Thank you,” Luna says sweetly. “Say, Draco, Ginny might be right. Harry has always had difficulty expressing his true feelings--I fear the wrackspurts tend to plague him much more than most of us.”
Also, they would probably laugh at him.
“I’m—shopping,” he says thickly.
Harry fucking Potter, Savior of the Wizarding World, is asking
They’re thanks to Potter and Potter alone.
Potter offers the wand to Draco.
your owls.”
“That’s a good thing.”
me to ask?”
what that letter says,” Draco says crossly.
"Why didn't I see?" Harry whispers, hating the weak, broken thread of his voice. "I should have been able to help him."
Draco’s breath hitches.
Draco doesn’t even know what he’s thinking anymore.
Potter’s hand is rough and callused, but so much more alive than anything Draco is used to.
“That bad, huh?” Potter asks.
You left me; you
Draco nodded because he was desperate, because answers were not forthcoming, because Pansy always looked so damn
Draco and Percy eye each other warily.
The first time Draco gets his hair cut short, Pansy is the one wielding the scissors.
"Mr. Potter, I understand that--"
“Oh, how I’ve missed you,” she says. She pulls back and pokes him. “You’re so thin, Harry. Have you been eating?”
Blaise takes Draco’s hand, his thumb rubbing Draco’s wrist gently.
“Name?” Hermione asks.
“Why do you care?” Draco explodes.
became an option.
“Why were you in the rain?” Malfoy asks, her voice deceptively soft.
Hermione throws her arms around Harry, and he stares blankly over her shoulder.
it has so much more impact coming from you. This is
"You can't--we can't think about it like this," Ron says. "We can't assign blame."
Draco feels himself burn with shame.
He’s running a charity with Luna for Squibs. Draco knows this barely scratches the surface of the many sins he needs to atone, but it’s a start. With every new donor he finds, he allows himself to add another future meal to his list.
“I don’t think I’ve heard of this one,” he says.
One more night. Draco is selfish enough to want to stay with Harry despite not being able to feel, despite not being able to give Harry what he deserves, but one more night is all that Draco will allow himself.
“I--” Draco swallows and dumps some of the paper and coins on the counter. “Is this enough?”
--he wouldn't do this; he wouldn't
"Keep them," Harry says.
Draco never knows how to put it to words. It’s not that he’s full--it’s an inability to swallow, to even
Draco slams into a wizard and knocks him to the ground. A crunch snaps in Draco’s ears, and Draco’s stomach fills with dread.
Of course, since it’s Draco saying it, Potter will most likely find it an unforgivable offense.
Malfoy sneers at them.
Harry forces a smile. “Sure,” he says, taking Draco’s hand.
An awkward silence falls. Potter looks like he’s struggling to find words to say in response, but the waiter saves him by bringing out their food.
but I just--"
“You need clothes to match,” Blaise jokes.
His hands won’t stop shaking.
“I’m sorry,” Percy says, “you think we should be friends because we both think your fashion sense is deplorable?”
Draco can do this. He may have to skip a few more meals to get it all done, but it’s not the end of the world. Food is a luxury, and luxuries have to be earned.
He could find Blaise or Pansy. Maybe they’ll feel sorry for Draco after all this time. He could crash on their couch.
“Mr. Weasley, is there something you wish to say to the class?” Severus asked in his usual smooth, yet deadly, tone. The professor watched as the Weasley fearfully shook his head and plopped back into his seat looking very sulky about something while Hermione looked embarrassed “now that Mr. Weasley has calmed down we can begin. Today we will be trying something different. We will begin with a quiz” he said before disappearing into the pantry.
The very second the ritual stopped the little boy was swarmed by the adults. Brian got there first and picked up the little boy as Severus and Aster got ready to check him over. Julian was limp, but was alert. Beyond some minor muscle strain he was fine. Even his eyes were fine. Aster’s healing spells showed that the bleeding was just strain from the magic flooding his system. A blood restoring potion, a pain reliever and some healing spells and Julian would be fine even after the numbing spell wears off.
Nutrition potions were done …
"In a heartbeat. Tell me how to help." The godfather said willing to help in anyway ...
Of course the first person to raise her hand was Hermione “leeches, mandrake, mistletoe berries, lionfish spikes. spider webs, black beetle powder and dragon blood” she answered smugly. She smirked when the blonde apprentice reached into a green bottomless bag and tossed her a candy from its depths, but she scowled “I don’t like Cockroach Clusters” she huffed ungratefully. Severus bit the inside of his cheek to keep from laughing at the very subtle symbolism. Harry was clever and knows the two backstabbers better they thought they knew him.
As Severus opened the potions case to get the potion Ragnuk commented “even though you aren’t an employ you do offer your services to us. If any of our other branches need your services you are allowed to leave even internationally. Just thought you should know. May your gold ever grow” he said before leaving as well.
Dumbledore looked at the pile of donations on his desk with a smirk “there’s enough here to get my castle built, but I need to do this carefully”
It was a beautiful evening. The sun was just starting to go down and the stars just starting to peek out. Brian continued walking through the London streets just content feeling the breeze caress his face.
The silver eyed blonde smiled “we’re having a moon room of my own built”
Severus already expected this question and was ready, “Lucius has someone in the Daily Prophet. His friend passed the news along and Lucius sent it straight to me knowing I’d be interested.” He replied calmly.
A fistful was taken and the words ‘Daigon Alley’ were said and the blonde Harry vanished in a burst of green flames …
" Cache and the kneazles broke into a run when they heard the scream that sounded like Draco. They quickly came on a scene that looked like Greg Goyle and Vincent Crabbe actually trying carry Draco down the hall. Of course, a pissed off Blaise was hot on their heels, but they had a very good head start. "I said let me go!" Draco barked and used the very barrier he learned in class to repel them away from him.
Trocar nodded as he wiped the blood away his mouth and, of course, glanced at Frank in concern before turning to his students, "Before any of you panic yes we did attack Cache and as you can see he is fine while we were damaged." Many of the kids looked startled, but the fear gave way to fascination as they saw Cache was fine. "What you saw was an incomplete version of the charm and you simply needed to see that to show you that my fangs can't get through. However, you should never let any creature that poses a threat to even get that close. After all, there's much more danger in just letting anything getting close enough to pick you up and crush you. This is where the other versions of this charm comes in handy for one actually repels any threat that's too close or too fast to pin down. Cache, Lyra and Libra will be helping by feeling your magic to see when you have the right flow of magic with the motion since this isn't an easy charm to see the result of."
“salamander blood and beetle eyes it is!” the blonde nodded happily and added the jar of beetle eyes to the cart. Severus watched the boy put the dragon blood away and pull a vial of salamander blood off the shelves. The potions master moved towards the boy casually and took some porcupine quills. The boy grabbed a large set of empty vials and headed for the check out counter.
care of poor Neville.
“ok, see you soon uncle!” Julian called out and watched as Severus left in a flash of green flames.
“Julian what happened?” Severus asked as he, Silvia and Sophia came running around the corner and saw Quirrell laying out cold on the floor without his turban, which was in the small occamy’s mouth.
of me and the real kicker is that he placed a complex array of mind influencing charms in places I slept. Those ones were mild and left no damage, but that’s not the problem” Harry could see how tense Severus was already … what would happen if he finds out?
“Narcissa asked for you to join us during our winter party. It will be the day before Christmas Eve” Lucius’s eyes narrowed as he looked closer at the professor “have you been getting out more?”
Muscles were stretched …
“yes … much better. What was that thing?” Frank asked as he shot the offending item a glare.
Frank sighed, “Only five vampires were burned. Some werewolves were cut up by the glass, but most of them are alright enough to patrol the area.” He said, but then shifted as if he heard something. In fact, the three dark creatures stiffened as if they heard something and didn’t like it. “I think Mike went into labor … and Jenny.”
The headmaster paled. He tried to find the tracking bonds over and over again, but found nothing “NNNOOOOO!!”
’ the crocodile hummed as the child ran his tiny fingers over her scales ‘
The potion master snorted in amusement. The goblins thought of everything. He shook his head and handed Brian the vial “one drop of your blood needs to be added and then Julian can drink it” he explained secretly hoping those green eyes don’t change.
“back off Weasley”
As the other members took in the information the minister considered the next questions carefully “who was the secret keeper for the Potters?”
Dumbledore smirked, his plans were falling into place nicely. Harry Potter will be his faithful weapon and die to kill Voldemort. Then he will get all the glory … Snape will be dead before he can find out the boy is just being used as a sacrificial lamb. The potions master would be dangerous if he discovered the truth.
floor. When he went to check he didn’t see them at first, but then he decided to check the Janus Thickey Ward. The door in the back of the spell damage floor must always remain locked since the room contains the patients who have suffered permanent damage to the mind. His ring is what allowed the door to open for him and he went in while making sure to shut the door behind him. Despite the ‘keep locked’ rules there were the kneazles, cuddling with two patients.
Finally Severus was allowed to leave. With a simple spell to shrink his papers and put them in his potions bag he flooed to the Australian branch of Gringotts with his bag in hand. He wanted to be prepared in case Julian needed anything. According to the information he researched in Brian’s library it can be painful to remove bindings even if the person is young and there hasn’t been enough time for their magic to build up. Julian has some very expressive accidental magic so this could hurt.
Draco suddenly felt a flare of anger “you told him? How long has he known?” when Draco saw that Harry had to pause to think about it he already knew that the Longbottom heir was trusted with this secret much longer than he has known and it pissed him off for some reason “right whatever. Have fun with your friend” he snapped.
Lucius shook his head “no it’s quite alright … I had no idea that things were so serious. How are any dark creatures able to pay for homes like Eventide?”
A knocking on the door caught their attention “
Isaac smiled as he placed the last fragile glass beaker on the shelf, "I remember. Mom was terrified to let me see the sun and wouldn't let me go out to play like Rosey and Sam. I tried to out run him a get outside one day, but got burned. It wasn't bad, but I cried for a while after that day. Mom tried to comfort me … he told me one day the won't hurt me and you can go play outside. I remember that day … the day you finished it."
’ Julian hissed in parseltongue as they went into the same clearing where Brian set Julian down to see the occamy.
“hmm … some dark items might leave impressions of the past user if the wizard was strong enough … maybe that’s what possessed the DADA Professor … other than that I have no clue. I only just started studying to become the next lord of my family so I don’t know much more than what is taught at school” Neville said sadly feeling like he wasn’t being very helpful.
Severus dropped the wand in shock breaking the spell “Petunia … she was your guardian and Dumbledore …” he trailed off as he mulled this revelation over. He stood up slowly and took a couple steps towards a bookcase though he seemed to not have any interest in it. As if he was moving for the sake of moving “Lily … your mother” Severus began shaking his head softly “she would never have given you to Petunia. That woman is toxic … a toxic, hate filled, jealous shrew … your magical guardian … Dumbledore had no right to put you in Petunia’s claws let alone take money!”
Brian forced a smile to his face “my sentiments exactly. Now I wanted to get this all done at once so to warn you a worker from the wizarding bank called Gringotts is coming. Don’t freak out when he comes, he won’t bite and once its done Harry won’t just be out of your hair, he’ll be half way across the world” the urge to hit Vernon as very strong … the man looked too happy about all of this and so was his wife.
"You'll stay with us." Brian said with a smile. He had a feeling this was a good thing and that Daggerfang was going to make a basilisk related report after they leave so everything was handled …
"It's not like that! We're going with a team of goblins to assist them … and you? I think …" Hermione said not sure why Cache needed to be involved with the third option. The second option made sense because Cache was filling in for Professor Snape, but why the chamber?
A sudden blast cut off the vampire who immediately dropped the subject as the protective shutters exploded. Glass was sent flying everywhere and even sliced up Harry’s cheek before he cast a shield to protect himself and the kneazles. Unfortunately the shield wouldn’t protect Trocar and it seems the situation was even worse than he thought. Harry could hear screams from throughout the complex and realized this wasn’t just one window.
“Australia, came for a vacation … sorry, I’m Brian White, nice to meet you” Brian smiled and shook the pub owner’s hand.
The headmaster dropped the cloak and whimpered as he pointed his wand at his busted nose. He cast a healing spell on his swelling bruised nose resulting in a sharp pop as the nose snapped back in place. After taking a moment to collect himself and casting a cleaning spell that will affect all the blood he bled even in the halls he glared at the fireplace.
The ‘blonde’ sighed “alright, that’s comforting to know, but I still don’t like it” he skimmed through the other transactions … some to Mrs. Weasley and …what is the Order of the Phoenix? An old wizard club or something?
Sanguini licked one of the hickeys on Severus’s inner thigh earning a mewl from the sleeping wizard “mine” he hissed before spooning Severus and watching Severus sleep the entire night …
‘ok … that’s everything … now I just need to send these to Dumbledore” Severus commented as he shrank all of his personal things and put them in his pocket. He picked up all the papers he graded and put them in their own envelope. A brown bag with a light weight charm cast on it was filled with the envelopes and given to the dark colored falcon “take these to Dumbledore. When you’re done, Artemis, meet me at Gringotts” the bird nodded before taking off into the sky through the open window.
The healer in training just sighed dramatically “fine if I must, your majesty” he chuckled as Draco pushed him playfully.
“plenty” Severus ducked a spell. Apparently he startled Narcissa and Lucius because they whirled around and fired at him. Thankfully they finally saw who it was and stopped “oook … you guys are a bit on edge today” the potion master muttered as he stood up.
“green is a color that is close to blue, but I’m more grounded … I’m laid back, but really not the curious or adventurous sort like your Daddy. Swaying in an aura is a sign of control, but no where near the level of control Severus has. Are you ready to see your aura?” Stephen asked knowing the little boy probably wouldn’t want to see the aura around him. The boy was clearly trying not to look at his own body …
panic.
"I'm fine-" The box in Draco's arms suddenly vanished and a young pale teen with dark hair appeared holding that exact box. "Isaac! What are doing here?"
“err … yes, the Dursleys are willingly giving him up for adoption. So first thing in the morning I’m going to Gringotts and getting a goblin to issue both muggle and magical adoption papers. Even if he has a magical guardian it won’t matter if the Dursleys, being blood relatives, sign him over” Brian explained quickly and held his hands up in surrender.
’ Tanzanite chatted casually.
“errr … Petunia spends most of her day high on anti-depressants, Marge makes …
"You've been so brave." A tearful Alice said as she held a crying Neville close. She looked up at Cache and gave a knowing smile. "So very brave."
Harry let go of the doorknob and watched the door swing open revealing several sets red and amber eyes staring back at him …
“oh … hey Severus … no” Harry said still too distracted by the loaming fears to realize it was a joke.
Brian chuckled humorlessly as he heated some water for some tea “that’s a long story and may involve some minor illegal activities like smuggling. Would you like a cup of tea?” Severus nodded and Brian set out two cups of tea before starting his explanation “I have very good instincts. I was labeled a semi-seer as a child because I always had a good feeling about situations and people’s character. After becoming the headmaster of Legerdemain Academy of Sorcery here in Australia I started traveling over the vacation times. This year I decided to try the UK, which sucked, no offense” Severus shrugged it off, he didn’t care “with magical Britain leaving much to be desired I went into muggle world … that’s when I felt a strand of magic from someone who was dying”
used was strengthened by loyalty or at least the lack of will to go against
Trocar lowered his hood letting his red eyes show, "So you decided to run around in your animagus form because of something related to that?"
Cache’s eyes narrowed as he saw the headmaster’s eyes twinkle in delight “no, I have decided to floo back and forth from my apartment. It’s more because I prefer to make potions at home. I will be joining you for meals and will stay until curfew, but not over weekends unless Poppy needs an extra pair of hands. Now …” the blonde stepped aside and Dumbledore was forced out the door by scary growls from the kneazles. Harry noted the look of disappointment in the headmaster’s eyes before being scared off and it confirmed his suspicions. He knew both Poppy and Severus would test positive for loyalty spells once the diagnostic potion was done.
Griphook felt a tingle from the wards around Gringotts and went out of his office to the lobby where he saw a much healthier disguised Potter and two kneazles going for the check in counter “Cache, this way please” a confused Harry turned his way and headed towards him with the kneazles behind him.
Harry heard a silence and risked peeking in. The look of true concern on his professor’s face made him feel safe for once in his life “you’re right. If he seems to need any help would you tell him my name. No one should suffer like that …” Harry ducked back into the ally as Snape looked his way again “… well I must go. I have potions of my own to do, good day Tom”
“you’re only thinking this now?” Severus sneered a little shocked that she didn’t catch on sooner. Hell, he believed the fool was hired because Dumbledore wanted credit for outing a fraud. Anything to get more attention on him. In that way Dumbledore was a lot like Lockhart.
“you had to do so much and we aren’t even at the part where you escaped … was that really Voldemort you met? Dumbledore only announced that you slipped down the stairs doing the brave something that earned you, Ron and Hermione those last minute house points” Neville commented.
The prediction was that they'd be home around Yule …
“yes of course” Lucius handed the vampire the ugly staff eagerly and in an attempt to ease the tense atmosphere he changed to a different topic “so how is everything in Hogwarts?”
“indeed” said Severus as he collected some things to take home “Albus, Potter attempted to discuss something with me before departing”
A sneer made its way to the wizard’s lips “so it seems. He sent Julian into hell and he used this mark to basically blackmail me into staying close as a teacher”
“very good” Lucius said feeling freer than he has in a long time. Once Voldemort was truly dealt with he decided to do something he would never do with the mark on his arm. If the mark disappeared tonight he fully intended to start ratting out the bastards who were imprisoning him and his family through the trackers. They will all pay for hurting his family …
XXXXXXXXXX
“it’s the first present Julian gave me” Draco smiled softly as he ran his fingers through Mickey’s fur gently.
“I know you’re there little one and let me start by saying that you are not a freak and your aunt and uncle gave you to me. You won’t be in their care anymore nor will you be hurt by them ever again … would you like to join me out here? I will not hurt you” Brian waited silently without moving until he heard the soft shifting of little feet. He slowly looked over and smiled at the far to tiny four year old who didn’t have the wolf now “hello little one, would you like to bring your friend out too? He seems lonely under the bed”
XXXXXXXXXX
Harry first gave the owl some food before turning his attention back to the package. His eyes widened as he opened the package and saw a deep blue stone with streaks of other colors “a moonstone” he smiled and placed the rare potion gem on the shelf. True quality moonstones for potions are very rare. It meant a great deal that Severus would give him something like this … the young wizard really wished the potion master reacts well when it’s time to remove the loyalty spells. It won’t be much longer now … he switched to working next weekend with Poppy so he and Severus can do the last steps for the potion for diagnosing problems. Ironically the potions for removing the mind controlling spells take only a day to brew so this will be done soon.
The cauldron was cleaned and put into Snape’s bag since he was determined to find a cauldron of his own …
Sirius shot up to his feet in a rage “I’ll kill them!”
Draco sat in his bedroom thinking back over the years. He had just turned 11 recently and so did his friend Julian. They both just completed their MOEs in the end of the last school year and were now enjoying the summer while trying to think about the Dragon exams in four years. It’s these recent or future thoughts that made him think of the past and how things changed.
Harry slowly turned back to the door …
“next time you find the chance ask him what happens when you stand under mistletoe. Muggles have to do something … I can’t recall what, but we use mistletoe so it’d be a nice place to start” Ginny explained and giggled after Draco simply nodded and walked away …
Brian simply sighed and ran his fingers through his dirty blonde hair “blimey … I haven’t seen so many robes since the graduation ceremony and I’m supposed to get away from school hmmm … maybe the muggle side will be less … stuffy” it disturbed him a bit when he heard people calling snake speakers evil or insulting people who came from non-magical families. He personally had nothing but respect for non-magical people. He couldn’t imagine being without his magic.
In all honesty Severus thought it was good news, but he noticed the blank look on Cache’s face and it got him thinking. Harry wasn’t the type of person to stand back and let people get hurt or let people get killed and yet he didn’t speak up in two instances. The one where Armel broke the potion master’s wrist and the Dursleys. He recalled the look on Harry’s face when he was healing the broken wrist. It was blank just like now and Harry didn’t show too much emotion concerning the Dursleys’ demise. What if Harry wanted to say something, but didn’t? Why? The only common link was the creatures …
With a full stomach he sat down and watched the two furry kneazles curl up next to him on the couch and fall asleep. Hedwig perched on the armrest next to him “Gringotts will be sending owls to me so don’t worry if a strange owl appears in the attic. Apparently Dumbledore has his tentacles in my parent’s money and has lied to me about so many things”
Without another word he kicked the large bread loaf into the room. As they scrambled for it he spelled the waste filled bucket empty and used a water spell to fill the water bucket with water before shutting the door …
Sanguini shrugged “it’s right this way”
“GINNY!” Fred, George and surprisingly Percy all yelled as they ran over to her. The second they saw the blood running down their baby sister’s split lip. All eyes turned to stare at Ron who was frozen in fear as the kneazle stretched her claws warning him not to move
The headmaster hid the papers in his robes before turning around “I happen to be-“ Dumbledore gaped as he turned to see the very blonde blue eyed brat he met days ago and he clearly put on plenty of weight … all of it being in muscle and he was taller too. Just inches away from being the same height as the headmaster. If the icy blue eyes glaring at him wasn’t intimidating enough the claws on the kneazles were …
Ami, the brown owl that once held the identity of a certain pure white owl flew towards them and perched on the rail as the kneazles stretched out on the balcony to enjoy the sun Harry gently petted the soft feathers on his owl’s chest ”Neville knows about what’s going on and since you allowed me to live he seems less afraid of potions class … well a little bit, but he’ll warm up to you one he sees your sweet cuddly side” Harry commented chuckling at the glare he got in return. A peaceful silence lapsed between them until a few fireworks coming from Diagon alley shattered it. It was a party for the book sale of Gilderoy Lockhart’s books, Hogwarts’ new DADA professor ”how will this be handled? Harry Potter isn’t returning to Hogwarts”
Well … it wouldn’t hurt to check at least …

Severus nodded “Julian told him personally”
“that’s one of my personality traits that you were always right about. I’ll start dinner unless you want to sleep” Harry said.
“that vampire only wants me as a personal blood bank” Severus said confidently. He was sure that’s what it was. Why else would the vampire landlord be trying to tempt him at every turn? When Severus moved in he was given expensive chocolates. Next came the necklaces with the powerful gems. Just this morning he found a box of rare and expensive potion ingredients. Clearly Sanguini wanted only one thing … blood!
Harry set his glowing ankle on his other leg while holding the button in his left hand. His right hand hovered over the tainted ankle and he said the incantation. It was clear now why Hedwig shuddered before … having a tracking charm slowly pulled off was painful. Not terrible, but it was definitely an unpleasant burning sensation.
“I’ll come back soon. I’m only going to Knockturn Alley, but you guys should stay here” Harry felt a little prickle of guilt as his kneazles whined wanting to come with him, but he wasn’t going to risk taking them to a place with vampires or in this weather in their condition. Besides they already looked tired from the days events …
“mentor?” Dumbledore twitched.

It took a couple hours just to get to the Weasley and the goblin level scan did not show what he expected. Arthur wasn’t surprised that the scan on the drop of blood he gave potions came up, but the scan on his mind revealed some gaps where memories were locked up.
Trocar was silent as he sat on the ground and Cache joined him “it was about 550 years ago … I was just leaving class when my brother came asking for money. He was always hopeless with money. Constantly gambling and drinking. However I was a teacher and had just lent him money a week prior so I had nothing to give him … I didn’t know what hit me until it was far too late … my brother shot a curse at me once my back was turned and no one would see. Though I was stunned I knew he was beating me … “
magic, which means we are capable of it in more controlled situations. In fact it is natural since wands were only invented relatively recently if you think about it and before that it was all wandless. Magic is natural for us and it wants to defend its host you just need to forget the wand mindset and connect with it. You must’ve read about breaking spells cast on you, right?” Cache asked a little puzzled as to why Hermione can devour all those books, but remain resistant to contradicting facts. Is she even reading them right?
Trocar blinked as he felt the warm tingle on his body, “Harry … what did you make?” He asked in shock before a buzz echoed through the walls. “Good, the backup system is up.” He muttered still looking at his skin.
Not long after Neville left the next morning Harry pulled out his experimental potion and applied it to several more scars …
“I’m speaking”
The young wizard was surprised that he felt calmer than he has ever been around the intimidating professor and smiled “it’s good to meet you sir, would you care to order something too?”
“you think so-” Cache jolted as he heard a very subtle hiss coming from the cauldron on the far table “it’s done”
No one saw Cache flinch slightly. That was something he deeply regretted. Yes, Draco was an ass when he wanted to be, but no one should’ve gone through that. Having your offer of friendship rejected must’ve hurt, but to have it happen in front of all your classmates … he knew that hurt Draco and Harry wanted to make amends someway. He started by never out right asking for a favor in the future like he planned. One look at Draco and he just couldn’t ask and since Griphook never said anything Harry let it go.
The twins Brian is afraid of are the potions teachers for all years and they also assist in sex ed to present birth control potions … they can be pranksters too when they are mad and their main pet peeve is when someone they know seeks out potions from someone else …
“so I can come and go as I please?” when the goblin nodded in affirmative Julian looked at his Dad looking for permission.

All Harry did was roll his eyes good naturedly as he went to the kitchen and opened the bottle filled with a red potion. Severus watched as drops of the potion were applied to the hair, eyes and a spot on his forehead revealing the real features of Harry Potter. There was something, however, about Harry and Armel. The classic bird nest of Potter hair was nicely tamed into soft waves, the height of the boy already came close to surpssing any known height of a Potter and the outrageous glasses were gone, but now there was a remarkable resemblance between the potion master’s apprentice and the tall vampire. If he imagined the red vampire eyes as green they would look like father and son. It was probably just coincidence, but Severus filed that away in the back of his mind just in case.
When the headmaster finally recovered his senses he felt that Harry had stopped He won’t let the brat get away, but just as he was about to apparate he paled … the Potter started moving even faster and before anything could be done …
“Moody … maybe we should start farther back … lets return to the UK, but lets not tell Albus. School just started so he’d be too busy” Remus said strangely compelled to return and start searching there without telling Dumbledore. Moody believed that it was a wise idea and agreed …
Presents were given one at a time and Harry loved each one. He got several books, rare potion ingredients and several other things. Trocar gave Harry his own daggers with a snake carved into the hilt. No one had a problem with the wizard being able to speak to snakes. Apparently it was more popular than people thought … of course after Voldemort who would admit that they have that talent? Greyback knew two paresltongue speakers who were foreigners so it was out there.
“very funny” Severus scoffed and looked around the place. The old building was massive. Four stories of solid stone, but it looked more modern than Hogwarts. They were in the courtyard, which was encompassed by the building on three sides. There was a large glass dome on top of the building that was a greenhouse and observatory. In the courtyard was the fountain and as you walk to the building you first go under some arches that has a large wall of floos. If you flooed here you’d be greeted by the beautiful courtyard. This was Legerdemain Academy of Sorcery “I’ll go get the Malfoys, don’t let Mickey fall in the water Julian” he warned before heading for the floos.
Unfortunately the child’s magic flared up again and the forks started dancing with the spoons. Brian couldn’t resist laughing at the sight, which did calm Harry down. After all no one laughed at his ‘freakish doings’ as Petunia calls them and that was a turning point for them. Harry finally feeling safe with Brian. For a while Harry was afraid that the man he liked, the man he wanted as his Daddy, would get rid of him once he found out how big of a freak he was, but that hasn’t happened. No bout of accidental magic or anything swayed the man. Harry was so happy to have someone truly want him …
“so we don’t have to hurt him right?” the three adults blinked and looked down at Julian who somehow snuck up on them. It didn’t take much to realize that the little boy broke the muffling charm “right Daddy?” Julian looked up at them with big pleading green eyes. Severus may have been terrified of the thought that Voldemort was still alive, but even he gave up fighting those green eyes.
An exasperated sigh slipped passed Lucius’s lips “Hogwarts doesn’t teach elemental magic or mind training” he commented as he watched his son “Draco … would you like to go to school with Severus’s godson?”
“what about Harry? Is’t he-” Minerva faltered at the look on Severus’s face as he spotted something outside the window “Severus?”
“apart?” Arthur pondered a moment, but Ron was sure the fool wouldn’t agree to separating family for the summer or holidays “Ginny would you have any problem staying with Bill or Charlie?”
“oh … well if you’re sure” Minerva said still not wanting to take it, but her suspicions of how Lockhart got his job despite Albus’s brilliance won over her suspicions of the potion itself. She took the potion not noticing the wand behind Severus’s back and drank it. A moment of nothing passed before she noticed her mind clearing and sure enough her anger rising.
"You know, it's also the reason you have a sister … and the reason your mom could never become hands on with making the cure. Though, it did give an excuse to never teach again." Harry chuckled making Isaac quirk a curious brow.
The witch blinked in shock and leaned out the door to check if any patients needed her. Since everything looked like it was less busy she went over to Cache’s station and watched the process she has done many times herself. She was impressed to say the least. The blonde boy kept his station perfectly clean and seemed to know once the potion changed phases for the next step without even looking at the potion!
“just answering a question” Cache said with a smile as he turned the mistletoe twig back into a quill and put it away, but said nothing more as Dumbledore flounced in seeming happy about something.
Both students understood that barb. The goblin was comparing them to Dumbledore! That can't be right! Dumbledore was far worse! He ignored peoples' safety and manipulated everyone with lies to get what he wanted where they only ignored Harry's abuse and pretended to be his friend to get paid. At first they thought it sounded different, but the more they thought about it they started drawing some sickening parallels and it scared them.
“oh Harry … I … I’m so sorry!” Poppy whimpered tearfully. Harry pulled the witch into a hug trying to comfort her “I’ll help however I can … if I get my hands on that old fool I’ll wring his neck” she threatened making Harry chuckle.
“don’t worry Julian, there’s nothing to be afraid of. There are still some club activities going on so we’ll see a bit of how things work around here as you get a look at where your classes will be” Brian said as he gently ruffled the little boy’s hair, which was nearly identical to his own.
Harry fumbled in the dark to find his feathered friend and stroke her soft feathers for comfort … for both of them “I need to calm down or this won’t work” he whispered as he heard his family settle down to sleep.
Severus’s eyes narrowed “we talked about what was to happen if you found Tom’s main fragment Julian. You were supposed to talk to us first before confronting the piece of soul that was basically the dark lord” Severus said seriously.
“Julian!” Draco yelled as he spotted them through a window about two stories above his spot on the castle walkway between towers. He and the others, who were with him, met them at the bottom of the stairs.
“yes … no … it’s hard to explain … there’s Honeydukes and I’m paying, no arguments” Draco said firmly giving Cache a serious glare.
Narcissa winced, "He'll try to find you at Sirius's place first. You can stay with us until Severus calms down-" A knocking sound on the door made them freeze.
“hold on one second little one” Brian slid off the couch to join Harry on the floor and took one of the pieces of papers Harry didn’t color on. The headmaster held it between Harry and the toy snake blocking the mini basilisk from view even though Mickey was pawing the paper playfully “now try talking” Brian said softly.
The two wizards followed Draco's eyes to the apartment door and saw that it was wide open with several creatures watching them. The only one that moved was Sanguini who simply pulled Severus close, but the look in his eyes was the same as the others. They were all willing to help ...
There’s a long beat in which neither of them say a word. Draco feels like he’s going to throw up. Or cry. Or throw himself off the nearest cliff and let the sweet oblivion of death swallow him whole.
But something about the thought of the only other trans person he knows calling him by his deadname is just . . . unpalatable.
“Nevertheless, that’s what
“—fine. I’m just—“
Draco stares at Potter with confusion.
A potion would be better. A potion would hurt less.
Draco sits at home and stares at his list. He has run out of names.
“Easy for you to say. You’re the Chosen One, the Boy Who Lived. I’m the guy who joined the Dark Lord and tried to kill Dumbledore.”
stop slapping me while you make fun! We have a lot in common—
Harry kneels  and pulls a small, velvet box from his pocket. Draco stares, his chest heaving.
“Your taste in music is trash,” Blaise continues, beginning to strut around the room and imitate Potter’s voice. “I’ll attempt to give it a go, though, because I have nothing better to do. Kidding. It’s actually quite nice—it reminds me of when we were at Hogwarts and some of the students would do choir and whatnot. Peaceful, if a bit pretentious.”
but I've realized--" Harry digs one hand into the dirt. Grass has already begun to grow, and the slender blades shiver against his palm. "I hated you," Harry whispers, his voice breaking.
Harry rests their hands on Draco’s thighs, the warmth of his weight grounding Draco. They’re so
“Yesterday,” Draco says. “I’m fine.”
“Prat,” Harry mutters, stepping out of the dressing room to see if the shirt meets Percy’s approval.

"He wouldn't want you to blame--"

Pity.
At the checkout, before Ginny can pay for Harry’s gift, Draco opens his wallet.
“I’m sorry,” Potter says. “I should have given it back a long time ago, but—“
“Consider it a thank you gift,” Draco says.
No. Draco is in Diagon Alley. He’s in Diagon Alley, and everyone is either pointedly staring or ignoring his presence completely, and Aunt Bella is dead.
Lucius is rolling over in his grave right now. Not that Draco cares. And not like it matters, because Potter isn’t doing anything, and it’s completely normal for Potter’s hand to fit against Draco’s waist and for Draco to slip his fingers through Potter’s hair and—
To Draco, food tastes like dust. He tries to swallow, but he can barely place a bite on his tongue, let alone chew.
Ron. You should consider a career in counseling."
“Sure thing,” Aaron says.
“You look like a prick,” Blaise says once he and Draco are walking out the door. “A rich white boy who runs to Daddy whenever times get tough.”
It’s not that alcohol turned him into someone else. It’s just that it lowered all his filters and showed who he truly was (an idiot).
His father keeps owling him
“Now you and Draco match,” she says brightly.
“Well, you’re not too traumatizing to look at,” Draco says.
Potter sighs and finally looks at Draco. He cannot help feeling like a bug under a scientist’s watchful gaze.
Draco doesn’t have an eating disorder.
Whatever. Draco can always strangle them tomorrow.
Draco groans and buries his face in his arms.
And something inside feels a little bit lighter.
“I know.”
Potter surveys Draco with wide, unblinking eyes, no doubt cataloguing everything wrong with Draco’s appearance.
of feeling like this, of not being enough, of failing time and time again.
“I’m trans,” Harry says cheerfully.
Potter steps back, holding the door open.
“Do it,” Draco says.
He knows the perfect gift to give.
Draco abandons his shopping trip and flees home.
"Harry! HARRY!"
"But shouldn't I have
“No, this was
“Someday you’re going to find someone that can give you everything you want,” Ginny says.
He deserves it. He knows that, but he’s so tired of not being able to do anything about it.
came out, and I want to support you, and I worry that I’m just being transphobic—“
Draco stares straight ahead, his eyes burning. It is taking every speck of self-control for him to keep from crying, but he has no idea how long he will be able to keep it up.
The first time Potter touches Draco (truly, properly touches him in a way that has nothing to do with the threats and curses that pervaded their Hogwarts years), it’s at the end of Draco’s trial. Potter offers Draco his hand, and Draco stares at it stupidly for a solid five seconds.
Maybe he sees something in Draco’s eyes because, all of a sudden, Potter is looking at him with ill-disguised pity.
“She won’t answer my owls.”
Draco Malfoy deserves nothing.
Except Draco doesn’t really want to leave because that means the cold streets and an empty stomach and sneers from wizards and witches he doesn’t even know. Better to be bloody in a warm flat than out on the street, his blood freezing on the sidewalk.
Somehow, this exchange turns into Draco agreeing to meet Potter for dinner. Except . . . today is Thursday. Yesterday was Wednesday. On Wednesday, Draco’s column of bad things far exceeded that of his good things, so he
Draco starts to compose two columns each night, one detailing every bad thing he did during the day and the other detailing all the good. So long as the good things outweighs the bad, Draco gives himself permission to eat the next day.
He’s always burning around Potter.
“Are you upset they’re dating?”
“Keep the change,” Draco says and walks out before she can respond.
They don’t really talk for the first half hour. Malfoy studiously works through her first plate of waffles without a word, and Harry follows her example. Then, halfway through her second plate of waffles which have fucking
He’s trying. The problem is,
“As in, money?” Draco asks. “Or publicity?”
Draco (so, so, so much blood).
Draco places his hands along the curves of Harry’s face and kisses him.
Harry doesn’t know silk from polyester, despite Percy’s many exasperated attempts to teach him. But it looks like an expensive dress—the fabric is filmy and shifts colors under the light, like the way a forest blurs into different shades of green from far away.
“Do you actually want this?” Draco asks hesitantly.
He nods. As much as Charlie’s grip will allow.
Harry picks up his hand and kisses the palm.
Some of the marks were more than half healed, but many were still raw. Harry poured a few drops of the oily brown liquid onto his fingertips. There were too many stripes to count, crossing over one another, colored with bruises fading in tones of green and mottled yellow; a web of misery inflicted as punishment for failing to do evil.
“He’ll kill me. Before term starts he’ll kill me,” Draco whispered. “He wants me again before dinner… Severus, it hurts

He says it in that off-hand way that he uses when he is avoiding saying something that is truly terrible. He says it in that way that makes Draco want to storm over to the Dursley’s house—Draco’s take the trouble to learn where it is—and torture them with the most vicious, most excruciating, Cruciatus curse he can muster.
He feels his heart beat... once... twice... three times... then he turns Harry’s hand over. And gently presses a kiss into his palm.
“You’re all right, Malfoy.”
“Easy, Malfoy. You’re okay. That silencing curse was a nasty one. It might take a day or so to wear off completely.”

“Hermione, I think I would spoil them rotten.” His heart takes flight at the thought. “If there’s one good thing my parents taught me, it’s how to spoil a child.”

Harry and Malfoy had been antagonizing each other since the day Ron had met them both on the train to Hogwarts. And yet… Harry had cried real tears at the idea he had nearly killed him that day in the bathroom… and again when he told him how Malfoy had lowered his wand that night on the Astronomy Tower.
At the front door, he stops.

“I didn’t scream,” Draco said.

It’s a pleasant thought—to use the money to restore Malfoy Manor to the safe, sun-soaked home of his childhood memories.

Harry still doesn’t like to cook, but he had discovered the joys of bread-making. And a loaf of warm-from-the-oven bread, along with a pile of fresh greens, will turn even the simplest bowl of soup into a delicious, hearty meal.
Draco took the broth, the cup was warm in his hands, and inhaled. It smelled wonderful, but his stomach wasn’t entirely sure about it, and he sipped gingerly. Warmth flooded him, and he began to shiver.
They take turns cooking.

The fingers tasted disgustingly—and enticingly—of pickled herring and Draco was appalled to find that they reminded him of how very hungry he was.
She doesn’t seem to stop, even to breathe, much less eat, though the food is disappearing from her plate at an alarming rate. Who knew eight-year-olds could eat so much?
“I don’t like coffee.”
“Who? Ginny?” Potter sounds startled. “Ginny’s not my girlfriend. We broke up ages ago.”
“I know. But I promised. And, actually, Malfoy, you look like you could just fall over at any second. I can’t just let you drown in the tub.”
“Did grandmother teach my mother, too?” Harry ventured.

The force of his landing drove all the remaining air from his lungs. He gasped, unable even to cry out, as the cell door closed with a very final crash. He was in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor… cold, alone, and bleeding. Agony flooded him, body and soul.
“I see that you are acquainted with Mr. Malfoy… but protocol is protocol,” he says, handing back the license.
I think it might be approaching
“I… but…”
“What is Master Draco needing?” Kreacher asked. “Kreacher will make a dinner befitting…”

“Yes, thank you, mother.”
Draco kneels to pull weeds while Lisbeth lies down in the sunshine, her head resting on outstretched paws. She’s not asleep and her dark eyes are alert and watchful.
Charlie’s beside him now, cradling him to his chest. “But you don’t like it?”
Charlie’s body is muscled and golden and lightly dusted with hair the color of sunrises. There are freckles… and so many scars: the shiny patches of healed burns on his hands and arms, raised lines that Harry can find, even with his eyes closed, and dozens of spots of silver that disappear when he blinks, or when the light from the fire shifts. Charlie’s body is strong enough that it can rise above him, supporting itself for hours while Charlie kisses him, while he moves slowly inside him, reducing Harry’s whole world to a touch… a taste… a soft groan of pleasure.
He didn’t mean to say
I don’t want Victoire to go to sleep and end this perfect evening. I don’t want Draco to go home.
“But something,” Potter said firmly. “What about… ice cream? Chocolate ice cream?”
With unerring gentleness, Harry traced each hurt, and one by one, they faded away at his touch.
“Not sweet
“What about yours?”
Harry tastes like beer, dark and bitter.

A few laws, hastily-drafted and quickly-passed, and they got it.
Ron shook his head and backed slowly out of the room, replacing the silencing spell as he went.
Harry’s words are soft… and not always entirely coherent. But it is Harry. Harry who smells like sunshine… Harry who is running his thumb gently along Draco’s cheekbone… Harry who is thrusting into his hand… Harry who is whispering, “
When the Floo chimes, Fleur doesn’t look particularly surprised to see Draco sitting in my kitchen. She looks tired and her usual golden glow has a faint silver tinge to it. But she doesn’t look like she’s had bad news, either.
Harry’s eyes are wide and green and maybe a little hurt.

He moans appreciatively as the man thrusts into him… and tries to pretend that the man isn’t too sweaty… too hairy… too much smelling of stale garlic and expensive aftershave.
Draco shudders.
me… and you’ll be careful and patient and so gentle.”
I return it, I think. Then I lean down, like it is the most natural thing in the world, which suddenly it is, and kiss Victoire’s forehead.
Sleep was easy, it was staying awake that was difficult now. Hunger was his constant companion, but he could rarely bring himself to present himself in the dining room.
Popular opinion said they deserved it. Popular opinion may have even been right. Draco threads his free hand into Harry’s hair and lets him rest there.
Draco can feel the sneer falling from his face. He hesitates a moment, and then whispers a price that will buy him, maybe, a couple of days’ worth of meals.
The piles of dirty laundry have disappeared.
“I can’t refuse a client… I can’t displease a client. If you turn me away… it doesn’t matter why, really. They’ll punish me.” Draco’s voice is small.
As if I wouldn’t believe them.
Still…

Draco stands up to retrieve the letter. It would be addressed to Harry, but Isolde isn’t fond of letting Harry touch her.
“You don’t have to… you could… stay here. Forever, I mean.” Harry likes having Malfoy here. He feels

Draco knows that Potter’s funds are, essentially, limitless, but he’s not surprised to find him not living in some version of Malfoy Manor. He remembers Potter after the War, the last time he saw him… the haunted look that had settled deep in his eyes, and Draco thinks that he wouldn’t have been completely shocked to find him living in a tent in a deserted wood somewhere.
Harry kisses him again. Softer this time, almost tentative.
Which he won’t. Draco will make sure of it.

“Every single day. I never stopped.”
... and I don’t care who knows... or what they say about it.”
“Harry… are you okay?”
“It’s such a pleasure to see you…”
… but in the end, it’s Harry’s shoulder that he touches.
“And did you do this thing?”
He has forty-five minutes to shower and change and get to work.
“When I was a kid… sometimes if I couldn’t eat dinner… I’d wait until the Dursleys were asleep and then sneak into the kitchen to make sandwiches. Lots of time it was just cold ham and cheese or something, but if I could… toasty meatloaf sandwiches were my favorite.”
He holds out his arm for the Dark Lord. He watches, expressionless, as lines of black twist and burn through his flesh, forming themselves into the skull and snake. He doesn’t utter a sound.
“Why would you want a motorbike?” he asks instead. “Those things are death traps.” He rolls over, pinning Harry underneath him. “You’ll get killed.”
He turns back to the bed… back to Harry… and places a lingering kiss on his forehead, his lips just brushing the edge of his lightening scar. Harry doesn’t wake, but his lips turn up into a little smile that nearly finishes off Draco’s already bursting heart.

“I wasn’t exactly sure what you’d like,” he says, adding a carton of creamy spinach and another of spicy lentils and cauliflower to the row. “I wasn’t even sure… you might be a vegetarian.”
Harry is surprised by his utter confidence in his answer and he pulls back a little. Charlie lets him go.
“It’s all right, Victoire,” Draco says, his voice soft. He’s knelt in front of her. “Harry’s here to take you home. Your mother had to go, quite urgently, to France to see your grandparents.”
“You’d do it then? Use magic to save them? Even if it meant Azkaban?”
There are two teacups on the tea tray.
“Peppermint, please,” Harry says. His voice sounds small.

owl… but even though he doesn’t have to, and even though he’s ancient, he is still willing to carry Draco’s mail.
He falls silent, and Draco finds he doesn’t have anything to add. The only sounds come from the scraping of knives and forks on plates, and a slow, steady drip of water into the sink.
So out of four brothers-in-law and four sisters-in-law… it was me, neither brother nor in-law, who received the panicked owl requesting that I retrieve Victoire from school and keep her… well, obviously, Fleur couldn’t put a timetable on it.
The money just wasn’t
“Draco?”
He is sticky, and the room smells musky. There is another smell, too, one that is familiar and perfect and one that he never wants to stop breathing in.
“I love you, too.” Harry’s voice is so soft… so soft, but it is the world.
“There’s always somebody to save, yeah? Ron told me to find

“You’re moving out?” Draco asks, suddenly feeling as though the world has tipped, alarmingly, to one side.
“Harry, I’m so sorry…”
“Finish making breakfast, Harry,” he says. Gentler now. “I’ll take care of this.”
“You need to use your fingers,” she said, “to hold the hem flat.”
Bill, who’s been working in Egypt all week, is meeting her in France.
“I have been.” Victoire preens. “I’ve done drawings, too. Would you like to see them?”
Weasley smiles and shakes his head. “You have to know that once Harry finally confided in us, he couldn’t stop talking about you. He loves you; that makes you family to me and Hermione. We would have stopped at nothing to bring you home.” Weasley stops abruptly. “I would go out and

“I will hear anything you want to tell me.” Harry’s fingers tighten on his. “Now… or later. Whenever you want.”
Draco stops. Abruptly aware that his words have lost any hint of flirtation. He is shaking and he can’t quite catch his breath.
My hands are still shaking.
And he finds that doesn’t mind at all.
Draco expected to wake up feeling strong. Or at least stronger.

He swallows and takes Antonie’s side again. “It’s true that Jamaica has an excellent keeper,” he says, “but that’s not going to be enough to beat Egypt.”
“I… I…”
Draco’s heart does a little leap; he’s going to have fun with this.
“He really hurt you.”

It isn’t.
Had they really thought they could get away with it?
“I don’t know, exactly,” Draco says. “I do have a couple of theories, though. The most likely of which is that, since they cannot survive without a living host, viruses co-evolved with humans… and that wizards and Muggles are different enough that viruses are simply unable to cross between the populations. Bacteria, of course, live everywhere—and are mostly harmless. However, certain bacteria, in certain environments can multiply in a way that can make a person—wizard or Muggle—very sick.”
“Or this?” Draco reaches around to thumb Harry’s nipple, making him arch further back into Draco’s arms.
At first Harry thinks Malfoy is reaching for his face… his cheek, or maybe his chin… and Harry longs to feel the cool brush of those fingers. Maybe he

“Why would she have even tried?” Weasley wanted to know.

Draco lets himself take a deep breath and let it out slowly before raising his head. “No,” he says, unwinding himself from the blanket. “Thanks. But… I have things to do.”
Harry let him.
The bed in the white, windowless room will never really be clean, no matter how many
He forces himself to look up… to look at Harry… afraid of what he’s going to see.
That first day… He remembers Weasley’s calm voice telling him he was okay… and how every time Weasley repeated it, he

“I’m not sure it always works like that,” Draco says. “And you really have been busy. Saving the world and all that.”
At the moment, it’s the head of the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures who has him face down, arse up, on silk sheets.
“I see.” He’s using his professional voice again.
Harry’s own flannel pants are damp, and Draco rubs his thumb over the head of Harry’s cock.
“I know, mate.” Ron swallowed. “But you can’t just go rushing into Malfoy Manor and rescue him either.”
… and, still…
He can, Draco realizes. He
“Nope.” Harry’s change of position doesn’t seem to alter his determination to kiss every inch of Draco, and he trails little bites up his neck. “I’m gonna wear my helmet.” He kisses along Draco’s jaw. “And my leather jacket. And boots. And tight leather pants.”
“It doesn’t really look like you do them at all,” he says, laughing a little.
“Death Eaters are not welcome at St. Mungo’s.” She sounds more bored than hateful. “You’ll have to leave.”
Weasley has almost reached the house when Draco looks back up. “But, Weasley? Could you get rid of that paper?”
“He hurt me.” Draco is quiet for a moment. “A lot of people hurt me, though.”
Draco will permit only one answer to that question. And, without bothering with the deep breath, he simply takes that last step off the stoop and onto the street.
“No,” I admit. “Not always. Sometimes I

He rose, slower this time, and turned to face the Dark Lord.
~*~*~*~
Blaise… Draco takes a moment to wonder if his attacker was, somehow, encouraged by the idea that he had spent the last half of fifth year snogging Blaise in secluded corners all over the castle. Their relationship wasn’t exactly common knowledge… but it wasn’t a secret either.
“He’s just finishing up, I think.”
“Some Muggles are very clean, you know.” Harry’s voice sounds odd. “My aunt’s hands certainly never looked like that. Anything that would have gotten her hands dirty, she made me do. All the gardening… most of the cleaning. When she made me scrub out the oven my hands would be black for a week… or burned red from the chemicals…”
“I… was wondering… if you’d… like to come over for dinner again. Tonight? I really wanted to cook for you…”
“Can I kiss you again?”
In two strides, Harry is across the kitchen. He yanks open a cupboard door and pulls out a glass and a bottle of wine. He pours wine into the glass, gulps a bit, and then throws the glass as hard as he can against the wall.
“I love you, Harry Potter,” Draco says, pushing Harry back on the rock… straddling him… kissing him gently, but only at first. “You don’t make any fucking sense, but I love you.”

He’s leaning on the sink, the water he’s splashed himself with still running. The man staring back at him is drained of color… just green eyes staring out of a face he doesn’t recognize.
Harry is gone, too, but that hardly matters. He left tea, under a warming charm, and buttered toast,

She peers at the three neatly-dressed boys behind Draco and they nod.
“Tonight… I didn’t. You fell.” He’s still watching the fire.
He expected the Mark to be raised, to feel it rough against his lips—but all he feels is the softness of Draco’s inner arm.

Not since that first morning has Draco spent any time imagining who

Draco’s eyes are dark, and they meet mine with a smile that looks lost and hungry and peaceful all at once.
The door shuts behind them.
The owl hoots again, almost reproachfully, sticking out a leg.
“Are you sure?”
Malfoy nods—maybe he’s answering the question Harry didn’t ask, maybe it’s only a gesture of intensity as the music swells.

If Draco wants to leave every light in the shop on all night long he, technically, can.
The eggs are perfect. Three bites in, Draco has to admit it. Out loud.
“Oh, that’s rich, coming from you,” Harry says, pulling on schoolboy sniping to get him through the exchange.  “I don’t suppose you’ve looked in a mirror lately.”
“Erm… Tuesday, I think?”
“I’ll see you in a couple of hours.” Draco squeezes his arm and walks out the door.

It may be that he really is the only one who knows that he was raped in the dark halls of his own home… and if this information is something that Draco still keeps for himself, he is not going to give it away.
“Is Pansy still ignoring you?” Blaise whispers when Draco enters the salon, a different one from last time.

His house arrest is over, but sometimes Draco still feels like he’s trapped. He’s out of money (out of time, out of help, out of friends), and he has nowhere to go.

Draco stared at the first article he had seen about Percy longer than he likes to admit. The reporter had interviewed Percy, who described realizing he was actually, well . . .

ordered a hamburger. No wonder Potter looked surprised.
The problem is, the longer this goes on, the less motivated he feels. He can barely force himself to get out of bed in the morning, let alone leave his house. The more he lazes around in bed, the less work he gets done.

The Malfoy smirked and pointed down at the two kneazles at his feet “they came to get me” Harry blinked in shock, he didn’t even notice the kneazles leave his side, but then he didn’t notice much beyond the bloody mob of people so he just shrugged it off and patted both fluffy kneazles “bloody brilliant kneazles” Draco handed over a selection of kneazles treats and Cache pulled out the feeding bowls so Lyra and Libra could eat. Finally the two wizards sat down to get their own ice cream “hand me the bag. I bought a few jars of a marshmallow syrup called Bat Blood Soup”

“How can you say that after what he did?!” One of the other girls yelled furiously.

"Why did you come back?" Trocar asked quietly.
Even though it was just a crack the door was open and that meant the privacy seals were off …
“Severus” Sanguini said softly catching the potion master’s attention “I’ve lived for hundreds of years. I know when people fear me or my kind even when they try to hide it. You don’t actually fear me even when I have you like this, which is rather odd, but I think I know why you keep trying to push me away” he leaned over so his mouth was almost against the potion master’s neck “and you shouldn’t fear that”
“I knew this would happen eventually, but … I don’t think I want Harry Potter to return. It’s nothing. We should go to the chamber. Griphook sent me this portkey to summon them. The room the last horcrux was in had a secret way in so retrieving it was easy, but they can’t go to the bathroom since Dumbledore might catch them. I’m just supposed to get them passed the two doors and let them deal with the rest” Cache said as he showed them the portkey made from a small stone bead complete with the Gringotts seal.
“no kidding” Frank muttered as Harry started cleaning a cut on the wizard’s shoulder after brushing off the smoldering embers “the guy is very strong … where did he go and what did he destroy though?”
The young apprentice felt Armel squeeze his shoulder gently as Trocar’s hand never moved from the spot on his back and Frank, surprising enough, remained silent “you did … I would’ve come off as easily swayed for I fell for all the basic gossip and was overly trusting of the wrong people-”

“Am I not supposed to know you go by Draco?” Harry asks blankly.
“You say that word a lot.”
“Dope,” Ron says, offering his fist for Harry to bump. Harry gladly accepts.
