Soon Draco's robes were ripped apart and his legs forcefully spread. Without even a warning or any preparation, his entrance penetrated.  Draco did not struggle any more because he had already given up. He remembered how he was taken the first time. It was forcefully, cruel, messy, filthy. It was pure animalistic behaviour. There was no love, no feeling , just lust. It was the day he was captured and his virginity that he had guarded through the years was brutally taken. It hurt . It hurt so much. He had cried , begged , pleaded to only see the lust increase with every sound. After that he never begged, never answered his provocation again.
As their words came to an end, the sky completely darkened as well. Hermione came out of the tent, to call out , "Malfoy ! Harry ! Come and have something to eat!"
Draco looked at the eager and experienced elf waiting for instruction and then at the gryffindors working lazily. In a minute, he made his decision and said, "Kreacher, You have to look at those two there and make sure they do their work properly."
Hearing him, Neville looked up to see a face frowning with worry, confusion and guilt. A look at the emotions in Blaise's eyes and Neville wailed louder.
Hermione hugged the round shoulders in her arm, pulling the girl outside. Stopping at the threshold, Hermione looked back at Harry, her gaze shining weird but mischievously teasing, "The moon is asleep and the night thieves his soft touches, isn't it, Harry?"
Suddenly, a miniscule crunch was heard from behind a huge rock directly to their right. Draco instantly pushed Theo behind him while pointing his wand towards the origin of the sound.
Harry watched as Malfoy wrapped the egg in thick blankets as he moved to again settle it on his lap . Waiting silently , Harry looked on .
Ron stood up on the seat on the toilet and peered on the stall beside him . Silently hoping for good luck and fortune so as to not see the hairy , fat and disgusting buttocks.
The silence made thoughts about the assassination swirled in Draco's head as his eyes lowered with despair and unwillingness. With a hesitant voice, Draco softly questioned, " What about the future?"
The symphony as well as the fairies from whom it comes. The individual tunes as well as the mixed melody. The fingers who play as well as the heart which conveys.
A giggle echoed as the conversation continued between the young witches as their feet travelled side by side, making the way towards a new future with glowing happiness waiting for them beyond the curtain of darkness.
As soon as the young house elf caught the sight of Harry , he exclaimed , " Harry Potter ! So long it's been !"
Draco remembered when he had gotten the dark mark and assigned his first mission, he had felt exactly how he was feeling right now. The vile faces, bloodied fangs and snake skin all flashed in front of his eyes. What will happen if these people truly enter Hogward's ? What will happen if he really killed Dumbledore ? He knew that he could never , right now the possibility was lesser than ever . But that is because the ritual succeeded . What would have happened if it had failed?
Draco still remembered how he used to gaze at Harry in potions class. The situation had defied him the wish to befriend him, to have a chance to gain his trust and love, to be a trusted one to him like Ron Weasley was. But what could he have done? He could either be a pureblood death Eater or a torture experiment sample for other death eaters.
Harry so got the havoc and nervous atmosphere in the Order of Pheonix because of his disappearance. As Harry suddenly disappeared, the order of Pheonix was in a worried tandem but unable to do anything. When Harry read this piece of information in Ron's letter, he had started to make keen calculations in his head. When he realised what he was doing, the shock in his eyes was clear. When had he become like this ? Calculating and scheming ? But when he thought what he had and what he could lose, the shock wore off. Now , Harry had people and family to protect, he had Draco. If scheming and plotting can help him keep his beloved safe, he was naturally willing.
" Found him unconscious in the forest, sir . He was attacked by something and lost consciousness. Wanted to take him to Hagrid's to rest "
Warm tears dropped on the bony and pale fingers. He raised his head up to the sky hidden by the marble ceiling. His eyes were red and wet. The glassy layer over those orbs gleaming desperation.
" You can't wake up a man who was never asleep and you can't keep alive a man who already wants to die "
Interjecting between their conversation, Draco said," Wait , you can't really be thinking of going alone ."
Hermione gently shifted her to lie in a comfortable position. She carefully picked her up like a groom lifting his bride on the wedding night and cautiously lowered her on the bed. Her arms had become considerably strong by holding heavy books everyday for almost a decade.
His mouth filled with the metallic yet sweet blood carrying a hint of bitter poison in it. Mouthful after mouthful, Draco sucked out the poisoned blood before spitting it out.
Draco didn't even notice the deadly gleam in those eyes. At that moment , Harry's eyes looked similar to a snake eyeing its prey. Just like a snake lying in ambush , poison ready in it's fangs as it waited for an opportunity to attack. Waiting for a chance to capture in first strike and swallow the delicacy alive and whole as it withered and shivered.
Draco's head lifted as he looked straight in Harry's eyes, "They aren't my people, they are yours. Naturally, you should be there when I check them so as to avoid future misunderstandings"
No one asked him about his stay at the infirmary. It was an unspoken rule between the Slytherins that privacy is above all. Being in Slytherin was automatically swearing loyalty to your group and peers. If one goes down, all go down with him. If one rises up, he pulls the rest with him.
In his thoughts , Draco didn't even realise his eyes closing and falling asleep. Harry held Draco preciously in his arms. His eyes darkening at the display of trust and dependency .
" Harry ! You cannot actually be agreeing to this ! " Hermione screeched , her mouth falling open in shock.
He thought with a huff of relief. Looking around to see himself in an expanse of white sheets and soft comforters, he sat up confused. Where is he ? He did not remember a place like this at Hogwards. Is it the teacher's quarter?
Harry realised with a start and said calmly," Don't move, Malfoy. It's following you. If you stay put then it will as well"
" Oh ! That . I transported it into my portable storage ring. Look " Draco said, showing Harry his ring. He took the egg out and put it in again , relishing in seeing the surprised look on Harry's face.
"But......." Draco frowned , Harry was right but somehow it didn't feel…. appropriate. It felt as if a smelly pervert peeking at a  pretty young maiden bathing.
Hard punches were raining down on Harry as he caught the pale wrists in a tight grip. Still, the person atop him didn't stop and continued thrashing around, desperately trying to get free.
And as if a piece setting into a huge puzzle making it complete, Harry's brain clicked with a certain memory.
Why did he do it ? Why did he save Harry afterall of what he had suffered? Why? He was long past the stage when he worshipped Harry and even defied the dark lord for his sake. Now he did not feel anything for him.
The liquid, Draco noticed, had a peculiar smell, like burning and rotting flesh. Shockingly, he realised that it smelled the same as the draught of living death ! It was just that it seems to have stronger and more harmful effects than the draught of living death.
The sound of bone breaking was heard clearly as Harry fell down. His nose was bloody and crooked . Ron simultaneously fell down as well , the effect of spell broken.
Another detail is that here Harry and Ginny were never together. They are ambiguous but have never done anything remotely like a couple.
Draco was startled and instantly touched his nape to feel an acute sting there . He frowned but said casually, "Must be the mosquitoes"
In the full sight of The Headmaster, Draco was as stiff as a rock. While awkwardly looking anywhere other than at the elder's face.
A look of realisation flashed through his eyes as the man said ," Ahh , that must be my negligence . Do they not teach you the basics of healing anymore ? Who is your master boy ? Did he not teach you basic healing ? "
The stiff silence between them was broken when the sound of numerous footsteps was heard , gradually nearing.
[T/N:- the author states the absolute universal fact in the above statements. The earth can be flat but Draco Malfoy's smile can never not be perfect, otherworldly, wonderful, enchanting, gorgeous, supernatural, etc. ( Please add whatever synonym you choose) For proof, the word of any and every HP fan would suffice and would be irrevocably considered officially valid. If you think otherwise ……..
echoed through the living room. The silent , gentle but somewhat prideful and stern melody swirled and rippled in the air around.
Such  hilarious and stupid people . Who would be able to keep a straight face in front of them ? Even a goblin would laugh .
He could hear Luar screaming in his head to not expose himself but Draco ignored him and continued . He quickly stopped the bleeding and tried to heal the internal injuries . Realising that only his magic will not do the job , he opened his bag to take out all the herbs and potions he had. Crushing some herbs and lathering it in her wounds and force-feeding her the potions , he finally moved back . He noticed that Luar had stopped talking , looks like he gave up . Turning his head to see a cold but burning gaze directed at him , Draco almost toppled back but steeled himself rigid . Catching Potter's gaze , he looked right into his eyes , not willing to admit defeat .
The rage in silver eyes rose steadily, "You didn't let me finish ! I am not your fucking partner ! So how can I-"
Looking at Draco's face again, Harry realised that it wasn't the pout that did the magic but this entire person. So, don't dare to underestimate his words, when he says-
Suggestions and tips are appreciated as well as in dept reviews. You can write as long and big as you want !!!  I live for your words guys !
"No . But that woman was a veela . I saw scars on her back. Her wings were ripped out and considering the wounds on her body , she must have been tortured ." ; Draco presented his analysis .
Before he could finish, Harry interrupted him in a very monotone and as-of-fact voice," No sir. She is a good friend. But she is more of a sister than a romantic interest"
If this is what her brother wanted then who's she to stop and make things difficult for him. She could only give a warning which she did.
Harry had trapped him there. Albeit for his own protection . But still, he had locked Draco in a place where only Harry could be able to see him.
The day went by in a flurry , the evening was fast approaching. Draco had spent the entire afternoon sorting his belongings out of his and Harry's muggle traveling bags into a magical pouch with an undetectable extension charm. He would have used his ring but the risk of revealing it's existence was not an option.
The three Slytherins looked behind them and immediately stepped behind Draco . Their wands still in their lowered hands and eyes still vigilantly on Harry.
The sun went down and so did Draco's anger. Hermione slowly supported a haggard Pansy to sit beside the fire. Her face was wrought with exhaustion and tiredness of the sick. Draco and Theo were immediately beside her to attentively cater her needs.
Draco slowly opened the headmaster's mouth to look at what he consumed to affect his health. Dipping the tip of his index finger inside, he collected the residue of a black-tinted transparent liquid.
As he heard this, Draco's mind grew heavy as sleep evaded his consciousness. Not wanting to sleep, he desperately fought back.  Fiercely  counterattacking, the fatigue suddenly increased by leaps and bounds. Losing his foothold, Draco weakly mumbled, " Wait ……" before he succumbed to it and his breathing grew steady and heart beat calm.
Harry's throaty voice alight with the promise of danger and threat , asked , "Have you seen this before?"
George muttered to silently excep the reconciliation, " Through the Family charms. When your life got threatened, the charms were activated and sent your location to the burrows. When the alarm rang, only two of us were there. The others have already hidden away"
If Draco was playing tricks or if Harry was going bonkers was unclear. But what was sure was that Voldemort was stupid. Why kill people to make horcrux when there was Draco ? One soft glare and a soul tears in two. One small smile and a soul tears into a hundred. Draco would be a hot commodity for future dark lords. If he ever wanted to open a shop in diagon alley the name would go something like -
The round dough that now remained as small as a candy. Lifting it to the headmaster's mouth, he stuffed it inside before forcefully closing the jaw to make the headmaster swallow.
A gasp was heard from Draco . Draco looked at the sight in wonder . Putting his magic in the egg he tried to examine what it was . But as soon as his magic entered the egg it was rapidly absorbed by it .
Surely…. Master Harry does not mean that …… or does he ? So if master Harry is master and Mr. Malfoy is also master then Master Harry and Master Draco are….
With a sigh, Harry turned around , put his arm around the reluctant boy's shoulder and pulled him right beside him.
Mundungus , clearly scared by six wizards and two house elves closing in on him , panicked and said ,
The naughty egg paused at once , leaving both Draco and Harry surprised. Draco gently took the egg in his embrace , slowly caressing the top of it. For the past months, Draco had been actively paying attention to it. It felt like a natural instinct to care for it. He read a number of books in search of any information about it but found nothing. But reading that eggs of magical creatures usually need some kind of nourishment, Draco was worried. He tried different types of potions and liquids but nothing was working and everyday the egg's heartbeat grew weaker. Letting it consume magic was too risky after what happens to Harry. It was one day that Luar told him about an ancient extinct creature that fed it's egg it's own blood that Draco tried to do it as well. And when he spilled a bit of his blood on the white surface of the egg, it rapidly absorbed it ! Since then , Draco has been periodically giving it his blood. The effects were not unseen as soon the heartbeat grew stronger and more stable. But the current advancement was totally unforeseen but the egg had always been different. Afterall which egg sucked blood and magic ?
He waited for them to suggest something as they usually did but none of them spoke for the next couple of minutes as Harry realised that they were hesitant .
The struggling stopped momentarily and Neville looked up aggrieved, "What can you say ? The whole school knows how much you surround yourself with women ! “One on the right arm and other on the left” - isn't this what they say ! Why do you bother to lie when everyone knows the truth ?!"
The pieces flew in all directions as dust flew up, making it unable to see clearly.  The dirt settled and a voice cautiously called out, " Harry ?"
" Well - yes . Potter said that you might need some assistance since you probably will not be in the right state of mind after ….. what you...just had to do and all"
Luar , who was troubled by Draco's words , sounded ," You don't understand , Draco . Let alone defend yourself , you won't even be able to survive removing that slave mark !! "
Blaise was awakened of his stupor when a fair hand led his own bronze one from the plum waist to rest on rosy cheeks.
The eye-contact was shortly cut off by the voices above drawing their attention. " This is your moment, Draco . Do it " Bellatrix encouraged as if a demon luring it's wished sacrifice closer.
[T/N :- Did you understand what i said in the above para ? How many double-meanings/inneudos can you find?]
Harry now is more dark. He does not just blindly follow. He seeks and hides his true thoughts. Harry now is protective over his people and not as softhearted as before. He will punish the people who hurt him and ignore who don't. He is on the path to greatness even bigger that in the novel and will soon become the Magical Overlord. He is someone to fear as well as respect. Fear for what he can do and respect for what he has done.
Harry smiled at the haughty words and indulged, "I wouldn't be able to do anything. It's all thanks to you."
" You know, Malfoy , sometimes I wonder if you really are a Slytherin.  You never learn, making the same mistake again and again. It's hilarious if you ask me"
A bashful look rose on Harry's face , albeit fake but Draco didn't know that, and he remembered the weird feeling in his chest.
Draco ,who didn't care about the argument and was looking after Pansy, ran to them as soon as he heard the exclamation. His brows frowned in worry as he sat down beside Harry.
Harry blindly followed and haphazardly injected his magic into Draco immediately finding the black wisp. He knew that this was the actual problem from the waves of malice it was emitting.
" Go find Potter and tell him to come here instead of returning to the manor. It's not safe anymore "
From the corridor behind the couple, Hermione appeared. Her eyes held indecision, confusion, as if she was reluctant about a certain task but was compelled to do it either way.
The moon went down and the sun slowly started to rise up. Early in the morning with the start of a new day, a tiny new life awoke and desperately struggled to rise as well.
Panting, he stood there in the silence with his back against the tapestry . Sliding down, he silently pulled up his knees to bury his head in them.
He effortlessly slipped off the outer coat from Draco's body, making sure of his comfort before drawing up the covers.
Draco sent a perplexed and frowning glance to Harry, wordlessly asking him about what he saw to scare a wizard as powerful as Dumbledore. But the look in Harry's eyes wasn't as terrified but more complex .
The spell hit and the snake head flew back with the force, it's eyes falling shut and head thrashing around. Hissing sounds fell from its mouth, it's body withering and tightening around Harry due to pain. But in seconds, it was already recovering from the impact.
He did not need to say which pact . It was clearly obvious as to which pact Draco referred to when he made the request to Harry.
Harry stepped a small step back as he whispered in the darkness ," I leave you for today , Malfoy , for the sole acknowledgement to your care . I won't let you off the next time ."
Draco , with a face as red as tomato , glared at the giggling man. His eyes were literally spitting fire.  Was it that entertaining to jab fun at him ?!? Hmph .  If he hadn't been his ancestor , Draco would have hexed him for sure !
Behind him, Harry watched the tender look in Draco's eyes and his own eyes took the colour of a jealous emerald. On one hand, he wanted to imprint this rare image in his mind. But on the other hand, he wanted to tear it apart because he knew that the love in those eyes isn't for him.
By this time, it was already four hours past sundown and everyone tiredly went to sleep in their tents.
Taking the box, Draco came to the front of the shop where the shopkeeper was working. As soon as he closed in, her eyes sharply lifted to meet Draco's. Draco gracefully kept the box on the billing desk.
Harry had always thought Draco as someone vile and crafty, someone who will grovel at the feet of Voldemort just for power, someone without morals. But what he saw that night had inevitably planted a seed of doubt. He speculated what made Draco do all this. What forced him? His own life? His family? Surely, it might be his mother. Draco was not a self sacrificing person. Harry could not tell what it ultimately was. So he decided to observe Draco for now. See if his speculations were true or not.
Hello , everyone ! Sorry for the late update and I kinda started to make Harry a bit dark as promised . Also , the first bun finally appeared !!!!
Harry still gave him a very careful look before he believed that Draco was truly well. And Finally, the breath painfully stuffed in his burning chest escaped, cooling the mind and heart as well.
Pansy continued till she was satisfied , saying after, "How can a Lady wander around with a tear streaked face and snot dripping down her nose ? Huh ? I don't know what you did till now, Granger, but now that you are with us , such behaviour and display of weakness should stop. It's unsightly. Ladies do not cry, no matter what. We remain graceful and poised even in the face of death"
Whilst Draco had made sufficient amounts of ruckus and arguments against it , it didn't stop Potter but instead made him further strengthen the barrier.
" Well… who said there were no bodies ?" Harry said , his eyes flashing mischievously because he knew Draco would understand his implications.
The small figure overturned the egg. Her chubby body shiny with fluids slowly crawled onto the mattress.
Draco had spent the day gathering and sorting out the items he needed and his plan after doing this.
" Thus the blood pact is sealed . May it remain till the end of time. To break it is to cease from existence , your body and soul, and to keep it is to cherish it's bond."
Saying this, he again flicked his fingers and some books flew over . Each of them wide enough for at least a thousand pages . Draco looked at them and then looked up with doubt but still some gratitude and worship in his eyes . Even if he demanded a price for the favor , it was fine as long as he  helps even a little bit . As soon as those books landed in his arms , he sat down and started to browse through the books . The books were very elaborate on the topics . It did not have specific information on the mark but each topic had several paragraphs on it  . The information was totally scattered . Draco kept his attention on the books and did not notice the look out of appreciation and approval in the man's eyes as he looked at Draco trying to understand something way above his ability . Even if Draco did not understand , he was , at the minimum , trying .
Days passed and Harry grew more and more indulged , slowly forgetting his real world . His parents broke the news that his mom was pregnant with a baby girl and the whole family was in a mood for celebration and happiness . He always wanted a younger sibling . Right now , they were sitting on the couch discussing who will name the baby . They excitedly suggested names and bickered about whose choice was better . The door still silently stood there , waiting . Still only visible to Harry .
Turning to Ron , Draco could see the guilt and shame swirling his eye and Hermione wasn't much better .
A deep look appeared on Luar's face . He did not tell Draco that there were no connections at all as he did not want to panic the boy . But now hearing what Draco said , he fell into all the possibilities that can happen and realised that most of them indicated a problem with Draco's mother's character and intentions . Staying away is the most suitable now for Draco .
Draco's hands instinctively wrapped around Theo , protecting him. As the green light neared , Draco had only one last thought that was to somehow get Theo and Dobby out of here.
Concluding that there was no way other than waiting for Theo, Ron, Pansy and Hermione, Harry instead chose to forewarn the remaining two, Blaise and Neville.
"Ahh!", The tender and chubby face gave a precious toothless smile as big and her vibrant green eyes narrowed with glee.
Ron and Hermoine were thoroughly stumped. This Harry was so different than the one they knew several months ago. But the change wasn't unwanted but instead they were glad for their brother .
Harry was having quite a fun . It was vividly amusing to watch the perfect proud pureblood being so twitchy .
Seeing his face , Draco melted like butter and said gently ," It's fine . I apologise for all the past grievances between us . And I really value you . You do have great skills . The literal definition of gryffindor. I will be honoured to have you as an ally "
And the realisation struck Draco like lightning. He looked at the bloody wound on Harry's neck and quickly took out a vial of dittany from his small bag.
Harry watched as Draco's whole body convulsed . The warmth at his arms length, twitching at the slightest brush of his magic , felt incredibly enticing to him. It was as if Draco's magic, soul and body was calling to him. Just like how the scent of wine drew a drunkard , Draco was drawing him. All he wanted was to encase Draco in more of his magic and more of himself.  So that's what he did.
Harry had found out the note inside the locket at the Potter mansion. Soon, the news was relayed to the rest through the letters so as to let them keep a lookout for it as well. But never had they predicted that it would be Theo coming with the important piece of insight. Anyway, the slightly simplistic but proud look in Draco's eyes had told much of what he thinks about it.
- this is also the first appearance of kreature and dobby as well as many more and new canon characters.
Draco doubled his effort as he blocked the wisp with his magic. The wisp was captured in a siege but one step forward and it will escape. Every way was blocked and he was losing his focus as the wisp ate more and more of his soul.
Still wide-eyed and open-mouthed , Draco took a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes and then his mouth and gulped as if swallowing the leftover shock . If he really did somehow swallow the shock , then Merlin's sure that Draco Malfoy's death certificate will go something like this :-
And Draco slowly willed his body up and down, all the while trying to keep the sobs in. His body trembled and withered as he repeatedly impaled himself on the huge girth. His heart felt as if it was ripped out and stepped on. He had never thought that he would be humiliated like this, used like this. He wanted to die. Dying was better than this but how could he when he knew what Harry would do to his mother, to Blaise and Pansy if he died. What had his life become? When had death become a luxury?
Soon, eight people all sat around the bonfire and ate the grilled fish like starved beasts, finishing in minutes. Before they ate, they also called the two elves for dinner as well but were resolutely refused because, "The elves should not eat with the masters ! It's not proper !", As Kreacher had sternly said and tightly held back Dobby as well.
'Don't ask me, I have no idea. Hermione somehow extracted it from our hair, it was a whole lecture.'
‘I think it’s none of your business.’ He says this with his annoying smirk and then continues. ‘But since you care so much, I’m meeting Granger.’
We sit at the bar, sipping our beers. I manage to spot Ash, leaning against a wall, Reynards walking around and Brookheard bending over a railing.
‘It is always interesting to watch purebloods react to all the ‘mugglenesness’ spurting out of my mouth. And don’t get me wrong, your mother is lovely, much lovelier than mine. Just observing different reactions. It’s fun for me,’ she shrugs.
It hangs between us, the question we both know the answer to. He stands in his door, not letting me in. What a prick, it's not like we've never come to blows before the last time.
? Point of no return, for me, at least. Because I am here, restraining myself like never before, just because I’m scared he will bolt if I push even a bit harder.
‘So the celebration is next Saturday, just very intimate gathering of people,’ she keeps nodding her head for some reason.
‘She keeps arguing with me about this shirt I am wearing! She says it was always purple. But clearly as you can see,’ he pushes the photo right in front of my nose and points a finger at himself, ‘it used to be red. She cannot admit she did the laundry wrong. Oh, she’s going to be so pissed she’s not right!’
Because there’s history that will never disappear or be forgotten. Because he might realise that this is really not what he wants, it’s not me he wants. Because it’s not enough that I’m trying - changing, apologizing, being better. Because I never will be better, not completely. Because there will always be something rotting inside of me.
Harry wasn’t paying attention when Robards explained the purpose of the exchange programme or really, anything else regarding it, two weeks ago. He was preoccupied at the time with watching Malfoy writing down notes and biting his lip.
Andromeda serves the meal and Potter opens the bottle of wine he brought and pours it, frowning but hesitating only slightly when reaching my glass.
And now, here he is, trying to make his body stretch in unimaginable ways, sitting behind Malfoy and glaring at him when he makes it look as easy as breathing.
he flicked his wand, the front door opened, he disappeared through a curtain behind the counter, I looked around for a bit and then left. The door shut, it got dark behind the windows and a CLOSED sign appeared.
Grey eyes look back at him with a frown, as usual. Harry noticed the other day Malfoy’s lashes were sort of pale brown, glowing in the light just like his hair. His eyes had specks of blue in them, Harry looked very closely while he could. It was on a stakeout three days ago, in an incredibly narrow space between buildings. Malfoy was looking down the street and Harry was examining his face.
I can't supress the groan escaping my mouth when I come, pointless, really. I slump down on his back, my hand around his cock trapped between him and the bed. I don't want to move, ever. But he does. He pushes me off and turns on his back, slaps my hand away. I watch, his red splotched chest and face, sweaty forehead where his hair is sticking to.
He just laughs like a maniac that he is and then we fall. The broom goes down, albeit slowly and thankfully the fall is softened.
It’s still early when we make it outside, so I decide to continue to the gallery. Potter just walks beside me, not complaining for once.
and didn’t even look at me. I spoke about weather, what a nice day, he just hummed and sped up. I walked inside the shop with him where he finally turned to me and almost pushed me against the door as he was advancing, finger pointed right at me.
‘I have. Back home,’ he sits back. ‘And how many times have you been since apparently you are so cultured about all things muggle suddenly?’
I know Malfoy from school, which was six years of being an asshole and I know him from this last four months, which is incomparable!!
His hands are restless on my back, moving up and down. Soothing and unsettling, firm and gentle, all at once. So I come even nearer, hips to hips. I want no space between us. No air.
‘Maybe! But at least I try! But you! You keep up your insults no matter what! I cannot stand you, Potter, but I still try!’ he grabs my shoulders and pushes me. I grab his wrists and yank them down. He hisses in pain and glares at me, all loathing.
I came back from the loo, Parkinson was smiling at me and Malfoy was probably trying to hex my hair off silently. I sat down, she ordered more of those pink drinks for all three of us and she was chattering away. It was amazing, I learnt so much about her and Malfoy, too. He hated every minute of it (which made me happy) and even tried to shush her few times, but she was not having it. I got drunk – and I think this was her plan all along, I will have to be more careful around her and alcohol when in one room – and I talked.
‘Okay. But please make sure you come. I invited some single people so you can mingle all you want!’ Luna says this all cheerful that I miss the meaning for a second.
'I don't know what to think about you anymore. You ruined everything I ever believed was true about you.' I wish we were alone. I would crawl at his feet and beg him to not think so.
I don’t know where we’re going and Potter is no help, so in need, I ask a passer-by. He shows me how to get there, moving his arm in confusing directions, adding some German word here and there. I try to follow his advice but end up in front of some church instead where people are taking photos and which was the main picture of one of the brochures.
So. Ginny is leaving on Saturday and she invited me to her farewell party tomorrow. I said I’d think about it but I know I won’t come. I don’t want for everyone to see me cry or something worse, if it would come to it.
We talk more, Teddy boasts about his grades and friends, Andromeda is happy with her baking endeavours, Potter talks also but I’m trying not to listen, I talk about my real work and not much else. I might be little paranoid, but I don’t want for Potter to know anything more about me, lest he decides I am up to no good whenever he sets his mind on me.
‘Mhm! It’s delicious gran. Just like when Draco makes it.’ Teddy’s mouth is half-full when he speaks, and I think I will have to teach him some more table manners.
are, a true murderer.' It stings a little. I see disgust in the curve of his mouth. 'Did you come here so you'd feel better about yourself? Because you believe me a murderer too? Did you think if you'd make me confess my guilt it would vanish the blood on
‘Okay,’ Pansy starts, apparently done waiting, ‘I never liked him, Draco. I’m sorry, I really tried, but he was just so pretentious! I could not stand it!’
Even Weasley, when we arrived, didn’t glower at my presence, began only when his team started loosing and called me Ferret Face just once! Fleur also started to converse with me in French and in my utter horror I blessed her with few sentences.
She basically just told me the same thing as when she was breaking up with me a month ago, something along
'Come on.' I slick myself up and push inside, slowly. He clenches and groans and I'm all the way in and I want to get even closer.
She leads me to the sitting room where, of course, there’s already a woman perched on the sofa. ‘Draco, this is Astoria Greengrass,’ mother introduces us as she stands up and offers her hand.
He kissed me goodbye, a bit more forceful than usual and I thought he changed his mind and might call me in. He didn’t, just smiled and went inside, alone.
I go downstairs to make myself a cup of coffee. Ron and Hermione said they would be here by 10pm, the latest. So that gives me three more hours.
We walk in silence. The street is nice, mostly old building and few trees. I see a cafe with delicious looking pastries in the window so I tell Potter to go and buy some. He sends a death glare my way but goes in.
I brought up my encounter with Malfoy to Hermione and Ron. Ron groaned and Hermione said that she sees him sometimes in Diagon Alley. I asked why she never told me and she said she didn’t think it was important!
I crumple the parchment and Incendio it for good measure. He tried calling today, I heard a chime. Thank Merlin I blocked all his access. He doesn’t deserve any note from me or his damn books!
It shouldn’t be as hot as it is. We just grind against each other, hand here and there, all slippery and lazy, the morning sun barely out.
He walks backwards, pushing me down on a chair, kissing me some more and then leaving me, carrying on with the food.
Today I went to investigate a complaint about a shop in Knockturn Alley. I was totally shocked when I saw
I could imagine it. Holiday every day. We would just eat, drink, relax, make love, we would be in heaven.
I manage to speak after few moments. ‘She didn’t take the position yet, did she?’ She shakes her head. ‘I would suggest talking to her. Because I bet you just went all offensive, trying to be the biggest bitch there is.’ She punches my shoulder and sighs.
Malfoy points to his mouth and shakes his head regretfully. Then he smirks and leaves their shared office.
He keeps staring at him, across the Ministry atrium, as Malfoy talks to some witch. He’s very animated and smiles a lot. Harry grinds his teeth.
She tilts her head to the side. ‘Well, just that you and Timothy broke up because he cheated on you with his diving instructor. He definitely has a lot of Wrackspurts flying around his head now.’
‘Not really. But you know, sometimes, you just have to listen to your elders about getting too old in order to make babies and to hurry and start reproducing with the first pureblood wizard thrown your way.’ She finishes her biscuit and takes another.
‘Just making conversation, Malfoy.’ I stand there with him, because why not. If he’s going to be a prick, at least I can have fun riling him up.
I don’t care if this is just for tonight or few more days or hours. I will take whatever. Because I don’t want to let go. If he does, that’s another matter. I will let him, I will watch him leave, I will wait until I’ll go cold completely.
Hermione told me this writing thing only helps when a person is honest, writing about their day and other crap.
He was a bit stiff at the beginning, so I thought I misjudged and wanted to flee as fast as possible, but then he put his fingers in my hair and pushed closer and all thoughts disappeared when his scent was all around.
It starts to look like I might be into guys. That, or Malfoy’s using some Amortentia or something else illegal that makes me this way now. It only started when he appeared, all of a sudden, men flirting with me everywhere? Did he spray it on me or something, is that why?
“Oh god!” Harry’s scream is muffled into a pillow. Malfoy drives in few more times and Harry clenches his ass.
I went back to get Ron, we had lunch and then I went back to work, arrested one wizard for public indecency and at the end of the day, went straight home.
Maybe jealousy is too strong of a word. Harry just wants to scream in their face to get the fuck away and then kiss Malfoy breathless, that’s all.
and it was only few minutes till closing (I came later than usual) and soon enough, we were outside, the bust shrunk in my pocket.
Just two weeks ago he left me cold and alone in my bed, saying he’s busy that week and sending an owl yesterday inquiring if I want to meet him for a drink. How am I the bad guy now? I stayed, ate his food.
‘Well then,’ she stands up, ‘I’m going to check. I will send Twinkle to tell you once everything is set.’ she walks out the room.
‘You know, Potter, unlike you I decided to be civil and generous with you today. I don’t want to upset Andromeda or Teddy so I’ll just stand here and pretend it’s delicious. Feel free to go now.’
He turns, at last, looks at me. I'm still naked, rooted to a place next to his bed, staring back at him.
‘Okay. I’m sorry, I fell asleep after. I wanted to cuddle with you.’ And this is the thing with Potter. He says the most outrageous things, especially after sex. Especially
While I’m filling up her glass, one of Ginny’s overzealous friends is heading my way. She’s been flirting with me all night, heavily hinting she wanted us to kiss at midnight and then probably start making babies right away, followed by a spectacular wedding. I don’t know how Ginny knows her and why she invited her, but then again, maybe she’s just really drunk so I’m willing to give her a benefit of the doubt but not willing enough to engage in another ridiculous conversation with her. I abandon Hermione’s wine on the table and head to the bathroom, locking the door, hoping she didn’t see me manoeuvring in the throng of people.
"How did I get here ? What happened ? What inscribes ?" Out of infinite questions in his head, Draco chose the ones that will possibly help to extend his lifetime if needed. It is better to be wary of landmines when in unknown territory.
A teasing smirk lit Harry's face, " Well… how can I not know ? Now that we are bound by magic and oaths, I obviously need to take good care of my companion"
Harry innocently said, " But , Malfoy , we are indeed companions bound by oath and magic , bound for life and death, bound for eternity --"
Pouncing on Harry with an angry sneer, Draco grabbed his collar to say ," What are you sighing at ?! You think you are better than me ?! You hypocrite ! Bastard ! Idiot! Smelly Pig !"
The Patronus hadn't even fully taken shape before it moved in a hurry to pass through the small hole in the barriers. The Patronus exited as the hole closed.
" That's all fine. But , Mate , I think we should not let him go . What if something like this happens again and someone attacks him ?! "
Harry kept the eye-contact while slowly lowering his wand. His eyes were indifferent on the surface but were hiding a sharp edge in themselves at the unwanted hindering . Not wanting to alert the ones above , he kept silent and waited for an opportunity. Just because he stopped for the time being doesn't mean he won't do it.
A crafty smirk lit Harry's face, he buried his face further in the pale neck, "The beloved moon glows for his dark night. What does the night thieve if the moon belongs to him?"
"Yes" Harry smiled, "Truthfully, I was ready for something like a dragon or maybe a phoenix, even a mermaid seemed as a possibility but - but never this."
"Humph ! Overly smug scarhead !", Draco muttered under his breath to relieve some of his anger at the teasing. If Harry had heard what Draco said, he would definitely curse him back. But right now, Harry's entire focus was on the hunched old witch.
Noticing Harry's expression changing from thoughtful to extremely cautious, he asked, "What's the matter ?"
His hands wound around the thin waist , pulling the soft body to himself , draping himself over Draco , covering him entirely.
Neville crawled back as a frowning Blaise pressed his ears and angrily shouted, "Hey!! Plum face ! Can't you speak lower ? My ears are sensitive, ya know ?"
The ache was so strong that it made him unable to answer. All the people in his around, except Pansy, surrounded his hunched form.
His tone and eyes firm as if stating an irrefutable fact. Draco was enraged and irritated by his words. How can this man be so trusting ? How does he try to see the good in people even while staring at his own death ? Does he not fear the future ? Does he not dread pain ?
A pair of silver eyes slowly opened as another pair of wide green eyes and gaping mouth entered Draco's vision.
For a second , Harry's hand wavered and his magic crackled as if rethinking their actions, as if correcting their actions. Maybe to stop this horrifying and twisted heat rising in his chest , maybe to make his fantasy into reality.
His eyes darting towards the sleeping Theo and unconscious Dobby. In the time Kreacher was gone, Draco had already healed Dobby's major injuries.
Hermione's gaze grew serious at the implication, "The moon doesn't know the night exists. How can he ever belong to him?"
Silently, in her heart, Hermione made a firm promise that from today she would pay attention to the uncharacteristically wise but naive girl so unhesitatingly asleep in front of her.
Draco sat there, wondering about the manor, about Hogward's and his mother. Minutes passed and suddenly, he felt a weight on his lap. Looking down, he saw a plate filled with simple bread and cheese in it.
Harry was not entirely inattentive to others around him. He was aware of the changes in himself . These were primarily due to Eloise and his teaching. He cannot say that Eloise gave him these , more like they were already in him , Eloise only bought them out earlier.
Harry looked at the sleepy and content child in Draco's arms and said in amazement, "How did you do that?"
But before, it could say anything else Harry questions again, "What do you want from me ? And how do you know this ?",  Anxious but steady.
If Draco had not come here , he might not even think about this . He might just be wallowing in the memories like he did for the past hundreds of years . He was really thankful to destiny for giving him a chance to meet Draco , this lovely child .
The next morning sitting down on the gryffindor table , Harry looked at Malfoy to see him eating his meal . He looked fine and pointedly ignored even glancing at anything other than his plate . Harry kept his eyes on him throughout .
Seeing Draco, she exclaimed in surprise, "Oh ! Welcome ! Is this young gentleman here to buy something ?"
, Harry thought and ignored the pain slicing through his nerves. This wasn't the time to get distracted.
Harry's eyes gleamed darkly, daring Draco to continue. He really wanted to see how amusingly cute Draco can be when he was furious.
It soon came to their notice that Harry was nowhere to be found as well. Hermione had quickly sent the elves and the boys to search the forest around while she stayed back with Pansy.
Pansy's blue eyes took on a very different shade in the warm brightness of the fire. The shade itself is cold but when gazed into gives the image as if hiding something beautiful inside. Hermione was enchanted. It was as if she was drowning and Pansy was the ocean swallowing her, serene and beautiful but deep and mysterious as well.
Hearing Draco's words , conflicted emotions passed through his eyes as he hesitantly replied ,"That - Well , I can but - I don't know ."
Their daughter, their sweet little girl , was the only treasure worth protecting in their life. This house, their car,  their life insurance , their savings and all they had was for their small bundle of sunshine. They had worked hard and toiled to gather this so that she could live a comfortable and happy life.
Seating himself, Harry served himself while making small greetings and conversations with his fellow mates. Even if he wasn't looking at Malfoy, he had his instinctive eyes on him. He noticed Malfoy's every movement, his every breath. So when he felt the omnious aura around Malfoy immediately after the quirk of his lips, he was sure that something was going down today. Which proved right when Malfoy sneaked a pill in his cup. It dissolved perfectly and quickly, leaving no traces other than the unnoticeable herbal scent. He wouldn't have known if he didn't pay attention from the beginning.
He looked at Harry following Draco around like a miserable servant and then at Draco doing this and that while absolutely ignoring a particular green-eyed molester.
Umbridge said with a smile so sweet that it sent chills down their spin, " Oh ! Mathilda ! Nancy ! Trever sent you , did he ? Good , we'll go straight down "
" What happened ?! ", Draco asked frantically. He was fine just now, how could anything happen to him so suddenly ?
Pansy added , " after you disappeared, the headmaster's funeral was held and Draco's body was taken by the death eaters . They, as I saw, did not seem to doubt anything "
In front of him was an infected eagle with swollen wings which he stumbled upon some time ago . Apparently lep it had caught an infection from an injury . Fortunately , it was fairly common and easy to cure . Draco closed his eyes and waved his hand over the wary bird as he let his magic cover it , telling it that he meant no harm . Slowly lowering his hand and resting it on the bird , he let his magic flow in it's body and kill the infection in it , gently healing the worst wounds and letting the small ones heal on their own . Taking the herbs he bought from Hogsmead last week , he crushed them in his hands before lathering it on the wounds . The eagle looked up at Draco with its beady eyes and he thought that it might not leave . It felt like the bird was silently thanking him . But this proves wrong as it flew away . Draco looked as it flew higher and higher . Someday he will be the same.  He will heal all his wounds and fly higher than anyone and nothing could stop him then .
His thoughts took a 180° change after some time. It was positively unnerving and even swallowing the bite in his mouth was difficult. The pressure the stare gave was incredible .
True, I went straight home from work, so there was really no opportunity to test it fully, but still.
He dries his hands and Andromeda wipes some dirt from his cheek. ‘It will be dark then, Teddy, and you still didn’t finish your homework.’  Teddy groans. ‘Now that we’re all here, let’s sit down and eat.’
Yesterday, he didn’t bother me much. Once I came from monitoring the building and made myself some tea, he came downstairs, ordering me to make him some too. I didn’t, I told him to do it if he wants one. So, he huffed and puffed for five minutes, but in the end, he managed to boil a water and put a teabag in a mug. He was talking and I was answering him here and there if it was a normal question and some scathing remark about my glasses. When I finished my tea, I left to talk to Ash, leaving Malfoy there, hearing him sneer something about being impolite and rude. I can’t help if it makes me happy making him mad.
– and I had no clue what was happening, but I started on my clothes as well, while he was still kissing me, my neck, cheeks and lips. When I was finally naked, too, I couldn’t stop touching him. He was so pale I could see his veins.
Malfoy proceeds to strip out of his shirt. He watches Harry with hooded eyes. Harry is looking at his hands as he works the buttons open, one after another, so slow it makes Harry’s skin burn.
I don’t know whether it’s whatever I’ve done or whether he doesn’t know himself. He’s hot and then he’s cold, and then he doesn’t talk to me and then he calls me over to have sex, then doesn’t speak to me again for a week and then he’s eating breakfast at my kitchen table and then he’s storming out!!
Seeing Draco's happy expression and as if dumping cold water on his head , Luar explained ," Due to  constant pressure , nervousness and unstable emotions , your body and magic were in a highly alert state for a long time  . Adding to that , you are in your growing stage where your magic is particularly active as it adapts to nature , tries to form bonds and become stronger , same as yourself . But due to these circumstances , it's behaviour changed according to your emotions , making your body somewhat reject it , making it harder to move within and ultimately , making it harder to grow stronger . "
‘Okay, Teddy!’ I shout up at him. He looks down, hovering in the air, snitch fluttering in his hand. ‘I’m coming inside. You should come down now too, I think grandma cooked some dinner!’
I quickly made my way to the garden where Teddy was playing with Bill and Victoire and where some other people were mingling. I joined them, Victoire was making some unsteady steps on the grass, Teddy cheering her on, Bill taking pictures and smiling, sun shining on his red hair, looking young and happy.
“Harry! You’re awake! We were just in the healer Willow’s office. Oh, Malfoy, what are you doing here?” Hermione finally notices him, and Harry can’t see them anymore. He’s being tended to by Molly who is fluffing his pillow.
And so I stand there, with Potter, and I’m sort of mollified that the two of us are as we’ve always been – insulting and loathing each other, only pretending the age long animosity is not there for the sake of people present.
Harry’s breathing quickens as his fingers reach Malfoy’s hips. The trousers are low, and his hipbones are jutting out. Harry looks up and Malfoy nods. He takes them off, pants and all. Malfoy stands there naked, in front of him. Just as Harry’s imagined these last endless months. Malfoy is hard and Harry sees his stomach clench when his knuckles brush Malfoy’s cock.
, steps inside the office. Harry hasn’t even realised she was gone, that’s how much he doesn’t care about her.
‘What are you doing here? Where’s Andy?’ he asks Teddy but glares at me, like I did something to her.
I love it like this. Slow and lazy, making love to him. I know it's not that to him, not anymore, but I don't care. If I can't say it I will show him and let him think whatever he wants.
" I did not know that ! What should we do ?! Should I call Hermione ? She might know what to do ." The worry in his tone was self reflecting.
" I have to go now . You know I can't stay here ." This alerted his parents as a look of shock and worry passing through their eyes .
With a bang, Harry and Draco both landed on the hard and cold pavement. Their limbs entangled as they struggled to sit upright.
Images . Images of a faceless man , of green flames and a terrifying snake. That was what flashed before his eyes.
Draco, who sighted Harry while setting the plates aside, soon came to him, asking, "Are Granger and Weasley already asleep?"
Coming to stop in front of the cave mouth , Harry could hear slight grunts and shuddering breaths from the inside. Something told him that he needed to go in, even if his brain was screaming no.
" I will be going there tomorrow morning.", Harry said and with this firmly closed the chattering mouths.
. He knew that it might not actually taste like this but this what he imagined and he did admit that it tasted a bit like Mrs. Weasley's , since she was his only inspiration for the taste of a mother's hand.
A cold and hard gaze swept over Ron whose face inquiringly looked around to search for the source of it. His eyes met hard emeral once and a frightening chill flowed through his body as he lowered his eyes , afraid to even lift them .
Draco was very clear about the budding emotions in Pansy's heart. He had an inkling when Pansy went to pick Hermione up in the muggle London. But his suspicion was confirmed when she took a deadly curse for Hermione. He was very sure about Pansy's feelings but what worried him was Hermione's reaction to these feelings. He didn't want this sister to get hurt for a love who might not even see her that way. This was the general sentiment of every brother towards their sister. Although he was worried, Hermione's behaviour didn't go unnoticed by him. And it seems that there is a possibility of love ….
Several stunned heads turned and voices resounded. But Harry was tenacious and firm. He shot down each and every word of opposition. He was unyielding in his decision.
Harry kept looking at Draco as he stared at him in a daze. At some point a slight, almost unnoticeable, pink bloomed on his neck and up to his cheeks and ears and at the same time a pair of pale red lips shaped into a full blown scowl directed at Harry with such intensity as if plotting his murder, which Draco was.
Switching off the lights , Harry slipped inside the covers and sighed with delight when a warm body stuck to him . Even if the ache in his pants was painful and a torture in itself but with Draco beside him , it's fine . Wrapping his arms around the peacefully slumbering Draco , Harry closed his eyes as well.
Draco's face immediately became glum. He understood Harry's implication. Now that they have assassinated Dumbledore , the only threat to the dark lord is Harry.
Harry looked at Draco's eyes and saw the careful and respectful tone his actions held. The previous bitterness on his tongue was swept away, leaving only a sour sweetness.
"I believe I've proven my credibility enough , haven't I ? "; And it was true . Harry had no wish for unnecessary actions .
- And ......let's just say a lot of the plot from the original story will proceed with some variations to achieve the wanted timeline and emotions.
Hearing the exhausted and helpless sigh, Pansy looked at Harry this time, she tactfully suggested, "You should rest as well, Potter. Lest Draco gets well and you get sick. Wouldn't that waste Draco's effort?"
Draco was once again stunned to shock . His mouth falling open as his eyes became as wide as saucers , looking especially like a  tarsier* . What !?! He was a healer , a potion master , a legilimens and occlumens all together !!!!! What kind of monster was this ? And he lived only 48 years out of which at the very least 11 years went without magic . So that means he had  masteries over four very difficult and powerful topics  that people sometimes spent their whole lives learning !?! WHAT THE FUCK !!!!! Even Snape had only potions mastery and basic legilimency and occlumency ! And Snape was the smartest person he knew ! This is not a wizard , well , once-upon-a-time-now-soul-wizard . Draco barely resisted the urge to drop on his knees and pray .
Imagery of this thought seemed terrifying in Draco's head even if it would seem terrific in other's heads. Shaking his head and blowing his thoughts away , Draco opened his eyes and looked up at his newly acquired papa with even more newly acquired awe .
Days have been going fairly good for Draco but a stale smell still lingered in the air . It was the feel of incoming doom that hovered over Hogwarts . Everyone was walking on eggshells these days , their instincts warning them about the wrong winds .
Far from where they were, a train was traversing through the vast land filled with marshes. Inside a compartment of the train, sat a youth. His childish face, still having baby fat , was oddly serious. The look didn't suit the boy's adorable visage.
"Hmph ! Are you finally at ease ? If not then rot ! I will not bother do anything else for you !" The voice knew that Harry would agree after this much so it swiftly put a foot forward to regain its lost pride .
Soon after Hermione left, sleep overtook Harry. The state of comfort that Draco provided him lulled him to a light and aware sleep.
At this, Draco wasn't surprised about her being right. It was Christmas eve afterall. It was logical for her to make such a guess. But what made him frown was the obvious surety in her tone. She seemed awfully obnoxious to him but at least she respected manners.
Understanding his doubts, he transmitted his isolated voice to Draco's ear , saying," It's Slughorn's memory . Apparently, Voldemort was his prized student "
" Great minds think alike ,don't they ?"   Harry said , a slight laugh in his voice.    " We will be leaving today at sundown. So make necessary preparations"
So beware, public ! This phenomenon is highly common and contagious, being especially harmful to your public image.
Stepping forward to stand behind Malfoy , Harry caressed his ears , his fingers barely touching the skin , cold from the gloomy winds . His face so close to Draco's nape that he could see the faint veins running down beside his ears .
In front of Harry lay a boy, the one his eyes always followed, the one whose scowl was buried deeply into his eye, the one whose name made his whole muscles tighten in awareness, the one who with just one word drew his focus,  attention, eyes and thoughts to himself.
A haggard but proud and worried face smiled as it looked at Draco . The soul lovingly stroked Draco's hair as he let the boy rest . His eyes held unfathomable emotions as he looked at his newly adopted son . He did not know why but Draco struck something in him . The need of cherishing him was unavoidable . So , he did something he could not have done in a thousand years . He adopted Draco . It was not because he felt like it but more because he knew Draco needed someone beside him  desperately just like he did . The plague of loneliness and helplessness was hard to bear . He knew it well beforehand and he did not wish to let Draco go through it alone .
Pansy's face frowned in obvious worry and disbelief, "Mosquitoes ? Such savage bites. Are you sure it isn't an infection ? It might be the bite of some poisonous insect. Afterall, we are in a forest"
The sudden change panicked Draco and Harry as they tried to find what was wrong . Draco kept giving his magic as it kept bouncing back and her pulse kept growing weaker.
A look of agreement flashed in six pairs of eyes as they silently looked for the orders with determined eyes.
Harry ,with Draco and Theo on his tail, started in the same direction Pansy had gone. Harry walked ahead keeping vigil about the surrounding as Draco and Theo anxiously kept calling in loud voices, "Pansy ! Pansy ! Are you there ?"
"Yes ?" Harry was no stranger to tests . He had gone through plenty under Dumbledore's hand . Not finding it odd , he remained surprisingly calmy . But he would have liked a warning.
Entering Harry saw a familiar egg on Draco's lap. But the difference was that it was moving. And Draco ,who looked positively petrified, was crawling away only for the egg to keep coming to him again and again.
Draco paused the troubled look on his face clear and he searched for the right word. Angrily glaring at Harry because he knew that no matter what and how he said it , Harry is going to make fun of him either way.
were none other than the ranks of death eaters. Now, Blaise was in the dreary place where Draco stood before.
The hallway leading to the courtroom was dark and ominous. It was bleak , as if haunted by a millennium old demon . A struggling man was forcibly being taken towards one of the rooms. Flanked by two arours , he was crying and pleading , begging them , saying,
"How can I lie to you ?! How can you doubt me like this ?!" Harry gasped and said with horror, not at all afraid of death or the loss of his terrible weapon of procreation.
The egg , hearing Harry, rolled to him to give a soft nudge as if a hug and rolled back to Draco to snuggle into him again. Even this egg had such an endearing character.
His mother and elder twin brothers standing beside him, smiling at the newly wed couple . While his father danced happily with his precious daughter.
" Why is Malfoy here ? Shouldn't he be in the Slytherin dormitories ?" Ron lowered his voice as well.
Neville's eyes flew towards the familiar voice. Blaise stood behind the death eaters, drawing their attention with a smile on his face as if making regular conversations about weather.
It was then that Harry realized what this was and he wordlessly wrapped his arms around the struggling boy . And said with a calm tone , " shhh.... I know..I know  "
As they soon entered and queues for the ….toilet ….. Ron's head swirled and eyes twitched from thinking about how they were supposed to aparate.
She watched as white strands from all over the house flew into the tip of her wand. These were her memories , the proof of her existence. Her figure in the photos, her clothes, her books, all her belongings, everything connected to her slowly disappearing.
Not letting Draco speak , Harry added again, " And it wasn't even my fault…. It was you … who was squeezing here and there "
Emerald eyes gleamed darkly, reflecting the pale figure scrambling to get out of bed. And before Draco could know what was happening, strong hands forcefully pulled him back on the bed, grasping his elbow with a frighteningly tight grip. He tried to pull back and struggled fiercely, all the while his other hand searched for his wand.
At the same time , Harry said with a steady strong command , " Well, we will meet after exactly one month . The contact will be maintained through letters , so keep your eyes and ears open at all times. And remember, we are all in this together and every one of you needs every other . So cherish each other , from here on you are no different than a single body , a single life."
" You should sit down . You just recovered from over exposure to magic and are extremely sensitive. " Harry commanded while leading Draco to sit in one of the chairs.
The croaked voice of Kreacher sounded saying, " Kreacher thanks Master Draco but Kreacher cannot take this. It's too pre~cious. "
" Who punched me knowing full well that he might be offending a necessary ally which could indirectly cost him his life ?"
The worry in Harry's eyes was self evident and Draco slowly softened and relaxed , putting his weight on the hand around his waist. Potter had a kind of unspeakable aura to him . Draco felt as if he was being guarded by a ferocious beast , most secure but the most dangerous as well . But he still did not part. The feeling of safety and security was a novelty for Draco who was monitored every second , by his own people as well as others . He wanted to have his fill of this feeling, even if it wasn't real and only an illusion cast by Potter's saviour image.
" The guards are still outside, you know. You don't want them to look, do you? Don't want them to see how Heir Malfoy is such a cock-loving whore, do you? "         ; A smile was gracing his face as he said those words .
Harry looked at Ron from the corner of his eyes and the fear mingled with firmness and resolution he saw in Ron's face made him feel somewhat proud.
An ery smile rose on Harry's face at this thought. That's right. He should make it so that Draco needs him. So that he won't be able to leave even if he wants to.
As Harry's eyes widened at the appearance and disappearance of the egg out of thin air , his heart secretly envied the treasure. But the envy wasn't visible on his face but instead the look of wonder prevailed there. Harry was acutely aware of the haughty upturn of Draco's nose as he over exaggerated the expression to get even more of that sweet look.
Kreacher's eyes lit up with excitement. Afterall , why wouldn't he be happy ? The Black family wasn't entirely gone and he wouldn't be more happy knowing this.
How was the Neville/Blaise ? I plan to make Neville a small fluffy cotton candy who is just absolute cuteness to everybody.
Harry as the one foremost ahead , said , " When you turned this place over - don't deny it …. You found a locket . Am I right ?"
"You fool ! Do you think you would be alive right now if I had any malice for you ? Voldemort, isn't he the one you fear ? Such a nuisance ! I could crush such a fly with my bare fingers, if I wished so !", It said to Harry in a much calmer but irritated tone as if an elder reprimanding his own family's child. He seemed to be losing his patience fast.
He hugged her one last time and looked at his dad to see him looking at Harry with the same sad smile as his mother .
There was a reason why Draco never asked for  help, why he never pursued friendship with people not connected to Voldemort, why he made an enemy of Harry even after growing out of his immaturity. And he was not going to change that anytime soon. Draco was bound in one way or another to all of this that was happening. And he knew that if he kept going the same, he was going to end up in tragedy, if he wanted or not, possibly even lose everything. The only way to be safe was to somehow cut all the connections he had with Voldemort. It seemed almost impossible but he was going to try. He wasn't going to give up just like that.
" Should I call Zambini and Parkinson to take him away ?" The newfound admiration and worry for Draco was not superficial but ran deep in Ron's heart.
From the lack of acknowledgment , Ron as well as Hermione's silence and the look in Harry's eyes , people understood that it was better to stay away from him today .
The hands stilled and slowly drew back. Harry with obscure eyes and an animalistic growl in his voice said , rough and hoarse , " I let you go this time . Only because you called my name  "
Draco looked at the two chatting idlers and his cute Theo trapped between them. A sense of danger rose in his heart. It almost felt like seeing his own sweet child being wooed away by disgusting boys. Suddenly, the Weasley twins seemed much less pleasant than before.
Harry silently caught Pansy's gaze who promptly pointed her eyes towards Umbridge and he noticed that on Umbridge's neck shined a brilliant gold.
The bread and cheese Draco ate minutes ago were sprinkled with the drops of a powerful sleeping draught, ironically, made by Draco himself. Harry had given this to him because he knew that Draco wouldn't agree to even relax for a second if asked nicely. So he instead took straight action and directly put him to sleep. He knew that his action was cruel and an atrocious disregard of Draco's own will. But the reality that Draco's health will be compromised couldn't be allowed by him. You can't blame him if he wanted his beloved to be well fed and rested either by hook or crook.
As his knees gave out , Draco tumbled down. Harry's hand soon followed with a flick to stop him in mid air . His magic surrounded Draco , completely encompassing him. And his body went entirely pliant, hands hanging down and head thrown back with wide and surprised eyes with wheezing pants.
" I will ", Draco whispered while staring right back at Harry, not trying to hide even an inch of his heart .
Draco noticed more of the purple hue but now on the ground as it made a trail ending inside a dark cave nearby .
The man did not miss the complex emotions flashing in Draco's eyes . If anything , the slave mark was definitely a clue as to why . The man stood up and walked to Draco and slowly embraced him . Giving him silent support .
Ending their discussion, Harry and Draco moved to leave when a sudden sentence stopped them in their tracks .
" Hmm. They were probably aiming for Potter , having guessed that since you were there he might be as well. Good , that fortune was on our side this once " ; Draco acknowledged.
Draco walked out and fiercely started to disembowel the fishes caught by George and Fred sometime ago to prepare them for dinner.
All the while, her eyes were trained on the Headmaster who uttered with mock cheer, " Good evening , Bellatrix. I think introductions are in order don't you ? "
Symptoms include rapid heartbeat, too warm and sensitive skin, sweating, mouth going too dry or too wet according to your kinks and fetishes, while certain parts usually get wet till the point of dripping. So, in short, according to top doctors and scientists, -
She shouted again and again. Her laugh turned more maddened the more blood pooled around Draco. It was then that a panicked Harry entered the room with a shout, "GINNY!!!"
"Potter ! You idiot ! Do you know what you just did ?!" Draco roared. He was seething and furiously angry. "You can't just light a soul lamp with anyone's blood !"
With just some sentences, this man could teach Harry so much. it's no doubt that this is a man who has experienced many things and knows much more. by the way he speaks, Harry could at least deduce that Dumbledore is no where near where he stands.
In this commotion, Ron was entirely forgotten and he himself was lost in his thoughts. He seemed to have seen the symbol Hermione showed them somewhere. He was sure that he saw it somewhere but he just couldn't remember. The memory was on the tip of his mind. Entangled in these thoughts, he didn't notice any of the happenings around.
Understanding him , Luar continued ," Over that is the anomaly of your soulbonds which makes it worse . If you go like this , the consequences will be bad . It can even handicap your magic , making you a squib . We should first treat this before our next step ."
The Slytherins were filled with worry and unwillingness. But the Gryffindors beside them were entirely stuffed with dread and impending doom.
She is such a despicable person. She knows that no one in this world is an angel. Even she isn't such a pure saint.
At this, Neville didn't know what to say. He wanted to comfort but didn't know how to. If it had been anyone else, it wouldn't have been so difficult. But now with Blaise….
So this chapter was relatively short. It took much longer as well because the framing and wording of this chapter was a absolute headache . The emotions and situation were a mess and hard to convey .
Remembering the things he had seen and experienced  , Draco's face sank and his eyes lost the remaining light . He said in an emotionless voice ," What's  your purpose ? It's not like you can help for free ."
But before Draco could complete his sentence, Harry said with deadly calm, looking straight into Draco's eyes, "So ?"
Silence prevailed . No answer came back and Draco doubtfully turned his head to the elf , asking forcefully, "were there or not?! "
Pansy ,who was silently working with Draco to count and list all the herbs, potions, and such things they have, paused suddenly. Turning to Draco, her voice sounded in somewhat embarrassment and reasonable shyness, afterall she was a noble lady by birth and voicing such matters to a man ,even if the said man is your brother, can be uncomfortable, "Draco, Um… I am going that way. I will come back after….uh... powdering my nose"
In the middle, Draco was trying his best to gauge the situation of eggie and at the same time forcibly stopping Nagini's poison from spreading in Harry's body.
Draco weakly lifted his fingers and lightly tapped Harry between his brows to silently draw his attention.
Now calm, Harry's voice returned to the strong, emotionless tone it usually had, "What happened exactly?"
Such moments were the ones that kept him up all these years. It wasn't food that nourished him or medicine that healed him, it was all this. These moments he had with people around him. Let it be the frequent scolding from professor McGonagall or the cheer from his quidditch team. All of this was what kept him alive, kept him as Harry and not the saviour.
Ron silently lifted his wand. Coincidentally, his eyes caught the gaze of his elder brother, George . George was rapidly making his way towards Ron with Fred at his side. His face frowning and lips shouting something that couldn't be heard in the ruckus around, as if he knew what Ron was going to do. And probably , Ron thought, he might actually know.
- Harry musing about how much he has changed and how much more will he change just because of Draco's love.
" Haa-ah-ah! Sto---wait!" Draco wheezed out. His mouth rounded, his eyes widening to spill uncontrollable drops and his back arched forward. His pupils were shaking and shivering with pain, fear and shame at himself. Too much. It was all too much.
He paused as some death Eaters dragged a beaten up and bleeding man past him. Ruthlessly pulling him by the collar as the blood from the wound on this face dropped on the marble floor below .
Saying this , he walked towards another shelf and picked up a gold band-like ring and soon all the things started disappearing . Finally when the room emptied , he walked to Draco and demanded his right hand to place the ring on his index finger.
Harry could feel the power of this man and he was no match. He could feel that he was powerful but couldn't tell how powerful. All he knows is that he is trapped.  Even though suspicious, he can do nothing. So he asks again, "Who are you ?"
As soon as the egg sensed Harry, he found him familiar. But he could not remember exactly how. Now that he tasted Harry's blood, he remembered that it was his protector! He did not meet his protector for a loooooong time so he forgot but now that he tasted his protector's blood , he will surely remember forever. He gave a happy nudge to his protector to show that he was full before silently snuggling into his nurturer again. It was so warm and snuggly here.
As soon as Draco entered, he could sense that this was a magical shop. The objects on display gave a faint air of familiarity which must be the magic that they contain.
. Why was his reaction so different for Malfoy ? What did he have to make Harry behave in such an abnormal way ? Why was Harry's own body defying his will for Malfoy ? First was the incident in the girl's lavatory and now this . What was wrong with Harry ? No . What was wrong with Malfoy ?
The entire class watched as Blaise wrapped his arms around the boy, supporting him. His angular and beautiful face lifted to look at the man.
" I don't know. It was fine before this. ", Draco answered similarly wary but more trusting because of it's company through the months. He knew that it was different and might be dangerous but also knew that it was more like a pitiful lost child .
It was almost evening when Ron and Hermione sat beside Harry in the Gryffindor common room. Sharing an uneasy look with each other, Hermoine gently called," Harry ? W-we were worried about you. Are you alright ?"
Harry let him as he knew the man was the one helping Draco before him. He only sat back and paid attention to his every move.
" Eggie is very hungry . I can feel it . Only my blood won't fill it's stomach so I bit you as well . He is a growing egg , afterall !"
Looking around, he noticed the unmoving body of The Headmaster. Fearing for the elder's life, he got up and moved towards it.
The two tiger teeth in Harry's mouth gleamed in the silver moonlight as his lips parted. His throat bobbed in eager anticipation.
Suddenly, the image of his teeth sinking in that neck and leaving their mark flashed across his eyes, deepening them to form a dark endless well . His little brother twitched in under the thick cloth of his jeans and Harry barely resisted the involuntary action of his own body . His palm fisted the bedsheet beneath in an effort to ground himself.
"Pansy, why don't we wait outside? Let Malfoy and Harry rest.", She said, gently yet forcefully guiding Pansy out.
Her hand slowly stroked the black and silky strands of hair. The smooth touch was very pleasant as the curls intertwined around her fingers.
Draco took a long breath, patting his chest and reassuring himself that it was a false alarm. By now meeting Harry at unknown locations and basically being kidnapped by him was no groundbreaking disaster to Draco. Turning his eyes up again, he saw Potter waiting patiently. Harry sat down beside Draco. His body only inches from Draco's. And Draco felt  invisible chains bind him in place as Harry slowly approached closer .
With a chuckle , Draco nodded and Harry continued, "So first , Voldemort is planning an attack on the school . We need your full cooperation . A week from today, Death eaters will enter the school "
Draco continued to wander through the house. As he passed a closed door, a stale and disgusting stench assaulted his nose. His throat gagged and food in his stomach came up. Forcefully suppressing the vomit, Draco walked to the door and curiously opened just a slit to see what it was that could give such a bad smell. What he saw inside made his entire back numb.
Draco walked closer and this time Harry did not stop him but stood in place keeping his eyes on the woman for any movement . He knelt beside her and lightly felt her pulse and found a thin and very weak pulse . He couldn't have noticed if not for his recent practice on different species of creatures . She was still alive but only barely . Looking again at her , he noticed that she had two slanted wounds in her shoulder bone . Her bone was clearly visible and looked like a piece of it was ripped out .
Wishing to look at the convict's face to further assess his actions and solve the case, Draco opened his eyes to a slit and when nothing happened anymore, he fully opened his eyes to see a smiling Harry who in this moment looked eerily similar to Dumbledore but with very bad intentions. Believing that there was no threat, he opened his mouth to ask Potter what the hell he was doing when a similar hand joined another plum cheek and - STRECH!!!
Laying him down, Harry sat beside him, cradling him. It was then that he sensed that another presence was beside Draco. Looking up, he saw an elderly blond soul sporting a worried frown. The man took one of the potions kept aside and poured it into Draco's mouth and lifted his chin up to force it down his throat.
" Hmmm. I agree but you know Malfoy, he hates to take help and does everything himself ", Harry stated as if it was an universal fact known by all.
Harry who was observing from the sidelines, pulled Draco closer, saying," I actually got Slughorn's memories "  While like a stumbling doll, Draco fell right into his chest.
The wound rapidly closed with each sprinkle of dittany powder. When the wound finally closed up, Draco threw the vial aside.
The surety in these words made an instant answer flow from Draco, " How do you know ?! I have done things that would shock you ! "
Draco could heal the bruises if he wanted but such a minor thing wasn't something he should pay attention to. It was nothing to him.
Also, Did you agree upon Harry's POV where he was grateful that Draco is a Malfoy because of which people couldn't take advantage of his beauty and dare not lust after him. As the author of the book and as a woman of this generation, I feel that it is actually very right in true world as well. People will inevitable try to take advantage of a beautiful person, male or female, if they get a chance. That's why, according to me, a beauty without poison to protect themselves is the same as a beauty ruined and dirtied.
The three brothers wordlessly looked at each other. Ron was the first one to sigh and step back, asking tiredly to extend an olive branch, "How did you get here? I left absolutely no clue"
Time passed and as Draco was about to finish the last of his breakfast, when Harry said, "How have you been?"
Draco's eyes opened as he said, "He's  fine. No fever, infections or weakness. He will be fit to travel by tomorrow morning"
With a complicated expression, Harry said, "Good , good . The students must have already started departing for home , haven't they ?"
Draco had worked quickly, leaving close to no internal or external wounds on Pansy, only severe weakness.
Inside the infirmary, Draco tried to lock up his emotions in his chest again but failed miserably to the constant heat and pressure surrounding him. He did not know what Harry wanted. Did not know why he was still here. He wanted to run away, wanted to stop, but he did not know how. So, for the first time in his life, Draco Malfoy let go. He cried and cried thinking that this might be his only chance he cried on someone's shoulder, let someone know his pain, even if that someone was his enemy for years. There were no words spoken but he knew Harry understood, maybe he found them false, but at least he understood.
When Hermione , with a pleading voice, said , " Before that , Can I visit my parents for the last time ?"
Draco continued ," First we need a pair of you to stay in the school as our intelligence. As for the others will the ones finding the horcruxes "
Hermione subconsciously leaned further forward when, as if having a nightmare, Pansy shifted in her sleep.
Afterall , who wouldn't be happy to leave their mark on their beloved ? He was happy that Draco didn't heal or conceal his hickeys.
Draco sat beside, not saying a word. He quietly listened to Harry dissuading every  inquiry and objection one by one, firmly keeping his stand. He didn't comment from start to finish in this conversation.
Harry's wand slowly lowered and his magic gradually retraced back to his body. Draco followed behind to lower his wand and briskly swept forward to take Pansy in his arms.
Struggling to lift herself up , she moved and squirmed . Seeing her difficulty , Harry gently lifted her to sit up and let her back rest on the stone wall behind her .
Stepping up , Pansy, Hermione, Theo and Ron revealed. Soon all of them were sitting down on the floor. Pansy spoke first, " Do we all absolutely agree on the coalition?"
He was so angry that the food lost its taste . Finding no meaning in staying anymore , he got up to leave . Walking out of the great hall and making his way towards the Slytherin dormitories for a good night's sleep.
Draco coldly looked at the elf and calmly said , " Do you know what is happening to the house elves still at the Malfoy manor ?"
The small globes moved quickly and quietly making their way to every corner of the room. Minutes passed and Harry counted in his head ,
Ron who was crushed in between the two grimaced as the wound on his shoulder throbbed with pain due to the pressure.
Neville opened his eyes with a gasp . The eyes. The same eyes were looking down at him. The same evil eyes.
He came here to do and find out what he couldn't yesterday. But looking at this sight all his will dissipated as if warm steam into air . Sighing , he pulled the covers further up , as he looked at Draco as he fell in deeper sleep .
In the room of requirements , Draco and Harry silently dressed up for the upcoming day . They unknowingly spent the entire weekend in this chaos . Now that Monday was here ,  reality struck them like a brick on the head . They hastily readied themself.
Draco's bony and slender palms  overlapped Harry's own much larger ones. Draco's hands were so pale that the veins inside seemed like rivers of blue flowing through misty valleys. The nails pink and small, the fingers long and defined. These hands were the ones who punched Harry's face and ripped his clothes at various occasions. How can they still look so delicate ?
Harry's voice was neutral, not revealing even a bit of his actual intention, "Why were you crying, Malfoy ?"
After the treatment, Blaise was assured that Neville was fine and took the boy in his arms back to the Slytherin dormitory.
Harry wandlessly pulled the floating egg to himself catching it in his arms before walking to bed and keeping it there again.
The old hag looked at the frame, stilling for a second before pointing towards the stairs, beckoning him to follow.
How could he lie to Neville like this ?! Did he think that Neville was a fool enough to believe such an obvious lie ?
How will Harry let his beloved be unlucky when fortune , fate and destiny bowed at his feet since the day he was born ?
A pair of wands instantly raised followed by three wands pointed in opposition.The slytherins and gryffindor stood facing each other , their faces in focused vigilance and bodies in tight muscles. Neither sides moved, both at standstill . Not wanting to start and bear the responsibility of starting a fight but still wanting to damage the other side.
Draco slowly stood up, saying, "The wound is healed but he needs at least a day to collect the lost strength"
Every young face in the enclosed space held a determination , a hope . They were all aware that this might not turn out as they wished but what did they have to lose? Let it be the orphaned Harry, or the abused Draco , the muggle Hermione or  pansy who was disdained by her own family , in one way or another , all of them were alone . The only people they had that remained truly faithful were the ones with them right.
" It's fine , sir . It would be unsightly to bother Professor at such a late time"  ,Draco reasoned.
But after some time, Draco noticed that eggie wasn't absorbing his blood anymore and it was trailing down the white shell freely.
Hermione was defeated, "Just be careful. The night shouldn't wrong his moon. Lest he loses him forever."
The rest, she leaves it to Harry and hopes that he gets both, himself and Draco, out of this romantic mess sanely.
Recognition flashed in Harry's new and very common,  wrinkled and mustached face , " Oh . It's you. Sorry...it just that ...you don't look like yourself "
Walking side by side , they soon reached the astronomy tower . Alit by moonlight , the space was empty and without the signs of anyone coming or going. Confused , Ron said, " Where are they ? How come anyone isn't here yet ?"
Now, some distance away from the tents but still inside the barriers put on by Harry and Hermione, Draco asked, "What is it?"
In his internal crisis , Draco totally forgot Harry but was drawn back to him by the pained whimper heard from the bedside floor.
' Alas, I owe all of them too much. I don't even know if I will ever be able to even repay it all ' Draco thought while looking at Harry.
As if remembering something , Ro quickly stopped short , pulling Mary to stand still with him as well and said hurriedly moved , " Mary , go home and get the kids. I'll come to you. We need to get out of the continent "
Neville didn't know what happened but he saw Blaise's eyes soften. The eyes scanned his face slowly before the wand was in his palm again.
An icy scowl decorated Draco's . With a swish of his sleeve , he hurried forward with angry steps. And a chuckling Harry followed behind with a much more leisure pace.
As he fell , A pan flew from Kreacher's hand to his head in a vicious attack. Kreacher walked to dutifully closed the opened door , saying all the while , " As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief "
Draco found himself dropping outside the Slytherin dormitory and barely managed to steady himself . Looking around for any presence but finding none , he concluded that it must be the early hours of the day .
Standing before the four-posture bed , Harry slowly parted the curtains . Inside lay Draco deep in his sleep , buried under the covers and a large white egg tucked under his arm . The sight unknowingly brought him a deep solace .
Draco hurriedly changes his clothes behind his bed curtains and left the infirmary. He walked towards the Slytherin dormitory. His mind wandered to the events of last night. He was still not clear if it was reality. The bruises on his arms were throbbing but he did not know if it was just the residual psychic sensation from a weird dream or actual pain.
Draco quickly scrambled off from Harry. His gaze panicked as he saw the bloody pit on Harry's shoulder and the crack on eggie's shell.
Stunned, Draco quietly stared at the closed door. It was then that he felt a slight movement inside his portable storage ring.Wanting to investigate what was happening, he inserted a little of his magic inside it and closed his eyes to peer in the inner space of the ring.
The position of Draco had increased unanimously since the revelations back at the Grimmuald place. He was now even more preferably towards Draco, more so than Harry who was his actual master.
Draco looked at the blankness in Harry's eyes and the same ache again ignited in his chest. His palm rose to press on his warm chest. '
Harry continued to eat his dinner as Hermione and Ron dived into a conversation about classes and how Ron hadn't done his homework.
As soon as the door closed, Draco and Harry were in Draco's bed, robes and shirts slipping off the side of the bed and onto the floor, quickly forgotten. Harry's hands were almost immediately tugging at Draco's pants as they continued what they had been doing in the hall.
"I was an idiot," Draco mumbled into Blaise's chest, "I kissed him and he ran away." Draco choked back a sob. "I was stupid and ruined everything."
"I'm excited to see the fireworks and all, but I hope they're fast," Ron whispered to Harry and Hermione and they laughed a bit.
Draco coated his erection with the lube, positioning himself at Harry's entrance and slowly pressing inside of him. Planting kisses on his neck from behind, continuing until he was completely inside. Draco tilted his head to look at Harry and noticed his eyes shut tight, tears forming at the sides, and jaw clenched.
"I hadn't really thought that far," Harry rubbed the back of his neck nervously, "figured you'd have an idea."
"Malfoy," he corrected, "It will not look good for you to be so close to me, someone is going to start talking."
"I had to use the restroom and then I couldn't go back to sleep!" Ron shouted, moving to search through his dresser drawers. "Oh! I found them!" Ron cheered when he opened his sock drawer and found his things he jammed in there last week when he hurried to clean up for Hermione.
"I don't, but I'm worried about your punishment. You two have a habit of getting into fights with each other when you're mad."
He wouldn't trade it for a moment though as he watched him laugh next to him as the match started. Draco was stunning.
Draco readily agreed, not wanting to imagine the rumors that would spread if they were caught like this: clothes and hair rumpled, pink-lipped, and snogging on the side of the hallway.
Harry crawled up to meet Draco in a soft kiss after refusing to let them return to making the fort before returning the gesture. They'd ended up on top of the pile of pillows and now Harry and Draco were laying on them trying to control their breathing.
"Works perfect for us," Draco said, already pulling him down the hallway to find an empty compartment. When he located one he quickly pulled Harry inside and shut the curtains.
"I'm glad you came when you did. It was getting dreadfully boring and Pansy was starting to talk about hair and makeup." Draco took a seat and Harry followed suit.
"We were thinking we should all have another party this Friday after classes. You two should come too," Dean said, gesturing to Luna and Ginny.
"Yeah, I know. Do you really think I should tell him?" Blaise said, turning his head away from Pansy's surprised expression.
Hermione thankfully decided to interrupt then, "Do you know the quidditch schedule yet for this year, Harry?"
Harry tried not to gape as Draco sat down next to him the circle for the first time, a light blush dusting his cheeks as he avoided Harry's eyes.
This distraction was caused by Harry and Draco sending each other awkward looks the entire time and seemingly avoiding each other. It didn't help the tension between them that everyone was staring ether and an hour into practice Harry decided to call an end for the day.
Draco smiled, shifting to turn and look at Harry. Draco met Harry's lips as he settled back into Harry, his arms snaking around Harry, pulling him closer. Harry slowly pulled away, pressing another soft kiss to Draco's forehead.
"I haven't been staring at him! And I'm most definitely not going to ask him out! Where on earth did you get the idea I even slightly liked him!! I don't even like him as a friend!" Draco then heard a slight cough from behind him and froze, mentally cursing himself for talking so loud. He turned around meeting the last person he wanted to see: Harry Potter.
"Must I remind you that The Dark Lord nor your father would accept that as an excuse to be befriending her."
"Come on Draco, we're about to start," Pansy called, patting the spot on the floor next to her. Draco made his way over to her as she launched into the rules of the game they'd be playing. "Okay, we're shaking it up again and playing a game called What Are The Odds. Basically person A starts off by spinning this bottle here and when it lands on person B, person A askes B a 'what are the odds question.' This can be anything as long as it's not too explicit.
With that they headed out towards Hogsmeade. At first it was a bit awkward finding something to talk about as they hadn't really hung out together outside of the green house before, but it slowly became easier and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade Neville was clutching his sides with laughter.
"I asked him out," Blaise said, flopping down on Pansy's bed, a stupid smile plastered across his face. The rules that applied to their dorms last year that didn't allow them to enter the girls dorms didn't seem to be in effect this year, probably since they were all legal adults they assumed.
"Boys!" The two boys froze as they heard a loud shout from McGonagall from down the hall, "cut that out immediately! I invited you back here for another year believing you both were mature enough to put this petty behavior aside, and yet I find you two going at it in the hall and frightening the younger years!" McGonagall gestured to the students who were now retreating to the dormitories, following the prefects.
"Oh. Oh," Blaise turned wide, worried eyes onto Pansy as he remembered the drunken admission of the night before. "What are you going to do now? If you get caught-"
"What?" Draco said, finally tearing away his eyes from the Ravenclaw girl to give Pansy a reproachful look, to which Pansy only raised an eyebrow. "I am not."
Draco stared down at his cup, realizing the change in mood. "How are you doing on your arithmancy homework?" Draco said, trying to offer a different topic.
"You have too and it's starting to grate on my nerves! Just ask him out already and get it over with, I can't take this anymore!" Pansy said, dramatically flopping forward onto the table to prove her point. "You're whipped and I'm sick of it!"
"You will, we'll go ahead of you so that you can mope in peace though," Blaise said with a snicker as he and Pansy headed out the doors and into the mass of students in the hall. Draco tried to follow and soon found himself bumping into none other than Potter.
"Well, if the colors have to do with liking someone, what about those who don't like people, ever? Like aromantic people," Hermione said, nodding as Harry seemed to be piecing it together.
Changing was a whole other issue, as soon as Draco took off his shirt Harry was assaulted with the memory of the night before.
"I don't know, but I suppose it's best to just focus on the present right now, and figure the rest out as it comes. Right now let's just enjoy our vacation," Harry said, and then turned to Draco giving a devious smirk, "and on that note..."
It was starting to snow and Harry looked around at the path in front of him, he supposed it would be white by the time they started on their way back to the castle.
When they arrived back at Hogwarts it was almost sunset and the ground was covered in a light layer of snow, just as Harry had predicted.
"Okay," Blaise said, turning to follow Neville up to the castle. After a few moments it became awkwardly quiet and Neville was just about ready to say something when Blaise spoke up.
He had found that ignoring him didn't work very well through and could always feel Harry's eyes trained on him: in the hall, at meals, in class, in their own room even. Draco was slowly going mad. He was just waiting for Harry to strike and tell everyone about how much he seemed to enjoy the kiss (even though he didn't, he told himself), or even for Ron to tell everyone. God knows, Ron hates him. Draco had enough trouble already with being an ex-death eater and all, he didn't want to imagine what it'd be like if it got around that he was supposedly gay (even if it wasn't true, he reminded himself). If that got back to his parents, well, he had no idea what'd they'd do, but it wouldn't be pretty. Harry had managed to save him and his mother from Azkaban, and the wizengamot had miraculously let his father stay out of Azkaban under house arrest, which meant that his dad would definitely find out if it became common knowledge.
“You’re being so rough about it!” Draco complained as Harry stepped on him once again, “Don’t be so violent about it, it’s supposed to be graceful. You’re dancing, not fighting someone.”
"Don't ask me, how would I know?" Harry tried to cast the same charm and one of the vines grabbed a hold of Harry's wrist, "Ah! Get it off!"
Hermione (bless her, Harry thought), seemed to notice he wasn't feeling great and managed to disperse everyone, leading him over to the couch by the fire where they were able to sit down.
"We should talk," Ron said after watching Harry and Draco sprint off up the stairs. He'd have time to wonder about that later, right now he was curious about Hermione.
The annoyances didn't stop there though, when he got to the dining hall Pansy insisted they sit at the Gryffindor table again. Blaise got seated next to Ron who insisted on talking with his mouth full and staring at Hermione the whole time which was beyond annoying.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's abdomen and curled up into him. Just for tonight, he told himself, it means nothing, I'm just comforting him. Draco felt Harry's light breaths ghosting over his hair and watched the rise and fall of Harry's chest as he breathed. Draco wondered what his father would think if he could see him now and let out a long sigh as he fell asleep.
"Yeah, you've got that right," Draco said, slumping back into the pillows. It was quiet for a moment and then Draco noticed the pink highlights in Pansy's hair, "Did you do those yourself?"
He definitely didn't mind. Divination was the worst class in his opinion, but he did feel slightly bad as he left Draco sitting at their shared table.
Hermione sighed and sat back in the cushions, crossing her arms over her chest and looking at the fire as it burned in the grate. "I'm worried about him. He's been acting funny, and I think something happened between him and Malfoy.
"Nope, I care about myself. I don't want to hear you complaining about your shoulder later and I don't want to catch a cold from you either," Draco replied, heading out the door.
"You deserve better than me," Draco started, and Harry was about to interrupt when Draco continued, "What would people think? The savior of the wizarding world, dating a Death Eater-"
How could it possibly get any worse, Harry thought. Now, not only did Harry have to hang out with Draco, he also had to hang out with him in public.
When Draco decided he couldn't wait any longer he reached around Harry, pressing his fingers against Harry's entrance. Draco rubbed his fingers in circles around it, teasing Harry. Harry let out a small whimper as he tried to press back against Draco's fingers and slumped into his shoulder. Draco allowed Harry to press back onto his finger and heard Harry take in a sharp breath. Draco tried moving his finger around a little to try and get him used to the feeling. Harry's hands made their way to Draco's shoulders, squeezing slightly. Draco leaned down to plant a few soft kisses on Harry's clenched jaw.
"I'm headed home to spend it with my dear old mother," Pansy said with a roll of her eyes, stabbing her food with her fork.
Draco was cut off as Harry's fist connected with Draco's face and the next thing either of them knew, they were on the floor punching and hitting.
When the teacher finally got everyone's attention, again, with a pointed glare in their direction, Hermione leaned towards Harry and lowered her voice, "I know what the colors mean."
When they stepped out onto the grounds Harry pulled his scarf around himself a bit tighter, it was colder than usual for October.
"What are we going to do now?" Draco sighed, giving Harry's hand a slight squeeze trying to express his nervousness of what is to come for them.
"I do, thank you, but it just makes it worse," Harry laughed, running his hands through it and messing it up worse.
Harry's hair was sticking up in directions Draco didn't know were possible and, on top of that, Harry was bright pink from laughing at Draco's face slowly becoming more distraught. Draco thought it was terribly cute though and was probably the reason why he hadn't given up earlier.
Hermione and Ron tried to talk to him at breakfast, but Harry wasn't interested and Hermione noted that Harry sat with his back to the slytherin table.
Draco could feel eyes on the back of his head the entire lesson, but was refusing to turn around. After the embarrassing experience of waking up next to Potter, of all people, and no less wake up cuddling him, he didn't want to go near him. If Pansy found out he'd never hear the end of it.
"I'm really glad I invited you too," Blaise let out a nervous, breathy, laugh, "and I've also had a really good time. I'd love to do something with you again some time."
"Yeah," Harry mumbled back, missing his mouth with a piece of bacon. Hermione and Ron shared a look.
"One day I think I'd like to be a teacher here at Hogwarts," Draco said, looking around as they walked down the street, "I'd get to visit Hogsmeade every weekend and teach kids potions. I don't suppose they'd hire a Death Eater though."
Draco had watched as Harry rushed over to his friends across the street and he couldn't help but feel a bit hollow. He'd been hoping to spend more time with him, and hadn't realized how fast the time had gone.
Draco purposely brushed his lips against Harry's neck then and Harry let out a soft gasp. Draco lifted his head then to look at Harry. They gazed at each other a moment and then Draco leaned down, capturing Harry's lips in a soft kiss and that was a bit too brief in Harry's opinion.
When he entered the room, though, he quickly realized he probably should have asked what they looked like. His eyes traveled over the many jars and glass containers and then decided he should start looking on the left side first.
Ginny laced her fingers together on her lap and stared down at them for a moment before gathering her courage and looking up. Ron was giving her a worried look.
"We can do something after practice, how about that?" Harry said, his face flushing as he felt Draco's breath ghost over his neck.
Draco was already in bed asleep with all the lights out. Harry paused and took a moment to stare across the room at Draco and felt his heart throb in his chest.
"Well last night Ron and I.... hung out... and," Hermione started to say, and that's when it finally hit him. Draco was right, or at least partly, Ron and Hermione had been up late cause they were- ugh, he didn't want to think about it, he got the gist and he understood why they were glowing so bright this morning.
Draco was stirring the potion back at the table and had been for some time before deciding to check what had held up Harry. He looked the potion over to make sure it was okay to leave and then headed back to the store room.
“Sure hope so,” Harry said, then broke out into a smile, “On another note, I heard that Honeydukes came out with new candies. Want to go check it out later?”
"Woah, where'd you get that?!" Draco said, eyes roaming over the map, "Is that us?" Draco said incredulous as he spotted their names on the map.
"But seriously, why won't you admit it?" Pansy said, causing Draco to shut his book again with a sigh.
Harry grabbed Draco's wrist and pulled him through the hole. They both had to crouch a bit to get through and when Draco looked up he found himself in a small cave. Just as Harry described, it was completely closed off on both sides, so if you wanted to get out without going through the hole in the rock, you'd have to get a bit out into the water and swim around.
"Yeah, and I've heard he caused all sorts of trouble with it too." Draco laughed and Harry smiled at the sound.
"I don't know if that would have been the best idea," Blaise said, face still red and head running with traitorous ideas.
As soon as the fireworks were over everyone hurried back inside to get warm and Harry was glad to note that everyone was heading to bed just minutes after getting inside.
Hermione and Ron looked at each other before heading after him. They both knew Harry wasn't telling them everything, but they didn't know exactly what it was he wasn't telling them.
Draco looked mildly shocked at Harry's idea, "Have you ever even pulled a prank before? I can't remember you ever pulling one."
"Yeah, I'm good staying for a while. No one will know I'm gone till the morning and I'll be back before then."
"Great. Then on that note, I'm making changes to the punishment." Both Harry and Draco suddenly felt very hopeful. Maybe she'll let us stop hanging out. "From now on, you're not allowed to complete your punishment up in your room. Since you two can't control yourselves in private, I need others to keep an eye on you." Both boys groaned.
Hermione noticed him a moment later, "Ah! Hey Harry, have you been sitting down here long?" she asked sitting down in the chair next to him.
"Ugh!" Draco's sudden appearance startled Harry and he groaned when he hit his head on the shelf above him. "What does it look like I'm doing? I'm looking for the leaves." Harry rubbed the back of his head as Draco rolled his eyes at him.
"Well yeah, I mean, I'd have to be dumb to not realize it after that scene you put on with Parkinson earlier."
Ginny asked Luna next who then asked Seamus. Seamus turned to Dean next, "Who do you think is going to be the next to get into a relationship?"
Draco rolled his eyes and dropped 10 galleons on the desk, "Since I really liked these pieces of rock, then 10 galleons it is." With that Draco turned to leave.
Her curiosity gnawed at her heart but was drowned by guilt and worry. Afterall, it was for her that Pansy was injured. She remembered the moment when the bright light of the curse was coming her way. At that time, she had frozen from the shock and fear. And then suddenly a figure blocked her sight as it took the curse with a pained shout.
He looked at Hermione's downcast and somewhat fearful eyes, " We encountered them while making our way here. At that time, we were tired and hungry and stopped for a short rest in a desert cafe. They came in dressed as manual repair workers and started to throw curses as soon as they saw us "
Neville felt responsible to answer this question , afterall the person was so nice to him . Thus, said incoherently , " Mmmm, very tired, want ….to…sleeeep~~ "
Again in the room of requirements, Harry sat on the sofa beside Draco's , patiently waiting for certain people. They had sent urgent letters to their respective mates , asking them for an audience.
She didn't want to do this. Even if it was the best option she had, even if it was the right thing to do. She still didn't want to do this. She didn't want to erase every memory, every proof of her happiest moments to be erased. She didn't want that love, those hugs to only exist in her memories. The thought of her parents forgetting her and living as if she never existed pained her. She feared that if one day she came across them on a busy road and they didn't recognise her , what would she do ? She feared that one day even she would forget these memories or mistake them for a wild dream. She didn't want that. She never wanted that.
A veined hand crept towards Draco, sliding through his locks , rubbing his reddening lips and caressing his neck. At every touch the lithe body trembled beautifully. The cheeks blushed and ears reddened. Drops of sweat slid down from his neck before disappearing into the white shirt.
Tilting his head to look at Draco, Harry was satisfied to see a pair of wide eyes. Moving away, Harry sat up and gave Draco a sunny smile with dead eyes . Pulling Draco to sit up, he said again , " Come on , up we go . We need to leave as soon as possible "
Together, they walked out of the tent to spot Theo dossing off with his head on Pansy's lap as she slowly stroked his hair.
Leading Harry towards the right corridor of the first floor of the mansion , The elf stopped before the wide mahogany doors  carved with a medicore designs of flowers and plants . With a push, they slowly opened with a negligent creak.
His every nerve was alive and withering, his brain vibrating, his ears abuzz and his sight vibrant. It is absolute euphoric pleasure that he was feeling.
Draco almost banged his head on the headboard behind him due to the mental shock. Looking again, the egg was still there, merrily swinging. In its playful fun, it had knocked many things down and the room was a disaster. It was still playing when Draco saw the tumbling trunk just above the egg, about to smash it into an omelet any second. Without a second thought, Draco pulled the egg out of the ring .
Finally, he slumped back down , " Bleeding, give it away , didn't I ? There I was flogging my way in Diagon alley and then some ministry aid comes up and asked to see my license. Said she wanna lock me up . But I've got children at home , I said . So she made it die with the locket "
"Look at me when I tell you to ", Harry said darkly while grabbing his face to make Draco look towards him.
Now that the room was briefly silent , the small but clear voice of Theo, who was eerily silent since the very start, rang out,  " I seem to have found something phenomenal here as well "
Draco looked at the child with all the dirt and slime on her and frowned saying, "Potter, why don't you bring some warm water and a swaddle cloth. Let's bathe her first."
Ron frantically looked around as he tried to find his family. From some distance, he heard his father shouting for his mother to take his sister and leave. He also saw Bill protectively hugging his new wife , Fluer, as he shot hexes at the men who disrupted one of his happiest memories.
" The vanishing cabinet in the room of requirements. I've been mending it" Draco uttered with huffed breaths in an attempt to cool his racing heart.
Harry didn't stop. The force increased steadily. Ron's face was turning blue. Hermione and Neville were frantic but didn't dare come forward . The Slytherins looked bothered as well.
" The egg is probably of a bird or reptile but the size indicates it being of a larger species . Can you assess it again ?"
When Harry heard Draco's sultry whisper, it was as if a spell on his hands, commanding them to move lower, pull closer, explore wider and touch more. Over that, the light blush in his eyes did nothing to convince his body to stop.
Getting off the bed, he looked at Draco, hand prints on his hips and thighs, bite marks on his neck and chest, Harry's cum mixed with streaks of blood flowing out of his abused hole, his lips swollen and bleeding, his gorgeous face was tear streaked and his enchanting eyes red and glassy.
And don't forget to leave more kudos,  comments, bookmarks as well (I am greedy~ Will you blame me~?)
Blaise looked cautiously at the professor as the man said maliciously, "I noticed that in all the students, you particularly liked last class, didn't you?"
The words still cut deep even if he has heard worse before . He wondered if he will ever get used to them.
Harry's eyes darkened as he said in a voice similar to silence at the bottom of a deep dark sea , captivatingly haunting ," Carefully weigh your words , Malfoy . Once inside other's ears , they always stay there , no matter how much you wish you hadn't delivered them so "
Kreacher's eyes grew impossibly wide and it was as if the pieces of a scattered puzzle came together to make the ultimate picture. His eyes lit with fear and trepidation. But before Draco could understand why , the elf popped away leaving the sentence, "Thank you, Young Master. Now….. Kreacher will do….. wha~t Young master 7requested of …..Kreacher "
Their faces turned towards Theo to see Draco protectively hovering beside him, looking particularly murderous with bloody hands and holding a blood-stained knife. Their faces turned even uglier and somewhat fearful. It felt that if they weren't careful, it can't take much to replace the fish blood with their own. But still, even though reluctant, they obediently did their work. Otherwise, who knows when big bro Draco will even give them a chance to look at the black-haired cutie? Let alone talk to him ! They still had to woo the little cutie !
-Harry gives Draco the first hint of the feelings he holds. in short, he hits on Draco for the first time.
"Like their favorite wine or food. But these are personal preferences. Do you know what the souls in the Netherworld crave the most ?"
But when Draco tried to pull back his hand, Harry gripped it tight and looked into his eyes, saying.
Her eyes looked at her parents in sorrow and reluctance. Her expression showed defiance and unwillingness. She slowly lifted her wand which was held in her hand with such force that even her knuckles turned white.
The shock was evident in Draco's eyes as he looked around. He didn't know this place nor did he have even the slightest tinkling of where it might be. It was the snake corpse which gave him the actual clue.
" And will you keep all the information about the dark lord known from him hidden , never to disclose it without his assertion?"
Everything was silent . Theo was still in his arms , shivering out of fright. Draco loosens his grip and slowly lifts Theo's small face up. Wiping his tears , he silently rubbed the boy's back , trying to calm him down.
Hermione could hear the urgency and anxiety in his voice. Her brows frowned at the sudden worry she sensed for Draco in the voice. But Hermione was a smart girl, she knew when to step ahead and when to step back.
Draco could sense the sadness and melancholy in Harry's voice when he mentioned his parents. Without saying anything further, he silently walked beside Harry.
Soon the discussion was over and finalized , setting the six members on their own ways . They exited the room of requirements , leaving behind Harry and Draco to discuss further .
Harry still kept his gaze vigilant on the old witch as she slowly turned around, "I don't exactly know. And that's the problem."
He was so panicked that he did not even realise the soul on the other side of Draco with his hands still on Draco's chest.
Draco turned around as the woman hurriedly took out a small box from the drawers below the desk and handed it to him. He curiously looked at the box and then at the lady.
" You.. you don't understand ! I…I told him !! I told him !! But ...he...I don't know….." Draco seemed agonised, tortured with the sneer and frown marring his pale face. The reluctance was clear in his pained eyes. He was unwilling but had no other option. The chains of fate were binding him. Now his only hope was the green-eyed allied acquaintance yet unknown stranger. But Draco was rapidly losing much faith in this rescue.
She hadn't woken up or even stored during the entire ordeal. Harry looked at the softly snoring child and snickered, "Is she asleep or dead?"
Reaching the cave, Draco lowered himself down at the center of the cave. Taking out the vials he readied for possible accidents due to the ritual, he set them aside in a corner. He first made a huge array around himself followed by another protection array on the outside. Seating himself at the center of both those arrays, he called out Luar to help him through the process.
Dobby simultaneously climbed on the long table followers by Kreacher behind him as his said , " Dobby was only trying to help. Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon alley which Dobby thought was….curious . And-and then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name "
Draco looked up at the lady and saw the joy in her eyes. His eyes lowered again. He rarely got such innocent smiles. And for the sake of that single smile, He accepted the box. He gave the lady a small smile and said, "Thank you" as he walked out.
Kreacher looked at Draco and at first glance he knew that this young master was a pureblood and a Black as well.
The moon soon disappeared and a new day started. Draco woke up to the fluttering of curtains and warm sunlight on his face.
The man looked in his eyes as if searching for even a bit of invisible fear or hesitance , not finding any , he finally started .
Hearing this, Harry turned to walk forward , clearly dismissing the suggestion. Seeing him walking away, Slughorn was indecisive but still followed after him while continuously calling his name.
Draco's eyes were wide in disbelief. Indirect apartion , as the name suggested, was a form of spell-less and wordless magic which aparated  someone without direct contact but with sheer magical force. It was something that even powerful wizards like Dumbledore found hard to achieve. The only one Draco knew who could successfully do it was the dark lord.
Draco's struggles increased. At this point, he wildly flailed his arms and legs around, hitting harry, shouting insults at him, doing anything that could help get him free. But all of this could not even budge his captor.
Hearing this , Draco felt in a daze thinking about what to do now. It was fortunate that he was able to fill everything he and Harry had inside his pouch .
The sweet scent of maple syrup and warm scent of pancakes made his tummy grumble like a small beast with a witty conscience.
He was beautiful, so beautiful that Harry doubted if it was real. Satisfied, he tidied himself to emotionlessly make his way out of the room, leaving a wrecked and bleeding Draco behind.
"I do have a want. But, it is not a want to take from you but to give. I wish to give you my knowledge. I have been searching for centuries for a person willing and able to pass my knowledge to, but found none. Today is the first time I see someone so suitable, in both character and strength to be my successor. So tell me, child. Do you wish to accept this blessing that I send ? I do not wish to haste you. But remember, even if this gives you a power few could imagine, it's not a path of weak. If you have even an ounce of hesitation, then leave. I won't stop you even if you are the last person that could be my successor. I see that you have a need that cannot be given by this room. You need power, don't you ? To kill your enemies, To protect your near and dear. Power always follows effort. So do you wish ?"
Seconds turned to minutes and minutes turned to hours as the cries stopped and Draco slumped in Harry's embrace, unconscious from exhaustion. He got out of bed and gently laid Draco down, slowly pulling the covers up. Standing at the bedside, he looking at the puffy eyes and wet cheeks. At that moment something rose in Harry's heart. It was dark, cruel and sinister but it wasn't wrong.
Harry looked on as wrinkled and shaky hands tried to light a simple matchstick but failed again and again. Finally exceeding his patience, Harry slowly grabbed the matches and successfully lit a candle.
A gentle smile graced Hermione's lip and she said with a tint of humour, "Actually , I was considering the pavement under a bridge , cool and cosy , isn't it?"
He didn't know if this test was a blessed pleasure  or a painful torture . Harry was fortunate to have a glimpse of what he always wished for but mournful that he will never have it . It was somewhat like how he felt towards Draco , he saw bits and pieces of that incredible puzzle but will never see what the whole picture will look like . It was torturous .
The ones who don't understand the honeyed words will surely understand the language of threat. And Malfoy was exactly of this kind . And Harry was proficient in both .
Exhausted from the tears and pain, Draco soon fell asleep. The next morning he woke up to the sight of a beautiful woman in expensive wizarding robes in front of him. She was sitting on the couch by the window, merrily sipping a cup of tea. Her red hair seemed even more fiery in the golden rays of the sun. As soon as their eyes met, a sneer overtook her face as she gracefully kept the cup down.
Harry scooped a generous amount on his palm and rubbed with both his hands to warm it up. He meticulously placed a well defined and pale foot on his lap and slowly started massaging it.
The coughs didn't stop for a while. Draco repeatedly patted the headmaster's with a hand as he was supporting him with the other. When the coughs receded, the headmaster fell unconscious again.
Ron's sudden anger caused their suppressed worry and fear for him to turn into flaming anger as well.
" Obliviate the thief and send him back from where he came , would you ? And remember to not leave any clue about us as well as yourself "
On the other hand, with each mouthful of blood, Draco's face grew paler and paler. While treating Harry, it was inevitable that he would be affected by some of the poison in the blood.
Harry looked at Draco with an aggrieved look which was completely non-existent to Draco as he hugged the baby towards the bed.
In the inner room, a huge egg was rolling around, wrecking things left and right. When it noticed Draco's presence it stilled for a second and then started to excitedly swinging in the same place.
Draco sat in an elaborate and beautifully carved bed in the Potter Mansion. His being clad in silk robe and surrounded by soft fur . His hair splayed freely over his shoulders and back .
Harry's throat bobbed up and down as he gulped , thinking of his teeth sinking in the Draco's throat .
" Oh ?! Go on ! Why did you stop ?" The amused but sinister gleam in Blaise's eyes as he came nearer was immediately seen. Neville took scared steps back.
" He doesn't have the stomach, just like his father. I'll finish it my own way " ; came another gruff animalistic sound as the speaker consequently stepped forward . It's attributes of being rugged and savage were evident at the first hear and the first look of the owner.
Below the scene, Harry sighed with relief as he lowered his wand. The wand tip was still heated and glowing orange like melting iron. Even if the relief was clear in his eyes, the vengeance was as well. The eyes as sharp as a two-sided sword gazed at the quickly retreating figures as one of them cast the grey clouds to shape into a skull and the slim tall man with wide eyes and a confused face. The confusion and guilt was seen on his wan face . Maybe for the requested killing of his mentor. Or maybe for the death of a tragic and helpless innocent, a student, a child. A young man whose only fault was that he was born to his own mother and father.
Harry's lids halfway dropped as he lazily swirled the liquid in his cup and leisurely sipped it. He wanted to remember this taste, he might never have it again. The green in his eyes swirled like the orange liquid swirling in his cup, just like a tornado pulling everything in it.
And so as the sun disappeared behind the top of the buildings , two normal and inconspicuous teenagers with each a huge bag on their shoulders suddenly appeared in a dark alley beside a busy and bustling street.
Mary's throat choked with emotions as her eyes held years . In a sea of love , she pulled Ron , who still had the face of her husband, and fiercely kissed him right on the lips.
Suddenly , several black shadows entered the place, firing haphazard spells and curses at innocent and ignorant people.
After an unknown amount of time, the pain gradually subsided as Draco , understanding that it was over , let his consciousness slip as a subtle magic caught him and lay him down .
" Looks like you are back . I did not expect you to take so long . And it's master or teacher to you , brat . "
Harry slowly caressed the stray hair on Draco's forehead and sighed, "I don't know. He said that he will be fine after some rest. But….
" Listen carefully , son . Do not go anywhere without this necktie . Do not take the things in the ring out carelessly . Do not use the ring in public . The books I gave you should be kept hidden as well . They are my personal notes . Do not go anywhere near the caster of the slave mark . We will work on it later . And last but not the least , do not go near your parents , either of them ." Luar said sternly , face stiff.
" You know I wanted to visit you but Harry found out and did not let me. I missed you so much, Draco." She said while sitting beside the chained and cuffed Draco.
Harry's gaze slowly cleared with the power of pure will and determination. With the last of the strength he could conjure through the pain, Harry gripped his wand and pointed towards the snake coiled around him, shouting, "
Draco turned his gaze to look at a face with suffering far beyond its age, he whispered, "I guessed."
A shining silver mist poured out of Harry's wand and the Dementors flew back in fright. This gave the lift enough time to move.
Ultimately confused and finding no answer , Draco called the soul ," Umm…. Respected ancestor , are you there ? "
" Come inside the cloak " ; Harry said as he put the cloak over his head , beckoning him to step closer .
"Nothing ! Nothing at all ! Are your ears ringing or something ?", Harry's face furrowed with seeming worry.
As he was about to lay on his own bed , an egg suddenly popped up and went up flying . With it's sight , Harry's eyes grew impossibly wide and his magic subconsciously caught the egg.
As soon as he sat, Draco didn't say a word and started to fill his plate. Breakfast with friends was never an uncomfortable occasion for Draco, he had gotten used to it at Hogwards. But breakfast with Harry Potter staring right at him , whether at Hogwards or anywhere else, was  very uncomfortable. While he wanted to ask him to stop staring , he couldn't. This was the Potter mansion and Harry was his host. Disrespecting his host did not sit well with his manners , neither with his principles. So Draco beneath the heavy gaze, continued his breakfast. He had been under worse eyes, Harry Potter was comparatively easy.
Harry landed on the dirty forest floor with a thump, his back aching from the impact. He swiftly sat up, vigilant towards his surroundings and any dangerous presence. His eyes caught the sight of Hermione sitting beside Ron, her hands coated with his blood as Ron withered from the pain in his shoulder.
"Okay. Calm down. Calm down. It's just a baby. Calm down" ,Harry said as he cautiously lifted the small body, awkwardly holding her.
The intel he got from Ron about what was happening in the Weasley household was far more useful than Harry initially thought. As written in the letter , Mr. Weasley and the order of pheonix were actively planning something. While Ron had no idea about what it might be, Harry did. As a result, Urgent letters were immediately sent to six awaiting recipients.
Draco grabbed Harry's hand which was pointing the wand at the ginger , his eyes glancing at Ron worried. What Ron did was wrong but this is too much even for him.
Hermione vividly remembered the heavy blue of Pansy's eyes as they shone with reassurance that she was safe but soon dimmed with the pain.
Even if Harry knew that this was a journey which will inevitably wear Draco out, it was necessary. Harry was still not 17 then and still had the ministry's tracing charm on him. Using any magic would have directly alerted their enemies and given out their location . While Harry was able to use magic in Potter manor because of its protective charms and barriers , he could not do the same outside. Fortunately, Draco and the other six were all above 17 already and he completed the 16th year of his life as soon as the clock struck eleven tonight, which was the time of his birth.
" I knew it was dark . But something this dark , this evil . I did not expect it. " Dumbledore said suddenly.
Draco lay on the wet bathroom floor, the water pooling around him. His own blood seeping out of his burns and mixing in the water beneath. The skin which was moments ago as pale and smooth as jade, now looked red and black with cripples on it like wrinkled cotton. His ragged breath echoed in the enclosed space, serving as a witness to his pain and life seeping away. For an instant, something like relief shone in his eyes.
The words spilled from Draco's suffocating chest before a choking , silent whisper was heard ," Or he is gonna kill me "
Pansy, with eyes reddened due to anger, was about to retort nastily when the flap of the tent opened and Hermione came in frowning.
Where are they? How did they get here? What just happened? They were in Blaise's room in the Slytherin dormitory just now. Did they apparate? But apparition is prohibited in Hogward's. What just happened?
He watched as the pill colourlessly dissolved before anyone could see it . Draco sighted with glee as Harry ignorantly picked up the glass to sip and soon emptied it . Now Draco only has to wait a day before knowing the result .
Draco sighed at his lack of such common knowledge, "I guess most of the wizarding world has forgotten their own traditions and the reasons behind them. Anyway, We present them offerings, Potter"
Harry did not relent and kept his gentle but unmoving hold . He didn't say anything anymore, trusting to let the storm pass rather than trying to stop it. After some time the flailing weakened and ceased to exist.
He remembered when he destroyed Tom Riddle's diary in second year, it was with a balliski fang. A balliski fang containing balliski venom. But that was the last balliski whom he killed himself. If he was still in Hogward's maybe he could have gone to the chamber of secrets to check if there was some of it still left in the snake corpse. But now….it was impossible.
Sensing his agitation, the voice hurriedly lulled him into sleep as if in the next second he was going to sit up and kill a man already dead, " Sleep now. I will wake you up. Rest."
The child was truly pitiful . The love he received from his family was evident from the condition of his soul . Every magical being has an amazing soul , different from the non magical beings . A magical soul produces magic from his or her emotions . The kind of emotion one feels the same his magic behaves . But even if magic is produced from within , it's not enough . The soul needs a link , a connection to  nature , to another being . This is usually fulfilled when a parent or people around feel such love for a person that their magic acts on it and forms a connection between their souls . It can be a familial one , romantic one or one showing respect and admiration depending on the emotions . The parental soul connections are the most necessary as they flow of emotions between parent and children are extreme , fulfilling the need for protection and love a child needs when young . But astonishingly , Draco neither had a maternal nor fraternal connection . Draco only had three connections , where the two sibling connections are weak and withered showing the terrible condition of the people on the other side . The last one was still strong but isn't a sibling connection or parental connection . It only shows fierce protectiveness and care for Draco but not like a parent or family . It was different and difficult to know what the other person saw Draco as .
Finally done, Draco opened his eyes and made his way into the restricted section, not alarming any barrier and activating any array. Everything was as it was before, silently asleep in the dead of night.
Professor Slughorn seemed hesitant. Opening his mouth, he uttered no words but looked at Draco again and eventually said ," I still advice you to take Mr. Malfoy to the infirmary, Harry"
Setting himself beside Draco, Harry laid down as well. He needed sleep too. Exhaustion was clawing at his body and his temples were already throbbing. Pulling the blanket to cover them , Harry draped his arm over Draco's waist , laying his palm on the egg. Closing his eyes , he thought ,
Harry who was standing on the top of the astronomy tower looked down the last time to make sure that what he wanted was actually done.
"Please . Help me . I can make an exchange with you . I-I can give you anything you want unless I couldn't somehow have it . Please , it's a fair trade . You are a Malfoy , you can see how desperate I am . Please , at least in the name of being my ancestor ."
From the first storey window , Harry watched a jerky and scared man haphazardly putting suitcases in his car . He looked left and right , checking for any dangerous presence . As he confirmed that there was no one watching him , he gave one last look to the house behind before driving away .
The sneer on his face and tension radiated by his whole body made it difficult to tell if it was fear, anger, unwillingness or guilt flooding his heart.
The slender neck was an enchantment in its own . A thirsty mouth instantly opened wide , going for the salty elixir dripping down that jade-like neck . Harry licked , kissed and bit the fair skin .
His eyes first widened and then narrowed. His half lidded pupils darkly looked at Draco. In a second , an astounded Draco was beneath Harry's body . His eyes shining a shade of verdant green displayed an unspeakable danger, hiding deep evil. He slowly leaned down his lips brushing against soft lobes of Draco's ears.
Draco eyes rounded comically before he shut them tight. Harry raised his hand and gently caressed Draco's cheek and waited like a spider with a laid out ready web, waiting for a sweet butterfly to state his hunger.
Fred was the one who answered, "We don't know. She was already unconscious on the forest floor by the time we came"
Harry ,who was outside the door, had never left. He didn't dare leave Draco alone. Who knows when he might disappear again ? Or worse die somehow. He did not like either of those possibilities. So when he heard the call, he readily rushed in forgetting his inner debate entirely.
The doors closed and Harry had a new understanding of anxiety . Taking stiff steps towards ….. somewhere.
Krecher who was behind him softly tried to come forward but was immediately pushed back as dobby continued in one minded focus , " A-and then Dobby saw Kreacher talking with the thief -"
The balance which already wasn't steady soon disappeared making the man collapse face on to the floor.
Ahhh, this naughty one ! Why does he always keep popping here and there ? Isn't he afraid of cracking up and breaking ?
The emerald eyes gleamed and a mouth latched on the pale nape as if a starving beast on a table full of tender meat.
" Fine. If it can help me gain an upper hand on Voldemort, then I am willing. But ! Before that, you have to make an unbreakable vow that whatever you said is true."
Harry was guarding the perimeter when Draco exited the tent with two empty plates in his hand. And suddenly, Harry felt a sour feeling rise in his chest. He wondered how can Draco be so…..so caring ? He hadn't even eaten his own food but chose to bring some to his snakes first.
The well defined hand rested against warm and moist cheeks, the dark complexion looking particularly harmonious against the rosy and fair face.
With shaking hands , Slughorn pointed his wand at his own temple bringing out a bright thread of his memory to put it into the vial he retrieved from his coat pocket . Harry grabbed the shaking wrist to properly deposit the memory into the vial.
Harry felt a tingle of resentment in his chest. When talked about Theo , Draco vehemently opposed as if it was his own son . And Harry ? What about Harry ? Let alone opposition to putting him in danger , he didn't even blink an eye when sending Harry off ! On the other hand , Pansy , Hermione and even Ron got a personal caution warning from Draco ! But for him ? Not even a look , let alone a word !
George looked at Harry and took out some objects from his bag. A book, a golden snitch and a small device. On further examination, Harry realised that the book was one of the old editions of Tales of beedle the bard and that the small device was actually a deluminator.
Ron's eyes shone with gratefulness and admiration. He instantly put his hand up with great vigour and said ," I am sorry as well . And thank you for healing me "
Harry stood there , searching Malfoy's eyes . He could see the helplessness , the tiredness and risk swirling in those silver eyes , like the dark blemishes on the face of fair moon . He kept his lips pursed tightly , his head bowed down.
Harry and Draco shared a silent tacit look as Draco said , " We need to find the horcruxes as soon as possible and that is what we will be doing . "
In Harry's brain wheels turned after seeing the scowl. With a slight smirk and bright eyes, Harry relaxed thinking  ,
Just like this, Fred went to call Kreacher out and George started to clean the pile of fishes enough for 12 people alone. After some moments, Fred came back with Kreacher.
" Okay " Ron said , as Pansy pushed him out and Ron felt that he was being pushed in the eighteenth layer of hell.
Did he really cry on Harry? Was yesterday really not an absurd dream? Before Draco was sure that it was a dream, but now met with such a gaze, he wavered and doubted himself. At this moment Draco really wanted to crack Harry's brain open and see what's inside. Maybe even slip poison in his food to ensure the matter hushed once and for all. His doubtful gaze looked at Harry squinting like a cat. He searched for any abnormal signs but found none. Seeing this Draco relaxed slightly , thinking that his pureblood young master, the Malfoy heir and the perfect Slytherin pride was still intact and he did not cry like a princess in the hero's arms in reality. Just thinking that he dreamt this was shameful enough that he could feel his ears burn, the horror of it being reality was too much for Draco to handle, so much so that he would leave the nose-less devil to rot and find ways to strangle Harry and bury his body.
Luar , rolled his eyes again , and said," Don't look at me like that ! Is there anything wrong with giving my property to my heir ?"
This time Draco's face softened again as he said , " I am your brother , right ? Then listen to your brother and don't worry , will you ?"
Draco gave a resigned sigh and remained quiet . Was fate playing with him ? First giving him a disaster and then a fortune but not letting him do anything . It was ridiculous . Utterly ridiculous , How his whole life has come to be .
His wait didn't go to waste as soon Draco, who saw no hope of Harry leaving before he came, walked in the dining room and sat in the chair opposite of Harry.
Giving them a very rare and small smile  , Draco placated them ," I am fine . It's nothing a nap cannot cure.  Just found some very interesting books yesterday and spent the night reading them ."
Harry opened the book and realised it was on legilimency and occlumency . Surprisingly , it was handwritten . The book itself was only imaginary . He could not take it out of his mind.
Morning soon came. Draco, thinking that he unknowingly fell asleep last night, put even more effort to his tasks. Soon everything was ready and they were set to leave.
" Master Draco is so nice to Kreacher but why was Master Draco never nice to Dobby ? Dobby only begs Master Draco to tell him this " the elf's head lowered as if waiting for a strike to land in his face .
Harry's eyes were dark and deep as if hiding an unavoidable grudge. He looked like a demon out to take a bloody revenge. And Draco did not remember anything he did to deserve it….. At least recently.
As soon as the words uttered, a loud " Avada Kedavra" echoed in the voice of Severus Snape as twin tails on green light shone from two different wands flowing towards the same man.
Hermione sat beside the weak but conscious Pansy in the tent. They had quickly transferred Harry and Pansy in the two available tents. While Draco looked after Harry in the next tent, Hermione was asked by him to look after Pansy. Even if Draco didn't ask her, she would have come by herself anyway.
It must be. Otherwise, who else knew about this other than him ? Even the headmaster himself didn't know. An intense jolt of happiness ran down Draco's body. A small smile lighted his face as his silver-blue eyes shone gratefulness and relief.
When it was finally the day, Draco woke up with a grim appearance. Every thought in his head was about the impending task. The morning passed and he did not see Harry at all as he finally felt his own nativity at trusting him at such a level . All of his snakes were hyper aware and alert, doing their ordered job flawlessly. The palpitations in his heart were fluttering as every second passed.
Hearing this, Draco's lips pursed and he was about to speak but Harry's firm voice stopped his words short.
Draco has been feeling eyes on him for some time now . Given his hypersensitivity to a certain Savior-slash-golden boy-turned-stalker , he knew exactly to whom these eyes belonged . This had Draco sighing in exaggeration .He knew how Harry saw him and of his guard against Draco . Putting it bluntly , he knew why Harry did all of this . And this did nothing other than Luar demanding to curse the supposed saviour to save his son from a perverse stalker who , according to him , was going to corner Draco and then dirty his precious body and ruin his prestige by ravaging him . OH!!!! Such a tragedy ! Though certain people would definitely rejoice that . As to who , you and I both know that , don't we ?
Harry soon noticed the smooth reddened manhood standing erect near his own buried in Draco's hole. Haah ! Such a whore !
A dread rose in Draco's heart as he looked at Harry's face and lowered eyes. Eyes wide in horror , Draco ran out of the room tripping and falling . Like this Draco entirely forgot what he was going to say and ran in a flustered manner.
" They can't . My magic is far superior to anyone in this castle . If there had been someone like that here , I would have already sensed him the moment I got out was of the buried treasury ."
Draco still stood facing Harry, pretending to be talking with him to let Harry unobstructively observe the opponent. It was just that he didn't know that Harry had already blown the cover long ago.
Wishing to indulge a little longer , he moved towards them . He did not know if the decision was right or wrong . As he came closer , he drew their attention .
The shopkeeper frowned mildly, "It's considered quite rude to call these pieces of treasure as pieces of rock, gentleman."
Tears slid down the elf's wrinkled cheeks as he repeatedly gasped to choke out a quivering thankyou.
He again opened his eyes to find himself back at his dorm , in his bed . His invisibility cloak still at the table . It was like nothing happened and it was all a dream if not for the presence he now felt in his consciousness . He somehow knew it was that oldman . It was like a ball of light , tightly snuggling in a corner . He tried knocking on it . To his surprise , the ball of light took the shape of a human , a man . Harry observed that the man looked like in his early forties and wore something like a wizarding robe but shorter with the front closed , better fitted and tight sleeves as well as without the hood . He looked like a rough and wild man , untamed and unmannered . Just like him .
The witch took him to a room before slowly turning around. She beckoned him to come closer as if to tell a precious secret. Harry hesitantly leaned forward.
His gloomy eyes swept across the room. As they landed in Neville, a look of sick eagerness and enjoyment on his face.
Draco looked at the awkward way Harry held the child and the uncomfortably expression on the baby's face and sighed.
" Do you know what happened today? Today at the ball Harry gave us a big surprise! Do you know what?" She asked, her eyes shining with anticipation for the answer. Not getting it, she ultimately continued.
Opening the drawers , he searched for the locket all the while keeping his ears open for any sound from the outside. Suddenly, his eyes caught the picture of a very familiar oldman - Dumbledore. Harry took the file out . Scanning through it , he say many familiar names and faces , some do them crossed out and some stamped with the words ' TREASON '.
Magazine and wanted flyers  flew past above their heads to neatly land in the table kept at the side. Harry could cleary read what it said -
Draco's curly blond lashes slowly lowered , casting a dark shadow on his eyes . Theo , who silently looked at all of this happen , spoke up , " Draco ? "
" Oh , Harry.  My baby . Mother missed you so much . Look how thin you have gotten . Does Dumbledore not feed you ?
London was damp and cold today. The clouds overcast as of a reminder of all the misfortunes in their life.
Neville turned his head to see Blaise coming towards him to gently help. Sitting up, Neville shrugged off the hands on his shoulders.
Maybe it is better that Dumbledore die. At  least  no one will actively push them in the pit. With Dumbledore gone, they will be more or less one step closer to safety and one step further from danger. But with this kind of risk, if was more of a harm than benefit.
Moving back to stand straight, Harry caught the sight of Draco innocently rubbing his eyes, tears gathering at the end of his silky lashes.
Green eyes nonchalantly lifted to the moon, "Doesn't the moon look especially beautiful tonight? It seems a waste if I don't enjoy such sight-"
And honestly, the depth of these feelings terrified her. Harry's love for Draco was so deep that it bordered on obsession. Maybe it was already mixed with obsession.
Seeing Malfoy keeping his gaze , Harry felt his eyebrows twitch . It was always like this .Each and every time . Those silver eyes always did something to him . It gave him the illusion that Draco was like a prey staring at his predator . He was so innocent , thinking he can take Harry on , thinking that he was a hunter and Harry was his catch . If anything he should be thankful that he thought so . If he showed even a grain of fear ….. if he just dared to turn his eyes away  , Harry knew that he would pounce on him like a lion on his prey , aiming for his throat , aiming for a kill .
Silently whispering the password and walking inside , Draco somehow managed to get into his bed without waking anyone up . Now , under the covers , He lazily thought about the classes of tomorrow and the homeworks when he found himself wondering if anyone can sense Luar's magic or presence . If anyone , especially Dumbledore or Voldemort , did then the result would be disastrous . Just thinking about it gave him goosebumps . Doubting himself , he silently whispered , " Hey , Papa ?"
Malfoy catches both of Harry’s wrists, wraps his fingers tightly around them. “What the fuck are you talking about?” he whispers.
“So, you had to just throw it here? My desk is not a bin.” Harry finally finds what he wants and glares at him. Malfoy smirks and flips him a finger. Harry wants to punch him and then hex him for good measure.
So this morning he barged in my room again, requesting I accompany him outside. At least he left after making his demands.
