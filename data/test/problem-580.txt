“Listen up, Ravenclaws! Okay, I think most of you were there for my announcement in the common room but for the record: My name is Darcy Graves, I'm in 6th, I play beater and I've been voted captain end of last year. First of all, we're going to warm up together so I can watch your flying. If your flying is crap, you're out. Then I'll split up into groups depending on the position you're trying out for. The try outs will be in style of a competition. If you can't deal with that, you're out. Got that?”
(They decided to not bother about Quirrell for now because he seemed harmless and had probably been dragged into all of this by Snape anyways.)
A thought crossed Draco's mind: When they were here that meant that his friends had to be back as well. Like this he left the dorm and walked down towards the Slytherin common room, the catchy melody still stuck inside his head.
Malfoy's did not
"Oh, Harry, darling. Are you okay? You frightened us to death. You could've ended up
McGonagall's voice brought him back to reality and he made his way up to the chair. With every step the whispers around him grew louder and he got more nervous.
And he found him! Actually he found four of them sitting together at the other end of the long wooden table. Harry identified them as Ron and his siblings, whom he remembered from the train station.
After Harry's first History of Magic lesson the same afternoon he could totally see why.
"Good Morning, Mr Malfoy. I'm very honored to have you here. Oh, and as I see you've brought young Mr Malfoy, too. It's a pleasure to meet you, young Sir!"
“He's still around here. I feel it. His laugh is freaking me out.”
He could swear he saw Draco’s face slip into a grin for a moment.
“…Maybe I just like drinking from two glasses at the same time?”
rewritten from my memory with a few changes.
. His personal safe house. Home. In a truly desperate moment a nice, brunette girl crossed his mind which made him groan out loud at his own pathetic behaviour. Never again would he talk to that Mudblood Hufflepuff. Langdorn could get lost if she thought otherwise. The basilisk page turned out to be useless. It just didn't really fit all that much and as he'd worked himself through all magical creatures books in their Manor library he had to wait until Hogwarts before he could resume his research. Still, when Draco was packing his things three days early because he didn't have anything better to do, he carefully put the by now creased piece of parchment between the first two pages of
“Now, I want the rest of you to stand in groups, depending on which position you're trying out for.”
On Monday Harry was reluctant to go to the library. Ron dragged him all the way there, accepting the fact that he would be late for class because of it.
Harry nodded again.
Her face went serious immediately and she answered,
“Sure thing, Harry!”
Hermione asked in an accusing tone.
And under this sink cowered the one and only Hermione Granger, trembling and in shock. She looked frightened to death when the troll raised a wooden bat in size of a small tree. Harry did the only thing that came to his mind.

But it was annoying nonetheless and knowing that his father owned objects that he had to sell because they could get them into big trouble with the ministry – It was unsettling. Some days he told himself that he shouldn't be judging his own father's actions, but he cared too much not to. Draco was first in their usual carriage. Sitting down in a seat by the window, he closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
“Oh. Oh, so are you like… I mean I don’t want to assume, I just- you know, I’m bi so…”
Before Harry could give a retort, Blaise cut him off.
Seemed like he had to take it very slow at first. He waited with the next attempt until dessert. In the meantime he thought about what he could say without offending the silent boy.
"But-"
Narcissa's soft voice tore Draco from his sleep gently. Slowly he blinked his eyes open to be greeted by his mother's beautiful smile.
"So, the door knocker is going to ask you a riddle every time you wish to enter. You need to answer it correctly before the door opens. Watch!"
"No need to get one. There are four, standing right behind you!"
The house elf looked down.
They didn't want him home.
The hall immediately fell silent.
They had a great afternoon: Draco showed off with his new broom and they talked a lot until their parents picked them up around tea time.
Percy leaned down to hug her – a little stiffly but better than no hug at all – before he threw a glance over his shoulder. Molly followed her son’s eyes.
This evening Hedwig was a happy owl and Harry didn't even get scolded for taking so long. Turns out they had been at the swimming hall with some of Dudley's bully friends.
He had luck.
The next four weeks passed by in a rush and suddenly the holidays arrived. Most of the students left and Christmas Eve came.
For several minutes after that he strolled through the castle aimlessly, wrecking his head for a solution. Somehow, he ended up in the entrance hall, where his stomach immediately reacted to the amazing smell of food wafting over from the great hall. Was it lunchtime already?
Draco wanted to scream at her to just take them but eventually settled for a tight smile and a short “Of course, Ma’am.” Before he left.
“There isn’t. But I promise you, you will like it. And if you don’t, I’ll let you choose for me next time it’s my turn.”
When Narcissa answered she wasn't shouting anymore but she sounded at least twice as dangerous as before.
As an answer Harry held up his in bandages covered arm.
Nobody was to see him cry.
"Oh!"
Harry left Draco’s positively ruffled hair alone and used both his arms to hold Draco in a loving embrace. “Well, I wouldn’t know. But I’d rather have you tell me about your sexy dreams than talk about the fact that I’ve never had a normal dream in my life.”
Draco's eyes went wide when he saw Harry throwing the cloak over his shoulders, or better: not saw.
“Okay, with makeup then. Come on, I’ll do it for you!”
What?
It's been more than a whole ass year and i deeply apologize for that. I graduated from Highschool and am now going to University and I am getting into a new routine of sorts, so I hope you won't have to wait all too long for updates from now on. I know I may have lost a few readers but that doesn't matter. If you are still here and enjoying my writing, I hold all the love in the world for you!
"Hedwig!"
When Harry woke up again he felt slightly better than before. His head still hurt like hell but he could easily move without feeling like vomiting. He sat up on his bed and reached for his glasses. Now able to see properly again he spotted a bowl of cold soup on his nightstand. The watch lying next to it told him it was about 4 in the afternoon but Harry couldn't be sure it still was the same day. He tried to remember what exactly had happened. One thing he was sure of was that he had been sick and that the Dursleys were very angry at him.
He didn't do anything wrong, did he?
He gave Percy a soft peck on the lips before getting up from the sofa.
"Me as well. It looked fascinating how the players soared over the sky at the match. Must feel so much greater than having to fly in a height less than your own body height."
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
Draco felt a tugging in his stomach.
He'd gotten quite used to the way these riddles worked and barely struggled with them anymore.
“Bloody hell no! Nevermind, you do you. I’ll always have your back, alright?”
on a regular basis because it helped him getting adjusted with the current situation.
What else would you call this place, really?
Madam Pince had apparently long given up on teaching the girl manners.
"Everything you wish,
After giving Hedwig a sympathetic look he finally went downstairs to get it over with. It went as well as possible in a situation like this. Didn't mean he could avoid doing the chores today but he got away with the less energy draining tasks. Still, when he went to bed this evening, he felt like a horde of trolls had just ran him over.
“I know you like to give everyone makeovers, Pansy, but he’s definitely not worth your time. I’m not even sure he looks at his clothes before he puts them on.”
"Oh they are no wizards. They're the family of my muggle aunt."
Except from Potter and him there were three other first year boys in Ravenclaw, one of whom he actually knew.
Wait, was he waiting for Harry to do something? Harry’s expression probably looked really stupid right then.
"Come on boys! Can it really be

points from him in
“See you tomorrow. Then I can start teaching you being nice. Sleep well. Oh and watch out for Nargles!”
Draco stumbled and almost fell onto his behind but the hand held him upright. Anyway this had created a loud sound and suddenly the three-headed creature lunged forwards and started to bark loudly.
Great, now he was really talking. More than Harry had expected actually.
The other students had stopped doing their thing and curiously watched the scene. Harry could've sworn he heard Malfoy snicker from the back but did his best to ignore it. Finally Professor Flitwick approached them.
Sadly, there were still enough people in this class who were clinging to his lips like he was some sort of invincible sorcerer or something impressive like that. It was painful to watch.
. The
At lunchtime Pansy, Blaise and Theo arrived - his mother knew he prefered them to stupid Crabbe and Goyle - and Dobby along with two other house elves served them some amazing Fish and Chips.
After potions they had a double DADA with Lockhart. Draco really didn't get the hype about him. Yeah, fairly speaking the man was really handsome and his smile was dashing but apart from that the guy was just dull. What he wrote in his books was just as interesting as any special edition of the Witch Weekly's magazine and he sometimes literally nicked them from his mother to be able to fall asleep. How could a guy be so self absorbed that he started the class with a quiz about his personal pudding preferences and similar nonsense? Draco had been glad to find he hadn't been the only one rolling his eyes at Lockhart's comment of, “You should know, I was a Ravenclaw as well and now look where I am today!” As if Lockhart was a person to look up to.
His eyes were full of panic.
He was so stunned that he totally forgot why he was here in the first place. Until the door fell shut in his back and he suddenly got aware again of the letter which was still clutched in his right hand, the expensive parchment crumpled. Draco gulped and slumped onto the couch facing the crackling fire.
But on the other hand, people had started to get over it. Draco was working as a healer and many people only saw his face after he had already saved their lives. Things were getting easier again. He was slowly overcoming the guilt that had been eating him up during the first years after The Battle. The past slowly started to become his past and he was instead focusing on turning himself into the best version of Draco Malfoy there could be.
The moment they reached it they threw it close with both their body's and locked it.
"Well as long as you're not losing points on purpose and try your best to get them back in the other subjects, I see no point in not trying to get to know you."
Then his gaze wandered over to the other bed. He gasped, seeing Harry Potter lying still under white sheets, a bandage was slung around his head. Draco's heart rate picked up a bit as he slowly walked closer. When he saw Harry's chest moving up and down he let out the breath he'd been holding. He was alive.
“So, if you’re technically done with school for the day and you’re obviously not interested in studying or doing homework while you’re here, why don’t you go home or have a walk around the neighbourhood or something? The weather is nice today.” He said it like it was a genuine question and not like he was trying to get rid of him.
Of course this girl knew for sure that he was. She just tried to be polite. Harry gave a  her short nod.
Harry said to Ron, hoping that the other boy has at least paid a little more attention than he had.
When Harry had told his parents about the whole thing his dad had reacted pretty similarly to Ron and Hermione. His mother had been more supportive of the idea. The proud smile on her face when she had said “that’s my boy” was stuck with Harry. She would probably be disappointed as well, finding out that he wasn’t able to continue his scheme.
(See the end of the chapter for
"A crush is when you fancy someone."
“Oh, look, Blaise! Potter is on the floor! Really, the people of this school need to stop littering!”
Once again, agreeing murmurs surrounded Draco. They all had something to say on that topic and only after about an hour of verbally abusing their headmaster, he excused himself to the bathroom.
They were running late. Of course. Getting six kids all packed up and into the car was a huge mess. They were just about to leave when Fred ran back inside again to fetch some joke articles. He came back and Mr Weasley had already started the engine when Ginny shrieked, claiming she'd left her diary – her brothers teased her about that during the whole ride. After that they were finally able to go. They took the flying car, even though they didn't fly (“Molly, we'd be so much faster!” - “I said no, Arthur!”), but Mr Weasley had enlarged it on the inside so the eight of them would all fit without a problem.
And the pain that came with the memory!
she was barely able to force the words out of her mouth.
There was a sting somewhere in his chest. It had settled there somewhere around the time he had realized he might never get to see Draco smile or laugh at him again. The worst thing about it was that it was his own fault. And that he couldn’t think of anything that would be able to fix it.

give it to an innocent school girl and it was probably full of dark magic.
“Okay, everyone! I'm sorry, but you four”, she pointed at the two that finished last and two other guys, “you're out. Keep training and come back next year.”
Draco loved spending time with his mom on his own but he really wanted his dad to be here. He didn't treat him like a little child like she did. And Draco had heard Blaise talk about how all his grandparents and uncles and aunts were coming for christmas and his birthday. Draco knew his grandparents were all dead except his mother's mother but she was at St. Mungo's and didn't remember anyone who ever visited her. His father had been an only child and his mother's sisters... well, she didn't like to talk about them but he still knew that the oldest one, Bellatrix, was in Azkaban.
The two fighting boys turned to look at what had caused the sound and about two seconds later the blonde one was eye to eye with Harry.
Now that Harry didn’t have Draco to look at anymore, he tried to find something else in the cafeteria that would catch his interest.
That couldn't have waited until tomorrow?"
Draco turned his head and locked eyes with Harry. “The cells were in Gryffindor colours and there was mistletoe hanging from absolutely everywhere.”
"What are you laughing at?"
To his surprise he came across Malfoy on his way, who was walking in the opposite direction.
As a result, Harry currently had to spend every Monday and Thursday afternoon hanging around school grounds on his own. Handling boredom was not one of his talents.
The exchange went perfectly well; but then everything went wrong.
Marietta was literally jumping from excitement and the words were just bubbling out of her mouth.
But then first the handshake thing and then the sorting and he was just full of it and it was just their first real day here.
"Wow, Draco, that's
His mother's pink lips curled into a soft smile.
One side of him wanted to forgive his father, his big idol. After all he'd said sorry - even though Malfoys usually didn't do that - and, as his father had said, he was
And with a loud
“There you are, Scarface. And I've had all my hopes up that you couldn't make it this year.”
Now go read, I've made you wait for it long enough :)
It was Ron who spoke first.
Percy, the prefect -how could he not remember that he was a prefect as he made it as obvious as possible- and the twins, Fred and George. As the black haired boy walked by, he asked:
She waved it off and took the money while Harry stared at her in wonder, about to complain. He wanted to pay for everything!
Harry turned around to find that Ron -or rather the whole Weasley family- were gathered a few meters in front of them. In an instant Mrs Weasley was at his side, fussing over him.
"Harry! The lawn needs to be mown!"
“But we are different. You know, you are you and you are amazing and you have a good job and you always do the right thing and I’m just that guy who’s good at volleyball. What if- what if they think I’m not good enough for their perfect angel?”
Suddenly it came to him.
"Dobby is, Sir!"
Draco peaked up as the crowd loosened and a soft chatter settled over the room from all sides. That must have been about the Quidditch tryouts. Seemed like he had plans for Sunday now. And he knew how to spend the afternoons leading up to it. He itched to get on his broom just at the thought of it. There was no way in hell he would let this opportunity slide.
Draco was awakened from his stupor by the sound of footsteps approaching the corridor. He closed his gaping mouth and levitated the bundle of brooms into the room in a hurry and as soon as that was done the door fell shut behind him on its own. Draco examined the various hallways of clutter in full concentration in order to remember where he came from. There weren’t many places he could hide the brooms efficiently. Every good spot seemed to be taken already and as hard as it was to find this room in the first place, a lot of people seemed to have done it in the past and he didn’t want to risk anything.
"Okay, now just lean back and try to stay still and relax. Oh, yeah. And you're supposed to have your gaze fixed on..."
The next weeks Harry spent a lot of time with Terry, Michael and Anthony, as well as Cho Chang. Terry continued helping him in potions which forced Snape to give him at least acceptable grades and lead to Malfoy having one reason less to insult and laugh at him. Malfoy did this a lot lately. But at the moment Harry had more important stuff on his mind. Norbert the baby dragon had grown so much, that he, Ron and Hermione had started trying to avoid visiting Hagrid's hut as often as possible because they feared to leave it with singed hair. They had come to the conclusion, that it was best to somehow get that dragon to Ron's brother Charlie in Romania. Now the only problem was to make Hagrid agree with them. While it was Harry and Ron's job to convince him on that matter, Hermione was busy with studying for the end of year exams -yeah, she had already started with that- and with doing research on the philosopher's stone.
He only stopped when they had eventually arrived at the ground keeper's so called
“Fuck off, Malfoy. I was just-,” Harry wrecked his brain for an excuse, “ I was picking something up.”
His father had been right.
It was real!
“Why do you always have to be so damned vague?”
When Hermione and Harry had reached the bottom of the stairs they suddenly heard voices.
His mother's face fell a bit in disappointment but his father's proud nod made up for it.
She tutted, shaking her head. But instead of fixing them with a spell like she did on the train, she asked another question.

"What, 'Mione? It's our only chance!"
+(-)+(-)+(-)+
“I still don’t get why you are doing that number thing, it’s so silly!”
Hedwig almost bit him when he placed the bread in her cage. She hadn't had food since their return from Hogwarts. Harry already had had to put up a big fight that she wouldn't be locked away in the cupboard under the stairs - also known as his former bedroom - with the rest of his wizard stuff. Instead there was now a lock keeping the cage closed so he wouldn't send letters to “other freaks like him“.
He was sick.
In an attempt to finally discover whatever was sleeping in here, he stepped further into the room. Suddenly he stopped in his tracks.
“I didn't-”
And his friends. All people he had known before....they had all been sorted into Slytherin....or were at least going to be. He would be all alone.
"What are you waiting for, Mikey. Play something."
“Is there something you could do about it?”
"Harry? Are you there?"
Desperately wanting to look at the beautiful man again, he luckily managed to convince himself to say something before giving in.
His heart warmed at the words and he couldn't hide his smile when he whined, "Don't call me that, mum! I'm not
The question consumed Draco's mind and drowned out any other impressions. Usually he loved shopping but right now he couldn't focus on the robe Madam Malkin was fitting on him for even a mere second. Actually being in this dressing room just made it worse. Here was where everything started. Here was where he’d met
He had seen him before at the leaky cauldron with Hagrid. Weird guy. He seemed so shy because he was always stammering but then he seemed to be around 30 years old and it just didn't fit into one picture
Pansy screeched.
Something about her voice was weird. Harry searched the stands for Ron and found him looking very uncomfortable between Colin and Lockhart.
Harry’s heart went crazy. He couldn’t have heard that correctly, right? But now it was definitely time for him to say something.
"What? Oh sure."
Pansy smirked like she was competing with the devil while Harry collected his things and shoved them in his bag roughly. Hermione winced. Harry heaved the bag onto his shoulder and went to leave, but not without casually wishing Draco and Pansy a nice day again. This time, Malfoy straight up ignored him.
The last two players landed next to the crowd and Darcy clapped her hands again, calling for silence.
Then he let himself lock eyes with Draco and immediately had to take a shivering breath. This was a terrible idea. Malfoy would make him look ridiculous in front of everyone. And it would be so easy for him as well.
. An incredible mass of people - especially witches of all ages - were crowded inside the small bookshop. All of them blushing and giggling and overall being excited. A shriek from Hermione brought clearance into their confusion.
Even though the previous day’s events had exhausted Harry deeply, he was up and about at sunrise – a habit that's harder to get rid of than one might think – and on his way to pay Hagrid a visit. The other boys had all still been asleep when he‘d left the dorm so he didn't get to actually reunite with them, yet, but he'd been glad to see them all back and well.
(-----------------------)
“Thursday. I’ll be waiting in front of the gates.”
“Yeah. Could you help me take it off again please?”
Hedwig hopped onto Harry's outstretched arm, flapping her wings slightly and let him take a short note out of her beak. Then she went to nibbling his earlobe affectionately. The note, judging by the unruly handwriting and the huge amount of misspellings, was from Hagrid, saying that he'd like to meet him after the Quidditch game and that Harry should visit him with his friends in his hut.
. Somehow he found that fitting and smiled to himself about it. He smiled because soon he would be back at school.
Harry cleared his throat to regain control over his voice. “Thanks, Luna.”
Draco chuckled and went back to copying.
But he couldn't. No.
Sighing Harry shook his head to get rid off the anger welling up inside him. The git had gotten even more insufferable over the last weeks, though he just couldn't get it over with being offensive to him.
Curious, he took a look around.
Then Harry also made his way to the Ravenclaw tower, up the spiral staircase and greeted Malfoy who was already trying to solve the door knockers riddle.
The door swung open and without any further exchange of words they went to bed.
Exams were finally over and Draco was pretty sure he did very well in all of them. Well, except for astronomy maybe but who cares for that nonsense? He had also managed to treat Potter and his friends the way his father would approve of even though every insult that came back from
Ron and Hermione gave him a nod each and Harry spoke,

Therefore he found himself again in front of the door to the left corridor on the third floor.

only spoke up when he'd taken a first sip of the tasteful hot water.
"It's so rare to have two muggleborn wizards or witches in one family"
Everytime his fingertips brushed the expensive parchment he felt a rush of confidence and happiness going through his body.
A caption read:
“Man, I can't wait to see Fred and George's faces when they see you play for the first time!”
"Come, Draco, my dear. We want to discuss something."
Harry left the library with a feeling of triumph. He couldn’t wait to tell Hermione and Ron about this.
Loony! Yeah, loony!
Curious, he closed the space left between him and the door with a few steps and put his ear against it.
Before he could start thinking about what exactly it had been he put his mind on off-mode until he was in his own compartment again. On the way back Draco caught a glimpse of Harry looking at a picture in this weird photo book he had turned up with a few days ago. His lips were pulled into a soft smile but his eyes were sad. Despite that he somehow looked quite cheerful. It was confusing.
Harry took a seat next to Ron,
The room was giant. Grander than any other room Draco had ever been in - and he had been to the Ministry of Magic before. The walls were so far into each direction, it seemed to have none at all! And it was filled with piles over piles of everything.
"Who is there?"
"Ronald, don't even finish that sentence! I think it's best to sleep over all of it! Good night, Harry!"
on a regular basis and damn, talking about it did help a lot (even though it was annoying that
Harry took a deep breath. Apparently, she wasn’t joking. Someone must have told her about what he had done on Thursday. And, apparently, she wanted him to continue doing it.
"What is it? What are you smirking at?"
"Come down and make breakfast, boy!"
Much love to everyone who has been patiently waiting for an update and generally to everyone who keeps supporting me <3
And with that he made his way up to the Ravenclaw tower, slipping behind the tapestry next to the door and Loony scrambled up to follow him. Thinking back on it, he probably did do the best he could to help her, as he had showed her the right way to the common room. When they arrived at the door knocker, the first year answered the riddle without thinking for even a second and Draco was surprised when the door actually opened. Maybe the too-dreamy-for-her-own-good girl actually did belong in Ravenclaw. They stepped into the busy room, a few people hanging about the windows to catch the last bit of sunlight with their books, but a large group was gathered around a tall girl with a light brown-reddish straight ponytail who was talking animatedly.
After three cups of very sugary tea Harry made his way back to the castle where he joined Ron and Hermione for breakfast with a smile on his lips and probably a red nose from the cold.
"Obviously! Why does this surprise you?"
A lump had built up in his throat while reading and he felt tears welling up as his excitement shattered into daggers, piercing his heart. His eyes watering, he turned around on the spot and rushed out of the hall.
A slight push and the door swung open. Quickly they entered and closed the door behind them before pulling off the cloak and crossing the room towards a black, discreet door behind the teacher's desk which would hopefully lead into Snape's office.
He had no right! This was private!
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes for dramatic effect, but he never dropped his grin. Then he cuddled up with Harry, who was leaning against the headboard, and started talking.

A few minutes later Madam Hooch blew her whistle and 14 teenagers soared into the air, seven in green, the other seven in red robes. Now it didn't take long to ban Potter from his mind. This was his passion!
+(-)+(-)+(-)+
And -
"Um,...Malfoy. Would it bother you to walk to the tower alone. I..."
"Oh. Morning Malfoy. Have you seen Harry? I wanted to ask him something so I waited for him to show up but he didn't and I must've fallen asleep at some point."
No Gryffindor.
Malfoy glanced up from his work to raise an eyebrow at him. “No thanks.” After several moments of silence, he averted his gaze again.
"This is Gred..."
Draco had finally found his old self again.
That Ron wouldn't be a good friend?
Draco’s knuckles whitened as he subtly clutched the book in his hands.
Someone from inside must have let him in! He looked up and opened his mouth to share his theory when he remembered his fathers words.
. If his father really wanted to get rid of the book he wouldn't hesitate to
were they talking about?
, was stealing his first place in almost every subject they had together. After a few hours of reading he got tired and put the book away. Only a few chapters left to read but they could wait until tomorrow. His other roommates were in the bathroom getting ready for bed so he changed into his pyjamas and waited until they were back so he could have the bathroom to himself. Malfoy's didn't share.
"Scarface",
Okay.
Harry looked right into his blue eyes, hoping to have a calming effect on his best friend.
"Stupid Scarhead!"
Stupid old hat.
They didn't really feel the potion wear off. Completely lost of any sense of time they played in the snow and when they went inside again, fully drenched, the effects of the liquid happiness were all gone. Still they were grinning at each other happily - until Filch came across their way.
Well, he would be. If it wasn’t for that Granger girl.
He'd gotten paired with Padma Patil who turned out to be almost as bad as Harry at potions.
"So what? He got one year older, what a shocker!"
He looked small and desperate sitting on the floor and leaning against the wall next to his suitcase.
“Yeah, I guess that's true. What position are you going for?”
Harry sat on his bed, gaze fixed upon the book in his lap. He turned the page and found yet another picture of his parents. This time they were standing in the snow and a blonde woman was with them. All three of them seemed to be about 17 years old and they were waving into the camera happily.
When she looked up again, teary-eyed, Harry held up two thumbs at her and she gave him a smile in return.
"No buts.
, really! The room appeared to hold at least one example of every object that was ever invented and they were stacked on top of each other in a way that could only be held upright in a magical environment. The stacks transformed the room into an endless labyrinth of abandoned things.
Oh alright.
them out loud! Once he had caught himself really actually doing just that while taking a shower and almost banged his head against the nearest wall to punish himself like a house elf. Yes, that was how pathetic he felt.
“Sure.” They both got back to work.
And defeating a troll is definitely one of them!
Words written with white chalk had appeared on the blackboard and Quirrell nervously tapped his foot standing next to it supervising their work.
Hesitating for only a second, he bid the two others goodbye. “Have a nice day!”
"Seems like Snape is a real emo."
“Actually-”
"What? What are you talking about?"
Not giving a damn about doing it
"Sure."
As all students were seated at their tables Dumbledore stood and held up his hands, silencing them.
"You will fulfil your assignment with Hagrid."
She stood up and pushed Harry onto the seat instead.
After some time Hermione spoke up.
Ron looked ready to defend himself but got interrupted before he even opened his mouth.
, it would've been his fault. He had hastily shoved the feeling of guilt as for down as somewhat possible before scowling and joining in on the conversation.
. Molly was the last one to join them. In her hands she carried a small pot of glittery black powder.
"I do. I guess it's just not their type of music."
So they began to gather all their things while people around them went back to their own business, hopping on and off trains. Then they pushed their carts towards the exit, desperate to get away from all those Muggles.
"You've been raised by muggles? This is awful!"
"Yes, Narcissa."
No, this magic gave him
Draco’s heart clenched weirdly. That hurt.

Harry would love to snap back at them, but they weren’t even that far off. He didn’t really care for what kind of clothes he was wearing, as long as they were somewhat comfortable and fit for the weather. It took his parents several months to talk Sirius out of buying him a whole new wardrobe. His godfather was mostly over his lack of style by now, but Harry could swear he saw him fake retch that one time he wore a yellow and black flannel with dark blue sweatpants. What a snob.
“I'm going to bed.”
Ron gave Harry a gloating grin.
New plan.
asked Pansy in her shrill voice.
Draco pulled his wand from the strap around his shin.
"Wait, let me take care of it."
Oliver huffed a laugh. “You are a sap. And you have convinced me. But let me change into something proper first, alright?”
As soon as they were outside the library, Hermione bombarded him with questions. “What the heck was that about? Did you seriously just spend a full hour doing homework with Draco and
. Suppressing the urge to cry and scream he settled for kicking his bed post instead. He groaned in pain. This was the first and probably last time he’d ever thank his parents for forcing him to always wear shoes - even in his own bedroom.

After Norbert had attacked Fang, Hagrid had agreed to let Charlie Weasley escort the dragon to Romania. Then Hermione had started planning. Charlie and a few of his most trusted colleagues would be coming on brooms and arrive at midnight of the following Saturday, on the highest tower, the Astronomy tower. On the grounds they'd be too easy to spot, so they had decided on this location instead. Their only problem now was to walk a literal dragon through the whole school building, up to the tower - unseen!
“Well, I need ter be off. Keep i’ going, lad! Yer time'll come! Know what I mean?”
While their roommates had seemed to have gotten rather friendly with Harry before the fateful night they were pretty much ignoring them both as they left for their detention. Filch and the two Gryffindorks were awaiting them at the huge front doors. Dreading what he would hear for an answer he put on his best sneer and snarled,
He broke the candy in two, almost equal halves and stood up handing Draco one of them. The blonde took it eagerly, not even think about rejecting the offer for a second time. Harry raised his half into the air.
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
Ten minutes later Ron and Hermione found him like this.
Finally the train arrived at Kings Cross and Draco walked over to his parents, suitcase in hand, without granting his friends a goodbye. Something in his mother's expression was expectant but Draco turned his attention towards his father first.
That sounded ridiculous but Harry had always studied in the company of his two best friends. And he did not actually intend on changing that now. The reason he was on the way to the library was because he had a mission. A challenge he had set for himself, driven by curiosity and boredom.
"Hey!"
And, when he thought about it, a castle where hundreds of pupils lived, should be safe enough to keep out a stupid troll, shouldn't it?
“I don’t know, That’s all up to you. I will not accept these as a donation to the team, so, as far as I am concerned there are six high quality brooms in this closet that belong to the Malfoy family. Also, you are very lucky I let you participate in the try outs after this. I want nothing of the kind to happen ever again or you’re off the team, got it?”
A perfect family.
"Wait! Did anyone of you see Snape since Friday?"
"Okay, um, but what do I do."
"What the hell is wrong with this place?"
He already started to leave when he stepped onto something.
Draco rolled his eyes once again. Of course Potter would be the center of everyone's attention wherever he went. Even at the signing session of a wanna-be-famous author. Well, maybe Lockhart was quite popular and maybe also quite handsome but it didn't make him any less of an idiot. But with Potter in the shop everyone seemed to be even more excited and
When Harry left the bathroom, with brushed teeth and his pajamas on, all four boys looked up at him and he had the strong suspicion, that Terry, Michael and Anthony had just stopped talking about him. He lay down on his covers and drew the curtains close. As he calmed down the events of the day filled his mind and he doze off with a smile on his lips. Today he'd defeated a mountain troll with his friends.
. Exactly what he needed. An outfit like this made it so much easier to fulfil his father's expectations.
was the better term. Harry opened his mouth as if he wanted to reply but then he shook his head and lay down on his bed without changing or brushing his teeth. Draco didn’t get much sleep after that.
The youngest son just shrugged and walked towards the fireplace, grabbing a handful of the weird powder on his way. Mr Weasley put his hands onto Harry's shoulders from behind in a fatherly gesture which felt oddly right.
Giant and three-headed and teeth gnashing.
“In case you didn’t get that: I would like to dance with you, Potter.”
Professors McGonagall, Snape, Quirrell and Flitwick were also standing in the corridor, eyes moving from the three students to the unconscious troll on the bathroom floor.
Cho's face fell a tad and she looked like she was about to say something, but she got cut off before she was able to.
“I don't know. Who?”
Whatever weird thing Pansy and Blaise had been talking about at lunch, Harry had forgotten all about it a few moments later. Draco had already finished eating and had taken out a book to read. Harry decided to check the cafeteria first after he had dropped off Hermione and Ron at their classrooms. Before Ron went inside, he gave Harry a look.
After dinner he returned to his bed-cave and retrieved
Draco rolled his eyes.
His mother shouldn't need to stand up for him!
And both of them sprinted out the dorm and all the way down towards the Entrance hall. All their sorrows were completely forgotten for the moment. And so were the remaining presents.
“Do you want me to get you a drink?”
"Dobby, you will come up with a way to keep Harry away from Hogwarts. Scare him, kidnap him,
Anyway, it had been
"See? No one's coming. We would've had loads of time. We would've found something!"
Harry blushed madly as she spit on her thumb, rubbing at some sort of smudge on his cheek.
Harry nodded in agreement.

"Ron, Hermione, wanna join me visiting Hagrid?"
"I'm very disappointed Miss Granger! Ten points from Gryffindor. And about you two.
murmured to himself, deadpan.
The not so pleasant knot in his chest.
"Let's go outside and make a plan."
Harry on the other hand, held the lamp higher and walked towards the place where the sound had come from. After about 20 steps in that direction he heard low voices which caused him to dim the light of the lamp with his cloak in order not to be seen.
"Did you miss your prince?"
he shouted. Ron took onto it very fast. He grabbed the biggest splinter of wood he could find and aimed at the troll's head as he threw it.
Draco's heart clenched.
missed his birthday...
"What the bloody hell was that ?",
Draco nodded and as if
(-----------------------)
"Since when do you talk to Potter?",
“Thanks.”
“I generally wake up early on some days. It’s a habit from my Hogwarts years that somehow stuck with me. I always used to get up really early at least twice a week to have the quidditch pitch to myself for a few hours.”
“I used to dream a lot about you back then. During... you know.”
“But are you sure it’s a good idea?”
Ron, again, knew better.
As if he, Harry, of all people should be the one person to know this stuff although nobody had ever told him about any of it.
"Come on, you go first, so Harry can see how it is done."
, thank you very much, but Potter didn't show up
Graves stopped in her tracks to look at him, one eyebrow raised. “What was that again?”
Instead he opened the one from the Dursleys he was surprised. They had actually sent him a five pound note. That was like the only money he had ever received from them.
Weeks went by and still Draco didn't get rid of these stupid
“Hello, ladies and gentleman. You all are looking fabulous tonight!”
“Yeah, sure is.”
And that is how he ended up crouched behind a desk, scanning the library for his target.
At least it wasn't Hufflepuff.
Like,
And he loved it.
“Thanks, Harry. You’re looking quite handsome yourself!”
Malfoys didn't do that! He went into the bathroom and when he returned another song was playing from a weird silver box, as he could see from this angle. The three boys sitting around that thing were completely absorbed by their conversation and seemed to still haven't noticed him.
What to
Harry was confused.
The answer is simple: Empty excuses.
to be a cruel joke, right? But Draco was yet to let go of his hand. Harry sat back down and was rewarded with a small, grateful smile that made his heart skip a beat.
Harry and Hermione shared a grin.

“You can’t give me a warning for something that isn’t even my fault!”
“I’m not perfect. And my parents know that very well. Before we met each other again, while I was at university, I made a lot of bad decisions. One of them was to cut all contact with my family. One of my professors was a little weird in the head but at the time I didn’t see that. I saw a person who had accomplished things that I was striving to accomplish and made him my idol. And somehow, he convinced me that my “lower class” family would just hold me back in life.
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
The first thing he realized, was the lack of empty seats in the back row.
Yes, it was probably about time he started wearing this dress. He looked absolutely fabulous in it after all.
The first lesson of the year was Charms with the Gryffindors. As the students filed into the classroom Professor Flitwick was already waiting behind his desk, probably standing on a stack of books. Hermione attempted to pull her friends to the front but Harry and Ron struggled against her and the trio eventually settled for the third row. Harry happily took the middle seat in between the two Gryffindors and waited for the lesson to begin. The moment Flitwick cleared his throat a last student tumbled into the room. And of course it was Draco Malfoy. He didn't apologize, he just went to sit in the last free chair in the very back corner and Flitwick let it slide, simply pretending nothing had happened at all. Maybe because it was the first lesson of the year or maybe because he didn't want to take points from his own house as his first act of the year. Harry didn't know, neither did he really care about the answer. The question he was wondering about instead was, what had Malfoy been up to already? What could he have been doing? Because he was very certain he hadn't seen him at breakfast. While all of this Slytherin friends had been there.
Michael said disappointedly.
When Draco awoke on the next morning a new robe was placed upon his dresser. It wasn't a dress robe, it looked more like the robes Lucius was wearing for work. He put it on, knowing that his father would not have him wearing something else, and found that he liked it on himself. It gave him a look of
He entered the hall and sat down at the Slytherin table. Maybe some food could bring him enlightenment.
"Fast!"
What reason would he even want to look at
They spent all afternoon in Hagrid’s hut and talked about everything that had occurred so far. It showed that Hagrid already knew about their adventure of the last night which already seemed to have taken place weeks ago to Harry. Then the dog, Fang, started licking his hand and Harry suddenly remembered this morning's events.
Suddenly the door was flung open and Michael, Terry and Anthony entered, ripping Harry from his thoughts. As soon as they saw him, they were attacking him with questions. So he closed the book and placed it on his bedside table.
And he was off. Harry couldn't believe their luck. They'd been so close to being exposed.
Draco sighed in fake exasperation. “In fact, it was about you, yes. But don’t you dare get all braggy about that!”
Fred was already outside the door, waiting for his twin to finish up.
When Harry arrived at the cafeteria, he found them sitting at one of the round tables in the back. Draco was reading a book and Blaise was typing something on his phone. Harry made a mental note to thank Regulus on Sunday.
When he returned to his dorm, his relief of having found an ideal storage spot was replaced by annoyance. Well-known chords were seeping through from the other side of the door. Michael Jackson. Not again. Reluctantly he entered the dorm and scowled at the three boys gathered on Goldstein’s bed, before sitting on his own and pulling all the curtains tight around it. He picked a textbook from his bedside table and started doing his homework. And if his toes jiggled to the beat of the music – that wasn’t his fault and nobody ever needed to know about that.
what to expect.
nobody would be looking for him in a place that they didn't even know. With confident steps he strode towards it and tried to push it open. It didn't move a bit. With a second glance he examined the door further. No handle, no key hole. Only the inscription and a simple, circular door knocker.
Between the girls there were lying some notes, written in beautiful handwriting, and some ancient looking books were open on their laps, reminding him of Hermione when she was doing homework. Yet what they did didn't look like homework at all.
“True, but bribery for example
He made a fast decision and without even doing so much as changing his clothes he was off.
. And it was right. He owed Harry his life. At least they were equal now. But deep down Draco knew he would have saved him anyway. And he also knew he shouldn't feel like this. He went to bed thinking about this. Tomorrow he would get home. He'd finally see his parents again. Pushing away the nagging thought that they maybe wouldn't want him home at all he closed his eyes and fell asleep.
"Where have you been?"
“Well, who would've guessed that,” Draco
Penelope started to explain, how to enter the common room.
Draco was excited. In two weeks school was starting again and he’d just received his letter with the supply list. This meant he would have to go to Diagon Alley soon. Usually his mother was the one to take him shopping but she just so happened to be busy that day and his father was free from work and still wanted to sell stuff in
“I’m sorry, we’re a little late mum.”
"Harry, what do you reckon this dog thing is guarding?"
"Poor boy",
"Find someone else to annoy,
Now, enjoy reading!
The hell was Lockhart doing here?!
"Lucius, this is our son you're talking about. Don't you dare say something like this again."
"He's not in the castle."
When they arrived on Platform 9  3/4 Draco immediately spotted the white-blonde hair that certainly belonged to his parents. His heart gave a little jump of excitement.
Weird!
Of course he'd done research since the last time. He'd found the spell in one of the books his personal educator had given him. He had wanted to make sure Draco would be on top of every class when school started.
“Weasley, Ginny!”
"What even-?"
So he decided to join the Gryffindors and looked out for a certain redhead.
“Right. Your turn driving.”
Just because his mother said it was
“Oh, you brought him with you this time? How lovely!” Then she opened her arms for Oliver who was just coming up the front steps. “It’s been too long, my dear boy! I’m happy you could make it tonight.”
And so they went to the library.
Draco rolled his eyes unnerved.
. She's perfect! So cute! Okay, come on, Cho. Let's do this!"
As soon as he realised his mistake, he turned his head away but Harry seemingly hadn't noticed the use of his first name. He was probably too distracted by the fact that his body was gone.
! He's trying to gain his powers back! That's why Snape wants the stone! He wants to give it to him!"
that you don't have orders from my father to fulfil, you will spend on this project. He would be in great danger at Hogwarts. You wouldn't want anything bad to happen to Harry Potter,
"Let's get directly to the matter,..."
“Enjoying your fame, Potter?”
“So obviously we have to kiss. And we do until your annoying godfather interrupts us and reminds you of your mission. There are no dementors in this Azkaban by the way. Apparently, the prisoners just stay there because they were told to.”
neither towards mudbloods nor towards possible ex-deatheaters.
They were standing in front of a small, cramped and dark room full of potion ingredients, potions and ancient looking books. In the middle there was a pitch black wooden desk and an equally black cabinet stood next to a black dresser.
“What's up?”, he tried again.
This was totally awesome.
"That's none of your business, servant!"
Harry answered immediately.
"Please tell us what really happened, these crazy rumours will be the end of me!"
"Hi!",
"You're done, Mr Malfoy! Shall I send the bill together with the robes to your father as soon as they are finished?"
Pansy on the other hand threw him a blinding smile that was just as sweet and indigestible as Hagrid’s homemade fudges. ”See you tomorrow, darling!”
! Neither did they
"A- Are you alright?"
Harry didn't argue Ron even though he secretly was pretty much looking forward to being back at Hogwarts himself. He couldn't await trying out for the Quidditch team, nor could he await to finally use his wand again. He also missed his Ravenclaw friends, especially his roommates (Draco excluded. Maybe not after today? Ugh, this boy was confusing!) and Cho Chang.
Charlie walked past all of the cages, checking if everything was as it should be. At the end of the hallway he stopped for a little longer. With concerned eyes he looked upon their newest arrival. An underfed german shepherd puppy. Now it was sleeping but it hadn’t been easy to get there.
“Oh, nice. That’s cool.” Harry was kind of freaking out. He hoped it didn’t show too much.
On his way to the vending machine Harry thought about whether that conversation had been progress or a set-back. He eventually settled for progress. For no particular reason apart from the fact that he wanted to have made progress.
an update on how things were going.
“Where have you been? Didn’t you hear the bell ring?”
"Of course, master Draco, Sir. Dobby didn't have the right. Please forgive Dobby for being so impolite."
He looked up and immediately saw, why he had stopped in his tracks.
He wanted to talk to someone.
He was a Malfoy. Who was Dumbledore to tell him where to go and where not.
Draco started packing away his books and papers.
"Probably, yes!"
"I've realised your flying is pretty good. Do you like Quidditch?"
He was glad when the hat fell over his eyes and blocked his view.
“Hey, it’s not my fault if I always wake up before anything else can happen!”
Harry felt like the luckiest boy alive. He was still here. After all that had happened, not only the day before but throughout the course of his life, he was standing here, a young, learning wizard in a magical castle, surrounded by (mostly) friends.
Harry and Cho were on the same team and the first keeper they had to go against was Anthony Goldstein. Harry felt almost sorry for him. He let in a lot of goals. Harry himself scored twice but to make it up he purposefully screwed up once or twice afterwards. He didn't want sports to ruin his friendly relationship with his roommates. Cho, on the contrary, kept scoring and scoring and each of her passes was harsh and backed up by a lot of power. She seemed to be driven by pent up anger from the Seekers’ game.
With that, she directed an advanced levitation spell at the huge chest and started walking off the pitch. Scowling, Draco cast
What he hadn't considered in that moment was that they still had the subject in a joined class.
Considering how often
The pureblood's voice was low and trembling as he described what he'd seen.
He raised his glass to each of them, ending with Draco. He almost choked when he looked up at him. He hadn’t counted on him being so damn tall in those heels. And he had been even less prepared for sparkling eyeshadow and rich purple lipstick. Draco smirked. That guy knew exactly what he was doing to Harry!
The next two lessons were dragging on and on.
The feast-table-rule meant he couldn't sit with the Weasleys this time.
"I don't think so. I'd say he's knocked out."
The two of them went on like that until they split up at the wing doors of the cafeteria. As usual, Ron would save them a table and Hermione and Harry would wait in line to get food.
“Hey, guys.”
Someone was saying his name but he didn't care because it wasn't Cho. Then someone appeared right in front of him.
) and how he then got the stone out of the mirror of Erised and Quirrell attacked him and he fainted before Dumbledore got him out of there.
No Hufflepuff.
He took the sandwiches and put on his robes before jumping towards the door.
“Yeah.”
Harry shoved his black-rimmed glasses up his nose with his middle finger.
Even though he still was a bit angry at
But it was to late. Marietta had already cast the spell and everything inside Harry started to feel all fuzzy. He wanted to glare at her but realised he couldn't take his eyes off Cho. She was just so...
"Yeah, I remember you chasing after birds on your first broom for weeks until we bought you a snitch you could practice with."
, after all he didn't seem to be a person who was enjoying their life. She hadn't found anything, yet. Neither had the two boys been successful.
Well, Harry didn't get a chance to find out if they were because suddenly the huge doors of the hall flew open and Professor Quirrell stormed in.
A cold and sturdy hand grabbed his own, keeping him in place. Harry looked down at it. The brown of his skin seemed particularly dark with the contrast of Draco’s pale one right on top of it. When Harry inhaled it was all shaky and fragile and that was when he realized that he should’ve listened to Hermione. Because he definitely had a crush. On Draco fucking Malfoy- Jesus Christ, he needed to get out of there.
This boy sleeping on the bed next to his own had saved his life. He'd mostly treated him with respect and sometimes even care while he'd been insulting him for months.
"Let's head for breakfast."
His glare landed on Hermione next.
A stupid git who turned down his friendship offer!
"Pleasure to meet you again!"
at least three times. He could only hope today was bound to be better. When he arrived in front of the classroom door, she was already waiting.
Somehow Draco's thoughts had drifted off. He hated the subject. Back when he was little his mother had shown him the star sign that he was named after.
“Wow, Harry! I didn't know you were this fast!”
"Parvati said she's crying there. Harry, she didn't leave the bathroom since Charms! She doesn't know about the troll!"
And they both enjoyed the delicious chocolate melting in their mouth and the bizzling taste of the potion. Draco hummed from joy and shortly after the sweets had gone down their throats they were grinning at each other stupidly.
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
"Yeah, sure. That would be great actually. I'm sick of being laughed at by Snape and Malfoy. But only if you really don't mind, of course. You don't have to do it."
Hermione let out a long sigh. Then she set her backpack down and started putting away all her books, so she’d have her hands free. How she always managed to fit them all in there was a mystery to Harry.
"The first one to touch the snow is the winner!"
"What the hell were you thinking? Or did you even think at all? You're a bloody Ravenclaw, you're supposed to be intelligent enough to not enter a corridor, which, I quote, 'we should not enter if we don't want to die a very painful death'!"
"Come on. Get up. We'll floo to Diagon Alley."
After the other students had complied Flitwick turned towards Ron.
Ron gave him a glance as if he had just seen a giant spider with too many eyes. And maybe that expression was justified because at that same moment Hermione's judging glare found his eyes and her silent scolding was almost as effective as Professor McGonagall's, leaving Harry mumbling a sheepish apology.
"We did it, Cho, we did it."
She was sitting on the floor, books surrounding her, one of them lying open in her lap. Without looking up at the boys she started reading the interesting passage out loud.
"Thanks!"
His voice was cold. Like absolute zero cold. Colder than anything Harry had ever gotten thrown at his head from him during all their years of intense rivalry.
"Your hair. I guess you wouldn't want anyone else to see you like this."
Not one, not two but three friends and two of them were his age.
wouldn't let him be shy about it for more than a second.
"Looks like a robe to me. Try it on."
Harry stopped walking and stared at Malfoy, who was heading for the Slytherin table, in shock.
(See the end of the chapter for
The thought of telling the Dursleys how he was sick and couldn't do much today...
He shook it off and walked over.
"Are you crazy? What if he still realises that someone's been in there? And why should he leave an evidence for his attempts to get to the stone lying around in his office without any protections? It's not worth the risk! We should rather get more information on that hooded figure. We have to find out why anyone would be killing unicorns like this!"
"What time?"
His parents wouldn't spend Christmas with him. He would be here. Alone.
As soon as he sat up he realised it wasn't.
This word sounded beautiful!
Smiling at the fact that Malfoy was still talking to him he grabbed his glasses and put them on.
A lump was sitting high in his throat at the prospect of maybe never being able to return to the wizarding world ever again. The only place he'd ever felt welcomed and at home. He was terrified and sat still like a statue while his least favorite professor was scolding them.
“Well-”
“Yeah?”
From that point on he put everything he had into speeding up. The broom was no longer a means to his ends. It became a part of him. His mind could reign over it as if it was physically connected to his muscles. He surpassed a boy who was probably in fourth or fifth year, then he surpassed Cho. He finished lap number six close behind a brunette girl. It took him one more whole round to get past her as well but she caught up to him again. He pulled the broom closer to his chest, lying completely flat on top of it. She mirrored him. For a moment it looked like she would fall behind again but no such luck. The two of them slowly came closer to another player. Harry spared him a small glance before looking ahead again. It was Malfoy.
Blaise on the other hand started greeting Harry with a polite smile and a nod every time they crossed paths.
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
Hermione opened her mouth to reply but Harry beat her to it, not willing to give
“Hey, Harry can you pass me the water please?”
"Lucius!"
The following weeks were pretty awkward. Harry tried to talk to Malfoy again but the blonde just got even meaner and more brazen than before.
"Hermione!"
With a learned gesture he snatched away the bowl of cheese right under Dean's nose. The others had just returned and were now enjoying their dinner. After two weeks of an empty castle, Harry felt almost claustrophobic at the Gryffindor table, now that everyone was back.
He still had the pictures of a crying, pale boy, crouched against the wall and shaking like hell, burned into the back of his eyes.
). The more he was satisfied when Langdorn turned her gaze to the ground and hid her face behind a curtain of long, brown hair as she saw him through the glass of the door. The satisfaction of being respected -or even feared- almost overpowered the other feeling.
AND they had no houses, which would be a great plus.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry opened his mouth to complain – he hadn't known his father in person but everyone apart from Snape was talking of him in high tones and no one was going to insult him in front of his son – but in that moment the headmaster entered the room, accompanied by Professors Flitwick and McGonagall. Harry's mouth fell shut and both students stared at their feet, ashamed. Harry was not ready to wake up from this dream, yet, but it seemed like he'd have to.
As if it wasn't enough to distract him from the lesson, it had to be Draco calling him stupid names. Last time he'd checked they had been on good terms! Well at least he hadn't been insulting him anymore since Saturday. But having shared a dorm with the other boy for over two months (had it really been that long already) Harry guessed it was because of Crabbe, Goyle, Zabini and Parkinson. In evidence of Draco spending so much time with his friends, they had to be important to him. And Slytherins were mostly very prejudiced towards almost everything, including the other three houses. Maybe Malfoy wanted to prove that he's still Slytherin enough to be with them or maybe even lead them, despite him being a Ravenclaw.
Cho and her friends turned up and Harry told them the question.
”Yeah, sure.”
Where have you left your manners?"
No answer.
They exchanged looks and Ron gave him a short nod, agreeing wordlessly to Harry's plan. When the troll had disappeared through the door, they moved towards it as silent and fast as possible.
"I've got presents?"
What expected him behind the door made his jaw drop.
Draco stared at the light brown wood of the door way longer than he should've before carefully lifting the door knocker and letting it do it's job. If felt weird being back here after those months. But
“What, why?”
Still Draco couldn't move a bit. His mind was blank and he was filled with fear.
“Great. Everyone, grab a broom and get started. Ten laps, set off on my whistle, when you're done come back here and wait for the rest. Got that?”
. He sat through breakfast, eating not that much, and hurriedly finished the dishes so he could leave to his room for a moment before the Dursleys put a bunch of chores under his responsibility.
immediately sensed his change of mood.
Acting surprised by the question he made up an excuse.
(See the end of the chapter for
Her gaze snapped up to him and he spotted something like fear in her pale blue eyes, but it seemed to ease away a bit at the sight of him.
"Dragonheart!"
Then she basically shoved the pot right under his nose.
He'd been really looking forward to this!
Okay, there it was. Goodbye, wonderful dream.
"I think I heard almost everything."
The bushy haired girl said, sounding unconvinced.
gladly kept silent until it had worked and Draco was able to talk properly again. He thought about what to say and pointedly avoided anything that included Harry's name or that was as direct as: “there will be deaths this year.” Instead he opted for a sentence that he thought summed up the present situation pretty well:
The following week Draco kept to an ideal plan: no rule breaking, insulting Harry and his friends as often as possible, not talking to anyone except his Slytherin friends.
Harry heard the words only faintly, still too absorbed by Cho's beauty.
"For what do we need a plan?"
Draco's heart lurched. Harry's family was even worse than he'd thought. Would he be fine? He shook his head to come back to senses. Better than if he returned to Hogwarts. Much safer at least.
Eager to learn and everything. There was only one seat left, in the second line.
Draco woke up wishing he could escape back into his dreams. He and Harry had
"What about werewo-"
Thank god. He was so relieved to see his godfather that he hugged him. He knew, Malfoy's shouldn't show their feelings like that but he couldn't help it. This time it was all just too much. The sorting, his fathers anger, Potter and on top of everything this monster or whatever this thing had been.
Harry nodded.
Seeing the darkness in the common room it still must be  nighttime or sometime before dawn. Even though his thoughts were still pretty occupied with what had just happened, he paid attention on his way to the seventh floor. He couldn't be caught out after curfew twice in the same night. He took the silver-grey ring in his left hand and let it fall against the light brown wood of the door. At the collision it opened soundlessly. On the couch table a mug of steaming hot chocolate was awaiting him. He sat down and drank it in silence. Then he placed it back to where it had stood and it vanished.
"Yeah."
his lesson,
"We were... discussing... the last Quidditch match!"
Harry sighed.
"what time?"
Harry did not know how to reply to that.
He ran up to Hermione, dragged her onto her feet and outside the bathroom, where Ron was already standing, a frightened look on his face. They turned around just in time to see the giant creature crashing onto the ground, face first.
"Your turn, boy."
Harry was more than relieved when the first week of school was finally over with. He hadn't really done any schoolwork at all over the summer and now he had a bit of struggle to get back into the rhythm of it. But it was alright, both Hermione and Terry had already offered to help him catch up. But for priorities’ sake Harry's number one thought of the week hadn't been homework. It was the Quidditch tryouts on Saturday. All positions were open so everyone was free to choose which to try out for. Harry was pretty sure he either wanted to go for seeker or for chaser. He didn't really care actually but it would be cool to follow on his fathers legacy as one of the best chasers at Hogwarts ever. Seeker was his backup. He knew he'd have to go against Malfoy who had years of experience on him, but he was total crap at keeper and at the Weasley's the twins had always been the beaters in their little matches so he hadn't really had a chance to see if he would be good at that.
“Fantasy is da best, ain’t it?”
Harry simply nodded, still a bit lost in thoughts - even when they walked to Charms together.
“Nothing. You’re just really getting into that Malfoy thing, aren’t you?”
"But who would want something like this?"
What was a lot harder to deal with were these stupid
Panting, he cried something about a troll in the dungeons before fainting.
"How long have you been standing there?"
"Dumbledore is a joke of a headmaster!"
Ignoring the concerned voice in the back of his mind he went back to cutting his dried rat tails.
“Not many left ov us, are there?, innit.”
“Don’t give me that tone, Malfoy. I’ll always call someone to help me after trainings. You were just lucky enough to be the first one.”
Once, he took fifteen points from Ravenclaw because he'd dropped his quill by accident.
“You’re an idiot”
Oh. He contemplated the thought to just ignore her question and tell her, it was none of her business - it wasn't, after all - but she was right. He was tired. Too tired to stand up against her.
PS: comments make my day!
She mustered him
When the bell rang he would be the first one to leave the classroom and the last one to return to the Ravenclaw tower right before curfew.
"Hey, Hagrid. Do you know something about the three headed creature in the corridor on the 3rd floor?"
Warm pride filled Harry’s chest as he saw the corners of Draco’s mouth twitch upwards for a moment. He gave him a joyful smile in return.
So did a lot of other pupils.
"Hello father, hello mother."
“Oh, it's you. The door is locked.”
So instead of reading, he settled for tearing into every corner of his brain in hopes of finding an answer to this impossible riddle. A basilisk seemed like the perfect answer, but how to Salazar would it be able to travel unseen? He spent hours writing down options and crossing them off again. When he was finally pulled out of his bubble by the squeaking noise their door always made, it was already past midnight and the other boys had gone to sleep long ago. Draco peeked out from behind his curtain to find Harry leaning against the wall next to the door.
hand, not the other way around. Draco had shortly thought about ignoring the rules and just sit with his friends at the Slytherin table but then he didn't want to get himself into trouble anytime soon.
He had his head placed on Harry’s shoulder and therefore couldn’t see his face, but he could swear Harry was raising his eyebrow again. “Oh, really? About me?”
. Why did excited people always have to be so
Harry closed his locker and turned his head. “Regulus, hi!”
And with that he got sucked into the floo-network.
(Harry was sure she would get highest marks without even looking through her notes once but in this state it was impossible to discuss with her.)
"Five points from Ravenclaw for being nosy, Potter, and another five for not concentrating on your assignment. Keep your eyes on your cauldron and whatever this is meant to be inside of it."
“George, get a move on, we’ll be late again!”
When they came around a corner, Harry ran right into Ron.
But when he thought about it, it was just perfect;
A question that stuck with Harry ever since that Snape incident though was this: Why did Draco spend his entire afternoons at school as well? He knew Draco lived in a Manor (High School rumour mill, you know the drill – HAH, that rhymed), so if he wanted to study or read, why do it in a filthy High School full of people who might interrupt him for no good reason at all even though he had some sort of feud going on with him?
Draco went back to his homework.
"I wouldn't mind. Slytherin won.
Curious, Draco spun aroun and looked after his godfather. Yes, he definitely was injured on the left leg. Shortly the thought flicked through his mind, to just ask the Professor about it after class but he shook it off in no time.
“What is the problem over here?”
he stilll couldn't get his mind off of what had just happened. This, in fact, distracted him so much, it took him way too long to realise that Hermione Granger was standing right in front of him, greeting him cheerfully. As soon as he caught on, though, he immediately flashed her a smile.
Up until his birthday it all went like this and he didn't once get a letter from Ron, Hermione or anyone for that matter. Not even from Terry who had promised to send Harry some notes to help him finish the potions essay they had to write over the holidays. But probably he just wasn't finished with it himself and Harry wasn't able to write it anyways with all his school stuff stuck in that cupboard. And Ron and Hermione... maybe they just didn't remember his birthday. Remembering dates had never been Ron's thing.
He couldn't see what Ron was doing from this angle but after a few seconds he heard him shouting:
Harry was trying to process the fact that the boy he had just realized he had a crush on was holding his hand while he was doing his homework. Wouldn’t it be way harder to write that way? Did this mean something. All Harry knew was that Draco made him
Padma Patil, his potions partner, was sitting huddled in a corner with Parvati, her twin from Gryffindor, and Lavender Brown, Parvati's best friend. As always they were gossiping and giggling about something. To their right there were Anthony, Terry and Michael, working on their assignments but throwing annoyed glances towards the girls group every now and then. Next to them there was a lost looking Gryffindor boy, Harry recognised him as the boy who had lost his toad on the train, Neville Longbottom. According to Ron, he lived with his Grandmother and wasn't a very skilled wizard even though he was a pureblood. There had also been a story about Neville being pushed out of a window by his own grandpa but Harry couldn't quite remember. About two meters further the other two Gryffindor boys were working on their assignment together but were also occasionally making small balls of parchment fly into Professor Sinistra's long curly hair (with a bit of wand work of course) where it looked like snow flakes in that deep black mane. To Harry's left the remaining Ravenclaw girls were working on their sheets pretty eagerly. They were Lisa Turpin, Su Li and Mandy Brocklehurst.
The day after, when Draco told his father he hadn't been able to retrieve the books Lucius seemed about to explode but Narcissa gave him a glare and in the end he wrote a letter to
“I know, right? So, you free Sirius and want to go, but I beg you to take me with you. And I end up convincing you to run away with me. As soon as we leave Azkaban Sirius somehow disappears and we are alone. We arrive in some sort of city and walk across a marketplace. I try to get you to hold my hand. And yeah, that’s it.”
Alone.
he went back to visiting
. Anyway, I don't care how he treated you. I want to know if you did it!"
His face lit up in a smile an he jumped to his feet exitedly. Harry put on his robes in a rush and made his way down to the great hall.
“No, Colin, please don't. But you can watch of course. Just, don't distract anyone, okay?”
"Harry, Hermione is in the girls bathroom!"
"And the boy from Madam Malkins. Didn't you call him 'cute'?"
upon Harry's glasses and soon they were off to Gringotts, right after Hermione had introduced them to her parents. When the Weasleys entered their vault, Harry was shocked. He’d known that they weren't particulary wealthy but he didn't epect that they only had a few galleons in total - which they all took to spend on school supplies this day, leaving the vault completely empty. Shame came over him when he stood in front of his own money, trying to hide the view of piles and piles of galleons and sickles and knuts from his friends. Somehow he wished he didn't own any of it and could just leave it to the Weasleys. But he knew they wouldn't take it. Hastily he stuffed a few coins of every sort into a small purse and then shuffled back out of the door. Relief flooded Harry when they finally were out in the Alley again but he still felt the shame prickling in his stomach.
He kicked again. And again.
Anthony looked half furious, half relieved when Harry entered the dorm. Draco had been a little bit worried, too, although he would never admit that. Harry ignored the question.
One more chapter and this fic is in sync with Wattpad!
long!
“You’re finally going to leave us alone?”
Malfoy said it with a blank expression. Harry rolled his eyes.
The captain cleared her throat aggressively.
On Monday afternoon Harry went to the library again. This time he found Malfoy already there. With Pansy. Harry’s heart sank. He was pretty sure the two of them had something going on. They weren’t officially dating but there were certain rumours going around. And he didn’t want to interrupt anything.
"Well,
he'd been told.
“I didn't knew you were trying out for the team!”
“Harry, not everyone has to like you,” Hermione said for the millionth time as she shut her locker door. The number of books she tried to keep steady in her arms would be unsettling to anyone who didn’t know her. They were heading to lunch and she had more books with her than she did in any lesson earlier that day. Harry was used to it by now.
I hope you all are well and safe during all this pandemic stuff. I’ll try to have the next chapter up ASAP but no promises <3 Love, as always, goes especially to everyone who comments!!!
It was weird. A week earlier harry might have laughed at this. Or he would have been glad to be acknowledged at all. But this time it just… hurt. He sat there for a moment, not saying a word. Then he stood up to leave.
Draco nodded but didn't speak, yet, in favor of sorting his thoughts first. He let the events of the summer flash up in front of his eyes and one by one started retelling them. Every now and then he would take a look at the time in order to not be late for class on the first day.
“Why not?” Harry replied without skipping a beat. It was too late to back out now. And this time it seemed he had at least some of his wits together. “Why do you always have to insult me?”
"Nothing, Sir. Master Draco had not been influenced by any curses, hexes or potions."
. Her brown eyes and this shiny, black hair. So straight and sleek. Harry felt himself make a move to touch it. It felt as wonderful as it looked!
returned Goldstein.
"Merlin, Harry! Why can't you just stay out of trouble?!"
Flitwick didn't elaborate so Harry came forward again.
"What do you think you are doing?! Do you know how long it takes to clean the floor off your muddy footprints. In my office! Both of you!"
"So witty, my little Dragon! You really belong in Ravenclaw."
For a second the boy got anxious, fearing that maybe his father had found out about his rule breaking at hogwarts, but his mother's smile reassuerd him that it was nothing of that sort. As soon as their child set among them, Lucius started talking.
Because of that he visited

Screams were audible and some were getting to their feet, heading for the door.
“What's got you so scared anyway? Are you afraid of closed doors? Pathetic.”
He wore robes like everybody else. The yellow and black striped tie told them he was a Hufflepuff and he had a badge on his chest which said 'Headboy'.
“I’m sorry, Draco. I’ll see you tomorrow. Or Thursday at the latest. I hope.”
Needed quiet.
When he finally entered the first years' dormitory, he was surprised to see the others sitting around a radio set instead of reading or talking. Not so surprising was the fact that Malfoy was not around. He recognised the song. He'd heared it playing at some public places in the muggle world. Not that this was the kind of music Petunia or Vernon would listen to in their free time, mind you. Trying to start a decent conversation for once he immediately picked up on the topic.
“I know. You say so every time I mention him. He’s family and all that stuff. Which isn’t even accurate. He’s the younger sibling of your godfather. He’s technically more closely related to Malfoy than he is to you.”
Harry’d had no idea that silence could be this painful. Even with Pansy- Oh
"Watch your way, Potter!"
"Cheers!"

“No, there’s something else. I saw your broom earlier. A
After he had downed the drink he moved into the least crowded corner of the ballroom and leaned against the wall. He would have slouched but that was hardly possible in his stiff uniform. That damn uniform! It wasn’t even practical! It looked impressive and every now in then the special protection was strong enough to hold off a curse he didn’t deflect in time but apart from that it was just stiff and itchy and way too tight around the neck. He couldn’t wait to quit this job as soon as another opportunity would open itself up.
Leaving every thought of Snape and Voldemort behind, Harry followed.
Then, as if she just remembered his question she added,
Finally his mind slipped back to reality and his sight became clear again. Before daring to talk, he took a deep, shuddering breath and closed his eyes for a second. Then he spoke up.
During the following 10 minutes he scowled at everyone sorted into Slytherin – seriously, if people like

only got six presents for Christmas?! And only two of them were bigger than a book! Suddenly he felt very sorry. He'd never doubted that the famous Harry Potter was loved by everyone and would surely receive a lot of presents. He himself had about twenty five. It was not fair!
"Yes, Master Draco, Sir."
About Snape.
“So?”
“It’s already quarter to six? Are you kidding me? We’re going to be late, Harry!”
A single, magical chocolate candy with a cheer-up-potion core. An expensive sweet, customarily used to satisfy crying, bored or lonely children at pureblood-dinner-parties. Draco's mouth watered at the sight of the delicate chocolate. Therefore it took him a bit to realize that Harry was smiling at him knowingly.
say his name!"
"Is he... dead?"
Draco glared down at her, waiting for her smile to falter and for her to run off, crying or something. But she didn't. Instead she
He shut his mouth close again. He had to keep his thought to himself for the moment. Maybe he could tell Pansy and Blaise about it but he was sure Goldstein and Corner, being Half Bloods, would not be considered worthy by his father.
"What?! But how-?!"
when the alcohol of some kind of potion entered the small wounds. Overwhelmed from all the pain and dizzyness the world went black - this time for real. Harry was pretty sure he threw up again before he slipped into unconsciousness.
Excited, Harry took one of the presents, a small one from the top, and ripped off the ugly, brown wrapping material. A note was sticking to the self made bonbons. It said:
with a plea to send the books straight to the Manor along with a bill, just like they always had it with robes. Everything that had happened on their shopping trip just felt unreal. Like a weird dream. But Draco couldn't get it off his mind. All the things that had happened. And Potter. So cunfusing, that bloody git. Stupid, too. Draco sighed. He really ought to come up with some better insults if he wanted to keep that feud going. It was exhausting, really. Some days he cursed himself for sending Dobby on that 'mission'.
At one point they had to go down to find the train, of course, but that was not a big deal. When Ron wanted to drive on top of the railway, Harry interfered.
"Hello, you! I'm Luna!", she said dreamily.
"Hey, Ron. I think we have Charms and Astronomy together!"
He had already threatened to do so after all!
Ron looked surprised. That wasn't a sentence you heard on a regular basis out of that mouth.
He didn't answer immediately.
He shoved them towards the door.
"Open it!"
:  :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :    :  :
Both bluntly ignored the question.
The brunette looked up at him curiously, picking the silky material up again.
"Dobby can't help you answering this question, Sir. Dobby has to get back to the kitchen to prepare dinner, Sir."
At first Harry couldn't tell if it had worked but soon he heard a
and somehow
Ron looked at him, dumbfounded.
He would've told Flitwick about it but then again he'd been out past curfew himself
The troll's bat was lying on the floor between a lot of smaller pieces of wood and it's owner looked like he was about to fall over.
Soon he was tucked in soft sheets and he didn't know when exactly but he drifted off into dream filled slumber. Dreams of sleek black hair and soft skin touching his hand.
And you'll make it up to him somehow,
No footsteps.
“Don’t worry, I’ll be fine.”
"To my right there are the girls' dormitories, the boy's are to my left. Just climb the stairs until you find the door with the number 1 on it. You will find your luggage placed next to your bed. Make yourself a home. Good night everyone."
Upon their arrival, they split up. Ron and Colin were heading for the stands, the former who said goodbye to him with a death-glare, whilst Harry joined the crowd of players in the middle of the pitch.
And again he hadn't got a destination. This time he just ran for his life. His feet carried him all the way down to the dungeons. He ran and ran until he heard a familiar voice.
"Harry?",
After Ron had made fun of her, she'd seemed to be crying as she'd walked off.
Draco stood in front of the door to the Ravenclaw tower, not quite listening to the Door knocker’s riddle. Then he made a hasty spin on his heel and left Ravenclaw tower behind, with hurried steps that his father would definitely scold him for.  Determinedly, he searched for the fastest way back to the broom cupboard with the
Not to spoil or anything but they ACTUALLY make some kind of conversation in this one.
Draco sighed. He really didn’t want to do this tonight. He’d rather just fly under the radar again. The dress could wait for another occasion.
Five minutes ago Draco would've thought that this day couldn't get any worse. Well, of course fate had to prove him wrong again. Now he was stuck up with Harry Bloody Potter, who had rejected his friendship-offer just an hour ago, for seven whole years. He was silent all the remaining time of the sorting (the stupid Weasley boy was Griffindor and Pansy and Blaise had been sorted into Slytherin, of course) and throughout the whole dinner.
When he lifted his sheets to stand up he spotted something at the end of his bed.
"Well."
Draco shot a look towards the window and saw thick snowflakes dancing over the pale sky. Grinning even wider he turned back to Harry.
One would think having a ghost-teacher is fun. Professor Binns looked like he'd never heard of the word 'fun' at all (let alone laughed).
Before his brain could catch up to what he was actually doing he was standing next to the only other occupied bed in this dorm, two of his own small parcels in his hand and placing them next to Harry's. The small boy stirred in his sleep and Draco got back onto his own bed as fast as somehow possible. When he glanced back and found Harry still sleeping he let out the breath he'd been holding and turned his attention back on his own gifts.
His eyes widened and he looked over his shoulder to make sure no one was coming.
His friends could sometimes be quite pesky, especially Crabbe and Goyle, who don't even know what you're talking about after you explained it twice.
“Oh, there you are, Harry,” someone called from behind.
"What if he got bitten by Fluffy as he tried to get past him when everybody was distracted by the troll?"
Then he had about one hour to get ready for family dinner. Narcissa and Draco stood at the fireplace waiting only for Lucius to show up. When 30 minutes went by and he hadn't shown up they went on their own.
Slowly Draco blinked his eyes open.
“So, you’re just casually wasting two hours of your day because your scared of walking home on your own?”
He was there. Just the thought of it felt unreal. But this wasn’t a dream. This was real life. And Harry Potter was lying in Draco Malfoy’s bed.
He had spent breakfast with his friends from Slytherin. His best friend Pansy who he'd grown up with, agreed with his opinion on the sorting.
Once again he remembered the day when the screaming letter had arrived.
A few insults are being thrown around in this chapter but actually I think it’s just cute.
When the first sun rays lit up the room Draco stood up and went to the bathroom in order to get a cold shower so he could survive this day of classes. Then he brushed his teeth and made his hair before sneaking down to the common room, leaving three snoring figures behind in their respective beds. As he entered the room he saw some black hair sticking out over the back of the deep blue couch by the fireplace. Draco's heart jumped. Maybe it was Harry who came back late and immediately fell asleep on the first soft surface he saw because he was so tired. But a second glance proved him wrong. The hair was long and straight and not at all wild, curly and exciting like H-
"My brother is in seventh year now"
speak up.
Draco ignored the in fact very scary memory involving a locked door from about exactly a year ago that came up at that.
“Oi, Harry! What’s up mate?”
“Shit, I gotta go, or Lockhart will assign me something ridiculous again.”
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
"We're one house. We're a family! Let's go. We'll make these gits shut up."
“I-,” Harry started but he wasn’t sure how to complete that sentence. So, he gave it another try: “Since there’s no one else here, I was wondering if I could keep you two some company?”
Yeah, thanks a lot.
:   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :
Harry also gave her a quick hug, before the three of them moved to the living room to complete the group. Molly accepted a glass of wine from her husband. Then she sat down in her armchair.
She shooed him into the living room and went back into the kitchen to check on the pizzas.
"Such ridiculous names..."
The group of people she had just pointed at left the pitch, their heads hanging.
Just cool and serious magic to learn.
"I always get that fuzzy feeling, my face gets very hot and there's something in my stomach. I'm pretty sure it was Potter. It mostly happens around him."
He knew he shouldn't but it was undeniable. He missed
After the hat's song and all Draco had bragged about, Harry had been so sure that Malfoy was the most slytherin boy in this school. What on earth would make the sorting hat put this guy into Ravenclaw?
“What? That can’t be all of it!”
Hermione out of enthusiasm about what she just found out and Ron out of panic.
"What are deatheaters? Or purebloods?"
"Ronald, you should've told us that he hasn't used the floo system before."
Harry and Hermione's faces relaxed as they shared a glance.
"Draco, Darling! Wake up my little Dragon!"
The rights belong to JKR.
Smiling like a madman and also kind of nervous he crossed the entrance hall and walked through the huge doorway.
Draco was confused. What did she -
The teacher gave him a nod. There was a weird silence in which Harry – for whatever reason - felt as if caught in the act. Maybe it was the stern look that Regulus was giving him. Wait, did he think Harry was skipping school? Shit, he should probably explain himself. Regulus would never report him, but he wasn’t above casually mentioning these things during family dinners and Harry did not want to repeat that. Ever.
He left the compartment and made his way down the corridor. At some point he pushed a Hufflepuff out of his way who immediately ran off, almost crying, and he sneered at a few other people who either ignored him or rolled their eyes (
Harry’s face immediately lit up. “Oh, Draco and I love that movie!”
"You should get on with revision as well! Or in the end you might be the ones to fail!"
“Oh, it’s you.” Harry’s voice was thick with sleep, but Draco was sure he heard relief in it. A sleepy grin spread across Harry’s face. “G’Morning, gorgeous.”
“I'm sorry but just as it is with every other charm, we will have to wait until it has worn off.”
All of a sudden the light in her eyes returned.
"You're probably the only one who is."
"How could you..."
He said in a loud and clear voice and the last thing he saw before being sucked into the floo system was a glimpse of a black haired, small boy with a scar on his forehead who seemingly dreaded his return home so much that he looked like he was going to throw up. Draco's heart clenched at that and for a short period of time he felt like he couldn't breathe but actually these were probably symptoms of travelling with floo powder,
This time the silence lasted longer. Harry heard a sob ripping through the loaded air and his eyes wandered from the floating letter to Malfoy.
Draco was sitting in their usual corner, focusing intently on his homework. Harry took a deep breath. And then another one. And another one. And- Nope, this was enough. He was not a fucking coward. He could do this. With confident strides he walked over and sat down in the chair across from Draco, folding his hands together on top of the table.
A part of this chapter is basically the Halloween chapter from
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Are you talking for me now?”
The silence that followed was heavy and persistent. It was a relief to hear the bell ring, announcing the end of classes for the day. At the same time Harry was reluctant to leave. He didn’t want to lose all that progress that he’d made. It wasn’t like he had much of a choice though.
When all their plates were empty, Harry grabbed his bag and went to his first class:
“Come on, Malfoy! Give me a hand over here.”
“Why are you saying it like that? Do you want him to keep insulting everyone?”
"WHAT ARE YOU DOING THERE, BOY!?"
Yes, Draco found dark magic fascinating and he admired his father a lot but risking innocent lives was another thing completely. Also, Draco didn't have much to do anyways and he had a private library - a really big one - at hand, so, why not?
The green, bespectacled eyes of his gave a look of confusion. What the hell was Ron being on about?
Malfoy looked up in surprise. He didn't answer immediately. When he nodded eventually it filled Harry with joy. Okay, he already achieved something. Now he had to keep talking before the other one closed up again.
Draco blinked twice to stop the burning in his eyes before turning to the woman.
"He definitely knows something."
They stood up and when they reached the doors of the great hall somebody called for Harry. He turned around to find Hermione and Ron catching up with them.
"What do you mean
He did a final round of checks before he walked out and locked up the dog shelter. Out front Luna and Ginny were already sitting in their car, ready to take off. Automatically he slid into the back seat and ruffled his sister’s hair from behind.

The potions professor returned his embrace and placed a caressing hand on his head. And Draco just blurted out everything while Severus listened patiently.

And he tagged along.
And they went outside and settled down next to a huge tree by the lake and they planned.

“C'mere.”
“Hey.”
They had Transfiguration with the Slytherins and although McGonagall was pretty strict and kept her classroom silent most of the time, Harry could hear Draco and his friends whispering insults towards him and sniggering every time he failed to transfigure his match into a needle.
"YEAH BUT SO IS HIS BIRTHDAY!"
Draco watched Harry and his friends wander across the grounds towards Hagrid’s hut. He was waiting for the captain to be done as she had asked him to stay behind earlier. He tried to stay calm, but he was really nervous. What did she want? Would she revoke his seeker position? Was it because of his family? Ugh, that bossy halfblood should be grateful to have him on the team! And he’d earned his victory fair and square! She couldn’t do that! His father would make sure she’d regret it!
"Were have you
"Oh my god, what did they do to you. You look like they gave you amortentia! Merlin, hopefully they haven't. Come on, lie down a bit. Maybe that'll help."
To Harry's regrets the hat's next words were:
Rumours had spread as to why exactly Gryffindor as well as Ravenclaw had lost a total amount of 100 points in one night. The suggestions were wild and not anywhere near the truth but this Friday at the latest they would at least know who was guilty.
Terry Boot was a pure blood and his family was known for being unprejudiced,
It was a male voice and it sounded nothing like Dudley or Uncle Vernon.

He looked over at the Slytherin table. Malfoy seemed happier with his friends around him again. Well at least he talked to
She let her eyes wander over the people in the room. Then she suddenly pointed at a blonde second year who was reading a book while sitting on one of the window sills.
Almost disappointed Draco followed suit and put his quill and a roll of parchment out on the desk. Then he leaned back into his chair cutting off all impressions, his gaze wandering off.
When he fell onto his bed in the evening he only just remembered to set an alarm before falling asleep in a matter of seconds. He had done all of these chores for years now but after a year long break it seemed his body and mind weren't used to this daily exhaustion anymore.
"This is your
TW: PTSD (kind of)
And since then Hermione joined Harry and Ron during meals and free periods.
His mother had sent him another letter two weeks ago and assured him she was proud of him, although he'd been sorted into Ravenclaw.
As Draco glanced out the window a small smile played on his lips; the grounds were covered in a thin layer of snow. The Malfoy heir had always loved snow. His mother had used to go outside with him and help him building a snow-wizard. Lucius would watch them through the window and when the two of them came back inside, robes completely soaked, they would sit with each other on the green velvet couch by the fireplace and let themselves enjoy some hot chocolate with cream.
Her gaze sank to the ground as if she had dreaded this question.
Mr Weasly let go of his shoulders.
It was the little girl to his left.
“Yeah, but you had one time more often.”
Especially the last sentence caught Draco's attention.
for not telling him what that meant - they clearly knew something! - and therefore hadn't been visiting the room since that night. Instead he'd been spending more time with Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy and Blaise and sometimes also could be found reading in his dorm. He would never read in the Ravenclaw common room, the others would probably try and
And Harry didn't hesitate to agree. He'd shortly thought about just sending a letter but Hedwig angrily picked his finger bloody when he tried to open the cage. He really didn't want to let the Dursleys win. He needed to go back to Hogwarts. That's where he belonged. That's his home. And so they sat in the car, Ron behind the steering-wheel and Harry just remembered that there were Muggles around when they had set off the ground.
When Harry left the classroom he was half asleep and if someone asked him about the topic of this class he'd have to make a guess. Luckily it had been their last one for this day. Though he was pretty exhausted after his first day of wizarding school, he found that it was far better than muggle school.
Speaking of Padma, she was glaring at him with an accusing look on her face. As if he would lose all those points on purpose.
And the door fell shut right in front of them. With startled and confused expressions they walked back towards the castle.
Harry happily complied.
Graves pinched the bridge of her nose and said nothing for a while.
Ron seemed kind of pleased with that answer but Hermione gave him a doubting look. She didn't question him further, though. Instead she wished him a good night and headed off to the Gryffindor common room, Ron close behind.
The Weasley boys looked shocked.
Ron shouted.
Then Vernon grabbed a hold of him and forced him to his feet. Harry saw the room littered with tiny shards of dark glass punctuating his still bare feet which started to burn
The woman looked shocked and glared at Ron accusingly.
He prodded his head towards his two friends. All he received was a shrug before the blonde set off. Actually he felt a bit bad for leaving him alone.
And there was it, the great difference between Draco and Pansy: Pansy had no respect for authority figures whatsoever. She either did everything to get on their good side with whatever means she had, or she treated them like a dictator would peasants. Harry had no struggles imagining her with a bloody crown on her sleek black hair.
"Can I please just pay, I need to hurry."
Barely five minutes later they were on their way to their parents’ house for their family’s weekly movie night.
“What? I am just saying the truth!”
When his left fist landed in the troll's eye, a huge hand grabbed him by his robes and lifted him into the air. Seemed like his plan had worked....kind of.
got a reaction out of Draco.
As soon as these words had reached Harry’s ears, his body took over for him. He had no idea what exactly his body was doing, he only knew that Draco’s lips felt amazing on his and that this was what he wanted to do for the rest of his life.
And Draco was out.
"You're probably right, Ter! Wait a second!"
Annoying!
The day after his birthday Draco had started his research on the chamber of secrets. It took him a few days until he had found something and his mother was already getting suspicious as to why he spent more time in their library rather than flying on his new broom.
In fourth place, Hufflepuff, with three hundred and fifty-two points; in third, Gryffindor, with three hundred and seventy-seven; Ravenclaw have three hundred and eighty-one and Slytherin four hundred and forty-two."
“Hmm, but you know something.”
Only five minutes later the doorbell rang again. This time Molly went herself.
With shaky steps he managed to get to his door, out and across the hallway into the bathroom. With every move the headache got worse again. When he arrived, the room went black and he felt like vomiting again but somehow he managed to calm himself down by gripping onto the sink tightly. The light hurt in his eyes when he looked up again so he pressed them shut. Blindfolded like that he reached for the cabinet door and opened it.
He was currently lying on his bed, reading, while every now and then throwing a glance at Har- Potter. The black-haired boy seemed pretty nervous. He was always looking at his rather old and ugly watch, obviously waiting for something. Suddenly he jumped to his feet, pulling something out of his trunk. Then Draco recognized the silver material. It was the invisibility cloak Harry had gotten for Christmas. Draco almost smiled in memory of that morning but soon enough he remembered in what it had ended and got angry at Potter again.
“Alright.”

“Uh- um, yes. Yes, sure.”

another reason to laugh at his friends.
He couldn't tell Pansy and Blaise about the dog-creature thing and neither could he mention that he wondered why the Granger girl suddenly started talking to Potter.
Draco’s glare didn’t let up. Harry wasn’t sure for how long they had remained in this position.
The Goyle family arrived soon after and Draco was able to return to his own room with Greg as their fathers had disappeared into Lucius' office to discuss some 'serious matters' and Narcissa had involved Mrs. Goyle in an animated exchange of gossip over a cup of tea. The visitors stayed until after dinner and everything went perfectly well:
This night Draco dreamed of speed and height and wind rushing in his ears and the feeling of the snitch fitting perfectly in his hand.
Unbelievable!
Once he had rounded a few corners and found himself in a hallway that was barely used - even on regular work-days - he turned to look at Draco. The gaze that fell back on him was so intense that Harry was assured his feelings weren’t one sided. He stepped closer to the other man and placed his free hand on his hip. Harry gulped nervously. He could feel every curve and edge of Draco’s body through the soft fabric of the dress.
“It feels wrong to hear you call him that you know?”
"What? Oh, no. Just wondering..."
Draco is the list type. Fight me.
The train left at 11am with Draco on it.
for a change), also insulting Harry's so called ‘friends’, Lucius joining in with insulting Granger's parents and having a weird conversation - actually they just exchanged like 5 words each - with Harry and then having a full on fist fight with Arthur Weasley, leaving the store in a real state. You don't want to hear the details. Anyway, they got picked apart and the bookshelves were restored with a few flicks of a wand. Mildly injured, both father's left the shop, taking their respective families with them and going down the Alley in opposite directions. And that was that.
Draco was just about to take it off again when Pansy barged into the room. He would definitely not wear it tonight.
A year ago, after about the third time that Draco had fixed him back up, he’d been able to brush this off as a stupid crush on a very attractive guy. Now it was clearly more than that and it definitely didn’t seem to go away anytime soon. And he was running out of reasons not to ask Draco out.
Most classes were very interesting,

No Ravenclaw.
He wondered if this had something to do with Hermione.

Although the voice sounded rather inviting, the use of his name - his first name in particular - made a cold shudder run down his spine.
The voice whisper-shouted.
“I- okay.”
McGonagall's eyes widened and she scrunched her eyebrows in confusion.
"I see. Let's do this: I'll sell you a box of living spiders and you can come back to get more if they are used up. If they die you can still feed them to your owl for the following three days
"Thanks."
She had finally found a book with information on Nicolas Flamel and they all agreed that that stone is what Fluffy was guarding. A stone with the power to make someone immortal and to transform any metal into pure gold. With all that information, why should she still do research?

What had The Boy Who Lived actually done again?
"Someone could of been in there! Please Hagrid, tell us what you know about this creature."
"How d'ya know 'bout Fluffy?"
“Blimey, yes.”
Panting, Draco's awareness returned and he glanced to his right to see none other than Harry Potter standing next to him, leaning against the door.
"Plants don't get killed by water, Scarface."
Relieved, Harry let out a breath he didn't know he'd been holding and smiled back at the guy with the thick London dialect.
He was pretty sure that this stuttering idiot would drive him insane within a week.
It was too late; Professor McGonagall and Snape turned into the corridor and immediately spotted them. The four of them all ended up with detention on Friday evening and 100 points were taken from each Gryffindor and Ravenclaw. Then McGonagall took Hermione and Neville back to Gryffindor tower while Snape walked with Harry and Malfoy. Harry couldn't help but wonder whatever was wrong with Draco Malfoy. Sure, after Christmas he had returned to his previous arrogant-pureblood-self but following him outside after curfew? It didn't sound like him at all!
The elf bowed deep before snipping his fingers thrice with a few seconds of silence in between.
"You try and convince him then, 'Mione! You've already read through the whole library twice and couldn't find any new connections anyways."
and that he already owned a broomstick, a
It was Cho Chang, waving him over. He gave her a wide smile. He hadn't had much of a chance to talk to her since the start of term. It was nice seeing her again.
said Hermione while helping herself to some pasta.
“Ron, didn't you say something about an invisibility feature?”
on Monday morning. Her disappointed expression made his heart clench but he would NOT budge this time. He wanted to prove that he was the rightful Malfoy heir.
The blonde gaped at him and seemed to have totally forgotten about the expensive potions set laying half unwrapped in front of him.
Giving in, the boy sat down on the couch once again and was staring in to the orange flames, which were licking on the bricks of the fireplace.
This time it had been Hermione's turn to speak but her suggestion turned out unnecessary.
Finally it clicked and Harry followed Ron away from the masses of pupils. They ran up a staircase and along deserted corridors.
Narcissa's face looked concerned at the sad sound of her son's voice.
"Hah! Got you, Potter! So what have you been doing up there?"
In tenth grade he’d always had Ron at his side when they were waiting for Hermione’s afternoon classes to be over. This year Ron had signed up for an art course in order to get extra credits. Ron wasn’t half bad at drawing, but he absolutely loathed the teacher and deeply regretted his decision. Sadly, there was no way for him to drop the course now. And he desperately needed those extra credits.
"It looked like a ginormous dog... but with three heads..."
Draco took a look on his own watch now.
Harry changed the subject in hope to get a reply this time.
The house elf shook his head enthusiastically, his eyes wide and his ears flapping around making him look extremely ridiculous. And then he just stood there.
Inhaling deeply for a last time, he opened his eyes and put on the mask. His friends should arrive at any moment now.
! He would not finish this thought. He could totally handle this on his own. No need for a buffer.
"Yes, father."
"Perfect! Okay, so you just have to stand still. Oh, no, wait, you better sit maybe."
A boy like this wouldn't be worthy of the Malfoy name!
“This was your own damn idea Parkinson. You wanna chicken out now?”
Harry looked up.
The following weeks all went in a pretty similar fashion: Waking up, making breakfast, doing chores, avoiding the Dursleys and so on.
Draco smirked at him as he surpassed them in full Quidditch gear and with a sleek black-silver broom resting on his right shoulder. Harry was suddenly very aware of the fact that he was wearing an oversized jumper and sweatpants, passed down from his lovely cousin Dudley. Was proper Quidditch gear obligatory for the tryouts?
As he would have to do this anyway, Harry took some toilet paper, let it soak in some water and went to his knees, cleaning up everything including the ugly leftovers in his bedroom. When he was finished he washed out his feet in the shower and wrapped them in toilet paper to prevent them from starting to bleed again. Then he put on two pairs of Vernon's old socks as cushioning and ate his soup which tasted very boring but he didn't expect anything else.
He didn’t end up rereading it that evening, though, as when he opened it, two slips of paper fell into his lap. His list. And the basilisk page.
He didn't want to disappoint his family!
. At some point they would have to talk about everything or it would get way too hard to carry on like they did before. Maybe the week of Easter holidays would bring something new.
The following hour was mostly spent in silence, except for that one time when Blaise asked Draco to lend him an eraser. Every now and then Harry would be glared at but apparently Malfoy had realized there was no point in trying to convince Harry to leave. When the bell was rang to announce the end of afternoon classes, Harry grabbed his things and stood up.
Hermione Granger’s voice echoed in Draco’s head, permanently carved into his brain ever since she said those words. He probably didn’t deserve her kindness either.
"Um, what about
, that makes me feel old."
Harry agreed with him and started to argue that they should go back into the office again another day.
“Well, what do you expect me to do? Tell my father to return them? Can’t you just accept a present?”
“Professor Lockhart! You are very welcome to watch the try outs but please clear the field and join the other spectators in the stands. Thank you, Professor.”
“No one wants to watch your Documentaries either, number three!”
"...and the end of year exams are coming up soon!"
He nodded again. She left. Draco desperately wanted to hex someone, to blame someone for his misery other than his father. With all his anger he glared at the tag attached to the bundle of
"What tapes do you have?"
Harry was confused.
Wait,
"Harry Potter! What an honour-"
"I'm Cho Chang. Second year. I've seen you sitting alone in the common room. Already thought about giving you some company but usually it's better to wait until the first years get to know each other better. You know, so they can find friends their age."
"Will he tell your father? Snape?"
he greeted the blonde, who was reading on his bed. The other boy looked up at him and nodded, before turning his gaze back to the pages. Harry smiled to himself. No insults, no ignoring, no sneer. That definitely could be counted as improvement. Tiredness flooded him when he approached his bed. He changed into pajamas and as soon as his head touched his pillow he fell asleep, exhausted from the long and eventful day.
What the
Suddenly the letter just ripped itself and tiny pieces of expensive and official looking paper sank to the floor. Harry felt at least as shocked as Malfoy looked like. When he found his voice again, Harry cleared his throat and asked:
“Mmh, very cheesy. I like it.”
Doing homework with Draco and Pansy was nothing like doing homework with Draco and Blaise. It was like some sort of weird chemical reaction. Harry tried to think of a specific example, but he sucked at chemistry. Draco and Blaise acted like they were better than everyone by ignoring them or by dropping a snide though intelligent comment every now and then. Pansy acted like she was better than everyone by shouting it in their faces – and she pulled Draco along.
Draco just shook his head wondering what this girl could've wanted from Potter. Why the fuzz about him? After a moment of awkward silence he finally left the common room and the last thing he saw before closing the door behind him was Cho crouching over the leftovers of the ink bottle and pulling out her wand in order to clean up the mess.
But he was a half-blood
He hadn't done anything to deserve so much attention. But soon the happy atmosphere took onto him and he sat down on an empty chair (as far away from Malfoy as possible) with a huge grin on his face.
So, what was holding him back from asking out Draco Malfoy, you might ask.
"Your timetable. And the Weasley boys.... Here you go!"
at your sorting. I expect you to behave perfectly in front of them and prove, that you still are worthy of the Malfoy name."
“Yeah, I know.” Harry’s voice was warm and deep and Draco could feel his chest vibrate softly against his back. He made it very easy for Draco to open up to him.
Snapes office was right behind the potions class room, down in the dungeons. They went there right after breakfast on wednesday morning, after they overheard a conversation between Snape and a student, the latter who told him that Dumbledore wanted to talk to the professor.
Bla bla bla.
After a short silence Harry spoke up,
The confused creases on Malfoy’s forehead multiplied. “Why the fuck would you do that?”
“Woah, are you trying out for the Quidditch team, Harry? That's so cool! Can I take pictures of you flying?”

"Happy Christmas!"
Aimlessly he fled from the other pupils. Away from them.
"Trust me. I wish I did."
But the other boy interrupted him immediately.
He knew
Luckily yesterday's detention story hadn't spread amongst the students yet and Draco had hopes that it would stay like this. He and his father had always been close and Lucius relied on him. He didn't want to disappoint him any more than he'd already had. Around two hours into the journey they bought a few pumpkin pastries for lunch. They were quite good but nothing against what Dobby would create for him this evening. Maybe he would even get his favorite meal tonight.
I mean, you have to see the positive sides: at least now Hermione thought they've been punished enough and was taking to them again.
used every single chance to take points from Harry or to expose him in front of his classmates.
"Hello, kid,"
Harry was getting nervous.
"Well, isn't it obvious?",
For a few moments they remained silent and Malfoy looked like he expected him to do something.
He really hoped it had only been starters luck or so. Otherwise his father would most likely get quite angry.
"What could that creature be guarding? What would Dumbledore need to guard?"
The bell rang.
and that was never a good omen.
Harry didn’t think after this interaction he would’ve been able to get any school stuff done anyways. He did not feel bad for spending the entire time in the library letting his mind wander and letting his eyes take in every detail of Draco’s face.
A rush of happiness was filling their bodys and memories were crossing Draco's mind.
It seemed like it wasn't forbidden to sit at different house's tables. Harry could make out some of the older Hufflepuffs sitting at the Ravenclaw table.
About an hour later they had finally made it to the top of the Astronomy tower where Harry took the invisibility cloak off of them and walked over to the edge to look out for a group of wizards flying towards them. He spotted them right above the forbidden forest.
“Didn’t think so either but that damn dress! You’re driving me insane, Malfoy!”
“It was one of the ghosts. The orange-y one. I told him he looked funny because I like funny things, but he didn't like that and he swooped right through me.”
snapped the pureblood.
Suddenly the room was filled with painful screeching and cracking noises. The four boys covered their ears with their hands which didn't help a lot. Finally Corner reached down with one hand and ended their torture.
know a lot of this stuff already."
The rest of the lesson passed without special events of any kind, it was almost boring as they started off with a bunch of theory first.
He finished the lawn by midday and right after "lunch" (a plain slice of bread) he was told to clean the kitchen - including scrubbing the floor by hand.
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to, I'm so sorry."
Concerned, he waved his gaze over all the students all day long but the blonde didn't show up. Nowhere. Not once.
happen after all?
Draco rolled his eyes and released Harry from his misery.
His father was going to kill him. His only child! A Ravenclaw?!
When he returned to Hogwarts Draco had finally found new confidence and pride in his family name again. That he still couldn't stop thinking about stupid Potter made him really mad but it was nothing that could make him budge again. It kind of helped to rant about it to Dobby. The house elf worked surprisingly well as replacement for
After an early breakfast on Saturday morning, Ron and Harry were strolling across the grounds towards the Quidditch pitch. The Gryffindor had insisted on watching the try outs as soon as Harry had mentioned it. He had tried to convince Hermione to join him, but apparently she wanted to get a headstart on studying. They had tried to tell her that she couldn't possibly have anything to study for on the first weekend of the year but she wouldn't have any of it. Therefore it was just the two of them.
He tried to listen harder.
! A small bell rang to his right. Dinner was ready. Taking a last deep breath Draco left his room and went down a flight of stairs. When he arrived in the dining room his parents were already awaiting him.
On Wednesday he stayed home under the pretence of having a cold.

, right?”
"Salazar, if I don't hurry up, I'm gonna be late for potions! Thanks!"
"Wow, sounds like a great present. Um... who is that singer? I'm pretty sure I've heard the voice before."
End of November came and suddenly everyone was in Christmas mood. Seemed like this atmosphere had even reached the house elves; the Ravenclaw common room was littered with branches of mistletoe, lametta and fairy lights, which eagerly illuminated books and parchments for everyone reading or doing homework at night.
For the first few rounds he just let his muscle memory do all the work and enjoyed the sharp wind in his hair and on his face. Then someone brushed his shoulder and leg while flying past him and somehow flicked on a switch in Harry's conscience that he hadn't known was there before. Instead of everything whirring past him in blurs in his ecstasy, everything was now clearer than ever. He could sense all the things that were happening around him. Including the other players. Which made him aware that he was by far not leading the race. There were at least five or six in front of him, two of them being Cho and Malfoy.
"How did it go?"
“Hello there, number seven!”
It was silent.
exclaimed Boot.
“Okay, keepers and chasers, easy game! I'll make two teams, you play a match, I'll switch out keepers every now and then. 30 minutes, then I'll choose the winners.”
was his father doing with this stuff again?!
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry jumped, got his own legs tangled up in each other and ended up
Ron's face had adapted the colour of tomatoes and he gave an embarrassed nod. Harry felt really sorry for his friend. He knew the Weasleys didn't have the money to buy Ron a new wand just like that. The one he had, hadn't even originally been bought for him but was also a hand-me-down version from one of his older brothers. Harry would immediately offer to give them the money but he knew it was pointless. They would never accept charity, even if Harry didn't mean it as such.
“... but be careful to not let the fame get to your head, Harry. Do you hear me? Don't do any more drastic stunts like the one with the car just to get more of that incredible taste.”

Then he saw him. He was standing at one of the high tables, chatting with Parkinson and Luna. Of course, the only one of his friends who was here tonight just had to be the one who had made friends with Draco Malfoy.
Granger, Longbottom and Potter seemed a bit curious themselves about what was to come. Also Filch looked way too happy today. He even showed his yellowish teeth in what was probably supposed to be a grin but the expression was really more frightening than anything else.
Clearing his throat from all awkwardness he finally entered and went straight for the couch. If the room had changed even a little bit since last year, Draco didn't see it. It was all well-known, homely and comfortable. A nice cup of tea appeared on the small coffee table in front of him. He smiled briefly.

His father had made very clear that he would regret if he did.
Again there were some clicking noises before a song started playing. It started off with some weird noises. Then there was a strange instrument playing a melody. Monotonous but somehow really catchy. Soon a voice started singing.
"Dobby is sorry to say he barely knows the basics."
"Hey....Hey, Malfoy! We're supposed to copy this!"
