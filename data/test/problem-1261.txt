Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. Harry suspected he was trying not to laugh. Ron seemed to have forgotten about Voldemort.
Draco nodded. He tore another piece off the paratha.  "That makes sense. It was his body, but your soul.
Slytherins cringed at the name even more than Gryffindors.  Draco, however, was used to it. "True," he said, "but you may know more about the Death Eaters than even most of the people related to them."  His eyes narrowed, and abruptly, he hurled Julian's glass into the fire, where it shattered in a burst of blue flame. A few people yelped.
"Oh, yeah. Like that, don't you, Harry?" Like--" Draco's words cut off as his voice rose, and his ratcheting thrusts stopped when he was embedded at his deepest. He roared, and Harry felt his body first stiffen completely, and then, slowly, go limp atop his own.
"We have some bad weeks," Harry agreed. "But it's not as big a deal, now, when they start or smooth out. I do think we'll stay friends, and I think you and he will stay friends, even if you break off with him."
"A little." The first time, Draco had been so close when he had come into reach that Harry had hardly had time for a few strokes. It had been gratifying, but hardly educational. The next morning had been more of a languid rubbing together, supplemented by inefficient, but pleasantly mutual, touches. Draco reached for him, but Harry shifted down, out of easy reach.
"Good, then." Draco took another sip. "Yes, you should bring something better down -- but I did mean it about finding more constructive things to do with at least
His breath came out in a whoosh as he suddenly understood the tension. "Of course not! But it's not about that, or even about who's Minister -- it's about
“Padma Patil,” Padma said. “My twin sister is in Gryffindor, and it’s aggravating how differently we’re treated.”
With a derisive snort, Harry shook his head. "You're learning fast. You've made about a term's progress in two weeks. Yeah, you're nowhere near good enough to do a full-body glamour on yourself....." He met her eyes and grinned. "But at this rate, you'll be there by Christmas holidays, and that's the mark that matters."
responsible for that particular punishment, Mr. Malfoy. You were at Hogwarts when the Muggle village was attacked."
Clarke's eyebrows rose. "And yet you managed to get mixed-house social space available at Hogwarts for the first time in three centuries?"
"I haven't had time!" Harry answered indignantly, but, of course, that wasn't really true. He had started the Uncommon Room, he had been in the Chamber of Secrets, and he was secretly taking lessons -- however useless they might be -- with Snape. For that matter, he had cursed Hermione. At least he knew this had nothing to do with Millicent, as she hadn't been summoned with him. Although, that might just mean that the prefects who knew her location -- Draco and Linnet -- were already with her. "Did you say anything?"
"Not if it's clipped in, and the charm is targeted," Draco contributed, shoring up the misdirection.
Harry tried to catch Hermione's expression as he led her into the room, but he wasn't at a good angle for that. Draco, however, had positioned himself perfectly, standing facing the corridor, attractively posed before the fall of ivy that covered the heaped rubble. He smiled in greeting as Hermione stumbled to a halt.
She didn't want to say more, and Harry didn't ask why she knew what he meant. He leaned back against a broad oak tree, crossing his arms sullenly over his chest.
"And you borrow them?" Harry asked incredulously.  He had seen Parkinson with books that had kissing people on the covers, but he had always assumed they stayed... well,
"Blaise Zabini," Blaise said, focusing on Hermione. "But you know that. And you're welcome to call me Blaise. Welcome to the Uncommon Room."
, and we have devised protections, and Harry has, of his own accord, decided that the value of this action is worth the remaining risk."
Suddenly, his head snapped to the side, and in a sudden move, he pushed Harry against the wall, just by the crocodile bed.
"He even got some of them the Muggle way," Remus added, bringing the teapot to the table. He rolled his eyes. "Because enduring unnecessary pain is so manly."
It was mid-afternoon before they got outside. Lessons had not restarted, and most of the professors had been absent at lunch. From the castle door, Harry surveyed the land below. The snow lay in patches where the wind couldn’t reach it, but most of the land was bare and brown. The sun was out, and casting long shadows as it skirted the horizon.
"Go away!" One of her large hands grabbed at the book he was holding, and the motion startled Harry into looking down at the cover.
As if summoned by the thought, Blaise and Millicent cut ahead of them and left the Great Hall. Harry was not surprised to find them loitering outside it.
At the reminder that he could be seen, Draco's stance changed entirely, his back straightening as his head came up. He lifted a hand like a pointer's paw, and he stepped out after Harry.
Draco nodded. "True. He's a Gryffindor -- emotional and impetuous. Pansy's response is more deliberate; rather than complete silence, I find myself at a measured distance, intended to express disapproval, softening when she perceives a potential break between us."
"As you wish, sir." With a smart bow to both of them, Draco left the room, closing the door behind him. To Harry's surprise, Snape then gripped his arm as if about to drag him off somewhere.
Harry rolled his eyes. He had to work to keep his head still, so that his scar would stay covered. "How much," he said clearly, "for two sphinx feathers?"
Slowly, Blaise nodded. "I knew that," he said quietly. "And I don't mind now, really, but...." With a shrug, he stood up and went to where Linnet was sitting. "Would you switch?"
"Oh." Hermione frowned, but there was more consideration to it now. "That doesn't leave a lot of time for schoolwork."
"Of course, it doesn't do to say so, so I usually don't, because arguing is unpleasant and takes too much time and I'm not good at it, sadly, but it's good to get a fresh perspective, now and then, and people without Wizarding upbringings come out with such unique ideas. Some of them are rot, of course, but then there's things like the ink that turns a different color if you spell a word wrong, which I'm told is--"
"Let me show you a grounding exercise," Draco said. "Here. First sit down on the floor, tailor-style."
"What?"  Eugene stared at him, eyes furrowed as if Harry had said something incomprehensible, but Harry could see the guilt in his stance.
The next day, Harry skipped breakfast in favor of sleep.  Defense Against the Dark Arts was a practical lesson, and by the end of it, he felt normally awake. Draco invited Hermione to sit with them during Charms, so Harry was careful not to say much. Twice, he caught Ron watching them, but each time their eyes met, his friend looked away with a scowl. Before he left for Symbology, Harry invited Hermione to meet him for studying in the mixed-house space after lessons.
"There is, however, some harm," Draco pointed out, as if they were discussing some abstract issue in a lesson. "Gargoyles are rare, and if the dust was irresponsibly harvested, the user may be contributing to their decline."
"Yes. I said I'd bring Harry back after breakfast," Remus replied easily, with a slight bow to McGonagall.  "He was at a Christmas party, and the headmaster didn't want him traveling alone."
Draco nodded. "If they can reasonably believe that's the worst of it," he said with a wink. He reached out and took Harry's hand. "Come on, then. Let's find Professor Snape and tell him what we've decided, and then we can go back to Slytherin. You must have mad Gryffindor orgies to tell me about."
"Right." Harry went back to kissing him. Draco moaned into his mouth, and his body pressed forward, hard against Harry's. He wrapped a leg behind Harry, getting it up to his thighs, and Harry tried to pull him up and forward by his arse, and they stumbled, and nearly fell.
The words were thoughtful, but Harry knew them as a correction. He felt himself flush. "Oh, all right. Privacy for that, but you can't hide in there."
"I think it's a fine idea," Blaise stated firmly, although he seemed to be looking at Ron more than Padma.
On Monday, Harry was leaving breakfast with Ron -- Hermione had gone to the library earlier -- when Professor Snape stopped him in the Entrance Hall.
Draco shook his head. “I suggest we leave outdoors until later,” he said. “Let’s stay safely in, for now, where he can rest from time to time. If he can stand up from lunch without wobbling, we will go outside then.”
"Just a little disagreement," Harry said, not lifting his eyes or his wand. "I said Draco wasn't to be disturbed."
"As Susan said, it may not hurt me at all. He may have been displeased, but I'm his sole descendant. Well, as far as we know." Draco laughed. "The only one he's getting credit for, anyway.  He wouldn't want the name to die out."
"Love the feel of your cock," Draco continued, as a satisfied whisper. "Love getting a grip around this, long and hard in my hand, and knowing I did that; you're like that for me; you're like that from taking me in your mouth. Love the way your control dissolves, and you thrust and moan...."
Without thinking about it, Harry shot up from his seat where he had been gaping at the two snarling at each other.  He found himself standing in between the two blonds, his hands holding back Malfoy’s right hand, which grasped his half-drawn wand.  He barely managed to stop the other boy from pointing it at the vampire, who looked ready to forgo restraint and launch himself at the Slytherin.
“Harry!” the girl squawked as she blushed and glowered at him.  Next to her, Ron laughed and Hermione turned her glare on him.  Marylin watched amusedly as the redhead just continued to snicker.
you to please either ignore him or manage to find the slightest bit of civility with each other until both of you are in a private place to yell at each other all you want.  Will you do that for me?”  Her eyes looked pleadingly at him.
“Not an explanation,” Ron replied, still twirling his wand.  Hermione sat patiently, leaning forward on the trunk but making no move yet to the tense black haired teenager.
“Opacre,” Malfoy said, smiling coldly and moving next to a bewildered Harry.  “Surprised to see you again, here of all places.”
“He warned us about it on Friday,” Hermione sniffed, pouring herself some more pumpkin juice.  “It’s your own fault that you chose to play chess and waste your time on Saturday instead of studying.”  Ron shifted his glare to her and the brunette glared back.  For a whole minute, the two silently met each other’s eyes, sparks flying.
From the corner of his eye, he glanced at the vampires again before looking back down at the table.  “The people I’ve talked to have kept up their part, stood down and looked the other way.  Took a couple of mentions about Fred and George’s merchandise but most of them seem to agree with ignoring you snakes so long as you ignore us.”  He shrugged.  “I think most of them are more worried about avoiding Hermione’s rampage as O.W.L.s get closer.”
"You should've just let me hit him," Lest muttered while he held an ice pouch to his cheek, leaning against the room's door post as Marylin finished cleaning up. She left the broken desks off to the side for Filch to pick up when he was doing his rounds. Her light blue eyes shot a quick glare over at her brother as she made the final adjustments to her trinkets.
“Ron, Harry, be serious,” Hermione scolded as the two snickered for completely different reasons. Her brown eyes scowled at them and she placed her hands on her hips as she walked, apparently trying to tower over the two taller boys. “This isn’t a laughing matter at all, Harry could be suffering from sort of wizarding disease or maybe he’s trying to stretch himself out beyond his means.”
His head snapped up and he took a step back as he found Draco leaning against the sink, looking at him.  He hadn’t even noticed him come up.
As interesting as these other findings were however, none were as interesting as the first finding.  Qye's Journal.  The night after returning with the things from the cupboard, after he had looked through all the other findings, after he once again made sure everyone was asleep, he had opened that.
“The boy probably left,” Lest said coolly, turning away and beginning to walk away. “There’s no reason he should be here.” As he began to walk past a tree, he turned his head over a shoulder, drawling, “Perhaps we’ll catch him if we - ”
,' Harry thought distantly, a thought as quiet as the rest of the class. His green eyes were locked onto that smirk, even as Ron picked himself off the floor, even as the trinkets and book flew back neatly to the desk, even as Professor Opacre slowly moved from her place. '
“You almost killed me, you dimwit! Did you ever stop to think with that peanut-sized lump of wood in your head that’s a mockery of a brain, you arse?! I swear, what the
“No idea what I’m talking about, huh, Harry?” Seamus snickered, his eyes dancing.  “Riiight, I believe you.  The fuss you made this morning
“Will he be alright?” Hermione asked anxiously, her brown eyes full of worry. There were residues of tear trails on her face and her eyes were red-rimmed.
Silence and then the warm breath of Draco's chuckle passed by his neck and ear. "We'll see about that...Harry."
Slowly, Dobby's eyes opened, and he nodded. "Dobby will do as Master Harry wishes," he said. "Is there anything else?"
Ignoring Ron's glower, Harry turned. Brown leather straps cut down from the shoulders of Snape's normally smooth black wool coat, pulling it into little tucks, and through the strands of his hair, Harry could see the top of a wicker basket behind them. He had to struggle to maintain a straight face. "Yes, sir?"
McGonagall lifted her head. "I have many more questions for you, Mr. Malfoy, but few pertain to the trial. No, take your seat, for now."
Harry found himself reemerging in the headmaster's office, pushing back his incongruously dry hair. He had no idea what to say. Had the lightning bolt seemed like Voldemort's name to Dumbledore? A sigil like the Dark Mark? "That's not-- That wasn't...." Dumbledore let him struggle. Bizarrely, it reminded him of Snape. He took a breath. "That's all out of context," he said evenly. "I mean, those chopped up little bits look bad, but there were other things going on."
“So they cursed her to curse me, and I fell.” Harry winced, remembering the other students all around. “It didn’t really look like I meant to, did it?”
to open the Chamber -- everyone seems to know that -- but it takes a Parselmouth to actually do it, and she isn't one."
For a moment, he looked at the other boy from the corner of his eyes, confused by his actions.  He shook his head after a minute, bemused, and returned his attention back to his potion.  Picking up his own pinch of firefly wings, he sprinkled it in the potion.  He winced slightly as it turned light blue with a tinge of green.
Harry slumped slightly, his bitterness and fury at Voldemort and Fudge rising slightly in him.  More lives ruined and he closed his eyes slightly in sorrow for whoever’s life would be changed by this.  Then he opened them again, raising his green eyes to stare at the silent Headmaster.
"But they didn't work," Zabini frowned. His hazel eyes glanced grudgingly over at Hermione, who still look irritated. "And even I have to admit Granger's execution is flawless."
“You should be more careful,” the vampire suddenly said, leaning against the table.  Harry gave a small start, glancing up at the still indifferent man.  His brow furrowed slightly and he unconsciously slowed his stirring.
Again, as if summoned by his thought, the other member on the case swept in, ignoring the way the Minister of Magic jumped aside, grimacing and trying not to look at her as she picked up her own chart.
His eyes followed the retreating back of his friend, silently urging the vampire to look back once at him, one look and see him, anything, but Lest never turned back, coolly walking towards his place. His heart clenched painfully and he lowered his eyes to the ground.
:: muttered Harry as he pushed himself up. The room spun and the teenager staggered, gripping a bedpost to prevent himself from falling on his face.
“Not really,” Qye said blandly, forcing any traces of a smile off his face, leaving it calm and collected. “Just an observation. You know,” he said, pausing for a moment to pretend that a thought had come to him, “I think you owe me an apology for causing me to fall out of that tree.”
Her head started to pound from thinking about the what ifs and she sighed, rubbing her temples again.  She had to stop thinking about it, now wasn’t the time.  She glanced down at the letter.  Oh yes, now was very much
“Um…Mr…Mr. Opacre,” Hermione said awkwardly and Marylin choked when she saw Lest twitch. She coughed frantically when her younger brother shot her an irritated look.
Hermione and him had tried every method to find out what was bothering Harry, her with her badgering, Ron with giving Harry space and waiting for him to tell him what was wrong.  Neither way seemed to work though.  Harry just continued to keep to himself, spending too much time by himself in the Library.  He didn’t even seem to care about anything anymore, not even Quidditch.  He acted like his once favorite pastime was now a requirement of him.
"You know what?" Professor Opacre broke in irritably, crossing her arms. "I think you have more than enough information to go on." She waved a hand at them, moving off her desk. "Up you go, to the back of the room with all of you unless you wish to be the first guinea pig."
He felt a brush against his mind, hesitant and hopeful.  He reached for it numbly, shivering as he felt Qye grasp back tight.
He turned his head slightly to watch her walk quickly over to a trunk.  He saw her lift a hand and quickly brush at her face before she looked through it.
But Qye had never done that before. Harry furrowed his brows. Well, never when he was awake. Qye had always been alert in his mind whenever he was conscious, sometimes quiet and just watching from behind his eyes and other times relaxed and reading his memories. He never recalled Qye ever feeling like this before.
“Lest?” she asked hesitantly, looking into his eyes, noting how distant and distracted they seemed.  She saw them focus and immediately all traces of fire disappeared behind an indifferent expression.
He stared at him.  “I’m sorry, you saw me at the Yuletide Ball last year, right?” he finally said, raising his eyebrows.
“Harry,” Lest began and stopped again as red sparks emitted threateningly from Harry’s wand, his grasp tightening.
The female vampire bared her fangs at the black-haired man, blue eyes dark with fury and her brother looked at the Potions Master with sleepy, half-closed eyes, absently fingering something around his neck.
Qye stared, eyes wide with shock and his breath coming out rapidly, at the beige comforter, light blue pajamas clad legs and pale golden skin that adorned a pair of feet. Hesitantly, Qye thought of flexing one of the toes and took in a sharp breath as it obeyed his thought. Snapping his eyes closed, he took several deep, calming breaths, shaking more as he inhaled the crisp, sterile air, recognizing that he was smelling it himself.
"Bragging that you're better than me in those fields does not say anything about my own skills," Lest replied, tossing her an icy look. She shrugged and took his arm.
"What are you talking about?" Harry finally broke in, frustrated. He kept glancing back at Professor Opacre through the quiet argument but she just seemed to be idly perusing the parchment. She didn't appear to hear their whispers but he certainly didn't want to draw attention to himself and -
His mind imploded.  Everything rushed in, swirling into the middle, spiraling, spiraling to the blackness in the middle.  It pulled him in like a whirlpool, dragging his mind into the middle. . .
“I can’t think of anything to write,” he said defensively, looking back down at his essay.  “I only need a conclusion and that should more than fulfill the length requirements.”  He sighed slightly.  “Of course, I can’t think of any conclusion.”
Ron muttered and reluctantly followed Hermione into the classroom.  Harry lingered in the corridor for a moment before sighing and following his friends resignedly.
"Honestly! It may be common belief that he's too clever by half, but I've never heard anyone accuse him of ignoring his own best interest. He won't do anything so idiotic, I'm sure."
Harry laughed and gave his hand a little squeeze. "Well, birth is out of the question, but I enjoy your creativity."
Harry nodded silently, afraid of how his voice would sound if he spoke. He knew that the praise would have made him feel guilty, even six months ago. He now realized that it was intended to influence him to cooperate, and instead of guilt, he just felt anger, and a surge of satisfaction at the escape he had planned.
A surprised exclamation from Ron drew Harry's attention from the letter. Hermione, between them, had her fists clenched in her lap.
Harry curled himself into blankets and safety and gathered his courage.  "I remember the taste of your blood."
"Slytherin," Harry taunted. "Look, I'm making an apothecary purchase in Knockturn Alley, and since I saw you..." He shrugged. "Anything you want me to pick up for you?"
It didn't. He scooped a tiny amount onto his plate, dipped his pie in it, and licked it from the crust.
"Right. She said I could tell you, but you have to keep it to yourself." Harry took a quick breath. "I'm helping her with a sex change."
And once he found her, where could he take her that was private, but didn't give those secrets away? He considered reusing the nightclub, but he hadn't asked Zabini what protections he had dismantled, and getting caught by Aurors would be not only dangerous, but embarrassing. He had thought up and discarded a dozen schemes before the most useful modification of Zabini's occurred to him -- he would lead Bulstrode out into Muggle London and make similar use of some Muggle place. The protections would be easier to disable, and if he by some ill chance failed, he could deal with Muggle police easily enough.
"She was a Slytherin, Potter. These things must be done with care. She will be more amenable to an alliance if she believes the thought was her own."
Parvati took on a shrewd expression, her eyes narrowing in a way that made Harry uneasy. She was planning to target someone, he believed, although she managed not to reveal her quarry by looking.
He didn't get to say more, because Harry's control went to nothing at that. He grabbed Draco's arse and pulled him tight in to a motion he couldn't stop until he came, roaring, and everything slowed to a blissful overload. He dissolved down, still tangled with his lover.
Harry glanced at his left hand. Again, he could see faint white lines across it. He held his arm out, twisting it to show the back of his hand to Snape. "Curse scar."
!" she shouted, as she pursued him. Harry chuckled to himself. Definitely a Sorting problem. He lengthened his stride, and caught the shifting section of wall before it could close behind their argument. The stones stopped in mid slide, much like the door to a lift, probably due to much the same safety considerations, however differently fulfilled.
In that way, it was rather like the chicken. Now that Harry had the idea -- and knew the feat was possible -- the milder spells were closer to being in reach. He managed two out of the next five.
Laughing raggedly, Harry came up on his elbows. "Fine with me. Do something with it, though -- I've never been so desperate." He brought his hand down to wrap Draco's fingers around his shaft, and encourage them in a stroke. With a tsk, Draco slapped his hand away.
"Octavius is a gambler, in and out of debt, and once suspected of poisoning a young Krup -- not fatally, but to keep him out of a competition. He belongs to the Avalon Club, as you saw, and to the Mages of the North Sea."
At the doorway, Harry and the solicitor walked past each other as if the other didn't exist, but Harry didn't make it far. Fred and George Weasley were waiting outside his room.
"Since I can't get around Tom, it doesn't matter!"  With a huff, Harry leaned against the wall. "You don't have a spare flat in London, do you?"
Angelina's greyhound stopped before him. "Message from St. Mungo's," she said crisply. "Miranda Leroy's asking for you.  Didn't know you knew her. Your call."
It was definitely time to get some of the lube on himself. Harry cast the simplest of the protection charms he knew -- he had tried all of the ones from Lupin's book in private, but pointing a wand at his cock was still unnerving -- and slicked himself up. This one was a sort of barrier. He could feel the motion of his hand, but not the wetness, which was weird.
"Well." Harry shrugged. "It's something we fought about, early on. He couldn't see why I did, and I said it was important to me that shopkeepers have money to live on. He has trouble understanding how that matters, unless someone makes him think about it."
"You could ask for re-sorting, you know. It's not common, but there's a spate of it every hundred years, or so."
She examined the glowing stripe on the wall, running one thick finger along the unlit grey line below it, and then glanced to where the light arched over what had been the other door. "I see." She shrugged. "Well, I'm no Merlin with charms, but I can move rocks." With a grin, she picked up a head-sized stone and hefted it in one hand.
"They'd already chosen me as Head Girl, and since Malfoy's mother already knew -- through some leak on the Board of Governors -- that he'd been chosen Head Boy, they couldn't make me Head Boy and choose another Head Girl. And since my marks are better than Malfoy's, they couldn't pass me over. Thus, we have two Head Boys -- but I'm allowed to go in the girls' dormitories, if needed, as they know it's nothing I haven't seen before. I
Draco laughed scornfully, and Harry pushed his hair back in exasperation. So that was Snape's problem, was it? He wasn't expected to allow Draco to have an opinion?
He choked down an indignant denial. Wasn't that what he had been saying? Hadn't he spent the last three months trying to connect to people who didn't agree with him? But going to Snape had been half defiance, just the same.
"Don't think you're getting away that easily!"  she chided as they moved out of sight of the Great Hall. Draco was waiting, leaning against the railing of the grand staircase. "You didn't come back to Gryffindor after practice last night, and I don't believe you've been there yet."
"And at that, done too fast, we could get someone killed," Seamus said harshly, looking hard at Harry.
"True, but a project with Snape -- without her -- might give us time to consult with him without it being questioned."
"What of it? I have done nothing to help him, Richard. Unlike some people, I respect the laws we're supposed to be upholding."
"Oh! Did Tonks -- Auror Tonks, I mean...."  Harry stumbled over how to ask the question. Draco had turned to stare at them.  Horsyr laughed.
"Some." He could hint, he realized. "Less than half. I certainly need to clear it with Parvati and Padma."
"Inside," Snape spat out, by way of greeting.  When the door closed behind them he relaxed only slightly. "Good. You are on time, at least. Your wand, Mr. Potter?"
Life as a social outcast had not improved Severus Snape any. His hair hung in greasy hanks, neglected enough to have formed knots at the base, which they never had at school. His face was gaunt as well as sallow, and there was a touch of paranoia in the way his attention twitched to the side. Of course, Harry realized, the kettle was still there, steam now rising from the spout, but he wasn't willing to get up and move it for
"Giles Goyle has been a friend of mine nearly all my life. When he invited my son and me to a social gathering, it was only natural to accept. But then, his portkey brought me to an unexpected location, and I was obliged to watch, hopelessly outnumbered by his loyal servants, while He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named attempted to similarly brand my son." Lucius took in a hard, painful breath, and Harry watched with growing hatred a performance that might have convinced him had he not known better.
"Huhn." Harry sat back and tried to think. Morals aside, what would be the most effective way to destroy Lord Voldemort? The problem was, he realized, that he had no idea. He didn't even know if he could. Naturally, there were hundreds of ways he could fight the Death Eaters, with or without Dark Arts, but he had no idea what, if anything, would work against Voldemort. Choosing Darker weapons would not necessarily make him more successful.
"Harry, take these two back to your room, would you please? If the message is too private to be given to you, they will need to wait." His glance raked scornfully over the twins before returning to Harry. "Of course, anything too private for you, I would hope the headmaster would have the sense not to tell to
"Not this week. He was gone all Saturday, you'll recall, and you were off with Ron, and it was too wet to fly, so I'm actually finished. I think you can claim me for the evening."
They left the Chamber of Secrets before dinner was due to end, so Draco could be found by Hermione. To facilitate that, he turned in at the library, whilst Harry continued on to the Gryffindor Common Room. He settled by the fire, and Ron joined him. They talked about Cornelia's development as a Beater, and what Finch-Fletchley had said in Cursebreaking, and the twins' latest tricks. Harry didn't get much done, but he was too happy to mind. When Hermione came in, he looked questioningly at her, but she shook her head and went on to her room. Ron frowned after her.
. Having made a potentially demeaning request, you gave her a way to demonstrate control of the situation, and thus gain status instead."
Professor Dumbledore, who was standing in front of the great fireplace as if he had just flooed in, greeted him with a quick nod. "Mr. Potter. It is good I knew where to find you." He held out the jar of Floo powder. "Call 'Hogwarts Headmaster's Office.' The grate is open to you. We will speak there."
"He had a Muggle father. He told me about it, when I was bound to the man's gravestone -- how his Muggle father had abandoned his pregnant mother, but now his bones would serve him."
Harry was surprised to find himself annoyed. He wanted a bath, he wanted to walk in Diagon Alley, and he wanted some pleasant time with Draco.
"I am not interested in Black's little problems," Snape sneered. "Have you any suggestions to make the visit safer?"
"Your nephew's escort," Snape said coldly. "We will go to his room. If you do not complain or interfere, I may restore your husband's voice before I depart."
"Wait." Harry enforced the word with a glare. "I'm not angry, all right? But our lot is a mess, and we need to talk."
"Now?" Harry asked. The strange Auror turned to him with a glare that almost made Harry step back. "Er -- Hermione said she'd wait for me." He gestured back to the spiral staircase, and Dumbledore nodded solemnly.
He hadn't even known he thought that until it came bursting out. Hermione wrapped her arms around him, her chest warm and soft against his back.
"She just worries about me," he said, studying his hands. "She doesn't understand plants, and she's right I'm not very strong magically--"
Harry started to work the cords of the sack open, but Draco leaned forward and lifted a hand to signal a pause. "Wait. Weasley, are you confident you can configure a bowl from the coins?"
With a swirl of her wand, Pansy canceled the Privacy charm.  "Thank you, Potter." She stood and offered her hand. "I accept your kind offer. I am inclined to believe you, as you have spoken more frankly to me than anyone else in this debacle, but I will withhold judgment until you produce the supporting evidence." She turned to her supporters. Tuktuk had at some point returned to Daphne and was now comfortably settled between the sisters. The Quiri yawned and stretched back as they rose.
"The boy's pets are not your affair. You cat will know not to attack an animal carried by a wizard, correct?"
"Right. And after that, he visited and terrified my Muggle relatives. That was amusing." At the startled looks from Astoria and Pansy, Harry grinned. Showing the Slytherins that they didn't know him was surprisingly fun. "Remus Lupin came by too. It was by far the best summer I've had at the Dursley's
"Then you have nothing to worry about." Harry nuzzled Draco's arm above where it still gripped his shoulder. "Rub up against me for a little while, at least? You never do that for long enough."
The redhead raced through the corridors to Gryffindor Tower, pulling an indignant Hermione along, barely pausing to gasp out the password, rushing through the common room and up to the Fifth Year boy’s dormitory.
:: he said sullenly, shaking his head slightly to dispel the unsettling feeling of rummaging in his head.  ::
The dog growled softly and Remus lowered his hand, warningly patting Sirius on the neck as he continued to smile at the woman.
They sat in silence, much as they had this past week as revelation after revelation was thrown at them.  The rooms the Headmaster had given them were close to the rooms that only Smethwyck and Madam Pomfrey visited daily, carefully bordered with magical wards courtesy of the Headmaster and the vampire guard now on the outside of the wing instead of that corridor Sirius and Remus had only walked once.
“Qye would’ve fit right in,” Harry said and Qye turned to him, saw the knowing look in his own eyes.
But oh no, it didn’t end there.  After managing to control his body’s responses to the browsing feeling, he then had to control his reactions to Qye’s comments.  He never thought a ten year old – or anyone for the matter – could have a coarser vocabulary than Ron but he was proven wrong.  Madam Pomfrey had almost dragged him back to the Infirmary after seeing him blush one too many times, convinced he must have been coming down with a delayed reaction to the potion.
Hermione had been the first one in the room, finishing up her summary to Harry when she entered the doorway, abruptly stopping in movement and speech. Harry, walking with her, peered over her shoulder to see the male vampire lounging carelessly at the desk, his blue eyes fastened unwaveringly on them.
He rubbed his chest, still feeling a small knot in there.  Despite the fact that Qye had given him some information that he hadn’t known, it still wasn’t solid evidence to disprove his thought.
“I don’t think I’m ready to be…dignified…with a ‘Mister’ quite yet,” Lest said stiffly. He growled suddenly. “For Hélène’s sake, do I look
Hermione, while they took a quick bite in the courtyard wistfully looking out at the spring day, abruptly asked, “Will you tell us why you needed that potion?”
Helpfully patting her on the back, he shoved the pop back into his mouth and raised an eyebrow at Ron, who looked something in between amused and disgruntled. Finally he sighed, turning amused and sympathetic eyes on Harry who grew slightly wary.
They were seated at breakfast and Ron and Hermione had just finished handing out the time-tables to all the Gryffindors.  Now they were looking at their own and Harry was silently agreeing with the fuming Ron.
“Malfoy,” Lest said, a cold smile appearing on his face to match his freezing eyes, “I think I’ll leave torturing the innocents to you.  I guess you’re used to it since we all know that you’re such a daddy’s boy that you’ll follow in his footsteps eventually.  Tell me, are you still licking his shoes before you go to bed?”
It was a quiet sound, the gentle beat of the summer rain against the roof and windows of the Burrow.  It pattered repetitively, droplets pooling together and growing larger as they slid down the glass.
“Hermione, I really think we should get back, I don’t think it’s such a good idea – where are we going?” he asked as he suddenly found himself standing outside of the Three Broomsticks.
Marylin watched as the three Gryffindors climbed into the kitchens from around the corner.  She really did have a staff meeting to go to but she couldn’t help but watch the three for a bit longer.  She hadn’t been lying when she told them they were among her best.  She just hadn’t told him what they were best at.
Lest stepped forward but stopped as the vampire squeezed Harry’s throat, smirking as he looked at Dazain who attentively watched, eyes flicking occasionally to Lest.  Lest froze and bared his teeth, trembling with restrained wrath.
“It’s not our fault, mate,” Ron defended, clapping him on the shoulder – Harry winced – with a bag slung over his shoulder. “Pomfrey refused us – or anyone, really – to see you until she deemed you fit and proper.” The Weasley boy grinned and dropped the bag on Harry’s lap. “And since everyone was too lazy to bother to keep up with your well-being, they sent me as a messenger boy with their get well letters and rubbish.”
“Let me look you over in the meantime,” the man said soothingly, raising his hands and Qye eyed him, remembering how his wand had fallen from his grasp when he had been thrown.  “Headmaster, please send Poppy as soon as you can,” he added without looking away from them, his eyes meeting Qye’s suspicious ones patiently and not taking a step closer.  “Ms. Nilsson, I will let you know when you can return.”
Ron panted, curled up and grimacing as he forced himself to move back, fought the urge to glare at the vampire’s face, which was exactly what he wanted, the same way he had knocked Justin and Ernie unconscious.
Professor Opacre laughed quietly, her eyes twinkling.  “Ah, that’s good,” she grinned, her fangs glinting slightly.  “I wouldn’t want Severus here to kidnap you every night for detention.”
He saw the fight drain away from Lest, the desperation dulling in his eyes as they turned blank and fell to the floor.
“It’s the fact that I’m never, ever going to be normal, am I?” he murmured as he opened his eyes and looked over at her.
“The Dark Lord wasn’t lying about tying the portkeys with the beasts,” hummed the man as he twisted the spiked wristbands.
“If you say you have two more in, I know damn well you have ten left, Blaise,” Malfoy said, straightening from where he bound the last vampire on their side of the field and looked around, feet never settling despite the cuts across his body.  He had been one of the first to discard his robes, his dwindling number of vials in the pockets of his pants.
They had reached the lake only to find no sign of Harry. Marylin looked around and then caught sight of Ron, shifting around uncomfortably, fingering something in his pocket. She raised an eyebrow when she saw him shoot a furtive look to Hermione. The bushy-haired girl nodded slightly and then turned to her and Lest.
"Yes, I thought you'd figure it out after I took you out of the situation, Hermione," Professor Opacre smiled. Addressing the class, she continued. "Spells aimed to interrupt the mind or brain will, I assure you, fail. Since a vampire has so much training - simple, instinctive, day-to-day training - with using their minds to control their abilities, it's no wonder they'll immediately recognize an attack on it and be able to cut it off, or at least mount a suitable defense. Furthermore, since our minds
Instead of meeting with contemptuous gray eyes as he usually did, he was met with the backs of Malfoy’s little court.  The blond wasn’t there.
“Not like you were honest about anything else,” Harry cut in sharply and Qye slid his eyes over, impressed by the cold look leveled at Lest.
From his parched dry throat a series of painful coughs emerged and the sounds ceased. A soft whimper echoed wherever he was and he realized with muzzled confusion that it came from him. He tried to stop but couldn’t, coughing and whimpering and the boiling water poured from his skin.
The figure in black laughed quietly and lazily walked closer to them.  Petunia’s hysterical sobs began to grow higher in pitch and the man turned to look in annoyance in her.  In an instant, her screams were cut off and her eyes bulged.  Choking sounds began to issue from her.
"Ah, don't listen to her, Harry," Ron grinned as they approached the classroom.  "Enjoy yourself, relax and take a load off.  It's the holidays for heaven's sake!  And the O.W.L.s are so far off, we'll have plenty of time to study later."
She adjusted her robes as she let the vampire struggle with this.  She gave a glance to Jonas, standing silently next to Nilsson.  She had briefed the other members of the team before sending her summons to the group.  She nodded slightly to give him the signal and he cleared his throat, drawing everyone’s attention to him, as he flipped to his own section in the report.
that vampire is a pureblood. However, even then, they would not be able to use the power of the jewel at its maximum potential if they had been pureblood.
' as Lest had been heavily irritated at the attack against his vision. Zabini had crashed against the floor with a wave of Lest's hand and telekinesis with his wand flying into Lest's other hand. Zabini walked away with more bruises to his ego than his body.
“He’s family,” Sirius snarled, raising his wand, red sparks shooting out.  “I don’t know who the hell you think
But he didn't move his entire body. Arms still folded, he tilted his head just enough that the inkpot brushed past him and Hermione had to duck the rushing object, making it crash into the wall behind her. Throughout that, Lest never moved his eyes from Hermione.
Harry peered into the bag bulging with homemade cards telling him to feel better and chocolates of every kind from Honeydukes. “How considerate.”
And that entire collection flew towards Ron, all at different speeds and distances. A simple Shield Charm wouldn't be able to hold them off.
“How sweet,” he heard a vampire laugh.  Ron gritted his teeth and stopped shifting back, listening to Seamus mumble prayers while Dean took Ron’s other side.
Rain poured outside and thunder bellowed.  His cousin didn’t turn to face him as he said quietly, “First, I’m going to get rid of the Dazains we have right now.  Then I’m going to try and ally ourselves with the wizards.  After the alliance seems sure enough that we can rely on it in case the Dazains do ally themselves with Voldemort, I’m going to do something I’ve been wanting to do for a long time.”
The vampire had seemed surprised by how he almost broke free when he quickly woke up from being knocked out, Qye shouting Harry to alertness.  Seeing Wormtail, the man who helped send him to the Dursleys, sent Harry pushed back as Qye clawed for the traitor before Harry regained control to grab his wand.  By then, the vampire had secured him and Harry struggled, trying to break free as the nervous man had shakily tucked it into his pocket, mumbling that he shouldn’t struggle.
“I suppose airhead would be a better term,” the vampire said, his voice suddenly breaking into Harry’s thoughts.  Harry blinked and found pale lips twitching slightly as blue eyes continued to express faint amusement.
The figure’s arm shot out before the door could close anymore and, without an outward display of strength, pushed back at it.  Vernon shouted as the door flung open all the way, crashing against the wall.  The force against the door had sent him sprawling down the hallway and he could hear the cries of his family as they rushed out of the living room and into the hallway.
The Libidates suddenly raged and he was overwhelmed with a sudden force of jealousy and possessiveness.  Yes, he was beautiful.  And he knew he wasn’t the only one who saw it.  How many had seen his boy’s beauty and tried to claim it?  A silent growl grew in him.  It didn’t matter.  The beauty had already been claimed before it had blossomed.
“I didn’t mind,” Lest said quietly. Then the vampire turned and left, his sister following after waving a cheery goodbye to Ron and Hermione.
“Just something Weasley and I talked about,” Malfoy answered, signaling for two butterbeers to a frazzled but obviously pleased with business Madam Rosmerta.  “Turns out we had some common ground.”
“So you admit that teaching this lot of…children…to be laborious then?” Lest finally spoke, voice smooth and calm, an ironic smile crossing his pale features.
Harry suddenly found himself in a world torn in two and searing pain that accompanied the tear. In one part, he heard someone let out a loud scream that echoed throughout somewhere, thinking it sounded a bit like him. The screams of other people, not quite as loud, accompanied that one lone shriek. He heard people that sounded like Ron and Hermione and Professor Opacre shout, fear and worry and confusion in the voices.
“I’m providing his magic with a framework to fixate on,” Smethwyck replied calmly, the light on the wand fading away as he straightened up and ran an eye over Harry.
"That's 'of course' in his speak. Trust me," she smiled, "he did well with the others. Furthermore, with the experience he's gained from dueling against the other students, he has a greater knowledge of what your capabilities are and how far he should hold himself back. Now then - "
, the bark smooth and cool against the clothes he wore and he could have happily stayed there for the rest of the day, perhaps for as long as he was in Harry’s body. But no,
“You do too,” Harry responded, smiling back at her.  He glanced between her and Ron and a little smirk came upon his face.  “Any particular reason?”
The vampire glanced down and snorted.  “Water?  Let me guess, you think by making this holy water - ”
“More of a claim than you,” Lest replied smoothly and Sirius narrowed his eyes.  Lest turned his gaze to his sister who sighed and met Sirius’ eyes reluctantly.
“I can’t believe this is happening,” Sirius whispered and Remus gave into the urge to drop a hand on his friend’s shoulder, gripping it tight in support.  “Not like this, Moony.”
“There was a family,” Draco said distantly, a far away look in his eyes.  “My parents had gone to school with the father, knew him as one of those who could’ve been in Slytherin if he just wanted a bit more.  They had a young girl, three or four.”  He swallowed.  “I heard my father talking with the Dark Lord.  The Dazains had gone at them.  A test, they said.  What remained…they couldn’t even determine who was who.  He ordered it covered up, to keep it quiet so that the others wouldn’t falter with the alliance with the Dazains.”
It was almost amusing to see the nurse sputter and Smethwyck stare at him in resignation except the other adults were staring at them, trying to make decisions about them just like he told Harry they would.
“If one more person asks me if I’m all right, I may be forced to do things that I’ll regret later on,” he said mildly, dropping his eyes back down to Neville’s to show that he was just joking.  Neville smiled slightly before turning back to talk with Ginny.
“What deal?” Harry asked, his face slightly flushed from all the attention they were getting.  The crowd was slowly slipping back into their conversations amidst the flow of butterbeer and the latest hit from the Weird Sisters but it wasn’t hard to miss their side-eyed glances or whispers of “
The deep, captivating green eyes belonged to none other than the same boy who had paralyzed her during the Welcoming Feast.  She didn’t know who this young black-haired boy was but the minute her eyes had locked onto his, she had felt this surge of something go through her mind, rendering her unable to do or say anything for a minute.  The Headmaster Dumbledore had questioned concernedly after she had barely managed to tear her eyes – and it had felt like tearing her mind – away from the boy.  She had fumbled for an excuse and thankfully the old man had managed to buy it.  For the rest of the night, she had avoided looking at the particular spot where the boy had been sitting.  When she had looked at his retreating back, she had felt the same surge pass through her mind, albeit weaker than the first time, and she had managed not to show any outward sign of it.
He had drifted in and out of consciousness a lot yesterday. Not so much as to worry, he could’ve attended classes if he wished – he had tried to argue this with Pomfrey but all she did was give him a flat look and dose him with more vile-tasting concoctions – but it was probably best all around that he had stayed in bed. Not that anyone would hear him say that. Today had been much better, only falling asleep twice and only after downing his medicine.
“What?” Harry said, looking up, startled, as Qye blinked, clearly thrown off.  Remus started to smile slightly, a glimpse of bitter reminiscence in his eyes.
It didn't escape his notice that Draco took his time gathering his materials from his desk, leaving him as one of the few not running to the back of the room. "Ha ha, you're cute," he thought he heard Professor Opacre mutter when she caught sight of him standing by his desk, straightening the sleeves of his robes. She not-so-gently edged Draco with a finger and Harry caught sight of the smirk he tossed the vampire over his shoulder before he moved next to the rest of the students, stopping right in the front.
"I told you this was a bad idea, Soror," Lest said from the corner of the room he had been lounging in. "You can't expect a bunch of
“I - ” Lest whispered and his head whipped to the side as Qye slapped him, panting and blinking away the tears furiously.
“That’s typically referred to as amnesia, dear,” Professor Opacre said gently, sitting on one of the seats next to his bed. For whatever reasons, Professor Opacre and Lest had opted to stay, Lest leaning against one of the walls and staring at him with an odd look on his face. When he had replied to the questions asked – especially the one about grabbing Lest in the Hall – he thought he caught a trace of disappointment in the vampire’s face. But when he glanced again, the male vampire wore his typical impassive face.
“I will say it as many times as I need to,” said a voice that was in every moment of his thoughts, his clearest recollection from late night talks, snarling arguments and helpless laughter.
He felt the tears streaming down his face as he stared down at his hand, white knuckled around the door handle.
There was another blow coming, he felt it building up slowly, and his heart thudded fearfully as he felt that it would be the last, that it would shatter him, that it would take him away…
:: Harry said confusedly, his brow furrowing more and his head pounding from all this new information.
“I’m sorry that you all had to lug those things here,” she said apologetically.  “I wish I could have sent a notice to tell you not to bring them for the first day but I didn’t really know how.  Please know that I apologize for any inconvenience it may have caused you.
The Gryffindors, in an uncharacteristic attitude, silently filed in and took their seats, most of them staring at the new feature in the room while the ones who weren't staring, were very much obviously trying not to stare. In the time since Lest had arrived at Hogwarts, he had never once been in the classroom.
She really didn't have choice, did she? Just brightly smile, explain their faults and strengths, cheerfully tell them their assignments as they confusedly gathered their things and ask them not to warn anyone as she slammed the door behind them.
Harry said desperately as he stumbled back, the vampire striking right where he had been and taking a chunk out of a tree next to them.
“This is Libby Wainscott,” Smethwyck introduced the brown-haired woman at his side with her faint smile and piercing gaze.  “She’s my colleague at St. Mungo’s and a long-time friend since before our days at Hogwarts.  As you both know, she will be conducting the evaluation.”
:: Qye said sarcastically. Harry ignored him and the feel of his glare, forcing a smile onto his face.
“Harry?” Dean mumbled sleepily, blinking from where he lay in bed.  “Ron, what the hell is going on?”
Marylin carefully looked at her brother as she straightened her Gemmae and the scarf tied around her waist, her brief happiness fading.  “Yes…I think it’s with Draco, too, though he wouldn’t say anything.”
in a worried voice, and the blunt end of the broken leg crashed into his left shoulder with such force it knocked him around and sent him crashing to the floor. His wand slipped from his fingers at the last moment, landing beside his head as he fell and tasted the floor.
“Works for me,” Ron murmured and Professor Opacre grinned.  Hermione scowled lightly at the redhead while Harry merely smiled.
“You’re going straight to Pomfrey after this, right?” Hermione immediately demanded as he sat down. Harry nodded and quick as a flash, she loaded up his plate and pushed it towards him. He stared at her wide-eyed. She stared back coolly.
He stood there silently for a moment, the pleasant feelings dimming until all he could feel was his uncertainty and the near misery of Qye.
"I can't believe you're daydreaming about relaxing when you should be thinking about studying," Hermione said irritably as they approached the Potions corridor.  "The break is a great time for reviewing things and we're going to need all the time we need to study.  I hope you manage to keep yourself dedicated while I'm not here, Harry - "
Lest stood, fists at his side, his eyes flashing.  “I’m just trying to take care of you!  That’s all I’ve ever tried to do!”
:: Harry muttered to the voice and he could practically feel the other person smirk slightly.  He sighed and thought back to before the darkness.  He remembered fragments…something had been breaking…he had been in pain…potion…
“My aunt told us what happened.  One of his Muggle friends got caught up with their world, had been in midst of becoming a Carus to one of the vampires on the other side of the war.  And my cousin went, without knowing anything about what was going on or why the ceremony was put together so quickly.  Opacre ordered a hit during the middle of the commitment.  There were families there, friends like my cousin who didn’t know better, and he knowingly ordered the hit.”
’  Automatically, his eyes lifted and went straight to the Slytherin table, ready to see the sneering blond, Draco Malfoy, his rival.
Dazain blocked it, his mind slipping as usual, and flicked his hand with an attack of his own, slick and silent and as disconcerting as ever in its utter lack of feeling.
’ before she caught up with them.  He shot her an apologetic look but all she did was sniff and walk farther ahead of them.  He sighed and made a mental note to apologize more profusely later on before she really got huffy.
“ – but it’s the best we have so we’ll go with it while we can.  Any questions?” Marylin asked, looking around.  No one said anything.
He blinked when the brows above the blue eyes creased and a small frown appeared on the weathered, old face.
Qye trailed off, staring through Harry's eyes even though Harry firmly fixed his eyesight on the materials he was putting on his desk. For once, it seemed not even the younger boy had anything to say.
“We didn’t mean to make you feel guilty, Harry,” Hermione said gently. “Like we said, we’re just worried about you. You’ve been acting so differently this year and this past week…we just don’t want to lose you, Harry. We love you.” She hugged him with one arm and he silently returned the hug with one of his own arms, the other hand still holding Hermione’s.
“You are a terrible influence,” he informed the blond as he snagged his butterbeer.  “Absolutely horrible and if you do anything else, talk or no talk, we’ll see how you’ll like bouncing again, Ferret.”
And he could feel his body moving on its own accord, saw his body turn, left hand accept Lest's to get up -
The Three Broomsticks was starting to get crowded.  The only reason they had a table was the fact that they had arrived earlier due to the twins had dragging him, and subsequently Hermione, along to help with their “investigation” of Zonko’s products.  He could only be thankful that he didn’t have any remnants of said “investigation” on his body or it would be like the bloody dress robes all over again.
Harry sighed and took a small bite of mashed potatoes. His stomach protested violently as he swallowed it painfully, immediately gulping down some juice, then regretting that too. One look at Hermione’s face and he knew he couldn’t escape from this one. He sighed and stared palely down at his almost full plate.
She did not need to use her senses to know fear filled him as he stiffened and abruptly avoided the vampire’s eyes.
“Somehow, I very much doubt there’s going to be much formal dancing back there,” Draco replied, rolling his eyes.
Draco’s lips thinned every time Harry briskly finished their schoolwork and ducked away before he could be cornered.  Harry always, always found himself somewhere hidden shortly after, his magic wildly rolling within him as he tried to reign his emotions about this entire damn situation.
Harry dropped his hands, feeling oddly bereft as Draco’s hand fell away from his own.  As he turned, he tried to think of something to say after not saying anything since being tricked into a date after years of hostility and a strangely civil repertoire these months and –
Swallowing, Harry nodded hesitantly.  The vampire just continued to stare at him emotionlessly and Harry began to feel uneasy, suddenly uncomfortable with the nosferatu.  He dropped his eyes and reached for the next ingredient…
“Hello, Professor Opacre,” Alicia grinned at them as the other three alternated between blushing and smiling at them, more specifically her brother.  Marylin forced a smile and gave them a small wave.
“I don’t trust them, Severus,” Draco said quietly, his tall, lithe form tense. “I don’t trust them around him. Dumbledore trusts and listens to you so why aren’t you doing something - anything for Salazar’s sake - against them?” He shot a half-accusing look at his godfather, who scowled lightly.
“Y…yes, Professor?” the young girl said, her voice slightly high-pitched.  The girl next to her tried to subtly hold her hand – obviously meaning to reassure the blond one – and Lavender clung onto it desperately.  Marylin resisted the urge to roll her eyes or huff.
Without shame, he hunched over and cried as the Headmaster gently rubbed his back, murmuring soothing words of nothing.
Since he wanted to monitor the potion closely – both he and Qye strongly agreed they wouldn’t try it if it was even a
All week, they had said nothing about what had happened and although the Gryffindors kept to their Hermione-induced promise about not bothering him, he had seen a few suspicious glances throughout the week from other Houses that made him think
“I daresay you’ll hardly notice my presence,” he dryly said to the woman, trying to edge around her.  “The Headmaster just asked me to stop by - ”
Harry resisted every urge to open a conversation, ask him for help about vampires, tell him that he missed their times at the library tables.  He sometimes found himself absently touching his lips as he studied his notes and hastily put it down while Ron and Hermione pretended not to notice.  Well, Hermione pretended.  Ron just got a very flat look on his face and wrote his notes harder.
The vampire’s eyes widened right before the spell impacted his chest and blasted him away, Harry’s wand held steady and eyes focused at him.
“I’m glad we’re friends,” he said quietly.  His eyes flickered lost for a moment and he swallowed.  “Whatever happens just…keep doing that.”
“First he hires a vampire for a professor and now this!” Ron raged, scowling darkly at their schedules.  “It’s like he’s planning to kill us!”
Professor Opacre smiled at them both.  “Thank you,” she said quietly, inclining her head to them.  “I appreciate it.”  Malfoy just snorted but Harry grinned at her.  She smiled a bit more before turning around.
There was a moment of silence, broken only by Harry’s quiet coughs. Then a soft sigh came from Qye and Harry’s eyes fluttered as he thought he felt a feather-like touch brush across his mind, gone before he could wonder whether it had really happened or not.
Qye muttered and didn't elaborate when Harry made a curious sound. The rest of the class was again silent but this time Harry could hear a few coughs that sounded too much like cover ups. A few Slytherins weren't even bothering to hide their smirks.
“Professor Opacre?” Ron cut in before Hermione could continue her studious disapproval.  Harry looked at him to see him frowning.
Qye hissed in Harry’s mind as the air cleared and Harry narrowly stared at the male vampire in front of him, blocking him from the other who was now fending off three other vampires, kicks and punches and one armed with what looked a chain.
“I’m sorry,” he mumbled, picking at the sheets. “I…just didn’t think it was something to be worried about. I’ve never gotten sick before.”
His hand trembled as he pushed it into his hair, flashes of Professor Opacre – Myn – and her brother – Lest – flickering in his mind and the thought about what all this meant.
“What’s that?” Hermione asked, raising an eyebrow as she unabashedly placed a piece of toast on Harry’s plate.  Harry sighed loudly but said nothing.  All he would get from saying something was a glare and lecture, two things he did
Harry called out, grimacing as he watched the vampire dodge backwards, right out of the way of the spell.  The vampire flicked his hand and Harry jerked, his body twitching, his arm painfully jarred –
“Are you two fighting again?” a new voice laughed behind them.  Ron and Hermione immediately stopped fighting and blushed while Harry grinned in recognition.  They turned around and saw a smiling Professor Opacre.
As the day wore on, Harry began to become unconvinced as well. The feverish heat surrounding him seemed to grow with each passing hour and the world spun and danced, occasionally causing him to lose his balance and stumble slightly. He managed to pass it all off as tripping but Ron didn’t look too convinced when he bumped into him as they stood in Care of Magical Creatures.
“Show us what?” Sirius snapped, clenching and unclenching his hands.  “Can someone please just give us a straight answer as to what the hell is going on?”
Draco snorted.  “Clearly you weren’t listening to the same overprotective message I was.”  He shook his head.  “I almost feel a little sorry for the littlest redhead if that was any indication of how they treat people who - ” He stopped and cleared his throat.
Smethwyck shifted in the background and he remembered how the man had stood staring with a lost look in his eyes for a long time after they had explained what they had done.  The Healer eventually nodded and left without saying a word and came back the next day doing his same work without complaint, rubbing his temples as if he had a headache and flinching from the lights in the room.
"At last!" I hear everyone saying. XD I just want to take a moment to thank everyone who's taken time to read this story.  It means a lot to me and I wish I could give you all a hug.  Instead, I hope you all have wonderful days up ahead! <3
"Getting a bit aggressive, are we now?" he smirked. Hermione glared at him and she raised her hand, opening her mouth. Before she could utter her next spell, Lest finally unfolded his arms and sighed, shaking his head. "Considering your style, I think we're done. And I don't think you want to see me laughing, Ms. Granger, so I suggest not using that Tickling Charm. "
"Well, good!" Hermione said sunnily.  She beamed at him. "I'm so glad we've cleared that up. We should talk more often."
"My uncle," Harry murmured. "So, um, thanks for the lift, but I can take it from here." He hefted the heavy trunk and started to walk towards the door. To his surprise, Snape continued to walk with him.
"I think it's dangerous," he said. "She could betray me. But Draco would be furious if she did, and I think that matters to her. And she couldn't do anything with him nearby, because he'd try to help me, and she wouldn't want him hurt, you said. What do you think? She said you knew her well and would agree that she, um, 'values the laws of hospitality.'"
"I apologize for not coming to your assistance.  Cabot stepped out after getting a memo, and I turned back into a Body Bind."  The voice was deep and hard. "You know how good Richard is at non-verbal spells."
She stepped back, coyly teasing, as she pushed ineffectually at her trouser waistband. "Do you want to fuck me, Harry?
She shook her head. "And you seem so nice!" she quipped. "Have you asked Horace Slughorn? He keeps in touch with everybody."
"Oh." With what of his brain still worked, he remembered that he needed to act like this was normal. That didn't seem as burdensome as it ought to be. "
"Tell me what you're thinking of," he whispered, as if they weren't surrounded by his housemates, and Harry had a sudden feeling of dark weight, as if a storm had settled over them. His answer, he knew, would be terribly important.
Harry bit his lip. This shirt might just have become his favorite. "Thank you," he said, and Draco smiled.
Harry had planned to look for Draco after his conference, but there was no need. When he stepped out of McGonagall's office, Draco pushed off from the opposite wall of the corridor. "Shall we walk?" he said, by way of greeting.
people had left the common room, but Seamus and Parvati and Ron and Sajid were still there, and worse yet, Hermione was there, and she looked up from her book even before Harry climbed through the portrait hole.
"Because your family were rough," Draco replied at a quick mutter. "But anyway--" he began, more loudly.
Eugene shrugged. "I just didn't find it worth it, honestly. I'm not that interested in being pretty."
Draco's first thought was to keep the meeting in a public space, but he immediately realized that he wouldn't get any information that way. He would just have to stay alert and improvise. He wouldn't mind a little groping, he decided, picturing how Potter's eyes smoldered when they fought. Much more than that, and he was risking the polyjuice wearing off, anyway. He'd just cut his losses and run, if he had to.
Snape settled into his chair again, steepling his hands in front of his chin. "Noted," he said tartly. "I suggest you make good use of your
"Oh," she said, staring at the shadowy forms and lifting an arm experimentally, "a mirror."  Her mouth twisted into a scowl. Harry shrugged and led her between two doors to side rooms, and straight up to the glass.
Harry nodded. Stuffing his new beads into his pocket, he pulled his school bag out from under the sofa. "Right. Let's go."
"There was a more limited one to make a ghost do one specific thing -- it's not much use; you can only cast it once per ghost, but I used it to command Moaning Myrtle to not tell on us, and afterwards, I was wild with it."
Harry blinked. Were they talking about the same thing? He didn't think he had been subtle. "Er. I don't think that would work with clothes on."
Snape looked around at the nearly empty space, but did not comment on it. "I wished to talk to you," he said baldly. "Why else would I arrange to be the person who escorted you home?"
Harry rubbed up against him. He wasn't so sore after all.  It was hardly noticeable under the effect that Draco was having on him as he rocked into him, back, and in again. Draco's loose trousers were intended to be worn under robes, and didn't hold much in. "I am, am I?"
McGonagall nodded briskly. "We have other things to discuss, such as scheduling and workload, but I have a class arriving. Devise a more detailed proposal, please, including a schedule that will not hamper your other activities, and bring it to me during my regular office hours."
Draco smirked. "Not for the physical world," he said. "But it can help with otherworldly focus, especially in the proper preparations. By itself, it isn't good for much, and it can be dangerous."
“It was just a thought,” Sirius said haltingly, now unsure of how much they said, wondering if they had overstepped.  “I didn’t…of course if you seemed happy at your relatives’ - ”
"Do not fight him," Ron muttered, glaring at him. Harry stared and Ron pointed a finger at him threateningly. "I mean it, I'll tell my Mum all sorts of things so that you'll be mothered until you'll want to
’ She mentally shook her head and gave up.  Whatever it was about this boy didn’t matter at the moment.  She had other things to worry about and besides, she had the rest of the year to figure out what it was about this boy that made her mind tingle.
The door from Snape's office flew open and Harry ended his train of thought as the Potions Master swept into the room.  Taking roll quickly, he turned to the blackboard and tapped his wand on it, instructions appearing quickly.  He turned back to the class, his dark, black eyes glittering.
Qye cried out and Harry’s vision blurred as the hand tightened, his hands clenching and clawing while the feeling in his legs grew distant and he became aware of them trying to kick the vampire off.
The sickness rolled Harry’s stomach again and he swallowed heavily, leaning forward and breathing fast and deep.
He gave her a rueful smile.  “Just realized people outside of Gryffindor are bound to ask questions today after last night and I doubt they’ll be as considerate to back off.  Think I’m just going to hide out until the worst of the gossip dies down.”
he thought fuzzily and coughed. He blinked and slowly started lifting himself up. He winced as his left shoulder protested the movement and used his right hand to rub it as he knelt on the floor, his left hand supporting him.
In the same style that had fallen Ron, the trinkets from Professor Opacre's desk zoomed towards him.
“When I call your name, sit next to your partner.  These seats will be for the rest of the year and are non-negotiable under any circumstances.  Now,” Snape said, smiling even more unpleasantly, “Let’s begin.”
“You never asked!” Harry said exasperatedly, eyes flashing.  “All you did was tell me to say yes and then to meet you here and damn it, Malfoy, what exactly is - ”
“Only one has a scar,” she said absently and sighed as she pulled back.  She turned back to Dumbledore, finally lowering her wand.  “And his…their?”  She stumbled and shook her head before continuing.  “The magical field, I have never seen fluctuations like this before.  One moment, its past anything I’ve ever recorded from him before, other times it is as though he is no more than a Muggle.  It doesn’t stay stable with either of the two.  What spell did you say hit him?”
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, staring listlessly at his bed.  Seamus and Neville slowly started to let go of his arms as Ron held on, waiting to see what he would do next.  “I’m sorry, I didn’t…I’m sorry.”  He shivered and Ron saw him close his eyes.  “I’m sorry, please don’t…I’m sorry.”
Jonas stood frozen, mind stuttering while his mouth hung open with the words he was about to shout gone from his lips.  His eyes slowly trailed to the bed the chair was angled towards and saw that the other occupant of the room was still asleep, in the same position Jonas had left him in.
“See?” Seamus exclaimed, pointing right at them.  “That, that right there!”  He looked around at the others.  “I’m not the only one wondering about this here, right?”
“They just want what’s normal,” Harry said, staring out the window as Qye flung a ball Smethwyck had given him for his exercises.  Harry didn’t remember throwing it at the wall as part of the Healer’s instructions but fortunately enough, it was just bouncy enough to withstand the abuse.  “It’s what they know.  It’s safe.”
“Poor Harry,” Voldemort breathed, raising his wand.  “You would think you would have learned your lesson after last year.”  He glanced towards their group, a cruel smile growing.  “Would you like to see how your brave student fared the Cruciatus Curse, Dumbledore?”
.  A picture of the blackened and smashed shops found in the wizarding mall, a little ways off from London, showed exactly how destructive a small team of Death Eaters was.  Especially in a crowded place, during the busiest hour of the day for the mall.  The article went on to explain how many casualties were just ordinary citizens who had presumed the mall safe with all its wards and guards.  It even went on to suggest that perhaps Fudge was not the man capable of protecting the wizarding world through these ‘troubling times.’
“Maybe I’m just tired of waiting,” Qye snapped, stalking back to his bed and dropping down on it.  “Maybe I just want to prove - ”
“You were lucky,” his voice spoke, low and hard and cold.  “Harry spared you.  I would’ve let Black and Lupin kill you.”
The room lurched, his brain pounding against his skull.  His eyes felt like they were too small for his vision, tightening and watering.  Everything he could see was shaking and blurred, like seeing things in two different ways, with two different visions.  Pain flashed through his eyes again, causing a couple of tears to crawl down his face.  Whimpering, he shut his eyes quickly and tightly, curling up into a ball on whatever he was on.
“I think your idea is completely insane,” Lest said dryly. “But I’ll do it. It’ll be an interesting way to see if you managed to make these children unafraid of us.”
“Severus, what is going on?” Remus said slowly, uncertainly, looking back and forth between the Potions Master and the vampire woman.
“What’s all this about then?” he grinned widely, looking over at Harry and the Slytherin next to him.
“Sorry?” he asked politely, looking up at the tall man. Gods, it was such a pain to not act like himself.
“Harry, maybe you should really see Pomfrey if you haven’t been getting any sleep,” Hermione said quietly.  Harry glanced up at her and was relieved to see the hurt gone from her eyes.  Now the brown eyes only shone with concern, and he sighed.
He snapped its neck effortlessly, ignoring the heightened screams, just in time to see another run past him.
' immediately, thinking if Lest couldn't hear the spells, he'd be less likely to respond. Unfortunately, the muffling spell seemed as effective as Hermione's initial spells. He lost the duel the minute he shouted '
“Barbarian,” Hermione muttered, taking one of the Peppermint Toothflosses. Harry looked at them bemusedly.
The classroom continued to buzz around them, the Boy-Who-Lived and Opacre’s brother, unaware of the growing tension between the teenager and vampire.  The students continued to whisper quietly among themselves as the green-eyed boy and blue-eyed vampire stared at each other.  The Slytherins and Gryffindors chattered, unbeknownst to them that a pivotal moment of the future of their world was taking place.
Remus stared at her, fighting the urge to join in with the rumble of a growl growing in Sirius as the dog slowly began to walk in front of them, his head turning to keep an eye on the vampire as he made his way to the waiting carriage for the castle.
“I still shouldn’t go,” Sirius whispered, looking up at him with red-rimmed eyes.  “I should be here, until it’s done, I haven’t had a chance to talk with him – with them,” he fumbled, awkwardly correcting himself as he roughly rubbed at his eyes.  “I should be here when it’s done just in case - ”
Dean shrugged, carefully not looking at the vampire.  “I don’t know,” he replied just as quietly, pushing around his mashed potatoes thoughtfully.  “Could be…I mean, I know Lupin was nice and all but he wasn’t a blood-sucking monster.”
In the courtroom, Harry watched Severus Snape stalk out onto the floor. The man looked like a vampire in a Muggle suspense flick. Harry felt his stomach clench. He leaned toward Draco.
He wasn't the only one to send Ginny a sharp look, Harry noticed, but no one had disagreed. Now people were glancing around -- looking, he thought, for the person who might speak first.  He decided it might as well be him.
Self-consciously, Harry began with his talk with Ron, and then went on to his meeting with the team, and Hermione's intrusion on the brewing session. By the time he got to his confession to Hermione, he was lying with his head in Draco's lap, and Draco was stroking his hair, his eyes half-closed.
A Ravenclaw sixth-year named Jonathan, who had managed to get into the Cursebreaking class through some arrangement with Flitwick, looked curiously over at them, but then went back to setting out his notes. Harry could see a large sketch of the Pensieve at the top of the page. Beyond him, Blaise was staring down at an empty parchment.
That was enough. Malfoy tumbled eagerly off the couch, and a moment later was as Harry had suggested, Harry's cock in his mouth -- a lot deeper than Harry had managed on his -- and his nipples, indeed, showing behind the forward drape of his top.
Draco nodded again and rubbed his head against Harry. Laughing, Harry stood.  "All right. Turn left."
He nodded. "Probably true. I think you would have heard if he'd died, since I gather it would have a demoralizing effect on my counterpart." He looked around. "Do Draco and Sirius still visit?"
He sat and practiced looking attentive and well-behaved until the food arrived, at which point he gave up and ate.
She nodded. "Somehow. I've heard there's a six month course that would take years to reverse...." Trailing off, she shrugged. "I'm still researching, though. Now why do you care? If, as you claim, you
She rubbed her face. "Of course. The Ministry hasn't figured it out in seven or eight years, but you will." She softened the sarcasm with a loving smile. Harry just nodded.
Ruthven and Gloria seemed to be childhood friends, and they were happily playing Exploding Snap with the brothers when Harry left to meet Ron and Hermione. Past the mirror, the wall lines were already glowing. Harry set a password on the door behind him and moved toward the sound of low voices. His friends were sitting on opposite ends of the couch, facing each other. Ron lifted from his slouch at the sight of Harry.
"I understand the concern," he said finally.  "Draco, you and I should discuss it privately. Does anyone else object if we decide to say yes?"
interests me," Harry retorted, "and don't you dare say it shouldn't." He pushed ahead, unwilling to listen. "Oh, Sirius, I met another cousin of yours -- an Auror, you wouldn't know her--"
"Oh, you know how Voldemort is. He couldn't just curse me; he wanted drama. What good is a basilisk if you don't use it?"
Ginny Weasley had, as it turned out, caught the Snitch, which would have upset Draco more had it not left ample time for walking in the rose garden with Harry. He decided to blame residue of magical substances for the way gentle kisses turned to frotting against each other under the cover of an arbor until they both needed cleaning charms. Despite that indiscretion, he was pleased to find the conversation similarly enjoyable -- and almost as natural.
Breakfast hadn't arrived yet, so Draco, with a brush of his hand along Harry's shoulder, left to talk to other people in the room.  Harry tried not to watch him. When Dumbledore stood at the head of the table, cleared his throat, and asked for people to take their seats, Harry was surprised to see Draco speaking to McGonagall. He was perhaps less surprised to see him passing back a section of the
"Honestly!" Malfoy exclaimed. "Your hair! Go and freshen up. Everyone knows what we do all night; there's no need to
She shook her head. "I was careful. And I sent three other people to different locations, and I looked back with a mirror spell after the first corner. But it's all taken time, so do hurry, Harry!"
"Oh, let me help," Parvati said, jumping up, and making Harry feel rather foolish for not having thought of that himself.
Harry pushed away his tea, sloshing it over the saucer and part of the table. He stood. "Dobby!" he called.
As soon as Snape left, Harry followed, cutting over to the back stair to avoid Slytherins heading to or from the dungeons. He would see a few of Hufflepuffs along this route, but they were likely to assume he was going to meet Malfoy, or even that it wasn't their business. Hufflepuffs were good that way.
"Mr. Potter." His head lowered, either in respect, or to avoid Legilimency. Harry could hear his heart racing, but the stink of fear and unwashed human overpowered anything else scent might have told him.
Draco, however, cocked his head to the side, rather in the way that Cheefi was doing. "It could," he offered.
"Very well," she said. "I have never taken a lover -- in the broadest sense, just romance and just sex both count -- whom I felt to be inadequate."
"Yeah, I was offended! Would you have dove for Weasley if he was falling off his broom?" she asked sarcastically.
Dumbledore's head came up sharply. For a moment, he was silent. Finally, he sighed. "True. It was not my intent to create that association. I had grown used to them; they happened to be close at a time when I was alarmed. Do sit, Harry."
"Want me to get dressed and come out and show you?" he offered, even while he stroked down the firm curve of one cheek.  Draco demonstrated his enjoyment by rocking against the mattress, and Harry found himself up on his knees over him, Draco's moving arse in a two-hand hold.  He squeezed the cheeks together and then let them part, stroking his thumbs down between them. Draco writhed under his thighs.
Harry readied himself to stop Ron's derisive retort, but Ron just let out a shaky breath and nodded. "Yeah. Okay. That would get in the way."
The twin on his left -- Fred, he thought, though he'd lost track when they moved -- laughed. "Quite right."
"That's okay. Just stay." Harry reached out to take his hand. "Like that night in Gryffindor," he whispered.
A familiar giggle came from the drain in the floor. Harry jerked back. Moaning Myrtle shot out of the drain in a silver blur.
"Good. I am going to ask you some questions about your encounter with Sirius Black in June of 1994. Do you agree that this is why you are here?"
"Want to go someplace else?" Ron offered, and Harry warmed with affection, despite knowing he couldn't accept.
A quick trot up the circular stairs, and they were alone in their dormitory. Harry cast a spell to detect body heat, just to be sure.
"If I may have your attention, please," Dumbledore said clearly. "For the benefit of those not familiar with the structure of this type of hearing, I would like to review the basic schedule.  Today, it is our turn to select and question witnesses. That may continue until the end of the day. After that, they may question our witnesses, and we may question theirs. After that, the Inquisitors will begin direct questioning, and at the end of that, both sides will be allotted a certain time, at young Mr.  Cabot's discretion, for final statements, and possibly, additional testimony.  After that stage concludes, they will deliver a verdict, and we will continue on to Mr. Talbot. We must remember that today's testimony is on the matter of Lucius Malfoy's actions only."
Hermione's skirts rustled as she sat down on the other end of the window seat. Harry looked over at her. She had pinned up only the front of her unruly hair, and wisps of it hung loose by her ears. He looked away.
, just that it wouldn't compromise war secrets. What if they wanted to ask about Dark Arts, or illegal activities at school, or something like that? Would she let him say he couldn't answer that? "Why do you need Veritaserum at all?"
Harry didn't think anyone else took notice of the little glance Draco gave him at the end, but it made his gut twist. Draco
"Sorry, but yes. When anything is afraid of you, you're terrified of what that says about who you are. You need to belittle them into insignificance."
wasn't enough trouble in itself, he had to go fall for someone studious, who got distracted by schoolwork.
Draco had stopped short at the corridor. Harry tugged on his arm to get him moving again. "And I read the first three chapters, all right? Just like he said. But it might as well have been Gobbledygook, for all the sense it made."
"What? I'm not embarrassed." Harry looked up at Ron, who was wide-eyed and clearly horrified. "Sorry you asked?" he asked tartly. His heart was hammering. Draco would have to go ahead with it now -- maybe even tonight -- because Seamus, at least, was sure to ask.
"Gryffindor insanity, you mean!" Draco huffed. "You had an advantageous position -- which you worked at diligently, I might add -- and you threw it away for no
, yes. I can make no complaint as to the logistics." Snape lifted his head. "One of the Aurors helped with carrying my books."
"I know." The professor's first diagnostic spell shot up and down Draco's body, tingling along Harry's arms.
"You!" she shrieked, but with a touch of desperation, as soon as she spotted him on the steps. "Tell this man to leave immediately!" Her face tightened. "And put that
; it just seems vulgar, now that it comes to it. I'm not a dancing girl."  Draco sighed. "I don't suppose you brought any of that cognac down?"
"I think...." Draco twisted back for a kiss. He settled again. "I think I'll believe that." His voice dropped still further. "I think this might even become ... more."
"And some idiot schoolboy took you dry?" Harry demanded. He started to work around the area again, intentionally not pushing in yet.
Harry squirmed back up the bed, alarmed, but Malfoy didn't try to follow him. Instead he moved away. At least, Harry
Snape was conservative in his timing, and members of the Wizengamot were still trailing in when they reached the enclosure for the defense. Draco had his head lowered in a sullen manner that Harry recognized all too well. He jumped when Harry slipped in beside him.
"Attack you," he answered. "Go around you."  From her expression, he obviously wasn't giving the answer she wanted. "Oh.  Dark Arts?" That made him feel better, although he knew it probably shouldn't. It was easier to think about than emotional complications. "You should probably make me go see the Quiris with you, then, at the beginning of next term, which will be as soon as I can, if I don't do anything else."
"Right, except it's not that hypothetical anymore.  They're making good money. I get reports, and anyway, I see their wares around Hogwarts."
They moved into the shadow of an alley, and Harry counted out galleons. Blaise shifted uneasily as he watched.
"Oh?" She blinked. "How surprising," she said, with apparent equilibrium. "It's so hard to tell about people; don't you think so?"
"I know, but I'd still like to try for the N.E.W.T.  I couldn't resist the Cursebreaking class, though, and it
Snape shot him an amiably contemptuous glance. "You are not a Slytherin, so I have no reason to care.  Furthermore, you are a Gryffindor, so I doubt I am distracting from anything but creative procrastination."
"If you don't mind? It almost feels like it's ending already, though I know it's not really over until June. But this would be our last time to be ... well, just us."
"I'm dropping Care of Magical Creatures," Harry said, glad to be talking about something safe. "And I'd better tell Hagrid before someone else does -- first thing tomorrow probably."
"Oh, are we including single dates? That seems a bit much." Harry crossed his arms in a mirror of her pose. "And you'd need to take one too, as I don't believe for a moment that you thought
Draco, from where he was sitting on the bed, finally recovered enough composure to glare. "Oh?" he asked sweetly. "Do you think the school library has sex manuals?"
"Not abysmal," Snape said. Harry thought that terribly unfair, unless he'd got something wrong. "It is at least clear that you read the source. However, I can tell by your sudden demonstration of a precise vocabulary that you are largely reciting what you have read." His face tightened in disapproval as he focused on Harry. "In your own words, please."
The first thing Snape did was to write "Tureen soup, two bowls, one cup" on the slate by the door, an amenity that Harry had forgotten. That settled, he transfigured his trunk into a chair, floated it over to another chair of unknown origin, and motioned Harry to sit. Harry leaned against the back of it, instead.
That made sense, although he still wanted to argue with the word "abused." He had noticed, when he was at the Burrow, that if Ron, or the twins, or Ginny was being punished for something, it was always for something that they had actually
"Where's Ron?" Hermione asked, as Harry joined her at breakfast on Sunday. She looked like she was almost finished with hers.
That was perceptive enough to set Harry back for a moment. He took a swallow of the tea, unsweetened. "We're working on it."
"Gryffindors are bold about it," Eugene corrected, settling at Malfoy's other foot. He glanced at Harry. "Watch."
Other sounds became loud in the absence of words: Harry's breathing, long with control, and Draco's, growing quicker and higher; the whisper of skin on skin; the unmistakable squelch of wetter contact. Harry wondered if Draco's prick would make as vulgar a sound pumping in and out of a girl, in the properly romantic breeding union.
is not repeatable." Clearing her throat, she pushed the second strand at him.  "Very well, Harry. I find your explanation -- scant as it was -- sufficient. You may go -- but do continue to spend adequate time on your class work between games. "
"Oh." Harry glanced at Linnet, who had the grace to look abashed. He supposed that explained the woman who had defended her, as well.
They started to walk again, angling over to the lake, this time. "That doesn't make any sense to me, you know. But I am taking Symbology, this year."
The kiss had all the force that was missing from his other motions, and Harry pulled him down to make it closer. Draco wouldn't climb on top, pulling insistently until they were both on their sides.  Unexpectedly, he twisted away, pressing his back to Harry.
"That's a lot of dye," Creevy explained. "Colin uses it, of course -- that's how I knew the abbreviation right off. But he's never bought more than five galleons' worth at a time."
"That's different, though. You're a boy." Hermione blushed. "I mean, a lot of boys grow out of that." She groaned. "Ignore me. I can't believe I said that." She bit her lip. "I just don't see what-- see anything that could be appealing about her."
The force of his grab spun both of them around, and the heavy fabric pulled out of Harry's hand, but not before it had turned from blue to crimson.  Malfoy stared after him. Before the shock on his face could fully turn to anger, the dragon closed one set of padded metal claws around his shoulder and another around his thigh. Malfoy shrieked. Like an augmented echo, the crowd below screamed in panic. Flapping its great wings, the dragon began to rise.
"To make it easier to buy alcohol, last year. We're not old enough even now, by Muggle laws, and he thought a fake ID would be safer than Confundus or aging potion."
Potter seemed to feel any overt threats unnecessary. For one wonderful moment, it looked like he would just leave. Then, hand on the doorknob, he turned.
"I don't really have any other options, do I?"  he asked bitterly. "It's not like I'll put you under Imperius."
The passage was already lit when Harry arrived. Draco didn't turn. He had a series of short branches, each leaning on the next, at the back of the sideboard, which was draped in a linen cloth that didn't quite extend to the ends. As he tapped one branch, it put forth pink buds. Behind it, the buds of another were opening into the blushing white blossoms of an apple tree in spring.
Dean's rat, now on the bedspread, raised its back and rattled its tail, producing an uncharacteristic hiss from Susara.
Draco had apparently let go of him, because Harry was somehow in Sirius’s arms, and Sirius’s joyous laughter breaking into hard sobs, his face wet against Harry’s shoulder, and Remus was there too, a hand below Harry’s, rubbing Sirius's back. The others were silent. After a few rough gasps, Sirius pushed back and wiped at his face. He tried to laugh, coughing instead. He turned away and blew his nose.
"If it's all this good, I'll be begging you to do this," Harry returned, and Draco cried out and sped up his thrusts. He pushed Harry forward and rolled on top of him, pinning him against the hard mattress.
Heads twitched behind her affirmative reply. Two of the boys whispered to each other. Her friend Ogden, lingering at the back, was silent.
"Unintentional, I assure you." Snape looked like he might actually mean it. "About your arrangements with Lupin...." he began. Harry raised his eyebrows, and Snape's mouth twitched at one corner. "Well done."
Harry tried, in Parseltongue, as Draco's target clanged to the floor. The snakes had all unraveled from their ornate knot, and were advancing menacingly.  They paused at his command, raised heads wavering uncertainly side to side, but then slowly began to descend. The fastest one resumed its approach. Harry glanced at Draco, who jerked his head to the side. Understanding, Harry began to back into the center of the room, while Draco retreated along the wall. That caused a little more head waving, and they both got off another Petrifaction hex. The problem was, there were a lot of cobras, and their uncertainty lasted only a moment. Each serpent -- darkened bronze with streaks of verdigris -- slipped across the floor towards one or the other of them. Seeing one aimed for him twining through two snakes headed towards Draco, Harry tried a Corrosion hex.
"That's my American collection," the professor said, darting up beside him. "The majority are Mayan, from Mexico or near it, but I have a few Aztec pieces that are a little more challenging. We're going to start looking at those -- well, the Mayan ones -- in February."
“M...Malfoy?!” he repeated incredulously.  She smiled and nodded, turning briskly back into her office.  He stared after her for a moment, then shook his head and left the Infirmary.
“…and we wouldn’t mind giving Malfoy here a preview of what exactly his Galleons are paying for,” the other twin finished.
?  Do you figure I could get away with getting Fred or George to slip me some Firewhiskey to burn that memory away?”
Lest crashed onto his back as Qye made another strike for him, barely blocking his arm with his own, face raw and uncertain.
About an hour later, after Pomfrey checked him over again and turned off the lights, he continued to stare up.
Harry snorted silently.  Prepare, indeed.  Ever since he had left the Infirmary, he had to deal with having Qye inside his head around other people.  It had taken him a couple of days to control his shivers whenever the other boy had felt the sudden urge to flip through his life.  (He remembered one particular incident where he had been half-asleep at the breakfast table, sitting next to a first-year Hufflepuff, when his new companion had decided to find out more about the Houses.  After managing to find a pitiful excuse for his jerk, he had offered to buy the poor girl a new sweater.)
“Somehow,” Remus sighed as he pulled the bottle of Firewhiskey away from his friend, capping it and putting it on the table next to the couch as he watched Sirius take another large swallow from his glass, “I don’t think he has quite that much influence with the Wizengamot or our new interim Minister yet.”
“I’ve got nothing,” Ron said in an undertone, too tired to bicker as they slowly made their way back to the group.  “Hermione’s flames are independent but I don’t think they’ll stop them for long and they do nothing against their telepathy.”
“Yes!” he half-shouted.  “Two gits in one year!  No more bloody Slytherins!” Ron grinned at Harry and he forced a grin back at his red-haired friend.
Running from overgrown spiders and being knocked about by large chess pieces wasn't the same as dueling with a thinking, planning, war-experienced vampire. Giving Lest a sidelong glance, in case he might have overheard Ron's comment in the quiet of the classroom, he saw the vampire still looking nonchalantly at the bristling students.
At first, he had only flipped through the book, reading a couple of sentences on a page before moving to another page.  With each word he read, his head pulsed in a way that wasn't unpleasant but wasn't exactly the best of things to feel.  He supposed it was because he felt guilty for reading another person's private thoughts but that feeling had quickly left as he read more and more about them.
Harry said nothing, still staring into the room.  The voice was Qye, the mysterious person he had been reading about all November.  How much of a coincidence was it that after a month of learning about him the boy had found his way into his head?  And after taking a potion on the subconscious…he wouldn’t be surprised if he had thoughts about Qye in there.
"One of the telepathic tools vampires employ is Videte," she explained. "Basically, my brother used his mind to enhance his vision so he could 'see' things that aren't in his immediate line of vision. It's not something many vampires can do and those that can
“Well,” he drawled, leaning back in his chair and looking at her calmly.  “One of the most known things about vampires is that they’re immortal.  Is that true?”
There was suddenly a great stillness and he paused, turning to look as a low green light streamed through the high windows of the Great Hall.
On the inside, Harry was shaking with revulsion over what he had done.  His hands shook slightly as he set up his cauldron and he could feel his insides writhe with shame.  How could he have done something like that?  As he finished setting everything up, he dropped his elbows on the table and covered his face with his hands, feeling weak and disoriented.
