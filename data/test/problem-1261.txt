Everyone else was sitting. He should sit too. Hermione and Ron were going over their notes and coaching Hagrid through the kind of things he should and shouldn’t say in front of the Wizengamot.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco must have paused too long, trying to determine the right balance between a sharp retort and something that Potter would deem funny because Potter bristled, “You don’t have to say anything if it’s top secret.”
“Probably,” Hermione answered. “Since your Modus Operandi has been to avoid this whole situation.”
Potter jumped. “Yes, but I’ve never--”
"What?"
That--that was his response? Snape?
"Find a mirror," Malfoy grinned, snatching the quill off the floor and twisting it between his fingers. Harry looked in the foe-glass, because why not, and saw the words "git" and "prat" scrawled on his face, sometimes complete and sometimes in pieces, wherever he'd been able to smack the quill away quickly enough.
Draco clenched the edges of his desk. “”What do you want, Potter?”
"I'm not a patient person," Harry shrugged. "It's one of my very few flaws. But. You got my letter."
Malfoy turned his look on Pansy.
Draco straightened his tie and eyed his reflection in the mirror. Nearly flawless. There was a scar, now, that cut through one of his eyebrows. It gave the boy--the man?--in the reflection an unsteady gaze. He held one hand across that side of his face. The stare looked more haughty, more sure. An illusion of traveling back in time.
Harry grimaced. His hands were at his side now, but his hair looked a mess. "You heard right. But if you want to pretend that everything I just said was part of the weirdness of today, you can. I can't... half the reason I haven't said anything until now is because I can't afford to lose you, and neither can the kids."
Potter’s shoulders eased. Draco knew he’d be able to talk about the girl. “She’s fine for now. McGonagall wasn’t exactly thrilled that I’d put Occlumency on the curriculum for the first year students.”
“Did they actually say--” Pansy snatched at Hermione’s robe. “Did they say?"
“No.”
Potter made eye contact with Draco, and Draco gave a quick nod. Potter leaned close to the girl and whispered. She nodded. There was a stream of blood running from one of her nostrils, and she wiped a hand across it, smearing the stain across her face. Potter took her by the other hand and led her from the room.
Harry’s shoulders curled and his head dropped into a bow, and the silence in the room thickened.
Harry closed his eyes. "I just can't think right now. Every time I try to get to an answer about that question, I get just as sidetracked as I did when we talked. I know that Hermione would be able to tell me an answer. Ron probably would, too. Anyone probably could tell me a good answer, but I can't tell myself anything."
“What was that about?” Pansy asked. “You look like you’ve seen a ghost. A scary one.”
*** *** ***
“I know he’s thick,” Granger frowned. “But I’m sure he was trying to give it back to you.  What did he do?”
"To save me?" Draco frowned, realizing his wand was still in the pocket of his coat, up on the bridge. It was going to be a long slog up there, but the girl was right--it wasn't going to get any easier as they got colder. He managed to kneel. "I jumped in to save you."
It wasn't what Harry had been expecting to say. He wasn't sure what he'd been expecting to say.
Harry chuckled. “For a moment there, I thought you were trying to comfort me.”
“Such as?”
Neville glanced up. “On my bed? I have enough of sitting and studying at desks in my actual classes. This makes me feel much more relaxed.” He continued on, probably happily dripping ink all over his sheets.
"But you kept the cloak?"
"You what?" Draco said, looking around to see if there were other glasses with beverages, hopefully something strong and burning. "I'm sorry, I've been having a very strange evening. I think Lockhart went poking around in my head. It sounded like you just said that you were sort of in love with me."
She sat, but not before smirking at Draco in a way that felt all too obvious.
When the house elf stepped back to find Potter, Draco pushed his way into the house and down the hall. Harry wouldn't mind, not if it was about a kid in crisis.
Draco didn’t say anything. He couldn’t even think of the words to say what was playing through his mind right now. Slytherin prank wars and snowball fights. Slytherin cram sessions before finals. There had been ugliness beyond the telling, but the green and silver warm haven in the stone dungeons had been
"But you are, too. You're the one who helps them face themselves."
"Put them in the safe," George instructed Draco. "With some mood music. And a duplication charm, if you can swing it."
Hermione inclined her head. “True. Then would you like to do the honors?”
Harry took off, only to hear Draco whining at his elbow, "Why do you always want to run everywhere?"
Of all the--Draco’s eyes bulged. “Potter. My bleeding Patronus is a doe. I made it after you took me with you on the holidays. I stood in front of first-years that hated me because you asked me to.” He could stop there. That would be fine. “I made buttons about how you stink when we were in fourth year! I got Snape to teach me Occlumency so no one could figure out how I felt. I’m still angry that you didn’t want to be friends with me first year! How was I supposed to come to the conclusion that you had any interest in me?”
Draco made eye contact with Ron, who was standing behind Harry, eyes wide. In all the many ways he’d pictured this happening, Ronald Weasley had never been standing behind Harry, looking shocked.
Harry closed his eyes, he had the strangest feeling, as if someone had cast a spell over him that made him feel more solid.
And all we lost
Draco started laughing again, and Harry found himself smiling. This was possibly a very Harry thing to do while waiting to have some tense emotional conversation. Defense Against the Dark Piles of Unsorted Junk.
“I knew it!” Johnson grinned at Potter. “I knew he’d agree to be your boyfriend!”
From his position at the other end of the table, Potter stood up.
He leaned over and whispered in Draco's ears, and it might have come out as sort of a growl because he was feeling pretty highly stressed.
The two of them watched him warily for the rest of class, even though all Draco did was walk from student to student and prompt them to think about their thoughts. When the class period had ended, Potter hadn’t returned, and Draco waved the students out of the room, trying not to overhear Sam saying something about letting Death Eaters supervise.
Oh. Of course he had. “Did you ever think about playing Quidditch. Professionally, I mean?"
Harry stood up, joints cracking like an old person’s. “Merlin it’s late. We should get some sleep. Thanks for waiting up, Draco.”
“I will that the bathroom door open.”
If the hug had come as a surprise, what came next made Draco sag against the piano weakly.
Harry leaned close, but missed Draco's face, instead leaning over his ear. "Thank you, Draco. You make my life so much richer."
George grinned widely. “It was all a laugh, wasn’t it, Harry? Wanted to see how people would react.”
"Fine, I’ll go," Draco rushed. "I just have to know if you and Teddy are okay."
George had been absorbed in counting the till, and he looked up to Draco and Harry with his wild-light eyes. "We've got the galleons we owe, and get this." He lifted up a knut and a sickle. "Some left over!"
“Take it,” Potter urged. “Try.”
The house elf stopped short of the dining room. "Stay here," he snapped. "Do not be invading Master Potter's space."
Draco ruffled his curls. "Fifteen minutes early isn't late, Malfoy. Relax, okay."
One or two evenings a week that, apparently, kept Potter sane. And drove Draco insane. Not because of the kids, although they were a handful. No. The insanity came from Potter. From the fact that front-page spreads of him pushing his toddler charges in a pram didn't make Draco feel sick anymore. Or not the same sort of sick. Instead, they caused a painful shot of longing through his chest. Potter had always seemed so perfect--twirling through life winning things and rescuing people. But now he was real. He sagged against the doors when they'd got the last kid into bed and cursed when he stepped in something wet and unidentified in the kitchen.
Draco’s stomach started to churn. Why was he the only one who could see how terrible of an idea this was? The only one who could picture himself sneering at the table while the Weasleys exchanged god-awful knit objects.
The other three were already trying to convince the first year students to step back so Lacey could breathe, but Draco was afraid that wasn’t enough. If Lacey transformed entirely, there’d be no holding her back, and there was no way of knowing who she’d hurt. He made eye contact with Ron. “Farther away. We need to clear out this area.”
Ron looked significantly less enthusiastic than Potter, but he was the one who spoke. “I’ve just heard back from my mother,” he offered. “And she said it was alright with her. So. You’re officially invited to the Burrow for Christmas this year.”
Potter held a hand out toward the door and it swung open before he could touch it. The two walked in and were greeted by a common room not unlike the Slytherin common room, except that the color scheme was all in shades of black and white.
She had the look in her eye that Draco associated with her punching him in the face. It burned just to look at her. She radiated determination and power. And this, Draco realized was how Hermione reacted when she was really nervous about something. He wished he projected anxiety as power instead of looking like--what had she said? A strung-out house elf
Potter winced. “I haven’t sworn them to secrecy. I suppose some of them have owled home ‘Learned the Patronus charm this week, Mum. Next week we’re going to learn something called Occlumency. Love!’”
Draco was smirking again, at his hesitation this time. "Come on, Potter. We don't have all night."
Whomp. Something sped into Draco’s side. He tried to correct, but his weight sent the broom tumbling end over end until--crash. He landed in an untidy pile on the ground.
Draco seated himself as far away from the others as he could at the eighth year table, but Granger took her usual seat across from him. “Harry says you want us to stay the hell away from you."
Draco looked into Sam’s eyes. “You found help for Lacey and you refused to leave her side. You must care about her a lot.”
“Draco.”
“Ron, show them the system.”
Draco stabbed the pie with his fork.
Harry looked around at the room, which was far more of a mess than it had been when he started. The piles had spilled out into the Defense room itself, which meant that Harry would actually have to clean it up tonight. Nobody was going to be pleased with him if they had to teach around piles of dangerous junk in the morning.
"Look, Harry. I just told him he's doing the best he can. It's what I did. Take you to the sunny places that you never think to go, kiss you so that you're happy and distracted for a few minutes. Try to balance out all the times when you're too lost in the thoughts that you won't share. Draco's doing the best he can, it's not his fault that you’re the way you are."
“Everybody will get used to each other after a while.”
Harry shot an un-sticking charm at the cupboard, and finally the door opened. The smell almost overpowered Harry. He wondered how much of being an Auror was sorting through dark lairs like this. He wondered how much of being a
And he definitely didn't want them hearing about him getting arrested for stealing hundreds of galleons from the Weasleys.
Draco nodded, scrawling another line in his notes about the uses of dragon blood. He was so immersed in his work that he didn’t notice them leave, and he didn’t notice at first when Potter approach the table.
Tears were falling in earnest now, and Hermione had clapped a hand over her mouth.
Harry looked at Draco and saw that Draco was looking back with a strained expression, uncertain how to proceed.
Harry looked down, half expecting his legs and hands glowing with ghostly transparency. Instead, he saw that his knee was bouncing again, and he forced it still.
"Draco?" The girl said. "You've got to get up. You can't freeze now."
Friday afternoon dawned on a Malfoy that had dark bags under his eyes and absolutely no sleep in his recent history. They didn’t have to leave too early for the hearing, since they’d been given permission to apparate to the Ministry. But Draco was still at the table the moment the first dishes materialized, staring that them through bloodshot eyes. Eating something seemed like a good idea, but actually eating anything seemed impossible in this moment.
The other team featured Ron as the Keeper and Harry as the Seeker, of course. Bill and one of his friends from work
Pansy giggled, but at least Hermione had the decency to frown at Ron.
“I don’t know. I suppose it’s a tie between you and You-know-Who,” Draco answered irritably.
“I think I need to go vomit.”
Draco crawled into bed with Harry. It was comforting to have Draco beside him, of course it was.
The little person waved back, then raced to the door to open it for Draco. "Welcome home! Gran was going to make me go to bed before you even got home and I said that's not fair because you promised me a story tonight."
Draco winced. “I tried to sleep. Didn’t Pansy have any trouble?” As she spoke, Ron dropped his books on the table and took a seat next to Hermione. Draco startled at the noise.
"In--you'd let me go in?"
“You can go,” Potter growled.
“Dragonballs,” Pansy muttered.
“You can’t hide the thoughts. And you can’t try to force yourself not to think them. The art to Occlumency, Draco, is allowing those thoughts to starve. They occur to you, have no emotions to stick to, and tumble off in the other direction. People want to keep their secrets as pets, to take them out and play with them in secret, and then marvel that they never die.”
“One of our classmates died in there last term and they want us to just...?”
"What the hell are you doing?" the door swung open, and he was faced with some version of Andromeda, one with deeper lines in her face and a bite to her voice. "I just got that little stinker asleep, and you want to come around banging on the door?"
revealed that he'd cast a memory charm last."
Neville squinted at his own writing, then struck a line. “Good. I’d be doing a piss-poor job of that.”
“I suppose everyone knows that Potter stinks, but the beauty is in the--”
Sam was practically dancing on the spot, and two of the Ravenclaws were asking a question a minute about how they’d worked it out.
"How I behave?" Draco said. His voice squeaked a little, which was stupid. Claire was an unstable kid, she didn't know anything about how Draco acted around Harry Potter. "Never mind. Here, this is the place."
Draco rolled his eyes and sat up again. Potter was safely in his own bed and covered up. “The Board of Governors would shit themselves if they thought they could get you on staff.”
And then, with signature Ginny firmness, she closed them both outside.
He still couldn’t see Potter’s face. He hadn’t looked at it once since Potter had started mocking him for being Patronus-forming-level-obsessed with him. But he could imagine what it looked like now. Hurt, betrayal, confusion. He knew what those expressions looked like on Potter’s face.
Pansy counted out the money and dropped it, then spun on her heel and exited the store, leaving Draco alone.
Blessedly, Dumbledore was walking through the corridor just outside his office when the four of them ran up to the door.
Draco had never seen the spell behave in this way. The light had started small and wispy, but it was growing. The first years were chanting, “Lacey, Lacey, Lacey!” and the light had started to pull together. The other Patronuses had gathered around the nebula of spellwork, sniffing or flicking out tongues at it. And Lacey, who had tears streaming from her eyes and the beginnings of a bloody nose, held her wand steady and stubborn.
They had their list of school supplies for their eighth year. They had a sufficient but not extravagant amount of money to cover all expenses. They had rehearsed which stores they were going to go into first, and second, and last, and the two had planned to go early on a Thursday morning to avoid as much of the crowd as possible.
Draco frowned at Harry. "If you're going to set it up like this is more exciting than Quidditch, why don't you tell them?"
Silence.
He paused at the doorway. It wouldn’t look like the door to the Room of Requirement, probably because they’d required it not to. And it wouldn’t look like the room of hidden things inside. It wouldn’t be charred and blackened, a hollowed out shell, a vanishing cabinet or a dead bird. It would be a dormitory.
Draco stuck out his chin. "You do, but only if I go after you first. I'm always the one who starts things. You give in or feel sorry for me and play along."
The little colt ran a circle around the whole happy mob. Harry brushed it away from his face. “Lacey, why’d you cast your Patronus?” Maybe he was worried that she was feeling the oncomings of another obscurial attack, but Draco hadn’t had to ask. He knew it was the same reason he’d cast his Patronus earlier. It wasn’t about the protection, it wasn’t about the dark.
Draco had conveniently neglected to give the map back, which meant he actually had to search. It meant checking the common room, and then the library, and then realizing it was almost time for dinner and that everyone would be heading to the Great Hall right now, and if Harry really wanted to talk to Draco, he'd have to go too.
“Sorry—I was just thinking. I think it will help people get used to you if they can see you around. Doing normal person stuff.”
It was Sam, who had stopped openly accusing Draco of trying to spy on their minds for the Dark Lord but never stopped watching Draco during lessons. Sam had certainly never run up and touched him.
"Fred and George said you were coming after going to the bank, and you never showed up. Andromeda and Teddy said you never came home. And then the Aurors showed up looking for you."
"Is that all?" George laughed, sliding from the table to stand next to Fred and sling an arm around him. "Thanks for paying us the visit, but no need to worry your handsome noggins about that one! We've been socking away our holiday money all month, and tomorrow when we're done with the Christmas Eve event, I promise you you'll have your payment."
Draco jumped and spun around, reaching for his wand. “Shit. I thought everyone was gone.”
When Draco didn’t say anything, Potter spoke up. “I may have just told McGonagall that what Voldemort did to the school will look like child’s play if I ever find out that Lacey’s been sent back to her parents.”
“Slytherin!”
that, he'd written it on the blackboard. And he'd known that Draco's birthday was coming up. He'd gotten Draco a gift. It's just that his brain had somehow failed to connect these two things as relevant facts.
Harry sighed. Sure, he could have the girl turn out her pockets and find the nosebleed nougat. But what good would that do anyone? If she was already this desperate to get out of class, he might as well--
Potter was shifting from foot to foot, backing up slowly. “Now that I think about it, maybe you do want to find another roommate. I think I’m just going to go—anywhere that’s not here.”
Pansy’s mouth dropped open even wider, if that was possible. “And Potter liked Draco’s wand the best?”
But something he’d said had lit a spark in Potter’s eyes. “That’s it!” he grinned. “You don’t have a happy enough memory. We’ll make a happy memory.”
"I think I'm going to go to the sea," Harry said, talking more quickly now. "And I'll see a bunch of Harpies matches, although I don't suppose Ginny will play too much when she's just getting started, and I'm going to have dinners with Ron and hear about his cases. And I'm going to snog Draco as often as possible."
He realized that his breath was coming in short gasps. Behind him, Harry swore.
“Is the veritaserum still affecting you?” Draco asked.
Potter’s eyes blazed. “They keep her locked up at home. Lacey Ketteridge. They said her magic is unnatural, and when they got the letter from Hogwarts, they locked her up. And McGonagall was
“I don’t know.” Malfoy knew he should know. He should go to the ministry and look it up and read it. Or owl the lawyer. Or something. He should be aware of the rules that he might break, but the moment was too blurry in his memory to pull out the exact wording of his probation, and he’d simply been extra careful about it ever since. That caution combined with the lethargic loaner wand meant he wasn’t doing much outside of the classroom.
To witches green
Harry walked toward Draco. Well, he'd felt settled for about ten seconds. "Every now and then I manage," he grinned. This seemed like a time that he should reach out. In fact, it seemed like a time that his body should just know what to do. But his heart was pounding, anxious and quick.
"You fell asleep reading to Teddy. Come get some supper."
Draco clutched the cookie Ginny hand given them as a consolation prize and gave Claire another, more careful look. "Claire, what's going on? Why is Harry saying that he's married to Ginny, and where are the kids?"
“I need to talk to Malfoy,” she said.
No one had said it right out. Obsession. Unhealthy interest. Did they think he had some sort of--schoolboy crush on Potter? The idea was… difficult to reject. Or rather, it was easy to reject, but the moment it had entered his mind, it had been difficult to erase entirely.
Ginny turned her cat-eyes on Draco, studying him. “Oh, let’s ask Malfoy what he wants. Do you want to play on Harry’s team, or do you want to beat him?”
“It’s not the wand’s fault,” Draco muttered.
He certainly wouldn’t. “If you have a problem with the situation, you can take it up with the Ministry or Headmistress McGonagall,” he said. It sounded less bored than he’d meant and more panicky, but he would take what he could get. It was difficult enough to say that, and he know it would be the last thing he could manage for a while. His throat was growing tight, and his face was hot. He hoped they couldn’t tell from behind how upset he was.
“Not allowed-- what are you talking about?”
"And I feel like going home," the goblin snapped. "Have you got the gold, or have the Weasleys sent their pet Death Eater to beg for mercy? You must be good at it, if you've survived this long."
There was some of the waiting typical of any visit to the Ministry, but eventually the five of them were escorted to the benches outside one of the less austere courtrooms. Draco lowered himself to his seat. It seemed like he should sit. Even though his blood was racing and his fingers were twitching and he needed to
The first time Draco had really encountered Harry’s stage was when he, Crabbe and Goyle had dressed in a giant dementor’s cloak and tried to spook Harry from his broom during a second year Quidditch match. It hadn’t worked, and Draco had been terrified of the stag Patronus since then. It was a good thing that his Patronus hadn't taken that shape.
And then Potter spoke, and Draco’s blood froze in his veins. “You must have known that the doe was Snape’s patronus. He used it to lead us to the Sword of Gryffindor. You must miss him a lot.”
“A well-organized mind,” Potter breathed.
“Oh Merlin,” Potter breathed. “Not again.”
Potter. He’ll hate them! Even someone as thick as Potter won’t be confused about my motives.” He looked down at the button, flashing its message cheerily. He felt somewhat sick
Harry checked Draco’s face. “You sure you want to walk in there like this?”
“Why have the three of you got me backed into a corner?” he frowned.
"What were you--" Draco broke off, trying and failing to keep from laughing. "Give me that quill, Potter, that's my new favorite thing."
“Draco,” Pansy chided, “Stop playing with your quills.”
Time to recover. "Right. I spent the past half an hour looking all over the castle for you. I've got a gift for you up in my trunk." This was not the best time to discuss Polyjuicing into each other for the next Defense lessons to see if the kids could pick up on anything different. Now that he thought about it, maybe the whole discussion of polyjuicing into each other was a conversation that he and Draco should have in private anyway, just in case Draco wanted to do anything other than teach a class while they were--
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. He’d done his best, but what were the chances that Potter hadn’t seen right through him? That when he went to complain to his friends, they wouldn’t tell him everything?
I've gotten used to trusting very few people. People have left me. Some people betrayed me. Merlin, some
“What?”
Draco blinked. His head felt fuzzy. He'd been walking over here--walking over here to make a deposit. A deposit for the joke shop. There was gold--somewhere. He squeezed his eyes closed, then opened them again.
Harry was doing his best to be on time to the Quidditch match. That was the whole point of meeting with Healer Goodnight so early this morning. But he couldn't find the Gryffindor flag that Hermione had given him for cheering, and Draco was leaning against the doorway in a more rigid, impatient, you're-going-to-make-us-late-Potter way than usual.
Draco looked sharply at George. Was that an innocent suggestion, or had George noticed something? "Isn't the bank closed?"
Draco tore off his gloves and stuffed them into his pocket. “Potter can catch the snitch now since he could have caught it then and pulled up short.”
His pulse fluttered in panic. What did she know? Had she found out about--had Hermione said something about his situation regarding Potter? The Weasley girl wouldn’t confront him about that here, in the middle of this crowded train car, would she?
For a moment Draco wanted to explain. Or beg. Grovel. But the moment he opened his mouth, he started shaking from his toes to his teeth. Breath raced in and out of his mouth, and he felt his heart fluttering in his chest like a snitch in his fist.
He saw Potter wheel his broom, head swiveling to calculate the right angle and speed to interfere. Draco steeled himself for Potter’s weight to hit him from the right. They were only a few meters from it. If Draco could somehow keep his direction for just a bit longer. And then Potter startled him completely by pulling up and out of the way. Draco zoomed forward, and his hand closed around the snitch. He let Draco catch the snitch.
“Number 50,” Harry proclaimed, “A real hiring and evaluation process for Hogwarts professors.”
Harry meant to go up to his room and owl Draco that he had decided to quit being a git. He wasn't actually over it, yet, but Draco staying mad at him was awful, and he had been the one who banished Draco from sitting with their friends. So, yes. He could write something conciliatory, and Draco would forgive him, and everything would be fine again.
Their hands were linked between them, and Draco had been full of protestations at first that Harry didn’t know what kind of problems this was going to cause, but now he didn’t want to let go.
Harry shook himself and looked at Ron with an effort. “I dunno.”
"What? What about Jamie, and Alana the puker, and Zoe?"
Draco sat up.
“Potter screaming out your name in passion during the night?
"I'm not the Master of Death anymore," he said. "I got rid of the wand and the stone. In case you were wondering. If I die now, it'll be permanent. I won't have a choice." At least, Harry thought so. He hoped so. There were only so many back doors on death. "Just like everyone else who died."
“Come one, Lacey,” Sam said. Their hand was wrapped around Lacey’s on her wand. “Once more. Let’s see it!”
Hermione frowned. “Oh, Ron. Don’t sulk about it. I never meant that you were supposed to be those things.”
He knocked on his head of house’s door later that week and explained, simply, that if he was going to be at Hogwarts now he was going to have to be better at guarding his thoughts, and Snape had begun Occlumency lessons with him.
Harry stood up, and Ginny scooted her chair around so she could study both of them. "That's really interesting, random person. And really, no offense met, but, why are you in our house?"
Harry looked ready to shout, so Hermione interrupted. “No, we’d just noticed that he was acting strangely in class and told Dumbledore about it.”
He wished more than ever that all the eighth years hadn’t been crowded into one room. He would give anything for a place to go where Potter and his impossible to shake friends wouldn’t pop up. Potter’s friends. He’d warned himself not to think of them as friends, and this was why. When it came to being honest with Potter or protecting Draco from humiliation, they chose Potter.
"Sometimes you just have to remind people to direct their attention to the important things," Lockhart said, tilting his head and shooting Draco a confidential smile. "I think I can help you there. As a citizen of this community, I think it's my job to point out the disgraceful way that Harry Potter is running his little children's shelter. The joke shop will put itself out of its misery before the first of the year. It's amazing how little work I had to do to put them out of business. You did that all by yourself. I just had to point it out. Harry's darling home will be right behind. You'd be more help just by staying out of it."
"You know who I am?" They'd said his name. Whoever it was, they recognized him.
Blood was pounding in Draco’s ears all of a sudden. He must have heard incorrectly.
Lockhart chuckled again. "That's the interesting thing, isn't it? What's really
Harry spun around in a panic to find one of his charges was, indeed, halfway up the shelves. Draco pressed a hand over his mouth to keep from laughing out loud as Harry made an athletic bound over some kids on the floor and swerved around a little family to peel the boy off the wall.
While everyone else was bustling around, pulling stashes of alcohol out of hidden compartments, Draco set up his desk for an evening of hard work.
Mischief
“World cup,” Draco answered shortly. So Potter was sticking as close to the script as he was. Good. “What’s the last dream you remember?”
“Oi!” Ron called. “What’s the big idea, Draco? It’s almost dark, and now you and Harry have to catch the snitch again.”
"Uh, maybe we should--"
There was silence for a moment, and Draco wondered if Potter had nodded off, back to sleep. Then he looked at Draco.
Harry was thrilled. "The first years are never going to figure out what's going on."
"What?"
Draco rolled his eyes. “They’ve always seemed very fond of me.”
“It doesn’t matter, Granger,” he snapped. “Even if he did give the wand back, it would probably stay loyal to him anyway, since it seems they’ve become so attached to each other. And I’m not allowed to practice magic outside of the necessary anyway, so I wouldn’t want to waste a good wand on--”
“You came back then, Malfoy?” a voice challenged.
Well, the first years had definitely noticed that.
"Where's Harry?"
"It's fine, Potter. You don't have to say anything. I'm just going to--I'm going outside."
“The system?”
“For showing me how to notice my thoughts like that. I don’t think I can do any occlumency yet, but it’s helping me.”
He was pretty sure he hadn't managed to growl quietly enough for the rest of the table to miss, because after that, Pansy sliced the cake and put a serving on everybody's plate. "Eat up and get out of here."
“But that’s not--”
“Why aren’t they going to do that with the first years? Or second years? It they want unity, start with the ones who weren’t actively trying to kill each other last year,” he muttered. His head was dancing with visions of Potter and Weasley cornering him.
Harry laughed, shining with all the good feelings of the game, and said. "No, I told McGonagall that I'm not going to do anything next year."
The girl's face crumpled, and she dashed to stand in front of him, planting her fancy dress shoes in the snow. "You can't say things like that, Draco. How am I supposed to help you when--" in the middle of scolding them, she stopped short and clapped a hand over her mouth. "That's it!" Squinting her eyes shut, she whispered. "Do you think we could--well I know that. There's always a risk that. Yes, of course. Oh, thank you, thank you!"
“They repurposed it after the war,” she said.There had never been a cemetery anywhere near Diagon Alley. But they were walking between gravestones now, and Claire scuffed her dress shoes by a single stone in a double plot.
Damn it. He wanted to stand. Move. Get away from here. The silence felt like it was squeezing him to pieces.
"Here we are!" Harry grinned. "And we have excellent news."
Draco shut the cupboard deliberately and pressed his body between Harry and the closed door.
Draco spun around. Lockhart was standing there with snow collecting on his hat. "If it isn't the littlest Death Eater. You don't look like you're having a very good Christmas Eve, Mr. Malfoy. What seems to be the problem?"
Harry crossed his arms over his chest. "Look. I wish you and your sick friend good luck. But I have no desire to relive any of that, and I'm trying to enjoy Christmas Eve with my wife. It's time for you to leave."
“Oi,” Ron said, poking his head into the compartment. “Is dropping the door on me your way of saying you’ve seen enough of us over break?”
Draco’s fingers twitched.
Draco had plenty of chances to get used to being talked down to by children lately, but it still got his hackles up. "Okay, Miss Claire Hanahan, Angel Second Class, who came to rescue me. We've both had a nice dip in the water. Any other big plans to help me out?"
“Sit up, Pansy, so Malfoy has somewhere to sit,” Hermione chided, and Pansy pulled herself into a crunch position until Draco sat down on the couch. Then she let her head flop down on his lap and purred.
"Harry," she sighed. "You are great, and I am so glad we are friends, but I really, really do not want to be counseling my ex-boyfriend's new boyfriend about how to get along with him. And I really, really do not want to be rehashing those conversations with my ex-boyfriend. Cheers."
“What happened?” Hermione asked in a rush.
Draco wished that he was still good at lying to Hermione. He wished he was still good at lying at all, and that he hadn’t done the exact opposite of what he’d trained to do and opened wide every emotion and thought that he usually kept so quiet.
He watched the door as the first of the eighth years made their way to bed and the room emptied. He watched as the fire in the hearth burned lower and lower, and he hoped Harry wasn’t getting himself in too much trouble with his big mouth.
“Maybe we could go to the common room for a few minutes? I bet they’ve all worn themselves down and they’re just draped over the furniture downstairs. There could be snacks.”
“Who?”
A first year was called forward and sat on the stool.
"Well," George dusted himself off. "Draco, since you like walking in the snow so much, why don't you run this over to the bank and tell them it's from trash with love. Or something cleverer. I bet you can think of something cleverer on the way over there," he grinned. "And then you'll meet us at Harry’s place, won't you? The whole family's going to be there, and you can bring Teddy. You and Harry hardly said two words to each other today, I bet he'd love to have you there."
The response to the buttons had been brilliant, especially from Potter’s crowd. Granger had tried to scare him into recalling them, and it nearly worked. Being on the wrong side of her fist once was enough. But the buttons had taken on a life of their own, and Draco was merely the supplier.
They were all there. Not just the kids that he'd come to love and worry about so much, but Teddy and Andromeda were there too. Fred and George were pointing wands at the train set, making it fly around the room, shooting bubbles from the smokestack. Luna was there, too, fitting strange goggles onto one of the youngest kids.
Draco shrugged. "We probably could have made a better argument if I had told you about it beforehand. Besides, I feel entirely stupid for getting everyone off track that way, because it's really about Lacey."
Ron took the paperwork away from Hermione, lifted her to her feet, and wrapped her in a jubilant hug. “You did it, Hermione. Now relax.”
But he wasn't. Harry opened his mouth. Draco was telling him everything, there was no guessing wrong and mucking it up. He could just tell Draco that he did feel the same, but all the gears inside of him felt locked into place. Say words, Harry. Tell him something.
"Running in the corridors?" Her mouth twisted, and Harry wasn't sure if she was trying to contain laughter or displeasure. "I should take points from your houses. But I have something to discuss with the two of you."
She started to laugh, "Just hide the evidence. No one's going to want to listen to us sing if they think I'm a flower murderer."
Draco frowned. "But the kids are okay, aren't they? Wherever they are?"
Harry raised his hands for quiet. "Hermione's in the fireplace."
“Merlin,” Hermione whispered.
Draco had to bite down some kind of fond smile. It was a sleepy, grey day outside, with fat snowflakes lazilly dusting the windowsills of the potions classroom, and Potter seemed to be dozing off.“You’re supposed to be stirring,” He forced himself to growl. “Not napping.”
Harry snatched his hand back as if he’d been stung. He tore his eyes away from Draco’s chest and looked into his eyes. “Uh, I--Sorry, I--I’m going for a walk.”
"An evening or two that keeps me sane," Harry said. "You're right that I wouldn't be able to do it without Luna, but don't sell yourself short."
Potter set the wand down on the desk between them, and Draco’s fingers twitched again.
In every heart.”
Two Slytherin boys stood up and pulled their wands, then almost simultaneously cast ghostly patronus charms.
Harry found himself staring out the window in class again. Merlin, it looked so peaceful out on the grounds. The sun was shining, the long slope of the hill down to the Forbidden Forest was alive with green, and a thestral was swooping over the treetops on the horizon. If only he could be out there--
He was mere centimeters away from contact when Harry seemed became aware and looked over at the hand inching toward him. His eyes shifted to Draco’s face as Draco hurriedly pulled his hand back and pretended to be stretching his other arm.
"Luna, can you get the under-eights dressed in these?"
That voice belonged to Ronald Weasley, and there was only one person he could be talking to.
Draco tried to make another escape, but Pansy and Finnegan literally dragged him over to the couch and handed him a glass of something alcoholic that he neither asked for nor intended to drink. And as Ron did another retelling of the whole day from the moment the trial started to the instant Lacey cast her Patronus, this time with even more drama and intrigue, Draco watched for Harry to come through the door.
"The dark mark. You were never born, so you were never marked by Voldemort. No dark mark, no wand."
Draco made a little sound, and Harry's eyes darted from the picture to Draco's face.
“Any complaints regarding their use of magic should be reported to their sponsor. Regarding the issue that arose during this trial of Professor Rubeus Hagrid’s restrictions on magic, the Wizengamot is in agreement that a new case should be opened in light of recent information to revisit and revise these restrictions. If Miss Hermione Granger and Mr. Ronald Weasley would like to serve as his legal representation, we will see them in two weeks time.”
Draco had the child’s instinct to list a thousand injuries so that Harry would keep one steadying hand on him and send more magic through him, but he couldn’t be that pathetic. Especially not with the entire Weasley clan, plus Bill’s work friend and Angelina Johnson clustered around. “I assure you, Potter. I’m fine,” he managed.
"Pleased with how that turned out, are you?"
"Yes," Harry said. She already knew that. He'd mentioned Grimmauld place and Kreecher before.
Hermione sighed. “Honestly Ron, he knows that I--” she looked back at her book. “Draco, you’ll still be here in half an hour, won’t you? I have some points I want to go over with Hagrid for the trial.”
Claire hopped down the steps and took a nibble of her cookie. "We should get walking, I think. And I told you, Draco. Just like you wished, you've never been born. Without you, Harry wouldn't have kept the home going past the first few months. Hasn't he ever told you how much you helped him?"
Ron shrugged. “Alright, Mione, but I’ve already been offered jobs and you have too, so I’m going to visit Hagrid and tell him you’re too busy to see him.”
“We are talking about him.”
Walking down to breakfast the next morning was an exercise in agony. He kept rehearsing what it would be like when he saw Granger and Weasley. Weasley would say something. Weasley was sure to say something.
When Harry thanked Ron and Hermione for helping Draco with his case, he had  definitely
“Hah!” he’d said. It had come out breathless and weak. “They’re not
George snatched the paper out of Draco's hands. "Lockhart's Laughs is right. If he thinks he can use Harry against us, he's a fool."
"Professor Potter? My nose is bleeding. Can I go to Madame Pomfrey?" One of the Gryffindor girls had her hand pressed to her nose, trying to stem the spurts of blood.
Sam took off like a spell, bouncing up the steps and twisting around the landings. Draco followed as quickly as he could, but Sam reached Lacey’s side before him and had grabbed onto her arm. There were several other first-years gathered around Lacey. Draco wasn’t surprised to see blue and yellow robes in the mix, but when he saw two of the first-year Slytherins, he paused.
“Yes?” Potter’s voice sounded brittle.
Granger and Weasley had been bickering about something, but they trailed off and turned toward Draco. He couldn’t read their expressions. Pansy though, looked shocked.
"I wanted to go over the details for the Christmas Eve entertainment. What time tomorrow should I have the kids here by?"
"These are just going to attract wrackspurts," she said. "And these kids already have enough trouble with wrackspurts. Don't you have anything blue? We could balance it out with blue."
Draco fought not to think of Granger and Weasley as friends. It wouldn’t have been fair. But they spent many of the their free hours over the next week working together in the library or the common room, poring over their legal texts and marking up the paper. Sometimes Ron would bring his classwork to complete first, and Draco helped him with potions a few times. Ron seemed to be in charge of providing snacks, since all the house elves were obsessed with him. But Draco tried to keep everything straight in his head: Granger was pretending to be friends with Pansy to help the rest of the castle move on after the war, and Weasley just played along with whatever Hermione did all the time. Granger, not Hermione. He couldn’t even keep that straight, and it didn’t help that both of them had taken to calling him Draco whenever they felt like it. Didn’t they understand he needed the boundaries to be clear? Did they not see how easily Pansy and he could be taken in by their false friendship?
“Number 48: No one will have to flush themselves down a toilet to get into the ministry.”
As the boy made his way through the crowd, Harry shook his head. "These kids are going to be the death of me. That or Luna. I can't believe she's got them all looking for wrackspurts."
Those smiles were usually for the other person's benefit. Or because someone else made it possible to smile. All on his own, Draco didn't smile much. But Christmas Eve, and the candles in the windows, the enormous flakes of snow drifting down, and two enormous bags of gold in his arms--Draco could smile for this.
Draco felt his cheeks glow red. They managed to bring up that dumb incident every time. Every time! At least he could answer truthfully. “No.” Although if it had, he might have been almost as reluctant to show them its form.
Hermione was just as difficult to convince that evening at dinner. “Draco, I have a theory about why you won’t do your patronus.”
“That’s not what I meant, Malfoy.”
Everything about Draco crackled like ice. “Did you. Talk to. Her?”
Hermione looked irritated. “The ministry is removing the stipulations on your wands. But each of you is still supposed to have a sponsor to “oversee” your magic uses and “handle complaints.” If you use illegal magic, you should go through the same channels as everyone else. And if you don’t, why should people be complaining about it?”
"You watch everything they drink."
Their probation dictated that the two were required to attend their final year of Hogwarts. Draco could only imagine how many parents were keeping their children home to shield them from Death Eaters Pansy Parkinson and Draco Malfoy.
“You haven’t,” she said. “I saw the whole thing.”
“Nope. None of you are dementors, and I’m going to save my skills for when I really need them.
Potter was always destined to catch the snitch. He was golden, and they were drawn to them. But for the rest of the day, Potter was always within reach, always checking to see if Draco was okay. Draco felt like he might be the actual winner here.
Draco wished he could fix it, but there was no way for him to make it better. If he walked over there and told them what an honor it was to be part of the great tradition of Slytherin, they would be sickened by him. He was the reason they were ashamed to be in the house. It would be a favor to everyone if he wasn’t here.
That advert hadn't been the only one, and the back-to-school rush that usually gave the shop such a boost never came. The crowds were all at Lockhart's Laughs, forking over galleons by the bucketload. And one morning, Draco arrived at the Joke Shop to find magically shifting graffiti that proclaimed, “Deatheaters aren’t funny. Sack the Snake.”
"Harry, if the teaching is that stressful...."
Draco stared at the brick wall. "I can't get us in," he admitted. "Not without my wand."
"Okay," Claire said. "But it's less passable without you here."
Yellow for loyalty
And then Potter had blown into the joke shop at seven one morning, planted his hands on the front counter, and screamed, "I'm going to kill them all."
"No," Draco said, almost too quickly. "I don't want to interrogate you about it--it's just... I want you to know that it's okay for you to talk about it. I've been awful about your family in the past in a dozen different directions, and I get it if I'm the last person you'd want to....anyway." Draco turned away abruptly and picked up another shard of pottery.
"Draco!"
The memory of earlier that day, when Lockhart had spoken like he did in front of the kids from the home, filled Draco's mind. It was one thing to write about him in the paper. It was one thing to scare away their customers. But those kids--Draco knew he couldn’t stop them from ever hearing about who he really was, but he didn’t want them thinking about him that way.
“I’ve got just as much homework as you. Maybe I’ll stay here and do my work, too.”
“What are you doing?” Ron growled at Hermione.
Big <3 to people in tough, unsafe, or unsupportive coronavirus situations. And big <3 to the adults who want to protect kids, but don't always have that power.
Just as the water was starting to steam, Potter slipped back into the room. Draco looked up and instantly swallowed the quip he’d been about to fling. Potter’s face was flushed and his hands were clenched at his sides. It would be too easy to pick a fight with him right now.
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know if I’d be able to do it, either. You’ve seen more than anyone what a mess I’ve been making of things this year.”
"Uh," Draco mumbled. "Sorry to interrupt, but Claire--this girl with me thinks she's an angel, and she says she's got no family to find. But she was able to get into Diagon Alley without a wand."
impressive. Or, if you will, worthwhile. I want to do things that matter, Potter."
mentioned how hot he found it when Malfoy cast spells like this. Naturally, smoothly. Like breathing. It was different from the focused way that Hermione did magic, or the hopeful way that Ron tossed out spells. Draco's magic was impatient and taken-for-granted and entirely Draco.
“It won’t matter. I’m inviting you in, it should be easy. Why don’t you use Legilimency on me and describe what you see.”
If Draco had felt unsteady at the beginning of the conversation, it was nothing compared to how he felt now. He tried to organize his own thoughts:
Draco knew he should head straight for the hospital, but he found his steps leading towards the joke shop. He didn’t want to turn himself in to strangers, either for the crimes or the confusion. He just wanted someone to recognize him, and set him straight. Fred and George probably wouldn't be there any longer, but if they were, maybe they could help him sort out what had happened with Harry.
“Disgusting,” Malfoy spat. “As if I would ever--I can’t believe you lot have dragged me into such a--you all better stay away from me. Especially you, Potter.”
“How do we learn to do that?” a red-headed Slytherin piped up.
Ron looked up, a bit startled. “We’re just--researching.”
Harry laughed, relief coloring his voice. More feet settled around them, and Draco struggled to sit up.
So when he faced Healer Goodnight, instead of telling her about Lacey and Ron and talking to Draco in the Defense office, what he said was. "I'm a ghost."
Several of the kids looked around the room, thoughtful. "Maybe a spell. Is there something to find out if they've taken anything recently?"
"It's not there." Claire whispered.
"Ye-es. They're like face sparkles. I don't understand why anyone doesn't want freckles."
“It’s fine, Potter,” Draco said through gritted teeth. A real Quidditch player should have been able to hold their position after a bump like that. Ginny was going to be so angry. Draco finally managed to sit fully up and stuck his legs out in front of them. His trousers were in a state. The knee had ripped out of one of them and--was he bleeding?
Sometime’s Pansy’s helpful advice wasn’t as helpful as she intended it to be.
“If he did that, what excuse would you give for avoiding us?” Finnegan shot back.
to do next. Do you have a place that you can live next year?"
Pansy tried to appease her, “I guess if you’re from a muggle family--”
“And I told the Headmistress exactly what I thought about sending her home to that family, and she explained to me that Lacey wanted to go home. She has little sisters that still live with her parents, and she didn’t want them to think she’d left them for good. They’re really young, but Lacey thinks one of them might be a witch, too.”
He shrugged. “I do like to make an entrance.”
Draco’s jaw dropped. “Back?” he squawked.
Harry's curls were looking a mess now, but he forced his hands to his sides. "Jamie. Go play with the pygmy puffs, and please keep your feet on the ground."
Potter frowned and leaned on the back of the chair behind him. “What’s the wording on the probation, exactly?”
“You’re the only one who seems to be bothered, so my apologies, but why don’t you put a spell on your bed at night and ignore it like everyone else.”
It hit like a brick to the gut. Draco found Claire and himself shoved into the back alley, and all he could manage to say was, "His wife?"
He was interrupted by the stomach-turning sound of another student, retching twice and making a run for the wastebasket while spewing down his front. Harry pinched the bridge of his nose. Penny's best friend, getting sick moments after her bloody nose. Why couldn't they at least be subtle about using Skiving Snacks? "I guess you'll have someone to make sure you get there. Both of you--"
Draco was still busy storing away that reaction of joy, so he hadn't braced himself at all for the moment that Harry threw his arms around Draco, smashing Draco’s cheek into his damp, scratchy scarf. "You're here."
"They're okay," Draco breathed. "They're all here."
"Because Draco has always been a much stronger Potions student, and I believe the rapport he has demonstrated would easily transfer to the Potions position."
He was contemplating asking her this when Weasley sat down next to her, and those thoughts stuttered to a halt and died.
“No one’s dragging you, Ron,” Hermione said, her attention half on her reading. “But listen to this: For the period that the court does designate, the defendant shall not use any extraneous magic. Magic shall be used only when required. Required magic includes spells assigned in classrooms at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Any magic judged to be in excess of that required will be grounds for the defendant to lose the privilege of owning a wand. Repeat infractions will lead to further legal consequences, which could include house arrest, expulsion from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, or imprisonment in Azkaban.”
“Do your Patronus,” he told Sam. “Do it now.”
“No, but when I said that, some secret came to mind. Today, we learn how to identify those pet thoughts.”
Once they had settled in with a cozy stack of books and parchments in front of them, several of the Slytherins walked by flashing their “Potter Stinks” badges. Harry glared at Malfoy. “I do not appreciate that.”
Why was he even calculating their likelihood of casual contact?
Draco handed his cookie to Claire and started shuffling through the snow. "Maybe the Weasley girl is right, and we should take you to the hospital. Maybe I should check myself in, too. Might get a reprieve from Azkaban."
Fred Weasley
He had a crush on her best friend.
“Abbreviation and notetaking so we can keep track of what we learned.
"They're not there either."
"Look at them!" Fred hooted. "Mama Knut and Papa Sickle. And if you want this old Joke Shop to last another year, the two of you better get busy real quick."
“Well. Is there a shield here, Potter?”
He didn't bother to explain why they did keep Draco on. Maybe it was so that they'd have someone to open the shop and turn on the lights early in the morning while Fred and George snoozed until the last minute. Or maybe, more likely, it was pity. Either way, Draco was the one responsible for being there early, starting a fire to warm the shop and re-starting the spells that made the hat on top of the building rise and fall, covering the rabbit.
"Mm," Draco said. "Then you know that Jameson is over there climbing the shelves?"
Draco sat up suddenly, on his elbow. “Potter, what are you going to do once we’re done with school?”
Harry laughed. “Come on, aren’t you supposed to say, ‘I’d like to see you try,’ or something like that?
"What's in there?"
Draco heard Weasley’s complaints emanating from one room. Not his then. Longbottom’s head popped out of another doorway, and he nodded at Potter. “Beginning to think you were lost.”
“I sort of forgot about it. But I was also having a hard time giving it up. It--I’ve gotten attached to it. But I didn’t recognize that you hadn’t really gotten a wand that would work for you.”
Harry spun around, and he felt Draco put a hand on his elbow. "I can," he said fiercely. "I can just quit. I'm not locked in by some prophecy anymore. I'm not the chosen one, and it doesn't matter how bad Robards and McGonagall want me. I
His movement stilled. “I only had one Defense teacher who did anything useful for me. Two if you count turning you into a ferret.”
“Of course I--” Draco stopped short and shot Neville a look.
Harry
Draco wasn’t sure if it was the apparation, or the Pepper-up potion Hermione had forced on him, or something else entirely, but he felt exceptionally ill. He remembered every terrible thing he’d ever done to Hagrid. Actually, that was probably too many to think of at the moment. He thought of several terrible things he’d done to Hagrid, and spun around quickly.
He wished Potter were here to do this. If Potter was the one making foolhardy choices, it wouldn’t turn out with an obscurial destroying the tower and killing half the Gryffindors. With Draco in charge, there was no way of knowing how terribly this could end.
who had come to join the match, were beaters. Arthur, Hermione, and Angelina Johnson, who had joined as a guest of George, served as the chasers.
"Are you okay, Draco?" Claire asked. "You don't look so good."
Harry stared. He knew that there was something he should say or do now, but he couldn't think of what it was.
"Do you want to ask me something about it?" Harry asked. He sounded so tired. He didn't mean to sound so exhausted before Draco even asked.
“I told you it sends the wrong message to the younger students if we isolate the Slytherins at the Eighth year table. If we want true reconciliation, it has to start with us. And you said, ‘Yeah, but not while I’m trying to eat.’”
“You want the whole eighth-year class to learn Occlumency?”
He felt an odd rush of relief at the idea that the girls were playing some political game rather than becoming best friends, but it was halted when Pansy added, “It’s still so quiet in our room.” She was picking apart her roll more than eating it.
Something about the way Neville said it made one side of Draco’s mouth twitch into a smile. It didn’t feel like guilt.
Right. Because there was any other explanation for the fact that Draco was still sitting here after the kind of day he had.
"If we put it to a vote with the first years, you might be surprised how it turns out."
“I can’t help noticing--you’re putting me on edge.”
“Pepper-up Potion,” she sighed. “Try not to come off manic.”
"No. I'm whinging now," Harry had answered. And for the next hour straight, he had vented every anger, frustration, and irritation catalogued at the kids in his care, and Draco was in stitches.
Harry had been plenty of other people, and he'd had many of his friends Polyjuice into him, which he still avoided thinking about. But suddenly the idea of giving Draco that close of a connection with Harry's body felt like a lot. Possibly too much. Draco was starting to know Harry's body, but this would be different, and Harry wasn't sure about doing this all at once.
Draco had more questions, but Kingsley was practically forcing him in through the door at the moment.
“Of course.”
100,000 thanks to the readers, especially everyone who has left comments and kudos. Life is such an interesting mess right now.
"Are you serious? Sam cried, pounding their fists on their desk. "You've been disguised as each other the whole time?"
Draco felt his mouth drop open in shock. He couldn’t be here. It was one thing sitting through classes full of students who hated him. It was another having Potter as a professor. Maybe he could drop the course? He would go talk to Slughorn later, and say that his career plans had changed.
Lacey twisted and shivered on the floor, but her eyes locked on Draco’s. “Pr-Professor Malfoy. Should I ca-cast too?”
Potter glanced at Draco, also from the corner of his eyes. “You’re right. He was a stubborn man. Who’s teaching potions this year, anyhow?”
"Of course I am," Draco said, looking shocked. "I mean. Yes. Thank you. I'm glad you could see what a mutually beneficial arrangement..." He backtracked when he saw McGonagall's expression. "I'm grateful for the opportunity."
Draco elbowed Pansy, hard. “It’s for us,” he ground out.
"Harry Potter lives here, and Luna lives here almost all the time, and fifteen kids right now. Jamie and Holly and Alana and Zoe and Maya--"
