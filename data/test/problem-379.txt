"Please. We'll see each other again, I promise." Blaise says, pecking him on the lips softly and kissing his forehead. "Go home, darling."
He looks up quickly once again, just to catch one more look. What frightened him was that Blaise was looking back with a look of... perhaps worry? No, that can't be right. Slytherins don't feel worry, especially not when looking at a Gryffindor.
His thoughts were cut off by a hand flying in his face, "Hello! Neville! What's got you spaced out?" asks Parvati Patil.
"Are you lying to me?" He asks, bringing his face closer to Draco's, staring him straight in the eyes. Draco noticed his pupils weren't circular but rather skinny and vertical and his eyes were a deep red. He brought his claw like fingers up to Draco's face. "There will be consequences for lying, you know. Big consequences." His sharp fingernails scratched Draco's face, leaving a small sting.
"Hmm... Well, I'm sorry you don't feel at peace. But, this is very advanced magic. I can help you but I must do the enchantment myself. I do have a very easy task you can do to it, though. First, you coat it with a lavender scent. Muggles do this as well. Lavender is a very soothing herb and Muggles and Wizards alike use it as a means of calming the nerves and inducing sleep. However, we need to make it so the scent can never fade. I'm sure I can make that happen for you." Dumbledore promises, "Do you have this bracelet with you?"
"You walked into me you-- You're a pain in the arse, ya know?" Draco gives him a glare. "I try to make amends and you continue to be an insufferable spoiled little prat. Fuck you, Malfoy."
"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to make things awkward." Neville blurts out once more. Wow, genius, you just made things more awkward.
"Thank you, Sir Longbottom! And yes, you are brave. I can tell. Don't argue about it either because I'm right. Also I'm happy to be of help to you any day. Anyways, I agree, the world is becoming scarier every day. I often worry about my friend as well with this whole you-know-who thing. I can't exactly say why, but I often worry about his safety, especially at his home. That worries me the most. But I understand every fear you have. It's ok to feel that way, it is all pretty scary. I really hope your mother gets better soon and that she stays alive long enough for you to spend lots of quality time with her. For my family, I will tell you about it but I will warn you that it's kinda depressing as well. Well, my father is somewhere, I don't know where. And my mother has this boyfriend that is incredibly rude and stupid and well... he really hates me. He blames me for everything and my mother believes him. They also stay out for long periods of time, go to fancy restrauants, and I'm left at home all alone with very little food. If there is any food, it's very old and moldy. Eventually I had to start getting my own food... but I have no money. So, I started taking galleons that my mum's boyfriend would leave laying around and he wouldn't notice since he's incredibly rich. Well the other day I was really feeling bad so I went out to the Three Broomsticks and bought lots of firewhiskey to you know, numb myself. My music was too loud so I didn't hear her come in. She saw me drunk and maybe a few empty bottles and I got kicked out. Sorry if this sounds like me asking for pity. I promise that's not it at all. But it does feel great to tell someone other than my friend. Maybe you'll think I'm weird now, or terrible for stealing money. If so, I understand. But thanks for asking."
"Helping out Professor Sprout. She wanted me to get her some plants from the garden." Neville informs.
Blaise had invited him and Neville to Luna's house for an unknown reason. They seemed to be waiting for something and Blaise wouldn't let him eat anything.
Blaise felt odd actually touching Neville, but once he started he couldn't stop. Not to mention that hug made the gray skies turn bright blue. Especially when Neville snuggled up to him. Merlin, he was worried he'd die right there.
He felt tears form into his eyes but he tried to push them down as much as possible. Is he really going to be this stupid and cry over that?
"Look at me, you prat!" Blaise demands. Draco rolls his eyes but looks right at Blaise. His tough demeanor begins to fade. "I know you may not believe it, but you didn't do anything wrong. Yes, you accepted that lifestyle, but you did it to survive! We all forgive you. Well, at least Harry and his friends do. Including me! You were found not guilty. What other proof do you need?"
He decides to not go after Blaise, but instead to go find a place to rest and hide upon Crabbe's wishes.
"I'm still figuring that out. But I did find this really soft blanket that's pretty big, then herbology supplies and-"
Draco can feel his cheeks heat up. He could only hope Harry didn't notice, yet realistically, it would be plain as day.
He took another deep breath and checked his surroundings before walking towards the common room. He ran a hand through his hair. What was that feeling?
Every day, him and Harry would take turns checking Draco's arm for new marks. So far, he was clean! It wasn't until Harry came stomping towards him in a rush that he began to really worry.
Blaise looks at him for a few seconds until saying, "Yes... I have. I have a lot of times... It was with you! Before we got together and well... after you said you might not see me again. I couldn't eat... I couldn't sleep... It physically hurt without you."
His father then grabs his arm tightly and pulls him out of the other door. He pulls him upstairs and into his room, slamming the door behind them and throwing Draco onto his bed.
"On a broom?! He can fly?!" Draco asks in shock. "And he snuck out?! Either Neville is completely different than I thought or he's gone completely mad."
He opened it, feelings embarrassed that he's doing the same thing he did in 6th year. He looked around for Draco's name and there he was... in the second floor lavatory.
He rushes to the shed, opens it up, and pulls out his grandmother's broom. It had dust and cobwebs on it, but he just brushed them away and and steps onto the broom.
Blaise reaches forward again and leaves persistent kisses upon his cheek playfully, "Say you're handsome right now!" Blaise teases.
The chaos of both his mother and her boyfriend's voices still rang through the house. He covers his ears and huffs angrily. He'll definitely have to buy some food on his own later. Or eat those crackers. He was just lucky that her boyfriend was irresponsible enough to let his galleons slip out of his pockets and into couches and left on counters. He was also glad he was dumb enough to not realize Blaise was taking it.
They zoom off into the sky and back to his house. At this point, it was pretty dark and Neville was pretty tired. As soon as he got home, he plopped onto his bed and fell asleep.
"Yes please." He says. His grandmother walks over to the chair, reaches on the floor and hands him four pages of crinkled parchment.
Harry looked at him, shocking him at how soft his expression was, "I would never... We don't even have to talk about it ever again if you wish!"
All of this was too much to take in for Blaise. Luckily for him, breakfast had soon ended and it was time to go to his first class. He didn't expect to see Neville, yet there he was staring straight at his desk.
Harry simply looks at him before opening his mouth and asking, "Why didn't you tell them? You knew it was me, yet you said nothing. Why?"
It's all he wanted right now. A tapping came on his window. He looked up to see an old brown owl flying right in sight. He opens the window and the owl drops a letter right in his lap. He opens it and begins to read, but the owl keeps chirping.
"I... I think we need to break up." Hannah says, trying to hold back the tears. She felt stupid for feeling sad about it.
"It was strange how Malfoy stood up for you today with Snape. Honestly, I think the git is up to something." Ron says.
Draco and Harry both got married in the year of 2005 and had two children. The oldest being Albus James Potter and the other being Lily Minerva Potter. Albus was sorted into Slytherin while Lily is a Gryffindor. Draco had also dropped his original surname and is now Draco Potter.
"But it's embarrassing to cry over it, right?" Draco asks. "I mean, I shouldn't get emotional over that."
Madame Pomfrey sighed. Neville did this many times. "Come on, Neville." She grabbed his arm gently and pulled him away from Blaise.
He's terrified that it won't work out, but he doesn't let that stop him from saying, "I'd love to give us a try as well."
Neville was astounded and flattered, yet didn't believe it for a second. However, something was telling him this was too sincere to be some joke. He pocketed the letter and put the rest of his new things in his dorm room before rushing out of the common room and asking a few Ravenclaws where Luna might be.
He could feel the room darken as the Dark Lord entered. He stared down at the dark wood of the table.
"Oh, but it can," McGonagall says with a grin. "You see, we must do whatever we see fit to make these partnerships work out."
Draco pauses for a minute. "It took me a while... But the only thing I can think of is you two... Harry's been here to support me and he gives me affection I've never had and... You, Blaise, you were the first person I was able to talk to about my problems in life and the first person to give me an actual hug." A single tear escapes Draco's eye, "Words cannot express how much that meant to me. It may have just been a simple hug, but to me it was so much more. It was actual love someone showed me for the first time! And now Harry comes along and is showing me even more love and... It's so bizzare... It's hard to believe it's real sometimes. Sometimes I worry I'm just imagining it all and I went crazy eventually with my father and now I'm imagining every good thing to happen to me ever."
"Ginny, I'm sorry about what I said. I didn't mean to put it that way. Well, I did but it was a mistake."
They show up in the dining room and without even a second to relax, his father drags him to his office and pushes him into a chair.
Neville reaches down and grabs a sandwich. He takes a bite of it and nods in approval. They ate most of the food after a while and it was getting darker. They laughed and chatted about many things, even about their families.
"Alright." His grandmother says with a sigh. He knew she wanted him to be normal and not carry around every piece of trash she throws at him, but it's the only thing Neville has of his mother. Even if she thinks she's depositing trash to a nurse.
What she doesn't understand is that nothing ever goes his way. Every friend leaves him or just ends up ignoring him until they need a favor. So far only Luna has stayed with him this long. He isn't so sure about Hannah, especially after he trusted Blaise. He still beats himself up for that.
"Attacked me? Yeah. Well, techincally we both fought each other, but I never tried to do anything like this! There is no way that bloody troll is getting anything from me. Ever." Draco says, glancing down at the flowers and rolling his eyes. Flowers are overrated.
"You... could talk to me? You know... I've been having thoughts about the war too. I can't seem to sleep sometimes. Maybe we can talk about that together? You won't have to be alone."
"I think I might love you..." Neville says again. He smiles wide. It felt right, but not entirely. Everything inside him told him to say what he really wanted to. He couldn't hold it back. "No... I do love you. I love you." Neville says, his smile growing wider. Perfect. It sounded and felt perfect.
Hunter gives him a strange look, but still smiles. "I can see why she says the bargyles love you. Not many Slytherins want to do that on their own..." Hunter trails off. Before Blaise can get offended, Hunter speaks up again, "Well... we have to get past those house-elves. The only way we can and have enough time to cook is if it's during the Yule ball... What do you say, Zabini?"
"Your voice... That smile you've giving me right now... I must be making things weird." Neville says.
"Ever since third year, I always kinda thought you were... attractive." Harry gives a nervous chuckle.
"Huh..." Neville says to himself. He wonders why he is so focused on finding this person, but assumes it's just natural curiousity.
He goes into the Great Hall and watches Neville sit on the steps. Blaise sits beside him and they sit in silence for a while.
"I'm wonderful, thanks for asking! It seems that Trevor is quite the troublemaker." Blaise comments with a smirk.
He was dressed in a suit and tie, one his father instructed him to wear. It was nice, but knowing his father got it made him feel disgusting somehow. He tried his best not to dwell too much on it.
"Sit wherever you want," Blaise says, gesturing to the blanket. Neville slides his shoes off his feet, showing off his clean socks and sitting down on the blanket.
"You don't get it, do you?! If I don't do this... I'll die." His voice cracks and a single tear falls down his face. "I'll-"
They both reached for the dittany and their hands touched. A strange, but oddly comforting feeling rushed through Neville's body. He couldn't pin point it, but it was something that made him happy but also incredibly uncomfortable. However, he decided he liked that feeling. But why did it happen at that moment?
She lays the book down on her lap and narrows her eyes at him, "Why did you even go to the ball with me? To lead me on?!"
He sighs sadly and closes up the letter. He wishes he could help this person, but without knowing who they were made that impossible. So instead, he rushes out of the dorm and towards the Ravenclaw common room.
"No, thank you," Neville replies, his voice slightly cracking. I hate that. He always hated it. It made him sound girly and scared. Maybe he was girly and scared, but it still made him feel bad!
Oddly enough, a part of him doesn't want to get help. Why should he need to stop himself? It's not like his body matters. Nothing matters. But, he said yes for Harry. If Harry is happy, that's all that matters. That doesn't mean he'll have to do anything, right?
Neville grabs it from him when he finishes and smiles, "It is you..." He whispers. But that smile slowly fades. "Wait... since when? How long did you like me?"
He smiled wide. He was tempted to stand up and jump all around the room, but decided against it. He may be thinking about someone that isn't him at all. Just because Neville seems to have taken a liking towards boys doesn't mean anything. The thought makes his smile drop from his face, but he needed to bring himself back down to earth before he got his hopes too high.
Neville was baffled. He couldn't wrap his head around someone giving him attention other than to laugh at him.
Draco stares at him in wonder, not knowing what to say. Harry sighs and straightens out his glasses, standing up, and beginning to leave. "Potter!" Draco shouts at him.
He ignored the voices around the room saying: "Neville?!" "My goodness, are you ok?" "Bloody hell, what's wrong with you?" and much more.
"Isn't that something your father taught you? I've met the man before, and he is no picnic. I may have been mad at you before, but in all reality, you only did all of that because you were taught to hate!" Myrtle says, rubbing his back.
He kissed rough, a bit sloppy even, but it was the most he's ever felt in a kiss. The girls he had before tried too hard and it was only fueled by lust. Not this, nothing was like this. They pull away and Blaise smiles at him again, which makes Neville look at the floor.
Draco's eyes go wide and he raises his fist, punching Harry right in the mouth. "You're a pathetic excuse for a son." His father's words ring through his head and he punches Harry again and again. Harry soon gets enough strength to throw Malfoy off of him and charge towards him, fist balled up tightly.
"Yeah... uh..." He looks around and notices many hospital beds with patients in them, "Why am I in a hospital?"
"I'll see you later, my darling. I have business to attend to." Blaise smirks and pulls Neville into a hug that makes Neville want to melt. "I love you. Be safe, alright?" Blaise says into his shoulder.
Neville chuckles and rests his head on Blaise's shoulder. They sway together in the moonlight. He loved how he felt in Blaise's arms. He never wanted to let go. Suddenly, a thought enters his head. But no... that can't be right. But when he said it in his head it did feel right.
Blaise reaches into the bag, taking out the beans and one cauldron cake before handing the rest to Neville.
He thought for a second. He didn't ever really care for the ball, other than being able to spend time with Neville. Well, evidently that was never going to happen. All he would have there was heartache from watching his true love and some girl fall in love right in front of him. Maybe even kiss. There was no way in Hades that he was going to that wretched ball.
"Don't take this the wrong way. I understand what you're going through. Sometimes I wonder... if I wasn't alive anymore then maybe I wouldn't have to deal with all of this. Maybe I wouldn't be forced to do things I don't want to and be someone I'm not and maybe... maybe I wouldn't worry about feeling loved. Everything would just go away." Draco admits, almost seeming to talk to himself more than Blaise.
Blaise grabs his hand and looks him in the eyes, "We all start somewhere. I'll help you practice if you need to! You got really far today with flying. You can do much, much more. I just know it."
"I'm just glad you're asking for my permission to tell people. If anyone knew, especially my father and he managed to get out of prison, I would be dead." Draco says with a nervous gulp.
"No problem, please sit." She says, gesturing to the chair in front of her. He takes it and leans over to her.
Ginny lives with her girlfriend, who she's been with for a year. They live out in the city and have two female dogs. She visits her family often, unlike her brother Percy who hasn't been seen since their fifth year, and brings her dogs and girlfriend along which brings Molly joy.
He's shaking as if he was standing naked in the freezing cold. Blaise couldn't stand to see him like this.
The doors suddenly slam open to reveal Lucius Malfoy shouting a jerking away from Aurors carrying him out in handcuffs.
He had went to see his grandmother and spend time with her. For the first time ever, she had grabbed onto him and hugged him tight. She cried and cried into his shoulder and told him how worried she was.
"Maybe... Just drop it ok. He had enough to deal with himself. We weren't much different. He didn't see it as an option. So please, just drop it." Draco demands.
"I have a question for you. This may be a bad time so, forgive me. Where did you find that bracelet?" Dumbledore asks.
"No, I didn't mean it that way! I just wanted you to have something nice. Think of it as a way of asking..." Blaise gulped, "I-if we could b-be friends." He wanted to smack himself on the head. He was more confident than this yet Neville made him a fumbling idiot.
He began to breathe heavily without control. What was happening to him? He couldn't breathe, a Slytherin was occupying his every thought, his heart was raving around in his chest, and he was mesmirized by that same Slytherin all at once. Why was this happening? Maybe he's sick?
Blaise did the same thing as before and mixed on his own, smiling at the success of the dough this time. Without another word he slaps the dough on the cookie sheet like he did before, make the lemon glaze, and practically stalked the cookies in the oven. All while Hunter desperately tries to make conversation.
"I missed you too!" Neville says, holding onto Blaise for dear life. He took in his scent. He smelled of flowers, pine, and chocolate. He missed that smell.
"Ah, not enough liquid. Try to add some more lemon juice and vanilla extract." Hunter suggests, which Blaise does.
"Neville Longbottom." Neville says, earning laughs from Voldemort and his cult. If it weren't for Luna, Blaise would be storming towards them and hitting every single one of them with a hex right about now.
"Yet here we both are." Harry retorts. "Draco, drop the wand. I'm not going to attack you. Not again." He promises calmly.
He can feel his heartbeat go from normal to crazy within seconds. When Harry enlances their hands and tightens his grip, it seems to go even crazier. He can't speak nor can he move.
"Now--Mr. Malfoy! Care to explain--Mr. Potter?! Oh, good grief! I demand to know why you two are late!" Professor McGonagall demands.
"What the hell is your problem, Potter?" Draco growls. "Don't you understand that I don't want you here?! I don't want anyone here! Leave!"
Harry was sure of it now. He was wrong. He still tried to convince himself he cared nothing about Draco even as a soft smile found a way onto his face.
"Blaise?" Neville asks. Blaise hums in response.  He takes a shaky breath and says, "I think I might... Love you."
"I... uh," He whispers, "I h-have y-your stuff." At this point he wishes he put on the bracelet before this. It seems to have some magical power that makes him confident.
Gregory Hullons, the Auror in the room, walks with Harry out into the hallway of the Ministry. His eyes are met with Draco's and Draco stands abruptly.
Harry's head pops up, "Huh? Oh... nothing I just..." He sighs, "I don't know who I am now." He nearly whispers.
Blaise puts some on his fingers and rubs it onto Draco's wrist and neck. Draco looks at him like he is crazy, but he continues on.
He ignored him and stomped inside the room. As Snape closed the door, he began shouting. "What the hell is this?!"
"Good." Draco glances down and notices a large snake slithering across the floor towards the Dark Lord as he moves around the room as if he was floating. To his loyal followers it would look beautiful, but to Draco it was something that would haunt him until he dropped into his grave.
"Madame Hooch couldn't even teach me! Every time I try I fail at it. Please, let me just ride on the broom with you." He begs.
"Of course. I won't just blindly trust him, but I do have hope that he's actually learning. Who knows? Maybe he'll apologize to you and Hermione soon." Harry predicts, making Ron scoff.
"Oh, yeah! Come on, Blaise." Pansy says, walking out of the great hall with Blaise following behind her.
He is pulled away from the castle and the other death eaters join them. His Aunt apparates them back to the Manor where his parents and the Dark Lord sit there waiting for them. He gulps.
"Then he just stopped talking to me. I don't know why." Harry says. Pansy holds back a laugh. He is such a terrible liar.
"Thanks, Harry." Draco says with a real smile this time. "I guess it is less stupid than crying over a card." He jokes.
He suddenly realizes that Neville really is happy with Hannah. He can't take that away from him, that wouldn't be real love. Besides, seeing Neville happy is the only thing that gives him joy. He decides at once that he is fine with them falling in love if that's what Neville needs. After this present, he will never interact with Neville ever again, that's his promise to himself. If he truly loves Neville, he will keep that promise.
He still couldn't believe he was dumb enough to believe Harry Potter could've actually cared about him and wanted to help. Then again, he wasn't wrong about Draco being the one to curse Katie Bell. However, he wasn't meaning to get Katie, he meant to get Dumbledore. That didn't matter anymore anyways.
Blaise leans in and whispers, "You'll learn, my darling. I'll even teach you if you want," He chuckles and makes Neville's heart flutter. "But even if you weren't able to learn I still wouldn't care. I love it and I love you, so so much."
He kicks off into the air and flies through the clouds. He tries to remember where to find Luna's home. With many misdirections and twists and turns, he finally is met with the sight of Luna's house under the stars.
"Ouch!" Harry holds his chest dramatically, which earns a chuckle from Ginny. He smiles and puts his hands in his pockets. "Merry Christmas, by the way."
She came into the hospital wing the next day after she had begged Neville to go there and get tests done.
Blaise pulls away with his hands up, noticing Neville's cheeks were more red than before. "I stopped. Happy now?" Neville sighs annoyedly with a grin plastered upon his once frowning face. Blaise considers his mission accomplished.
Still, not once response, not even a shift of his body. He told himself not to panic, but all he could feel was panic. Something was wrong, very wrong.
He groans in pleasure and snakes his arm around Harry's waist. He could feel Harry smile against his lips.
He bumps into someone and his things scatter all over the floor. Draco grunts in annoyance. Oh no, it's even worse... It's Harry Potter he ran into. He knows he promised to be nicer, but that doesn't mean he can't hate him in silence.
"Well... Maybe it'll sound incredibly cheesy and sappy but... Neville does! He's always so adorable with his clumsiness and he has the cutest smiles. I just love him to death." Blaise can almost be certain he's smiling like an idiot. "Maybe you should go now, Draco."
She knew he'd never say anything himself, so she devised a plan. But, Xavier had found out she had gotten a veritaserum potion and offered her money if she shared it. She couldn't turn it down! The only other thing she needs to do was make Harry jealous.
She liked Draco, yes, but matchmaking was definitely more her passion. Who cares about Draco when you can scheme and get a couple together?! That was exactly what she was going to do.
"Look, I'm not in the damn mood for your teasing. I just want to leave and forget this ever happened and completely forget Potter exists. So let me go." Draco demands.
He pulls at it and it reveals a very small room with a small pillar in the middle. The pillar held a red pillow, which Blaise walked towards. The looked on it and found a golden bracelet that sported a metallic lions head right in the middle. Right on the left and right sides of the mane were accent of tiny orange and white gems. Blaise smiles wide. This seems perfect for Neville! But... how is it calming? He didn't feel calm at all...
Malfoy was up to something, he was sure of it. Katie's friends told him all about Katie's run in with some deadly necklace. If he was correct, it must have been Malfoy considering how he ran away when he saw him talking with one of Katie's friends. Him and Ron talked about how strange Malfoy has been acting and Harry quickly forgot about all the supposed feelings he must have had for him. He must've known it wasn't a "truth" potion at all. If anything, he ingested the potion at the last minute to make Harry seem foolish, to embarrass him later on. Maybe... just maybe it's also something more sinister. Malfoy and his father weren't much different. Not to mention that no Slytherin ever has had good intentions. He only hoped Blaise was an exception.
He stands still then slowly moves towards the sight of Draco's shoes. As he gets closer he can hear the soft cries. He gasps as he catches sight of blood mixing with water and flowing down the tiled floor. He looks behind the wall separating him and Draco and his eyes widen.
Blaise stares after her in wonder. Damn Ravenclaws. They're the only ones that could be a match for Slytherins. It's like they know everything. It was damn horrific.
He looked over at the Slytherin table, noticing Blaise was gone. He could only help but wonder... Why was he searching for Blaise? Why did he care if he was there or not? It's not like Blaise, or any Slytherin at all, would care if he was there or not. But the need to search for him kept pestering his mind. He sighs and takes a bite of his toast and simply stares at the dark wood of the table. A sense of loneliness plagued him suddenly, however, he was quite used to that.
"Yes he can." A voice says behind them. He turns around and smiles. Many people from the Order of the Phoenix including Professor Lupin, Mister Weasley, Misses Wealsey, and many others. "We've got his back." says Tonks with a smile.
He rushes that way and finds it almost instantly. He locks himself in and takes a deep breath. Why did he get so emotional over that?
A knock on his door startled him. He opens his closet door and quickly goes to open his bedroom door. He is relieved to see that it's only the house-elf Maggie.
"Sorry." Hannah apologizes quietly. She turns back to Neville and smiles happily, "Well, it's about time for dinner."
Xavier Brankwood handed Pansy her one hundred galleons after breakfast. "Pleasure doing business with you." She says.
"Welcome back." A familiar voice said, making him shout. There was his grandmother, waiting for him in a chair with her arms crossed across her chest. "You really thought I wouldn't notice?"
"I'm not leaving until you talk to me." Harry says. "Why are you doing this? You're hurting yourself! I thought you didn't want to be harmed anymore..."
"I have noticed that you haven't been doing your assignment for the dark lord. You know you shouldn't forget about these kind of things." the Professor lectures.
"Can we speak alone?" He asks the woman beside Draco and Gregory Hullons. They both nod and walk away from them, leaving them alone in a silent hallway.
"I don't know if that will work. I tried to talk to him in class and he didn't say a word. Maybe he hates me now."
Draco's eyes go wide. His father must have told Snape to look after him and make sure he does as he is told. Draco says, "I'm sorry! I just got distracted by homework and... other things."
'I need the room with the necklace. I need the room with the necklace.' After saying that in his head one last time, the door slowly appeared in front of him.
He lights his wand again with the spell and a small flame appears. He brings it to his arm, but before he can reach it someone shouts.
He brushes it off for now and says he will ask a teacher. He grabs the bracelet from the pillow, puts it in his pocket, and walks away.
He looked back to Blaise and noticed a soft smile on his lips and a twinkle in his eye as they sat down with the Slytherins. He made it a goal to tease him about it later. However, deep down it made Draco happy to see someone like that. It's not like his father had shown much love to his mother ever. Even though it made him feel much shame, seeing someone look at another person that way with such love made Draco feel hope again.
"Well... We, uh, just started dating so." Neville replies quietly. Well, maybe he shouldn't have said that.
Draco blushes, "What?! No! I... You just s-sc-screamed really loudly..." Now he was stuttering?! Good Merlin.
It was fairly easy to read, other than the occasional messy letters on the page. The sentences seemed to tilt down a bit, which indicated this person wasn't skilled at penmanship. The first line makes Blaise perk up.
"He didn't have a home! He was kicked out by his mother. He would've starved without help." Luna says.
"In that case, here is something else." Hannah fidgets with her hands for a bit before grabbing Neville's face with both hands and pecks his lips. She pulls away and looks at him nervously once again. "Well... I'll see you later."
"No worries. If you feel nervous before tomorrow, just put a bit of this on your neck. You'll get a smell of it occasionally and it will help soothe your nerves." Dumbledore says, handing him the same bottle they used to coat the bracelet.
"Draco!" Harry says, making Draco look at him in shock. "Look, we will get expelled if we fight like this anymore and we have to be partners for the whole year! Can we please just at least be respectful to each other?! We don't have to be friends because I wouldn't want that any more than you would. But please, for the love of Merlin, can we just get along?! Just for this year at the very least, please?!" Harry pleads.
He notices Draco stop right behind a girl talking to Harry. He looks around nervously, catches eyes with Blaise, then walks off quickly. He notices Harry push past the girl and rush after Draco. Blaise sat still, hoping that some way they would settle things. Although, he doubted that since Harry, according to Draco, was now with Ginny. Still, it took strength not to go after Draco as well.
"Of course! To be honest, I wouldn't be happy with the Daily Prophet discussing my love life anyways. They'd probably go ballistic over me dating a boy. I wouldn't want them attacking either of us."
Harry was holding his hand... His hand. Not because they were fighting and he was pushing him away but because he reached for his hand... His hand!
As if his body finally got a mind of its own, he rushed over to Harry's bed and began to shake him awake.
Not that he doesn't have his own mother. They have been bonding recently, him and his mother. But her hugs seemed slightly colder than this one.
For all of his life, the dinners with his mother and father were completely silent and with many rules, most of which the Weasley's were breaking.
He was left baffled, how could he have forgotten his assignment? At this point, he can't care about Harry, he must focus on this. If not, his family can die. If not them, then his father will surely kill him. Who in their right mind forgets about this?!
"First of all, just call him Voldemort. Second, I forgive you. Some of those things you had to do to survive. But, I would appreciate an apology to Ron, his family, and Hermione. As well as any other Gryffindors you bullied."
Harry stares at him with surprise written on his face. Why is everyone suddenly saying things they don't mean to say?
Harry nods and grabs onto his friends, noticing that Ron is hesitant. They all apparate into a living room. On the couch sits Augusta Longbottom.
"People die every day!" Neville shouts, "Friends... family... And yeah... We lost Harry tonight. He may not be here, but he's still with us... in here," Neville says pointing at his chest. "Just like Fred, Remus, Tonks, Dumbledore... But you know what... They didn't die in vain!" He turns to Voldemort, "But you will, because you're wrong! Harry's heart did beat for us, for all of us! It's not over!" He shouts, reaching into the Sorting Hat and pulling out a sword. At the same time Harry drops from Hagrid's arms and onto the ground.
Harry takes a deep breath and raises his wand. "Expecto Patronum!" As Draco expected to happen, a bright blue light pours out of his wand, making the class gasp and Draco rolled his eyes once more. A stag struts around the classroom, running past Draco only inches apart, making him jump a little.
"Get to class! You don't want to be late." Professor McGonagall says, walking quickly past them. "Quickly!" She says right before she turns the corner.
"Good Merlin, fine!" Blaise sighs and leans in to whisper, "I hugged Neville... And we went to Honeydukes together."
He was happy to be at the Burrow for Christmas instead of with the Dursley's, but Ginny kept sneaking glances at him and freaking him out. Not to mention the terrible nightmares that won't go away. However, some of them now involve Draco. It's either Draco getting hurt or dying, or Draco killing or hurting him or his friends.
"Yeah well... Maybe I should talk to you about that. Neville can't even come to Hogwarts to help fix the castle anymore... His grandmother saw us kiss and... Yeah it didn't go so well."
Blaise scoffs, "Really? That's why you think I shouldn't be talking to you?! Draco, that's ridiculous. I admit, I was upset at first, but that was my fault. I didn't take into consideration what your father must have been doing. I for sure didn't try to imagine how bad it must be... When Harry told me I... I was at a loss for words. My anger at you was inconsiderate and wrong, I admit that now. I apologize, mate."
Pansy eventually became good friends with Blaise, Neville, Harry, Draco, and Luna. But, Luna is her best friend. She now runs a match-making business and is called Match-making Pansy. She is pretty popular, actually, but Draco and Harry get annoyed with her constant brags about getting them together. She remains single and happy in her small, but comfortable, flat/apartment.
Instead, Blaise rolled his eyes and grabbed his things along with Neville's. Without another word, he began to walk out the door, only to be stopped by a spell swirling towards him.
"Very smart of you Draco.... Now listen to me. I knew someone just like you. He was special, had a good heart. But he made all the wrong decisions. I know what you're going through. Please, let me help you."
Draco then looks up at Blaise and shakes his head. Blaise looks at him in curiousity. He catches sight of Pansy who is smirking at him from afar.
Another voice came in from behind him, "He's too stupid. Or perhaps he's just too nervous around his little crush."
"Come on, Harry!" Hermione says, smiling at me as she walks out. Ron gives Draco a glare and follows after Hermione.
"No she didn't!" Blaise exclaims, "That's what her little smirks were for?! I honestly suspected that she knew I had a 'thing' for Neville. I didn't expect her to think it was you." He sighs in exhaustion.
"It's lavender. It will calm you down a bit. I don't think it will stop any urges, but I think it can keep you from panicking and keep you levelled." Blaise says.
Neville simply laughs humorlessly. Somehow none of his fellow Gryffindors got the message but he was glad to see them rushing to their dorms and saying goodbye. Neville sighed in relief and laid his head on the table, grunting softly in dispair. Trevor jumped onto his back and croaked into Neville's ear.
Pansy scoffs and gets up, leaving the great hall. Everyone looks at him in either shock, disgust, or confusion. He just didn't care anymore. If his father wouldn't cut off his inheritance and possibly disown him, he'd tell every one of them to piss off. He felt a pair of eyes on him and he looks around, his grey eyes meeting a pair of green ones. Harry Potter... For god's sake.
"So," He drawls out the o before continuing, "You can't just throw love away! Chase it! Don't let it die!"
P.S. I choose to not answer to those guesses. I apologize, but I don't wish to say anything about it. Talk to you later!"
He wanted to push him away, get him out of his face but he was frozen. How did he get such emerald eyes? Is that even humanly possible? "Cat got your tongue, ferret?" Harry smirks. "Watch who you talk to like that." And with that, he stomps away.
"Harry, you'll never guess who killed the last Horcrux." Ron says and Harry simply gives him a look of confusion.
He was hungry, terribly and dreadfully hungry. All he found was old stale crackers and moldy bread. His mother had gone somewhere with her boyfriend, but he assumed they were eating nice warm food.
He turns the handle and is met with a very disorganized room. The same room he found almost a year ago. He smirks. Perfect.
His hand shook and he opened his mouth, but nothing came out. Dumbledore turned around and looked at Draco with the same calm expression he always had.
"You don't owe anyone anything, let alone the Gryffindors. The only person that needs to know about this is you and the only person that has the right to tell you what to do is yourself."
"Fine, then if you're speaking the truth, what do you think of me?" Harry smirks as if he was a genius.
He struggles to get back up and sees Harry, Hermione, and Ron right above them, flying on brooms. Harry reaches his hand out and Draco tries to grab it, only to miss it. He flies away and worries that they won't come back. But no, they come back. He reaches his hand out again and this time, he catches Harry's hand and is pulled onto the broom. He looks back to see Crabbe with Ron.
"Well, I first thought it was Draco because of all these people saying that but... then you said Gryffindor and herbology and I instantly knew. I'm guessing it's the guy with the toad... uh, Trevell?"
"Oh yeah. That's rough, friend. Scoop out parts of the dough and put it on the sheet! Anyways, what if he finds out who you are? Won't it be awkward, especially with the Gryffindor and Slytherin rivalry?"
"Ok, that's good. Let's go then." Hannah says awkwardly, getting onto her broom with Neville following shortly after.
They were fighting, every single one of them. All Blaise could hear was screaming, banging, and crashing. He couldn't find Neville. He tried to stay close to him and make sure he could save him if he needed to. He had him close by, but now he was gone. He ran through the halls, fighting off any caster who came in his way. He was able to knock some of them out pretty quickly, but others he had to take his time to duel.
"I don't know..." Instinctively, he squeezes Blaise's hand. He warmth of his skin felt nice on his. Without meaning to, he says, "You're warm."
Blaise reaches in his pocket, pulling out the right amount of galleons and handing it to the lady. She puts it all in a bag and hands it to him. "Come back again!" She says happily.
"Well we asked your mother what you'd want to eat and she said you were never able to have this for some reason... So we made it! We had to ask Blaise himself what he wanted, so he didn't get a surprise but... Surprise!" Molly says happily.
"Me too. He seems to feel better. I hope he keeps doing this... It might be a good distraction for him." Blaise says.
Blaise scoffs, "Are you serious?!" Blaise steps closer to him, "You really think you're such a savior. When really you're anything but that! Neville is picked on every day and you don't do anything! None of Gryffindors do anything! Yet you expect them to stick up for him if I happened to mess with him?! How thick can you be?! They won't do it for Neville, but they surely will do it for you because you're the Golden Boy and all Nev gets is a sack of shit thrown at his face every day..." Blaise narrows his eyes, "Fuck you, Potter." He spits.
Draco looks at the paper Blaise was holding earlier and notices it's a receipt. "It says you bought nine of them!"
"Stop it! Just stop it, stop it, stop it!" Draco shouts, clenching his hands in fists, "I hate this stupid pity party everyone is giving me! I'm no charity and I for sure don't need charity! So what? My father was an arse, that doesn't mean I want people talking to me like I'm some hopeless little child who needs to be saved! I hate it! It might sound bad, but I want people to hate me! Or at least treat me like a normal person and not some weak boy who can't take care of himself. I didn't get charity before and I don't need it now!"
"Wow, I didn't know Blaise had such empathy for other people." Pansy says, a mischievious grin wide on her face.
Draco touches his cheeks, feeling that they're wet. He wipes his eyes quickly. "I'm not! Now go away you disgusting creep." He insults.
"After the Yule ball, or whenever I find the other things to give... It just seems so empty without something else. I don't know what else to do, though." Blaise sighs.
If she was truly terrible, she would've gotten angry and planned revenge on Draco for liking Harry. However, she came to realize that it was a completely valid reason to why her efforts to get Draco herself never worked. He was gay! No wonder! Every other boy was too desperate to turn her down, but not Draco.
"Says the person who claimed themselves as royalty since day one when really, no one knows him and he's nothing but a pathetic excuse for a wizard," Harry smirks back.
"Alright, Draco, the tests for love potions all came back negative..." Madame Pomfrey says before giving him a knowing smile. He blushes heavily. "No need to feel ashamed. However, I do have a theory, which means we must test it, of course!"
Suddenly, much to his dismay, he begins to sob. Blaise grabs his arm and pulls him towards an empty classroom.
He turned around and held his wand right up to Harry's face. Thinking quickly, Harry grabs his wand, but Draco was fast. He throws the first spell, which Harry dodges.
He also hopes he will completely forget Draco exists soon before he loses his mind. He couldn't help but wonder: What in the world is wrong with me?!
"Holly berries," Blaise says and the entrance opens. Harry follows quickly behind them and tries to follow Blaise, only to get blocked by Pansy Parkinson and some Slytherin he knew nothing about.
"You aren't, you can't be! It just isn't possible. You're a Slytherin! You're strong, Draco. I can see that in you. You're not like Filch, that's for sure. Don't put yourself down. And don't forget that I am your friend. If they don't care and if that dud in there doesn't care, then I will. You can count me on that. You can always come to me when you need someone, whether that is someone to rant to or a friend, I'm here. I will never ever not keep that promise." Blaise says.
The Auror looks at Draco and asks him to show any other bruises or injuries he must have. He took unbottoned his shirt and noticed for the first time in a while just how many bruises he had gotten. His whole torso was covered in black and blue. He is given permission to button his shirt back up, which he does and then the Auror quickly steps back inside and brings them with him.
He stepped into the Great Hall alone, kind of wishing Blaise wasn't so busy with whatever he was doing so he wouldn't feel like a loser.
They all stood below the council, Draco's heart beating so heavily it nearly bursted from his chest.
He grabbed Blaise by the robes and dragged him outside. Oh no, Draco thought. The last time this happened was to Draco when he kept giving Snape sneers and dragged him outside the room by his ear and shouted at him for thirty minutes straight. Harry seemed to know the feeling too. Harry stared at the door in horror. Something bad was going to happen.
"Thank you for being my friend." Blaise says with a sad smile. They both embrace each other in a tight hug and Blaise can feel Draco softly sobbing, but he doesn't say a word. Instead, he begins to sob with him. After all, this is the first real hug he has gotten since he was five years old.
Blaise is right! His grandmother can't tell him who to love or see! She sure can keep him from it, but that can't stop him.
The flames morph into a dragon-like figure and roar at him and Crabbe. Goyle continues to throw flames from his wand with little care. Crabbe and Draco try to get away from the flames and climb up various objects to get away. The flames only get higher.
"Are you kidding?! Who cares about me?! The boy you've been pining over for years is dating you and you expect me to just return to what we were talking about before?"
Xavier chuckles, "Right! How could I forget?! So, we heard about his little wishful admiration of you and we told him you told us you'd rather eat shit than be seen with him and how disgusted you were when we talked about him with you. You should've seen his face! I think he was about to cry." Xavier finishes shaking his head. "How could anyone so weak be in Gryffindor?"
Suddenly the pressure on his chest vanishes and he can breathe again. He takes many deep breaths and closes his eyes.
"Yes indeed he did. It was getting pretty annoying. He also mentioned how nervous he is around you? I dunno... Hopefully that doesn't make things weird between you." Pansy says.
"You both mean so much to me." Draco cries. "I worry I'll lose you any moment now." He chuckles humorlessly.
Blaise narrows his eyes at him, "Aren't you supposed to be in that bed until they figure out what's wrong with you?"
"Thank you. Keep him safe please. And no, no Blaise. If he happens to show up I'll tell you." Augusta says.
"Thank you! I love it here as well." Dumbledore says with twinkling eyes and a warm smile. It almost made Neville calm down, almost.
A weird thought entered his head. What if he grabbed his hand? No, that's weird. But he really wanted to.
He gulps and hesitantly walks toward him. He slowly raises his left sleeve. Without warning, he points his wand to the arm and a stabbing pain is sent through his veins, making him grunt in pain. Slowly, almost as if black ink was running over his arm, the dark mark made its way into his skin.
"Thank you." Draco says, looking up at Blaise with the smile still plastered onto his face. "And, Blaise?" Blaise raises his eyebrow in response, "Talk to me whenever you need to and if you need someone to smuggle you some food from the house elves before the year ends." Draco smiles wider.
"Harry!" Lupin shouts, making Harry look up. "Why don't you come up here?" Draco rolls his eyes once again. Of course, Harry needs a moment of glory.
"But... I tortured you for years, I threatened you in the Room of Requirment, I beat you up in class, and I joined the Dark Lord. There are many other things I did... Not to mention I tortured your friends too. All for some petty rivalry." Draco says.
Draco could hear her complain about how she failed the task over and over again. He just wanted her to shut the bloody hell up. He would've casted a hex on her if it wouldn't have landed him in Dumbledore's office. Good Merlin, he never wanted to go back there.
"I'm so-" He is cut off by a sharp collision of his shoulder to his father's cane. His eyes began to burn and his vision got blurry. He tried to stop it, but it just hurt so much. He felt tears flowing down his face and felt as if he was naked.
"He has a boyfriend to pay attention to and I'd probably just be a burden. I'd definitely be a third wheel with them as well." says Draco.
There was only one time he spoke to someone, and that was Harry. But he declined his request to join them in the Gryffindor common room, even after he told him Blaise wanted him there.
He tried to breathe as to not cry or scream, or whatever his body might try to do to react to this fury he felt inside of him. After everything that happened between them?!
"Now... gently kick off the ground." Blaise says. Neville looks at Blaise and shakes his head. "If anything happens, I got you, alright? I won't let you get hurt." Blaise assures.
He kept looking at Blaise, and he looked back. Why couldn't he look away?! He notices Blaise's lips curl up into a small smile. Neville almost smiles back, but he somehow contains himself and instead narrows his eyes at Blaise and looks back down at his plate, praying that no one notices his cheeks are red. Well, at least they felt red, he was hoping they weren't though.
Maggie rushes out the door, not failing to close it behind her. That's another thing he loves about Maggie, other than her kindness, she always closes the door behind her. She was also the only one who paid attention to him at all. Dobby was nice as well, but he was annoying and would often rat him out. Maggie never did, but she also hurt herself a lot for that very reason.
- Neville: Lion (happiest memory: when his mother had gotten better and could speak to him. Originally was the moments he had with Blaise before and after they started dating)
Draco takes a shaky sigh, "I... You... Look, I can't tell you. No one knows ok. If anyone knew I'd... They-"
He rushes back into the castle and kisses Blaise goodbye. Everything was perfectly fine... until he looked over and saw his grandmother standing right there. Both him and Blaise look at her in horror.
"I know what you're thinking about..." Myrtle says, "I know because last time you looked just like this."
Blaise sits in front of him with a smirk plastered on his face. "How are you?" He seemed to lose all sense of thought and the English language.
"That would be a great idea! We'll all go to the Burrow tomorrow and set it up. Hopefully Mr. Weasley won't be upset with a Malfoy being at his house... but I'm sure I can help him understand the situation. It would be good for him and all of us!" Harry suggests.
You may be saying 'what if Harry feels nothing for Draco!' Well, that isn't the case either. She tried to flirt with Draco in front of him, and he reacted exactly how she hoped. It was confirmed when they caught eyes and Harry turned his head quickly.
"I wanted to tell you but I was afraid you'd be mad or hate me or... ask me about my sexuality." Neville says.
He couldn't stop thinking about what would've happened if he just kissed Neville right then and there, but it isn't that easy, it never will be. It would also be incredibly inappropriate and rude considering he was with the girlfriend he is clearly happy with. He thought he was finally at peace with it, but he isn't. Their encounter last night proves that. He blasted the music in his room without regard to what his mother will do if she hears it when she comes back through the door. But knowing her, she wouldn't be back for hours, maybe days, maybe weeks. If he was lucky, maybe even months.
"You're ignoring the key issue here, Mister Malfoy. You beat on your own son, often for unnecessary reasons. Even if it was necessary, you beat him far too harshly. I believe you threw him down the stairs once?" Harry says, "And for what reason? Because he couldn't dodge a spell?! You disgust me." Harry snaps. He turns to the judge, "Permission to leave, sir?"
However, he knew he wouldn't always be able to escape it. There would always be a time when he was a laughing stock to the whole school, or even perhaps the whole wizarding world. It was saddening, but it was true. It was worthless to go and mope about it when it was all he would ever be. It's not like he'd find a woman and settle down and get a great job and be well-liked. That'd never happen. He was unattractive and unsuccessful. Everything he did he managed to fail at, especially potions. Trying was worthless, however, he still continued to try. How stupid of him. He was not only wasting his time but the time of every other person around him.
"Of course not. Why would I even want that a little bit?!" Harry retorts. Draco gasps which makes Harry smirk. "Come on, we gotta go to class."
At the mention of his rival, his heart speeds up. He kept begging for it to calm down, but it wouldn't. As soon as he dropped his bag on the ground beside Draco, they made eye contact. That only made his nerves crazier.
"I don't know... Not long ago. But I did once hit myself to stop myself from crying after father hit me... I didn't do it again though until this week. It's been making everything shockingly easier." Draco says. "Now will you let go of my bloody hand?"
"Stupify!" Someone shouted. Draco had no strength nor care to see who it was. He didn't want to know who was seeing this happen. Once they realized it was a boggart, he would be laughed at until graduation.
"W-we could try to..." He whispers, "We can try it..." He leans in even closer, licking his lips slightly.
"He'd be delighted to know. If you ever want to say so yourself, he's in Hufflepuff. His name is Hunter. He's pretty easy to find considering he's the only Hunter in the whole school." Luna informs.
"Night, Luna." He silently walks up the steps as he stares down at his feet. Well, at least he was getting cookies.
"Well it's two things, one is about Harry and the other about Neville." At the mention of Neville's name, Blaise's eyebrows raise.
Neville nervously raises his hand. "Come up, Neville," Lupin says with a smile. Neville slowly makes his way to the front and stands in silence for a little.
"Well... I don't know. But I'd like to maybe... try to be together. Maybe we can go to the Yule Ball together next week?" Neville suggests.
They all stood outside, a crying Hagrid holding a limp Harry in his arms. It can't be what he thinks.
He runs into the great hall, only to notice that most eyes were on him, some giggling and some gazing in disgust and dissapproval, at least that's what it looked like. Yet, he was filled with confusion. Why was everyone looking at him. Then, he caught sight of Neville who was right in front of Hannah Abbott, being one of the few not looking up at him, other than Draco and Harry. He was scratching his neck and staring down at his plate with a look of defeat.
Draco looks at Blaise, who is now staring at the floor. He gets up and closes the compartment door, casts muffliato and sits back down. "Everything will be ok," He says, not only to Blaise, but himself as well.
Blaise makes his way to Dumbledore's office. He had asked Professor Snape if it was possible to make a bracelet that calms the wearer at all times. Snape suggested that Dumbledore would know more about that, so that's where he is going.
"No, I can't do that! If I just give him cookies someone else made what kind of present is that?! No way, I am doing this until I get it right, even if it burns this kitchen down. Got it?" Blaise affirms, dumping the old cookies in the trash and quickly grabbing the dough ingredients once more. Hunter simply sat there watching him, pretty much baffled at his outburst.
"Sherbet lemon, dear." She says, her eyes bulging behind her glasses. He nods and rushes away. That woman was weird.
Harry leans in to smell next. "Vanilla, fresh laundry, and... Ink?" Harry says. He then looks down at his desk with his eyes wide.
"Hermione!" says the round red-headed woman he's seen many times before. "Oh, it's so amazing to see you. I see you've brought some new faces here!" Her eyes meet his own and he begins to worry for a minute, until she gives him a bright smile and says, "Draco, how wonderful to truly meet you." She reaches towards him and gives him a warm hug.
"Well, uh, it's from Louis Vellios. He only made one cologne, so that'll be easy for you." He says quietly.
Luna begged him to apparate to her home after they'd buried Dobby. So, that's what they did. They showed up in her garden and he noticed the tiny house that was beside their own was now gone.
He gains enough adrenaline to catch up to him and tackle him to the floor. Draco is laying on his back and gets up on his knees. He pins Harry's hands to the ground.
"Take it. It's the least I can do. You've been so respectful and you deserve it!" Dumbledore pushes it into Blaise's hand and leans back into his chair. "Now, get to the Great Hall. It's almost lunch time!"
"Now get out." His father demands. Draco walks out, shocked that he managed to make it out of there without pain.
Draco's tough demeanor nearly washes away, but he holds onto it like it was the only thing keeping him from falling to his death. "No. You're always in my way, always in my business. Get out of it and get out of my life!" Draco shouts.
His eyes meet those of Blaise Zabini and he suddenly feels nervous. "U-uh, h-hey!" Neville stutters.
"Eww, Merlin no!" Draco shouts, almost vomiting on spot. Not only was she not at all attractive, but her obsession with Potter was even more sickening. Wow, there's another sign of how unbelievably oblivious he was to his attraction to him.
The next morning everyone received their owls from their parents. Draco was no exception. He opened up the letter to reveal his father's neat handwriting. His eyes searched for the Malfoy crest and they landed right on it. 'What new hidden message does he have now?' Draco asks himself. He hopes it isn't anything bad, even though he knows it is. Draco leaves the Great Hall and enters an empty bathroom.
"Thank you!" Blaise smiles big and hugs Harry. "I owe you one, scar head!" He pats his back and runs out of the library.
George Weasley simply ignores it and shoves more food into his mouth. Other people might've thought it was gross, but Draco saw it as hilarious and admirable. They didn't have a care in the world.
Neville looks at him suspiciously. Is this why Luna was asking for him? Did she somehow persuade him to join the good side or is he just here to trick them?
"I'm sorry." He apologized, looking up to see that he was much more familiar. He was face to face with Blaise Zabini once more.
Draco remembers his father coming out of the room, his teeth barred and trying desperately to get away from the Aurors holding him back. He didn't remember anything after that except a dreadful fear that his father would get loose and beat him to his grave.
His Aunt's squeaky, manic laughter fills the tower. She twirls around the room, running to the railing and hold up her wand. She sends flashes of green light in the sky. He looks up, seeing the dark mark form in the clouds. Nothing but darkness fills the world around him.
Madame Pomfrey gasps as well, "I must speak to him. Be right back." With that, she speeded out of the infirmary, leaving Draco all alone to plan his revenge on Blaise.
He sits down beside her at the kitchen table and she turns to him, "Neville, you've been acting weird lately. Is everything ok?"
"It's not a big deal anymore. It's over with. I doubt I'll ever see my father after this." Draco says, "So just drop it. Besides, the person probably hates me now."
Harry gives him a look of curiousity, so he continues on. "You saved my life... Twice actually." He looks at the ground and mutters, "And saved me from that boggart."
"Wait... Were you out on a date?" Harry smirks, remembering how everyone was talking about Neville and Luna dating.
After long talks and many sips of hot chocolate, they paid and went on their way. When he was walking out the door he collided with a tall man.
"Well, I'll uh... See you tomorrow." Blaise says, turning on his heels and walking away without another word.
Neville simply sighs. Professor Snape speaks up, "Longbottom, you just earned a deduction of fifty points for your idiotcy! If that potion would've had an effect we would've all been in grave danger! What were you thinking?!"
"Uh... well... First of all, I want a promise." Blaise says. Luna simply looks at him with her eyebrow raised, so he continues. "I want you to promise that nothing we speak about is repeated." Blaise says.
Blaise scoffs and pushes past him and back into the classroom. He finds people staring at him from all angles, but he doesn't seem to care.
"Tomorrow at five Hermione will come to bring you, Luna, Draco and Neville to the Burrow. Be ready." Harry says.
Draco was finding his way back in the room after visiting the common room. He wanted a nice quiet place to study, and the Slytherin common room seemed to be the right place. Shockingly enough, only a few people were there, which made it even better.
They would lock eyes on occassion, but they wouldn't keep eye contact for longer than a millisecond.
Draco sighs, "It's not you, that's for sure. I know why you didn't stand with me and I'm ok with it. But I honestly feel like you shouldn't be talking to me."
"Uh... Ok." Neville watches as Dumbledore sits at his desk and Neville chooses a chair in front of him. "Y-you have a nice office..." Neville says.
"Don't talk to me! You're just here to ruin my life like the rest of them! I don't want to be your friend and I never will want to be your friend!" Neville shouts through tears, "I knew it was all a trick!" Blaise stares at the floor without another word.
Neville's mood elevates when he catches sight of Blaise. He walks up to the table and takes a seat, not once taking his eyes away from the floor. Neville fidgets with his fingers for a while before hesitantly tapping Blaise on the arm.
"You need to concentrate more. The wand doesn't control you, you control it." Lupin says to Neville.
Hannah looks slightly dissapointed but she still smiles. "Of course! I'd love to see how we would work out. Maybe this can also get those Slytherins off your back."
Draco watches them argue silently from the other side of the table and smiles softly, yet he can't help but feel envious. He never had a family like theirs, but it's often what he would wish for. He feels even more stupid for shaming the Weasley's before. Maybe it's just because they had everything he didn't.
"Well... I've never told anyone so this is a little nerve-wracking." He chuckles once more, "So... There's this boy who has always kinda been you know... Kinda an underdog I guess you could say. He's always so nervous it's kinda adorable." Blaise grins wide.
The next day was just as expected. Everyone and their mother was talking about Neville Longbottom. Luckily for Neville, he was no where to be seen.
"Fine, but after I tell you, we turn back to the original subject. Got it?" Draco nods to him and he takes a deep breath, "Neville and I are together."
"You're asking me if I'm alright? I told you not to be weird, Potter." Draco turns his head back to the front of the class, ignoring Harry's annoyed sigh.
"Hi, it's Neville. Thank you for the Christmas Present. I really enjoyed it and the blanket really helps, as does everything else. By the way, where did you find that bracelet? It's really nice. As for your feelings, I've talked to my friend Luna about it and she says they're real and she also says you're a boy. If you're wondering how I feel about that, I'm ok with it. I'm also ok with you giving me a present. You seem like a really nice person, maybe we could be friends? If not, that's ok I just needed you to know that I am very grateful. Those cookies were delicious. I assumed you were Hunter Bruton from Hufflepuff, but Luna assured me that I was wrong about that. Maybe you're a Hufflepuff? I really wish I knew who you were. I may not feel the same, but I'd love to talk to you in person at least once. Regardless, thank you for everything, especially the letter. It did make me feel special."
"I tried to stop it! I really did! I worried that... if... I did it... you would both hate me... I would be a dissa-appointment." Draco says through sobs, "But I couldn't stop! It wouldn't go away no matter what I did! It wanted to rip my hair out!" Draco shouts.
"You utter disgrace!" His father shouts at him. He holds back the tears and the urge to cover his ears like a little child. "You think I wouldn't know?!" His heartbeat increases. He can't be talking about Harry. "How dare you try to escape this!" He relaxes a bit. "Do you even want to be a part of this family?! Huh?! If you try to go to the good side I will kill you." His father says, gritting his teeth and leaning towards Draco threateningly.
"Right..." Draco stands up, putting his bag over his shoulder, and grabs his things, leaving the classroom as soon as he could. If he keeps acting like this, people will know. He has to be stronger than this. He could hide everything else, why can't he hide this better?!
"It's Draco, I'm just making sure I can come in." He replied. Harry replied with a yes and Draco walked in with a sigh.
"Blimey, it's been crazy out there. Some seventh years can't even come to Hogwarts because they're muggle-borns!" Dean informs.
"You seem to have a security problem, Headmaster... How dare you stand where he stood?!" Harry shouts at him. "Tell them what you did! How you looked him in the eyes and killed him!"
"We'll let you two talk alone." Neville says, letting go of Blaise's hand, giving Blaise a smile and walking away with Luna and Harry following closely behind.
"Let's get him to Saint Mungo's." Narcissa says, holding him up bridal style and carrying him away. Either Narcissa is incredibly strong, or Draco is incredibly skinny. He hopes for Narcissa's strength to be the reason.
Blaise releases Neville's hand and rushes after him. He notices him going into the second floor bathroom... but why?
"Huh? No... why would he?" Neville asks, his heart beating quickly at the mention of Blaise. He wonders if they know anything about his weird affections towards him, but realizes that would be ridiculous to think they'd know anything.
"Ok then, you will get a hint. Here is one: I am not a Gryffindor nor am I a Hufflepuff. Also, there is a Z in my name, but you'll have to figure out if its in my first or last name. Also, we have talked before, but not too much. That's all I will give you for now. But don't stress over it too much. Besides, I'm probably not the best for you."
He stands up and tries to run away, but is kicked down by his father. He glances back at him when he is halfway up, but it was a big mistake. His father takes his cane and pushes it into his back, pulling him back down to the ground and definitely leaving a bruise.
He walked into Borgin and Burkes that Hogsmeade weekend, sighing heavily before he walked to the back, meeting the cold glare of his father.
"But... Why? Why would you like me? I'm not much to look at at all and I'm boring for sure. Why in the world would you like me?" Neville asks.
Hermione, with tears streaming down her eyes rushes to Neville and hugs him tight, sobbing into his shoulder.
"Maybe... I definitely could try." Blaise says, "Oh, uh, Neville I need to ask you something." Blaise mutters to him.
Blaise suddenly walks out with a sneer painted on his face and is followed by Draco. Maybe Blaise hates him now?
The next day Neville sat in the library eating a pastry and drinking a tea. A Slytherin sat in the chair nearest to him.
He pointed a finger right at Blaise and said softly, but rather horrifically, "You better watch yourself, Mister Zabini. You wouldn't want your mother finding out, huh?"
"I'm sorry," Blaise says, giving Neville a soft glance. "I-if it makes you feel better... W-we can be slow friends, ya know. Maybe I can prove to you that I have good intentions." He suggests.
Harry stares at Blaise with wide eyes, "Uh... Not really undying. If Madame Pomfrey discovers what happened it'll be gone... Whatever it is. Wonder who spiked his drink." Harry says awkwardly.
He heard voices. From who, he didn't know. He made his way up the steps as saw Dumbledore standing there alone, looking at the sky.
His hand shakes as he gives it to his owl and it flies away. He lays back down on his bed and cries more. He didn't understand why it hurt so much. Why did it feel like he was going to die?
Draco walked into potions, head held high as usual. "Hello, Mr. Malfoy." Professor Snape says to him without expression.
Harry darts his eyes from her to his friends and says, "I'll talk to you guys later." He pushes past them and walks all the way to the bottom of the hall where no one would hear them.
"Friends?" Neville asked, looking up at Blaise with innocence in his eyes. Blaise thought he might die.
His face heats up as he remembers Blaise smiling down at him and calling him 'Nev.' It was terribly embarrassing. It was even worse that he felt this strange twisting feeling in his stomach.
"Oh... Oh!" Hunter exclaims as Blaise adds a tiny bit more vanilla into the bowl. Oddly enough, that did the trick and he smiled brightly.
"No!" He shouts, rushing to the oven and opening it to reveal hard, unedible brown cookies. He slams the cookie sheet on the table and groans. "Are you kidding me?!"
Neville softly whimpered. Nothing was going to change. Surely enough Blaise would kick the bloody hell out of him if he messed anything up. It was surely over for him.
Harry stares at him, suddenly feeling the urge to right hook the boy just as Hermione did in third year. "Say that one more time, I dare you."
Something then happened to Draco, something he couldn't decide whether he liked or not. On one hand, it took his mind off of everything that just happened. On the other hand, he had no idea what it meant and it honestly made him feel strange. His whole body seemed to tingle and his stomach did flips. Maybe he was in shock?
Blaise nods, dips his fingers into the bottle and rubs the liquid all around the now cold golden bracelet.
Harry sighs, "Listen, I know what it's like to be afraid... And if your boggart says anything, I know what it's also like to have a terrible family."
"Definitely. We'll always make sure you get the help and love you deserve. That's a promise." Harry says.
Snape began the lesson on the Draught of Peace and Neville tried hard to pay attention to every word, but he simply couldn't. He never could. That's why he was such a failure. His mind just wasn't good enough.
Professor McGonagall shows up in the doorway, "Neville Longbottom?" He looks up and she beckons him to come with her. He stands up, grabs his things and follows her down the hall. "You're going to see Professor Dumbledore, he has something important to tell you." They stand in front of the gargoyle guarding Dumbledore's office. She says the password and leads him up the steps.
"Look at that, Neville! Maybe now you'll stop complaining about that pathetic blanket." Seamus remarks, but Neville didn't listen.
But he didn't want to think about that, it only made him hate himself more. So instead, he drowned his sorrows with firewhiskey.
"Go up to him and tell us if that is Harry Potter." His Aunt demands and he obeys. He slowly makes his way to the boy, kneeling down in front of him.
"Well, first of all make sure it looks nice. Second, make sure they cool at room temperature before packaging it. When do you plan to send it off?" Hunter asks, another chunk of the cookie goes into his mouth.
Why does he care?! Neville nods in return then covers the left side of his cheek with his hand at an attempt to hide his blush from Blaise.
"Do you need to go to the infirmary?" Blaise whispers. A shiver goes down Neville's spine. What's happening to me?
"Thanks..." Blaise whispers back, taking the bag from Neville's hands. Their fingers brush once more and Neville turns away at an attempt to not let these weird emotions show.
He reaches for it, breaking the seal, and picking out the letter. He opens it and the same small, neat cursive letters covered the page.
Blaise chuckles, "I could feel that as soon as you two passed me. I'm just glad we're in the same dorm again. Crabbe and Goyle were driving my last nerve away."
The room felt warmer, which made him feel worse. He tried to hold it back, but he couldn't stop. Tears formed in his eyes and slowly trickled down his face. No, no, no. There he goes again, embarrassing himself.
His mother looks at the floor. "Lucius... he can be strict... Maybe too strict. I've tried to speak to him about it before but he doesn't listen to me and often gets angry when I bring it up." He never knew this.
Blaise smiles, "Huh... Well, it can't be Potter..." Draco blushes even worse and gulps. Blaise's eyes widen, "You don't mean to tell me-"
Harry and Draco looked at each other as if asking each other silently who should go first. Harry decides to go first. "Well, we were making our Patronus's and after I did mine, I sat back down and Draco called me a show-off and..." Harry gulps and rubs the back of his neck. "I called him a pathetic excuse for a wizard... Then he started punching me and then I punched him back..." Harry finishes, blushing heavily from embarrassment.
"Alright, I'll think about it." Draco sighs. Yet, even as he thought, he still didn't think he'd be able to even get one word out to Harry. He decided at once that he would continue to avoid him.
Draco sits down beside him and puts his arm around him. "I can't begin to understand how you feel. But, I can say I'm terribly sorry."
Harry turned around, now sporting his abs. They weren't very defined, but it still took Draco's breath away.
"Yes," Neville smiles, "But... I wanted to say thank you for helping me. I really appreciate you being there. You really helped me and uh, the gifts got me through a lot. I sleep with that blanket every day."
He quietly makes his way to sit towards him and plops himself in the seat beside him. "Hi." Blaise says softly. Neville, once again, didn't react whatsoever. "Did Madame Pomfrey fix you up? I noticed Draco was in our common room this morning so..."
"Well, I'm sorry about... Yesterday. You didn't do anything I was just... Not having a good day. I shouldn't have taken it out on you. I always do and it's wrong." He says looking right into his eyes. It made him nervous, but he needed him to know he was genuine.
Draco turns around and gives him a 'are-you-serious?!' look. "No! Absolutely not! I'll just be sent to Saint Mungo's and treated like a crazy person. If you take me there or try to I will hex you into oblivion." Draco threatens.
"Well... goodnight." Neville says, climbing into his bed and covering himself up with his thin, skinny blanket. He'd had it for years, so he never threw it away. However, he did still wish he had something better to cover himself with, but his grandmother didn't have the money to buy a better one, at least not at the moment. The most they could buy was food and the cost to stay in their home.
He looks down at Blaise's tie and then back into his eyes, "You must be Zabini." He smiles, "Luna has told me much about you. Bargyles swarm you she says!" Hunter smiles wide, sporting both dimples on his cheeks.
He takes the cloak off of him and clears his throat. Draco jerks his attention towards him with wide eyes and draws his wand.
Then, Blaise walked over to him. Panic washed over his body and he quickly diverted his eyes at the table in front of him.
Pansy gives his an innocent smile, "Sure, Mr. Zabini!" She says sarcastically and walks past Blaise and towards a velvet green chair on the other side of the room. "So, what is this about?"
He caught sight of Blaise and began to blush. He didn't know why but just the sight of Blaise made him feel all weird inside. Maybe it's because of how scary Blaise looked. He was skinny, but he was too skilled at hexes and curses to cross him.
So him and Blaise sat alone together in a lone compartment, as silent as they can be. He could tell they both didn't want to be doing this.
"Yes... He would sometimes beat up our house-elf instead of Draco... but other times he preferred to hit Draco." His mother admits. His eyes widen. He never expected his mother to ever care about this.
"Don't feel bad! You did a perfect patronus before. You have power, I know you do!" Blaise encourages.
It had been weeks since he had seen Blaise. He didn't realize it could hurt this much. His grandmother would yell at him to come out of him room, but he refused. He only ate after his grandmother would go to bed and then he'd creep through the house and snack on blueberries and crackers. But even blueberries made him feel crappy. The only thing he could think of was Blaise, no matter what he did.
Dumbledore gives him a glance before saying, "Goyle will now be paired with Pansy. You must be partnered with whoever Miss Parkinson was originally paired with."
Neville picks it up and notices it's quite heavy. He takes it to an empty table and undoes the bow. He notices a few of his acquaintances follow him. He reads the note which says: "Merry Christmas, Neville. I hope you get all the presents you wish for this year. In fact, I had asked some of your friends to help me with this very special gift to give to you, so perhaps you will find something you have needed. Inside there will be another note. I would prefer you read it away from wandering eyes."
"Uh... Yeah about that. I tried telling Seamus it wasn't true but McGonagall interrupted me. I'm so sorry."
"Here, my lord." His father says, grabbing Draco's arm firmly, nearly digging his nails into Draco's skin and pulling him up from the chair. "Look up," His father demanded in a whisper. He does as he is told, only to be rewarded with a sense of fear.
"Besides, no one needs to know except you. You don't owe anyone anything, let alone the Gryffindors. The only person that needs to know about this is you and the only person that has the right to tell you what to do is yourself. Just be yourself and let yourself feel these emotions, even if you're afraid nothing will ever happen. There is nothing wrong with how you feel and you should allow yourself to feel for once. I notice this a lot in you, Neville. You always invalidate your feelings, judge yourself, and hold back your feelings and emotions. You also tend to keep your mouth shut a lot. You need to stop that. You deserve respect, especially from yourself. Don't be afraid to speak your mind. Even though you don't believe it, you are a Gryffindor! You were put there for a reason. Don't let fear shut you up. Don't let anything shut you up. I want you to start telling things like it is and allowing yourself to feel. You deserve it. Now, I wanna do something. It's a simple yes or no. I'm gonna make a few guesses to who this person is, because I do have a few guesses. This one might be completely stupid but, Gregory Goyle? Just a guess though. Next guess, Draco Malfoy? Again, probably stupid but who knows. He isn't ugly so I'd understand. The very last guess is,"
"Because I demand to know why they didn't say anything. Especially if it was an adult." Harry says angrily.
"No, you aren't." Blaise grips him tightly. "I know that's who it is. You are painfully horrible at hiding it. Here I was thinking you were a true Slytherin, yet your secrets are easily given away. Though, I wouldn't say it's surprising now that I think about it..."
"We're thinking about bringing you home after you eat. But we'll have to pay close attention to what you eat now. You must eat three meals a day, she said, and drink more water." His mother says. "I'll help you out with that. Do you four mind helping as well?" She asks Blaise and them.
"As for Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, the hearing continues. Now, Lucius Malfoy, I was given information that you have been violent at home with both Narcissa and Draco?" The judge asks him. The room seems to go even more silent than before.
"Yeah, Luna Lovegood! Apparently, some Gryffindors and Ravenclaws saw them together last night." Goyle informed. Draco couldn't help but feel sorry for Blaise. He looked over at him, expecting him to be absolutely torn up. I guess Draco had forgotten how great Slytherins were at hiding their true emotions.
He knew it was risky, but he grabbed a pen and began writing: "Please give me a hint to who you are. Anything will work, or maybe more than one. I'm just very curious. I can't seem to think of anything, especially with the Z stamped on the wax. I understand if you don't wish to talk with me, but I really want to at least have some clues to who you are. -Neville." He folds it up and gives it to his owl, who flies away into the darkness.
"Sure thing." Seamus says with a smile. "Hey, fat lady!" Seamus says, turning to the entrance of the common room.
"It was terribly awkward." Draco complains as they step down towards the dungeon. "We would just sit there until bedtime in silence. At least before that whole little event happened, there was at least arguing to fill the silence. I'm just glad they came back to tell us to go back to our dorms before the day ended. I thought I would lose my mind."
"Oh! I didn't mean to interrupt." Luna says, trying to hide the smirk on her face. "I just came to tell you that lunch was ready. It might be a bit uncomfortable sitting on the floor, but it's still the same food." Luna says.
"Yeah... I second that. Nothing is easy anymore. Sometimes I wish I was a kid again... Back then my father didn't care too much about what I did, but then I turned into a teenager and now it seems like he hates me. Not that he seemed to care before, but at least before he never paid attention to me. Now all he does is watch everything I do and yell at me all the time. Sometimes worse... Will it only get worse from here?"
"Look, I'm sorry if I shout at you. I just really want to scream and punch something!" Blaise shouts. Draco quickly cast muffliato as he listens to Blaise. "I was trying to get our deal done, you know, tell Neville how I feel. I was walking down the hall and there they fucking were! Abbott got there before me! Granted, I knew I had no chance but now there is no way I can possibly tell him now! First Luna, which wasn't actually anything... And now Hannah?! How is it that nothing ever goes my way?! I was born with a mother who pays me no attention and will buy her damn boyfriend some food and leave me to eat stale leftovers. I had to learn how to cook for myself! Now the one thing that I thought could bring me happiness slips out of my fingers! Why is it always me?!" Blaise sighs before continuing, "But most of all, I hate myself! I hate myself for hating them together! I should be happy for them! I love him for Merlin's sake, but... I don't know." He sighs once more, "I want to cry but I also want to hex her into oblivion. I don't know maybe me and him were never meant to be." Blaise says, finally calming down and plopping down on the floor below him. "Maybe I'm not meant for anyone. Wow I really am embarrassing myself now."
"W-what are you going to do?" Neville asked fearfully. Last time someone dragged him somewhere, it was to hex him senseless.
Draco's mind kept yelling at him to stop, that this was utter madness, but he couldn't. His body wanted more and he couldn't move away.
"So you do understand!" Neville says with a smile. Blaise doesn't reply, but instead pulls him into a tight hug.
"You don't know what I'm talking about do you?" Harry asked. Draco could hear the slight anger in his tone.
"Are you kidding me?!" Harry almost shouts, catching the attention of a couple of Slytherins and Gryffindors.
Blaise doesn't seem to meet Draco's eyes after that. "Uh, just Lovegood... She looks awfully nutty with her butterfly hat, it was hard not to look." Blaise chuckles awkwardly.
His father raised his wand and stomped towards Draco, "You're a disgrace." His father said. "You're a freak. My son... A pansy. A Malfoy doesn't stare at boys! A Malfoy doesn't think about boys. A Malfoy doesn't cry and whine about every little thing! You are a boy, act like it!" His father shouted, making Draco jump. He tried to hold back his tears and instead shook like a flag in a hurricane.
He finally gets through the moving staircases and in front of the Fat Lady, only to realize... he had forgotten the password.
"Yes, my lord." Snape replies, swiftly making his way towards the Dark Lord. They whisper to each other then exit the room alone.
"I'm sure if we talk to him he'll understand." Harry says. Draco simply shakes his head but doesn't say another word.
He sat on the steps of the fourth floor, hoping Harry wouldn't find him there. Much to his dismay, a voice behind him says:
"I wouldn't know anything about that. He can't be in his little home you made me build, I destroyed it after he left."
"I uh... I was looking for... for you." Harry says awkwardly. "Well... not me looking for you. Blaise was looking for you... And Ginny... And Ron... And everyone else..." He says quickly.
"No need to thank me. It's the least I could do. There was no way I was going to let you burn, no matter how annoying you are..." He trails off, "And I for sure wasn't going to allow you to be thrown under the bus after I read Snape's letter... And saw his memories... Why didn't you tell anyone?" He asks.
"I appreciate your kindness, but I'm afraid you wouldn't want me in your house. But I really do appreciate it. I can handle it on my own though, so don't worry about me. If you need anything else to vent about, then do so, but I'll have to go if this is it. If so, goodbye and thank you for listening. You're really a sweet guy, Neville."
"Do you see him?!" Snape shouts, "Get out of my way." He demands, pushing Harry towards the side then briskly walking away.
"Hello, Neville. Never think I don't want to talk to you, I simply keep my distance to be respectful to you. However, I will always be here if you need me. I really am sorry for your loss. That must feel terrible. I can't imagine what it must be like, but I know what it's like to not have a normal family that's for sure. As for your break up, I'm really sorry that happened. I don't think it would be because you're boring because I think you're the most interesting person in the world! It can't be because you're ugly because well... you're not at all! Just look at you! I'm shocked anyone would think you are anything but attractive. And you aren't weird, not at all. People just don't know you enough and they often make assumptions without evidence. If she thinks any of these things about you, which I'm sure she doesn't, then she was a bad match anyways. You deserve love, don't ever think otherwise. You deserve every good thing in the world to happen to you because you're a good person with a good heart. I'm sorry such terrible things happen to you, they shouldn't. The universe really is attacking the wrong person, that's for sure. By the way, this isn't too depressing at all. In fact, you can tell me anything and everything, no matter how sad or terrible it is. If you need a safe space, I'm right here. I'll never judge you and I'll never turn you away. I promise you. If I was as brave as you, perhaps I would meet you face to face and make an unbreakable vow to you saying that I'd never judge you and always be a place of comfort for you. But since that would terrify me and ruin everything, you must trust me instead. Just know that not everything is your fault and everything gets better with time. I know that's hard to believe, especially for me, but for someone like you it's inevitable to get better with time. You'll find a person who truly loves you and you'll find peace. It may take a while, but it'll come. Thank you for confiding in me and I really hope you find happiness."
He was in shock. Dumbledore was dead and Professor Snape did it. Well, now Headmaster Snape. It all disgusted him and the whole castle afterwards was dark and silent.
The scent of artificial strawberry and milk chocolate filled his nose sending warmth through him. He really missed this place.
"I'll go right now. I'll make sure he's safe, ok?" Luna promises, closing her book and standing up to leave. Neville followers her but they seperate soon after. He notices her making her way to either the basement or the dungeons.
Veronica giggles, "It's so embarrassing. Apparently your ways of making him think you want to be friends with him are working. He told Xavier how worried he is that you're lying to him and that all he wants is to have a real friend like Blaisey." Veronica mocked. "Honestly, if that's how he thinks, I bet we can make everyone think he has a crush on you."
Draco shakes his head. Everyone's taking up for him and just accepting him, but for what? If anything, he was just as bad as his father. Not only that but he was weak. Everyone else put their lives on the line while he sat their and cowered in his little corner.
His frantic walking was stopped by a hard thump into another person... Harry Potter. "Dammit, Potter, do you know how to bloody walk right?!" He shouts.
He took a sip of his hot chocolate and closed his eyes. He missed the feeling of drinking a warm beverage in an atmosphere like the Three Broomsticks. He actually felt relaxed at this moment. Then, it was over as quickly as it started, at least that's how it felt.
"Don't think about them. Focus on the scent, focus on us." Blaise pauses for a minute, thinking of how to distract Draco, "Here, let's talk about something. Maybe... What makes us the happiest and why? You go first, Draco." Blaise says.
"No can do, Nev. You will not go your whole life not knowing how to fly. How will you transport yourself from place to place?" Blaise asks.
Draco looks at the floor, fiddling with his teacup. "Draco, no matter what anyone makes you do, you be yourself."
His eyes began to burn the more he thought and thought about how much of an idiotic loser he was, the more tears began to form. Usually he can hold it in, but this time it didn't work. He felt like he was sobbing for hours, up until he heard his name being called.
He gets closer and realizes there are two people sitting on the grass below. He goes to land, but tumbles on the ground.
Neville simply nods. He doesn't agree, in fact he thought it was hilarious. He loved it especially because that's the first time he was able to laugh about something with his fellow Gryffindors. It may have been stupid, but it made his year.
"I already promised I wouldn't say anything. I'll even take an unbreakable vow," Blaise says, giving Draco a sincere look in the eyes.
He feels drawn to the bracelet, but refuses to wear it. Instead, he reaches in his pocket and grasps onto the cold metal. It shockingly does make it feel like all his worries washed away.
Between the stares, sad looks, and that strange encounter at the Three Broomsticks, she was convinced he had been enchanted.
He reached into his pocket, only to realize he had forgotten his bracelet. He began to panic, but the eyes he felt on him made him push it all down.
"Don't even act like you don't know. Draco helped get Dumbledore killed! He's a bloody death eater! You seriously think I'm gonna trust you?!" Neville shouts. Blaise stands dumbfounded. He has never once heard Neville shout.
They go back home and he searches around for his owl, hoping he came back with a note. Sadly enough, he found his owl but no letter. He sighs. Days like these are often dissappointing anyways. He should've known this would happen.
They make their way through the room and come face to face with Harry. They all draw their wands and hold it up to him. They honestly expected the Weasel and Mudblood.
Blaise chuckles and sits beside him before taking out a white-colored bean. He pops it into his mouth and gags.
Professor Snape's nasally, eerie voice spoke up soon after, "Alright... Dumbledore has decided to make a change in the school. There will be students chosen to be partners in every class with the use of magic, of course... There will be no chance of changing your partners, it's a magically binding contract for you both to be partners for the year regardless of how you think about it... So I suggest you all deal with what you get. Now, we will begin to choose the names now."
"N-nothing... I'm fine." Neville says. "Just... w-worried about the Yule ball." He lies. But, in all reality, he didn't know why he felt this way.
"Accio teapot," Dumbledore says, pointing his wand at his desk. A teapot appears right in front of him and he takes two teacups and begins to pour the tea. "Here you go." Dumbledore pushes a teacup toward Draco and he sips it nervously. "You may be wondering why I kept you here... Well, I know you have been very upset recently and I know what Harry said must have hurt you."
"Great..." Harry replies sarcastically. Draco awkwardly put his books back in his bag. "See you later, yeah?" Harry asks.
"Nope." Harry says. Draco runs after him and Harry runs away. They run all around the bathroom and he notices Harry try to escape from the exit.
"Blaise Zabini? By the way, if all my guesses are wrong, then that will be the end of it. I don't get to guess anymore. That's the end of it."
Draco's stomach swirls and he leans into Harry's palm. He didn't have time to comprehend what was happening.
"I love you too." Neville replies, his heart swelling up at the words. As he gets onto his broom, Blaise gives him another kiss and Neville's cheeks tint red. "I'll see you later." Neville says, kicking off and flying away.
"Well, if this boy, whoever he is, doesn't like it then he is an ungrateful troll. However, I'm sure he will appreciate someone going out of their way to do something like this for them. By the way, what other things are you planning to get for this person?" Hunter asks.
I wonder what I'll smell after it's finished. "When you are finished, if done correctly, the potion will be a pearly pink color," Snape says.
"I-I won't! I promise! I just got distracted, but I won't ever again, I promise you." Draco says, trying to hide the shakiness in his voice.
"Lovegood!" Blaise shouts, running towards her in a sprint. Luna turns around with a calm expression as Blaise stops in front of her, breathing heavily. "I need... your... help." He breathes out.
"I'll meet you in the dorm, I have to speak to Pansy." Blaise says, a stern look prominent on his face despite his calm tone.
"Hey, Neville!" Seamus says, coming up the stairs with Dean. As soon as they step off, the staircase moves behind them.
"Someone came into my office, a young Gryffindor. He had that bracelet in his pocket, the same one I enchanted. It may be some coincidence, but if I'm correct I'd say you gifted him that bracelet, yeah?" Blaise simply stares at the floor, debating whether or not to run away. "Just so you know, that bracelet helped him in a time of need today. He might've passed out if it wasn't for your gift. That's very kind of you." Blaise smiles at this. "But I'm assuming you didn't simply do it to be kind?"
"Blaise and Neville! They're partners now?!" Snape nodded. "Oh, so poor pitiful Neville gets a partner change but I don't?!"
"Get out!" Draco shouts, putting his free hand onto Harry's chest and pushing him out. Harry grabs his hand to stop him and his back hits the wall.
He rushes in Defense Against the Dark Arts, almost completely out of breath. He takes a seat, noticing Blaise still isn't around. After many minutes of staring at the table and tuning out Professor Lupin, the door creaks open.
"He told him his insecurities about his body, told him about his parents, even told him all about his fears. They began to tease him about it... all of the people around him. Geez it's terrible." Harry sighs once more.
However, the event still rings inside his head and many tears fall from his eyes. He crosses his arms over his chest, feeling embarrassed.
He examines it before giving him a smile, "A lion, huh?" Blaise looks at the floor, not daring to utter one word out of fear that his secret will be given away. "I will enchant this for you before the break begins. Consider this your Christmas present, Blaise." Dumbledore says with a smile and a twinkle in his eye.
"We both know that... It's just a Gryffindor thing. Merlin, it's embarrassing that I like him." Draco mutters.
"I want to be friends... I'm just scared. You... You just make me feel nervous. Uh..." Neville finishes.
He walks over to his owl and puts it into her beak. She flaps his wings and flies off into the wind. He had gotten a new owl since he wasn't able to bring his other owl with him, but he didn't mind. His old one would just remind him of his old home and he'd rather not remember that.
His father glances at Draco with anger. He steps into view, pulling up his sleeve and pointing his wand at the mark.
"You're awake?!" He looks over to see him mother looking at him with a bright smile. "Oh, we were both so worried!" Both? "We didn't know if you hit your head or if you'd not eaten enough. Oh, has he eaten?" She asks Harry.
Of course, his father never called himself Draco's father, he wouldn't dare! He's embarrassed them too much to be their son. But, maybe, just maybe if he goes through with this he will be accepted from them once again. That's all that matters, right? Plus, it's not too bad anyway. This is the way it's supposed to be. This is the right way to live.
"Don't just say that. I know you still don't plan on doing it. But if you have feelings for him, I promise you that nothing will be possible until you talk to him. That was proven to me not long ago. I'm telling you... you need to talk to him. Think about, yeah?" Blaise says.
"Yes, m-ma-my lord." He stuttered. He could feel his father's deadly glare aimed at him from behind.
"Don't raise your voice at me! My word is final! I am so dissappointed. You know what I've told you about this! You're letting this aftermath of the war turn you to bad things. What's next, alcohol?!" As his grandmother lectures his, he feels tears well up in his eyes. "Just go to your room." She says, waving him away.
"Stay calm! The more you freak out, the worse it makes it!" Blaise shouts behind him. Luckily for Neville, it wasn't possible to freak out. "Try to relax your muscles! It can slow down the broom!" Blaise shouts to him.
"You can't make him do anything. Malfoy will be Malfoy. He is the way he was raised, vile. Not to mention he is a Slytherin! A snake! You can't trust any of them! Everyone who was ever been evil has been in Slytherin!" Ron says angrily.
"Nothing it's just... Blaise is uh, he might kill me for this, but he has this massive undying love for Neville." Draco informs with a smirk.
Blaise scrambles to his feet and hands Neville the broom. He grabs the basket and throws it over his shoulder and gets onto his broom. He kicks off, hovering above the ground.
Draco points his wand to his father's letter, not bothering to read the letter before. "Revelio." He says and words appear, disappear, and rearrange to their rightful places. The letter reads:
"It's time to go..." Lupin says. Well, this explains the emptiness. He looks around the classroom to see nothing but empty desks. How long did he zone out for?
"Oh just get back at me then why don't you! See if I care!" Draco shouts. There is a moment of silence. "Oh, can Ms. Myrtle not get revenge? Boohoo. Go the hell away."
He sighs and hears footsteps coming towards him. He expects Madame Pomfrey, but instead gets Blaise.
"It's not even that! Father didn't start hitting me until I was fourteen. I was mean to Harry and his friends because he didn't want to be my friend. I even bullied Weasley on his money status!" Draco says, running his hands through his hair in stress. Harry noted how soft his hair looked, even if it was incredibly messy at the moment.
They must have a Z in either their first or last name. Zacharias Smith didn't seem likely. He had a girlfriend and often sneered at Neville. Couldn't be Zekeiel McHaigen, he had a girlfriend and they often snogged in the halls. Maybe a last name? No, can't be Andrew Zinke. He had a boyfriend and they also snogged frequently in the hallways. No one else could come to mind. Maybe the Z was a coincidence? A mistake of some sort? A way of throwing Neville off?
"Why are you so angry, huh? It's not like it was you. It was just Draco and that weirdo Longbottom." Pansy shrugs.
"I'll do anything. I just wanna be here to support you. Anything you need, I want to get it to you." Harry says.
Draco couldn't help but feel sorry for Neville. But pity wasn't the only thing he felt. He felt empathy. Something like that happening to Draco would shake his whole world and he'd never be able to face his father or the school ever again.
"Thank you, mystery man. I feel much better. I'm glad you talked to me because I was honestly worried you wouldn't. I'm just really scared that my mother will die soon as well, but I hope she doesn't. I'm also pretty scared for the future. I often forget it, but then I remember that he-who-must-not-be-named is back and maybe we will all die. Again, sorry to make everything so grim. I just wish things were normal. Also, if you don't mind, I want to know about your family. If it makes you uncomfortable, then you don't have to say anything. Again, thank you so much. P.S. I'm not brave at all, but thanks anyways."
The judge says, grabbing his gavel and speaking again, "Due to information I was given recently, I hearby declare Draco Malfoy not guilty." He says, slamming his gavel down onto the sound block. "You may escort Draco Malfoy out of the court room."
"I am your mother." His grandmother tells her. She looks confused, then doesn't respond to his grandmother any longer. "Come on, Neville." His grandmother says, pulling him to the same spot she was in.
"Do you ever do anything right?!" Professor Snape shouts. "You do understand that you could've killed us all with your ignorant choices?! What were you thinking?! The more you do this the more points you lose! I have had it with you! Next time, let Blaise do the potion. Maybe then you won't mess everything up like you always do." Snape slams Neville's book onto his desk, making Neville jump. "Get out." He demands. Neville obeys almost instantly and grabs his things in a hurry and sprints out of the classroom.
"I know you more than you think," Blaise says. "I know that Snape makes you feel like crap and well... So does everyone else. I also know that you like Cauldron Cakes and Chocolate Frogs freak you out."
"I apologize but that isn't my place. I will have a talk with them today about it to make sure it's them but regardless, it's their decision to tell you who it is. Although, I will tell you that it's someone you would expect the least." Dumbledore says with a smile.
Suddenly, his heart began to beat like a cheetah running through the savanna. His stomach did hurdles through his body and his cheeks began to burn. Then, he finally realized what all of this meant. It wasn't sickness nor nervousness. It wasn't some random feeling that happened to appear. No, it was none of that. The only time he felt this was with his first ever crush, Vincent Widdleprim before he moved away to Germany.
He left after Neville gave him a nod and stomped towards the Slytherin dungeons. He held out the invisibility cloak he took from his school bag and put it on before continuing.
"I know... but you live here, so that makes you my master. Anywho, I am here to bring you some warm food." Maggie says, holding out a steaming plate of chocolate cake. "I made this today, specially for you."
"Come on, Draco. Get them, now." His Aunt demands. He grabs them without a second thought, doing his best not to look at Harry. His Aunt giggles. He watches as Harry's swollen eye returns to normal. "Well, well... Look what we have here. Harry Potter all shiny and new. Just in time for the Dark Lord... Call him." She demands. Draco glances around, not wanting to be the one to do it. "Call him!" She shouts.
"N-nothing. I'm f-fine." Neville says before taking a bite of his chicken. He felt guilty for eating, as he always does, but at times like these he feels worse. He's probably only eating because he's nervous and probably just made a fool of himself in front of a deceitful Slytherin. Great.
"But I'm worried it's a joke, especially with the letter they gave me. They told me to not show anyone, but maybe I can just show you? I really need help." Neville says.
Goyle joins in, "Good because the little prat deserves some shit thrown at him. He can't even put in a simple ingredient in the potion. That idiot almost ruined my whole grade! What a halfwit!" He shouts.
He stands there for a while, then an intrusive thought enters his brain. He can see Blaise and him together, holding hands, him saying he was the person who gave the gift, and reaching in to kiss him. And kiss him for a long time.
"It is done." Voldemort smiles. It took everything inside him not to grimace at his chilling smile. It didn't help that he was also trying to hide the throbbing sting coming right from the mark. He honestly thought he'd have to go through more than just this, but he didn't. Should that worry him?
"Because..." Blaise sighs, "Because I want to. It's my responsibility to be on the good side. I can't let my school down."
"Well, first of all Neville has this pretty pathetic blanket he has slept with since first year. His legs have grown out a lot and it barely covers his arms and legs. I don't know why he hasn't gotten rid of it, especially since it's pretty obvious it drives him crazy. Anyways, I'm sure he'd appreciate a new one." Harry finishes.
Draco sighs. Blaise will never understand. He can never relax, not even at Hogwarts. Draco never plans on telling him the truth either seeing that his loyalities definitely lie with Neville and not him. If he found out Draco was a death eater he'd never see his only friend again.
Stumbling and threatening to fall over, he runs to the common room. "Holly berries!" He shouts, the door opening slowly and Draco bounces impatiently. He runs in as soon as he can.
"I just wanted a good laugh. I don't care too much for dating him anymore." Pansy says, grabbing a nearby book.
He wanted to ignore it, he wanted to not think of Harry having a weird dream he was assuming he was having, but he couldn't stop listening.
McGonagall throws the first spell and Snape just blocks it. The more she throws at him, the farther he moves back. Neville watches Snape jump out the window and vanish.
"No, anything you need to say to me you can say in front of them." He gestures to Luna and Blaise. Blaise is giving her a glare while Luna has the same calm composure she always seems to have while giving her a friendly smile.
"I'm still upset about that." Neville says with a sharp tone. "But hey, at least you're safe now." He looks at the ground and speaks again, "I need to tell you something else... That boy I was talking about in the letters... It was you." He rubs his neck and blushes again.
"Well apparently you said something because she told everyone that you have a crush on me." Draco informs.
"Oh, great. Uh, I'll be outside." She says, stepping outside the room and going into an empty bathroom.
Neville stares down at the hand on his arm and sighs, "I... Well, let me start at the beginning. There was this guy who sent me a Christmas gift, right? And it was really nice and he sent me all these great things. But, I didn't know who he was. We had great talks through letters, but I still had no idea, even with hints! Then he had a problem and I told Luna to go help and she was headed towards either the basement or dungeon. So, I kept thinking, well if it isn't a Hufflepuff then it has to be a Slytherin. But the only Slytherin with a Z in his name was you. But then, all these weird thoughts came to mind about me and you and I kind of wanted it to be you in some weird way. Gosh, I should shut up now." Neville blurts out.
Harry stands there, shocked at himself. Why would he ever say that? Sure, it was true, but seriously?! He groans and silently shouts at himself for it. This is just like the time when he tried to talk to Cho Chang. Not that Draco is anything like that. They're just friends. That's all.
Blaise hesitates before asking, "Is that where all the... bruises come from? You aren't really falling?"
They have two children, the oldest being Rose Granger-Weasley, the other being Hugo Granger-Weasley. Rose and Hugo were both sorted into Gryffindor.
Harry huffs, "I take one look at your arm, Draco, one look! All I can see is burns and cuts and bruises. It can't be from your father! They healed you and he's gone. So what have you been doing to yourself?!"
"Alright, so today we continue our work on Patronus's, hopefully with no fights this time." Professor Lupin said with a smile. "Why don't you come up here, Blaise."
"He didn't want to come. I'm going to take him some food though and make sure he eats it." Harry says, grabbing a tray and walking over to the table of food.
Harry grabs both of Draco's hands and looks at him eye to eye, "Everything will be ok. We've got you, ok? You're safe."
Now he could hear Leona Spickle calling him "fat" from the Slytherin table just behind him. Now that they all knew his insecurites there was no way it would stop. Considering Blaise has done nothing to take up for him just confirms his suspicions. He was such an idiot!
"Right." Draco responds without a second word. "I mean, nothing felt really true in that moment, but I kept spilling it all out... I guess it was the wrong potion..." He feels so many emotions at once. Anger, sadness, disappointment, but most of all confusion. What in Harry's right mind made him think this way? Maybe he is just trying to convince himself it never happened? Maybe Harry hated it? "I have to go talk to... Pansy." Draco says. Harry nods in response and he grabs his satchel and heads off.
Neville slightly blushed, "Oh," He said. Even though the thought terrified him, it was slightly flattering to know that, if bargyles happened to exist, that they'd be all around him.
George Weasley still continues to grieve the loss of Fred, but runs Weasley's Wizard Wheezes like normal. Ron and Ginny help him run the business so he doesn't get too stressed. He continues to take counseling after being urged by Harry to do so. He also remains single but helps out Molly and Arthur at home because they're getting older every day. Although, it does make him happy to be around his parents and be able to help them out any way he can.
"No, my lord. I promise. I will get it done as soon as possible." Draco says quickly, proud at his lack of stuttering this time.
It seemed to take it all away. The stress, the panic attacks, the sadness. He always hated pain being given to him, physically or mentally, but when he does it to himself... it's different. It almost feels... relaxing? No, not relaxing. Perhaps... relieving? Yeah, that was the word.
Just before he can call him, a squeaking noise comes from the ceiling. He looks up along with everyone else and notices an elf, a very familiar elf. Dobby stood right on the chandelier. Before anyone could act, the chandelier crashes to the ground. Draco jumps away, bumping into a chair and hurting his already injured shoulder.
Zabini smirks at him. "Better pay attention, Longbottom." Neville gulps and nods at him. Zabini chuckles softly, sporting his husky tone, which gives Neville a funny feeling in his stomach. "See you in potions tomorrow." He smiles at Neville and walks away, making the strange feeling he couldn't name get worse.
They go back and forth, throwing spells and dodging them. Harry suddenly remembers a spell in the potions book he had. Draco definitely was an enemy.
"Neville, sit down!" Blaise demands. Neville obeys almost instantly and stares at the floor. He has that same look he had when Snape would shout at him. "I'm sorry... I didn't mean to sound so aggressive. Look, I need to tell you many, many things. But first, I need to know what you meant."
Soon the class fills with the other students. Oddly enough, him and Harry worked pretty well together this time. It was kinda nice.
"You really don't," Draco mutters. Harry snaps his head towards him and looks at him with wide eyes. "Honestly, Potter, it's possible that Pansy could've done that. However, you can't say Blaise did it. At that point, you're just assuming. Assuming mostly that all Slytherins have bad motives. That there is revolting." Draco finishes.
"I believe you, but that's not the full story, is it?" Hermione crossed her arms over her chest and gives Harry a stern look. When Harry doesn't reply, she rolls her eyes. "Fine, suffer alone!" She says, stomping up the steps towards the girls dorms, leaving Harry all alone in the common room. At times like these, he wishes he still had Sirius. Maybe then he would truly understand all of this. Maybe then he wouldn't feel so alone.
All he does is stand there, staring at her. "Get out!" She screams, her voice nearly shaking the walls.
"It's just as good as I imagined!" He says to Harry. Harry grins at him as he takes many more bites of the pie. He doesn't even realize that he abandoned his table manners almost completely.
"Fantastic. I'll get that book as soon as possible, ok? We'll figure this out." Harry says, kissing his cheek softly.
He lays down, slides his new bracelet on his wrist and curls up into his soft brown blanket. It was paradise, yet he could only think about this person more and more. He decided to guess what they might look like. He guessed dark skin, short hair with tight curls, maybe he was tall? He kept thinking of a familiar face, but who was it?
After becoming best friends, Ginny and Luna realize that they both liked each other! They dated for four years, but they slowly drifted apart. They broke up but are still on good terms with each other.
"I uh... I better go now." Harry says quietly, standing up and leaving the lavatory without another word.
"Father! I'm telling you, he'd never! Bargyles swarmed him and he's been helping a Gryffindor!" Luna says.
Harry smiles softly and kisses him gently. "You know," He whispers, "I used to think about this a lot. I'd ignore it though. I thought it was just some weird intrusive thought, but I realize now that I've wanted this for a long time."
Draco nods, "I will... l know where my loyalities lie. I will not let you down." Draco notices a look of sadness in the Professor, but pushes it off as something he was making up in his mind.
"No! I honestly just didn't want to break your heart by saying no." He lied partially. He didn't tell her about the part of wanting to forget about every moment he had with Draco.
He hears a thump behind him and an eerily quiet voice say, "Draco... Glad to see you following your father's footsteps." He turns around and almost chokes. He knew he wouldn't look like daisies and sunshine, but bloody hell. "You fear me..." Voldemort smiles softly. "No need for that, Draco. Come here."
Harry opened his eyes. Draco then noticed the tears coming down his face. Harry quickly wiped them away and stared back at Draco.
"M-ma-maybe... Maybe we c-can co-convince him to come t-tomorrow." Neville stutters, his face turning warmer with each word he says.
Everything is fine. He has never been and never will be attracted to Harry Potter, or any guy for that matter. He is a Malfoy! Malfoy's are not gay.
"Oh, by the way I apologize for my father's prejudice. He just hasn't met you yet. I'm sure if he did he'd love you." She smiles.
"Now I have to look at this STUPID mark for the rest of my life!" Draco shouts, banging on his leg. Harry wonders how hard he was hitting his leg, but it looked like it was hard enough to leave a bit of a mark. "I just want to get rid of it." He sobs, "It makes me even more disgusting than before."
The next set of names was truly a shock, very unpleasant to say the least. Even more unpleasant than Neville and Goyle's pairing. "Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter." The room goes silent and Draco's eyes go wide, his heart beating faster than ever and his chest burning hot with anger. He tries to stay silent all he can as to not lose house points. But Harry Potter, of course, opened up his big stupid mouth.
"Headmaster's Office, now!" Lupin shouts, grabbing them both by their robes and dragging them out of the classroom.
It didn't take sense, none of it made sense! Draco said that Blaise liked Neville, right? Not Draco! Then again, Slytherins are great actors and Blaise has been around Draco a lot lately, almost non-stop. But, it didn't matter. After all, he didn't care about Draco like that. He hated him! That kiss meant nothing and they both know it. It was all just some freak mistake. Besides, if Harry did happen to act on these so-called feelings of his, Draco would most likely use it for his personal gain anyway. All Slytherins do that. So why on Earth was he moping around in the library with Draco Malfoy raiding his every thought?
"Let's go." His grandmother said, grabbing his hand and walking out the door. "You can throw that wrapper away, it's just trash."
The door opens to reveal Luna. "Good morning, Blaise. A letter came for you." She says, handing him a blank envelope.
Both Blaise and Neville grabbed for the spoon at the same time. Their hands brush and Blaise could notice Neville's breath hitch.
Draco thinks and thinks, but all he can think of to try is the time his mother gave him new robes. "Expecto Patronum," Draco says nonchalantly. Nothing happens.
"No it isn't! You should've seen his face. People constantly make remarks at him and he just seemed completely out of it. He didn't talk once or look at me. Well... maybe he did once but, he didn't speak at all. I'm still worried." Blaise exhales and places his chin into his hand.
Both Voldemort and his father looked over at the person. The boggart shifted, turning into a dementor. But... The only person whose boggart was a dementor-
"Oh no." Blaise says, putting his head in his hands. "You and Harry weren't there today but... Snape asked to see Neville when we were all out of the classroom. He... well... he made the potion explode today."
They stood there and watched as Voldemort threw spells left and right at Harry, only to have them be missed. Slowly, the cowardly death eaters began to file out.
"Yes I should've! I'm almost certain he is the one who brought those death eaters here." Her father says.
"Dirty sock! Bleh!" He shouts, spitting it into the nearest trash bin. However, that slight smile still remained.
"That was all?!" Ginny shouts, coming from the kitchen. Harry's eyes widen. "If you didn't like me you should've said no!" She stomps up the stairs and out of sight. He takes a deep breath, but still feels no sense of relaxation whatsoever.
"That's so wonderful that you are safe and happy! That makes me happy! For me, yes I am safe. I'm at home with my grandmother. I still think about my father sometimes which upsets me, but I can always pull through. Your bracelet also has helped keep me calm through these times, especially after Dumbledore's death and being afraid of not only my life but my friends and families lives. But it's really kept me from going crazy. Thank you for that by the way. And the blanket has kept me warm! I also forgot to compliment you on those cookies. And don't worry about that, I don't mind you being a boy. Actually, I've been trying to figure things out about myself recently and it makes me feel pretty weird and disgusting. Anyways, enough about me. How is your friend? What does it look like there? How do you feel?"
He looks up to see Blaise. He still heaved from his new discovery and Blaise stared at him strangely.
He felt as if he was a child again and for once in his life he felt really happy. Not only because of the pie, but also because people had began to talk to him.
