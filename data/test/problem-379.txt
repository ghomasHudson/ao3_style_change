Harry hears him and makes a mental note of his words, but his mind and body are too consumed to respond. He needs to get there. He needs to know. He needs to—
The morning sun poured through Draco’s windows on Boxing Day, the bright light pulling him from his anxious dreams of dragonfire, angry Weasleys, and motherly hugs. The strange mix left him disconcerted and unsure of himself, neither something he enjoyed.
Unable to hold himself up any longer, Draco lowered his body to cover Harry’s, chest to chest, stomach to stomach, hips to hips — throbbing erection to—
“Where’s my saint?”
“Hi.” Harry smirked, mirth dancing in his emerald depths.
He groaned and shoved his fists deeper into his coat pockets. This needed to end. It was one thing finding your friend and fellow co-worker hot and fit beyond measure; that didn’t have to mean anything. Falling in love with them, though, without any hope of it ever evolving into anything beyond one-sided pining, was surely nothing but pathetic. If Draco had been interested, he would’ve said something by now, right? Because there was no way the man hadn’t noticed Harry’s swooning every five minutes whenever they happened to be in the same room. No, Draco knew, all right. And he graciously ignored it whenever he caught Harry ogling, or losing his train of thought mid-sentence, or blabbering utter nonsense because he just couldn’t help himself.
“Draco, dear, take my seat,” Molly suggested, waving Draco over. “I’m sure it’ll do him good to have you near.”
Regarding the conditions of your mother’s house arrest, I haven’t heard anything final from Shacklebolt yet, but I’ll be sure to let you know as soon as I do.
“I’m sorry, Mr Potter,” he said quietly. “I can’t.” Harry’s face fell, and his green eyes suddenly lost their sparkle. It was a devastating sight, and Draco wouldn’t have been able to torture the man any longer even if he’d wanted to. He cleared his throat. “My time here tonight is for people who purchased a ticket.”
After the initial shock had subsided, Draco had turned his gaze to Harry, finding him with an encouraging smile on his face, his emerald eyes sparkling with possibilities. Of course, Draco did the only thing that made sense; he snorted at the idea, waved it off, and left them to their nonsense in favour of some customers waiting for him at the counter. He’d immigrated to the Muggle world for a reason, for Circe’s sake; there was no way he’d be heading back anytime soon.
I can’t deny I never cared much for your father, not that this should come as any surprise for you. But even so, I do get how the changes you’re speaking of must have affected you and your family. You know I saw him that night, right, the day Riddle returned? Safe to say, Riddle was not merciful to him and his buddies for denying their allegiance after his downfall. (Not that Riddle was ever merciful to anyone; it was one of those incriminating weaknesses he never would’ve allowed himself, right up there with love, empathy, and compassion. Oh, the horror of having something beyond power and other people’s fear worth living for!) So, yeah, I can understand if Lucius was terrified of what would happen to him — and in extension, to you and your mother — after Riddle came back. And I can very well picture him tensing up as a result of that. What I can’t imagine, though, no matter how hard I try, is your father as the cringey dad-joke person you describe him as. It just doesn’t compute in my head.
“Sicilian lemon, like you recommended.” His spoon is already in his hand, hovering over his yellow ball of heaven, and I rush to mirror him, touched by the notion of him waiting for me before he digs in. It’ll be his first time tasting granita, and if I’m honest, I’m more eager to watch him experience it than I am to enjoy my own. He smiles and his green eyes twinkle as he gestures to my bowl. “Yours is green apple, though. I tried to get them to sprinkle some parmesan on it for you, but they stubbornly refused. And here I thought the customer was always right.”
Ernie balled up a piece of parchment and threw it at him, making him laugh. “Fine, I won’t ask questions until you’re ready to talk about it, but honestly, I’m impressed. Charlie Weasley. His brother’s right. I’d pegged him as a lifelong bachelor.”
Harry tunes him out and goes back to his reading with a satisfied smile.
“Er…” The question catches Harry by surprise; Malfoy’s never asked him to interpret a topic beforehand before, and his brain is still on overload from all the wizarding facts about seemingly benign Muggle objects that Malfoy’s been revealing over the past few hours. “I don’t know, be happy she hasn’t dumped you yet?”
He reaches over and runs his fingers down Orion’s spine, gliding over the corn snake’s emerald scales, warm from sleeping next to Harry and absorbing his body heat. Harry moves his hand to pet the flat part of Orion’s head, eliciting a little moan of pleasure from the snake—or what sounds like one to Harry’s ears, anyway.
Michael introduces Richard the Clock Expert to a ridiculous cuckoo clock and its hopeful owner. Before, you would’ve commented on it, said something witty, and then we’d snicker about it together. We’d guess its value and bicker about it for a while until Richard voiced his verdict, allowing one of us to bask in the glory of the most accurate guess. And it used to be a serious competition too; least wins of the evening earned the loser kitchen duty the entire upcoming week.
Draco put the last bulb into the box and sealed it, then pushed it aside and sat down next to his neighbour. With an audible sigh, he let his head fall back against the cushion. “Maybe. And maybe he’s horrified at all the lies and what he probably regards as manipulation. If I were him, I’d be questioning everything he thought he’d learned about me in the past few weeks.”
Harry reached out and stroked Draco’s hot cheek, smiling fondly when those beautiful eyes fluttered open. They were unfocused at first, dazed, but soon the misty grey cleared to bright silver as they found Harry’s gaze.
“Pansy’s Pantry,” he said clearly, then stepped through the green flames and into Pansy’s clean, crisp outer-office at the Park Foundation headquarters.
“Harry,” Hermione hissed, “stop it. You’re making a fool of yourself.”
“Thank you.”
Malfoy smirks and Harry whacks him on the shoulder. “You’re free to leave at any time.”
“Maybe.” Harry winked.
Psst, if you don't already know, I
One thing in particular that’s been niggling me lately is that the man who suggested an auror career for me in the first place, the one who made me want to hunt down dark wizards for a living, wasn’t even the renowned auror he posed as, but a wicked thought-to-be-dead death eater and Azkaban escapee. I’m sure you remember him fondly, considering the unforgettable transfiguration he once let you experience. Yeah, they never made it public, and I’m not sure your parents ever told you either, but the man who once turned you into a cute but skittish little ferret wasn’t Professor Moody but Barty Crouch Jr, one of Riddle’s men who went polyjuiced as Moody for the entire duration of the school year. The more I think about him being the one who first planted the auror idea in my head, the more the idea just doesn’t sit right with me.
“Oh, you recognise the word ‘sandwich’, huh? Come on then.”
“Honestly, Potter? If this is the best you can do, there’s no wonder you’re still single.” Harry opens his mouth to retort but hesitates. Malfoy’s not mocking him, he realises, but sounds genuinely concerned, as if he’s actually looking to help. “Why did you choose this place?”
doing here?”
. Draco bit back another groan as realisation hit him, sharp and mortifying; while Harry may not be able to see the proof of his arousal, he’d most definitely be able to smell it. Admittedly, there might be a slim chance the man was still too preoccupied with his anatomy revisions to notice, but with Draco’s usual luck, it was only a matter of time before…
“I hope your date realises what a good catch you are.”
You had a cat named Cotton? That’s quite a peculiar name for a cat, isn’t it? I bet there’s a story there… Was he just as white and fluffy as I picture him? Merlin, I can only imagine what your father must have thought of all the cat hair clinging to his fancy robes. I don’t know why I have such a hard time seeing 11-year-old you with any kind of pet, but now you mention it, I bet Lucy liked having a fellow feline around. How is he, by the way? It feels like it’s been far too long since I last checked in with him. I hope he’s doing all right; I’m starting to grow quite fond of him.
We’re de-gnoming the garden today, in preparation for next Saturday’s party. It’s not going to be a fancy thing or anything, just a bunch of friends over for food and drinks, chatter and laughter, maybe some pick-up quidditch for those who’re up for it. George has promised a bonfire later in the evening, but that’s probably as exciting as it’ll get. I’d invite you to come, if it weren’t for… Anyway, thanks for the heads-up on Nott and Zabini. Sounds like I’d better not drink too much, or who knows what I’ll spill, or to whom.
“Right.”
“A hero,” Charlie repeated decisively. “It’s not often we get a chance to be a hero these days.”
“Yes, I feel the same,” Draco heard himself saying, then blushed. This wasn’t something he usually let people know about himself. His friends knew he cooked, but they didn’t realise it was something he enjoyed.
“Well, you know, just, because, uh…” Harry looked uncomfortable. “I know the Floo can be nauseating, like, it always makes Hermione nauseous these days and, ah… I just thought I’d help.”
“Not one for charades?”
“I’m not ‘good’,” he ventures in an attempt to lighten the mood. “Just because my fans think I’m a saint, doesn’t mean it’s true. You of all people should know that by now.”
Instead, I’m just the guy who takes you home. The one who makes sure you rehydrate and get to bed in one piece. The one who makes sure you have a hangover potion and a hearty breakfast waiting for you the following morning.
“Draco.”
“Is it now?” she drawled, her eyebrows hidden far up beneath her bangs. “Because in this entire conversation, you haven’t mentioned being worried about Charlie once.”
Blaise. I’d just come back from inside when I saw them snogging in front of the bonfire, and I guess the sight caught me by surprise because, according to Theo, I had been sitting on the steps to the porch for nearly twenty minutes when he eventually came over to join me. He asked me if I was okay. I guess he thought I might be jealous of his mate or something, but I assured him I wasn’t. I told him my mood had nothing to do with Ginny and all to do with the prospect of ending up alone, and then, for some inexplicable reason, I mentioned what you’d said, that you thought I should give kissing boys a try.
stupid.”
Draco pulls back. “Bloody hell, Potter, warn a man before you go around swooning, all right? I almost didn’t catch you in time, and if you had hit your head at my expense, I’m
But what else could he do? He was wandless in the middle of a raging battle, despised by everyone and utterly fucking useless. The blazing inferno still danced on his lids every time he closed his eyes and his body still shuddered with every flash of phantom heat licking his limbs.
Draco straightened. “Well, yeah. It’s part of the Park Foundation, so…yes, I know of it.”
They've talked about it before, but the timing has never been right. The weather was bad, or they didn't have time, or there were people about. But now, the grounds are empty, the night is perfect, and Harry is ready. He
“Oh, fuck off,” Draco said, rolling his eyes as he waved him off.
There he was, returning from his long weekend away, off the Reserve. He stepped out of the hearth, brushing the soot from his sleeves with a confident flair before raking strong, calloused fingers through his long hair. For a brief moment, Draco let himself imagine what it would feel like, running his own hand through those locks, the colour of dark copper, that cascaded over his shoulders in gentle waves. Draco knew the man would pull it back into a knot on the top of his head as soon as he got outside, keeping it out of the way of any stray dragon fire. It was a dangerous liability to leave it down when around the beasts.
For those of you following this story in real-time: This week, I'm crazy excited to finally be able to reveal the results of a secret collab I've been working on for this fic for over a month now 🥳🎉✨
“What the hell?” Draco rounded on Harry, scowling. “This is mine. Get your own.”
my type, Harry? Tell me. Because Charlie is kind and generous, and he loves his family and friends, and he makes me smile. And you know what’s more? He doesn’t go around ruining the first good night out I’ve had in Merlin-knows-how-long by making asinine announcements to my friends that he knows nothing about.”
… Draco was just about to crawl over to the escritoire to retrieve his talisman when he froze in his tracks, the sound of Bellatrix’s voice reminding him of the women’s presence.
Received: Hellooooooo?
Sent: For the love of Circe! What bar are you in?
Her eyes sparkled with anger, but then suddenly, they went soft and Draco wanted to run away. “What happened with Harry?”
Sent: Potter! Fucking stop. If you touch another button on that shirt, I swear…
Harry rolled his eyes. “Seriously, though? How do people cope without seeing their kids every day? I mean, we’re going to be back in this house, constantly reminded of his absence, while Sirius will soon be all wrapped up in school and friends and undoubtedly having a blast. Do you think he’ll even remember us enough to miss us?”
“Ah, what a shame,” Draco said, feigning a wistful expression. “I really like those marshmallows…” He looked up and Harry forgot how to breathe as warm grey eyes connected with his own. “Hi…”
bubbled to the top of Draco’s mind and he relaxed, pleased that mystery was so quickly solved.
Draco’s heart pounded wildly against his ribs. What had happened? Narcissa and her sister had been in here not even five minutes ago, and they’d been talking about having tea in the Purple Parlour, not the drawing-room. No one ever even considered taking tea in the drawing-room these days; that room was dedicated to Death Eater meetings and…
lly my s-strong suit.”
Received: Nope, not Pansy. She's here, tho
He reluctantly broke the kiss, not quite sure how to voice his rapidly growing desperation but compelled to try anyway. Before he could, though, Harry threw him off track by murmuring something under his breath, something Draco had no way of catching, what with all the sensations currently assaulting him. A wandless spell, Draco soon realised, as, suddenly, Harry’s palm was slick with magically conjured lube.
Draco glared at Pansy's expectant smirk. She sat on a table in the middle of the ballroom with her checklist and a quill, her legs crossed and her black hair tucked behind her ear. Clearly, her primary goal in life was to annoy Draco as much as she could. As if that were something new.
“I wish I had a river,”  Draco sang under his breath, “I could skate away on…”
Harry laughs, shaking his head as he returns his attention to his Potions book. Their N.E.W.T. exams begin in only another week and drawing Draco's attention away tonight is already going to be difficult as it is. Better not add Harry's not completing his revising to the list of reasons Draco might try to refuse.
“Well, Charlie suggested it. Something about second chances and making things right.” Draco averted his eyes, but he didn’t miss Harry’s shoulders tensing in his peripheral vision.
“No, not really.” Draco absently stroked his fingers up and down the stem of his glass. “Well…”
have feelings for anymore—interrogating him. How wonderful.
Draco does lean in and Harry’s stomach swoops, his lips tingling as Draco’s hot breath ghosts over his skin.
“D— Malfoy?”
“Uncle Harry?” Teddy said, yanking the hem of Harry’s coat. “Can I?”
Draco sighed and walked the sculpture over to a waiting pedestal before casting a protection charm on it. Even now, he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the fascinating piece. He nearly got lost in the colourful swirls as he tried to put words to his thoughts. “Confusing. They’re all so fucking wonderful, you know? And Harry was being a prick, but not really a prick because he was accusing me of making it up, and it’s not like he was wrong about that, and now he wants to be my friend, and I— I just can’t take it anymore. I don’t want to disappoint him.”
“Yes. Let’s talk about the topics that should always be avoided when you’re on a date; or at least before you know each other much better.” That same finger comes up again as Harry nods, already knowing he’s going to get properly chastised. “The throes of the dating scene, past relationships, politics, religion, and life problems. Tell me, how many of those did you touch on this past hour?”
He had no idea how Draco could possibly know. He’d never told anyone. Hell, he’d barely even admitted it to himself. But Draco knew. He seemed to know exactly what his praise did to Harry, how it made him shudder and melt, how it spiked his arousal nearly as much as Draco’s physical ministrations did.
“And whyever not?” Draco was already irritated, but the fact that he had to tilt his head up just the slightest with Harry this close up was just infuriating.
“Draco.” Harry’s voice called out from the darkness behind him, and the plea in it made Draco stop and turn. Harry approached, and Draco could make out the concern in his face, illuminated as it was by the soft light pouring out of the office building.
He dropped a pile of files in front of her, the updated RSVP list and final bills from the florist and liquor supplier among them, and laid the invitation on top. There; it was done. He stepped away quickly, unable to bring himself to think too much about it. If he did, he might break down again.
standing unassumingly between
“Do you want me to come with you, or—?”
“Thanks, love,” Charlie said cheerfully, and Draco cringed.
“Do you believe in true love? That there’s one special someone out there destined for you?”
Potter would return tomorrow. Well, that gave Draco a deadline, at least. He’d have to figure this all out by tomorrow.
The lift doors closed in front of them, leaving Draco and his cousin alone in the corridor. Draco stiffened, unsure what this was about.
The unspoken response travels through Harry’s body like an earthquake, a tremor strong enough to rattle the foundations of his carefully constructed walls.
And that’s not even counting the only ones whose opinion I actually do care about. Like Ron, who is vicariously living out his childhood auror aspirations through me these days, and Hermione… You don’t know her all that well yet, but let me tell you, you do not want to be on the receiving end of her Frown of Disappointment. It’s like the worst mix of disapproval, pity, annoyance, and frustration, all rolled into one. I can already hear her chiding interrogation: ‘Oh, Harry, what did you do?’, ‘Without a backup plan? Whatever were you thinking?’, followed by, ‘Merlin, Harry, you can’t just… You must think about…’, and the million-galleon question: ‘What are you going to do?’
“Fuck…” Harry moaned again as his palms moved over the soft, thin fabric of Draco’s vest, detecting well-defined muscle underneath. “I want… I need…”
Smaug looked up at him from his place on the entryway floor and tilted his head in interest. He may be a three-legged rescue animal, and he may have the imploring eyes of Antonio Banderas’ Puss in Boots, but sometimes, enough is just enough. Especially at late o’clock after a frantic fundraiser night.
Draco’s eyes flashed and Harry quickly averted his gaze to pick up his pyjama top from the floor. Wriggling into it, he paused to shudder as he felt warm hands gliding over his bare skin and strong arms encircling his waist from behind. He let out a soft moan and relaxed into the embrace, letting his head fall back to rest on Draco’s shoulder. Draco nuzzled his neck and hummed in agreement, leaving feather-light kisses on Harry’s tender skin.
Sent: I do indeed know many things, Potter. Just spell it out already.
And Draco wanted to believe him. So. Fucking. Much. His rational brain told him to not be delusional, but for once, his heart seemed to have taken over control because he nodded.
“Wanna know a secret?” Your murmured words, so close to my ear I can feel your hot breath ghosting over my skin, send a shiver down my spine.
His voice was loud and clear, brimming with excitement, but surely Harry must have heard him wrong?
The sound of running water reaches him from the bathroom and Harry fights the images popping up in his head without his consent. A wet, naked Draco is the last thing he needs to occupy his mind right now. If his gut isn’t totally out of tune, Draco is in need of a friend tonight, not a horny pervert.
Harry doesn’t need to be told twice. Whatever strange alternate universe he’s just entered, there’s no chance he’d ever pass up the opportunity to finally find out what Draco tastes like. Heat rushing through his veins, Harry closes the distance between them.
It didn’t mean Harry wanted to “mate” with him, though.
Harry tried to engage in conversation with the other adults around him, but his mind was elsewhere. Mrs Finch-Fletchley, who was just in front of them — Harry couldn’t for the life of him remember her first name — told him all there was to know about her family’s holiday plans, her husband’s promotion, and something about a mischievous crup that had…? Harry had no clue. All he could do was nod along and try to hum in the right places. However, no matter how much Harry tried not to, his gaze kept drifting back to Draco over and over again. And the worst part; he was pretty sure Draco had noticed.
“Fuck me, Draco…” Harry pleaded, looking over his shoulder in search of Draco’s face. He had lost his glasses somewhere along the line, but Draco’s features were still clear as day before him, so close was he as their eyes met. “Want to… your cock… Please,” he added, just before Draco growled and captured his mouth in a feral kiss.
“Feel this?” Harry lowered his hips to grind his hard cock along the crease of Draco’s arse, eliciting a throaty moan straight from Draco’s core. “Fuck, Draco, you’re driving me crazy. I want—”
No. Although all parts of the man he loves, they aren't what obliterates any final barriers Harry may have held around his heart. What finally does it is the little sobs that escape Draco's lips, the soft moans, the litany of words spilling from Draco's now unfiltered mouth.
Until the day Harry had decided to borrow Pigwidgeon to deliver a letter.
Merlin, that
- Harry
Actually, come to think of it, maybe I should take a step back and let you do just that. Surely, you’d prefer to exchange letters with one of them instead of me. I can’t deny that I’ve come to look forward to our weekly thing, but if you’d rather write to any of them just let me know, all right?
“All right.” Warily, Draco stepped across the room, searching Charlie’s features for any signs of the man having been hit with an overpowered Cheering Charm. He took the seat next to the bed and looked around for something to say. The silence stretched on for what felt like several minutes while Charlie just stared at Draco with a curious expression. Eventually, Draco’s self-consciousness got the best of him.
“He did?”
Affection. Hope. Desire.
Everyone else got back yesterday, and it already feels like these last two weeks never happened. Except something’s up with Ron, and I can’t figure out what it is. It’s not like he’s avoiding me or anything, he still talks and jokes like always, but it’s forced somehow, like he’s hiding something. It’s probably nothing. He’s been with his grieving family for two weeks, after all, so it wouldn’t be strange if he came back a little rattled, would it? And maybe it’s just the sorrow he’s trying to hide, but I still can’t shake the feeling there’s something else he’s not telling me.
Draco met Harry’s green eyes and his prior resolve to come clean was halted by the challenge he saw blazing in them. Well, fuck that.
Slyvia reached out and put a hand onto Draco’s shoulder, giving him a knowing smile. “With a man?”
“Wonderful. We’ll see you then.”
"So I told Kingsley that I'd work for him part-time, but I really want to get my wizarding law mastery before I commit to a specific path," Hermione was saying to Percy who nodded.
That was all the invitation Harry needed. In one swift move, he was straddling Draco’s legs, his hands roaming over Draco’s bare skin, only pausing momentarily to squeeze the swell of Draco’s arse cheeks through thin fabric before venturing further, exploring the expanse of Draco’s back.
“Anytime.” Draco winks and returns to his food.
“Huh?” Harry turned to face him with a confused frown.
Harry laughed out loud, drawing his roommates’ attention.
"Gnomes."
Harry barely registered the first knock, drowned out as it was by Teddy’s coming down the stairs. The boy had been coaxed to change into his pyjamas, bribed by the promise of marshmallows topping off his hot chocolate, and even though it would probably send him into another sugar rush, Harry figured it’d be worth it. If nothing else, just to experience the beaming smile that had overtaken Teddy’s face once Harry’d made his proposition.
“Oh, Godric,” Harry exclaimed behind him before promptly bursting into a fresh bout of laughter. “I think I split my jeans.”
. Leave it to Charlie to pick this very moment to finally notice him in that way. Draco wanted to sob in frustration.
Draco choked and sobered at the declaration.
Smaug blinked and dropped his head back down.
“Good.” Harry stood and stretched his legs, scanning the crowd for any familiar faces. Not until Teddy’s impatient bouncing-on-the-spot reverberated up his arm did he realise he’d placed a hand on the boy’s shoulder, apparently unwilling to let him out of reach again.
It all sounded so incredible. Him; a mystery-solver. One of the most intelligent wiz—
“What are you…” Merlin, his words sounded so ominous. “What’s going to—”
Draco blinked. “Yeah, sorry. I’m just a bit tired, I guess. How is he?”
“Right, well, enough of that. I’ll take your things home and hopefully, you’ll wake up tomorrow, and we can get this all cleared up.” He took a step closer to the door then hesitated, glancing back. “You’re a lucky man, Charlie Weasley. I hope you realise that.”
Myrtle understood him, though. Loud and whiny as she was, she listened. She cared. Which was more than could be said about most people in his life these days.
don’t want this, my magic will let go and eventually find someone else with whom I’ll be compatible. So if you’re doing this out of pity, or if you feel like it’s an obligation, please don’t.”
“So,” Draco started, turning around, “What brought you here tonight?”
“As if I care. They’re delicious.”
Draco’s lips curve into a pleased smile that makes Harry’s insides flutter. “Yeah, that sounds perfect.”
"Can I remove the blindfold now? Seriously?"
“You’ve come to the right place,” I say instead. “Come on.” I stand up and gesture for you to do the same. “My spare room is yours for the taking, and tomorrow we’ll go out and get you anything you need, okay?”
Reaching out a tentative hand, Harry finally allowed himself to touch, letting his fingertips trace the wrinkles on Draco’s forehead, brushing the pad of his thumb lightly over Draco’s rosy cheek, trailing tentative fingers through the soft curls of his long white beard. Under his palm, Draco’s chest heaved in sync with every shallow inhale and Harry found himself adjusting his own breathing to follow the same rhythm.
“I love you too, Draco.” He lifts his spoon and points it at mine. “Now, let’s eat this supposed delicacy before it all turns into soup.”
"It's perfect. Just us."
“I’ve seen the heartbreak, okay?” Harry says firmly, wanting this conversation over and done with already. “I’m not sure I’m up to experience it first-hand.”
“Then…” Harry hesitated, summoned his resolve, tried again. “Then, by all means, be my guest…”
The otherworldly vision of Draco, glowing and magnificent, is the last thing Harry sees before the world fades to black.
Draco wants this. Draco wants him. He’s been wanting Harry for years, damn it — and here they’ve been going around stupidly hiding their stupid feelings behind stupid walls when they could have been doing this all along.
It had been three days since his disastrous wedding. Three days of no Floo calls, no letters, no drop-ins from the Weasleys. He’d started to wonder if he’d ever hear from them again, and if he were honest with himself — which he probably should be, shouldn’t he? — the thought terrified him.
“Yes, that’d be lovely,” Draco said, smiling.
“It’s not that I don’t want them to be happy; of course, I do. It’s just…” Harry stares unseeingly at the remains of their shared dinner, a traditional Swiss cheese fondue Draco claimed he’d always wanted to try. “It’s hard, you know, to see them together and being reminded of my own loneliness…”
“Right.” Harry’s jaw twitched. His eyes were intriguingly dark, but it seemed like he too wanted to pretend nothing had happened. “Can I escort you to the party tonight? I can Side-along you.”
“Smart snake,” Draco says, smirking.
Draco closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, then nods. “Then let’s just tell people we’re dating, all right? Would you mind? Dating me?”
“And Potter?” Harry stopped halfway up the stairs and turned to seek out Zabini in the crowd. “Fetch Draco, will you?”
“So do you help with firework displays often?” Draco asked.
. Because if anyone deserved the epithet, it was Draco — the stunning blond angel, with his lust-blown eyes and his kiss-swollen lips, his usually-so-pale porcelain skin now flushed with colour.
As Draco watched, the girl glanced over to the table where her companion sat waiting for her, a bright-eyed girl with soft honey-coloured curls and a shy smile. She blushed as she noticed Blondie watching her, worrying her bottom lip while absentmindedly straightening her skirt under the table. Blondie clearly couldn’t take her eyes off her, and Draco wouldn’t be surprised if this was their first date. He fought a smile; judging by Blondie’s nervous fiddling, decaf was probably a wise choice.
“I don’t mean we should pretend none of it ever happened or anything, just, you know…” Harry shrugged. “It did, it’s done, and there’s nothing we can do about it now. We’re both who we are because of it, but there’s no need for us to let it rule our present — or our future…”
“Drop it. Leave your checklist and expectations at home. You should be in discovery mode, not ticking off items from a list. You’re getting to know someone, someone real, not expecting them to be someone you’ve never even met.” Harry nods. When put like that, it does make sense. “Don’t worry if they’re ‘the one’ or not, don’t think that far ahead. Just enjoy the moment and appreciate the person in front of you for who they are.”
“Sure about that?” he asks, and damn it; Harry can hear the smug smirk curving his lips without even looking.
“Oh, Gods,” Draco moans, and Harry stops himself from burying his face in the feathers like he wants to, eager to smell them up close, to feel them caress his face.
Draco’s voice is choked, muffled behind his hands. “I’ve tried… Gods, I’ve tried so hard to suppress it, and I’ve managed it until now, but it’s getting to be too much and I’m just not strong enough to hold it in anymore and… I
Her words rushed through Draco like a calming draught, making him relax for the first time in what felt like ages. Charlie was safe.
I can easily see you in all the professions you mention, and I’m just as certain you’d excel at any of them as I am about me not doing so. I am
“I didn’t expect company…” Harry blurted a moment later when they’d eventually made it to his bedroom door. His hand fumbled blindly for the handle, left to its own devices while the rest of him refused to focus on anything but Draco.
In short, he looked good, and he knew it. It was almost a shame to cover the outfit with the customary black satin dress robes, but he’d take that off quickly enough. He just needed it for his entrance, which he was currently making to the accompaniment of appreciative gazes from all across the room.
“Come on.” Harry takes Draco’s hand from his hip, wrapping his fingers around Draco’s as he shuffles off the couch to stand in front of him. “Let’s get you cleaned up so we can do dirty things in my bed later.”
I’m concerned by your words, though. He assured me he’d be able to heal you, but now you make it sound like that spell did more damage than he ever let on. Please tell me it didn’t cause any permanent injury to anything vital, or I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to look you in the eye again.
Harry blinked.
Forty-five minutes later, and Draco still couldn’t wrap his head around this new twist of fate life’s just hurled his way. While the Healer examined Charlie for the alleged — and decidedly non-existent — brain damage, Draco attempted to get close enough to Sirius to kick him in the shin. No matter how much he tried, though, the man kept inching away.
PPS Free drinks all night, eh? Sweet. Sounds like a win-win for me. Either I get an evening of free beer or I get the pleasure of drinking you under the table. Hmm, I wonder what Drunco Malfoy is like… Loud and testy, or weepy and whiny?
Naively, Draco had thought that would be it, but then he’d forgotten just how stubborn and insistent Gryffindors could be when they put their minds to something. It wasn’t even two weeks before Ron was back, this time with his jokester brother in tow, waxing lyrical about the idea to him before they were even seated in the armchairs in the cosy living-room-ish corner. George had taken one sip of his hazelnut latte, groaned in delight, and that was all it took for him. He was sold on the idea, claiming he’d do almost anything to have access to a place like Beans & Serendipitea within walking distance from his shop.
He’d never regretted leaving the magical world, but being in Harry’s home — Merlin, he still couldn’t believe he was actually in
“Right. Of course, you know. Because you work there.” The embarrassment in Harry’s voice made the corner of Draco’s mouth twitch. “Anyway, the Wheezes are in charge of the fireworks display, and Ron and I were supposed to transport the supplies this evening. It’s my only night available, but Hermione started having some early contractions, and they are monitoring her at St Mungo’s, so I—”
And yes, Snape and my mother were indeed friends. I know it sounds impossible, that was my first reaction too, but believe me. I’ve even seen some of the memories from his childhood confirming it. And if that wasn’t enough, did you ever see his patronus? I did. It was a doe, just like my mum’s, and you know what that means, right?
“Definitely,” Draco said, brushing past Harry and dropping his box on the floor. He stepped out and waited as Harry closed the door behind him and locked it. “So another trip?”
Potter laughed quietly, his voice fading as he approached the stairs. “Jet lag.”
So, that’s that. Now they all know.
I’m pleasantly surprised to read that you finally seem to have become aware of your own imperfections, though. That’s a rather big step for you, isn’t it, allowing yourself the benefit of the doubt regarding your supreme excellence? I’ve been trying to imagine what your childhood must’ve been like, a peaceful, sheltered life with your doting parents in a ginormous house out in the countryside. So far from what I grew up with, it might as well have been in a different universe entirely. With that in mind, I guess your patented, self-assured haughtiness isn’t all that surprising; I bet your parents reminded you of your unrivalled brilliance every single day.
“But… if you don’t have any memories of us—”
. “But then you saved me. You’re a hero.”
Draco looked over at Harry who was intent on the sky, the corners of his lips curved into a slight smile. He considered the handshake from earlier, the laughter, the humming, and realised he really didn’t want to be angry with this man.
The Burrow was…indescribable. Draco literally had no words. His mind could hardly take it all in: the people, the house, the decor, the spirit of Christmas infused into every nook and cranny.
Draco turns, meeting Harry’s gaze with eyes drawn in despair. “Harry? Oh Merlin, I’m sorry.” He jumps down from the ledge, turning to lean against it as he shakes his head and lets it fall into his hands. “I’m so sorry, I— I thought I could… I tried to keep you out of this.”
“Charlie?”
Draco nodded. "I just don't want to be holding you back."
Another fundraising party down, and now the orphanage would hopefully have enough money to build the new playground before spring arrived. It was one of Pansy’s pet charities, and one she always suckered him into helping with. He’d never tell her it was one of his favourites too.
Draco raises an eyebrow over silvery eyes twinkling with mischief. He leans in, his warm breath heating Harry's core as much as his words as he whispers in Harry’s ear. “Yes, and if you’re good, we may even find out what else I can do while flying.”
Draco had never shared a bedroom with anyone before, not even his parents. And except for the rare occasion his parents brought him along on one of their holidays, he’d always spent his nights in this very room. Honestly, Draco wasn’t even sure he’d ever be able to sleep anywhere else. But he had to. He wouldn’t be back until just before Christmas, for Salazar’s sake. And right now, that felt like an eternity away, what with summer still holding on for dear life, seemingly not wanting to let go just yet.
“Draco!” Charlie called, sounding inordinately pleased to see someone he barely knew. Though he did think they were engaged, so there was that. “Come, sit. Let’s talk.”
“Cheese?” Molly eyed him with a sceptical frown.
Draco focused his attention on the man before him, his heart skipping a beat as nervously, Harry licked his lips.
Draco clenched his fist, missing the sharp sensation of the coin’s edge digging into his palm. He needed it back. After all this time, he couldn’t imagine going a single day without it. He needed the comfort it provided, the reminder not to lose his faith, its promise that
Smaug yipped from beside him on the bed, and Draco smiled. “You do approve, then?”
It only took him seventeen minutes to compose his first text message.
Harry peers down at Orion, enjoying the way his beautiful emerald scales gleam in the early June sunshine. It's a beautiful day, but Harry is too nervous to really enjoy it, too keyed up about his evening plans for his boyfriend's nineteenth birthday.
Apparently, though, my brain-to-mouth filter had switched off earlier in the evening, because next thing I know, Nott and Zabini (who just happened to be close enough at the time to notice my unintentional muttering) were staring at me, incredulous. So I told them. Not right there in the pub, of course, or anyone could have listened in, but later, on the walk back to the castle. I had no idea how they’d react, but once I told them, they were actually kind of cool about it. At least after Zabini was done with his usual teasing banter. You know how he is. ‘So that’s why you’re always in such a good mood on Saturdays? Interesting.’ With that smug smirk of his that makes you want to thump him in the mouth. Insufferable twat is what he is.
“You’re beautiful,” Harry said. How could he not? He wanted to reach out and touch him, but his hands were occupied holding his thighs close to his sides, presenting his achingly empty hole for Draco’s cock. “I can’t believe you’re—”
“You…” Draco frowns, searching Harry’s face as he wraps his hand around Harry’s arm. “You sure you want to…?”
He may be fated with the same orphan destiny as I, but I’m eternally grateful to know that he’ll never have to suffer through the same loveless childhood I did. I wish I could assure you that my relatives treated me well before the first manifestation of my magic, but no. If I’m being perfectly honest, I can’t remember a single moment of love or affection aimed my way during my nearly 16 years in their ‘care’.
Draco’s eyes wandered back to the door to Charlie’s room, and he sighed. “I’ll figure it out.”
— and adjusted his messenger bag on his shoulder as he moved to leave. Only now did Draco notice he was wearing his coat and a long knitted scarf wrapped loosely around his neck, ready to head out in the chilly autumn air. Draco was just instructing himself to take up breathing again as Harry turned around, hand on the front door handle, and added, “I hope you eat meat.”
"Exactly," Draco agreed. "Well, except for dinner."
Which, in hindsight, probably wasn’t the best thing to do, given the rain that had frozen across the ground.
“Oh, settle down. I don’t normally take in wild animals. He’s a rescue. He has a birth defect and was born with only three legs, and we found him on the Reserve at about three weeks old, abandoned by his mother, starving and cold. I hand fed him until he was bigger, but by then, he was so acclimated to humans that it wasn’t safe to just put him back out in the wild. Besides, baby foxes usually stay with their parents until the autumn after they were born, so at this point, he’s only been with me a few extra months.”
, Draco’s mind supplied — and surprisingly, former Tri-Wizard Champion Fleur Delacour, and an older, dark-haired man that looked oddly familiar, although Draco was sure they had never met.
You stand in front of the mirror, one hanger in each hand, holding up one shirt and then the other in front of your bare chest. Your lower lip is caught between your teeth and your brow is furrowed, both innocent victims of your uncharacteristic uncertainty. You light up as you catch my reflection in the mirror, turning around with a bright smile.
“So, anatomy, huh?” he blurted. “Thinking of becoming a Hea— doctor?”
“Come on, Potter, have you ever heard of a Slytherin who’d place a bet on something they didn’t fully believe in?”
Received: Awww, how sweet of you. I never thought you had it in you tbh 😉
Received: Haha, your hilarious, Malfoy.
Harry takes a moment to focus on the intricate matter of measuring the loose leaf tea into their mugs, knowing Draco will notice — and complain — if he fails to get the water-tea ratio just right. The man is a finicky one to live with, to say the least, not that it came as any surprise to Harry when he moved in. What did surprise him, though, is how much Harry doesn’t mind.
Draco narrows his eyes. “You wouldn’t dare.”
. He’d had enough torture for one evening. In one graceful swoop, Draco grabbed Harry’s wrists and pinned them to the bed above his head. And fuck if Harry’s eyes didn’t turn a darker shade of desire just then. Draco nearly growled at the sight. “You’re aware I’ve been hard since the moment I lay down on this bed, right?”
“Lovely.” Draco turned up the charm another notch to veil his growing annoyance. “Anything else?”
he mused, smiling at the thought. “Come on, I’ll make us breakfast.”
“Are you okay, honey?” Her voice was quiet, concerned, and Draco decided to be honest.
“Hmm…” Draco furrowed his brow in contemplation. “I don’t know, it might be worth it…”
“Five, actually.”
“I’m not going to jump you,” he promises, noticing Draco’s shoulders tense. “Yet.” He flashes Draco a mischievous grin and revels in the low rumble of Draco’s answering chuckle. “You have a tattoo?” he asks superfluously as he raises his hand to trace what indeed looks like an intricate tattoo of a leafless tree. At Harry’s touch, the tree blooms with leaves, surprising him enough to quickly withdraw his hand as if he’s been burned.
“She was right,” Draco told the dog. “I’m a right miserable, old sod. People will come to this event, ready to spend lots of money to help students all afford new wands and books before going off to Hogwarts, and I’ll be there, scaring them all away with my brooding.”
Only, as soon as he does, Draco’s gaze flicks down, taking in Harry’s worried lip before hastily returning to Harry’s again. Harry watches as those warm, grey eyes widen in comprehension and then his heart skips a beat as Draco’s lips part around a sharp intake of breath.
She slid her hands into the pockets and paused, drawing out several tins of cat food. She set them on the table. “Weird.”
Received: With the green ceiling...
“Draco, you came! Come on in. We don’t fit in here anymore, so everyone’s in the front sitting room that stretches off the kitchen. Arthur and Bill added it for me a couple of years ago when everyone started getting married and we needed more space.” She kept talking as she led him into a busy kitchen, food piled on the table, counters, and sideboards, and countless Weasleys scattering in all directions. “Do you know everyone?” she asked.
Sent: Poisonous reptiles?
“Hey!” Sirius called from across the room. “You guys are standing under the mistletoe!”
“No, I mean, I’ve never dated a man before, I don’t know what to do.”
But he’ll come around eventually, he always does, sooner or later. He just needs some time to adjust. And don’t you worry, Draco, he knows better than to give any ultimatums of the sort you’re envisioning. He learnt that lesson the hard way the winter before the end of the war. Deep down, he knows he can’t control who I choose to hang out with, and if I want to keep you in my life, he’ll just have to deal.
“Too long, eh?” he murmurs. “Then what are you waiting for?” Draco leans closer, the heady scent of his luxurious soap invading Harry’s senses, his hot breath ghosting over Harry’s skin as he adds, “Kiss me.”
Come to think of it, I doubt you even knew Teddy existed, did you? Well, he’s Andromeda’s grandson and, I guess, your cousin. He’s not even a year old, born only a few weeks before the final battle, and since both his parents were killed that night, Andromeda is his guardian now. When she’s teaching, Molly Weasley takes care of him, but when he’s not at the Burrow, I’m helping Andromeda with him as much as I can. He’s such a ray of sunshine, that kid, and I swear his laugh is enough to make anyone smile, despite how low they may feel otherwise.
“When did he get it?” Harry shot at Draco.
“Because you’re… naked?”
He rocked his hips back to meet Harry’s thrust, only to be left whimpering in frustration as Harry rose up on all fours above him, putting far too much space between them. Draco glanced over his shoulder to find Harry staring back at him, emerald eyes dark and burning with desire.
It still looked the same, everything still as neat and polished as it’s always been, every piece of furniture in the same spot, every tapestry on the same wall, every ornament where it’s always been. Yet, it didn’t feel like home anymore. It was no longer the safe haven he’d been homesick for those first few months — well, okay then, years — after leaving for Hogwarts.
Art by the crazy-talented
Malfoy shrugs, rising from his seat. “He’s just never shown any interest in me, is all.”
Too bad my body still seems unwilling to get the message.
And as for his unwavering loyalty, I guess you’ll just have to trust me. But if it helps, yes, Dumbledore was indeed dying, infected by an extremely dark curse that had been sapping him for nearly a year. Snape did all he could to try to heal him, but in the end, there was nothing to be done. Cue, Backup Plan Let’s-Secure-Your-Standing-With-the-Noseless-One.
“I—” Draco hesitated and realised he had. “The song you were humming.”
“It’s Santa,” Teddy insisted.
He took a deep breath and looked into her hazel, Hufflepuff eyes. “Deal. Thanks, love. I don’t know how I’d do this without you.”
The soft rumble of Draco’s chuckle vibrates through Harry’s veins, making him hot all over. “Keep them,” he says, drawing back to look Harry in the eye. “I’ve already got exactly what I wanted.”
“Your ‘constant vigilance’ can use some fine-tuning,” Malfoy says. Because of course he’s noticed Harry’s startled reaction.
And I can tell it’s just what you needed to hear. I can see it in the way you relax, imperceptible to anyone else but so obvious if you know what to look for. As the tension subsides, leaving room for relief and gratitude, something is constricting in my chest, a dull ache that only grows when a sweet smile curves your lips.
"Well, I mean, I think our first time doing

“Oh, he’s fine.” Harry grinned behind the rim of his cup. “It’s mostly adrenaline, I think. Not every day you start a whole new era of your life.”
?” He looked horrified.
“Hi, Harry.”
And especially not after Draco decides to return the favour.
(See the end of the chapter for
Not that Harry could blame him. He was just as captivated by Draco’s presence as the boy was, albeit for very different reasons. He tried to keep his eyes away — honestly, he did — but they were drawn back to the man, again and again, noticing his rounded belly moving as he laughed, his wrinkled hands cradling the cup, and the sticky foam of melted marshmallows catching in his moustache whenever he took another sip.
He stepped into the next room, the main reception area used by anyone coming or going as the Reserve was warded against Apparition to prevent disturbances for the dragons. The intern, currently serving as receptionist, nodded as Draco waved and stepped into the Floo.
“Y-You could?”
The Minister smiled, his eyes bright with enjoyment. “I’m exceedingly well, thank you. I hear you’re the mastermind behind this entire event. Might I say, well done, sir. It’s very impressive.”
Received: Whatever strikes your fancy

“Yes, that was my plan. I was hoping to be there within the hour.”
Received: YES! That’s it!
Draco barely slept all night. He tossed and turned as random flashes from the previous days jumped out at him, small things that all seemed unrelated, but when put together, pushed him to question his choices.
The official’s jaw dropped, but he gathered himself quickly. “I haven’t gotten to that part yet.”
He’d soon learnt that his snake had a ridiculous obsession with human mating.
“I deal with most of the suppliers, actually,” Harry said from behind him. “That includes the difficult ones.”
“Mr Potter! What an honour it is to see you! Yes, Mr Malfoy here is indeed doing amazing work.”
me!” Because hearing Potter call him Draco made him think of that night, made him relive the tenderness, the sweet caresses, the feigned affection. “You said we’d be friends. You said I’d have a brilliant time. Guess what? You were wrong! You’re a fucking liar, and I hate you so much I can’t even…”
So yeah, my Valentine’s was really wicked. Just as pink-tinted and romantic as you’d expect it to be. Not. In fact — and I’m only telling you this to, again, prove how little you know me — I spent the day with Teddy over at Andromeda’s quarters.
“Yes.”
Sirius conjured a chair next to Draco and took a seat, his graceful movements betraying his pure-blood upbringing. Draco recognised it from his own childhood, and he suddenly realised that this man, who he didn’t even know, had numerous memories of Narcissa that Draco didn’t.
Harry shrugged. “Do you like it?”
Harry chews his food absent-mindedly, recalling the sight of Draco halfway up that climbing wall not even an hour before. His lithe body must have been made for climbing, all long and lean and pure muscle.
“Splendid.”
“I bet he’s really confused too, though. Maybe he just needs some time.”
,” Malfoy announces as they’re finally seated in the British Museum’s cafeteria with two generous portions of Caesar salad on the table between them. “Any idea what it’s about?”
Draco shook his head, unable to take anymore. “Right, well, that’s my cue to go.”
Harry rolled his eyes, refusing to acknowledge the thrill running up his spine. “Yes, I’m
“I don’t think it’s about the big things, though,” Draco argued. “It’s the little, everyday things that can make you a hero. You care about the dragons every single day.”
Saturday 12 June 1999
Harry stepped in, looking around the flat in curiosity. “Nice place. Very posh, sure, but not what I expected.”
Molly and Arthur stood huddled together in the opposite corner, looking at Charlie like they couldn’t believe such a horrible thing would happen and yet like it all made the greatest sense in the world. Over by the window, Ginny and George kept snickering, undoubtedly going over what kind of pranks they could play on Charlie given his current state. Ron and Bill barely paused in their game of Exploding Snap,  seemingly unconcerned while Percy appeared to keep his emotions in check by studiously scowling at everyone involved.
“Please, don’t,” Harry hastens to cut him off. He’s heard the same speech from plenty of his friends these past few months. He doesn’t need to hear it from Draco too.
Intrigued, Harry tries again, this time drawing the entire, raspberry-coloured bud into his mouth, twirling his tongue around it and flicking it back and forth.
“Thanks.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “For Salazar’s sake. I know he just thinks he’s being funny, and I couldn’t care less about the pathetic jibes he still insists on throwing my way, but… Surely he must realise how it’s affecting the kids?”
Gryffindor Tower, Hogwarts
When he returned to the sitting room, the armchair Draco had been sitting in was empty and it took Harry a moment before he noticed the man standing off in the corner perusing the Christmas tree. It really did look chaotic, just like you’d expect from a tree decorated by an over-excited five-year-old and their very indulgent godfather. Harry liked it, though. Not that it was all that aesthetically pleasing to look at — it definitely wasn’t — but because it reminded him of how enjoyable Christmas could be for a kid who’d never had to experience the kind of childhood he himself had. Every time he looked at it, it made him love the holiday even more.
And no, we’re not excluding Goyle. Or, at least, I’m quite sure we wouldn’t if he’d been here. He’s not, though. He never came back after summer and I have no idea where he is. Your friends never talk about him, not within my earshot anyway, and when I asked Zabini about it the other day, he was being very evasive, wondering why I was asking and so I didn’t pry any further. Maybe he’d tell me if he knew I was asking for you, but since I haven’t told anyone about
“How come I’ve never heard about this before?”
“Relax,” he’d said.
Your auror in training,
Received: It is. The greater good is gonna be soooo gooooooood
. But he insisted, and from the looks of it, he seems to have managed somehow.
“Then would you relax for a minute, you hot-blooded berk? I was just about to say how much I like the personal touch with the hand-made garlands, but now I’m not sure I want to anymore.”
Anyway, I’m suddenly painfully aware that I never did apologise for what I did to you that day. And maybe I shouldn’t do this in a letter, but since I don’t want to wait until next year to do it, let me just say it now: I’m sorry, Malfoy. I’m so terribly sorry. And believe it or not, I am grateful that you survived. I’m not asking your forgiveness, but I hope you’ll at least accept my long-overdue apology. Otherwise, I fear this friendship will be even weirder than it already is.
Maybe this was what it felt like; being as happy as the Malfoys.
They're near the doors to the Owlery when they hear a soft hiss.
” Ron’s squeak echoed Draco’s sentiment, sounding just as shocked as Draco felt. Everyone else started to chatter excitedly, and Molly’s voice rose above the rest.
“Yeah, get this. I’m engaged.”
“Ah, hmm…” Charlie looked embarrassed. “About that. It’s not really her fault; I know she hates the smell of whisky, and I may have had a bit to drink before I went over to check on her in the paddock.”
Mouth dry, I take another swig of my ale, only to find my glass empty. I try to act as if it’s not, pretending to savour the taste and swallow as expected, feeling like an utter fool. It’s not the first time I’ve made the same mistake tonight either, but I hope to Merlin you haven’t noticed. If you were to ask the reason for my being so preoccupied, I wouldn’t be able to come up with a reasonable answer.
Received: Oh, yessss. Please do cum and dance around my drunken body...
Harry looked guilty, his eyes shifting away and his shoulders hunching. “I dunno. Something like Malfoy Manor, I guess? This looks really comfortable, though.”
And he
The dog licked his wrist and looked up into Draco’s eyes. It almost felt like it was trying to assure Draco everything would all be okay.
Sent: Are you American?
“No!” Harry got out, wiping tears from his eyes. “I’m not letting you see my bare arse.”
The man had regained a little colour, so that was good, and the bandages covering the burns on his arms had been removed, exposing new, pink skin shiny with potions. Draco set the gift bag he’d brought on the rolling hospital table and took a seat next to Charlie.
Merlin, the way his voice quavered, Draco was almost tempted to believe Harry was just as affected by all this as he was. He swallowed, but his reply still came out all weak and gravelly as it tumbled out of his mouth.
“Draco.”
“Hi,” Harry murmured, ignoring the roughness in Draco’s voice and the tremble of anticipation it sent down his spine. “I thought you were—”
Sent: It's for the greater good, after all…
Didn’t know you were such a fan of metamorphmagi. And here you’ve been cousins with one for your entire life without knowing… What a shame. Teddy hasn’t started morphing yet, fortunately. I don’t even want to know what babysitting him will be like once he does.
“I used to think so, yes.” Draco returns his gaze to the ceiling and Harry watches his throat bob as the man swallows. “I used to think I’d found him once, but…”
However, when Draco entered the bathroom, Myrtle wasn’t the one there to greet him. Instead, standing in the corner, hands deep in his jeans pockets, leaning against one of the sinks, was…
Draco felt sick as he laid eyes on the limp body in Hagrid’s arms. He looked so small lying against the half-giant’s door-sized frame, so vulnerable with his head thrown back over one thigh-thick forearm, his throat bared for anyone to slash like a sacrificial lamb. So utterly defenceless.
“Nah, I think I’m going to take a shower.”
“No, he’s fine!” Draco cut her off, feeling irritated. “Well, as fine as he can be.” He paused and drew his wand, putting up a privacy shield around them. “Why did you tell everybody I was his fiancé?”
So, care to tell me when you suddenly decided to become such a blooody romantic? Because I sure as hell can’t remember ever seeing any signs of you being one before? In all the years
“You wish!”

” Draco’s voice was vicious, even to his own ears.
Harry fought back a frustrated groan. “Oh, come off it. They’d like you even if you weren’t all dressed up, you prat. You made them feel welcome. You made them relax and feel comfortable in a stranger’s company. That was not the costume; that was
“I always pick up the bill,” Harry objects, disgruntled, causing a spray of breadcrumbs to litter his plate.
Draco wanted to roll his eyes. But he didn’t. Small victories. “Yes,
Harry looked up from his spot under the big cherry tree in the Burrow’s orchard to see Fleur Weasley standing a few yards away, waiting for permission to join him. He’d come to be alone, to think, to work through the confusing mess in his head, the whirlwind of emotions in his chest. But maybe… Well, maybe she could help.
Not that Harry was gullible enough to believe this particular man existed. He just wanted someone who made him feel like
He’d never thought of it quite like that. He’d always been too focused on the running-away-with-the-tail-between-his-legs part of it. And here Harry was — noble, honourable Harry — as always, seeing the good and positive in everyone around him. Even Draco. Even though Draco had never done anything to deserve his kindness.
“He…”
“Potter…” You roll your eyes with an exasperated sigh. “Please?”
I should’ve guessed you wanted to go into potions. With the way Snape always made it sound like you were some fucking wonderchild, of course a praise-hungry prick like you would suck it up like a dry sponge and take it as a sign you were destined for brewing. I do get your concerns, though, most people aren’t as tolerant and forgiving as they’d have you believe. But if you decide potions is what you want to do, I’m sure
Draco chuckles. With his wings safely tucked away, he easily drapes an arm around Harry's shoulder as they continue walking. "We need to get him a mate."
“Which one?”
“Perfect.” Harry beamed. “Just the way I like it.”
Saturday 20 March 1999
PS You want to know who let me inside the Slytherin dungeon? Actually, if you must know, it was you, Draco. In our second year. I believe it was on Christmas Day? Don’t you remember? Granted, Ron and I were polyjuiced into Crabbe and Goyle at the time, which is probably why your snotty wards allowed us entrance.
“No need.” Draco only hesitated a brief moment before adding, “So, you look nice.”
Delico Malfoy,
And fuck, what was Draco doing, checking Harry out like a horny teenager? Decidedly tearing his eyes off the man, he turned around to put his own hands onto the icy patch beneath him and crawled to the side where the grass gave him more traction.
“You…? But…” Draco drew back, not much, but far enough for Harry to see the concern in his dark eyes. “I thought you…”
“It’s good to be back,” Charlie agreed, then looked around the room. “Are you all sure I have amnesia? I don’t feel like I do.”
Draco grasped the coin in his pocket, reminding himself to breathe as he let the pad of his thumb glide over its smooth surface, visualising Potter’s engraved silhouette under his skin.
Draco pulls out of Harry and Harry gasps, the sudden emptiness making him feel like there's a vital piece of him missing. But it's not for long. Draco rocks back onto his knees, not sitting, not kneeling, but something in between as he motions for Harry to turn over, grabbing his torso from behind and pulling him up against his chest.
"All right," Draco finally agrees, and Harry relaxes. "But that means we have to get back to it now." He sits up and reaches into his bag, pulling out his textbook. "Granger, what's the alchemical makeup of…"
“There you go.” Draco slid the two mugs of coffee across the counter, studiously keeping his gaze from flicking towards the man watching him from the corner table. “Anything else?”
The Burrow, Devon
However, he wants to know what’s going on in Draco’s head. He always does. Even after all these years, the man is still an enigma, a puzzle Harry’s itching to solve. No, there’s really no point in denying this unhealthy curiosity, at least not to himself. And if his gut isn’t deceiving him, if this is indeed the topic weighing Draco down tonight, Harry doesn’t really need any additional reasons to humour him.
The kettle switches off and Harry pushes his thoughts away as he busies himself with pouring the ninety-three-degrees water into the mugs, making sure to start the timer basically at the same moment the water makes contact with the leaves in Draco’s rainbow mug.
“Draco? Can I come in?”
You open your mouth to try again, but no words come out. Not that I need to hear them; that distraught expression can only mean one thing.
Through the commotion, the dark-haired man made his way over and slapped his hand onto Draco’s shoulder. “Well, little cousin, it seems you’ve saved the day.”
Draco didn’t want to like it, couldn’t allow himself to like it, but his self-preservation had apparently gone out to lunch because Draco didn’t have it in him to break away from Potter’s strong arms and solid frame. The man felt like a steady rock in the middle of a raging sea, an escape from the utter clusterfuck that had lately become Draco’s life. Wanting this,
The air shifted around him and Draco held his breath. He’d been antsy all day, apprehension crawling under his skin, unease stirring in his belly. Yet, when he felt the prickle at the nape of his neck now, he knew the sensation had nothing to do with his inner turmoil. No, this was something else. Someone was in his room, standing behind him, watching him.
“Yeah.” Harry bit his lip, trying not to lose his train of thought as a fresh wave of heat pooled in the pit of his stomach. “You know, that day in Diagon Alley… I even had half a mind to cross that stage and sit down in your lap myself, just for one last chance to be close to you before you left.”
Dinner was amazing. There were so many different foods, so many cheerful people, all of them adamant to include him as much as possible. What felt like dozens of conversations washed over Draco, vying for his attention, asking for his opinion; even Ron and Hermione included him in their discussion about paint colours for their nursery, in which he insisted that green was the best colour for any newborn child. Of course, it was; green is commonly known to be a soothing colour. However, the couple seemed to take it as a joke, and Draco let them, feeling oddly pleased when they both laughed and thanked him.
“You’re not—”
Received: How about tonight?
Charlie. He’d wanted Charlie for ages — wanted to be with him, wanted to know him. And yes, he’d fantasised about being with him in ways both innocent and carnal. But now… Now that Draco had spoken to Charlie at more length, had gotten to know Charlie through the eyes of his family, the rose-coloured lenses had come off.
PS How can you say the Slytherin dungeon isn’t creepy? I mean, it would be creepy enough with just the eerie lighting from those greenish ceiling pendants, but the underwater windows facing the murky lake and its swimming grindylows… weren’t you ever afraid someone’s spell going awry would accidentally break one of those windows and drown you all? I don’t know if I’d ever be able to sleep in a place like that.
bed — stripped down to his underwear, thanking the stars Harry wasn’t able to witness the pressing situation in his low-cut, snugger-than-usual, teal hip briefs. This was absolute torture, just lying here at Harry’s mercy, enduring the gentle touches of those smooth fingertips as they glided over his skin, tracing the length of his muscles one after the other, accompanied by the soft murmur of Harry’s voice as he repeated their Latin names to himself as he went.
father’s name. Yes, he was a half-blood, believe it or not — which is probably why you haven’t found him in your precious pure-blood listings.
"First— What do you mean?"
No, he needed to get over this crush. And he would, eventually, Harry was certain he could do it. But it would take time, more time than the universe seemed willing to give him. Because Draco wasn’t where he should be, a safe distance away in France. He was here, standing in Harry’s hallway, chatting with Teddy, and—
Draco used his wand to move the eight-foot spruce from one corner to the next. It really would look best near the fireplace, but then he wouldn’t be able to see it from the kitchen. He spent a good deal of his spare time there, trying new recipes, playing with new flavours. And dammit, he wanted to see the tree from where he spent his time chopping, mixing, and experimenting. The glow of the fairy lights was one of the best things about Christmas, after all.
Draco trails off, but Harry doesn’t need to hear the end of that sentence. He remembers it all too clearly.
…but still right. So perfectly right. “What do you want to do about us, though?”
One single character stared back at him.
Teddy shook his head, repentant. “N-no, Uncle Harry, I— I’m sorry, but…”
“Too. Many. Clothes,” Draco growled by way of explanation, emphasising every word with an open-mouthed kiss along Harry’s gloriously stubbly jaw.
Draco whirled on Harry and walked backwards, suddenly irate. “But what? I’m an ex-Death Eater? I’m a slimy Slytherin? I can’t grow up and become a different sort of person and find gratification in helping others?” His breathing was coming quickly, and he wasn’t sure if the burning behind his eyes was due to the urge to hex the man or the desire to cry. Either way, it pissed him off, and he whirled back around, slamming the door to the office building behind him as he entered the warm, dry room.
It’s laughable really, thinking about how that naïve bloke in the picture had been so convinced his attraction would fade with time if he only learnt to hide his feelings from the world. It hasn’t, not even a little bit. On the contrary, in the seven months since, it has only grown stronger and fiercer, intensifying in tandem with their developing friendship.
Harry’s eyes dropped from Draco’s face, landing somewhere around Draco’s middle. Draco froze. Surely, his halfie wasn’t that obvious?
“Maybe next year?” Harry’s mouth offered, without his brain’s permission. “You could come over and do it with us. I bet Teddy would like that.”
Draco cleared his voice. “Mr Black.”
“No,” he murmured, surprised by his own surrender. “I— Don’t stop.” Then, “Please.”
Draco reached for the box on the side table. “You know that project I’ve been working on ever since I joined the Department? The one that got me the promotion a few years back?”
“I am?” The boy turned to look at him, then Draco, then the steps before his gaze returned to Draco once more, a huge grin on his face.
And how could any of that ever hold a candle to Harry? Harry, who he’d been in love with once before, whose reappearance in Draco’s life had reintroduced a spark that he hadn’t even noticed was missing. Harry, with his glass-blowing and his family man’s heart. Harry and his green eyes, his kind voice, and his knowing smile.
“Yes, why?” And if he sounded defensive, well, who could blame him?
Draco turned and walked up to the sinks, catching his reflection in the mirror. And yes, he hated that too, the sight of himself so wrecked, so broken. A pathetic mess. Courtesy of Harry Fucking Potter.
Draco laid on his stomach on a bed — on
Harry nods, repeating Draco’s words silently to himself. Interest, listen, questions, eye contact… He doesn’t have any problem doing any of those things whenever he’s with Draco. The man is like a bloody attention magnet, drawing people’s eyes from across the room whenever he opens his mouth. Or just exists, really.
“Y-yes?”
Add to that my attempts to appease this house by trying to stay in as much as possible when I’m not expected at the academy. The end result is a staggering two (!) Sunday brunches between us so far this month, one at their cottage and one here. The rest of the gang I’ve hardly seen at all, every one of us off somewhere, doing something or other, trying to figure out how to do the grown-up thing. (It’s curious how it often feels like we’re all so far beyond our age, thanks to all the things we’ve been through, and yet, the next minute, it’s like we’re just tiny, floundering kids, trying to find our footing in a big scary adult world we know nothing about.)
Light fingers trail down Harry's spine, moving over his hip before gently pushing Harry down onto his stomach. "I love you too. Let me take care of you."
“Yes, I guess I will,” Potter eventually agreed.
“I was born ready.” Draco grinned, causing Harry’s heart to skip a beat. Seriously. If Draco kept throwing him that smile without warning, Harry wouldn’t be surprised if it would, one day, stop his heart altogether. “You haven’t seen me in the costume yet, but once you do, I’m sure you’ll agree.”
(And once again I beat you, 10 to 9 this time.)
“Come on,” Draco continues. “Not all relationships end in heartbreak and you know it. And even if there’s no guarantee, who says the prospect of finding your special someone wouldn’t be worth the risk?”
He stepped farther away, anxious to put some space between them. That had felt too right, too good, and Draco was not ready to deal with any of it. “Wow, look at the time. We really should get going.”
Drawco Malfoy,
“Oh, fuck off.” Harry glares up at him, hating how beautiful the git’s hair looks when kissed by the sun.
Harry’s mind is whirling, trying to make sense of Draco’s words, of any of it. But it’s awfully hard, impossible really, when Draco’s standing there before him, all shimmering wings and perfect skin and soft, silver-blond hair. He’s beautiful, ethereal, almost too much to take in, a sight too precious for his simple human eyes. For a fleeting moment, Harry thinks he shouldn’t be here, that he shouldn’t be allowed to witness this. That he probably should turn around and leave.
Instead, I fetch the potion from the bathroom and bid you goodnight, keeping the walls from falling down.
“Brilliant. I could really use the help.”
Draco’s heart sped up as he started to realise what Charlie was doing.
. The slight rise and fall with each flap of Draco's wings reminds Harry of the beauty and strength of the man in his arms.
“Yes, right, I—” Draco cleared his throat and shifted uncomfortably in his seat, desperate to change the subject. “Your dragon says hi.” According to Charlie’s family, dragons usually were the best way to distract him.
on a chair.”
just around the block, and as Draco approached the door, he realised the walk hadn’t been nearly long enough to prepare him for this. He’d been looking forward to this moment all day and yet, now he was here, a knock away from standing face to face with Harry, in his home, alone, just the two of them… Draco swallowed. He wasn’t ready. There was no way he could ever—
It couldn’t be. It was simply impossible. Draco had seen Potter all grown up, all solid and powerful with his crinkling eyes and silver-streaked hair. Potter had spoken to him, had touched him. Had kissed him. And he’d fucking promised…
When it's finally over, when he's fully wrung dry and ready to collapse, Draco gently lowers him down onto the bed, arms wrapped around him, keeping them joined for as long as possible.
Harry’s gaze falls on the trays hovering by the window.
“Oh, I have,” Malfoy says with a faint smile.
With other girls, I always feel like I have all these expectations to live up to, expectations I already know I’m never going to meet because they have this idolised image of me — this ‘hero’ — and despite what you called me a few letters ago, even you know that’s not who I really am. That I’m just Harry, an ordinary boy who only did what he had to do, and put plenty of people in mortal danger as he did.
Michael Aspel congratulates a white-haired woman who’s just found out her grandmother’s tattered sewing kit is worth a veritable fortune. She’s shocked, of course, but positively giddy. I try to focus on their conversation —
to. He would make it work. He would make Potter proud of him if it was the last thing he did on this earth.
“Draco—”
Molly smiled and nodded. Yes, and in the corner are their two children, Fred and Roxanne. They have inherited their mother’s dark hair, so it’s easy to pick them out in the crowd. Over there are Fleur and Bill’s two girls, Victoire and Dominique. Their baby, Louis, is asleep upstairs. And over there, talking to Hermione, is Molly, Percy’s daughter. The woman next to them is his wife, Audrey.” She flashed Draco a grin that reminded him of the one Charlie often gave when he was teasing the interns. “Are you taking notes? There’ll be a quiz later.”
“I don’t mind if you don’t.” His cocky grin catches me off guard; his reaction so far from the ones I usually get that it takes me a moment to gather my wits.
With a huff of exasperation, Harry eventually banged on the Enter key and then sat back, scrubbing his hands over his face. “Okay. Sorry about that. One of our suppliers is dicking us around, demanding more money before they send us the shipment we’ve already paid for.” He stood up, closed the laptop with a flourish, then smiled and gestured to the storeroom.
People are even worse. Seeing your old housemates interact never fails to alert my attention to anything remotely close to a glimpse of pale-blond hair. And thanks to the bloody study groups, that no longer only happens during classes or meals.
. That poor cat had to be starving.
“My…?”
"Everyone's outside and waiting for you both," Molly said, letting him go and giving Draco a tense but genuine smile. "It's nice to see you, Draco. I'm glad you could come."
“Truly,” Draco deadpans, but he steps closer, close enough for his hot breath to ghost over Harry’s cheek. “Can I kiss you?”
Merlin, I hate this place. Or rather, I hate that this place seems to hate me so much. I’ve been staying here for nearly a week now, and this house still makes me want to leave as soon as I enter the front door. It’s like an itch, a restless feeling coming over me every time I get inside, prickling and creeping across my skin, suggesting I come up with errands to run, friends to visit, laps to run in the park… anything to get back out in the fresh air outside these suffocating walls.
Harry swallows and pushes the tantalising images aside, ignoring the enthusiastic twitch in his pants.
is something entirely different,” Harry murmured as his arms slid down to Draco’s lower back and pulled him closer. Suddenly, Draco was being enveloped in Harry’s embrace, the change making him acutely aware of Harry’s entire body touching his, his chin fitting into the space between Draco’s shoulder and neck, and when Harry spoke again, his voice was a rumble in Draco’s right ear, his breath tickling the hairs on his neck. “A proper
Someone I believe you should’ve been able to know but haven’t been allowed to meet yet (as far as I know) is your aunt Andromeda Tonks. I know your relatives disowned her before you were born, and I guess that if you ever heard of her at all, it mustn’t have been anything good. But she’s a wonderful woman and everyone here loves her. I haven’t experienced her teaching myself since I don’t take Muggle Studies, but Ron and Nev and the others say she’s brilliant. I love having her in the castle, though, especially since it means I get to see my godson Teddy almost every day.
Potter? Here? No.
“Draco,” she said quietly, and the understanding in her voice finally broke him.
“I’m so sorry. It all happened so fast. I was in Charlie’s room, checking on the man I saved from a dragon, the man who worked for my friend, and then you all came in and there were so many of you, everyone talking and worried about Charlie. When someone said I was his fiancé, I was as shocked as you, but then you hugged me, welcomed me into your family—” His eyes burned and his throat was closing up, but he cleared it and kept going, ignoring the quiver in his voice. “And I couldn’t bring myself to tell you the truth; I didn’t want to make you more upset than you already were. And then I didn’t

“Are you kidding me?” Draco chuckles. “There are enough cupcakes in here to satisfy the entire student body of Hogwarts. Twice.”
Draco Ludicrous Malfoy,
The only thing he remembered. Harry didn’t know what the man looked like, but he knew he’d felt safe and cared for, and as though he’d be willing to die for this person. But then, it was only a dream.
And that’s when it all finally snaps into place.
Sent: You do realise that just because the drinks are in front of you, you don't have to drink them?
look like attraction, or infatuation, or…whatever the hell she thought she saw. Draco knew better, though. He’d been the target for those inquisitive eyes before.
Smaug gave a little yip.
“Pans? Is something wrong?”
Draco.”
Drama Llama Malfoy,
“You know what?” she said when he refused to humour her taunting. “Get out of here. Go take a walk or something, then take the rest of the day off to get your head in working order.”
It takes everything I have to keep the walls from falling down.
She huffed and stood up. “Fine, but you’re being stupid.”
weren’t foreign concepts to you. As if you actually longed to experience emotions like that with someone someday.
Our friends seem to have changed topics again. Quidditch, if I were to venture a guess. Ron only gets this passionate when he talks about Quidditch, all high-pitched and lit up, gesturing wildly enough for everyone around him to lean away so as not to accidentally get punched in the face. Or have their drinks knocked over.
“Check.”
“You’ve said that before.” And yes, he sounded like a petulant child, but no, he couldn’t care less.
“All right then.” They come to a standstill on Harry’s doorstep, turning towards each other. Harry can feel the anticipation gathering in the pit of his stomach, a swirl of jittery heat pulsing at his core. “In that case, I think you just passed the exam, Potter. I have nothing more to teach you.”
“Someone’s got to set up those fireworks for tomorrow night. It’s going to be epic.”
“Oh, get over yourself, kid. You know what I mean.”
"You are incredible," Draco murmurs against Harry's skin as his cock finally slips out, his nose buried in the curls at the back of Harry's neck.
Draco turned to the nearest fireplace and realised she was right. There, on the end, was a stocking full of sweets with his name written across it. He swallowed around the lump growing in his throat; he’d never had a stocking before.
“Ah, yeah, sorry.” Harry cleared his throat, regrettably banishing the sexy roughness from his voice. “We’re supposed to be able to name and locate all the muscles in a human body.”
Firstly, the man would either attack him on the spot or turn him in. To the Ministry or the Prophet, Draco honestly wasn’t sure which one would be worse. Not that he was a runaway of any sort — he had served his sentence obligingly before he walked away — but you could never be sure with this man, could never know for certain he wouldn’t want to slice you up if he ever happened to walk in on you unexpectedly.
Harry leaned in and gave Draco a slight hug, of the friendly variety. It was not at all what Draco wanted, but…it was Harry, and therefore more than he had any right to ask for.
“Harry?” Draco’s whisper is so quiet Harry almost doesn’t hear it from all the blood rushing through his ears. A featherlight kiss grazes Harry’s temple, followed by others. His jawline, the sensitive spot under his ear, along his throat, the throbbing vein next to his collarbone. Draco’s gentle touch is almost unbearable. How is Harry supposed to resist this when all he wants is to give in, to give Draco everything? He’s been wanting this for so long, hoping and dreaming for Draco to show any sign of feeling the same way Harry does. The fact that he hasn’t is the only thing holding Harry back now.
“Here. Let me…” Harry’s arm flexed in Draco’s grip and Draco readily obliged, releasing his hold on Harry’s right wrist. Soon, Harry’s hand was snaking its way in between their bodies, his fist wrapping around them both, creating glorious friction for Draco’s aching cock. “Oh fuck, Draco…”
Draco stopped moving and looked into Harry's eyes, his own sparkling with mirth. "I'm afraid you'll just have to wait and see."
“You’d better,” Draco grumbled. Merlin, he hated feeling this out of sorts. And in front of a stranger, no less. Harry Potter or not, Draco did not do uncertain. Not in front of anyone. Ever. Not even his parents.
“Huh.” Harry took his time considering this as he savoured his last mouthful of wine, seemingly unaware of the way the dark red liquid tinted his lips nor the effect this had on Draco’s rapidly increasing heart rate. The sight was so mesmerising Draco nearly didn’t register Harry’s words as he eventually spoke. “Then I guess we might have a problem…”
No sooner has the forbidden thought entered Harry’s mind than he hears the running water being turned off in the bathroom.
And fuck, but it hurts. So damned much. Even my ugly chest monster is hurting enough to huddle up in a foetal position against my thumping heart, its enraged roars replaced by soft, pathetic whimpers. I’m aching to do the same, to let my unsteady knees give out, to sink to the floor right here in the middle of the kitchen and succumb to the pain.
— awesome person, brilliant collab partner, and general Creator of Gorgeousness. Their
And that’s when it happened, right before Harry’s eyes. Draco must have felt it too, because he stilled, lust-blown eyes widening as he stared unblinkingly straight into Harry’s soul. Harry watched in wonder as Draco’s dry, wrinkled skin smoothed out and regained its former lustre, as his white facial hair shortened and eventually disappeared, leaving in its wake neatly shaped eyebrows and those impossibly long golden lashes. Up close like this, they were even more mesmerising than usual, framing Draco’s beautiful eyes like bright rays of pure sunshine. Locks of gorgeous hair, once again cheekbone-length and platinum-blond, fell over Draco’s forehead, making him look dishevelled in a way Harry had never seen him before, except in his wildest fantasies. A fresh spark of arousal travelled down Harry’s spine as he realised just whose hands were responsible for that sexy tousled look.
The bedroom was about what he was expecting now, the blankets a rumpled mess, clothing everywhere, dishes on the nightstand. Draco suppressed a shiver as he turned around, backing out of the terrible cave where Charlie slept. And then he —
“Thanks,” you murmur distractedly, putting one foot in front of the other as I usher you into the living room with a gentle hand on the small of your back. I usually avoid touching you, afraid I wouldn’t be able to ever let go if I did, but your mind seems so far away that I’m unsure you even recognise where you are. I wonder how you got here; if you’ve been walking aimlessly through the streets of London until you eventually happened upon my building. But I don’t ask. Hopefully, you’ll tell me later, and until then, I’ll do whatever I can to make you feel safe and sound.
“Aww,” you purr, furrowing your brow in that cute, concerned way you do when you’re more than a little tipsy. In the dim light, I can almost let myself believe the fondness in your eyes is more than just a figment of my imagination. “You’re so sweet, Harry. What did I ever do to deserve you?” I roll my eyes, hoping you’ll never insist on me actually answering that question. “You sure you don’t want to dance with me?”
Cash changed hands and the elderly couple walked over to their table, leaving Draco to prepare their order in peace. The peace was only superficial, though. Inside, his mind was spinning with all the plausible outcomes of the upcoming evening. He was afraid to hope too much, all but certain he’d read too much into the happenings of the past few days. Yet, he couldn’t deny the spark that had taken root in his core, nor the way it flared hot and bright every time his phone buzzed with another text from the man who once was his enemy but now felt like anything but.
Okay, so, Snape. I’m not saying he wasn’t a death eater; he was. I saw his mark too, and I can very well imagine him bowing before Riddle, but here’s the deal. He didn’t want to kill Dumbledore. In fact, he even begged Dumbledore to not have to go through with it, but Dumbledore insisted. He was already dying, you see, and instead of withering away, he decided to make his death useful to the cause. So, he had Snape kill him that night, hitting two pixies with one stone. One, he relieved you from the burden of having a murder on your conscience, and two, he secured Snape’s position with Riddle. Because nothing shows loyalty better than killing off the leader of the opposing side, right? Yes, it was a set-up. And a quite successful one at that.
Have you always known you were gay?
Hannah’s brows drew close. “What happened, Draco?”
“No. Yes, I—” He really should take the out Harry was offering, if for no other reason, then for his own sanity’s sake. But even as he tried to form the words, to make this torture stop, he found himself incapable of doing so. The truth was, Draco didn’t want this to end… He didn’t want Harry to stop touching him ever again.
“This house…” Harry swallows. “I— I lost my parents in this house, Draco. My entire family. It’s just… It feels ominous to bring another baby here, like inviting fate or something… What if our son—?"
Draco was so close, close enough to touch. Harry could smell his fresh spicy scent wafting through the air and it took all his restraint not to reach out for him. It was futile to hope Draco didn’t catch the quaver in his voice.
“No, I haven’t
“Now, where’s my courageous lion?” Draco gives him a wry smile, but his soft, grey eyes contain nothing but warmth. Warmth drawing Harry in, stealing his breath, weakening his resolve. No matter how much he tries, Harry finds himself unable to look away.
“You know, I think you’re actually pretty wonderful,” Draco blurted before he could stop himself. He felt heat rising on his cheeks, but it was okay. Charlie wasn’t awake to see it anyway. Draco’s heart hammered in his chest, but Charlie’s beeping stayed steady, grounding him. “Do you believe in love at first sight?” he asked softly. “Have you ever fallen in love with someone you’ve never even talked to?”
“Well, yeah, he’s donated before. I think you bought one, actually. The large ruby bowl you have on your coffee table?”
Orion hisses back.
“I don’t like to hide. I’ve hidden enough in my life, and…honestly, I’m not sure I could keep this —
At least the weather is nice.
Malfoy chuckles. “Not quite, but let me ask you this. When you go on a date, do you bring a mental checklist? A list of traits and characteristics you’re looking for in a future partner?”
Dicko Malfoy,
Harry scoffs. “You’re going to take me shopping for clothes?”
Harry met his gaze head-on, his eyes as vibrant as ever. “It’s not good for the baby.”
Gryffindor Tower, Hogwarts
“I know you do, cupcake.”
“Why the fuck did you lie to me?” There it was, the question Draco had been asking himself for years.
Once he was back at school, the dreams became more frequent and, if possible, grew even more intense. Now, each time he woke, the scent of something sweet lingered in his memory. Vanilla, maybe? Or toffee?
He turned back to Molly and met her gaze, begging for her forgiveness. She picked up a handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes, but she seemed to be composed, so Draco pushed forwards, eager to finally get it all out.
Draco’s gaze dropped to the floor, noticing Harry’s bare feet and taking it as a sign to toe off his own shoes. As he did, he gestured at the door behind him. “How did you…?”
The dog turned and barked and ran off towards a family walking down the path out of sight, and Draco grinned. The little moocher. He didn’t have it in him to be annoyed over his lost lunch, though. Even if he hadn’t gotten more than a couple of bites of his sandwich, he felt better, lighter, by the chance encounter.
Draco leans down the inch or two necessary to reach Harry’s mouth, and his lips are warm and pliant as they brush lightly over Harry’s, setting him on fire with nothing but a barely-there touch. A little more pressure, a faint needy whine, and then Draco plunges. His hands curl around Harry’s cheeks, taking Harry’s face between them, his fingers stroking over Harry’s jaw while his wet tongue outlines Harry’s lips and then dips inside.
I still haven’t told anyone else, by the way, and I don’t even have any good arguments for holding off. At this point, I guess it’s mostly about the concern of their well-being since I can’t guarantee they won’t pop a vein or have a heart attack once I break the news. Merlin, I really should have told them from the start, shouldn’t I? So much for Gryffindor courage. Just keeping my fingers crossed Nott and Zabini will be able to keep their mouths shut until I get my thumb out of my arse; I don’t even want to think about what would happen if Ron and Hermione found out from them instead of me.
And wasn’t that the problem? Because as Charlie scanned the room with a pleased smile, greeting each of his family members in turn, his eyes finally landed on Draco. He froze, frowned, and Draco’s heart pounded.
Harry laughed and gently pushed Draco away, stepping over to the table and pulling out a seat. "Best get started then."
Speaking of all your old mates, I can’t help wondering… You’re only 18, and yet you talk as if you already knew who the love of your life is. Do you? If so, that’s pretty unusual, isn’t it? I get that you won’t give me a name, but can you at least tell me if I know her? And you can delude yourself however much you want, but I’m not ‘jealous’. I’m just thinking you shouldn’t give up on your dreams so easily. Come on, Malfoy, you’re almost as stubborn as I am. There must be a loophole somewhere in that ancient contract; there always is. And you’re a smart bloke, you can figure it out. Just let me know if there’s anything I can do to help, okay?
. The words rang in Draco’s ears and panic began to bubble.
“You will not,” Molly interrupted, shooting a scathing look around the room before her eyes landed on her oldest son. “Bill, you’re his brother. He’d be least embarrassed with you.”
“Yeah?” Harry breathes, hoping against hope for an extra-curricular masterclass in the wonders of passionate lip-locking.
“Yeah, I…” Harry swallows, fighting a blush.
Harry busied himself with another sip of tea and Draco made an effort to do the same, careful not to let his hands tremble too much from the adrenaline rushing through his veins.
Orion had told him, and Harry had laughed, embarrassed. He
“Y-yeah…”
“Oh, I don’t know that that’s any of my shop’s doing.” Draco opted for humbleness, a trait he’d soon learnt after joining the Muggle world only for his own limited knowledge to strike him with the force of a wrecking ball to a sandcastle. “Didn’t Flourish & Blotts’ autumnal sale start today?”
— caught a glimpse of Draco’s naked figure in the locker room showers, it was all he could think about whenever the man was in the same room. That perfect porcelain skin stretched taut over powerful muscle and glistening from the water running down his spine towards—
“I know.” A shiver runs down Harry’s spine at Draco’s words, and his eyes fall to soft, rosy lips, lingering for just a moment before they return to Draco’s sad gaze. “May I touch them?”
Harry nods, willing to try anything as long as it means Draco keeps hitting that perfect spot inside him.
No, Potter had lied. And yet, despite the bitter truth of reality, despite all evidence to the contrary, something within Draco refused to let go of the notion that what Potter had said could… could have been the truth. That in some parallel universe, they actually could have been friends. A possible future that Draco had somehow managed to obliterate somewhere along the road.
PPS You know muggles invented mechanical record players over a century ago, right? No magic or electricity needed.
“Yes, Draco,” Harry said, forcing himself to look straight into Draco’s beautiful eyes. He only lasted for a short moment, though hopefully long enough to get his earnestness across, before he had to avert his gaze. The abandoned cups on the coffee table provided a momentary reprieve, and Harry gratefully went over to gather them as he continued. “And you enjoyed it too. Don’t even try to deny it.”
A soft kiss on his nape makes its way through the fog of Harry's mind.
Charlie opened his crystal blue eyes and gave his friendly smile, then passed out.
“Yes. If you must know, I enjoy it quite a lot.”
Now, how to explain the telly… Well, it’s like the wireless but with images, I guess. Like, imagine those moving pictures you see in the papers, but in colour and not on a loop. Instead, they’re transmitted in real-time so you can watch it from your home as it happens. And, yeah, with accompanying sound. Sorry, I’ve never been particularly good at explaining these kinds of technical stuff so I don’t know how much of that made any sense to you. I guess I’d better just show you sometime instead. If you’re not opposed to the idea of watching a muggle sport, that is, because it obviously doesn’t carry quidditch.
“Harry?” Hermione’s sleepy voice comes from the bed next to his, muffled by the drawn curtains.
Received: Awww, but that's not true. I think you like me... deep deep deep deep down...
Merlin. If only Hold on Ah yeah, nothing beats a morning cuppa. (Is’nt house-elves the best?) Okay, M, I’m here for you now. Let’s do this.
were all it would take for Draco to forgive him.
, that’s all.”
Me too, Harry. Me too.
“All right, first things first,” Malfoy declares after tasting his lentil soup with a pleased hum. “
Draco’s eyes stung, but he assured himself it was just the disgusting tea. Simply the tea.
“Very well. Maybe another time.” Draco winked, silently commiserating with the man before turning to the silver-haired lady by his side. “And you, ma’am? How can I serve your tastebuds this fine autumn day?”
Draco turned back to Charlie, then back to Hannah who was nodding voraciously, then back to Charlie.
A minute goes by without any sign of life from inside. You clearly want me to leave you alone, but something tells me that I shouldn’t, that you might need me. So I call out your name a third time, following it up with a soft triple knock.
Orion slithers over to it and lets out a low snakey sigh as he relaxes into the heat. "
When dinner was over and Draco was sure he’d never eat another bite of anything, the family settled into the sitting room and played games. Draco hung back, watching from the doorway as Harry stepped over and nudged his shoulder.
Pansy rolled her eyes.
“I’m trying, you know. I’m trying to make better choices, to make the wizarding world a better place than what it’s been, but I’m really just still me — short-tempered, privileged, sarcastic. I even yelled at Hannah Abbott, for Salazar’s sake. Who the hell yells at a Hufflepuff?”
“You don't think…?”
“Nnngh,” Harry provided eloquently, too far gone for actual words.
But who was Draco to turn that away? Charlie was everything Draco ever thought he’d wanted — fit, funny, carefree, popular — and he had an amazing family for whom Draco would do anything. Did it matter that there were no real feelings involved? Marriages had been built on less. Hell, most of the marriages on Draco’s family tree were built on less.
Draco swallowed. “Right.”
“Woah, what—?”
“Them. I mean
“Uh, no. I’m doing my homework. Something you’re usually nagging me to do.” He raised an eyebrow, waiting on her retort.
Draco did get the message. He groaned and shuffled between Harry’s legs, adjusting his position to allow for him to tease Harry’s waiting hole. And teased he did, the wanker; licking and kissing and flicking his tongue over Harry’s pucker until Harry was a writhing mess underneath him, drawing back every time Harry thrust up against him, soaking his crease with enough saliva for Harry to feel it trickling down his perineum and wetting his balls.
Okay. It actually took Ron almost a week before he finally spilt his guts, and no, you twat, he didn’t want to ask me out on a date. He and his girlfriend are very much in love, and although I’m truly happy for them, I was perfectly fine with remaining clueless about what they get up to behind the bed curtains. You, my depraved friend, are a cruel, cruel wizard for alerting me to the existence of their sex life; I really didn’t need that in my mind. And for the record, I’m rather sure hell will freeze over before Ron admits to the Cannons being anything but the next league champions.
“There already is someone.” His mouth is dry and his voice hoarse. He wishes he could trust his body enough to take a sip from his tea, but he fears his hands would tremble too much if he tried to raise the mug to his lips. “Not that it matters, it’ll never lead to anything, and, well”— he shrugs —”it’s complicated.”
“But, if you want this”— Draco’s tentative voice brings Harry back to their conversation. —”then why hold back?”
The familiar voice, deep and delicious, poured down Draco’s spine like melted chocolate, pooling hot and sweet in his groin.
.” Draco grinned. “You’re the one without pants, after all.”
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” he says in a whisper, and the map comes to life. Pointing his lit wand down towards the map, he traces the lines, tapping the parchment to scroll to the castle grounds. He finds the Owlery and squints in the dim light, looking closer, making out the name he’s followed on the map for years. The name he’s not at all surprised to see.
came a hiss from under the table.
“Because…” Harry swallows, this throat already tightening from the truth in his next words. “Because you can’t possibly want this, Draco. Not the way I do.”
Ginny grinned and answered in a stage whisper, “Shh, don’t tell anyone, but I think she knows about sex. I have it on good authority that she, gasp, has had sex at least six times before!”
PS No, I’m not immune to the death curse. If you must know, I actually did die that night one year ago. I just… had the opportunity to come back. Sometimes I still wonder if I made the right choice.
Harry, though… Harry looked comfortable in this space, competent even, and wasn’t
Harry crossed his arms and stared at the opposite wall, but didn’t say anything.
nocturne. (See, I can’t seem to stop calling it that. Maybe you should take it as a hint to write some lyrics to it one of these days?)
“Yeah. Let’s do it.”
Draco’s well-bred manners were the only thing keeping him from letting his jaw go slack in shock at the admission.
“Hi.” Draco tried but failed to hold back a goofy grin.
Draco glared. “How should I know? I’m not really his fiancé, remember? It’s not like I can just go through his stuff.”
. It’s a bit late for first impressions, isn’t it?”
Whenever something weird happened in my vicinity, I was punished, locked in my cupboard — the one that, at the time, served as my room — and starved, sometimes for days on end. They thought they could force the magic out of me, that they could make me a normal boy they wouldn’t have to hide away or be ashamed of. But as we both know, that’s not how accidental magic works. I couldn’t help it, much less temper it since I didn’t even know what it was. I guess it scared them; this strange, unnatural power that could make inexplicable things happen right before their eyes. (Like the time Aunt Petunia cut off all my hair in a fit of pique for not being able to comb it into submission, just to see it all grown back to normal the following morning.)
“Come on, it’s the least I can do. Consider it my thanks for your help.”
He was getting ready to marry this man when he was pretty damned sure there was at least one reason why he shouldn’t, even if he could hardly bring himself to admit it.
Sent: Friends you can talk to?
“They’re very sensitive. It’s why only my mate can ever touch them.”
“Tomorrow?!” Her shrill voice rang in Draco’s ears.  “What the— Draco, come back here. Who are you marrying?”
“I want you all to know that I will truly cherish the time I spent with you, and even though it was only for a short time, you’ll always be in my heart.” A tear finally fell down his cheek. “I’m really sorry,” he added, and his voice was rough and quiet.
Received: I bet you’ve got plenty. Wanna lend me some?
“As I thought. Nature videos it is.” He crossed over to Smaug’s room and put on the video, smiling as the hushed tones of David Attenborough’s narration filled the room. He took a moment to watch the intro of the video but was soon interrupted by a loud knock at the door.
Harry shakes his head, trying to recall.
Sent: Rawrrrr? What in the name of Merlin is Rawrrr?
All-too-familiar green eyes met his, as if they’d been trained on him this entire time. (And they probably had, judging by the prickle Draco had sensed on his neck while preparing their drinks.) Not that Draco allowed himself to register that nugget of information. He was all too busy averting his gaze and fighting the blush that threatened to overtake his cheeks. It was in moments like this when his pale complexion felt more like a curse than the blessing his father had always insisted it was.
He hung his overcoat in the closet and walked down the hallway, pausing by Smaug’s room to check the fox’s food and water bowls, both good, and turning off the small telly in the corner playing animal videos.
I don’t know why I was so surprised by the colour. Not that I don’t like purple (or is it violet?), it’s just… unexpected, I guess. Maybe it shouldn’t be. I do remember you telling me it’s supposed to match the family crest, after all, not any Hogwarts house crest, and yet, for some reason, I’d still imagined my family’s ancestry ink to be scarlet. Yes, I know — and do stop rolling your eyes, Draco; I don’t want to be the reason they get stuck back there one day — but that’s actually how little I know about my heritage.
I know my desire is futile, that my fantasies can never come true. Because we’re friends now, real friends, and after everything, I should be happy we’ve even come this far.
Just one word, so definite. Anyone else would only see the defiant confidence you present, in your features, in your voice, in your diction. But behind all that, I notice your clenched jaw and the flicker of uncertainty in your eyes, and I realise why you’ve decided to tell me.
And it’s not that I ever thought you
Draco sighed, but nodded and watched as Sirius studiously ignored him on his way back to have a talk with Molly and Arthur. That man was on Draco’s shit list. He’d promised he’d take care of it, and now look what’d happened.
And now I sound like a whimpering arse. I’m sorry. I really don’t have any right to complain because I actually do have someplace else to go if I wanted to. And I probably should, either way. I’m just not particularly looking forward to it.
Percy cuffed Ginny’s head. “Must you be so crude?”
“Now, off to bed with you. You must be exhausted. What do they call it? Aeroplane delay?”
you’ll find a way to make it happen. What other career ideas do you have? You don’t dream of flying pro anymore? You’ve always been a crazy-good seeker, Malfoy, even if you never managed to beat me to the snitch.
Draco dropped his head in his palms. “What am I going to do? This is
But I guess I should at least be grateful that we got him and not Parkinson. Most days, Ron returns from his sessions livid after having argued with her about one thing or another. It’s hard to imagine neither Susan nor Anthony ever getting a word in edgeways when the two of them are at it. Hermione, on the other hand, has got Nott in her group, and they actually seem to get on quite well. So much so that they’ve forced us all to hang out together on several occasions; Hermione, Ron, and I; and Nott, Zabini, and Parkinson. And Bulstrode, for some reason I have yet to determine.
lying, and it would have been smarter to just blurt it all out to Harry, to tell him what had happened and find his way out of it. But when had Draco ever been smart when it came to Harry bloody Potter? As always, it felt like this was something Draco had to win, like some sort of competition, ridiculous as it may sound. It brought back an exhilaration that he’d long thought dormant, in more ways than one.
“I made it.”
“I know. And I do understand if you don’t want to believe me right now, but even so…” Potter drew back, prompting Draco to lift his head from Potter’s shoulder, urging him to meet his warm, green eyes. “Please have faith it will turn out okay. Eventually.”
