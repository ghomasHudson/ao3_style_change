Draco spent most of dinner staring down at his scuffed loafer. Pansy caught him doing it once or twice. She giggled, reached into her bag for something, and told him,
Harry gulped, “Relax Potter, you’re a snake right now. You have our whole house’s protection whether they like it or not.” He nodded but he didn’t find much comfort in the words.
He swore he could see Snape’s lips twitching upward in barely contained humor over Harry’s reply before he ducked over his potion again, “No. Just sitting quietly.”
"I didn't if I remember correctly. Hate to break to you, Malfoy, present you isn’t exactly a treat either," He stuck out his tongue. Draco sniffed. He turned his wide eyes on the Gryffindor, putting a hand on his heart like the words stung him. But his lips twitched into a grin that he barely fought to suppress.
"Of course, Petal. Are you walking this time?" Harry bit his lip. He gave Draco a crooked grin and fluttered his dark eyelashes. The Slytherin let out a rueful chuckle, unable to resist the adorableness of his Gryffindor, "How foolish of me to ask, climb aboard." Harry flashed him a winning grin, scrambling back to his perch. He gave Draco a quick peck on the cheek. As the blond turned back toward the castle, Harry stole one last glance at the lake.
"I see we have different definitions of sitting quietly. But go on Potter, what is it?" He drawled in response. Harry flushed. Heat spread through his cheeks.
“Thank you, Professor,” Harry offered weakly. His gaze followed a Seventh-year girl swinging an open vial toward Umbridge. A red spray shot across her face, making Umbridge sputter. She strained against the gluey substance holding her in place, calling out all sorts of nasty threats against the Slytherins. Until a sudden puff of smoke filled the air surrounding Umbridge. Hacking coughs filled the room, overpowering one last shriek. The smoke cleared and Umbridge was gone. All the coughing was replaced with crows of victory from the members of Slytherin house.
"I know, and you're still all loopy and emotional from the squid ink. Don't try to stand up," He ordered and caught Harry by his forearms before he could push himself off the bed. Harry stared up at him blankly. Draco sighed. He knelt, wrestling the boots off the Gryffindor's feet before swinging Harry back onto the pillows. Harry allowed himself to be tucked beneath the blankets. But he whined softly when Draco tried to leave,
“Go on, but if you don’t show up in the common room at least once a week for cuddles, then I’ll stage a kidnapping.” Harry groaned. He doubted that was a joke. But after a few thanks and goodbyes, he collected his charms essay and left the dungeons. Taking the steps up two at a time, he was panting by the time he reached his dorm. But the Fat Lady welcomed him back to Gryffindor and swung wide for him.
“Shush, or she’ll make me leave.” The Gryffindor’s expression softened. He tugged Draco’s hand away from his mouth, back under control. Harry laid his pounding head down on the pillow beside Draco. A smile fixed on his lips. Rolling his eyes, Draco tucked his arm back around Harry, “I’m fairly certain that you cheated. I wouldn’t be surprised in the slightest if you did that on purpose.” Draco muttered.
The pair moved quickly enough that Harry lost his balance, pitching them both forward to the thick rug beneath them. In a tangle of limbs, Harry let out a throaty chuckle. Rolling over, he turned his face to Draco. His blond hair ruffled from the fall and a pout on his lips.
"Merlin, past me was awful. How did you ever put up with me?" Draco raised his hand to his forehead, feigning a dramatic disdain. His ministrations knocked Harry off balance, sending him sprawling across Draco's lap in a pile of petals. Harry huffed. He sat up and crossed his arms. Jutting up his chin, he played along with Draco's dramatic antics. Like one of their fights from their first few years of school, he ragged on the blond.
The barrier blocked him in. Swallowing, he crossed his arms and turned back to his professor. Snape pinched the bridge of his nose.
"If I didn't know any better, I'd think I was still out of it from the squid ink," Harry mumbled. His gaze fixed on the surface of the lake, tensing at the sight of bubbles brewing beneath the surface of the water.
“Hush up Potter, and let’s get your homework done before Blaise shows up and wants to steal you away from me for an easy chess game.” A flush on his face, Draco busied himself with the textbook. But a faint smile still flickered on the corners of his lips as he pulled Harry even closer.
It would all be over soon. He wouldn’t be a Slytherin anymore. Draco and the others would go back to hating him. He didn’t think that he could go back to hating them. Biting his lip, he watched the scene without the humor of before. Harry rubbed his eyes with the back of his sleeve, trying to hide his glassy eyes from Snape, but the man caught his gaze in the mirror.
Swearing under his breath, Harry threw on his slippers and chased the snitch down the hall. He leaped for it, but it flitted out of reach. Luna wandered out of her own room, her bunny slippers bobbling on the stone floor. She grinned at the sight of the snitch in the air.
“Sorry for scaring you,” Harry whispered. His voice was hoarse from lack of use. Draco’s head snapped toward him. He covered his mouth, trying to smother the laugh building up from inside him.
"Draco and I are going to be preparing an order for Saint Mungo's. You will sit quietly unless instructed otherwise." Harry nodded. He resigned himself to sitting on his hands and pretending he didn't exist like he was back at the Dursleys'. There were worse ways to spend a Sunday, he supposed.
"I've had enough attempts on my life. S'hard not to hold a grudge." Draco snorted. He buried his nose into Harry's hair, taking in the honey scent of the Gryffindor's shampoo.
“Harry you’ve got to hide me from Blaise,” he wheezed out, “I may or may not have hidden his potions essay and lost it. He’s going to kill me.” As Draco spoke, the green and silver colors flooded out of his robes. Harry stared at his boyfriend, sporting Gryffindor crimson and gold. He laughed and tugged Draco through the doorway just in time to see Blaise coming around the corner.
“I think it’s better you don’t worry your pretty little head about it, Potter.” Rolling his eyes, Harry turned away from Draco to hide a growing flush spreading across his cheeks. That was twice the blond had called him pretty. He wondered if Draco meant it. Running his finger through his hair, he turned back to Draco again, “Don’t worry, we won’t kill her unless we have to. These are merely pranks that would make those Weasel twins of yours proud.” Harry glanced again at the group of First-year girls sharpening their spears. He gulped, trying to imagine how those could be involved in a mere prank. But he found that the more he thought about it, the more he trusted Draco and all of his new house to look after him. He had their protection.
Severus shifted to give them some privacy. He rolled his eyes. Like anyone could believe what was going on between those two was purely business.
Harry hopped up and collected an armful of the vials, making a clatter when he brought them to the professor, "Carefully," The man ordered as Harry set them down, “Your mother and I were friends. Your father and his group of hooligan Gryffindor friends, however, were no friends of mine. Your father didn’t like that Lily gave me the time of day, and they took it out on me that she did.”
“If it does, you will attempt to bring Mr. Potter to my private lab. Barring that, you and the other members of this house will do whatever is necessary to extricate her from the premises. There will be no repercussions for actions taken as you will be acting as emissaries for the writ.”
Harry hopped up, glad to have something to do. He slid back between the beaded curtain. The rainbows danced around the room, reflecting off the glazed teacups. Scanning the shelves, he caught sight of a blue set of cups, as bright as the door to the teashop. Raised dots of green colors speckled their surfaces. He stood on his tiptoes and lifted down the cups with their matching saucers. After stacking them carefully, he carried them back into the back room.
Hair falling in his face, Draco grunted. He balanced Harry's prone form against his knee and swung him into a bridal hold. The other boy's head lolled against his chest, tucking beneath Draco's chin. Draco turned toward the common room. He was greeted by silent stares. Rolling his eyes, he settled his gaze on Blaise Zabini who was perched on one of the velvet armchairs.
Bending down, he peered under the bed. His eyes settled on his new boots, gleaming in the morning light that flooded in through the windows. Harry stuffed his feet into the boots, straightened the tongues, and tightened the laces into a set of sloppy knots. He kicked his feet up to examine his work, shoulders curling. It lacked most of Draco's finesse, but he didn't think the squid could yank them off in their current state either.
"But that's just it, Sir," Harry began, "Hermione reads it at least once a term and she'd never heard of it. We checked and it's not mentioned." A silence hung in the room between them. Snape pulled his stirring rod through the thick brew in another turn. He sighed.
"I dunno. The giant squid demanded a sacrifice in the form of my right trainer, apparently." Draco snorted. He took in the ink splattered across Harry's cheeks and shirt, shaking his head. He produced a pressed handkerchief from one of his sleeves and proffered it toward Harry.
Harry slid into a little shop called the Em-Pour-ium through its bright blue door. A bell tinkled over his head to announce his entry. Glancing around, he took in the crystal chandelier that cast flecks of rainbow around the room. The rainbow lights flickered against the tea sets that lined the display shelves. A gentle smell of lavender wafted into Harry's nose. He reached forward to run his finger along the golden rim of one of the teacups, its shiny surface attracting the flecks of rainbow.
Harry winced. He knew from Remus that the Marauders partook in bullying that could make Dudley seem as harmless as a garden slug, with his father as the ringleader. But he didn’t like to think about it, “Yes,” The man muttered over the potion, “not everyone can be a hero, Potter. Even if we’d like them to be.” Harry nodded. He dug his fingers into the base of the stool, knuckles turning white.
Draco strode into the Great Hall, over to the sliver of a table that was set aside for the eighth-year students. He slid into a seat across from his new silent Gryffindor. Raising one of his manicured eyebrows with a silent question, the blond waited for a reply. Harry offered a brief wave to Draco before returning to his pumpkin juice, in response. Nodding, Draco grinned. The game was still on. Potter hadn’t given it up yet. As much as he enjoyed the silence, Draco couldn’t help himself but prod the other boy a little.
Whispers filled the Great Hall over the sight of Harry Potter wearing a flower crown and eating his lunch, all while settled into the embrace of Draco Malfoy. And while what brought them together made perfect sense to Harry and Draco. To the other inhabitants at Hogwarts, they were sure it was as clear as squid ink.
“None?” Draco nodded. He pushed himself to his feet, dragging Harry up and over to one of the couches. The blond sat, pulled Harry down beside him, and arranged Harry’s legs over his lap.
"Get some rest, I think you're a bit barmy from the squid ink right now." Harry frowned, but burrowed deeper into the soft mattress. He squinted at the blond from beneath his drooping eyelids and watched him turn away. But before sleep dragged Harry back down, Draco was at his side again. Warm breath tickled Harry's ear when the Slytherin stooped down beside him, "Why couldn't I summon another pair of shoes for you earlier?" He asked. Draco's gentle tones lulled Harry deeper toward sleep.
“That thing is a pain.” They watched the snitch float around the candles in the hall. Harry nodded. He sipped his pumpkin juice, “What was Lovegood thinking?”
Harry stood behind a thin curtain in the corner of Draco’s tearoom. There might as well have been no curtain. He was sure that Draco could see every outline of his body behind it. Boxes of clothes filled up space around his feet. Dress robes, day robes, trousers, shirts, sweaters, and a modest collection of shoes spilled out of the boxes. He yanked his t-shirt off, replacing it with a green button-down. Harry slid his arms down the sleeves, the material soft against his skin. The old, muggle jeans he replaced with a pair of charcoal trousers.
Harry turned on Draco, "Why didn't we just go in through the common room?" He whined. Draco smirked, eyes twinkling in reply. He pulled him onto the stool beside him at the largest worktable, "What are we even doing?" He asked, more to the potion’s professor than his boyfriend. Snape pinched the bridge of his nose.
“You as well, good day.” A brief nod passed between them before Harry turned on his heel and escaped the room. When the beads stopped shaking, Severus collected his bag from Draco, “It seems he can be taught.” Draco nodded. He smiled fondly back toward the curtains, “I’ll see you Sunday for dinner, correct?” Draco nodded again. Snape strode to the door, the bell tinkling overhead, “And Draco, I wouldn’t mind if you brought a guest.”
Groaning, Harry pressed one of the pillows against his face. It truly wasn't his day. Seconds later, the pillow tugged away from his face. Draco stared coolly down at him on the bed, "I didn't drag you all the way here so you could smother yourself with a pillow, Potter. Do me a favor and try to stay alive for at least a little while." Harry's brows furrowed from beneath his glasses, but he nodded, "Sit forward." The blond ordered. Harry crossed his arms but obeyed again. To his surprise, Draco returned the offending pillow to its place behind Harry. He fluffed it up, "You can lie back now." Harry nodded. He settled back, tugging the blankets around himself, "Madam Pomfrey told me I could stay until you woke up, but you're awake now." Draco tugged on the collar of his sweater, "I should go." He stood up, but a hand latched onto his sleeve before he could turn away. Harry's fingers gripped Draco's arm.
The temperature dropped further until Harry couldn’t stay still anymore. He untangled himself from Draco’s arm and paced back and forth on the pebble beach. Shoving his hands under his armpits, he stared out at the sun as it began its slow slink down beyond the trees. Grinning, Harry scrambled up onto one of the boulders to get a better view, “Careful, you’ve got enough scars without falling and cracking your head open.”
“Harry, why didn’t you just tell us you spent most of the weekend with your secret Slytherin boyfriend?” Hermione teased over the top of her potions text. Harry flushed.
"Hem, hem," Harry's eyes snapped open. His hand jutted out, latching onto the hem of Draco's cloak. Frowning, Draco tried to yank his cloak back, but Harry's grip held firm. The clicking steps were getting closer. They were seconds from rounding the corner and seeing them. Potter quivered. His eyes wide behind the rims of his glasses.
“I’ve already been told to keep anything I see here to myself,” Harry offered, setting his parchment aside, “I won’t say anything.” He lifted one of the cushions off the floor and squeezed it against his chest. The professor nodded, relaxing his gaze.
Bracing himself for what he would find on the other side of the door, Harry left the room and padded to the common area. An arm slung around his shoulders,
Draco Malfoy hadn't returned home. Harry didn't blame him for it. His father was in prison and his home had been used as a headquarters for evil. It wasn't somewhere Harry ever wanted to return to either. So instead, he moped around the castle.
Harry swallowed the growing lump in his throat. He reached into the back pocket of his tatty muggle jeans and pulled out a crumpled newspaper clipping. It clung to his clammy fingers, but he managed to get it unfurled on the glass countertop.
Harry grinned. He watched the little girls with their sharpened sticks, waving them menacingly toward Umbridge. They were empty threats, but effective all the same and very Gryffindor-like, “I’ll intervene shortly. But we’ll let them have their fun first. Remember Potter, not a word about any of this.” He nodded, shoulders drooping.
Harry’s eyes widened. Had Draco just called him Harry? Before he could question it, the portrait guarding the opening turned back to them.
“Let me out,” Harry ordered. Draco’s eyes narrowed. He knew Potter was somewhat of a dunderhead, but surely, he knew how to use the opening. Sliding past the Gryffindor, Draco put his palm on the wall. It slid open beneath his touch. But when Harry threw himself toward the opening he bounced back against an invisible barrier, stumbling back against Draco. Before Draco could react, Harry was back against the invisible barrier and beating against it. Nothing happened. He was stuck inside.
“Thank you.” Draco didn’t speak often anymore, so Harry knew he meant it. He nodded and returned his attention to his own snack. But he kept sneaking glances at the blond. Grinning at the sight of the crumbs on the pale boy’s cheeks. Draco was less of a dignified pureblood since returning to school. He was quieter and bashful in a way that made Harry want to forget their previous rivalry altogether.
Harry snorted at the sight of her struggles, a grin wide enough to ache on his face. A set of footsteps on the stones behind him had him whirling around fast enough to knock himself off the stool. He sprawled on the floor, clutching his head from where it bashed onto the stones. Blinking, he stared up at the dark form of Snape looming over him.
A lone tentacle poked above the water, suction cups popping against each other. Harry jumped. Draco chuckled, he tightened his hold on Harry, and petted his hair, "You're shaking like a leaf, Petal. What happened to my courageous Gryffindor lion?" Harry shrugged, a crimson flush crept over his cheeks. Resisting the urge to bury his face in Draco's sweater, Harry turned away from the squid.
“Would you be able to bring up another tray, so he doesn’t have to eat alone?” The elf nodded, her giant ears bobbling on her head. She smiled at Draco. Her eyes crinkled around the edges.
Gulping, Draco raced around the other side of the boulder to find Harry. The Gryffindor’s form was crumpled on the pebbles. Bile rising in his throat, Draco shook the other boy, “Potter, wake up,” He ordered, but the boy didn’t stir, “Come on Potter, open your eyes so I know you’re alright.” Still no response. The Gryffindor was still. Draco shook him harder, “Tell me you can hear me. Harry say something, anything please?” He pleaded.
Draco’s shaking fingers found Harry’s steady pulse at his neck, thrumming hard enough to set him more at ease. He’d be fine. Harry had come back from worse. A little fall like that was nothing, wasn’t it? Scrambling to his feet, Draco scooped up Harry into his arms and rushed back toward the castle to get help.
“Potter, be a dear and get a box of the jasmine tea and one of those green biscuit tins from the back.” Harry’s shoulders relaxed. He jumped and dodged through the beaded curtains, leaving them clacking behind them.
“Good morning,” He began, reaching for a slice of toast from the tray between them, “sleep well?” Harry took a long sip of his pumpkin juice. The cup clinked down on the tabletop. He shrugged in response to the question, snatching up a rasher of bacon and dropping it on his plate. Harry tapped the edge of the tray as if to offer it to Draco, but the Slytherin declined the bacon, “I slept wonderfully, in case you were wondering. The quiet is really doing wonders for me.” Harry stuck his tongue out at Draco in reply, “Shame this little game will all be over once we go to class, isn’t it?”
Shaking his head, Snape pointed out where Draco still blocked the entrance to the lab with his arms crossed, “I believe you’ll find that a bond once formed is not so quickly broken, Mr. Potter. Regardless of the colors you wear, they consider you one of their own.”
Draco’s gaze followed the shock of black hair as it bobbed and weaved between the other students, wondering what was going on in Potter’s scarred head. A gentle heat spread through the Slytherin’s face, was it a trick of his eye or had Potter been blushing? Whatever was going on in Potter’s head, Draco had no idea.
“Not as much as you will be for smudging my mirror with your grubby hands.” Harry pulled his hands back. He flushed at the throaty laugh echoing from the man behind him. When Snape had recovered, he sighed and wiped a tear out of the corner of his eyes, “No, there will be no repercussions for their actions. The Writ of House Protection allows them to act as they see fit to protect you. And for whatever reason, they’ve chosen to respond to the threat like a bunch of Gryffindors.”
“Remember the ad I placed in the Prophet a few weeks ago?” Snape nodded, “Harry’s my first client. He’s learning to be a lord.” Severus hummed, his thin lips twitching into something that resembled a smile.
"I need you to teach me how to be a lord," Draco smirked. The skin around the blond's blue eyes crinkled. He covered his mouth with one of his manicured hands to muffle the chuckles that escaped out of his thin lips. Harry frowned. He dug his fingernails into his palms to stop himself from lashing out, "I'm serious."
Draco stroked his hair, holding him close until he felt Harry loll in his arms. Glancing down, he found him dead asleep in his lap. He tucked a loose strand of hair out of the other boy’s face and slipped his glasses off of him before returning his gaze to his uncle.
Harry thanked him without bringing his head up, not expecting any sort of reply. The low clatter of working had settled on the room again between the grinding and Snape’s brew. Footsteps in the distance jarred Harry from his focus. Draco making his way back down the set of narrow steps, “Mr. Potter, much like my mirror and what you see when you enter our common room-” Harry cut off the sentence.
Luna washed away her giggles in more hot chocolate. She took the tray from Harry and wandered over to the elves with it. They didn't like the students near their ovens. So, they started to clean their mess before the elves shooed them away from that as well. Cocoa mugs in hand, they wandered out of the kitchen. Luna skipped through the empty halls and Harry trailed behind her, "Back to the common room?" He asked. Luna nodded. They had plenty of time before the cookies were ready and cool, knowing the elves they would just end up delivering the cookies to them. Harry strode to the tapestry with the unicorn on it, pulling it aside to reveal the entrance to the eighth-year dorms. He tapped his wand three times on the brass knocker and muttered, "Four houses, One home". The door sprung open on its squeaky hinges.
Harry pushed himself up on the countertop, legs swinging back and forth while Draco instructed him on how to properly serve tea to others. Draco’s s instructions stopped when the bell tinkled overhead. Harry slid off the counter. His mouth fell open at the sight of Severus Snape standing in the doorway. Swallowing, Harry resisted the urge to slip behind Draco. But he’d already been seen.
“But-” Before Harry could argue any further, Draco shoved him in and let the tapestry go. Harry was plunged into darkness. He swallowed, edging along the wall until the passage opened wider. Another curtain draped across the passageway. Harry swept the curtain aside, blinking in the low lighting of Snape’s lab. He glanced around for his professor, but the lab was empty save a cauldron simmering on one of the worktables.
A focused quiet settled on the group, only to be aroused by the sound of the professor's floo crackling to life. He pinched the bridge of his nose again, muttering as he swept across the room. The low rumbles of his voice broke the steady flow of work. Draco put his knife down, hovering on the edge of his stool. He strained his ears to listen. One of his hands jutted out to catch Harry's wrist and stop his scrubbing for a moment. Rolling his eyes, Harry set the brush down. He leaned on his elbows and stretched his arms from having stooped over the cauldrons. Four glistening pots sat on the table in front of Harry. Only a few more remained in the dirty stack.
“Lords greet people properly, Potter. Otherwise, you’re going to offend someone. Do it right.” The back of his head stung, but he turned back to the potion’s professor, standing up straight.
“Why is it that you’re always on the floor, Mr. Potter? Get up.” Harry scrambled back to his feet and straightened his robes before turning back to the professor, “I see you found my mirror.” Nodding, Harry swallowed. Draco hadn’t said not to touch anything and he hadn’t tried to rifle through things that weren’t in plain sight, but there hadn’t been much time for directions, “Please don’t mention it to Draco or the others. I’d like to keep them wondering how I know the goings-on of their common room.” Harry’s eyes went wide behind his glasses, but he nodded.
"We should give him some cookies when we're finished," Harry said, scooping blobs of dough onto the tray.
Draco snorted, "And why in Merlin's name would I ever ask for that, Potter?" Harry shrugged, his green eyes dancing all the same. Nodding to Draco and the others, he strode out of the common room without a word. The blond pinched the bridge of his nose. Somehow without the war going on, Potter had become more disruptive and baffling.
Draco wrinkled his nose. He leaned over to see the advertisement he's put in the Prophet weeks ago for the side business he'd started out of his tea shop. A tutoring service aimed primarily for children who were waiting for their Hogwarts acceptances. He smirked, "And what exactly do you need a tutor for Potter?" Blushing, Harry twirled his lord rings around on his fingers. He'd become Lord Potter and Lord Black when he came of age, but it didn't mean he was ready for all the responsibilities that came along with it.
Harry laid on his stomach on the castle lawn, his fingers tangling between blades of grass. Draco sat beside him, his back against a sun-warmed boulder. The blond wound a crown of daisies together in his slender fingers, tongue protruding from his lips with the effort. He flicked his wand, sending the finished crown floating onto Harry's head. Petals tangled in his dark hair. Grinning, Draco admired his work.
Snape snapped back to focus, containing the brew before it splattered the room and the two of them as well.
“If he wasn’t a potion’s master, he’d be a concert pianist. He’s incredible, I bet if you wheedle him as you did for the recipe he’ll agree.”
Sighing, Snape summoned a jar and dropped the worm inside. After punching in a few air holes, he sealed the jar tightly and tucked it away in the folds of his robes.
Draco caught sight of Harry's bawled fists and gritted teeth. Out of the corner of his eye, he caught sight of the crystal chandelier overhead wavering in the charged air. Sighing, he schooled his humor and wiped a fleck of moisture out of the corner of his eyes.
“I dunno, all of it, I guess. My parents weren’t around to tell me all the etiquette and tradition stuff that comes with lordships. Now I have two of them.” He showed Draco the rings on his finger. Draco nodded.
“Question,” Draco began, nabbing around his mouth with a napkin, “do you actually do your homework? Or does Granger do it for you?” Harry shook his head.
He folded up the note and cast a floating charm to send it over to Draco. The blond caught the paper and unfolded it quickly. He deciphered the scrawl, a flush growing across his cheeks. Rolling his eyes, Draco stood up and strode through the hall to stand in front of the Gryffindor table. Ignoring the glares from Ron and Hermione, he pressed his hands down onto the table,
It was the truth. Sleep hadn’t come easy to Draco after the war. Even with Voldemort gone, the Death Eaters dismantled, and being safe behind the wards of Hogwarts the Slytherin rarely felt safe. Random noises in the common room were far from helpful. Standing up, Draco padded over to one of the tables and extracted a loose piece of parchment out of a pile of someone’s abandoned homework. He snatched up a quill and inkpot, bringing the looted supplies back over to the Gryffindor, “Your turn.”
His fingers gripped the underside of the stone bench, "Relax Potter, I'm not going to bite. We're not kids anymore." Draco dropped to the bench beside him, his long legs tucked beneath him on the stone, "Did the squid crack you in the head or something?" Harry shook his head, feeling somewhat hazy, "You didn't get any of that squid ink in your mouth, did you?" Harry shrugged, he opened his mouth and Draco caught sight of a dark film coating the surfaces of the other boy's teeth, "Of course you did. Potter that's toxic!" Harry lolled against the back of the bench. Eyes heavy.
Shivering, Harry sat down on a stool and waited. A dull clamor from the common room carried to his ears from down the tunnel. Then he heard a shriek. Harry jumped up. He couldn’t sit still any longer. Pacing through the lab, Harry caught sight of a mirror that seemed oddly out of place. It rippled like water when he took a step closer. Narrowing his eyes, Harry leaned forward and tapped the glass.
“I is bringing lunching for Mr. Harry Potter,” She squeaked. Harry stood up and padded over to the elf. He took the tray, mumbling thanks to the elf. Draco scrambled up off of Blaise’s lap before the elf could disappear and bent down in front of her.
"Good to see you both awake and in high spirits, though I only recall having one patient last night." Draco offered a sheepish smile to Madam Pomfrey, straightening up his sweater.
Draco nodded, "Yes, I brought you something. But you can't have it until your potions are gone." He passed the glass to Harry and helped him steady it until every sip of the mixture passed his lip. Draco lifted the glass away from the Gryffindor's mouth, letting it clink against the table tray, "There you go." Draco's cool fingers brushed against Harry's forehead. Leaning into the touch, Harry's gaze swiveled from Draco's eyes to the brown paper, his green eyes dancing.
“The last place,” Harry repeated, “once she looks everywhere else, she is going to look here and find me.” Draco scowled. He dropped Harry’s hands in favor of wrapping his arms around Harry fully. He listened to the sharp intake of the other boy’s breath at occurred with the unexpected embrace. Harry shuddered but collapsed into Draco’s arms.
"Ah, I see you've brought Mr. Potter with you. What a welcome surprise," The man drawled without his usual bite. He rolled his eyes and opened his arms for Draco's inevitable hug. Draco grinned tucking himself into the folds of Snape's black robes. He let out a happy sigh, only relinquishing his hold when the man ordered, "All right off now Dragon, I think I've indulged you more than enough for the moment. There's work to be done." Guiding them into his quarters and into the private lab off the common room.
“Did you really learn wandless, nonverbal casting just to win the bet?” Draco asked. He leaned against a mossy boulder with Potter beside him. Harry nodded. A grin stretched across his cheeks, “You’re something else, Potter.” The Gryffindor nodded again. Shivering without his jacket in the fading light, Harry nestled against Draco’s side. The blond rolled his eyes, but draped his arm around the Gryffindor, “For the record, I do not cuddle.”
Not hard, Harry noted. None of the holds were particularly rough, just enough to keep him cooperative. Harry didn’t fight as the hand came to rest back over his mouth. He leaned back into the other’s arms hold, feeling them shift forward to support his weight. Nimble hands set him back on his feet, “Knock it off,” The voice ordered.
"Hello Draco, is that any good?" She asked. Draco blinked. He nodded stiffly, glancing down the hallway to the dorms to make an escape. But Luna dropped down on the couch next to him. She pulled a little notepad out of her pocket and a squashed quill from behind her ear. She hummed the same carol Harry had been humming in the kitchen. Draco stared at Luna for a moment, but she was lost in her own world. He looked up at Harry, head cocking to the side. Harry shrugged back and dropped to one of the armchairs. He summoned his worn copy of Quidditch Through the Ages, kicking his legs over the arm of the chair.
“Don’t worry, if anyone else asks, I’ll say you won.” He once again acted out locking his lips and throwing away the key. Draco rolled his eyes. He tucked the blankets around them and ran his fingers through Harry’s wild hair as gingerly as he could to avoid the fresh cuts. Before he could change his mind, he ducked forward and pressed a soft kiss on the Gryffindor. Harry flushed, his dark eyelashes fluttering in surprise. But he returned the embrace, so their lips were sealed.
"I love them. You didn't have to-" Harry began, but Draco held up a hand to cut him off. The blond traced a finger along Harry's cheekbone, catching a wayward tear that threatened to drip down his cheek.
“I think it is likely he would have regardless of the Writ. Your father was a bully, not a monster.” Harry nodded at the matter of fact answer. He hoped that was the case, “Bring me the diced mandrake root Draco had been working on.” The professor’s request roused Harry from his thoughts, sending him scampering back across the room for the neat pile of roots.
“One diagnostic charm and the jig is up, Potter.” Draco reminded him, “It’s been a week. You’ve made your point and were as impressively stubborn as always. Talk if you want, I won’t hold it against you.”
Draco set the scissors down. He massaged Harry’s scalp again, gently scratching the shortened hair on the sides of Harry’s head. He’d left the top long, just shaped and neatened it up. Dipping into a small cannister, he coated his fingers in a lightly scented cream before running them through Harry’s hair. Harry hummed. He curled into Draco’s hands, “Almost done.” He muttered, fluffing up the front of Harry’s hair into a gentle swoop. Wiping his hands on the sheet, he tugged it away from Harry’s neck in the same motion, “There, that wasn’t so bad was it?” Harry shrugged. He hadn’t seen it yet to know. One of his hands swept to the table beside him to find his glasses.
"Why's that?" Draco caught Harry's chin and tugged it away from the lake, back toward him, "That's right, just look at me. Much nicer view than a slimy cephalopod, isn't?" Harry nodded. The crown tipped on his head until Draco righted it. Harry bit his lip. He balanced his chin on his knee
Draco sighed. He dropped onto his favorite overstuffed armchair, lifting a tasseled pillow to his lap. Picking absently at the threads, he launched into his account of what transpired between them the night before. He glazed overseeing Harry’s wrist. The boy clearly didn’t want to talk about that, “So, I’m stuck in here as a Slytherin until Umbridge is gone?” Harry asked. He tugged on his shirt collar, it suddenly felt far to tight around his neck.
“Relax, just follow my lead. Like in all our other lessons.” Severus began a gentle waltz. Draco muttered the counts in Harry’s ear, steering him around in time to the music. Harry stumbled along with Draco. The last time he danced was the yule ball in his fourth year. He was abysmal then and hadn’t gotten any better since, “Look at me, not your feet.” Draco’s voice cut through his musings. Harry dragged his eyes up from his boots. He gripped Draco’s hand tighter, “Better.”
"It suits you," He reached forward to tuck a stray hair back to its place behind Harry's ear. Harry's ears burned a deep Gryffindor crimson. He ducked his head, running his fingers between blades of grass again. Pushing himself up, he leaned on the boulder next to Draco. Their shoulders brushed against each other. Draco snorted. Nudging Harry's shoulder, he pointed to the lake in the distance. Tentacles poked above the surface of the water and bobbed before diving back beneath the surface. Harry shivered. He resisted the urge to bury his face in his arms. Draco glanced down at Harry's changed posture, wrapping his arm around the other boy's sloping shoulders, "Hey now, don't worry. I won't let the big bad squid get you."
If it had been anyone else staring at me for this long I would have felt incredibly uncomfortable, probably would have just left the room. However, there's something about this incredibly handsome mans eyes on me that makes me feel privileged to have his eyes on me which is mortifying of myself to even think or enjoy.
I walk into his room and shut the door behind me looking over the floor to see smashed glass everywhere. I walk into the bathroom with him as the door is already wide open. He runs his hand under the tap water washing away the blood.
''Wait'' he says trying to sound as clear as possible through his sleepy voice and I turn back around to look at him ''Come in-''
He brings his one hand back down and presses his cock back into me beginning to fuck me up the wall this time. The stabbing feeling in my stomach only making me scream at the incredible feeling he gives me.
My mind brought memories of simpler times, when they were alive. Of course it wasn't simple in the way of money or possessions, but it was simple in the way that we knew, as a family, that love would be all we needed to be safe and happy.
''Well we should get in there then'' Draco said in a hurry before turning around and walking into the hallway where Astoria followed him only to bump into Juliet grabbing onto her waist to make sure she didn't fall.
Lucius had never said a word to me or any of his other staff unless he needed something in the hour he would be seen by our eyes. So all in all, it was good.
''You see since the whole Elves rights came into play, we've been without any help in the home for a while now. As long as you can do all those things, then I don't see why you couldn't be fit to work here'' she smiled once again.
''Oh yeah, I think I remember hearing about them in school. My friend used to sometimes hang out with them'' I smile realising that Theo did used to hang around with them from time to time, and also Draco.
''What's this?'' he asks brushing his fingers over the bite Draco had left on my neck again only yesterday making me wince.
''Of course. That's very kind of madame'' I smile kindly as she looks back at Draco who rolls his eyes then starts to walk out the library to go down the stairs before turning around to look at me while his mother's back is to him and sucking his two fingers that I assume still had my orgasm on with a small smirk while his other hand rests in his pocket.
He lets out a breathily chuckle then leaning against the wall in the hallway as I hang my jacket up.
Little would she know that the thought of kissing her scares me to death, but that doesn't at all mean I don't want to. I'm dying to. I'm dying to taste those lips on mine, but I fear if I do, I'll never get enough.
He smiles ''I bit you pretty deep'' he almost whispers as he brings his eyes up to mine, his finger stroking over the hicky he had left a week ago still on my neck.
''Thank you, that's really kind of you'' I smile before walking towards the stares to make my way up to Draco's room.
''I will not be spoken to like that by an ignorant little prick'' she snapped making him chuckle darkly at her before snapping his neck slowly side to side as if he was tense and needed to calm himself down.
''Bitch'' he hisses before kicking his chair back with his foot and walking upstairs leaving me stunned.
''No more cramp then?'' I smirk and he looks at me with a smile that is too wide to hide ''Ha, got that smile I wanted''
''See you later dear'' She smiles towards me and I give her a smile back before she rushes out the front door.
''It's funny'' he says and I slap my hands on my sides in annoyance ''In a good way'' he rolls his eyes then standing up straight in front of me ''Wanna go for a walk?''
''I said I'm fine'' I snap at her through my embarrassment making her widen her eyes at me before relaxing her features again.
I almost scream at the force his fingers fuck me at but he clasps his other hand around my mouth before I can.
''If you want to go for a walk?'' he sneers ''I don't know Carter, maybe it's to ask you, if you want to go for a walk. There's no deep meaning behind it and there's certainly nothing to convey''
''Are you trying to kiss me Carter?'' I smirk through a whisper and she rolls her eyes at me then sucking on her bottom lip.
''Has he been talking to you?'' she asks with eyes full of hope and a happy smile which I don't think I've actually seen her perform before now.
''Is there a reason you're suddenly talking to me again, even if it is to be a dick'' I say ''No different than usual though I suppose''
''Death Eaters don't really exist anymore though since the war. So no harm? I'm guessing'' she said as if she wasn't actually too sure, but all she could think about was the pay of this job and the good it could possibly do for beginning a new future of some kind and the chance to live in a manor out of all the places to live, surely it would be perfect.
I look down at his hands which are placed on the back of the chair wood still clenched around it and I reach my hand to pick up one of his which he flinches at making me look at him.
I button up my shirt and trousers and walk back over to her not being able to resist the urge to look back over her body, feeling myself get hard again.
''Do I need a reason?'' he whispers thrusting his fingers inside of me with quicker pace as my back arches slightly ''Do I need a reason when I make you feel this good, hm?''
I twist her back around and grab under her ass to pick her up, her legs wrapping around me and hands rested on my shoulders as I press her against the wall and shove my cock back into her, fucking her up the tiles furiously.
He looks back down at me licking his lips with a smile before pulling me up by my chin to sit up and look at him coming very close to my face, close enough that I could easily press my lips on his if I dared to.
''Do I have any redeeming qualities?'' I ask looking back into her eyes to which she looks around the room with a pout as if she's thinking hard.
''I admire that dress you're wearing'' he suddenly says catching me off guard and making me turn to him again ''and the tear in the back of it'' he says with a smile.
I couldn't help but think he was looking at every silver line and every imperfection my body held as I sucked in a shaky breath, wanting to wrap my arms around my body and cover myself back up.
''And why aren't you happy?'' he says turning off the tap and reaching for the towel but I grab it before he does and place it over his hand for him, dabbing at the blood which surprisingly, he allows me to do.
''You and Elara can't support me as well as yourselves'' she mumbled taking a deep breath ''I'm going to have to either get some income for us all, or move out-''
''There is a bookshelf in the corner there with a range of authors if that takes your liking, but we do have a library just down the hall'' she says walking through the room to guide me through ''You have your own ensuite through this door here'' she points towards the closed door ''I thought it would be best to give you your privacy. And of course, there is a desk with writing equipment if you wish to use it and-'' she looks around the room checking to see if there is anything else she should inform me on ''I believe that is all. My room is just down the hall and Draco's is next-door to you on the left'' she says and I nod at her,
''You so want to kiss me right now'' I say with a smirk looking at her hair flowing between my fingertips.
''Good little girl'' he whispers close to my lips as he picks up the pace with his hand again ''Such a pretty little fucking slut'' he hisses watching how my chest rises and falls as he pleasures me then looking back into my eyes before pressing two fingers into me and pounding me with them mercilessly.
''Carter'' he says tiredly closing his eyes with a sigh ''Just come in and clean my damn room will you'' he scrunches his nose up with a yawn.
''Incredibly'' he smirks with a scrunched nose and I frown at him ''Only joking, calm down love'' he teases making me roll my eyes as I look back down at his hand.
''Bitch'' Elara came into Juliet's bedroom with a stumble and a great smile since she'd just only came back home from drinking the whole night, again.
''You want to do something for me?'' he whispers looking at me still with that harsh look on his face, as if his blood is burning.
His hand then lifts to push a piece of hair behind my ear, my eyes flickering close at the feeling before snapping them back open again to look at him.
''Better'' he murmurs looking up at me and it's like our eyes are stuck on each others, that is before Astoria nudges him in the side and his eyes fly towards her with a heavy sigh.
I let out a short breathily chuckle ''Likewise darling'' I whisper placing my hand on her waist gently.
I grab each side of the seat of my chair clenching my hands around the wood to make sure I don't scream when he begins thrusting his fingers in and out of me violently under the table.
A small moan came out of her mouth as he nibbled on the skin of the soft spot on her neck, causing her other hand to flow up to the back of his hair and clasp it tightly in her fist.
Her hand lifted, placing onto his shoulder and feeling down his black shirt which had been rolled up his arm a little as his fingers got closer to her heat.
I don't understand what I'm even doing or why I'm doing it, but I would really love to just feel his skin right now on mine.
''Join you? You want me join you in the shower?'' I ask quietly and she nods coming back closer to my face and brushing her nose against mine.
''Oh shush'' she smiled getting on her tip toes to press a kiss onto his cheek and begin to walk out the kitchen ''Now stop distracting me Theodore'' she said playfully as she walked back into her bedroom to pick up the newspaper which had been pushed onto the floor by Elara who still slept heavily on her bed.
He wraps his hand around my neck pressing me down into the pillow as he leans up and fucks me mercilessly with eager thrusts, pounding me so hard the bed began to shake with his movements.
Ever since that night I had her, that one night with her skin on mine and her body ready for me to take, I've wanted it again. I just want to touch her over and over again. I didn't know you could get so addicted to something after one hit.
When we arrive upstairs she opens the door to a beautiful, large bedroom with a four poster bed. Everything was still extremely dark and dreary, even the sheets on the bed were a dark, rich purple colour. However, it was still a nice room and very pleasing to the eye.
''I don't care'' he mutters walking over to a drinks tray a couple of steps away from him and pouring himself a drink.
''Wow, thanks I didn't know that. I guess I should I stop then'' he says sarcastically then taking another puff of it and blowing it right into my face which I sneer at him for.
''It would be a terrible shame if you went to bed feeling tense'' he whispers keeping his eyes in front of him as if he's looking at the paintings along the wall, edging his hand up my skirt again and brushing my panties to the side.
I'm beginning to feel that being a maid may possibly not be for me since my back is killing from standing straight for so long without being able to sit down and my feel are beginning to ache from the flat shoes I wear against the stone floor. It was also cold, very cold in this house and my dress only did so much at warming me.
I set the dinner table and head back to the kitchens to help the chefs take the food out to the Malfoy's. One thing that scared me the most about 5pm was the fact that Lucius would be here before heading back out again for whatever work he does.
''If-if you need something?'' I answer, not really knowing what else to say in this moment, his fingers digging into my skin as he strengthens his hold on my chin keeping my eyes in line with his.
He picks up his hand and scratches his head before slowly lowering it back down hesitantly. He looks at me again then reaching his hand out to place into mine gently. His hand lifts a touch as soon as he touches my palm with one of his fingertips, but it soon rests all the way into mine. He's tense, but he still allows himself to give into me.
He presses an extra finger into my pussy thrusting it in and out in moderate pace as his thumb flicks at my clit.
I don't want to sabotage the near kiss, but I feel I have to when my chest begins to clench at the thought.
''Awah I'm sorry'' I pout stroking her cheek with my hand before lowering them to her waist and spinning her around to press her chest against the tilts and pull her hair back ''Naughty girls don't get kisses, those are only for good little girls'' I smirk behind her.
''Just, well, a friend'' I shake my head not knowing what else to say and he huffs at me and looks back down into his lap ''Do you have any friends?'' I ask kindly to him.
''You keep interrupting still'' he simply says making me sigh deeply before we reach the door and he turns to look back at me with a smile threatening to laugh.
''But when it's being offered to you, right in front of you, why not just take it?'' she says and I pick my head up to look at her with a small smile.
''I'm not getting fucking married'' he says rather calmly with a sigh for the way he obviously feels at my idiot assumption.
''It's ok'' I assure her and she smiles back at me before going to walk away to near the living room before she stands still and slowly turns back around to look at me again.
''Stop touching you? Are you sure of that decision?'' he smirks, placing his elbow on the table and leaning over to look at the front of my face a little closer making me tilt my head away from him ''I don't think you're sure of that, are you?''
I suddenly hear a cough from behind me making me jump and turn around to see Draco standing against the closed office door with crossed arms. One of his legs crossed over the other as he stands there smirking back at me.
''You'll give me a massage?'' I squint at him and he nods seriously with no sign of humour on his face.
I lay her down on her bed which thankfully already have the covers lifted for her to get underneath it and I pull the covers over her.
She had come from a not so wealthy family, one of which she had to provide for to help with the house costs, clothing and food as her mother and fathers income was simply not enough. Her luck got worse down the line when her parents died in a car crash, such horrible muggle contraptions she thought to herself.
''Fuck you'' she snaps and I yank her hair back again and slap her ass roughly with my hand making her squeal.
''I won't hurt you'' I say and he looks back at me with knitted brows ''You said you had cramp, unless you were lying?'' I smirk up at him trying to lighten the mood again.
''Then why? What's so bad about me?'' I let out an awkward chuckle trying to lighten the mood, but inside my stomach feels sick at myself.
Theo took me to the manor, helping me with my bags as we walked up to the front door to see that Narcissa had opened it before we even knocked, her eyes instantly setting on Theo's.
I let my hair down out of the clip that was holding it up due to the strain it had been pulling on my hair throughout the day.
It had only been an hour since she sent off her application for the job by owl and she had already gotten a letter back. Theo said it's probably because no one wants the position since it was the Malfoys which only made it more the better for Juliet. This only meant she had more chance of getting the job.
''You are dishing the compliment out today'' I say sarcastically. She shrugs down at me sucking on her bottom lip which I really hope she'd stop doing considering how hard I am right now.
''Well, some thin black stockings'' I smirk stroking my fingers in a circle against the side of my thigh.
She walked towards him placing her hand on his chest which he turned his head to the side at with a disgusted face.
''Fuck sake'' he breathes out almost in relief ''Trying to give me a heart attack now?'' he says rather seriously making me look at him in confusion.
''I fucking love your tits'' he bites his lip as he chases his high, fucking me more and more vigorously into his silk sheets.
''Take your clothes off'' he asserts me still holding my chin and looking into my eyes as if he's awaiting a response from me.
She sat there on her bed flicking through the job vacancy segment of the Daily Prophet, underlining each job she thought suitable to look more into with the point of her quill until her hand slipped due to the sudden crash of someone on the bed beside her making her look up to her dark-haired friend with a tired expression.
''Ok'' I answer her and she smiles at me with a shaky breath ''I'll go check on him'' I smile and she sighs in relief.
Elara jumps up and pulls me into a tight hug ''We have to go out again sometime'' she says hugging me tighter then pulling away and placing her hands on my cheeks ''I've missed my girl'' she smiles and I chuckle at her.
''Well, can I touch you, Juliet?'' he said through a husky voice, beginning to actually turn her on which she hated herself for as his hand glided down her arm softly.
''And? I'm sure you can find something more interesting to bury your head in posh boy'' I say and he lets out a breathily laugh shaking his head with a smile ''What now?'' I mutter and he looks back at me.
''How would you locking me outside be any fun?'' I ask while we walk across the path through the gardens full of fresh flowers and freshly mown grass.
I rush out to him and reach him halfway to the steps where he continues walking and I walk beside him.
''I need to owl them'' she moaned making him look at her with a mocking pout ''Who doesn't have a phone these days?''
''I-fuck-I love seeing you like this'' he moaned placing his other hand on her cheek with his forehead pressed against hers as he pounded into her.
He's usually always out at around the time that I clean his room but I always knock for obvious reasons.
''You're quite funny'' he says and I tilt my head to look at him as we walk up the stairs to notice his smirk plastered on his face again.
''Hello there my angel'' he says playfully back making me chuckle and begin walking down the hall to somewhere a little quieter, so I decide to walk into an office that seems quiet and unused, shutting the door gently behind me.
''Fuck'' he breathes out, pushing my dress up behind so he can touch my bare ass which I only wear a thong which he smiles at ''This dress on you'' he shakes his head with a small groan ''Anyone else would look fucking ridiculous in it, but look at you'' he smirks slapping my ass harshly gritting his teeth as he watches me let out a squeal and bite my lip.
''So so bloody tired'' Elara sighed closing her eyes as Juliet and Theo looked at each other with annoyed faces at the girl now laying on her lap.
He then takes his hand away from me and pushes his chair out making me look up at him in confusion before he kneels down with a smirk.
She makes me forget every bad thing going on in my life. The arranged marriage and the whole death eater shit that still haunts me on the daily.
''Not like that darling'' he simpered causing her chest to rise against his, her eyes flickering closed as his hand gravitated down the side of her body to her thigh ''Like this'' he whispered brushing his fingers towards her inner thigh slowly which she just allowed to happen with no fighting back.
My cheeks begin to feel flushed and drained with water and it's only now I realise it's not the shower dripping onto my skin, but the salty tears which sting the corner of my eye as they flow down my face.
Elara's eyes were closed with a slight snore coming from her as Juliet stood up looking down at Theo. He soon rose up off the bed as she began to walk out the bedroom, which he followed after her, following her all the way to the kitchen as she leant her back against the kitchen counter staring back at him.
''Do friends fuck?'' he asks rather calmly considering the way he clenches his hands behind him on the desk right now.
''So you'll do it for free?'' He smiles with a squint to his eyes and I shake my head at him with a tut.
''You know mother, I'm really fucking sick of having you tell me what you believe is best for me'' he hissed at her from across the table as she stood her ground, neither of them noticing that I was there still.
She shuffles forward on her knees and wraps her lips around my tip lowering herself on my cock inch my inch making me tilt my head back with a moan.
''What does my little slut want to do then?'' I whisper with a smirk ''You gonna suck my cock princess?''
He brings his teeth back to my neck and bites hard down as he fucks me, causing me to hiss at the pain as a trickle of blood drips down my neck. He licks up the blood back up to the bite mark he'd created and sucks on it more, tasting the metallic, crimson liquid.
Harry feels his lips twitched a little. If he didn’t tough better, he would think he was becoming soft. This wasn’t something he was used to dealing with – being around kids wasn’t his strong, mind you.
As far as he could remember, he had always hated this house. It was like walking inside a ghost. Everything was too quiet, too cold—lifeless. It was supposed to be a proud house, one that held within her a long line of power and knowledge, but for him, all this silence, this loneliness—all this white was making him want to hit his head against the wall to add some colours on it.
Never less, he didn’t come here often. And each time he set a foot here, he couldn’t help but feel guilty, like he had abandoned her.
“Evening,” he said. His eyes flicked toward Pansy and he tilted his head. “Parkinson, I presume?” He took out his hand. “Nice to meet you.”
Harry bits his lip, and turns his finger up. Malfoy—Draco now, right?—arches and grips his shoulder.
The man bites and suck his skin, ravishes him in a way that made him see stars. His lower abdomen contracts, and just like that, he feels his orgasm coming. If he was in his rational mind, he’ll be embarrassed at how soon he was already close, but with the fog clouding his thoughts and the fire that was burning inside him, he could just whimper and curls his toes with how overwhelmed he was.
He didn’t waste time. With one motion, he removes his clothes. His dick was painfully hard against his boxer, and he sighs when he finally free it.
“You’re so sensible” he breath, and then lean, and then take it in his mouth. Malfoy’s back arch, his hand in his hair, and Harry sucks and twists his tongue over it and bite.
He groans and arches and bites his lips. He closes his eyes and throws his head back and try to make the world disappear.
They step back in a corner, just enough to have some privacy. Harry could still see the boy, leaning against a window with a grim face.
He didn’t know how that happened. One moment he was daydreaming, the other Harry Potter was standing next to his door, looking at him with a frown. Draco distantly registers the oddity of this—what was he doing here? —but like a fly, the thought vanished, replaced by a pleasant buzz inside his veins.
Did he have someone he like? There was no information about this on the news—nothing that seemed to be even close to that. But, at the same time, the man was secretive about his life—maybe he did have someone but was secretive about it. How, he didn’t know, but with Lucius as a father, this kind of thing wasn’t that surprising.
Lucius Malfoy was standing at the doorstep, his tall frame cool and noble as he eyed him carefully, his hand landing on a cane with a silver snake’s head at the end. Like the picture, the man was charismatic; all high chin and straight posture; eyes cold and face still like a frame. His blond hair, almost white it seemed, were gathered in a ponytail at the base of his neck. His long, dark robe was cut to measure, marrying his imposing figure and highlighting his beauty.
Stopping at the hall, he looks up at the stairs. He couldn’t hear anything coming from the boy’s room, so Harry supposes he was sleeping. Or maybe the house was soundproof. Before he could stop himself, he made his move up the first floor. He climbs the steps slowly and walks along the dark hallway. His feet stop in front of the black door, and he looked over the name that was graved in the rich wood, in silver.
“Why is he wearing a schoolgirl uniform?” Harry asks for the umpteenth time, tapping his foot and scolding his arm. He was irritated, for some reason, and deeply perturbed even if he rather dies than admit it.
, he realises what a shitty move it had been, because now every time he looks at the boy, he couldn’t help but think about him under him—his flushed cheeks when he realises what was happening, the sound that had left his throat when Harry had leaned over him. His pale skin against his own, all smooth and so markable.
She took out two small transparent vials, grinning. With a swift motion, she climbs beside him, handing him one of the vials.
“I remember you,” he continued with a growing euphoria, “against me. Your arms,” he places his hands on his shoulders, remembering the firm muscles with delights, and slid his fingers on his bare arms.
Flicking his eyes, Draco look at one of the elves – Dobby, he recalls – staring at the older with confusion. It seemed like this argumentation was going since quite some time already, if the twitch at the man’s hands was any indication.
Draco beamed. “Isn’t it?” He turns around to look at himself in the mirror. He was back at him, and each time he spins to check himself better, the skirt graze at the bottom of his buttocks.
“You call this pug-faced a guest?” He was smirking, mocking and mean. “No wonder Longbottom is the only one who wants to fuck her.”
The day passed in a blur. A day like any other day – a Monday that wasn’t all that surprising. Same routine, same faces – a calm and living day at Hogwarts.
“A boyfriend, maybe?” the boy continues, less subtle. There was hunger inside his eyes—but not only. Something more perplexing was making his eyes shine, and Harry frowned, letting go of his hand.
The blond removed his hand quickly, and turn his head toward the window. What was he doing, really? He thought, mad at himself. What the bloody fuck was he doing?
Letting go of the door, he walks toward him and put his hand on the table. He leans a bit, dropping his elbows on the wood, and shift his legs in a way that make his body look voluptuous.
He feels it coming. His muscles contract and his movements became erratic, his hips bucking uncontrollably. He let his nipple and grip his dick, stroking fast as his breath itches and shakes.
“I’ll take a shower first,” the girl said, running toward the stairs. Draco gaped at her but she was already climbing the staircase, disappearing on the first floor without slowing down.
Notwithstanding, that went pretty easily. Potter was clearly reluctant, but at least he had said yes—well, not technically but he did surrenders without a fight. Draco was too happy to care, and make a point in showing it. And if the way the man had frowns at him was any indication, then this date was going to be a piece of cake.
The blond sniffs, and turns his head. Potter stares at him before sighing, and somehow the tension between them melts away.
Not even finishing half of his plate, the man stops eating. He let go his fork and cleans his mouth before calling the waitress.
Harry tilted his head in greeting, on guard. The last time he was there, Malfoy had tried to expose his thoughts. According to the papers, he was a good legilimens. Harry didn’t think he could last very long with a mind battle.
His breath itches, and a choke moan escapes him. Moving again, he slides his hand further under him, parting his legs and exposing his intimacy, shuddering with anticipation.
Pansy freeze, then looks at him with big eyes. Draco didn’t know what was that odd about what he had said, but her look was unnerving.
He stopped in front of him and took the cigarette out of his lips. He was close, and Harry noticed that his eyes were sharps, almond-shaped eyes, glowing in the night like mercury and wrapped under fluttering longs pales eyelashes. So close, he could make out the differences between him and Lucius. Where the chief was all firm and hard, Draco face was sharp but delicate at some point. His cheeks were pink, his nose was thin and curved, and his lips were very defined, pinkie and pulpy. He looks almost like a doll, his features perfect and refined. The only difference was his eyes, so troublesome—like his emotions created a storm in them.
He opened the door but didn’t get inside. Like he had tough, Potter was there; he was leaning against the counter, a cup of coffee in his hand. His locks of hair were wild at the top of his head, but strangely, it was…good.
He goes down the stairs and walks toward the kitchen. Pausing in front of the door, he tries to catch some noises, but all he could hear was his own breathing. Was Potter actually there? And if he was, what was he supposed to say?
She sighs. “You were so cute before. Now look at you.” She was making a face, like a deceive Mother.
“I never came here,” he said finally as he let himself drop into the central couch. He crossed his legs and replace a lock of hair behind his ear. “Nice place”
Resurfacing, he flattens his hair behind his neck and pushes himself in the water up to his chest. What a shitty way to start a day, he thought, looking at his reflection that was waving before him. He had just woken up, but was already feeling tired. And as if that wasn’t enough, he had to have a bad night. He wasn’t the type to interpret his dreams, but this one was really confusing. And kind of embarrassing, if he excluded the end. How long had it been since he had a wet dream? Being this disturbed by a hot-looking guy—it was like he was a pre-teen again. He shudders as he remembers the way he had been held on the bed, exposed and openly vulnerable. The way Potter had kissed him like he was trying to suck out his soul. Does he really kiss like that, in reality?
Draco frowns. “You’re lying.” He bits his lips and grips the edge of his sit tightly. It was so confusing, all these emotions that were coursing thought him. He was mad and sad and didn’t even know why.
He had thought about the best move he could put at the start. If he failed here, all this hard work would have been for nothing. The first step is the hardest, they said.
Draco shivered. “That’s not the same,” he retorted, fluttering his eyes shut. “They were at least cute enough for it.”
But even with his appealing face, the thing that was coming out the most was his scar. It was a long scar, partially covered by his wild locks, that runs between his eyes just below his nose. It was terrifying for most people, a source of admiration for others, because of the story that lie behind it; but looking at it now, Draco feel nothing but mixed feelings. Potter wasn’t the type to talk about his childhood, so the blond could just try and imagine what he had felt like to be the chosen one. Being himself the sole heir of a family that last since the end of times, he thinks that he could picture what kind of life he had had.
Harry couldn’t help his jaw from dropping open. “No-no she’s my friend. We’ve never…just, no. And besides, she isn’t exactly my type.” He had no idea why he said it, but there it was.
, but enough for Ron to get the idea. Like Hermione said, Ron was fine with it. He was just upset that Harry felt he couldn’t talk to him about it, but also understood it was his brother so…
When Harry opened the door, he couldn’t help but notice how…handsome Oliver looked. He was also wearing dark jeans and a maroon crew neck. But, unlike Harry, he was wearing a black jacket that looked so soft Harry wanted to reach out and touch it. He also couldn’t help but notice…they matched.
“Call me James, please. And yes, I suppose you’re right. It’s just we would have thought Harry would have mentioned it if
So, that’s what he decided to do. Before going to bed after speaking with Ron and Hermione, he wrote to Draco and explained everything just as Hermione had said to. He even asked if they could meet again.
“Right…well, I am actually. Nervous…but excited.” Harry smiled and it took everything Draco had not to take this man and kiss him senseless right then and there. But that would have to wait. He didn’t know how Harry would react to such a public act. Actually, Draco didn’t know how
Harry was starting to worry. Not hearing from Draco made all kinds of thoughts flood into Harry’s brain -none of them good. Harry felt better when he finally received a letter from Draco on his birthday, but it was short and didn’t explain why he had been away. Harry wrote several letters back – each time trying to space them out so Draco wouldn’t get in trouble.
Life began to feel as if it was back to normal around October. Once Ginny went off to school, the house felt empty for a while – but Bill and Fleur came around often, Percy decided to permanently move-in and the house was back to busting at the seams. George and Charlie were enjoying testing new products and re-designing the shop. Hermione felt she was making real progress in her “process”. Ron was still
Harry told himself many times over the next several months that he should stop. His feelings were getting dangerous. Charlie would smile at him across the room and Harry’s heart would stop. He would accidently brush against Harry while moving around the kitchen and Harry would go weak. He knew he should just stop. Stop having sex with Charlie. Stop looking at him from across the room. Stop watching him after a Quidditch game. Stop waiting for him at night. But he couldn’t. He didn’t want to.
Harry looked at Draco and could tell Draco had gotten very uncomfortable when everyone came to watch their showdown. But Blaise looked like he couldn’t care less. That was until he met Harry’s eyes.
Harry felt a warmth spread through him as he heard Molly say “my child”. Harry disregarded her anger and moved in to hug her. Molly was taken aback by the sudden change in mood, but quickly returned the hug.
“No, no one knows. Just you. It’s a fairly new development. I don’t like too much attention and therefore don’t want to broadcast anything about it at the moment. I’m enjoying my 4-week streak of NOT being the cover story of the Daily Prophet.”
“Just because not everyone has two men for godparents, doesn’t mean it isn’t normal. Don’t you love your Sirius and Remus?” Harry had called them ‘his Sirius and Remus’ from the time he could speak properly. It just kind of stuck.
“I – I think I am bisexual. And…I think…I like you.” If Draco’s heart skipped before, it came to a full stop now. Draco didn’t realize he never responded until Harry kept talking, “Draco?”
“But you knew him! We know he lived at the Manor!” Harry attempted to yell back, but Draco cut him off.
“But Harry, I don’t think Dean is interested in men…” And there it was. A fact Harry knew, but hadn’t wanted to really think about.
The four of them apparated away from the pitch and back towards the Manor. It was still rather early in the day and Harry decided to let Teddy play some more before having to head back home.
Harry’s face of relief seems to change to one of frustration the closer he gets to Draco. No doubt from being made to trek across the fields towards someone who is fully capable yet has no intention of meeting him hallway.
The sun wasn’t quite up yet so the house still had a faint darkness to it. But even in the dark, Harry looked…beautiful. And peaceful. And…
Eventually, Harry began to push himself off and the two returned to their spots from earlier. Draco was in a state of confusion and watched as Harry simply sat there and looked at the fire.
“There’s no one for me to speak with. My friends are…gone.” Draco watched as Hermione beat herself up in her head for not thinking about that.
If you asked Harry, he thought he was being smooth. But Hermione caught on quick. After a trip to Hogsmeade, in which Hermione found Harry sitting a little too close to Dean and laughing at literally everything the boy said, Hermione decided to speak to her best friend.
“What do you think they’ll say?” Draco tried to hide the concern in his voice but could tell it was seeping out.
Draco got up from his chair and moved towards Harry. Harry stayed sitting on the bed and looked up as Draco came closer. Draco put his hands behind Harry’s head, resting on the back of his neck. He motioned for Harry to move back a bit, then straddled him. Still looking down, he moved in to kiss him. Draco pushed further and made the kiss more heated, pushing his tongue to open Harry’s mouth and going in when Harry opened.
Draco took a seat near his father at the very long table that sat in their formal dining room. Voldemort discussed a plan that only Draco could execute. He was to figure out a way to get Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Then, he was to kill Albus Dumbledore.
wanted. That would be way out of line.” Draco stood his ground as he watched Charlie reach for his wand.
Harry was at this. Harry began to move and adjust himself, all the while never breaking the kiss. Next thing Draco knew, Harry was in his lap – legs straddled over him. For someone who had just dated a girl, Harry sure did seem eager to be in this position with Draco…
“Oh, piss off Ron.” Harry and Ron changed and started to head back to the castle. Ron continued to make fun of Harry all the way back to the school. “Mate, the curtains in the dorms close, but they aren’t sound-proof. You were engaging in a lot of solo activities third year…and now that I know you’re gay, I would bet good money they involved a certain Quidditch player’s… ‘Wood’.” Harry laughed at the terrible use of Oliver’s name, but stopped dead in his tracks when he entered the school and saw Draco there, standing and what looked like waiting on him.
Draco awoke slowly the next morning after a rather decent night of sleep. Going to bed on a full stomach did wonders for your sleep, apparently. But as he awoke, smile plastered on his face, he slowly remembered…Potter.
Draco Malfoy loved Christmas. It was easily his favorite holiday of the year. Growing up at the Manor, Christmas was a very important time. The house was always decorated beautifully – several trees, all immaculately dressed to perfection with piles upon piles of gifts seated neatly underneath.
Draco’s letters became fewer and fewer, but they never stopped. Harry considered writing back on several occasions but could never bring himself to do it. He found himself thinking about the blonde-haired man constantly. He would replay lazy Saturdays between the two of them in his head when he was feeling particularly upset. Sometimes these thoughts helped, other times they made the feelings worse.
In the midst of his fighting, he felt a cold hand touch his back. It was at that moment that he realized his shirt had ridden up and he must now look awful. He heard the owner of the cool hand speak to Ron, “I’ll take him home. Just tell me where I’m going.”
Draco was right about his father’s trial. Harry was not as generous as he had been for Draco or Narcissa. As a matter of fact, Harry Potter refused to speak on behalf of Lucius Malfoy altogether and instead gave over his memories of the man from the past seven years. More than enough to convict.
Draco pulled back to where his forehead was resting against Harry’s – both of them had their eyes closed. “I love you Harry Potter.”
Draco sat on the end of the sofa, at the moment, wishing it was larger so they wouldn’t feel so close for this conversation. Draco looked at Harry and waited for him to continue.
They went up and tucked the boys in. Harry had already levitated a spare mattress into the room and added linens before the Malfoys arrived. Draco whispered a ‘
He knew Voldemort had lived at Malfoy Manor but he had never really thought about what that would mean for the family already living there…Harry didn’t really have a childhood home that held fond memories, but Draco did and a deranged wizard took that from him. A dark wizard came in and began killing people and torturing his family in the same spots he had grown up in…There was so much about Draco for Harry to learn.
“Draco…we still need to talk.” Draco shook his head as he felt a raindrop hit his nose. He looked up and noticed dark clouds starting to form.
It wasn’t as though Harry had never seen these things before. He simply hadn’t allowed himself to dwell on what he was seeing or allow himself time to focus on those things and think about what they meant. Or, maybe more than think…
Draco continued, “Harry. We’re drunk and this is really fast. Our kids are literally down the hall…” Harry knew these were all valid points but still hated how much he wanted to keep going.
He began to allow himself to indulge in some of the fantasies the dreams had created. And after a few nights of this, it soon became his favorite part of the day. He couldn’t figure out why he hadn’t done it sooner. After dinner, and once everyone in the house had gone to bed and his bedroom door was closed and locked tight, Draco would ceremoniously get into bed and allow his mind and hands to wander.
Harry sat and began to be served by a different house elf than he had seen before. He began to wonder just how many house elves the Malfoys had. As he was about to start-in on his meal, anything to get this over with, Narcissa looked at him and asked “So, Mr. Potter, I believe my son is quite taken with you.”
When they got home, Harry began preparing dinner. He had been scolded many times by Hermione for allowing Teddy to get ice cream before dinner, but Malfoy did it for his son, so maybe it wasn’t so bad.
He held the letter in his hand and made his way back to his seat. As he sat down, he noticed Draco eyeing him with a confused look on his face.
“Stori was younger than us at Hogwarts, but we met shortly after her graduation and soon began dating. Stori was perfect…she was beautiful, smart, understanding, and a pureblood. My mother loved her. So, after six months of courting – we married. Shortly thereafter, she became pregnant.”
“Oh – you didn’t, I wasn’t going to…” Harry was stuttering, but he was still in shock. Draco bought him an ice cream…Was this the same Draco Malfoy from Hogwarts…?
Harry didn’t respond. Draco continued, “It doesn’t have to mean anything…” Draco was starting to feel panicked for some reason. The more Harry didn’t respond, the more nervous Draco grew. It wasn’t wrong what had happened…
“Not exactly…Hermione said she already ‘had a feeling’…whatever that means.” Draco smirked, that girl was too smart sometimes. “She just said we needed to be careful. She actually agrees with you about not going public yet.” Harry looked up at Draco and smirked.
The second term flew by quick. Their schoolwork was increasing with difficulty, but that just meant Harry and Draco turned their last night activities into study sessions…followed by activities. Most of the school had gotten over seeing the two of them together and by March, all whispers and stares had stopped. Blaise continued to be a nuisance, but Harry figured he must have given up on Draco because he too eventually stopped glaring.
Harry ate dinner quickly and had to fight off several “You okay, Harry?”s and found himself walking up the astronomy tower earlier than anticipated. When he arrived, Draco was already there. The space looked like he came up there a lot. There were blankets on the ground and pillows spread around.
“Okay. But your father won’t like this. I mean, I believe you Harry if you say he’s different, but your father holds a very strong grudge against Lucius Malfoy. This is the man that followed the darkest wizard of all time. A wizard who came on a mission to kill you. Your father won’t give that up.”
They left for winter break and Draco kept his word – he didn’t write. Harry was conflicted – part of him hoped an owl would arrive in the middle of the day with a surprise letter from Draco, but another part of him was terrified of receiving a letter from Draco and having his dad see it.
Draco watched as the Dark Lord spoke to him, but he couldn’t feel his body. His hands had gone numb and his brain went blank. He tried to listen as instructions were given but had tuned out a majority of the information. He didn’t snap back until he heard Voldemort say, “take the dark mark”.
Draco moved his arms to his chest as a way to both hide the mark and his exposed chest. Harry moved to sit down next to him and both men moved in a way that their backs rested against the sofa and their feet towards the fire – side by side.
“Okay, so then, why am I here? You said you wanted to finish the conversation, but if you don’t want to talk about Blaise, then what do you want to talk about?”
Harry boarded the Hogwarts Express at the age of 11, absolutely terrified. He felt if he didn’t have Ron by his side, then he would have never gotten on the train. Ron was his anchor. The two of them made a pact the night before when they had stayed over at Sirius and Remus’ house, “no matter what, we stick together. Even if we are in separate houses. Even if we meet other friends. We stay together – no matter what.” They spit in their hands and shook on it.
Harry had seen before. Draco moved toward Harry and kissed him. The two rose to where they were both standing in the middle of the library and this time, Draco took control. He placed his hand behind Harry’s head and let the other rest on his hip and moved him closer until their bodies were pressed hard against one another. Harry ran his hands over Draco’s chest and felt a familiar shiver take over his body. Draco’s hand starting to go lower and as the kiss became more and more heated, Harry finally pulled away.
Harry responded and they continued back and forth until two days before Harry’s birthday. Harry had written to Draco about it several times and they had discussed ways in which Harry could handle the situation (some actually helpful, others not so much – like Harry parading around in his “birthday suit” and showing Charlie “what he was missing out on”, definitely Draco’s idea).
That was it. Harry couldn’t handle it anymore. Without thinking, he held up his wand and magic flew out of him. Draco, Crabbe and Goyle all went flying back and hit the wall – hard.
about…anything. You can ask me. I know it’s probably embarrassing to ask your parents and honestly, there are a number of things they probably won’t be able to help you with. So, I’m here.”
Harry looked back at Draco, “I think we should celebrate. Ron and Hermione will be happy to hear about this.” Harry would be blind to miss the terrified expression on Draco’s face.
Honestly, Harry wasn’t okay either. He didn’t tell Draco about the meeting with Astoria. At first it was because he was waiting to see what she would do, but as more and more time had gone by, it just became better that way. Maybe she was gone for good… Maybe what Harry said worked…
“That’s great Harry! Is it just for the evening or…does Teddy need to stay over with us?” Hermione was taking this completely differently than her husband.
“Yeah. The second time…that was not me at my best. But, Blaise had enough. Obviously, I wasn’t doing a good enough job of hiding my feelings for you and Blaise took it upon himself to out me and our relationship. He told people very…personal things and I was hurt. I didn’t give a shite that he ended things with me. I was upset because now
Harry dropped Teddy off at Hermione and Ron’s that night under the pre-text of “Don’t you want to have a sleepover at your Aunt Hermione and Uncle Ron’s?” Teddy always loved staying over at their house, so he didn’t question it too much when he got dropped off on Saturday.
As much as this weighed on his mind, he couldn’t stop thinking about the kiss. It was…perfect. It was everything he ever thought kissing Harry Potter would be and more. As much as he wanted to block it out and pretend it didn’t happen (because honestly that would be easier than acknowledging it did indeed happen and that Harry had run off after), he couldn’t. He replayed it every night before he went to sleep for the rest of break. He knew it was dangerous. He needed to block it out – make it go away. There was no use focusing on it.
“Oh, me? No, I was just looking for the loo when I overheard some raised voices and thought I would make sure everything was alright. Which, I can see now, it isn’t.”
The tension must have been too much for Harry too because he quickly said, “Think it’s time to head back. People will likely be getting back from Hogsmeade soon.” And without waiting for Draco’s reply, started moving back towards the castle.
The following week Harry didn’t hear from Draco. This wasn’t unusual – he figured Draco had gotten consumed by his work, just as Harry had. Nevertheless, Harry arrived at Malfoy Manor the next Saturday at their usual time.
“You know, when you said out in public, I kind of imagined more of the public being around…” Draco commented after the kiss.
Quidditch try outs, no matter who it is trying out. And actually, my boyfriend and I broke up six months ago.” Harry just stared.
“Well, don’t look so surprised. I had been…thinking about you…I guess. I started looking for you about six months after the trial. I literally looked everywhere…asked everyone I could possibly think of. And when no one had seen or heard from you, I was…worried.”
“Draco.” Draco could hear Harry attempting to suppress a laugh as he spoke, “Did you get knocked off your horse trying to ride him and fall into the fence?”
“Am I sure about what? That I’m bisexual? I mean, pretty sure. About liking you? I’m pretty sure about that too. I feel…different about you than I ever have with anyone. Even Ginny…you and I feel…right?”
Harry was shocked by the bluntness of the statement. He opened his mouth to speak, but Draco kept talking.
“Well, I’m not. I’m not bloody okay. I feel like I’ve been dumped…again! And I was never even dumped to begin with! I feel….stupid and foolish and dumb and all of those words mean the same thing, but you get what I’m saying!” Harry threw the covers over his head again and sunk into the bed.
He prepared his usual breakfast, a cup of tea and a single egg. He had to admit that after last night’s feast, this breakfast seems awfully depressing. But just as he sat to eat, he heard a rustling coming from the make-shift bed in the living room.
Draco didn’t say it aloud, but he knew he was falling for Harry too. Little things Harry did were big for Draco. Draco spent
The thought wasn’t as shocking as it probably should have been. Thinking back on it, it all made perfect sense. Things with Cho never worked out (obviously for many reasons), but ultimately it was because (as he could now acknowledge) he actually fancied Cedric. He never allowed himself to entertain these thoughts in the past. They seemed silly and trivial compared to the events in his life. But now, with nothing else to focus on, here they were.
“It’s fine Leona, Harry was just leaving.” Draco turned to look at Harry before continuing, “I’ll write you and we will find time to talk more.” Harry smiled and made his way from the manor before apparating to Hermione and Ron’s.
Ron immediately went red and slammed the door back. Hermione looked at Harry with pity, but Harry stood strong. He refused to let this get to him this year. Dean had occupied enough of his time and energy – it was time to move on. And honestly, seeing him with Ginny was even better. At least this way Harry couldn’t get his hopes up about what could have been…
Harry and Draco exchanged looks. Somehow silently communicating if this day is okay with both parties before Harry responded, “Sure kid. Saturday.” Harry took the boy and led him towards the door when Teddy spun around back towards the father-son in the entry way.
“Oh – um, are you sure? You’ve had quite a bit to drink. Do you want to just stay here?” Harry knew how that sounded the minute he said it and immediately regretted it.
“Figure this shite out with Draco, then come find me Harry. That is, if you’re still interested…” and just like that, Harry’s fantasy was over. Oliver dressed himself as Harry stood, immobile. Then walked out the room.
“Harry…” Harry heard his name whispered across the table and looked up to see Draco with tears in his eyes. “Thank you…” Harry’s heart stopped. Thank you? Thank you for getting your son taken from you?
“I’m beginning to think this isn’t coincidence Mrs. Greengrass.” Harry attempted a smile but was rather annoyed that the doting woman seemed to be here again.
“It’s going to be me, right? I’m going to be the problem?” Draco knew it was true, so he didn’t know why his voice sounded so hurt by it.
Teddy wore an expression that said ‘there’s no way you’ll guess what I want’. His face was smug, and he crossed his arms over one another on his chest.
As Harry sat in his normal spot near the fire, he could no longer stay silent. “Draco, what the hell is going on? Why are you acting so…formal?”
Seeming to catch Draco’s lack of understanding or response, Harry continued, “Seems like it’s a lot of work for just one person to run this place by themselves. I noticed you don’t really use magic, so it must make things even more challenging. And…I have the day off! So…thought I could help.” The boyish grin that occupied Harry’s face should not have been as endearing as it was.
Draco did a quick look around and to make sure no kids were nearby and pushed Harry up against a wall, kissing him hard. Harry responded back quickly. The two continued in this way until Draco backed off and gestured for Harry to follow him into the study.
What could this mean? If his father had sources at Hogwarts, then who knows what he was capable of achieving from Azkaban.
“And what? Miss out on Harry Potter living out all of his childhood fantasies? Having Oliver Wood fuck him in the middle of the Quidditch pitch?” Harry’s face flushed and he noticed a familiar slur in Draco’s words. Draco was drunk…again.
The two never stopped talking it felt like. They could talk about everything. They talked about work, family life, potions, politics…everything. Harry was worried that with their different upbringings and everything that had happened during the war that the two wouldn’t see eye-to-eye on many things, but it turned out Draco had more sophisticated thoughts on a lot of things than Harry did.
. But that was dumb. He knew Draco Malfoy. Draco Malfoy wasn’t a Gryffindor. He needed to be told how much someone loved him…and that’s okay. Harry could do that for him.
Winter break came too quick for Harry. He was excited to go home, but it was bittersweet. He wasn’t ready to leave Draco. They discussed writing, but felt it was probably best if they didn’t. Neither of them wanted to address the elephant in the room…their fathers. So instead, they pushed it off until the last day and even then, the conversation was short.
As Harry was becoming more comfortable with the idea of his sexuality, he allowed himself to not only be
“What? Caring? Yeah, well, you never really bothered to know me Potter. Granted, it’s not entirely your fault, but I was rather good in potions and I enjoyed it quite a bit. And after the trial I decided I wanted to do something important with my life. I needed to make up for all the harm I had caused over the years. Both mentally and physically.”
Teddy was thrilled every single time Harry mentioned seeing Scorpius and ‘Mr. Draco’. The two boys had yet to grow tired of one another, just like their guardians…
Draco couldn’t stop the smile from creeping onto his face. He quickly moved out of his seat and Harry saw his eyes turn from unsure to the look of
“Mum, why do I have two godfathers and no godmother?” Harry and Lily had been sitting on the couch after a mother-son day (which occurred whenever James went out with Sirius and Remus for the day and often turned into a mother-son night as well).
Oliver looked at Harry, “What did I tell you, Harry Potter? Your future is bright.” And kissed him. Right in the middle of the Quidditch pitch…and it was perfect. Harry felt his knees go weak and his heart stop.
Draco couldn’t sit in the silence and continued, “But look Harry…I get it. I know that’s a lot to take in and I don’t really expect anything. I know you say you like me, but I get it if you don’t really want to…” Draco wasn’t allowed to finish his sentence before Harry’s lips were locked on his. It took Draco a moment to process what was happening before committing himself to the kiss, fully. Harry made the kiss more heated and pushed further against Draco.
Draco received the answer to this question exactly one day after Christmas. A meeting was occurring in the dining hall of the Manor and Draco was tired of being holed up in his bedroom. He still didn’t have a door on the room and was growing weary of his lack of privacy – he began to wish he was back at school.
Before he knew it, he was out of his seat. If it wasn’t time for their first class, Harry would have looked ridiculous getting up the way he did. But everyone in the Great Hall was getting ready to transition to their first class so Harry had to fight through what felt like a mountain of first years to get to Draco.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Before you two start, he slept in a separate room. Nothing happened…well, basically nothing.” His friends’ eyes grew wide.
Sure, he had heard about her. He knew Draco had been married and by now he knew the story pretty well, but…he never thought she’d resurface. Which in hindsight might have been foolish of him. She wasn’t dead. This was Scorpius’ mother, of course she would come around eventually…
The two made their way back to the farm and Draco would be a fool if he didn’t admit that two people carrying things back was much easier than just himself. Potter had actually come in handy today.
he needed them to watch Teddy Saturday night, he knew it had to happen. So, he arrived at their house on Thursday evening, Teddy in tow.
He had never actually laid eyes on Voldemort before. He didn’t know what he was expecting, but the creature that entered his house certainly wasn’t it. Draco felt the house grow cold as a snake appeared and began to slither around the floor of the living area. Draco felt like he was going to be sick.
Teddy screamed a loud “Ha!” before continuing, “Nope! Blueberry with chocolate and hot fudge!” Teddy seemed proud that the man had gotten it wrong, but the wizard just smiled again.
Draco looked up and he met the eyes of the man in front of him. He hadn’t noticed how much he had been avoiding those eyes all meal. “Fine.”
The family, with Oliver, made their way into the living room where Lily had prepared hot chocolates and eggnog for the family to enjoy before Christmas dinner and gifts. His family took this time to interrogate Oliver.
As he passed a boy’s lavatory, he heard a familiar sound. He took a deep breath and pushed the door open. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting to find, but a drunk Draco Malfoy crying on the bathroom floor certainly wasn’t it. Harry quickly surveyed the room and saw the bottle of Firewhisky in Draco’s hand as well as Draco’s school uniform completely wrecked. This, usually perfect boy, was a complete mess and slouching on a bathroom floor.
Growing up, Harry never knew that other kids didn’t have two godfathers, they had godparents – a woman and a man. Harry thought it was ‘normal’ to have his Sirius and his Remus. He also thought everyone’s godfather was a dog and a wolf, but that’s a different conversation. Harry didn’t think much of any of this when he was little, this was his version of normal.
He told them how he and Draco had started writing, and the plan at the party, and the…almost kiss. Ron didn’t love hearing about the details, but Harry could tell he was trying. Hermione approached everything as she normally did – with a dose of empathy and a lot of logic.
Harry handed over the letter and watched as Draco read the outside and saw his face fall. He immediately stood up from the table and made his way into the back room. Harry looked at the boys and noticed they continued to eat their meal and didn’t even notice Draco had left.
“Um – good” Draco had to clear his throat from whatever mess was trying to come out, “Good morning Potter.”
“I think what James is trying to say is this a delightful surprise Oliver. We’re happy you can join us.” Thankfully Remus came to his rescue and hit Sirius in his side to stop him from laughing.
“Does he…does he talk about me? To Scorpius?” The words were barely audible coming from her mouth, but Harry heard her loud and clear.
“Um, just kidding?” Draco responded towards the boys before looking at Harry with a concerned but amused look in his eyes.
“I-I can’t just talk to Harry Potter. He’s not going to help you. He hates you. I don’t know why he spoke for mum or me, but I can assure you he won’t do the same for you. Even if I did ask.” Draco watched his father’s face change.
longer. The man insisted on talking and making what is usually a rather peaceful walk, nearly painful. Harry must have gotten the hint because he stopped a third of the way and they made the rest of the walk in silence.
“I’ve already written to her. I set up a meeting for the two of us tomorrow…she came in from Scotland yesterday apparently to meet with the lawyers, which is why we got the paperwork today. She’s at Leona’s…”
Harry’s heart soared. He immediately kissed Draco before realizing he didn’t say anything back and pulled away. “I love you too”, then proceeded to kiss Draco more.
Harry flipped around and saw Oliver with his head in his hands and moving towards a bench to sit down. “No Harry. I’m sorry. This isn’t how this is starting. I can’t just
Harry moved in to kiss Draco and made sure to put as much feeling into it as possible. He felt the other man return.
Harry was spending more time with Draco than he had his entire life…and he liked it. He liked when Draco make snarky comments about things in their day to day life, he liked when Draco took
Once he snapped back to the situation, he heard Draco yell “Perfect Potter! Come to join me?!” Harry noticed Draco wave the near-empty bottle around.
“It’s okay. We don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to.” Harry was worried Draco would freeze up.
No one spoke as Harry sat down. They all sat in silence and watched as he piled his plate with all of his favorites – which Draco sadly knew well. Once his plate was full, he must have felt the tension and looked up to find six eyes staring at him.
Draco caught himself quick, “No – no I don’t. Not at all. But I’ll do whatever you want. Like I told you Harry, I’m in this. I like this.” Draco gestured between himself and Harry. “I don’t really mind it being out. I know it’s going to cause a lot of people to be unhappy, but I don’t really care… I’m happy. We’re happy. And it’s been seven years…people will need to get it over it eventually.”
It had been seven years since the war and Harry was still adjusting. Everyone kept saying it would ‘take time’ and so he gave it time…but time apparently doesn’t heal all. He still had nightmares, he still grew nervous in crowds, and he still got recognized when he went out and public. Time didn’t change any of those things.
Without thinking, Harry looked at Oliver. Oliver was perfect. He was strong, and brilliant, and successful and…he wanted Harry. Harry took Oliver’s hand and started leading him towards the Quidditch changing rooms.
“Yeah, well, I learned a lot from it...if you know what I mean”. Draco winked and Harry felt heat rise up on his neck and pictures flooded into Harry’s head.
He checked the list several times in the week leading up to winter break and was happy each time to find he was the only one staying. He figured everyone wanted to be back home with their family after the war. But not him. He would be completely happy to stay in this dorm by himself all break.
He’s so busy in his thoughts and watching his godson, that he doesn’t notice a father and son trying to walk in the same door as they’re trying to exit.
Oliver looked towards Harry and winked. His father had just made a highly suggestive comment and Oliver Wood
Harry loved his friend. He loved him for thinking that and he loved him for always looking out for him, but right now, he needed him to support him.
“I, I don’t think I’m ready for that yet. I’m still figuring stuff out.” Harry knew that was an understatement and was code for ‘I’ve been staring at Quidditch posters…and you.’
This was surprisingly easy to do because as soon as he entered the house, he realized none of it looked familiar. When he made this comment to Draco, Draco explained how after his father was taken away, his mother decided to do a complete remodel “to purge all the dark magic out of this once beautiful estate.”
further, and he knew Draco had more experience than him, but he wanted to end their first semester together with something special.
When he first got the land, he had one horse. It was a rather sad and old horse that didn’t really do much. Draco had always heard of muggles riding horses and decided he wanted to give it a try. Once he finally figured out how to grow wheat (after about six months of nearly starving from no money), he made a little bit of money and bought himself a horse. After many failed attempts, he learned to ride it and quickly fell in love. It reminded him of riding a broom. The way the wind whipped past him, the feeling in his heart when he went up on the horse, then crashed back down.
Draco gave a sniffle before answering, “yes”. Narcissa tore away from her son and looked at Harry. Her eyes were piercing, but Harry stood firm beside Draco.
Draco could feel himself in his pants and knew his pajama bottoms weren’t hiding anything at this point, but he could also feel Harry…
Almost as if he knew what Harry was doing, as soon as he finished, an owl tapped on his window. An owl he was now all to accustom with.
Oliver returned it and continued, “Sorry I haven’t been around much. My goal was to help with practices and be more present for all teams, but Hooch’s course load is insane. And let me tell you ‘arry, teaching first years how to ride a broom is more taxing than you could possibly imagine.”
Narcissa moved back towards her husband. “Lucius, we’re leaving.” Harry heard her tone change and now sounded much stronger than she had before.
“Yeah! That’d be brilliant!” Harry walked behind Draco as he led them to “their spot”. Harry sat down opposite Draco in the near exact position they had been in weeks ago when they were engaging in a very different conversation.
helpful, but Harry understood what he meant. He needed to spend time with Draco and get to know him. As a person, not as just another gay man he now knew.
“Lily, I promise I’ll be fine. You have all done enough for me already. Really.” Oliver gave his award-winning smile and Harry saw his mother give-in. “Well, alright, if you say so.”
moving. Not breaking away. Just standing there and staring at one another. He watched as Draco took a small, yet wobbly, step forward and looked down at Harry’s eyes and then further down to his lips. Harry always hated that Draco was just a little taller than him, but in this moment – he kind of loved it.
Harry was frustrated with his ‘friends’ and went up to the dorms and closed his curtain. He didn’t want to deal with his friends and if that meant skipping dinner, then so be it.
“Actually, I know Draco very well. I’ve known Draco Malfoy for a very long time you see. And I know quite a bit about your relationship. I know that he asked for a divorce because he wasn’t happy. I know he wanted his freedom – wanted to be able to be who he was. And I know you left him and your son rather than working something out. But now…now you want to be involved. Why? Because he’s with someone? Because he’s with a man…? Because he’s with me?”
Draco laid in bed that night, unable to sleep. Honestly, he hardly slept anymore anyway, but tonight, it wasn’t the war keeping him up. It was Harry. Stupid, arrogant, annoying Potter. Who the hell did he think he was? What gave him the right to come barging onto Draco’s property and demand he leave with him?
Harry returned to Hogwarts for his final term with an empty feeling in his stomach. He was not ready to leave this place. He decided to turn his attention elsewhere and focus on his classes and his upcoming Quidditch tryout.
“Hey, Savior of the Wizarding World, you are definitely not the worst person. You’re talking to a death eater – you could be much much worse.”
James always knew this was a lie. He didn’t trust the Malfoys and made sure Harry didn’t either. When James heard that Lucius had a son Harry’s age, James repeatedly told his son to stay away from him at school. Harry never disobeyed his father.
“Fine…?” He looked at the man in front of him with irritation and an eye roll. “Look Potter. We both know why you’re here. I’ve already said this before, but apparently you have short-term memory or something. I’m not leaving this place.”
“Potter. You won’t do anything. You never do. A coward, just like your father. Yeah, Snape (you know, MY
Hermione smiled, “Harry…we know. You’ve been leaving early from dinner every night for the past month for ‘homework’, yet you aren’t in the library or in the common room. You’re significantly happier than I’ve ever seen you and you haven’t talked about Dean
“Yuck!!!” Teddy screamed from behind them while Scorpius stood off to the side, doubled-over pretending to throw-up. The boys had come back into the kitchen and were now looking up at their fathers.
“I – I mean. We have plenty of extra rooms and stuff.” Harry panicked trying to fix his mistake and was surprised when Draco said, “sure” before sitting back down at the table and pouring two more glasses.
“She’s agreed to meet with me.” Harry said as he looked at his worried friends again. They would meet tomorrow. Unfortunately, Harry didn’t have the connections Draco did to secure a private restaurant so she would have to come to Grimmauld Place. Harry asked Hermione to watch Teddy for the day, “in case things turn ugly, you know?”
Harry found himself staring, lost, into the common room fire when, seemingly, out of nowhere, a body plopped down beside him. Harry looked to his right and saw the face of Dean Thomas.
Harry tore his eyes away from the man and back down to the two boys in front of him. One, obviously being his godson still pushing down tears and staring at the other little boy. The other, a smaller boy (likely younger), blonde haired with grey eyes – like his father, Harry thought. Neither of the boys spoke and so Harry moved them to the side of the shop and knelt down.
they must have cost a small fortune. When Draco noticed Harry staring, he took it as an opportunity to be his awful self, “close your mouth Potter.
After what felt like hours, Harry found himself in relaxed, normal conversation with Draco Malfoy. He didn’t know why, but he felt like he could let his guard down. This Draco didn’t seem like he wanted to hurt him. This one didn’t seem like he wanted to outright insult him. This Draco seemed like he wanted to be friends… And Harry liked it.
“I know…but I don’t care what’s ‘easy’ because what you’re really saying is it won’t be ‘easy’ for other people. This is actually really easy for me…surprisingly. I mean, this feels…natural?” The way Harry looked at him in that moment could have melted Draco’s heart right then and there.
He thought back to that time on the train before first year. He thought about Draco extending his hand to him. He was actually incredibly rude to Draco – Draco had offered his friendship and Harry turned him away for what? Something his father had told him? Harry loved and trusted his father, but his father’s opinions were of Lucius…not Draco. And who’s to say his father was right…?
They did end up talking the next day and every single day after. It took Draco the next two weeks to fully come to terms with everything.
“You were! You were pining! That’s how you know I like treacle tart!” Harry was excited to put it all together. It made so much sense…
Draco smiled, “I definitely have more than a crush…” and grabbed Harry’s neck to pull him in for a kiss.
Charlie watched Harry leave and as Harry turned his head around, Charlie attempted a half smile – somewhere between neutral and reassuring. As soon as he was sure Harry was out of sight, Charlie ran his fingers through his hair and let out an exhale. There is was. The Boy Who Lived, The Savior, The Chose One, was gay. And Charlie was screwed.
Draco Malfoy’s appearance at the ball was obnoxious as usual. After Harry’s magic outburst last year, Draco had taken a backseat to his direct insults at Harry, but that didn’t change who he was as a person.
“Thanks…sorry, I know this is annoying and awkward. It’s just every time I go out there, they’re everywhere!” Draco knew he was referring to the girls.
The two finished up their meal, paid, and started to head towards the door. Harry turned to look at Draco only to find Draco already looking at him.
Draco read the letter three times before giving it to Harry. When Harry was finished, he looked at his boyfriend and saw him crying.
“Sure Harry. Just know, we are here for you if you want to talk. I know Ron doesn’t seem open it to it now, but I think he was just surprised is all.”
Harry could not find it within himself to match Draco’s tone. “More time Draco?! All I’ve given this is time! It took us months to even kiss! I don’t know what else you want from me.”
Draco rolled his eyes and shifted himself toward Harry, “No. I thought it would rain last night, so I’m checking to see if it did. That would adjust what we needed to do today. But looks as though the rain was light and therefore, we will continue with the original plan for today.”
Harry was shocked. “I-I had no idea. I thought…I thought we were friends…”. Part of Harry knew that was a lie.
or Ron trying to hex me or something.” Draco thought the last one was probably a joke but chose not to laugh just in case.
“Harry. I’ve thought about you since the first time I met you on the train. I just…I wanted to be your friend so badly, but you rejected me. After that, I decided I was going to make your life hell. Which worked…until fourth year. I saw you at the Yule Ball and you looked miserable with your date, but you also looked…beautiful.” Draco turned quiet and looked back down at the ground.  “I told myself that it would never happen and that I needed to move on. Which I did…until this year. When we came back and I saw you staring, I thought…maybe. I slowly allowed myself to think that there could be something between us. Every time you looked at me or I caught you staring, I let myself think more and more. That first night in the bathroom….” Harry watched Draco hesitate.
“It’s alright Mrs….Narcissa. I just thought Draco was this charming with all witches and wizards.” It was Harry’s turn to shoot Draco a smirk and he even threw in a wink for good measure.
“No – it’s not that. I just…” Draco let out an exhale, it was his turn to gather his thoughts and Harry seemed to realize this and stayed quiet, “I just was thinking a lot last night. And I don’t think we should take this public.” He saw the way Harry’s face dropped almost as if he deflated.
The events of the war will forever live in Draco’s memories. He will never forget the feeling of being face-to-face with his old headmaster, ready to kill him (although he knew he never would). He will never erase the visions of the Carrows torturing first years as Draco stood idly by and did nothing.
Draco laughed and turned to prop himself up on his elbow before looking at Harry. “Yeah, well, we were quite busy being arch nemesis.”
“I want to hear about all of it. Whatever you want to tell me.” Harry couldn’t help but notice Draco sounded…sad somehow. He knew he was still trying to sound confident and suave, like always – but there was something in the way he spoke that sounded like he just wanted company. So, Harry obliged.
“It’s not important. Eat up Potter. Get some rest – I’ll see you tomorrow.” Draco left without hearing Harry’s response.
Harry wanted to get out of the classroom as soon as he could. He was tossing his books into his bag when, in his haste, he knocked one over onto the floor in front of his table. He let out a groan but quickly stopped when he looked to see someone bending down to pick it up for him. Harry hated himself for how he watched Draco bend over and get the book. But he also hated Draco for bending down like that. Honestly, who
“Potter…relax. There are worse things than having a school full of girls chase after you.” Draco tried to offer a helpful smile.
He didn’t have too long to think before Teddy quickly ran to find Scorpius, leaving Harry and Draco alone with their conversation.
“Harry…we aren’t angry…we’re just concerned. Why didn’t you tell us you were with Malfoy?” Hermione’s voice was calm – Harry could tell she had been preparing herself for this conversation since the scene this morning.
Harry could barely keep his focus during what would be his last start of term feast. When Dumbledore rose to speak, Harry tried to fix his eyes on this older man but was immediately drawn to trying to meet Draco’s eyes at the Slytherin table. Draco hadn’t looked at Harry once…what was happening?
After a lot of tossing and turning, Harry decided the best way to do this was to be direct. Clear. No room for conversation.
“Well, here you are. Everything should be in there. If you need anything…” Harry paused and looked right at Draco, “…just let me know.” The two men stood in another doorway, feeling the tension rise.
“No Scorpius, I’m sorry Teddy isn’t here. Could you give your father and I a minute to talk?” Harry looked from the boy back to Draco.
The war is over. No one is fighting. Harry runs apparitions tests and Draco is a potions master. With a son. And an ex-wife…
Draco knew this was the likely possibly. Actually, he honestly thought it would be much worse. He expected Ron to yell at Harry and coming charging at Draco with an unforgivable ready on his wand.
Harry looked at Draco in disbelief. The two continued their staring contest and Draco decided to take this opportunity to finally look at Harry. The boy…
He stood up in a trance and walked over to the window and grabbed the letter. He opened it and found familiar handwriting –
in this…house. This house that once held fond memories of meals and holidays and gifts, but now represented terror and torture and trauma.
Harry honestly thought Draco was joking, so he agreed to it. But now that Draco Malfoy is standing outside the Burrow in tight Muggle jeans and a sharp black crew neck, Harry understands it was not a joke. Draco looked…amazing.
“Goodbye Potter.” Draco turned to make his way back to his barn, but heard Harry following quickly behind him.
Hermione decided the best course of action would be to write to Draco. Explain to him that he understood that it wasn’t the best thing to do, but to be honest with his emotions. Explain that he understood the timing wasn’t ideal, but that he did mean it. He needed to spend some time with Draco and see where things went from there.
The first name out of the goblet was the champion from Beauxbaton – Fleur Delacour. Harry heard a whimper escape Ron’s mouth as Hermione hit him over the head. Ron had fallen in love with this girl from the moment she arrived. Granted, he had never spoken to her, but he talked about her all the time. Harry felt it was rather annoying really. Hermione thought so too, but Harry suspected it was for other reasons.
The tournament itself sounded awfully dangerous, but just like everyone else, he was excited to see who would be representing Hogwarts. Harry sat at attention on the day where everyone was called into the Great Hall and names were pulled from a beautiful goblet. Dumbledore explained all of the rules beforehand on how students who were interested in participating could enter their names but made sure to go into great detail on the age restrictions. Harry knew that Dumbledore wanted to be clear on the dangers associated with the tournament, as well as the glory that would come with winning.
interaction. He didn’t understand some of their inside jokes and he was growing nauseated watching Ginny fawn over Harry, but all in all, he was enjoying himself.
Draco contemplates running but knows that will be obvious. He contemplates killing him but doesn’t have his wand and also understands that killing Harry Potter in the middle of a muggle farm in Lancashire is not the best option for him. It’s in his internal debate that Harry finally spots him.
“I want to do more…” Draco blushed as Harry looked down at Draco’s stomach and let his eyes drift further. “I’ve just never really…done much. I mean, even with Ginny…” Draco smiled, and it seemed to ease Harry a bit.
When he went back home for holidays, Harry would talk about the captain with his parents who would exchange looks every time Harry brought Oliver up. Harry would notice the looks, but quickly dismissed them.
“You’re a hero? That’s why people know who you are?” Harry could tell the boy didn’t know where to begin with the story or which questions to ask.
Harry decided to change the subject and tell Draco about his meeting with Kingsley. “I haven’t told anyone else about it, but…what do you think?” Harry was worried about the mention of muggle-borns and an acknowledgement of the war, but he forced himself to remember that this was a different Draco.
The longer Harry laid in bed the more he spiraled. He began to think of all the terrible things Draco had done while they were at Hogwarts and as a Death Eater. He began to think about all of the Malfoys and even though Narcissa and Draco helped Harry in the end, what if this was all some larger plot. What if Draco really hadn’t changed and was just waiting for an opportunity to find Harry at his weakest so he could….
Ron must have needed time to calm down because Harry never heard him come back but found him asleep in his bed the next morning.
The wizarding world does too. No one looks for him. No one has found him. And no one writes to him (likely because they have no earthly idea where he is). And at times, this saddens him. When he sees a large bird fly overhead while he’s out in his fields, he sometimes thinks it might be an owl. Maybe from Pansy, or Blaise, or someone… But it never is. And that’s okay. He doesn’t deserve friends.
“Don’t be sorry – you’re right. But luckily for me, it changed me for the better…I think. The war taught me a lot about myself and my family.” On the last word Draco shivered. He had been trying very hard not to think about his father but felt this was where the conversation was heading.
"Yes, now lie back before you make yourself sick. You're looking a little green," Draco scolded. He set the parcel aside and pressed lightly against Harry's shoulders until the sick Gryffindor flopped against his pillows. Two more doses of potions perched on the tray table by Harry's head, waiting for his awakening. Draco lifted one of the glasses to Harry's cracked lips, "Drink." Harry pressed his lips together, trying to turn away from the Slytherin, "Oh none of that," Draco caught Harry's chin in his free hand. He guided the boy back toward the glass and held him there until Harry gulped down the potion. Gagging at the taste of gym socks, Harry sputtered. The Slytherin hummed, stroking Harry's cheek with his thumb, "That's it. One more, then you can have your present." Harry's eyes widened behind his glasses. He glanced at the parcel.
He hauled Harry onto his lap by his underarms, “There, this should be more comfortable than sitting on the floor.” Harry stiffened. He tried to slide off, but Draco wouldn’t let him go. Huffing, he slumped against the blond’s chest. Draco chuckled, softening his grip on the other boy, “See Harry, just like Devil’s Snare. You relax and I loosen my hold.”
Harry bent down to pick up an abandoned stick but stopped wide-eyed as the colors of his robe shifted before his eyes. Gold and crimson replaced the silver and green. He was a Gryffindor again. He let the stick fall to the ground and kicked it, watching it rattle away. Eyes glassy again, he bent down to retrieve it when a finger tucked under his chin and dragged his gaze back up,
“Yes, you’ll find that Draco is a very touchy person. Don’t be surprised if he tries to cuddle you at some point.” Draco smacked his hand against Blaise’s thigh, a flush rushing through his cheeks. But he didn’t bother denying it or even moving from his perch. Instead, he lifted Blaise’s hand into position on his head. The boy complied, stroking Draco’s hair until the blond’s scowl softened.
“I know. It’s just hard to remember sometimes.” Draco nodded, “And I’d ask for help with my essay but some tosser left my textbook behind a rusty suit of armor.” Rolling his eyes, Draco reached down into his schoolbag on the floor and emerged with his copy of the book.
His eyes tore through the hall for any reflective surface to catch sight of his captor, but the unkept suits of armor and fogged up mirrors left nothing for him to see. The unknown figure let his hand fall from Harry’s mouth long enough to cuff the back of his head.
"Who, the niffler?" Luna asked. Harry shook his head, "Oh, you mean Draco Malfoy." Harry almost choked on his cocoa, "Yes, let's put some into a tin for him. Then you can give them to him when you tell him you like him."
Harry stirred in his bed. The bright sunlight of Christmas Eve filled the room. His glasses skewed on the end of his nose. Groaning, he sat up and fixed the glasses that he’d fallen asleep wearing. He rolled over to retrieve his wand and caught sight of something shiny. A golden snitch perched on his bedside table. Harry scooped up a little piece of paper beside it.
Harry's arms hooked around Draco's shoulders, clasping his hands together at the hollow of the blond's neck. His legs pressed against the Slytherin's hips, propped up by Draco's muscular arms. Chin resting on Draco's shoulder, Harry felt himself bob with each step he took. His fingers gripped the laces to his remaining trainer. It swayed and bumped into Draco's chest.
Nodding, Draco cast a spell at the fire to rekindle it before it could burn out, “Need to clear your mind?” He asked. Harry cocked his head to the side, eyes wary but a little less glassy than before, “Well, I’d offer to let you talk about it. But unless you’re giving up, that’s not going to happen.” Harry shook his head. He watched Draco summon a chessboard from the other side of the room. A soft smile curled on the Gryffindor’s lips. Harry sat up straighter on the bean bag. He snagged the chessboard out of the air before it could slam down and wake up half of the eighth-years.
“It seems your partner is more reluctant to perform than I am. But if it makes you feel better, Harry I won’t be watching. The music will have my full attention.” He swept over to the piano and took his place on the bench. Draco peeled the teacup out of Harry’s hands and tugged him up out of his seat to a clear spot on the floor. He clasped one of Harry’s hands, stretching them out away from the. The other arms crooked against each other on the other side.
He retreated to his plush chair in the corner to watch Draco prepare the tea. If this first lesson was anything to go off of, it seemed the clothes made the lord. But there had to be much more than outfits. Once the kettle was on, Draco dipped back through the beaded curtains to fetch teacups. He returned with a set of deep blue cups with silver rims. Little silver flecks speckled the surface like a night sky. Draco pressed one of the cups into Harry’s hands. A waft of lavender tickled his nose. He watched the blond slid into the chair beside him. Draco crossed his legs, hands folded on his knees, “Now, let’s go over when you think it’s appropriate to wear an outfit like this.”
Harry shrugged. That wasn’t exactly an agreement that he signed or anything. He mostly assumed it was Draco being dramatic, as usual, “Were you or were you not?” He repeated.
“It’s not a real window, but you can still smudge the glass by touching it,” Draco said in a tone that was almost gentle. Harry pulled his hand away, wrapping his arms around the top of his knees. His chin rested on the tops of his knees. Draco noted that Potter had wrapped his hand over message scrawled into his skin to hide it from him.
One of the other fifth years strode into the common room and dropped onto a squashy cushion across from Harry.
“And the Writ extends all the way to the Whomping Willow?” Harry asked before he could stop himself. The man stopped in his stirring for a moment. His cool gaze turned on Harry.
"I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about," Draco snickered. He led Harry into an alcove with a waist-high statue of something that resembled a garden gnome, pushing a tapestry aside to reveal the opening to a narrow staircase. Harry stopped short, eyes wide behind his glasses. After long hours staring at the Marauder's Map, he thought he knew most nooks and crannies around the castle. But this wasn't an opening he'd ever seen before, "Come on, then." Draco held out his hand for Harry again, beckoning him to follow. His smile softened, "Where's my courageous lion?" He coaxed Harry through the tapestry and down the narrow set of steps.
Harry nodded. He tossed a piece of popcorn at Draco. The other boy jumped back. It landed on the floor beside him. A smirk crawling across his lips, “Try that again.” Nodding, Harry lifted another piece of popcorn out of the bowl and tossed it to Draco. The blond caught it between his teeth, “Your turn. Open wide, Potter.”
Footwear was notoriously hard to transfigure, even Hermione struggled with shoes. Harry kicked a stone with the one trainer he had left. It ricocheted off the flagstones of one of the pathways and rolled until it smacked into someone's polished loafer. Wincing, Harry dragged his gaze off the ground to offer a rushed apology to the owner of the shoe. None other than Draco Malfoy.
“See you later for tree decorating.” She called over her shoulder. Harry fumed, losing his appetite. He abandoned the rest of his breakfast and stormed out of the hall.
“What’s the matter, Harry?” Draco asked. His finger’s held Harry’s chin from turning away, “You’re safe now. You can go back to Gryffindor.” Harry’s throat tightened. He nodded, not trusting his voice, “Or is that the problem?” Another nod. Draco dropped his hold on Harry’s chin, in favor of pulling the Gryffindor into a tight hug, “Just because your colors changed again, it doesn’t mean you’ve lost us. You’re one of us, now and forever.” Leaning forward, the blond’s lips brushed against Harry’s forehead. Right beside his scar.
“We’ll be fine. Won’t we, Potter?” Harry nodded. He slid back to the floor near the enchanted window, watching a hushed exchange between Draco and Snape. Their gazes flicked over to him. He stared out the enchanted window, the hairs on his neck prickling from their glances. The quidditch pitch scene spread back over the glass with the snitch flashing between the pennants. Footsteps tracked out of the room after several moments. Harry heard Draco huff softly, dropping back into one of the plush chairs. He summoned a book from one of the tables in a low voice, “Any of the books or games in the common room are for sharing, so help yourself. The others will start waking up in a little while.” Draco nodded back down the hallway toward the rooms.
Not giving up the act, his assailant snarled behind him. The fingers slid from Harry’s ears to rest on his shoulder blades, digging as deeply as he dared without truly hurting him.
He climbed through the entrance, only to be engulfed by a horde of Gryffindors calling his name. He smiled, endured pats on the back and ruffles of his hair and stepped around as many questions as he could. Even Ron and Hermione didn’t get it out of him later that night, no matter how much they pestered.
"Accio trainer," He cast in the direction of the bubbles. The water's placid surface roiled in streams of water. Tentacles flailed, but Harry's trainer did not return to his waiting grasp. Rubbing his temples beneath the frames of his glasses, Harry limped across the pebble beach and back toward the castle. He hoped Madam Malkins or Gladrags offered immediate owl orders from their catalogs. Otherwise, he was as sunk as his trainer until the shoes came in.
"Help, please," Potter mumbled out. Draco watched, his manicured brows rising, as the scarlet and gold vanished off of the boy's robes. The green and silver colors of Slytherin took their place. Both boys stared down at the robes for a fraction of a second until Harry's eyes glazed over and closed. He passed out cold on the floor. Biting his lip, Draco stole one last glance to the end of the hall before scooping his arms beneath Harry's and dragging him over the threshold into the Slytherin common room. His eyes caught a flash of pink tweed that made his hackles raise before the opening sealed behind them.
Harry opened his mouth, but the snitch bolted between them. The piece of popcorn flew across the room. He shook his head.
It made it easier to pretend he wasn’t there if he had something to keep his mind and hands engaged. Harry bit his lip. Between the rustle of the brush bristles, he could hear Draco humming under his breath. Something that didn't seem to bother the man at all. But Harry was sure this was a common occurrence for Draco to work here. In the blond's posture, he could see that Draco was the same Draco he was in his common room. Unapologetically himself with a smile straining the muscles in his narrow cheeks. The Slytherin reached his hand over toward Harry without looking up from his station. Harry paused in his work to squeeze the offered hand before both boys returned to their tasks.
“I, I apologize for earlier this morning. I assumed…” He trailed off, his grey eyes flicking toward the opening. Harry shook his head.
Harry craned his neck toward the snitch and the high ceiling above. Between the floating candles, a leafy sprig dangled down from the ceiling. He flushed. They were under the mistletoe. Before he could say anything, Draco pressed his lips against Harry’s. Harry stiffened, then melted in the blond’s embrace. He finally tugged back from Draco to catch his breath. Draco grinned, leaning forward to catch the snitch again. He handed it over to Harry, then the ball fell still. Its wings collapsed back inside itself.
Harry stirred, groaning he nestled deeper into the warmth. He jumped when the warm presence of the bed shifted beneath him. He fumbled for his glasses, pushed them onto his nose, and found himself staring at Draco Malfoy. The blond slept soundly with his aristocratic nose brushing up against Harry's. Soft blond hair tickled Harry's cheeks, the Gryffindor tucked the strands behind Draco's ears and out of the way. He didn't stir, even when Harry slid himself out of Draco's hold. His socked toes curled on the cool stone floor, shivering at the sudden chill that came from detaching himself from the Slytherin.
Theodore makes a startle noise. Draco grips his shirt and practically torn it apart, his hands moving in frenzy. There was an edge of despair on his moves—something urgent, that was rather unusual. He was always the one in control—the one with a sly remark, the one who plays around. Theo was usually the impatient one.
Except that, in a way, he had wanted it. He had wanted him dead, deep down. And despite what the others could say, Harry knew; there was something rotten inside of him, something dark and wicked that run through his blood like a curse.
Through the mirror, Theodore leans against his locker with a smile. “What did you do this time?” he asked, crossing his arms lazily. He was still half-naked from their frolic, his eyes wandering toward him with longing. “Did you fuck with him?”
“Why do you need him?” he asks, and Ron just shrugs like he didn’t care, putting his hands in his pockets. This night he was a vampire. Somehow, he could be a good one, but the blush that creep over his neck was just as relevant as shocking.
They crossed a living room in silence. Harry walks behind him, his eyes taking in every detail he could gather. The cane, he notes, wasn’t just there for fancy. Lucius Malfoy walks with a confidence that seemed natural, his step firm despite his limping. If anything, the limping adds some kind of aura around him, like an emperor.
“Hum?” He looks his plate like he had forgotten it was there, before shrugging. “Ah, no. I’m not really that hungry.”
Draco titled his head toward her, like he was intrigued, before blinking and turning his head toward him. “Harry Potter,” he repeated.
, for fuck’s sake. But it’s like a bug behind his head, tempting him the more the night goes on and –
Fortunately, Binns wasn’t there yet. With Pansy linked at his arms, he walks to the back and settle himself near the window. Pansy sat beside him, dropping her bag at the foot of the table. She then turned toward him, a grin on his face.
Potter at least hadn’t looked disgusted. Not that it matters. He had dealt with judgement most of his life, and at some point, he just didn’t bother anymore.
Potter grabs the two threads at the end. He pulls it abruptly, and a little whimper left him as he stumbles backward. His back collides with the man chest, and when he looks up—what a sigh he was showing, really. With his lips part and his red cheeks, he was like a bitch in heat, and this was so strange to him that he looks away.
His breath will catch his ear, hot and wet, and Draco would moan, shivering, somehow embarrassed but so incredibly turn on.
The Malfoy’s house was located in one of the upscale neighbourhoods in Wiltshire, standing proudly in the dream light of spring, glorious like the name it wore.
Harry groans, deep in his chest, and Draco began to move. It was slow at first, and with each movement he whimpers, his hands shaking on his shoulder.
Draco hums, and places his body against him. Harry slides his finger in his hair gently. They were really like silk.
For a moment, the weight against him distracted him. Malfoy was skinnier than him, and his waist was perfect in his hand. Like he should be.
“Yeah mate,” Ron adds, chewing whatever was on the table. The pointed canines of his disguise were showing at each movement. “Plus, it looks good on him.”
It was nice to be able to relax this way. Even if they did know each other since they were practically babies, this kind of moment became rare with time. Lady Parkinson didn’t like him very much to begin with, and since he gained his reputation, she was all the more against her daughter spending time with him. He knew Pansy argued a lot with her mother because of that; she may have many flaws, but loyalty was one of her strong points. Draco wouldn’t admit to her, but he was grateful that she was always ready to stand for him, even if it was against her own parents.
“He’s beautiful, isn’t he?” the blond said suddenly. “A really pretty boy. It almost doesn’t seem real. Must have taken it from his mother.”
Lucius didn’t respond. His face carefully neutral, he snaps his fingers and a gloomy elf appears immediately, bowing deeply beside him.
“I know you think I’m like him. Everyone does. They all just assumed that because he a bad person, then I’m a bad person too. And I know you’re not different.”
Lucius leans back in his chair. His gaze was calculating, but Harry couldn’t read his face. They didn’t speak, staring at each other in the tensed silence until Winky reappears with a tray.
“Yeah, an arsehole who knows how to suck a dick. That’s all that matters for me” he pointed out. From the corner of his eye, he saw her open her mouth, probably to argue back.
Harry holds out his package and Ron took one with a grateful nod. The brunette watched him as he lights up the cig, taking a long puff before resuming his monologue.
“Don’t overstate it.” He flopped on in stomach and crossed his arms. “I didn’t get the chance with Flint yet.”
Draco pointed Pansy. “She came with it,” he said with a pout. Like a child, Harry thought. Which he was, all think considering.
Harry stood up and held out his hand toward him. The boy raised and eyebrow, peering at him. “Nice to meet you.”
, but they weren’t enemies either. Malfoy seems to be trying to avoid him, and the rare moment they did face each other, they were at least cordial, he presumed—a bit awkward yes, but cordial. And, really, given their history, it was a miracle.
Draco blinks, and then he feels his lungs burns, as well as his throat. His voice was still rigging in his ears, already a distant memory, but for a few seconds, he could still see these endless holes staring into his soul like a collapsar.
“Oh Merlin,” Malfoy moans and squirm and arches, and Harry dives further, just a little, and then he dives his tongue inside him.
Draco cleared his throat and Harry looked toward him. The boy seemed uneasy, shifting his legs and playing with his ponytail.
“First of all, shut up. Neville’s pretty decent, fuck you very much” she said harshly – and Draco rolled his eyes because really, what does she found in him anyway? Longbottom was so
Somehow, he manages to drag himself off the bed. With slow movements, he got inside the bathroom and closed the door behind him. Like he had tough, his reflection was horrifying; his hair was a mess and his eyes were so red they seemed to have some burst veins. He sighs, and shuffling pathetically, he made his move toward the bathtub.
