Malfoy stands still. Gun in one hand, magazine in the other. Harry can sense his indecision. Malfoy thrusts the magazine in.
Harry Accios the lube. He gets up and pushes down his trousers and pants, looking down at his almost fully erect cock. He sits back again, leaning into the couch. His hand finds his arse. He pulls apart his arsecheecks, his finger feeling for his hole. It feels puckered and inviting. Harry lathers his finger in lube and searches for the hole again. Gently he pushes in.
Harry looks intensely at him. ‘Are you alright?’
‘Oh dearie, I used to have a cousin that had just the same. She got over it during the Big Black Out in New York. She was stuck in an elevator for hours with a famous psychologist, who made her count backwards from 1000 and had her distinguish her keys in her pocket by touch alone. He said distraction was the key. It worked like a charm.’
and the wand movement looks like this,” Harry demonstrated “but that’s not the most important part. For the charm to work, you need to focus as hard as you can on your happiest memory. If you’re not thinking of something happy it’ll never work. All together it looks like this,”
“You don’t own dress socks!”
“Are you alright?” Draco asked Harry quietly as they stood
“He’s sitting right around the corner, send a house-elf if there is any problem.”
“And you’re sure you want to  give up the spot?” Harry responded
He spent the evening writing various memos to his students and enchanting them to appear in all the dorms the moment a student had woken up, he needed the other students to know that Mr. Potter was there and what the expectations were before one of them ran into him. Snape also spent a few hours arguing with the Headmaster and Professor McGonagall about Harry’s new placement. It was tedious, but he felt that the pair of them were starting to understand that this wasn’t going to be undone - even though they were not happy about it.
nastier"
’ turned out to be something of an understatement, Harry felt the same pain spread through his hand as he had the night of his detention. He winced and drew in a sharp intake of breath the moment that it started. Professor Snape - who had been watching every move all of the examiners made - quickly made his way around the table so he could see Harry face-to-face.
“Mr. Potter,” Snape started when they were alone, “This is an important matter and I expect your honesty, you will not be in any trouble so long as you are honest with me.”
“Fine, he just told me not to make a habit out of it.” and Harry began to make a plate that had enough food on it to please Madame Pomfrey.
“Thank you, Sir,” Harry replied while both he and  Draco plastered wide smiles to their faces.
“Th-thank you.” Harry flushed as he spoke and Draco smiled widely in response. Everyone sat silently for a few moments as Harry’s breath began to even out under the comfort of the weighted blanket.
“Severus,
“Well?” Sirius questioned, gasping; as he was out of breath, “What has he said?”
“You haven’t ruined anything, and I meant what I said when I told you that I would always be here to talk about whatever you needed. If you need to get something out, I’ll listen.” Draco softly gazed at Harry and his yearning intensified.
He quickly made his way to the doorway of his classroom and was unsurprised to find the room filled with chatter and the occasional random object flying around.
“You are not in a position to make demands Severus, or did you forget how you came into this job.” Dumbledores tone still had all of Harry’s senses on high alert, like he was taking in a thousand things every second and processing them all at once.
“Harry, do you want me to sit with you?” Draco questioned, guessing what was wrong, Harry wasn’t sure how he was going to react but he wanted to be close to him again. Draco took the lead hoping he could get some of the stress of Harry.
Harry didn’t stay up analyzing the nights’ events as Draco had, he fell asleep quickly. Harry was especially grateful for this when the nightmares hit around 2:30 that morning.
“No, it’s only me and Pans and Snape. That’s it.” Draco let out a sigh, but Harry didn’t respond. He was muttering something under his breath through the trembling and the crying; Draco couldn’t make out what he was saying, he was being to feel entirely useless when he saw Pansy and Snape enter the classroom.
Draco grabbed Harry’s hand under the table and gave it an encouraging squeeze where no one could see it. Harry didn’t have time to analyze how Dracos’s simple touch made his heart flutter, at least not this moment, so he stored that information away to be dealt with later as he steadied himself in anticipation.
“Malfoy,” Sirius repeated with a tone neither of the young wizards could decipher
Draco spoke so kindly and Harry was shocked, what had he done to deserve this kindness. For a moment he wondered what he would be expected to do in return but Draco’s voice rang through his head
“Harry, I think it would be best if you gave everyone some space,” Neville spoke quietly but his voice was harsh.
Severus, as expected had stayed up all night. He changed his robes, fixed his hair, and grabbed a vile of pepper up from his personal potions storage before leaving to take Harry Potter up to the hospital wing.
“Your room Mr. Potter” Snape pointed at a door with three names on it, he grabbed his wand and added a third plack that read ‘Harry J. Potter’ “Do try and get some rest, and don’t forget an awakening charm for the morning.”
“My final order of business, unless you have any questions is that you will be needed a full medical exam done within the next 24hours, it is mandated by the magic that brought you here. I would offer to take you now but you are clearly in need of some sleep so we can either go before breakfast in the morning or during a free period you have in your schedule tomorrow afternoon. Which would you prefer?” The professor asked.
Harry felt a tear building up in the center of his eye as Draco spoke, but it didn’t make it far because when it fell Draco reached up and wiped it away. Harry looked to Draco, he was so touch-starved and so emotionally drained Harry had been longing for someone to hug him or hold him since his interaction with Neville on the train and suddenly he very much wanted that someone to be Draco.
“Uncle Vernon has a sister Marge, I always had to call her Aunt Marge as a kid but there’s no relation, probably for the best she hates me just as much as they do. Whenever she visits it’s always the worst, I always end up getting punished loads more. She doesn’t stay for visits anymore though, she came the summer after 2nd year and I accidentally inflated her.” Harry was trying to lighten the mood
The Slytherin sighed. “Sorry, that was rude. I'm just not used to actually having a civilized conversation with ‘Chosen one’ Potter. Normally we just hex each other.”
“Mal--” he paused, looking uncertain for a second before his features softened and instead said, ”Draco…” Draco searched his emerald gaze, looking for any judgement or ill-intent. But he found none, instead seeing concern and a gentleness Draco had not been on the receiving end of for a very long time.
Chapter 2 - Peel The Burn
“I'm afraid that doesn’t concern you, Potter,” he responded, a little bit of humor creeping into his voice uninvited. Draco had to admit to himself, it was nice having someone around who isn’t plotting the rise of the Dark Lord or telling him to be a better Malfoy.
Harry watched Draco’s eyes widen a bit and he pulled away a bit. Had he said something wrong?
Welp... that makes hating him much, much harder.
“Fine,” muttered Draco as a fresh aftershock of pain rippled through his body.
Malfoy just nodded, trying to cover up his discomfort. We’re in the same boat, then, Harry thinks before getting closer with the clean rags, bringing the bason closer. He took a deep breath.
Malfoy’s beautiful eyes caught his once again. Harry couldn't get over how they went so deep with so many different shades, the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen, he thought to himself.
Draco clenched his teeth as he attempted to pull himself off of the floor, his now bruised arms shaking in the effort. There is a lot of blood on him, a bit coming from his nose and mouth and a good flow from the back of his head where it slammed against the hard earth. He is nearly in a seated position when he hears the whoosh of a cloak, the sound startling him and making his arms give out on him.
“Are you ready to go, then?” Harry asked, obviously trying to cover up his startle.
Potter’s mouth opens and closes, emotions battling each other in his eyes. It confuses Draco. Was that concern in Potter’s eyes?
that made him jump and nearly drop the apple.
His father gave him one last look that shot another jolt of fear into Draco before he disapperated with another
It only lasted a few seconds, but immediately his vision tunneled and his head cracked against the ground as his limbs gave out on him, spasming on the ground as pain shot through him. The curse ended and he was left moaning and shaking on the ground, his father looking unforgivingly down at him.
Harry had fallen silent and Draco suddenly found that he couldn’t continue to rant on and pretend that it wasn’t the Boy Who Lived who was cleaning his wounds and looking at his scars.
“Fine, Potter. But don’t you dare think that this changes anything,” he bit out. “I don’t need your help and don’t you forget it. This is a one time ordeal. I can’t deal with your need to feel like you are a part of every little thing that happens at Hogwarts. You and your House’s insufferable knack for chivalry is practically unbearable--”
After scanning the trees for what he was looking for, he strode forward and reached out to a low hanging fruit. The Darkest Apple. It is a purple-black with small ridges that made it look like something had crawled across it and left behind a shallow path. Within this piece of fruit holds a poison that, when used correctly could silently kill someone from within.
I can do it, he thinks to himself as he draws himself up to his full height and nods at Harry.
“Alright… let’s go,” Harry says uncertainly, as if Draco would topple any second. Draco immediately wants to prove that he can walk himself, that he doesn’t need that pitying look and snatches the invisibility cloak from Harry’s arms. And maybe he wants to prove it to himself.
“Just let me help you Malfoy, and then we can pretend this never happened,” Potter said. Draco’s lip curled. The image of Potter and his stupid glasses helping him made him want to hurl. He opened his mouth to tell him exactly what he thought of that idea when he noticed the look on Potter’s face.
He looked around the relatively small room quickly, noting the plush looking couch near a lit fireplace and the table in front of it containing non-magical medical supplies. Malfoy took off the cloak and Harry’s eyes went back to the wounded wizard, wincing slightly at the shape the usually proud boy usually was.
Harry fiddled with the supplies, laying them out on the table to give Malfoy a bit more time to situate himself before finally looking up and approaching him, the ointment in hand.
He looked at Harry, and he took in every part of him. The tangled mess of hair that made him look like had just rolled out of bed. The way his glasses rested on the bridge of his nose just so. And the plump lips that he had been wanting to kiss for the past year.
“Look, Draco.” Draco blinked and drew back slightly at hearing Harry use his first name for the first time since they had met all the way back during first year. “I-I don’t know how to fix anything more than this.We need to get you some place that we can get some help.”
It looked like genuine concern. Concern for him.
“Sorry…” Potter muttered.
“What in the world are you doing, Mal--”
I hope you enjoy! This Drarry fic will probably end up being five-ish chapters long :D
Turning around abruptly, he took a bite out of the apple he had been carrying and walked swiftly away. Harry would have turned as well and gone to find Ron and Hermione, but he noticed those blue eyes darting back and forth. If Malfoy’s actions hadn’t been suspicious before, they definitely were now.
“How are you here?!” Draco yelped before he regained his composure. Standing straighter to cover up his fumble, he said “It's impossible to apparate into Hogwarts.”
“I have my ways” Lucius responded with a powerful glare down his hooked nose that Draco wanted to flinch at.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You have no idea how long I've waited for this, Potter,” Draco murmured. He felt Harry laugh and Draco sat up to look at the beautiful boy sitting in front of him, love in his eyes.
Draco watched wearily as Harry soaked a rag in the water and rang it out, the water trickling into the bowl and making the silence even more awkward. Then he turned and grabbed Draco’s arm gently, unbuttoning the cuff and slowly pulling up the stained and torn white sleeve to reveal a deep gash on his arm.
In the few glances he takes around the orchard he sees pinks and blues, sparkles and warts, huge apples the sizes of watermelons and small apples the size of large berries.
Harry startled. “What?”
He looked around at the orchard filled with apples of all varieties, shapes, textures, tastes, and purposes hanging on the branches above. It really was quite impressive. All of it, hidden right beneath that buffoon Dumbledore’s nose.
“Now, Draco. I
Malfoy snapped his head up. “I have other things to do than just flying around on a broom all day, Potter.”
Draco startled, his eyes darting quickly to look at his shirt before glaring at Potter. “Is that really necessary?” he bit out maybe a little too harshly, unconsciously pulling his left arm off of his lap and pressing it into his side.
The sound of a throat being cleared called Harry back to attention.
Being a cancer, Harry found it hard to wipe the hurt from his face before Malfoy could see it.
“The, um, Room provided some ointment. There aren’t any instructions or anything, but I think I’ll just clean it up then apply some of this medicine so it doesn't get infected?”
Malfoy is acting suspicious again. Harry can't help himself and follows the pureblood and discovers one of his secrets.
The thought being shirtless in Potter’s presence made his stomach flip, and he feared a blush was creeping up to his cheeks. Stop it, he scolded himself. There was no reason to think that way.
“What do you want, Potter?” the blonde drawled.
Instead he just reached out and lightly touched Harry on the arm where he had touched before and kept it there. But instead of flinching away like Draco half expected him to, Harry just nodded and walked at the pase Draco set, looking like the most casual person in the world at the slow pace.
Draco allows Potter to follow him into the secret orchard. But what Draco doesn't expect is to see his father.
Draco took a deep breath, readying himself for this before he began to head into the Room.
“Anyways,” Malfoy tilted his head at Potter’s staring, his brows furrowing. “I need to get back to what I was doing.”
The door would disappear from the outside, leaving him and Malfoy all the time in the world to sit in this room. Together. After Malfoy had just been tortured by his own father. Quite honestly, Harry’s mind was still reeling in shock from the series of events that had just taken place only, what,  ten minutes ago?
He wiped this thought from his head. Why was he thinking like this? Malfoy is arch nemesis! The person who he is supposed to hate! He was quite handsome, though, Harry would admit. Tall. Slender. No wonder the girls were all over him.
“Um,” Draco called, causing Harry to stop and turn at Draco’s voice in a different spot than he had thought. “Maybe it would be best if I…” Draco didn’t want to put it into words. It sounded too.. Odd.
“I need to look at your chest. Could you...um...” Potter trailed off, instead gesturing his hand at Draco’s stained shirt.
Harry had never seen anything like it. Not even his own family the Dursleys had ever treated him this way. Shoved in a closet, deprived of food; sure. But physically tortured? Not even Uncle Vernon had lowered to that level. But Harry had to admit,  Malfoy didn’t seem like he wanted to be a death eater, instead being forced into service of Voldemort by his father.
“Am I hurting you?”
“And how exactly do you expect both of us to fit under there?” Draco bites out, trying his best to hide his sudden… fear? Attraction?
“Potter?”
Harry was in the hallways surrounding the courtyard, brooding as he does on a regular basis, when he saw Malfoy, walking around and being suspicious as ever. He stood up and made his way swiftly over towards his arch nemesis. Malfoy turned his head.
If it were any other day, Draco would have never hesitated to call him Golden Boy Potter from across the courtyard, but he held his tongue.
Looking behind his shoulder, he saw that Potter was still there.
Without thinking, Draco nodded his head sharply. If he responded incorrectly he would be severely punished.
Suddenly his breathing picked up and he found Harry had shifted so that his leg was now touching Draco’s.
Harry pushed open the door and listened for the light footfalls of the now invisible Malfoy that had been following him through the castle and to the front of the Room of Requirement to pass by him and into the waiting room before closing it once more.
Draco looked Harry over and raised an eyebrow. “Enjoying the show?” Harry looks up and finds defensiveness in his ice blue eyes.
Harry’s eyes widened before he could finish the sentence and his jaw dropped to the floor. In the blink of an eye, past an invisible barrier, everything around the apple core changed. Before him, the scrawny tree that had once been right in front of him had morphed a field of apple trees of all varieties, shapes, colors, and sizes.
“He bought me my first broom, this tiny little thing barely flew 2 feet up but I used to ride it around the house when my father wasn’t around. I always brought it with me to Uncle Sev’s, he hates me flying now though he thinks it’s reckless and too dangerous for its worth he can’t get too mad though considering he started the habit in the first place.” Draco and Harry both laughed at the story,
Hey I'm like so so so sorry that I just disappeared for a while. My mental health took a deep dive into shit and I had to have surgery so it got pretty chaotic. Also my computer is broken so I finished and edited this on my phone, it may not be as good as usual but ill probaly go back and fix it. I hope everyone's doing okay and you all enjoy this chapter
This is how Severus found the pair nearly an hour later, Draco was staring into Harry’s jet black hair while mindlessly drawing shapes on his back and Harry had drifted into a light sleep with tear stains on his checks.
“Bloody course you’re still playing Potter, you could give us a shot to win back that House Cup you always manage to steal away. Come on, let’s get this rubbish class out of the way.” Draco joked
And as quickly as they had appeared the twins were gone.
“I’m going to ask for my old job back. It may be a long shot but I have to be better than a woman torturing students. If I can be there, maybe I can get a better idea of what he has going on. It doesn’t make sense Sirius but more and more things keep coming up: the blocked letters, breaking confidentiality, begging you to do his bidding and not telling you why, and now he waited over a week to take action - he had grounds to call for temporary arrest the second Harry spoke up. Why didn’t he?”
“Thank you, Sir. for explaining and for being my magical guardian tomorrow. It means a lot to me.”
The boys headed off, up the stairs and to charms - luckily for everyone the Slytherins had charms with the Hufflepuffs this year, Harry wasn’t sure if anyone would survive another Slytherin/Gryffindor encounter at the moment.
Wishing everyone a Happy Holidays - if you celebrate Christmas Happy Christmas Eve - and if you don't celebrate Christmas I hope your holiday season has kept you Happy and Healthy.
“Professor, do I have to go back and get my things?” Snape was thankful the boy had asked something he could answer.
cw: Umbridge being Umbridge, some mild language (which will be showing up more frequently and I will probably not put cw for again)
“Oh, I’m not sure - doesn’t sound like something Aunt Petunia would have done, with Dudley maybe, but definitely not with me. So I guess I can’t actually remember but it sounds like something my mum or dad would have done before they died.” Harry sighed as that longing feeling he got when he imagined his parents washed over him.
“Of course,”
“N-no, no it’s alright Draco can stay.” Harry took another stabilizing breath and Draco reached for his hand under the table like he had when Ron approached them during the last potions lesson.
When they were dismissed from class everyone made their way to the great hall for lunch, relishing in the fact that the rest of the afternoon was free sailing. Snape and Flitwick had given homework but Harry was confident he could complete all his work in an hour so he wasn’t in a rush to get started.
My apologies Severus but it seems this is not at all a joke and that Hogwarts core magic has been activated. This is particularly odd seeing as the core has been inactive for nearly 800 years and the last time this replacement action was used was in 1429. Minerva and I have been searching for a way to reverse this, you know how important it is we keep Mr. Potter out of Slytherin. Once you’ve given the boy a room for the evening please come by. The new password is “Cat Scratch”
And at that moment Snape strode into the classroom, It took him a fraction of a second in the classroom before he intervened.
“Plus, I’m sure you’ve got better marks in defense than most of the house - so we’ll expect you to return the favor,” Draco added
“This defense homework is absolute rubbish. How can she expect us to write essays on the Patronus Charm when we’ve never even seen one cast? Bloody textbook diagrams aren’t any good.” Draco complained once everyone had gone back to finishing up the weekend assignments.
I'm posting the first 2 at one time because they're shorter and I wanted all the set up out there. The next chapter should be out on Monday!
Padfoot managed to get out another growl through Sirius and this time Remus had no objections.
“Your fault! Your fault! Your fault!” The nine Weasleys stood, their eyes still lifeless but their mouths and bodies were moving. Chanting louder as they approached.
“Why do you do that, apologize just because we’ve treated you with some basic decency?” Draco’s voice was soft and calm and it made Harry feel oddly safe ...and wasn’t that something, Draco Malfoy making Harry feel safe a month ago he wouldn’t have believed it but everything just felt so right.
“She hasn’t been removed from the castle yet?” Remus asked, absolutely appalled that she was still teaching after torturing a student in detention
, that no one has ever fought with someone so powerful so many times. Harry, you are the only person in existence to survive a killing curse - we’ve got no idea the kind of lasting effects that might have. What if
Harry was grateful that he hadn’t tried sneaking out when he heard the Dursleys return less than an hour later. He just had to make it until this evening - then he could get out of this bloody room.
Pansy smiled at Dracos words, but couldn’t help the remark that popped into her mind.
“That’s not a problem dear, I can’t imagine trying to keep count of lines while enduring so much pain. Now, this part may sting a bit as I remove the magical trace.”
“Welcome home, Harry.” Draco outstretched a hand and bowed his head slightly. It was awkward, but Harry remembered what Snape had told him and took the invitation for a handshake, when Malfoy looked back up Harry spoke.
“Funny how that did not seem to be a concern of yours when the boy was in your house. As it is Mr. Potter has been doing exceptionally well in Slytherin, he is adjusting just fine, making friends, and getting ready to join our quidditch team.” Snape spoke with a snark typically reserved for students who he had just caught making trouble.
“Harry it’s Draco, no one is going to hurt you. You’re at Hogwarts and you’re safe. Please breathe love, you’re going to make yourself sick. “ Draco thought maybe he was getting through because the begged stopped even if the hiding and crying hadn’t.
"Draco he hid it well, I never even suspected and you know how well I can pick it out. I saw it in you and that girl from Ravenclaw. Harry didn't want anyone to know, I wager ever Granger and Weasley don't know." she spoke
“That’s all we needed from you Mr. Potter, unless you have any questions." They both assured her that they didn't, "Then the  two of you are free to go. The board of governors will have decided before they leave for the night - they hate having to reconvene the next day.  The legal case may take a bit longer but I predict it will be quite straightforward, either way, you’ll receive an owl with the final decision in no more than 48 hours.” Madam Bones kept her professional look on her face but her voice was so kind Harry noted once again how lucky he was to have seen her instead of the whole Wizengmot.
“Of course I do, but if Snape was worried about Harry’s appearance he would have told him to get new robes. You have put together a beautiful set that he will look stunning in so there’s nothing to worried about. Plus, it’s so fun to watch you come
“It’s what we’re here for Potter, we look out for each other, we’re a family and you can share whatever you need with us and we’ll listen. Tonight, however, it is late, and we have classes tomorrow, so I’m going to give you a quick rundown of some other house expectations, and then we can all get some sleep. In the morning we can get you fully adjusted.” The blonde paused but when there was nothing said he continued.
Neville had said that some people just needed time, he made it sound like maybe one day things would be okay again. Harry knew that wasn’t true, he had screwed up so bad that he lost everything. His house turned on him, the people who were supposed to be his family, the ones that should care for him, have finally had enough of the boy who lived.
“He would w-wake me up, and he would yell a lot, and sometimes he threw stuff.” that wasn’t a lie, he just didn’t mention how he would be woken up by being shoved out of bed and kicked until his stomach was black and blue or how he would wake to the sound of his uncle’s smeltings cane whistling through the air before he felt it make contact with his skin.
He watched the first years get sorted paying little attention until Dumbledore introduced the new defense professor, Dolores Umbridge, she worked for the ministry and Harry got a feeling the two of them were not going to get along.
on time, woudla believed it
“I know a spot. I found it by accident last year, but it’s brilliant!” Pansy exclaimed
“Mr. Potter is a student under my care, as he has no magical guardian you should know it’s customary for me to stand in as one in any meetings regarding magical affairs with the Headmaster - or have I miss understood that part of Hogwart’s school handbook.” Albus Dumbledore kept a completely calm face as the potions master spoke, which Harry found remarkable because the words hadn’t even been directed at him and a shiver flew down his spine.
“I don’t understand, my best friends need some space from me. Neville let me talk to Ron and Hermione, I don’t think they’ve been getting my letters this summer.” Harry demanded
yet, but right I guess. It feels like I’m meant to be here.” Harry shuddered out and he was worried the others would start laughing at him, but no one did. Instead, he was meet with very encouraging responses.
Harry was a little confused by the friendliness that had been shown to him in this last hour, not only by Professor Snape but now Draco Malfoy. The pair shook hands and greeted each other with their first names, something that hadn’t happened since they met in Madam Malkins.
“As someone in my position, I am here to make sure all the students in my house are safe and well. Mr. Potter is not right now so I plan on fulfilling my duty and seeing to it that he is cared for. Good day,  Albus, come on Harry we’re running late.” Snape outstretched his arm to lead Harry from the office. Harry took his arm in hand eagerly, he felt like his body was moving on auto-pilot and the anxiety inside him kept growing.
“Alright, let’s just get it over with…”
Harry made breakfast, cleaned up, and brought uncle Vernon the mail.
“Brillant Harry, somehow you managed to get Lily’s brain and James’s agility...absolutely brilliant.” Sirius smiled with pride
(See the end of the chapter for
“I, hel-help...p-please.” Harry shuddered out while keeping his head down low.
“Madame Pomfrey” Severus spoke as they entered the hospital, “I’m sure you have heard that some very powerful magic was activated last night and per the request of that magic Mr. Potter needs a general medical exam.” Snape bowed lightly in thanks as the medi-witch entered.
“Harry, I’ve just had a meeting with Professor Dumbledore,” Snape spoke as soon as Harry was seated.
“Bollocks.” Pansy nearly shouted
“There are a few other matters we need to discuss, your roommates will go over some other house rules we have but so long as you keep the first in mind you will do just fine here. Professors Dumbledore and McGonagall are meeting this evening, they seem to believe they can undo this but I am certain that it is not possible. I only mention this so if you are confronted by either of them you will be prepared - I will be speaking to them tonight to try and prevent such an encounter from happening but I’m afraid I may only be able to do so much and again if either of them or anyone else for that matter, give you a hard time you can bring your problem to me and it will be handled. You’re one of mine now Mr. Potter and I take care of all my snakes.” That comments drew a small smile to Harry’s face for the first time in weeks.
“How about you just show all of us…”
“Thank you, Albus. Now, Harry, this might be a bit uncomfortable but can you tell me what happened in class to warrant the detention?”
Draco was secretly thrilled that Harry was in his house now, ever since he was a child Draco imagined being friends with “The Boy Who Lived” but after that day in the robe shop, he knew that Harry was special. Draco realized he was gay the summer before 3rd year, but the only people who knew were Pansy and Blaise - it was going to be much more difficult to hide now that the man he was falling for slept in the next bed over.
“Your mother most certainly would have done that and so much more for you Mr. Potter. Lily Evans was one of the greatest women I have ever known, and now you have people who will help you as she would have. Do not hide from us Harry, if you have a problem you can come to me, and I’ve seen how close you’re becoming with Mr. Malfoy and his companions they will look out for you too and not just from trouble out in the castle, but for your emotional needs as well - lots of them know how it feels to suffer in such a way first hand and they would not be apt to leave a friend to suffer that fate alone. Do you understand?” Snape felt like a broken record telling this boy that he would be cared for now but he vowed to himself that he would keep saying it until Harry believed him.
“Well, then it’s settled we are officially friends,” Draco bowed his head and outstretched his arm, Harry chuckled but reached out to grab Draco’s arm.
“Harry doll, let’s go back to the common room.” Draco held out his hand for Harry to grab
“We need to talk to Harry Pads, we don’t know anything about what happened. You said it yourself Harry is what’s most important. Let’s wait and see what he has to say, and when we get home later and you have all the outbursts you’d like.” Remus led them both back to the bench he had just abandoned and he pulled Sirius into his side protectively as they waited.
Harry cried himself to sleep that night, he knew that now the rest of his time here would be nearly as bad as it was at the Dursleys. He was given a chance and he ruined it. Sure, here Harry could eat whenever he wanted and he wouldn’t be beaten or locked away, but still, Harry wasn’t sure if he could live through three years of this, which was the last thought he had before getting pulled into sleep.
“You have nothing to apologize for Harry, not a single thing. Do you understand that none of this is your fault? We know you didn’t ask for any of this, I can see how good for you it is. If you’re being taken care of in Slytherin I think you’re exactly where you belong.” Remus cut Harry off and drew in both boy’s attention
Dumbledore completely ignored the older man and turned his attention back to Harry, speaking with more urgency, “That may not be true Harry, as I said this is ancient magic and we don’t fully understand how it works. I have been working to find a way to get you back in Gryffindor where you belong.”
Sirius was lost in a story about the first student who activated Salzars magic when Remus returned home. He learned that it was 1478 and the student was a third-year Hufflepuff girl who got re-sorted into Ravenclaw. She was the only student to ever be removed from Hufflepuff; in the many years between her re-sorting and Harrys, every other student who woke this magic had been sorted into Hufflepuff. Sirius had just started reading about the known circumstances of the girls resorting when Remus found him.
“Mr. Rackharrow, a word.” the professor spoke as soon as he located the student before reentering his office and leaving the door agape behind him.
“Very good Harry, I’m going to stand up and walk around you. I’ll place the blanket over your shoulders and if you need - I’ll help you pull it around your torso and onto your lap. Is that alright?” Snape spoke clearly but kept his soft tone; he explained every action he was going to take so that nothing caught Harry by surprise.
Uncle Sev was one of the best things in my childhood. When I was really little my parents went away for 2 weeks one summer and I stayed with him while they were gone. I had such a great time they sent me there every year, even if they weren’t going away. This past summer was the first time I can remember not spending any time at Spinners End.” Draco sighed a little as he realized he might not get to spend another summer with his godfather; now that the Dark Lord was back Lucius was worse than ever. Harry noticed that his friend was dealing with something so he let the moment of silence sink in before and didn’t say anything until Draco continued,
As the food appeared in front of him filling the golden dishes Harry had no interest in eating it. He was sitting by himself in a room full of people celebrating together. So he stood and snuck out of the Great Hall, he wasn’t ready to go to the Gryffindor tower yet. The new Prefects had come around and given him the new password ‘dragon snot’ while he was on the train but he didn’t want to use it.
“Please, Please, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, please don’t hurt me.” Harry cried as he begged -  Draco allowed himself no more than 3 seconds to be overwhelmed,
“Oh my god, he wants to see me. He wants me to meet him at the shrieking shack on Saturday. He’s worried about me.” Harry spoke in awe only loud enough for Draco and Pansy to hear.
Harry was getting ready to come up with some lie when he remembered what Pansy had said, maybe if there were other people like him here than he could be honest. He wanted to get closer with Draco, and this could be a start.
While Harry was in detention a lot of the Slytherins had settled many were already tucked away into their dorms but a few still occupied the common room, which is where Draco and Pansy were sitting on the large couch near the fire pit and catching up. They talked about the summer break, and the intimate horrors of their homes lives that no one else knew of, they talked about classes, and Pansy somehow already had drama to share with Draco.
“Leave it to our Potions Master to be ever prepared.” Both of the Slytherin boys held back the urge to dramatically roll their eyes as Dumbledore stood and wandered over to them, “now if you’ll excuse me, I have to meet with the governors downstairs.” and with that, the old man was gone.
“Albus, what do you need for Harry to do for this action to take place.” Snape still didn’t understand why his student had to be present for this, nothing had come up that he and Albus couldn’t discuss in private.
“It’s not just the Weasley family, Harry there are a lot of people in our house that are upset about what happened in the maze. So you should just stick to yourself until you can sort out whos on your side. I wish things could be like they were before Harry, but for now, at least, things are going to be very different around here. A lot of us don’t think we can trust you, you’re clearly looking out for yourself first.  You have to accept that.” and without another word Neville went back into the compartment and closed the door, leaving Harry alone again.
“You’re feeling better Harry?” Pansy asked once Snape was gone
“Oh, come here Harry.” Sirius pulled him into another great hug, “keep writing Harry, we’ve got an owl now so there won’t be any more problems. I want to know how things are going with you, quidditch, and classes, and anything else you want to talk about. I’m here for you Prongslet. Whenever you need.”
They worked until some fourth years came through the common room informing them it was dinner time, they packed up their things and started to walk up to the great hall. As Harry, Draco, Theo, and Blaise walked past the potions classroom in the dungeons Professor Snape called Harry in.
Harry blinked in confusion when he saw his professor was holding out another potion vial but he took it without asking any questions. As soon as the liquid hit his lips Harry knew it was a pain reliever - after spending so much time in the hospital wing he was very familiar with the rotten taste. He grimaced as he swallowed it but was relieved when the lingering pain in his hand disappeared.
“Professor, we don’t need to file a report. I didn’t mean to cause all this trouble.” Harry desperately wanted this to be over, he just wanted to lay in his bed and block out the pain and try to avoid another detention. Frankly, Harry was getting sick of always being at the center of things, he wanted to float in the background and avoid the public eye even if it was just for a year.
Snape opened the doors and the three students followed him in,
Snape walked away from the other professor’s gasps and made his way to the Slytherin student table and located Harry Potter.
“The powdered porcupine quills?” Draco inquired once the potion was the desired shade of orange Harry sprinkled the quills into the center of the cauldron as Draco switched directions and started stirring clock-wise. The color changed one last time into a pearly white.
Harry hums an affirmative. Draco smiles, mostly because he can smell Harry before he feels him. His senses have been ratcheted up of late, which is a double-edged sword if anything, but it’s always nice to be able to tell when Harry is coming a little sooner than usual. Warm hands smooth over his upper back, and a kiss is pressed onto the back of his neck.
"I need you." Draco says.
Draco blinks at him. Then he smiles and steals another kiss. Harry tastes of pesto sauce and it’s never been better. “I’ll think about it.”
Harry kisses him soundly on the lips. “You already are.”
“I remember,” Pansy says, eyes bright with amusement. “Your Father is the one who would walk around begging people to speak Czech with him at the Board of Governors’ private gatherings.”
Anyways, I finished this chapter earlier than I thought I would, so I figured an early update would make up for my erratic writing schedule. I'm in the home stretch of what has been a
“Do I drink it before or after?” Harry asks, taking it into his hand.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Please, Daddy, again?” Draco pants.
Draco flushes happily, resting his hand on his stomach with a proud smile. “A little better.”
When Draco’s close enough, Harry cradles his hips and then kisses his stomach before pressing his face into it, breathing in deeply. Draco strokes his hair, and then lowers his hands to massage his shoulders.
Hermione shakes her head, looking down at the table. “I’m sorry, I’m not being fair. I guess I was more cross than I realized, too.”
“Honestly, Ron,” Hermione hisses, taking after him with her hands curled into her dress.
“Mmm-hmm,” Draco hums.
Dad’s brows rise. “I know you are, but what am I?”
She asks Kreacher if he’ll accompany her, knowing how much he likes to visit his old home, and he agrees with a grumbly, “If it please the Little Miss,” and before long she’s holding his hand and waving goodbye to her family before they step through the Floo. She catches Grandfather’s tight frown just before they end up on the other side in Grimmauld Place, with Aunt Andromeda standing there by the fireplace, her hands on her hips.
“You have to keep your promise. Even when I’ve said something awful,” Draco continues, squeezing his eyes shut tightly to preempt another round of tears.
“You come back to the estate this instant, Pansy Hawthorne Parkinson,” he says, “I won’t ask you again.”
Father plays with her hair, tucking it behind her ear and pulling it this way and that, fascinated as always by the color. He and Nan had that in common, charmed by its brightness.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says, not sounding all that sorry. “I’ll do all the work.”
Finally, a word: While I’m serious about that character death warning for other characters (including ones that didn’t die in canon), please rest assured that I'm not killing Harry or Draco off. This fic is very self-indulgent and our main couple is one of the biggest examples of that. Remember when I said this read like a harlequin romance? Haha. The kind of relationship they have here is one that I desperately wanted to read more of (including kink and dynamic wise LOL), and I just wasn’t seeing a lot of it, so I wrote it myself. I've been tiring of reading fics about pining and interpersonal turmoil and developing relationships. This is not to say I don't love them, I wouldn't be much of a Drarry fan if I didn't, but that I wanted a change of pace. While these two will be going through a lot, both together and alone, death isn't one of those things. My outline is complete so this is something I don't mind spoiling even if it may cheapen some story beats. I would want to be warned about something like that as a reader.
“I’m sorry, Daddy,” Draco whispers. He’s horrified at the tears prickling his eyes, but the thought that he’s made his Alpha angry—that he’s impeded him somehow—feels like a failure on his part.
as he works him through it, leaning up to kiss his sweaty forehead.
Swallowing, Draco scribbles a brief reply asking if Daphne and Pansy can attend the teas as well, and sends it off with the owl without answering Mother’s question.
“You’re my good boy, you know that,” Harry says, teasingly low, into the curve of Draco’s ear.
“Let me know if you figure it out so I can get you a gift.” Draco hums.
Draco’s stroking his back as he comes to. Harry, abruptly worried that he might be crushing the baby, rolls them onto their sides, cradling Draco close. He feels strangely wrung out, like a toxin has been drained from him directly through the pores. He’s surprised to realize that a few tears have spilled from his eyes. Thankfully, the both of them are glistening with sweat, and Draco is still buzzing through aftershocks, shivering in Harry’s arms like he’s standing against a stiff wind. He isn’t likely to have noticed. Harry pauses to wipe his face on the sheets, and then kisses Draco’s closed eyelids.
Draco’s spent a frustrating amount of time the past few weeks feeling unbearably randy. There doesn’t seem to be a single thing Harry can do that he doesn’t find so arousing he can’t focus. This morning, watching his husband roll the sleeves of his button-down shirt up his strong arms had been enough to make Draco dip back into the closet and exchange undergarments in a single-minded flurry while Harry’s back was turned. It’s been nice to shed layer after layer of the inhibitions trained into him, and the back-and-forth of their games is something he cherishes. Finding different ways to drive Harry to distraction seems only fair, after what Draco’s been going through.
“It most certainly fucking is!” Draco retorts, whipping his head around to face her once again.
“I promise,” Harry says, resting his chin on the crown of Draco’s head.
“I like it when you say my name… both of them,” Harry adds, chuckling at the way Draco clears his throat. “I like it when I can get you on top so I can see all of you. I like putting my mouth on you. I like it when you get so needy you start talking to me.”
“Clarissa! What have you done now?” She calls.
Harry tilts his chin down to better see Draco’s face. He opens his mouth and closes it again, blinking. Then, he finally says, “And, er, how was it?”
, and he gratefully sucks the stale water down in three gulps. “Can you stand? We have to leave. I doubt it’s safe for us to be here.”
Harry sighs through his nose. “I just don’t feel good about keeping it from him. He asks me about it every now and then. He doesn’t even know I’ve asked you to look at it.”
The long trek through the labyrinthine citadel halls is finally ended when the servants lead them into a familiar walkway, framed on either side by tall columns. The familiar, sprawling gardens makes Draco sigh in appreciation, taking in the smells of the neatly placed flower patches carried on the breeze. The Dark Lord will not make an appearance until the bonfires begin, so his most trusted associates lead the feast. They’re seated at Aunt Bella’s table, and Draco does his best to pretend he doesn’t see her gesturing them over. Mother and Father flank her, visibly pleased at their place of honor, but Draco tugs on Harry’s arm as the seats fill up, and only lets up when there are a good six people between them on either side. Harry shoots him an amused glance as they take their places. Draco’s relief is short-lived. Pansy plops into the seat across from him, and the rest of their friends follow, looking youthful and happy in their traditional white robes.
“Yeah,
“Spectacular. Can we leave?”
“Goodness,” Draco titters, “What have I done to deserve all this praise?”
“How are you, Theo?” Harry murmurs, tilting his head.
touching you, love.” Harry chuckles. “You’ll have to be specific.”
Draco laughs. “I don’t think anybody we know would mind a trip to the French countryside or a fancy dinner spread in Egypt if we were the ones footing the bill. We Purebloods do like to save money, for whatever reason.”
Until recently, leaving a fight was the best part of the entire process. In the early years of his work, Pettigrew had been adamant that impressing Voldemort was the only thing that would see him out of a meaningless life, and it had, in its own way. But he’d never been able to conceal his relief when it was all over and the Dark Mark’s strange magic could guide his apparition back to wherever he’d been before the call. Now, knowing that there’s someone eagerly awaiting his return on the other side, Harry feels a strange amalgamation of anticipation and dread.
“Thank you,” comes the low, amused reply. “I have not visited these quarters since they were added.”
“Do you work with potions?” Draco asks, curious.
In the photo, she’s got an expensive fur-lined coat folded over her arms, and her painted lips pull up into a bright smile as she turns her head to the side. It had always seemed to Albus that nobody on the planet could ever hope to be as beautiful and well-mannered as his Nan, and in seeing this photo for the first time, he’d felt a burst of what he can now identify as pride. Glancing at it now, pinned in a place of honor by his bedroom window, Al just feels a little sick.
“Try me,” Hermione replies, eyes twinkling.
Draco squirms. This is a new request. Harry rubs his belly--something he does when he’s trying to help ease some nerves. It always works. He bites his lip and nods, and Harry vanishes his light day robe with a wave of his hand, setting Draco’s skin alight. Harry shuffles forward, pulling Draco’s legs over his muscled thighs, spreading him wide.
“Are you dying?” Al asks.
Draco knew that, but the reminder is disheartening anyway. “The moment it’s lifted, I want out of London. I can’t handle these people.”
Harry laughs humorlessly. “It’s all we have, love. It’s what I need to do if I want to keep taking care of you, in any case.”
Shuddering, Draco reaches out for his glass and takes another gulp of his brandy. “You can do that, with runes?”
“And that’d be a relief if you knew exactly where she was,” Harry guesses.
“Lily, are you alright?” He asks, voice dry with sleep.
“He didn’t,” Lily says, furrowing her brow, and is briefly and genuinely confused before she remembers something, “Oh, I guess he just doesn’t talk about it in public.”
This finally cracks some of the disinterest on Fred’s face. “My family?”
“Yes, love, I’m fine,” Harry lies, watching as Draco climbs down.
participate in this London season, and that is final.” Oleander’s voice is tired.
Just as he begins to walk, his wrist is snatched up into a powerful grip. He shoots an alarmed look over his shoulder and turns around completely when his wrist grinds painfully in protest.
“And what are your talents?”
The first few minutes are a blur of activity. They’re instructed to leave their shoes lined neatly by the door, and then rushed through several giddy introductions. Draco receives so many kisses on the cheek he’s convinced his skin must be marred with lip rogue by the time they’re done. He discreetly casts a cleaning charm when his head is turned. He recognizes quite a few people. Spouses of Father’s business associates, two fraternal twins of the various blond-haired and brown-eyed Smith brood that look identical anyway, children of Death Eaters, and finally--to his surprise--a former underclassman of theirs, who he last saw at the duels.
“That’s great, Hermione.”
“Daddy! You’re going to give me a rash,” Draco whines, doing absolutely nothing to escape him.
Draco kisses his cheek. “Never.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco, love, it’s absolutely imperative that you wear some trousers for this.” Harry tells him, fondly exasperated.
The rest of his clothes follow in short order, though Harry stops him when he starts toying with his stockings. They’re a pale yellow, and lovely against alabaster skin.
“And--and I like it when you tell me I'm good.” This last admission feels like entirely too much. Draco bites his lip to keep himself from talking any further.
“You’ve never spoken to me like that before,” Draco murmurs, avoiding Harry’s gaze.
“Not particularly, no.”
It occurs to Draco that he’s never been asked this question before. It takes him a moment to put his reply together, and he finds himself regretting that he froze the cauldron.
Draco doesn’t like the strain in his voice. “What do you mean?”
It gets him one of those rare, shy smiles, the ones that pop out when Draco can't hide behind bravado. Harry knows what it's like, to wonder about your worth, and your place in other people's regard. He makes it a point to make sure the people he cares about don't have the same questions he did. He's amused to realize he can see the cogs turning in Draco's head, assembling some clever reply to hide that he's nearly full to bursting with joy.
“Too hot? Draco, it’s December.” Harry says, brows rising.
he mouths, climbing onto Harry’s lap. Harry leans up on his elbows to pull him into a deep, toe-curling kiss, rumbling contentedly as Draco nips at his lips. Maybe it’s the magic, or the potion, or the feeling of Harry’s cock heavy and damp against Draco’s slick thighs. Or maybe it’s the feeling of so many hungry eyes on them, but Draco cannot contain the deep moan that builds up in his chest.
Harry laughs again. “Oh, I am sorry, love.”
so powerful she falls to her death on the ground below.
“Did you see what scared her?” Davies asks intently.
Sonja herself is waiting for them outside of the grand doors, her gloved hands clasped together. Like Draco, she’s rather tall for an Omega. She favors the color black--she’d worn mourning robes after the passing of her late wife, as is traditional, and then never kicked the habit. She’s wearing a gauzy black sundress today, and her deep brown hair, streaked with gray, is piled upon her head in a curly bun. There is a classical, aristocratic beauty in her high cheekbones and slender neck.
“Are you proud of me?” Draco asks.
Draco fails spectacularly at containing his amusement. He can feel Harry chuckling as he leans in and knocks their foreheads together, shoulders shaking. Harry’s hand, which has been resting on his hip for the past hour or so, gives his arse a light smack of reproach, which just makes him laugh harder.
Harry conjures a knife at his request, and though he’s hesitant to do it, he draws the blade across his palm with one swift movement. A sharp sting sends a frisson of cold pain dancing down Draco’s arm, and blood wells up immediately. Draco does the same for Harry on the opposite hand, who doesn’t even blink. Then they clasp their bleeding palms together, and Draco begins the low chant. After a moment, Harry joins him, lacing their fingers together. It’s a lengthy, complicated spell, layered with modified switching charms and protections. The best thing wizards ever did was shortening their spells into simple incantations.
My stupid, awful, no-good laptop was being repaired for several days as I worked on this chapter, so about 70% of it was written on my phone. The other 30% was written with my browser continuously crashing. Serious struggle bus moment. Sorry if there are extra mistakes I didn't catch in clean up. As usual, I will fix it to the best of my ability once I've had more sleep.
The next few days are spent with the house staff in a flurry of packing, with the staff rushing about in a rare form. Many of their Newcastle staff have never stepped foot in London, and are doing a poor job of containing their excitement. Draco listens to them gossip with muted curiosity. He’s been living here long enough to decipher their sing-songy Geordie accents, but they’ve fallen into the full-on incomprehensible again. He hasn’t the slightest clue what they could be excited about, in all honesty. It’s not as though they will have much opportunity to explore. They keep mentioning a Lowtown, a name that sounds vaguely familiar, but specifics leave him when he tries to concentrate.
“Buying you clothes costs a fortune, sweetheart,” Harry says.
“You must not spoil Omegas. You will have trouble every time you need to be away.”
“I overreacted a bit, didn’t I?” Draco asks, weakly.
Draco smiles. There was a reason Father gifted him with a diadem absolutely covered in amethysts for their wedding, but it’s nice that Harry noticed--it’s not as though he wears purple often. He rather thinks himself too pale to make it work most of the time. So he’d settled for collecting various purple paraphernalia instead.
Rosier, breathing in deep, frantic pulls of breath, points her wand at Smith. People gasp when they hear her beginning the incantation for the killing curse.
“Can’t this shield come down?” Harry barks over at the guard.
He has heard Mother complain about uppity London Omegas for years, but the moment he recognizes the signature of the dowager Sonja Avery, all of her warnings vacate his mind with swiftness. He has been given a standing invitation to attend her afternoon gatherings.
He can’t help but give in to that greed, that covetous instinct at the back of his head. It hasn’t even been tempered by Harry’s guilt. And that scares him, more than a little bit, but then he takes in Draco’s sweet scent and the pitch of his moans and the trembling of his damp thighs, and it’s easy to box the conflict up for another time.
When Clara Edmonton approaches them, accompanied by a house elf with a black box in hand, Harry amusedly watches as Draco casts his eyes around them in search of an escape.
He wracks his brain for an excuse to beg off. His Dark Mark surprises him with a sting of heat, and he nods mutely instead.
“And I look after the people I care about. Used to get a lot of grief from my friends for being intense.”
“I know he means a lot to you,” Draco huffs.. “But you can’t allow him to walk all over you.”
Buckle up, and please forgive me in advance for pulling the wool over your eyes on a Certain Something. I'd love to hear from you on
“Yes. She popped in through the floo, elegant as you please…” She chatters away as they finish up.
“Are you alright?” Mother asks, concerned. She rounds the table to sit beside him, gently patting his back.
petty, and he’s always been particularly gentle with her, so that is how they find themselves shopping for dress robes. They don’t go to Diagon Alley--aside from the restaurant, Lily hasn’t been able to stomach the thought of going there for a while--but to a nice little place Nan liked on the other side of wizarding London, a family-owned business that had never had any particular qualms with serving her. The owner smiles when she sees Lily, and then her eyes widen as Daddy steps in after her and then Grandfather, looking distinctly peaky from the apparition over.
Draco nods and takes his place at Harry’s side. He smiles up at the Healer. “Thank you, sir.”
“That won’t replace a shower,” Harry points out, kissing the back of his neck. “Will you fight me again if I try to get you in?”
Draco flushes, looks down at where his hands have fisted into his blanket. “I’m sorry I haven’t been able to give you an heir yet.”
They practice until the sun’s position in the sky shifts, bearing merrily down on them. It’s an uncharacteristically warm day for Newcastle, and it’s lovely, but Draco is unused to feeling the brunt of the sun’s rays. Mother would have blown her gasket. Aside from Beltane, they never spent time outside without some kind of covering. By the time they finish, he’s sweaty and overwarm and a little dizzy, and most importantly so aroused his throat feels tight. Harry’s tunic leaves nothing to the imagination--neither do his own riding breeches, and his lovely tanned skin looks almost golden.
The rare, hurt look on Mother’s face makes his chest pang, but it is not powerful enough for him to forgo his growing resentment.
a child. I rather suspect she’s cursed me infertile.”
“It’ll be fine.”
Draco both hates and appreciates Mother’s efforts, and it’s difficult to tell which feeling is more prevalent. Either way, it’s enough to distract him from his growing suspicion that he’s not pregnant after all. He feels about the same as he always does when Harry is gone: a little listless, lonely, and irritable. He uses the excuse that he doesn’t want to experience the tedium of procuring Harry’s permission to see a Healer on his own and avoids thinking about it too hard. He has the sinking suspicion it wouldn’t be half as difficult to cope with if he were back at Newcastle, though, with an estate to run and spells to practice and big beautiful lands to explore.
The next time Draco sees his parents, both of their eyes zero in on his neck. Draco takes a seat at the dining table, unsurprised when Father rises and stomps over to him. Father pulls back his high collar, a hiss leaving him at the sight of the bright red mark placed high on Draco’s neck.
They walk back to the tent in silence. Draco finishes the danish in about three bites and downs the gillywater like he’ll die if he doesn’t consume it all. When a harried looking serving boy passes by, Draco stops him, apologetically hands over the vestiges of his impromptu meal, and then asks Harry for a few galleons for the trouble. The boy’s frustrated expression quickly smoothes over once he’s been paid.
“I’m here,” Harry promises.
Viktorovich's eyes glitter. “Why?”
To his surprise, Draco redirects Harry’s hands, placing them low on his belly.
“My Draco is starting his
He helps Harry put it on, and then presses his hand over it when they are once again facing each other. It’d been charmed with various protective energies at Draco’s request and is warm to the touch. They kiss for a few quiet minutes, Harry gently pulling Draco into his lap.
Harry groans softly, dropping his head into the crook of Draco's neck. "I love it. How am I supposed to work, knowing you're here, smelling like that?"
“And how old are you?”
“Honestly, Lucius,” Grandmother Taliesin tuts.
“Hello, sweet boy. Did you smell me coming or something?” Harry jokes.
“You may be right in thinking Umbridge is your enemy,” Harry says, matter of factly. “She’s an opportunist. But you’ve got nothing to fear from people who aren’t, er, like you. At least not more than anybody else. Though I know it’s easy to just say, ‘Don’t be scared,’ so who knows how helpful any of this really is.”
“Do you
Theo nods wordlessly, and Harry takes his leave of the living room. On his way to the study, he pauses to poke his head into the bedroom. Draco is bundled snugly in the blankets. Both of their sleep schedules have taken a hit since the bombings, but Draco’s fatigue is so pervasive as to be alarming. Their first appointment with the specialist Healer is approaching, and Harry intends to ask about ways to get Draco sleeping regularly.
Draco writes to Aunt Bella for books on common rituals for couples, too embarrassed to ask Mother about it. Aunt Bella’s letter is dripping with dark amusement, and Draco knows they will surely endure her unsubtle teasing.
“I should hope that my presence in the whole thing would make it a rather sweet dream,” Draco sniffs, turning his nose up.
“Draco,” Harry says.
“Do you like it?” Draco asks, in a rush.
He’s been tugging and licking at Draco’s nipples for a while, and his words feel like a live wire from the perky nubs don to his cock. Draco arches his back, pressing one up towards Harry’s mouth. When Harry teasingly pulls away from him, he locks ankles together over his back.
“Do you love him?” Pansy asks, softly.
“A couple of months ago, Harry and I had a meeting with the Dark Lord.” Draco says.
“Okay,” Draco whispers, turning to face him.
Ahead of them, Voldemort stands stalwart, Nagini coiled tightly around his bare feet. Harry is reminded of Draco’s desperate warning, all those weeks ago. Harry has never tried to speak with Nagini, mistaking his peers’ failure to do so as a show of fear and respect. Nagini speaks of overfed hags and the scent of fresh blood, and though Voldemort tips his head in acknowledgment, no one else reacts. Foolish, Harry thinks to himself. Foolish, foolish, foolish. He has been living amongst these people far too long for something like that to escape his attention.
Harry gapes at him. Then, praying for patience, he turns away and pinches the bridge of his nose, upsetting his glasses.
“He’s awake, thank the Wild,” Pansy says, her voice muffled and far away.
“Yeah, but you like me just fine,” Harry dares to say.
Harry laughs, loud and bright, drawing the attention of the people around them. They duck their heads, amused.
“D’you want me to help you get dressed, sir?”
“Oh,” Pansy says. “Oh,
Draco reaches into his pockets and presents the vial to Harry, enjoying the way the fire’s warm glow bounces off its dark red color. “I would hate for this to go to waste.”
The words remind Draco that he can still feel Harry heavy and throbbing inside him. He kisses Harry’s chin, reaching up to cup his face and brush his messy hair out of his eyes. “You don’t have to stop.”
"I'd love to bond with you, Draco," Harry says, seriously.
“I’ll be right back. You worried me this morning.” Harry says, gently.
He’d owled her the address before they even left for London, hoping that she would be coming along as well, now that she no longer has to worry about looking after him.
“You can take more.” Harry says, pressing his other hand onto Draco’s thigh, and something about the firmness in his voice has Draco jackknifing in his hold, cock twitching weakly in his hand as a wave of white-hot sensation dances through his limbs.
At first, he doesn’t think it worked. Then the woman coughs.
As if on cue, one of his hands slips and the broom wobbles dangerously. Even though they’re maybe two feet above the grass, all of the color leaves his face. It’s at once endearing and hilarious.
“Er, yes? Why?”
Harry leans in for a kiss, which Draco happily grants him, eyes fluttering closed. It’s a chaste brush of lips, but it has pixies turning pirouettes in his stomach anyways.
“Yes.” Harry snaps.
“Merlin,” Harry hisses, the moment a rush of freezing wet air blows down the hazily lit corridor before him. “The stench.”
Draco nods. Harry squeezes his shoulders, disturbed at the description. Most of the birds had been killed or vanished by the time Harry returned from Russia.
The whole time he’s been running a hand up and down Scorpius’ arm, lulling him into a sleepy doze right on his feet. When Father asks what he smells, he’s jolted back into wakefulness.
Hermione presses her face into Ron’s wildly trembling shoulder, clutching his hand tightly in hers. Ginny lets out a low sob as the army of elegantly raised hands lowers and the Minister asks Fred if he has anything he’d like to say. George throws an arm over Ginny’s shoulder and pulls her close. Harry can see that Fred has caught his gaze from the lower hall. Fred smiles, and George nods back. The two of them have always been able to share entire conversations with looks and gestures.
“Yes, actually. In some good ways, and bad ways. What about you?”
Teddy comes to visit, and it briefly feels like they’ve gone back in time. Lily squeals out his name in excitedly, shrieking with laughter as he pulls her off of her feet. James once joked with them that she liked Teddy better than she liked them.
“Harry,” Draco says, looking up with a smile. “You’re home.”
AKA Harry Potter and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day(s).
Draco squirms against the burst of warmth in his belly. “You don’t have to,” he says, weakly.
The fire eats away at one door and destroys the other completely; Harry steps over the remaining flames on the way in. The large room behind is boxily made and chaotically decorated, with high cobblestone walls and stained glass windows. The headmaster has propped himself against his large desk to recover.
kind of silly, wasn’t it?” Harry asks sheepishly.
“Not lovely.”
Draco opens beautifully for him, hot and wet and perfect, like Harry was made to be inside him. Harry knows instantly that he’s not going to last very long. The passion-fueled urgency of the past couple of rounds has eased into a tender need to be close. Draco tuts in protest each time Harry pulls his face away from their slow press of lips and squirms minutely whenever Harry pulls out.

“Well, Harry’s quite powerful. He rarely uses his wand while we’re at home. Sometimes if he has to take his work from one room to another he just levitates it all behind him. Or if he’s too lazy to get up for something he’ll wave his hand and--close the curtains or lock the floo, that sort of thing.”
“I brought him to London because I asked if he wanted to and he said yes, what else is there to discuss? I know your standards are ridiculously high for me, Lucius, but I won’t tolerate you blaming me for something none of us could have anticipated. I’m ‘free’ with Draco because he’s a person.”
Harry can feel a very old fit of temper creeping in, and he begins biting at his thumb. To be fair, not many people have questioned him for anything, but those who did have burrowed their way into his doubts in ways he can’t shake. Draco, wide-eyed and horrified after witnessing fights Harry shouldn’t have exposed him to; Hermione, in her own quiet way; and Viktorovich, who’d bluntly criticized him for his inaction.
Alpha Draco/Omega Harry
(See the end of the chapter for
She gives him a small smile. “Not brave. Just a worker. What about you? What do you do?”
“So you’re just that nutter's puppet?” Ron laughs, without a trace of humor.
Harry pulls him closer by the ankles, holding him aloft to prop more pillows beneath his bottom, which absolutely does not help the situation at all. He’s so wet that he can feel it on his inner thighs, and has the decency to blush when Harry finds it, too, big hands spreading him wide.
The words hit him as harshly as any physical blow, and the hurt is quickly soured by the anger that won’t leave him.
“Not yet,” Bellatrix bellows. “I said it’d be me first!”
“You’re not going to do it with magic?” Theo asks, after a little while.
a service. They are fodder in this war, and you know that.” Oleander snaps. Then, softer, he says, “Listen, Pansy. Surely you understand the obligation that Alistair Bulstrode has to our society. He must allow the mistake in his bloodline to die out.”
Of all the things Harry was expecting to hear, this was certainly not one of them. “Draco, I could never hate you.”
“Better luck next time, mate,” Harry says.
“But?” He asks.
They glance at each other, and then the Healer nods. “Of course.”
Harry’s plush lips slide over his angry red tip, a sight so erotic that Draco knows the memory will haunt his dreams. He’s significantly smaller than Harry, but it still shocks him to see Harry take him down to the base, swallowing in a ripple of wet heat. He just stares down, gobsmacked. It takes Harry pinching him on the arse to begin a slow rhythm. Harry hums, his tongue swirling over the tip each time Draco pulls out. His elbows are suddenly too weak to support him, and Harry immediately cups the back of his thighs, supporting him for each shaky thrust.
"Well... just be good to my friend. Bye, you two."
"Hey," Harry says, gently. "I think you're perfectly nice."
In this relatively unoccupied corner of the castle, it is easy to follow the trail Viktorovich left behind. It leads him through archways and past trashed classrooms piled high with bodies, and then finally down a steep stairwell.
Magical builders had been employed to rebuild the homes of nobles that survived the bombings. In a show of benevolence that Harry didn’t buy for a second, Voldemort footed the bill as an “apology for failing his people.” Such acts have always gone a long way towards maintaining the faith of the wizarding public (one of Harry’s earliest memories is of the celebration his orphanage held after receiving a generous donation from the Dark Lord--it’d been the first time he ate candy), but it brings Harry a stab of vindictive pleasure to imagine temper tantrums that probably followed this one.
He’d thought himself childish when thinking about asking for the same thing, but Harry said it first, and he doesn’t want to make a habit of gaping into the mouths of gift horses. Harry laughs softly at him and agrees, and then rests his hand low on Draco’s belly.
“Like that,” Draco gasps, “I’m coming, please, Daddy, I’m coming—” The last word lengthens into a moan, and his come smears over his fingers and across his chest as he cries out Harry’s name. There’s another resounding thud as Draco’s writing desk slams back down to the floor, followed by every other article of mess.
He looks at her for a long time. She thinks he’s going to say no, so she lets out a nervous laugh and wrings her hands, looking around the music room for something to start playing. Maybe the guitar today?
Impatient and desperate, Draco burrows his face into Harry’s neck and says, “Daddy.”
Draco leans in for a slow kiss, smiling against his lips when Harry strokes his chin with a thumb.
Sure enough, when Draco knocks softly on the open door of the room, all four stiffen at the sight of him. The table is absolutely covered in papers and pens and even a photo, though it’s far enough away from Draco’s line of sight that he can only make out a blur of color and movement before George’s hand covers it completely. After a beat, Ginny greets him breathlessly, and Hermione says, “Hello, Draco! What can we do for you?”
“Merlin, why won’t this thing ever leave me be?” He scowls.
“Do you remember the bloodline lessons? When they’d sit us down and tell us all about our families, and how they failed, and exactly why we were all sad little orphans? My father said no to him, remember?  He never got over that.
“Ma’am,” Wood says, dipping his head.
-There is a part that alludes to sexual assault, beginning with the sentence "Harry makes a dubious noise, but says nothing."
Merlin, not the doe eyes. Harry sighs through his nose, praying for patience. Draco had shyly attempted to entice him more days than not, back at St. Mungo’s. Harry was able to distract him with a few good orgasms, but he knew what Draco really wanted: to reconnect, to tie, to feel close again. Harry was able to excuse holding off on account of Draco’s injuries, but after his discharge and that wry assurance from the Healer (he wouldn’t be surprised if Draco mustered up the courage to ask him to say that while Harry was away), there’s no excuse.
Before he’s even done talking, he’s being pushed insistently through a door. Whatever they’ve stepped into is dark, and chaotic with different scents. Harry flips a light switch, and he’s staring down a rack of coats and shawls and the like.
Scorpius laughs. “When she mentioned it at lunch there was a bit of complaining, yeah. Sounds like a good idea to me, but I don’t know how long she’d want it to last. Sounds like something that’d make Grandfather pop a vein.”
, and understands.
Draco leans forward, a whine tumbling from his lips as he finds an angle that suits him. He can feel himself going deeper, spearing into wet walls that take him easily as anything, clenching tightly around him with each outward pull. Another of Al's impatient thrust stills him, though it's with clear reluctance, a little whimper falling from his lips. Al surges up to swallow the sound with his mouth. And then Draco does something with his body, rippling around him in this intense, pulsating press of his insides, pulling a loud sound from Al's throat.
“Look. How about we go. If! You let me cover your eyes if I feel like something bad is going to happen.”
Harry can’t contain the severe frown that takes over his face. “What sort of comments?”
He grits his teeth and endures the towel's assault until he's suitably dry, then haphazardly throws it over the light green shards littered by the sink. He raids Harry's side of the closet, and spends an embarrassingly long amount of time just rubbing his face into shirts and breathing in Harry's familiar musk. He settles on a heavy flannel and silk underwear. Then he starts taking Harry's shirts down one by one and dragging them to the bed. He arranges them into some weak approximation of a nest, wraps one shirt around his head, and falls into a restless doze. When he awakens, all it takes is one restless shift for him to feel that he has absolutely soaked his way through some of his most expensive underwear.
With one last hard look, Harry sweeps inside and takes his seat at his usual seat, not far from Voldemort’s place at the head of the long, enchanted table they all plan at. It’s spelled to project images into the air above it and is typically used to display maps and plans for their benefit.
“Yes! Come on through!”
A third crack of noise hits, uncomfortably close, and Draco draws his wand. Daphne slides her arm through his, glancing worriedly towards the window. He follows her gaze and sees nothing but a beautifully clear day, and even some gardeners trudging about with soil and saplings in hand. There’s a low chatter growing in the parlor, worried faces glancing back and forth. Sonja has risen from her chair and started for the open door.
I'm still planning chapters out, trying to feel my way around where I wanna take things, and pestering my friend for ideas. But above all I'm just having fun toying around with this world, writing my usual smut (it won't be every chapter lol), and trying to write something darker, if that makes sense. I'd consider these chapters more loosely related oneshots than one cohesive story line, mostly for the sake of my sanity. This may change if irl magically gets less overwhelming, but for now I'm just sharing the fun. With my new plans in mind, I've updated the archive warning, and I plan to update tags/warnings etc as I go.
“That’s not what I meant,” Draco interrupts. “I just… Do you think I’m bad?”
And then he moves, ignoring Draco’s whine of protest. He shuffles his way out of his chemise with a sigh of relief, and runs a hand over his neck, down his chest. By the time Harry returns to the bed, carrying a few thick blankets and shirts, Draco’s squirming and pinching the hard peaks of his nipples. He’d never known they could be so sensitive until Harry got his mouth on them.
Draco flushes in remembrance. He was one of the people sticking his nose up and making unkind comments in carrying undertones as he walked past her and Milicent Bulstrode. He has one memory of being paired with her for a Herbology project in Fifth Year. She’d patiently set about doing her half of the work, and Draco had been an absolute nightmare. He refused to address her directly if he could help it, made a show of his disgust if they brushed arms or legs or sat too close, and would leave harsh criticisms in the margins of her notes in bright red ink.
"Hi." Al says, waggling his eyebrows.
Draco whines, “You’re so handsome. You’re so good to me. I want to climb you like a tree.”
“Who started all of this?” He presses on. “How did you get involved?”
Harry smirks. “Sounds about right. If I were home right now, he’d be pulling me out of bed to take him on a boat ride or something, and then when we got on the thing he’d make me hold a parasol above his head for shade. He’d want
Draco links his arms around Harry’s neck, weeping softly. Harry strokes his back, bemused and full of a hopeless sort of affection.
“No! Ugh, Father, stop,” Scorpius says, rubbing his face to hide the flush rising on his cheeks.
Because James can’t seem to take most things seriously, a delighted guffaw bursts from his chest. Scorpius bites his lip to contain his answering laugh.
“Honestly, Draco, you seen some of the things I cook. I think I can braid Lily’s hair just fine.” Dad laughs.
“Perfectly lovely,” Draco says, smoothing his hands over Harry’s collar. “Want
Harry swallows. “Yes. I’m grateful to see he’s okay.”
She flinches. “Yes.”
“Yeah?” Harry asks.
His expression quickly becomes troubled before he continues on. “That reminds me of something I should have told you a while back. Your uncle Rodolphus asked for something very similar. He wanted us to consider having a child that would be named his heir and take on his name. He thinks Bellatrix has--er--cursed him. So that he can’t have children.”
The reporter--a short little woman in an unassuming sundress, Harry has no doubt she’s been shrinking her camera so she looks like a regular citizen and not an absolute vulture--rushes along beside them, asking question after question. She quickly seems to realize that Harry’s not going to give her more than one-word answers, so she focuses her questions on Draco, who blooms under the attention.
Harry has had many enterprising parents throw their newly-of-age children his way, but Draco Malfoy is an interesting one.
“Yes, Daddy,” Draco chuckles breathlessly. “I like it. You don’t have to hold back.”
“I’ve heard,” Draco whispers, “That the Elixr to Induce Euphoria makes sex quite… interesting.”
"Some of the rebels?" He asks.
“What’s it doing that for?” Draco asks, peering curiously over Harry’s shoulder.
,” breaking his voice apart. Harry rewards him with another heavy thrust, spearing him open. He kisses the sensitive spot behind his ear, and then settles on his haunches, pressing one hand between his shoulder blades, popping his arse up. The slight change of angle sends him scoring over Draco’s prostate, and Draco arches his back with a low cry, whimpering and rolling his hips back into Harry’s.
Scorpius, who’d been extremely close to trying out Aunt Ginny’s beloved bat-bogey hex, immediately sits back on his knees. James wipes the dirt on his hands off onto his jeans, like that’s any less incriminating.
Draco understands what Harry meant, all that time ago, when he said his magic was big. It rattles the glistening walls of the barrier around them, bouncing in arcs, razing the grass below. When Aunt Bella duels, it often looks like she is dancing. Now, she has a partner, who ducks and weaves and turns, the very air around his wand writhing chaotically from the heat of his magic. There’s a hungry look on Harry’s face. Where Aunt Bella has lost her usual cheer, Harry’s all lopsided grins and whoops and scattered taunts, some of them so nasty that Mother gasps, scandalized.
Draco giggles. “Do you remember what I said on our wedding night? When--when I first saw it?”
Harry moans his name, his hips stuttering against Draco’s arse. He can feel Harry’s hand curling around the base of his shaft as he fills Draco with thick ropes of his come, separating his knot from Draco’s aching channel. Frustrated, Draco squirms back against him.
Harry snorts into his neck, kissing over their bondmark. Draco winces when Harry kneels and gently pulls his legs down, and locks his ankles behind Harry’s knees. Harry rubs brisk circles onto his trembling thighs, hoping to soothe the soreness that is likely settling in.
“Right,” Harry says, taking the parchment. “Thank you. I’m grateful.”
“Yeah, that happens sometimes, too.” Harry purrs.
The partners glance at each other again, a conversation in their narrowed eyes. Harry doesn’t like it one bit. Finally, Davies speaks again. “Yes and no.”
Draco scrambles to comply, but he’s suddenly on fawn legs. At his whine of complaint, Harry guides him over, hands effortlessly maneuvering his weak limbs. He’s breathless with wanting by the time Harry gets him the way he wants him—face down, arse in the air, thighs spread as wide as they can go without him losing leverage.
I understand that the conversion of the place is kind of anachronistic with the setting of this story, but just roll with it LOL I got really excited about the different elements of worldbuilding I was working with. I’m excited to get some more worldbuilding in and push this plot along (in a teeny tiny way).
He spends a few more minutes gentling Draco and then begins anew, movements quickly deteriorating from a careful rhythm to the single-minded determination of the chase. Draco is completely spent, but the sensation is still wonderful in a shivery, achy sort of way, just this side of too much. Soft, mewling noises fall from his lips unbidden, an ache building in his thighs and belly and radiating deliciously outward.
“Oh,” Harry says, softly, before he leans in and captures Draco’s lips in a kiss.
Now he just feels a stab of curiosity. Harry always holds back during their lessons. It would be interesting to see him in his element. He looks up at Harry, surprised to find that he’s already being watched. He raises his brows inquisitively. “What do you think, love?”
Aunt Bella snorts, but the stormy look on her face belays that she has fallen into one of her legendary sulks.
“I haven’t seen a Healer,” Draco protests, not wanting to give himself hope.
“Did something happen?” Harry asks.
After debating to himself for a little while, Draco decides that this is a bridge he will cross in the future. An argument that will come years and years in the future is nothing compared to what needs to happen now. Draco marks the page, closes the diary, and eats his cake.
The familiar crack of apparition follows. Malfoy smacks him upside the head, as if he weren't the one to cast the charms in the first place. Sirius saves himself an avalanche of complaints by stealing another kiss. There were certainly worse ways to approach that particular conversation.
Harry laughs. “Not that, either, but I’ll take it if that makes you happy.”
“At least ask Harry which colors he’d like.” Sirius sighs.
He half expects to find Draco rifling through the cupboards, but the small upstairs kitchen is empty. After setting the owl up with strips of chicken, Harry takes the letter in hand. The envelope is unmarked, but Harry recognizes the handwriting of the letter within as if it’s been yesterday since he’s seen it.
Draco shrugs. “Anywhere. Can I think about it? Was this enough warning for us to be able to go?”
Draco recoils. “That’s quite an accusation! I know Aunt Bella can be, well, horrid, but doing something like that could hurt her, too.”
He doesn’t have his diary, but three new truths are swirling around in his head, effectively distracting him from the loss. One, Lily Potter is dead because of the man her son now serves. Two, she was the child of Muggles. Finally, she gave birth to Harry, and Draco loves her for it.
for a healthy amount of schoolyard teasing,” Harry says.
Harry silences any further protests by appreciatively cupping his cheeks and spreading them. The moment his warm breath hits Draco's hole, he melts. Harry's tongue drags warm and dirty over from his tight balls to his tailbone, and then his plush lips are closing over him as he sucks. Draco whines his approval into the air, swaying eagerly into the feeling. The world is reduced into a haze of sensation, and then Harry dips his tongue into Draco's hole. Unable to stand it, Draco wiggles a hand under his belly and grips his cock, tugging himself in quick, practiced movements. He spurts over his hand, and it feels amazing, but it's still not enough, especially with Harry there.
"You're terrible!" Draco says, suddenly overcome with this frantic mix of affection and embarrassment and deep arousal.
"I want to see you," Draco says, shyly.
“Don’t joke about things like that. You’re my best friend.” Draco says.
She'll always wonder why the Sorting Hat got her and James’ houses backwards, and then frowns when she remembers how it’d laughed in her head and said “Another Potter? Ah, but you are unique, aren’t you? I know just where to place you,” and then bellowed out
With that, the room erupts into low chatter. Harry’s stomach drops. Several people are asking the boy if he knows which neighborhoods were targeted, and he is answering them as quickly as possible. Voldemort has adopted a veneer of calm, but Harry can feel the rage rolling off of him in waves. It is in deliberately lowered shoulders and pale lips pressed thin and the slant of glowing red eyes.
Al comes just like that, like a shot, gasping and sobbing his release into Draco's collarbone, knot pulsing forth. He moves a hand down just in time, fingers sliding slickly where they're joined, to grip at it, soothing the need to just punch it in. He'd love nothing more than to tie with Draco, but they haven't had that conversation yet. He can feel some of his release dripping out around them, trailing lazily over his balls and probably down onto the velvet below. Draco's writhing on his lap, moaning weakly. Al helps him off his cock, eyes drawn to the trail of wetness that connects them and then breaks. He goes easily as Al pushes him onto his back, so trusting that it has something catching in Al's throat.
They all put their money and their secrecy together to present Dad and Father with a pensieve, which earns them all a tight group hug. Coordinating that had been no easy task.
“I don’t want you to go.” He whispers.
“As you say,” the Minister replies neutrally. “Thank you, Mrs. Avery. You may leave the chamber.”
“Harry, I didn’t mean it,” he whispers, covering Harry’s hand with his own.
Malfoy tenses beneath him. Sirius has to hide his groan at what it does to his knot with a loud, fake cough. "Yeah, Harry?"
“Don’t stop, Daddy,” He sighs, head falling back onto the mattress.
“If you give me that spiel about how all old families are inbred, I might scream,” Harry warns, a weak attempt at a joke.
“I’m not cold anymore,” Draco announces.
Mother cups his cheek, smoothing over some of the nerves creeping steadily in.
Taking Koldovstoretz is to be the penultimate leg of their Russian advance. They bide their time in Bolotin’s home, memorizing maps of the school and basic curse breaking protocol and the profiles of talented fighters expected to be waiting for them within.
“Er, yeah. Why?” Harry asks, still skimming over the last of his notes.
Voldemort rises from his seat. His jaw tenses--he’s grinding his teeth. “London has been attacked. Most of the… insurgents have been contained by Aurors, but they are in need of support, and I am sure you all would like to see your families as well. We will continue these talks as soon as possible.”
He’s reminded, with a pang in his chest, of the friends he left behind years ago. He’d done what he could to share his success with those who would have it, but quite a few of them felt betrayed by his new status. It hurts to know how near they are every time he’s in London. Harry is friendly enough with the less frustrating members of Pureblood society, but he’s beginning to wonder if Draco is the first person he’s made a significant connection with in years.
“Just wanting to know how he’s taking it all, I guess. She doesn’t think he’ll talk to her.”
“It was horrible.” Draco whispers.
“This is my husband,” Draco says, for lack of anything better to say.
“I want to touch you,” Draco says, locking his fingers with Harry’s when they rest on his stomach.
“You didn’t,” Draco agrees, smiling. “I’ve got to have
“I’m so sorry,” the maid repeats.
Draco does it again, tensing rhythmically, pleased to feel Harry twitching inside him. He is suffused with laughter when Harry groans and gently knocks their forehead together. Eventually, Harry joins him, snickering wheezily into Draco’s mouth between soft kisses.
“Will you teach me how to duel?”
“Tea?” Rodolphus asks. He sinks into the plush chair on the other side of the low table separating them and hails a house elf by shaking the glistening bell placed dead center. “Minky will make it to your specifications.”
“You’ll need to wait, sweetheart, you tired me out,” Harry says, squeezing his hip.
“I talked to grandfather the other day,” Scorpius tells him.
“Yes,” Draco sighs, angling his head back for a kiss.
, Al,
He rains kisses on the side of Draco’s face, endeared to see it gradually redden.
Draco shoots up, giving him a wide-eyed look. “That--what?”
“Shhhh,” Harry croons, using the hand he’s got on Draco’s jaw to tilt his head and bring him into a softer, gentler kiss, more a press of lips than anything.
“She is introducing herself as Anezka Newman, Master Potter,” the elf says.
Harry doesn’t know how to respond to that, so he doesn’t, opting instead to guide Draco back against a nearby wall. He tilts his head up when Harry leans in to graze his teeth over the red bond mark, hands cupping Harry’s elbows. He makes a vain attempt to resist biting down, but Draco’s scent is familiar and safe, makes him greedy on a good day. Draco whimpers at the feeling of Harry’s teeth digging into the tender flesh, scent thickening on the air.
He bites his lip, and then he's working his arms out of the sleeves of Al's oversized shirt. He wraps them around his waist to secure the shirt to his torso, and then puls the bralette off. Al can't help the way noise that falls from his lips. He leans in to take one pink nipple into his mouth, while the left rises to cup the weight of the other breast. Draco moans his name, slender fingers sliding into his hair. Al is Draco's opposite in this. The pain of his hair being pulled is good, grounding. Draco will tug on his hair to guide him, and he likes that, likes the surrender of it all. Draco pulls tightly as he rises up onto his knees, sighing when his entrance catches on the throbbing head of Al's cock. He slides down, taking him in with a moan. Al presses his face into Draco's neck, and starts counting back from ten as they both adjust. He can already tell that he's not going to last very long.
Draco’s lack of hesitation surprises him. “I’d like to get off the island for a little while. Do you think you could take me to one of the other countries for a little while?”
Draco ducks his head and laughs. Harry hadn’t protested being banished outside of the door while Draco asked his question, but he’s bound to be expecting the worst. Fatherhood seems to have turned him into a worrywart. Draco exchanges his goodbyes with their Healer in low-voiced French as she leads him out of her office, and can’t help a besotted smile at the way Harry clumsily rises to his feet, nervously twiddling with Draco’s jacket.
The woman swallows. “No, my lord.”
“Headmistress McGonagall is thinking about pairing up Muggleborn students with students raised with magic to help a cultural exchange, I think. Sounds cool.”
Preview for next chapter:
He crosses the room in a few long strides and bends at the waist for a soft kiss. When they part, his thumb smoothes gently over Draco’s bottom lip. “Hi, sweet boy.”
“Pansy Parkinson.”
“Ron, please,” Ginny sighs.
“The British think breathing is rude!” Her father harrumphs. His face brightens at Harry’s laugh. “Hello, Mr. Potter. Thank you for breaking the law so my daughter could stay alive.”
“But anyways, there’s a waiting period while your caretakers deliberate. Then you get this list and you’re told, pick one or someone’ll pick for you. In the weeks leading up to getting my list, I’d pissed off Matron for backtalk. She’d been terrorizing my girlfriend at the time something fierce, and I thought, well, I’m leaving soon, why not say the stuff I always wanted to say? So one day I got my list and the only choice was ‘assistant cook.’ Drove me right spare.”
A few feet away, he catches a glimpse of Theo standing next to his father. His lips are moving wordlessly the shape of a prayer Harry is intimately familiar with. It’s a simple prayer of penance he’d seen some caretakers at the orphanage doing after fits of anger that were grievous even for them. He’s also seen Pettigrew privately running through it after being scolded by Voldemort for one ridiculous thing or another. Harry’s Latin is weak outside of spellwork, but he remembers part of this prayer includes asking the Wild Magic to turn its gaze favorably upon the person wronged. It’s completed by holding one’s hands out, palms up, and then clasping them together over the heart. Cantankerous grabs his son’s wrists and lowers them before he can finish.
“Yeah.”
“Mr. Pettigrew, hello,” Harry says, smiling. It may be odd, but Peter is one of the few people he does enjoy seeing, for better or worse. He’s squirrely, presumptuous in one moment and sniveling the next, and doesn’t cut a very impressive figure as a squat little man with balding hair.
“What do you want, sweetheart?”
“How’s your mother?”
His bright gray eyes are rapidly filling with tears.
“Hmm?” Harry presses, kissing at his bondmark and then along his clavicles.
“Can we have a bath?” Draco asks, hopefully.
!” Alecto huffs. “They’re made to take knots. They’ll be happy either way, won't they?”
“We will now begin the fire festival.” The Dark Lord says, making his serene way into the crowd as the house elves begin their work of setting up.
, fists on his hips.
“I know, baby,” Harry answers, kissing Draco’s sweaty forehead.
“Harry, I’ve been wondering…” Draco begins, after they’ve spent a few moments enjoying the walk.
"I'm right here," Harry chuckles, hands warm and heavy on Draco's hips.
Draco shrugs, unsure of what else to say. Their heavy winter robes are elaborate and beautiful, but they can get stuffy, especially after all of their walking. Maybe it’s different for Harry, who regularly fights in robes just as thick.
“Please, erm, move,” Harry says, as loudly as he can.
“Teaching some Mudbloods how to throw curses is
Both of them face him in a rush when he clears his throat and then hides a large yawn behind his hand. The rage on Harry’s face recedes the smallest bit when Draco shoots him a weak smile, but Weasley’s flushed face darkens enough that it almost matches his hair.
“It was. I am grateful every day that you were not raised in it,” Father replies, one gloved hand gently patting Draco's where it rests on his arm.
Harry laughs outright, and then kisses him squarely on the lips. “You are young, but you’re far from stupid. I’m glad you could have fun. Remind me and we’ll get sloshed together when I have the time. Then you can see just how embarrassing I get on a good few firewhiskeys.”
“It’s not his fault, Ron!” Hermione says, obviously sensing where his next words are headed.
Draco flushes, gesturing softly with the folded blanket he has hooped in one corner, the needle pointing halfway out of the in-progress design. It’s a mess of green and brown at the moment, but he’s hopeful it will turn out favorably.
Lily doesn’t fancy herself smart, though she does work hard, if only because she doesn’t like letting people down. She’s just weird. When she was small, she’d have these loud, chaotic bursts of accidental magic, shattering windows and scaring neighbors and spelling herself into odd places. It’d felt like all the magic was too much, dancing just underneath the surface of her skin. Some of her earliest memories are being carted to and from friends and family, then mind healers and just regular healers, who’d ask her strange questions and have her feel for her magic. Sometimes she turned people’s skin different colors. Sometimes she’d mumble a word of discomfort and seal someone’s lips shut. Sometimes she’d blow them clear off their feet. They’d leave each meeting just as they started, baffled but kind, tousling her hair and giving her that pained smile adults put on when they don’t want you to think they’re worried.
He cups Draco’s cheek, thumbing where his lips are pulled tight over his cock.
The fullness of it punches sharp, juddering breaths from him with each shallow thrust, nerves alight with each drag. Harry works his thighs wider apart and changes his rhythm to quick, rutting thrusts, battering Draco’s prostate until he’s tensing up and coming with a painful intensity. Harry grunts and follows not soon after, filling him deep. His knot catches on Draco’s rim, but he pulls out before they can actually tie, and Draco squirms both at the loss and at the feeling of his Alpha’s release oozing out after him.
“Of course I have. He thought it was a wonderful idea,” Draco replies. “We meant to ask you together, at a more appropriate time.”
“Where did you grow up, Harry? What was it like?”
“Why are you squeezing the spinach, Hilda?” Draco asks, half an hour into their companionable semi-silence.
Draco nods, clearly conflicted.
“No,” Draco laughs. “I’m pregnant.”
Instead, they all huddle around him for a famous Potter squeeze, much to the amusement of onlookers.
That’s apparently the end of that, but she can feel Father slide out of bed a few hours later--she’d fallen into a doze, but not quite a sleep, even with the two of them there--and when the sun finally rises, Daddy helps her out of bed and tells her she can make the visit.
“Yes,” Hermione says. “I’m pregnant.”
Draco reaches back for him. Harry takes his hand and kisses his knuckles. Draco's so smitten he doesn't know what to do with himself. They're going to be the most obnoxious little family on the planet.
After a little while, Draco glances over Harry’s shoulder, and his expression quickly closes off.
The next few minutes pass in a tangle of greetings and in an absentminded conversation. More and more house elves are shooed away by their Masters, who slide into their seats in clear excitement. Waitstaff pop in and out to take orders for food and drink, and while Harry settles for water, he orders lemonade and a tray of assorted tea sandwiches for Draco, who blushes prettily at Harry’s firm instructions to eat it all. He’d only been able to stomach a light breakfast.
,” Draco hisses back, which neatly removes all of the dark mirth from her face and sends the audience into another tizzy.
“He’s that bloke you lot won’t shut up about,” Harry says. Like he was hoping, it shakes a little laugh out of Draco, makes him look up with a smile. It’s a wobbly one, but a smile nonetheless.
“And you’ll keep waiting until he’s discharged. He’s not ready to talk with you yet, especially not in this setting.”
“For the past few weeks, Father and I have been discussing some of the intelligence shared by one of Mr. Dolohov’s contacts. As you know, we learned that the Koldovstoretz school of magic rests in the center of an enchanted forest, which redirects the ill-intentioned until they are either lost or killed. I am suggesting that we use the poison Father and Headmaster Snape are working on to kill the forest before we even think of invading, in order to avoid unnecessary losses.”
“But, sir, I can’t
Harry raises a brow at him. Draco nods. Harry gives him a big, beaming smile--the kind that makes him feel like there are pixies turning pirouettes in his stomach.
He squeezes the soft globes of Draco’s arse, then gently pulls them apart. He lets out a groan at the sight of the glistening pink hole. He blows over it, and Draco lets out a juddering breath. Harry stiffens his tongue and presses the wet muscle into Draco’s hole, humming lowly. Draco whimpers his name and squirms.
“Why?” Draco whimpers.
And then a low gasp falls from her lips. Draco can’t see what she’s seen, as Pansy has leaned forward by his other side and blocked his view. Draco hears Sonja casting
Theo gives them a knowing look when they finally step inside. Harry mouths
Harry gently helps him detach, pausing only to carelessly rub his face and hand dry on the nearest pillow and then press a comforting kiss on his shuddering stomach. Draco is pliant and insensate as Harry helps him onto his hands and knees. He runs his hands up and down Draco’s sides, soothing him through the aftershocks, murmuring words of praise into Draco’s neck.
Draco thinks of the darkness in Harry’s post-raid eyes, of that woman asking
“Hello, everyone,” she says, smiling that big, unrestrained smile of hers. “Hello, Mr. Potter. It’s so good to see you again! I’m glad you’re healthy!”
Father leans forward, then a laugh tumbles out of his chest, vibrating against the side of Scorpius’ head. “Hm. There’s this smell that babies have, at the crown of their heads? Harry thought I’d gone mad when James was born because I used to spend so much time just sniffing him. But then I made him try it, and he loved it, and by the time you and Al were born the family was making fun of us for sniffing our babies. I smell that.
He widens his knees and presses his chest down onto the mattress in a sumptuous roll of movement. The change in angle makes Harry’s length slip out the tiniest bit, which is promptly remedied by calloused hands pulling him back into the cradle of strong hips.
“It’s got ledger lines, you know I’m awful at those, just awful--”
He gets the “I hate that I want to laugh” dimple from Father. They kiss. It’s gross. It makes James smile.
. (Usually, Harry just gently spells the blankets off his head with a wandless wave of the hand.)
“I suspect they wouldn’t tell me if I made a faux pas.” He points out.
Draco whines, stroking himself faster. The thought of it fills him with this wanting that makes his throat burn. Every other heat up until now has been a nuisance, something for him to suffer through in a haze of sweat and food that tasted like ash on his tongue. The thought that now, he has a powerful Alpha with him, one that loves him and desires him, someone to scratch that itch deep inside, makes him greedy for it. “I want it now.”
"Hm?" Harry asks, smoothing a hand over his back. "I didn't hear you."
He sees the look on Harry’s face shutter the smallest bit, but it’s quickly replaced by a smile when Draco asks him if he’s okay.
Kain blanches. “Begging your pardon, sir. I didn’t recognize—we could… show you our badges?”
Harry’s leaning against the glass sliding doors that separate the shower and tub from the rest of the washroom. He smiles when Draco wiggles his way out of his sleep clothes and guides him inside. Their bath passes in pleasant silence, the heat of the water seeping into Draco’s aching body. By the time they are dried and fully dressed, the pain of waking has slipped his mind.
“What is it?”
“I’m okay. The baby is okay. I haven’t used any magic. I promise I won’t die if you look away from me for a second.” Draco says.
It takes only twenty-four hours of witnessing Draco’s moping for Mother to move in. He’d never admit to it if asked, but he’s grateful. She claims the guest bedroom closest to the master suite and then sets about getting him on something like a schedule. After breakfast, he is to help her sort out mail sent her way by other society folk. After that, they hold hands and take walks, seeing the sights, shopping, and entertaining friends. They might take lunch at a nice restaurant or picnic in the garden at St. Savior’s. Then she’ll shoo him to his brewery to make potions, or allow him an hour for a nap before pulling him along to a show at the theater or a soiree or a ball--they all blend together. Before long, the first week of January has passed this way.
“We’re not pets, Harry,” Ginny points out, quietly. “You understand how this sounds?”
“And we saw a Muggle. That was my first time seeing one up close.”
“Alright,” Draco whispers.
Dad gives him a sidelong glance. “How has that been, by the way? Sometimes I feel like leaving you all alone with him is a bit like throwing you to the wolves.”
“No joke! If you went poking around in some archives you’d probably find several dozen photos of me just popping away.” Harry snorts.
“Me, either,” Draco says, relieved that it isn’t just him.
“It’s not like I don’t know,” Harry continues. “I just ran out of questions to ask.”
So, of course, Draco is not expecting the Dark Lord himself to sweep into their quarters with no prior announcement. Draco thinks it’s Harry at first--the wards protecting their quarters are configured to admit only the two of them, and the sound of the various locks undoing themselves in their incredibly specific order is familiar by now.
And the thing is, Harry can’t give his word, not really. He has the Dark Lord’s ear and his hard-earned trust, but all decisions on his part are final, and Harry’s already irritated him by asking for too much as it is.
He jolts in surprise, and then settles. None of the house staff would dare disturb him without announcing themselves first. Sure enough, Harry climbs in, still wearing his heavy, dark Death Eater robes.
It’s not uncommon for Draco to wake up like this, these days--like all of existence has narrowed to the ache of lack in his body. Warm, heavy hands sweep down his sides, and as Draco squirms against soft bed sheets below, a rumbling chuckle meets his ears.
Draco lets out a thick, keening laugh. “Oh! What have I done?”
“Enough, Mr. Weasley.” Draco answers, primly. “
He obligingly lifts a foot when Harry works a boot off, and then the other. His socks follow. There’s an intimacy to this. Harry likes doing it. He understands where Draco is coming from.
I've done a pretty good amount of planning for this and I’m excited to move forward with plot and the world, so I hope I don’t sound silly or ungrateful when I say that I hope you guys don’t mind if every chapter doesn’t have smut LOL. It’s likely a non-issue, but as you may have guessed, I’m kind of a worrywart.
“Grandfather, have you thought about talking with Aunt Andromeda? She and Nan spent a lot of time together, you know, um. Before.”
As they walk, Theo tells him of nightmare spells and scrying and blood magic just a technical step away from necromancy, the latter of which is a jealously protected school of magic illegal for anyone who has not acquired a license to practice, even Death Eaters. The curse Draco had used had been found amongst an entry dedicated entirely to ritual sacrifice.
,” Alecto says, injecting theatrical breathiness into her voice.
“Oh, love,” Harry sighs, big warm hands curling around Draco’s aching shoulders. “You must be in so much pain.”
They share a look, clearly annoyed. Harry rolls his sleeves up. He can tell the exact moment they see his Dark Mark--their expressions shutter into neutrality. Murmuring their apologies, they take their leave.
“Daddy,” Draco whines out.
Lucius tilts his head in agreement. Then he gives Harry a severe look. “I can’t help but notice my Draco is in St. Mungo’s.”
Her baffled response is to ask why someone would hate their own legacy. He shrugs and says he thinks maybe his blood isn’t pure enough. She tells him, in all her infinite snake wisdom, that this is perhaps one of the stupidest things a human has ever told her. He agrees.
“I’m close,” Draco gasps.
“Listen, I’m trying. It’s just--you’re so different.”
“Can I ask you something? About the war?”
His magic rushes outwards in a fierce push, knocking the headmaster off of his feet, books and teapots and artifacts flying off of shelves, and the silvery liquid of a nearby pensieve bursting into the air in wispy trails.
“Your Mother is waiting for you in the leisure room, sir,” Gemma says, as she fusses over his wavy hair. Ever since Harry mentioned he liked it, he’s refused to suffer anything other than the slightest bit of product.
Daddy rolls his eyes. He pinches Lily’s cheek, quick and playful, and takes her new clothes up to her room.
Would it be deception to duplicate it? Draco has been using the doubling charm to create extra writing ink for himself since Aunt Bella taught it to him as a child, hoping he might frustrate Father toying around with it (and he had). But duplicates have a limited life span. Merchants have been given the Kiss for selling doubled items to buyers. A child might accept the excuse of old age leading to wear and tear, but Father, who will most certainly ask his grandchild to wear the ring while teaching them their family responsibilities, would not.
They walk back to their quarters in silence. As they step inside, Draco reaches out to hold both of Harry’s hands in his, thumbs worrying over Harry’s palms.
As Harry was hoping, this pointed question chips away at some of Draco’s insistence. He flushes, and leans back.
Draco smirks at her. “Even the ruffians?”
, baby,” Harry breathes out, his thumbs pressing along Draco’s rim on either side. “Is that for me?”
Draco smiles and reaches up to arrange Harry’s messy fringe into something presentable. “But I don’t feel that way, you silly man. I just think you’ll all need space.”
Because Father has a sixth sense for when they’re up to no good, it doesn’t take long for their shouted insults to bring his wrath down on them. Scorpius is kicking himself for forgetting Father's brewery faces the cottage’s expansive backyard garden, with a window open to vent potentially dangerous fumes.
“Only you,” Harry agrees, pulling off, his voice scratchy.
“Harry, there’s something I need to tell you.” He whispers.
The first to fall is Watcher, bound by a jelly-legs hex of all things, but not before he blasts Yaxley with a stunning spell powerful enough that Harry is convinced he’s cracked his skull when he falls. The preliminary is over.
of the various Smith progeny in his age group. Calliope Potter, according to gossip, was a sweet-tempered Omega woman with a surprisingly powerful singing voice. Story after story follows. Harry is related to far more people, and some of them far more recently, than he ever would have expected. Soon the photos run out, and Draco’s reserve of stories begins to wane the further they travel up the tree. Pureblood families form and die out with the same frequency of tides rolling in, so finding records on a family that had been disgraced because of the actions of its heir had to be a monumental task. Draco refuses to tell him how long he’s been working at it.
“Of course,” Draco sputters. It takes a lot to shake his composure, and Harry’s not surprised that being caught in the middle of familial drama is the source of it. Harry has always gotten the impression that he has an unshakeable faith in his parents’ word.
He takes Draco’s hand’s in his, thumbs rubbing comforting circles over the knob of his wrist bones. Draco shuffles back in Harry’s lap to see him a bit more clearly and takes a deep breath.
“A picnic?” Draco asks, face lighting up.
Draco sits down, eyes welling with frustrated tears. “So you’ve established that I’m a disappointment. I am not sure what you expect me to do.”
Harry has risen to his feet, leaning over to prop his fingers on his desk.
Draco chuckles. “Yes, though I made a proper fool of myself.”
Draco’s completely silent when he comes, shuddering apart as his cock jerks between them,  splattering hot release over Harry’s abdomen. His hole tightens and his teeth sink into Harry’s collarbone. The world twists in a dizzying array of colors and lights, and it’s only when his knees sink into something soft that Harry realizes he's apparated them back to their bed. His orgasm creeps up on him, shooting out so powerfully that it almost hurts. Harry fucks in deep, pressing his knot securely inside Draco, who squirms delightedly and nuzzles into Harry’s neck.
Mother sighs and strokes his back. “Just listen to everything he says, darling. And you better give me this, too.”
The door creaks open behind him, and Harry turns around, prepared to snap at Bolotin if she’s returned with more unsolicited advice. What he sees, though, is a dark-haired young man with a baby in each arm. The faded mark on his neck clearly denotes him as an Omega, though one sleepy baby palming at his half exposed breast through his thin robe would have been just as good of an indicator. His eyes widen at the sight of Harry, and he begins babbling in Russian, freckled face reddening. Harry looks quickly away.
They all exchange polite goodbyes, and Harry crosses the shop floor to retake his place at Draco’s side. He bashfully lights up when Harry links an arm around his waist and plants a pecking kiss on his lips.
When the time comes for them all to leave, Harry insists that Draco be the first person to step through the floo.
“You have on too many clothes,” Draco complains.
“I didn’t know,” Draco admits. “It usually doesn’t come on like this. I swear. I’m sorry, I would have told you—”
(See the end of the chapter for
"You need protein," Harry keeps saying.
A surprising show of bravery for someone like that. Draco breathes out, loudly. “Remind me to send him a thank-you.”
“Are you alright, darling? Come here,” Mother says, beckoning Draco over. “Oh, you’re shaking. Here,
“You’re impossible.” Draco says, at length.
As if he was waiting for permission, Harry begins pounding into him, pulling him back onto his cock. It takes only a handful of thrusts for Draco to tense up, his fingers clawing into the wall against the rapidly building fluttering in his stomach.
“Well, you mentioned my Father. I don’t think--I can scarcely stand to be around him these days.”
And then he’s taking off his scarf and throwing it around Harry’s neck, fussing and tutting. Sirius tries and fails to act like he doesn’t wish Malfoy was putting the scarf on him. Harry waves goodbye as Malfoy drags him off to whatever function he’d arrived to collect him for.
Without thinking, Draco says, "Can we order from the Chinese restaurant you like?"
It is customary for newly wedded couples to be playfully gifted with the waxy white berries from mistletoe, each one signifying a kiss to be shared in secret. Draco remembers arguing with his friends over who would approach who first, and then staring longingly at the exchange of these berries as a child. Now, as he watches Harry fail to hide his confusion when yet another giggling young person presses a white berry into his hands on their way to someone else, he wonders what his younger self would think.
Aunt Andromeda and Nan didn’t really look like each other as much as Aunt Andromeda looked like their other sister, the one Lily has only ever seen in photos, the one who’d caused so much pain. They have the same dark, curly hair and heart-shaped face, but Aunt Andromeda’s hair is streaked with grey and her resting expression is this wry little smile, accentuated by laugh lines when it grows.
“It’s nothing. Just a disagreement.” Harry sighs.
If he knew it were a muggle’s composition, Scorpius bets he’d want her to stop immediately, no matter how lovely it is. The thought makes him laugh.
"And?"
“Potter, a little birdy told me you brought your Omega to the duels,” Alecto says, around a grin. “Every day with you after Beltane makes him more and more adventurous, don’t you think?”
"The towel was too much, so I tried to use magic and I bullocksed it up. Please be careful in the washroom."
Tailoring is one of the few careers an Omega can have, granted they have permission from a spouse or head of household willing to foot the bill for licensing and upkeep. Seeing the natural camaraderie between Draco, the tailor, and his young assistant scribbling busily away in her journal, Harry wonders if he hasn’t contributed to Draco’s loneliness.
Al knows they’re a little sheltered. After everything their parents went through, how could they not be? The Potter cottage has been under fidelus charm for as long as he can remember, and he has one too many early memories of being accosted by especially advantageous members of the press. His first year, he’d cried for half the journey to Hogwarts because it meant not having Dad’s home cooked food, and no family quidditch, and especially no sleepy sideways hugs or Father’s distracted forehead kisses. Being the child of famous people builds a thick skin, but he still has moments where he wishes things were a little easier.
“Of course I want to, sweet boy,” Harry says, kneeling on the bed. Draco hasn’t even seen Harry’s wand this morning, but his clothes are falling off of his skin like water, slithering lazily to the floor. He can smell the magic in the air, Alpha and ozone. “But you’ll have to take what I give you this time.”
“You’ve had us here playing house with snobs while they stare and stare and you supposedly try to help Fred, but it just feels like a whole lot of nothing!” Weasley says.
“Does that surprise you? It’s not so uncommon. I’m unsure of what the papers said, but our marriage was arranged. Neither of us had much of a choice in it. I was fully expecting him to be--well, it doesn’t matter what I was expecting. He has only ever been kind. I feel very blessed to have him. He makes me laugh, he takes care of me… I can only hope I make him half as happy as he makes me.”
“Daddy, please don’t leave,” Draco whispers, curling his hands around Harry’s biceps.
“Do you mean—?”
“I love it,” Harry answers, and the lack of hesitation is more affirming than it has any right to be. “Do you?”
And then he releases Draco, shuffling back on his knees. With a shuddering breath, Draco falls forward, hands fisting in the sheets below.
“Merlin,” Harry says, and his voice sounds a bit more distant than it was a moment ago. “You and these lacy knickers.”
“Give us a kiss,” Harry says, pursing his lips obnoxiously far.
"Remember how you told me silencing charms can wear off when your magic goes all haywire?"
Their trip back to London is a quiet one. There are quicker ways to go back, to be sure, but Harry bought train tickets instead, so they can arrive at their destination well-rested and somewhat emotionally prepared for the return.
Hermione laughs, and Ron lets out affronted noises, and though Draco privately agrees, he also thinks that, "She's just perfect."
Lily is staring at him with her keen gray eyes. She’s always been able to suss him out pretty quick. “You think we should do it, too.”
As they plan, she butts heads with many of the senior Death Eaters, who don’t like being corrected on fieldwork. They, especially those within the inner circle, tend to receive more specialized assignments. They work well together, but not in significantly large groups. A junior Death Eater might get the chance to join in on those smaller assignments because of nepotism--Draco’s friends come to mind--but their operations tend to be separate. Forcing them to work so closely together is a sign of how desperate Voldemort is to conquer Russia. Harry’s never seen him so drawn and irritable in all of the years since he’s taken the mark.
“A lot.” Harry says.
EDIT: There was an inconsistency in the timeline I set up for this fic!!! In this AU, Voldemort has been in power since the 1980s. In the original version of this chapter, I indicated that the month was March, but that's wrong. It is currently November 2014, NOT March of the next year. I'm sorry! I'd been thinking to myself that Harry and Draco married in February, when Draco was eighteen, and have just been married for most of the year. Yet another weird mistake that you make when you write and edit as late as I do.
“Doing okay, baby?” Harry asks, as he carefully lowers Draco’s leg.
“Just wait until you get me on some whiskey,” laughs Harry, as they make their way through the long halls of the Citadel.
“Retire the heels from now on or I’ll go into the closet and repeat the process with every pair,” Harry says, cupping his face for a quick kiss.
After shooing her footmen away, she gives them a lively tour of her home--from the various lovely drawing rooms to the library (Pansy rolls her eyes at Draco’s obvious interest), to the ballroom that Sonja jokingly insists will go unused for as long as she’s able to avoid taking callers. She informs them of the only three rules. First, they are to speak freely. Second, if someone elects to pass on a subject it must be respected. Third, what is shared in the parlor stays in the parlor, or they risk Sonja making their lives very difficult indeed.
“Yeah?” Harry asks, swallowing thickly.
Draco is standing by the open window of the sitting room they’ve chosen for Anezka Newman’s impending visit. He hadn’t been thrilled about the idea of the last day of their short holiday being interrupted, especially by Anezka. However, it would have been foolish to pass up the privacy the Potter estate offers.
. From where I was sitting, it sure did sound like you meant it. Did you mean it?” Harry asks, gently.
“No, silly boy. You smell like me,” Harry says, more than a little smug about it.
The thought of doing something like that again is abruptly the worst thing ever, and there's this creeping loneliness that's making his throat feel tellingly thick, and that just won't do. So he marches to the fireplace in the living room, reaches for powder, and sticks his head through. He's allowed to reach the office assistant because of his listing as one of Harry's emergency contacts. (With a pleased little hum, Draco remembers how unthinkingly Harry had penciled him in as they curiously pored over his application together.) The assistant, whose name Draco forgot on purpose, is a mousy little omega with eyes too big for his face and a terrible flirting habit. Draco has never liked him and does not like watching Harry interact with him at Ministry events.
“I understand. A mother’s work is hard. Thank you, Draco, for fulfilling your responsibilities. Truly, well done. I hope that you can remind your husband of his own.”
Draco’s stomach drops. He clears his throat. He has the strange urge to ask if he is in trouble, like he’s some first year at Hogwarts again, being exasperatedly scolded by his Head of House. The Dark Lord has always been in the periphery of Draco’s life. Draco has been in his presence more than the average wizard, as the child of someone in the inner circle. But such intimate meetings with him were rare, and the last time Draco spoke with the Dark Lord in close quarters, he was faced with a warning for passive failings. Who is to say what will happen for his reckless and deliberate disregard for the rules that govern his life?
Draco scowls at him, cheekbones pinkening. Harry grins.
“What hurts?” Harry asks, voice sharp with concern.
He reaches up to wipe the tears from Draco’s face, which elicits a bashful fit of laughter that has Harry grinning despite himself. Then he tilts his head and presses his nose against Draco’s neck, where his scent is the strongest, taking a deep and greedy pull. Draco tilts his head back on a sigh, and when Harry kisses him there, delighting in the way he can feel the pulse rabbiting beneath, he winds his arms around Harry’s shoulders and presses himself close.
“These are new for you.”
They deflate into an over warm heap of shaking limbs, Harry spurting thick ropes of come inside his channel. Harry’s kissing all over his throbbing mark, hands trailing up and down his sides before locking with Draco’s once again. He’s heavy, but Draco likes it, feels safe and settled under his Alpha’s weight. It’s not like he has to tell him that, though.
Then he turns on his heel and marches for the doors. On his way out, he pauses briefly at Michel’s faded portrait. The man himself is missing (as is his wont--Draco has only ever seen him once, and he hadn’t spoken), leaving behind only the nighttime backdrop of a vine-covered swing hanging from a tree in a moonlit forest.
Viktorovich shrugs, pursing his lips. “One of us will die soon. If you, nothing to worry about. If me, maybe you tell your boss and make everyone very uncomfortable with each other back home.”
“Have you heard from the servants you were working with?” Harry finally asks.
He feels his rumbling chuckle more than he hears it. “Not this time. Up you get!”
Then he sobers and squeezes Draco’s arm. “Take it or leave it, Draco. I’m serious. If you can’t agree to that, I forbid you from attending, ever. Okay?
Draco steps close, clearly in need of comfort. He squeaks in surprise when Harry lifts him up into his arms, heading for their quarters, then wraps his arms around Harry’s neck. “It just doesn’t seem fair.”
“Milicent’s not a mistake! And--and her brother is a little toad, and he won’t be half the heir Milicent would be! You’ve seen her interacting with us. She was even at Hogwarts! Doesn’t that mean something? They wouldn’t suffer any old Half-Blood at Hogwarts…”
“Your Dark Mark, that’s what.” Black says lowly. When Harry does not move, rooted in place by shock, he shouts, “SHOW ME YOUR DARK MARK!”
“I did not see her name on any of the lists.” Lucius answers, bringing a hand up to his mouth.
“Do you think--should I not go?” He asks, hesitantly.
Harry grins lopsidedly at him. “No one is going to believe that.”
She’d caught his eye the day of the bombings both as Draco’s guard and because it was the first time he’d seen a metamorphmagus in years. Then she held his attention by being one of the loudest, clumsiest creatures he’s ever encountered. He’s heard other Aurors mentioning her in scoffed undertones and exasperated questions about this or that patrol, giving Harry the general picture that she’s someone tolerated for her skills, but generally not well-liked. He’s been in much the same position for over a decade.
She bows to him, and then to the proud form of Pius Thicknesse, and sweeps down the corridor, shoulders tense. Draco watches her go and wishes he’d found an excuse to follow her. Then, he murmurs a greeting to Thicknesse.
“You teach me that this instant, Harry Potter!” he shouts.
Slughorn is still as cheerfully sycophantic as ever. Even though Harry’s potion skills have taken a merry nosedive, being the Boy Who Lived Twice is apparently a decent trade-off for the fluke of his prodigy. Slughorn had been unreasonably delighted to find that Harry and Draco found their way to each other during the year-long break everyone in their year had been afforded. They’d fallen in love over letters and floo calls and gifts, and then impulsively bonded the moment they were able to see each other face to face. Harry hadn't regretted a single moment.
“I mean it, Harry. I will leave you,” Draco lies. He’s pettily, vindictively thrilled at the panic that crosses Harry’s face for a few euphoric seconds, and then he breaks into a tirade of babbled apologies. “I wouldn’t. I love you, I didn’t mean it…”
Another thought pops into Harry’s head. “Langlock. How do you know that?”
None of them are as subtle as they likely think they’re being, and Draco quickly decides not to comment on it. If they don’t think him smart enough to pick up on a little conspiracy, then so be it.
“You realize that you have literally asked me to have a third child in the name of your pride.”
Once there’s a lull in conversation, Mother takes his arm once again. “That spell certainly wasn’t in my curriculum when I attended Hogwarts.”
“Your proud creature-in-law, Lucius,” Harry says, pulling Draco against his side.
“That’s not a terrible idea. They could serve as a buffer for the pogrebins. My contact says the forest is teeming with the things. They're not very strong, but they can be a nuisance if they're not dealt with quickly.” Dolohov muses.
Finally, one last thing. I lived in England for a few years when I was younger, but I've since moved back to the States. I'm sorry for the awkward mishmash of terminology. I hope it's not distracting! I get way too shy about asking other people to read my stuff while it's in progress. I tend to just post it and hide. So please forgive any strange narration or mistakes. I do my best to clean them up when I can.
“It’s for you, love. Need to start early with Unspeakable training, no?”
The drink is filled with all the extra marshmallows Scorpius pretends he doesn’t like, and the warm smell of it curls in his belly. Scourgifying his teeth to enjoy it to the fullest, Scorpius scoots up on his bed, pulling his duvet back so Father can perch beside him.
Harry gives Aunt Bella a smirk, such a rare expression on him that Draco stares unashamedly. “Count me in.”
“No, my lord,” Draco says.
Harry lets out an entirely undignified snort when Draco finally manages to shake him awake.
“Still. That wasn’t very nice of you.” Harry warns him.
She steps aside and stands a few feet away with her hands linked behind her back--it’s about all the privacy she can offer them, even with Harry’s status. That had been mandated by the Dark Lord himself. It is a wonder the former members of the Order are allowed any visitors at all, especially now.
Then he tries, fingers scoring gently through her scalp. She lets her eyes fall closed. After a moment, Father leans over to inspect it. He declares it absolutely dreadful, which makes her giggle, and breaks the odd hesitant tension lingering over the three of them as they laugh too.
The ghost of an unfriendly smile curls on Lucius Malfoy’s lips. “I’m your grandfather, boy. You may as well call me that.”
“Let alone a Half-Blood,” Harry guesses. He doesn’t sound very upset, but the plain way he states it makes Draco feel rotten anyway.
“We’ll just--we’ll work on it together. Somehow.”
It’s not exactly a surprise--the Death Eaters have been systematically toppling Eastern Europe for months now. Still, it’s a scary thought. Draco swallows. Harry gives him a sad little half smile, like he read Draco’s thoughts. He places their finished plates on the little work table in the center of the main kitchen, and then he’s smiling and helping Draco down from the counter, hands firm on his hips. It’s a tiny little thing, something he’s done time and again, but as Harry sets him on his feet with a smile, Draco realizes that he might be falling in love.
She retakes her seat in her plush office chair. She’s a small woman, and Draco can’t help but smile to see her sink into the fine leather, smiling all the while.
Harry guides him around as he protests quietly, his willpower visibly weakening with each pretty dress, robe, and row of neatly displayed fabrics Harry exaggeratedly points out. It seems like the battle against his stubbornness is almost won, and then someone politely clears their throat behind them, and Harry sighs.
“Certainly not. I can call my wand to me, or stir a cauldron, but I’ve never done anything like he does.”
Draco brings his free hand up to his stomach and glances down. “We’re going to have a lot of problems if Mama can’t change your nappies without fearing that you’ll curse him blind, darling.”
Very aware that this is an act of bravery, Harry wordlessly reaches for the zipper of Draco’s robes and pulls down, revealing inch after inch of alabaster skin. He kisses the back of Draco’s neck, and follows his hand down with soft presses of his lips. They reach the end of the zipper, and then Harry holds the folds of the robe out so Draco can step out of them, all long-legged beauty. And though Harry wants to spend more time memorizing the scope of that beauty, he coaxes Draco forward, pressing his front onto Draco’s back. The boy all but melts into the desk, clearly delighted to take his weight. They stay this way for a while, Harry running a covetous hand up and down Draco's side, gentling him his scent and presence. After a moment, Draco squirms and says he's ready, arching his back and pressing the round globes of his arse against Harry's prominent erection.
It’s hard to imagine Knockturn as anything other than the elegant shopping plaza that it is. Its steep pathways and dark cobblestone separates it from Diagon proper, but it’s a well-kept and respected center for anyone searching for a variety of products: magical artifacts, literature, and ingredients for traditional rituals, components for Wheel of the Year celebrations. Draco has many childhood memories of curiously watching his parents puzzle over items amongst atmospherically lit shelves and then smiling indulgently down at him when he piped up with his usual questions--he hadn’t been allowed to touch most of it.
“It’s not my fault Umbridge will do anything to brown nose,” Harry says, which sends Draco into another fit of laughter.
Even from a distance, and with his charms erected, the acidic stench of the poisoned forest is powerful enough to make his eyes water. His glasses fog over immediately. As is usual for him, he affixes them to his face with a sticking charm, spells them clean, and takes it all in. There is a sickly pink haze settled a few feet above the ground, obscuring it from view. The spindly, blackened limbs of dead trees reach high into the air, stark against the hazy morning sky. All around them is dead silent, and the powerfully lingering traces of magic sends gooseflesh rocketing along Harry’s skin.
“Not your niece, I’m afraid,” Harry says, hesitantly. “But it is your godson.”
If there's one thing Al inherited from his dad, it's that he doesn't give up. So he takes a deep breath and approaches. Draco holds his gaze unabashedly, though he does soften when Al sits beside him and takes his hand. "What kept you?"
Harry pulls him close, and soothes him into a pleasant haze with kisses and sweet nothings. As Draco settles on top of him for a rest, he glances out past the bed’s curtains to the window. The sky is darkening, losing all traces of the blended colors of sunset.
“You watch your tongue, Black,” the Auror hisses.
“Daddy…” Draco says, pressing his face into Harry’s pelvis.
After gathering the packages in his arms, the Muggle gives them both quick bows, gasping apologies all the while. The people assembled part for him, more out of disgust than respect. He shuffles away. He must feel all the eyes on his back like an extra package of his own, Draco thinks.
“Look at me while I’m fucking you, Draco,” Harry says, draping those long legs over his shoulders so he can press closer, grind his knot against Draco’s rim each time he’s inside, press insistently into his prostate.
“They’re tender, Daddy.” Draco reminds him. They’d discovered as much in the hospital, when Draco crying out had attracted a worried staff member to his door.
"Um, I. Er, I'm sorry," Al babbles, as Draco leans forward and nuzzles his face against the seat of Al's trousers.
“Here’s the floo address for where we’ll be,” Harry says, pressing a folded paper into his hands. “Pop your head in whenever, I don’t care if it frustrates them.”
This is literally not a pairing I've ever thought of before, wow. This was fun! Thanks for the prompt!
She reaches out for him, and he winces as her dust-covered hand brushes against his skin, sending a frisson of pain shooting down the side of his face all the way to his neck. She withdraws her wand and uses a healing charm on him. The pain lessens into something less sharp.
Draco smacks him on the shoulder, but his cheeks are dimpling like he’s trying not to give in and laugh. His hips are still rolling absently, and there’s a bright-eyed interest in his eyes that Harry knows well by now. Harry lightly squeezes his arse, and the look darkens with desire.
When one of the Citadel’s house elves knocks on the door of Harry’s study to announce that a visitor they don’t recognize is calling on Draco, he determinedly commits to pretending he is still asleep in his nest. He sleeps with his head covered when he’s not sharing a bed with someone, so while he can see out of his veritable cocoon of blankets, it will take effort on anyone else’s part to see
“That doesn’t sound like a very fun game,” Draco huffs out, even though he can feel himself releasing another embarrassing rush of slick. Harry rarely denies him anything in bed, and yet the thought of this is making him weak.
They’ve built a little routine, in this odd Christmas break. They spend time together, and sometimes one of them will accompany Daddy to the restaurant, and they stop by the Burrow and play around with the family until they’re sore and their bellies are aching from Molly’s food and how much they’ve laughed, and then they come home for dinner. Grandfather will engage one of them in frustrating conversation--or in Lily’s case, none at all--and then retreat into his room, visited mostly by healers. He ignores Daddy completely, and sometimes frustrates Father so much that he’s summarily banished from all the rooms he frequents. He’s kind of miserable and out of place. So she decides to pose the question when it’s quiet.
He wants to say something about the wish, about the diary, but he can’t. When he thinks about trying, his throat closes dangerously. Still, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t a million other things he should say.
Draco nods his head, not trusting himself not to say something foolish.
“Draco. He’s the child of one of your cousins, actually. Narcissa?” Harry ventures.
“It was no trouble, really. Mother had dealt with him by the time it all sunk in.”
He curls one hand around Draco’s shoulder, pulling him back as he lines the head of his heavy cock against Draco’s entrance, pushing slowly but insistently inside. He lets out a low groan, and then hisses when Draco impishly clenches around him, just the way he likes it. No one in here will be tricked into believing that this is their first time, Draco thinks. He locks eyes with Theo Nott, who’d had to take up the mantle as his family's head Alpha after old Cantankerous was killed fighting for the Dark Lord. Theo had never been especially subtle about his desire for Draco. Draco had delighted in the attention, and enjoyed teasing him, but never had any real intention of indulging him.
Harry reaches out for him, and squeezes his shoulders. “No, you don’t. Listen to me, Draco. I don’t like to share. You’re young and beautiful and focused. I don’t care what your mother’s told you, you deserve to see the world and, er, dazzle them all.”
“Excellent work!” Slughorn says, “Excellent work indeed!”
Draco sighs as Harry trails more kisses down his neck, scenting him with single-minded focus. Then he huffs out a short laugh, reaching up a hand to slide his fingers through thick dark hair and scratch at the scalp beneath. “Well… at least we made a fashionable entrance.”
“That’s good, baby,” Harry sighs, fucking into the soft, warm grip.
“Hello, my son,” He says, completing his turn. His face is blank. Draco’s heart sinks.
James’ favorite newspaper clipping is of dad standing outside the Ministry in casual clothing, tiredly running his hand over his face, before mouthing the headline, “My obligation is to myself and my family first.”
“Did you like it?”
3: With my semester coming to an end, I'm hoping to have more time to write, but I simply cannot promise a regular schedule of updates with my erratic life. I'm seriously considering withdrawing from my Master's program for my long-term mental health. If I do, that will require a lot of restructuring, planning, and money saving (I.E. more work hours). Hope this double update will make up for what might be another long break.
“Daddy, please,” Draco murmurs, frustration mounting.
He tilts his head back, clearly wanting a kiss, and Harry captures his lips right as he slides in on one slow thrust. Harry groans into his open mouth, and Draco laughs lightly. It trails off into a low moan when Harry slides almost completely out and pushes back in.
Draco swallows. Show time. He sits himself next to Harry, who puts his arm leisurely behind him.
Draco casts a cooling charm on his poor, affected tongue, immediately reducing the uncomfortable feeling. He adds the onions, garlic and pepper to the syrupped bacon. He picks up the eggs and separates the whites from the yolks. He adds four yolks and two whites to the cream in one of Harry’s colorful bowls (this one is bright yellow with turquoise stripes) and gently whisks them slightly fluffy, before draining the pasta and putting it with the bacon into another bowl. It has colorful dragons on it, flying around and breathing adorable puffs of smoke. The dragons look at him appreciatively, as if they agree with the recipe he’s making.
He slowly undresses again, taking care to hang the garments gently in his wardrobe. He showers, puts on his clothes and makes himself a cup of tea. He has the weekend off, but wishes he could go to the office. He feels restless and a bit nervous. Why is he going again? Maybe he should cancel. Yeah, it would be best. If he’s this nervous about it, maybe the time isn’t right yet. He walks over to his writing desk and starts writing a friendly note.
I retract my head, so I can look at him. ‘I bumped into Ginny. I don’t for a second believe that was by accident. You have got one hell of a power-woman at home, Harry. You are a lucky man.’
Harry unshrinks the parcel. His hands tremble a bit in excitement as he opens it. Dean can work magic with clothes. The package reveals a dark green pantaloon and an off-white poet shirt. The fabric feels lush and soft. There is no glitter, nor feathers, but the fabric seems to have a pearly shine. Harry finds himself drawn to it, the need to stroke it overwhelming. It feels soft, cool and sensuous. There’s a note underneath.
I laugh. She must’ve deduced it already.
I try to tell her I shan’t, but my words won’t come out. I yawn.
He smiles. ‘Seventeen. With marble floors and golden doorknobs. Why did you summon me?’
People are watching him from behind their masks. Eyes follow him wherever he goes. He’s not sure why, but he senses he’s an exception here. He feels entirely too innocent, too blue. He makes it to the bar and orders a glass of water. Best not cloud his judgement with alcohol, he thinks. He receives a gorgeous crystal tumbler, filled with water and slices of peach.
Draco seems to be thinking. Earnest eyes find Harry’s. ‘Yes. You may.’
A sad look flutters over Malfoy’s face, so quickly the untrained eye would’ve missed it. ‘I guess this is goodbye then.’ The smug smile is back. ‘I hope I haven’t spoiled you for the long line of wizards you’ll fuck after me. I set a very high standard, or so I’m told.’
‘Oh love, you’re going to eat all right. Just not of a plate. Filthy things like you don’t deserve fine porcelain, do they?’
I thrust in a few times. He takes it and doesn’t seem to make any move to escape. I had expected him to bite or scratch me. Maybe he wants me to make it a bit easier? He is bound, after all.
Harry gives him an unrelenting look.
Ever since Harry left the aurors to become ‘wizard’s greatest crime reporter’, a title the media gave him and which he hates, he has stayed connected to the force. Not all aurors are as friendly towards Harry as Ron is, since he outed corruption scandal after corruption scandal on the QNG. Harry likes to think it has made the world a better place to live in, but he’s sure not all ministry workers feel the same. Still, he wouldn’t have it any other way. His work gives his life a new meaning.
‘If you want to, get on your knees in front of me.’
‘Yes, Merlin Ginny, Yes.’.
‘Ready?’ Malfoy’s hands strike his arse and lower back, the gesture is gentle.
The Count presses his full body weight on Harry, snapping him out of his thought. He slides himself over Harry a bit, spreading the spunk, while looking at him with that smug, amused smile. ‘Don’t worry. I like it.’ Harry feels his spent cock twitch. Wow, that hasn’t happened since he was a teenager. ‘It gives me a reason to show you my pretentious uptown brothel bathroom next.’
Harry’s eyes are dark. ‘Like this?’ His thumb applies even more pressure to the throbbing spot on his ankle. Draco moans. He must be out of his mind, but with the pain comes arousal. He sees spots, but he’s not sure if they’re from the dizzying speed his blood is streaming to his hardening cock, or from the agony in his ankle.
A car passes his street, lighting up the strangers face for a moment. Malfoy. Harry keeps his face schooled, even if his first instinct is to yell out in surprise. He sees Malfoy has noticed his recognition nevertheless. Harry stays silent. There’s no sound but the ticking of his clock.
She seems to sense what going on in my head, as her expression softens. ‘You thought you didn’t deserve to be happy?’
‘Fucking move!’
‘Do you like what you see, Dray?’ She asks me between moans.
‘I know. I don’t care.’
‘ I can’t breathe. I’m not sure if I want you into my mouth this deep’, he whines a bit.
‘I’m sorry, I didn’t know it was yóur play night.’ I bitch, as I want to make a fuss, but then Slytherin nature kicks in and I realize Harry has to make it up to me big time. Besides, he looks like he’s having a blast with Gin. ‘I’ll leave soon, but I have to know. Which one of you was bound for the gag? So I can wank at that though, seeing as I am being deprived of my sexual encounter with Harry.’
‘Also, I think honesty is the key word here. I’m going to floo Ginny this evening.’
Ginny looks up: ‘No threesome. I’m sorry Draco, that’s something I’m not ready for yet.’
‘Are you alright?’ I ask her. She shakes her head. Tears are welling up in her eyes. She bites her lip. In her forties, she is still good looking. She has a boyish charm, a childlike openness that is somehow very attractive. I can see why Harry is still with her, even after all those years with all his undoubtedly countless fangirls trying to get into his bed. And men, a small part of my brain provides, don’t forget the countless string of men. Maybe that’s why they’re breaking up.
‘I’ll try.’
‘I can’t see, Draco. I think I’m blind.’
‘Do pay attention, Potter, it wasn’t me who was doing the fucking.’
I nod. No use in denying the obvious.
The Count smiles at him. ‘Thank you, Saviour.’ Harry’s eyes widen as he pushes the Count at arms length.
Narcissa is waiting for him. ‘She left a portal here, Mr. Potter.’ They enter one of the manor’s many parlors. Harry looks around. The parlor looks brighter in comparison to the rest of the manor. All the antique furniture is painted in a pale, blue color. The hardwood floor is sanded and finished with a light lacquer. The dark blue ceiling has rows of glinstering, dancing stars on it. ‘It’s Draco’s room.’ Narcissa tells him. And it would’ve been a lovely room, if it weren’t for the ugly, roaring portal of light in the middle of it.
‘Comfortable?’ I restrain from rolling my eyes. Always the knight in shining armor, that one.
‘Some journalist you are. Okay. Suit yourself.’ Malfoy raises the gun again, his finger on the trigger. Harry sees a flicker of hesitation. ‘Why don’t you challenge me? Where is your fucking spirit?’
He steps into the dark green pants. They cling to his toned legs and fit his firm arse like a second skin. The trousers, he likes. The poet shirt he’s not so sure about, he thinks as he dons the off-white thing.
He checks on Rose, the monitor spell shows her still sleeping soundly. He tiptoes through the living room and leaves Hermione a little note, with a thick slice of fruitcake he found in a pantry and a pot of her favorite cherry tea under a stasis charm.
I spell the door of our bedroom shut with an ear deafening bang, like the mature grown up I am. I fling my iWiz on the bed. Fuck, my knee hurts. The familiar throbbing pain jolts through my kneecap and makes its way to my hip. If only this fucking injury would go away, I could play again. In the air, all the build up frustration could get out. Now I’m stuck here, writing for the Quibbler about a sport I love so dearly. Feeling sorry for myself, while my husband is angry with me. Way to go, babe!
‘Move, please.’ Harry’s voice comes out rough.
Does he think that? No, most certainly not. He loves the way Harry is open about his preferences. The easy way he handles his desires, how confident he is, how selfsure about his body, knowing exactly what he likes and dislikes. Barely audible he whispers: ‘I wish I could be as confident as you are’.
The wizard looks at him while they twirl across the dance floor, his gown rustling as Harry spins him around. When the songs finishes, the wizard trails Harry’s mask. He leans in and whispers in Harry’s ear: ‘Such a shame, dear. You’re already spoken for.’ He gently nibbles his earlobe. Harry shivers as he retreats from the wizard.
You’re gorgeous.’ He hears Harry tell him. ‘Yes, he is, isn’t he? The most gorgeous thing I ever laid eyes on.’ What the?
‘Yessss.’ Malfoy tells him. ‘You’re not as stupid as I thought, are you now?’ Harry looks him in the eye.
I’m silent for a while. When I talk, my voice comes out more gruff than I intended. ‘I’m... I’m not good at sharing, Mrs. Potter.’
He shakes his head. ‘I wanted to.’ He looks away. Blush forming on his cheeks.
‘Are you here all by yourself?’ The man asks.
Knowing he shouldn’t, as he ate too little today and he feels exhaustion pull at him, Harry nods despite himself. He wants to prolong the company of the Count a little longer. The champagne tastes of peach.
Compose yourself, Draco. You know what mother told you. If they have knowledge they will use it against you. I take on a neutral expression. ‘Why do you want to know?’ She must never know how betrayed I felt when Harry choose her over me. No one ever must.
‘I won’t miss this shitpile of hair’, he mutters under his breath.
‘Oh no auror, please.’
Malfoy grins as his finger breaches Harry’s hole. Harry gasps. Malfoy kisses him again while his long, slender fingers expertly work him open. ‘I’m ready.’ Harry tells him after the second finger enters.
“Sir, with all due respect, because honestly, you have been so kind and I don’t particularly want to go somewhere else… but how did the school...decide to put me here,” Harry spoke cautiously with lots of confused pauses.
“Come on Harry, come talk to us,” Neville begged but Harry still hadn’t even turned around, he didn’t want to talk to them.
“We should get back, I’m sure Pansy giddy with joy for as long as we’ve been here,” Draco smirked and slid out from behind Harry so he could help him up.
“Well, that was quite bad,” Draco mumbled as they made their way to Professor Binns class
“I messed up...I - I knew I shouldn’t have. I was bad…” Harry looked
Harry, Draco, Vincent, Greg, Blaise, and Pansy all grabbed brooms from the Slytherin shed. Harry had his firebolt and the others all grabbed one of the gifted nimbus 2001s that they had received during Harry’s second year.
“I’m not at liberty to discuss a student’s personal life without his consent. Excuse me, Minerva, I have a meeting to attend.”
Lupin pulled Harry into a much gentler but just as nice hug when Sirus finally let go. “Anything at all Harry, if you need either of us - we’re there. I promise.” Remus smiled as they let go.
and Harry tore into it excitedly. He knew only his Godfather would call him that name.
(See the end of the chapter for
“And you - I thought you hated me, all you ever did was make me miserable and now… you’ve done more for me in 2 days than any of them have in 5 years. Why did we have to hate each other for so long, why did the bloody sorting hat listen to me, I was 11 I didn’t know what was best for me. I begged it not to put me here because everyone I had met told me that I was destined for Gryffindor and I didn’t want to disappoint anyone. Why did it listen, I was just a kid, I-” Harry’s sobs took over again but he didn’t bother to stop them. Draco pulled him in closer and held him tightly, he tilted his head so they could look at each other as he spoke,
“Yeah bully for you, mate,” Is Weasley’s sullen reply.
“What?” He asks.
AKA Draco Malfoy and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day(s). A quieter chapter, but I hope it doesn't disappoint.  Please see end note warnings, as usual
“Either the sea or the prisoners, Mr. Potter, sorry for the lack of warning. You get used to it after being on rotation for a while.” The Auror squeaks.
Draco peeks out at the study from his day bed.
), only to headbutt and kick and scratch when she’s within his range. He’s absolutely vicious. Many wizards find it uncouth to fight with anything other than their wands, and Rosier’s face is twisted into a look of disgust that reflects this. Losing one’s head in a duel, however, can be a death wish.
“How about we cut some of the sponge cake from last night?” Harry asks.
“That’s it, Draco,” Harry says.
Draco speaks for the first time since they began. “Is Mr. Blishwick involved in this?”
Milicent Bulstrode pops out next in a burst of green flame, looking miraculously unruffled. Harry’s brows rise at the sight of her. She’d been given a position training Muggleborn soldiers in battle tactics, more as a courtesy for her Father’s returning to Voldemort’s side than anything. The well-known story was that her father had been keeping her Muggleborn mother hidden in a tightly warded section of their family home, only to turn her over without a fuss when a servant tattled to a guest. Milicent is talented at her work, despite the nepotism--enough that some in the inner circle have grudgingly commented on it. Harry’s never seen her in action.
The rest of the proceedings carry on in a blur. When it’s time to leave, Draco begs off of leaving with his parents or friends and clings tightly to Harry’s arm as they go. He looks down the entire time, his hair shielding his expression. The moment they are free too, Harry apparates them outside of the Citadel.
It would be difficult for someone who wasn’t looking for it to notice, but Draco has already become a bit softer around the edges. There’s a flush to his cheeks and the slight curve of his hips is growing right along with his belly. He’s always been slender--pointy, Harry had uncharitably thought once, on their wedding day--and that hasn’t changed in any tangible way, but the evidence of their little family growing is somehow both soothing and scary. How will he ever be able to protect them, in a world like this? How will he ever be able to keep them together? They’d been this close to slipping through Harry’s fingers and he’d been none the wiser right up until the last minute. Feeling his eyes sting tellingly, Harry kisses Draco’s forehead and watches him sleep.
“Quite morbid, those muggles,” Mother sniffs.
“Are you alright, love?” One of the older Omegas asks, rucking his robes up with his hands and kneeling beside her.
“Teach me how to cook,” Draco insists. “You cooked for me last year, I want to make you something.”
see a Healer to ensure you didn’t catch anything, dear girl, I insist. They’re sure to fast track you through St. Mungo’s if you explain what happened.”
“Harry. I hear you unseated my dear Bella in the duels.” The Dark Lord says.
“Thank you,” Draco murmurs, taking a hearty sip.
A cool, frantic puff of breath hits Harry’s skin, and then Draco relaxes the tiniest bit, tongue working the underside of Harry’s cock. Harry cups his face, and begins a quick, shallow rhythm. Draco’s tongue swirls over him as Harry fucks into his mouth, eyes fluttering closed into a truly blissful look. His faint moans vibrate along Harry’s sensitive head, his length twitching in response.
It is mean spirited, but he gets a particular rush out of saying, “Fuck me, Alpha,” because he knows Harry has a weak spot for being called that. Sure enough, Theo's pupils dialate, and Draco's words earn him a particularly heavy thrust from Harry. He can see Theo’s adam’s apple bob as he swallows, his jaw clenching. Draco winks at him, and then turns his head, curling his hands into the sheets for purchase as he fucks himself back onto Harry’s cock. He’s deliciously thick, dragging against Draco’s sensitive walls like he belongs there. He relaxes when Harry pushes in, heavy balls slapping against him where they’re joined, and squeezes tight when he pulls out, dragging low moans from Harry’s chest. He can feel the beginning of Harry's knot swelling at his base, and it all but ruins his rhythm, his sudden desire to chase it.
, kill rape and maim
“And I’m not sitting around letting my friend stay in jail,” Weasley continues, a strange thickness in his voice. “I’m not--I’m not bumping elbows with people who want to kill me. I’m not playing pretend in my big fancy houses and traveling the world on murder missions.”
“Did you ever think you’d end up with Father? In the middle of it all?”
The partners glance first at each other, and then at Harry. Davies looks pitying, and Beauregard tired.
know is that you’ve both been through a lot, and I also know from experience that it helps to be around the people you went through it with.” Harry answers.
His apologetic smile softens when Harry playfully pokes the tip of his aristocratic nose.
His attention is drawn by someone yelling his name. When he looks over and sees that a reporter is jogging over to them with a large camera in hand, he gives Draco an exaggerated look of exasperation, mostly to make him smile. It has the desired effect, and Harry can hear the reporter saying “Yes, perfect!” as the corner of his gaze is overtaken with an annoyingly bright light.
