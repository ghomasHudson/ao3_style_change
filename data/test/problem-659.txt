“I shall take my leave as well,” Eileen also stood. “The dinner was excellent as always, sweetie, I just wish I could say the same for Ed’s companion.”
He could go from flirting to a grieving father in a blink so well, Harry had his suspicions he was completely honest.
“But I love my husband, and I can just leave him!” Eileen understood what needed to be done, but she also seemed like she couldn’t handle her role in the plan.
” Severus climbed off the chair, standing in front of Harry. “I don’t mind boring. And Draco can also come.”
But had he any other choice yesterday? Or now?
That was when it hit him. BGI!
“She is
Draco got hurt fighting the Aurors and her, Harry barely escaped to send the memory back in time for himself, haunted by the memory of Severus kicking and screaming when his mother Apparated away with him.
“I know we wanted to travel further today, but maybe I should go to that interview and see what happens.”
A smile! Harry couldn’t help himself but smile back in return.
It was a
“Of course,” Harry said, but by the time he could have kissed Draco, the blond got up to change his clothes.
The more he thought about it, the more he couldn’t believe it. He was so deep in his thoughts, he almost jumped when Ron spoke up.
“Don’t even think you can stall me.”
Draco couldn’t say he loved the 60s New York, with all it’s big-city glory even,  but they only planned to stop there until they got the legal magical permits they needed.
It was never so tempting just to Legilimens someone without them knowing, but Ed wouldn't.
“I would say I’d come with you, but I have no desire to see any of the future,” she said. “Maybe you could ask Matt…”
Harry smiled, thinking if their such luck should continue, maybe they could recruit Eileen to watch the kids for just a night, and go on a date someplace nice. That, or sleep 16 hours straight, locking the doors to their bedroom just once.
“Well, probably not today, it’s getting late,” Draco noted, even though he had slept so much knocked out by the potions he didn’t at all felt tired.
“See, you already get my humor! My mother doesn’t, and she knew me way longer than you.”
“This is my home, in case you are wondering,” Severus gestured around. “Ed will also come, he’s just probably got held up. So, what do you want to know?”
And what do you expect Tobias will do now if he gets drunk? He’s even more dangerous now if anything.”
But maybe thinking that if nothing terrible happened in the last three months, it’s not a sign of how something even worse was in a making, and he really should believe it, he thought.
Next morning they were back to normal, only after breakfast, Harry apologetically looked at him.
“Are you a relative of Draco Malfoy? Is he here? I need to talk to him. Now.”
“Malfoy—”
“You can leave him with me, I’m sure you could use a break,” he told Draco, while Severus was already taking the neat pile of books apart next to him.
Harry just gave Draco a warning look because of the tone, making Malfoy dial back on it a notch.
“Ouch,” Harry noted, acting fake-offended as if he wasn’t used to Draco’s quirks by now.
“I think he Apparated here straight. I think he wasn’t even examined at the Mungo, or elsewhere, he just barely could muster the strength to come home,” Hermione explained quickly. “Because otherwise they probably would have kept him.”
Harry did go to visit the recovering Ron - the redhead was completely recovered, but pretended to be worse just so Hermione would stay a day at home with him - he did end up talking with Hermione.
“You could also move in with us,” Harry tried to mention that as softly as he could.
“You don’t mind if I take a look into what’s inside this, do you?” he tested Malfoy.
Here is what you need to know to read on: They somehow manage to get out of the room, let's just say.
Draco also wanted to buy better clothes for Severus. Eileen was working now, and they could just as well tell Tobias it was from her paycheck as long it wasn’t a fancy garment and it could pass as a Muggle style, but that didn’t go as he planned.
“I understand. But we’re sitting ducks if Eileen comes until we can’t get out, and we never had difficulties with the physical side of things.”
to accomplish your goals. This was what his son was sourly missing.
+the idea of the development stages, I stole from developmental psychology, but just barely scratching the surface of it.
“It’s all your fault! If you didn’t come here in the first place-“
Draco certainly couldn’t teach Severus simultaneously while taking care of Edwin, who couldn’t speak yet, no matter how he was 4 and had to be watched constantly because his newly returned magic sometimes produced quite dangerous situations.
Only to almost curse a stranger in the kitchen to pieces until he registered that the stranger wasn’t dressed, and most probably Ed’s wards let him though because they had spent a night together.
Draco laughed.
“Me and Ed seeing each other every once in a while? Nine years? Maybe it’s closer to 10.”
“We can live anywhere, and I could still Apparate and work here.”
“I don’t care about that—” Harry tried to tell her, but that was when she went for her wand and both him and Hermione flinched.
“I am only doing what
He needed to take care of Severus, and yelling at his birth parents was not a way to achieve that, no matter how it would have been warranted.
Alternatively, Draco might be dead. That would explain why none of the searching spells yielded any result.
Draco Malfoy was the most boring yet most pampered being on the face of the whole planet.
Only when he wasn’t back after the usual 15 minutes, Draco stood and tried to see where he’d gone. And the doorknob wouldn’t turn.
It was so tempting. Draco liked to bottom, but if he’d have Harry now, even if Potter ended up with Matt later, Draco would always be his first.
“I mean, he did kiss me just to laugh at me,” Harry said, but that didn’t help. Draco’s only scowled deeper, then, as if it was the most natural thing in the world, he stepped closer, and kissed Harry.
“I’m only here for another… 38 minutes,” Draco stated. “And what would we even talk about?”
“Wait a minute, you’re saying your artifact wasn’t only a meteorite by origin but must have been part of a bigger rock, which means there must be other pieces.”
She pushed her memories into Harry’s mind of last night, but all at once, which indeed make Harry nauseous. Not to mention, more concerned for Malfoy.
Memories flashed before Harry’s eyes of the dead, and the excruciating grief he felt, and the knowledge that as Master of Death, even if he bought back the people they have lost, like Lupin and Tonks and Fred, they’d be never the same as before.
Based on the descriptions, he expected hell and torture to be going on in Fayre’s mind, on a loop, one scenario worse than the other.
“I’ll try to keep it in mind,” maybe it wasn’t such a good idea at all, Draco was sure he’ll get bored to death.
“But enough of this friendly chit-chat,” the Death Eater remarked with a real frightening smile. “I know how Draco Malfoy shares your bed every morning, and how, in a woman’s form, he’s pure precious to you, Harry Potter, and I have your girlfriend now. What are you willing to trade for her? Your life? Your friends’ life? Both, if you’re stupid enough?”
“Right,” it seemed Harry was out of the conversation, turning away from Draco, and if had any thoughts at all regarding the topic, he kept it all to himself.
Only one chapter after this one, guys!
“Admittedly you only started meddling with time because you knew I couldn’t let you go into the past alone. So even if it would seem like I made the first move, you only performed the spell when I got there because you wanted me to interfere,” Harry, however, stood his ground as well in the teasing.
“You could always tell him tomorrow. He’d never know,” Hermione offered.
People in this era didn’t look for his faults, direction or reactions. Of course, this also had a price: Harry had also left all his friends behind who survived. That’s why he wanted to return so badly.
“You have ugly clothes too,” he pointed at Harry, but all that was forgotten, when Eileen Apparated right next to them. First, she checked if Severus wasn’t hurt in any way, then hugged him close, with tears in her eyes, telling him he should never do something like this again.
“I gave Severus mine,” Harry admitted. “After I sampled it, of course.”
Merlin,” he offered. “But enough so Dad can have a fake nervous-breakdown only to forgive you by the time Lucas arrives, and Father can have a serious talk with you about your life choices, and I can have your head for not telling me.“
“I so do not have that,” Harry protested meekly.
I think I'll update every weekend, so once a week by the way. Hope that's okay!
“And you didn’t want me to watch this memory for it meant something to you. I wasn’t just a one night stand, you’re just a damned good actress…”
All of this, therefore, was her fault, so she had to fix this. Fast.
His mind started processing the information he got from the examination. Four minutes and Ron will be dead at this speed.
“Well, it’s too late now!”
“You know nothing—”
"Okay, so I know what to do," Harry decided.
Somehow, Grimmauld place had a mind of its own.
Memories of another attempt, his tomorrow.
“Jeez, Malfoy, you’re flashing!” Harry scrambled the other way, shielding his eyes but it was too late. “And this is my room!”
For now, he got a starters kit of Potions in one room, asking Severus if he wanted to try anything that was in the Potions books they read.
Even Draco had a couple of interesting discussions regarding magic, an unexpected plus because he didn’t think he’d find such a highly educated group of wizards and witches in the past.
“Hi cutie, what’s up? You look sad. Can I cheer you up? I’ll buy you another,” a random girl offered, and she looked nice. Harry thought how he could use the distraction from the Malfoys altogether, so he just nodded, and the girl just looked even better when she smiled at him in return.
“Obviously,” Harry muttered and decided not to let Malfoy’s comment or the ruckus of the last five minutes get to him.
I felt like helping Draco out a little in their relationship, and what better way to do it in this fic than across time?
realize I want to do nothing with your father, don’t you?” Harry asked, for all he did receive was a look from Fayre. “And I can’t take you from here.”
“Believe it or not, I had time to rethink my decisions, and I much rather would give up both my boys willingly if I knew they would be cared for than have this future,” she said.
Harry was better directing Mindy what to cook for Severus, while Draco always took better care of telling Mindy what to have for dessert.
They even tried ambush Mindy and Pinky when they delivered the food, but that only resulted in the elves now spelling them asleep when they came in.
“Of course, consider this my official invitation,” Ed told him, but he wasn’t even listening to what he was talking about, his mind racing somewhere else. No, Lucas was only talking about the weather, right? Right?
At least, he could get really wasted. A couple of girls were already eyeing him too, if not his lovely date, but he could go to someone else’s place tonight… And forget that damned Lucius Malfoy, and how he did manage to humiliate Harry without even really doing anything.
Potter was lying because the truth was so bad he couldn’t even tell a convict. Now-now, who would have thought a person could enjoy a sweet torturing People’s-Favourite-Hero even from prison! Lucius could hardly hold back a content smile. He was enjoying this.
Back in this time, all this didn’t happen yet, but if Eileen knew somehow they were in the US for sure, then they couldn't just stay.
“Remember when it first happened? I thought you were having an affair, and maybe he just thought about how he missed his mom. But once we had to escape, we not only protected Severus as one but also shared a bed, started spending more time together, agreeing even if it’s in our nature to otherwise just fight and…” Draco saw when it Harry, so his voice dried up.
Like it was Draco who didn’t even speak to Severus since he got there, and avoided him like plague not counting the meals they all shared.
“Before or after the other you will try to curse me into pieces?” he sarcastically wondered.
Only when Sev let him go, did Harry see that Severus had his hair in two braids, and looked upset - beside cute, but Harry didn’t want to disappoint him further by smiling down at him.
“I won’t tell Harry anything today, and I’ve always known you had some issues trusting him. And that you were kind of an idiot if you ask me.”
“I ask you to leave then,” Severus just stood from the table, since it was his home, and he couldn’t just walk out. “I don’t want to be any part of this. And if anything, you’ll force Ed more into Lucas’s arm if you meddle.”
“As the house is confused about its owner, since both you and Malfoy should have it, it puts you together in a bed every morning, hoping to set you up, because if you two became a couple, the inheritance problem would be solved,” Hermione said. “That, or you performed some dark - Black - searching spell from the Black Library, and kind of unintentionally chained Malfoy to you forever, I wouldn’t know.”
They didn’t even notice how the locked door stayed closed, but the spells keeping it locked gave out once they were finished.
“Malfoys are marbles of beauties, or so I’ve been told,” said the blond, for what Harry only just burst out laughing.
“Maybe it’s not Severus who is unhappy, but you,” Potter said, and Draco shook his head.
He had to endure one torturous date after another over the years, and he only mentioned that he didn’t feel like any of his dates were his equals once when he felt like he had enough.
It was her old wand, eventually making it the Elder Wand Harry was holding. The Trio must have gone to Dumbledore’s grave first to get it before they came here.
Only, one day he woke up throwing up, and with memories that certainly hadn’t happened yet, but were terrifying.
“Don’t ask me. They either are preparing lunch for some animal that eats grass and live snails, or they are pretending to brew a potion, but the snails keep escaping,” he gestured at Severus, who in the big “cooking/brewing” got some grass on his clothes as well, not only in the cauldron. “But listen carefully.”
Except, it housed an extension charm, and though it was nothing like the Malfoy Manor, in which you could get lost on the corridors if you didn’t pay attention, it has been inhabited by a wealthy owner before.
“You know what I mean. The only reason I haven’t interfered picking out your clothes over the years because I’m trying to be less controlling and I don’t want Matt to lust after you even more. Or anyone in MACUSA.”
“Noone should wear the clothes you do! It’s not fashionable in Europe, nor America. Not even in the midst of Muggles.”
Since he had his doubts about how Malfoy would take a compliment coming from him (probably thinking Harry was insulting him sarcastically), he only held out his hand.
“Give us at least a day to say goodbye to Severus, you owe us that much,” Potter grabbed Draco’s hand as if he sensed what Draco was thinking again, stopping him. “And in the meanwhile, consult the Goblins in Gringotts to draw up the adoption form for your second child, because we’re going to take him in. We’ll negotiate the price you had in mind later.”
“Potter, it’s gonna be okay, just don’t let him get to you, will ya?” Fayre warned the Griffindork for what he surprisingly reacted well.
“It’s mostly fitting and I would—”
“But I—“
So right, after that, she was just pure tempted to have sex with Harry and she ended up doing it for real. All because she wanted to spy on him a little. How did she end up like this?
“I’m happy as long as I don’t have to magically intervene for two consecutive minutes,” Draco let out a sigh. “Which reminds me, Edwin hasn’t blown up any of his food in three days, so I think I’ll call that a success.”
A deeply buried Malfoy part of Draco wanted to own Harry in every way he could before he’d given up on him, just because they couldn’t.
“This is your fault, so don’t you tell me to calm down!” Draco turned on his heels. “First, it was your brilliant idea to free the wretched elves…”
So yeah, she was upset. Mainly because she thought she would never in a hundred Basilisk lifetimes feel jealous about Harry Potter and there she was doing just that.
“I didn’t…  I wasn’t trying to make fun of you. At least not in a sense you think,” Draco quickly said because Potter did seem close to cursing him again. And he didn’t want to die over this particular misunderstanding.
Should they run? Should Harry relive this day again, spying on Eileen when she would show up, trying to figure
“It’s only for a short time until I can get used to this era and find something better,” Harry tried to be optimistic. At least he would get payed for the tasks the Dursleys always demanded from him for free, that’s surely an advantage, right?
“Dear Merlin,” Harry laughed.
“Well, Eileen Snape came to visit while you were napping, and was convinced I was your boyfriend if not husband,” Harry turned back from the door. “So what does that say about you then?"
Just as he took a look at it, and Malfoy’s eyes followed Harry’s, Malfoy visibly flinched. So Harry got the sense that the small bag was Malfoy’s and somehow extremely important, yet he must have lost it when the crystal blew them apart.
“I was cold, and it’s not like I have any illusions how deep our animosity goes, so I decided to sleep here,” Harry gave him a look, and Draco couldn’t help but let him stay.
If the memories were failures and Fayre was trying to solve them, he’ll help her one by one, and eventually, they can be back in reality once again…
So he walked up to her without mental shields, hoping if she started looking into his head, she’ll see the grim future, and her future self, and maybe will let them talk.
“I can imagine I did since it would make sense,” and in a minute, they were kissing.
“I can’t just go back as if nothing happened,” he took the other side of the tub, still quite short for the both of them, but at least he could see Draco’s expression.
“If we only see a possible future, you mean.”
Then he returned to Eileen, ready to help her but also tempted to not help her at all, when he’d noticed she had a strong Disillusionment charm on. And under it, she was so badly beaten, she could barely stand. She looked worse than Draco.
“For the last time, you are not allowed!” Malfoy might have been angry, or embarrassed or both for his light complexion didn’t hide the blush that was creeping into his cheeks. “I’m the only Malfoy you’re allowed to
“And Draco isn’t here because…”
“No, we weren’t.” Hermione might have been cold being Ginny’s close friend, but Fayre didn’t seem to mind.
“They are happy. Some might say that matters more than even a supposed consequence you’re mentioning,” Harry told him.
“Their ever-evolving technology makes it a bit more difficult for us to hide. If our projections are correct, statistically speaking by the year 2000 or 2005, we won’t be able to keep the existence of magic from the masses.”
“Well, we figured after the kids left that it’s basically house-flipping, and I do love to repair old homes, or turn Muggle ones into magical ones, while you have a good eye for colors and it’s decent money for a common hobby of ours.”
And, plastered him to the closest wall, and kissed Draco with such an overwhelming force that for a second the blond even forgot who they were and what they were doing.
Severus would survive the trip, taken out of his own time. And who would care for him, you and the youngest Weasley? Because I would be in jail as a former servant of the Dark Lord, in case you’ve forgotten.”
“For the record, I was thinking if we do this, and then you leave me with two kids and Eileen behind, I’d marry Matt just to get back to you,” Draco stated.
But I also envisioned Harry renting a room in the Leaky Cauldron, and since it's not a Muggle establishment, I hope if their room had a bathtub, you guys can believe they could conjure enough water into it anyway with some Augamenti (Maxima) if nothing else.
“And if we going into the future changes said future, decide to go and find something else?”
Her captor had a lot of information about Potter and tried to get to him by his friends, but they were invincible enough not to be a problem, so he sought out Fayre because she was the weak link in Harry’s life, one which Harry himself didn’t even choose to be with, was only forced to.
They barely scored points in the end, and Harry saw Malfoy holding back, but Severus, who barely said a word in his presence so far was so immersed in the simple Keeper’s Game that he didn’t even notice, and kept telling Harry to go faster, to turn better, to not hold back. Catching the ball Malfoy had transformed from a rock himself, even throwing it to quite a distance, considering.
Thank you everyone for reading! I didn't expect it would take me more than 10 chapters to write this story frankly.
“See? Afraid I’m going to curse you at every minute! You are both so pathetic, fighting against Death Eaters and prejudice against Muggle-borns when in fact you have the same prejudice for the other side!” and all she did with her wand is to turn herself back to Draco Malfoy. Harry could still hardly believe it was true, but Draco was standing right in front of them.
“See, you aren’t as dumb as you look,” the girl laughed at him, and Apparated them yet again.
“And also a fair warning: if you talk too much, I’m going to have to spell you mute, or occupy your mouth otherwise.”
“Important people of other countries come to visit often,” Severus said. “And we have the fanciest tea parties.”
+ Sorry for the missed update last week, I had to rewrite this whole chapter 'cause - even though I have the whole plot already - the wording somehow wasn't right. Hoping it's somewhat better now.
Then, when Potter showed up with Granger and Weasley, she kind of got it.
“Show them,” she encouraged and took a step back. Draco would be lying if he said he didn’t grip his wand much tighter when Tobias took a step forward.
Then, when she was asking him some basic scanning questions, trying to decide which Healer to call, he got her wand and turned her
He usually couldn't be bothered how no one asked his opinion and would give you it anyway loud and clear. Just as he had an annoying habit of meddling into other people's personal business as if it concerned him, that's how he got to this time in the first place.
Draco had learned the constant yelling between Eileen and Tobias had already started, and given how often Eileen left the house with a black eye or bruises on her wrists and neck, he felt justified trying to save Severus.
Even if Harry might just leave him for this, he wouldn’t be able to live with this as a secret. And he didn’t want to pretend he wasn’t at fault either.
“They are cute,” Severus noted, along with Harry who just muttered something along the lines “I like the kid”.
Harry took care of the repairs around the house (still ongoing), while Draco handled the finances.
“Don’t go then,” he tried, but for that, Fayre seemed so upset that she even stopped with the frantic packing.
It wasn’t working, though. The small girl Fayre told him suddenly.
“I think depending on what we see, there might be risks I would be willing to take,” Harry - ever the Gryffindor - offered.
“It’s not what you think,” Harry tried to deny it, but she put up her hand to stop him. “We—“
Harry had a massive crush on Malfoy since probably forever but Merlin sees his soul, sometimes Malfoy didn't make that easy.
Draco’s mind was flooded by many things they could do, but if they were going to do this, he needed to take care of Potter, which meant he’d have to take control of Harry, but not hurt him physically, so most of the things for the first time was out.
“You!” a sharp voice came at him from somewhere. “You should not be here! Don’t belong here!”
Ed didn’t want to imagine, because he could, and somehow, he almost wanted to try there and then, and he wasn’t sober enough to not trust himself it wasn’t stupid.
“Let’s concentrate on the issue at hand, shall we?” Fayre, however, warned in a not too emphatic voice, and while she checked Ron’s pulse, she asked Hermione. “You said he was cursed. Why did you say that? Why can’t it be poison or something—”
“He sounds like someone I’d hate but also secretly envy,” Draco surmised. “Even if I have no right because I’m nothing like him, and if that’s what you want, I could never give it to you.”
Their room shared a door a single room which Severus happily took, leaving Draco and Harry with one bed once again.
Lucius bit his lip thinking. He had to be careful. Potter was the only connection to Draco he now possessed. He wouldn’t want to go too far with this, no matter how pleasantly amusing it proved to be. Also, he was right, it was something personal…
“I’m not sleeping with you, even if we never get out of here again,” Draco snarled, jumping to his feet.
“I don’t see how that’s a good idea,” it was Potter who could stay calm enough to say. Draco was already so furious it was better if he didn’t ruin anything quickly by speaking his mind.
“We still have to, to adopt Severus’ little brother officially. Once they sign and paid for the child, if it’s a Goblin-forged document, they can’t get out of it. And if we can prove they illegally transferred the kid’s magic to a Muggle, we can petition Severus isn’t safe with their either, and force his adoption as well.”
He didn’t count on how Potter was a Gryffindor, closing the distance between them next, kissing him. Making Draco fight for the dominance of the kiss, then almost have him on the dining table in return.
And lastly, he could help and meet other magicals, which was great fun - although, there was a witch who was
Harry could have yelled at the blond then, but only because it didn't sit well with him how Draco put himself in grave danger only to then pretend as if nothing happened, taking it too lightly.
“Then stop hunting us. I never wanted to separate you from either of your sons, only protect them, and we have plenty of rooms. If you undo the bond between Tobias and your son, your husband won’t be able to do magic to find us, and we can all care for the kids.”
“Of course he is, he loves spending time with you,” Harry said when he was the popular one with Severus, and they both knew it. “And he listens to you. I doubt he wanted to hurt the other kid, maybe he just thought dolls at their age were stupid.”
“Hey, we won’t let them do anything,” Harry noticed where Draco’s thoughts were going probably only by his frown.
“Do you want me here or not? My personal life has nothing to do with you!”
“If Draco is no longer the heir of the Malfoy line, how could he have used this? Also, Lucius never mentioned—”
“I do, and I’m telling you—!” Harry felt so frustrated because they were wasting time, and all he could think of was losing his best friend because of Fayre.
He was teaching Severus about a number of materials that could be used as cauldrons and the young wizard kept asking question after question, deeply immersed in the topic for about half an hour.
Harry figured how the cool Fayre kept when Harry bought another woman to his bed, must have been just a brave face Fayre put on.
“And what about your partner? Will he also respect my decision, even if it's not what he wanted?”
“We are married, and you must still need some rest,” Harry just rearranged the covers around Draco. “You’re so lightheaded, you don’t even know what you’re saying. I’ll bring you something to read until you’re feeling better.”
Draco pulled completely out and pushed back in one swift motion, but also angling his hips, trying to cause just as much pleasure as pain, if it was possible.
Harry didn’t care. He knew the risks coming in. Plus, if he shouldn’t be here, maybe there is something he can change and save Fayre’s life, right? Him being unexcepted here was a good sign, or so he wanted to tell himself.
Which reminded Harry how Eileen said she’d placed a tracing charm on Severus, one he also needed to break.
“You left yourself a letter,” she told Draco.
“Not to be rude, but shouldn’t you to get going? I thought you said fifteen minutes,” Fayre said, and Hermione almost dragged Harry to the meeting, but not without sending a thankful look towards Fayre first.
“I just wanted to say you should change into something else unless you’d prefer I Apparate you in your PJs,” Harry said. So that’s how they were now! Harry laughing at him. There was no way Draco wouldn’t get back him for it.
They sent Eileen not entirely as far as they had they could, so in a couple of years they could still check on her, so it was no surprise she was there.
“You may not have lost a relationship with her, but it’s still significant. You were still fresh from dealing with Laura’s betrayal when you got involved with Camilla, and then you were just fresh out of that heartbreak when you got married to Zare. You weren’t given the time to heal.”
“Goodnight,” Harry said softly as he closed the door between their rooms. His room felt a little too big without the Malfoys cuddled on his sofa, but he didn’t worry about it as he got into bed thinking of dragons, and eventually falling asleep with a smile on his face.
Unable to bear the disappointed look on his face, Harry flagged down an attendant who was walking by them.
“This curry is really good,” Scorpius blurted. “It’s been a while since I’ve had lamb. It’s a nice treat.”
And so, Scorpius sat down in the spectator’s gallery, worry gnawing at him about where his father might stay, and anxiety radiating through him at the possibility that his father might not even be released today. What if they sent him back? Would he be able to handle it?
“It’s not easy, being a parent,” Draco pointed out. “You can’t always tell what the right decision is in the moment.”
“I asked if you’d want to come to the pub with my friends. We all meet up once a week at the Leaky Cauldron. You’re right, I shouldn’t keep you a secret, and the pub will just be the easiest way to meet everyone at once.”
It was overwhelming, to say the least, and so it was with great relief that he returned to Draco’s office at the end of the week, having received an owl that his lawyer had returned and would like to speak with him.
Harry smiled - it really was a clever assumption based on what he’d just said about the fridge.
“You’re sure it’ll work?”
“It’s a high price we pay for keeping secrets.”
Harry shrugged. "Maybe next week?"
Scorpius watched his father shift slowly, until he was leaning up against the headboard of the bed.
"That's okay. My wife and I are getting divorced. That's why I've been coming to see your papa so much. We agreed that she can keep the apartment we were living in, and that I'll find a new place."
He brought everything out to the hall and was surprised to find that he already had replies to all his letters. The girls had all replied to his message, and his express owl had returned as well. Glancing at the clock, he realised he had about an hour before he was due at lunch. He grabbed the transfer form and signed it quickly before stepping into the floo and vanishing.
Scorpius shook his head. "I draw at Papa's office all the time. I wanna
“Harry? What’s wrong?”
“No, thank you. I’ll get going, and let you get some rest.”
Draco didn’t respond right away, and Harry worried for a moment that he may have upset him with talk of their school days. Suddenly, Draco leaned back in his chair crossed his arms comfortably and smirked.
“Really?” Harry was incredibly surprised to hear that, but relieved as well. “How did he do that?”
He had actually been keeping an eye on Draco all afternoon, but in a more literal sense. The man was very fit, and his arse looked fantastic on a broom. Harry had lost more than one round of catch-the-Snitch because he hadn’t been able to stop staring. It wasn’t just his body, either. Draco had a confident smile that made Harry pause every time he saw it. It was nothing like the malicious smirk he’d often received in school—rather than make him angry and agitated, it set him at ease for reasons he couldn’t quite explain.
As he Summoned a sheet of parchment to reply to Harry’s letter, he couldn’t help lamenting the fact that being an Unspeakable was lonely business.
anymore?”
I made my way to Hagrid’s hut,
“I thought pulling financial records was your job?”
“Bad day at work, mate?” Seamus asked, sliding a pint over to Ron.
“Stop thinking about the what-ifs,” he chided himself softly. “Silverthorn’s files are bound to have some evidence.”
He had just taken off his shoes and taken in the beautiful suite, when he heard Scorpius’ voice from the other side of the wall.
“That box is called a Telly,” Harry explained. “Muggles use it to watch movies and shows.”
Thank you guys for all your support! XOXO
So he decided to do something he wouldn’t usually do. Even with the cleaning spells, the thought of it didn’t attract Draco at all: a good enough distraction that might just keep him from getting too hard too fast.
So it was a kind of a trap with memories, Harry noted. Maybe if he could destroy them or something, would it free Fayre in the real world?
In the end, Hermione tried to grab her manually to end her incantation, but when she faced an invisible wall, so the only thing she could do was watch how Fayre treated Ron.
“Take your eyes away from me just one second, and I won’t miss your head this time, Potter,” came the reply, only Harry didn’t buy it. Malfoy was bluffing, even though Harry didn’t know why.
Took them both half a minute to calm down while Malfoy did charm some clothes on himself, and Harry looked the other way, dead motionless in the bed still.
He was just a coward, not even daring to tell Potter how much discontent he felt about the thought that Harry was trying to preserve that future so much.
As more time passed, the more Draco worried. Harry kept buying his newspapers, and alerted them anytime they were about to be discovered, but even when they kept away from magicals, sooner or later Eileen somehow always discovered them.
“Funnily, my father probably would have made me marry her. Severus was the only one who knew and accepted me,” Draco had to bite his cheek from carrying on with that thought.
“Well, let me tell you, sir, they will rip your reputation apart—”
There was a price to pay for it, however. He constantly had a headache and was confused about the small details of their lives, whether it happened, or it happened on a day they changed.
“We’re friends and first of all, she admitted it,” she said, now her voice even smaller. “But I figured it first out when I was researching why Grimmauld Place always put you two into bed together.”
He was so drunk he took the woman to his place instead of hers! Shit, what the hell will his date think? What will Fayre think? For the Dragon’s-Dang-Sake, this was not supposed to happen!
Eileen didn’t ask how, rather, she already started, and saw memories of Occlumency lessons Harry had with Snape.
“That’s all very nice and good, but a child needs consistency. We can’t just take in Severus for months at a time, until you figure things out again, just to have you take him back and—“ Draco started, but Eileen just let go of Tobias’ hand.
“It would be just for your money of course,” Harry winked at him, which promised something entirely different, making Draco blush.
“This has nothing to do with the past!” Hermione screamed.
“Does this also mean I’m allowed to kiss you?” he wanted to do it all day, and even now.
“You want to make me feel better by letting me do it, don’t you?”
Malfoy was a pampered softie, in a way, if we consider money. He always had plenty.
“I wonder if the Department Head Deputy should wear the same clothes I always do.”
I got so hyped not having to work for these 3 consecutive days (long weekend, finally!), that I have already written a double chapter update today.
“They are adorable together,” Harry said, and also considered a tea for himself.
Whatever Malfoy was doing, it was Dark Magic that used Snape’s blood, and Harry instinctively knew there was not much time left if he wanted to stop the spell. He tackled Draco with physical force rather than risking a spell when there already so much magic was lingering in the air.
It got especially scary for a minute when Harry also got a haircut - it was a tad bit harder for Draco to convince him about a new style given Harry’s experiences with Aunt Petunia and the nightmare when she was paired with scissors.
Ed, for the life of him, couldn’t help but wonder why would he decide to stay, just when before he wasn’t.
Now, old currency was pureblood-ness. The elite was who held the title. It was still important because it was a tool to see what kind of family the other party comes from since the families all heard about the others.
“Then can I ask you to do it for me?” Harry wondered. “And I’m sure Draco would be very proud of you also if you spent a little time with Edwin as well.”
“Even if what you’re doing is wrong?”
“Wait, Dra-wait,” Harry tried to keep up with Draco, who was now fumingly running away under the pretense of looking for the elves. “I wasn’t-I’m not dating anyone. You should know this as well, when would I have the time? I have been constantly working or spending time with you and Severus.”
Only, Draco had been waiting for him on the street by the time he was finished, carrying his new purchases.
“I thought we were talking about fake marriage, not one where you’d even seek me out in the future,” Draco mentioned.
Harry inwardly smirked.
The awkward thing was, even though the Malfoys did capitulate from the war in the end, Lucius was still put on trial and had been found guilty.
However, thinking about his home wasn’t comforting either.
Harry was so shocked that he first thought he misheard what Hermione said.
This must be how to be a Gryffindor feels like, Draco finds himself thinking one afternoon.
“How is he called?” one day, Draco couldn’t help himself but ask. They needed to get out there, and he needed to spend less time with Potter, so honesty to a certain degree couldn’t have been avoided.
“I want to see for yourself what kind of future he will have and decide if it’s the life you imagined for him,” Harry told her.
“Meaning I should change my behavior?” she asked.
“I just need to stay somewhere and this house is marked as one of the Order’s locations, therefore letting me in,” Fayre went back to English, explaining. “I didn’t realize it wasn’t empty and that we would end up like this.”
“Oh, I had many interesting fights, young Prince. I rode a dragon, fought a Troll, and faced the fury of a Transfiguration teacher who had found me outside my house quarters in the middle of the night,” Harry even changed his voice, only noticing later how much he sounded like Dumbledore when he was talking to young Harry. Keeping things from him, thinking Harry was too young to know. So he quickly stopped, trying to channel Remus a bit instead. “But the scariest of it all was a creature called the Boggart. I had met one living in a cupboard, and it shows everyone their greatest fear.”
It was such an overwhelming feeling to figure something out, he wanted to run to Draco with it, but couldn’t.
“I already gave him a Bezoar,” Hermione said. “Nothing got better.”
Harry went dark red and furious in a second, which was no good.
“Just be ready because when we find him, you owe him a hell of an apology,” he warned Lucius to seemingly get the last word.
For the Slytherin way, the situation was already too bad - a Slytherin would never be taken as a hostage in the first place. So, Fayre decided to go with the Gryffindor way in the situation.
Harry suddenly felt sorry he was so tired that they couldn’t do anything that night.
And while Draco didn’t pay attention to Tobias just for a second, he suffered a very harsh blow into his stomach next, possibly breaking a rib if not two.
“Harry, we need to get going in like fifteen— minutes,” Hermione said, and then blinked once, and then repeated. “Fifteen minutes. Please be ready.”
Harry performed a binding spell on the unconscious Fayre so that she won’t be able to move without him letting her, and turned to Hermione, who has been checking on Ron.
“We were. Or at least I was delusional enough to believe we were. But I’m glad it turned out we aren’t” Fayre told Hermione with an emotionless mask Harry has so many times saw on Malfoy, but never on Fayre. It hurt him that they have come to this. “Better sooner than later, right?”
“And, how much would you interfere with their relationship to make this happen?”
“We are leaving,” Harry announced. “And will discuss this in private first. Thank you for inviting us, son.”
“I have found two working brooms in the shed,” he mentally sighed, turning to Severus. “Maybe Draco could teach you how to fly, and I can watch you play.”
So, Eileen outdid herself, inviting the Brazilian Minister of Magic, who wanted to forge a political alliance more than even have a polite conversation, so Edwin decided to drink quite much just to tolerate him.
“If I ever reached up to your expectations about me, Harry, I would be someone totally different.”
“Which is how it has always been with you. How is that fair?”
“Which are?”
Although, the next morning at breakfast, their conversation was the most amiable they have ever had, and Potter seemed keen on keeping the promise of not bringing up their activities of the previous night in any way.
“I was thinking we could go to the US,” Harry sighed, shaking his head.
“Eileen,” Ed sighed. “She moved out of our home as soon as she had earned some money working, but…”
“So you like it this way,” Harry carefully said, trying to not seem too curious why.
“Would you stop?” Potter asked. “We’ve already tried everything.”
Then, her mind kindly reminded her that Harry had never even seen her apartment, so she could just take him home, and he wouldn’t even realize who she was.
Not until he Obliviated her, at least, or she could also alert herself.
“Generally I'm okay dealing with whatever shit life has thrown me into,” he told Draco, now not even Occluding the slightest, so he was an open book to read, and Draco could read that he wasn’t lying. “But sometimes it would be just so helpful to surrender and not think, not… decide about anything, just… letting go of being Harry Potter, who is supposed to lead the magical society to victory and not be treated as someone special.”
“Actually, no,” Harry tried to explain, but Hermione was always a fast talker.
“Why am I to blame for all this? I’m the one who got flashed!”
Fooling around in the kitchen with what Potter called cooking made him ask Draco to let him brew potions.
Harry saw how painful it was for her to even consider.
However, Harry was trying to get him to think it was his idea, using his promotion.
Harry kept himself from sighing again. In front of a Malfoy, it would count as a weakness, and you never show weakness before Slytherins.
“As long as you know I’m going to charm your appearance next, I trust you can figure it out,” Malfoy just motioned for him to do it.
An awfully stupid way, but courageous, and it might just surprise her captor enough.
“I’ll tell Mindy we would like to have an early lunch here instead of downstairs,” he decided, but that only made Draco frown.
Draco had to explain everything.
“Let Harry treat him.”
“I need to take him to the others,” was all Harry has managed to say then, making Draco jump, and grab a wand that wasn’t even his.
“You and Dad thought it was a good thing because it was a sign how she for the first time of her life could lead an independent life, but in reality, she only wanted to distance herself from us so we wouldn’t miss her too much when she died.”
With only a couple of chapters left I think, I'd like to thank all of you for your support! XOXO
Harry was always home after work, often entertaining Mindy, Pinky, and Severus by cooking something without magic for dinner.
“Oh-oh, already sucking up to me, Potter?” the criminal laughed. “And here I thought it was just our first real date.”
“So, can I destroy a memory here, maybe?” he asked, making the small girl frown.
“If you want my help, I have some conditions,” he said, ignoring Harry’s hand as payback for when Harry did the same. “First, we should go to Gringotts, I have too many valuables shrunk in the bag you already stole to be walking around with it.”
“I think it’s your success,” it was true. Draco spent so much time with Edwin, and Edwin also was the calmest when Draco took care of him.
Their plan was risky at best, Harry didn’t agree with it at all, but Draco insisted they have to earn Eileen’s trust, and the only way to do that is to show some vulnerability.
“There are a lot of things that could be scary, Severus. So why don’t we just ask the elves for some music, I’m sure your royal cousin and you can show me some dances of the court.”
“I will not push you. But I think at least you should be aware of what your choices really mean if you’re going to make them.”
“Yeah, Potter, me being gay meant I did sleep with wizards before. Not everyone can be a virgin at twenty!”
“And is it because Draco has more money than your parents?”
“I’m stopping it. It’s a Pvendriache,” Harry told her. “I’ve got this.”
“He’s immune to magic,” Draco heard in his head, Eileen probably being just as much of a talented Legilimens as Severus would be later, planting the idea in his head without alerting her husband to their conversation. “When he let’s go, you should run for the door and save yourself. I’ll distract him. He won’t hurt me as badly, he loves me.”
"We go to the Malfoy Manor, steal the crystal from your ancestors that still must exist here, and I take you back to the future with it. Easy," Harry said, but the look on Malfoy's face promised something else altogether.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can’t believe you fail to see the consequences of your actions, Malfoy,” Potter’s voice was resigned. “Even if I wasn’t worried, which I was, what did you expect to accomplish? You break into their family home in the middle of the night, threaten her husband, and tell Eileen to pack her things and her son because she’s coming with you, an 18-year-old stranger?”
“I… I really don’t know, it seemed more, but maybe it was like five minutes? I did run every healer spell I know first before going to you,” Hermione answered, her hands holding Ron’s arm, shaking. “I should have got you first, Harry, but I thought—”
“He isn’t that person yet, and I’d fight for him not to ever be. Just as Severus would, and you know that.”
Chasing cats, playing Muggle kid’s games, inviting others for tea-parties, which always made Draco smile, whenever he saw it.
“She was in your bed, next to you, for Griffindor’s sake!” Hermione managed to say just when Fayre herself decided to get up and met their stares at the top of the stairs.
Now that it has been laid out before him, Harry tried to grasp the meaning. Could this really be the case?
“Maybe I could help you with the house’s magic then,” Hermione announced. “To stop this from happening. It is an interesting area of old magic anyway and I am writing a thesis about the field, so—”
“And as I’ve told you already yesterday, it’s not about the money, but how we should keep our interaction with the locals to the bare minimum so we don’t change our future. Or would you prefer to go back only to find Voldemort wasn’t defeated, after all?”
When he first disappeared, Harry thought Draco would resurface after two days: as soon as his pocket money ran out he’d be back begging Lucius to take him back, no matter what. Maybe Lucius thought this too.
All in all, Harry was busy and didn’t have the time to be depressed about being even more famous, and at Grimmauld Place, he was unreachable to the media, at least. Also, he figured that if he didn’t think about the mornings, he liked Fayre.
Rather, how should they tell Eileen to go? Then, suddenly, Harry had a plan.
“Yes.”
“Or that’s what Eileen wanted you to think,” Harry’s voice didn’t even waver for even a second.
“What the Chamber of the Secrets actually are you doing?” Fayre asked, and Harry wondered if she knew that the chamber actually existed. She was from France, after all, she might not have heard yet.
“Fayre, don’t go—” he tried, but she just snorted without a response, and that made him even feel worse.
And she did, she even saved Ron even though Harry and Hermione tried to stop her from doing that, and Malfoy never especially liked Ron, did he?
“Like what you see, Malfoy?” Potter asked, and Draco found himself already blushing before he could quickly deny everything without a second thought.
Ed started drinking water instead of his wine next, hearing that.
But, it’s not going to happen. It couldn’t. They had more pressing issues. The Snapes were waiting for them in the Drawing room.
- just to get her to agree for both Draco's and Severus' sake - was so much worse.
They would be easiest to find in NYC, too visible, which they didn’t need right now.
“Yes, I do miss them.”
By the time it got dark, even the custom-charmed clothes were owled to them, Draco demanded to see all the items selected on him after dinner.
“It’s locked.”
with the incantation she was using to be Fayre.
Harry decided not to push the issue now when he didn’t even have a way to go back just yet.
Running into Harry in the middle of his lunch break, not even recognizing him, until she caught one nervous gesture, letting him go as if nothing happened, but following him straight home in the evening when he left.
If they would be too perfect, he’d worry. If there was a distance between them later, also. But this Harry… was his.
And Draco was already well aware of Potter’s dreamy, Quidditch-honed muscles sometimes showing through even those ill-fitting clothes Potter always seemed to prefer.
“Well, I’m still better than you!” she made a face and was at Weasley’s place quicker than Harry.
“But if we do that, we will get on the radar of Voldemort even if it’s just because he would want to recruit us. And good luck explaining all the Purebloods in this era who we are.”
So now that she had a wand, if she was fast enough, she could curse the man herself—
“I was here,” little Severus took a step further. “A wizard with flashy hair and magic came, and I was so happy because I only ever get to see Mum and Muggles, but he made everything go real bad… But I’m hungry and…”
"You do?"
“Yes, I’m gay!!! And so is Merlin only knows how many other wizards, it’s completely
“Or the next Headmaster of Hogwarts.”
“I need you to take him for a couple of weeks, even for the nights. I trust it’s no trouble for you.”
“I do eat human food most of the time. I just can do without it longer. But you’re right, I would be happy to join you,” he sat, and even put away all the paperwork he carried.
“Yes, but I wanted to rescue
“Oh, I’m sorry I want a better future for my child then just…
“It would be a different future now that our presence here changed everything. And even if it isn’t, we’d have Severus,” Harry insisted.
“Don’t get me wrong, it’s nice to be on the same page with you just this once, but-“ Draco was trying to explain how nice it was that he didn’t have to fight Potter with his restlessness this time, but that was when the Boy-Who-Lived stopped him.
“They have to hunt down magicals to work for them, so when he overheard I was a capable wizard who just arrived, he had at least 3 jobs in mind I could do,” Harry explained. “He might want me to do all three, come to think of it.”
“Would you like to? I’m only one-eight of a vamp, but when we feed, it’s supposed to release some chemicals into your blood that makes you feel quite… good.”
“I still don’t get it,” Harry just shook his head. But on some level, he must have realized because his expression wasn't pleasant.
“Actually, it was what you’ve told me you thought, Draco.”
“I just want to be alone,” Severus said.
“Three muffins,” he chuckled.
Draco estimated at this rate, Severus could achieve faster academic progress than his already quite famous past-self, but it wasn’t Severus’ studies that kept him up at night.
Then the Trio would have time to overpower him without anyone getting hurt, or even worse, Potter cursing the madman’s head off, but eventually destroying his spotless reputation as he had as the Saviour in the wizarding world.
Either one of the Golden Tiro gets hurt or a bystander in Mungo, both which Fayre vowed to protect.
“But with this new title, you think I should change something?”
Surely, even if he couldn’t read their minds and moods just yet, he must have heard at least the last sentence of their conversation.
“Oh.”
Still, Draco’s heart broke whenever Eileen came to pick up her son for the evenings, taking Severus away.
Warning! Mentions of age-gap and UNDERAGE (if you count a 17-year-old as such).
Harry tried to keep himself from feeling any negative emotion for Hermione’s sake. He placed his hand on the hand of the bushy-haired which, and partially as a distraction for her, partially out of his own, he asked although he couldn’t care less at that moment.
“Severus?”
“We can always fake-marry, adopt Severus legally, and socialize with wizarding communities outside Britain, so we would avoid the risk of running into your grandfather, or Tom,” Harry shrugged, making Draco stare.
“For the record, I’d only tried to Obliviate you, so you don’t mess up my plans further,” Draco said. “But give me the bag, and I’ll tell you everything.”
“Is that so? Weren’t you the one who
“Let me guess: we aren’t allowed to use magic either for the duration of this trip?”
with Blaise later. But Blaise was not Potter.
“Well, I’m not letting you kill him!” the witch however said.
“I still want you to see a couple of others, so you should. Or, I can always take care of stripping you,” Draco suggested, kissing into Harry’s neck.
Draco paid the Goblins a good amount of money to get rid of the Horcruxes once he got to know what they were from Potter, and the Goblins agreed, eager to keep the magical objects Voldemort used to make them - but if Voldemort shouldn’t be still around, why was Harry on the posters?
"We should also teach Harry," Severus then pulled Draco in front of Harry, who was sitting at the table still. "You did say, ma'am, that only today he can join us."
“And I could say I also want to work to make some money,” Eileen said. “Not because it would make such a difference, but it would give me a good enough reason when I tell Tobias.”
“I’m just saying—”
His father would have been proud. Although not as much knowing Draco was only using this special skill because he was trying to stop himself from crushing on Harry Potter’s morning hair too much.
threw yourself on me when I was trying to just mind my own time-traveling business alone?” Draco inquired making Harry laugh.
“I might not be Saint Potter, but if you ride with Severus, your balance will be off, and you’ll be much slower,” Malfoy now smiled an evil smile, which Harry didn’t know he could miss.
“I have to be more patient,” he announced, as if being generous. “But you have to look harder, Mr. Potter. Draco is all I have left.”
Harry didn’t understand a word, but tried to make some sense of the conversation by asking.
Harry, who feared flying curses and yelling coming in to talk with Malfoy thought he should accept his luck and quickly leave, before Draco’s understanding turns.
“And if I don’t want someone like that around Severus?” Draco found himself asking. Edwin didn’t get a fate he deserved, but Draco would also fear for Severus’ safety, letting him close to a dangerous brother.
“There, nothing, and I tried three times,” Fayre said, which made Harry laugh.
“And whatever gave you the idea to do that?”
“I’d better get going. Don’t wanna be late from my first day,” Fayre said and disappeared before Harry could say another word. She was definitely not over the happenings and Harry didn’t know what could he do to change that.
“That’s payback for the last time,” Harry announced, pulling away from him, but it didn’t take a sharp eye to see how Harry had to force himself to stop when he did, and not even the Draco could deny a part of him also wanted more.
And, if Draco wasn’t feeling bad enough seeing Severus' agitated state, it was when Potter chose to waltz in.
Fayre so many times angered the trio with comments like this that she knew they didn’t have much time and it will go sideways soon.
It all went wrong when she - as a good little Malfoy which she wasn’t even anymore - noticed that Potter was getting ready for a date.
He could go back to any date, they haven’t missed an issue… Although, given what happened with him and Draco, he certainly didn’t want their last night to disappear.
He braced himself, yet, when he landed, he was in a marble seat, in a garden that was more beautiful than other people's home. The garden of the Malfoy Manor.
“I do have a couple of ideas,” Harry agreed after his first shock. Some ideas that he had to Occlude pretty hard away to the back of his mind when the kids were back for summer.
“You want Lucius out of your contact list so much?” the witch teased, and Harry waved a no with his head.
“Well then, Harry Malfoy, tell your partner that I know he stole my child, so he should come out and talk to me before I go in and burn his house down if necessary to find my son.”
“WHAT?!” for a second Potter’s reaction was so intense before he handled himself that Lucius knew he hit a nerve, he’d just have to figure out what way he should twist this to figure out really what happened. “No, I didn’t!”
Which would have been flattering, and Harry would have walked away, probably going to another market from that day on to avoid complications.
“I’m here to save you. And your son. To give you a home you both deserve,” the blond wizard found himself arguing while he also used a spell to magic some purchase under his feet, using it as leverage when he next pushed Tobias away.
And with Harry’s new hair, and what it seemed like the hundred-thousandth boot Harry tried on, it all came together.
It was getting so out of hand Harry couldn’t believe it wasn’t obvious to Malfoy himself why Harry was doing it, but so far he didn’t demand Harry to stop, so he didn’t.
“You have been told that by your father?”
He kinda wanted Malfoy next to him every morning. Not because of the naked thing, Merlin’s underpants no, but because he kinda wanted to have back the friend he had as Fayre.
Alas, back to the plan, Lucius.
He tried all forms of communication. Asked the little kid to help him, but nothing really happened. Then Harry tried to intervene.
“I did, but it’s not like reading a couple of financial reports would wear me out,” Draco announced. “Which I would like to do if you don’t mind…”
So, since all the books told how the curse locks people in their heads and never lets them go, playing cruel tricks on them - Harry decided to use the Elder Wands’ power to enter Fayre’s mind.
“Just so you know, multiple people told me that! Usually older wizards because they were the ones who saw me naked, not my father!”
Harry and the rest of the survivors were collecting the dead after the battle. He was still hurt as well, but there was a body he couldn’t let anybody else bring back to the castle.
Finally? I hope you're all happy to see where this is going, guys! XOXO
“Anything?”
Ron was on the floor, crying out in pain, incoherent.
“I messed up. And for that, I will hate myself forever,” Hermione said very sternly. “But you have to see how I was a nervous wreck, and how Harry shouldn’t lose you because of my mistake. Stay.”
Harry gulped angrily at his lemonade, thinking the effect might be a bit more intimidating if this was anything other than lemonade.
Ron slid into the booth next to Harry with a loud groan. Hermione gave him a sympathetic pat on the back, as if she already knew what was ailing him. Harry sometimes wondered if they had a Legilimency connection to each other, since there was no way she could actually know what it was—Ron had just arrived at the pub straight from work, and all Hermione had received was an owl saying “held up on a case, gonna be late”. Figuring it was a married person thing, Harry turned back to the basket of chips he was sharing with Neville.
“What the hell did you do?!” Malfoy yelled when Harry opened his eyes, and they were definitely not in the Shrieking Shack anymore, and Harry’s locator spells somehow didn’t work, when he wanted to check where they moved.
“I thought it was obvious,” Draco admitted. “I’m sorry, maybe time cannot be changed, after all, if you just look at Severus’ life.”
“I know,” Potter said, surprisingly, when Draco expected a lecture if not some resistance, given that they weren’t Severus’ parents.
“Yes, but not everyone can have natural blond hair and blue eyes.”
For a moment, Harry almost thought Snape would reduct House Points soon, or start yelling at him for something he had done, but when Severus caught his line of line easily and just smiled at him.
Harry realized she was right, in the sense that comforting Hermione could come after they had managed to save Ron’s life. Fayre was so rude about it though!
But Severus was a half-blood, Potter as well, and Draco didn’t feel as if he was better than Granger for instance. If anything, the witch was smarter and more capable, although Draco would never admit to that with Potter present.
“Very much so. See you in a bit kid,” he called to Scorpius, before turning and walking into Draco’s office. He’d been surprised when he’d come here for the first time, almost four months ago. He’d expected an opulent, Slytherin green office, possibly dark and cold like the dungeons at Hogwarts had been. Draco’s office, however, was bright and airy, tastefully decorated in very neutral tones of brown and cream.
Leaning against the door frame, he contemplated his options. If he was being really honest with himself, he didn’t want to search Draco’s flat. Draco no longer felt like a rival that Harry had to get ahead of anymore. That nagging feeling that he was up to something seemed to have dissolved at some point over the past week.
"So now what?" she asked, tears in her eyes. Harry hated that he was hurting her, but he couldn't stay married to her. He barely knew her. "We married now Harree. Even if you didn't know. I still come home with you."
“Scorpius, stop that,” Draco admonished. “That’s the door that leads to Harry’s room, we don’t want to disturb him.”
“Clearly I do,” Draco chuckled. “Does that bother you?”
“Then set one up,” Teddy suggested. “We’ll join, and there’s never a shortage of Weasleys either, especially when it comes to Quidditch.”
Scorpius shrugged. “I don’t know. I just didn’t like him, so I said that to shut him up.”
“That was a rhetorical question, Scorpius. You’re still a little young to stay alone in a muggle hotel.”
How on earth was he going to tell Draco about this one? Merlin, he was screwed.
fast. That was how he was caught.”
“Would you like a drink?” Draco offered, grabbing another gold-rimmed glass. Harry contemplated the offer. He could stay and have a drink or two with Draco. If he played his cards right, maybe he’d be invited to stay the night. That would certainly give him ample opportunity to look around.
” Harry spluttered.
“I’ve had many prior students who struggle with addressing me by my first name. Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it.”
Unsure what else to do, Harry and Draco starting flapping their wings, sending gentle puffs of air towards each other.
"Getting an annulment, which is what I had hoped we could do, is going to get a lot more difficult if you did," Draco explained, ignoring his son. "It would be fine if you were muggles, but wizarding law here is even more antiquated and strict, and this is a wizarding marriage certificate."
"Where are we?"
And the Ferret’s breathing hard,
“Scorpius, I’m fine for now. This cloak really is quite warm, and I’m sure whatever clothes Teddy brings will also be quite comfortable.”
that it’s not that! But what you’re doing isn’t exactly above board either, is it?”
Draco smirked, holding his hand out to Harry.
"What does that mean?"
“You… what?”
He was distracted all throughout the break, not touching the coffee Teddy bought him or participating in the conversation the others were having. His mind kept drifting back to the members of the Wizengamot, and how he really hadn’t been able to discern from their expressions what they were thinking. This was a closed case, which meant no reporters or members of the public were allowed in the courtroom unless they were directly related to the case. Scorpius had been really grateful that Harrisson had had the foresight to ask for this, since he hadn’t yet figured out how to tell his dad about all this. It suddenly occurred to him that if his papa was released from Azkaban, he’d need a place to stay. Would his dad be open to having him come home? Surely he’d be understanding of the fact that Draco had been threatened, right?
Harry hesitated. Had they already put it together that he and Bryan had disappeared together?
“You sure do keep your room neat for a guy,” Bryan pointed out, and Harry was surprised to notice he was blushing.
“I should have told Teddy to get an extra blanket for you. Maybe the Medi-witch has some. I wonder where I could find her?”
When Ferret kisses Potty’s scar!
“How bad is yours?” she asked, eyeing the folder wearily.
This was news to Draco, though he didn’t have time to dwell on it because Harry had started shaking. He was quick to reassure Harry that financial cuts were a totally normal process in any government, and that these attacks were in no way his fault. But as he wrapped Harry up in a homemade blanket that was draped over the back of the sofa, he couldn’t help thinking that this might be the missing link. It wouldn’t be difficult to track down all the people whose jobs had been affected by the transition, and McGonagall could help him narrow the suspects down by NEWT results.
Harry opened his mouth to argue when Bryan's words sunk in.
"Scorpius, I told you—"
The American Museum of Dragonology and Creature Heritage was enormous. In hindsight, they should have expected it, seeing as they housed multiple activity centers and entire dragon skeletons, on top of the gift shops and restaurants. It took Drago almost five minutes of staring at the map to figure out where they were going. Harry had meant to help, but then Scorpius had sucked him into a game of patty-cake. They were still playing when Draco folded up the map and gave them an exasperated look.
“Harry-train sounds silly!” he giggled. He was still laughing as they approached Draco, who looked up at the familiar sound in surprise.
Draco nodded once. “He’s gone to the shops. He should be back soon, if you want to wait for him.”
“The two friends were so happy to see each other again, that they decided they would spend the rest of their lives together. They loved each other, and once dragons find their true loves, they never leave them again. So Harry and Draco lived happily ever after. The end!”
Merlin, flirting with Potter was fun! It didn’t hurt that Draco had been crushing on him since they were teenagers. But this was for work. He was, after all, a professional.
Silence fell again as Scorpius gave his dad time to digest everything he’d just said. Teddy and his papa had both said his dad was angry, but the man in front of him seemed sad. Scorpius knew he’d hurt his dad by hiding such a big secret from him. It was on the tip of his tongue to apologise, but nothing he could think to say felt like enough.
Draco nodded and closed the fridge, opting instead to open the microwave.
“Harry. We need to talk.”
Deciding a break would be helpful, he carried the letter over to the sofa in his Healer office. It turned out to be a note from Harry asking for a second date.
Harry laughed at the image of Draco trying to shake Scorpius off in this small flat. It was true that Draco had always been fiercely independent. He’d continued to work after they had gotten married, despite Harry’s insistence that he didn’t need to, and he’d also been adamant about sharing the costs of things around the house.
“That’s odd,” the receptionist mumbled. “Um, it seems I don’t have access to Healer Malfoy’s appointments.”
in hand.
“I love you, Scorp. Don’t ever forget that.”
“I could say the same to you. I wouldn’t have guessed that you came straight from work.”
“I don’t think you liked me very much back then,” Draco pointed out.
“Draco?”
“I’m serious Harry, you need to let go of this. Forget Malfoy, forget the Department of Mysteries, and for fuck’s sake stop bringing your cloak to work! Might I remind you that there’s an audit of Quodpot Little League grants that you need to finish before you leave tonight?”
“Draco, we told you to ask for nothing less than 400!” Pansy sighed.
“You’ve been there, right? Did you get to see…” Teddy trailed off as Scorpius nodded.
"We fought against Voldemort," he said quietly. He was relieved to see that they relaxed at his statement.
has details about what a person was treated for at St Mungo’s. And then you wonder why I don’t trust most Healers.”
“This is getting complicated,” Draco groaned.
“Let me,” he said softly, and with another wave of his wand the dishes flew to the sink and started washing themselves. Harry had always loved that spell—he hated washing dishes—but after Draco had been arrested, he’d never quite managed to get it right again.
Scorpius smiled at that. Little-league Quodpot (and it’s slightly more popular counterpart, little-league Quidditch) was always adorable to watch. He made a mental note to ask his dad if he had ever played. He couldn’t quite remember, but he hoped he had.
children’s author,” he insisted.
Peeves shrugged. “You’re the Head Weasel,” he sang. “Peevsy’s just telling you that there are
Draco bit his lip, staring at his son who was now beaming at the idea of spending the afternoon doing fun things with Harry.
It made sense to Harry. Everyone contributed to the world in their own way—he and Hermione kept the Ministry in line so that it could continue to serve the magical population the way it should. Ron kept the community safe as Head Auror. And Malfoy healed people when they needed it. He Transfigured animals back into humans, and helped people who… well, Harry wasn’t sure, but now seemed the perfect time to find out.
“Well, yeah. I wouldn’t have known you needed help if Scorpius hadn’t asked.”
“That sounds… incredible, actually. Hassan helped her with all this?”
“How can you guys eat so much?” he moaned. “I’m absolutely stuffed!”
“That’s so cool! Did you have a good time with your grandma this week?”
“Oh, Ron told us. He said you took over when he brought the first girl in.”
“May I have this dance?”
“If you insist,” he said, reaching out to take hold of Harry’s arm. “Whenever you’re ready.”
“Did he have to Transfigure humans into animals though?” Agent Delta groaned, annoyed that they’d expended so much effort over the past weeks for such a petty plot. “Couldn’t he have just brought in live animals?”
“Teddy is a Potions Master?” his papa sounded equally surprised and delighted at the thought. Scorpius groaned internally as he realised that they were bound to spend countless hours talking about boring potions theory. As awful as it sounded to him, the thought made Scorpius smile. He hoped his papa would be comfortable having conversations like that.
“Good afternoon everyone!” the same wizard from before called out. “Welcome to story time! Today’s story is called ‘Love among the dragons’
Teddy nodded. “Harry isn’t still mad at me about kicking him out the other day, right?”
He stood there, gaping at the man, trying to think of when he had last felt proud of something he'd done. It had definitely been a while.
“You don’t believe that,” Scorpius insisted, tears forming in his own eyes. He hated seeing his parents in such pain. “I know you’re angry, and shocked, and hurt, but you don’t believe that. He loved you. He still does.”
But it still sucked. Perhaps they should stop at the Head of Secrecy’s desk and explain exactly how unsafe and inconvenient this commute was. After all, Agent Delta now had to travel by public Floo. The indignity of it was unacceptable.
him. And he went and blew it all to pieces.”
“I’m not so sure it would be. You only need people who could have Transfigured her into a Hippogriff. That might indicate someone with a good knowledge of Hippogriff anatomy, but generally anyone with a NEWT in Transfiguration could do it. Perhaps when you have more details about the suspect, I can create a more specific list for you. But even then, there’s no guarantee this person studied at Hogwarts or that they didn’t learn the necessary skills after graduating.”
He should have known that this would be the conclusion a Healer would come to. He was sure talking about sex was no big deal for an experienced Healer, but it was for Harry.
Draco’s eyes widened. “Yeah, I think we can pass on the live dragons. Just the museum sounds great. We’ll see you in the morning then.”
"That sounds like fun," Draco agreed. "Let's go!"
"Wait!" he cried, stopping her in her tracks. "Didn't your parents say you have to wait until you're married?"
He could see understanding dawning on Pansy, Theo and Ron’s expressions, but somehow Harry still seemed confused.
“That’s wonderful, Draco,” Luna said, handing his wand back. “Did you ask him for a good amount like we discussed yesterday?”
“I wouldn’t say I really suffered here,” Harry pointed out. “I barely knew Zare. Hell, I didn’t even know her name until you told me just now.”
“Here, try this,” Bryan said suddenly, shoving a spoonful of mousse in front of him. “It’s really light, you’ll enjoy it.”
“I think you could be a good Auror,” Scorpius said, confused. “You’re powerful and clever, and clearly good at defense if that war was anything to go by.”
Five minutes later, they were sitting in leather chairs in the boardroom eating a catered lunch that had been prepared for a group who was never going to show up. The hotel had given Harry a huge discount, since the room and food was already paid for by the other group, and as he had been signing the rental contract, he'd also remembered to book a room for Draco and Scorpius, and to leave a message for them to join him in the boardroom.
Draco gestured to the room at large, trying to dispel the awkward pause as they both remembered the incident in the hospital cafeteria. They’d been on a couple more dates since then and while Harry had continued to ask all sorts of probing questions, they hadn’t talked about Draco’s colleagues any further.
“Well, I’ll leave you both to your work, it looks like you’ve got a lot to do,” Harry said, eyeing the files on Scorpius’ desk. Luckily, he didn’t ask what the case was about, and instead turned to leave. “I hope all that work won’t make you late? I was hoping to make something nice since Teddy’s having dinner with us.”
“Er…”
"That we were getting married!" Harry exclaimed. "You didn't even tell me!"
“Can we hear the story?” Scorpius asked.
"Is everything okay?" Harry asked, concerned.
Scorpius looked up hopefully at Harry's question, but the attendant smiled apologetically.
He snorted as he saw the contents. He was sure he could come up with a better gift for Draco than a pack of bubblegum. But as he noticed the pleased smile on Draco’s face, probably from being included in the group, Harry realised that it didn’t really matter. He’d already given Draco his heart. There couldn’t be a better gift than that.
