Draco was a member of the Assembly, representing Wiltshire, so he was due to arrive at Woad Hall at half past eleven for the start of the veto session, but he would be arriving in front of the hall today at nine for the announcement.
Pansy gave Granger a look and Granger gave a look back. “Oh, shut up," Draco  said. "Both of you. You’re both terrible people. Stop gloating or I’m going to curse off your right hands.”
They ate fast, devouring every drop of stew and crumb of bread. Ilana refused to answer any more questions, but did put the rest of the bread into a handkerchief for them to take with. “Remember, don’t stop,” she said.
Draco looked away. This was too much. Too much. He did not want to turn into a pile of tears and snot in front of McGonagall. He bit the inside of his cheek and willed himself to calm down.
“Why bother, when we’re just going to take them off?” Draco said, throwing a grin over his shoulder.
From the first, Harry was enchanted by the creatures. They all had wildly distinct appearances and temperaments, and soon, Harry knew which ones would tolerate being fed by hand or petted, and which ones to avoid altogether. There were incredibly non-glamorous parts of the job, such as mucking out the dragons’ lairs and clearing away animal carcasses. They had to do the work by hand, since dragons were very sensitive to magic and tended to get violent when they were too close to it. But there were incredible parts, too, like when Harry got to hold a baby Horntail and feed it tiny bits of raw steak. It didn’t have full control of its snout yet, so it very nearly set Harry on fire by accident, but thankfully, he was wearing a fireproof suit and only a little hair was singed.
Draco just looked at them. “You act like this is my job, Harry. It’s your job. You’re helping me, remember?”
When Draco returned to his desk, he didn’t bother with his other projects. He tried to stay on top of them all, usually, and set deadlines for himself even when his supervisors did not, but the portals needed to take top priority for a while. Hermione felt the same way, apparently, because she, too, had shucked all her other work off to the side and was deep in portal research when Draco arrived back in the Pen.
Another of the creatures stepped out of the trees and stood beside it. Then another. Then another. Another. Five in all, all of them powerful and terrible and uncannily beautiful.
The edges were blurring, thanks to the mead, and Draco could feel the buzz of Sen at his fingertips, all around him. The lifesong of the world, the beat of its heart. “Come on!” shrieked Frankie, pulling him into the crowd where people had started to dance around the enormous bonfire, which had been lit during supper. There was a circle moving around it, or maybe two circles, some people holding hands, some spinning around on their own. There was no rhyme or reason to it, no steps that Draco could discern. It was wild and unhinged, the sort of dancing that seemed appropriate as the world turned dark and the drums beat and the heat was swept away on a cool breeze. The kind of dancing that you could only do around a bonfire, the smell of salt drifting up from the sea, the smoke drifting up and away in ghostly plumes.
“Of course you didn’t. Who would? But, you know, think, now, of how you were raised. I know your parents – your father, at least – did a lot of things wrong. Put a lot of the wrong things into your head. But they loved you, didn’t they?”
Draco took Scorpius from Harry, moving him gently, in an effort to avoid waking him. “I’ll get Scorpius and Astoria home and come back,” he said quietly.
He’d found, through trial and error and some preliminary research, the purpose of the top two drawers (a nude image of whomever you fancied at the moment would appear in the top drawer after a brief incantation, and if you placed a piece of paper with a name on it into the second, that person would feel intense sexual desire for you for the next several hours), but the lower two still eluded him.
“I think so,” he said. “But –” he seemed to run out of breath then, his words dead before they left his lips, and he just shook his head.
Harry took Draco’s hand, and Draco realized it was the first time he’d touched him since all this started, and then they were apparating to the townhouse.
In June, the Wizengamot voted to release the Malfoy estate in its entirety to the sole heir, Draco L. Malfoy. Harry was in the courtroom when it was announced, but he didn’t call Draco to tell him. He did tell Pansy about it, though, right afterward, flooing directly over to her office at the Prophet. She hugged Harry and thanked him on Draco’s behalf. Harry wondered how Draco would take the news.
they were, honestly).  Potter had found beef and vegetables in the refrigerator and potatoes in the cupboard and was making a shepherd’s pie. Not Draco’s favorite, really, but he wasn’t going to point that out since Potter was bloody cooking for him.
Draco’s studio put on another performance in the WPCA (Wizarding Performing Centre for the Arts) that November. Last year they’d done the Nutcracker, but this year each class was doing something they’d choreographed together, even the little ones. Draco had five teachers on staff now, in addition to him. Some of the old families still sent their children to the other studio that was owned by Velma Fawley and taught only ballroom and ballet and some tap, but everyone else was sending their kids to Draco’s. All the classes had been filled this semester, even though they were offering twice the number of classes they’d offered in the spring.
And thoughts of Potter had long been laced with a hopeless sort of yearning. Draco wanted Potter in a physical sense, of course. Difficult to ignore that part, given the outrageous way Draco’s body responded to Potter every time he saw him. But there was also a different kind wanting involved; an all-encompassing, aching sort of want. A desire to have him, know him, befriend him, be near him. Anything. Everything.
Then Harry’s cock was at his entrance and Harry was fucking into him, and Draco’s arse was shuddering and clenching and he was dying, definitely dying, spread out on the sheets, being held down, pressed down, Harry’s weight on him, trapping him. There was no tenderness in his movements, no trace of the man who’d fucked him long and slow, looking into his eyes, the last time, the night before Sarah had gotten hurt.
Suddenly, in one sweeping move, so that Harry couldn’t even figure out how it happened, Malfoy’s shirt was off, leaving him in his trousers and a skin-tight white tank top. He wasn’t huge like some of the dancers, nor was he spray-tanned. Although he didn’t look as pale as Harry remembered. His skin had a slightly gilded tone to it, just a bit darker than his real coloring. And his body was a dream, all lean, long muscle. Not bulky, but not skinny at all anymore, just beautiful. Perfectly honed muscles everywhere, long and elegant, like a ballet dancer. This was definitely a change, it had to be, because Harry would’ve remembered if Malfoy had looked like this in school. He had an insane urge to run up to him and ask him about his fitness routine.
Draco scrambled to his feet, running, yelling, as the creature snapped at Harry, then sank its teeth into Harry’s thigh. Harry screamed, an awful, gut-churning noise that Draco knew he would never, ever forget, and then Draco’s sword met the beast’s flesh and the thing ripped its mouth away. Harry screamed again beneath it, and then it was facing Draco.
!” Harry cried. All the hurt of that night and afterwards came rushing to the surface. More than a year had passed, and yet the thought of it still made Harry feel exactly the same. He could still taste the bitter disappointment on his tongue, could still feel the emptiness Draco had left in his wake.
On and on and on and on until everything besides the next step ceased to exist. The wind bit at his back with fangs of ice. He did not look down because if he did, he’d probably start screaming.
Draco found himself in a moral quandary at work. Was he just doing this to make Harry jealous? And was
“I fucking hope so, or I’ve really let myself get carried away with the Pensieve,” Draco said wryly.
Potter’s hole was gorgeous, the little pink ring of muscle tight and sweet. He let his tongue drag across the rim and felt Potter shudder. Then again and again, so that Potter was jerking against him, moaning. He turned his face for a moment, licking the skin of Potter’s cheek, and then bit into it, like it was a juicy peach. Potter cried out. “Lick me again,
Harry got his fingers slick with a wandless lubrication spell and then he was pushing in, into the heat of Draco, and Draco was throwing his head back and crying out. “Tell me,” Harry said again. “Tell me what you think about.”
Hermione was working on another Time-Turner, and Draco was still messing around with the bottom drawer of the smut chest, along with a new project involving a mysterious love potion that was making amorous lovers accidentally bite little bits off of their partners in the throes of passion. In general, he was anxious to get the hell out of the Love Chamber and work on something unrelated to romance.
him. More like at the books behind his head. “In that case, I’ll finish what I came to say. Which is that I think it’s brave of you to do what you’re doing. I respect it, and I appreciate it. And while you’re working with us, anyway, I’ll do what I can to look out for you.” Finally, she allowed herself to meet his gaze.
Draco realized his eyes were full, and it was mortifying. He choked down a bite of his croissant – it seemed, suddenly, dry and flavorless in his mouth – and took a sip of coffee, blinking his unshed tears away. “Sorry,” he said, before clearing his throat. “Wrong pipe.”
Theo didn’t acknowledge that. “We could have joined forces. We had something special between us, didn’t we? An understanding. You cared about me, too, I know you did. You wouldn’t have let me into your bed if you didn’t.”
As it got more crowded, it began to feel like a party. Harry, who was huddled with Ron against a wall, saw flashes of drugs around the room: more coke, half-heartedly hidden and snorted hastily; pills, of some sort; and weed, smoked openly and without much fanfare. People were taking shots and getting rowdy, never mind that it was past two in the morning. Seamus was flitting about, being incredibly flirty and social, and Dean was trailing him, looking worried.
Yuri flicked the wand at him, and suddenly Draco was without a shirt. He felt the cold, dank air on his skin and shivered. Another flick of the wand, and Draco cried out as the skin of his chest began to bleed. Yuri was carving him up like a ham, cutting lines into his skin.
Theo looked ruffled; he was easy to ruffle. Skin thin as a shrivelfig's, really. Why he had decided that politics was a good career choice was a mystery. “I don’t plan on doing anything of the sort. But then, I’m not the one going around comparing sanatoriums to prisons.”
He poured two drinks and then, unable to help himself, garnished them with an orange peel and a deep red cherry that was sticky with thick syrup. “You’re an idiot, Draco,” he mumbled to himself as he took the drinks into the kitchen where Potter was just popping a round dish into the oven.
Draco watched in horror as Badgers began to bleed, sliced open by steel in what was supposed to have been a mock battle. Men and women were screaming in horror as they watched their fellow soldiers fall. The Badgers’ front line soon toppled, and then the battle descended into complete madness, the remaining Badgers trapped by the circle of Stags.
“Maybe,” Potter conceded. “But I saw how you were during the war. I knew you didn’t want to be helping Voldemort anymore. I could tell. You seemed so scared, and you didn’t kill Dumbledore, did you? And you didn’t turn me in at the Manor. You were changing even before the war ended.”
His father scowled. “It’s disgraceful how that man parades his lovers around. He’s the last of the Potters. Bad enough that his father married a Mudblood, now he seems intent on killing off the line altogether. You should encourage him to marry a nice witch and have children.”
Potter looked troubled by this. Draco groaned. “Fuck’s sake, man, don’t make this more awkward than it has to be. We set out to have sex with someone as a big ‘fuck you’ to our exes, and we did. It just happened to be with each other.”
Draco looked puzzled for a moment and then his face relaxed. “Bee. Stung me. Tried to clear my throat but it kept swelling…dunno what happened.”
Harry found himself worrying constantly about Draco and Charlie, watching them for signs of trouble, agonizing over making everything equal. He knew people did this – had more than one partner – but he honestly didn’t know
Draco leaned his head back against the tile and closed his eyes. He was not going to imagine this was Potter.
And then he thought about Theodore Nott, and how he almost certainly was responsible for sending a hitman after Sarah, and how he would make life miserable for a lot of people, and would probably do much worse than that.
“I agree that he had a motive,” Draco said. And he had thought, privately, that it might have been Nott. Especially since they’d had that conversation in Woad Hall, Draco’d been wary of Nott. Something about that, about the way Nott could not seem to separate politics from the personal, had unnerved him, and made him wonder about the past. “But I know what I saw in that memory, Pans. It was Astoria. And there’s no way she is working with or was ever working with Theo. She couldn’t stand him. She hates that pureblood shite.”
“Please tell me that you didn’t pick another fight with him. Draco, you must learn to control your temper! We’ve discussed this! It was one thing when you were seven and you didn’t get the Abraxan you wanted for your birthday. But you’re a full-grown man now. You must learn to make your feelings known in a less confrontational way. Why, your father and I –”
“It wasn’t.” She stood and looked at him again. “I don’t know that I’ll ever get over this, you know. I think I could have gotten over the cheating eventually. But this? I don’t know that I can.”
“Boring,” said Theo, who was sprawled out on the floor. “We ought to play Three Man. Get properly sozzled.”
She snorted. “You are not, you liar. Come for a walk with me in the rose garden and tell me what’s going on.”
William was still in his chambers when Draco set out to look for him. He was seated at a desk penning letters, dressed informally – for him – in a simple white tunic, brown trousers, and boots. “You’re here to tell me you’re leaving,” he said without turning around.
Then Harry blinked, as if waking from a dream, and shot up out of his seat. “I should go. I should – it’s late. Thank you for the tea. And for the talk. I promise I won’t act like that anymore. You have my word.”
. And then he started doing it back to her, the pair of them laughing and squirming and tussling and carrying on.
The papers included a preview of Shacklebolt’s remarks, as well as a page labeled ‘Order of Events’.  There were little stars drawn near the sections labeled ‘Order of Merlin Induction’ and ‘Remarks by Order Recipients’.  The start time listed on the programme was 4:00 p.m. Draco pulled out his pocket watch. Still an hour and a half away, thank Circe.
It was a bloody miracle that he wasn’t sitting in a cell next to Lucius. He had Potter to thank for that, he supposed. The thought filled him with bitterness, and he swallowed the bite of it along with his whiskey.
“I know,” Harry said. “I just…I liked her. She saved me. And I could tell that there was a lot of good in her. And I – I hated what happened. It wasn’t fair.”
very good for entertaining,” Harry pointed out. Together, they went back into the bathroom, and Draco opened up the cabinet to get toothpaste and his own toothbrush. They brushed their teeth, laughing over the weirdness of it together in the mirror, and then they made their way into Draco’s bedroom.
You’d love to wipe that smirk off his face. Punch it off, maybe, or lick it. “You’re so funny I forgot to laugh,” you say, because once again, you’re a fucking turd and you say things that nobody over the age of twelve should say. “Christmas was fine. Spent it at the Burrow.”
They were driving at normal muggle speeds while they conducted their Monday morning meeting, but the driver stepped it up once they were finished and they were in York within minutes, tumbling out of the bus at the Oakwood Hills Retirement Centre for Witches and Wizards.
“Am I going to walk into the bedroom again and find you in a silk thong and thigh-highs and a big bow wrapped around your chest? Because that would be
“Sure,” Draco said, uncurling himself from the couch. “I need to figure out what I’m going to eat, too, for that matter. My refrigerator is disturbingly empty; I need to do some shopping tomorrow.”
Instead, he picked up his hoodie and shoved it on over his head and sat at the foot of the bed. “Start talking, then,” he said, putting his hand on Draco’s foot, patting it through the covers. He supposed that was probably okay. It was just a foot, after all.
“I don’t care!’ cried Harry. “That doesn’t make it okay! People have to consent to these things! How many times? How many times did you do this? How many times did you have sex with people as Cassius?”
By the time Draco had come to Chicago and upended their lives, she thought she knew just about everything there was to know about Harry.
He let her hug him again, and gave her a tentative pat on the back, and then he went to tell Peabody, who merely breathed a sigh of relief and nodded.
Draco looked up and saw Charlie standing near the alter. He looked radiantly happy. Draco felt himself getting misty, not really because of Charlie, but because of what Charlie had done. Of course Draco was going to attend the wedding with Harry, and of course Harry was invited. But Charlie had invited Draco separately, and had included a little note that said he hoped Draco would be able to make it. It was all very sweet and was making him feel very sentimental and weepy, which was already a problem for him at weddings. He squeezed Harry’s hand.
“First of all, she could never marry the muggle. She’ll marry me, or she’ll marry some other pureblood who will probably be much less accommodating. And I…” Draco stopped and considered how to phrase the next part. “If I didn’t marry Astoria, I would marry someone else just like her. No, not just like her. Probably needier. Probably someone who would expect things of me. There’s no scenario where it’s better. There are many scenarios where it’s worse.”
After that, the kids wanted to play their ten thousandth game of hide-and-seek (not that Harry could blame them; hide-and-seek in the Manor was quite fun), and Harry and Malfoy agreed to join in. James was it first, and everyone scattered, the children shrieking delightedly. Harry found a guest room on the third floor with a closet that was sort of hidden behind the door to the room and slipped in. He made himself comfortable, since it very well might be an hour until he was found.
“I love seeing you too, mother,” he said, standing and giving her a kiss on the cheek. “Thank you for tea. And for the talk.”
“I know,” she said, and her eyes got shiny, and Harry realized he was going to make her cry. Awesome.
Edwin was quiet for a moment, looking at him. Then he burst out laughing. “While I appreciate that you’ve shared your pathetic sob story with me, I must tell you that I could not care any less about it. I’m not you. And thank the moons for it.” He narrowed his eyes, sending his best glare over to Draco. “Now leave me. I’d like the last few hours of my life to be spent in relative peace and quiet, not listening to your drivel.”
Everyone split up for a while, nabbing food and butterbeer, and/or a cup of firewhiskey or elfwine. Harry, who felt like he was an unofficial party manager again, stuck to butterbeer, and he noticed Malfoy did, too. When he found himself in the library with Malfoy, he made his way over to the other boy. “Cheers,” he said, holding up his butterbeer. They clinked cups and Harry was pleased to see how happy Malfoy looked. “That went rather well, don’t you think?”
Harry couldn’t get over his little posh accent. It was rather adorable. Nor could he get over how fucking much the kid looked like Malfoy, but in miniature. He supposed that’s what people thought when they saw Al, because Al looked very much like Harry. “You read the Prophet?” Harry asked as he took a bottle of butterbeer out of the fridge and poured it into three small glasses. He handed them out.
?” she asked. And Draco knew what she was really asking: whether he would be able to move on or not.
“And you look gorgeous as usual, darling,” she said, kissing Euri’s cheek. “What would you boys like to drink? Wine? Champagne? Cocktails?”
He didn’t want to bother Ron and Hermione again, since they’d been so nice the night before, so when he got home from his search, he floo-called Pansy and was delighted when she appeared. “Harry, darling! How are you?”
Harry woke up on a hot roof, the sun blaring down, the hedges preventing any breeze from coming to cool him. He was sticky with sweat and he had his head on a pointy hipbone. It was Draco Malfoy’s pointy hipbone.
“Why have you been acting so weird lately?” Harry asked suddenly, startling a bit, as though he were waking from a trance.
She gave him a look. “I don’t even know why you think this is what he wants for his birthday. He didn’t actually say so, did he?” Her face darkened, suddenly, like the sun had gone behind a very threatening, impending-doom-like cloud. “Did he
The days passed in this way, on the road for long stretches, talking with Berold and Frankie, stopping mid-day if the sun was too intense, pausing by creeks to let the horses drink and rest. They stayed in taverns and inns when they could and slept rough when they found themselves in the countryside in the evenings.
Harry showed up at the Manor on Christmas Eve in late afternoon, a sour-looking Professor Snape trailing in behind him. Harry seemed tense and uncomfortable at first, but his demeanor improved the moment Snape disappeared.
“What, was this some sort of ploy to get back at me? Or to sleep with me? Or, what, both? Make me miserable and fuck me too? What?”
“You’re not secretly going to be pining for me if we don’t get together? I’m not breaking your heart? You’re sure?”
Now Ron actually did choke on his toast, and Hermione had to slap him on the back to get it to dislodge. She turned back to Harry when she was done, and, with a very prim expression on her face, asked, “What do you mean, he talked about sex?”
mouthy portrait in the parlor, and they still have great sex and lots of great friends and everything’s lovely!”
They lifted their wands and then held them low at their sides, and bowed, or, at least, inclined their heads. Draco felt his heart pounding painfully in his chest as he watched them. He didn’t have a wand, and he felt completely helpless.
Ginny thought about it. “Well. Euripides told his older brother, Ari – short for Aristophanes, by the way, I mean,
Potter shrugged. “I think he is. And you think he’s…how did you put it?…’bloody gorgeous’, if I recall. So.”
She brought the weights up to her chest, and then lowered them again. “This is a simple bicep curl. I usually do about three sets of twenty. Make sure to hold your elbows still, kind of lock them into your sides.”
Harry snorted. “No, I think not. I swear that’s why she plays Quidditch. So she can travel all over the place and avoid relationships and shag boys and girls in every corner of the U.K.”
“Dragon,” Pike said, wincing at the contact. His face was covered in a sheen of sweat, and his olive skin seemed unnaturally pale. “Are you going to mend me, then?”
Harry recalled when he had someone to share those sorts of exchanges with, the sort where you knew everything about the other person, even things they themselves didn’t know. He knew his relationship with Ginny hadn’t been good, not for a long time, maybe years, but still. He missed her then, in that moment.
“Oh, Harry,” Draco sighed. “I can tell you from experience, that sort of thing never works. And I already knew I liked you, you git. I’ve been perfectly aware of that since I was sixteen.”
He went to the showers because he felt a little sweaty after his nap, and also because Malfoy was a clean person and so he wanted to be especially clean around Malfoy. Back in his room, he put on a non-shredded pair of jeans and a dark gray t-shirt, and looked over his clothes, which really weren’t great. He considered his predicament.
He thought about her all day and was ready to go looking for her properly after work, ringing the neighbors’ doorbells and putting up signs, but when he peeked into the shed, she was atop his car with Biscuit and Bean. He breathed a sigh of relief and brought her into the house, where she wove around his legs as he made supper, and practically sat on his head when he got into bed. “Where were you?” he asked, petting her. “You scared me.” She just looked at him with her pretty yellow eyes and blinked.
Draco let go of Harry’s hand and took a good, long drink of his gin and tonic, and Harry watched his Adam’s apple bob as he swallowed. He kept his eyes closed as he began to dance, a little smile on his face. Draco’d always liked dancing. Harry was fine with it now (although he used to hate it, used to feel like a complete wanker when he tried to dance) but he never seemed to get swept up like Draco. Draco was beautiful like this, beautiful when he let go of all his tight control and stopped caring about anything except the music.
Draco didn’t bother answering. Instead, he blearily made his way over to the sink that sat in a corner of their room and began to brush his teeth.
Draco hardly knew what to say. They wouldn’t have. They never would have, even when Nott hadn't been so poisonous. “Well, I wish you all the best regardless. I’m looking forward to discussing the issues with you in the debates next spring.”
“Lord, you ought to speak with Laurel," the soldier said. "She and the captains are in William’s quarters.”
Ron slid them off the pan and onto a plate that was already laden with sausages and toast. “Here,” he said. “I dunno if I did any of it right.”
“Here’s the other thing,” Pansy said, waving her dirty martini around hazardously. “I can’t bring myself to believe that Draco wants Euri. I
“Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder. My brain’s wired differently, is what it means. I have a short attention span, I have too much energy sometimes. I have difficulty reading social cues, struggle with impulsiveness. That sort of thing.”
Harry cried out his climax and then started laughing, because it was fucking absurd. Then he collected himself and did a quick cleaning spell and resumed kissing Draco, taking his time now, being very deliberate in the way his licked and kissed over Draco’s throat and his lovely ears. He undid the buttons of the silk pajama shirt and pushed it open, then kissed all over Draco’s chest, flicking and biting at his nipples, slowly marking up his skin by sucking at it. All the while, he watched Draco stroke himself, and when Draco began to move faster and tilt his head back and cry out, Harry kissed his mouth, sucking on Draco’s tongue, and he felt Draco jerking and coming beneath him.
, in Romania, in the middle of winter, to embark on some insane experiment with Harry. “I’m here because Charlie asked me to come.”
tidy person and he didn’t want to disgust him. And also, being a slob made things incredibly frustrating sometimes, like when you needed your Marauder’s Map and couldn’t find it anywhere, even thought it must be here somewhere –
“Oh, sorry. You asked, though. But. Oh. Are you – wait. Did you hook up with Draco last night after I left?”
Just now, Malfoy was telling Harry about his talk with Hermione – which Harry already knew about, although he feigned ignorance. Malfoy still spoke like a complete wanker, posher than anyone else Harry’d ever encountered. But he didn’t sneer as much as he used to, which was nice. And although the accent was ridiculous, Malfoy’s voice itself was pleasant. Harry’d noticed that in the café at lunch. Malfoy’s voice was lower than it used to be, richer, and the tones of it vibrated down Harry’s spine and seemed to pool in the pit of his stomach.
Draco shook his head quickly. "No, that's not what I'm saying. Just. You can't stay here. You don't belong here. And so...maybe I don't, either." He took in Harry's expression, less panicked now, and more confused. "I'm saying you're going to go home, and I'm going to go with you. And we're going to figure this out properly."
, and had been for more than half their lives, and if it came down to it, she would throw Harry to the wolves for him.
Then he remembered lying there on the floor of the dining room, looking up at the old stained-glass pendant lamp, its colors swirling around the walls so beautifully, like a kaleidoscope. And then he remembered waking up, still on the floor, with a swollen face and a sense of deep-seated dread, and a very spotty notion of what, exactly, had taken place the night before.
Andromeda smiled. “Came out that way. Big spiky mess of hair, right from the start. All different colors, like his mother.” She left Draco, then, and drifted back over to Narcissa, putting a hand on her back, and Draco watched, his chest full of warmth, as his mother leaned against her. They were quite different, the two of them, but there was a sameness in the way they smiled and in the shape of their faces, and in the way they held themselves. You could tell they were sisters.
“In the end, I looked at you, and I thought of how I’d never known you had this capacity, to care for others. To love others. And I didn’t know it because I hadn’t looked. I assumed I knew what you were – who you were – because of the color of your robes. We all did. It wasn’t fair. I’m not saying that you were perfect, mind – we both know that you weren’t -- but you had potential for things that we ought to have been encouraging all along, and didn’t.
At home, over a quiet supper of reheated soup in one of his favorite yellow bowls, Draco considered his options. There were many places in time where he could go and try to fix things with Harry. Only, he worried that if it were too early on during their Hogwarts days, that he and Harry would once again become too close by the time the war came, and then Harry would end up dying, and it would, apparently, have something to do with Draco being stupid, as Weasley had suggested last time.
say, things that needed to be expressed and offered and explained, only he couldn’t quite figure out what they were, even in his own mind. They existed in him only as feelings, as emotions, and tangled and confused ones at that. Besides, what difference would his words make?  And Malfoy probably didn’t want to hear them anyway. In the end, he stood, nodded, and walked away.
Draco had no idea what the fuck was happening, so he let Pansy lead him to one of the chairs that was sitting in front of the long table with shiny cubes on top.
They ate pork tenderloin with mashed potatoes and candied brussels sprouts for dinner, and Draco chose a Pinot Noir after some debate (with himself – Harry had no opinion on the wine, other than ‘something red’). Later, they were in the bathtub together with the bubble bath Pansy’d left for him. It smelled like cypress and citrus, and it made Draco’s head feel clear even as his body was becoming relaxed and sleepy in the hot water. “After our term ends,” Draco said, tipping his head to the side to look at Harry, who was seated behind him. Draco was between his legs, and he could feel Harry’s cock at his back. It was partially hard, but Draco wanted to say this before he took care of it. “We should take a trip.”
The next day, another group of Rebel soldiers met up with them at the border of North March. They were mostly men with a couple of women mixed in, and Draco couldn’t keep them straight (there were seventeen of them in all).  Well, that wasn’t entirely true; there was one bloke who made himself memorable by being a complete arsehole. His name was Edwin, and he was one of William’s right-hand men, and he took an obvious dislike to Draco from the start.
Harry immediately got a bad feeling about it and left Beauregard to apparate back to the cottage with Charlie. They searched the surrounding area and then decided to split up. By this time, it was getting dark, and Harry was going from vaguely concerned to downright panicked.
He hugged her back, breathing in the familiar scent of her lemongrass perfume. “You and Ron are okay? All the Weasleys? Sarah?”
“Mm,” she said, bending down to kiss his cheek, letting him take in the softness and subtle perfume of her skin. “Of course.” She sat down at the table, looking over the breakfast Mimsy had set out, and took several pieces of fruit and a piece of toast, unbuttered, and one soft-boiled egg. She spread a tiny amount of marmalade over the toast and took two bites and decided that was probably enough of that. She ate her fruit and her egg, though, her eyes on Draco as he resumed his play with Scorpius.
“Oi, I forget how superstitious you are sometimes,” Harry said, smiling. He tapped his knuckles lightly against the tabletop. “There. Knock on wood. Feel better?”
“Besides,” said Ron, poking his head out from behind the other curtain. “Lovegood’s on our side. It’d be safe.”
He flooed back with Ari, and Ari leaned in for a goodnight kiss. It was soft and every bit as nice as it had been before, and Harry wanted no part of it. He pulled away after a few moments. “Goodnight,” he said.
“Harry!” she cried. “Long time no see! Hope you didn’t try us earlier – we just got back from the Burrow.”
“We’ve got a warrant,” Harry said, holding it up. “There was a burst of dark magic coming from this location around two this morning. We need to take a look around.”
, not again. Get a fuckin’ room, you two,” cried Ron, who had stopped on his way towards them and was looking ill.
She nodded. “Don’t tell her I said so, but Laurel’s not quite so skilled at it as you. Although she fixed me up well enough.” She tugged down the collar of her tunic to reveal a long, pink scar. “None of the work you did left a mark.”
Weasley groaned. “I don’t know if that makes it better or worse. Look, I know it’s none of my business –”
“Why not?” Harry asked, feeling the loss of him all along the front of his body. Feeling the full force of the icy wind once more.
The corridors of St. Mungo’s smelled of bleach and magic and potions. It was not a pleasant scent. Draco was carrying Scorpius on his hip, and Scorpius was yawning and looking sleepy. Before they reached Sarah’s room, Astoria made sure to walk close to Draco, right by his side. Let Potter see them together like this. Let him take a good look at what, exactly, he was trying to destroy.
Harry was leaning against the wall in the corridor outside of Sarah’s room, trying not to throw up or cry. He had been sitting next to Sarah’s bed since she’d come out of the examination room and he needed a reprieve from staring at her pale, motionless body. She looked dead like that. He kept imagining that she
Harry had heard, but he had, naively, assumed it was mostly rumors. “Well,” he said, boldly looking Zabini up and down. “You probably had plenty of people eying you back.”
“No time,” Draco said, and Harry found himself almost dizzy, once again, at the sight of Draco fingering himself. “I need my beauty sleep and it’s clear you’ll not leave me along until you’ve had me, so. Best hurry this part up.”
“Oh, we’re having a slumber party, darling!” Pansy answered for Harry. “It was so lovely. The children had so much fun. Harry made pizza. And we told scary stories. Oh, and we made s’mores. Do you know what s’mores are? I didn’t know. Harry showed me.” She hurried back over to Harry and threw herself onto his lap.
“Yes, I suppose I’ll have a cup. It’s not as though I’ll sleep anyway,” Draco grumbled. Harry ran a hand over his back and Draco leaned against him, yawning.
There was a hand in his hair, gently tugging at strands, absently twirling pieces of it, which was something his mother did sometimes, especially when he was younger. He felt safe in a way he hadn’t in a long time; safe and cared for, and content.
These bits would probably be in Stephens's memory, though. Draco wasn’t here to gape at the obvious things. He was here to explore.
“It is if you’re looking at the bigger picture. If we lose, the Reform Party is left with Davies. If Davies is the candidate, Nott’s going to win. It’s that fucking simple. And while my life would be dramatically improved by getting a divorce, everyone else’s would be fucked. Everyone with a muggle spouse or a muggle parent. Everyone like Sarah living in the wizarding world. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. If you think Nott’s going to stop there, you’re delusional.” He was getting worked up now, color high on his cheeks, a spark back in his eyes. It was better than the dullness of a moment before, that was for certain.
“Not at the time,” he said. “Afterwards, like, a while after the fact. Like now I feel embarrassed about charging into your bedroom when I got here. But at the time, it made sense to me. Because I was so mad.”
He rubbed the spot where she’d hit him; she had not held back. “Ow,” he protested. “That hurt. You’re such a bully, Parkinson.”
“Yeah, agree,” said Harry, feeling another wave of amazement at how much damn sense Pansy Parkinson was making.
“There’s not, like, anything inherently bad about stripping,” Harry said. “I don’t know that you should throw that in his face.”
When he opened the door, he was startled to find Hermione standing on the other side rather than his gray-haired supervisor. She had two travel cups in one palm and a takeaway sack in the other.
They left at dusk, Dormond hurrying down the quiet road ahead of them to scout. The night was cold, and Draco wrapped his black cloak around himself tightly as he rode. Thankfully, Circe was warm, almost hot, and he clung to her, feeling grateful.
“Dare,” said Daphne from her place on a loveseat next to Greg. Draco whistled for her because Daphne never did dares. She was being unusually brave. She smiled over at him.
Then he’d go back to the palace and wonder whether he should leave. But then he’d think about what it had been like, those few days at home, and he’d stay another night. Then another. Then another.
One day, Draco left the courtyard where he’d been working with Kerrick, and nearly ran into the Princess. Her name was Lysandra, and she was standing at the center of six Rebel soldiers, her newly appointed guards and minders. She was a small, strange girl, with a pinched face and pale eyes, and a cape of shining black hair. She was clad as richly as anyone Draco had seen here, in an elaborate emerald gown that trailed after her, a string of pearls laced around the crown of her head. “You are the Dragon,” she said, looking over at him. Her eyes were very light in her olive-skinned face, and more than a little unnerving.
Markus raised an eyebrow. “I don’t care that you’re a werewolf, Malfoy. Honestly, we go through an entire war based on ‘blood purity’ and you think we would deny you a place here because of that? You’ll take the fulls off—not an issue.”
Harry walked over and Draco saw how thin he was—that couldn’t be right with all of the help he was getting here. He squeezed his hand tightly in greeting, but it felt more like a warning. “What happened?”
“He’s not a prisoner,” she replied. “As long as you’re feeling up to company,” she winked at Draco who turned a little red at that. “Call if you need anything,” she said, leaving the room.
Sirius just laughed again. “So you two seem cozy,” he said, winking at Draco, who turned a lovely shade of pink. “Totally not what I would’ve expected.”
Remus nodded and disappeared again. Harry sat on one of the overstuffed armchairs in the room, drawing a pillow to his chest. “Thanks for letting us meet here instead of the Hospital Wing. It’s so sterile over there.” He shuddered. He truly despised hospitals.
When the three arrived, Draco hadn’t even touched his essay. He was just staring blankly at the paper. Harry squeezed his shoulder gently, causing the blonde to jump in alarm. “Alright?”
Harry tried to pull out of his father’s embrace but he wouldn’t budge, James definitely the more muscular of the two despite being about a head shorter than Harry. “I need to get to Draco,” he said in a panic, “something is wrong.”
Despite Draco losing control, the night was still one to remember: Harry didn’t think he’s seen Ron so happy since the final battle. He supposed his newfound power wasn’t all bad, annoying Dark Lords and all. He would never change this night for anything, wolf incidents included.
Draco knew it was self-destructive – he knew Harry was drinking to forget. He knew he should have told someone. But he couldn’t help but allow them to keep sneaking out, if just to see Harry come alive for a few hours each miserable day.
Sirius carefully took the mug out of Harry’s hands and enveloped him in a tight hug, being careful not to hurt him. As Harry squeezed him back, he could feel his ribs pressing against him, another worry to add to his list. “Harry, I would have noticed the minute the full was over and you weren’t at breakfast.” He pulled him back to look him up and down. Harry was looking anywhere but his face, trying to avoid his father’s eyes. “As for me seeing you in the Garden and thinking nothing of it—for one, you’d be shiny around the edges—that would be a clear tip off. Second, you think my brother would keep his mouth shut about that? He’s the biggest gossip I know.” Harry gave a small chuckle and Sirius took that as a tiny victory. “And third, on a more pragmatic level, I would definitely feel your death—as Lord Black, I would feel when my Heir was gone—I’d get this great emptiness inside of me.” Sirius sighed. “I know it’s difficult to be on the other side of a war. It’s debilitating to think about all of the lives lost and all of the remaining scars that we must tend to. I need you to know that it’s okay to tell me or Rem or anyone when you are feeling the weight is too much to bear—we’re not going to leave you alone in this—you’re never going to be alone again.”
Remus reached forward and grabbed the blonde’s hands, squeezing them tightly. Draco looked at him in surprise. “Draco. I know this is frightening, but you’re not a monster. You can be trusted. This is just another part of being a werewolf that you’re learning to manage. You would never hurt Harry.”
Ron suppressed a groan. “Those will kill you, you know,” he responded, gesturing toward the cigarette.
Harry looked tired, but that seemed to be the norm for everyone after the events of the past few years. His face was a little sunken, too, which was of concern. “Did your tests go well?”
Harry cursed under his breath. “You’re probably right.” He sunk into the pillows and closed his eyes. “You’re right though: one down.”
with a wave of his hand. “At least I didn’t wake you up too early,” he said, smiling sheepishly after seeing 7:30 as the time. “Let’s go to Hogsmeade after?”
“I don’t really care about my inheritance, father!” Draco exclaimed. “You could have let me go. You could have accepted an alternate punishment. You didn’t have to whisk me away to this fate. You are a coward and now I’m a monster and I can’t stand to look at you.”
“Did you finally notice how absurd your hair is?” Draco drawled, but he was secretly growing more worried.
“Of course. You can take one of those every 6-8 hours or so if you’re experiencing a lot of discomfort with that arm. It was broken without intervention for so long, making it a slower heal than usual.”
Draco looked up. “Yeah,” was all he could say. Did he do something wrong? Was Ron going to punch him? He knew he had a temper.
"Sirius was Harry's godfather," Remus responded, voice tight. "And James did have Black blood, even if he was very far removed from the Lord's line. Sirius let the Order use it, Harry let it continue." Remus pushed open the double doors to a screeching portrait and an even louder Harry, Ron, and Hermione. "Miss the colony yet?" Remus joked, looking at Draco's surprised face.
Lucius sighed. It was his turn to swallow down the self-preservation. “You’re not a huge disappointment. I probably am to you.”
Harry looked at Ron, frowning. “I don’t think I can do this, Ron. What if there’s a coup? Draco shouldn’t be here either, it’s too dangerous for him.”
Harry sighed. "Sure. Are you hungry?" Draco's stomach growled in response. I'll take that as a yes. I'll go get you something."
It was James’s turn to grimace. “Not proud of it, mate. We just wanted to keep you safe. We obviously failed in that regard. I think Dumbledore never lifted the spell so you could be protected by Lily’s family.”
did, but also realizing that his mother had provided him with the support he needed to get out. Theo definitely did not have the same luck befall him. “You’re right, as always.” He smiled at her. “I’d approach but I know he’d bare his fangs: being a cornered snake is difficult.”
The majority of the train ride was quiet, with Ron every so often making light conversation with Harry about nonconfrontational things—Quidditch, who the new Defense professor would be—anything to keep Potter from brooding. It was a clever plan for Weasley, who, to Draco, never seemed to have much forethought about anything.
Harry looked almost feral with the wind whipping around him. His green eyes were shining so brightly they were almost glowing.
Blaise nodded in understanding. “I get it. I’m sorry for pressuring you about it.” He wiped the remaining tears from his eyes. “I do love you, though. That will never change.”
“We both did. It’s okay—he’s getting the help he needs.” Hermione looked to be holding back tears. She was fiddling with the hem of her shirt nervously. “Hermione, you didn’t even know the half of it—you would’ve gotten him help straight away if you did.”
As they set to depart, Lucius pulled Draco aside. “I’m sorry about earlier, Draco. I wasn’t even thinking. I just love you and want you safe.”
The older werewolf gingerly got to his feet, wincing as he did so. He put out a hand in front of the teen. “Let’s get you some tea, shall we?”
Draco did not get much more information out of the elder wolf, driving him a little spare. Nobody got the Prophet delivered to the colony, it seemed, and he felt shut out from the world outside of this little bubble. This time, though, he tried not to lament, and instead began exploring the colony as his arm healed, getting to know his clan.
Draco was taken aback by that. His father never owned up to much of anything. It was generally Draco’s fault. “You’re not a disappointment. I just don’t understand the appeal to Him.”
Harry just nodded, the shadow of the Final Battle still clearly on his face. “He did. I want to make sure everyone knows that.”
“Sure, love,” Harry commented sarcastically before disappearing into the kitchen. “Want a cuppa’?” he called.
“Crucio!” Draco watched as his father fell to the floor, writhing in agony. This was no game. There was no glory or independence on the Dark Side. All of the folk tales his father told of the good times were just that – folk tales. Every experience Draco has had involving Voldemort had convinced him that the man was an egomaniac hell bent on controlling everyone. Draco set his jaw at that thought, gaining some nerve. He would not die a coward. “Do you know what your father cost me, young Draco?” he asked.
Draco scoffed. “Professor, I’m appalled that you would think that I am unable to follow basic instruction. Of course I’ve been taking it.” And he had been. That vile tasting potion had been a regular part of his dinners for the past couple of days. Apparently flavouring the potion would remove its properties, something Draco was resentful of. Maybe he’d foray into potioneering in order to create a better tasting brew.
Ron laughed. “I do have quite a few older brothers, all smokers.” Ron handed the smoke back, “Just don’t tell mum.”
Blaise nodded, sobering for a moment. “Good. That was terrifying, seeing the two of you hauled out of here.”
Draco pulled his hand away and balled it into a fist under the table as he tried to relax. Lucius’s apology didn’t make him feel happy or forgiving—it made him
“Self-preserving Slytherins,” Harry replied, before meeting Draco’s lips with his own in a lazy kiss. Draco melted into the kiss, wrapping his arms around Harry’s shoulders, running his fingers through messy black hair. This might be the best Christmas he ever had, Draco thought. Who needs piles of gifts from Father Christmas when he could have the savior of the wizarding world enveloping him in searing embraces? How did one get so lucky?
Sirius nodded. “I wanted out. Tried drowning myself in the Prefects’ bathroom. Remus found me and pulled me up in time. He was horrified.” Sirius had a far away look in his eyes, thinking back to that terrible affair. He ran away from home shortly after that, realizing he had alternate means of escape.
Draco crossed his arms at that. “Guess you don’t want your Christmas present, then. Alright, Potter.”
Heat rose to Draco’s cheeks. So he had noticed. “Not like this – not while you’re exercising self-loathing through alcoholism.”
“I know that letting Seamus fill you with as much alcohol and drugs as possible isn’t a healthy coping mechanism for your grief. It’s shite, Harry. You’re barely attending class, you’re on probation from the Quidditch team unless you get your grades up. This isn’t you.”
He looked around the room—nobody seemed to be around. Remus would kill him if anything happened, but he just
Draco let out a small laugh. “Nothing could make it harder for me with the Slytherins right now. At least the mini-Eaters. Pansy and Blaise have been alright.”
Harry wasn’t sure if he should step in. Draco’s yelling would definitely arouse looks, notice-me-nots be damned. He looked around for his Auror guard. They were still surrounding Harry and Draco, leaning against shop walls, reading newspapers, anything that would allow them to blend in. Harry could sigh in relief at that moment. They would be safe.
Draco shuddered at the thought of his home. “Trust me, I don’t want to be there right now. I do miss Mum, though.”
He stood over his best mate, willing him to open his eyes. Draco shot a glance at the door—nobody was around. “Well,” he said, “if they won’t tell me how it’s going, I’m just going to have to find out myself, now aren’t I?” He placed a hand over Blaise’s chest and closed his eyes, trying to feel out the damage.
had a quasi tell-all of the findings—he wondered who sold him out to the news. Harry had a meeting with Dumbledore and McGonagall about what to do about the inevitable lurking paparazzi in Hogsmeade and both settled on the idea that Harry shouldn’t go at all for his safety. He was livid. He set the Headmaster’s curtains on fire through a bout of accidental magic and stormed out, ready to raid the kitchens of its firewhiskey.
Draco was finally able to glimpse Harry around Remus and held back a gasp. How was this possible? Did that make him and Harry related? He shuddered at the thought.
Draco turned his head quickly, seeing that yes, indeed, it was Pansy sauntering into the Great Hall. He hadn’t seen her since the end of Sixth Year, though he had heard she wanted to turn Harry in to Voldemort during the battle. Her hair was longer, falling in waves, and was in a cream jumper with black slacks. She looked happier than he’s seen her in a long time.
Remus was rubbing soothing circles on Draco’s back. “Voldemort coming back really shook your family dynamic. Not to mention the whole werewolf thing. It’s natural to feel so lost. It’s going to be okay, I promise.”
Harry looked up with a grimace. “Sorry, I was going to lose count again.” He began capping the vials off as they continued. “Classes so far seem great, though it is only the first day. I’m not excited for Draco to leave this Thursday.”
Harry pulled back and gently kissed him, making Draco feel warm and tingly. Lazy morning kisses were much higher up on his daily agenda. “I’m sorry,” Harry said with a sheepish look on his face. “I just had to check that you were here.”
Remus settled Draco back into the sheets as he explained. “You might be the first lycanthropy survivor; well, half-survivor, you’re still pretty much a werewolf but without the full transformation bit.”
Lucius sent him a glare. “Only temporarily when the potion ran out,” Narcissa responded. “As long as he doesn’t move around he doesn’t seem to be disturbing his core too much.”
Draco finally walked back over to the table, mug in hand, and sat opposite his father. Upon closer inspection, he could see the nervous ticks his father was displaying. A slight twitch in the hands resting at the table, hair slightly out of place, as though he had been fiddling with it, and, above anything else, a distinct nervous energy that Draco’s wolf senses picked up on immediately. Lucius might have been more on edge than Draco was with all of this.
Ron and Harry laughed at that: the two brainiacs of their cohort were already raring to go, signaling the true start of term. They finished up breakfast in comfortable silence and headed back to their Common Room to figure out just how the school year would go.
Harry squeezed Draco’s hand gently at that. “I had a session yesterday. Christmas Eve of all bloody times: don’t Healers take holidays?”
Sirius noted the two werewolves in the door way and cracked a huge grin, larger than Draco has ever seen on his face. He looked more like Harry when he smiled like that and it made Draco’s chest ache at the thought of him all alone at St. Mungo’s. “You’re back!” he exclaimed, pulling away from James’s embrace and bringing Draco into a hug, his second of the day.
. Harry would only smile encouragingly, not commenting on his apparent atrophied core. This new core business overall was terribly exhausting and if he didn’t save Harry he’d regret tearing it in two in the first place. If he called on his healing powers ever again, he’d want to make sure not to overexert himself. He asked Remus for books on natural healers to help navigate his new power, knowing in the back of his mind it would be helpful for the upcoming war that was sure to ensue.
He glanced over at Remus who smiled knowingly at him, making him want to disappear where he stood. “Yes, I stayed with him,” he mumbled. “The castle is just too thick with bad memories I suppose.”
Harry was speaking too softly for Draco to bear. How was he so angry at others but gentle to him? He could smell the pheromones and it was driving him spare. He could not be falling for a distant cousin—it was just too weird and too taboo. “Can we just get this done so we can go?”
He leaned over to turn the jets on and sighed and closed his eyes as they came to life, working out his bodily tension. It had been a rough transformation.
to make him his and it drove him mad. Draco mentally shook himself of it as he tried to reign his emotions in but knew Harry saw it all over his face by the way his eyes darkened. “I love you,” he said.
Harry wasn’t going to fight Blaise, it turned out. But he definitely was going to have a word with him.
“Yes, yes, I’ll get poked and prodded by a Healer sometime after the war but that’s besides the point. I think it pushed me all the way back to when we were Confunded. My mind is pretty clear on the Harry situation.”
“Somehow, yes.” Remus sat back at the table, gesturing Draco to join him, which he did. “We ran the gamut of questioning to ensure that it really was him, though Seer assured me that only an Heir or Lord would actually be able to apparate here. Probably splinched himself trying to bring everyone with him.”
“It has been better,” the older man admitted. “The important thing is that you’re okay. Your mother couldn’t give me much information, what with her house guests.”
Harry patted the thestrals in thanks as Draco tried to ignore the death horses. Ginny, Ron, and Hermione were still in awe of them, having not seen them prior to the final battle. Harry glanced at them and grimaced. “Shall we?” Draco asked, offering his arm. He was trying to get more comfortable with public affection for Harry’s sake, who listed touch quite high on his love language list. Draco begrudgingly had become more accepting of the hugs and small touches his friends and family seemed so keen on post-war.
Draco couldn’t shake his fever for about a week after his first full moon. His body was sore from the transformation – his arm never felt more ready to be severed from his body. He was put back up in his rooms where a little worse for wear Remus and Jack took care of him. Once again, Draco felt guilty for treating the professor poorly during his time at Hogwarts. Lupin was much too kind to someone who tried to make his life miserable, and it made Draco feel ashamed and angry all at once. “I don’t deserve this – stop making me feel guilty, already!” he burst out about midweek to a patient Remus checking his vitals.
Draco shook his head in disagreement. “He hid it well from people that he thought he had to. He was playing perfect student when it happened—he got all of us off of his trail.”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked when they were safely tucked in the apothecary. The rest of the group were waiting for them in there but Draco ventured upstairs in an effort to collect himself without prying eyes. Harry, of course, followed, not being able to keep to himself.
Draco nodded. “Of course.” Harry gave him a quick peck on the cheek and disappeared. Draco turned to find Blaise but he was already gone as well, probably hoping to find Ginny. His eyes landed on Theo, who looked like he would rather be swallowed up by the Giant Squid than be in this situation, and Draco couldn’t help but feel pity for him. Nott’s father wasn’t someone to cross and he didn’t doubt that Theo truly had any choice in his role in the war. Still, with the Dark Mark on his arm, he knew it would be difficult to exist in the world. Nott met Draco’s eyes and flinched and looked away. He could smell the anxiety rolling off of him, and it made Draco feel worse.
“You never know with him: I’m sure he already knows because you needed to leave the school for treatment. You’re technically in Hogwarts’s care during school.”
Narcissa just smiled and took Draco’s hand gently into her own. “That’s not for you to worry about it, dear,” she said. Lucius didn’t say anything.
She sighed and smoothed back his hair. “Oh Draco—I’ve missed you too but I do wish you hadn’t picked up all of these Gryffindor sensibilities while we were separated.”
I appreciate everyone who has bookmarked, kudos'ed, commented, or just simply read this work--I always say I write for myself, but your kind words have definitely kept the process going in more ways than I can say--thank you <3
The Healer tried to conceal her mirth as she said, “He’ll settle down soon. He just got new pain potion. What are you doing out of bed, Mr. Potter?”
Harry answered with a kiss and his heart soared again. Draco pulled him close as the kiss deepened and Harry laughed into it, carding his fingers through his hair.
Despite the fancy digs, Harry looked paler than usual and had deep circles under his eyes, otherwise looking unharmed. His arms were still bandaged up, but it seemed as though that were just a precaution in case the bleeding began again. He was in a hospital gown that looked way to large for him, curled up on a sofa with a cup of tea in his hands, overgrown hair covering his face. He looked up at his father when he entered the room and visibly winced.
“I don’t recall me being the one who’s been throwing tantrums when the wind blows the wrong way,” Draco bit back. Remus aimed a glare his way, as if to tell him to watch himself, lest they witness another Potter meltdown.
Blaise was suddenly in the compartment with him, sitting opposite the Black Heir. “Hey.” He smiled nervously at him.
Harry shifted uncomfortably at the memory of it. “Instead of reliving anything or twisting old memories to make them more horrific, it’s like I’m in this bright, white space. It starts off very calm, but then,” he paused, leaning back into his chair. “This is going to sound crazy.”
The unlikely pair were mostly quiet as they patrolled the corridors. Nobody usually acted up on the train—everyone was too excited to return to school.
It had been quite a few weeks since Harry left with his friends to play hero and Draco didn’t feel any less betrayed or hurt. Did he misinterpret their relationship? What did he do to be deemed unworthy of actively fighting for the Light? He wanted to prove he was more than a coward but he didn’t seem to have the confidence of those around him. It was driving him spare.
Draco searched his face in concern, eyes crinkling as he sized him up. “Why wouldn’t I be here, Haz?”
Draco felt chastised and had to hold himself back from letting out a low whine in response, tilting his head to the side to expose his neck to Remus in apology. Remus blinked at the very wolf-like response but didn’t bring attention to it.
“Of course not!” Harry exclaimed. “Ron, you’re my best friend. I’ve just been having a really hard time.”
Draco looked around. “Yeah,” he replied lamely. “They were able to move me out of the emergency wing this time, I suppose.” As the kettle whistled, Draco took it off the stove top and poured into his mug. “Sure you don’t want any?” he asked, his tone a practiced even-keel.
Draco frowned. “I know. I let my jealousy come out in very negative ways. Harry’s refusal of friendship put a target on both your and Weasley’s backs. I was a spiteful child.”
, attempting to reach his best mate and help him. As his memory alerted him that this may very well be the moment Harry was terrified about for months, giving him pause, a nasty stinging hex cut through his leg and his knees buckled. “Damn it.” He desperately looked around to see who cast it, shielding himself from an onslaught of hexes, but he could not locate the culprit. In his haste to try and continue towards Blaise, leg burning, he stumbled smack dab into none other than Fenrir Greyback. Draco’s eyes were like saucers as he realized who he was face to face with, not expecting to see him in battle or dealing with wizarding affairs at all, despite turning him almost two years ago.
“I was just leaving.” Blaise looked toward Harry. “Don’t worry—they’ll get bored of this new development in a week. It all blows over, Antares.”
Harry frowned, thinking back to the mind games of the prior year that led to his godfather’s death. “I guess not.” He suddenly didn’t feel like celebrating any newfound powers to come. “I’m going to go work on summer reading,” he said, standing.
“I’m not afraid of Theo,” Draco responded, not noticing Harry was encroaching. “He still sleeps with a teddy.”
Classes blurred by as everyone anticipated the upcoming celebration. Most of the Eighth Years planned to attend as well as a few Seventh Years. All Houses were involved in the event, building the altar up in the courtyard with flowers and special objects. Sirius helped them set up large round tables for their own personal feast, and Flitwick charmed glass orbs to float above them, lighting the scene. It was going to be unforgettable.
“Oh please, like she’s not always giving you a cuddle,” he replied sitting down. “Did you see Pansy is back?”
After that first night of solace with Draco, Harry tried to squash his feelings down to no avail. He snuck out in the morning before Draco could wake up and realize that he had, indeed, spent the night curled up against him: Harry couldn’t face the rejection right now. Not like that night at the club.
Draco looked into the concerned eyes of the older werewolf, seeing something in them that he had only seen his mother give off when looking at him. He guessed he wasn’t completely unwanted here. “I promise,” Draco whispered. Remus gave him a tight smile and squeezed his shoulder. The next thing he knew was darkness.
They were silent for a bit after that. “I’m not used to this—having a Dad,” Harry admitted. Sirius felt panicked for a moment, worried that he was already overstepping. “It’s nice.”
blood, he realized with dread. And it was coming from Myrtle’s bathroom. He couldn’t get a scent of who or what it was, the taste of copper was beginning to overtake his senses.
Healer Jacobs nodded. “You’re perfectly healthy despite your lapse in heart function over 17 years.”
Harry’s quarters were pretty expansive it turned out: Sirius had to turn a corner from a kitchen area to actually find where he was located. The room was a sterile white, reminding him that they were in a hospital and not a five star hotel, but he had a nice sitting room that was separate from the hospital bed, and it looked like the bathroom was quite spacious as well. Sometimes being the savior of the wizarding world could have its perks, Sirius supposed.
He hadn’t heard that voice in awhile, he thought, and chanced opening his eyes. He was shocked to find he was no longer at Hogwarts, mid-battle. Instead, he was safe within the walls of the werewolf colony where he spent his first month in hiding, and Jack was running toward him, eyes bright with concern. This sight, coupled with the loss of blood, was dizzying and disorienting, causing Draco to promptly faint, something he later recognized was becoming one of his defining character traits—bully for him.
Harry nodded. “It’s the malaise, I’m sure of it. It just seeped into my mind last night and invaded my sleep.”
“Great,” Draco managed. “Fantastic.” Draco was quickly learning that nothing could ever be easy for him.
Hemione’s eyes widened. “How are you coherent? Muggles are usually unable to speak or communicate if they’ve been a coma that long.”
The very last time Harry knocked on Draco’s door in a full tirade was mid-October. He was  doing so well but found himself reeling from Pansy Parkinson putting the pieces together and it naturally spreading throughout the entire school. The morning’s
Harry tried his best to detach from himself as he spoke again. The memory of it all felt so overwhelming. “It’s so strange. He basically ripped me from Fred, and it took me a moment to recognize him. He looked like how he did before everything. He looked around my age, like he was still Tom Riddle. He spoke so desperately. He said that his soul had come back together in death, and he couldn’t believe the pain he had wrought. That he was completely out of his head. He said he’s haunted by everything and shrouded in pain and that he was so sorry. He pleaded for forgiveness and for me to tell everyone what had happened. He was clawing at my arms in desperation and it actually hurt. It…I think I might be sick, sorry.” Harry fled to the bathroom to sick up again, but only bile came. The stress of the dream was a lot for him to bear. It felt
“You know, if you keep frowning your face will get stuck like that,” Remus commented. The Weasley twins snorted from the other end of the table, which Draco responded with a glare. As Grimmauld Place was no longer safe, those that were able relocated to Black Manor: it was an effective way to root out spies, as only those who had pure intentions for the Lord and Heir of the Manor would be able to be let through and the Ancient magic that held the fireplace connection was stronger than any cloaking spells. Luckily, Grimmauld hadn’t been sold out yet, allowing those who knew of the place to show up and use the fireplace. Unfortunately, the ancient magic on the fireplace meant that those who were too scared to overlook handing Harry into the Ministry for safety could not be protected. Needless to say, the house was quite full most of the time.
Harry was scratching his hands up nervously, a tic that he hasn’t seem to have shaken despite successfully completing his program over the summer—old habits died hard. Draco pulled his right hand apart from the left, squeezing it reassuringly. “Almost there, Haz,” he said.
Sirius gripped his shoulder gently. “No, only a select few: Kingsley, Remus, and Draco. Nobody else knows besides your Healers.”
James looked down at their hands. “That’s got to be an illusion—you would usually feel a heartbeat there so you’re imagining it.”
"I know that it's painful. Having a crippling fever beforehand isn't great either. The Wolfsbane will help with that. It's not poisoning yourself, despite what my adoptive father likes to believe. It will give you relief. Your father has already provided more than enough funds for it from what I've heard. You won't have to worry about anything – just normal teenager stuff."
”, expending what felt like all of the magic he had. He didn’t care if he became a Squib after this, he needed to save Harry. He wasn’t going to fail him again. After what seemed like an eternity later, Harry’s eyes fluttered open. “Oh thank Merlin, you stupid idiot.” Draco exclaimed, then promptly passed out from exhaustion.
The chapter also explores a depressed mental state but I feel as though if you got this far you've already seen this type of content in the story.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, closing his eyes in frustration. Would he just get off his case, already? He slammed the book shut as he said, “I love Draco, Blaise. Ever think I’m just tired rather than having ire for someone who literally saved my life?” Blaise felt a full on Potter meltdown coming on and he instantly regretted beginning the conversation in the first place. He really was only trying to help.
Draco shrugged. “I honestly don’t know. I was so scared I would run into him during the Final Battle and when I didn’t, I was relieved. I don’t even know what I should say to him.”
Draco glared at Harry but was trying not to smile. He supposed he was rather rude to the Weasley family. His father had always instilled an annoyance for them for some reason: maybe there was some hidden feud he didn't know about. "You seem to have developed the same allergy as of late."
“Well you do have a Potter and Black rolled into one on your hands—he’s had a rough road. I’m just glad he’s alive to tell yet another tale.”
“You’re beginning to sound like a parrot,” Remus quipped and Draco rolled his eyes. “I’ll grab some stuff from home for you—any preferences?”
The rest of Christmas Day was pretty uneventful for Harry. After his panic attack which threw any notions of him being cured out the window, Harry let himself breathe a bit. He didn’t have to worry about being the perfect after-patient. He could be himself and that was okay.
“It’s okay, babe,” Sirius replied, very familiar with James’s teenage episodes and what to do when the room just couldn’t stay still. “Just focus on breathing, yeah? I’ll breathe with you.”
Remus waved him off as he began helping them with dinner, chopping up the vegetables lying in wait. “You look really healthy considering the full was last night—looks like Dad fixed you up well and good.”
Remus was waiting for him when he went back to his room. It had taken hours and his neck was so stiff and his eyes were burning from keeping them open for so long. Nevertheless, he smiled when he saw his quasi-father. “Hey.”
The former professor frowned. “I’m not actually sure about that. Sirius mentioned it to me a few times when we were kids. Did you get to see him?”
He chose a very early morning to do so, just a few days before Christmas. He leaned over Harry’s bed around 4am and in a hushed whisper said, “Oy, Potter. Wake up!”
There was a knock at the door then. Remus stood to answer it. Of course, it was Sirius, James, and Harry. “Everything alright?” Sirius asked. Draco wished he could sink into the couch and disappear. He didn’t feel ready to face anyone.
“You look like hell,” Harry remarked the morning of the transformation, handing Draco a bowl of soup. “Are you feverish again?”
Remus knelt next to him as he lay broken on the ground, feeling his forehead and frowning. “It’s not supposed to be this painful,” he murmured worriedly, causing Jack to crowd over him as well. “What do you think is the problem?”
Remus had been trying to overcorrect everyone else’s disposition towards him by practically smothering him. If Draco was in the living room by himself reading, Remus would miraculously find him and sit near him. If he was eating alone after everyone had finished, Remus would join him. It was as though his slip up after his first full moon was enough for Remus to put him on suicide watch. It was becoming mildly annoying to smell the pity day in and day out, but he had to admit that it was nice to see that he wasn’t completely abandoned in this new life situation.
Harry shrugged. “I dunno. I wanted to talk to him about the horcrux thing anyway. I just don’t know how to deal with my feelings towards him.” He leaned into Draco, not caring too much about public displays hidden in a closed train compartment. Draco, however, did, but allowed the Black Heir to rest on him anyway, wrapping an arm around him. Harry began scratching at his hands nervously as he anticipated the meeting. Draco grabbed a hold of them.
Markus’s steady hand continued to weave diagnostic spells as he tutted phrases like “Extremely malnourished,” “Broken arm and a sprained ankle—I dunno how you managed to climb seven flights of stairs,” and Harry’s personal favorite, “That is quite a bit of vampire coming up, how did you manage that one?” Harry supposed his entire medical history wasn’t readily available in a deteriorating castle, otherwise he couldn’t fathom the Healer being so nonchalant about it. Sirius just squeezed his hand as a silent warning not to get sassy with the medical professional but Harry returned a glance at him that clearly meant there would be no promises.
Lucius seemed to notice the inner struggle as he tried to salvage the conversation. “Draco, I will be atoning for the rest of my days, whether it is in an Azkaban cell or locked within the confines of the Manor. I’m not asking for your outright forgiveness—I know I have not made things easy and in fact have made it harder for you. I just want to be able to see you and try to work things out as much as we can. I couldn’t live with myself if I didn’t at least try to reconcile with you.”
Dumbledore nodded, looking solemn. “I am so sorry, my dear boy. I regret not making you aware of certain events that impacted your life. It was not my place to tell you about your heritage.”
“I wasn’t insinuating you didn’t. I’m insinuating that I don’t want to put you in a situation where you have to choose the safety of those around you over yourself. It’s not a fun place to be.”
Draco looked to McGonagall who looked livid but didn’t say anything. He felt the wolf getting angry inside of him and he remembered what Remus said about working on his emotions. Rather than having a screaming match with the most powerful wizard in Britain, Draco took the self-preservation route and got out of their sight.
"He knows," Draco said, "don't bother trying to save face." Draco looked at Harry with disdain. "Bill is trying to make me weirder." Why was he bringing Potter into this? His familiarity was strangely calming to him, he supposed. He was less ready to bolt out of the room now at any rate.
Sirius smiled. “Good. Now picture the clutter being placed into neat boxes or files. Maybe you’re sweeping them into a bin, one by one.”
“He’s still unstable,” Draco argued. “He pretends well but the panic attacks haven’t lessened that much—I still have to anchor him down sometimes.” Draco frowned. “I’m worried as to how he’s coping. I’m worried about his magic going haywire from stress. It’s all I’m good for these days: worrying. No wonder he left me behind.”
The moon shone brightly on him as he went as far as he could into the Garden to feel as though he were in the thick of it. He didn’t call on anyone and he hoped they weren’t watching. The Garden of Souls should welcome this, shouldn’t it? He was feeding it new life. He wasn’t going to make a fuss.
Draco’s face crumpled at the sight of him sitting next to him. “I’m so sorry, Harry. I’m so, so sorry.”
Harry and Sirius made it out of Hogwarts relatively unseen. Harry felt bad for not telling Hermione and Ron where he had gone, but he was sure they were busy enough attending to Ron’s family and dealing with Hermione’s parents.
He heard distant sobbing and was shocked to realize it was him as Draco pulled him tightly against his chest, rubbing soothing circles on his back.
Dumbledore reached across the desk and placed his hand over Draco’s in understanding. “You remind me of another from a less than welcoming family, but you sought help a little earlier and for that, I am grateful.” The older man smiled at Draco, something he had never experienced before. “I will grant you asylum, but I’m not guaranteeing you will enjoy the company.”
Harry blinked at the use of his name. “I’m sorry,” he said. “It’s just that I’m not used to sleeping alone.”
There wasn’t an immediate answer. Harry knocked louder this time. “Hey, wolf boy,” he whispered loudly. That seemed to illicit a response.
Harry nodded as though that was good, resigning himself to silence once more. He was beginning to look eerily similar to post-Azkaban Sirius, hair a mess, pallid features, and deep circles under his eyes. “I need to figure out who this R.A.B. is,” Harry mused, pulling out the note that he had been keeping on him at all times, obsessing over it even. “I thought maybe if I spoke to Hermione she’d have a hunch.”
“Remus!” Fenrir smiled and enveloped him into a tight hug of obvious familiarity. “How are you? You look thin.” Fenrir’s amber eyes raked over the younger werewolf in concern, taking in his worn robes and sullen features.
Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline at the mention of their Second Year. He was painfully aware of his father’s hand in the whole mess with Ginny and felt a little twinge of guilt every time he thought about it. “That was a horcrux you think?” he asked.
Sirius sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. “I’m not sure, honestly. The funerals will not delay but the trials will until you get back.”
he thought, grabbing the largest one that had a stopper. One more glance at the door and it was showtime.
“I’m on the tapestry? I didn’t see myself there before.” Harry was beginning to be distracted from his plight from the casual dialogue with Draco, to which he was thankful.
Draco winced at that. “I know that’s not a great feeling. Harry,” he began carefully, “are you eating okay? You’re really thin.”
Not thirty minutes after the clothes debacle, Draco was sat in a booth in the back of one of his favorite clubs while he watched the savior of the wizarding world get absolutely trashed.
The looks lingered until Dumbledore began speaking again. “A new rule this year is for our Prefects,” he said. “To better aid our school, all Prefects Sixth Year and above will be asked to use only the Prefects’ dorm for their sleeping quarters. If there is an emergency during the night, we will be better able to reach you this way. There will be a special way to access these from your respective Common Rooms.’
Remus just shook his head, growing more pallid each moment the door remained closed. “If you don’t open the door willingly, I’m going to have to do it myself,” he pressed.
Theo just nodded at him as he sat next to Draco, shoulders stiff and looking quite uncomfortable. “What’s the plan for today, Professor?” Draco asked finally when it was apparent his fellow Slytherin wasn’t going to speak.
. “I need something stronger for this conversation, sorry. Why is there a lock on the liquor cabinet: oh right.”
TEEENY TINY update for everyone: I had to get this section out and it didn't really work as anything but a stand alone. Enjoy!
Draco was looking forward to a silent nighttime patrol. He and Ron had split up to make shorter work for the both of them; they had been Prefects long enough to not need to be continuously paired. It was odd, being quasi friends with a Weasley, multiple Weasleys if he was being honest with himself. They both were ever-aware of their families’ blood feud, but Draco was coming to realize more and more the ridiculousness of some Pureblood customs. He wondered if that was Dumbledore’s plan when he said Sixth Year Prefects were to only sleep in their quarters. While aggravating at first, and definitely feeling like an overreach in the old man’s protective nature, Draco had found himself thankful for this rule: he was becoming more civil with the right people in addition to being safe from vengeful Slytherin dormmates, namely Theo.
The full moon left Draco retching and shivering once more. His body was so tired that he was beginning to believe that Harry leaving him behind was the right call—he was constantly on edge and the stress on his body did not help the situation. He heard groaning in the direction of the living room and dragged himself out of bed to help Remus.
“This is so frustrating,” Ron said, resting his head on the wall as he leaned back in the chair. Draco sat opposite from him on his four poster, legs swinging anxiously. This was weird for him; he and Ron avoided each other mostly. To have this one on one time was almost too much for his nerves.
Harry pulled together as much Gryffindor courage as he could muster and approached the two. Pansy looked put out to have to so much as look at Harry, but Blaise had a huge grin on his face. “Antares!” he exclaimed. “To what do I owe this pleasure?”
Another week of hospital food, brilliant. But he knew he had to be polite to the people saving his life. “I’m glad you figured it out—thank you.”
Harry pulled away from James, smiling a genuine smile that he hasn’t been able to pull off since before the incident. “I’m so glad Draco told me about this place. This is the best Christmas I’ve ever had, anxiety attacks aside.”
Markus leaned back. “Like I said before, you’ll need to work on some of that Slytherin self-preservation that you seem to have lost and begin to recognize your limits, but you’re a really decent natural healer—with practice you can help a lot of people. There is a place for you here after you complete your general education.”
Luckily, Draco was the sole late arriver coming down the hallway. When he saw what was happening he rushed toward the Black Heir, appearances and danger be damned.
“Nothing. I just don’t want to overwhelm him,” Harry lied. The reality, of course, was that the mention of Draco helping in any way made Harry want to tuck him away somewhere where nobody could find him.
“Been better, honestly,” Draco replied. He gripped Remus’s hand again as he felt another shock of pain. He let out a small cry.
“The magic associated with the Hogwarts registry probably recognized the shift and didn’t know what to do with two fathers” Remus tried to explain, to which Harry responded with that glare. Remus raised his hands in defense. “I don’t control that magic, Harry, there’s not much I can do about it.”
pretty common with the Black family—Sirius has a knack for it but hates it. He tries to ignore the visions as best as possible to avoid being lost in them. I’m pretty pants at it, honestly.” Harry just nodded thoughtfully. “What was the vision that has you mute?”
“Harry, then.” Snape was obviously well-versed in calming dramatic teen magic antics. His voice was almost gentle with Harry, even after his biting remarks towards the man. Snape was working his best to deescalate the situation. “I forgot something in my office, why don’t we head back that way and you can tell me what’s on your mind?”
Draco, already drifting off, was hearing none of it. “They’ll find you eventually. Shh, I’m dreaming now.”
Ron let out a big breath. “Jeez.” Ron patted his knee affectionately. “Well, we’ll get this sorted, I’m sure, no sense starving yourself – come on.” Harry blinked. Was that all that was to be said?
“Thank you for letting me stay, Mr. Black,” Draco could hear Blaise saying from his room. He cursed his extra-sensitive hearing: he’d rather not know when his friend would arrive. He looked towards Hedwig’s cage: she had gone out hunting. Draco was surprised Harry left her behind but at least she kept Draco company, though he guessed he’d have someone new to keep him mind now and at least he would speak back to him. He missed his own owl: he wondered what happened to him. Ginny ducked her head in in that moment.
Lucius rubbed his face tiredly. “Draco, you have liked Harry Potter since you could talk,” he said. Draco’s face heated up, thinking back to his imaginary Harry Potter friend growing up. That refusal of friendship at eleven really took a toll on him after telling everyone how much they’d get on. “No matter how much I’ve tried to keep you away from that boy, the two of you are like magnets. Why couldn’t you have stuck with Blaise?” he lamented.
“Sorry if I’m not buying this but you didn’t seem to question anything—in fact I recall slurs being thrown my way.”
Sirius blinked, realizing he just divulged some secret information. “You didn’t know? I thought you’d know.”
“Well, hello.” Remus rummaged in his drawer and procured a chocolate bar, offering it to Draco. He took it gratefully. “How are you feeling?”
Draco squeezed back, unable to express how being called ‘good’ for once felt. “Come back later?” he opted for instead.
“And is there some secret therapist in the Forest of Dean we need to know about?” they both jumped at Draco in the doorway. “Haven’t heard you respond this maturely since
Draco frowned. “I think the feeling was there for Father. I’m not sure he ever felt much for me emotionally - at least not enough to block a disownment.”
Harry rolled his eyes at the nickname. “Can I have a word?” he asked. Pansy leaned forward in interest. “In
He was still exhausted, but he threw a glamour at his face before they left to lighten his dark circles and put on a pair of dark jeans and a green button down shirt that he probably stole from Draco, attempting to negate any indications that he was feeling more lost than ever. He just hoped everyone bought it.
He was told to meditate in the days leading up to the moon as it would help in remaining connected to his conscious during the night. A practiced Occlumens, Draco did as he was told quite easily, letting the comfort of mindlessness take over for an hour each day. Nobody around him seemed frightened by the moon, in fact, they seemed excited at the prospect of joining together under the cover of darkness. Even Remus, who he was sure was self-loathing at best, seemed to be happy to be changing with everyone. Draco couldn’t share in their excitement – he was all nerves.
He hadn’t realized he was screaming until the magic surrounding Blaise’s core finally yanked free and poured itself into Draco as though he were a sieve, reaching for his own core and suffocating him. Draco refused to let it settle inside of him and pushed all of his energy toward the vial—the magic expelled into it and Draco quickly placed the stopper back on, falling back onto his heels as he sank to the ground.
“Of course,” she responded in surprise, not used to Harry offering anything near gratefulness after the past few months. “I wouldn’t want you or Malfoy on guard the whole time.”
“You make it sound so romantic,” Sirius said with a laugh. “It is fun though. My parents would throw ragers at the Manor in the Garden. Regulus and I would sneak off with as much food as we could carry and throw our own party with our cousins. Sometimes all the families would get together. It’s a much quieter affair nowadays.”
The first time he called for Regulus his uncle squeezed him so tightly he thought he was alive for a moment. He pulled back to take him in, Harry finding it odd to almost be looking in a mirror. “You’ve done it,” Regulus said, smiling brightly. “I’m so proud.”
“I wish you could join me.” Draco was scenting him again, his eyes aglow from the moonlight. When he got like this his blackened eye almost returned to its normal hue, alight with his werewolf magic. It took Harry’s breath away. “Could mark you under the moon.” Draco kissed his neck where he had been nuzzling, as though he were choosing a spot for said marking.
Draco wanted to get out of bed to embrace Harry at that but was still struggling to walk on his own. He could only watch from afar as Remus comforted Harry. He didn’t know what either of them did to deserve Remus in their lives but he was glad for him. He was shocked at how gentle and caring Remus could be after knowing he was raised by Fenrir Greyback who was gruff at best. However, Draco noticed the soft spot Fenrir had for Remus: he somehow found himself appreciative of the elder wolf for taking his quasi parent away from an abusive path. He wondered if that’s what Remus was trying to do for him in turn.
“Why didn’t they call Remus?” He didn’t care about the look of hurt that flashed across his father’s face. He deserved to feel guilty. “What happened?”
“I can handle your bad days, you know,” he murmured into his ear, “you’ve dealt with plenty of mine.”
Harry pulled back. “You’re hurting me.” Sirius released him as though he were stung, a string of apologies on his lips. Harry cut him off, giving him a side hug. “It’s okay—I know it was reactionary.”
“I feel like I’ve missed an entire side of the Wizarding World,” Harry mused as he listened to Draco describe the details of the event. “It’s like an entire heritage I had no idea about.”
Draco nodded, still looking down. Tears were pooling in his eyes again and he felt so vulnerable. “I understand if you don’t want to see me anymore,” he said, barely above a whisper.
Draco nodded in agreement. Confrontation with Harry was a volatile act these days; sometimes objects would shake around him during moments of high emotional stress. Draco recalled a calmer day during the summer when the Black Heir was working on homework in deep concentration—the desk, chair, as well as Potter himself were levitated about 4 feet in the air. Harry had definitely come into his full powers and it was setting itself loose upon the world. Draco wondered if they’d put a dampner on him for classes.
The two sat in amiable silence after that, Draco slowly sipping on his tea, listening to the creaks and gives of the house and enjoying the warmth emitting from his…well he didn’t really know what he and Harry were did he?
Draco, seeing the doom spiraling ready to go, tried to stop it in its tracks. “Of course not – she knows you’re having a rough go of it. Not the most ideal way to spend a sixteenth birthday is it?”
Draco grimaced. “Forgot to mention that. Your dad is bringing him—Sirius, not James. His trial is at the end of the week and he wants to see me.”
“Uh, yeah,” he offered in return. At the ex-Malfoy’s raised brow, Remus continued. “When I was turned, my mother took it as an opportunity to abandon me. She didn’t really like the abnormal. Frankly, I think I cramped her style to begin with – not really the mothering type. My father ruthlessly persecuted werewolves for years and I think he took my mother’s abandonment as a blessing. He did continue to financially support me, though. Paying for schoolbooks, keeping the village well-kept so I didn’t suffer much. Fenrir took me in without question. I was younger than his usual victims. I got attached. Hence, dad.”
“My father would be so happy to hear you say that,” Draco joked and Hermione blushed at the notion. “Honestly, that’s been the argument for decades but of course zealots latch onto it and go full pureblood supremacy with it so the Ministry had kept everything sanitized over the years. All of the old rites are extracurricular reading for those who want to learn more. Some apprenticeships exist but they’re pretty taboo with how suffocating the Ministry has been about it. That’s why I’m surprised to hear you want to have an altar this year, Ron. I didn’t think your family would continue the tradition.”
James looked at Remus and Sirius. “Ready?” They just nodded. James took a deep breath. “Okay.” He stepped out into the Garden.
The day Harry had to meet with Dumbledore was the worst. He thought he could keep this newfound alias he came up with, and shed the savior image. He became completely irate when he was told that it wouldn’t work – that it would just be business as usual. He had launched a string of curses at Dumbledore, accusing him of doing this to him – which probably wasn’t far from the truth, regardless of how close the older wizard was keeping his cards to his chest. He stormed out and into his room with a loud bang, forcing Draco out in the dead of night when everyone finally went to bed.
“It was his punishment for losing the prophecy. His ‘pure’ son tarnished. Draco requested asylum before it all went down but he was intercepted.”
Sirius nodded solemnly. “It crushed me when I was your age. I remember it all being too much. Wasn’t too much better in adulthood either, to be quite honest.”
“You snuck up on me,” Sirius said, but agreed, following her to the kitchen. He sat at the table while the slightly older woman fixed him a mug, which he took gratefully.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and scrunched his eyes shut, unwilling to let himself lose it. He’d whine to Blaise later about it. “Fuck. Okay. When does he want to see me, then?”
“How did it even happen?” Lucius asked. His hand twitched as though he was holding back from reaching out. Draco leaned back just in case his father actually got the urge.
“I know you’ve only been here a few days, but how is it all going?” Healer Turner asked once they got settled in the sitting room.
Hearing Harry sniffling on the balcony the night prior to leaving had Draco’s mind made up about the one thing he could actually do for Remus and Harry but he had to make sure he had access. When everyone was finally asleep that night, he crept into the tapestry room, taking special care to miss any creaky floorboards or bumping into creature. He looked at the familiar fireplace with determination, gripping his wand in bunched nerves.
“I know what I can and can’t handle.” Nevertheless, Draco was looking worse for wear after fixing Remus up, shaking slightly with sunken eyes.
“Are you serious?” Draco interrupted. “He’s obviously got substance abuse issues and you’re not bringing in a Mind Healer.”
Harry lost his ability to speak again and looked at Sirius helplessly. “We might have been a bit naughty, Jamie.”
“And,” Kingsley continued before Harry could voice that opinion, turning to the other two-thirds of the Golden Trio, “to Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, for they are heroes in their own right and have weathered a storm they were not fated to bear. We thank them for their sacrifice.”
Bill scrunched his face in understanding. “I know. We can’t freeze you with magic either, though. We don’t want to set off anything in your eye.”
The two unlikely allies in seclusion made their way to the kitchen, finding Ron and Hermione having an in depth discussion with Remus. “I just think he’d be safer in our House, don’t you agree?” Hermione had said. Remus had a frown gracing his features, seemingly conflicted about something.
Harry grimaced. “Rather not to be honest. Hermione was so fast; threw a stinging hex right at my face so I wouldn’t be recognized.” His grimace turned to a prideful smile as he thought about his friend. “I’m so glad she and Ron are safe. Did you tell them to stay put?”
Ginny smiled sympathetically, patting him on the shoulder. “Been there, I’m afraid. If it gives you any solace, I think you were instrumental in getting the gang back together: Harry had lost it a year ago. I thought they’d never make up.”
Remus found himself victim of the infamous ice glare so commonly worn by members of the Black family any time he tried to speak to Harry. It was so eerily similar to Sirius’s facial expression of betrayal that it left the werewolf reeling every time it was critically aimed toward him. He was met with that stare the morning sixth year letters arrived.
“You shouldn’t even be here. You chucked him out of your life as soon as he became different! Now that he’s half normal again you’re showing interest?” Half normal? What did that even mean?
Draco frowned as he stood, rummaging through his drawers for a new set of pajamas for Harry to change into, his joggers and shirt soaked through in sweat. “I don’t know how the Dreamless Sleep didn’t work. I don’t understand.” He handed Harry the clothes, who began to shakily get changed, uncaring about Draco seeing him in a state of undress. They were a satin gray set, much too luxurious for Harry, and the legs were too long, fitting over his feet with ease. They hung loosely as he was still trying to gain weight back from the remnants of the rotting curse.
“Let’s keep it that way, yes?” Harry rolled his eyes again but nodded. “Stay with them anyway for me? In case our old friend Tom comes knocking again?”
Turner pulled out a deep purple potion next. “This is for sleep. You don’t look like you’ve been getting much.”
“No, Harry,” Remus said. “I believe this is your true inheritance coming through. It would seem that some sort of glamours broke down when you came into your full power.”
James just shrugged. “I dunno. Sometimes I was triggered by something—most of the time I couldn’t control a negative thought and got caught in a spiral. It was tough during the war. I rarely slept.”
James looked down. “Odd, isn’t it? I didn’t think I could have earthly objects affect me like this.”
James carded his fingers through Harry’s hair, happy to have him around for the moment. “I don’t want you wasting away in Black Manor. I can always check in from afar.”
” He willed. Where was this coming from? He kept repeating the mantra over and over as literal light began to shoot from his fingertips and into the wounds. The bleeding had stopped, whether it was from Harry bleeding completely out or Draco’s magic, he didn’t know but he pressed on. Draco was beginning to tire but he knew he needed to keep going until he heard the heartbeat getting a bit stronger. He felt someone finally run into the room but he couldn’t take his focus off of the task at hand. Something had truly taken him over and it was frightening and exhilarating.
He knew how Draco felt about him if that drunken night was any indication, so he tried to mask his feelings by stone-facing it through the first few weeks of school. He would only bother Draco if absolutely necessary. He’d let the ex-Malfoy Heir get his bearings with his housemates in peace.
Healer Turner looked like he hadn’t had much sleep either when he entered Harry’s room. His auburn hair was rivaling Harry’s old look and his dark green eyes looked a bit duller than usual. He was in Muggle looking scrubs rather than the lime green Healer’s robes Harry had become so accustomed to during his time at the hospital. “I didn’t think wizard doctors wore those,” Harry commented.
He frowned as he thought about not seeing Draco, but he knew he would be safe now. He would understand. Harry was just so tired.
He tried to keep up on school work, but between the potions that made him woozy and intermittent jabs of pain that would course through his body, Draco couldn’t find the will to concentrate too heavily. Mostly, he settled for reading novels, wanting to imagine himself to be anywhere but here.
Sirius sighed. “My dad wasn’t much help either. He probably encouraged it behind closed doors. It was suffocating.”
Harry yanked the book back, finding his page and dog-earring it. “Yes. After divine intervention and slaying a bunch of innocents,” he replied grimly.
Draco turned grey at that. Bill rolled his eyes. “Basil, your bedside manner is atrocious, has anyone ever told you that?”
Draco sighed. “Not really, no. I’ve had a dull headache since it happened and some eye strain, but I feel fine.”
“You’ll do great,” Draco said, squeezing his shoulder. “Tomorrow is going to be so healing for everyone, I just know it.”
He stood there for a few minutes, waiting for the familiar waves of calm to surround him. He even tried crossing to see if he could, to no avail. He felt dizzy as the realization took hold that he might actually be with the living again. He sank to his knees as he said, “I think I’m going to be sick.”
Regulus sat them down at a bench, bringing Harry back to the first time he found himself in the Garden. It was so peaceful here and still was. Harry just wanted peace.
Harry nodded, feeling numb. Could his life ever belong to him? He sent a silent prayer to Mother Magick that this was all just a nightmare, but he felt like he knew the truth of it already. “Do you think it has something to do with my attempts?” he asked.
The two just looked at each other for a few moments, air thick with unspoken thoughts. Where would they go from here, Draco wondered.
Harry sat and groaned. “Not you, too,” he joked. “Honestly, I’m dreading graduation because I have no clue what I want to do.” He smiled at her. “Planning on retiring?”
Pansy sighed. “How myopic of you. Of course some are more gifted than others, Potter for one. Anyone can scry though or read leaves. It takes practice. So do most of the Old Ways. A lot of them get marked as dark magic but they’re not—they’re just more connected with Mother Magick and the elements.”
That night, he and Ron were quietly discussing what to do about Harry in Draco’s room. Being a Prefect allotted private quarters: the dorm was essentially a long hallway with sets of doors leading off to single rooms equipped with a four poster, a desk, and a window. It was quite nice and quite private, exactly what the two needed to not arise too much suspicion speaking to one another.
James frowned. “We’ll talk to your Healers about it, okay?” Sirius said. “But you’re right about them wondering what you’re up to. We’ll have to say something.”
“Tell you what, I’ll keep an eye out for him with the Gryffindors if you’ll do the same in Slytherin. I’m sure there’s a huge ‘X’ on his back for saving ‘The Chosen One.’”
Jack shifted uncomfortably. “On the surface, maybe. He loves Rem too much to truly do that, though.”
Quietly closing the door was about all he could do before he began to feel as though his chest was closing in on him. Harry was relying on a quiet train ride to get him through until the holidays; Blaise outing him was a shock. He heard an angry tone of Draco and a stomping away but his heart was pounding so hard in his ears he couldn’t hear anything.
Remus squeezed Harry’s shoulder gently and Harry collapsed in his arms, obviously in the throes of emotional overdrive. Draco tried not to be jealous that he had to share Remus’s fatherly affections – he wasn’t used to that. “You had some time, though. You were able to get to know him a little bit.”
Draco smiled at Harry encouragingly, despite his misgivings about the situation. “Voldemort is a drama queen, he wouldn’t make non-descript items horcruxes: he’s probably created them out of the most ostentatious things. With Dumbledore’s help, batty as he is, I’m sure we can get to the bottom of it.”
“This is so cool.” He held up the mirror. “James Potter,” he called into it. James’s face appeared about ten seconds later.
“I’ve been dying to do that for ages,” Harry grinned after pulling apart, sitting at the edge of Draco’s bed. “I’ve missed you.”
Turner frowned. “He’s not too pleased but he understands the situation. I know it makes him feel fuzzy—he likes to have hit wits about him, as would anyone.”
“Honestly today, I just need some help organizing lessons for the end of the week. I promise we’ll get to do more career-centric activities soon, but with us going away I want to make sure everything is organized for Professor Potter.”
"This isn't going to make you 'weirder'," Bill explained. "It will hardly affect you at all. It will balance you."
The blonde sighed. That was two weeks away and he needed details—he desperately needed to know if Blaise was okay. “Fine—as long as Remus arrives soon to fill me in.”
Draco thought about it. “It’s not really a prophecy, though. You’re just seeing a potential timeline.”
Draco’s smile turned into a grin, but it faltered as he read Remus’s body language. “Why the long face, then?”
Molly aimed her own glare at Harry. “I have six sons, do you really think I’m going to budge? Let’s go.”
“Shame.” Harry nodded in response. Blaise sobered once more. “He’s doing alright? I feel bad about the last time I spoke to him.”
dealing with that so it isn’t a lie. You can tell who you want discreetly, but this would be a good cover for the rest of the world.”
Harry sighed and sat up. “Can we go out?” he asked. Draco started at that, snapping his head up to meet Harry’s eyes. He looked determined – or rather desperate.
Draco huffed, wishing he had remained tucked away in Sirius’s old room. How could someone so intelligent be so daft at times? “I’m not giving up my position because I’ve been ostracized. Not everyone in Slytherin is tied to him; we have enough unkind Slytherins – I’m not going to just abandon the ones that need protection.”
The Slytherin just nodded. “He’s already told me where I stand. I’m not trying to wreck things for him. I just care about him.”
Remus just raised an eyebrow. “Professor Potter is assisting many of us this term, mainly our Headmistress, but I assure you he is quite capable. He’s faced down Voldemort enough times to prove his merit.”
They sat in silence together, the air thick with unexamined tension. “It’s about 6 p.m.—are you hungry?” Sirius finally voiced. “You slept most of the day away.”
“Don’t apologize for things out of your control,” Harry joked, voice raspy. “Can I get some water?” Sirius waved his hand and a glass came flying into the room, which he caught with ease. “Cool trick. Thanks.” Harry took the offered glass.
Draco hadn’t had much contact with Harry as of late. The Black Heir was generally off somewhere alone, aside from the odd Quidditch practice, having successfully gotten off probation a few weeks prior. He had tried to make amends with him after Harry’s last meltdown but Harry seemed to not want anything to do with anyone, spending most of his free time outside by the lake smoking, battered Odyssey in his hand. At least he wasn’t drinking anymore, even if Harry was cross with everyone.
“Draco!” Harry called as the blonde bolted off. If Harry was following, he surely wouldn’t be able to keep up, Draco running at supernatural speed through the castle doors.
Lucius’s trial went as Draco assumed—no jail, but a short-term house arrest and probationary period. His mother only took the stand to testify. The two would stay in the Malfoy residence in London while the Ministry tore apart their ancestral home board by board until all the dark magic was excavated from its depths. They would be lucky if the manor was standing by the end of it.
“Didn’t you hear?” Healer Markus pulled the Prophet from Draco’s hands and flipped a few pages, face scrunched in concentration. “Ah!” he finally said, putting the newspaper back in Draco’s hands. “Right there. Go on.”
Draco felt so lost. He wasn’t sure how he could get past this new development. He felt wild and out of place. He longed for the werewolf village. “I think I should see Healer Turner.”
“Yes, Dad. Healer Turner has a lot of patients: this can wait until tomorrow.” He smiled. “Thanks for caring so much, though. I’m not used to adults actually being in my corner. It’s nice.”
Harry sat next to Draco, who was looking down at his mug still resting on the table. “You okay?” he asked softly.
“Uncle Regulus?” Harry echoed, a grin spreading over his features for the first time in weeks. “That’s brilliant! I can go talk to him!” Harry sprung up.
“It’s to appear attractive to potential ‘prey’ and also to gain favor based on aesthetics. We get a bad wrap in the wizarding world, we need anything we can get to survive. Fenrir’s pack is also immortal. If we aged, we’d look a bit odd later on, don’t you think?”
Ron laughed. “Very kind? Do you mean really, really sexy? I think you mean really, really sexy. That’s what most people say about me, you know.”
The next morning, Potter had reported that he'd slept well again, and had been in another brilliant mood.  He’d cooked breakfast again, and then lingered around after they washed up the breakfast dishes, before finally telling Draco thank you and leaving. Draco had felt the loss of him for the rest of the day, and found it more than a little disturbing that he’d gotten used to Potter’s presence so damn quickly.
. Definitely interested. Um. I get off at midnight?” The poor bloke looked terribly turned on already, like he might come in his tight jeans if provoked any further.
It was only a split-second later that he felt something fall on his head. Not anything heavy; no, it was soft and light, whatever this was, and almost sticky. Like silk and like Velcro, or glue.
“Miss Granger and Mr. Malfoy?” asked a voice behind them, and they turned to see a much younger man in a button-up shirt and gray trousers, without the priest’s collar.
She was wearing a lovely navy sheath dress with a matching cropped blazer and high heels and pearls, and her hair was in a low chignon. She looked a million times better than almost anyone out there would look. “You’re lovely,” he said. “Just right.”
you’d be here at this godforsaken hour of the morning, doing whatever it is you plan on doing, and I thought that was the easiest way to get you.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco said. But that wasn’t true. “I’m not sorry, though, really. Cassius isn’t fit to lick your shoe.”
They were talking about Harry’s extra security detail. Draco had two bodyguards accompanying Harry to everything on the schedule and taking him home. He also had another guy watching Grimmauld Place. That incident with Harry’s roof had scared the hell out of Draco, and even though Grimmauld Place was more secure than the townhouse had been, he was still worried. He didn’t want any dark wizards going anywhere
Possibly for that reason, the roof of Harry’s townhouse was blown off a few days later. Blown clean off and thrown up into the air, and it had come crashing back down, basically leveling the place. The muggle press blamed an unusual weather pattern for the damage. Harry was mostly grateful that Sarah had already moved into Pansy’s flat when it happened.
He dreamt that night of creamy, pale skin, of sharp hip bones and fine, blonde hair trailing down to a waistband of black boxer-briefs. In his dream, he was kissing along the elegant line of a shoulder, to a stubbled jaw, and he’d been achingly hard. Then he awoke to a face-full of Ginny’s red hair, and it smelled, suddenly, too sweet, and she felt too soft in his arms, and everything just felt wrong and off and strange.
“Oh, Jesus, is he ever,” said Harry, running a hand through his hair. He looked positively edible in a a short pair of navy swim trunks and nothing else. He had hair on his chest, Draco couldn’t help but notice; a nice little patch of it. Draco remembered when Harry didn’t have any hair there yet, when he’d been all skinny limbs and smooth, boyish skin. He was beautiful then, but he looked even better like this. Draco could admit that much, although he was refusing to let himself wonder what it would feel like to press his chest to Harry's, to have that hair tickling over his skin. No, he would not think about that. Not even for a moment.
sell it. “Don’t say that,” Draco said. “You were wonderful.” He let his breath hitch at the end, just a bit, and sucked in a breath like he might cry. Salazar, he deserved a BAFTA for this shit.
“Because there has been too much bloodshed over the land. And there will be much more if someone doesn’t broker peace.”
he was entirely. He was floating in a sea of softness, of cool, crisp sheets, and he was naked and felt so good and so sleepy. Above him was a bright white, arched ceiling, painted almost golden with soft morning light. He started to fall back asleep.
Big Ham cleared his throat and Draco blinked and looked around. He had lost himself entirely to the story; as Big Ham talked, he could actually picture the things he described: the lonely bog, the brave twins, the beast.
“And Robards is too polarizing. There are too many people who hate him for things he’s done as Head Auror.”
–“ Harry began, wanting to ask why Molly assumed Malfoy would be beating his child, but then there was a commotion on the front steps behind him.
it wasn't like he was fucking desperate to snog Potter, no, that was certainly not the case, no way, and if he enjoyed it a little too much, well, that wasn't his fault, now, was it?), whatever-the-fuck it was he was feeling kept getting worse. Draco had whiplash from the speed at which Potter had somehow managed to become one of the most important people in his life, had, somehow, become an absolute fixture in his days and in his nights.
“No,” he sighed, leaning back against the bright pink wall of Pansy’s bathroom. “I suppose they wouldn’t.”
“You don’t know. Well, you must be from far away, then,” she said, stepping back. “I’ll be out with your pies shortly.”
“Yeah, yeah,” said Ron, digging his thumbs in so that Harry winced a little. It hurt, almost, but in a wonderful way. “It’s called stretching, Harry. Look into it. ‘Mione has me doing yoga a couple mornings a week –”
“I – no. I’m not. Just…you can’t do that, you know? Not just with Ron, but, like, generally. With married men.”
It was because of Draco’s insomnia that Blaise had come into his bed in the first place. Draco always thought Blaise was fit, but then,
“Hermione did. And it doesn’t hold forever, you know. Just for longer. Could be an hour longer, or a minute longer. I have no idea.”
Draco shivered at the words, and felt his cock pulse, like he could come from Harry’s voice alone. “Fuck me,” he whispered. “Fuck me, Harry.”
Draco took a hesitant sip. It tasted sweet and a little cinnamon-y. Not terrible. He downed the rest and made his way over to the next solder. It was Pike, he realized, the giant Marchman who was one of the company’s best swordsmen. He had a deep wound through the flesh right above his elbow, and another in his side. He was lucid, though, which was a good sign.
But the worst part was his face, that beautiful face, gazing out from the cover with a slightly amused expression, like he might find you worth his time, possibly, but he wasn’t quite sure yet. As Draco watched, he rested his chin on his thumb, a knuckle skimming over his bottom lip, and then looked off to the side like there was something more fascinating over there. He looked aloof and sexy and untouchable, and if this was Draco’s reaction to the
“Okay, it was difficult. I had a really awful dream, and I got stuck in the in-between for a long time and couldn’t wake up completely. Probably took too much Dreamless, which didn’t even fucking work anyway, because I still had dreams. But…” He sighed. “I’m probably just tired today. Didn’t ever go back to sleep.”
“Why were you jealous?” Draco was staring at Harry with an expression of complete calm and Harry had to dig his fingers into the pillow to keep from curling his hands into fists.
He’d never met a girl so forward, so blatant about what she wanted. Who wore her promiscuity like a badge of honor instead of treating it like a dirty secret. It was slightly terrifying but also thrilling. And more than a little sexy. And really, people shouldn’t be afraid of admitting they liked sex. It was stupid to pretend otherwise. Harry was very guilty of that, of pretending like he didn’t have feelings that were, now that he thought about it, perfectly natural.
Draco nodded and began to move slowly, carefully. Harry watched his face, how tightly he held himself, how he was forcing himself to be slow and controlled. “Draco, you’re not going to hurt me. I’m okay.”
Hannah looked at her watch, nodding, her blond hair bouncing. “Right. It’s time.” She cast an amplifier spell over him so his voice would reach everyone in the crowd, and gestured to the podium that had been set up, a “DRACO” sign spelled to the front. They had wanted to emphasize that it was Draco, and de-emphasize the Malfoy name. Draco’s name was unique enough that the polls regarding name-recognition indicated that this would not be a problem.
Draco stood and took it, hating how formal this felt, how it was like Harry was trying to erase all that had happened between them.  He hated it so much that he couldn’t stop himself from pulling Harry towards him and wrapping his arms around Harry’s overly warm body. After a moment, Harry hugged him back, so tightly he could hardly breathe.
On the fourth day, the road began to wind this way and that as they traveled through foothills. In the distance, Draco could see white-capped mountains. “The Etherean Mountains,” Frankie explained. “Where the Ethereans came through their Sacred Door hundreds of years ago.”
Seamus was home, sitting around in pants and listening to Quidditch. As Harry expected, he thought the whole thing was great fun. He decided that he was going to order the most expensive of everything, just as a fuck you to Dominic. Harry said that was probably fine. He doubted Dominic would even care.
By the time they apparated back to Harry’s, they were beyond pissed. Harry could hardly see straight. They messily jerked one another off in Harry’s foyer. It was stupid, but also scratched a very intense itch that Harry’d had ever since seeing Malfoy strip. The itch had been even worse since the little backrub session with Ron on Friday. So, Harry couldn’t regret it entirely, even though it was Seamus. A man had needs, after all.
the group, everyone was expected to conduct themselves with some level of restraint, and to their minds, both Malfoy and Euri had breached the informal code of conduct.
Draco wasn’t certain how to respond to that. “Do you take milk?” he asked instead, even though he knew, from the other timeline, that Harry essentially drank milk with a splash of tea in it.
“I – yes. But I’m not going. I won’t. You can’t make me.” Merlin’s beard, he sounded like he was twelve.
But then Snape had come and healed him, and Harry had fled, and he’d lived. He’d lived and carried out his orders after all, at least until it came time to kill Dumbledore. That, he could not do, despite his almost overwhelming fear of the consequences if he failed.
“It’s okay,” Charlie said, waving it off. “So what happened? Why were you walking around in the rain?” He scooted over to the tub and took the little cup there and poured water over Harry’s head, then grabbed a bottle of shampoo and put a dallop into his hand and began to massage it into Harry’s hair. Harry sighed and relaxed into the feeling of Charlie’s hands.
He tried to grab for his wand but then realized his hands were tied up behind his back. Tied to the floor behind his arse.
As quietly and discreetly as possible, he let himself slip his hand underneath the waistband of his pants, trailing his fingers over the tip of his cock. He desperately wanted to yank his pants down, but he didn’t want to move or make too much noise, for fear that the spell would break, and Harry would stop.
Harry chuckled and wrapped his arms around Malfoy. “Sounds perfect,” he said. “Draco…” He took his pointy, beautiful chin in his fingertips and kissed him gently. “I really, really like you. I really like how this felt, this whole weekend, and I like the idea of this becoming a real thing. I’m also absolutely terrified, because, well. On a purely intellectual level, this seems quite mad and ill-advised. And because until Friday, I thought you hated me. Part of me is having trouble believing that you could actually like me. And it’s just…a lot.”
Astoria placed a brown sack on the table, along with a lidded paper cup. Coffee, it looked like. “Lunch,” she said to Harry. “In case you’re hungry.” Food sounded awful at the moment, but Harry thanked her anyway.
“Hey!” Harry called, relieved that Ron had come here first. He ran down the stairs. “I don’t want to go. Let’s just stay here and get fucked up, yeah? I don’t want to go see a bunch of blokes in thongs, really. I mean, it’s so stupid.”
Malfoy looked at him and shook his head. “I swear, I don’t ever have any idea what you’re going to do or say next, Potter.”
Draco huffed a bitter laugh. “Right. I’m so impressive.” He looked over Harry’s shoulder and scanned the room. “Why don’t you get back to Cian, Harry. You left him lonely. We can continue this incredibly depressing conversation another time, okay?”
He squeezed his eyes shut as he remembered Harry’s eyes that night after Draco had been in the cellar. How he’d looked at Draco with such love and concern; how things between them had been so easy, even though it hadn’t been easy at all, what with Pansy and Hermione and everything. But the connection between them had been so obvious, so strong, that it leant a sort of certainty to their interaction. Draco had known, without a doubt, that no matter what happened, they would still have each other.
All that next week at work, Harry couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy. What did Malfoy do every day? If he worked at night, did he sleep all day long? Did he have a second job? Probably not, if Dominic paid for his housing. Did he strip only on weekends, or during the week, too?
When Draco drew back again, he met Harry’s eyes. Harry was looking at him with such bruising tenderness that it almost broke him, but Draco steeled himself and looked back at Dolohov. “Happy?” he ground out.
Once he was up and about, he realized how chaotic it was in the palace and in the city. Hundreds of Rebel soldiers were still encamped outside the gates, and it took a great deal of effort to simply feed them. Some of the escaped wretchwolves had taken to the city streets to leave a trail of destruction in their wake. There was an ongoing hunt for them. Kerrick assured everyone that the beasts, being magically-made, could not reproduce, but everyone would sleep much easier knowing they had all been destroyed.
Merlin, Draco missed that woman. She’d passed away last year, and the wizarding world had lost an incredible political mind and Draco had lost a good friend.
“We picked up some of your friends,” said Travers a few days later, sticking his head into Draco’s room. Draco shot up from where he had been sprawled out idly on the floor. “We think it’s Hermione Granger and the Weasley kid. They’re with Vernon Dudley.”
Not to mention, they hadn’t ever spoken of that. Of course, they’d talked about getting home, about whether they would and, if they did, what they most wanted to do (Harry wanted to order a pizza and have a cup of tea, not necessarily at the same time; Draco wanted to shower and shave and get a haircut and wear freshly laundered clothes). But they hadn’t talked about what going home would mean for them, or whether there would be a ‘them’ at all.
Harry stood there, stock still, for several long minutes, letting his breath return to normal. “Explain yourself,” came Malfoy’s voice from the doorway. He looked really fucking pissed off. He was also only wearing his pants.
“No, I know,” Draco said. “He’s expressed his objection to it. And while I admit that I do, perhaps, deserve to stay here and reap the consequences of my past behavior, I’m needed there. William needs my help.”
“Okay, first of all, there will be no slamming of cock your first time. And second of all...are you ready to go now?”
The hours ticked by. One o’clock, two o’clock, three. Instead of winding down, Harry felt like he was being wound up, coiling. His skin felt too tight. He felt jittery. His heart was beating too fast.
Yes, he did think that. “I assume you voted yes because you thought it was the right thing to do.” That was probably true, too, though.
And that was weird. He shouldn’t want to know about Malfoy, for fuck’s sake. Especially given that Malfoy was probably going to blackmail him in the near future.
It wasn’t true, incidentally. He and Pansy still spent plenty of time together. But he supposed that when you compared it to the amount of time they spent together pre-Harry, it was less. Then again, they used to spend almost every non-working hour together, so there was nowhere to go but down.
Potter licked his lips nervously. “Yeah. Yes. I liked that. And I liked that you didn’t yell at me. And I liked that you, um. Let me kiss you. And touch you. And – well. You know.”
Draco didn’t want to admit how difficult it was for him to be in possession of that information, to know that at one point, Blaise, who'd been one of his best friends, had had his hand on Harry’s cock. “Right,” he said. “Well, that's good to know, then.”
The music was of the loud muggle variety, which Draco didn’t mind, really. They spotted Luna after a moment. She was dressed as a mooncalf, which wasn’t surprising. Draco happened to know they were her favorite magical creature. They were cute, he had to admit, with their enormous, round eyes.
They looked at each other for a moment, lost, and then Draco began to move, slowly, circling his hips in that hypnotic way that Harry remembered, his hands on Harry’s chest, then moving up to dig into his shoulders.
Harry leaned back against the sofa and shut his eyes tightly, wanting all this to go away. Cassius was gorgeous in school, and Harry would’ve probably messed around with him too, if he’d asked. Cassius was also, apparently, a despicable bastard. He was a seventh year when they were fourth years. That was pretty fucked up, too, along with everything else.
But he only smirked over at Pans, and let her smack him on the knee, and then let her grill Potter when he came back into the room.
Harry tried not to feel anything at the growl or the words, but he couldn’t help it, at least not for a split-second. But he quickly batted it away.
Inside, everything was neon and black, and smelled like sweat and musk and men. Draco inhaled deeply, extravagantly. It’d been too long since he’d been let out in the wild like this. Fuck Ernie. Fuck Ernie and his subpar blowjobs and his hang-ups about rimming.
“You’ll have to live there, won’t you? I’m sure James will just love having his dad breathing down his neck.”
Draco returned to Potter’s tight hole, licking slow circles around the rim, and then pressing his tongue in and in and in. Potter tasted so clean and so good. “You’re beautiful,” he whispered against Potter’s skin. “You taste amazing.”
“I’ll have you know that I do believe in fate, especially when it comes to you two bints and your adorable love story. In fact, maybe that was the whole purpose of Harry and me: to bring you two together.”
Not better than lust-filled Potter, though, who Draco was almost certain had made an appearance back in the bedroom. He shivered, just thinking about the way Potter had looked at him, like he wanted to devour him piece by piece.
Pansy made a garbled sound that was some mixture of a scream and a growl. “I’ll kill him,” she said in a low, threatening voice.
“Oh, thank fuck,” Draco said. “I thought you’d never ask.” His eyes were shining almost silver in the colorful lights of the club, obscenely beautiful against the smudgy black of eyeliner.
,” he cried, his hips jerking back. He wanted to be filled up, he wanted Potter in him, all over him. Every place Potter touched felt like it was burning. His sensitive cock brushed up against the door and he cried out and slammed his arse back onto Potter’s fingers.
But then Charlie was pulling away gently and tucking a wayward strand of hair behind his ear. He reached out and took Draco’s hand again. “You want to get together again before I leave? I’d like to, if you’re game.”
for Ron. He didn’t lust after him, or find himself thinking about him throughout the day. Last night had felt good, and Harry’d enjoyed it, but it hadn’t been earth-shattering. It had been warm and pleasant and a little emotional, simply because he cared about Ron so much, but it hadn’t felt like sex had at first with Ginny. It hadn’t felt like his soul was being knotted together with Ron’s, hadn’t felt like they were falling in love or anything.
“No man is brave that has never walked a hundred miles. If you want to know the truth of who you are, walk until not a person knows your name.”
Before he could think it over properly, he was disapparating, and he appeared at the gates of Malfoy Manor. He wasn’t quite sure how to alert them to his presence, but he needn’t have worried. He’d only been there a minute or two before the gates began to creak open.
“Yes,” said Draco, nodding. “I had a godfather, too. It’s a very special thing, having one. You’re lucky.”
The day before they left, Draco was mentioned in conversation. Harry suspected Ron and Pansy had been careful not to bring him up, which was silly, given that they saw him often. Apparently, he’d ended things with his nice muggle boyfriend and was single again. Harry tried not to think about that. “You know,” Pansy said to Harry, her tone casual. “You were supposed to have coffee together when you came back.”
“I don’t know what the hell to think about all this. I truly don’t. I find the whole situation generally repulsive, yes. I don’t know that means I’m repulsed by you, specifically, but…I don’t know. I just don’t know. I am finding it hard to understand how you could’ve ever done that.”
He blinked his eyes open and Ernie was there, sitting on the bed beside him. “Hi,” Draco said, his voice froggy. He smiled up at Ernie, forgetting, for a moment, that they weren’t together anymore, that Ernie had broken up with him. Forgetting about The Plan and about Potter.
“Where we come from, magic isn’t limited to one race,” Potter said, bringing himself into the conversation.
At two-thirty, when Potter had been sleeping for over four hours, Draco woke him, pulling his toes a little and hissing, “Potter!”
, for Salazar’s sake, and she lied to me. Blaise is worried about her. About her safety. I don’t understand why. He said it’s been happening since the beginning of their marriage. But I wasn’t here, you see? I wasn’t here to see who Daphne was with before Blaise. And she never said anything when we were writing each other while I was at Hogwarts. I’m thinking the worst, you know? Like, what if it’s somebody in illegal potions trading or something? What if she really is in danger?”
Malfoy smiled and nodded. “Before Hogwarts, I was taught here, at home. I had a couple of tutors, but she worked with me in quite a few subjects as well: art, music, dance, French, Latin, history. Those sorts of things.”
Up ahead, Potter had stopped, and was looking up at a tree. “Potter, we have to get back right now, goddamnit! Come on! It’s probably been five or six minutes.”
The next morning, Harry floo-called Hermione and Luna to check and make sure they got home okay. Luna had crashed at Hermione’s, and they were making breakfast, so Harry went through and joined them. They laughed about the night, relaying bits and pieces to one another, talking their way through the adventures they only half remembered thanks to the alcohol. Luna had been the most sober, probably, and Hermione had been the least. Hermione, Harry learned, had kissed a guy on the dancefloor, and even though it wasn’t fair, the news lanced through Harry like shrapnel and it was very difficult to breathe for a moment.
“Dungeon,” he whispered back at the group, unable to keep the smile off his face. Draco felt something rising up in his chest, something big and bright.
“Well,” Harry said, trying to parse through all the obscenity. “Then that’s good. Because as it turns out, he thought you would judge him, which is why he’s kept his distance.”
in a way he hadn’t seemed since sixth year when he was fixing up the Vanishing Cabinet. He seemed furtive and secretive and agitated. He seemed vaguely pissed off. And Harry wanted to know what the fuck was going on.
, thank you very much for the advice,” he said, striding over to the ancient-looking machines. “Since you’re such an expert, why don’t you tell me what in the world these are.”
they did, and now they have eleventy-thousand ginger babies running about. Ron stays home with them since Hermione is Head of Surgery at St. Mungo’s. Did you honestly expect anything else?”
More drinking and more snogging, and the night started to get a little hazy. He was pretty certain Hannah had let him touch her boobs at some point, and also, he was almost positive that Seamus had given Dean a hand job on the couch. Other things probably happened, too, although he couldn’t remember them as well.
Harry shook off the aftershocks of the bollocks trauma and spun towards Malfoy, giving him a hard kick somewhere in the vicinity of his ribs. Malfoy grabbed at his foot but Harry kicked him off. “You were the one trying to fucking
The first time he had sex it was in a stall in the loo of a club in Shoreditch, with a black-haired muggle with dark blue eyes. It felt good, and it was frantic and heady, and Draco had leaned his head back against the man’s shoulder as he came into the man’s hand.
Draco was looking up at Charlie with some mixture of gratitude and something else, something warmer, brighter, and Charlie was looking down at him and stroking his hair.
“Good luck with that,” Draco said, smiling. Ari was very vocal about Harry’s aversion to serious conversations.
“Harry,” Pansy said as he turned away, grabbing his arm, but Harry pulled out of her grasp and walked back through the crowd. He slipped out of the door and onto the dark street behind the club, where he ducked into the shadows and disapparated.
Draco buried his head in his hands. “Fine,” he said, his voice muffled. “Fine. Keep him out of my face.”
Draco joined him in studying the ceiling. “I could –” he couldn’t say this, could he? Not now, at this pivotal moment between them. But the words slipped out before he could stop them. “I could show you.”
Draco began to rut against him properly, desperate for him, their kisses turning deeper and more frantic but no less sweet. Harry’s hands were on his cheeks and in his hair and then sliding down his back as he moved underneath Draco, finding a rhythm to match Draco’s.
, but this was plenty, because he could definitely see Harry’s finger disappearing into his arse. And then he definitely heard the deep, low, almost growl that sounded from his pink lips.
And sure enough, through one slitted eye, he saw Potter watching, his eyes moving up and down Draco’s partially-blanketed form. Draco decided to test the waters a little, and reached up with his free hand and ran it over his chest, sighing at the touch, and then pinched his nipple and let out a little moan. Next to him, he heard Potter make a little strangled noise, and covered it up by pretending to roll around and kick at the covers.
sort of feelings for one another, although I’ll be damned if I understand them. But you can see, can’t you, why it might bother him?”
“I have many talents that you don’t know about,” Draco said, and was surprised when he was rewarded with Potter’s slight flush. He turned then, knowing he was testing limits, but also not caring, and began to flick open the buttons of his shirt. He was doing it to see what would happen, yes, but also because there was no way in hell he was going to sleep in a button-up shirt and wool trousers. No thanks.
Draco smacked Harry’s shoulder and Harry frowned up at him. “Shush for a moment. I think she’s right. That thing does keep popping up everywhere. It’s uncanny. I think it might be worth a try.”
“Let me see,” said Malfoy, coming to stand behind him. Harry tensed, but a moment later, a cool feeling was spreading over the sore spot, bright and tingling, almost like peppermint. “There.”
He thought of Draco, of that first kiss in York, of the way they were both innocent and open-hearted then, despite the war, despite everything. He thought of Draco dancing under the bright lights of The Fat Friar, of Draco laughing with blue paint on his face. He thought of the way it felt to hold him again after all those years on the rooftop in Chicago, and how he looked in the moonlight out on his balcony at Christmas. He thought of him in the frozen woods in Maine, staring in wonder at the bobcat; he thought of him quiet and soft in the morning, his head on Harry’s chest, his hair tickling Harry’s cheek.
She reached around and pressed two fingers into her while she continued to move her tongue, and soon Sarah did the same, and increased the intensity of it, pressing her face into Pansy’s cunt as she continued to lick her.  Pansy sucked Sarah’s clit into her mouth just the way she liked it, she sucked at it and then licked it with a stiff tongue again and Sarah made the most agonizing sound, and fuck, she loved this, she loved Sarah, she loved what they had and it was so good and sweet and happy, and Sarah was so fucking wet, Pansy’s fingers were sliding in so easily, and soon she had three inside and Sarah was moving against them and moaning sweetly.
Potter didn’t respond, only clenched his jaw tighter. With all the grinding of teeth that Potter was doing tonight, he was liable to get down to the gumline soon.
Potter quirked a small smile. “Right, no big deal. Nobody will have us locked up as lunatics for talking like that.”
By the end of the night, the three of them were sprawled out on Hermione’s extraordinarily comfortable beige sectional, drinking shitty wine, and Ginny was detailing a particularly erotic encounter that she and Longbottom had in her parents’ toilet while Molly and Arthur were on the other side of the door, having a conversation about garden gnomes.
Harry left for Maine the day after Christmas. Ari was visiting family, and Harry didn’t want to go with anyone anyway. He wanted time to think.
He was thinking, he realized, about Unspeakable Clarke and the Time Room. Nobody knew much about the project that had tried to murder Clarke again and again, except that it was time related. Draco knew a bit about what went on in the Time Room because Hermione had worked on several projects there. Apparently, she had been interested in time ever since she’d used a Time-Turner back in school (a fact which made Draco incredibly jealous, because why had no one let
“Maybe tomorrow, I dunno. I don’t have the energy today. I’m shattered. Speaking of, can I sleep at yours? I’d rather not be at home by myself.”
Harry complied, helping him scoot them down and then kicking them off. Draco’s pants were still somewhere in the vicinity of his knees, so he kicked them off too, and then they both seemed to realize all at once that everything was gone, and there was nothing left between them, nothing at all. Draco returned his mouth to Harry’s and traced the lines of his body, wanting to know them, to learn them. He let his hands linger along the muscles of Harry’s back, the delicious dip above his arse, and then the sweet curve below. He felt the smooth muscles of his thighs and the jut of his hips. Then he moved his hands back up to Harry’s face, letting his fingertips linger over jaw and throat, the soft curve of an ear, the line of his brow.
Draco needed to get his shit together. He had a job to do, and that meant he couldn’t waste his time moping over a romance that had been dead for almost a decade. He was Draco Malfoy, the future Minister of Magic, if things went according to plan. He was going to be the one to keep Theo and the other New Magic Party bastards from taking over the government. He was going to be a man his son could look up to, a man worthy of his wife’s affections.
“This may or may not have been the right thing to do,” says the dark-haired man. “Harry had his doubts.”
“You’re not stewing over anything, though?” Draco asked. He ran his hands up and down Harry’s arms, and it felt reassuring, steadying.
It was cold as a witch’s tit outside, and despite casting a million warming charms over himself, Harry was shivering like mad, and his eyes were watering because of the frigid wind. His tears had made little frozen trails along his face.
They were frotting together, everything slick and warm and sliding easily. The weight of Harry’s hardness on his own was thrilling, and Draco could feel every pulse and twitch against his prick.
“You adore me, and you’d find out sooner or later, so you might as well find out now from me. Less traumatic this way.”
for fuck’s sake. His idea of a good time was getting high and gaming until three in the morning. Potter might as well have been dating
“You’ll go to the nurse,” McGonagall said in a tone that left no room for argument. “And you, Mr. Potter. Do you need to see Madam Pomfrey as well?”
“Unfortunately not,” Lia said, her hands grasped tightly in her lap. Her eyes flickered over to Draco, her expression clearly saying what she did not:
“I suppose,” said Draco. “But if they don’t work with you, things are less likely to change for the better for them.”
“Oh, Merlin. It’s easy. Just slow-quick-quick.” Draco tried to move him and Harry remained rooted to the spot, laughing. “Do it, Potter, or I’ll have to
He was so busy stomping that he almost missed the flash of white from behind one of the enormous trees. He stilled and looked.
“What about that vampire and that boring girl from the muggle movie we watched on Monday night?” Pansy asked.
She was just a girl, a pretty girl, who was probably flirting, he told himself. If anyone should be afraid, it was her, of him.
Harry threw an impish grin over his shoulder, and Draco supposed that was as much of an answer as he was going to get.
“I was,” Harry said. “Or, well. He came over for a bit.” Harry’s mouth tasted like something had crawled into it and died. “Hey, do you mind if I grab a quick shower? Maybe brush my teeth?”
Draco sighed. Was this what being friends with Potter was always going to be like? Constant reevaluation of the world, of himself? Constant efforts to better it all? Did Potter not ever just
Draco was fairly well fucked up. Not so drunk he couldn’t walk or see, but everything had taken on a slightly surreal tint. Pansy finished her snog and resumed dancing with them, and soon she and Hermione were getting a bit naughty with each other, in a way that Draco felt was probably for the benefit of all the men that were looking on with their mouths hanging open.
Given the vast number of openly gay students in their year (Potter coming out this morning brought the number to exactly one), it only made sense that Potter would gravitate towards Draco. And Draco didn’t like the idea that Potter was doing this because Draco was his only option. He could tell that Potter
