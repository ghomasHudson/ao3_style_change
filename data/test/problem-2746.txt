“I transfigure it into a bed in the evening,” Draco felt urged to defend himself. What had Harry expected? That he’d have the whole flat nice and ready straight away, all sorts of friends helping out?
“No, Potter, there isn’t.” The truth of the matter was that his attacker had been sneaking up behind him. Usually Draco tried to be really careful, keeping close to buildings, preferably with windows, and always watchful, but yesterday he’d been in an, admittedly rather deserted, Muggle area and he hadn’t been as attentive as he’d normally be.
Harry very much felt like he’d taken the wrong turn again, but this time at least he knew where he’d gone wrong.
Harry heard the vial hit Draco’s hand, then him drinking it – he always drank first when he procured it, the egocentric bastard – and only then did Harry open his own eyes and sit up a bit, enough to be able to drink too. Draco wordlessly handed him the vial.
Harry nodded, he usually didn’t like using his fame much, but here, at this moment it came in handy. “Yes, and I’m certainly not here to help the Cartel.”
This had come as no surprise, since within the last week there had been three burglaries into wizarding apothecaries all over the country. Every time the culprits had only taken the most expensive and rare potions. As a result the Auror Department had upped security around all Apothecaries, of course including the one in London.
So he didn’t.
Lunch was spent mostly in silence again, but it was well beyond just ‘not uncomfortable’: it was almost companiable, nice. And after they’d eaten, when they started walking to Malfoy’s classroom in Training, they were actually talking animatedly about the book on defence techniques Harry’d found in his library and the solutions to rather uncommon curses Malfoy had apparently read up on throughout the weekend.
Because he was in bed with a man, his body all long, lean lines. And Harry smiled, recollecting everything they’d done in this very room just hours before, things he certainly couldn’t have done with a woman.
Then he laughed, briefly but real, just before he hurried out of the room.
So instead Harry just put the stopper back on the phial of Dittany and packed it in his pocket again.
The kitchen Draco had eventually ordered was dark grey with beautiful brushed oak details and all the appliances he could possibly need. Besides they had found the perfect dinner table: brushed oak again with rather elegant chairs to match. They’d arranged to have the furniture arrive later that week and the kitchen would be installed in about a month.
Furthermore Harry liked Zabini. He hadn’t actually seen him for the past few months, but they’d had to work together on more than one occasion over the years, because Zabini worked in a Covert Ops part of the Auror Department that had been established after the war, at first mostly to seek out dark wizards and later to find any criminals that had proven to be especially difficult to find. Harry’s team had had to rely on Zabini’s team for intel a few times and although they hadn’t quite reached first name basis just yet, they had found they worked well together. Harry was genuinely glad to see Zabini here.
“And to go after Draco,” Harry added drily.
The boy looked at them in utter surprise. “But-, but you’re
Harry watched Malfoy for a long moment, surprised by what his words actually meant, their implication. Had he really changed that much? “Yeah, I suppose it is,” Harry then brought himself to say.
Finally it was Draco who pulled Harry in over the small distance that had still been separating them, making their lips meet in a kiss that was long, greedy and utterly delicious.
It didn’t even take him ten minutes. Then they cautiously went through the door.
“’It’s okay. ’M fine,” Draco said, obviously struggling to stay upright, all blood drained from his face now. And Harry knew better that to object, so he just steadied him, putting his arm around Draco’s waist, holding him close. Draco leant into his touch: he was captivating, and warm, and there.
The two of them had mostly been to different places in Belgium and Holland and all these events seemed to be just as terrible, the only difference being that Malfoy apparently didn’t speak any Dutch, which meant they actually conversed in English in the Dutch speaking areas, meaning Harry could understand every boring detail he heard. Which was definitely not always an advantage.
might not like it. Draco’s smile was much too wide, when he realised. “No, that’s fine,” Draco answered next, having toned down his initial enthusiasm enough to sound almost bored. “Let’s make it Wednesday, however. That would suit me better.”
Terry seemed almost disappointed, as if he had hoped Harry would have regretted his decision by now. Well - Harry thought rather defiantly - even if he had regretted it, Terry would most likely have been the last person to know.
It took Harry a brief moment to catch up: Malfoy thought he’d come here to get the Constellation Box back. “I already told you, I don’t want it back. It’s yours.” Harry heard the slight annoyance to his voice. Why couldn’t the twat just accept something without immediately making a big deal out of it.
Besides Harry had found that he worked even better with Zabini than he had anticipated. He had, of course, worked with him before, but it was even easier now, possibly because now they worked more closely together than they ever had.
“That bacon is absolutely delicious.” They’d been eating in silence for a while, but now Malfoy had just made this comment. Out of the blue. And Harry agreed, his bacon had turned out to be quite nice, but this still took him completely by surprise. Malfoy had actually paid him a compliment, a real, full-blown one. Not even a ‘sort of’ one.
Draco wouldn’t have left, even if they had.
“Malfoy, what the hell are
“You’re off now?” She asked next.
Somehow he had lost his locket.
When they did, Harry was looking at a rather beefy man in his forties, who watched him warily and expectantly all at once. They shook hands. “Mr Riggs. Glad you could make it. I’m John Jones.” Yeah, of course he was. Harry wasn’t entirely sure with how many pinches of salt he should take that name. It sounded rather made-up.
Then a thought struck Harry: “But why didn’t they kill Draco straight away? You know when Goodall ran into him on Knockturn. Instead of obliviating him he could have killed him just as well, he obviously didn’t have any qualms about killing.” It was true, of course, and Harry felt an icy cold shiver pass through his body at the thought.
Harry watched him again, sending him a gentle smile. “It seems even more valuable to you,” Harry’s intuition said, apparently borrowing Harry’s voice for the moment. “I really think you should have it.” He smiled again, trying to lighten the mood just a bit. “It’s not like I need the money anyway.” Adding, still watching Malfoy, hoping to make clear he’d really meant it. “Please. Just take it.”
Draco’d been working at St Mungo’s for a week now, and he felt like he had been on call more than he’d been off. Well, at least today was a Friday and he was actually off for the whole weekend, so he would be able to sleep longer (anything around six or seven hours a night would be nice for a change) and perhaps even start making his flat look a bit more like a real home.
Blaise sighed. “Let’s just say no one wants to be associated with damaged goods. And the Malfoy’s were-. Well-.”
“I’d like to,” he simply said and he heard the gratitude colouring his tone, realising he truly didn’t want to go home for the night anymore.
“I’m going outside for a bit.”
“Yeah, didn’t know it was forbidden.” Harry tried for what he hoped was a light, playful tone. “Do we actually have a no-sleeping-in-shared-space rule?”
Draco did feel the eyes on him, though. Ministry employees staring at him in what would undoubtedly be varying degrees of repulsion.
an Auror. So Harry felt the need to explain: “I don’t remember who he said it was with and I thought it would be his mother, but-.”
Malfoy smiled: it was small and hesitant. “I’d already got that impression.” Then he breathed in like he wanted to say something else, but he just clenched his jaw and didn’t.
Draco hadn’t read Harry’s note and he hadn’t been at the club.
That’s when Harry heard Draco groan, his face scrunching in a way that looked both  uncomfortable and entirely adorable. Okay, so the getting-used-to bit was apparently not going to take too much time if ‘adorable’ came to mind this easily. When thinking of Draco Malfoy of all people.
Blaise looked him over once more as if to say ‘Then why the secrecy?’, because Blaise had definitely understood that Draco hadn’t told him everything: Draco had left out the whole weepy breakdown he’d had on Potter’s shoulder. Of course he had. He didn’t even want to
Then Draco leant in a bit, one arm around Potter’s waist now and the other one sliding up his back, slowly, ending up on his shoulder blade. Potter looked up, his eyes searching, while Draco looked right back, firmly remembering not to chicken out.
Blaise was still there, talking to someone Harry didn’t know.
Catherine turned towards them with a gentle smile, almost immediately waving her wand at Draco, taking his weight off Harry slightly. “I’ve cast a light Levitation spell,” she explained.
Harry just nodded, then stepped towards Draco again. “Yes, but it-, I needed to push something off first.”
Harry only left him after he had undone all of the buttons that Malfoy’s shirt and waistcoat apparently had - figuring they would be much too difficult for him to undo in his current state – leaving him to finish undressing himself. There obviously were lines Harry didn’t want to cross.
And that was when he spotted it: a hooded person at the back of the room getting up just after he did, watching him for just a beat too long.
Potter answered he understood, saying he always had a rather late lunch at the Burrow on Sundays and that he wasn’t even sure whether he’d make that on time tomorrow. And then he smiled, Potter actually smiled and it seemed kind of genuine. Potter really had to be quite drunk.
Draco didn’t mention that Harry shouldn’t, somehow afraid Harry might turn back immediately if he did.
Then he left.
When Harry woke up, he already felt the warmth of another body curled into his before he’d opened his eyes and there was a short moment when he thought it must be Ginny’s, just before he remembered it couldn’t be, that it wasn’t even close.
For some reason it took Harry quite some control to keep standing where he was. What did Malfoy think? That he could just gossip about him all he wanted?
smile at him again, apparently knowing full well what Harry hadn’t actually asked: “Well, no, at least not anymore. Haven’t been for a long time actually.” For some reason that settled something inside of Harry, although he knew he really had no right to feel that way after just one night of drunken kisses. Certainly not since neither of them had in fact mentioned those kisses again. Still Harry felt his face relax, letting go of a tension, he hadn’t even noticed had been there. “Claude was very patient with Draco, though, giving him time to learn everything he needed to know,” Zabini added.
Draco gave Harry a strange look. “It didn’t scar, you know. Snape got there in time for it not to leave a mark.” Draco’s voice was quiet and Harry just now realised what he was actually talking about, why he thought Harry had been staring at him.
No Tourists by The Prodigy
Harry, quite annoyingly, didn’t say anything, but he did step aside, letting Draco pass. “You smell nice,” Draco couldn’t help the words falling out of his mouth, leaning in just a bit more to catch Harry’s scent.
to spend the weekend apart?” Harry sounded confused more than anything.
Potter was.
Draco got up.
Potter was still holding him close, however, the heat never leaving his gaze. “I don't really know how-. Do you want to-? My place?” Potter was breathing fast.
Then he heard Draco inhale a shuddering breath and his eyes fluttered open.
“Are you sure that’s all you are?” Draco heard the ice to his voice, knowing nothing good would come from it, but not being able to stop it either.
“As I said, we weren’t discussing
Perhaps Slytherins were taught that in secret classes too, just like French, Harry mused slightly resentfully.
Harry decided it must be the first – or at least he hoped it was - so he sat himself down in the hallway, his back to Draco’s door. There still seemed to be no movement, no sound in the flat. Perhaps Blaise was wrong and Draco wasn’t even home.
When Draco woke up in Harry’s bed some time later, Harry’s legs entangled with his own again, he didn’t really know what to do. A part of him just wanted to bolt, like he always did, but the other part was more comfortable than he’d been in a very long time, not wanting to leave.
to stay away. It was like he was being steered anywhere else.
In the meantime Harry had gotten the kettle boiling without even looking at it and Draco used it to make them tea.
going to hurt them.
Zabini was still exactly where Harry had left him. He was on his back, but even at this distance Harry noticed something was off and he recognised Zabini’s Glamour had probably failed, him being too weak to keep it up.
Draco decidedly had to remind himself that that was not a milestone.
Hermione had been friends with Blaise for a good few years now. They’d started as Unspeakables at roughly the same time and had gotten along surprisingly well almost straight away. From then on a tentative friendship had formed and at some point Blaise had just been added to the irregular mix of Harry’s friends that showed up on their Friday evening get-togethers at the Leaky Cauldron.
“Don’t leave,” Harry clarified anyway. “You can get a change of clothes from your place before work, if you want to. I’ll set the alarm early.” And then he proceeded to do just that, setting the alarm, then pulling Draco towards him as if that settled it.
Furthermore, it wasn’t like they did anything beyond just having a good time on Saturday evening. Nothing to be afraid of there. He’d done it multiple times.
“She was fine.” Harry was looking at Draco again and there was warmth and humour and a whole lot of other things Draco didn’t really have a name for. “We talked about you, actually.”
“How the hell do you even know where I live?” Draco knew it wasn’t the most polite, or adequate for that matter, response to someone standing on your doorstep to return your locket, the one you quite inconveniently lost at their place.
Because it still didn’t.
“Harry, he isn’t worth it.” Draco had finally been able to get up, finding his voice in the process and he had put a steadying hand on Harry’s arm. It sent a tingling sensation through his whole body: touching Harry just always felt so right.
Harry didn’t get a chance to think about it for a very long time, though, because it was only slightly later that the owl arrived.
“Oh yes, but I think there were probably more of them. Clothes do tend to hide these kinds of things, you know.”
“So, did Blaise have anything interesting to say?” Real, very-much-alive Malfoy now asked. His voice had this gravelly quality to it again that Harry had actually come to like and Harry now recognised what Malfoy was trying to do: getting Harry to think of something that wasn’t his dream, to distract him from it.
It really was quite enticing.
“Well, you did save us another trip here.” Harry smiled, trying to ease the tension around them a bit, because, although Harry really didn’t want to, he did understand what Malfoy was trying to say. And the worrying thing was: Malfoy might even be right. Just a little.
“Draco, are you okay?” Harry sounded concerned, which was both reassuring and alarming somehow.
Going home would just have to wait a while longer.
Harry had already started to form an answer in his head, wanting to say something witty, perhaps even slightly offensive, when he saw Malfoy’s eyes. They held something he hadn’t seen directed at him ever, not even throughout all the time they’d spent at the same school.
“Yes, but it’s nothing that can’t be healed.” He heard the Healer answer. “I haven’t had any experience with this particular curse before, but I’ve seen others like it being used on … .” She seemed to hesitate and Draco would have liked to know why. Most people said it to him out loud:
“So you actually know how to use that thing?” Harry couldn’t help the question.
When he woke up, it was dark outside, which, it being summer, meant it had to be quite late. Or really early of course.
For some reason Zabini’s last sentence sounded determined and slightly tired at the same time.
“Are you erm-, leaving?” It came out slightly hoarse and Draco hated how fucking vulnerable it made him sound.
It happened to be easy to catch Draco.
Harry just gave him a slightly strange look, before saying: “I’d like you to stay.” Okay, so Harry definitely didn’t want to be alone.
man all through it.
“Yes, just in case it happened again. Look,” now Draco
“Yes, so why don’t you? I don’t think he would mind.” Luna had disregarded the sneering part to Draco’s answer completely.
They were going to spend the weekend together.
Denial was something he could actually deal with.
For a moment Harry thought they were going to have the I-didn’t-think-you’d-let-me conversation they’d been having before, but then Malfoy spoke up again, the sting almost entirely gone from his words: “The only way I could visit my mother would be if you’d come with me and I thought you wouldn’t quite appreciate having to accompany me there.”
“Are you actually all right? Perhaps you’re not accustomed to the concept of praise?” Malfoy now added. It came out the drawl Harry was used to, but it also sounded amused, as if Malfoy couldn’t quite help himself.
And Harry rather muzzily realised they would most likely end up having to dress at top speed, hoping to make it to The Burrow in time, but he couldn’t bring himself to care: it was definitely worth it.
Draco met what must have been Harry’s rather heated gaze, evenly, but he had flushed ever so slightly. “I heard the Aurors coming, you pillock. You didn’t really think I was going to endanger myself again because of you, now did you?”
If he’d dropped an actual bomb, Malfoy’s face would probably have done something similar to what it was doing now: utter surprise flashing over it, intermingled with something very much resembling hurt.
them. I’ve seen you. You can’t be-.”
Hermione pointedly didn’t look at Harry. Instead she just sidled into his room and put a small phial on his bedside table.
It was when Draco thought of something, panic starting to rise. “Do you know whether my mother has been informed? You know, of my, well, situation?”
“Yes, of course,” Draco forced himself to answer flatly, even though he seemed unable to look away from Harry. And Harry from him, which made Draco bold somehow. So he stepped closer, leaning in enough to speak into Harry’s ear. “I’ll miss you though.” Draco knew his voice sounded every bit as sensuous and sultry as he’d wanted it to.
Ron nodded. “When Goodall worked in Azkaban - just before he resigned from the Auror force - Boot was stationed there, too, for a while. He said he trusted Goodall. We’ve interrogated them both on Veritaserum though and Boot mostly seemed to have trusted him to pay a rather large sum of money.”
Draco’s eyes had followed Harry’s gaze to the corner and he sounded every bit as condescending as ever, when he said: “Let me assure you, I’m not drunk. I haven’t had anything since last night, really.” He huffed, adding more quietly: “And even if I had, I doubt it would have changed the answer.”
In the end Harry had not been able to drag himself to their suite, to bed, instead trying to get some sleep on the chair in Draco’s room and not being particularly successful at it.
And the day after tomorrow it would be two years to the day. He had actually kept count.
When Harry woke, parched and with a pounding headache, he registered the heat of another body close to his immediately. He opened his eyes slowly, the grey morning light filtering through the curtains just enough to see Draco’s face. Draco’s eyes were still closed, long blond lashes to pale skin and Harry couldn’t help but notice how beautiful he looked in this state of complete relaxation.
And it was precisely how Draco liked it.
Draco and Harry both recognised it before it had fully materialised.
“Yes, but I er-, I don’t want to take it just yet. I still have some stuff at your suite and I-. Is it okay if I come back with you for now?” Harry just answered.
Harry let himself be hauled back to their booth.
That broke their kiss and Harry watched Draco, the alarm on his face making him realise how serious this was and Harry slowly, reluctantly let go. Then, feeling a strong need to protect, he stepped in front of Draco, his wand at the ready, just like Draco’s.
“I’m sorry,” Draco mumbled, turning away, trying to manage a semblance of dignity that actually proved very difficult to maintain.
And they both knew they weren’t just talking about Saturday nights anymore.
“I’m quite sure they’ve just retracted, like wings would,” Draco replied, turning to face Harry. Harry looked as sleepy as he had sounded and it made Draco want to reach out, run his hand through Harry’s hair. So he did. Because he could, because it’d be allowed now.
Harry answered her. “They tried to kill him. If he hadn’t been able to send that Patronus, I certainly wouldn’t have found him in time. It’s-“ Harry swallowed thickly, “It’s what they’d been counting on.”
Harry would resent this. There really was no other possible outcome.
Potter seemed to notice Draco’s shaky resolve to leave, however, and for some reason he didn’t agree. “I won’t be very long.” His voice had an edge of worry to it and Draco knew what that meant. Potter was sorry for him. Of course he was: pity and charity. It was exactly what Draco didn’t want, what he didn’t need.
Or even more so, perhaps.
But of course that would be when Harry chose to reappear, at his door, just after he’d got back there.
“Harry, want another drink?” Ron was standing next to him now. They hadn’t been talking very much throughout the evening. While Hermione had been working the room, Ron had noticeably been working the rather posh snacks that were served constantly, just talking to Harry when he was able to in the process and when Harry wasn’t being claimed by some other wizard or another.
“At 12 Grimmauld Place. In the library. I’m still clearing rooms out, doing them up. That’s when I found this.”
“You didn’t get a
which Draco hoped would end whatever Harry had been hit with.
And at some point - he couldn’t even tell exactly when - Harry just drifted off to sleep again, his fingers still interlaced with Malfoy’s.
Harry just gazed at Draco again and for a moment Draco was sure Harry would tell him to forget about it and leave.
So, okay, fine, Ron and Hermione had been kind of right about Malfoy: he seemed to be very good at his job, teaching and otherwise, all evidence pointing in that direction: Harry’d heard students, but also other teachers say it, and, of course, he’d seen Malfoy in class himself. There was absolutely no reason not to take this cube thing to him, instead of letting literally any other Curse-Breaker have a look.
“Does it now? I don’t seem to recall any such rule, really,” Draco said, seemingly pondering. “But I do know that I don’t give presents on an empty stomach.”
Well, at least Potter hadn’t been alone this whole evening. Draco had seen how he’d been constantly talking to people, mostly to Weasley and Granger and occasionally Ginny. And to anyone else who happened to come his way, of course.
Being with Malfoy had felt familiar in a way that Harry had never anticipated and Harry realised he’d rather enjoy seeing Malfoy like that again.
Zabini had been working undercover in the Dragon Cartel for almost six months, making his way up in the organisation slowly but surely and even though he still hadn’t seen their main facilities yet, he had actually gained enough trust to recently have been given the task of buying ingredients, especially the ones that were more difficult to procure.
“I-,” Harry checked himself: he shouldn’t blurt out anything stupid, possibly embarrassing even, when Draco was about to go out. They couldn’t talk right now. Not really: there was no time. “Just be careful, okay?” was all he settled for instead.
“You’re not leaving, are you? It’s the middle of the night, for fuck’s sake.”
That was when Mathew decided to step in, however, blocking Draco’s spell with a shield that was obviously meant to keep Draco’s Patronus from working. And the shield did its job, extinguishing Draco’s Patronus as if it had never even been there in the first place.
“Good morning.” It was definitely Malfoy’s voice and Harry turned from the stove where he’d been frying his yet unrivalled bacon.
While coming in Wood was smiling broadly, receiving everybody’s congratulations on his new job, after which he promptly sat down next to Harry, who immediately sent Draco a rather apologetic smile.
“You did?” Harry’s voice was slightly incredulous, decidedly managing nothing like her airiness.
Harry nodded, not sure how this was going to be of any use.
“I’m really glad you were still at work when Ron was brought in,” Harry now said quietly.
It almost felt like a caress.
Abbott brought them the menus and Draco was grateful for her timing, because his damn back had just started to burn again. This time a muffled groan actually made it out of Draco’s mouth, but the room around them was decidedly loud so Harry, his attention on Abbott, didn’t notice.
Harry watched him for a short while before answering, his eyes inquisitive and still just as green as Draco remembered them. “No, it’s not that anymore. But I just thought-, well, we’d started on your flat and I thought it would be nice to help you finish it. You know, so you can settle in here again, feel at home.” He kept staring at Draco, like he wanted to find answers to a question he hadn’t asked.
Besides - and this was a very important ‘besides’ - neither of them had mentioned last Saturday night at all. It was a strategy Draco felt utterly grateful for.
Malfoy didn’t say anything straight away, though, only looking a bit confused for a moment and then he smiled, just slightly, as if he’d just been able to reign it in before it would have become a real smile. “Yes, so it seems,“ he answered, flatly, still with that half-smile on his lips. “I was invited to a gala ball that would have been very unwise for me not to attend,” he then elaborated as if that explained everything.
Harry Potter - in one way or another and that just wasn’t what he was looking for. He wanted something better than that, something that was real.
Harry didn’t really know what it was, but he did know he was serious about what he had said. He really wasn’t going anywhere.
So Harry shook his head at Malfoy’s question decidedly feeling that something important had just slipped through his fingers, gone like the sand in an hour glass.
People around him seemed in turmoil, talking to him, but he had trouble hearing them. It seemed like he wasn’t really there, like he was dreaming, stuck in his head, not really able to register anything around him.
He decided it was a good time to get off the dancefloor altogether, eyeing the crowd, trying to locate the rest of his friends as he did so. They had left for the dancefloor, leaving him the caretaker of their boot, at least a quarter of an hour ago.
“It’s just …, well, I hadn’t expected
within the second.
Harry had been patiently waiting, while Draco had been working, but now he seemed to get a bit restless. Draco honestly couldn’t blame him.
It had most definitely been the best decision he’d ever made.
“Home?” Harry had panted. Draco had just nodded, looking positively dazed.
“So,” Potter started, “You’re a Curse-Breaker.”
At first Harry didn’t really believe it when he thought he heard the sobs lessen. But then they slowly subsided altogether and when Harry looked at Draco’s face he looked straight into the silver of his eyes.
“Don’t try to move too suddenly. It’ll make you dizzy. It’s a side effect of the spell you were hit with, but it shouldn’t last for more than a day.” Draco noticed his voice had taken on a warmth and fondness he definitely hadn’t intended and he felt his cheeks warm up slightly.
. He was lying on his side, his chest against Draco’s back and one arm and leg wrapped around him - carefully avoiding his healing wound - in a gesture of possessiveness that he hadn’t thought himself capable of.
ready.
Harry watched him with that intense gaze of his again, obviously deciding he didn’t believe Draco. Of course he wouldn’t. “It won’t hurt for long.” Harry gave him a small, reassuring smile. “I’ve actually had quite some experience with the stuff.”
Possibly forever.
Draco wanted to protest, to tell Harry he could make it home himself in a bit, but his muscles felt so heavy and words never formed.
know about potions?” Harry heard the slight smile that was hidden in his own voice. He knew
Harry seemed to hesitate and Draco felt himself flush stupidly, realisation sinking in immediately. “Well, you obviously have other plans for tonight so I-.” Draco didn’t even finish his sentence before turning away. What was he? An imbecile? Of course Harry hadn’t been fruitlessly waiting, hoping for Draco to change his mind.
) to openly accepting (
The flicker of surprise that passed over Malfoy’s face was brief, but definitely there and Harry thought he knew why. ‘Please’ had never been part of their vocabulary.
“Can I-?” Harry asked. Draco just nodded. He was quite sure it was perfectly safe.
“I can cook us up something, if you’d like.” There was a question there, that Draco didn’t want to answer. The last time he had, the dream had abruptly ended.
Then Draco turned, picking Harry up with great care. Harry was bleeding, but even in his current haze Draco noted it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. This could be healed. He just had to get Harry to hospital quickly.
At the same time it was hard for Draco not to be annoyed, too: it was still another thing he hadn’t gotten quite right: being partially Veela, but without any of the perks to show for it. It seemed like him all over, completely fitting.
Harry nodded. They would follow up on that, of course they would, but he wasn’t sure how he felt about it. It had been so long since he’d even heard Malfoy’s name: Harry’d testified on his trial and although Harry hadn’t really agreed with Malfoy’s sentence, that had been the end of it.
It was Robards who eventually dropped the question, though: did Harry want to take on this very important, but delicate assignment?
Harry cocked his head and arched his eyebrows, then smiled. “You thought I might want to be alone,” he finished Draco’s sentence. His tone was genuinely warm. “No, not going to happen.”
Draco just nodded: he’d seen how Harry took his tea on a few occasions by now.
David had been allowed into the British Room without further ado, but Harry had wanted to make sure he was alright, only leaving after the boy had been relatively stable, being put into some sort of medical stasis, to ensure he didn’t bleed out before they would be able to stop it.
When he turned to tell Malfoy he could borrow some of his pyjama’s, Malfoy had already slipped under the bedsheets, however, his eyes closed.
So, the conclusion had to be that Harry apparently had a lot of real friends. Friends, who had all kept coming and who had accepted Draco, making him feel welcome in a way he would never have thought possible.
“It’s a very nice cottage, really homey,” Harry said, just for something to say, although it was actually true. Narcissa Malfoy’s living room had been small, but very cosy and warm, something he hadn’t really expected.
was cast. So Draco cast another spell, one he’d learnt to cast in tombs in Egypt, setting up orbs of blue light that made it surprisingly easy to see, but that had been designed not to set off any alarms.
Because they were just friends, nothing more, not now, not ever.
actually wondered he would have got his answer when they made it back to the large office space again.
“Harry, behind!” Harry turned around to find someone had apparently been able to lift the spell Harry’d cast on Nott in all the turmoil around them.
you usually have? You know, for dinner?”
“Potter? Do you mind? You know, since you don’t dance?” The question startled Harry a bit, its tone sure, but slightly teasing. It came from Blaise Zabini, who had apparently made his way towards Ginny and now watched Harry, eyebrows raised in an obvious question.
He went to the front door quickly. The Fidelius Charm wasn’t on his house anymore - hadn’t been since the end of the war - but he still obviously had Wards in place: the normal ones and some more complex ones that would usually take someone a long time to break.
She’d obviously understood what he meant, smiling back. “No thanks.”
“Oh.” Harry’s voice was soft when he said it and Draco realised Harry must have gotten back. Draco couldn’t quite get his eyes to open anymore, though, involuntarily drifting off to sleep.
At Harry’s house Draco had first made sure that Harry was comfortably settled on the sofa, then suggested ordering a curry for him.
should fucking get him to relax and sleep at some point.
And most importantly of all he told Blaise about how Draco had suddenly left. Too late for Harry to catch up.
“Penelope, I just got word. You’re needed at the Nott house for the rest of the afternoon,” Mathew came down the stairs to the cellar. “Apparently they’ve found something there that you need to take a look at. It’s urgent. Another Curse-Breaker got hurt and they need your help to disarm an object.”
and all that, but she didn’t, just sticking to: “I really think your test results were quite correct: the both of you are going to make Tracing Division proud.” She stopped for a beat, adding: “Already have, actually.”
“Are you okay?” Potter asked him softly, his fingers dangerously close to Draco’s wound already.
But Zabini had just told him not to fret (‘Really, it doesn’t do your Glamour any favours.’), so Harry had decided not to.
Harry saw how tired Draco looked all of a sudden, sagging slightly in his chair.
“Wait. I should have some photographs somewhere,” Harry said, getting up from his sofa, the one they’d moved to at some point after dinner.
Good.
“Did you actually go? You know, to that club Blaise recommended?” It was later that evening and Hermione had caught Harry unawares. Dean, Seamus, Neville and Ginny had been caught up in a heated discussion about refereeing in Quidditch that Harry had not had the energy to follow. And apparently Hermione had seen that as her cue.
“Malfoy?” But no answer came and after about five minutes of waiting fruitlessly, Harry went downstairs again.
in his eyes, though, and Harry silently reprimanded himself. How could he possibly have forgotten that Zabini was actually a close friend of Malfoy’s.
“Well,” there was the faintest level of doubt to Zabini’s voice, that was rather unlike him, “I think I can probably get us in, but there’s always a chance I’ll set something off, you know. It’s worth a try, though.”
“Er, no, I didn’t-,” Harry inadequately started to explain. “It just didn’t feel like the right time yet, really.”
Their room held single beds - even though they were currently pushed together - and Harry realised it would be easy to shove them apart. He found he really didn’t want to, though.
And of course Draco had confronted him, granted: after a few encouraging glasses of Firewhiskey and he’d found out that to Harry it had never been serious,
Harry had expected Hermione to agree to that easily, but instead she was silent for a short while before answering: “Well, I don’t know. He
Draco fell heavily against Harry when they hit stable ground. He watched Harry for a moment, breathing audibly, in an obvious attempt to keep standing, keep his eyes open just a little longer. “Corentin Didier. You need-, to ask-, for Corentin Didier.”
Draco only nodded, just before they were called away to meet the two French delegates.
kind of special, though. You’re male,” Luna continued. Draco intercepted a sigh that threatened to spill. He’d actually known that he was indeed quite male for, well, the better part of twenty years now, thank you very much. “Veela traits usually show in females,” Luna added, “which also has to do with the genetic properties. It makes male Veela exceedingly rare.”
Just a flicker of uncertainty, until Draco’s face evened out in cool indifference. “I don’t think we should ever mention that again.”
“No, it wasn’t anything like that,” Draco hastened to say, catching up with what Blaise was most probably implying. “He wasn’t here for-. I told you, he just came to lend me a book.”
have seen that I don’t agree,” Harry defended, knowing he meant it even more now than he had previously. “You’ve served your time. That should be enough.” Harry said it with utter conviction, making Malfoy’s face do something complicated that Harry didn’t really understand.
And that obviously included Potter.
Everyone else seemed to have.
“I still think-.” And here Harry watched him again, with that intent gaze of his that Draco just couldn’t look away from. Then Harry swallowed and said: “I still think that’s what we are.” Draco didn’t react, not quite trusting himself to be able to speak just yet, so Harry continued: “Luna said it would explain my er-, symptoms. I mean you’re obviously unbelievably attractive, but apparently I’m the only one who can see you actually glow. And when we’re apart-. Do you have any idea how ridiculously difficult it was to walk away from you after work this evening?”
Hermione smiled. She probably knew he was changing the subject on purpose, but let him anyway. “Yeah, of course.” Then she turned to leave the room. “See you there,” waving her hand at him in a quick goodbye.
Harry knew exactly what he looked like when he opened the door of their hotel room to let Ron and Hermione back in that evening, but he couldn’t be bothered to care. He looked like he’d just gotten out of bed and had only taken the time to sling on his trousers before opening the door. Which, of course, was precisely what had happened.
“I should be going too,” Draco quite superfluously stated. He sounded slightly hesitant, as if he wasn’t entirely sure it was a good idea, either.
Draco just very much wanted to be near Harry anyway, though.
“It has really started to look like a home, hasn’t it?” Harry said. It was the next weekend and they’d spent their Saturday looking for, and fortunately finding, a comfortable, but still elegant enough looking sofa and some other smaller things. Afterwards Harry had come back to Draco’s flat, seeing it for the first time now it was partly furnished.
“They’re coming! The Aurors have breached ..,” the wizard, seemingly running to warn Nott, didn’t even get a chance to actually finish his sentence, before he was effectively shoved out of the way by a spell.
Next to Draco Harry stifled a yawn and that snapped Draco out of his thoughts. “You should get some sleep. It’s been a long day and tomorrow we’ll have an early start.” Draco’s voice seemed to be drenched in a warmth that he most certainly hadn’t added intentionally.
And Harry noticed just how exhausted he looked. “I think you should probably get some sleep.”
“You should probably go, if you don’t want-, if you don’t want this. There must be another way to-, to make it stop.” Draco’s voice was quiet, but insistent. He needed to say this, however much he wanted to be with Harry. If Harry didn’t want to be with him, he-.
Potter sounded irritated and Draco fell silent, just for a moment, because even though he understood how that would be annoying - Potter really hadn’t had any say in the matter of Draco just turning up on his doorstep and then not even having the decency to wake up and just leave - Potter’s words still hurt somehow.
And that was the thing really: Draco made Harry happy, exceedingly so. It was strange perhaps, unexpected certainly, but there it was: Draco had somehow proved to be the missing piece of his puzzle.
“Good morning,” he shot back, glancing at the clock, then smiling because he couldn’t quite help himself. It was just before twelve.
He didn’t dress yet though, just putting on pants and a dressing gown and getting to the kitchen, where he started to do what he’d gotten up for, making everything he knew Harry liked for breakfast: toast, eggs, sausages and bacon accompanied by large quantities of tea to wash it all down with.
Right. Malfoy.
When he looked up at Draco’s face again, his eyes were closed.
Besides Draco was really good at chess, probably not as good as Ron, but really good all the same. And Harry wasn’t, he’d gotten better, yes, but he wasn’t that good.
No, it was the other thing he was worried about.
“How’s David?” Harry blurted out.
This change was exactly what he needed.
They only let go of each other when they heard Harry’s Floo come to life, apparently remembering at roughly the same time why the Floo was roaring.
Draco shrugged. “Someone else would probably have been able to do something about it and otherwise I would have been called in at some point anyway.”
While Harry was taking in the room, Malfoy had produced a suitcase from a small space under the bed - where it most definitely should not have fitted - and had started packing.
“But you do have tea with them?” Harry inquired, once he was over the shock that Malfoy’s statement had apparently caused him.
And it was okay. It really was. This just went to show how this couldn’t have worked anyway. Potter had his friends, this whole group of people around him. And Draco was no part of that, never would be.
Harry could only snort a laugh. “Since when have I ever preferred easy?”
“Do you also come here to, you know, pull people?” Harry felt an odd need to ask. He couldn’t help but think that, if Malfoy actually
Draco nodded slowly, feeling slightly mutinous, though. He and Astoria had never been
He was hit by his own projectile, which now had fragmented into tiny bits that were partly able to penetrate his frail shield.
lesson would probably not be half as in depth as Draco’s, it would still be better than no lesson at all.
“A few hours. In the end we decided it would be best to keep you sedated for a while: the first transition is usually extremely painful, you know, even if it is only partial.”
Harry had helped Draco take his robes off and now ushered him to what Draco hazily recognised as one of the many spare bedrooms Harry’s house had. It was the room he used the most, the one opposite Harry’s own bedroom.
They both turned in one fluid motion, like they choreographed it that way.
And all of a sudden Harry felt his curiosity get the better of him. Last week it had been Janet’s story about Malfoy and this week Harry’d overheard some students talk about how Malfoy taught them so much useful, practical stuff – much more so, apparently, than their former teacher had - and Harry decided it was only normal for him to be intrigued.
Harry was positioned next to the door of the dining hall and apart from the servant (apparently no house elves here) that had shoved a plate of food into his hands at some point, no one paid him any attention.
He was wearing a pair of beautifully tailored, black trousers, a fitted, white shirt and a dark grey waistcoat that accentuated his slender waist perfectly. Why did he always have to wear waistcoats? They were rather old-fashioned, even in the wizarding world nowadays, and they certainly had no business looking so absurdly and stunningly good on Draco it was almost unfair.
He had been talking to Zabini again, leaning against a windowsill this time, but he hadn’t come
Malfoy finished the spell he’d obviously been casting and only then looked at Harry, his eyes widening for just a fraction of a second before he addressed him: “Potter.”
“And Harry saw it? Your Patronus?” Blaise asked when he was able to form coherent sentences again. Draco just nodded. “You do know Harry's is has a nice, sturdy stag?” Blaise kept rubbing it in.
When Blaise eventually replied it was slow, as if he was considering every word. “You need to understand, after the war-. Well, people hardly took kindly to Draco.”
Right.
Harry registered, however, that Malfoy had apparently Floo-ed in, because he came in through the door. They could Apparate straight into their suite, but, this being a mostly Muggle hotel, there was no Floo in here: the only Floo in the hotel being in a separate room that could be opened by the right spell. Malfoy usually preferred Apparating, but he had evidently used the Floo room now.
“Come in,” it was unmistakably Malfoy’s drawl, but he wasn’t looking Harry’s way. Instead all of his attention, and a rather considerable part of his free office space, was taken up by what Harry immediately recognised to be a Crushing Cabinet.
“Good, that’s settled then. Night, Malfoy.”
Draco nodded. Blaise and Ginny Weasley had surprisingly been an item since a few weeks after Christmas break, taking the interhouse unity that McGonagall was preaching to a whole new level.
“I don’t even know whether
“It was him alright. I saw him, too.” Harry didn’t feel like elaborating, because really what was there to tell:
Draco just nodded. “Yes, I do. The question is: do you?” There was a challenge to his voice, but it wasn’t menacing, like once it would have been.
And then it hit him in full force: tomorrow Malfoy would leave again.
“Hold a shield, only lower when I cast,” Harry whispered. Draco nodded. Shields were his forte after all, had been since eighth year.
At lunchtime Harry came to Draco’s office, which was hardly surprising by now either. At least all of that was absolutely normal.
fast, though. That, together with his rather perfect aim, had always made him good at duelling. Which was something this fucker was definitely going to find out.
Harry still didn’t really know what to think about this whole thing, though. He actually hadn’t spared so much as a thought for what the aftermath of the war would have been like for Malfoy. Mostly he had just assumed Malfoy would have gone on being the prick he usually was, living the good life in Malfoy Manor and then moving to the Continent, because the weather was nicer or something.
At that Harry shot him a look Draco had difficulty reading and he feared he’d said something he shouldn’t have: he knew about house elves, but he didn’t know how Harry interacted with them. Not really. And he certainly didn’t know how Harry interacted with the house elf or elves that had come with this Black property.
So, Harry swiftly cleared his head of images of Dolores Umbridge scrutinising all teachers at Hogwarts and looked up the room where Malfoy would be teaching.
Even Draco’s own mind seemed to be mocking him.
And then he hadn’t even started thinking about all of the other things he hadn’t gotten right over time. And, even worse, all of the things he had and still regretted so much he could never make them right again.
They would be safe too.
That apparently was all the answer Blaise had been looking for. “Ah, ‘very good’ it is then.” He leant back in his chair. “How many times have you two met up?”
They went upstairs together. And so what, if Harry was a little unstable, tired and slightly tipsy, and Draco slipped his arm around his waist and let Harry lean into him a bit.
When Potter walked into Draco’s kitchen late that Sunday morning he was wearing an apologetic expression that didn’t really suit him. “I’m sorry. I think I should have …”
And that just wouldn’t do. Harry had to be okay. He hated Draco now, Draco had made sure of that, but that really didn’t matter. He had to be okay. He could hate Draco all he wanted, as long as he was able to do so in good health.
“Good,” Draco nodded. Harry would be able to go back to hating him in health again soon enough. “Do you need anything else?” Draco’s voice sounded carefully indifferent.
Draco looked around. There really wasn’t anything else that he needed, nothing else to add before this flat could become his home.
Draco just nodded, pleased that Harry apparently liked what he saw. “You haven’t painted the walls, yet, though?” It actually was more of a question than a statement.
Harry looked at Draco a bit startled, eventually saying: “She will in time, but she just needed to confide in someone else.” Adding: ”As I told you already: we’re still really good friends.”
That, however, was the moment Malfoy called out to him: “Get over here, you lazy sod.” And just like that Zabini was gone, making his way back to the bar.
Why again had he decided to take on this mission?
“Yeah, they were late getting here, just like you actually,” here Harry looked straight at Draco and Draco almost felt inclined to explain himself, elaborately, until he saw the humour in Harry’s eyes. “But they finished the whole thing today anyway. And I just decided to see whether it works.”
“Claude,” Harry heard himself say.
Harry tried it anyway. And failed. Miserably.
“Thanks.” Draco’s voice still sounded gravelly, like it always did when he’d just woken. He downed the potion and Harry could see that it was working, making the creases of pain in his face disappear.
Zabini just nodded: “Her cottage still needs a lot of work.” Then he suddenly shut his mouth as if now he’d really said something he shouldn’t have.
Then Draco leant back again and they started to move, easy at first, finding their rhythm. And then Harry remembered what Draco had said when they were practicing: ‘Don’t think, just let go. Dance like you fight.’
Draco ran his hand through his hair, pointedly not looking at Harry anymore, obviously upset. And Harry noted he didn’t just look tired anymore, he looked exhausted all of a sudden. “I-.”
Robards.
Blaise was early today, but then again: Blaise pretty much came whenever he pleased. Draco knew Blaise wouldn’t comment on anything though, probably noticing the signs of Draco’s weakness – there was very little that Blaise didn’t see - but refraining from saying anything about it, sparing both Draco’s and his own feelings.
“Yes. So now you’ve seen my whole fantastic, but still empty flat, can I have my locket back, please?” Draco, much to his own satisfaction, had successfully reverted back to his usual, arrogant drawl.
For some reason it irked Harry. Of course he knew Malfoy was probably dealing with a massive hangover so he wouldn’t be too keen on getting up, but …, Harry didn’t know why exactly: it just didn’t sit well. Would Malfoy be okay?
Draco shook his head, attempting to clear it. “I was-, what?”
And that’s what Draco did, in one gracefully fluent motion, Harry’s shirt fitting him better than it would ever fit Harry.
“Well, if you’re interested, I might know just the place,” Blaise now chipped in. “It’s a gay club that I’ve been to a few times,” Harry was about to say something, but Blaise effectively cut him short, “No, Potter, I’m not gay, but I’ve been to this club with some friends.” That actually shut Harry right up. “And it’s Muggle, so you could, you know, try things without your head being plastered all over
“Draco?”
Well, as long as they kept on casting, Harry taking them full-on from his position by the door and Draco from his position in the air: initially shooting spells at mostly unsuspecting guards.
trying to sprout Veela wings, when Harry brought you in. I imagine that would have been hard to miss.”
“You’re still here?” Malfoy slurred. There was a surprised frown on his forehead and he squinted a little as if the lights in the room were a nuisance.
And his lips: they were so soft. So soft against Harry’s.
“Don’t take me to hospital,” Draco’s voice sounded brittle and strained, as if it took a great deal out of him just to say it. “It-, I-, I wouldn’t feel safe.”
Harry let that sink in for a moment, then asking: “About the me looking-the-part bit: when should I make my first appearance as your bodyguard?”
“Was this Mike Goodall one of the guards that hurt you?” Harry asked and the question startled him too. He hadn’t really meant to ask it, although on the other hand he found he very much had.
They worked extremely well together.
Harry’s face must have shown some form of surprise, because Malfoy elaborated, slightly impatiently: “It’s rather late for an early shift. Even for the most famous Auror, I take it.”
“What the-?” Harry started.
Astoria knew him far too well.
He found Malfoy in his kitchen, definitely not looking amused. He looked Harry over a few times, quickly, before spitting: “Well, you took your bloody time getting here.” He sounded angry, but for some reason he didn’t quite look it: his eyes softer than they should be, even though his face was flushed and he’d obviously worried his lower lip enough for it to show.
He and Astoria had both known the marriage wouldn’t be a romantic affair, just convenience, meant to appease their respective families, and giving them both the freedom to have whomever they wanted on the side.
Luna shrugged. “Sometimes.”
Potter would easily have been able to back out if he’d wanted to. Which he obviously didn’t, because next thing Draco knew their lips had met, apparently making one of Draco’s hands decide to fist Potter’s shirt, making the kiss that followed seem much more desperate than he would have wanted it to.
“But,” Harry knew Hermione had a Muggle phone to keep into contact with her parents, “wouldn’t we need a number?”
Of course it wasn’t Harry, though. Why the fuck would it have been?
Harry just smiled brightly. “I really don’t mind,” he said it like he meant it. “But I would need your spare key, though.” It sounded like a practical observation, nothing more.
Only to see that Hermione had joined him.
“Nice work!” Zabini came up to Harry and Draco. “Although I don’t think this actually qualified as recon: I presume we’ve effectively wiped out what I think was probably most of the Cartel.”
Draco had really taken his sweet time in the bathroom, but when he came out he was completely dressed, in clothes that were quite clearly not pre trials - the materials rather course and his jeans not even close to form-fitting - but still he managed to look undeniably good, attractive. It probably didn’t help that his shirt hadn’t been buttoned up yet, hanging open and showing the creamy expanse that was his skin. It was very hard to miss.
He made it into the room, carelessly shrugging his robes off and nearly missing the sofa trying to hang them over its armrest.
like this.
Harry had noted it was odd that Malfoy lived in a Muggle flat, but he hadn’t given it any further thought. Perhaps he should have.
Harry smiled at him. “No, you two have fun,” Harry just said. Zabini could probably really dance, if his easy and confident way of moving was anything to go by, and so could Ginny. It would be nice for her to actually have a go with someone who wouldn’t ruin her shoes, her toes and her dress in the process.
Zabini shrugged: “Well, we just tend to take each other to events like these. It’s not much unlike you and Ginny, only we sometimes go home together afterwards.”
lunch.” Harry smiled playfully, but in a way that brooked little argument all the same.
This time it was Draco’s last class on Friday that Potter walked into. Granted, there were just five minutes left and Draco was already wrapping up when Potter suddenly appeared, but there he was. Draco forced himself to finish what he was saying without hesitation.
what he’d planned for this evening.
For Malfoy that would be quite different, though: he had grown up with magic. And although he probably wouldn’t have performed any household spells when he was young, for him magic was likely to come as naturally as breathing.
“Where’s Harry?” It was out, before Draco had actually had time to think about it, so he quickly added: “He brought me here, didn’t he?”
“Do you still need me to take your mind off things? Because I should probably remind you that Ron is safely home now.” Draco said, because he couldn’t quite help himself. His tone was light, bordering on arrogant even, but he could also hear his own uncertainty.
He’d always known he found women attractive, but at some point he’d also noticed how utterly attractive men could be. Then, however, he’d fallen in love with Ginny and she with him. It had been a good relationship and it had consequently evolved into a marriage. A marriage that definitely hadn’t been open. So, Harry had just put that other part of him - the part that liked men - on hold.
It was just after Draco’d taken a shower, his hair still dripping uncomfortably down his neck and the rest of him damp and very naked, that he felt the tug on his wards.
Zabini had averted his eyes and his voice was sort of soft when he finally spoke up: “I don’t think he would hex you, not anymore.” Then he looked at Harry and this time he did smile, amusedly so. “I think he would presumably just ignore you completely for some time, though.”
The wards, however dark, were of the sort that the owner would be able to pass without having to take them down, just like the wards on a house really, so whatever had been in the middle most probably wasn’t there anymore. All evidence Draco and Penelope had found had consistently been pointing to that.
Harry only nodded. “Was it any good?” Harry actually found he cared. Somewhat. “Meet anyone you like?” Well now,
Harry was flipping through the first out of the pile of casefiles he’d taken home with him for the night, hoping he could at least read through some of them, when he heard someone come in. When he looked up he saw Malfoy casually strolling into his living room. It was a sight Harry didn’t think he would ever really get used to.
Harry smiled at him. It was both bright and teasing. “Yeah, it would. But, well, it
And the thing was, Draco couldn’t actually blame Potter for it, either.
“So, when I saw you here, I just wanted to find out what you were up to. So-, you’re going to help?” The hope in David’s voice was almost painful.
Work hadn’t been so bad today: Terry had called in sick – Harry didn’t want to think too hard about why that could be – and Harry had been paired with Lisa Turpin, who had been called in to replace Terry for a few days.
cast straight afterward, though.
Zabini considered him for a moment. “I think you should ask
Draco just closed his eyes for a moment. Harry hadn’t even wanted to look at him earlier yesterday evening: he would never have taken him home if he’d actually had any say in the matter, if Draco hadn't been so bloody boozed-up he couldn’t actually stand up straight anymore, let alone Floo home.
Malfoy shot a
Right, of course
Then Draco had asked Jones whether he could take Kendrick for a walk around the grounds. A look that Harry didn’t quite get, passed between Francois and Jones at that. Then Jones just gave the two of them a sly smile and nodded.
“No problem,” Harry answered straight away. “You must have been really busy sorting this whole Mathew Dean thing out.”
When Harry woke the next day, it was to the feel of Draco’s body warm against his. It was something that even after all those months still managed to make him unequivocally happy.
worked: it never lasted. And every time it didn’t, it took a bit of Draco with it.
and-. Merlin, I need to get to bed.”
He had fallen asleep, his head lolling to the side a bit. He was still pale and Harry silently reprimanded himself. How could he not have noticed? Even Harry himself was tired and for Draco, having been wounded the way he was, that must have been worse.
“But I really need to go now,” Draco said next. It was true: they’d been at the cafe a lot longer than Draco had anticipated. The coffee had been worth it, though. So had the company.
“But she was training to be a Memory expert?” Harry said, feeling confused.
Come Monday Harry didn’t even wait for lunch break before he went over to Draco’s office in Curse-Breaking. It was the first thing he did when he got to the Ministry that morning.
“Oh, I didn’t tell you yet,” Harry said, when his head had cleared a bit, flushing slightly as he remembered what exactly he’d been so distracted by the day before that he hadn’t told Draco this yet. “Terry Boot has put in a request for his sentence to be reduced. His lawyer has written me a letter. I’ve just told him I wouldn’t know what to say that could help. I think the man has just written to anyone who’s ever worked with Boot, because, really, I wouldn’t know why else he would have asked
“Who said anything about really coming back.” Draco’s voice was just cool indifference, but his eyes had an unmistakable softness to them and were completely trained on Harry’s.
Malfoy looked up at her. “Yes, I wanted to let you know, but I didn’t have my phone on me. My apologies.” He actually
He didn’t say anything, though.
quite tired. Tomorrow, when Malfoy had got back, he might address this. Perhaps. If he’d still want to.
“Yes,” Harry answered blandly, probably trying to do the grown-up thing here, even if he was dealing with Draco. “The Auror Department has two French Aurors over this week and one of the things they want to know more about is our training programme, so that’s why they’re visiting today.”
But he had, his hand somehow possessively on Harry’s lower back now, urging him closer still. And Draco found there was absolutely no stopping the kiss that followed: it was hard and deep, somewhere between a kiss and a fight.
And once they did come, it was like he couldn’t stop them anymore, like he wouldn’t ever be able to reign them in, like he was drowning in them.
There really was a reason why he didn’t do this sort of thing: no friendships and most definitely no relationships. It was safer that way, because things you didn’t start, couldn’t end blowing up in your face either.
It was a dance they’d performed before, multiple times, and really this wasn’t the worst of it. Smith had started the school year hexing Draco whenever he’d had the chance and although Draco had consequently learnt to cast protective spells with an ease that left the other students sorely lacking, he wasn’t entirely sure he hadn’t deserved the hexes, the occasional curse.
Pure and undiluted and it was like nothing he’d ever experienced before. It was all-encompassing, almost too strong for his body and absolutely unstoppable. Draco went completely hot with it, as if his blood solely consisted of liquid fire and suddenly he felt it: the strength, the red hot fire coming to the surface of his hands.
That would hopefully take care of some of the wizards on the other side straight away.
It very quickly became clear he was in no such luck, though, when Malfoy wandered in out of his bedroom.
The thought didn’t even leave him half as pleased as he’d expected.
When that had been done, Harry had hoped they’d be left alone for a while, but that had obviously been too much to ask, because instead they were hauled off to one of the smaller office spaces to see some Healers, both him and Draco on different sides of the room.
And Harry had to admit: it was astoundingly beautiful to watch.
Harry had stayed the night. After their talk about Friday and The Leaky they’d talked some more. It had been easy and about nothing in particular, until it had stopped, their banter somehow replaced by an urge to touch that was too strong to ignore. So they hadn’t, ending up in bed like the night before. And Harry had stayed.
“Me too,” Draco answered, quite in spite of himself.
And then Draco had suddenly and quite unequivocally left. Harry had followed him outside as soon as he’d seen - startling Oliver and his friends out of their good mood - but to no avail. Draco had already apparated out.
Harry grinned. “You’re only partially Veela, though, and your traits are, well, rather subtle.” Harry’s voice had undoubtedly gone the slightest bit teasing, but his smile faltered a little, as if he wasn’t entirely sure how Draco would take it.
And Zabini had obviously noticed exactly what Harry had hoped he wouldn’t, because he laughed, short and cocky. “If it makes you feel better: probably not, no. Draco is taking a Portkey back to the Continent in about half an hour. Why, Potter? Would you like to take his place?” Zabini was teasing him now and although he
, sometime after the trials, but he surely wasn’t going to admit to Potter he’d read everything on him in both
Then the carved door started to creak open.
Harry decided to let that slip and glanced at his clock: its hour hand almost at lunchtime. Okay, Malfoy had a point. “I hadn’t realised it was this late already,” Harry said, swallowing the ‘You took your time getting up’ that threatened to come out next, instead just adding: “But yeah, I’m off today.”
It apparently took Malfoy a moment to recall who Harry was referring to, but when he did, he shrugged. “Nothing important,” adding, when Harry gave him his most piercing look: “Just something about you being my bodyguard. Which, of course, you are.”
And Harry found it was extremely difficult to look away from Malfoy again, especially now he was slightly blushing and all. Malfoy had finished changing into a pair of jeans that looked expensive and a shirt of which the sleeves had been rolled up to his elbows, everything fitting him to perfection.
So now he had a Patronus that, being a dragonfly, admittedly was a rather poor excuse for one - even though it normally did its job just fine - and he had some Veela heritage that wasn’t particularly Veela at all.
Then he let go. “Now go and have fun.”
Harry had become a more and more permanent presence in his flat and it had felt so good, so natural, so much like he belonged there. But Draco also knew what Harry had told him when they’d started this, that he wanted to help Draco finish his flat, so he could settle in and feel at home. Nothing more.
actually here, though. That had to count for something.
“Sir?”
It hadn’t been a problem at first: they had owled each other regularly and even though Draco had known this couldn’t be real, he had still allowed himself to dream. Just a bit.
“You mean, because I’m Veela?” Draco asked, still feeling slightly puzzled.
He fell.
It had been the most exhilarating thing to have happened to him in a long time.
So Harry produced the ingredients Draco had told him to bring and showed them.
“Can’t. It’s fine, though. I, I just need to get home.” Draco knew his voice wasn’t particularly loud, but it was all he could manage.
They had kissed. And then they’d made it upstairs, to his bed and … . Harry quickly lifted the bedsheets skimming his body. Okay, he was fully dressed and so was Draco apparently. So, they hadn’t actually … . Good.
So that was what Potter thought was the matter with Draco. Well, probably besides him quite flatteringly thinking Draco was smashed.
Harry smiled at him too. “All right.” And after a slight pause. “See you tomorrow.”
Not here, at Astoria’s wedding of all places.
That’s when Harry
his class on Tuesday either.
Draco just shrugged.
. Draco still hadn’t answered, or even read, any of Harry’s owls either, even though Harry had kept sending them.
Then she saw the two men in full body binds. “I thought, when you had to leave so abruptly, that you could probably use some help, but I see that everything’s completely under control here.” She smiled a little, then focussed her attention on Draco, understanding dawning suddenly. “They were after you.”
Then Malfoy looked in his direction and before Harry could look away, Malfoy was watching him, a flicker of what looked almost like uncertainty, then a faint, amused smile on his lips.
It was the moment their waiter chose to come over to their table and ask them what they’d like to have for dinner.
“Of course,” Harry simply answered. “Mr Mauvay showed me a few very interesting specimen the other day.
Harry felt entirely underdressed again.
But the voice he heard now obviously wasn’t Potter’s. It was female for starters. “Mr Malfoy was hit by a rather vicious curse.”
To Harry’s slight surprise, the film had really been quite entertaining and it was only when it had ended that Harry watched Draco again.
Thoughts of Draco, in Harry’s case. Of how much Draco seemed to have changed, of how he could still be quite annoying, but surprisingly nice at the same time.
Perhaps they had both grown up.
And that was exactly what Harry did.
So he’d gotten up at ten and spent the rest of his day at home, mostly reading books on Curse-Breaking and Potions that could be useful in his line of work, making himself a quick and simple sandwich in between.
Then David started talking properly, about his sister Alice who had got involved with a man when living in France and about how this man had got her addicted to the pills the Dragon Cartel made and how, when she had finally decided to try and stop and get out of the relationship, she had owled her brother. She hadn’t made it to their meeting point, though, so her brother had gone to the coordinates she had provided in case anything went wrong. It had got him outside what he thought could be the Cartel’s headquarters.
Malfoy gave him a glance that was almost shy and it was so unusual that Harry wasn’t at all sure it had been there in the first place.
So why did Harry feel this, this thing, at seeing her dance, having fun with Dean?
And then there had been this ridiculous ball yesterday, which had meant he hadn’t had a nicely relaxed Friday evening. And now, on top of all that, he didn’t even have the weekend off, either. No, instead he needed to attend this stupid meeting that he had only been informed of yesterday afternoon.
The waterfall was exactly as Harry had imagined it to be: very cold and wet, but when he looked back at Draco he saw it was much more than that: Draco had stopped being Francois and when Harry looked down at himself he saw his hands were not Kendrick’s anymore either, but his own.
of all people.
Harry’s professional brain kicked in then and there, so he started asking questions. How long would he be away for, what would be his clearance, what would he officially be able to do (could he make arrests), and so on and so forth.
So Harry told him, about the wedding and how nice it had been, and about how he had seen so many people he’d lost contract with over the years.
When everything had become solid again, Harry looked around to find he was in a small office in what seemed to be an otherwise deserted building. There was a table and two chairs and not much else: his agent still noticeably missing too.
Malfoy watched him for a beat, his grey eyes searching as if he wanted to detect the lie behind Harry’s words.
“Yes,” Harry answered.
“Did you see who did this?” Potter now asked, obviously referring to the curse.
Then Draco took an audible breath in. “Well, let’s just do this.”
“Yet another Unspeakable deigning to have lunch with the rest of us here,” Draco said, trying for humorous, no real sting to his words. The sting with regard to Hermione Granger had left him a long time ago anyway.
“He was hit by a modified Stunner, nothing too bad, we think, but when a Healer wanted to examine him, he refused to be seen by them. He asked for you by name. Didn’t want anyone else doing anything.”
When Jones couldn’t see them anymore Draco asked Harry to use his cloak to cover them both. They had to crouch a bit to fit, keeping close to each other, close enough for Harry to smell Draco’s cologne. It actually was rather nice.
Oh, this really wasn’t going anywhere. Sitting on his sofa with a book was just completely useless.
And Harry thought Draco understood by the way his hand slowly unclenched Harry’s T-shirt and ended up on Harry’s hip, their kiss now lacking all previous urgency,  turning deep, slow, sweet and utterly divine instead.
Harry didn’t particularly want to, but instead of watching Ginny and Zabini, he found himself gazing at Astoria and Malfoy walking to the middle of the room together. He couldn’t really get himself to stop, which wasn’t much of a problem until Malfoy watched him too, a look on his face that Harry was completely unable to read.
?” Draco drawled to the head in his recently installed Floo. He’d felt his voice go even more arrogant with sheer incredulity.
So Harry waited outside of Malfoy’s classroom until the second year students came piling out, chattering loudly about how - by the end of class - they’d all been able to break the rather challenging curse Malfoy’d apparently set them. Then, Harry went in.
Of course it had been. It always was with Potter.
“Well,” Harry struggled. “Yeah,” surprising Draco by adding: “but if you don’t want it to be … . I mean, I could imagine-. Perhaps you don’t want-.”
rather out of it at the time: you looked quite feverish and you were obviously in a lot of pain.”
It would end in the sort of thing where Harry would undoubtedly resent his presence without saying so and Draco would feel utterly stupid because of it.
“Yep,” Seamus agreed, sitting himself down opposite Harry straight away.
The man had obviously seen him looking, for he started to explain: “I’ve been working this case undercover, so it probably won’t come as a surprise to you that I’m wearing a Glamour. For all intents and purposes you’re going to know me as Francois.”
“Do you keep hangover potion somewhere?” Harry couldn’t help the slight tease in his voice. Malfoy was just so-, so
Like last night it looked like Potter was going to apply the Dittany himself and Draco didn’t really know what to do. Should he allow him to? Yesterday that had been fine, hadn’t it?
“So, do you have plans for dinner? Or do you have to work tonight?” Harry asked next and his voice had a tinge of shyness to it that Draco wished he hadn’t heard.
So Draco went up to a brown haired man with a boyish smile that took his fancy. And found himself utterly and completely bored within minutes.
Harry called for help straight away.
Harry just nodded, quickly taking a look at the menu that had been in front of him the whole time, as he now saw a waiter approaching.
Yesterday, before that first class, he’d been slightly nervous - not entirely sure whether he’d still like it - but now, while waiting for his second years to show up, he noticed he actually felt calm. He knew he could do this.
“So, tomorrow we’re going to leave Hogwarts. And next year we won’t be coming back,” Draco mused. It was a truth Draco hadn’t appreciated the exact implications of until he’d said it. Harry fell silent.
Yes, right, Brussels, that was where the Cartel was apparently operating from.
Like today.
“Hey.” Harry looked a bit flustered, watching Draco up and down and up again slowly. It made Draco feel self-conscious, almost shy, like Harry could look straight through him.
“I’ll start on dinner.” Harry plainly said next. He didn’t really think this was about dinner, but he wasn’t sure what it actually
“Yes, we do, but we’re going to St Mungo’s first, to see whether you actually were obliviated.” Harry kept looking at Malfoy, who was obviously having trouble waking up. It was quite disconcerting to see him like this, because for some reason Harry had just always assumed that Malfoy got out of bed looking like he always did: completely put together, everything in place. That very much wasn’t the case, though. Malfoy looked like he, well, like he’d been asleep really: his eyes squinting a bit, like he had trouble adjusting to the light and his hair messier than Harry’d ever seen it.
Harry flushed a bit. “Coming!” he yelled back, adding just for Draco to hear: “She’s dropping Rose off for the evening so she and Ron can celebrate their fourteenth wedding anniversary together. Sorry, I didn’t realise it was this late already.”
All of it was better than feeling dejected.
“Now, now, Mr Malfoy, we can’t have you get rid of my friends here. They’re needed, you see. We need that Time-Turner. And for that, well-.” Mathew didn’t finish his sentence, but the implication was clear. It didn’t bode well for Harry.
So, he’d never told anyone.
As Draco had expected, Harry was still asleep. Normally Harry was an early riser, but after a night like the one they’d just had, he usually slept in. So, Draco softly put the parcel on his bedside table and held the tray suspended next to where Harry was sleeping.
And then his memory came leaking back to him, not all of it, but enough to feel utterly embarrassed all the same.
Potter looked at Draco now. “Do you want to stay for lunch? I’m quite hungry, so I suppose you must be, too?” Draco noticed that even that second sentence seemed to hold some sort of question.
She immediately started casting again, but Draco’s protective shield was up even faster and positively glowing with force, taking the hit of her spell with ease.
It was only then that Draco dared look at Harry again, finding a velvety warmth to Harry’s green gaze that seemed to ease the cold immediately. “Yes, just trying not to be offended at you discussing me, and my spectacular Veela humps, behind my back,” Draco said much more honestly than had been his intention. Well, at least his voice had sounded indifferent enough.
to be there. This Malfoy, night-time Malfoy, the soft, gentle one, the one that seemed to understand him in a way not many other people did.
Draco could feel the sweat gathering on his upper lip. He didn’t know how long he had been casting exactly, but it had been an embarrassingly long time for something as simple as a protective ring.
He was glad now that Hermione had directed her question at Draco immediately. Draco, however, clearly hadn’t expected it yet, flinching a bit. “Well, apparently. I obviously don’t remember.” He sounded arrogant, indifferent, but Harry now thought he could hear the uncertainty underneath.
Suddenly Draco felt so cold, he could barely keep it from showing.
actually fly. As you are well aware. They don’t need to be Veela to-.“ And that was when Harry captured his lips in a kiss so tender, so utterly sweet that Draco abruptly lost his whole train of thought.
changed,” Harry said. It held all the warmth he felt. And he meant it. The old Draco would never had thought he deserved anything bad, let alone punishment.
All of that didn’t matter now, though. It had been a markedly busy week, with a group of potions smugglers from Europe also infiltrating the UK market - almost untraceably so - like ghosts. It was maddening.
That was not what he said to Harry, though. “I would have thought you’d love the gawking. I seem to remember being cornered by awestruck first years was your favourite pastime in our last year of Hogwarts.” It came out every bit as light, and condescending, in tone as Draco had intended it to.
Like Draco, Harry tried to Glamour back up again, but it didn’t work. The waterfall had apparently taken care of that, reminding Harry of the waterfall at Gringotts: it wasn’t like they couldn’t use magic here at all: Harry’s Lumos still worked perfectly well. It was just their Glamours that failed.
Draco looked at him slightly annoyed. “As if you didn’t-,” he all but gritted out, then stopped himself, knowing Blaise well enough to realise that it would probably be a mistake to go down that particular road. He continued on a different note: “Well, let’s not forget that
Blaise smiled a little. “I don’t think he will. He’ll probably be intrigued enough to read. Be patient, though.” Then he smirked, knowing that wasn’t exactly Harry’s strong suit. “Wait for
“Right in one.” Blaise sounded much too gleeful.
When Harry touched his wings, it was like a bolt of lightning striking, Draco’s whole body flaming up. His breathing suffered, becoming fast and uncontrollable. He let out a groan that was quite involuntary.
“So if I can’t make it tomorrow, you wouldn’t be able to install it within the next
“Good morning,” Malfoy said it casually over his shoulder when Harry had made it into the kitchen. Malfoy was at the stove, frying, wearing the same pair of pyjamas he’d had on yesterday, his feet just as bare too. It made him look exposed in a way Harry didn’t quite know how to deal with, a way that he hadn’t had time to register yesterday morning when he’d been in too much of a hurry.
The first thing Draco noticed when he woke up the next morning was the unmistakable, throbbing headache that too much alcohol usually left in its wake and he immediately contemplated not opening his eyes at all, knowing that that would only make things infinitely worse.
now.” And just like that Harry’s gaze was gone again, directed at the enormous blob of blue that was still on the floor instead.
It took Draco just a moment too long to get what Harry was saying: it seemed as if Harry didn’t dislike this date thing as such, he was just afraid that
And Harry still didn’t have a clue. So he tried to find support with Hermione, who was sitting next to Blaise. “Oh, of course,” was infuriatingly the only thing she said, though - not specifically to Harry - like the answer had just popped into her head.
Draco couldn’t help but smile. “Of course, it’s your birthday. Your thirtiest no less,” he said, gently kissing Harry again. And again, just for good measure. “So I thought I’d make you breakfast.”
“Fawkes,” Ron then said.
Penelope hadn’t been right. On Tuesday Draco was still infuriatingly absent from his office, from the Ministry, from
Draco had planned everything meticulously: he had bought a wizarding cookbook, tried out a few recipes (it really
When he got there, Harry knocked softly and this time the door opened to him straight away: no awkward waiting outside.
“Some are not terribly good at making the right decisions, though.” Draco continued quietly. “
That was the moment Draco chose to wake up this morning, however, and as soon as he’d opened his eyes, looking around slightly bewildered at first, he extricated his legs from Harry’s and sat up. “I-, I didn’t realise it was this late already. I should leave.” He sounded largely in control, but didn’t quite look it yet: still completely naked, his hair a mess.
They took the stance they would start from and then Draco leant into Harry, his cologne strong and satisfying, and Harry thought Draco would whisper something encouraging, but he didn’t, instead just giving Harry a kiss on his jawline, fleeting, but warm and filled with promise and Harry knew it was exactly what he had needed.
“I’m sorry I haven’t visited you before,” was the first thing Penelope said and she seemed to mean it.
“I’m supposed to tell you to have lunch and then have a look at the assignment you’ll be working on as of next week,” the efficient looking wizard said, dropping a file on their desk. “Have fun.” And with a smile that said their case would probably be as much fun as watching a blade of grass grow, the wizard left them to it.
know that house elves are perfectly capable of doing something like that?”
Draco was.
Draco didn’t know what to make of this for a moment. Harry had obviously successfully managed not to mention Draco’s perceived obligation to produce an heir or the word pureblood, for that matter, but Harry was still clearly implying all of it.
This time Harry woke up when Draco got out of bed somewhere throughout the night. It was still early, but Harry saw the soft beginnings of morning already filtering through his curtains.
“Do you still use it a lot? I mean since you’re working in the wizarding world again?”
He just
“Yeah, I thought I’d make us something decent today. I actually like a full English, but cooking elaborately like that just for myself sort of feels like a waste, really.” It was only now he said it, that Harry realised how true it was. He actually liked the repetitive action of cooking, but not the eating alone part that usually came afterwards. So he’d just taken to conveniently not cooking at all. Just toast. And tea. For breakfast.
It took Draco by surprise. Well, at least until he remembered what a sanctimonious do-gooder Potter usually was, which meant it didn’t really mean anything. Not really.
“He’s grown into his looks, don’t you think?” Of course Hermione had seen where Harry’d looked just now. There really was no point in denying it.
And there was nothing for it: Harry could only pull him in close, giving him the warmest ,most welcoming kiss he could, while Draco kissed him back like his life depended on it.
So that’s how Harry and Draco ended up in a Muggle hotel. It wasn’t completely high end but still posh enough for Harry to feel slightly uncomfortable. He thought that Draco might like it, though, and, well, the money was hardly a problem. Even if the Ministry never paid him back, Harry had more of it than he could ever spend in a lifetime.
Malfoy.
Besides he also felt Harry’s gaze on him and it was so intent he couldn’t ignore it for the life of him. So he didn’t, staring back straight into the green of Harry’s eyes, beautiful, even behind his glasses.
“You were having a good time last Friday, weren’t you? You know, with Wood. You would be perfect together,” Draco said casually, when he spoke up again. It almost sounded like he didn’t care. Almost.
if he was being honest with himself.
The first thing that Harry noticed was the strong smell: sweet and persistent. And then it was gone. He looked at Zabini, who for some reason seemed to have understood what Harry meant even though he hadn’t said a word.
“Malfoy, are you asleep?” Potter’s question was soft, not as impatient or annoyed as Draco would have expected it to be. It was the reason Draco opened his eyes: he would have wanted to be asleep, though, or even better still, unconscious, anything not to have witnessed his stupidly nearly fainting into Potter’s arms. He really could have gone his whole fucking life without ever experiencing
“I was on my way out.” Draco just said instead, his voice much too gravelly with sleep to his own liking.
Malfoy was sitting on the curb, one long leg outstretched and the other drawn in, his arm casually leaning on his knee, a glass of whiskey in his hand. He was watching Harry, but it didn’t seem antagonizing, more resigned if anything. And wary too, possibly.
She nodded. It was a quick, sharp movement. “Yes.”
