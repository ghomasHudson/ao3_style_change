“Fuck,” he moaned. “
he thought, reminded of how a flobberworm might squirm and wildly flail about when poked with a stick.
She added, staring at Parvati, whose hand had just shot up.
-	It is none of your business were my friends are or why I was crying. – Malfoy responded rudely. – Now, shut up and leave me alone. If you don’t want to you don’t need to leave the booth, but bother me and I won’t bother you.
With all the love, Remus and Padfoot.
“Yes Dobby. Can you give me something that was left from dinner? I was in detention with Umbridge and I was kind of forced to skip dinner. How is Winky doing, is she felling better here at Hogwarts?” the boy said while sitting in one of the stools of the big table. A few minutes later a plate with rice, chicken, salad and a cup of pumpkin juice were in front of him. Harry started eating and Dobby sat in front of him telling him about Winky and how his week was going and how happy he was working at Hogwarts.
It had been a really hard day.  Harry took his little babies out of the pockets of the cape and placed them on his pillows. He open the curtains slightly for him to get out and go to his trunk get his pajamas. He returned to the safe zone and prepared to sleep. This bed was more comfortable but felt a little different. It took Harry over half an hour to finally manage to sleep.
He had made such a huge mistake, he had handed Draco Malfoy something that could endanger the lives of people he cared about. He knew that he was now a Slytherin and that they supposedly protected each other, but that most likely did not apply to revealing very important secrets like the fact that Remus knew were a prison fugitive was or that the Boy Who Lived was in contact with said fugitive. Someone didn’t need to be a genius to understand what was written in that letter and who it was referring to. He needed to talk to Draco and plead for him not to say a word of what he had read.
“Good night, sleep well.” The blonde responded with a smile cleaning the tears. Harry returned to his own bed and closed the curtains. His sleep didn’t came immediately, he stayed awake for a while thinking about Draco’s words before falling asleep.
Since Harry was seated in the row next to the wall, he had full view of the Gryffindor table, so he noticed when Hermione got up, looked at him and signaled him that she would wait outside for him. Harry took a deep breath and nodded in agreeance. He finished his food and excused himself, telling the other teens that he was going to leave first and walk with Hermione.
“Dumbledore said that he had received a letter from you and that you said you wanted to be left alone. It’s Dumbledore, why would he lie?” the girl asked. “Now that you mentioned it no, he didn’t show any letter. That is odd! Why didn’t I ask to see the letter? I could have told if it was really from you or not, with the amount of your homework I corrected.” The girl said now scratching her head. “I don’t get it. But still, you could have told Dumbledore when he saw you at the trial, that you wanted to leave, I’m sure he would have let you leave.”
-	Don’t worry about it. That woman would have invented a way or another to get me in detention. In the hearing if she had what she wanted I would have been expelled without even having a chance to defend myself. What saved me was Ms. Figg and my memories of what happened, otherwise I would have been expelled. – Harry said with a twinge of anger in his speech. – I have to go now, but we can talk Sunday alright?
-	We were only respecting what you wanted, why are you talking like that? – She answer. – You said you wanted to be left alone so we left you alone. We only wanted to respect your wishes.
-	Seems kind of reasonable to me, so that’s alright. Now let’s go and get breakfast. – The blonde said, getting up and putting Opal in the pillow.
Harry finished eating and the plate disappeared with a snap of Dobby’s fingers being replaced with a slice of Treacle Tart in a plate. He ate it with pleasure. After, the plate disappeared again.
When Morning came Harry woke up with the sound of all the other boys he shared a room with also getting up. Seeing as there were 6 boys trying to occupy the showers he decided that he would that a shower at night before going to bed. He fished his uniform from his trunk and got dressed in his bed with the curtains closed. After he was ready he picked up his timetable to see which subjects he was going to have today. In the morning he was going to have Care of Magical Creatures, which was a subject he rather enjoyed. In the evening he was going to have Defense, which put a frown in his face almost immediately just thinking about the person that taught the subject. That class was faded to go wrong.
-	Maybe he isss laughing at your uglinesss, what other reassson could he have? – responded the fully dark snake.
7:35 AM
“I suppose it was the same person that restricted my mail, because according to Remus, Snuffles sent me a few letters before giving up and I received none of them, and by the way you are talking I take it that none of you received any of the letters I sent. I just felt so tired and sad all the time and I needed you and I felt like you were ignoring me and didn’t care anymore, that’s why I exploded in the train, I’m sorry.” Harry said looking a mix between tired and sad, he knew the topic was inevitable, but still didn’t want to talk about it. “Something that I don’t get is why would anyone that knows what happened in the cemetery and knows me think that I would like to spend my summer with the Dursley’s. You have an idea of what they do to me. Why did you believe that letter? I get it if Remus and Sirius believed him, they have no idea of what the Dursley’s put me through but you and Ron and the Weasley’s know. Why did you believe that letter? Did you even see it?”
-	Snuffles, I’m really happy to see you too. I’m a little bit mad that you didn’t answer any of the letters I sent you and for believing that I wanted to be left alone during the summer, but you don’t know me that well so I can’t really condone you for that. I just wish you had answered at least one of the letters I sent you or even sent me a letter at all. -  The boy said.
Harry got his books and then went looking for the Transfiguration class room, it took him a while but he finally managed to get there 10 minutes before class. As he entered he could already see that the right side of the class was occupied by Ravenclaws, so he chose a seat in the left side in the back. A few minutes later the rest of the Slytherin fifth year students arrived and occupied the rest of the left side of the class room. At exactly 9 AM Professor McGonagall entered the classroom and started her class. The class occurred without accidents and Slytherin managed to get 15 points from answering right the questions the teacher asked. When they left for lunch, Draco pushed Harry aside and asked him if they could talk at the end of the day, to which Harry agreed.
-	Do you really underssstand usss? We haven’t talked with a Human in ssso long. – said a greenish snake with a triangular head.
-	No, he isss not! Becaussse I am the prettiessst one between usss and all the other sssnakesss in these shop. -  responded the white ringed snake with what sounded like a crying voice.
-	Because he’s Dumbledore and he received a letter from you saying that, so he asked us to leave you alone. – Ron said still in his angry voice – He was really worried about you as all of us were, so we did what we thought was best and respected what you asked.
Hearing the high voice of their little human, both Opal and Onyx left their exploring of the booth aside and climbed the boy’s leg and tried to caress his face like he usually did when he had them on his lap. That seemed to work a little bit, since the boy took a deep breath and thanked them caressing them in return. Also making the boy not notice the worried face that Sirius made when Harry mentioned the Dursley’s and the quick change from worried to surprised at the appearance of the snakes.
“Thank you. You know, for someone rather good at cooking, I really am bad in Potions. It surprises me sometimes.” Harry said with a laugh. The other kids exchanged a look between them but remained silent and finished their homework. When everyone had finished their homework, they got up and left the Common Room to go to the Great Hall for Lunch.
I want to thank all the people that read the first chapter, bookmarked and left kudos, thank you very much to all of you, I wasn't expecting that many people to read it, nor bookmark or leave kudos.
“How is Remus doing? Do you know? Apparently, there was an advance made with the wolfsbane potion that makes the person taking it does not feel any pain, besides keeping their human mind during the full moons transformation and Remus offered himself to serve has a guinea pig. Did he say anything in his last letter, I was curious to see if it had worked? That way maybe we can have him teaching in Hogwarts again next year. He really was the best teacher we had.” Hermione said in an effort to relieve the air.
-	Well, all those people are idiots then. I have to go now, Remus just got home and I have to go help carry the stuff he bought in the market. I’m very glad to have talked and seen you Harry. Know that I love very much. Goodbye.
But I'm back and even though I don't have a firm schedule I will try and update once every 2 or 3 weeks. I hope you stay and that you enjoy the story. In the next few days I'll be revising the other chapters because I read them t make sure what I wrote in this chapter made sense with what came before and I found a lot of errors.
-	Seeing as you weren’t present Friday and I am a prefect, I was given the task to give you the speech we usually give the first year students. – Draco said sitting straighter that he was already – First things first, our house, now yours too, isn’t the House of Evil as some students call it. It is true we have our fair share of Evil wizards, but the Merlin, most powerful and important wizard to date was a Slytherin, in case you didn’t know. Most people believe we are all into the Dark Arts just because of the actions of some of the former students of the house, but that is another lie created by the other houses and unfortunately not denied by people that know us. Even though the majority of the Slytherin students is pureblood we still have some that aren’t, like Tracie Davies from our year. And in case you are wondering, no, the few students that are muggleborn or half-blood aren’t mistreated in this house. The Slytherin house is already abused enough by outsiders that we don’t need to create more problems on the inside.
-	As well as they can go when someone doesn’t hear from his friends at all, is expelled from school for saving a life and has to face the Wizengamot and live under the Dursley’s roof for 2 months. – Harry says sarcastically.
It took him a while but he finally managed to fall asleep.
Harry picked up the shard of mirror and looked at it. It looked like a normal piece of a broken mirror, he could see his reflection perfectly well. He said Sirius name out loud and waited for something. A few seconds later the surface of the mirror started getting foggy and when the fog disappeared harry could see his godfathers face. Harry smiled brightly and Sirius face wasn’t any different.
-	Could you please speak one at the time, please? I can’t understand you if you talk all at the same time? – Harry asked and all the snakes shut up leaving only one of them speaking.
-	Why isss the human laughing? -  asked the snake with the white ring her head.
3- Sirius and Remus are living together in Remus's place. In my mind they were in Grimmauld Place during the summer and it was really hard for Sirius being there, so they moved to Remus's place in the beginning of the school year, since it would help them both and no one needed the house.
-	Without ever practicing them beforehand? - said Parvati incredulously. - Are you telling us that the first time we’ll get to do the spells will be during our exam?
-	I can. I found out in my second year during a dueling class. – Harry said. – At the time people weren’t very happy about it, so I choose to not talk about it.
“He didn’t say anything, I tried talking to him last night, but he wouldn’t respond, so I don’t know how he is doing. But that is really nice. I’ll ask him tonight when I try to talk to him again” Harry said absent minded, looking at his snakes having a play fight in the grass. They were really pretty with their scales shining with small rainbows. “Well, last night was a full moon so he couldn’t really talk to you, but how could you contact him? Owls aren’t that fast?” Hermione asked a little confused.
He opened his eyes, groaned when he saw how he looked — collared, flushed, grinding against his hand as he touched himself — and closed them again, the fantasies overwhelming his mind.
to get him worked up, but the perceived thoughtlessness (he was

but Draco ignored him. “Hm, just a nice mouth for me to put my cock in whenever I want to feel good. Can you
“Puppies don’t talk,” Draco said, “do they?”
He started when he felt the cool, tingling feeling of Draco’s cleaning spell in his other hole, and his mind brought up the time that Ron had replaced their lube with toothpaste as revenge for having walked in on them.
The pain was closer to bearable now, though he was still dying to be able to take things at his own pace. Draco continued to fuck him steadily, and Harry was held in place, denied control over anything. He couldn’t speak, and with Draco’s fingers in his mouth, he couldn’t focus enough to swallow, so he knew that his face was getting even messier as spit wet his chin. He didn’t know what to do with his tongue.
Harry gasped, and he knew by now that he was past the point of embarrassment. “Yes, fuck, please—”
“Draco, I — fuck, I’m going to cum—”
“Merlin, Cassie!” he said loudly, expecting the knock to have come from his secretary. Cassandra was new, and a sweet girl, she really was, and Harry adored her, but she felt the need to alert him personally about
By the time he realized he hadn’t said anything to respond to Draco, it had been long enough that Draco knew his mind had been wandering.
Draco said something under his breath, and Harry was about to ask what it was when he felt the collar quickly grow cold and then to normal temperature, for the second time. And then Draco kissed him briefly, and the wonderful feeling wasn’t there, and Harry whined as Draco broke away and smirked at him.
Harry whined again, but he nodded and pressed back against Draco, who chuckled sleepily and moved his hand lower, cupping Harry’s small dick and sliding two fingers easily into his cunt. He laughed again when Harry moaned and ground against Draco’s palm.
“I love you,” he moaned out quietly, and it was embarrassing to say
hard, and that turned him on even more. He forced himself to listen to Draco, and moved his hand lower, pressing two fingers into himself.
puppy, too, wanting me to fill him up so badly. You’re dripping so much.”
,” he said, when Draco’s fingers pushed a little deeper inside him, “and you telling me how desperate and pretty I look when I fuck you and try to feel good even though I can’t cum from that, and you’d make me fuck you while you touched yourself, until you came….” Harry jolted when he felt Draco’s tongue on him again, but once again, it was there only a second before Draco pulled back again.
Harry seldom came twice in the same session, but now it didn’t seem so far fetched: he felt sparks flickering in him — little beginnings of, hopefully, fireworks still to come. The number of sparks increased when Draco pressed the vibrator harder against Harry’s dick, and he felt his cunt tighten around Draco’s fingers.
. Not too long, not too short. The perfect size to occupy Harry’s mouth, and the perfect size to feel inside him without discomfort. And it was right there, when Harry’s mouth was watering and ready and—
“I’m never taking it off.”
Harry was about to say something that would undoubtedly be extremely eloquent and romantic, but then Draco kissed him and he had no choice (or desire) other than to kiss back.
“You want me to fill you up and get you pregnant?” Draco murmured, slowly rubbing himself on the outside of Harry’s cunt. “You want that, baby?”
“...feels so good,” he murmured absently against Draco’s mouth, and Draco hummed and kept kissing him.
occasions typically ended with Harry being forced roughly to his knees as soon as they walked through the front door of their home.
He felt Draco kiss his neck above his tungsten collar, and Harry gasped when Draco pushed a hand under Harry to touch his dick with two fingers.
Draco kept smiling at him, and sat back, tugging Harry up by the leash so they were both sitting on their knees on the soft bed, Draco always being the taller. Draco kissed Harry again, cupping his face, and Harry made a soft noise as Draco used the leash to pull him closer.
“Draco,” Harry gasped, but he hadn’t remembered thinking it before he spoke. He was so far gone; everything seemed like a fantastical dream. “Draco….”
, did he look
Harry was still seated, and when Draco stepped closer, his cock just inches from Harry’s face, what little self control Harry had left stretched as thin as a wire.
“What was that?” Draco prompted. What a sadist.
...which reminded Harry, once more, of the collar. The gorgeous tungsten collar, which he always had on, which identified Harry as
He felt Draco’s fingers thread through his own, and grasped Draco’s hand, letting out quiet gasps of appreciation from Draco’s lips against him. It was overwhelming, during this, to be holding the hand of his husband, his lover, who took care of him in ways he never imagined he deserved. “I love you,” Harry said faintly, and Draco squeezed his hand.
“I love you so much,” Draco said. “I love seeing you happy. I’d do anything for you.”
Draco pressed his lips selfishly to the new mark on Harry’s neck: it was the beginning of something
, Harry realized,
Harry hadn’t thought this through. He’d have to say everything, admit everything, and what if it wasn’t okay?
He wished he was chained inside the crate that he didn’t even have. Draco could watch Harry through the bars of the crate and mock him when he whimpered — he’d
. Open. your. eyes.”
“You didn’t say I couldn’t—” Harry burst out, quickly pulling his hand from his pants, and he desperately wished he had his Invisibility Cloak on hand. He, peculiarly, had forgotten how to breathe.
, Harry thought, and closed his eyes again.
Although he wasn’t in any right mind to realize it, most of the times when Harry heard Draco scold him with a name — like “you’re not being a good boy, are you?” or, in this case, “bad dog” — it jolted him into obedience. Harry didn’t like being bad, and there were very, very few exceptions. When he tried to be a brat — and he
It was ironic, to say the least: here he was, in his Auror uniform (well, just the undershirt), and one thing he’d always known he was good at was not breaking. He’d been able to throw off the Imperius Curse almost his whole life, he’d never cracked even after the Cruciatus, nothing….
He couldn’t think. He couldn’t. There was this incessant vibration inside him, and it was so close to where he wanted it, but one movement and Draco wouldn’t let him cum for two days.
Every time Draco sucked him off, it felt like the first time. Draco’s mouth was warm and his tongue was wet and it felt
Harry whined and strained against his bondage, wanting to touch Draco, wanting to pleasure him, and, more than anything else, wanting Draco’s cock in his mouth. His eyes raked over Draco’s body: dressed in some of the finest garments Galleons could buy, not a stitch out of place, and fully clothed except for his fly undone, Draco exuded power, authority, and nonchalant arousal; he watched Harry struggle, casually jerking himself off. Harry couldn’t stop reacting, moaning and panting as his eyes took in the way Draco languidly touched himself.
Harry stayed still, his breaths unsteady as Draco’s cock rubbed against his cunt again. “Please,” he said quietly, trying to decide what he wanted more — for Draco to touch Harry’s dick or to fuck him. It was an easy choice, it always was, even if Harry’s answer wasn’t in
“You’re so
The two of them had been dating for three months and getting handsy for the latter two of those three when Draco gave Harry his first hickey. They’d been making out on Draco’s bed and doing little more than sliding their hands up the other one’s shirt when Draco’s lips had moved lower; he’d begun to kiss and bite at Harry’s neck, which Harry rapidly learned was immensely enjoyable.
Harry made a sound in the back of his throat, and Draco’s hand slid down between Harry’s legs, fingers gently rubbing the outside of his cunt.
“You’re an Auror, there’s not a chance I’m leaving even the slightest possibility that something happens and you can’t take it off. But nobody else can except for the two of us. You have to know the spells.”
Draco knelt down in front of his chair, allowing Harry to be the taller for once, and looked him in the eye. “You okay?” he said, his fingers gently tracing shapes on Harry’s wrist.
It was almost Draco’s way of courting Harry, not that he had to. But it made things delightful for both of them, and it was a way for Draco to dote on Harry in an additional way that he, as Harry’s dom, enjoyed. Not to mention it gave them something else to do with all of the extra money they had.
He racked his mind for how to say it. “I want to be like a pet,” he mumbled. “A dog.”
“What,” Draco said casually, “you don’t want to stop?” And the way he said it made Harry want to fall to his knees for Draco and stay there forever.
“Look at me, baby.”
And not just any sex, but
he moaned (though it was unintelligible anyway), his hands searching to find a fistful of the sheets to grab onto, to anchor himself, because Draco was making waves that threatened to whisk Harry’s little boat away, to the edge of the world and farther.
“You’re dripping so much,” Draco said, his voice strained. “You always get so wet when I tell you how I want to knock you up, don’t you?”
“You want more?” Draco asked him, and Harry found himself nodding desperately before Draco had even finished speaking.
“I want it. Thank you.”
Which is why he was surprised upon noticing that Draco was allowing Harry to rub against his mouth. Had Harry been in any state of mind to explore this further, he would have come to the conclusion that Draco was trying to make him more comfortable — almost an apology for being too forward a few minutes prior.
Harry grinned as he read the note and examined the drawings, and with a flick of his wand he sent it to his bag to take home later, knowing he’d remember to ask Draco about the casserole when he saw the paper. He knew, too, that Molly wouldn’t be expecting a response, since her note was a response to Harry’s initial RSVP, so he felt no guilt as he picked up his quill again. And he’d barely had time to put a check mark by the first question on the first student’s exam before there was a rap on his door.
“No matter, though. I’ll just have to fill you up as many times as I can, so all my cum takes and you end up full with my child.”
going to get fucked. “Draco—”
“Yes, I
Harry loved it.
if he didn’t get filled up soon.
“Anything for you, love,” Draco said, pecked him on the nose, and turned to go. At the last second, with his hand on the doorknob, he waved his wand, and the papers he’d previously spelled into stacks flew back to Harry’s desk. Harry sat back at his desk with the papers from earlier and fished out the first exam.
Draco’s lips gently pressed against his, and Harry leaned up into him, grateful for the contact. He felt Draco’s fingers on his stomach and lower, until he was sighing when they gently dipped into his cunt. Harry opened his mouth when Draco’s tongue swept against his, and he let out a low moan as Draco withdrew his wet fingers and began softly rubbing them against Harry’s dick.
Whining, Harry forced his eyes open, his breath coming shakily. He saw Draco looking down at him, sternness and authority radiating off him.
“Do you want me to fuck you?” Draco asked calmly, picking up Harry’s leash again.
. Draco’s fingers stopped hooking inside him; now they straightened and moved slowly in and out of Harry’s cunt, providing little satisfaction.
“Of course,” Draco said, and he slowly stood up, leaving one of his hands still cupping Harry’s cheek. Harry gazed up at him. “What do you want to change?”
Draco how good he could be. But he was tied down, and Draco kept talking.
Harry wanted it so badly. He no longer cared whether he was allowed to talk — “Please,” he gasped, “please, fuck—”
“Worried about getting my nice trousers all wet?” Draco teased him, still holding Harry by the hair. “Perhaps worried about what my tailor will say when I go take these in for mending, when she sees the stain?”
, Harry thought, when Draco whispered something and it began to thrum inside him.
Harry moaned and bucked his hips as Draco’s mouth traveled lower. Draco pressed a palm against Harry’s pubic bone and pushed him back against the bed.
, not even touch you, it affects you so much.
“You look so good for me,” Draco continued. “I love telling you what I’m going to do with you, your responses are incredible. Even when I tie you down and just fucking
— “only wanted to
He could gradually hear Draco’s breathing become more labored; Draco didn’t usually
And Harry smiled. “Thank you,” he mumbled, and he meant it. His eyes wouldn’t seem to open. “Love you.”
“Oh,” Draco said delightedly, apparently having picked up on Harry’s hesitation, “is there something else you want too, puppy?”
Instead of answering, Draco kissed Harry again, and the pleasure returned, varying ever-so-slightly in levels of intensity as the kiss continued, fluid. Draco bit down on Harry’s lip and he moaned, unconsciously arching again to try to get
And from there, his brain had explored it further, and that was the first time Harry had the idea of being a pet: just a pretty, cute object for admiring, just a thing, just a toy. Something to be adored and doted on and played with, but not entrusted with anything. Something to be coddled and cuddled and paraded around. Something to have control over; to reward when it did well and punish when it didn’t.
Harry hated when Draco asked that. He knew that he didn’t really
“What about them?”
Draco helped Harry up so he was standing in front of him. “I can tell, sweetheart,” Draco said, and Harry felt overwhelmed with warmth and emotion as Draco pulled him into a heavy hug. He tucked his face into Draco’s shoulder.
Draco’s voice was soft and kind, drawing Harry in and grounding him. “Of course, love,” Draco said, running a soothing hand up and down Harry’s back. “What kinds of things?”
“Say it.”
Harry made a displeased noise when Draco pulled out a moment later, even though he’d known it was coming. Draco, on the other hand, hummed appraisingly.
“A few other little tricks that I shall keep hidden up my sleeve for the time being,” Draco said evenly, his warm smile filling Harry’s heart.
While fingering himself, Harry thought about his body, and how happy with it he was. He’d been on hormones for a year and a half when he’d gotten his chest surgery, and though he’d had very little bottom dysphoria before that point, what was left vanished. He had considered external lower surgeries, but decided that he liked what he had, mostly since sensation was variable after surgery. On occasion, he would wish for a larger penis, but then Draco would suck him off and say how cute his dick was, and Harry would be content for a while.
“You’re so gorgeous,” Draco said. “I love when you’re desperate and I get to hear all the pretty little noises you make.”
, the anxious part of Harry’s mind thought, but when Draco sucked hard on his dick once more, any other rational ideas he had were drowned out by pleasure. Harry bucked his hips again when Draco rubbed the outside of his cunt with two fingers, and he moaned when he felt those fingers slide into him. He was wet enough to ensure that there was no discomfort, and Harry could actually
“You’re close,” Draco said, panting, “I can feel your cunt getting tighter, damn. It feels so good when you cum on my cock, makes me want to own you even more.”
He had so many questions. Did something
“I told Cassie that it was a personal matter, and she said I could come right in,” Draco said, smirking at Harry, who was
“That doesn’t sound like me, I’d never say that—!”
“Muzzle, tug toys? Things like that?”
“I bet there’s still some of my cum inside you,” Draco said seductively and pleasantly, and Harry moaned. “Even if it didn’t work this time, I’ll be bound to impregnate you at some point.”
Harry was curled on his side next to Draco, naked, the smooth metal of the leash’s chain cold against his skin. The leash, clipped to a leather collar around Harry’s neck, stretched to the nearest bedpost. Draco was sitting up, propped on pillows against the headboard, his legs outstretched and an open book in his lap — some Muggle author (
Harry moaned when Draco’s fingers pushed into his mouth, and he was overwhelmed with the salty taste of how much Draco affected him.
“It’s okay, baby,” Draco said, no longer arrogant, but still in control as he always truly was. Harry thought Draco’s silver eyes saw into his soul.
“I could tie you to my bed with your legs up, I’d come and use you and fill you up whenever I wanted, you’d be so full of my cum. You were made for this.”
Draco’s tongue flicked him again. “Hm?”
He gasped when Draco moved again, rubbing against his dick while slowly grinding into him. Draco’s mouth made its way to Harry’s neck, and he started to gently suck a mark into Harry’s skin above the collar, in a spot a little ways below his ear that always drove him insane.

“C’mon, puppy, you’re too cute.”
more than anything else, and the intimacy of it all: Draco was
“You want to touch your little dick?” Draco teased, rocking into him. “Is that what you want?”
,” lol Draco said, the smirk audible in his voice. “You want me to fuck your mouth this time?”
“Such a good slut,” Draco said sweetly. “Even in your depraved little fantasies, all you can think about is me using you for my own pleasure.” When Harry moaned again, Draco smirked up at him and continued. “I know you like thinking about me using you and then leaving you there without letting you cum. Maybe sometime we’ll do that. I can get you a cute harness and a strap-on and make you watch while I fuck myself on you. Make you lick it up like a good boy when I cum all over you. Would you like that?”
Because the skin of Harry’s inner thighs was particularly sensitive, Draco’s kisses there always made Harry more desperate — Draco was content to take his time when in that position, but, as they both knew, Harry was prone to impatience.
.” He realized that he was trying to grind against Draco’s mouth, and then was surprised when he realized that Draco was
“...sorry.”
and Draco wrapped an arm firmly around Harry’s torso, mouthed at his neck above the collar, and began to thrust into him with quick, shallow motions. Harry made no move to touch himself — he was too worn out and sensitive from having just cum — but it still was good to be fucked.
if he didn’t.
He’d forgotten about the collar, only reminded when Draco tugged on it, pulling him farther into the kiss, and he gasped softly. Draco’s tongue slipped into Harry’s mouth, and Harry moaned quietly and began to idly touch himself once more.
Hermione had readily agreed. The implications in Draco’s words had hung heavily in the air. After hanging up a moment later, Draco had bitten Harry’s neck and told him what a good slut he was for staying still and quiet while he was talking to Hermione. Harry had moaned and whimpered and pleaded until Draco pushed him back and fucked him until his vision blurred.
“Yes,” he said begrudgingly, “it feels good.”
“Turn over. I want you to suck me off.”
irritated by the way he owned the room.
sign on his desk, he fell silent at the tone of Draco’s voice.
“That was incredible,” Harry said, out of breath and in that lovely, fuzzy state of mind where reality is pleasantly distorted — where nothing seems real, yet everything is overturned by the incredible realization that comes after good sex. The fireworks had fizzled out, but it was the kind of display that leaves an impression; the kind where you still think about the beauty, the colors, the lights, for hours afterwards and smile. “Merlin, you’re so fucking hot.” He sat up and propped himself up with his left hand, his right still between his legs.
He hoped that something like that wouldn’t happen now. There was no way he’d be able to focus on getting back to work if he hadn’t been allowed to cum — the submissive feeling would drive him crazy until he’d be squirming in his desk chair just to get some friction from his boxers.
Harry
He heard Draco hiss something while touching the collar. And suddenly the collar turned startlingly cold — it felt good against Harry’s hot skin — and he inhaled deeply through his nose, his eyes falling shut. He felt Draco’s palms slide up his chest, and arched his back, savoring the feeling of being touched and held. But the collar faded back to the perfect temperature almost as quickly as it had become ice-cold, and Harry blinked open his eyes as Draco crawled over him.

“Please,” Harry said, and he noticed that his voice sounded quite far away. “Please, it feels so good.”
“Fuck,” Harry mumbled, “fuck, wow.”
Harry realized he was trying to keep his mouth wide open even though the gag did it for him; he relaxed his jaw and let his tongue hang out of his mouth. Draco was watching him intently, and he smacked his cock against Harry’s tongue, tracing Harry’s lips with the head.
“Yeah?”

Such was an affirmation that Draco knew what he did to Harry. Draco
He felt Draco’s hand caress his hair, and smiled up at him — to the best of his ability, given that he still wore the gag.
would be the one. It was a Saturday; both men were off work and at home. Draco was shut up in his workroom, a fascinating space that was half-study and half-potions lab, busily testing out the woods he was using to make Mrs. Weasley’s new cutting boards. They were almost ready for carving, Harry had heard Draco say earlier that day; the woods just needed a few more potion tests before he could successfully determine which one was the most suitable. As for Harry himself, well, he hadn’t been able to get much done so far, even though it was nearly half past noon and he had nothing particularly heinous on his to-do list. He’d had four giant mugs of tea to try to curb his anxiety (and thus had gone to piss three times in the last seventy-five minutes) when he determined himself to confront his demons and be done with it. Hopefully, Harry thought, being in his element would give him more courage. So he went upstairs to his and Draco’s room, took off his shirt, and looked at himself in the full-length mirror.
Harry shuddered and did as he was ordered, planting himself on all fours. He felt Draco’s hands on his ass as soon as he did so, and he let his head hang quietly as Draco began to examine him. The leash hung similarly from his neck, the short chain meaning the handle loop rested fully on the bed, but only just.
“Sounds like you don’t mind too much, baby, huh?” Draco said, not bothering to wait for Harry to string together a coherent response, and slowly started to grind into him again.
to touch himself, but he still felt like he was floating, and Draco’s words were what grounded him. And so he contented himself with a disappointed whimper and nothing more, letting Draco guide his hand away.
before.
Draco actually laughed. “Can’t pay attention when I push you around, I shouldn’t have expected anything more. Would you rather I fuck you as you are, on your back, or I bend you over the desk and use you like that?”
He was hard, and he thought about how difficult it was to tell the difference from when he
“We both know that your only direct orders come from the Minister. And we both know that Hermione
other than dominant, rough, merciless Draco. He shuddered and opened his mouth, trying to find any words.
he moaned, barely remembering what the question was, wonderfully delirious with the pain that sent him deeper into submission.
“Yes,” Harry moaned, in spite of himself, unconsciously trying to move to rub his dick against Draco’s, “please.”
, Harry thought.
remembered how to breathe, and he let out a quiet sob. “I love you so much,” he whispered.
It always felt like that when Draco pushed into him; even more so when Draco would pull out just to tease Harry before moving back inside him to fuck him again. It felt good, it felt right, and there was very little that Harry loved more than having Draco fuck him. (Close competitors, of course, included getting head,
“You just want more sex,” Draco said, shaking his head in fond exasperation.
“I understand,” Draco said, and he slowly rose again. His eyes were soft as he looked at Harry and tapped the top of the desk. “C’mon, baby, hop up.”
“I know what you want,” Draco continued. “I know what you think about, and you’re going to tell me.”
They kissed quietly and gently for a moment, but as Draco’s afterglow began to fade, he began to take charge again: nipping Harry’s lip, kissing him harder, and smirking at him when they broke apart. Harry was breathing heavily, and he looked up at Draco, trying to prevent his desperation from showing on his face. Their lips were almost touching.
Harry laughed too and drank again from his glass; Draco refilled it silently without Harry having to ask.
Harry made a small noise and shook his head.
He felt Draco’s chest against his back, sticky from their sweat. Each time Draco thrust into him, his breath caught and he felt pleasure spark through him. And time felt foggy, but he knew that it was only about a minute before he was whining as Draco came in him.
whenever Harry tried to rub against something, and say, “You want my cock, puppy?” as he tossed a dildo into the crate. “Then show me. Let me see how much you need it. If you’re good I’ll consider fucking you.” Draco would look on, seeing Harry whine and desperately fuck himself on the toy in his hopes to please Draco enough to be rewarded.
Harry was getting dangerously close to being ready to cum, regardless of whether or not he had permission. It was an arousing experience in and of itself to ride Draco, and Harry had adjusted to make the angle even better so that Draco’s cock slid inside him wonderfully every time Harry lowered himself. But part of it was the way Draco spoke to him, and the things he said — they weren’t just in Harry’s mind anymore, and Draco liked them too.
Harry let out a hard breath and looked away, and he tugged at the tie binding him when he felt Draco begin to pull out — he wanted to grab Draco and pull him closer, preventing him from moving because it felt so
The feeling was just strong enough to make Harry moan with every breath he drew, but
“Dumb little slut,” Draco hissed, fucking him harder, and he took his fingers from Harry’s mouth, smeared the saliva onto his cheek, and scratched his nails roughly through Harry’s hair. “You look so good with your ass stretched around my cock. Touch your stupid little dick for me.” And finally Harry felt Draco let lax the leash, and he fell forward.
He came down harder from this than from his first orgasm, and noticed how sweaty he was as he gradually regained clarity. Harry felt the vibrator remain pressed against his dick until he was twitching from overstimulation, at which point Draco lowered the intensity slowly before turning it off. Draco curled his fingers a few more times in Harry’s cunt before withdrawing them; he then spelled the wetness away from his fingers and transfigured a glass, filling it halfway with a practiced
He lost track of time after that, happy to just be gently used, but it couldn’t have been longer than five more minutes before Draco was guiding him off his cock and coaxing him to sit up.
He couldn’t have heard Draco right. It
like he did when he was positioned like this and still had his cunt empty.
. “Yes, you do.”
Draco chuckled. “We thought you’d say that. But just in case.”
“It’s okay, baby, I’ll be right back. I just need to find a book.”
Harry shuddered, and, closing his eyes, leaned forward; he groaned when he felt Draco’s hand gently guide him onto his cock. Harry began on just the upper half of the shaft, hollowing his cheeks and letting his tongue wander to slicken up the cock in his mouth. He barely had to take extra care to cover his teeth: it was reflexive, at this point, with all the time he’d spent on his knees for Draco (and, only on a few rare occasions, other men. Draco wasn’t too fond of sharing). Harry began slowly bobbing his head, letting his saliva lubricate Draco’s cock, and he leaned further to take more into his mouth. He loved the sensations: the weight on his tongue, the subtle taste of pre-cum, and especially the way it pressed into his throat. He loved how, when his mouth was full like this, he felt as though he didn’t need to breathe. And, some of the time, he couldn’t.
Harry choked out a whine around Draco’s fingers and somehow became more aroused when he saw Draco smirk again.
Harry tried to bury his face in Draco’s shirt to hide, but Draco’s fingers curling in the hair at the nape of his neck prevented this. Harry groaned, his eyes shut tightly.
“Please,” Harry begged, “please, I need your cock so much. I
him, filling him — the idea that he could make Harry his even more by cumming inside him. That was what Harry loved about that specific, dauntingly appealing play that Draco had forced him to admit to wanting: it was, biologically speaking,
“What time is it?” And Harry watched as Draco shrugged his sleeve up and looked at his extremely expensive watch. Draco’d had it commissioned specifically; the face was bare except for a tiny black-diamond-inlaid dragon whose tail twined around the hind leg of a white-diamond stag.
“Your trousers,” he mumbled, glancing furtively at the dark spot on them.
“Do you want to say something?” Draco said, and he grinded once against Harry, giving a self-satisfied noise when Harry gasped and tilted his hips back in search of more contact. Harry just made another incoherent noise, trying to move to persuade Draco to put more pressure on his dick.
“Fuck, I- I—”
And Harry suddenly found himself on his back, his arms pinned above his head, with Draco between his legs. Draco’s cock had slid from him in the process, and he pressed his hips up, searching blindly to be filled again. Harry tried to sit up, but Draco pushed him down, hissed something inaudible, and Harry found his wrists secured above his head by something that felt like a necktie. He whined, opening his eyes for the first time in a while, and let himself adjust to the lighting in the room.
He wanted to be able to move, it being better when he was allowed to, but he still relished being held down. “Fuck,” he gasped, “please….” He brought his hands down, wanting to tangle his fingers in Draco’s hair; he felt Draco growl against him, and found his hands suddenly pinned by his head by invisible ropes. He whined as Draco licked up his cunt, his hips straining against Draco’s hold. He hated how empty he felt, but Draco’s mouth made up for it.
, more, please—”
They kissed; Harry felt the collar of his robes brush against the leather collar around his neck. What would people say if they noticed it? Cassie was sharp enough to notice and indiscreet enough to inquire, but incognizant enough to realize that she’d overstepped a boundary. Harry almost always wore the collar for at least a little while after his and Draco’s play (even at unrelated times) so as to not too drastically remove himself from his submissive headspace, but this situation did not necessarily present that as an option. But he didn’t want to take it off.
“Well, I was going to do a quick
“You’re gorgeous,” Draco said. On the edge of his tone floated reverence, like he still couldn’t believe he had the privilege of watching Harry cum, even after years of sex together. His hair was uncharacteristically messy, and it was endearing to see him like that, Harry thought, since the whole rest of the world only saw well-put-together Draco and nothing less.
Draco liked to go down on Harry — he was quite transparent about it, too. And Harry realized that this time, Draco wasn’t doing it for
He knew he was panting so much that his throat was dry, knew his legs were wrapped tightly around Draco’s shoulders in a way that couldn’t have been comfortable for the other man, and Harry tried to care but found himself too immersed in the pleasure that roared through his body. All he knew was this incredible high — he wasn’t aware of the fireworks themselves, but they were incredible, dancing and darting and crackling wondrously inside him.
He heard the fumbling, rustling sounds from behind him as Draco took off his clothes, and stayed silent, impatiently waiting for directions.
Draco continued fucking Harry while he came, his soft grunts in Harry’s ear. Both of them were breathing hard, and Draco nipped gently at Harry’s shoulder as his orgasm ended.
“What else?”
that?”
rather than the other way around. Draco seemed to take immense satisfaction in watching Harry confess something he desperately wanted yet also found intense embarrassment in admitting. Likely, Harry supposed, it was the extreme shifting of the scales in Draco’s favor that did it for both of them, especially Draco, who loved seeing Harry at his total mercy and wanting something that only
Harry moaned. “F-fuck, I don’t know, I—”
Harry lifted himself a little, and he had to bite his tongue to stay silent when he felt Draco push his cock inside him.
best interest as much as the other option. “Please fuck me,” he whimpered, “please, I want your cock so much, I can’t stand it. I hate feeling empty, please, sir.” He held his breath as the head of Draco’s cock slid against his swollen crura, his wetness making the movement easy.
He let his mind drift further, and he could think of nothing more than their current states: his nakedness, vulnerability, desperation; Draco’s arousal, though completely hidden, and his domineering demeanor. Harry thought of how Draco was reading something for a book club that he and Hermione had started together. He thought of how he might as well not be there at all — he was allowed to neither speak nor move, and he was only there for Draco’s amusement. They did this on occasion: Draco busy responding to owls or finalizing an abstract or something of the sort, with Harry nearby, on display, just a pet. Sometimes Harry would be under a desk with Draco’s cock in his mouth while the latter worked. Sometimes he’d be curled on Draco’s lap, forced to sit still and ignore the cock filling him, while Draco read the news or even, on occasion, spoke on his mobile with a friend or colleague.
“Yes,” Harry said. He often forgot that Draco wanted verbal affirmation when Harry was stressed. “Thank you.”
“I’m...nervous.”
When Draco said that, Harry believed him. All he wanted was to belong to him. He’d known for a long time that inhibitions were lowered during sex, and he could see why: even if he was
Draco was still touching him, still with difficulty given their position, and Harry tentatively pushed a hand between his legs and felt Draco’s hand there; Draco moved it aside and laid his arm on the bed, and Harry took over the act of touching himself. Draco smiled radiantly at him, and Harry smiled back and kissed him quickly before tilting his head back again, allowing himself to just
sounds.
Draco reached forward, around Harry’s head, and forced two fingers into his mouth, hooking into his cheek and pulling his head back. “I thought I told you to be quiet,” he said coldly, and Harry moaned around Draco’s fingers but he stopped struggling, even as Draco pressed farther into him.
He felt the pleasant dizziness of being choked, and it was so easy to lose himself in the man above him. The silver eyes stared through him, and even if Harry wanted to, he couldn’t look away. Being Draco’s was all he was.
Harry’d only escaped by blushingly coming up with the excuse that he’d gotten into a scuffle at work a few days prior and simply forgotten about the bruise — Draco had smirked at Harry from behind Hermione’s back, and they both knew that she didn’t believe him, but she seemed placated and moved on.
“I’m hard again,” Harry mumbled into the kiss, running his fingers between his legs and over his dick. It was swollen and he could feel it pulse a little bit whenever his cunt clenched.
. Dressed-up, as usual (though Draco would likely claim it was merely casual), with his perfect hair and perfect eyes and perfect
“What a good boy,” Draco praised him. And Harry revelled in his touch no longer than five seconds more before Draco moved his hand back and slipped his soaked fingers into Harry’s mouth. Harry groaned and licked them clean, and when he was done, Draco took them from his mouth; he braced that hand on Harry’s hip, slowly pulling out of him.
“I want to kiss you,” he managed, shy for reasons he couldn’t put his finger on, and Draco smiled dazzlingly and crawled up Harry’s body to do just that.
“Why?”
know you well enough to think that you set that deadline for yourself.”
Harry quickly tried to swallow the saliva that had built up in his mouth, and he let out a hard, shaky breath when Draco pulled his hair, forcing his head up and to the side. Draco quickly bit Harry’s ear, and whispered to him, “You’re so pretty for me. Just lying here like a dumb little puppy while I use your holes.” He thrust into Harry especially hard and Harry whimpered; Draco tightened his grip on Harry’s hair until Harry could feel his scalp burning, and he made another desperate noise. He felt Draco’s hot breath on his ear: “Get on top of me,” Draco breathed, and he pulled out of Harry and lay back against the pillow.
on the inside in Draco’s neat handwriting. It had been five days since Draco had given it to him while he was at work, Harry reflected, and Draco had revealed not one of the “little tricks up his sleeve” that he’d admitted the collar possessed. Harry liked to muse about what such tricks may be. Could the collar hurt him when he disobeyed? constrict his breathing? At the very least, Harry suspected that the metal could morph and grow chains that could snake down and wrap around his wrists, or something of the like. It would be predictable of Draco to request such a function for the collar, since Draco favored convenience — convenience, of course, being Draco’s ability to control his submissive in the simplest ways that didn’t require excessive use of props or time. And there was little Harry could think of that could be more
Draco’s left hand held him by the hair, but his right brushed over Harry’s ear and then lower to the hickey on his neck, tracing it possessively. Harry badly wanted to touch his dick again, to slowly rub the sides of it and stroke himself until he was as hard as he could be. He knew he probably wouldn’t be able to cum again right away, realistically, but the desire was still there, just as strong as if he hadn’t cum a few moments previously.
“This is a lot,” Harry admitted quietly.
. He’d tried to get her to send a memo if something was urgent, or tell him when he left at the end of the day if it was trivial, but she seemed to fear that the message wouldn’t find him or that she’d forget to mention it, so he often found himself interrupted by her when, really, the matter could have waited. He took a breath and dipped his quill, hoping that whatever she had to say wouldn’t take long. “I have to grade these, and you know the Minister’s been up my ass all week about the—”
They said nothing for a moment, until Harry mumbled, “Thank you,” and smiled up at Draco. He was already itching for round two, but knew that the likelihood of getting another orgasm under his belt was rather slim — it always took more effort the second time around, and he was exhausted — so he tried to ignore the feeling of Draco still inside him.
Forced to stay in the same position, Harry could only take shuddering breaths while Draco’s index and middle fingers found his tongue. There was nothing Harry could do to stop him, of course, for the gag kept his mouth open and his tongue visible for Draco to do with it what he pleased. Harry moved his tongue reflexively when he felt Draco’s fingertips touch it, and he sat still as fingers explored the inside of his mouth, rubbing against his tongue and his inner cheeks. He twitched when Draco touched the roof of his mouth, which was oddly ticklish, and put on his best scowl when Draco laughed.
“What is it, Harry?”
“You’ll feel so good, please, and I’ll do whatever you say.” He slowed until he was no longer rubbing against Draco, his breath coming shakily. “Please, I...I’ve been a good boy.”
sucking someone off, and even much more so when it was Draco. His mouth watered.
like there was unbearable aching inside him that needed pressure and fullness to go away, Harry was
Draco’s eyes were soft. “Yes.”
“Is there a question in there?”
Harry blinked his eyes open to look at Draco, and his fingers slowed to a stop. “I like my body,” he murmured happily.
Harry couldn’t help the sound he made in the back of his throat, and he whimpered when Draco’s wet fingers found his mouth. He stuck out his tongue and cleaned them.
Harry moaned and bit the inside of his cheek in his effort to hold still as Draco moved in and out of him. Draco was watching him intently, Harry noticed, searching his face as if he wanted to burn the image into his mind.
Harry whined as he felt Draco’s tongue on his skin, and he let himself be held down and subdued. “It’s high up,” he said halfheartedly, and involuntarily bucked his hips to shift Draco’s cock inside him.
“Do you like it?”
of the time — Draco was rather persuasive. When they first got together, when there was so much discussion and comforting one another, those things he admitted were mostly about his childhood, which so few people knew the truth of. And as they became closer, the conversations were about stress and how Harry was so

not to mention that the position they were in — Harry thought it was called the
He cut himself off with a moan when Draco bit down on his neck, hips stuttering, and Harry whined as Draco came inside him. He couldn’t feel it, despite wishing he could, but Harry loved this moment nonetheless: the sharp pain as Draco’s teeth dug into his skin; the way Draco, for a brief moment, lost himself in Harry’s body; and that blissed-out feeling from knowing that he had pleased Draco. Harry loved all of it. He realized that he was whimpering almost inaudibly, and he let himself close his eyes.
“You heard me.”
“Stay,” Harry wheedled. He wandlessly spelled his fingers clean, cupped Draco’s face in his hands, and kissed him hard; wrapping his legs around his husband’s waist (and trying to ignore the pleasant shifting of Draco’s cock, still inside him), Harry leaned back, causing Draco to topple off balance and fall over him, forced to brace his palms on the desk to catch himself.
“You’re so pretty,” Draco said, and he slowly began to jerk off again, still resting his cock on Harry’s tongue. “You always look adorable when you look at me like this. I like getting to see your pretty eyes.”
The kiss was intoxicating: Draco dominated it, unsurprisingly, starting slowly before beginning to kiss Harry with more greed and vigor. Harry felt vulnerable — in these moments, his soul always opened wide and let Draco in, and that was how their sex worked so well.
The glorious sting of Draco’s palm against his ass pushed Harry through his climax, and he heard himself moaning more loudly than he thought was decent as he moved himself down on Draco’s cock one more time. His hand had become almost numb from touching himself, but he desperately he tried to keep going, so Draco pushed Harry’s hand aside and started to rub his dick — it was far from perfect, but it prolonged Harry’s orgasm for long enough that he started to squirm from the hypersensitivity.
Maybe that was wishful thinking. Maybe that was just Harry trying to tell himself that Draco would grant his desires at
“Look at that, baby,” Draco had said huskily into Harry’s ear, having already discovered Harry’s affinity for possessive nicknames. He wrapped an arm around Harry’s torso and began rubbing Harry’s dick through his underwear. “Look,
“Open your eyes.”
He wasn’t sure where the little bit of brattiness had come from — the reluctance to submit again, specifically — but it almost always made submission better when Draco forced his hand. Almost hoping that Draco would stop him, Harry slid a hand between his legs and slowly began to jerk himself off, taking his small dick between his forefinger and thumb and tugging at it. Draco, who of course noticed everything, acknowledged by gripping Harry’s hair more firmly and thrusting into his throat. Harry gagged but acclimated quickly, his throat tightening around Draco’s cock.
Harry gasped when Draco allowed him air, and continued to touch himself, wanting to get filled again.
— he also liked when Draco would just lie back and lazily watch while Harry desperately rode him. This was of course one of those occasions. Draco’s eyes remained fixed on Harry, but every once in a while he’d casually touch, too: he’d tweak one of Harry’s nipples or knead his ass, just to see Harry’s reaction and play with what belonged to him.
He knew Draco was watching him appreciatively, and felt oddly empowered by how much he knew that he was turning Draco on. Harry’s eyes were closed, and he felt Draco reach behind him; he expected Draco to grope him, and made a surprised, pained noise when he was spanked instead.
, Harry thought, without any bitterness, as Draco guided him down with a hand still in his hair. He felt pressure on his neck, and realized that he was being held in place both by Draco’s hand and the taut leash.
Draco worked in Diagon Alley, in a small store where they made and sold custom, made-to-order potions and spellwork.
“Tell me why,” Draco said, and he slid his hands up Harry’s torso and began to lightly trace circles around his nipples, carefully avoiding them. “Pros and cons of each.”
In the meantime, what do you think of the story so far? What did you think of *the realisation* and *the gay panic*? As a self-proclaimed expert on the topic, I'm interested in hearing your thoughts. (I just love writing people realising they're gay, alright? It's a weakness.)

AHHH! What just happened? What does it mean? It's all a haze but we'll be figuring things out soon.
Like I said, chapter 9 will be the final one, and 10 will be the epilogue. That's why next weekend the posting schedule will be a bit different: I will be posting chapter 9 on Saturday and the epilogue on Sunday. Subscribe to the story if you don't wanna miss the updates!
Thank you to everyone who's been reading and enjoying this story, leaving kudos and comments. It means the world to me. This little project has been in the works for ages and I'm so happy to finally be posting it. The positive response gives me the courage to keep making stories :)
There it is! Draco made it. He became a famous dancer and his personal life is fulfilling and balanced. He and Harry didn't end up together, and that's okay. They taught each other what they had to and then moved on. I'm sure they'll sometimes meet in Sirius-related events, and the atmosphere between them will be friendly, albeit the tiniest bit awkward.
Thanks for reading and I'll see you next week :D
My goodness, I completely forgot it was Sunday yesterday! It's been a little harder to keep track of days with all the quarantine stuff. Here's a short chapter for today, please enjoy!

Please enjoy today's chapter! I'll see you at the end notes!
P.S. if you don't know what I'm referring to by "that Christmas night at Grimmauld Place," feel free to read a previous work in this series called "Off The Tapestry." I'm sure you can imagine what it's about.

Perhaps you don't care about my story, but I do put a bit of myself into the things that I write. It sounds deeper than it really is when I say it like that, but it's true. If you've read my Tonks/Fleur fic, I wrote about Tonks' sexuality as well as her relationship with her mother in a way that reflects my own life. In this story I write about Draco and his love of the stage, as well as his father's disapproval, inspired by my own experiences.
Another Sunday, another chapter... I really hope you like this one! I'm sure you've been expecting it for a while now. Please enjoy!

I was tempted to write a full-on discovering Hogwarts chapter but that's really not the focus of the story. The Muggle version of Hogwarts that we have come up with is simply a posh boarding school. I did however attempt to give a bit of context regarding the teachers and the subjects.
Those of you who were waiting and waiting for the Drarry fluff (and light smut), here it is at last! I hope you liked this last chapter - it's one of my favourites. I would talk a bit more at length about finishing this fic and what it means to me, but I'll save the sappy monologue for tomorrow, when I will be posting the epilogue. Keep an eye out for that, and have a nice Saturday!
Also, if you've been waiting and waiting for the Drarry action, don't worry. I haven't forgotten about it. In fact, the next few chapters will be much more focused on that aspect, so get excited for that!
Have a nice Sunday and I'll see you next week with another quite special chapter!
Also, I haven't asked so far but I would love to know: how are you finding my portrayal of Remus (and the mentions of Sirius) in this story? I assume some of you have come from The Boys of Summer initially, and I'm curious to hear how you expected them to grow up and just your thoughts on them. If, on the other hand, you're reading this as a standalone piece, I would obviously recommend that you check out TBoS, and I would love to know what you think as well!

That said, please enjoy this new chapter. It's one of my favourites :)
You know how I love writing family drama, but here's some unproblematic family fluff for a change. I have always perceived Narcissa as an unconditionally loving mother first and foremost, and the dialogue between her and Draco was the first thing I ever wrote down for this fic (back when I didn't even think I'd be able to finish it). I wanted Draco to have this support from his family, which Sirius didn't have. In my perception, Lucius also genuinely loves his son despite certain flaws - some people have a different idea of him and that's alright, but at the end of the day I see him as a strict yet caring father. And of course setting this scene in the south of France was a fun touch, something to spice up the narrative. All in all, I'm really happy with the outcome - what did you think of this chapter?
This chapter was a little short but I hope you enjoyed it nonetheless! Please leave me a comment and tell me what you think of this story! See you next week :)

Hey guys! I'm back with the penultimate chapter! (Chapter 9 will be the final one, and 10 will be a sort of epilogue.) Please enjoy!
I'll see you next week with another chapter. xx
I started writing this fic God knows how long ago - back then I didn't think I'd finish it. My friend @todaslasmadrugadas patiently listened to me whine about how hard it was to write. And yet here I am, posting this epilogue that I'm lowkey proud of. Much like Draco, I am content.
Ah! Draco met Sirius! Were you guys expecting this to happen? Writing this part required some delicate handling, at least for me. But I'm happy with how it turned out! I think a presence like Sirius is something missing from Draco's life. He represents the idea that sometimes people can go their own way, stray from the predetermined path, and still be happy. What are your thoughts on them meeting?
What did you think of this first chapter? Leave me a comment and share your thoughts!

P.s. I mentioned Snape a couple times in this fic and I wanted to say that his story has also been rewritten into this AU... In fact, I recently wrote a oneshot about him that I'm really fond of. Would anyone be interested in reading that? Or has tumblr completely ruined Snape for you?
What do you think of these new developments? Draco is dancing again! I, for one, am very happy for him. I've actually drawn from my own experience in theatre; I was in my school's theatre department as a kid but then gave up on it because I couldn't see a future for myself on stage. After a five year hiatus, I got back to it as an adult and I was in my first real play last year!
At last, the final chapter! Please enjoy :)
Like I said, a bit short but I have come to accept my own inability to write long chapters :') I just want to split scenes up neatly into little sections! Next week's chapter is going to be longer though, so stay tuned for that!
Either way, thanks again for reading this story. If you liked it please leave a kudos and consider writing me a comment. I'd love to have a chat about anything you like.
I'm sorry this was so short! I kinda suck at planning chapter lengths :) but I still think it gets the point across the way I intended. What did you think of it? My friend said it was a reversal of traditional roles, with Harry being the "immature" one here. It wasn't intentional but I'm very okay with it. After all, the concepts of these fics are a bit experimental.
If you want to contribute anything about these topics or any thoughts in general, feel free to leave me a comment! I love reading what you guys have to say about my fics. Take care and I'll see you next Sunday with some more good stuff ;)
Hello everyone and happy Sunday! Here's a new chapter which holds a special place in my heart. It was one of the first ideas we had about this story and I'm so happy it made it into the final cut. Please enjoy and I'll see you at the end notes.
I hope you guys have been enjoying reading this story as much as I enjoyed writing it and sharing it! I usually write short stories or novellas, so this one is my longest baby :)

Hi again! I hope the time jump wasn't too abrupt or jarring. I did it as intentionally as possible but still feel a little weird about it. Then again, this is when the real plot begins and I didn't want to delay it any longer.
Tomorrow marks a year that this fanfiction was last updated, I really am sorry that it took this long for me to update the story, but the las year wasn't easy. Fortunately no one I knew got sick, but my mental health took a swan dive of a roof because of quarantine and I didn't feel like writing. I really am sorry, I could at least have told you that I was taking a break.
-	I do not wish to criticize the way things have been run in this school,’ she said interrupting Dean. - But you have been exposed to some very irresponsible wizards in this class, very irresponsible indeed – not to mention extremely dangerous half-breeds.
-	I’m fine, just thinking about something. – He responded dryly.
-	Thank you, Harry! And thank you for trying to make Umbridge understand, I’m sorry that you got detention I know it’s partially my fault. If I had just kept my mouth shut you would have to serve detention with that demon. I’m so sorry! – The girl said with a sad tone.
Gasps were heard all over the class when Harry finished his sentence, the only exception being the teacher that was now smiling at him like she was expecting him to bringing up the matter of Voldemort.
-	We’re not going to use magic? - Ron exclaimed loudly.
-	It was murder! - said Harry. - Voldemort killed him and you know it.
-	You can speak to snakes? I didn´t know that. It’s a really rare gift! – Sirius said in amazement.
(See the end of the chapter for
-	Yes, I do. I discovered a few years ago that I had the ability to speak with snakes, but since then I hadn’t had the chance of speaking with one. – responded Harry.
“It’s good to see that we are not alone in our hatred for her. Yesterday morning we were in the common room talking and I swear to you that some of the seventh years were making some plan to make her disappear from the face of the Earth. They were really worried about their grades. If the seventh years don’t think they can make it, how in the name of Merlin will we, we have O.W.L’s this year.” Harry said in an exasperated voice. “God, I do really sound like you. No offense.”
The ride was short and after it both of them headed to the Great Hall to have dinner. Only when he saw the tables yet to be filled with food he remembered that he didn’t have lunch and was hungry. He headed for the Gryffindor table and sat down far away from Hermione and Ron. He needed time to think and so did they. He turned to the doors when they open to see the first years entering the Hall, all the same expression of wonder he had when he first entered the Hall.
“Evening, Professor Umbridge.” He said in a scowl.
It was around 11 AM when Petunia left Harry in front of the Leaky Cauldron, ordering him to be ready to be picked up at 5 PM sharp or he would be left behind. Harry straightened the green beanie he had on his head so that it would cover his forehead and his scar. He never liked his fame and having his scar showing was like a magnet for others to came and say something to him. With his beanie he felt like he almost invisible and he liked that.
-	Yes, Miss Granger? You wanted to ask something else?
-	Boy, today Dudley is going to spend the day with his friends and I’m going shopping with the lady’s from the book club. Seeing as you haven’t purchased your school material, yet, I’m giving you permission to go to that horrible place so that I don’t have to spend the entire day preoccupied if the house is going to be destroyed by the time that I get back - the women said in her high pitched voice - Get started on Dudley’s breakfast that I’m going to wake him up. And you still have to finish all your chores before you are allowed to leave the house.
Something you said to Padfoot worried me a little bit. He told me that you sent letters that were never received and that you didn’t receive letters at all, I find that very strange, but I want you to know that I believe in you. You have no reason to lie about something like that and Padfoot said you looked pretty upset about the matter. What really worried me and Padfoot is the fact that you reacted and stated that being with the Dursley’s was something you would never choose voluntarily. I really want to know if everything is alright with you being in their house. For the little your mother told me your aunt isn’t the best person to be around when you are a magical being, for that reason me and Sirius never really meet her. We are really worried, so please when you have the time answer to this letter. If something really is wrong with you staying in their house then we will try everything in our power to get you out of that house.
He left the room and when he had turned left at the end of the corridor and no longer felt like he was being watched, he sprinted the fastest he could, away from that office. If that was the punishment reserved for everyone whose opinions were contrary to hers, he would be the spitting image of an angel in her class, he didn´t need to be physically punished like that at Hogwarts too. The Dursley’s were enough. He finally took a look at his clock and saw that it was almost midnight. He shouldn’t be out and about at this time of the night, but thanks to the toad he had missed dinner and he was a bit hungry, so he decided to go to the kitchen and ask the elves for something to eat. He sneaked around since he had neither the map nor the cape with him and after almost twenty minutes later he arrived at the portrait and tickled the pear that allowed him to enter the kitchen.
-	Dumbledore said you sent him a letter saying you wanted to stay with the Dursley’s this summer and that you wanted to be left alone so we left you alone, there’s no need for you to be screaming at us for a decision you made. Dumbledore said it would be best to do what you wanted, that way you could heal at your own pace. – Ron responded this time looking angry.
Another thing of importance that we believe you need to know before it comes out in the newspaper is that we are trying to clear Padfoot name. We did some digging and found out that he didn’t have an actual real trial, he was simply seen in Godric Hollows the night your parents died and after was the supposed only survivor of the attack to the muggles so he was simply blamed and shoved in Azkaban before he had a change to actually prove he was innocent. We are trying to get a retrial and the paper work is already in progress. If he gets his name clear he will finally be able to stop hiding and you will be able to spend more time with us during the holidays.
1st of September of 1995,
Surprisingly it was a dreamless sleep.
The entire class followed the order and started reading. Harry hoped that this class would end soon, because he felt like he was going to fell asleep any second now of how bored he was. What saved him were the pokes Pansy was giving him whenever she saw his head start falling. What finally woke Harry up was when the teacher finally gave Hermione authorization to speak.
8th September 1995
The speech Draco gives Harry is based on the speech given to one that was sorted in Slytherin in the Wizarding World site.
After that the mirror returned to looking like a mirror and reflecting Harry’s face. He stayed looking at the shard for a while, before tucking it in his pocket. Harry looked to his watch, it marked 16: 26 PM, the train was almost at Hogsmead, so he headed back to the compartment Hermione and Ron were to get his robes and let right away without looking or talking to his friends.
-	This leads to the first and most important rule of the house, if you have any problem with any of us you wait until you are inside the common room to discuss it. You never, under any circumstance, do it outside. The Slytherin house is a house that stands united in front of any adversity even if you hate the person besides you. Unlike the others we stand together until the end, one thing that you must have in mind is that we will never turn on you now that you are a snake. Most of us don’t like you and probably won’t start liking you just because you’re here now, but you can rest assure that you will never be attacked by any of us, if anyone wants to settle some matter and can’t do it with a conversation they will most likely challenge you to a duel.
“I wasn’t felling alright last night and went to the Infirmary to be checked out and Madame Pomfrey decided that it was better if I stayed the night in case the pain got worse, but I’m felling much better now. You don’t have to worry about me.” Draco said in a small voice giving him a smile.
Just like the title says.
I think that I will start to upload on Thursdays, since I have my Wednesday evening and afternoon free, but I can't promise anything.
“You won’t need any ink to write with this quill, Mister.” She said with a creepy grin on her face. She looked like she wanted to smile, but taught it would give something away.
-	So you’re telling me that I’m being forced to be nice to you outside the common room, even after everything that happen between us during 4 years, and that I have to have another Slytherin student with me at all times? – Harry asked in a slightly annoyed tone.
-	Hand, Mr. Thomas! As I was saying, you have been introduced to spells that have been complex, inappropriate to your age group and potentially lethal. You have been frightened into believing that you are likely to meet Dark attacks every other day –
I decided to make him have only one detention, because I don't want it to be repetitive and I don't think he needs any more detentions.
-	Well then, I’m afraid you are not qualified to decide what the “whole point” of any class is. – The teacher started saying after interrupting Hermione. - Wizards much older and cleverer than you have devised our new program of study. You will be learning about defensive spells in a secure, risk-free way –
-	Please don’t tell anyone what you read in that letter! I can’t create more problems for them that the ones they already have. You have to promise me you won’t tell anyone what you read in that letter, please, promise me you won’t do it! – Harry said very quickly in a pleading and anxious tone with tears in his eyes.
Since the beginning of the sentence “We have a matter to attend”, Harry somehow knew that this was about him and only wanted form the floor to open and swallow him whole, he was sure the Headmaster didn’t need to announce this in front of the whole school. Awkwardly and without looking at anyone, Harry got up and headed to the stool. McGonagall picked the hat up and signaled for him to sit on the stool, placing the hat in his head after he sat down.
Thank you very much to all the people that read, bookmarked and left kudos.
-	Second rule you have to have in mind is that in any circumstance you are allowed to walk the corridors alone, now that you are a fifth year and have more knowledge in defending yourself you are allowed in groups of minimum 3 people, and if you see by any chase anyone with a silver and green uniform being attacked you help them if they need even if they don’t ask for help. We have too many students ending up in the infirmary every week, because they were attacked, so this rule was created. And this year is most important that this rule is followed, because we with the rumors about the Dark Lord being back we will be in the spot light more than ever, which means more attacks than ever even if most students don’t actually believe his back. For others we will always be guilty even if it’s by association. Everyone in this house knows the rumors are true, as you must have guessed, and know that we believe in you. Now that you are a snake we here to help you in any way you need. Third rule is an obvious one, anything you want to do that is against the rules you can do as long as you don’t get caught. If you are caught by any teacher that isn’t professor Snape you will lose points and suffer the detention said teacher gives you and you will serve another one given by Snape that will make you regret being caught in the first place. These are the house rules you have to follow, you do it and everything will go smoothly for you. Now some information that you need to know. The password changes every fortnight in Mondays and is always in the announce board for only one day so don’t forget to go see what it is when you leave for class in the morning. The Quidditch tryouts are in two weeks in case you want to join the team and this tear we are going to have to talk with the teachers about our future carriers so that they can help us better determine what subjects we should choose for next year N.E.W.T.S. Now that you are up to date, do you have any question or can we go down to meet the others and have breakfast.
-	Ten points from Slytherin, Mr. Potter. - Umbridge said with obvious pleasure - Now, let me make a few things quite plain. You have been told that a certain Dark wizard has returned from the dead –
Slowly and rather numbly, Harry stood up and willed his body in the direction of the Slytherin table. As he made his way there the colors of his uniform started to change from the usual red and gold to the green and silver of his new house. When he arrived at his new table the only place left for him was between Malfoy and a brown haired girl, so without another choice he sat down.
-	I have two actually. And who cares if it’s against the school rules as long as I don’t get caught I don’t have to worry about anything. And if you try and tell you will have to prove it and that would be rather hard. The teachers would most likely think that you were trying to get me into detention or in trouble and wouldn’t even believe in you. – stated Harry, while he showed Onyx. – And don’t worry I’m not going to tell anyone that you were crying like a baby.
“Good evening, Mister Potter.” The pink toad said to him.
After putting everything in its place Harry told the little snakes to not worry about the cloak and to try and make no noise if they heard anyone pass in the hall or open the door, because the people he lived with didn’t like snakes and would throw them out if they were ever found. They promised to be careful. Then Harry went down stair to make dinner. After dinner he was obliged to clean the kitchen and when everything was squeaky clean he was allowed to go to bed.
The food appeared in front of Harry and he served himself of some, remaining quiet during the entire meal. Around him people talked and sometimes would glance at him, but never once a word was spoken in his direction. He would sometimes sneak little bits of the meat he was eating to the snakes that were still in his capes pockets. He definitely needed to get a better way of transporting them around. When the meal was finished it was now time for the actual speech the Headmaster gave every year.
-	 Not about the chapter, no! -  said Hermione.
-	Professor Umbridge asked me to bring you this. – He said extending his hand with the note on it to professor Snape.
After the tears had dried and Harry was calmer he remembered the gift Remus had given him, so he took it out of his pocket and started unwrapping it. Inside the box were a note and a piece of a mirror not bigger than the palm of his hand.  Harry opened the note and read it out loud to his snakes.
It took him an hour to finish taking care of the garden, since he was constantly distracted by his snakes exploring and the constant questions they made. When he was finished he whistled for Hedwig to come back and picked up his snakes and went inside to get ready. He took a shower and changed his clothes since they were sweaty and the organized everything he needed inside his trunk.
Harry hugged him one more time and headed to the train to look for his friends. He put the little wrapped box in his jeans pocket. He would read it when he got to the booth. He found them in the 3 compartment in the middle carriage. He entered the compartment and sited in the opposite side from his friends. He carefully took out the things in his bag and put them in the shelf above the sits. He sat down and stared absently out the window while caressing both his snakes heads thinking about what Remus had just told him. It took him a while to notice that Hermione was calling him.
-	If you mean Professor Lupin, - Dean started saying angrily - he was the best we ever –
“Dobby, can you do me a favor?” Dobby nodded. “I was hurt during detention and I need something to stop the bleeding and to help close the wound and maybe some bandages. Could you please go get me something without being noticed or caught, please? I don’t want to explain how I got hurt to the teachers.”
Breakfast, the first class, that this year was taught by a women named Wilhelmina Grubbly-Plank instead of Hagrid and lunch all went perfectly well. Now was time to have a lesson with the pink demon.  At 2 o’clock all students were already inside the classroom. This class was one that they shared with the Gryffindor students. Professor Umbridge was already waiting for them and when the last student sat down she started speaking.
Malfoy stopped for a few seconds to regain his breath, since he had spoken without a pause and it didn’t look like he was nowhere near the end of the speech.
That sentence made Malfoy look to his lap and actually notice that what he had just moved was a small snake.
I didn't say in the last chapter because I forgot, but all the characters and places used in the story belong to J. K. Rolling, obviously.
About the other question you made about the Dursley’s, your suspicions are correct. I can tell you the truth but is a conversation that I believe should be had face to face. All I can say is that the Dursley’s never saw me as family, but more as a slave. I really hope that both of you are able to do something, because Dumbledore knows and he never did anything to help and I know he has the power to help. He is one of the greatest wizard ever existed and you tell me he doesn’t have the power to help. I don’t buy that. The Weasley’s also know, but I can’t really blame them for not doing something, because they have already too many mouths to feed and not much money. And they help when they have me in their home for half the summer. When you and Padfoot have  the time, please come to Hogsmead so that I can see you and talk to you.
-	Your hand is not up, Mr. Thomas! -  Almost screamed Professor Umbridge. - Now, it is the view of the Ministry that a theoretical knowledge will be more than sufficient to get you through your examination, which, after all, is what school is all about. And your name is?
Harry didn’t like where this conversation was going. He may not be talking to them, but he still considered them his friends and he wouldn’t let the old women just treat them like what they were saying was a stupid thing that didn’t deserve any attention. So he decided it was his turn to speak, with or without being called.
In the night of the 31st of August, Harry went to bed happier and more anxious them ever. The next day he would get to finally see his friends that he didn’t know if they were his friends anymore, after all they didn’t write a thing to him the entire summer. Not even Sirius or Remus had sent him a letter. Not even on his birthday had he received a card from anyone. Not even after he had been officially expelled from Hogwarts and it had been in the front page of The Prophet, not even when he had to face the Wizengamot and had been considered innocent and been accepted in Hogwarts again had he received a note asking if he was fine or telling him that everything was alright with them. Nothing at all was what he received even after sending them letters after letters wanting to know if everything was alright.
-	Well, he turned out to be a maniac, didn’t he? - said Dean hotly. - Mind you, we still learned loads.
-	Yes! - Said Hermione. - Surely the whole point of Defense Against the Dark Arts is to practice defensive spells?’
With this the pink women finally shut up and sat down and after Dumbledore thanked her for her “illuminating speech” all students were dismissed to return to their common room, Harry followed the flow of green and silver to his new common room. It hadn’t changed a thing since he had been there in his second year. Since he was technically a fifth year student, no one forced him to stay and listen to the speech the prefects gave when the first years arrived to the common.
He spent a few more minutes talking with the snakes before looking at the clock and seeing he had only 20 minutes before the combined hour to meeting his aunt. Harry was saying his goodbye to the snakes when he looked at the 2 snakes that had caught his attention in the first place, they looked sad that he was already leaving. Harry taught about promising that he would visit, but truly thinking about that he knew that the next time he would visit was the next summer vacations and by then his pretty snakes may already have been sold, so he did what every crazy person would do. He called the shop worker and told him he wanted to buy the 2 snakes. The man looked at him lake he had lost his mind and asked him if he was sure. Harry said yes. 10 minutes later Harry left the shop with the snacks and the stand for Hedwig plus 2 sunbeam snakes, as the shop worker had called them, and a huge terrarium for both his pretty snakes and a load of food for them, plus a book on how to take care of snakes. Everything besides his snakes was shrunken and in the bag he had with him and had a very useful feather light charm was placed on the terrarium otherwise he wouldn’t be able to carry everything with him. One of the snakes was hidden in the front pocket of his hoodie while the other was around the boys neck under the hoodie, otherwise they could be seen by aunt Petunia and she would freak over them, since she didn’t like any kind of animal that was a cat or a dog, because those where the normal pets people should have.
-	Using defensive spells? - Professor Umbridge asked liked that was the dumbest question anyone could ask. – Why? I can’t imagine any situation arising in my classroom that would require you to use a defensive spell, Miss Granger. You surely aren’t expecting to be attacked during class?
When they arrived Harry was given 5 minutes to guard his materials in his trunk and the he had to start doing dinner because uncle Vernon would be home any minute now and he didn’t like having to wait long for his meals. In his room, Harry rapidly opened the trunk and threw his books inside without much care and took out his invisibility cloak. After closing the trunk Harry took the terrarium out of the bag and put it on top of the trunk and next out his snakes inside the terrarium and covered it with his cloak. That way if any of his relatives entered his room none of them would notice the huge glass box with 2 snakes inside unless they tried to open the trunk.
The other boy agreed and both walked together to the Slytherin common room, where they found the other kids occupying one of the tables already doing the homework they had for Transfiguration. Not wanting to be left alone, Harry decided to join them and do his homework. When only 10 minutes were left for 7 PM all the kids got up and left the common room to go get dinner.  After dinner they all returned to their dorms and stayed chatting for a while and Harry was surprised by the fact that all the other kids in the group tried to include him in the conversation. After a while all the kids decided that it was time to go to bed so they all got up and headed to their respective bedrooms. Harry slept really well that night.
-	Dean Thomas.
“Finally, a relatively smart choice. By the way, how did the detention go? What did you had to do?” Hermione said a little bit proud of his choice of not chasing after a trouble for once. “Had to write lines. It wasn’t really all that pleasant. If one day you need to go to her office, protect your eyes, it’s so pink it will blind you.” Harry said in a series tone.
-	Are those snakes? Since when do you have snakes? – Sirius asked with a surprised face.
-	I need to think a bit more, but I’m aware that we need to talk. Can you please give me until the weekend? – Harry asked her and received a nod as confirmation.
-	There is nothing waiting out there, Mr. Potter.
With this sentence Harry more than a 4 dozen eyes looking at him and the next second at least half of the snakes were asking him things at the same time making him not understand a thing.
-	No, but –
“I would like very much to be a part of the study group. It is a very good idea, and we all know we need something like it if we are going to pass this year. Umbridge is complete garbage when it comes to teaching. We only had one class and we can see that already.” The blonde said “It’s getting late and it’s almost dinner time, we should head inside. While you were talking, I sent an origami message to Blaise and the rest of the gang and they should be here any minute, Harry do you mind going first. I would like to talk the Granger before I lose courage.” Harry looked at the blondes face and all he saw was determination so, even though he didn’t know what the conversation was about he decided to comply and go on ahead.
-	Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn’t it? - Professor Umbridge said looking at the students. - The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L. year. You will be pleased to know, however, that these problems are now to be rectified. We will be following a carefully structured, theory-centered, Ministry-approved course of defensive magic this year. Copy down the following, please.
Half an hour later, Harry was inside the Knight Bus headed towards King Cross Station. He was extremely relieved when the bus arrived and he was able to get off. Even though he was early there were already a lot of people in the platform 9¾. Among them were the Weasley’s plus Hermione and Remus. Harry headed their way, being spotted first by Remus that opened his arms for him wanting a hug. He accepted and very carefully as not to harm his snakes returned the hug. After that all the Weasley’s and Hermione turned their attention to Harry asking how his summer had been.
When he finished the letter he left the library and went to the Owlery to sent Hedwig with the letter. It took him a few minutes to get there and before he sent the letter the boy had a one sided conversation with his snowy owl. He hadn’t seen her in a while and he missed her. After the owl took flight, the boy left the tower and went to dinner. All the other Slytherins were already at the table and when they saw him, started asking where he had been and telling him to never walk alone again. Harry explained after then they resumed their conversation that mostly consisted of them bad mouthing Professor Umbridge, which was a conversation he joined gladly. After dinner they went to their dorm and while the other kids talked Harry forced himself to do homework.
-	As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions. - said Professor Umbridge dismissively.
-	Did you really not read a word of what it said? – Harry asked now more calm but still a bit anxious and the blonde nodded.
When he was almost over eating the owls started showing up with some mail. Surprisingly, a blackish brown owl with white facial markings and yellow eyes landed in front of him with a letter for him. Harry took the letter and tried giving some bacon to the owl, but the bird started pecking at his eggs instead. In the front of the envelope his name was written in a letter he recognized as belonging to Remus. He was scared for a second, thinking for some reason Remus was writing him so soon. He was waiting for the end of the of the week to right to him and Sirius telling them about his first week and because he was slightly scared to tell them that he had changed houses and ended up in Slytherin. Harry slowly opened the letter.
But Potter just replied, “Everything’s handled, thanks,” beginning to close the door.
“He wasn’t a great guy, either--”
“But you were angry, when you first saw me. And I made you angry this morning, too. I dared you to hurt me, and you didn’t even reach for your wand. Why not?”
I accidentally uploaded this chapter without editing it, so here it is again. It's a long one cause I needed a distraction, hopefully you enjoy loves <3
Malfoy leaned back against the counter, ran a shaky finger over the abrasions. “They haven’t. Those chains were...not ordinary. I don’t think they’ll heal at all, on their own.” He looked up at Harry. “And I swear, Potter, please don’t start with your nurse routine again.”
Potter shrugged. “Nothing, really. Trouble’s over, now. I guess. Until you showed up.”
Potter removed his sock slowly, and then pulled his wand out even slower, and whispered,
“Mrs. Weasley knits me jumpers for Christmas sometimes, though.” Potter wore a fond smile. “Can’t say they’re fashionable, but...they’re probably my favorite thing I own.”
Harry considered. There was a dangerous look in Malfoy’s eyes, and Harry could sense that whatever he said, he was walking into a fight. “I don’t know you,” he said finally. “Not as well as I’d like to.”
“Only you would take it as one,” Draco said, scoffing. “You just look exhausted.”
“Sorry,” he muttered, “Watch me cock it up, after all this…”
Draco jumped back in alarm. It took him a moment to recognize the creature as a house-elf, the giant, hairy ears tipping him off.
Harry froze, staring at him. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to...sorry.” Draco had seemed more comfortable, even allowing Harry to raise a wand at him today. Harry hadn’t seen him flinch that badly in awhile.
That had been Harry’s opinion, as well, from what little he’d known of them. “Would you want to try and track Goyle down? Might be nice, to see a familiar face.”
While Draco was still dwelling on these less than comforting thoughts, Potter came back around the corner. His bangs were a little wet, glasses a little askew, and he’d put on some hideous gray Muggle jumper.
I'm thinking about renaming it after a different song actually, cause the tone has ended up being a lot lighter than I expected (sometimes you don't know until you start writing what kind of flavor a story's going to have) So if this story suddenly ends up being called just what I needed, that’s why lol
“What’s on your mind?” Potter asked, through a mouthful of toast.
“Probably should.” Malfoy sounded wary.
Malfoy let out a long breath, leaned his head back against the couch cushions, although his arms stayed raised. Slowly, slowly, he lowered them. “What the hell, Potter.”
He found them, tucked under a book on curses he’d been reading last night, and scrambled up from the floor.
Hermione nodded. “Yes, of course, but she can’t accept a floo call on her own, so you’ll have to wait until I get home tonight, I’m sorry. I only barely snuck away from the Ministry for this long.”
...Draco felt a shiver of self-disgust run down his spine, imagining what he would say.
It's been a long time since I've read these books, so apologies for any errors.
“Thank you,” Draco said, sincerely. It was a small comfort, knowing Ron shared Hermione’s sentiments about his mother. He could feel Ron staring at him, and looked up.
Harry dropped the hand. “Don’t, uh, don’t mention it.”
Corbyn had cocked his head to the side, like a crow regarding a dead mouse.
The Auror punched Malfoy in the face and shoved him to his knees on the dry leaves covering Harry’s doormat. “When you get back to Azkaban, we’re going to have a little talk about your continuing attitude problem.”
“That little performance back there, trying to get a rise out of me. Why’d you do that?”
“We’re not flat mates, Potter,” Malfoy scoffed. “I’m your prisoner, remember? So go on then. Threaten me.”
“Whatever you’re going to say next, Draco, I’m not going to send you back to that hell. Honest.”
“Yeah. Eventually, it started happening while I was awake.” Harry smiled ruefully, looking back at Draco. “Never was very good at Occlumency.”
But he suspected, to Ron Weasley, they were more than just pretty words.

Draco tugged the door open—it stuck, and hurt his arm...he was pretty sure that elbow was sprained, but that was a problem for another day—and descended the chilly, cement steps down to the basement. It was filthy, cluttered with crates and tapestries and a disturbing number of taxidermied house elf heads, all hung with cobwebs and coated with dust. Draco began to pick his way through the piles of junk--tapestries, old dish-ware, objects that most certainly looked cursed--when he heard it.
“Believe me, after everything that happened to me as a teenager, I started to miss the broom cupboard.”
Finally, as always, please leave a comment if you have any thoughts, even if it's a criticism or a correction. I live for feedback on my work and I can't tell you how happy they make me.
Harry leaned forward, trying to see what he was looking at. He didn’t think there was anything
“Don’t pretend like you care, Potter,” Malfoy muttered, and bit into the sandwich, chewing carefully.
something.”
“You’re on thin ice, Malfoy,” Harry said, knowing he was being wound up but unable to ignore it.
They drank their coffee in silence for a long time, and then just sat, until blue light began to filter in through the basement window above them. Potter looked down at his watch, and swore. “It’s morning.”
Some fresh blood trickled down Draco’s upper lip into his mouth, and he tried to reach up to wipe it away, only succeeding in yanking on his raw wrist in the manacles. His hands were chained behind his back, and to his neck and feet. He could barely walk, let alone reach his face. Or raise an arm to defend himself.
The things Draco had said about himself were haunting Harry’s mind. The remarks about wanting to die, about being weak, pathetic, about deserving the things that had happened to him.
Potter was sitting behind the desk, looking through the notes Draco had taken last night. They were sparse, Draco had to admit, more ranting than information. Whatever the curse was, exactly, it seemed like something the Ministry itself had come up with.
“Kreacher does not know him, this is Kreacher’s part of the house, Master should not have let him come here--”
“I don’t think he meant to ignore you,” Draco continued. “I think he just assumes everyone’s better off without him.”
Malfoy tucked the last of the sandwich into his mouth, brushed his hands off. “You didn’t read any of those documents, did you?” he asked, through a mouthful of bread.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy smirked. “Thin ice…What happens when it cracks, I wonder?”
Draco’s gaze settled on him as Potter shuffled through parchments, teeth sunk into his lower lip in concentration, fingers rising every once in a while to push his glasses back up his nose. Draco found himself captivated--and it wasn’t merely by the spectacle of a Gryffindor trying to read. It was something in Potter’s brilliant green eyes as they flickered over Draco’s neat, back-slanted cursive, something in the way his lips occasionally moved, reading a spell, something in the way he tousled his hair every now and again in pure absentmindedness, only ever succeeding in making it messier.
Draco shook his head, pulling his hand away. Potter’s own hand flew to his mouth in shock. Draco realized belatedly that he’d uncovered the top of the marks on his chest. He dropped his knees, folded his legs, let Potter see the rest. He didn’t even care what Potter said about it, at this point. He’d been alone with his guilt for too long. And if Potter wanted to berate him for what he was, Draco couldn’t help but feel he had it coming.
“They tried to contact you, over and over again, but apparently they had about as much luck as I have the past few years…”
Harry rose, cursing himself for an idiot—Malfoy must be thirsty—and got down a glass to fill it from the tap. He pushed it into Malfoy’s shaking fingers.
This is my first time trying to go *this* in depth into someone having a flashback/panic attack/paranoid thoughts, they say "write what you know" but damn this was still hard. I don't know what helps other people, but for me, listing all the facts I know is one of my favorite grounding routines, so that's what I had Harry do. It really depends on the person, I think, but I feel like that would help Draco, too.
indeed.
Potter nodded back and raised his wand, even slower this time, to point it at Draco’s wrist.
He remembered the genuine concern in Potter’s eyes, the hand extended to help him off the floor, the gentle, righting touch on his shoulder. It gave Draco a strange, choked feeling in his throat, like he was thirsty for something that wasn’t water.
“Could I at least…fix your nose? I know a spell.” This time, at least, he remembered to state his intentions before pulling out his wand and sticking it in Malfoy’s face.
“Fine. Apology accepted. But honestly, I’m not going to lose any sleep over some Black family knick-knacks.” Potter rose to get a glass of water from the tap, but when he turned back around, he stopped short. “Draco, you’re bleeding.”
Draco sat up, grimacing as all his injuries burned at once, and took a sip. It scalded his tongue slightly, but it just tasted like sweet coffee. He set the mug down on the table by his head.
“I already have custody of Narcissa. And they won’t let family members be placed together.”
“Alright, alright, I’ll stop playing nurse.” As Potter made to sit back down again, they heard a shout from upstairs.
He could tell Draco was in his own hand-made hell inside his head. And every time Harry tried to comfort him, or give him advice, he felt like he was stumbling around, struggling to perform brain surgery in the dark.
It's been almost a decade since I've read the books, so if I start to go off canon a tiny bit, just do me a favor and ignore it, lol. It's the way I interpreted it when I read it, I guess, and if memory serves, Rowling leaves a lot open to interpretation, especially regarding Harry and Draco's relationship and Draco's feelings.
Potter hadn’t moved, but his face suddenly felt very close.
Sorry this took me a little longer than I expected to post, I rewrote a lot of it. It ended up being the longest chapter yet though, so hopefully you enjoy!
“Nothing, I just…” Harry shoved his hands into his pockets. “I was just worried, that’s all.”
Harry considered. “Well, we still don’t know each other that well. But...I meant what I said.”
“...And so anyway, they gave me the paperwork and asked me to track you down. And I knew you’d refuse, but…” Now it was Hermione’s turn to look guilty. “Draco Malfoy had just come across my desk, and I...well, he was just a kid when he committed his crimes, Harry. I still remembered his little eleven-year-old face underneath the sorting hat, I still remembered how scared and hollow he’d looked at Malfoy Manor, I still remembered how he hadn’t identified us, and I just...I couldn’t let him get hurt.”
he said, spitting out the other man’s name the way he used to in school.
unspoken this time.
“That doesn’t do any good, you know,” Harry said softly. “Being sorry.”
he gritted out, cutting Potter off.
“Probably should have turned a light on, at some point,” he muttered, and then began to whisper the same combination of spells and incantations he’d used on Draco’s wrists and ankles.
Malfoy turned, looking as tense as he could manage to be with how exhausted he clearly was. He looked like he was ready to drop.
“Yes,” Harry admitted.
he corrected himself. Although they might as well be on first name terms, at this point, it still felt too strange, calling his old rival Harry.
Harry wet his lips. “Um, I guess…”
Draco had looked a little reluctant, when he’d headed for the stairs to his room after they’d finished eating. But when Harry had invited Draco to join him for a drink, he’d simply shaken his head. Harry had at least insisted on cleaning the glass from his room, and after a few protestations that he was the one who made the mess in the first place, Draco had let him.
Harry took a bite. They were amazing, perfectly fluffy and golden brown. “Better than mine, I have to admit.”
Draco was crying harder now, staring at the fire. He let the tears roll down his face, his hands in his lap.
Harry shook his head. “Malfoy...you didn’t need to do all this, you know…”
“Just my clumsy attempt at...basic human decency.”
Harry rose and took the stairs to the kitchen. He came back with a glass of water, and handed it over to Draco.
Potter smiled back, and reached up to hook his pinkie finger with Draco’s. “Pinkie promise.”
Malfoy’s smirking smile had turned a little sad.
“Your concern is heartwarming,” Potter replied sarcastically, stepping between them. Corbyn was still a head taller, but Draco felt a little comforted by the action. It reminded him, at least, that Corbyn couldn’t get at him anymore.
Anyway, thanks for reading, hope you enjoy <3
“And if I showed up on your doorstep five years later,” Harry asked, “Looking like I’d been to hell and back? What would you do then?”
The day before he’d left Azkaban found its way into the forefront of his mind. He remembered his aching wrists chained to the wall above him, remembered the door of his cell opening, the sinking feeling in his stomach as he recognized Corbyn.
Hermione was opening her mouth to speak, but Harry cut her off. “Not by my choice, I mean, it sort of was, but that was only cause he, basically, double-dog-dared me too, and it seemed like he didn’t want to go back to Azkaban, which he apparently doesn’t--”
A small, smirking smile appeared on Draco’s face for a moment. “They’d probably ask what chewed me up and spat me back out again.”
Two and two finally clicked in Harry’s mind. He’d offended Malfoy, perhaps even deeply worried him, by asking about Narcissa, and now Malfoy was getting a rise out of him, again. He’d forgotten how manipulative Malfoy could be.
“Watching something awful happen, Draco...that’s not your fault.”
“Did you want to have a seat?” Harry asked, glancing at the kitchen table.
Thanks to everyone who left comments on the last one! You guys are so nice and really encouraging me to keep writing. Thank you, sincerely.
He craned his neck to look back, unable to spot anything in the dark. “Kreacher?”
Harry wet his lips, took a slow, careful breath. “I hated you in school. Because you always seemed like you enjoyed putting other people down, making them miserable. But when you became a Death Eater, that was the first time I started to feel something
“That’s not an answer.”
Harry winced. “Like you drank poison?” That was how the nightmares made him feel, like there was something inexplicably bitter in the back of his throat, a wretched, choked feeling, making him weak in the knees and hollow, right between his lungs.
They were standing face to face now. Draco stared at the raised wand and then into his jailer’s eyes, blood running cold. Those eyes were just as brilliant and green as he remembered. And whatever Potter wanted to do to him, it was about to begin.
pretty disgusting, covered in blood and sweat and dirt...and they smelled…
Potter looked up at the hand for a moment, eyes widening. Then he clasped it, and allowed Draco to haul him to his feet.
But before Harry could continue, Malfoy straightened up and offered him a familiar smirk that made
“Successfully?”
Draco took another bite of food to get rid of the taste, chewed for a very, very long time, and managed to swallow it. “So…” he began cautiously, wondering if he should perhaps let the subject lie altogether, but needing to steady his nerves. “Are you angry, Potter? About earlier?”
Draco sighed. “Fine. Let’s have some coffee.”
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, choked up. He was unsettled by the realization that he knew how Corbyn had felt in that moment, recognized it. All those years of war, all the deaths, all the losses, that desire to take it out on someone else, to make them feel even a fraction of the pain they’d caused. But he’d learned, quickly, that revenge didn’t get rid of it, only made it worse. He wasn’t sure there was a way to get rid of that bitter, poisonous feeling. He’d hoped time would make it fade, but it was still there, sleeping, in his guts.
Draco supposed the Chosen One still hadn’t managed to work a wizard heater. He was raised by Muggles, after all. The thought didn’t bring much amusement with it. Potter owned a bloody house. And Draco owned nothing. And now, Potter as good as owned
“Yeah.”
Hermione looked between them. “Do I want to know what you two got up to?”
He tried to focus on the voice, let it guide him, but the panic had its fingers around his throat, and as hard as he tried he couldn’t breathe. The voice seemed to get further away, as if Potter was onshore and Draco was sinking, deeper and deeper underwater. He could feel himself shaking, chest aching, throat closing.
“How’s the bull-ogg-nah?” Harry asked, trying to relieve a little of the tension.
So much a n g s t in this one. Harry has been repressing his issues for a long time in this fic, and Draco is still trying to figure out how to be a friend, so it's kind of slow going.
“Draco did some reading,” Potter said. “He gathered it was related to the curse on house elves, too, but he reckons the ministry tampered with it.”
“Why don’t you talk about the Muggles who raised you?”
but at this moment, all he had was Harry.
“Who’s that?” Draco was baffled as to where this could possibly be going.
Draco stared down at the marks on his wrist, considering. “Don’t raise your wand at me again without my permission,” he said, knowing he was asking for too much.
Malfoy inclined his head to her again. “Thank you, Hermione.”
This chapter is like 99% fluff, and I'm not even sorry. I blame the fact that I was listening to Sweet Tooth by Cavetown while writing it. (My ADHD ass can't write without music on repeat in the background)
Malfoy looked at him for a long time, his eyes sharp. “Why would you want to help me?” he asked finally.
Draco felt his cheeks warming again, wondering if he’d said something to that effect. He couldn’t remember.
“I’m sorry. It must have shaken you up, seeing him again.”
“Why the hell do you care?”
Malfoy held up his arm to indicate the runes on his wrist. “Take a wild guess.”
him break the curse, instead of being furious. He’d fully expected to be sent back to Azkaban. He’d half expected to be chained up in the basement, and in the darkest corner of his mind, he’d expected the pain to begin. But no, Harry Potter the Savior of Wizardkind had decided to help him, instead.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I like to think I’m decent at it.”
“You didn’t, by any chance...I mean, I would understand if you did, I guess, but…”
been curious, yesterday. “Last night, I was all the way passed out, after drinking that much, wasn’t I?”
“Staying in the house all day, drinking all the time, none of that helps.”
Draco shook his head, dropped it into his hands. “It’s not you. Like I said, you’ve been...absurdly nice.”
Once he climbed the stairs, the couch began to look very inviting, so he laid down, still wearing his prison clothes and Potter’s jumper over them. He should return it, he realized, and it was his last thought before he drifted off to sleep.
Draco belatedly thought better of bringing that particular encounter up, given that their roles were reversed. More than reversed. Potter had been stuck for as long as the
Maybe Draco was some kind of pity project for the savior of wizardkind. Perhaps Potter was even getting paid to take care of him. It made sense that the Ministry would want the Chosen One publicly on board with their new program. But then why the act with the Aurors, trying to turn him away? Why the speech about how wrong it all was, how Draco didn’t deserve it?
Draco could feel tears prickling hot against the backs of his eyes, and shoved his hands into them. He didn’t deserve to cry. It was too late for guilt now. He could hate himself as much as he liked, it wouldn’t change the past. It wouldn’t bring Corbyn’s wife back from the dead, or anyone else.
Every time Harry studied Malfoy, he saw some new injury that made his stomach turn. Malfoy’s torn shirt had slipped off one shoulder, and Harry could see half-healed cuts on his chest, along with heavy bruises and abraded skin on his neck.
“Ah, I see. The idea of having Draco Malfoy as your personal prisoner sounded fine and dandy on paper, but now that you’re looking me in the eyes, you’re getting cold feet.”
Draco’s mother nodded, blinking rapidly. Draco knew she was trying to stop from crying.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s awful,” Harry said, shocked by Malfoy’s quick dismissal of his own suffering. He remembered what it felt like to be locked away and starving. He pushed the memories down again. “You couldn’t have slept much, either.”
“I suppose I’ll postpone slitting my wrists, then,” Draco shot back, as he walked to the bathroom. Squinting into the dusty mirror, he began pulling strands of hair away from his head and cutting. The scissors were a little rusty, but they did the job.
Slowly, he remembered why, as last night faded back into focus.
Harry looked away. “Touché.”
“It’s my day off.” Ron shrugged. “Besides, look who’s talking.”
“Is that so?” Draco shot his new captor a glare of bald hate.
But he felt accomplished, and he had to admit, it was nice to feel something other than shame or fear.
for him. The broken nose had seemed the easiest place to start. But it was Malfoy’s face, and if he’d rather keep it bloody and broken than have Harry waving a wand at him, Harry couldn’t exactly blame him.
It also came out super long, sorry about that. I'd been keeping the chapter lengths consistent and then there's this monster.
“It’s fine, it’s not like I was your best mate or anything--”
“Draco...” he heard Potter say, distantly.
“Harry!” Hermione practically shouted, finally managing to interrupt him.
The elf considered for a moment, uncharacteristically silent. “Kreacher would like to see the chains.”
was the one responsible for Malfoy’s current condition.
to be treated like garbage. Even if you did deserve everything that happened to you, it’s pointless, anyway. It’s not going to change anything, and it’s never going to make you a better person. It’s never going to make the world less of a hellhole.”
Harry ran a hand through his hair. “Tipsy,” he admitted.
He stepped into the bathroom to rinse his stinging, swollen knuckles under the tap. Punching the walls repeatedly with his bare hands had been a particularly stupid move, but he’d been too angry to stop. Angry at himself, his father, his life, angry at nothing.
“I was talking about the Auror, actually,” said Harry. “But now that you mention it, yeah, I am a little bitter about you stomping on my face.”
(See the end of the chapter for

The heavyset Auror punched Malfoy in the gut, hard.
Potter hesitated, and finally shook his head. “Alright, fine. They were awful.” He looked back up at Draco. “Now can we stop throwing a pity party about my sad excuse for a childhood?”
“I know, I know, but I couldn’t stop it before it started, so I’m doing my best from the inside out, placing prisoners in the best environments I can, gathering evidence that the whole thing is a loathsome, money-grubbing sham.”
That was one word for it, Draco thought, poking a piece of burnt meat with a fork.
Draco was going to have to ask Potter about him, when he got back. And find some way to research the runes. At the moment, however, his biggest problems were a foul-smelling slime clog and a razor-sharp snapped fan blade.
Malfoy turned back around to flip the pancakes. The pan looked heavy in his battered wrist. “He wasn’t, technically. The Aurors are allowed to use force, but only for self-defense, and ‘whatever is necessary to contain the prisoners.’” Malfoy shook the other pan, glancing back at Harry. “A definition that is, as you might have guessed, purposefully vague. And the supervision was...well, let’s just say, insufficient.”
Draco wondered if Potter was actually suspicious, or if he was just trying to deflect again from their earlier conversation. Draco was certainly not going to tell him the truth, that he’d been looking for information on the runes. Not that he’d found any.
Harry stood, and Malfoy, to his credit, didn’t react. He simply looked up at Harry, one eyebrow raised.
Oof, sorry about the downer ending. As promised though, we're finally getting deeper into the Harry angst.
“That’s a dark way to see the world.”
He remembered Malfoy’s rather troubling remark, about Harry being able to do anything he wanted. It would be incredibly violating, he realized, his hand falling back to his side. And so, despite his curiosity, he laid a blanket over Draco, instead, and lay down on the floor beside him to drink himself to sleep.
“I don’t know what this mess is, but it’s nothing I want anything to do with.” He began to shut the door, but the other Auror, this one heavyset and ginger, stuck his foot into the doorjamb.
-	That’s the problem, I never sent any letter saying that I wanted to be left alone. After everything the Dursley’s have done to me, so why would I want to stay there for the summer? Dumbledore knows that, Hermione and Ron know that even the Weasley’s know that so why did they believe in that letter that I supposedly wrote. Since I started Hogwarts, every summer the Weasley’s find a way to have me in their house for at least half the summer and last year, that happens to have been the worst of them all, I have to endure the Dursley’s the entire summer where is the logic in that. – Harry said exalted.
-	Don’t worry, I didn’t read a word. I wanted to talk to you because I taught that me hugging you had made you uncomfortable. I’m usually touchy with my friends and even though you are definitely not my friend yet and I don’t like you that much, I imagine how hard it must be for you to suddenly change houses and end up in the house you like the least, so I’m trying to be friendly with you to avoid future altercations. So I’m sorry if I disturbed you in any way this morning with the hug and the petting your hair thing. – The other boy said in an apologetic way.
Unfortunately, Monday arrived which meant that he was forced to get out of bed and go to the Great Hall to get breakfast with the rest of the kids. Harry open the curtains and got up, going to his trunk and taking out his uniform, then headed to the bathroom to take a shower. Besides him, 3 other boys were already using the cabin showers, which meant Harry, had to wait for one of them to leave. The first one of boys to leave the cabin shower was Malfoy, that upon seeing Harry informed him if that they needed to have a talk after he was ready and leaving immediately after not giving him a chance to answer. Harry occupied the cabin. It took 20 minutes for him to shower and get dressed still inside the cabin. The last thing Harry needed was for the other boys to see the multiple scars he had in his body. He didn’t need their pity.
“For about 2 weeks now, I bought them when went to Diagon Alley to buy my school material. The one with the white spot is Opal and the complete dark one is Onyx. Aren’t they pretty?” Harry said picking them up and showing them to her, hoping with would distract her from his wrist. It didn’t work, since when he picked Opal up and was showing her to the girl, his sleeve went down and showed the top of the bandage he had maid last night. “What happened?” the girl said in a worried tone.
Harry raised his arm to at the same time Hermione did it. The teacher ignored him and gave her a turn to ask what she wanted first.
“A gift Snuffles gave me. It allows me to talk to him and Remus on the spot, like a phone call except we can see each other.” Harry said taking the small shard of his pocket and passing it to the girl. “In the beginning of our conversation you said you had an idea about the DADA. What was that about?”
Harry stayed silent until Opal slithered down his leg to go and explore and try to calm the new thing in the room, Malfoy that now was silently sobbing with tears down is face . He tried to tell her to come back, that she shouldn’t bother strangers, the only response he received was silence. Malfoy was distracted enough that he didn’t even feel the snake climbing his leg to get to the seat.
-	Hmm, let’s think - Said Harry in a mock thoughtful voice. - Maybe … Lord Voldemort?
“Dear Remus and Padfoot,
