.          "Just one. We sit next to each other."
He shuddered and felt nausea kicking in. Draco swallowed a bit of bile and ran over to his sink quickly. While he splashed the cool water onto his sweaty face, he grabbed the bottle of Adderall on the counter next to the sink. He took a few of the pills and balanced himself on the counter.
“Okay, Xavier, would you like to make the shots or the martinis?” he asked Xavier, nearly sighing out of relief. It seemed that the rest of the night would be easy.
Sorry it's so late! I've been sorta depressed lately, and the news about Chester Bennington didn't help.This chapter is kinda short because tomorrow I plan on releasing a much longer chapter. Thank you for your patience!! <3
He went back to the bathroom mirror to look at himself again. The robes he had on were relatively new and elegant,—a deep red velvet with some blacker undertones—but they were also wrinkly and had obviously been slept in. It wasn’t his fault. He’d been taken off the Ambien and that messed up his sleeping schedule. Harry grabbed his comb and wet it, attempting to get his hair to stay down. He strongly considered buying some of the Sleekeazy’s Hair Potion that Hermione used sometimes, but he didn’t see the use. Did anyone really care about his messy hair? He sighed and set the comb down.
"It's…hard for me to be in the wizarding world."
.          "Oh, how delightful! Do you talk any?" She perked up a bit.
“Harry, it is perfectly normal to have freaked out,” his therapist assured him, “What concerns me is that our breathing exercises didn’t seem to help. Why do you think that is?”
“Well, my probation requires me to stay in the country. I do get the occasional exceptions to visit my mother, of course.”
The trainees watched as the first group went through. It took Dean ten minutes to defeat the course, and Seamus defeated it roughly two minutes after Dean. The next group took about twenty minutes, as neither had successfully warded off the Expelliarmus at the beginning.
“But that sounds like a lot of work.”
The room was quiet for a minute or two. Finally, Andromeda broke the silence, “Did you find anything at the library?”
“Thank you! And enjoy your day.”
Harry sighed, “And with the war…”
Harry watched the bright red bird, then asked, “Are they even natural around here?”
She replied, “No problem. He doesn’t mean harm; he’s just grumpy and hates it when things are out of order. He and his wife moved here from the Dominican Republic in the ‘70s. She died a few years ago, so he’s, y’know, been alone…”
“Have you had any non-approved magical contraband on your person?”
After he finished, he walked to his next class, English 101. It seemed a little bit silly, he figured, going to English class when you speak the language. But this would be an easy A.
“Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine. I’m great. Just thinking. Y’know, thinking,” he replied. She stopped walking and simply just stared at him. He cursed himself for not stopping after the first “yeah.”
expressive person—especially when complaining. He couldn’t help but laugh.
Draco laughed.
Harry gently sieved the flour into the large mixing bowl, combining it with the sugar, eggs, and butter. Teddy’s party was tomorrow, and Harry was put in charge of the food and dining. This was going to be a celebration for Teddy’s 2nd birthday. Andromeda and Harry threw a small party for his 1st, but feelings of grief and guilt had overshadowed the fun. Thus, Harry had promised himself that this birthday would be unforgettable—or at least as unforgettable for a two-year-old as possible; he had to make cakes and cookies and juice and two different dinners: some Kid Cuisine Twist and Twirl Spaghetti for Teddy (the only thing he would eat at this point) and some muggle sushi rolls for the adults.
They sat in silence for a few minutes. It was odd because they hadn't had any truly awkward moments with each other in a month.
“Oh!” he realized, “she’s your-”
"That's awesome," Harry said. And it was. He was glad that everyone had begun to heal.
this morning that they were done with dorms.”
"Oh."
“Oh, well…” Narcissa drew her shoulders back.
Their professor addressed the room, “Hello, class! Please take your seats. We will begin now.” Draco suppressed a groan while Potter sat down. Potter, on the other hand, appeared to have no self-control; he let out a loud groan and slammed his head against the table. He brought his head back up, feigning embarrassment. Many of the people sitting around them turned their heads to look at them. Some even shot Potter dirty looks. Draco was
Draco made kissy noises at them and walked out the front door. He shut it quickly, assuring that they wouldn’t attempt to follow him out. In shame, Draco walked to the nearest store that would sell him two liters of Smirnoff with minimal questions asked.
thought, so when Bella said something…intense…I didn’t know how to disagree. When we were all at Hogwarts, we were all in Slytherin, and thus it was easier for us to fall into the myth of blood purity. I believed it for a long time, but then I met Ted. Ted was also a Slytherin and he was marvelous. He refused to put up with any crap. I had begun to question my family’s values before I met him, but he really changed everything.”
, Harry,” Draco said. “If we get stuck in this and die, I will annoy the
. [I. Don’t. Want. Toooooooo.]”
[I am marvelous now. You look handsome.]”
Draco swallowed. He didn’t want to hear this story anymore.
"If you don't mind me asking, who is my co-teacher?"
“I didn’t realize that you two were so close,” George said, raising an eyebrow.
“Coward!”
Please write back whenever it’s convenient,
floor and walked to the Probational Sub-department. He was sent straight to Dousselsnorf’s office. It took about five minutes for the officer to even show up, but Draco was fine with that. It was his last chance to snoop around the room looking for some clues about Dousselsnorf’s family. Once he found the pictures of the officer’s wife and three kids, he heard someone clear their throat behind him. It was Dousselsnorf.
He started to laugh awkwardly. “Oh,” he said, “Oh, yeah. I’m a French noble, don’t you know?” Fab and Sally started snorting with laughter. Others in the park just stared at them even harder.
“Hey, shouldn’t you buy a present for your mother?” Harry asked.
“M-Malfoy! Wait!”
.          They rushed out the door, eager to see most of the campus before the sun went down. Harry showed them the buildings nearest to his apartment first before making his way to the buildings with his classes in them. They were walking towards Samuel Alexander when Harry’s eyes found Malfoy heading out of the building. He glanced at Harry and seemed content on ignoring the man. He moved his eyes from Harry towards Andromeda and Teddy. He stopped dead in his tracks.
“How?”
Draco smelled something that resembled sweat and garbage. He wrinkled up his nose and glanced over at Potter, who was spaced out. Draco decided not to say anything. He didn’t want to embarrass him after all the bloke’s mistakes already that day. Draco went back to reading the syllabus and wondered when, exactly, he’d changed so much. He wondered when he stopped caring so much about not embarrassing his peers. Was it after the war, or was it much sooner? When did he let his façade fall?
“Ugh. What courses do you have now?” Harry asked.
“What?” Draco smirked.
“3:30—time to close!” Sally informed Draco while grinning.
"It-It.
He chuckled, "Yeah! Just like when I, uh…" Harry realized that he didn't tell her the full extent of the sleep-walking. "When I stopped by there one night when I got some Archie's. I really love the city. It's so different from London." He could tell that she wanted to ask about it, but she changed the subject.
On Monday morning, he breezed through his psychology class. His professor affirmed that they soon would be assigned a research paper that would be twenty percent of their total grade. Filled with worry, Harry walked to his English class deep in thought. Thus, he almost didn’t notice when a familiar voice called his name.
He spent the next three days cramming information about Stock Markets, confirmation bias, triangles, and Picasso. He knew that, if he would teach, he wanted to be like Remus—not Snape nor Binns nor Trelawney. He wanted to encourage students, not bore them or scare them.
[Again? That’s the second time today.]”
“Um…when you told me that you’re bi.”
“Did her parents disown her?”
Draco sneered. He didn’t have time for Darren’s bullshit, and he was honestly hoping that he had been busted for meth again. Maybe this time he wouldn’t be rehired. Draco truly didn’t understand the muggle world. He clocked in, only to find Fab talking to a new hire. He gave Fab a quizzical look as he stepped behind the bar.
He went up the lift to the 3
They found their seats, and Harry positioned himself as far away from Ginny as possible so that he wouldn’t have to watch her kiss Luna. He wondered when he’d stop feeling so awkward, especially since he was the one to break up with her. Harry decided to do what he so often did: he shoved his emotions down and pretended they weren’t there.
"Yes, but you now how traffic is," Malfoy claimed, walking off. Harry watched the blond as he moved towards the west side of campus. Sometimes he just could not understand Malfoy.
Harry wrote back,
"Um, yeah. Just thinking…"
“I did,” Harry answered. He smiled and batted his eyelashes—trying to flirt. He laughed aloud at the thought.
Dr. Shelly smiled. She stood up and walked over to her bookshelf where her activities for her patients were located.
They dropped their conversation and walked to the living room. Harry’s jaw fell when he observed Draco and Mr. Weasley deep in conversation.
Draco got in line behind Harry, but he wouldn't make eye contact.
Malfoy did as Harry said, and then asked, “How did you know that that would work?”
"Since your panic attack this morning, how are you?" Draco clarified.
the only one that Harry was close to.
econ-politics are different than that of Europe?”
Xavier nodded. Draco’s self-control broke, and he rolled his eyes. Out of the corner of his eye, he could see Potter smirk. Draco wanted to fucking die of embarrassment. “I’ll do the martinis. You can do the shots and beer.”
"Was it bad?" Draco asked.
“Really?”
"Teaching is serious business, Mr. Potter," McGonagall joked.
“Yeah, but not in front of me.” Ron pouted.
“Why were you—“
“No.”
After trying to steady himself for a few minutes, he retrieved his coffee mug and walked over to the couch. He sat down and opened yesterday’s copy of the Manchester Evening News. This was traditional for Draco. Every night, after work, he would take a copy home just before attempting to drift asleep. In the morning, he would reread it while drinking his coffee. Ever since he was a kid, he was always interested in muggle news and history. Something forbidden like sneaking off to read a muggle publication just filled him with adrenaline. At Hogwarts, he would steal a book, magazine, or newspaper from one of the Slytherin half-bloods. Then he’d store it in his room, reading it by wand-light while everyone else slept. On occasion, he would forget he had it and accidentally bring the copy home. The house-elves would find it in his school supplies and turn it over to his father, who would promptly punish him severely. Sometimes, he’d be beaten with his father’s cane while others would involve a short-term crucio. Other times, though he would hide the books underneath a secret, loose floorboard. He relished reading that precious literature—those prizes—alone at night. He even had a few of them still.
Draco,
‘I missed you too. It’s too bad we don’t have much classes in common.’
Then came the time when Harry was selected by the Goblet of Fire to participate in the Triwizard Tournament. He swore he had nothing to do with it - because he hadn't. When people, mostly Slytherins, started calling him a liar, Draco took care of it and threatened anyone who would as much as stare at Harry for too long. He didn't know if he was going too far, considering that he and the Potter boy weren't really dating, but he felt the need to protect him.
‘Well, I do now! I’m fucking soaked and my shirt is see-through!’
Narcissa - You know what? I don't give a shit. You're right, we need to somehow convince Harry to date our boy... how could we manipulate him into-
'Maybe I don't have to do
There was a tiny pause as Pansy looked more carefully at Potter.
Soon enough, he forced himself to ignore the letter and decided he wasn’t going to go anyway. What if it was a trap? What if someone wanted to humiliate him? Or what if it was way more serious than that? What if it involved
Draco was so committed to protect Harry that everyone was convinced they were really dating. Except maybe one person.
Draco didn't take away his hand until he was sure she had closed the door. Out of precaution, he did a silencing spell, and then finally he let Harry talk.
Harry didn’t look convinced. Seeing him so nervous made Draco’s heart tighten.
‘You..,’ he started. ‘You’ve never called me that before.’
'Wait!' he said, jogging after him. 'Maybe you don't have to do that.'
‘You’re very welcome,’ Pansy said, grinning.
They didn't talk about what happened that morning again, but Draco was very grateful Harry was committed to make their relationship look real. To repay him, the blond started sitting next to him in Potions to help him, as he knew it was his weakness.
‘What’s on your mind?’ Harry finally asked.
He felt Pansy's hand on his shoulder.
: The summer after Draco graduated from Hogwarts.
‘How was your day, love?’ Harry asked him.
The same day, Malfoy received a Howler. It was from his father. He was insulting his son, telling him how he was a disgrace to the family, and to not even think about going home at the end of term. It was a very public and very violent humiliation. Not able to look anyone in the eyes, Draco put his head in his hands and started crying silently. Only after a few seconds, he felt someone hugging him from behind, kissing his cheeks and whispering in his ears that everything would be okay. It was Harry, who had left the Gryffindor table to confort Draco.
Lucius - Anyway, should I send Potter an owl? Or visit him via floo powder? I could apparate but I don't know where he is at the moment...
'I don't know,' Pansy was saying. 'Don't you think something's strange?'
'I dare you to ask Potter out,' Pansy repeated.
Maybe two weeks after the start of their little arrangement, Harry received a letter from Molly. He expected her to be mad at him, because the Weasleys hated the Malfoys. But she was very considerate and only told Harry to be careful, because she knew this was his first relationship, and she knew people talked about everything he did.
, he thought.
‘What do you mea-’
So he kissed Harry.
Draco looked up at him and stared for a few seconds. Harry stared back. This went on just a bit too long for it to be insignificant. Draco realised it, and, before Harry had a chance to speak, he spilled his own drink on the Potter boy.
Harry let out a breath.
‘Sorry,’ Harry said with a shy smile. ‘I think part of the reason why I didn’t tell you was because, from the beginning, I felt something weird was happening. When it was just the two of us… I don’t know, there wasn’t any tension or unnecessary conflict. I didn’t really understand why, and I couldn’t think of a way to explain it to you guys.’
Ron almost spat out the water he was drinking.
Despite a few protestations, Harry and Draco sat with the others. Eventually, people got over it and the game started again. Surprisingly, Harry wasn’t picked once. Draco did have to kiss someone though, which was very painful for Harry, but he pretended he didn’t care. In fact, he really shouldn’t have cared. He should have felt uncomfortable and out of place, surrounded by so many Slytherins. But the truth was, he just felt jealous. He was playing spin the bottle with fucking Draco Malfoy and he wasn’t even getting to kiss him.
Draco looked at him, and suddenly everything he had ever done to the Potter boy came back to him. He felt so ashamed and embarrassed.
‘Draco Malfoy,’ Pansy said, imitating the tone of a falsely angry mother, ‘Turn around
Harry’s frown deepened. Had he never called Draco by his name before? He thought about him so often… it must have confused him.
‘Oh well, thanks for telling me,’ Draco answered jokingly. ‘Really saved me quite a few months of questioning myself.’
- Guys... guys! Hey, Draco, it's been like 30 seconds, stop it!
‘Come on, guys, let’s get to class,’ Blaise added as the bell rang.
'Have you talked with your family since?' he asked.
The boy managed to forget all about it until Friday morning. He was eating breakfast when Ron hit Harry on his ribs.
Draco's face turned red.
expecting it, but in the end I don’t think they mind. They just need some time to process.’
Hermione nodded.
‘Yeah. But, you know, if you’re happy...’ Ron added. ‘Then we’re happy for you.’
- So, what's your ring size?
‘Oh, shit,’ he started, ‘I am so sorry, I didn’t see you-’
‘I don’t hate you, Draco. Believe me, I tried, but I just can’t.’
They were in the Slytherin common room on a late sunday night, with a bunch of other Fourth years.
‘They didn’t, actually,’ Harry said, arriving from behind.
So Draco was sitting in the bleachers during the second task. At first, when he saw that Harry had found a way to breathe underwater, he wasn't so nervous. Ron was down there, so obviously Harry would make it.
'Hey sweetie,' said Harry with a sarcastic grin. 'What are you doing?'
Lucius,
Draco was used to it. Being hated by everyone. Being insulted for merely existing. He had learned not to care. But Harry saying that… He knew they were enemies, and he
It was the first time either of them was kissing anyone. Draco thought his heart was about to explode. He knew he shouldn't have been feeling like this, because this was supposed to be fake and this kiss was... Well, it wasn't real.
But after looking at his shirt and then at Harry for a few seconds, Draco just laughed it off.
- I mean, rules are rules. I wouldn't want you to be bullied because of me.
Pansy hit his arm with her book.
He had hoped it would be another empty classroom, but, of course, it was just a tiny closet.
- What?
Harry sighed and said ‘I know’ in a very low voice.
- Harry didn't tell you?'
Then came the first task of the Triwizard Tournament. Draco was initially stressed out, because he knew Harry didn't have the age - nor technically the knowledge - to be participating, yet he was forced to. But when the blond saw the dragons, he thought he was going to have a stroke. As if it weren't bad enough, Harry was the last one to go. Draco was so close to passing out.
So he didn’t. Without really meaning to, he took a step closer to Draco.
'- Is Draco using Harry? Is this some kind of game to you??
'You were really worried about me?' he asked, somewhat unconfident.
One evening, Draco even decided that it was time for him to grow up and apologize for everything he had done. He went looking for Harry and found him outside, enjoying the last sunrays of the day.
: Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson and others
To Draco's greatest joy, almost nothing changed between them when they were alone. They just wouldn't kiss, but they would still hold hands, spend time together and all kinds of things. This was the first time Draco ever considered that maybe, maybe Harry did like him, too. Maybe it wasn't all just an act. He never asked, though.
- Oh..
Draco's heart was beating so loud he was sure Harry could feel it. At first, he didn't understand why he was asking him this, and then he realized it was his solution to make Pansy and Hermione shut up about them.
‘Well,’ Harry said, trying to look composed. ‘Maybe I’ve never said it before because it’s a stupid name.’
‘It’s just a shirt, right?’ he said, smiling.
Hermione - Seriously, Harry, stop it, you're making it weird!
Harry thought for a few seconds, carefully deciding on what he wanted to share and what he wanted to keep secret.
But then, Harry's turn came. And he did amazing. Summoning his broom to be able to use his flying skills... When he was finished, Draco felt like he had never been prouder. He screamed and cheered, and when his gaze met Harry's, it was like everything else around them faded.
Harry kissed the top of Draco’s head.
‘Great,’ Harry said with a big smile.
,’ Ron said. ‘And to think I was pitying you because I thought you were forced to spend alone time with Snape...’
Harry - You want me to kiss
Harry - Right?
Pansy smiled.
'I know,' Draco answered after taking a deep breath. 'It's just... everyone else is there. Why is he the last one - the only one still underwater?'
'Oh...'
Harry giggled.
In February came the second task. Rescuing someone close to you from the depth of the lake.
Lucius,
Pansy,
Except he couldn’t. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw Draco’s face. Even worse, he saw Draco laughing, the way he did that morning. He tried so hard to make it go. To sleep. He just couldn’t.
Draco finally arrived in front of his two friends, a little smile on his face.
‘I didn’t even do anything to annoy him!’ he retorted.
There was a little pause.
Hermione,
‘No, you’re right. The idiots are clearly in love with each other.’
'Dare, what do you think?' replied Draco, expecting some stupid challenge, like doing a difficult spell or kissing one of the Slytherins.
'I'm sorry,' Draco said. 'I couldn't risk them finding us here.'
But time passed, and Harry didn't reappear. Draco started worrying about him not coming back in time.
Harry shrugged.
Draco froze.
Draco's plan was to start a casual conversation when sitting next to him in Potions, but the sudden proximity he had with Harry made him unable to speak.
'Extreme?' Pansy answered. 'We're Slytherins, extreme is our middle name. Anyway, Draco would never refuse a dare. Would you?'
They let a few minutes pass silently, just hugging in the parking lot, against Harry’s car. Neither of them wanted to go where they were heading next.
Harry didn't speak for a while, searching his words. Then:
‘What?’ he asked, annoyed.
Harry was staring at his own shirt, annoyed, and didn’t notice the shift in Draco’s eyes. After a few seconds though, he looked up.
In their 3rd year, he started to understand that his crush was rather serious and would not go away that easily. This was when he told Pansy. She was very supportive and tried to help him the best she could, but it wasn't until one night during their 4th year that she actually did something helpful.
- What kind of question is that...
Maintaining his smirk, Draco silently dropped his bag on the floor and slowly turned around.
Harry's cheeks went red.
'Of course I wouldn't,' he said in a clear voice. 'But it's gonna be hard to ask him out
Embarrassed about how even the Headmaster thought Harry loved Draco, the blond managed to convince him to pick Ron.
By lunchtime, everyone had heard about Draco Malfoy wearing Harry Potter’s football jacket. The two boys had a very public feud, which is why it was surprising to most people. Last they had heard, Potter and Malfoy hated each other. However, not being close to either of the boys involved, they got over it pretty quickly.
It wasn’t the first time Harry was getting an anonymous letter. Death threats, people accusing him of being a liar… maybe sometimes people showing their support. But it was definitely the first time he was receiving that kind of anonymous letter.
Draco was trying to get himself together before anyone noticed how red he was.
- Look, Draco is a bitch for affection. He loves PDA. And yet all he and Harry ever do is holding hands. Have you seen them kiss, even once?'
Narcissa - Lucius, don't talk about the Potter boy like that!
Draco tried as hard as he could not to let himself be distracted by the fact that he was in a closet with Harry Potter. Their bodies were so close it made breathing difficult.
Harry's face was red as well, now, but Draco didn't notice because it was too dark.
There was a pause.
'Sure,' he replied. 'What's up?'
'- I don't even care about my dad. But my mom... and where am I supposed to go this summer? He made it pretty clear I wasn't welcome.
Sure enough, he heard a door opening, and Pansy saying:
'Everything. I've been awful to you since day one for no reason. You didn't deserve it. I don't even know why you're talking to me, let alone pretend to be my boyfriend.'
- I know... it's not what you expected from- from your son. And I- I'm so-rry but-
- Excuse-me, what?
'Weird, I was sure I heard someone...'
He didn't dare finish his sentence, not knowing whether Draco wanted to talk about it or not.
‘Does that include you?’ Draco asked in a low voice after a few seconds.
- Mom, Dad... Harry and I are dating.
. I’m sure Pansy and Blaise already knew,’ Hermione said to Ron. They were eating, waiting for Harry to show join them.
'It's none of our business,' she continued.
Both his friends shrugged. They weren’t completely convinced by his explanation but they accepted it.
Finally, they both got in the car. Before starting the vehicle, Harry leaned over and kissed Draco.
This discouraged Draco so much that he was ready to surrender and tell Pansy he couldn't do it. But when he was on his way to the Great Hall for dinner, Harry cornered him in an empty hallway.
They stared at each other, unable to move, and were forced into a dark closet by Pansy and Blaise. Then Pansy closed the door, and it was just the two of them, drunk and trapped in a dark, tiny closet.
‘You didn’t seem to mind earlier,’ Harry answered.
When Harry Potter entered the hallway and made his way towards Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, his two best friends, Pansy and Blaise stopped talking and stared at him for a few seconds before going back to their hushed conversation.
“We always thought that you knew. I mean…we knew,” Hermione said.
“Uh…how about over there?” Harry pointed to a gazebo.
Draco”
of that—he sprinted to his apartment. He ran up the stairs so quickly that his footsteps made loud bangs. Gonzalo was out by his front door when Draco got to their floor. His disapproving scowl let Draco know that he was about to be yelled out.
“Wonderful! Anything you’d like to share before we continue our conversation from last week?”
His therapist claimed that thinking too much was dangerous, but Harry couldn’t see it. “Hermione would not be proud,” he thought.
"Which one has an odd number of people?" she asked in return.
did. Then again, he wasn’t sure that he counted. Andromeda faked a pout, “Ugh,
“I don’t see how I couldn’t be,” said Ron. “One, I’m not a bigot. Two, Charlie is aroace and Ginny is a bi trans girl. Excuse me, woman.”
“Exactly.
“Personal interests? Other opportunities? Soul searching?” Harry snorted after that last addition. They took their respective seats next to one-another. They pulled out their ministry-issued Dark Charms and Spell Disarmament textbooks and turned their eyes to the professor, an ex-entrepreneur who was obsessed with ancient Greek gods. Despite her apparent grace and maturity, she was hideously ugly; she was covered with warts and scars—her face marred by dark spots and saggy, unsavory skin. Harry rubbed his eyes and glanced at the clock.
“No, sir. Wait, ‘Busty Boo’? You’ve got to pulling my leg here. There’s no drug named that!”
"Do you think it'll fix me…?" He asked, slightly embarrassed by his own question. He already knew what she was going to say.
"Tedy, you
“I suppose I could ask you the same,” Malfoy attempted with a sneer, but it did not work. The blond had lost a considerable amount of weight, his eyes were bloodshot and had deep bags underneath, and his skin was as grey as it was in sixth year.
"Okay, who's next?" Andromeda asked.
“What? And you couldn’t lie?” Malfoy sighed, rubbed his forehead, and ruffled his hair.
“Can I ask why?” Harry swallowed.
He pulled the sleeves of his hoodie down to wipe the remaining tears of his eyes. He cast a quick spell to take away the redness left from the panic attack. He got up quickly—maybe a bit too quickly, as he grew nauseous as soon as he stood—and opened the door. Halloween and Cauliflower ran to him. They had been waiting by the door, and now they stood by his feet—their eyes looking up at his expectantly. The cats wanted cuddles. How could a being possibly love Draco this much? After all he’d done, couldn’t they sense an evil in people?
TW: food, death m, insomnia m
Harry continued laughing, and he placed his forehead against Draco's. He responded, "I love you too."
Draco observed their faces. The entire group looked to be pretty tipsy, but Potter seemed to already be on the way to smashed. It made Draco feel sick. It’d been so long since he’d had a drink. Since he’d been drunk. It also made him sick because there Potter was: drunk as fuck, falling all over a fellow Gryffindor in front of his ex-nemesis. In a bloody muggle bar. How the fuck did Draco even end up here?
Harry’s thoughts ended as he reached the head auror office. He entered his department and headed over to his assigned physical training position alongside Ron. The ginger offered him a reassuring smile: this would be a long day.
Draco moved his hand up and rested it on Harry’s neck as their kiss became deeper. He didn’t want to stop the moment, but he couldn’t feel his hands anymore from the winter chill. He internally cursed himself for not bringing gloves.
"Better with you than at your expense, right?"
"I see," Harry stated. He felt awkward. This seemed too professional to really be a meeting between him and McGonagall. He smiled at her, trying to break the bizarreness in the atmosphere.
“Yes, I do. Two boys and a baby girl. My wife’s name was Maria, and our children were Marco, Jeremiah, and Susana,” he stated, a somber look filling his face.
"Flabbergasted," Harry repeated.
Harry’s week just before classes began was dedicated to familiarizing himself with his apartment, Manchester, and the university. Hermione, Ron, Ginny, Luna, Dean, Seamus, and Neville helped Harry move some of his belongings to his newly remodeled flat, a modest one-bedroom near Victoria Park. They’d spent a few days doing some light partying, strangely joined by Hermione, and visiting some tourist attractions.
“Oh, right,” Harry said. “Um, I guess we should go in the classroom.”
They laughed again, but a short silence was ensured afterwards.
"Thank you." Luna smiled. "How about you?"
“Oh, Harry, you shouldn’t have!” Andromeda exclaimed happily. She looked at the pink bag and said, “Really? I know that you didn’t go all the way to Manchester for Archie’s Burgers again!”
“Sure,” Harry gave her the materials. “Hey, are we gonna have treacle tart? You know it’s my favorite.”
“Oh, no. Ce n’est pas une probleme, [It isn’t a problem,]” Harry answered.
Malfoy nodded, then admitted, “The masks are the worst part.”
“Um…thank you,” the blond responded quizzically.
.          “I wanted to contact you,” Andromeda admitted, “after the war. I wasn’t…certain…if the time was right. Are you…? Are things all right? Why are you here?”
It was 5AM by the time Draco decided to stop trying to will himself to sleep. He rose from his mattress slowly, pretending to stretch the exhaustion away. He drudged to kitchen and lit a cigarette just before starting his coffee pot. He watched as it slowly dripped down into the pot.
“So are others,” Harry replied. “Other people from the war are depressed too, but they don’t drink or do drugs.”
Draco rolled his eyes. He said, “I don’t know, Douss. Maybe I’m sick and tired of having to come to this bloody office once every week. Maybe I’m sick and tired of having my wand checked every week. Maybe I’m sick of having my home checked for dark magical contraband once a month. Maybe I’m tired of being painted as the villain!”
“I was considering a tool set.”
On December 16
Harry shook his stupor and said, “Ron, I fought Voldemort, and remember the Triwizard Tournament? I think I’ll be okay.”
"'Arry!"
"But?" Draco questioned.
Harry thought for a few seconds and then said, “I dunno. Sometimes I just get randomly obsessed about specific details. It’s a trait I’ve had for...years. Probably since before Hogwarts.”
"What were you doing in the Room of Hidden Things in fifth year?" Draco randomly asked.
The night continued and Harry joined Narcissa and Andromeda on the porch. Eventually, Andromeda went inside to get more candy.
On his first day, Harry woke up early and promptly gathered all of his supplies. He could never think of another time he’d been this prepared as he thought, “Blimey, Hermione’d be proud.”
Draco shook his head.
.          Malfoy’s mouth fell open as he pondered how to reply. Harry cringed a bit. Andromeda kept repeating herself. Teddy whined for Harry to pick him up; he didn’t seem to like this stranger. Finally, Malfoy straightened his back and looked Andromeda in the eyes.

Ron rolled his eyes.
“Two fireballs and a Blue Label,” Dean informed them, ordering for Seamus as well.
Both cats ran.
“Hawwy!” Teddy exclaimed, “You awake!”
“No, sir.”
“I’m great! And you?” Harry chuckled, ignoring the joke.
When it was time to finish cooking dinner, Harry just wanted to skip the entire event. He would have, but he knew that Andromeda was counting on him. He wanted to make her proud. By 4:30, he gathered up his wits and changed into his favorite green sweater. Since his Hogwarts days had finished, he’d grown fond of the color.
Harry awoke to find himself lying in a clinic bed with Ron looking over him.
“Good job, Amanda.” Harry continued, “So what is three squared?”
Harry stood watch by the swings, ensuring that no kid swung too high. He was about five minutes into the lookout when Davie walked towards him. The young boy was frowning and was clearly in distress.
He signed up for the teaching opportunity because he remembered what Draco said; Harry did, in fact, love teaching. This internship was an experiment to see if he could actually be good at it. He hadn’t told anyone his plans because he was stills scared of being a failure. He remembered back in August when he chose to go to a muggle university because he was tired of being selfless. Had he possibly abandoned that point of view in the past eight months?
Malfoy crumpled up his nose and said, “Except for Calculus.”
An alarmed look crossed Ron’s eyes.
[Do you like muggle history or magical history?]”
“That’s great. Do you know when you’re gonna tie the knot?” Harry asked.
Harry preferred this because these students were ten and eleven—slightly younger than first years at Hogwarts.
“Oh, I agree. Have you tried muggle French toast before?”
[How are you?]"
"As well as possible, considering the past events."
Draco smiled.
“Eh. I think that Pansy’s neutral about most things.” Draco turned to the sales assistant and pointed to tear-drop shaped, diamond earrings. “Can I view those?” He observed the earrings for a few minutes, then asked, “Is there a matching necklace?’
“Does it matter what people think?”
“Ooh, okay. I see the difference,” Draco sarcastically retorted.
Harry lit another cigarette and stared at Draco. He was speechless.
“Me? Haven’t we always discussed me?”
"Sit. Have a biscuit," she commanded.
“Luna and Neville,” Harry said. “But I wanna get them stuff from the wizarding world.”
“Got over it?”
Sincerely,
Draco shot him a quizzical look.
, Harry found himself shopping alone. School had let out days before and Harry was rather bored without the necessary studying and working. There was also the fact that he needed to purchase gifts for Professor Flitwick, Headmistress McGonagall, Professor, Sprout, Seamus, Dean, Ernie, Cho, and most of the Weasleys. He left after breakfast and traveled to London. He was ready for major Christmas shopping and, in fact, didn’t plan to come home before he was done.
“Yes, but there are still plans to fix the greenhouses and they want to build new dorms.”
How could he let them down? How could he just let them die? Fred and Colin and Tonks and Remus and Moody and—
kids. He absolutely loathed them. They had no sense of boundaries, no sense of morality, and no sense of common decency. This, purposefully rubbing one’s filthy hand through another person’s hair, was just one example. Another one was the toddler’s never ending whining while the three adults talked. Or, Draco thought, while he and Andromeda Tonks talked and Potter stuttered out a comment or two.
His high had only gotten worse, and he’d been so fidgety and jumpy that Sally had asked him if he wanted to take the night off. He ended up sticking it out for the entire night; however, he had almost lost his cool when one drunk customer decided to curse out the entire crew working that night. It was only Draco and Sally since Darren had called out last minute due to an “illness.” Draco promised himself that he’d kick Darren’s arse next time he saw him.
“That she was worried about you because you had been doing muggle drugs and alcohols.”
It had been a while since he had had a nightmare this vivid and this long. He sighed deeply and stood up. He made his way to the kitchen. After starting the coffee pot, he went outside for a smoke. He had smoked about three cigarettes before he calmed down enough to enter the house again. His cup of black coffee went with him as he went outside for a final smoke before showering.
"Really," Draco confirmed. "I feel like I was…rude…to you."
He decided to at least take some more of his Dreamless Sleep Potion. Even if he couldn’t fix his brain, he’d still be able to have his other internal organs function. He took double the recommended dosage, turned off his alarm, and attempted to sleep again.
“Someone’s a little defensive,” she pointed out.
“Would you like the free nachos that are included with our happy hour? A purchase of three martinis merits a plate,” Malfoy claimed.
“Harry,
“And?”
world, of all places. Harry hadn’t spent a lot of time thinking about Malfoy, no—at least that’s what he’d kept telling himself. He was done obsessing with things. He’d promised Ron and Hermione and his therapist and everyone else that he was done with his little obsessions. Besides, university was more important than Malfoy, whom Harry would very likely never see again.
“Oi, watch it, mate! Get the bloody hell
Harry shrugged, “It’s what I do when I have a panic attack.”
Harry could not sleep. It was 4AM and nothing helped. Yes, he tried everything. Exercise. Warm milk. Violin music. Yoga. Melatonin. Breathing exercises. Grounding techniques. Dreamless sleep potions (Calm down, he only took one. He wasn’t going to get addicted.).
Harry shrugged, “You?”
Draco nodded.
“Cool,” Draco replied. He furrowed his eyebrows, opened his mouth, shook his head, and closed his mouth.
of a square?”
He stepped out a minute later and said, “Oh, sorry. I’ll go back in if you want me to.”
He shut out his self-pitying thoughts when he noticed Charlie Weasley walking towards him.
Harry woke up with a start in his sweat-drenched bed. Running his hand through his messy hair, Harry got up and promptly located the “List of Affirmations for Abuse Survivors” that his therapist gave him.
He had begun auror training in September, a three-year process which consisted of charm classes, written exams, theoretical work, and an internship in the last part of the third year. He was going through this with Ron, Dean, and Seamus. They only had a few more months left of their first year; they were all thoroughly enjoying it.
“Y-yeah. I-I just didn’t hear you and…” Harry trailed off. Would he admit that he was scared of silence when Narcissa, the woman who lied to Voldemort to save his life, sat right there?
Draco smiled, then said, “No, really?”
“I don’t mind,” Harry replied.
“Yes,” Draco sighed. “I’m an idiot. It’s January and I
They all talked about current events for the rest of dinner, but tiptoed around the article concerning Harry. Whenever the
"Well, good," Draco said. "'Cause it's starting to snow again."
Andromeda simply smiled and handed it to him.
He sealed up the parchment. Then, he got out another sheet. If he was going to taunt his mother with his and his aunt’s relationship, he might as well respond to his aunt. He took another shot.
"I'm feeling fine," Harry answered.
Teddy giggled and replied, “Bonjour, ‘Arry! Mamie cooks sweets!”
“Hello, Harry. I’m so pleased that you could make it,” McGonagall said, sitting down in her seat. Her eyes were warm, but there was also a sadness behind them. Harry wondered how she was faring. He wondered how much all of
.          “He likes hair a lot,” Potter stated. He stood hunched over a bit, but Draco could see that the man had gotten much taller in the past year or two. They were now close to the same height, probably. Once upon a time, Potter had stood nearly half a foot shorter than Draco, abnormally short compared to Draco’s 5’8. He had also gotten much more fit since the war.
The days passed and New Year’s Eve was upon them before they could comprehend it. It was 5 PM and Harry was awaiting Draco’s 6 PM arrival. He almost wished that the hour could be longer. He was in one of his best dress suits and had checked his appearance in the mirror over a hundred times in the past ten minutes. All the while, Andromeda grinned at him. He didn’t know if she knew or not, but at the moment, he was too worried with impressing Draco to care.
Harry rolled his eyes and moved to kiss Draco. Their fingers linked, and they proceeded to the public transit.
The fire was
“So, you have a family?” the blond asked, pointing towards the now-hidden pictures.
“Er...well…” Harry said, breaking the awkward silence.
[I told you! (incorrect grammar used to show Teddy’s linguistic progression)],” Teddy screamed. He was jumping on top of the floor and swinging his arms wildly. He only had one shoe on.
“No,” Ron said quizzically. “It’s Obstacle Course Day. Y’know, the day we’ve been waiting for ever since we signed up for training. You haven’t been here for our preparation and review days. Are you sure you’re ready?”
“That’s what I said, Drake. Good night, everyone!” Jerry yelled out to the crew.
"We can stay outside." Harry added, "If you want."
“Reading….” Draco looked back at the shelf and picked up a random book, “the

“Well,” Harry began, “I figured that we should let him taste it so that his taste buds are well-developed and then someone…” He pointed to himself and continued, “could maybe have the rest.”
“Wait,” Harry called as Malfoy began to walk away.
Harry felt like he was floating. He was floating down Oxford Road; he had to be. Wait, was he floating? Harry was so confused. Why was he so confused? Was he dreaming?
“Accidentally? Did it just….
Draco sighed, “Confinement to the country, twenty hours community service per year, atleast part-time employment, weekly check-ins with an officer and an auror, monthly therapy, my wand is checked…all that…”
.          Harry waited until Malfoy had made himself completely comfortable in his respective seat before he leaned in, his hair nearly touching Malfoy’s pointy face.
“Um...yes…” Harry spoke in depth of his sleeping problems for about thirty minutes.
“You don’t?”
Afterwards, Draco was going in to work. This was the eighth day in a row that he had closed, and he wasn’t entirely sure that it was healthy, but he was glad to have the extra money. Maybe he’d convince himself to eat at some point. He was still recovering—no matter how slowly.
“Yeah. This is all on sale, right?”
Nevertheless, Harry finally knew what he had to do. He was on his way to the department now: 4PM on a Wednesday. He and Andromeda had spoken the night before about Harry’s options, and they were both aware that Harry’s current mental state couldn’t handle the training process and the subsequent stress of the career.
"No! It's a real word."
in a year and he had been okay. With shaking hands, he untied the newspaper from the owl’s leg.
“Sit down, you ungrateful, little git. I want this meeting to go as quickly as possible so that you’re out of my life for good,” Dousselsnorf replied, a vein in his forehead throbbing.
His classroom appalled him. It was set up in one of the university’s lecture halls and had over 100 students in it already. He showed up five minutes early and was lucky to have gotten a seat on the eleventh row.
Harry sat down in his favorite seat in Dr. Shelly's office. He'd always picked the one closest to the door, in case he needed to escape or…something. He didn't know why he did it. It just felt weird to switch things up. Maybe this was a "symptom." Sometimes he felt like everything was a "symptom."
Harry touched his throbbing head. “What happened?” he muttered.
They decided to attend to Draco’s shopping first because he had less people to shop for: Andromeda, Teddy, and Pansy. The car was parked in a Tiffany’s parking lot, but neither men moved.
“Oh, no. My, uh, roommate taught me. She’s Haitian, but she knows a few languages. My name’s Sally, by the way.” Draco offered his hand.
"Hello, how are you?" Draco asked formally.
"Um…" Harry twiddled his thumbs. "I don't know. I have a slight headache… Oh! And I am so bloody thirsty. I'm just so insanely thirsty." Harry shook his head. It'd been a week since he started taking the medicine, and his dry mouth was still horrid.
"I got you a present," Harry said. "Happy Christmas, Draco."
like you, and if they have a problem with it, they’ll have to deal with it.”
“Potter, stay out of it.”
“Are you sorry” Harry asked.
“Sometimes,” Draco retorted.
Ron pulled Harry aside and whispered, “He wrote us all apology letters.” He paused to show Harry the three page letter. “This has gotta be at least thirty inches. Can you believe it? Dad wanted to talk to him about the muggle educational system.”
He arrived at the Ministry of Magic and went straight to the floor of Probational Matters. He sat in the waiting room for roughly ten minutes before the secretary called him back into Maxeltroph Dousselsnorf’s office. The office was very industrial looking with only a desk, two chairs, and a cabinet. Dousselsnorf himself had a large frame, deeply recessed eyes, a big, bushy moustache, furrowed eyebrows, and a potbelly. His bald head would glint every so often as the ceiling light reflected off of it. Draco sighed deeply before sitting down.
[I want to] stay up!" Teddy screamed back. He got grumpy when he was tired.
He began to hyperventilate. “I’m going to die here I’m going to die here I’m going to die here I’m going to—”
“Listen, Potter. I don’t know why you’re here nor what you wanted,” Malfoy whisper-screamed, “as you have the whole of the wizarding world in your pocket-“
Draco sighed and kept crawling. He stood up once he got to the kitchen and paced towards the employee bathroom.
“Yeah, why?”
“Yeah, I suppose that it is.”
Mostly everyone had left by midnight. Harry walked around snacking on the leftover candy with Fleur and Bill. Eventually, he excused himself for a cigarette and they joined Narcissa and Andromeda in the living room.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Dousselsnorf interrupted, “Do you even care what I say to you at this point? I’ve been talking about chess for the past ten minutes. Really, I don’t mind if you don’t care or pay attention. I get paid whether or not you land back in prison.”
I know that it has been a while since I have written, but I need to talk to you two. It’s very important. Could you show up for breakfast at 9? Teddy has wanted to see you both anyways. Thank you.
“Malfoy?” Harry inquired aloud.

He bought some food from Archie’s Burgers and decided to stay in the restaurant to eat it. He sat down and slowly ate. The food was horrible in his current state, but he was starving. He tried to focus on eating for the calories, but his high brain couldn’t think about that. He attempted to focus on turning twenty, but his thoughts were too frequent and jumbled. He felt like he was in one of those manic states that Fab would describe: his brain and body were racing. Then again, the shaking could have been due to the bloody meth running through his system. Draco got angry again. He knew that he never should have trusted Darren’s “mate” for a fix. He got up, cleaned his table, and walked towards the bar.
? [What?]"
“Marlboro Reds,” Malfoy observed. “I smoke that kind, too. Mind if I bum one?”
It was day three, Wednesday, and Draco felt like shit. He didn’t sleep at all on Monday, and it was hell trying to sleep Tuesday night because he had started coming down. At this point, Draco suspected that the “coke” was more meth than anything else. He had his final meeting with his probation officer today, and he was not going to let some damned meth ruin it. He stopped rocking back and forth—something he found himself doing a lot when he was mentally vulnerable—and got up to take some Xanax. He was hoping that the combination of the two drugs would make him feel sober. That’s what Sally told him to do, anyways.
'What?' he asked. 'Why would she do that?'
- Why?'
- What? That's not what I said.
Hearing Harry say those words made Draco so emotional he almost started crying. How had he gotten so lucky that he was now friends with Harry Potter?
He stopped in the middle of the hallway and tried to identify where the voices were coming from. He quickly understood that the two people were in an empty classroom. He came closer to the door and started listening.
This really unsettled Harry. Why did Draco sound so hurt? And what was he supposed to answer to that? He was supposed to hate him, of course. But he didn’t. Not by a long shot. No, he
, Draco thought. He didn't know if this was such a bid deal, because there weren't any real stakes behind their little fake dating thing. But if everyone discovered it was fake, he and Harry would have to stop whatever it was they were doing. And Draco didn't want that.
Draco swallowed.
'I don't know,' Draco lied. 'Look, it's okay, I'm just gonna say I didn't have the guts to do it, or that you said no, and you can forget about this embarrassing situation.'
This wasn’t true, of course. Harry loved Draco’s name. He loved everything about him. But the other boy didn’t need to know that.
‘Don’t take it personally, Hermione. We didn’t tell
Pansy looked down.
‘I’m sorry. I should be the one comforting you,’ Harry said with an apologetic smile.
It became harder and harder for Draco to keep in mind that this was all
Sure enough, they spotted Draco walking towards them a few seconds later. At first, Pansy couldn’t put her finger on what was different about him. Was it his hair, a little bit messier than usual? His tired eyes? No, those weren’t completely unsettling. She observed her friend for a few more seconds before it hit her. His jacket.
'We'll figure it out,' he told Draco. 'I won't leave you alone, okay? Maybe we're not really dating, but you're my friend.'
‘Yeah, well, it’s your
Eventually he got tired of it and got up. He quickly dressed up, and, without thinking much, left the Gryffindor common room to head towards the Slytherin quarters.
Sure enough, after a few days, everyone stopped saying altogether that Harry had cheated and illegally put his name in the Goblet of fire.
. Believe me,’ Harry said in a reassuring voice.
- It's just a-
‘I can’t believe he didn’t tell us.
. We’re his
Draco was leaving when Harry called after him.
- Come in here.
‘You don’t think…,’ Pansy started.
? I don’t think so. We knew you were in love with him even before you realised it yourself.’
There was a pause. Neither Ron or Hermione knew what to say. They had never imagined that Harry and Draco could be friends, let alone lovers.
Shortly after that, Harry and Draco decided that the latter would stay at Hogwarts for Christmas. Well, actually, Harry had asked him to stay, which made his fake-boyfriend very happy.
‘I find that hard to believe,’ Hermione answered. She was clearly hurt that she had found out at the same time as the whole school.
He still turned around to check, and the second his eyes met Malfoy’s, the latter looked away. He might have imagined this, but Harry could’ve sworn he saw Draco’s cheeks turning red.
‘Two months???’ he said, incredulous. ‘How did you manage to keep it a secret for that long?’
'- Well, you know, I was the one who dared Draco to ask Harry out.
him. He’s been annoying you since middle school.’
Just when he was thinking about kissing Malfoy, the latter decided that kissing was boring and announced that the next two people to be designated should be locked together in a closet for seven minutes. Harry didn’t even have time to process that, the bottle was already spinning and pointing at… him. He tried not to look panicked as everyone was staring at him. He imagined himself stuck in a closet with one of them. Just when he was about to claim he wasn’t playing anymore, someone spun the bottle again. When it stopped, it was pointing at Draco.
As if confirming his suspicion, people in the hallway started staring at Draco with wide eyes, whispering in his back and glancing at Harry.
. His feelings were very real, and being with Harry like that... he didn't know if it was more pleasant than painful. But he kept doing it because there was no way he would ever willingly stop whatever this was.
She started rubbing her hand on Draco's back to calm him. Just a few minutes later, Harry finally emerged from the water. When he saw him, Draco got up and quickly ran down the stairs. As he got closer, he realized why Harry had taken so long.
'Oh shit,' Pansy said. 'I shouldn't have said anything, Draco is going to kill ke...
‘I was just thinking about your next football match,’ Draco said with a smile. ‘I’ll wear your jacket and I’ll scream every time you have the ball. And whenever you score you’ll come running at me and we’ll kiss.’
‘Well,’ Draco answered with a smile, ‘We can comfort each other.’
Lucius - Don't even-
. I don't even know where the Gryffindor common room is.'
But she wasn't. She was sick of seeing her best friend suffering because of Potter and she wanted to give him a push. If Draco asked him out and he said yes, he'd finally be happy. But if Harry said no, Draco only had to say it was a dare, and no one would make a big deal out of it.
Harry stared at him, amazed.
Harry smiled, too. ‘Sounds like a plan,’ he said.
'Well...,' the black haired boy started, 'maybe we just don't like PDAs.'
Draco had no other choice but to accept, because he never turned down a dare. So, the next day, he tried to flirt with Harry. Surprisingly, it didn't change much from usual, and he quickly realised that he had to do more if he wanted it to be effective.
‘And Harry is so much better?’ answered Draco, on the defensive. ‘Congratulations, you have the most boring name on earth.’
It was 3:20pm when Draco met Harry at his car. There were people around, but they didn’t care anymore, so they kissed briefly. Then, Draco nestled against Harry, smiling.
‘I know.’ He answered. ‘I know, you’ve just never used it before.’
- Uh... you know what, I should as well show you.
‘Anyway, mate,’ Ron started, ‘I don’t get you. You

It felt so different from the other times. It felt
He wanted to go see Dumbledore so bad, to yell at him, to ask why Harry was taking so long. But he forced himself to stay still and to breathe. He couldn't make a scene.
'I don't know what you're-' Draco started.
- Oh wow, they're really doing it.
He tried again during Care of Magical Creatures. Teamed up with him and hurt his hand on purpose. It didn't entirely work, because Harry took Draco's hand in his for approximately three seconds before letting it go quite violently to call for Hagrid.
- I- I mean... out of the 5 of- whatever, it's my turn! Harry, truth or dare?
‘I mean, would it be that surprising? After all these years?’ Blaise answered.
Draco,
Hermione,
Some days were easier than others. Some days, Draco would insult Harry and by doing so he would almost convince himself that he didn't like him.
: Past midnight
He was thinking hard when someone grabbed his arm and turned him around.
'Draco, what was that?' he asked, clearly pissed.
Draco,
forget about it. He kept wondering about who could have sent it to him. And why? He wasn’t friends with any Slytherin. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Considering his rivalry with Draco, he was pretty sure every single Slytherin hated him.
Narcissa,
- Draco has just been complaining about him for so long, you know? He
Lucius,
'Well, you know, it's kind of mine,' Pansy said.
‘Yeah, you only forgot to mention that it was with

But as time went by, he understood he
One evening that Draco was headed to the Gryffindor tower, he started hearing whispers. He was about to ignore whatever secret conversation that was when he recognized one of the voices. Pansy's.
'Well... they noticed that we never kiss each other.'
"Yeah, she'll do it in July and then by letter in August," Neville confirmed.
“What’s that?”
“Do you want to…?” Draco asked.
“Well, you were late.”
After he finished eating, Harry shuffled through his presents and was once more mesmerized by the beauty of the scarf that Draco had gotten him. Surely, that meant that Draco liked him, right? Well, if he didn’t like him, he wouldn’t have kissed him, would he? But what if Draco wasn’t going to write back to him because he regretted the kiss? Harry was starting to panic, but then he saw Polonius flying towards the house.
“What kind?” he eventually asked.
Fab spoke up, “Do you all think that we’re going to be closing every night for the rest of our lives?”
7. You did not and do not deserve mistreatment.
‘Dude,’ Ron answered, pointing at the Slytherin table. ‘Draco has been staring at you for the past five minutes. It’s getting creepy.’
And they were kissing. It wasn’t a soft and shy kiss. It was a desperate kiss, one that made you feel dizzy and that screamed ‘I’ve been wanting to do that for so long.’. They didn’t break apart. Not when Harry pushed Draco against the wall and he hit a broom handle. Not when Draco’s hands started wandering under Harry’s shirt. And not even when Blaise opened the closet’s door, claiming the seven minutes were done. Instead, Draco quickly closed the closet again, never letting go of Harry, leaving a shocked Blaise on the other side of the door.
‘What the hell is Potter doing here?’ asked someone in the back.
Hermione,
- Mate, she didn't-
Narcissa - Who the fuck is Jesus?
Pansy - You're the one who chose truth.
Hermione,
'You idiot!' Draco started. 'I was so worried I started doubting you'd ever come out of the lake!'
- Why did you want to contact him again?
When he arrived, and there was an actual party, he was ready to be pointed at and insulted. But everyone just ignored him. Most of them seemed drunk already. When, after a few minutes, no one talked to him, he decided he should as well start drinking, too.
Hermione,
- Of course honey, what is it?
: Malfoy manor, living room.
When he left the Great Hall, he was determined not to go. He kept this willpower during the entire day. He even went to the point of getting to bed. All he had to do now was fall asleep.
- Yeah.
Mortified, Harry looked up and realised he had just spilled beer on no other than Draco Malfoy.
‘Who cares? He’s here now, he should as well have fun. Let’s play!’
It was, as usual, a quiet morning at Hogwarts High School. It was 8am and, in the hallway, almost every student was slowly taking the books they needed from their locker. Pressed against the wall, Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini were talking in low whispers.
Draco shook his head.
Draco swallowed and then nodded. He looked at his boyfriend.
Draco frowned and got up when he saw Harry walking towards the Slytherin table, because he thought something had happened. But instead, Harry pulled him into a hug, and whispered in his ear: 'Can I kiss you?'
Ron and Hermione, however, were having a hard time understanding how they did not know about their best friend’s romance.
'Don't play dumb with me, Malfoy,' Harry cut him. 'What are you up to? Why did you sit next to me and try to talk to me?'
to be in love with him, right? I bought fucking expensive brooms for his entire fucking Quidditch team just because
‘Good,’ Draco answered, breathing in Harry’s perfume. ‘There was some staring and talking in the hallways, but it was definitely worth it. And it seems Pansy and Blaise had already guessed I had a crush on you, so they weren’t too surprised. What about you?’
- Dare.
Harry looked so intensely at Draco that the latter was wondering if he had something on his face, but just when he was about to ask, Harry cupped the his head and kissed him.
But even though students pretended to ignore them, this new romance was something they talked about. And not only to their friends. People outside of Hogwarts heard about it, too.
Draco was really surprised. He never thought Pansy and Hermione were friends. Or even on speaking terms.
- We're not-
‘I don’t know,’ Harry answered, shrugging. ‘I guess people were so convinced we hated each other that they never considered we might actually be dating. I’m sure we could have kept it to ourselves longer, but it was getting tiring to be unable to do simple things like hold hands in the hallways and kiss in the bleachers.’
Harry - I hate to do this, Draco, but they're forcing me. Literally won't take no for an answer.
Draco took Harry’s hand and squeezed it.
Hermione - Okay... well... I guess, maybe... Ron?
him. He tried to think of the rational thing to say. But suddenly he was very aware of how tiny the closet was and how close the two boys stood. He couldn’t think straight.
- Of course not! Look, Draco liked Harry before. He just needed a little push. And an excuse in case it went wrong. But now that I'm thinking about it, it makes sense that he didn't tell Harry. Merlin, I'm such an idiot!
Harry frowned.
'What on Merlin's beard happened today?' Harry asked, pinning Draco against the wall, his hand next to the blond's hair.
When, a few seconds later, Draco laughed at something Pansy said, Harry decided there was no point in denying to himself his attraction to the blond. Of course, he would never mention it to Ron or Hermione or anyone else, but he had kind of always had a crush on his enemy. And it really made him question whether or not he should go to the ‘Slytherin party’ that night. Obviously, his common sense was screaming at him not to go. At worst, it was a trap and a certain death awaited him. At best, it was an actual party, and he would only embarrass himself. But he couldn’t help thinking that Draco would be there…
'Hey,' she said. 'It's gonna be okay. He'll get out eventually.'
‘Shit,’ he said, ‘Potter, you completely ruined my best shirt!’
'Isn't that a bit... extreme?' someone asked.
Draco's first thought was that Pansy and Hermione had definitely heard Harry and that if they opened the door and found Draco here they would understand he was eavesdropping on them. So he quickly grabbed Harry, opened the first door he saw and went inside with him.
'Why would you do that?' the blond finally asked.
They stayed in that closet for longer than necessary, and came out as soon as they realized how weird it was.
Most of the time, the two boys would just wander around, searching for hidden doors or passageways, and then, on the evenings, cuddle near the fire in the Gryffindor common room.
'That's the thing, though. Pansy knows I love PDAs. Which is why she was suspicious in the first place.'
“Yeah, Draco; This year’s been absolutely brilliant.”
Harry turns his head to meet Draco’s gaze, smiling as he recognizes happiness and contentment in his friend’s grey orbs. Harry returns the sentiment, hoping the intensity of his feelings will shine through.
Harry quickly retreats to his room. Exhausted from the day, hoping to get some sleep, he closes his eyes to the sound of scraping silverware on plates.
“He will not be sleeping with my son, I won't allow it! I don't want my son to catch his Freakishness” Vernon bellowed, ignoring the two sleeping babes in the house.
A/N: We hope you guys enjoyed this chapter. We understand it's long but it was surprisingly a lot in what seems like such a short time when reading/watching it yourself. 2 more chapters left! If you guys can't tell we are excited about ending the first book. Thanks for reading!
Much Love,
Parseltongue: {Blah. Blah. Blah.}
It has been a week since he spoke to his Aunt and Uncle about Hogwarts. The subject has not been brought up since. He sometimes wonders if it even happened at all. Maybe Dudley’s assumption wasn’t all that far off. Maybe he had gone mad. But no, the healing cut on his left temple and the hateful glares he’s been receiving from the others in the house are proof enough. They said no. He’s trapped. Forever. Bloody fantastic.

Until it was easier to yell and point fingers for minimal things— a mug left unwashed, a curtain that stayed wide open during the night— because it was easier to address the fixable than to face the deep embedded abyss that had grown between them and was impossible to fill. Easier to sneer and to just-…
, but won’t ever be able to erase it.
So, he begins to wonder where exactly they went wrong. When.
He mattered even when words weren’t spoken, mattered even when Draco wasn’t holding his hand. Mattered even to the point Draco would listen to songs that Harry could recite the lyrics of during his sleep and make a playlist that could translate

Though you’re sure the emptiness didn’t really begin there, and it’s just too heavy to restrict it within your chest.
But feelings are very rarely rational.

Terrifying. You’re terrified. Feeling lost, in a maze (
There’s nothing else as important as to cherish the now-wrinkled list, Harry supposes exhilarated, hysteric in a quiet, silent way. Inside, he feels like the crumbling of empires was too little compared to this; that the rise and fall of whole civilizations ends just short of having a magnitude big enough to make him feel on the edge of a limbo, like this forgotten paper does. And it’s easy. He’d forgotten how easy it always seems if Draco is one of the variables on the equation.
You close your eyes.

And Draco wrote their names, their performers. Draco made a list out of them and every list has
This time, when he reaches for the list, his fingers have ceased trembling. The scars of too much strength used are jagged marks on the side, a little inkless storm that has left charred stone fuming with the smell ozone. The cursive still burns right through him, but heat can cauterize wounds, so this won’t be any different.
And because he’s already walking towards it, he decides to drag this a little more.
Don’t walk forward-
You’re nothing.
And yours is already written down. And you- want,
At some point, you get up. Your joints ache, but it barely registers because you feel like you’re not even there to begin with, like somehow something went wrong, and you’ve disconnected from yourself. But you keep pushing yourself up, ignore your friend as she carefully, worriedly reaches out for you, and walk to your room where you won’t need to

He pushes the paper away, until it’s just another leftover list on the chaotic coffee table. Until it’s out of sight, easily blended with other sheets he has gone through before and committed to memory, to the point he could make out the slight pressure Draco adds on the punctuation marks, the way every time he signs his name his letter shrinks minimally, how the points on top of his ‘i’s’ are less like dots and more like empty circles. He could read a scribble and recognize fragments of Draco in each letter and written mannerism.
If only there weren’t too many things left unsaid. If only he didn’t have regrets,
Walk away. Move somewhere unknown, leaving behind memoirs of his brilliant mind always craving for knowledge. Lists that spoke of his need to organize his thoughts though nothing on his silent exterior would tell anyone of how chaotic and loud they could get. Little shards that now stick to Harry’s skin and pierce deep enough they can’t be removed anymore, no matter it’s been so long the image of Draco is softer around the edges, like an old painting fading under the flow of time.

He never looks back. He’s above you and not in the ways you want but in the ways that- perhaps- that…
And you look at him because, at the end of the day, you’ve always been looking at him from the moment you met and lost yourself from the moment you met and will never find yourself again because now you’re nothing.
It doesn’t surprise him anymore, but it that doesn’t stop him from feeling frustrated and restless, far too much of a stranger on his own skin. Knowing it was unhealthy, he still went and made of Draco the brightest star on his own system and dedicated himself to revolve around him. Now that the light is gone, he struggles to find where to go, where to put his feet to walk forward safely. And reminding himself it’s been months doesn’t do anything but beat him down, because everyone told him he was strong and yet here he is, and he doesn’t feel any strength left.
So, when he looks to the paper, to the words that he
With the way he’s reacting with a measly list, if he saw Draco right in front of him, fuming or not, he’s sure he wouldn’t make it. It’s like a punch to the gut, to realize that the memory he holds so close may no longer brush reality like it did when they parted. And by that he means… well, whatever can be said about getting home to an empty closet, his boyfriend (ex
You look at him, but he doesn’t ever look back because this is all your fault and you know it and you can’t fix it and the war is over outside but in your head you still hear loud loud screaming and see an evil evil man and feel his bony bony fingers and taste bitter bitter ashes and smell cold cold death. And the war is over outside but you look at him, at his green green eyes and you see they’re haunted with other curses, and other men, and other fingers, and other ashes, and other deaths.
But you never are. You’re a void, an empty spot. You’re no one. And you know it.

You feel light, not like those feelings you dared name love. You don’t leap knowing you’ll fall, you fall knowing a leap wouldn’t make a difference and it’s like flying without a broomstick and it’s warm where you previously stood so cold and you turn to the side, to the merman looking at you with a goodbye upon his lips and you smile and remember because you’re fading away and it’s finally freedom and you

Still, no matter how many breaths he takes, how much air swirls around within his lungs, staring at the words is like waiting for the sun to rise after centuries of dusk. He can’t help the overwhelming wave of yearning laced with venomous remorse that hooks around his heart and has him lowering the paper once more, falling harder against the couch, hoping he sinks low enough no one will be able to pull him out. And again, fantasies of what would happen had Draco been here, no doubt letting his gray eyes shine with mirth in a way only he ever realized, come faster than they should. He’d probably stand behind him, elbows on the back of the couch, peering over his shoulder with a soft smirk, more amused than malicious. He’d brush lips softened with watermelon chapstick on the arch of his cheekbone, bury his nose on his curls, let a careful hand wander to his shoulder in veiled comfort. Snap a “Get on with it, Potter” under his breath with nothing but unending patience and an equal amount of encouragement.

), and sobs like a little child, wide-eyed as the doctors talk in hushed tones to his godfather, moving closer to Remus’s comforting chest hoping if he gathers enough warmth, the walls will stop feeling so cold. Sobs like he hasn’t sobbed in months, chokes on tears and air and feels himself plunge into an abyss within, the unhealed, empty space he refused to poke at, love shaped.
Almost like Draco is behind him, like that one memory rising from longing and loneliness he had clung onto earlier, with sharp elbows digging into the fabric of the couch, a scent that lingers past the barriers of cherished recollections, and a touch just as warm and sticky that leaves a pink smirk-shaped mark behind, Harry hears the soft encouragement again, soft, so soft his fingertips tingle with brushes of velvet. And his directed focus isn’t the only thing Draco got with an ease it was laughable. Anything he asked— and it wasn’t much because no matter what he believed, Harry never saw him as selfish and he never acted as such. Spoiled and selfish aren’t the same thing, and that Harry
Harry examines the hard set of Draco’s jaw and the coldness in his eyes before deciding to give into his best friend’s request. He backs up a few steps, just enough to give Draco his space, but not enough to keep him from being able to get to Draco in time if anything happens.

Hope you enjoyed this chapter!
A/N: Hey guys, we are sorry this was so late. We were having trouble about where to go with the chapter among other things. We have decided that the story has to go on a temporary hiatus as we determine where we want the story to go. We are writing as we go as you can probably tell. WE ARE NOT ABANDONING THE STORY!! We just need a while to get the story in order. If you have any suggestions as to what you want to see in the future, be it between two characters or certain outcomes, let us know. We are going to edit the story when it is completely finished so if ya'll have any suggestions about changes from the past chapters we would like to know as well.
Thank you to everyone who's been reading! I am going to be out of town for the next few weeks and am not sure if I will have service. If I do then this story will continue on its normal update schedule. If not then I will post the chapters for the weeks I was gone as soon as I get back. Thank you again and as always, comments, questions, and suggestions are welcome.
