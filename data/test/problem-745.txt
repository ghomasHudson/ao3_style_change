If she's surprised, she doesn't show it. All she does is lean forward a little bit more from her position behind Luna's empty chair, which is directly opposite of Harry's and Hermione's. "Oh? Do you know Draco personally, then?"
“That’s all we wanted to say,” Prasad says, cheeriness filling their round face once more. “Happy birthday!” They file out, and leave the door open. From the sitting room, Draco hears Harry compliment Amira’s cloak.
“You have no choice,” he whispers fiercely into Draco’s ear, “You have to. For the orphanage. For the kids. The Aurors will protect them. I promise.” Draco shakes in Harry’s arms. “I promise.”
Shaking his head in amusement, Harry obliges and places a foot on the ice - charmed to be able to skate effectively, of course.
Harry takes a seat on the couch right behind Draco, and begins massaging his shoulders. “What happened?”
It’s then that Harry realizes that he’s been so busy watching Draco that he hasn’t had more than a few bites to eat yet. Hurriedly, he stuffs some meat slices and potatoes in his mouth, chews, then swallows. “It’s pretty good, actually. I like it.” He isn’t even lying.
"Maybe McGonagall is trying to introduce a few bits of Muggle culture..." Though why so many students would be interested remains a mystery to Harry. The War may be over, but prejudices remain as difficult as ever to let go.
Harry Potter shoots to his feet, along with hundreds of other witches and wizards, and claps as loudly as he can manage. On the stage, Hermione’s smiling and posing for a photo with Kingsley, and hanging around her neck is the Kingsley Shacklebolt Medal for Extraordinary Dedication to Equality between Creature, Muggle, and Wizardkind.
He beckons Draco to come, his face joyous like the whistling wind. “Come on! We can get back like this.”
Blood drains from Harry’s face, and a quick glance over to Malfoy sitting at the end of the table confirms that he’s similarly pale. The insinuation has caught them off guard - especially since it’s completely plausible. The line between exercise-induced exhaustion and sexual debauchery is very fine indeed.
Hagrid tries his best to explain it to Harry, but the half-giant doesn’t have a good enough grasp on the topic himself so his efforts are in vain. At the end of his explanation, all Harry can gather is that there’s magic in music somehow.
“Oh, it is,” Draco interrupts him, “It’s obvious, and so stereotypical - the poor, Golden Saviour, who thinks he needs to make everyone else’s dreams come true.”
“My mother has the rest of him. I haven’t spoken to her in a long time. I don’t-” Draco falters for a moment, but pushes on. “-I don’t know what to say.”
Harry Potter opens his mouth to say something else, but Neville Longbottom interrupts him: “A-are you here for a tour as well, Malfoy?”
A bit annoyed with himself for not thinking forward enough, Harry begrudgingly joins the back of the line and sinks into his coat, seeking warmth.
“Harry!” It’s Teddy, yellow-eyed and blue hair styled into an elaborate braid. “Come in, quick! I’m about to beat Draco at chess!”
"And it's even worse since both of us were so involved. I've seen a lot of relationships between survivors where it's gone wrong. They hurt each other just by being together."
Harry doesn't try to dodge it this time - only turning around to let the snow hit his back. Luckily, he doesn't feel much through his coat other than a soft thud of impact, but he suspects it'll be a different story once they accumulate and soak through. He has to be careful and win this game quickly.
“Are you going to be here for the rest of the week?” Sophia asks while opening up the physics textbook.
Kingsley continues. "I just have a few updates: one, we've been getting dozens of anonymous tips about Muggle attacks all over England, but they seem to all be false. We're assuming their strategy is to spread our resources as thin as possible. For the time being, we're closing off the anonymous option when sending us tips and posting Auror trainees around the country to call in reinforcements in case one of the tips ends up being true."
“Surprise!” A shower of sparks, green and silver, rain over Draco and settle like stars on his cloak.
Harry starts running too, but makes it a point to head straight for the smirking, blonde git. "I'll cover you!" He yells to his teammate.
“I would love to, Potter, but I’m afraid I cannot. With spring approaching, I am going to be quite busy here.”
“This isn’t a competition. Awful things happened to me, so I need help. Awful things happened to you, too, and so you also need help.”
"It's quite an unusual path," Arthur says, "I'd be very interested in reading your research sometime."
With Edwards' compliance, it only takes another day and a half to track down and arrest all of the higher ups in the neo-Death Eater organization. Ron leads most of the raids, and Hermione's so ecstatic about it all that she cuts out a photo of him from
It doesn’t help that Harry is one of only two people of color working there - the other being Kingsley, but the literal Minister of Magic has his own responsibilities to take care of and can’t micromanage the actions of individual Aurors.
“Uh?” Draco says, somehow still gracefully. When he stands, he’s so wobbly that he just collapses on Harry. “I’m t-i-i-red,” he whines in Harry’s ear. His breath sends shivers sprinting up and down his spine.
"The Death Eaters, they came to recruit me," he gasps. "I didn't want to, but after the arson, I was afraid. Please, Robards, Minister, you have to understand - my wife is pregnant. I couldn't-I didn't-"
"I'm....alright." Draco's voice doesn't sound upset or frightened. On the contrary, he sounds quite calm, and other than for the flush in his cheeks and the rapid rise of his chest as he catches his breath, there's no other indication that he just went through a near-death experience. "Nothing hurts, at least."
“I’m gonna get you for that one.” Harry calls as Draco dashes out of the room, towards the stairs, his light laughter floating through the house.
“I think that’s it.” Harry sets the last scroll down next to the neatly stacked pile he and Malfoy have created.
Heat rises to his cheeks. “It’s really...nice.” And it really is. The atmosphere is quiet, intimate, practically engineered for romantic dates. It also helps that there aren’t many patrons on a Tuesday night, so the staff seems relaxed and content and the ambient conversation never gets too loud. Harry sips on his glass of ice water to give his hands something to do.
The curtains are still drawn tight, so the room is dark and cool, but it's beginning to feel suffocating rather than comforting. With a wave of his hand, Harry uses wandless magic for the first time in a month to open the curtains. Light floods in. It's not snowing, but the clouds have gathered close in the sky, hinting at it. In the distance, Harry sees the roofs of his neighbor's house - all mostly frozen over and covered in snow. Their trees have lost all their leaves, and now their naked branches stand out in dark brown dashes, hooks, and exclamations stark against the white snow.
curse the Friday before last. I don't think I need to say this, but this is nearing an emergency situation - and not just because he escaped."
“Books here, Potter,” Malfoy commands Harry with a finger jabbing at an empty spot on his desk at the front of the room. He has already set down the paperbacks and is deftly unbuttoning the top buttons of his robe and unwinding the scarf coiled around his neck.
"His work with music is especially interesting," Hermione adds. Then, her smiles fades and slips off her face until she just looks sad. "Harry. What are you thinking?"
“Take me here. Spill me everywhere. I don’t want this.” Draco clutches the vial tighter. “I want something different.”
For the rest of the Ministry, it's just a regular Tuesday. The statue-fountain of the 'Golden Trio' gurgles freely and the receptionist practically breaks his hand waving at Harry and trying to get his attention, like always. When he steps off on the Auror Department's level, however, is when hell breaks loose.
After supper, as students and professors alike bid farewell before retiring for the night, Harry watches Malfoy slip away in the direction of the Slytherin common room. Harry follows behind him, trying to figure out what to say.
“It’s fine.” He smiles at her and lifts the baby out of her arms. “It’s the perfect chance for me to spend more time with the little ones.”
Harry tightens his embrace. Draco is warm. The room is warm. The sun has set and fog hasn’t quite lifted, but there is still something burning, here, between them.
There are no major content warnings for this work, though if you are sensitive to themes of grief, maybe give this fic a pass.
"Thank Merlin you're alright." Ron sits on Harry's bed and leans over and gives him a tight hug. "You're lucky i haven't told 'Mione yet."
“I’ll owl you,” he promises, cringing internally at what this looks like. He hopes the barista isn’t paying attention anymore.
“We’re friends from school,” Hermione explains to her brightly. “The rest of the group are three other of his peers and my in-laws.”
Hermione stands up and heads for the door. She’s dressed already as well, in a velvet-looking black dress that goes down to her knees, but has a diamond cutout on her chest. “I’m going to check on Ron.”
Finally, he takes out the bulk of the supplies: the food. Although dragons are more than capable of hunting for themselves, dragon caretakers prepare a special meal for newborns. The pellets, although unassuming, are packed with essential nutrients, and have proved to be so beneficial that the adult dragons at Snowdonia allow it. And since baby dragons are born with teeth, they can eat it with no problems.
When Harry turns his head, Malfoy’s sitting on the couch beside him with glasses on and not much else. “Harry.” He’s holding a bundle of fabric - his clothes.
Fang’s successor, Cane, hears Harry before Hagrid does; he paws and whines at the door, already smelling and recognizing his friend.
Harry wonders how Draco is doing, but never owls him. He hopes that he's okay. That the children and Pat are doing okay as well. He wonders how they're carrying on with their lives even after everything they’ve known has turned into ash. Sometimes he even envies them; at least they have a concrete reason to want to cry, to want to disappear.
They sit, unspeaking, for a little while. Something cold has settled around them, like an autumn fog.
Harry tightens his grip on Draco’s hands. “I don’t know either. Family just...can be weird.” Harry thinks about Aunt Petunia, Uncle Dursley, and Dudley. After they reconnected with him and asked for forgiveness two years ago, Harry has since been able to cultivate the saplings of a familial relationship with them - even to the point of inviting them to his and Draco’s wedding - but it hasn’t been all sunshine and flowers. It’s taken hard work and at least a dozen tearful breakdowns in Draco’s arms.
“I’m proud of you,” Harry says, the last part of his sentence getting muffled as he presses his mouth to Draco’s still-wet cheek.
"How did you find this place?" Harry breathes as they slide into their seats and the waitress hands them their menus.
Harry’s initial plan was to remain until Christmas Eve - Friday - all along, so “Yeah. Until the end of this week.”
Malfoy and Harry spend the next fifteen or so minutes chatting about the details of the situation in hushed tones - even though the Muggles around them wouldn’t understand or even care. Malfoy is an attentive, engaging listener, and the more he learns about the neo-Death Eaters and their movement, the deeper the furrow in his brow gets.
The seabirds call and call - waiting for an answer. “He wasn’t a good man,” Draco says. “He wasn’t a good man, and he wasn’t a good husband or father, and hardly anyone is sad to see him gone, but-”
When Harry speaks again, the words come slowly, “We separated on good terms. She and I both realized certain things about ourselves and decided that we were better off as friends.”
Harry replies on reflex, “Can’t next week, ‘m helping Hagrid out over at Hogwarts. For Christmas decorating.”
This time, when Malfoy closes the door, he’s waving Harry goodbye with a stiff smile and blush on his face.
"I understand," Hermione says, nodding her head in empathy. Harry feels similarly - although he and Hermione need to don disguises for reasons other than Draco's, they're all under the same risk of public scrutiny.
It’s completely frozen over - ice maybe six or seven feet thick - and the afternoon sunlight glints off of it. Footprints and imprints of faces and bodies in the snow indicate that Malfoy wasn’t the first to have the same idea, but there doesn't seem to be any students around right now.
Harry's drawn to the crowd gathered at the left wall and when he draws near he can make out what the banner on the wall reads: 'Draco Malfoy's Benefit Concert for the Harmony Orphanage; Donate Here.' The Muggles are gathered around the table directly below it, which is being manned by the club owner - Belle, Harry remembers to be her name.
They skate silently for a few seconds before Malfoy speaks again. “Do you feel comfortable sharing?”
Harry bites and drops the topic. "Er....I actually didn't see him while I was there, but Hagrid said he was doing well. He's living in the forest for the winter.
After a moment, he hears the rubber turning of her chair. “You’re going to be just fine, Draco. Just fine,” she says, before leaving - the turning of the wheels tapping its metal rhythm.
“Lake Traws is not a natural lake,” Draco explains as they kayak across its surface, riddled with raindrops. “Muggles designed this, filled it, to be their water source.”
Same floppy hair, maybe a little thinned out now, same round eyes, same broad shoulders. The one thing Harry can’t verify to be the same is his smile, mainly because Neville’s
She nods, hops off his lap, and follows her gang of noisy cousins into the kitchen. Hermione and Ron stand and Ron looks back on them before going through the archway. "You two coming?"
Draco rubs his face. "What I'm trying to say is - it would be easy for us to fall back into our old habits. And to enable each other. Which is not what I want out of this."
“Will you come with me to gather my belongings first? It’s just two trunks. I hope it’s not an imposition to stay overnight, but since I’m moving out anyways…”
Although he told Ron he was sober earlier, the truth is that he still feels dizzy and slow. And he can’t really tell if his slight feeling of out-of-bodyness is actual dissociation or just his brain reacting to the leftover alcohol.
Malfoy turns his head to look at Harry. He looks amused, though Harry’s isn’t sure what’s so funny. “The snow is so obvious on you.”
"Is Draco still asleep?" The question seems innocuous, but as soon as he mentions Draco, Harry can sense all of the adults in the room perk up with interest.
Draco tries to push it out of his mind. Amira called on her wife, Julie Khanyile - one of the only licensed dragon veterinarians on the Isles - and she should be arriving today. Her expertise, combined with Amira’s and Draco’s experience, should be enough to ensure all is well with the clutch.
Harry doesn’t know what to do, what to say, so he just stands awkwardly to the side and watches the entire exchange.
“Everyone,” Draco continues, feeling pleased with himself, “Weasley, Granger, Longbottom, Lovegood, Thomas, Finnigan. And Ginevra.”
Their objective is pretty simple: catch the Snitch. With the magic wards in place, there's no chance of it escaping from the Weasley property, but it also means Harry and Draco have a smaller space to work with, which might result in more intense, cutthroat competition - not like they needed more of that or anything.
Their group sits on the unoccupied side of the table, and Hermione and Ron pull Rose onto their laps to squeeze in. Harry does the same to Lucy, who's once again stuck to his side. Draco sits to Harry’s left, close enough so that their shoulders touch a bit.
In the middle of what seems to be a continuation of their game of "House" from last night, Draco stops to examine a pile of untouched packages in the corner.
“You’re a good guy. I never once stopped believing that. And, the truth is, I’ve been asking after you from time to time. Hermione’s been keeping me in the loop. It sounds like you’ve been having a tough time.”
Harry takes the hint and nods, though secretly uncertain that he’ll be able to make it tomorrow, either. “Yeah. Be careful.” With a wave, he’s off, walking briskly through the halls, heading for Kingsley’s office.
Friday afternoon, after the students’ presentations of their final papers - Sophia and Lucas doing especially well, at least in Harry’s opinion - Harry and Malfoy agree to a class snowball fight as a celebration of the course’s success. Also because the students asked so politely, clearly eager to spend as much time as possible with Malfoy before he leaves.
"It's the afternoon now," he snaps, "I'm here instead of taking my lunch break. So you better talk."
With a slight shudder, all three of them think back on when they told Molly about Rose. It was during Christmas, which was their first mistake, and it was after a lot of wine - which was their second.
“Er.” Though he’s groaning internally at the prospect of his vacation ending, Harry forces a smile. “Yep.”
"I hope so," she says as she begins to peel back the paper. "I hope it's in green this time." Green is her favorite color.
His Mind Healer told him during their first session together - after Harry spent thirty minutes hashing out, then backtracking through his own memories - “You love them, Harry, I can see that from the way you keep trying to protect them. But the truth is, I’m not here to pass judgement on what they did. That has to come from you. My job is to make you feel safe enough to do so.”
They wash the dishes together, like usual, shoulders touching. And afterwards, Draco leads Harry to the couch and sits both of them down.
Draco is glaring at him now, tears still leaking out of his eyes. “You think I ha-haven’t already thought of that? When they throw me in Azkaban wh-who will help
"Me too. We should try to meet up with Draco and congratulate him, at least." Hermione thinks for a minute and exclaims, "Oh! We didn't bring flowers."
"How can I?" Robards all but roars. "It's probably thanks to this fucker that this circus has dragged on for so long." He rounds on Harry. "Did you know about this?"
"There's much the Wizarding community can learn from Muggle science, I believe. It has a lot of overlap with magic."
He’s dressed in a simple black tuxedo this time - no sequins, no loud colors. Is Harry imagining things, or has he lost weight? The jut of his cheekbones seems sharper and his waist seems smaller.
He drops his hand and gives Harry a glare, but ultimately fails to hide his smile. "You’re insufferable."
The audience responds to him with vigor, quite a few of them shouting out "Great!" "Well!" or even just letting out a long, high whistle.
Leo, Virgo, Libra, Draco names, teaching Harry their names and tracing their shapes on the back of his hand. He conjures for him the story of mighty Perseus, Gorgon Slayer. Draco details his journey back - how Perseus caught sight of the maiden Andromeda, chained to a rock at sea, and slew the sea serpent Cetes to marry her. He draws for Harry their constellations, how they will wheel side by side forever: a collection of stars, disparate, but facing each other.
Overhead, Draco’s namesake twists on as it always has, but when Draco opens his eyes, he swears it’s changed. The stars that make it what it is - moved.
“Er-yes.” He adds quickly, “It’s alright, this was my fault, so I apologize. I didn’t plan for enough time for us to catch up and I have to be somewhere soon.”
“Does she visit often?” Harry wonders if this is dangerous territory, but his curiosity gets the best of him.
But Harry can see Malfoy’s arms trembling under his robes and hear the tension in his voice - naturally, he points it out.
Harry and Malfoy step inside, careful to avoid the letter blocks strewn across the linoleum. The woman waves them over to what seems to be a sitting room that was repurposed into a large playroom before disappearing up the stairs, the cries of the baby bouncing off the walls and echoing around the house.
Draco - the man - pulls on his gloves: his treasured, wickedly useful gift from Harry, and begins to work. He feels almost a dozen pairs of eyes on him, half dragon and half-human, but he refuses to falter. Slowly and methodically, he takes the first into his lap and begins chipping away - holding it between his legs like the notes instructed. Piece by jagged piece, the shell comes apart, and once there is a hole big enough, Draco punctures the sac within, and the baby, along with all the fluid, comes spilling into his arms.
"Musical Theory. The class focused on my own research surrounding music and its roots in and effects on magic."
"It's alright," Draco says, offering up a weak smile. Though it's the dead of winter, beads of perspiration trickles down from Malfoy's hairline and onto his forehead.
He snaps the notebook shut and slides it back into his bag. "Thank you so much. You have no idea how much that will help me."
Unfortunately, it looks like Harry’s several year long-streak of successfully avoiding Neville will end soon. He tries to channel the sudden shaking of his hands into sipping his tea and petting Cane, whose eyes are getting droopy.
The next morning, Harry wakes up comfortable and warm in his sheets and surprisingly refreshed. When he throws open the dusty curtains, he’s surprised to find that snow had fallen overnight.
Draco’s fingers twitch in his pocket out of habit, but of course he leaves it when he needs it the most. “I’m working, Potter.”
Done with inspecting the tree, Luna bounces over and sits on the couch with them. Ginny pulls her into her lap and the two share a tender kiss. Harry looks away.
Kingsley opens his mouth to speak, but Robards cuts him off, visibly irritated now. Sometimes, Harry swears he just gets off by riling people up and then debating them. "It would cause massive panic. Muggles wouldn't know what to do with the information - look at what happened when we told them about Sirius Black all those years ago. Their Prime Minister couldn't do anything! And during the Second War, too! Muggles can't defend themselves against magic!"
Harry sighs too. "Fine. I understand." He really does, but understanding doesn't stop him from feeling a little bitter. "Are you just here to check up on me?"
For the first time the entire night, anxiety shows up in Draco's face and he suddenly looks every bit as exhausted as he probably feels. "How did you do it? Protect everyone you love and still save the world?"
“And I know this isn’t an excuse, just a reason, but I pushed you away because...I was afraid. Of disappointing you.” Harry takes a deep breath. “Because I was turning into someone I wasn’t proud of, I thought it would be better if you...weren’t around. To see it.”
Supper passes peacefully. Professor Gill, who joined the staff only a year ago, is easy-going and a never-ending well of good conversation. They explain to Harry their research into Wolfsbane and its scores of properties still unknown to Potion Masters around the world. A few students summon the courage to approach Harry for autographs on their copy of the final volume of Harry Potter’s seven-volume biography and he obliges.
He sits up, and with one hand on Longbottom’s shoulder, gently shakes him awake. Longbottom grumbles and wipes at his eyes.
In the back of his mind, he's aware that he hasn't spoken to Ron or Hermione in a long time. Or Draco. Or anyone.
He holds up a hand and Harry’s mouth swings shut. “It was a War orphanage, Harry. And the casualty report has yet to arrive.”
“Even if you’re with the love of your life?” Harry asks. In some of Draco’s ex-boyfriends’ mouths, the question would be a trap laid at his feet, ready to sink in its metal teeth and never let go. But Harry is empty-handed, and the ground is flush only with grass.
Arthur and Molly start levitating the empty plates and dishes back into the kitchen, clearing the table. While flicking her wand, Molly asks, "You're going for the grand opening, right?"
Coincidentally, it’s zem who speaks up next, interrupting Kingsley. “If I could, Minister.” Kingsley nods to signal that ze can continue to speak. “Even if this is the case, I still suggest a warning of some kind. And then a request for the most vulnerable areas - the Muggle streets and neighborhoods with high traffic, or something similar. In fact, I have reason to believe that intel from our field agents may provide clues to their first target. Protecting people should be - and
music genre). He wants Draco to look that way at him; he wants to please him. He clears his throat and digs into his mashed potatoes, feeling his face heat up.
Malfoy meets her in the middle and they shake hands. "Good game," he repeats to her with a warm smile on his face.
“Harry.” Neville’s face is frightening. It’s unmoving, unreadable, like stone. “You’re an absolute bastard, you know that?” And then he storms out.
Robards moves on to the next group. "Hughes and Edwards, both of you too will continue the work you've been doing with researching the group as well as looking into whether or not similar movements abroad are in contact with Jack Willows' people." Harry can't help but to stiffen at the mention of Keith Edwards. He's nothing but a bloody wanker with a death wish, and Harry is close to granting it for him. Edwards' partner may be Mackenzie Hughes, a well-mannered woman who pays attention even at the 9AM staff meetings, but he's closer with a group of other cronies of his - most of them white, male field agents - who regularly go around the office terrorizing people - mainly focusing on Harry. He's a bigot and a bully, and the fact that Robards still keeps him around and protects him is testament enough to his own character.
“Not that I blame you. Many have had your exact reaction. It’s the War Orphanage that I was assigned to volunteer at as part of my sentence, ten years ago. Though most of the kids have aged out. Now, it’s mostly a normal orphanage.” With one fluid motion Malfoy brings his coffee to his lips.
Draco buries his head in his pillow, and when he speaks, his voice is muffled. “Just...answer the question.”
exactly she thinks Harry would be worrying about, she doesn’t say. But rather than demand an explanation, Harry simply says, “Okay.” The fire crackles in the fireplace. “Sorry,” he tries to rub away the sudden weariness from his face, “Had a rough day at work today. I didn’t mean to drive him away.”
Hours fly, and the sun slides down, down, down, until it kisses the earth once more. They arrive at a small plateau, the grass here wild and thick, and settle in - the group of men visibly relieved.
The mountains, the rivers, the sea - all these places that have and will always exist - will take him in, and at least one part of Draco will last.
That night, they gather in Draco’s cottage to play Muggle cards - poker, mostly, though they switch to Old Maid after everyone takes pity on Longbottom’s losing streak. The rain has mostly abated, though thunder still strikes out in the valley from time to time, an open threat.
Before Ginny can respond, a few more adults straggle in, bleary-eyed and no doubt very hungover: Molly, Arthur, and Fleur. Harry's ambient headache throbs in solidarity with theirs.
It feels like his intestines are uncoiling. It feels like his heart is about to burst through his chest.
“I don’t want this class to consist of just lecture. You all get enough of that the rest of the year. I want this class to be interactive.” Malfoy starts passing out the textbooks and paperbacks. “It’s one thing for me to explain my research, but it’s another thing altogether for you to
They will come when they come, Draco reminds himself. He stashes the rest of the invoices in the desk drawer and bangs it shut. He sighs, and when his eyes inevitably snap to the blistering outside, that agonizing blue of sky, he sees it.
Harry says little, but he doesn’t have to. The way he looks down at Draco, the way he whispers a word, and a spell gently dries his hair and clothes, is enough.
"No, no, no," Ginny snatches the pair of trousers from his hands and thrusts what looks to Harry to be an identical pair into his arms to replace it, "These are much better."
“Don’t,” Draco whispers, closing his eyes. That old pain, so old it’s like the ground on which Draco walks. Transparent and fragile: a bed of glass flowers.
A moan escapes Draco's mouth at that, and he clutches at the back of Harry's shirt. "Thank Merlin. Thank God."
But the dragons are flying. And he has work again - hard work collecting manure and feeding the fledglings and wrestling thermometers into dragon mouths. Draco writes his mother, telling her he’s happy, and he is - really, he is. Because what was he expecting, anyways? Harry Potter is over there, and Draco Malfoy is over here, and that’s always how it’s been.
So with a heavy heart, Harry owled Andromeda letting her know that he couldn’t visit and tried to focus on his work.
"Stop the fort!" Stella yells from across the playing field. She ducks to avoid a snowball to the face and sends one right back at her opponent in retaliation. It lands perfectly.
But the Muggles in the club don't seem confused at all. They nod and rock and tap their foot just like they did in the first half, and if Harry were just judging from their reactions, he would think that nothing had changed at all. But something had.
Their family has been active recently - their parents, their uncle and aunt and grandfather, all alighting one by one on the beach. Hatchings are a delicate time. As a caretaker, Draco must ensure their safety during the event, but he can only approach the nest alone, and under the close supervision of a half a dozen anxious, fire-breathing dragons. Thus, most of the set up - the food and the baths and towels for washing - must be prepared beforehand, off site, and then transported there the day-of. And no one, not even the family, knows the exact day.
Harry ponders his argument, which seems logical, but it still makes his gut twist.  But since Malfoy's asking....
And Harry knows he’s the same way, knows from all the lazy mornings he’s spent tracing them that they have the same crow’s feet and smile lines. The same soft thighs and stomachs. The same gray.
She raises her voice slightly for the first time the entire conversation. “Because you scared the shit out of us and we don’t want it to ever happen again!”
Harry cracks his eyes open and sees the vague silhouette of a house elf hovering over him in the semi-dark.
They glance up from the desk, peering through each glass wall. “They’re really taking their time, aren’t they?”
“What did you just say, dear?” Molly inquires. The whole family’s listening in now, and Harry can almost feel secondhand pressure.
But right as he hesitates, his mind races, the house lights dim. "Oh! It's starting," Ava passes Harry the drinks. "You should go sit. We can talk afterwards."
He's the first one out of the office when five o'clock rolls around. As he passes his coworkers' cubicles, he peeks in and sees them sitting on the floor, robes off, stuffing their faces with a quick supper while poring over reports. A few cubicles are completely empty, untouched. Ron's is a veritable mess, but Harry can't tell if it's any more so than usual. With some effort, Harry forces himself to keep moving.
It has never stopped being weird for them to be close to each other or interact after the divorce, but it's definitely a Harry-specific problem. Ginny was never truly in love with him - that's what she told him when she filed for divorce. It was understandable, as she was always only into girls, but Harry isn't gay, and he, at least, was in love. So it stung. And it still stings a little bit - even now, all these years later. But being with her as a friend and as a family member causes significantly less anguish for him now than it used to, so he counts that as a win.
But suddenly, a desperate scream comes all the way from the other side of the playing field - from their fort, Harry quickly realizes with horror. "Don't retreat! Don't retreat! Wands taken!"
“Merlin.” Harry rubs his face wearily. “Mind helping me up?” Ron obliges and the two just stand in the bathroom, leaning side by side on the counter for a while.
When Harry steps off the lift onto his floor, he's greeted with what has become a familiar sight the past few months; a department in chaos, papers strewn everywhere, Patronuses darting in and out of the walls, delivering important information left and right, and a few Aurors sleeping on makeshift beds that Robards had no choice but to cram in the main lobby area due to the sheer number of Aurors who have had to sleep over at work. A few of them wave to him as he passes - one of them being Ron.
"Uh?" Harry's head jerks up, startled by the question. "Y-yeah. I'm fine. But how come I can't wear jeans? They're comfortable!"
They walk in silence for a little bit. Up ahead, the rest of the class are chatting animatedly with Malfoy. Sophia is with them, but every now and then she’ll glance back at Lucas and Harry.
He does just that. And then they spend the next thirty or so minutes teaching the basics of flying to Rose - and ultimately to most of the other children, who, upon seeing her having so much fun, naturally want to join in. The adults leave for the warmth of the house as time goes on, all save for Hermione, Ron, Ginny, and Luna, who stand in a circle a little ways off, partly in conversation with each other, partly watching Draco and Harry and their impromptu flying workshop.
“Be my guest then. Please sort these alphabetically.” Malfoy doesn’t hesitate to push the scrolls into Harry’s arms. He breezes into the kitchen. “Would you like some tea?” he calls over his shoulder.
“What?!” She practically climbs into Draco’s lap in her eagerness to hear slander against Harry. “Really?!”
His eyes are blown wide, wide enough that Harry can see his own face reflected in its gray. Draco’s mouth hangs a little bit open, his cheeks, ears, neck - all red.
But the nerves are getting to him today, Harry supposes. He opens the fridge and cabinets and even pokes around in the pantry that he can never summon up enough courage to clean, hoping Kreacher has been secretly hoarding an emergency ration of cornflakes. No such luck. All Harry finds is a carton of eggs with only one remaining. Harry is considering frying it when Spotty clicks her claws against his window.
"But they're nice people," Draco adds thoughtfully, "Many of them have expressed interest in my research - not that I told them about it, but I’ve proposed the hypothetical to them."
However, before he has a chance to completely recover, another three snowballs fly one after the other in a perfect arc and hit his head, neck, and plumber's crack respectively. He hits the ground and squirms around in a desperate attempt to prevent the snow from intruding too deep into his pants. Harry whips around and sees Sophia standing there, casually tossing the fourth snowball up into the air and catching it with one hand. Behind her he sees the other team's offensive member she was facing off with; she's face down in the snow with her long, black hair spread out around her - unmoving.
Harry has to think for a little bit before answering. "I don't know. Something similar, I think - and I'm not just saying that. Grimmauld Place is a bit big for me. A cozier place might be a nice change of pace - something like Hagrid's hut could be nice, even."
“This will be our campsite for the next week.” Draco gestures to the middle cottage. “I will be staying there, and the other two have three beds each - however you would like to split yourselves. Get settled, and in an hour, meet back out here for supper. Let me know if you have any questions.” With that, Draco retires to his cottage and begins unpacking.
A sense of calm settles in the club. Faces relax and turn toward the light of the stage. Legs stop shaking and hands unclench. Even the baby is completely silent and still.
Molly picks up the conversation from where they left off. "So, Draco, how is working there? You must meet many interesting Muggles."
Rubbing his side, he rolls his eyes. "We didn't sneak off. I went to put him to bed. And we were both too drunk for that, anyways."
Huffing and red-faced, Longbottom pierces the silence, “A-are we really going to the peak? It seems like...like a long ways away.”
Malfoy yawns - he’s half-horizontal now, his head resting on the arm of the couch - and shifts his feet. “I think so too.” He holds up the last reading and Harry takes the hint and transfers it to the stack too.
The children ‘ooh’ and ‘aah’ at that, and their parents, the adult Weasleys, grin. What they know and the children don't of course, is that the Malfoy and Weasley families have been rivals and enemies for decades now, but to the children, the divide is an artifact of the past. Suddenly, Harry feels old.
"But what about work, Draco?" Ginny inquires casually. Before the War, such a question directed at any Malfoy would be wholly unusual - and even insulting - but everyone knows that most Malfoy assets were seized after 2/3rds of the immediate family were sentenced to Azkaban. The name no longer holds the weight it once did, and the media had a good time with that story for solid months.
"That's wonderful!" Fleur exclaims with a slight French accent, faint now after years spent in Britain.
“But Hermione told me something. She reminded me that we were all children, that you were just a child-”
“Good night then.” He slides off the arm of the couch and extinguishes the the flame of the candle on the coffee table. Harry hears him pause somewhere before reaching his room, and he strains to hear what he may be doing, but nothing comes. A moment of baited breath later, the door of Malfoy’s bedroom finally closes with a
Amira takes Harry to her office to finish up on some paperwork, giving Draco a chance to collect himself. When they finish, Amira instructs Draco to give Harry a tour. And so he does.
The car arrives, and pulls into the parking lot, out of sight. A door opens and slams, and the car locks with a chirp. Harry Potter walks into view.
He shrugs and gives her a small smile. "I'm used to them, I suppose." Ron opens the door and they all crowd into the warmth of the house. Everyone else’s gathered around the dining table, and they wave at them as they enter. Almost every square inch of the table's area is covered at this point, but dishes are still floating in from the kitchen, directed by Molly's wand. "Take a seat, we're almost beginning. Hope all that flying has worked up an appetite!" A particularly attractive bowl full of mashed potatoes lands on the table in front of Harry.
They stand in the hallway for several, long moments. “I’m sorry. Again.” Malfoy’s brows are furrowed, he’s chewing on his lower lip. With what seems like great effort, he continues, “I shouldn’t have assumed.”
The front door opens and Rose runs into with her broom in hand, closely followed by her exhausted and sweaty-looking parents.
Aurors are a nice concept, but new recruits quickly find that the work is less than desirable. Chasing “bad guys” and enacting justice are certainly part of the job description, but so are long nights away from home, without food, sleep, friends, mounds of paperwork, and not to mention the grueling training that 90% of all trainees fail or drop out of.
It’s long after class has ended, and Harry and Malfoy have been sitting in silence for the past hour, silently grading the homework assignments the students had turned in. Despite the violent storm last night, the day so far has proved to be surprisingly nice - through the window Harry hears the jubilant cheers of students as they romp and play in the snow.
The dream slips away from him as Harry gasps and wipes away a bead of sweat on his brow. When he reaches for the glass of water perched on his nightstand - probably courtesy of Kreacher - the dream is almost completely gone. The only trace remaining is Malfoy’s face at the very end: a little bit greener than usual, eyebrows drawn, and eyes wide.
"I just-I just think it's so funny that, as soon as I start going into work on time, I bust the case wide open. Completely by accident!" He snickers into Draco's shoulder. "What is this, a movie? A book?"
He passes Ron's office and peeks in, but he's not there and his robes aren't slung over the back of his desk chair. He must have left already. Or maybe he really is out doing field work right now. Harry stuffs his hands in his robe pockets, ducks out of the Ministry, and apparates home.
"Harry," Hermione whispers, leaning close to him to that her mouth is close to his ear. "Do you feel it too?"
Muggle London is busier than Harry remembers it. There are more tourists now, and they all move in huge crowds - clustering in front of hotels and restaurants with furry winter coats and cameras in hand. Malfoy leads Harry around them, down streets, and across intersections.
“Good morning Professor!” They intone almost in unison. A few of them also greet Harry, albeit shyly.
He whips his head around but doesn’t see a single head of blonde hair gleaming by the light of the fire. His hand twitches toward his wand, ready to send a Patronus to him, but he catches sight of a group of children a little ways away and immediately runs toward them.
For some reason, Draco's been hesitant to put labels on their relationship all this time, but Harry doesn't mind too much. He's happy with whatever Draco's comfortable with.
“V-very well, then.” Draco steps back and awkwardly leans against a counter. He tears his eyes away from Harry’s back and the muscles there, how they work as he dries and reaches up, into the cabinet.
Once in the castle, Harry and Hagrid split up. Hagrid traverses the castle, visiting the ghosts he stationed around the castle to watch the Christmas decorations (a responsibility he had to take on after some students starting vandalizing the decorations a few years back: charming the mistletoes to follow students around, the wreaths to encircle necks and not come off, etc.)
“Let’s go, then.” Malfoy stands and buttons his coat. Pointing to the uneaten half of Harry’s portion of sandwich, he asks, “Are you going to finish that?”
Draco nods. “Muggles can be quite resourceful. And it happens to be in our favor, as our dragons use it frequently.”
Harry's leg begins to shake violently under the table, and he has to consciously stop himself from rattling his chair and disturbing others. No wonder the field teams look so knackered. After the war, the Auror department has shrunk by quite a lot. There simply wasn't much of a use for them anymore other than the occasional contraband item bust, guard duty for top ranking Ministry officials, and ongoing criminal investigations - that is, until very recently.
Fatigue rolls over him, clouded and heavy. He takes himself to bed, but still is without rest. By the thin light of the moon, escaping its cloud cover, Draco catches the glint of the vial on the bedside table, and its unmoving contents. He touches the mottled flesh of his left forearm, the shape familiar to him even in the dark: here, the eye sockets, here, the figure eight of the snake, and here, its open mouth.
The blonde is gripping his arm like a vice, even though he's (presumably) asleep. Small, quiet snores spill from his open mouth. A small spot of nearly-dried drool rests near his head, on the pillow.
Harry sits back into his chair. “Wow, that’s…” He runs his fingers through his hair. “That’s incredible. Congratulations.”
“The only negligence that happens in the department is because everyone has to deal with you annoying wankers instead of doing their work.” After he finishes that sentence, Robards locks eyes with Harry. “What do
Harry checks a few of the decorations with the more complex spells - silver tinsel twisting in the air like dragons, a Christmas tree on the second floor corridor charmed to bellow out various Celestina Warbeck Christmas hits, and the smattering of mistletoe clippings hanging in doorways that quiver in anticipation when people come close. At one point, Peeves bursts in through the ceiling and promptly crashes into all the tinsel and knots them together. It takes Harry almost an hour to untangle them, even with magic, and once he does, it’s suppertime.
He begins to feel very hot all of a sudden. This is what they get, being so annoying. Harry tries to convince himself that this is actually an advantageous development in his friendships with Ron and Hermione: maybe now they'll finally leave me alone. Maybe this will teach them to mind their own business.
s and the occasional Kreacher, who mostly just tries to rescue and organize the piles of unidentified rotting foods. In between cleaning, Harry stands, half-propped up by the kitchen table, and watches the sun’s decline.
There. They climb a particularly high dune, and once Longbottom reaches the top, he gasps and flings out his arm to hold the rest back. Finnigan gapes and Thomas clutches his husband’s arm, whispering furiously in his ear and pointing. Weasley’s jaw drops. Harry adjusts his glasses and squints.
“Oh my.” Malfoy sits back into his chair, sandwich gone and coffee half-finished. He’s gone a bit green in the face. “I haven’t heard of this.”
Draco’s turns out to be a bunch of cooked mussels. Harry finds himself entranced by the way Draco methodically sucks out the meat from inside the shell, drinks the sauce leftover, and sips on his wine.
“Bloody hell.” Malfoy says as soon as they’re back out in the hallway and the secret corridor has sealed itself once again. He sighs, runs his hand through his hair, once, twice, and straightens up to face Harry. “Right. Now off to the Burrow?”
The third present is from Ron, and it’s a polished wooden box with the words 'Copy Quill' printed in golden letters on the front. Harry lifts the lid and finds a - shocker - quill inside.
This makes Harry laugh, but he quickly sobers up when he realizes what Malfoy’s alluding to. “I know what you’re talking about.”
He sighs and pushes the hair out of his face, giving in immediately because he knows from experience that Harry won’t let up until he does. “Fine.”
It reminds him of the night before, when Harry had walked in on Malfoy playing the piano for Andromeda.
When the laughter dies down, she continues. “And big thanks to my husband, Ron, and my family. You all kept me sane and made me go to bed on time, however against my will.” Ron, Rose, and Hugo are to Harry’s left, and they cheer and laugh at their mention.
Three weeks later, and Draco jerks awake to a pounding at his door. It pauses for a moment, while Draco struggles to gather his wits, then starts up again.
Harry turns to Draco. His face, like all of him, is memory, yes, but also oracle, prophecy, future truth.
"His songs. They must follow his findings in his research. And they must have some kind of magical effect on people."
Harry waves him goodbye, and the door to the cafe closes with a soft tinkle of the bell. The barista catches Harry’s eye and smiles.
Ginny helps Harry up and pats him on the back. "I guess your talent extends to catching Dracos as well as Snitches." Her tone is light and joking, but her hand is slightly trembling. "I'm really sorry I got careless like that."
There's a brief lull in their conversation as everyone watches Draco and the kids interact. Like he's a new toy himself, the children are obsessed with him, asking him to play, to watch, to speak.
"Yes," Molly sets her knitting down, "How long have you two been together, Harry? And why didn't you tell us?" Her brows are drawn, her eyes kind.
Now, all was quiet. The stars above shine their faint lights, and the constellations they build together pulse with life.
“Because I told him I was gay,” Draco answers simply, without much emotion in his voice. “And he wants an heir more than anything.”
Harry still goes to the Burrow for Christmas, and Ginny is still there, but they aren’t an item anymore, let alone parents. With Bill and Fleur still madly in love, Percy and his wife going steady, George and Angelina happily married for almost a decade, Charlie and his boyfriend going strong for longer, and Ginny with a different woman on her arm every year, Harry is the only one to show up alone. And Christmas is just around the corner.
“This is as far as we will go,” Draco says, during a lull in the group’s conversation. “It is as far as we are allowed, by Glyder Fawr and the others.”
Harry opts to stand to the side and wait for the line to die down before approaching. After a few minutes, Draco emerges from backstage and his fans swarm him. This time, however, they don't seem to be asking for autographs.
And the rest of the staff seem to acclimate themselves to him, as well. More than once, Draco has heard laughter and cheery conversation float in from the breakroom - Harry and Prasad bonding over some new Weird Sisters single, Harry and Walker talking Quidditch, Harry and Amira chatting about embroidery.
“Yes. And I’ve learned that healing isn’t always linear. There are ups and downs. And Ron and I want to be there for you in the lulls, but we can’t if you’re never honest ab-”
He starts on his sandwich and Harry follows suit with his half. “Well, I completed my 500 hours of community service, as you know.”
“You should consider it, I think. This is something completely new - I think everyone would be really excited for it. You might even get some funding.”
Andromeda moves first, standing up and walking towards Harry with her hands up as if preparing for an attack. “Harry, let me explain.”
"Hey, when this all blows over, let's have a pity party, alright? 'Mione can't drink but we still can," Ron says, trying to keep his tone light.
He catches a little from sitting in on the meetings - small attacks, kidnappings keep happening in the London area, but there haven't been any fatalities yet, the Aurors have caught some of the group's members, but none of the higher-ranking ones. The Muggle Prime Minister has been warned and Jenny, Ash, and Kingsley are currently formulating a defense plan with them.
“We, the caretakers, do not come here often. Unless for emergencies, it is better to leave this place alone, but it’s still winter, so we may be allowed.”
At the end of the night, Ron ushers a yawning Rose to bed and Hermione sees Harry to the Floo. Before he can escape, she pulls him into a hug. “Tell me if something comes up, okay?”
What seems to be those three people - a woman with her black hair in a short, sleek bob, a bearded man who Harry notices only ever dresses in Muggle formal attire, and another man with long blonde hair tied in a low ponytail and a pair of square glasses sitting low on his face - sit up straight and nod. If Harry recalls correctly, they're the most newbie team in the department. In fact, he's pretty sure he's seen at least one or two of their faces at the Ministry-wide trainee graduation ceremony last Spring.
Harry nods, and presses a kiss to his cheek in affirmation. They sit in companionable silence for several long moments, feeling the sand between their toes and the wind tousling their hair, before Draco speaks again:
Welcome! This fic is completely finished and is comprised of a total of 6 chapters, 16k words. I will be updating Mon/Wed/Fri until the end.
Friday at 7pm can't come fast enough for Harry. If time were crawling along before, it seems to be barely inching its way now. He can't properly focus on his work - not that he really could before, but it's even worse now. Ron doesn't eat lunch with him anymore to distract him. Thursday is unbearable. Friday is almost excruciating.
Though Harry knows that Kreacher must be annoyed, he still complies, obedient as ever. "Will Master be going to work today?" He asks him in his croaky voice.
Harry slowly, carefully, begins to descend with one hand gripping the broom and the other gripping Draco's shirt, trying to keep him on board. Ginny, who had taken a seat down below instead of flying and keeping up with them, finally arrives and holds Draco's legs so their weight isn't causing him to slip off anymore.
Snowdonia is an old place. The dragons it hides are younger, but still unfathomably ancient to mortals - so old they predate most Wizarding lineages. Though some visitors shudder at the thought, it steadies Draco’s hand and quiets his heart. He touches the smooth horn of a young dragon, curled in on itself and snoring, and he touches a creature born before his father was even a thought. He disturbs a stone, and sends it tumbling off into the river below, and he’s moved something that hasn’t in centuries. The continuity is like a balm on his raw heart.
"That's very interesting..." Hermione trails off. "I've made a few connections before, but I never thought to fully explore it."
At the request, Robards snaps out of whatever world of resentment and hatred his brain has run off to and quickly follows Kingsley out into the hall, heading toward the latter's office, Harry assumes. As soon as they leave, the mood of the room relaxes enormously, and the newbies begin chatting amiably as they also pick up and head for the door.
"Obviously," Ron answers for his daughter after scoffing, "they'll have to prove their skill, right?"
He shakes the thoughts way with minor success, mostly because he’s tired and drunk and ready for the peace of sleep. His sheets are warm and smell nice - like lavender. He’s grateful that Kreacher changes them regularly, because Merlin knows what state they would be in if laundry were his responsibility.
Neville brightens up considerably at this and proceeds to fill Harry in. He’s under her tutelage, and will probably be her last apprentice before her retirement. Together, they conduct research on all sorts of under-researched plants and are constantly discovering new magical properties. “And the best part, actually,” Neville explains, eyes shining, “is teaching. I never thought I’d love it so much, but I do.”
As the rest of the department dutifully files out the door, conversation subdued as morale drops a little, Kingsley speaks up. "Harry."
“I’m fine, Pott-sorry-Harry.” He wrenches his arm free from Harry’s grasp and downs his cup before he can react.
“Yeah, thanks,” Harry replies, scratching Cane’s stomach. The dog whines and wriggles on the floor in pure ecstasy - his tail hitting the floor so hard Harry can feel its vibrations through his boots. He’s smaller than Fang was, and even though he’s undoubtedly an adult dog, Hagrid insists that he still has some growing to do.
Once they finish collecting all the books, Malfoy bundles up again and they head out together. “So, what did you think?”
"I see," he murmurs. "And you said that your Ministry supports research into the connection between Muggles and Wizards?"
The girl with her hair in cornrows - Stella - nods. “Okay, you can head that. I’m no good at that without magic anyways. I’ll lead offense.”
"Let's go, then." Draco shifts from holding Harry's hand to linking their arms together. They exit the door as one and Draco turns on his heel and suddenly Harry is whisked away.
That's right, Harry gets presents during Christmas as well. He was so caught up in his hangover and in explaining his situation with Draco to the Weasleys that he'd forgotten.
Looking closely, there are dried tear tracks on Angelica’s face. Her voice is shaky when she speaks. “We’re alright. We all made it out. Listen-” she reaches out and gently grabs the front of his robes, “do you know where Draco is?”
Thankfully, they take pity on him and stop asking questions. “Oh. Okay! I’m Sophia,” the curly-haired girl with a Hufflepuff scarf hanging off her chair says while extending a hand. Harry shakes it hesitantly. “My pronouns are she, her, and hers.”
"Tempus." The spell reads: '9:47am.' Harry sighs and vanishes the note. From afar, Harry can still hear the hurried footsteps of his coworkers in the hall.
As soon as Arthur, Ginny, Luna, and Molly rejoin them, the house lights dim again and cues the crowd into silence. Moments later, Draco walks out again, still in his suit, his hair still wild and covering most of his forehead. The crowd cheers him on, he bows deeply, and picks back up the microphone.
"Good morning my dears," Molly greets them through a yawn as she flops onto her favorite armchair and pulls out some knitting she's working on.
Harry almost snorts, but opts to give a shaky nod, grab the files, and duck out of the room instead. 'Good work.' He could laugh if it weren't so depressing. Harry hasn't done anything useful in this department in years - practically since he first joined. Maybe the most he's ever contributed to the force was the one time someone brought in a broken Muggle coffee machine and he fixed it for them.
Soon, there's a whole crowd of people - which is basically what the entire immediate Weasley family boils down to - gathered in their garden. It's dark out by now, but with a combination of enchanted Christmas lanterns floating here and there and nearly every wandowner's Lumos, visibility levels are actually pretty good.
Night falls away and the sun comes up for breath once more, but Draco barely notices its pink light.
With his other hand, Harry slowly touches the scarred, twisted flesh of Draco’s left forearm. A reminder - for both of them.
But before Harry can speak a single word, a robed old man stands up from his bench at the front and intones, “5 years in Azkaban followed by 500 hours of community service. No chance of parole,” and suddenly the muscular men on either side of Malfoy who bear a striking resemblance to Crabbe and Goyle grab both of his arms and start dragging him out of the room.
Now, when Draco speaks, the men turn their faces and crowd close, like cubs to their mother's warmth. Thomas shows an interest in history. Finnigan asks often about the particulars of dragon caretaking. Longbottom, naturally, is fascinated by the plants native to Snowdonia that, according to the legends, mark the footsteps of the most ancient dragons. Weasley wonders about the possibility of reviving the cross-species friendship, and of wizardkind taking flight once more. But when he turns to remark on that one time in Gringotts with his best friend, the conversation dies.
“Yes, even then.” Draco closes his eyes, and feels the breeze as it picks up. “I don’t want to be trapped, never changing.”
Hagrid settles back into his reclining chair with Cane gnawing at an alarmingly large bone at his feet. The fire crackles loudly, sounding like an invitation to Harry.
Harry breathes out slowly and looks to the sky. The stars have come out. “It must be nice in the summer.”
Harry and Malfoy take the hint and make to leave. When Harry looks back at the last moment, Snape has returned to his frame, and both he and Dumbledore are watching on as they leave - and not unkindly.
He regards the group of men before him, the people he grew up with, the people who despised him for half a decade. He watches them smile at him and he speaks with them easily. And all the while, memories of their hatred, of
As promised, it comes sharp and insistent precisely at 7pm. "Coming," he half-groans, half-shouts at the door. Usually Kreacher is the one to greet guests for Harry, but he's not here tonight for some reason.
Friday. 7pm. Harry doesn't know where exactly it will be held but he has a good enough guess. He doesn't even know exactly what is happening at that time and place but he knows that Draco is going to be there and that's enough to convince him.
He turns to the pair of students working beside him and asks, “Could I just watch you two for a bit?”
Though his behavior catches Harry off guard, he takes the slice anyways and murmurs his thanks before taking a bite. He’s right. It
Ginny, Harry, and Luna greet them all back similarly half-heartedly while the children scream and run around their arms waving and their hands gripping their new toys. Lucy's wearing her new sweater - which is, as she hoped, green with a red L emblazoned on the front - and she comes over and assumes her regular position in Harry's lap with her head resting on his shoulder.
The tallest one, maybe a girl of about seventeen refocuses the attention on Malfoy, “How’d your performance go?”
Months ago, Draco would have heard only pity in his voice. But he knows, now, that Harry has always been sincere, and it was Draco who was afraid to listen too deeply.
"It seems that fate always gives you the most pivotal role. Even when you've done nothing to deserve it."
Early summer, and Draco is sitting inside, out of the afternoon sun. He organizes their files and records behind the receptionist desk, and inwardly scowls at the haphazard sorting system that is no doubt Prasad’s doing. From his right, down the hall, he hears movement in Amira’s office - likely trying to get the onboarding material in order.
Harry watches as some eyebrows climb higher and higher and some jaws drop lower and lower. Since he went through the same shock only a week or so before, Harry understands what they must be thinking now. The Malfoy name has been tied up in money, connections, and inherited power for so long that the assumption is often that the individual members aren't really that talented, or even worthy of any of those things. And to be fair, there's a definite argument to be made there about how no one family, not even the most gifted or talented, deserve the sheer amount of power and privilege that the Malfoys had possessed before the war, but what Harry's rapidly learning is that Draco has the true talent to rebuild his family name from scratch. Harry can almost see some of the last dregs of resentment towards Draco melt away from the faces of the Weasleys. The Malfoy family as a concept will never garner full forgiveness - the past there is too painful for that to ever happen - but Draco Malfoy as an individual is proving himself to be different from his family. Harry feels an odd sense of pride, though he had nothing to do with any of it.
"Merlin, are we really doing this?" Harry’s pulse jumps at the thought of competing just like old times.
"Excellent. And you?" Belle turns her attention onto Harry, her dark eyes glittering much like Ava's had been.
“Of course. Of course I will. Whatever you want,” Harry says, and Draco knows he means every single word.
Harry blushes, feeling a bit awkward now with the attention focused on him. Not everyone in the room is paying attention to their conversation, so it's really just the attention of Draco and Hermione, but the two are a formidable combo to face. "Er, I asked around? I knew I wanted something music-related, so I just went to every shop and asked. The storekeep at Ursa's hadn't been able to sell that for months, so she was pretty relieved when I came in."
The question seems to trouble her a little; her smile turns a little painful, and she shuffles from foot to foot as she polishes some dirty glasses. "Well...I like to think so, but truth be told I think it's one-sided. The man rarely even agrees to stick around for a drink after closing time. Belle and I - I think we've tried our best."
Harry settles on the couch; the blankets are warm and the pillow is soft and when he closes his eyes, he’s completely enveloped in Malfoy’s scent.
They end up in Malfoy’s mini-apartment on one of the vacant floors of the Astronomy Tower, and Harry tries not to think about the symbolism of the location.
Draco laughs a little at that. He looks so pretty, holding the bouquet up against his green suit. "Thank you. Thank you all for coming. Sincerely."
Now that her job of preventing Harry from making grievous fashion choices is done, Ginny walks over and joins Luna on the window seat. She gives her a quick peck, leans her head on her shoulder, and asks, "What are you looking at, love?"
It was at that point that Malfoy began to research more deeply into the two topics - all in his free time, of course - which eventually led him to Muggle topics like physics. More specifically, the physics of sound.
"Tempus." The time floats in the air in front of the two for a little bit before they pass it while walking and it disappears behind them. "Not late - yet."
Chuckling, Harry obliges. When they reach their wizard chess set up on the sitting room table, Harry is met with an extraordinary pouty-looking Draco Malfoy. “Ha-a-rry~” He whines, laying his head down on the table. Harry looks at the board.
Harry doesn't say anything. He doesn't think he can say anything. The last time he and Draco were on a broom together, he almost died too. The memory of Harry, Draco, the Room of Requirement, and Fiendfyre is an all-too familiar visitor to Harry's dreams. It's one of the worst, which is saying something.
“I’m…” Harry entertains the idea of lying, but he figures he’s in too much shit as is. “...here to help Hagrid around the castle.”
"Yes," Draco smirks at Harry, and it looks so normal that his heart calms down and skips a beat at the same time. "We were rivals."
"...Thank you. I will let you both know when that is." Draco's face is smooth, clear, his eyes hooded and his lips drawn in a straight line.
And it feels different too. Some pieces leave Harry feeling warm, some give him shivers. When Harry glances at the others seated at his table - Ginny, Luna, Molly, Arthur, Hermione, Ron - they all have the same, surprised but pleased expression.
At that moment, Ginny walks into the living room still in her pajamas. Luna follows closely behind and stops to admire the Christmas tree and its decorations.
“I don’t need it. I’m getting better, Hermione, I already told you. Christmas went fine, didn’t it?”
They stay like that for several long moments, holding each other close while Draco shudders and tries to regain control of his breathing. Their embrace is pleasant - perfectly warm for the wintery conditions outside. Harry is surprised it isn’t currently snowing.
Gordon and the extremely freckled boy named Robin nod and resume discussing something quietly among themselves - fort-building tactics, Harry assumes.
"There!" Arthur half-shouts in triumph, staring around at his family defiantly. "Draco agrees! Jazz is a fantastic invention. And I honestly think the Wizarding community could benefit greatly from its healing power."
“You can come, if you want. To the wedding.” For the first time all night, Harry sounds unsure. He looks away.
When the men stumble out of their cottages the next morning, bleary eyed and hands up to shield from the rising light, Draco is already packed and scanning the horizon. A V of geese slash through the low-lying clouds, and the sun has begun to lift the dewdrops to its embrace.
If what Ava said about Draco’s behavior working at the club is true, then Harry doesn’t blame either hers or Belle’s curiosity. Draco has always been mysterious in his motives and thoughts, and he still is, but Harry thinks that he’s slowly coming to understand him.
“You didn’t understand anything did you.” Malfoy says it more like a statement than a question. He can’t hide his smug grin.
“It used to bother me a lot, but now I’m okay with it. I didn’t see it at the time, but Dumbledore was right. I could’ve still turned away from the prophecy, if I wanted to, but I didn’t. And that was my choice.” Harry takes a deep breath. “There’s one thing, though, that still bothers me.”
And sorry for the late update! I’m currently in an area with extremely spotty wifi so it took me a long while to get this up.
Hermione and Ron collectively let out a breath of relief. “We just found out this week,” Ron explains. “You’re the first person we’ve told.”
Slowly, Longbottom approaches, takes the board, and begins writing and signing, talking through the logistics with Prasad, who hasn’t faltered for a single moment.
Lucas grins at her, but doesn’t try to defend himself. Harry gingerly takes his still-outstretched hand and shakes it.
"Merry Christmas!" Roxanne, Angelina and George's youngest daughter, beams up at him, her curly hair dashed this way and that across her forehead. "Did you get me something this year?"
When Draco finishes it and the concert at large, the crowd doesn't hesitate to collectively shoot to its feet, the hands of every shape, size, and color creating a wave of sound, of clapping, to meet Draco as he stands and bows. There's a big smile on his face and Harry catches a little sparkle falling from his hair. For a moment, he wonders how a sequin got in his hair, but then Harry realizes it was a bead of sweat. Several beads, in fact. But Draco's still smiling, still laughing, still graciously accepting the enormous bouquet of flowers that Belle presents him. Harry suddenly feels self-conscious that he didn't think to bring anything too.
And all of this is not to mention the nature of the department. Police are police, no matter if they’re wielding a wand or a baton or a gun. The Auror department’s job is to protect the rich, ruling wizards and witches more than it is to actually serve the marginalized, and no amount of “fun” community initiatives or open office parties will change that.
“By the way, professor,” Lucas ventures, “would you ever be willing to play for us sometime? As a class?”
Rolling his eyes, Lucas rolls up the sleeves of his robe and opens the hefty physics textbook. “This is what you get for not doing the reading, Sophia.”
“Not everyone can have blonde hair,” Harry grumbles while self-consciously running his hand through his hair in an effort to rid himself of the snowflakes he’s sure have congregated there.
Draco waits from Harry to catch himself and step back, but he doesn’t. Their heads are so close that their breaths seem to mingle in the air.
sorry. How rude of me for not introducing myself.” She sticks out a hand. “I’m Patricia, but you can just call me Pat. I’m the caretaker.”
He goes up, orders a coffee, and settles in for a while, sipping his drink and watching the clouds go by.
And they’re off. First stop is Malfoy’s living quarters, where Harry and Malfoy pick up a trunk each.
"Good morning ever-" But before he can finish, the children flock to him en masse, clamoring for his attention.
"I know. Hopefully it's not as bad as we think, but..." Ron trails off and doesn't finish his sentence. He doesn't have to; Harry shares the same sentiment.
Luna, who Harry only just noticed has been sitting on the floor, leaning up against Ginny, muses. "They're a beautiful couple."
He shivers as the wind blows over them - the warming charms are wearing off, and the night is settling in. Spring, he had named the teasing warmth, but he was foolish and too optimistic: winter hasn’t released its grip upon the world quite yet.
His face now especially red in the light of the fire, he tugs at his beard and mutters, “She’s alrigh’.”
Something snaps in him; Malfoy comes to a dead stop and begins some sort of rant with: “Potter-!” but before another word can leave his mouth, the books that had been slowly slipping out of his grasp tumble painfully onto both his and Harry’s feet.
Malfoy. And, like Andromeda said, it wasn’t that big of a deal. It’s normal for family to stick together, especially after the War. Harry, of all people, can understand that.
But Harry quickly finds that others had the same idea. A group of ten students pass Harry and swarm Malfoy.
Malfoy sits on the bench, back straight and stock still, staring straight ahead at nothing. His hair is matted with sweat but he’s shivering slightly - the only signs that Malfoy is nervous at all. Harry wants him to relax, to just incline his head just a little bit so Harry can properly catch his eye. If he does, Harry will point to the pile of papers sitting in front of him - his testimony that he and Hermione had spent many long nights writing - so Malfoy can see that Harry’s got his back.
There is no response, only the slight shaking of Draco’s head, as if he didn’t hear anything, as if he wouldn’t be able to hear anything ever again.
Third stop is right outside Hogwart’s grounds, where Harry and Malfoy link arms, take one last look at the castle, and apparate.
The password is "Tinsel" and as soon as Malfoy's said it, the gargoyle reveals the secret passage and the two men follow it to the office.
He doesn't do any work for the rest of the day -  too busy drumming his fingers on his desk, biting his lip, and glancing periodically at his door, convinced that someone was going to bust in at any second.
As Harry nears his office, he notices the door is ajar. Strange, he thinks to himself. Although he didn't care much in the past, lately he's been trying to at least shut the door when he leaves, just so no one can see inside at how messy his desk is.
Hagrid’s hut has remained mostly unchanged, but next to it now stands a larger hut: Gawp’s place. Gawp comes and goes, never really able to decide between the Forest and the hut, but he always retreats into the Forest in the winter -
“It’s us now,” Hermione whispers, interrupting the group’s current conversation about their limited knowledge of music.
"Excellent," the blonde's response comes without any hesitation or pause as he winds his scarf around his pale neck. "I will see you all there tonight at seven." He reaches into his breast pocket, pulls out a neatly folded square of paper, and presses it into Harry's hand. "That's the address. And Merry Christmas."
“Oh. Why didn’t anyone tell me? Hermione?” When Harry turns to look at her, she’s avoiding his eyes.
No cheers. The audience is eating up his dramatic pause, waiting for him to open his mouth again and continue.
Hermione, who is seated on the bed a little ways off, laughs and shakes her head. "I have to agree with Ginny on this one."
"I'm guessing this is about Hermione." Harry feigns ignorance, but Ron knows him better than that. He doesn't respond, just stares at him with an eyebrow raised.
For once, Harry's isn't the last one to make it to the meeting. One by one, the teams either trek in, faces grim and feet dragging slush all over the floor, or skid in, out of breath and robes haphazardly thrown over their clothes. In comparison, Harry seems completely put together. The only people missing when the meeting begins are Jenny and Ash, but Harry assumes that they're currently working hard trying to negotiate with the Muggles.
Draco considers this. “Yes, it is. But all dragons are deeply invested in their families, and in the continuation of their lineage. They likely consider the sacrifice a worthy one.”
“Oh!” Harry grimaces. “Sorry, should have clarified. They got married last fall, remem-” He stops himself, and the rest of his sentence swings free.
Nearly thirty minutes and a second coffee pass before Harry spots Malfoy walking down the street in a long, dark blue coat and complementary gray scarf. Harry waves at him through the glass but Malfoy doesn’t seem to see him.
He’s only gotten through three of the readings when a shadow suddenly falls across the page. He looks up and is face-to-face with an upside down Draco Malfoy, his blonde hair falling around his face and his sharp eyes looking into Harry’s. “Is that the one I wrote? I put it in there because I thought we’d get to it, but...” He climbs over the back of the couch, sits right next to Harry, and takes the scroll of parchment out of his hands before he can protest.
Ginny runs up to Rose and scoops her up in her arms, sending the child into a fit of giggles. "Rosie, I think that's a great idea. You're so smart!"
For one brief moment, Harry even entertains the idea of going to see him at the jazz club tonight, but quickly trashes it when he reassesses his mental and physical capabilities at the moment and finds that he will most likely not even have the will to leave the bed today, let alone get dressed fancy again and going to a Muggle jazz club in the middle of London. Harry feels bad for one moment before it passes just as quickly as it came.
Draco Malfoy’s eyes widen almost comically before he quickly regains his composure. They nod civilly in a silent agreement:
If they have questions, the group of men don’t vocalize them. Over the last week, they have grown accustomed to Draco’s purposeful vagueness, the way he sets up for a particular reveal. If Draco were an optimistic person, he could let himself imagine that they trust him, trust that the punchline will always be fulfilling. But he is not, and he has long learned that fantasies are just that. So he keeps moving.
"It's...hard to live as we are. After the War and everything awful that's happened. For a long time, I thought I could never see anyone again because I thought...I would be a burden. Or they wouldn't understand."
“Happy birthday, Draco,” Amira says warmly, rolling over to rest a hand on his arm. “Come, we made you something.”
The stairs are the hardest part; all along the way, the blonde alternates between periods of trying to squirm out of Harry’s grasp and becoming a dead weight by relaxing and not moving at all. Somehow, they get into the room and Harry wrestles Draco onto the bed.
Mal-Draco steps forward and bows, startling Harry. For a moment, he had completely forgotten that he had come here with him - the blonde was so quiet.
Harry pries his eyes open again. By the soft glow of the lamp, he can pick out the gray hairs that have cropped up on Draco’s head recently. He feels his body, which is softer now - less angular. He sees the wrinkles on Draco’s neck.
Harry doesn't remember the last time he was so captivated by music. Or by anything, for that matter. It seems that every time Draco's fingers touch the keys, more than just music springs out: joy, light, warmth. These abstract feelings engulf Harry in waves but he finds that he already knows how to swim, how to breathe easy in them.
As he sets aside his other gifts, Harry suddenly remembers that he both forgot to open Hagrid's present and to give Draco his. He takes his wand out and summons both, and the two packages come zooming obediently down the stairs and around the corner. They must have somehow made their way to the bedroom without Harry noticing. Or maybe he carried them up there without remembering.
He continues: “That night, on the Tower, when you were going to kill Dumbledore. I was there. What you did-what you didn’t do. That was also a choice.”
It happens on a Thursday night while they’re clearing the table after a particularly tasty stir-fry dinner.
He shoots Harry a pointed look and turns up his nose a little bit. “You always had a choice, and you chose to bother me.”
The door closes behind her, and it's just Harry, Ginny, and Luna in the bedroom now. It's past six now, and the sun has long set, but Luna is still looking out the window, into the darkness.
“What are my duties,” Harry manages to get out through tightly gritted teeth. “You forgot to mention them during the meeting.” Behind him, Harry feels and hears every stroke of every letter of every word of every sentence that the reporters are scribbling down in their notepads.
Draco steps out into the gray morning. The rain is not as heavy anymore, more aluminum than lead. At the flooded fire pit, the men are already strapped up, Impervious’d, and waving to Draco.
He's digging through his pantry for an empty jar at least when he hears Draco say from the foyer. "It's just how I remember it."
“Let us go.” A click and a flash go off behind Narcissa. In the darkening air, the sudden light sends shadows sprawling up her face.
His face is splashed on at least two thirds of all their issues with accompanying headlines that range anywhere from 'Harry Potter, Savior Thrice-fold?' to 'Harry Potter's secret relation to neo-Death Eater Jack Willows!'
They go back to discussing strategy in hushed whispers and Harry takes the opportunity to glance over at the other team - and most importantly, Malfoy.
The first gift he opens is from Molly, and it's one of her traditional sweaters. He must have about a dozen of them by now, all with different designs. This one is navy blue with a white letter 'H' on the front and a white silhouette of a stag on the back. "Thank you, Molly. This is amazing."
Looking at Lucas, a young, black, talented kid, Harry feels a tightness in his chest. If he becomes an Auror - which is already assuming he’ll be able to brave the training and initiation process - he’ll no doubt wither away like Harry has. The one difference would be that Harry is privileged enough to, even after all his failures and mental breakdowns on the clock, still be offered a cushy Auror-in-name-only job. Hell, Harry could survive for the rest of his life just by living on his parents’ money and the free shit offered to him in exchange for endorsements and public appearances. Harry hazards a guess that Lucas doesn’t have the same opportunities.
The two hold a heated gaze for a moment. “Fine,” Harry breaks it and picks up a book, a smile tugging at his lips, “you have a point.”
"It is." Draco's voice has suddenly taken on a dreamy quality to it. "I joked to her once that I might consider building an identical cottage right beside hers and live there for the rest of my days. To my horror, she was not immediately opposed." Harry chuckles at that, consciously aware of how Draco's fond smile has settled on him, warming him from the tips of his toes to the ends of his hair.
The first thing he does is crush all of them into a group hug. The children huddle with him, some breaking out into tears. The baby is awake now, and wails in Angelica’s arms.
They don’t speak much, which, to Draco, is even stranger than his new, domestic reality with Harry Potter. Since the conversation they had in the cabin, when Harry first arrived at work, they haven’t conversed about anything more personal than the warming weather, work, or food. Anytime they’re alone together, Draco keeps bracing himself for the inevitable, intrusive question, but it never comes.
Often, Harry doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry after binge reading those articles. Laugh at the absurdity of it all? At the foolish way the media is running itself to the ground with its overactive imagination? Or cry because of how far they are from the truth, and how close they are to Harry’s fantasies?
Malfoy doesn’t respond, just continues to sit on the couch, still completely naked. Harry throws the clothes back to him. “Put those on.”
Malfoy fiddles with his scarf and mumbles. “There wasn’t a piano, obviously. And I was a bit busy around that time, if you’ll recall.”
Robards kicks Edwards a little in the side, eliciting a whimper out of him, and spits, "Bloody traitor."
“Glyder Fawr. The fifth highest mountain peak in Wales - to Muggles, at least. You will see when we arrive, it will be worth the effort.”
Harry's reply leaves his desk in record time. When he's done, he cradles his wrist a little bit - it's cramped from writing so fast.
Most of his coworkers have already arrived. Some are securing the area by spelling the Muggle police and firefighters away. Others are sending arcs of water toward the building from their wands. Others are deep in conversation with the bystanders - the witnesses - to the crime. Ron is nowhere to be found.
Harry knows that he’s never really been good at the investigative side of Auror work - he almost failed his practical during his time in the Academy - but he can’t help feeling antsy knowing the department is struggling. Knowing that nonwhite Muggle and Muggleborn lives are at stake.
She doesn’t get angry, just sits onto the couch beside him and lays a gentle, warm hand on his shoulder. “Are you okay?”
“It was a hobby of mine, when I was a child. My father thought it would instill culture in me,” He chuckles and traces the rim of his coffee cup.
He’s sitting in a cushy armchair in front of the fire with a spotted cat on his lap. The clock on the mantle ticks away the seconds and the flames crackle and snap. Distantly, Harry hears the rumble of thunder, but no rain.
As they step off, Ron waves to the man he's been chatting with in the lift, "Bye, tell Henry I said Merry Christmas!"
“It’s true, I was young, and influenced by my parents and our society. But that’s no excuse, and I don’t want it to be one for me.” Draco’s gaze is unwavering. “I still had a choice, even if I didn’t think so at the time. I never want the consequences of that choice to be taken from me.”
neo-Death Eaters has been an excruciatingly slow process - and once in holding, suspects, especially non-white ones, face outright torture like Unforgivables - all of which is hidden from the top brass, of course.
Suddenly, her attention snaps back to Harry. “Uncle Harry! Can we go flying now?” Without even waiting for an answer, she screws up her face and begins begging: “Pleasepleasepleasepleaseplease-”
Their conversation lulls and Harry’s mind races, desperate to keep it flowing. Flakes of snow are still raining down outside, and streams of people tightly bundled in their winter coats flow down the sidewalk, right in front of the window Harry and Malfoy are sitting at. The barista is wiping down the counter while humming a little tune to herself.
“I will Rose, I promise, but not today.” Her whole body seems to deflate that at. “It’s too dark outside right now.”
Once again, she garners a standing ovation. Ron takes Harry’s hand and squeezes. Harry looks over, and sees his best friend is crying. He squeezes back.
Harry takes the hint and complies. "Uh. Yeah. I think you're right. We should. 'Night Draco, get back safely." And with that, the pair turn to leave. Harry spots the rest of their group plus Belle and Ava standing and chatting at the door, but most of them - namely Hermione and Ginny - keep glancing over at them with expressions a mixture of amusement and slight horror. Harry thinks his face must look the same.
Harry’s stomach ties itself into knots at the thought of all his plans coming to fruition, and it’s not just because of the stress of planning a party involving both Muggles and Wizards. He’s got something special planned, and he hasn’t told anyone quite yet - not even Ron or Hermione.
To Harry's surprise, Draco reaches him in one stride of his long legs and takes Harry's hand, sending tingles up and down his spine. "I think I can bear it for one night. Next time, I'll choose your outfit, if you let me."
Harry gives her the list of drink requests from the group, and she wastes no time in making them. As she does so, Harry doesn't try to strike up a conversation. He's too nervous - opting instead to rubbing his hands and staring at the stage, which is completely empty.
“I-I need you to take a letter.” But such a letter doesn’t exist yet, and they both know that. She coos short and low as if to encourage him.
"Harry," its voice is deep and smooth - Kingsley's - "Emergency meeting, now." The Patronus dissipates. The Muggles around them are rendered wide-eyed and speechless. Without any warning, Draco quickly and efficiently sends
It feels so surreal to be posting the final chapter of this series. It's like the past two years of my life have resolved with a click of a button!
"So tonight I'm going to play several of my own compositions - all of which exist thanks to the upright piano that burned down with the orphanage. I hope you enjoy them, and I hope you consider donating. Thank you." He gives a slight bow amid deafening applause and takes a seat at the piano. After a moment, he flexes his wrists and begins to play.
Draco remembers. He cannot forget. His bated breath, all of Sixth Year, anticipating, dreading the sign to proceed. Watching his childhood home become a slaughterhouse, a torture chamber with too many rooms to hide in and not enough doors from which to escape - clinging onto whatever scraps of hope he could find that someday, one way or another, it will all be over.
“Little Palace, Viet-Naan - a wonderful fusion place - and Verde, among others. They’re are the ones I visit most often. I’ve even treated my mother at a few of them before, when she visits.”
They’re swerving into potentially dangerous territory now. Harry tries his best to steer them back onto the right track. “You said you perform regularly now, right? At the jazz club?”
The End! Thank you so much for reading, it really means a lot. I hope you've enjoyed the story and the characters as much as I have writing them!
The git smirks at Harry again and stretches luxuriously before getting out of his seat and sauntering over.
“It’s starting. Prasad and Amira are already there, and Dr. Khanyile is on her way. We should hurry.”
Harry muses. He’s only been there once or twice in all the years he’s lived in the neighborhood. Harry makes a mental note to visit sometime.
Malfoy drags the bench out from underneath and sits though it groans in protest underneath him. The kids gather around, opting to sit on the floor rather than the kitchen chairs. Harry plops down on one of them and the woman from before rejoins them, taking a seat in a chair beside him with the baby quiet and still in her arms. She has two other children in tow - one a toddler and one who seems about the same age as the older girl who received the notes.
"Wow." She takes a deep breath and then sticks her hand out. "Ava, sorry I forgot to introduce myself earlier. I'm his coworker here."
Footsteps. The distinct sound of dress shoes on a hollow wooden platform is all the audience needs to being clapping - and cheering! Draco hasn't played a single note yet, hasn't even appeared on the stage, and the audience is already practically on the verge of a standing ovation.
"Time's up!" Stella calls to the other team. Malfoy signals for his team members to stop talking and walks over.
From the water, a shriek rings out. “Fuck, it’s cold!” Finnigan exclaims. Weasley splashes him, and the two begin chasing each other, fighting and getting wet.
“A week. Though at this rate, they may as well change that at a moment’s notice, too.” The bitterness hangs from her words. Rare, for her to be so frustrated.
12 Grimmauld Place is quiet and empty when Harry gets in. As usual. He flops on his couch, not bothering to shrug off his robes or changing for his date, and dozes as he waits for a knock at his door.
Hope you enjoyed this chapter! And remember to sleep and eat properly even (especially) when you're stressed!
“Oh Harry, you’re here!” Hermione walks out from the kitchen and scoops Rose up. “Sorry about that. Rose, be nice.”
Walker nods, then takes her hands off. “Allow yourself this.” She turns to the door. “And have a happy birthday.”
After a long moment, Harry stands and makes for the door. As he turns the knob, he pauses, but only for a second. The door clicks shut, and Draco is alone.
They disentangle their bodies and manage to stand up - neither having sustained any serious injuries.
After exchanging farewells, Draco waves his friends off, and closes the door. He hesitates a moment, then joins Harry in the kitchen, where the latter is putting the last of the dishes away.
"Is it your first time here?" She asks conversationally while punching his information into the computer.
“Good question,” Draco replies, “It very basically means their bloodlines diverged from mainland dragons thousands of years ago, and now they are unique, existing nowhere else in the world.”
But before Harry has any chance to defend himself, someone taps him on the shoulder. When he turns around, before him stands Neville Longbottom.
"So, Potter. What do you think? Have I converted you?" His gaze is so earnest, so open. It throws Harry off a little bit; it's a look that he never felt comfortable sharing with Harry during Hogwarts, after all.
They walk in tenuous silence, and it’s a long walk too. It seems, for whatever reason, Malfoy’s destination happens to be on the exact opposite side of the castle - or maybe he’s just fucking with Harry. Both are very distinct possibilities.
The latter adds on that while carving himself some of the ham. "I think I’ve heard the name around the office once or twice."
“I’m glad you agree.” He hesitates before continuing. “And I apologize for being so short with you. I was a little...stressed and shouldn’t have taken it out on you.”
At times, they skate in silence, each lost in their own thoughts or admiring the view. Other times, they chat animatedly, leaning into each other and smiling like old friends. Like the War never happened. Like Malfoy and Harry actually became friends after meeting at Madame Malkin’s for the first time all those years ago.
They’ve moved in together, effectively, over the past few weeks. It all started when Harry was too tired and lazy to go back to Grimmauld Place after a late night at Draco’s place, and everything changed organically from there. They don’t really talk about it. Harry finds that they don’t really need to - sometimes he swears Draco is using
Maybe it's the alcohol. Or maybe Harry's just a crazy bastard. But he opens his mouth again and says, "You know, I could say the same for you."
Draco Malfoy pops into existence in the middle of all the hubbub, startling everyone. Most of the Aurors don’t know how to react other than stare as Draco spots the kids and immediately rushes over. Harry follows close behind.
“Ah, I see. Well as for the rest of them,” he points to each person as he says their name, “this is Ginerva Weasley, Luna Lovegood, and Ron Weasley.”
"He's teaching a special course right now. Just for the holidays. Musical Theory, or sommat like that."
Harry tries not to stare too hard at his Adam’s apple as he swallows. “And from then on, like I mentioned before, I’ve been in and out of all kinds of jobs. I’m currently playing regularly for a Muggle jazz club.” Malfoy says the last sentence casually, as if it were completely
Ginny holds up a black tie - possibly the one remaining one of his that isn't horribly wrinkled from being tossed lazily onto the ground after the Ministry events Hermione and Ron still force him to attend.
“It is wonderful to be able to meet all of you - and it’s the first time here for all of you, correct?”
“For class today, I want you all to pair up: physics textbooks with the urtexts, and as a team research one of the many links between music and magic that you read about in preparation for this class. Chord progressions - both Western and Eastern - Majors, and Minors - all and more are available as options to look into. Feel free to consult any arithmancy notes you may possess. See me if you have questions. I am happy to help.” With that, Malfoy takes a seat at his desk and pulls out some parchment.
