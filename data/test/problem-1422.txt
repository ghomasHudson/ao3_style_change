"Harry Potter, rooting for green," Malfoy laughs, throaty and strange in a way that takes Harry out of the moment for a few seconds. "Who would have guessed?"
"Why the 25th anniversary?" Draco asks, before he can stop himself. "I don't recall hearing about your miraculous resurfacing for the 20th."
"—But he was there at the hospital. So were you, for Hugo's birth," Ron adds, his face suddenly solemn. "Because you two were dating by then."
He stops by the door in the corner that leads to the Misuse of Muggle Artefacts office. It's a baffling setup, he thinks; did Weasley Sr. really have to walk the length of the Auror offices each morning to get to his own desk in a much tinier room, back when Draco was a child?
fills Draco's entire body, a painful adrenaline that makes his face feel tight and hot. Potter's green eyes, so like the heavy silk of the robe Draco's designed for him, are piercing him like heavy spears, driving into Draco with all of their history. All the pain they've inflicted upon each other—all the pain Draco has inflicted upon him. Harry. Draco knows it's not equal.
"Did you understand the differences?" Lothair asked, his hands now empty of the axes he'd wielded only moments before. "Between myself and Ilaria."
"Of course, I would never leave the Realm unprotected," Harry responded, nodding his head in acknowledgement to Kolvar. "Two of the High Lords will remain in the Realm."
Harry frowned. He had no idea how to even begin something like that and, if he was honest, all he could imagine was Hogwarts crashing down around them if he tried. "I'm new to this whole Elf magic thing, remember?" he commented, dryly. "I don't think restructuring Hogwarts is within my abilities."
Shooting a look across the room to Ron, the redhead shrugged and mouthed the word "sorry." Not that Harry believed for a second that he actually was. The git.
The use of his name had brought Harry's eyes back to the blond and any doubts Draco had had about his identify went out the window. The dark glare on Harry's face combined with the now flashing green eyes was a familiar expression. This
"So explain it," Draco countered, his tone clearly indicated that he thought he shouldn't have had to say it.
He wasn't sure why, but Draco was positive there was a smirk resting on the corner of Potter's lips that the blond had never seen there before. His eyes locked on it, narrowing further when Potter's dueling partner tensed, a clearly visible flush stealing over her pale cheeks. The red of her flush could have just as easily symbolized the rush of angry heat that stabbed through Draco as it had her own embarrassment. He didn't know who this woman was, but it was quite clear that she was connected to Potter in one form or another.
"You still have a long way to go when it comes to your swordsmanship, but there's no point in having you learn with a sword that you won't be using," she explained, following a path through the manor that she had clearly walked a thousand times before. After a moment, he realized that they weren't heading to the training grounds and he swordsmith that worked with the royal guard. Seeing the question in his gaze, Ilaria snorted. "If you want a real sword, you go to the master."
A strangled moan of pain was what alerted Lucius and the others to the new development. Lucius had not continued his line of torture and, therefore, could not claim to be responsible. Backing away slightly, the older Malfoy watched, as the air seemed to shimmer strangely around his son before Draco's entire body disappeared before his eyes, taking with it the manacles that had confined him and a portion of the dungeon wall where they had been securely connected.
"Every individual, whether they are Wizard or Elf, hold a deep connection with their ancestral home. In the Wizarding world the Potter line has another ancestral home, but it is merely for those who are not privileged enough to experience the full strength of their heritage. Only a select few, yourself included, have felt the connection with Jade Manor and, because of this connection, she is welcoming you home. It has been many years since she has felt the presence of one of her own."
At the insistence in Harry's voice, Soren's attention finally returned to him. "I apologize, my Lord, but I'm afraid the tour will have to be put on hold for the moment. This is your home so you are free to go where you will. One of us will locate you once the meeting has adjourned."
Once the fabric had been secured, Soren moved back to hold his earlier position. No longer sharing the space, Rosalind's words gained momentum and there was a flash of warmth at his wrist. He made to look, but with the warmth came a strong lethargic feeling. It didn't matter what was happening in the room, Harry relaxed back into the pillow, his entire body feeling much heavier than it had a moment before. His eyes were focused on the ceiling, but he did not see it. Glazed over, he relaxed back into the content feeling that was slowly spreading through him. How long he stayed like that, he couldn't say.
"What the hell is going on?" Harry demanded, clutching Draco to him protectively as he moved forward. "Why is that
Harry chuckled. She wasn't entirely wrong, but he was pretty sure it was only because he usually braided his own hair and he certainly didn't have the skill for it that Rosalind had or even Gwynn had. Hers never slipped from from its hold. Short of asking one of them to do it for him every day, there wasn't much else to do but hope he'd some day get better at it. By the look on Gwynn's face, however, he figured that day was far in the future.
He was tempted to just keep walking. He didn't know whether or not he had the energy or even the desire to deal with Potter just then. He had a lot on his mind and, given his most recent experiences, Potter was more likely to increase the problem rather than decrease it. His hand settled on the door knob, but instead of going through as he had intended, he stilled. Perhaps he was curious? Perhaps he was a sucker for punishment? Whatever it was, Draco waited.
"You're needed here," Harry continued, softening the blow. "Strategically, you're the only one I can leave at the Manor. Ilaria leads the army. Her presence is more useful in the realm than it will be in the Wizarding World. Lothair can maintain our physical training regiments and any security measure we'll need." There were other reasons he wanted Lothair to go, but he had no intention of voicing those thoughts with anyone other than the Elf in Question.
"What the hell are we supposed to do now?" Lothair asked, coming up to stand beside Soren, arms crossed over his chest. "We're not to meddle in Wizarding affairs."
"They can't get through the wards," Draco commented, offering the older elf a shrug. "What's the problem if they know."
"I seriously hope you know what you're doing," Snape muttered only when they were out of Dumbledore's earshot. He didn't think they could move far enough to be out of the ear shot of the Elves, something he understood Draco knew.
Soren rose as he did, offering a similar nod in return. He could breathe a little easier with the offer accepted. It was not much, in the grand scheme of things, but the bridge between them was on it's way to being mended. A lot would ride on Harry's decision and attitude toward the wolves when the time came to discuss what had happened, but with so much happening they would need to focus on that when it arrived. As dark eyes watched Hendrik's large form leave the room, Soren's thoughts returned to the boys who remained quiet, two floors above him.
Now, standing outside the Elf's door, Harry was having second thoughts about this visit. Maybe he should have just summoned Lothair or something. Granted, he didn't think the other Elf would take too kindly to being summoned. Especially if he was the one doing the summoning. Perhaps, arriving like this was the better plan. At least there was a higher chance of actually getting to speak with him.
Beside him, Hermione rolled her eyes loudly. Harry could practically hear the exaggerated movement of her eyes in their sockets as she expressed her complete and utter exasperation. If he was honest, he was sometimes surprised that she had put up with their nonsense for as long as she had ... then again, in all fairness, it wasn't like she was innocent. She'd joined in on just as much nonsense.
Harry rolled his eyes, blushing slightly under both Lothair's speculation and Ilaria's praise. Draco, for his part, had also raised an eyebrow more in surprise than anything. It wasn't that he thought Potter was not observant. He was a seeker, after all. Draco just hadn't thought he knew much about anything beyond Quidditch and whatever stupid luck that had kept him alive this long.
"Most of the ritual will be up to me to perform," Rosalind instructed, turning her full attention to Harry and stressing the importance of what she was about to say, "You, however,
A snort from down the table had Harry glancing down to meet Draco's eyes, if only for a moment before stormy grey shifted away from him. "I do not have numbers, nor will I be able to get them if I'm in the Realm," he continued, forcing himself to look back to the Councillors. "We benefit more if we are able to move freely across the border. Returning to Hogwarts will place us perfectly. I shall have access to Dumbledore and the Order. Draco will have access to information on Voldemort's movements."
He did know better, however, because the thought was ridiculous. Malfoy had not shown any signs that he appreciated the current bond between them. He'd all but rejected it and Harry couldn't really blame him, even if it did weigh heavily on him. It was like a weight had settled on his chest and if he thought too hard on it, it started to crush the breath from him. He'd been given various explanations to what this bond was or what it could be, but Harry hadn't bothered trying to figure it out. He didn't
She nodded, unfazed by what he was saying. "The High Lord has told me the basics. I am already prepared for the first objective."
Draco wasn't sure what that meant but everyone else seemed to immediately grasp the situation. He wanted to ask what that meant but they were already moving to surround Harry.
Harry had a million and one things to say about having to hold a council to punish the ones responsible for Draco's injures, but he held his tone. Soren was right. Draco did need help and that had to come first. He would have his chance to punish the wolves; he simply had to be patient. A hard task, given his current emotional state, but one he was intent on completing.
Distractedly, he lifted his wand and cast the appropriate stasis spell. Without compensating for the fact that he no longer needed the wand, his magic flowed through the piece of holly, shattering it and erupting the otherwise docile potion in front of him with a loud bang, startling the entire classroom as he, Zabini, and everyone within a three-foot radius were covered in pale blue goo. Pieces of his wand were scattered around them, a smouldering feather at his feet the only indication that it had actually been a wand.
Continuing on, they found fourteen separate bedrooms, each with its own restroom. "I think she's outdone herself," Harry commented, opening the door to one of the rooms. The colour scheme reminded him of his room at Jade manor and he was instantly drawn to the enchanted view of the lake from his windows
Moving to the low wall that Lothair was perched on, he set the box down and lifted the lid. Beside him, Lothair let out a low whistle at the sight of the sword that lay nestled in a deep blue silk. Even Draco had to blink in surprise. It was gorgeous. The metal of the blade was so pale that Draco had to wonder what the hell it was even made of. There were unfamiliar characters running up the blade until it reached a hilt of deep, smokey grey. The hilt, itself, was something to be admired in its simplicity. Despite the lack of decoration, it seemed to enhance the beauty of the sword with a simple cross section, a leather bound grip, and a silver cage for a pommel that encased the deepest sapphire draco had ever seen. Beside the sword lay a sheath and baldric of dragon hide in the same colour, accented by the silver buckles and circular plate that had the royal crest embossed on it. This sword was not meant to be worn at the waist. It was meant to be carried across his back.
"The big deal," She flushed all the more at that, "is that they now think there is something inappropriate going on. You invited a girl into your bathing room, Harry! You didn't even do so quietly. Innocent intentions or not, the whole castle will know by daybreak!"
Since the guards were stationed at the gate twenty-four hours, Draco's first thought was that perhaps it was a citizen taking advantage of the hour and the lack of occupants the grounds would have. It didn't alleviate his suspicion. It certainly didn't explain the odd sensation he was feeling. It was almost like an electric charge lingering in the air and Draco, if he was honest, couldn't think of a reason for it's cause.
The sound of fabric rustling and the uneven sound of a single set of footsteps echoed through the dark and otherwise silent hallways of Hogwarts castle. With the students home for the summer months there was no fear of others noticing his presence. He and the house elves would be the only individual roaming the halls. Of that, he was quite positive. Even the ridiculous caretaker would be tucked away in one of the many rooms within the castle.
Following the flow of shadows cast by the soft moonlight streaming in the windows, Draco moved forward silently until his eyes finally fell upon the source of most of his problems. The castle was pockmarked with various courtyards that were open to the night sky. Most stayed close to the outer walls where the castle didn't rise into higher stories and towers. They were meant for the court ... or the court that should have been within the castle. There was no court now. Anyone who had been a part of it had retreated to their own lands, Jade Manor left empty without anyone to sit on the throne. The courtyards were now mainly used for training by the guards ... or, in this instance, the training of a Prince.
Harry flushed, jerking his eyes away from Draco in his embarrassment over being found out so easily. It didn't make him any less suspicious regarding the blond's intentions but, perhaps, he'd be less willing to try something if he knew Harry was expecting it. "Why'd you want me to lead you around anyway?" he asked, refusing to glance over again, even as he asked the question on his mind.
His vision of the stars was blocked as Gwen leaned over him, raising an eyebrow at his obvious pouting. "You're such a baby," she chided, reaching out to haul him onto his feet.
"I've been here a while, but I certainly wasn't idle. You know how I feel about the Royal Guard: absolutely lazy, the lot of them. They have spent far too long soaking up the luxuries that peace has offered them. I, for one, am quite glad to have a Prince in the castle once more. At least now they have no reason to skip their training sessions and even more reason to heed my warnings."
trying to seduce me, this was a misstep," Draco says, around his thrumming heart that's suddenly leapt into his throat. He swallows around it. It's hard to discern Potter's expression, but Draco can hardly be blamed, considering how much harder it is to focus on
Draco screams. Blood seeps up from every accursed line of the Dark Mark, his arm flayed in the shape of Voldemort's snake-tongued skull. Griselda presses her finger harder, right over the skull's forehead, and the tattoo carves itself again, blood flowing faster and darker, and Draco keeps screaming. His throat is raw with it, his face wet not just with blood but with tears, too.
The accusation hits him harder than any slap Pansy could have dished out. Cold down his body in icy waves, his molars suddenly ground tightly against each other. "What?"
He can feel Hermione looking at him, can feel her radiating disappointment, which seems unfair to Draco. "I didn't hurt him," he huffs. "You don't have to look at me like you might like to punch me again."
"Fashion changed my life. It saved me," Draco says in a low voice, a beat too late. It's so maudlin, and he nearly wishes he hadn't said it—but it's true. And he needs Potter to understand. "It's more than fabric."
He pulls Potter's free hand closer with both hands, releasing his wand hand; Potter shudders, but doesn't pull away. It's surreal, feeling the scattered callus of Potter's palm, the warmth of the softer skin of the back of his hand, the missing fingertip, the muscle and fat and sinew of a part of Potter's living body; Draco can feel dissociation at the edge of his consciousness, ready to take him away, and now he needs to focus, too. "Focus on this," he says to both Potter and himself, and starts rubbing slow, gentle circles with his thumb into the palm of Potter's hand.
Draco could say it so plainly. The order of events is honestly simple, but when he considers doing just that—saying it plainly—he's suffocated by humiliation.
are you wearing?" he demands, because unfortunately, he loves it, and it's very much upstaging him. The question is nearly redundant—he recognizes the upper half of Pansy's ensemble to be a near-perfect replica of a dress from a portrait of Marie de Medici, attached to a tiny skirt so flared it's nearly parallel to the floor. Only an explosion of starched tulle beneath it saves Pansy's considerable arse from being shown to king and country.
"You don't seem to be a wizard who knows how to do them well," Harry laughs. "Having a bit of trouble there, Malfoy?"
"You're a guest in my home, Malfoy, you can have a bit of wine. Aren't you your own boss? Who am I going to tell?"
Draco goes first to the manor, because as much as he loves that Harry brought him clothes from his own wardrobe at Grimmauld Place to wear, they're much too big, and Draco doesn't want to smell like hospital anymore. He wants to smell like his tea tree oil soap and lemon verbena shampoo; he wants to smell like himself, without the lingering scent of blood and fear and Sleeping Draught.
"Harry." Draco murmurs his name close to his ear, and Harry shudders, but he subsides. "What if you get there and you see your friends who love you?"
unless you count being in the closet together as a thing." And then, "Blaise Zabini. I had a massive crush on him."
"It's a critique, not a criticism," Williamson says, as if that changes anything. "And I'm too old to be anything but candid, Malfoy."
"Now, why lie to me, Potter?" Draco murmurs, switching to his silk pins. Potter grunts again. He could probably come around to Potter's front to see what kind of face he's making to go with that sound, but he's sincerely invested in the drape of the back of this robe. This time, the shoulders are actually a smidge too wide, hanging just far enough past Potter's imaginary shoulder seam to look awkward and ill-fitting. To Draco's eye, anyway. He pins.
Lucius's adjoining suite is the same as he left it, only now the furnishings are covered in muslin. A fine layer of dust coats everything; it is the one room in the Manor that the house-elves are not allowed to enter. She turns her gaze above the fireplace and comes forward. Her hand trembles for only a second before she reaches for the edge of the fabric and pulls.
Instantly, the piercing shards of agony that sliced through him muddled, morphing to a slow burn as Potter drank. The pull on his flesh was tugging and beckoning, and to his horror, his body was responding. This was nothing like the first bite. It was only a taste of what was to come.
Draco stands motionless, blank-faced, as if Harry's just introduced a concept that is completely alien to his scope of thought.
It was late, and Draco didn’t really feel like gearing up to make his first appearance in the world at large just yet. “Why don’t we go tomorrow afternoon, before we head to the Weasley supper?”
Neville's talking about soil aeration, but Narcissa can't bring herself to listen. Instead, she's focused on the way their arms are entwined, and the way his left hand is covering hers in the crook of his elbow. His thumb is rubbing absently across the back of her hand as he goes on, and she realizes that he's the first man to touch her in a way that isn't within the bounds of polite propriety in
He doesn't know where the strength comes from, but he hauls Draco up and rolls him over to cover him with his body and kiss him breathless. The taste of himself is bitter on Draco's tongue, and he relishes in it, pulling back to rasp, "You're mine, Draco. Mine."
A hint of a sad smile crossed the vampire’s lips. “Another tangible reminder of extremely poor decision-making?”
"What's changed, then? Why are you here now?" Draco swallowed, knowing where Potter was going with his confession, but unsure of whether or not he wanted the answer.
His days of pathetically attempted evil are long behind him, which apparently the DMLE knows, since they’ve begged him to come in and consult (for an extravagant fee, no less) on a particularly difficult case involving an illegal potions smuggling ring.
Potter's hand fell to his side. "And that's the other thing. I had every intention of making this a lab for you when you mentioned it. But after I…I hurt you, I knew I needed to make it as perfect as possible. At first, I was angry. Angry with you because you should have known better than to bleed in my presence." Draco's eyebrow rose, but Potter put up a hand. "I know, I know. And then I was angry at myself for thinking that. You were suspended in a moment that had forgotten you. You were not at fault, I was. All this control I fight to keep every day, and I came undone from the scent of your blood." Potter shook his head and dropped his eyes to the floor. "There is a time and a place to lose that control. Standing over your mother wasn't it." It felt like ages for Potter to lift his head and fix him with those eyes. "I'm sorry, Draco. You don't know how much. I was overwhelmed with what I—the bond makes me feel for you." Potter's eyes were pleading for him to understand. "All I knew is that you were in pain, and I—the bond urged me to comfort you. But you were bleeding, and there's a part of me that reconciles all that. Hurt, blood, and sex all equal comfort to that baser side of me. It was never meant to discount your grief. Only distract you from it." Potter's hands clenched into fists at his side. "I am a man, a wizard, and a vampire. I am a dark creature, with dark magic, and even darker desires. But I don't want to be a monster."
“I know!” Ron agreed, noting his surprise. “And then Mum said, I swear this is the best part, that Ginny had every right to be an obnoxious twat, but if she was going to start spouting shite like that, she could bloody well do it in her own flat, because she sure as hell wasn’t going to do it here!” Ron’s body was convulsing in gasped laughter. “And then, oh, Merlin, Mum grabbed her by the arm and chucked her out the front door without another word!” He collapsed back on the sofa, shaking his hands in the air. “Fuck, I think that was the single greatest thing I have ever seen in my life, and I watched you come back from the dead to kill old Where’s-His-Nose!”
He wanted to scream and yell, kick and cry, and maybe even throw something breakable at Potter's head. But looking at the expression on Potter's face, he knew it wouldn't do any good. The vampire was single-minded, yet vacillated all the same. It wasn't worth the effort to get enraged anymore. Disappointment was disappointment, no matter how spectacular or subdued the tantrum. Potter used to be worth the tantrum. Not anymore.
Harry grips the armrests of the chair tighter, preparing to see just how much the house is willing to accommodate him. "Fine," he says loudly into the air, "I'll accept the head. But I prefer to take my meals in a more intimate setting." That's the truth; he really doesn't want to spend the rest of his meals here down at the arse-other end of the table. The rectangular monstrosity seats sixteen, which given that it's only the three of them, is ridiculous. Harry waits, curious to see what happens next.
The full-on blush that stains his upper body at the praise makes Harry's mouth water. He accepts the proffered items and gestures for Draco to stand. He grips the crop by the handle and points it to the table in the center of the room.
“Well, you’re looking a bit better, at any rate,” she said. “Still a little too pale for my liking, though. Get some sunshine.”
Potter's tousled head appeared over the back, his grim expression making Snape's fingers curl into the upholstery until the fabric cut into the pads of his fingers.
"Yes, you're so maligned." Harry rolls his eyes and straightens. "I like this. That we can laugh together. Talk together."
Draco turned, and Harry watched through half-lidded eyes as he ascended the stairs, stiff-backed and sure-footed, with all the cold poise of centuries of pureblood genetics. Saving face. A stab of disturbing clarity cut through the fog in his brain, and he knew Snape was right. Eventually, Draco would break. Then Draco would run. And Harry knew he wasn't going to do a fucking thing to stop him.
Potter stared down at him with eyes that had grown darker in color. The bright emerald deepened to almost black and swirled with a fire and ferocity that beckoned Draco to their depths. Inexorably, their faces grew closer and Draco was sure that Potter was about to kiss him savagely when a familiar, but unplaceable scent drew his attention.
Draco slips out of bed and into his slippers, not bothering with a dressing gown, before following Harry across the hall to his room.
"So you did." Neville's voice pitches low, and there's a look in his eye that she hasn't seen directed in her way in a very, very long time. "I think I might like to catch a peek of you in your flip-flops sometime."
Harry's hands reach up to grab the frame just below Draco's. He holds his body back to keep from touching, but close enough to feel the heat radiating from Draco's skin. His lips graze beneath Draco's ear, right at the dip behind his earlobe. It's a soft, reverent kiss, and Harry has to close his eyes as he breathes in Draco's scent. He kisses his way down to where Draco's neck meets his shoulder, trading in the chaste press of lips for a wet, open-mouthed perusal.
Draco whined in the back of his throat, hot and pitiful. "Please," he begged, not giving a shit about his dignity when Potter had those two amazing fingers in his arse. He wanted Potter's cock, he wanted stimulation, he wanted it all, and he wasn't above begging to get it. "Fuck me! Merlin—just…please! Fuck me!"
When he advanced, it was so quick that for a second he thought Potter was about bend him over and do exactly that. The sudden arousal that spiked let him know that his body didn’t seem averse to the idea. Especially when Potter stared at him with clear and blatant interest. Draco opened his mouth to head off any such rash decision with a snarky retort, but Potter’s eyes went soft and drifted to his neck.
He sags against Harry, but his lips move against Harry's at a frenetic pace, as if he's pouring everything he is into the kiss. It's open-mouthed, with too much tongue and never enough heat. It's wet, gorgeous, and filthy-sweet—just the way Harry wants him.
Potter's eyes glistened as they welled with moisture, but he neither spoke nor moved. And that said more than any of the fighting or the fucking between them.
It was on the tip of his tongue to remind him that not more than twelve hours ago Potter had been knuckles-deep inside Draco’s arse with his mouth wrapped around his cock, and if that didn’t make one gay, well, what did? But the resigned expression and strained tension on Potter’s face made him decide on the better part of valor and keep his opinion to himself for the moment. However, there had already been two clear (and very, very gay) occasions in which Draco would have bet good Galleons on Potter riding the proverbial broomstick, so he formulated his interrogation accordingly.
Potter licked him clean with the reverence of a saint for his deity, then slid back up Draco’s body to mouth at his lips. Draco returned the kiss half-heartedly, panting through the blissful fog that enshrouded his brain.
Draco is hot and tight and Harry strokes him twice before edging in a second finger. Draco tenses, and Harry's hand curls tighter as he fucks deeper with his fingers. Draco's pupils are blown wide, leaving only a tiny ring of stormy gray around the black center.
Harry nods his head in agreement. "Yes. You've a hell of a head for business, you appreciate art, and you're the only one who can corral your girlfriend when she goes off on a weird-arse tangent like insisting on parading around the gallery naked so patrons can see her 'at her most creative state'."
“Very well,” Draco supplied. “Arthur, it is.” He held out a slightly shaky hand, which Arthur took without the slightest reservation. They shook warmly and he ushered Draco further inside.
Harry watches her go, head held high, with smooth, gliding steps. He can still feel her warmth, just like he can feel the Manor's magic wrapped around his knees. It's determined to ground him here, to brand him into this place, to make him a part of it. He wonders if he should feel guilty about the way he's responding to Narcissa Malfoy. He wonders if it's an insult to his own mother. Somehow, Harry has the feeling that if everything had happened in the opposite direction, he'd be watching Lily Potter mother Draco Malfoy.
Draco's face is red, embarrassed, and Harry can tell he's on the edge of either bursting into tears or lunging at Harry to have a go. His head whips back to Harry and he challenges, "You tell me to come to you, and I do, and then you tell me to leave. You run hot and cold, and I swear, you're just like—"
He murmurs gentle praise into Draco's ear as he releases his neck and strokes him through the aftershocks. Draco's head falls against the back of the couch, eyes closed as he shudders. Harry eases his fingers from Draco's body and gives him a moment to recover.
Harry's breath leaves him in a rush. Draco's heartfelt admission is staggering. "I can't even begin to know how you feel. I'm so sorry, Draco."
Narcissa pulls him in tight for a hug, wrapping her arms around him in comfort. He sags in the embrace, knowing she's always been strong enough to hold him up at his worst. It is one of her most defining qualities.
Ron became considerably more animated, fueled by his glee at divulging the tale. “It’s like this—Mum was all in a tizzy about you and Draco, Merlin that feels weird to say, coming to dinner. She was at sixes and sevens, rushing us all about to make things perfect. And Ginny huffed and snarked off, saying how she couldn’t believe we were all putting ourselves out for a Malfoy.” He looked a little sheepish as he continued, “Mate, I tell you, she said some nasty things about the both of you, and went on about you flaunting your fangs and that this thing between you and him was disgusting and unnatural, and that we were all terrible for going along with it and not trying to make you see sense.” Ron paused for a breath. “Anyway, Mum started yelling that Ginny needed to shut it, and that we wanted to do this for you, that we were family, and family supports each other. Well, then Ginny shoots her mouth off and said the only way you would be family was if you had married her.”
"You're goddamned right I did!" she shouts back. "I survived. I survived the Dark Lord, and I survived you. Now I'm going to live. Every breath I take from now on is a breath I take to spite you. This is the last time you will look upon my face, because the dead do not live here. I only hope that Hell treats you as favorably as you have treated us."
Potter’s fangs bit down, sharp as always, but instead of the drugging pull, Potter’s mouth was gentle. Something stung, and he realized it wasn’t Potter’s bite, but the salt of his tears that burned on the wound. The deep draws of before were gone, and this time Potter nuzzled Draco’s flesh with soft, tender touches, suckling like a babe at the breast.
Harry slumps back in the booth. "Yeah, why not? I've got nothing else to do with my time. And I'm pretty good. Maybe I'll open a gallery, feature my own work as well as some local artists. You know Luna's got her hands in with her sculptures. They're not bad," he says, nodding to himself. "I think they'd sell."
Draco gasped in astonishment as his climax rocketed through him, spurred on by Potter’s sudden imperative, as if the word alone could make him come on command.
The effect is instantaneous, and the wind blows from Draco's sails. His shoulders droop as his face lines with remorse. To his credit, he swallows, but does not look away, taking the rebuke and shouldering its consequences.
"I don't deserve you," she whispers into the warmth of his chest. He pushes her back to smile at her, and it's all she can do to keep her knees from buckling.
Draco's scent strolls into the room a good five seconds before he does, and Harry's head turns as if pulled by an invisible tether to watch him walk in the door. A swell of emotion rises in his chest like a wave breaking the shore and Harry knows in this instant that he is gone. Hopelessly gone.
That one sentence contained more words than they'd spoken to each other in the past three weeks, and Draco didn't know if it was the soft-spoken quality to his words, or the 'please', or the silent hope that was banked far back in the depths of Potter's eyes, but he dropped his spoon into his oatmeal and he stood up.
It takes Harry's brain a few seconds to process the implication of those three little words, but when it does, Harry grabs Draco by the face and
The repudiation in Harry's tone hits it mark. Zabini's face is blank for a moment, and then his lips curve into a cruel smile. "Attention?" he laughs derisively. "Yes, Draco's always been high maintenance. He's like a fat, spoiled housecat," he says with mocking spite. "Sooner bite you than look at you, but if you offer him a saucer of cream, he'll twine around your ankles and stick his arse in the air."
“It’s a dream, Potter. The reality is that I’ll be here, doing nothing with my time except reading your old magazines, and doing my best to make sure what’s left of my wealth can sustain me until either you or I finally expire.” Draco laid his head back and closed his eyes. “And what about you? How do you plan to spend the rest of this existence we have together? Since terrorizing people at large is no longer an option, what will you do with your time?”
Low moans he had no hope of preventing seemed to echo around him as those soft lips found their way over the smooth expanse of Harry's neck and then the defined line of his jaw. At the base of his ear the sensations changed. The gentle kisses were replaced with the tip of a tongue as it traced the new curve of Harry's pointed ear. Upon reaching the delicate point, sharp teeth carefully pulled the sensitive flesh between those smooth lips, earning a desperate whimper that drastically tightened the ever-building heat building below his navel.
They'd gone over basic glamours in their training with Soren but they hadn't tried to do anything as detailed as a complete glamour. They'd changed the colour of their eyes or hair, but nothing as extensive as what they were currently expected to do. Closing his eyes, Harry focused on the image he wanted to create. Searching his mind, he brought up an image from before he'd started to change. He held the image for a moment, studying it. He was shorter, his hair was its usual mess, his glasses sat crookedly on his nose and his clothing had returned to the worn-out jeans and t-shirt he'd favoured.
Harry's had swiveled around to shoot him possibly the dirtiest look he'd ever seen on the Gryffindor's face, but stopped walking with such a dramatic flare. It earned him an amused snort from the blond behind him, whose steps quickly made up the distance now that Harry wasn't quite so intent on putting as much space between them as he could as quickly as possible. He wasn't sure why Draco hadn't gone off to find someone else to give him the tour of the castle. Hell, he still got lost when he tried to navigate the place. Surely there were people more equipped for this sort of thing. His eyes narrowed suspiciously, cutting over to sneak a glance to the taller man. Why had Draco asked him? Was he intending on finally getting his revenge on Harry for pulling him into this mess? Did he have something horrible planned?
Lifting his head, he rubbed at his tired eyes before standing. At this rate, he'd die of exhaustion before he managed to accomplish anything. Between Ilaria's new training regiment and his inability to sleep through the night, it was a wonder he was still functioning. Standing, he moved into the bathing room. Eyeing himself in the mirror, he smiled wryly. He had to hand it to the Elves. With the exception of the troubled eyes staring back at him, there was no sign of his exhaustion. He looked just as he always did.
He'd debated asking Lothair about it but he could already hear the disdain in the older Elf's voice. Maybe he'd just write to Soren and ask him. It would take longer, he supposed, but at least he was guaranteed more information and less attitude.
Rosalind nodded, "Yes, when it comes to bonds there is always a dominant and a submissive. Given your bloodline and the fact that it was your blood that was used in the transfusion with Draco, it was assumed that you would become the dominant. Due to the werewolf traits, there is a chance that the dominance will shift from you to Draco."
Even with two days to argue their points, Harry still wasn't comfortable with Draco tagging along. There were too many variables, which had caused the weight on his chest to double. He was restless and his mood suffered for it. Even Erebus shifted beneath him in response to the trapped energy rippling beneath the strong glamour he was currently wearing. Gone were the elven clothes and features. He'd been returned to how he'd appeared the last time he'd visited Hogwarts. Draco too, wore the form Harry had remembered seeing that last train ride back from Hogwarts, sneer included.
"We were standing in the dungeon and he said he could hear something," Draco responded, watching as the older elf found Harry's pulse point, pausing there for a moment before moving to lift his eyelid. "He said he could hear something. I listened but there was nothing. Whatever it was only Harry could hear it. Then there was a sudden buildup and release of pressure. The idiot shoved me out of the way and it hit him in the chest. He started screaming immediately. Akkar had to knock him out in order for me to move him."
He felt Akkar emerge behind him, the guard had already disappeared into his glamour. Anyone who looked into the corridor would only see Draco, standing alone in front of a dusty tapestry depicting some long-forgotten battle. Taking stock of where this entrance was, Draco began to make his way toward the more commonly used portions of the dungeon. Snape would already be in the classroom and Draco had time before the students arrived. Snape never opened his doors until the last possible moment, preferring to keep his contact with the students to a bare minimum.
"Under normal circumstances, this would have been a non-issue. Humans are not allowed into the realm. We've put up both physical and magical barriers to ensure that they don't," Sore continued, unfazed by Harry's stubbornness. "Draco is the first human to enter the realm in centuries. The fact that he managed to enter the realm is enough of a problem on it's own."
After a moment, when Harry realized he was still staring, he accepted the offered hand, allowing Gwynn to help him to his feet. He did have to admit that he was still stinging a bit by the fact that he'd been put knocked on his arse by a girl. Sure, he wasn't used to the training and he was a good deal behind in comparison, but that knowledge didn't do much to sooth his ego. Why he was even bothered was a mystery to him. Hermione beat him in marks all the time and he'd never felt humiliated by that.
Draco's eyes narrowed not from the comment but from the steady, quiet tone. It was a statement of fact. Nothing more. It wasn't the Potter, Draco was used to and he couldn't say he liked the change all that much. "Don't give me that bullshit," he snapped, taking the initiative to move around to the front since Harry didn't seem all that interested in looking at him. "No one has seen hide nor hair of you for two days and now you're out here sitting atop a stone pillar like a bloody rooster."
Despite the name, the place was more of a Castle than a Manor, but Draco didn't care. Under other circumstances, he'd have taken great pleasure in his surrounding. He'd have loved to spend hours studying the portraits on the wall or the paintings depicting battles and conflicts he wasn't familiar with. The whole place was full of things he had no knowledge on. As it stood, he passed by them silently, a heavy cloud following as he moved until, gradually, the sound of voices began to dawn on him; until a familiar voice dawned on him.
Harry stood in the same spot he had been. From where he knelt, Draco could see the brunette's chest heaving, sword now hanging at his side Harry's fingers were still wrapped tightly around the grip. For a moment, their eyes met and it looked like the Gryffindor was going to say something but it never made it past his lips. Harry's eyes rolled back into his head and he crumpled.
"Our army?" Harry questioned before realization clicked in. "Oh, you mean the room of requirements?" He thought about it for a moment before shaking his head. "No good. Too many people know about it and Dumbledore could access it if he wanted to."
furious, even several hours later. It seemed that every time he interacted with Potter it left him in that very state. It also didn't help that a snide little voice – that suspiciously sounded an awful lot like Pansy - had crept into the back of his head had asked him why he'd stopped referring to the other male as "
His willingness to continue was testament to his determination and Rosalind couldn't prevent the fond smile from forming on her pale features. He was a good boy, this Harry Potter. He would be a good match for the Kingdom in time. "Up on the bed, please," she responded, nodding toward the bed in which Draco lay. It had been expanded enough to fit a second body, but Harry wasn't entirely sure it had been expanded at all. The spot left open for him looked particularly tiny. "Up you get and roll up your sleeve, please. I'll need your wrist clear."
Glancing back to Draco, he found only the rigidly straight back of the blond. There wasn't any question as to where the influx of magic was coming from. Even Lothair's well trained mare tried to skitter away from him. There wasn't anything to see, but Harry could have sworn he saw blue flames rising up to lick at Draco's limbs. A moment later, he blinked and the image was gone as quickly as it had come. No signs of the blonds magic save the heavy presence lingering in the air.
"What do you suggest we do then, Ron? Using your Father's car to rescue him like in second year?" Hermione asked, nearly groaning when Ron's eyes lit up at the suggestion. Sometimes she really did wonder how he had made it so far in life. "This isn't a bedroom that you're breaking him out of. It's a kingdom. A magical kingdom, no less. There are strict rules about communication let alone abducting one of their own."
Draco didn't ask questions, he simply scooped up the smaller man and headed down the corridor toward the entrance to the Chamber. He barely registered the shuffling of feet behind him. He was furious both with Harry for doing something so stupid and with himself for not being able to sense whatever it was that Harry had.
"I don't know," he muttered, rubbing idly at a spot on his chest that lay just above his heart. "I can't seem to concentrate." Which wasn't entirely the truth, but it was as far as he was going to explain. Every time he attempted to focus his mind on the task at hand, Harry's mind started to fill with a sense of panic that he simply didn't understand.
"He's the decoy." The words left a terrible taste in his mouth and the raising of Lothair's eyebrow told him that they sounded as terrible as it had felt to say them. "He can't know."
"You have to give him your blood freely," Soren responded calmly, as though it was the simplest thing in the world. It really was quite simple, in the end. "His own body can't create the energy needed to heal the wounds from the wolves. Your own blood, however, has properties within it that will allow him to overcome the weaknesses in his own. You must let the boy feed off of you."
Soren's posture and tone told Harry all that he needed to know. If there was another possible way, Soren would have steered him in that direction. His choice now was based on pure necessity. If Harry wanted to save Malfoy, this was what was needed. Beneath the weight of that realization, Harry could admit to being afraid. "I'm worried about the repercussions," he admitted quietly, shifting his position so he could peer past Soren's taller form and find the occupied bed at the other end of the hall. Draco, even now, looked deathly pale and that made Harry's entire body thrum with an urgent energy. "I'm worried about his reaction. It isn't going to be positive."
I do not own Harry Potter or anything from the Harry Potter verse. That honour belongs to J.K Rowling and the production of this story was based solely on a creativity and imagination. There have been no monetary gain from the production of this story, nor will there be in the future. It is simply for the enjoyment of it's readers.
Whether he be Muggle, Wizard, or Elf, Harry's ears perked at the thought of food. It really was amazing how quickly he could let go of what troubled him in the face of a decent meal. It was part of the reason he was always so excited to be at The Burrow. Molly Weasley was the best bloody cook he knew, but these Elves weren't half bad either. "Do you think they could make me some treacle tart?" he asked hopefully, hoping down himself and following along after her.
Continuing down the corridor, his ears perked at the sound of life that was steadily growing louder. Harry's curiosity was peaked the moment the sound reached his ears. Having been born and raised outside of this world, he was immensely curious of those living within it. Soren, Lothair, and Ilaria were all very different from each other and although he did, for the most part, like them, Harry was still interested in finding someone who might be a little … younger. As he drew closer to the sounds of life, a gentle breeze flowed gracefully down the empty corridor to wrap itself around him, bringing with it the scents of sand and pine needles.
He supposed it wasn't quite like that, but Potter didn't need to know about his own insecurities. Frankly, he'd suddenly found himself in an unfamiliar realm and surrounded by unfamiliar faces. Potter was the one familiar face in a sea of uncertainty. Was he prideful enough to claim that it was because Potter owed him? Absolutely. Beyond which, he was sure it was the only explanation that he could give that the Gryffindor was likely to accept without too much questioning which, given the glower he was currently getting, had been right on the money.
"Good Morning, Sheedra!" Harry chirped, having sat up a bit straighter during her lecture and flashing a blinding bright smile in the woman's direction. "You look absolutely lovely today, has anyone told you that?"
"I agree," he quietly responded. What harm could it really do? He was already out of his depth. What did it matter if he went a little deeper down the rabbit hole."
The slight shifting of Gabriel's eyes to a spot over Draco's right shoulder and he clearing of a throat had the blond paling slightly. He hadn't felt anyone coming down the connecting corridor moments earlier, but he didn't need to turn around to know who was now standing here.
The annoyed sound cut him off before he could ask the question Lothair clearly thought was going to be stupid.
Of course, with the day he'd had so far, it was, perhaps, a bit too naive to assume that he would be slipping away that easily. With his first movement, the entire situation seemed to explode. The three wolves shot forward, their large claws leaving marks in the earth at the force applied. The smaller of the two moved directly forward, hitting the wolf standing with Draco at a speed that the blond wouldn't have thought the large creatures were capable of. The largest of the three, much to Draco's horror, headed toward him. He barely had enough time to turn onto his stomach before the wolf was on him, warm breath that smelled of rotted meat ghosting over his exposed neck as a sharp set of claws dug into his back, tearing skin and muscle as they moved. Draco could help the scream that was torn from him. This pain was beyond anything he'd felt before, both physical and emotional. He could feel every inch the claws tore through.
Even before he'd fully registered the meaning behind her words, Harry could feel his jaw dropping open and the colour rising up his neck to paint his cheeks and ears a lovely shade of scarlet. He sputtered for a moment, his feathers ruffled by the comment.
That was something, at the very least, Draco thought. Even still, he felt numb at all the information he'd taken in. His life had been completely turned on it's head and now, it had been spun around. He didn't know which way was up anymore. Elves, werewolves, wizards, death eaters. Where the bloody hell did he fit in among them now?
"You'll be fine," he commented, waving off Harry's concern. "Focus on what you want to accomplish and reach out slowly."
She took several moments before answering, her eyes scanning the boundaries of their lands as her mind worked on drawing up the best course of action. In such a situation even the smallest miscalculation could set into motion a series of events that would have drastic consequences. "We have several outposts along the borders that could be up and running within a day or so. The outposts at Galëgori," she explained, her hand moving to touch each location as she spoke. "Zalthorián, as well as Antölia are the largest outposts we have along the borders and are spread out enough that through combined effort they can cover the entirety of the boundaries. We should send word to them and have them at the ready. If Roland is planning an attack, he'll have to move through them first, which will buy us enough time to get the main army ready to meet him in the valley."
The sound of the door clicking softly as it shut, had him glancing back over his shoulder. Rosalind offered him another small smile, this one tinged with what he assumed was worry and that made his blood run cold. So there was something wrong. Was he going to die after all? "What is it?" he asked, wondering if he really wanted to know her answer. He wasn't entirely sure if he was going to be able to handle whatever it was that she had to tell him.
Despite the quiet of the halls, there would be one light that would still be burning. That was his current destination and, like a moth to the flame, he continued on his way despite the continued hazards he knew he would be facing. "Lemon Drop," the smooth voice echoed strangely down the corridor before being swallowed by the sound of stone grinding against stone as the statue guarding the Headmaster's Office shifted, presenting to him the stairwell that would lead him upward. It wasn't a surprise that the door to the office was open, nor was it was surprise to find the Headmaster sitting behind his desk, calmly waiting for him. A benefit of being the Headmaster meant the continued knowledge of what was happening within the school. The moment he had crossed the wards, Dumbledore had known.
"Stop feeling sorry for yourself, already!" she demanded, shooting him a pointed look that dared him to argue that he wasn't. It was there all over his face. Pity. "They do not favour him over you. You're the rightful heir to the throne and nothing is going to change that. This Malfoy of yours is just another subject under your rule and he'll see that soon enough."
Gwynn shrugged off his incredulous look, moving to pick up Harry's sword from where it had fallen. "And you should be working on learning to defend yourself properly. However do you expect to survive Roland's attacks if you can barely even block my own?"
"Unlike you," he commented, "I didn't blab to Dumbledore about my newfound abilities, which means that as far as they're concerned I'm my usual self."
Closing his eyes for a moment. Soren debated his options. Draco wasn't a wizard anymore and his insistence that he return to school had ramifications that ran deeper than just the anger Harry might be feeling over it. It went against centuries of regulations and that was if Harry chose to remain behind. "Send out a summons to the Council," he finally sighed, earning a surprised look from the other Elf. It had been decades since they'd summoned the Council.
"Nothing," he responded, forcing himself to stop the movement of his hand. It soothed the ache within his chest, but the last thing he wanted to do was draw attention to it. For all he knew, the strange ache was nothing more then a strained muscle for all the sword swinging. Gwynn would never let him live it down if that was the case. He didn't even want to think about the possibility of Lothair finding out. That was one sneering face he really didn't want to deal with.
"Of course, you did. You just happened to make all these shots when there just happened to be no one around to witness it."
Draco watched as Potter grinned, accepting the hand as the girl pulled him to his feet. He watched as Potter lingered, grinning like an idiot, his hand still holding onto hers. The anger inside of him began to swell, washing over him in wave after wave. Unlike the Gryffindor in front of him, Draco had always been good at keeping his emotions in check. Potter, really, had been the only one irritating enough to push him past his limit and that didn't seem to be changing. Still his hand was in hers and something inside of Draco snapped beneath the weight of all that had happened.
Breaking out of his inner fascination with the colour scheme, Harry cleared his throat. "There's a few things I want to talk to you about."
Snape made a face and made a motion with his hand to dismiss the comment. "Showcasing his usual idiocy, of course."
When he glanced back to her, she was facing him, her eyes shifting to draw his attention. Following the path, he noticed the slight tilt of Draco's face and one flashing silver eye pinned on them. Narrowing his own eyes, he turned back to Gwynn and offered her the brightest unconstrained smile he could muster. Leaving Gwynn to blink in surprise. It was an advantage he'd learned early on, especially when it came to softening Sheedra into giving him extra helpings of food. Though, by the dazed look on Gwynn's face and the sudden influx of magic thrumming through the circle, it worked a bit too well.
Silence again. Draco couldn't blame them. He was having a hard time processing what Potter was saying. He'd heard of a Horcrux. His family had a penchant for dark magic, after all, but he'd never found anything on how to actually create them. To create one was insane. How many had that bastard created?
Harry just shrugged. "If she can shift the room of requirements into whatever a person needs, she should be able to rearrange this place."
Draco's eyes scanned the group, his entire body stilling as they landed on Severus, the brief flash of surprise in the older man's eyes made it clear that he was just as surprised to see Draco as he was to see him. That did not mean that there was any good reason to believe that surprise was anything that would work in his favour. Forcing his eyes away from the Potions master, he cataloged the rest of the group. He hadn't been wrong when he'd guess that Moody would be among those who arrived. The last party, however, surprised a raised eyebrow out of him. "Nymphadora?" he asked, raising an incredulous eyebrow. Why in the bloody hell had they decided to let his ridiculously uncoordinated excuse of a cousin to tag along.
Soren looked thoughtful for a moment, before he chuckled softly. "Everything will become clear soon enough." He briefly wondered if he truly was the only one to put the pieces together. If they thought about it, he knew they'd see it, but when stress was high it was easy for the eyes and heart to be blinded. It wouldn't be long before that blindfold was pulled from their eyes.
Harry's irritation spiked at that. He knew that the order likely came from Rosalind, herself, but he was fine. He felt fine. More importantly, he needed to make sure that Draco was alright. He had no recollection of the other man's wounds being healed. His mouth opened to indignantly exclaim as much, but the sudden sound of growling caused him to freeze. For the briefest moment, Harry thought the sound was coming from him. Turning their heads toward the sound, they were surprised to find Draco's eyes open and the sound reverberating through his chest. From his position, Harry was almost certain the pale grey of Draco's iris' were softly glowing, but he could not be certain.
As Lothair turned to leave his eyes fell upon Harry, a hard edge to their gaze before they once again showed nothing of his emotional state. It was quite clear that despite the role Harry had agreed to play, Lothair did not think him capable of handling such responsibilities. Even knowing that Lothair's fears were not completely unfounded, Harry certainly didn't like to be thought of as incompetent. Had Lothair wanted to prevent him from ruling, he was certainly going about it in the wrong manner. Being doubted so obviously only made Harry that much more determined to accomplish what Lothair that was impossible. However, in order to do that he had to be offered a little more information than he was currently being offered.
"I could," he commented, letting his eyes sweep the room before he moved to the next one. "But this will do."
Harry blinked, but nodded. "So," understanding slowly dawning on him, "My magic will have a harder time against Ice but will be strong against those who draw upon the element of Fire?"
"I've been busy," he replied, flatly. He had no intention of telling her anything, especially sitting at the Slytherin table where there were more than a handful of ears listening in.
"Harry shook his head. The name was not familiar to him. Neither Hermione nor Professor Binns –those two being the only ones prone to quoting educational tidbits in his presence – had ever mentioned that particular name.
The heel of Ron's ratty old trainer bouncing lightly against the cupboards on which he was sitting was the only sound in the kitchen of Grimmauld place for several long moments. "I don't like it," he finally responded. "He just disappears and then we get some random letter in the mail telling us to back off and everyone seems to be okay with that?"
The bored wave from Lothair confirmed her words and Draco raised an eyebrow, turning a curious glance toward the Elf lounging on the lower wall. An element? He knew a little about Elven magic but not enough to satisfy his curiosity. Magical strength was everything in the Wizarding world and he doubted it was any different in the Elven realm.
"Draco!" Harry called, the worry returning. When Draco didn't respond, Harry whirled around to face Soren as a tinge of red appeared in his eyes once again. "You said you'd help him!" The tone was accusatory, but there was also a good portion of warning in it as well. Harry's hold on himself was teetering dangerously on a ledge.
It was not a little thing to be offered the protection of the realm and Hendrik was hesitant to turn it down. "And the other conditions?"
," Soren insinuated, shooting Harry a pointed look, "are growing rather impatient. It's imperative that we handle the situation immediately."
Then there was that interaction with Gwynn in the kitchen. Harry could explain that even less than he could explain Draco actually seeking him out. Whenever the two of them happened to be in the same room things tended to end poorly, especially for him. Hell, the last time they'd been in the same room, Draco and beat him into a bloody puddle.
Throughout everything that had happened since the passing of the last Dark Prince, Soren had remained calm and collected. He believed that the Fates had a plan crafted for the Elves. When Roland had rebelled and vowed vengeance Soren had taken it in stride. When the Kingdom had questioned the High Lords authority to protect the realm, he had carefully and calmly helped to prove their capabilities. Now staring into the eyes of a scared and angry seventeen year old he could feel his anger rising.
When Harry glanced up, he found his eyes immediately locking with Dumbledore's and the hair on the back of his neck rose. He could feel the magic in the air, tingling over his skin as though warning him of impending danger. Dumbledore's eyes remained on Harry even as he responded to Lothair.
I do not own Harry Potter or anything related to the Harry Potter verse. The creation of this story was created solely for my own entertainment. No copyright infringements were intended and no monetary gain has been made.
He let those words wash over him for a moment before he shoved them away as he always did but, somehow, they didn't feel quite so distant anymore. He could feel them whispering at the edge of his awareness as though waiting for an opportunity to slip free from their confines. It didn't matter. It wasn't anything he hadn't heard before. It wasn't anything he couldn't accept. He'd be fine.
His thoughts drifted to the blonde again as Blaise went about preparing and adding the ingredients at the appropriate times, leaving Harry to continuously stir the potion as was instructed. They were definitely bonded, but he wondered if he had altered it during the blood transfusion. He'd done his best to focus on making the connection equal but he'd been so worried about Draco dying that perhaps it had shifted. Draco didn't seem to have the same sort of response to the bond as he did. Either that, or he was much better at hiding it than Harry was. Though, given the strength of some of the backlashes, he had a hard time believing that the blonde was capable of that.
"Honestly, Draco, I thought you would never show up," she complained, "Do you know how boring it's been around here without you? I had to keep giving those two something to do."
"Harry," she started, a familiar huff of irritation slipping past her lips as she slid her sword easily into the sheath stretched across her back. It was an uncommon place to rest, but one that Harry had come to appreciate. "What in the world is wrong with you? Even on a bad day you can usually hold on to your sword a little better then that!"
Glancing away from the wreckage, Harry blinked up at a furious Snape, goo dripping off him. He was pretty sure there were blue specks in the man's greasy hair and he just groaned, glancing back at the mess in front of him. "Thank you, sir."
Harry shook his head. "It's not that bad," he muttered, lifting a hand to pat down his head, even if he knew his hair didn't actually look the way she was seeing it.
Doing his best to ignore the continued silence of his surroundings, Draco pressed forward, his already weak body protesting painfully against the continued movement. As he steadily, if not slowly, moved forward, the sound of the water's movement grew louder. He still couldn't make out anything in the distance and that made him just a bit nervous. The water wasn't flowing. It was rushing. If he needed to cross, he might be in even more trouble.
"Quiet, Ron!" Harry hissed. There was a low hum reverberating through the corridor. "Can you not hear that?"
Glancing back up from his now straight fork, he raised an eyebrow. "If you knew that already then why are you insisting that we go with you to the library after dinner?"
There were several ways in which an individual could wake. One could wake as Hermione did, energetically to the sound of a trusty and punctual alarm. Then there was Ron, who only woke after being pushed, prodded, and threatened until he stumbled his way groggily to the loo. Harry, even before his change, had found himself comfortably located between the eager riser and the late sleeper. The only time he faced a discrepancy was when he was woken by the sharp pain and horror of being connected to Voldemort. Even then, waking from such a thing was a gradual experience.
Gwen watched the door close behind them, bewilderment lingering all over her face. When she glanced back to her food, she found most of the room looking at her as though expecting some sort of explanation for the abrupt departure. Flushing slightly, she just shrugged. "It's complicated?"
For the second time Draco found himself blinking in surprise. "What the hell is that supposed to mean?"
Lothair snorted, from his position beside Ilaria. "Are you sure we didn't get it wrong the first time?" he asked, raising an eyebrow, "This one seems more like Prince material."
"I understand that, Remus, but Elves are very hesitant about mingling in the Wizarding world and would not have made their presence known unless James had shown definite signs of coming into his heritage, which we know did not happen. It has often been the case that magical blood has skipped a generations, even going so far as to skip several. There could very well have been the blood of the Elves in the Potter line without James showing signs of that heritage," Dumbledore explained, his features never shifting and never giving away any emotion he didn't want seen. Internally, he was making plans and altering the ones he had already built. He had been sure he had combed through every piece of information on the Potter family, but he had not once found evidence of them being anything other than what was represented to the public. He had not anticipated this. Something needed to be done to set tings on the right path once again, otherwise, plans that had been set in motion years before would have no hope of bearing fruit.
"And what if I'm right?" Harry countered, his tone holding that icy chill. It sent a shiver through Draco and he was having a hard time focusing on anything other than this new shift in the room. The energy spiked before dropping again, so quickly Draco could have been convinced that he'd imagined it. Despite himself, he felt drawn to it as though fascinated. "Are you willing to draw his attention to these borders? A man willing to hack his souls into multiple pieces? What do you think he'd be willing to do to these lands? To its people?"
Sighing, he glanced at Gwynn who just motioned him forward. As far as she was concerned, they were his friends and he could deal with their hysterics. "They're all yours."
Beside him Zabini cleared his throat, making Harry realize he'd been gripping the edge of the table so hard the wood was starting to creak. Flushing, he released it in a hurry and offered a sheepish smile before quickly volunteering to go and grab the necessary ingredients for the potions.
"And what of Mr. Potter's loved ones?" he asked, regaining control of himself and returning that annoying twinkle back to his eyes. "Do they no longer deserve his attention? Shall the Weasley's be sacrificed to satisfy your claim to him?"
The only sound that greeted them as they left the shop was the snort of amusement serving as Daemeon's response.
"Ilaria. I was wondering when you would be arriving," Soren smiled, nodding his head in greeting. "I do hope we haven't kept you waiting long?"
"And yet, here you are," she commented dryly, "talking to me about someone you don't want to talk about."
On the other side of them, Draco was seething. He was torn between being angry that the green-eyed idiot was all over the hired help and being angry that he even cared who Potter was all over. In the end, he was just angry that the bloody bond was messing with his head. He had to keep reminding himself that he didn't feel anything but disdain for Potter... not exactly the truth, but it was what he was going to stick with. It was easier that way. He had more important things to focus on than being someone's bloody boyfriend, willingly or otherwise.
Harry was confused. Hopeful, definitely, but confused. What bond? What harm, for that matter? Harm to him? He didn't really care so long as he wasn't standing there and watching Draco die. He kept telling himself that he'd feel that way about anyone in Draco's position, but deep down a part of him questioned that. The need to save the blond was strong, stronger than anything he'd ever felt. Stronger even than his common sense. The tone of Rosalind's voice should have warned him of the dangers but all he could think about was that this was a chance he couldn't pass up.
When given the nod of approval, Rosalind moved forward. "You might feel a bit of a charge build up around you, dear," she instructed, her voice soothing as she spoke, "As Elves, we do things a little differently than in the Wizarding world. I'll be pulling on the natural flow of energy around us rather than using a wand. I personally think that you'll do quite well in that area. You have a very strong magical core." It was clear from what she'd seen so far that the youth sitting in front of her was a very proud being. It seemed to pour from his skin and after the less than successful interaction with Harry, she had appealed to that side of his personality with ease, gradually starting the process of enlightening him to his surroundings.
"I think I like you," Kolvar smiled brightly, and rested his elbows back on the table, chin propped up as he watched Harry. "The Dragon's will be amused. We shall support your venture."
There was a spark of nervous energy within him as he moved to do what he was told, rolling up the sleeve on his right arm. This was it. If he was going to back out then now was the time to do it. There would be no turning back once the ritual had begun. Knowing this, however, Harry still moved to lay down on the bed. Whatever it was guiding his actions held positive that this was the right course of action. As his head hit the pillow, he desperately hoped that it was.
Harry. In the past Harry had experienced a similar sense of foreboding with his visions, but this had been entirely different. He hadn't seen any images flash before his eyes. He hadn't been trapped in a nightmare, watching the scenes unfold. He'd felt it. He'd felt everything Draco had been feeling; the pain, the desperation, the fear. It had fed Harry's own emotions until nothing else could penetrate the haze. He hadn't known who needed his help then, but he'd been desperate to make it in time.
Harry sat there in silence, his eyes moving to take in the wolves sitting across from him. He'd told Soren and the other High Lords that he'd accept his role in the realm and fulfill what he was meant to do but he felt lost. How was he suppose to handle this situation? Hell, he didn't even fully understand what was happening with Draco. All of this had seemed straightforward in the beginning but now ... now it was a mess. Feeling more than a little useless, Harry leaned forward to rest his head against the cool surface of the table, blocking out the sound of everyone around him as he tried to sort out his thoughts. He'd originally wanted retribution, but what good was retribution now. They couldn't separate the lyncanthropy cells from Draco's blood. That was something they couldn't change. The repercussions of this was unknown to any of them. They were all in the same boat. No one knew what was going to happen now. On top of that, they still faced a threat from Roland. Now that Draco was a part of the realm, he too faced that same threat.
"We have more important things to worry about than the living arrangements of a single wizard," Lothair scoffed, using a lazy gesture to wave off Harry's concern. .
If Harry hadn't regretted speaking to Soren the way he had, he certainly did now. The sound of his body hitting the floor had become a rather familiar sound over the past two weeks. Rather then continue with the lessons on political history and internal relations, Soren had given Ilaria free reign of his study schedule. At first, Harry had simply been glad Soren had not handed him over to Lothair, but he quickly came to the conclusion that he might have been better off with the surly and sarcastic Elf. There was a reason that Ilaria was head of the Realms Military defense and she's taken great delight in showing Harry that particular reason.
Never before had Harry felt the kind of exasperated anger that coursed through him at that moment. "Destiny?" He asked, unable to contain the word of the venom that came with it. Soren, for once, could honestly say he was surprised by the sound. "That's the only answer you have? Destiny? Fate? It doesn't exist! I want a better answer than that! You just figure you can brush off the question with some bullock answer and I'll do exactly what you want, is that it?"
"Those of us born in the Wizarding World," his tone was haughty and Harry instantly took it as a slight against himself, "were raised with tales of most magical creatures; Elves, Fae, Werewolves, Banshees, all of them. It's a surprisingly a popular interest among Purebloods."
"Get him into the kitchen," Lothair ordered, moving aside so Draco could pass him. Only moments later, Gwynn appeared, leading a group of six students behind her, Akkar following up behind them. "Report."
Harry turned to argue but stopped, gapping in surprise. The entire space had changed. The corridor of snakeheads was gone, replaced with proper walls and proper lights. The open cavern had changed as well. It looked like they were in any other part of the castle. At the center of where the cavern had been was an open space that could quite easily be used for training and another for a common area. Along the walls were a series of doors that led to what Harry could only guess at. It reminded him of the dungeons, though the lighting brightened it up more than Harry would have expected.
"Now," Mrs. Malfoy says, after taking a delicate sip of her tea, "why don't you start at the beginning and tell us why exactly you're here, Mr. Potter."
Potter waited, staring at the door until the wards rippled, and then he turned back to Draco and waved his hand, dispelling the charm. Before Draco could open his mouth to speak, Potter was in his face.
It's like someone's banging a gong right in Harry's brain. Narcissa Malfoy has all but outed her son over pudding. Even better, she sounds
Tonight will determine if Draco can obey enough, trust enough, to earn Harry's touch. Harry wants to give it to him, Merlin's fucking beard, he wants it, possibly even more than Draco. But he possesses enough self-control to keep from giving in. The waiting has a purpose, like everything else. Harry's learned that anything freely given has a tendency to lose its value over time, and that's the last thing Harry wants. What's about to happen between them has an importance that Harry can't possibly put a price on. If Draco wants it, he has to earn it, so that he may know the value of obedience and the depth of Harry's esteem.
Harry kisses him, soft and sweet at first, but with more passion as Draco opens for him. The first taste of Draco's tongue is heady, and he gets a little moan for his effort.
Potter turned away from him, shaking his head and his fists, hissing to himself. "I knew this would happen. I fucking
Draco’s hand curled into the soft strands of hair at Harry’s nape, chuckling. “No offense, Potter, but I think someone’s beat me to it.” Harry’s laugh rumbled against his skin, and damn if it didn’t feel good.
Draco followed her movement, turning his own moue of displeasure on the vampire. “And why the hell not?” True, the thought of being surrounded by Weasleys had once been unthinkable, but given the situation, it might be in his best interest to play nice. And the fact that Potter was so adamant about not going only increased Draco’s desire to do so.
Narcissa Malfoy looks absolutely gob smacked. It's an interesting expression on her regal face. One that quite doesn't belong. Her voice quavers as she speaks. "Sanct—you called for 'sanctuary' specifically?"
A/N: Thanks for your patience. Sorry I haven't posted, as there's been a family summer vacation and a real-life job that's taken my time. If you've stayed around this long, I thank you. And all comments and reviews are not only welcomed, but encouraged. *hint hint* Hopefully, I shall be publishing more to this story soon. I just hope you all still want to read it!
“Thank you.” If he felt at all odd about thanking a house-elf, it didn’t register, and he waved the thought away as he ascended the stairs, choosing instead to focus on a hot shower and a bed that waited. As he passed down the hallway, he noticed the absence of lamplight coming from beneath Potter’s door. He briefly entertained the notion of nudging open the door to see if Potter slept in a coffin or some such rot, but thought better of it.
Something suddenly occurs to Harry, and his arms fall to his sides. "She doesn't know you're here, does she?"
Draco’s hand slowed, drawing out Potter’s orgasm, teasing him through the aftershocks. Potter twitched with a groan and rolled to the side, dislodging Draco’s hand. Heavy breathing filled the silence of the room, and Draco felt his skin prickle with the familiar tingle of a Scourgify, even though Potter hadn’t said a word.
Harry digs in his heels. "No," he growls, "you're not orchestrating this time. I'm not chasing him. If you want to interfere so badly, then you go work your magic on Draco. It's his eyes that need to be opened, not mine."
He was the almighty kid who caused Voldemort’s fall, the Gryffindor who went against every rule in order to help, the bravest teenager of their generation who was looked at as a hero, the savior of the Wizarding World.
He wasn’t much of a thinker, really, he usually left that to Hermione, but he felt he needed to do this on his own. He came up with an idea. A batty, mental idea, but an idea nonetheless.
Though the action wasn’t anything out of the ordinary, the students were just too thirsty for gossip to look away.
Even as his cheeks flushed, Draco was quick to counter him. “So what? Instead I make everyone believe I’m gay?”
He hated it; he hated being in danger all over again, he hated that this tournament had cost him Ron’s friendship, he hated that the Yule Ball was mere days away, he hated that girls were after him all the time when he wasn’t interested at all, and he hated being seen as a rebellious teenager when all he wanted to do was lay low for at least one year. But nope, no can do.
So both boys walked into the hall with their respective group of friends, not sparing a glance at each other so nothing would be spoiled.
Gwynn eyed him suspiciously for several long moments, before she finally nodded and let the topic slip by. "Well, if you're alright then let's start on our archery. The Mother knows you need it and we have plenty of good light left before dinner."
Nodding, he turned his attention back to the two ahead of them. Ilaria had fed her magic into her lance, flame engulfing the length of it as she gracefully twisted it around, coming dangerously close to hitting Lothair's unprotected skin. Lothair, however, had not shown an ounce of his element. As Harry watched, he began to feel the energy in the room. It had been gradually building without them initially noticing.
"I'd prefer if the boys stayed," Dumbledore interrupted, "There is more that I would like to discuss with them."
"I'm rather disappointed in you, Draco," Lucius responded, idly playing with the tip of the dagger he held in his hands, several masked individuals lined behind him. "All this time I've been allowing your transgressions. A filthy Mudblood outscores you. Potter out flies you. A bloody Weasley outsmarts you. All of this, I've not punished you severely for simply because you would ultimately be taking our Lord's mark and serve him as only a Malfoy could."
Shaking the thought away, he moved to the pool and quickly splashed some water onto his face. He hadn't bothered to warm it up, needing the cool quality of it to wake his senses and hopefully push his dreams far from his thoughts. It seemed to help after a minute, a light shiver moving through him as some of the cool water splashed against his chest. Standing again, he reached for one of the towels lining the shelf and dried himself off. Hanging it up, he returned to the room to dress. He hadn't attended to his own wardrobe, most of the items having simply shown up in his closest with no clue as to where they'd come from. Much to his surprise, they all seemed perfectly tailored to him so he didn't bother to complain. He had no belongings and no means to acquire more, so if they were going to supply him with what he needed than he was going to accept it. It helped that all of the clothing he'd found was of high quality. He'd have walked around naked before wearing some of the garbage he'd seen Potter wearing over the years. He might not have a title or wealth anymore, but he still had more pride than that.
"Of course, whenever you can return is fine. Our doors are always open to you, Neville." She holds out her hand in a formal gesture of goodbye.
Their silence and disapproval is palpable, and to be honest, he is far more than a little tired of it.
Harry leans in and makes one more swipe across the canvas with the brush, satisfied at last. He puts the palette and brush down and gently eases the painting off the easel to place it with the others on the drying table at the other end of the room. He's got a few more in mind before the gallery opens next month. Between what he's already completed and Luna's hoard of finished sculptures, it should make for a fine opening show. He's been contacted by several artists already, and thinks one or two of them would be a good fit alongside their work. It certainly looks promising.
Ron flips two fingers at him. "You know, I thought you'd be a lot more helpful. I see that Malfoy's charm is contagious around here."
"You wanted it all. Take it," Potter growled, slamming into him over and over. "Take it all. Take my cock."
"And you should know by now that I can take care of myself. My letter was specific on the point that
Harry glances down, realizing that Blinky has, in fact, put him at the head of the table. Where the patriarch sits. Where Lucius Malfoy would be sitting if he were still alive. This can't be right. He expects the mistake to be rectified at once. Maybe the house will oust him from the chair. Maybe the specter of an angry Lucius Malfoy will make his presence known and wreak havoc until Harry gets his arse out of the chair. But nothing like that happens.
Malfoy pops upright in his chair. "Telling? What's so telling about Potter here popping into places he doesn't belong? Merlin knows he's done enough of that for a lifetime. He probably pops round to places all the time. It's Monday? How about the Ministry fountains? Thursday? Isn't Wales horrible this time of year? Easter Sunday? Why don't I just come back from the dead like Jesus bloody Christ?"
Harry had warned Silvestri. Made his thoughts perfectly clear on the subject. But Silvestri just had to push. This time too far. Silvestri knew how he felt, and had crossed the line anyway. One thought filled Harry's mind as he Apparated.
"May be he's just wanting to make a fashionable entrance. You know how dramatic he is," Harry scoffed.
Harry imagines those long lashes fluttering so sweetly, slowly opening to pin him down with those piercing gray eyes. He imagines a hand, long-fingered and adept, one that knows how to touch, to please, reaching out in question.
“I mean, does the thought of fucking a woman turn you on? All that creamy skin, soft curves, and say, a pair of tits made to fit in the palm of your hand?” He waved his finger in a circular motion at Potter’s crotch. “Lighting any fires?”
With all the bodies milling in and out of the gallery, Harry's fairly certain they're violating some sort of Ministry fire code. But with the Ministry's top brass lounging about swilling champagne like it's going out of style, he's pretty sure a fine won't be forthcoming.
"It's all right," Harry says smoothly, hoping to deflect some of Malfoy's discomfort. "I'll give him fair warning before I take anything." He shrugs with amused self-deprecation. "Can't help it," he grins. "Gryffindor."
Draco felt Potter stiffen, but he managed a smile for Molly. “No, thank you, Molly. I’m rather enjoying the company.”
"No," he bit out, "it wasn't discussed." His eyes flicked to Potter's name next to Snape's. "At least not with me."
"Not yet," he says firmly. He's pleased to see Draco's hands fall to his sides and slide around to the small of his back. He doesn't need to look to know they're clasped together properly. The blood rushes to his cock and Harry takes a step back to gather his faculties.
"I know you want me." The statement is gritted out through Draco's clenched teeth like it pains him to put voice to it. "Do you deny it? That you want to get me into your bed?"
"Okay, then. See you later." Harry opens the door to his room and steps inside, when Malfoy lets out a low, deep breath. It sounds like another sigh, but one of frustration instead of weariness.
"No," Malfoy says, shaking his head with force. The tone of his voice is sharper, higher, and definitely defensive. It's skating very close to the edge of fear as he continues, "No. I mean why are you staying? Why would you want to?"
It's scary how perceptive Ron really is. It's what makes him so good at his job, Harry thinks. He doesn't have to expound on it, but he doesn't have to deny it, either.
"I can—here, I'll move. I didn't even realize—" Harry's words trail as he moves to rise, but now there's a twinge of magic not just over the chair, but the entire table. It's weighing him down, and he can't get up. His legs feel bolted to the floor, and his arse feels like it's become permanently attached to the velvet cushion underneath it. The Manor doesn't want him to move. It doesn't want to let him go.
Now he's thinking about it. Imagining it. Fantasizing about what exactly Potter might do, because if he's shown Draco anything at all since he's been here, it's that Potter is nothing like he imagined. It's overwhelming now, this physical reaction, and Draco sinks to his knees, slips his hand in his trousers, and pulls one off right there on the goddamned rug.
The terse command startles Draco into attention. "Wh-what?" His voice falters a touch and Harry has to stop himself from smirking.
She extends a graceful hand. "I should have done this long ago, but—" she shrugs, "I was still an idiot then." Her eyes are clear and focused and she meets his gaze head on without trepidation. "I'm sorry. For my part in the past. I know it's no excuse, but I was a child. A small, scared, idiot child. I hope that you can find it in your heart to forgive me." She pauses for a breath. "If only for Draco's sake. I'm going to be Britain-based for a while, which means I hope to see more of Draco. And I get the feeling that means I'm going to be seeing more of you as well. I would hate for my presence to cause difficulty between the two of you." Her dark eyes flash, and for a second Harry sees the Slytherin resurface. "Because I'm not giving him up, and I don't think he'll do the same."
There was a brief pause as they locked eyes, Draco’s wrist stuffed into Potter’s mouth, and for a second, he thought Potter was going to kill him. The danger in Potter’s eyes never dissipated, even as his fangs sunk deep into Draco’s flesh.
“How can you say that?” Harry hissed. “Because I would have, you know?” He glared at Ron, desperately wanting him to see the thing within so that he could understand. “I would have killed you.”
The plates on the tea cart rattle with a surge of Harry's irritated magic as Malfoy's mother snaps, "Draco! That was uncalled for!"
As per usual, the Cannons lost, but put up a valiant effort. When Draco asked him why he hadn't asked Potter to come, Ron had shrugged in that casual way of his and replied, "I've asked. He won't come. I've asked. He snarled. I've stopped asking. It's a thing." Either way, it hadn't seemed to affect Ron, and Potter hadn't seemed put out that Draco went. And if anyone had ever told Draco he would have a good time at the hands of Ron Weasley, he would have hexed them into oblivion and then punched them in the face for good measure (bad pun notwithstanding). Another shining example of a mediocre existence made good by the company of a friend.
Harry can only imagine what Malfoy's tweaked about now, but given the past few hours of his company, and knowing him like he does, Harry thinks there's really no telling.
“I have five years left on my sentence. After that I’m free and clear. Why should I bargain with that and gamble that Potter won’t eat me in my sleep?”
Draco closed his eyes and turned his face into the pillow, trying to squelch down the sting he shouldn’t feel from words he wanted to believe. But deep down, he knew it was futile.
In that moment, Harry feels something slide into place within his heart. He can almost hear the click in his brain. Magic tingles on the surface of his skin, the same sort of feeling he got when he Apparated in. It's warm and settling, and he feels a bit heavier, like his feet are rooted to the floor. It's the Manor.
Potter cocked his head to the side, like the thought had just occurred to him. "I know." The hand over Silvestri's heart shot out to the side, toward Draco, and Draco's wand flew from his shirt sleeve to Potter's reaching grasp like a master calling forth his disciple. Potter regarded the wand in his hand for a moment, before flipping it end over end.
Harry catches Draco's gaze and holds it. "You're as worthy a man as I've ever met. You've shown that much. And there is no weakness in submission, Draco."
Harry sucks in a breath at the thought. "Then you don't know me as well as you think you do. Neither does the
Draco scrambled back, barely aware of the slide of cool sheets against his skin. The heat that had begun bubbling away in his blood had him too hot, too feverish to be mitigated by the chill of soft cotton. He scooted back toward the wall, stopping when he felt the edge of the four-poster near his back.
Harry ties the promised letter for Ron and Hermione to Pennywort's outstretched leg, pulling his fingers back in time to avoid being bitten—again. She's an adorable, spotted little thing with an unfortunate tendency to nip if the stroking isn't hard enough to her liking. A tad on the puffy side, she's squat with big moon eyes that look up at Harry with equal parts adoration and irritation. She's sweet enough, if a bit beaky, but she's a Malfoy owl, and Harry supposes that makes her high-maintenance on general principle. He looks into her eyes and purposefully doesn't think about Hedwig. He can never replace her, not ever, but he does think it's possibly time to consider her successor.
“Well, how about I talk to you about Draco, then?” she continued, not missing a beat. Her voice lowered and she hissed, “You should be ashamed of yourself, Harry Potter.”
Granger’s eyes turned soft, and he looked away, afraid to see her pity reflected there. When she spoke, it was calm and empathetic, and his head turned on its own volition. No pity, just sadness. “You can help each other. Please, Malfoy. You’re the only one who can help him.”
—raise your hand in anger on a partner again, your magic will turn and visit upon you your intentions a hundredfold. The consequences of which could be quite nasty, or given your predilections—deadly, even. Wouldn't that be a shame?"
Draco tilted his head back and stared at the ceiling, mouth open on a small breath. "I can't do this anymore." He closed his eyes for a long second, steeling his nerves. "I—I have to go."
"I was thinking of spending some time in the library this evening." Harry places his napkin on the table, he lets out a groan of contentment. "My luck I'll probably fall asleep in there. I ate far too much. Please forward my appreciation to Cook."
Potter groaned and the kiss quickly turned heated, and Draco found himself being unceremoniously pressed down into the sofa cushions. Draco pushed at Potter, turning his head to the side, breaking the kiss. "As much as I would love to continue," he gasped, "I think you should take me home and shag me properly, in a bed, as I have no intention of being buggered on Weasley upholstery."
When Harry wakes in the morning, his eyes instinctively shoot to the four-poster, already wanting to see if the reality measures up to previous vision given to him by the Manor. Harry gets up and strides to the bed. His gaze rakes over the tangle of blue sheets, and his mouth purses tightly. Because the bed is empty, the sheets are cold, and Draco has committed his first transgression.
