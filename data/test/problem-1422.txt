Harry gave a laugh and a nod in response to the blonde’s question and they entered the restaurant. Unsurprisingly, Draco had him laughing through the whole meal. He told Harry stories about life in Slytherin, that had him wiping tears from the corners of his eyes he’d laughed so hard.
Harry could feel Ron give an eyeroll from beside him, “Harry can’t your bond like sense him or something? Shouldn’t you know where he is?”
“Oh, good Potter, you can still read,” Malfoy says with a roll of his eyes. “Look, if you don’t want it, I’m sure…” he begins, looking hesitant and a little dejected.
Desperately Harry turned to Nearly Headless Nick in the hopes that maybe Sirius wasn’t altogether gone, maybe he would still be able to turn to his Godfather even if he wasn’t flesh and blood. Alas, the Gryffindor ghost trounced over his last ounce of hope that maybe all wasn’t lost. The round of defeat delivered by the ghost restarted his mourning process, and he felt that most days he was walking through the castle in a haze. He was more grateful than ever for Ron and Hermione; without them he didn’t think he’d even make it to classes at all. After they’d gotten out of the hospital wing it had been their mission to get him through the remainder of the term and honestly, he was appreciative.  He felt his feelings shift from the start of the term where he was uncontrollably angry at his two best friends for shutting him out when he felt that he needed them most. But looking back on it all now it felt petty and childish, how had he let himself be overcome with feelings of jealousy and anger at the two people who seemed to always support him no matter what it cost them.
Waking up on Sunday morning while Harry was still curled against him, leg wrapped around his calf,
“Honestly, Harry I think you’re the only one that pays him any mind at all,” Hermione said with a knowing look. Harry’d been less keen to bring it up after that. Not wanting to draw attention to his old habit however accepting of himself he’d become.
Harry ran his fingers down the soft contours of Draco’s cheek resting his palm against his chest. Draco knew there was no way to hide the wild beating of his heart, Harry could surely feel beneath his fingertips. “Please know, that this has always been about how I feel about me, and never had anything to do with my feelings for you. I love you Draco, very much, it makes me mad actually.” Harry’s lips quirked into a half-smile and Draco could do nothing but relate to how mad loving Harry had made him.
“That is curious isn’t it?” Granger replied brow furrowing as she met Draco’s gaze.
. He was lulled back to reality as his thoughts trailed over to how soft he found the other boy’s skin; it was one of his favorite physical things about the other boy. He woke up in the morning often coiled around all the soft skin, favoring to assume sleep to stay enveloped in the warmth for as long as possible.
He ran his hand over his face and through his hair, quite like Harry did when he was feeling anxious or exasperated Draco mused. He sheepishly glanced back up at her and was pleased to see that the semblance of a smile had turned into a real one. It surged him ahead.
“It’s clear I’m no good at staying away from you Draco, I hardly think I’ll be any better once we’re at school, especially if this morning was anything to go on…I don’t know…I know we’ve not talked about it, about telling people, being open…I…”
Funny, Harry thought to himself, funny that Draco’s clothes had never ended up mixed in with the articles Draco so neatly folded and left in his dresser.
Draco found that beyond being completely daft in the ways of 'housekeeping' he didn't much mind being the Dursley's slave for the summer, especially, since he was being forced to endure it next to Harry who seemed to find a small joy in explaining to Draco how to wash dishes. It was how Harry's aunt and uncle treated him that turned his insides to stone and filled him with a quiet rage. He couldn't understand how someone's own family could treat them like absolute garbage. He knew his own relationship with his parents was no picnic, but at least he hadn't been reduced too servitude.
Even though Draco knew all of this, even though he knew it would be difficult, he also knew that there was no one else. This was the same boy he’d loved with a vengeance since he was eleven, before he’d even known what love really was. This was the boy that invaded his dreams in all the best and worst ways. This was the boy who he’d been pining after however angrily for all these years too afraid to admit to himself what it really was that he was feeling, and who he was.
“Oh, really? Is that all it takes to keep you happy then, oh chosen one?”
Harry began to feel the traces of panic outline him when he couldn’t get Draco to meet his eyes. The other boy came and perched himself of the edge of the sofa, thankfully, nearest Harry and finally looked up at him. His eyes appeared sad, and so the traces of panic got bolder and Harry knew he couldn’t keep it hidden from his face. Mercifully, Draco graced him with a signature soft half-lipped smile and slid down between the arm of the sofa and Harry into his normal spot, the spot Harry had left open the last four nights. Draco’s blonde hair slid into his eyes as he peered down into his lap, clutching what Harry now realized was a book. Draco peered back up at Harry timorously, sliding the book that was in his lap into Harry’s hands. Harry looked up at him curiously, a question in his gaze. Draco opened his mouth as if to answer Harry’s unspoken question but abruptly closed it again.
Hermione, I…I’m very fond of him, of Draco. He’s been able to give me something this summer that I don’t think I’ve ever truly experienced. You and Ron, are amazing you are my best mates, the best friends I’ve ever had. But with Draco it just feels different, like I don’t have to pretend I don’t have to hide because he already knows what it’s like to feel the way I do. He’s so bloody brilliant and funny and careful, I just, at first, I was fully content to tell myself it was the bond making me feel this way, because there was no way I could fancy not only my worst enemy, but also another bloke. Right?
The one saving grace he felt he had was the fact that he and Harry were indeed still bonded together, therefore, he wouldn’t ever be too far away if Draco needed him.
Harry pulled back and took in Draco’s pink cheeks and full lips. He took Draco’s hand in his and without thinking started walking them through the house and stealthily (hopefully) pulled them out into the back yard.
Since getting caught up in their tunnel, fleeing blinded hatred and inundations of rain Draco mused that he and Harry hadn’t really spoken about the change in their relationship. He could feel the other boy’s warmth blanketing his skin pressed up against him lost in sleep, body twisted around him like a vine, not that Draco minded one bit. He found himself lost in these thoughts early in the morning, when Harry was still lost to the world and not taking up all the space in his mind yet, at least the awake Harry wasn’t.
Draco sighed before continuing, knowing this next bit was likely the bit to make Harry upset. “Mostly, because I was afraid of how it would make you feel to know that I knew all along why we had to suffer through being bonded together all summer and didn’t tell you.”
Harry let out an audible groan, running his hand through his hair, and then mentally slapped himself for being so stupid. His eyes darted back to Malfoy who was now peering up at him sleepily with those piercing gray eyes, the ones that held all the answers to his burning questions and teased him in the dreams that kept the terrors idle. Harry took a moment to notice that he had left the hand that he’d run through his hair in midair as he’d stopped to assess the blonde beside him. Harry looked over at his hand, and back at Malfoy before laughing softly and bringing his hand down to rest across his chest leaning up on his elbow to fully face the other boy who was looking at him with a dopey half-smile.
Instead he rationalized that Draco was entitled to borrow his clothes whenever he wanted as he was the one who was often tossing them in the wash. Why he did it, Harry might never know. Although, Draco’s own wardrobe consisted of more stiff and proper clothing. Nothing comfortable like the t-shirts and joggers Draco often stole from him. Harry also rationalized that when Draco did his wash for him his clothes often came back smelling like him which was just another happy little bonus to having clean clothes and watching Draco flounce about their flat in one of Harry’s hoodies.
Draco felt a little reassured by the sheer reality that there was strength in the volume of Weasley’s that were in on their secret, and also by the fact that Harry didn’t appear to be bothered in the least at being outed. In fact, he seemed relieved by the whole thing which was utterly charming and annoying all at once. Draco desperately craved to be let in on the sense of relief as well.
Draco began sucking Harry’s cock in earnest, surged on by the sounds escaping the brunette’s throat. Draco was so achingly hard from the whole thing, Harry’s noises, sucking his cock, all Harry’s exposed skin, Draco was on sensory overload and it had absolutely nothing to do with the bond and everything to do with Harry.
Before Draco could calculate his next actions, Harry was tugging on his wrist doing his best to pull him up and into his bed.
“Happy Birthday Harry,” Draco said softly. He couldn’t help but be overcome with nerves in the moment. He was absolutely positive that this wasn’t the most amazing birthday gift the great Harry Potter had ever received, but it had been incredibly heartfelt on his part making his nerves lurch into overdrive as Harry reached out and tentatively took the box from Draco’s outstretched hand.
Harry mused that the ache was dull and ran a hand through his already messy hair and took a deep breath trying to distract himself as he adjusted to the discomfort.
“Nothing really,” he almost whispered donning a coy smile as he peered up into green eyes. “Just thinking about this burrow we’re going to be living in for the next week.” He graced Harry with a full smile as the brunette let out a laugh placing a hand snuggly on Draco’s jean clad thigh.
With one last knowing look between them, and chaste kiss to Draco’s hand they braced themselves. Harry knew that Draco was far more nervous than he was. Of course, he was none too thrilled at the thought of leaving the space that he and Draco had turned into something incredible over the last few weeks. But he was also greatly looking forward to being reunited with his friends and family again.
He’d mused before that being at the Weasley’s was a lot like being at Hogwarts, there were always people huddled in various rooms playing games, chatting, snacking, arguing…there was truly never a dull moment. The comparison made it a little bit easier for Draco to lean on his snarky sarcasm; there was no need for anyone here to know just how soft Harry’d made him, was there?
If it is your thing, Happy birthday!!! Lol :) <3
He absentmindedly reasoned with himself that the fact that he was only experiencing a dull ache meant that Harry hadn’t really gone that far, which was comforting. He knew he was in deep, too deep maybe. He was frustrated with himself; he could tell Harry James Potter that he was in love with him, and waltz around Surrey hand in hand like nothing else mattered but he couldn’t face his parents.
Not one for letter writing, her absence had not been felt that summer. Though even if either of them had desired to write, it’s not as if Pansy would have known where to send the owl. Of course, she knew, she’d been to visit him in the hospital wing the morning they were set to board the Hogwarts express; not daring to be seen speaking with him by anyone important.
“Hey, queers!” Dudley yelled, laughing and nudging the other two boys as they laughed along beside him. Draco and Harry remained silent, but Draco could feel the anger and hatred Potter felt for his cousin coming off him in waves from beside him.
Draco noticed that as he spoke, Potter gave him his full attention, hands steady in place on his hips, it gave him a little confidence that perhaps, even though it seemed Potter had no intention of talking about what had transpired between them, that he didn’t seem to be angry about it.
He felt it was fair, why should she speak first, and what could she have said honestly? Draco took a deep breath and plunged forward as he always seemed to do whenever Harry was involved.
Harry had barely been engaged in his latest Malfoy escape, not since he
“No, I think he’s definitely cross with Harry, and honestly, probably even more cross with me. I’m sure I’m the one he blames for the entire thing, at least that’s what was made clear to me before he stormed out this morning.”
Draco watched as Harry cast his gaze downwards his lips devoid of the half smile Draco had become so fond of. He took a step back towards the dejected looking boy, “No, it’s not…” Draco let out a sigh and ran a hand through his hair before reaching out to take Harry’s hands in his own. “It’s just, I just,” he closed his eyes and took a solid deep breath. He opened his eyes and looked directly into Harry’s before continuing, “It’s for me, it’s not because of you. It’s just, well, I know I’m mad for you Harry,” he said with a timid half smile, his eyes never leaving Harry’s. “I just don’t know what that means, and I know I need to.”
Draco knew deep down that no matter his fears, he needed to be honest with Harry if there was any chance for what they had to stay above water after the summer ended. He also knew that for his own sanity, he needed Harry to know how he felt no matter what happened; who knew what they were returning to.
Of course, Draco had agonized over it in every spare moment he’d had from then on. In truth, he had no real idea how the other boy felt about him in return. Sure, Harry was affectionate, he wasn’t shy about touching Draco innocently, or brazenly. He also wasn’t shy about opening up to Draco, not anymore, but what did it mean? It was driving Draco absolutely mad, and to top it all off Harry’s birthday was tomorrow.
“I’m sure. I’ve never seen Harry quite so happy, and with what we all have ahead of us I think he needs to be allowed that happiness right now.”
Draco was yanked from his inner musings, however, when Potter’s very red faced uncle dragged the brunette into the kitchen by the collar of his shirt and dropped him into one of the kitchen chairs, faced opposite his very obese cousin Dudley, who had a smirk so solid in place it could almost pass for one of a Malfoy.
“I’m sorry. You and I both know I’ve been a right twat to you since first year, and it only worsened over time. I could give you a list much longer than you’d care to read of all the reasons why I acted the way I did or said the awful things I said but it doesn’t make it right.”
He was grateful that Harry was helping to make things easier on him. He never let Draco drift too far behind the group whether in breakfast conversation, a game of exploding snap, or their afternoon of quidditch. Harry was also dedicated to finding new and inventive ways to touch Draco, inconspicuously, of course.
“I…um…let me…let me explain. The charm, the dragon there at the end, I’ve…he’s been charmed to mimic our bond.”
“Are you alright?”
Draco knew he was wound pretty tightly; he knew that he had spent most of the term wishing to be invisible and calculating most of his moves with his past in mind. But with Harry, in this moment he knew he wasn’t thinking. With Harry he could just let go, and feel, and be alive, and
He thought deeply for a moment at his own implication in this scenario he’d constructed, he knew Albus would be surprised, maybe even slightly annoyed with him but he could not see any catastrophic outrage over Severus’s decision. He knew with time Draco would forgive him, and maybe even learn to understand why he had to do it and he was honestly least concerned with the slight nuisance this would be to him and to Potter. Ultimately, he needed to consider how this might affect his relationship with the Dark Lord. He needed to devise a scenario that would not implicate him in the extraction of Draco. He knew that if he was suspected in the disappearance of the boy the Dark Lord would be ruthless, and he knew the role he played was one of importance. If the Order was to prevail, he would be needed, and with this new narrative he knew he would in turn have to make a large sacrifice to Voldemort to deepen his trust in the spy.
“Yes, its Malfoy, I think that’s been established Ron.”
“Well, it’s what you get for leaving your clothes strewn about the house. Sometimes your clothes mix with mine, and I get them mixed up.”
“Just know, I’m your friend just as much as Harry’s and if you need anything at school, well, you can talk to me.” She reached her hand out across the table, and instinctively without thinking Draco reached back. He felt Hermione squeeze his hand from across the table, and couldn’t help but exhale slowly and squeeze back, a gentle smile peeking through the corners of his lips, as he thanked her softly.
Draco’s heart leapt. He couldn’t even stop the dopey grin that crept onto his face at Harry’s admission.
Harry let out a laugh and nestled his way back into the crook of Draco’s neck, leaving lazy open-mouthed kisses in his wake.
“They pulled me aside because it was Severus who bonded us together Harry.” He searched Harry’s face for any sign of emotion, but the brunette let on only that he was intently listening, so he continued. “Severus bonded us because he was fearful for me. He knew that Voldemort intended me to take the dark mark when I returned home this summer, and he knew I wasn’t ready. He did it to protect me.”
,” Draco breathed out after a moment of silence squeezing his eyes closed at the intensity of it all. “I know this isn’t my finest hour, but you’re going to make me come if we keep this up Harry,” Draco said opening his eyes back up to gaze down at wonder boy.
Harry lifted his head to rest it against Draco’s, their movements were much more frantic now, and Draco ran his hands up the brunette’s slick back leaving one splayed on his spine, and the other to sift through his matted brown locks.
It had definitely been a lot for everyone to take in, but he had been easily accepted by the twins after a long game of Quidditch that had extended to just before lunch. He still hadn’t managed to make any headway with Ron, he had become prolific in avoiding him and any conversation he was involved in. Something that was truly remarkable as up until this point the one thing Draco had found Ron to be skilled in was seizing any, and every opportunity to make Draco the arse of the joke. Even if Ron had never been particularly practiced in the art of insults.
Draco watched Harry turn towards Granger, “that’s really the idea ‘Mione” he replied with a dumb smile plastered across his face.
“Watching me sleep stalker?”
Draco watched with an amused look on his face as Mrs. Weasley chastised everyone for their table manners whilst also making sure that everyone had enough food on their plate. His time spent assisting her in the kitchen was charming. She was incredibly kind, possibly one of the kindest people he’d ever met next to Harry.
Harry opened his mouth only to promptly shut it again.
Draco mirrored Harry’s goofy grin, “Oh yes, the chosen one will be spending most of his time figuring out how to look after the wizarding world, but who is going to look after him?”
“No, and it’s been maddening to say the least, I have no idea what I’m walking into. I don’t even know if Severus will be at school, or even speak with me if he is.”
“Of course I did Harry, You’re everything. And I’m…I’m…I’m an absolute wanker who doesn’t deserve you.”
Harry’s half-smile made it impossible to feel exasperated by the strange and intricate dynamic he shared with Weasley and Granger.
I know that I’ve been distant all summer. As always, you have been nothing but diligent in your letters to me which of course I’ve always appreciated. I’m sorry that I’ve been such an absent friend this summer. Well, at least even more absent than usual. The truth is, I haven’t really known what to say to you, or to Ron, or anyone really. I hope you can forgive me.
Draco sat up, pulling his legs up and crossing them on the bed, he leaned back propped up on his hands, and let out what was probably the fiftieth sigh that morning in a big huff. For the first time that summer he felt certain that he wanted to talk to his mother. He’d been content to live in a bubble with Harry the past month and a half, too caught up in the fact that Harry had seen him, not only had he seen him, but he’d found him worthy. He hadn’t wanted to do anything to pop that bubble, he wanted to avoid any shining light on the realities that faced them. Hell, the two boys had made a pact at the beginning of their summer to avoid realities and any sense of brooding until the summer ended, they’d not wanted to live in any adult decision making.
Draco quirks his eyebrow a little more before tilting his head to the side and responding, “Why would you deprive Granger of such a task Potter, I’m sure she would be more than willing to list about 100 books that might intrigue the savior.”
Draco was once again pulled from his inner agony, but this time it was the soft voice of Mrs. Weasley which startled him a great deal.
A very sweet Harry chapter, I hope you enjoy!
The nod seemed to be the indicator for Dudley’s mates to indeed test it out, as they began dragging the two boys further and further away from one another. They’d only made it a few steps before Draco began to feel the dull ache bloom deep within his gut and take hold, he knew they weren’t going to make it far before it got worse. Draco tried to fight, to struggle free of the minion’s hold on him, but his grip was firm, and he was so much wider and taller than Draco.
“Me too, I don’t know how I’ll manage once we’re at Hogwarts.”
Harry looks around, then back at Malfoy who is peering up at him from his armchair looking a little timid? Draco Malfoy looking timid? This is uncharted territory for both of them Harry thinks, and it makes him feel a little more settled.
He felt Harry shift and arch up, and Draco who so desperately wanted to see Harry come perched up in time to watch as Harry’s come coated both of their pricks, mingling with his own, it was all almost enough to make him hard again.
Potter gazed up at him, his eyes searching, his mouth grinning back at Draco for a long moment before his eyes darted to look over out at the exit of their tunnel. “Stopped raining,” the brunette spoke with a nod towards where his eyes had traveled. Draco glanced, without moving from his spot bracketing Potter into the wall, and nodded in response, “I hadn’t noticed,” he stated granting Potter his full attention his eyes conveying something like, ‘I hadn’t noticed I’d been too preoccupied with your mouth, Potter.’
_ _ _ _ _
Draco doesn’t really sleep that night, but when he wakes up the next morning it’s with a new vigor. So what if Potter doesn’t like his book, what does it matter to Draco? Draco vowed to be more silent this year, not so that he wouldn’t be heard but so that he could listen more. If potter didn’t like his chosen escape, perhaps he would consider giving him another chance to try again. Honestly, Draco didn’t know what had come over him. The polite indifference that turned into a chess match of glances was one thing but seeking Potter’s approval on something Draco valued most in his life right now was really setting him on edge. Which is why when Potter plopped himself down next to Draco at breakfast that morning, he was beginning to think he would lose his mind.
Hedwig let out a little chirp of exasperation and shook her extended leg as if to give a little reminder that she was still waiting on him. “Shhh, don’t want to wake him up do you,” Harry whispered with a nod of his head in Draco’s direction.
The headmaster gave Harry a curt nod before turning to Malfoy, “Draco,” at the sound of the other boy’s name Harry craned his neck with a jolt to ascertain his reaction. Harry observed as the blonde seemed to hardly acknowledge Dumbledore, only craning his neck a fraction to meet the headmaster’s eyes. “Professor Snape and I will be in touch with you to discuss these matters privately after addressing your parents.” Draco returned Dumbledore’s statement with nothing more than a curt nod before returning his gaze to the cracks plaguing the tiled ceiling.
“I like your sweater,” was all Harry could muster and he began immediately internally chastising himself.
Before he could even act on his restless and manic notion, Mrs. Weasley could be heard summoning everyone in for dinner. He let out an audible groan, and silently expressed gratitude for the fact that he’d been sulking alone in the sitting room, and there was no one there to witness his little display of vexation. He allowed himself another moment to compose himself, sulking even further at the fact that he knew that come tomorrow he’d have to be more careful; the Slytherin dorms were not a safe place to reveal emotion, even something as trivial as agitation.
He slid Draco jeans, and pants down over his arse releasing his prick. He licked his lips at the sight. Harry leaned up and gave the head of his cock a chaste kiss and looked up into gray, pleading eyes.
With only ten minutes left in class Harry put his quill down, looked back up at the instructions at the front of the room, and signed with the relief of being finished. He placed his head in his hand leaning the weight on his elbow, intent on using the remaining ten minutes to completely zone out again, desperately wanting another break from reality. He mused that however painful it was inside his mind as of late he couldn’t seem to find the will to pull away, he was almost fearful of wasting away the summer stuck inside the painful memories trapped in his mind.
Their last night at Hogwarts seemed to pass by in a blur, neither boy saying anything to the another. It appeared as though both had signed a silent agreement that if they didn’t speak to one another in acknowledgement of their situation that maybe it wouldn’t be real. It wasn’t until the Hogwarts Express was pulling into King’s Cross Station that the reality of their situation began to sink in. Draco watched on the platform as Potter said goodbye to Weasley and Granger vowing what seemed like several hundred times to write to them. He also watched as Mr. and Mrs. Weasley hugged Potter goodbye, Mrs. Weasley throwing a stern look over in Draco’s direction making him feel wary, but also oddly wary about disappointing her; a woman who he had never even formally met before.

“I told you, you didn’t have to get me anything. The day we spent together was more than enough…I…remember it often…” Draco watched Harry’s cheeks flush knowing full well what exactly he remembered every single second of with a laugh.
I know some of you had been waiting for a little more interaction between Draco, and the Dursley's so here it is! I hope you enjoyed. I'm also sorry to leave you like this! I have to work the next 2 days, and therefore won't be as diligent in my updates! I will have a few more chapters up by Wednesday or Thursday!
“Don’t feign innocence with me Harry Potter, you know damn well what I’m talking about. You might as well have it written all over your lovesick face.”
Harry let out a short laugh, “well, ‘Mione for sure, but Ron can hardly remember his own birthday. In fact, I’m sure he only remembers to send anything because she reminds him. No, it’s not them, it’s just spending it here.”
, tongues, and hands.
“Me too Potter,” Draco spoke his face full of sincerity without his consent. As the two boys locked eyes for a moment, Potter dared grace him with a full-on grin before continuing, “so let’s not be angry, let’s just have these two months of nothing before we both have to go back to being barmy all the time, yeah?”
Not that he really cared what anyone thought of him anyways, the war had changed many things about Draco. Maybe it had made him softer, quieter, but a subtle arrogance would always remain.
Harry braced himself on the edge of the kitchen island, bracketing Draco’s thighs and letting his head hang between his shoulder’s as he tried helplessly to catch his breath. Draco ran his hands along the ridges of Harry’s back, fingers skating through his hair and back again.
Harry noticed that again, Malfoy said nothing, just nodded in response to Dumbledore’s statement. Harry began to wonder what the two professors had been discussing with Malfoy in Madam Pomfrey’s office, and why he got to know about the ‘necessary precautions in place’ and Harry did not. He idly wondered if Malfoy would tell him, when they were alone, but thought better of it, if Malfoy hadn’t spoken a word up to this point why would he start, especially to Harry. He decided to try his luck with Dumbledore instead, “Professor, what did you tell my Aunt and Uncle to get them to agree to have another wizard in their house,” Harry asked with a slightly amused expression.
Harry leaned back in and gave the head of Draco’s cock one soft kiss before taking him into his mouth filthily. Both boys moaned when the blonde was seated perfectly in Harry’s throat. Harry moved his hands from the counter to Draco’s hips, keeping him firmly in place and began to suck earnestly.
All Potter could do was grace Draco with that half-smile he was sure the other boy reserved just for him, and nod before getting up, walking around his dumbfounded uncle and following Draco out the front door.
“Draco, dear…” he turned to face the rosy cheeked woman and was met with a soft smile and a knowing look. She took his face in her hands as she spoke, “It’s going to be okay. You’re always welcome in our home, and I look forward to seeing you again, maybe at the holiday’s, yeah?” Draco felt his face heat from the intimacy of her actions and her words, he was left at her mercy and could do nothing but grace her with a smile and small nod of his head. Her smile quirked up until it met her eyes, she patted his cheek, “there’s a good boy, I suspect I will have to leave the taking care of to Harry this time.” She turned to face the brunette who had been watching the exchange take place with a look of such fondness written plainly across his face.
seeing Draco in his clothing.
For a moment both boys just stared at one another; gray and green. Before Malfoy dared break the silence by sitting up on his own elbow, “quite a nightmare you had last night Potter, alright?” The blonde spoke softly, with a tint of humor in his voice to keep the mood light, but deep-down Harry could tell he was concerned, it wasn’t as if this were the first awful dream Malfoy had witnessed.
It was all fine. Harry had been content to watch Draco nick his shirts, hoodies, joggers, even a few pairs of his socks only to find them folded neatly in his dresser a few days later. Harry always felt a little thrill wearing something Draco had been wearing just a few days before, even though he knew the other boy had washed it before returning it. There was just something about it that gave Harry a small moment of pleasure at the thought of Draco having worn it.
All the blonde could do was nod frantically, and Harry took note that Draco’s usual sarcastic remarks seemed nowhere to be found, how effective.
The last couple of weeks at Hogwarts seemed to go by in blur and in the blink of an eye. Harry felt that most days his heart was heavy, making it hard to get up and face each day. Going to classes those last few weeks had felt mundane and tiring, taking up what little energy he seemed to have. His stomach clenched each time he remembered Sirius, not wanting to believe he was truly gone. His godfather’s eyes plagued his dreams at night, at least they did when Voldemort wasn’t invading his mind with visions of death and decay.
Before Harry could truly register what was happening, he heard Draco’s voice.
“A lion, really? Is that what you think of me then Draco?” Harry asked in jest, eyes bright and Draco would swear on his life that Harry was in fact blushing.
“Well, it’s just, usually I’m counting down the minutes until I can leave this hell hole. Now I’m here wishing that we didn’t have to go just yet.”
He knew that he could only avoid Ron for so long, and he knew deep down he didn’t want to keep this from Ron. Sure, he was nervous for his reaction but now that he’d already told Mione’ he knew she’d have his back if things went wrong with Ron. Harry also knew that the longer he waited to tell Ron, the more difficult it would become to spare moments alone with a certain blonde. Harry was already on edge and growing more increasingly anxious the longer he was away from the wanker.
Draco trailed his fingertips lightly from Harry’s cheek, down his neck, across his chest, grazing a nipple, dipping into his belly button, and finally carding through the trail of hair at the seam of his pajama bottoms. “Is this okay?” Draco whispered; voice filled with awe but laced with anxiety.
Harry’s heart gave a start as soon as Draco lifted his hand to Harry’s face, and placed his lips on his. It was as if in that moment, the months of gazes, the weeks of soft touches, and moments of whispered confessions and apologies came bursting out of both boys and the two of them knew they could never be put back. Harry returned Draco’s kiss fervently, the hand he had resting on the boy’s cheek skimming up and clasping into his soft silver hair. Draco had moved his hands onto Harry’s shirt, and it was as if he was gripping on for dear life, as the two boys absorbed themselves into one another. Harry’s entire body was on fire, he felt enraptured and captured by the boy standing in front of him. The feeling was terrifying and electrifying all at once, and all Harry knew was that he didn’t want the moment to end.
Draco watched Harry’s eyes drift from his gaze down to his lips, and finally settle on the box Draco had extended out towards him in offering.
“Want to try and sneak into the shower?” Harry whispered into their alcove of shared space.
“I’m sorry, I know I took too long, I…” Draco trailed off, but Harry knew what he meant. He gazed into the other boy’s eyes so full, so earnest, and Harry was struck once again by just how fond he’d grown of Draco, and he couldn’t stop himself.
Draco was already thrumming with heat when he turned to face Potter. He rose his gray eyes up in search of green, and for a moment neither boy spoke, nor moved, they simply stared at one another. Draco was sure his mind was going to shatter into a million pieces at the rate of speed in which he was trying to process the jade color of Potter’s eyes, the disheveled darkness of his hair, and the way his hands ached to reach out and touch.
“Actually, when I asked him if I should wait to speak with him, he said I should reach out to you for advice on how best to handle the situation.”
Harry felt the loss immediately, both boys had been making a sly game out of seeing how many inconspicuous touches they could sneak without anyone being the wiser. Harry’d been pleased with their game; he’d definitely been winning. He couldn’t not touch Malfoy. He’d happily let the crowd of people pushing around them be an excuse to place a hand on Draco’s lower back guiding him away from people pushing past, while simultaneously pulling him closer so their bodies were flush from shoulder to hip.
Draco came over placing his hands in the crooks of Harry’s arms assessing him with concern.
“What Potter, you look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
Draco’s cheeks flushed rose yet again and complied, leaning back to rest his hands against the island.
Suddenly Draco sat up, fingers twisting into Harry’s already unruly hair and Harry moaned around his cock again.
I thank everyone who has stuck with me through the waiting, and I appreciate all the support and love I've gotten from a few messages while I've been absent!
“I’m sure where we’re going will be perfectly lovely,” he continued with a raise of his eyebrow, “but I can’t help but admit I’m feeling a little uneasy about it.”
Draco was conversely, considerably stressed as to how his mother would react if she knew the other parts of him, the parts that Draco had only begun to understand himself, the parts that Draco knew would never align with the Pure Blood standards. Although, Draco mused to himself, that he knew nothing he felt or thought anymore really aligned with the Pure Blood code of conduct.
He quirked the corner of his mouth in response, doing his best to meet her smile. He knew that her perception would see through him, but also knew her enough to know she wouldn’t pry if he resisted. He pulled out the chair opposite her at the table and tried to think how best to answer her question as he sat down.
The blonde placed languid and open-mouthed kisses along the brunette’s jaw, down his neck, along his collar bone, and stopped just centimeters from a dark pebbled nipple. Draco dared to look up at Harry as he hovered over the sensitive spot, warm breath ghosting across the other boys already eternally warm skin.
“I can’t promise you that I have it all figured out, myself included; I really don’t know what this means about myself. I don’t know if I’m gay, or bi-sexual, or just obsessed with you,” they both let out a small laugh at that. “But I do know I’ve never felt the way I feel about you for anyone else, and I don’t want to lose you.”
Harry watched as Draco turned back to face him, a small half-smile in place as he met his eyes, before abruptly turning back towards the table, “I almost forgot, Dudley,” he said calmly almost kindly waiting for the boy to look back up at him from the table. Harry looked on as Dudley glanced up at Draco, face pale.
“Granger’s already been up here to warn us, we’ve probably only ten minutes to get downstairs before we’re caught.”
Not only did Draco know that there was no way he could ever go back to a life where he could not touch Harry, he also knew that he had learned too much about himself and so much from Harry to ever go back to a world of blind hatred and be able to survive. He also knew he didn’t want to be filled with hate anymore. He’d spent the last year at Hogwarts coming to terms with this, and the summer with Harry had only solidified the fact that he liked himself a lot more when he was just Draco and wasn’t bogged down by all the anger and abhorrence he’d been trained to carry as a Malfoy.
Love you all so much, let me know what you think! <3 :)
“Oh really?” the other boy quirked back lips inching up into a half-smile. “Is that why you always look so deep in thought? Shouldn’t Malfoy’s be experts at gift-giving? Is there not a guide book you could consult on the proper etiquette?” Harry finished with a laugh attempting to wind his leg even more intricately with Draco’s.
Draco knew they were destined for nothing but hardship. Would they even get to finish school, would they both make it through the war, what would happen to their friends and family, what would happen to them? He knew they had no real way of knowing where this was really going between them until Voldemort was dead.
He longed to bury his face in the crook of Draco’s long neck and breath him in, for fucks sake he was truly bloody mad…
Harry was lost in the depths of his mind, reeling over the fact that he’d never found himself so enthralled by someone, and wild with the fact that it was
Let me know what you think, I'm almost 100% sure there will only be 1 MAYBE 2 more chapters left! <3
“He’s a relative of mine you know, Sirius Black.” Draco trailed off for a moment before continuing a little more timidly, “I know how he died, also a relative of mine, I… I, I’m sorry Potter.”
“Oh no, that was exactly how I knew that conversation with him would pan out. Just give him some time, now that he knows he’ll work it out in his own way…or at least that’s what ‘Mione says.”
Of course, Harry noticed Malfoy’s changed demeanor. Malfoy seemed more calm, and more sure of himself in a way that he never had before.  Harry seemed to think that this looked good on Malfoy, not that he thought Malfoy looked good. Although he did like glancing at him, especially in moments like this, curled into the armchair with a book in his lap, brow furrowed in concentration a slight flush to his cheeks immersed in whatever world the book provided him. Harry couldn’t remember the last time he had really felt swept up in something since the war ended, but he liked the idea of being able to escape and he suspected Malfoy did too which is why whenever Harry glanced over in Malfoy’s direction there seemed to be a new volume tucked into his lap.
Harry was pulled from his perturbed thoughts by Malfoy, who had his hand outstretched towards Harry, as if asking for a handshake. Harry felt like he had been transported through time, back to when he had first met Malfoy in Madam Malkins Robe shop what felt like centuries ago now. Harry’s eyes traveled from Malfoy’s hand up to his face and was met with grey eyes set on a stoic face, but there was something else there. Something on Malfoy’s face seemed almost earnest, earnest enough to make Harry reach out and clasp Draco’s hand. It wasn’t really a handshake, it was almost like holding hands awkwardly, but he couldn’t deny what he felt. As soon as their hands met, the pain seemed to melt away and was replaced by a prickle of pleasure so jolting both boys instantly let go and avoided the other’s eyes.
Draco gazed at Harry in the moment of continued silence for a moment longer before taking one of Harry’s hands in his own and facing his palm up and open. He took his other hand and placed the tiny dragon into Harry’s open palm and squeezed the boy’s hand shut and pulled both his hands away so Harry could see for himself.
But Draco wanted more, he wanted anything Harry would give him, he was high on the boy beneath him, who had precipitously started thrusting up against him, and suddenly Draco could feel just how badly Harry wanted him. It made him so hot and shaky he let out what felt like an involuntary groan and without thinking thrust back against Harry’s own equally hard cock. With that, both boys were done, any attempt at holding back was lost and they were kissing and touching with abandon. Draco let out another shaky moan as both boys rutted against each other and buried his face in Harry’s neck breathing heavily in the other boy’s ear.
After the incident where Draco had punched his uncle in the face and told his cousin to get bent, the two boys had spent less of their outside time locked away in their own heads, and more time actually talking to one another. Harry had to admit that while he told himself it was because that morning actually made Malfoy seem more human, it was also because of the heart to heart the two boys had shared prior to descending the stairs into their unyielded fate.
With harry he felt light, he felt funny, and free; he felt like himself. He couldn’t go back, and he didn’t want to. It felt more important to be true to himself than to make his family happy, and deep down he knew this is what his mother would want for him, his father be damned.
Not that he minded liking Draco, he’d become acquainted with his attraction to the blonde during their initial stint as dorm mates, one could even argue that said attraction is what led to his mission to befriend the tosser.
he thought.
Harry watched astounded as Draco turned his gaze solely on Vernon. “If you thought my right-hook was bad trust me it’s nothing compared to what I can do with my wand,” he set Harry’s uncle with a stern glare.
Harry reached a hand out to brush a loose strand of fringe from Draco’s eyes, and Draco could feel a blush begin to heat his cheeks. Though all he could do was lean into the touch and smile fondly at the other boy.
“Goodnight Hermione,” and with that Draco felt his sleeve being yanked in the direction of the stairs at long last. He looked back at Granger and gave a small wave before swiftly following behind Harry.
Draco rolled over off of Harry, facing him on his side. His face began to heat at the realization of what they had just done, and how little it took for the brunette in front of him to make him lose all control. Harry rolled onto his side and propped himself up to face Draco, a lazy grin on his face full of hazy bliss. The sight made Draco’s heart beat fast, and his stomach clench with affection for the goofy, bold, brilliant boy. Draco couldn’t stop himself from meeting Harry’s own grin with one of his own and reaching his hand out to weave his fingers through Harry’s as they laid there still catching their breath.
Harry stared down at the letter; he’d read it through a couple of times already just to be sure he hadn’t missed anything.
“Are you alright,” he said softly and with far too much fondness, willing gray eyes to look up and meet his.
There was a moment of silence where they shared a smile, but it didn’t stretch on long before Granger spoke.
Draco found that it was easy to get lost in Harry, all warm skin, flushed and soft. They’d never really ventured past thorough snogging, although there had been several occasions where Draco was sure he was going to come in his pants that luckily never came to fruition.
*****
This is what came over him that day after charms. He had been stealing glances over at Malfoy for most of the class, so much so that Hermione made a point to let him know how obvious he was being with her knowing look and a nudge of his elbow. After that he knew he needed to just talk to him. Malfoy was a person after all, and he knew that he wasn’t stupid. Malfoy had been just as involved in this game as Harry had, and therefore who was to say that he wasn’t craving more as well.
He pulled away from Harry, for the first time that summer. He pulled back into himself, and into his brooding mind for the first time in weeks.
Draco perched himself on the edge of his trunk facing Potter, “Who’s Dudley?” Draco spoke softly and without his usual sneer which appeared to almost knock Potter off his bed. Draco watched as the other boy sat up and pushed his glasses up his nose before answering him, “my cousin,” he seemed to trail off a bit at the end unsure if he should continue. Draco held his breath unsure if he should be hoping he would keep talking or let them fall back into the silence they had grown accustomed to the last couple of days, as opposed to their usual cruel banter.
Before he could really let himself derail and go full on panic attack, the brunette in his arms shifted, nuzzling deeper into Draco’s neck, Potter took a very deep breath before eliciting a content sigh and twining his leg up with Draco’s. Draco let himself close his eyes and just take in the moment, he ran his hand up and down Potter’s shoulder softly relishing in listening to the other boy’s inhales and exhales, eventually falling asleep to the soft gusts of breath grazing his neck.
“Of course, Mrs. Weasley,” Harry said, completely unable to hide his grin that daft wanker, Draco thought keenly.
Dudley was talking to Potter, what he was saying Draco didn’t know, he was focused solely on the imbecile holding him hostage. Dudley didn’t even pay Draco any mind until he was directly behind the pair, eyes darting up to focus in on Draco’s wand extended out in front of him.
“Yeah, yeah just tired is all.” He met Ron’s eyes with a smile, knowing full well he was absolutely avoiding a conversation that involved any more substance than the one he was supposed to be currently engaged in. Which is why he was doing his best to avoid catching Hermione’s eye, though she was growing more and more obvious in her attempts, and therefore, growing harder to avoid.
“Ah, Miss Granger, I understand your concern, however, Mr. Malfoy will have no choice but to accompany Mr. Potter to Little Whinging for the summer holidays. As almost everyone in this room is aware, Harry must go to his Aunt and Uncle’s it is the safest place for him, and consequently in turn it will be the safest place for Mr. Malfoy as well.”
Instead Harry had taken to stealing glances of Malfoy here and there. He’d begun to notice that sometimes when he thought he was inconspicuously stealing a glance at Malfoy that the blonde was looking right back at him. Most of these moments usually ended abruptly with both parties quickly averting their gaze, nervous at being caught out. However, more recently Malfoy had become keen to continue staring back at him until Harry’s cheeks began to heat and his heart began to race. A magnetic force pulling his gaze away and furrowing his brow in confusion. Usually, these moments also ended with Malfoy standing from his armchair in the corner of the common room and heading up the stairs towards the dormitories. Harry knew this because, that magnetic force that pulled his eyes away from Malfoy was the same one that drew him back to watch him walk away.
Draco couldn’t help but let out a laugh at that, “Trust me Hermione, I’d rather die than hurt him.”
He was pulled from his inevitable downward spiral yet again, when he felt the soft familiar graze of lips against his throat. That’s just how it was though, Harry was always saving him, always pulling him back when he got too lost and who was Draco to stop him from doing what he did best.
That was all it took, in a rush and haze of dark hair and bright green eyes Harry was clasped to him. Draco instantly wrapped one arm around Harry clenched like a snake up and around his back, while his other hand stroked through the dark locks tangling himself there as he pulled the other boy’s head back to desperately meet his lips. He couldn’t stop the soft and needy groan that escaped his lips, all fear of Harry not wanting him long forgotten. The only coherent thoughts he truly had were of lips, and teeth, and
“I just needed some space to get my thoughts in order,” was all he could think to say. I mean how else could he truly respond, ‘I laid around all day sulking and wishing the summer wouldn’t end so I wouldn’t be forced to face any version of the several scenarios I’ve conjured up the last few days?’ Surely, she would find him mad and despite their recent reconciliation he wasn’t sure how she would react to a sudden fearful admission from him just before dinner.
Suddenly, Draco was overcome with just exactly how he could express his happiness at Harry’s birth. He put all his weight on the elbow tucked into his side and leaned up, hand cradling the other boy’s cheek and pressed his lips and his body against Harry’s deliciously.  Both boys let out a groan and met again with lips and tongues and teeth, eyes heavy with lust.
“I know you’re asking me to choose a side, but it’s not that easy, it’s not black and white at least not for me. They’re my parents, Harry.”
if he didn’t feel alive. His whole body was on fire his only focus on touching and kissing and sucking anywhere on Harry he could get his hands or mouth on. He felt like a man dying of thirst, and Harry was a vast lake that he wanted nothing more than to drown in.
Harry lurched forward as his eyes laid on Draco’s hunched form. Without a thought he pulled from Hermione intent on reaching Draco. And just like that it was as if the blonde could sense his presence, he looked up eyes filled with relief and Harry watched Draco straighten and meet him halfway in a solid embrace, and his senses were filled with nothing but
“Look, I promise I have the fullest intention of speaking with Ron. It’s just, well, I mean look around. There isn’t exactly an opportunity to pull him away right now, not when we’ve only just got here. I’m hoping for some time after dinner, maybe?” Hermione gave him a formidable look, grave, and unsmiling.
Hermione gave Ron a pointed look, and they both glanced back over at Harry bearing him with a timid look of confliction. “Do you remember anything about Snape’s last class Harry?” Hermione asked tentatively. Harry closed his eyes for a moment and tried to think back to the last thing he could remember, what had happened to him that landed him in the hospital wing? Although it wasn’t as if Harry was a stranger to ending up in this particular part of the castle, in fact Madam Pomfrey really should have a bed here with his name on it by now.
Nevertheless, that had been all day and now after dinner was done and Mrs. Weasley had shucked everyone off to finish their packing for school the following day, Harry had felt desperate for Draco – who was nowhere to be found.
Harry was the first to pull back, and Draco felt a little edgy, but Harry tugged at his chin, and ran his fingertips down Draco’s cheek, and he was so lost in those green eyes, drowning in them. Harry hit him with one of those half-smiles the kind that made his stomach flip, and Draco was powerless when his own lips quirked up to mirror the brunette; a silent question met with a silent answer.
His mind was also trying to wrap around the idea of what Potter might be thinking as he stared back at him. Draco knew that Potter was a person of action, and often did things without thinking, and he didn’t know what that meant in terms of Potter’s feelings towards Draco. He wanted to believe action on impulse was a real demonstration of Potter’s innermost desires, but he was also afraid that Potter’s instinct to act before thinking didn’t give him any time to process and determine what he really wanted.
“Come on, come on, dinner’s about to be served. Oh Remus, do say you’re joining us.”
“let me return the favor,” he whispered into Harry’s skin.
His heart did ache at the thought that Draco wouldn’t gain the opportunity to do the same with his family. Although, he also couldn’t shake the idea that his mother and father didn’t truly care for Draco’s well-being because if they had they wouldn’t have ever dreamed to make him do something as awful as become a death eater. They didn’t deserve him.
Draco couldn’t help but smile softly to himself, they made quite a lovesick pair, the two of them. The thought gave him the little nudge of courage he needed, and so he approached with caution.
The blonde wrapped his arms around him securely gripping the back of his jumper and breathing him in. Harry relished in it, wrapped himself around the moment and instantly felt the ache lift. He pulled back for a moment and looked up at Draco hands cupping the boy’s soft cheeks.
When they had both disappeared out into the hall, he turned back to him. “Malfoy,” he gave Draco a curt nod as if to acknowledge his presence there before proceeding. “I wanted to ask you about those books you’re always reading up in the common room.”
“You don’t think he’ll be cross with me, even though I’m the one Harry told first?”
Draco and Hermione looked up as the group of Weasley’s followed by Harry were trudging back from the open field they’d been using to play.
Draco felt his whole body redden and he pulled away from Harry sheepishly. “Oh, um…I mean only if you’d want me to that is, no pressure, none at all,” he rushed out a tint wariness in his voice. Draco felt himself flush more if that were even possible, “Of course I want you to, I’d be bloody mad not to want you to,” he spoke in a hurry to halt the other boy’s train of thought. “It’s just well,” Draco flicked his eyes up to the other boys and then back down to the sheets before continuing, “you were just so incredibly hot, and the way you kept saying my name all breathy and, and,” he let out a shaky breath and allowed his eyes to flick back up to Harry’s, “I, I came when you did.”
“You’re right, Potter, we’ve had to grow-up quickly. But I’m still sorry for the prick I was to you, to everyone really.”
Draco let out a laugh, and shoved Harry’s shoulder, “yes with us, are you daft Potter?”
“Shut the fuck up Potter, don’t presume to think you know anything about me, you don’t.” Malfoy spoke softly and without malice, his eyes were down cast and he had a look on his face that made him look so much younger than he was, and it yanked on the strings of Harry’s heart just a bit. Harry mused to himself that the Malfoy he was most familiar with would have told him to fuck off a long time ago, hell, the Malfoy that he was most familiar with wouldn’t dare touch Harry let alone comfort him after an awful dream. The way Malfoy was treating him, these were not changes that could be made in an instant, with the snap of a finger, and so it made Harry even more curious about the blonde who seemed to rile him up in more ways than one.
How wrong Harry was. The story was so intense that he found he needed to take several breaks in between sections of reading, making him realize why it had been four long nights before Draco padded down the stairs to leave the story with him. Reading that particular novel was less an escape and more of a hard look at what had quickly developed between himself and Draco. It was intoxicating and addicting to read inside the mind of someone who was suffering from the same beguiling relationship that he was. Never before had he found himself so engulfed and dependent on a book in his life, and when he was finally finished, he felt that he was almost gasping for air at the intensity of it all. He found that he didn’t want the same ending as Oliver and Elio from the story, he wanted Draco to stay and he wanted to stay. He wanted to face the world and whatever lay before them because he was definitely without a doubt irrevocably in love with Draco Malfoy.
“Fine, then,” he mutters as his friend stays quiet and unresponsive.
Higgins, Bletchley, Walter and Parkinson give Harry reports about the wand-check process; nearly half of the students’ wands have already been inspected, but nothing alarming – and no Unlocking Spells – has come up yet.
,” He points out, the corner of his mouth twitching. He earns a scowl from Malfoy in return.
Rose shakes her head. “No. She was quite a lot calmer than she had been in the corridor earlier,” she says resolutely.
? Draco nearly stumbles on a small rock as his mind goes rocketing into different directions. When Potter doesn’t continue, Draco clears his throat before he speaks. “You’ve lost me, I’m afraid,” He says mutedly, trying not to sound too curious.
Even though Malfoy’s voice stays calm, there’s a storm of rage in his eyes.
Draco nods at him and Potter vanishes into his room.
There’s a short silence.
Ron smirks back. “Ouch.” He then sobers and turns to Harry. “What can I do?”
He feels Rose’s eyes on him. “Is – is everything okay with you and, um, Scorpius?”
to yourself, James!” Albus says incredulously. “You have a
“Hello, James,” Quinn says kindly.
during New Year’s!” He shrieks, glaring at the boy below him.
The Headmistress eyes Albus, James, Scorpius and Rose. “And as each of you is either related to the Auror leading the case or to the crime scene investigator investigating it,” She says, nodding at Albus’s father, “Mr Potter has arranged an Auror to carry out the questioning. You will be accompanied by your parents and your Heads of House. Although, Mr Potter,” she adds, looking at James, “as you are of age, you may decide if you wish to include your parents. However, since we are at school grounds, Professor Fox will accompany you nevertheless.”
As soon as Berrycloth, Fungbury, Keir, Quinn and Draco sit down around the table, Potter starts to speak.
There was nothing out of the ordinary with the train’s wards, or with the train; nor had there been any outsiders passing the wards, matching up quite well to what the train driver and the trolley witch had told him. And why had he proceeded the way he had, one might ask? Draco knows the importance of examining the body without delay – he knows that some evidence; potions, for example, might be difficult to identify after a certain amount of time had passed.
“Did you go to Travers’s compartment?”
Draco’s jaw clenches, as he thinks how the witch had made his son a suspect simply by lying to the Aurors.
James is silent, looking at his lap. “I’m sorry, Albus.”
Harry frowns slightly. Albus
Draco wonders, what the bloody hell that was, and if Auror Quinn – who Draco thinks with a mild irritation, is too good-looking to be an Auror – had perhaps learned something that could help solve the case.
Harry accompanies James to the familiar, seventh-years’ dormitory – which is in quite a mess, and definitely had not been that bad during Harry’s time, he notes – and he watches as James walks up to his trunk, situated at the foot of the middle bed on the left side of the room.
And it is such a fucking disappointment. Albus can almost see the cloud of bitterness and jealousy and resentment flooding into him, filling him and twisting his insides.
“Huh?” Scorpius hums as he turns to Albus, after clearing his expression into a blank one.
“Apparently, someone told the Aurors that you were fighting with Travers in the train, alone.” Albus tells Scorpius quietly, as they walk towards the Entrance Hall.
Harry sighs wearily, trailing a hand through his hair in order to soothe it down, knowing, it must be sticking into all kinds of directions after Malfoy’s long fingers were –
“Yeah,” Cory says slowly, his eyes lingering on Albus’s face. “Said he wasn’t feeling well,” he continues quietly. “How was it? The thing? You okay?”
Harry gives James a sharp look, and takes the Map from him. “Thanks, James. This could help us a lot. And you just spared me a trip to London and back,” he says tightly, and is somewhat annoyed that James doesn’t even have the grace to look embarrassed.
“What’s the matter with you?” Albus hisses next to Scorpius’s ear. “You’ve been acting weird since the train!” He continues exasperatedly.
“Did she threaten you?” Quinn asks then.
“I should’ve checked on them…there probably wouldn’t have been a party,” Potter continues, and then sighs wearily, “And our sons probably wouldn’t be questioned now.”
“Are you okay?” Scorpius asks quietly, absently.
, just so they can tell their friends that they’ve been with the Chosen One look-a-like? Harry bristles. He feels shocked. He feels angered. He feels powerless. He is the one who is supposed to protect his children, and the fact that he is the reason for Albus’s troubles, is…overwhelming.
McGonagall nods in agreement. “That would make me more at ease, if it is possible in a situation like this.”
There’s a collective gasp and then – several people start to scream in shock, and even more people jump to their feet, their wands at the ready, many voices shouting over each other with panic-laced voices.
“Did you attend the party your brother organised during New Year’s?” Quinn asks from Albus.
her?” He asks weakly, moving his eyes back to Bones’s.
Harry gives her a curt nod. “I have eight Aurors for school and grounds. The rest of us will move to search the village and the train,” he says promptly.
They are quiet, until they reach McGonagall’s office.
He hears that Dominique – a fifth-year Prefect and Bill’s daughter – has been questioned by Bones, but when Harry asks if it went well, the girl simply shrugs him off with Fleur-like indifference. Lily and Hugo are both curious to know more, but do not badger him once he tells everyone they will receive more information from the Headmistress and their Head of House. Lily gives him a crushing hug, while James – who is somewhat quieter than usual – asks Harry to speak with him alone.
Quinn nods slowly. “And Albus?” He asks carefully.
Albus watches carefully, as Scorpius proceeds to fill his plate. “You all right?” Albus asks, taking note of his friend’s every move.
“Do you want to –”
“Travers had a dispute in the party with James and his friends. She left soon after her arrival. James did not see Travers at all during the train ride, but spent it with his friends and girlfriend, leaving them only for thirty minutes, during which he met with Rose and Hugo Granger-Weasley, approximately one to two hours before the train arrived to Hogsmeade. Rose Granger-Weasley’s questioning confirms that James did indeed see her and her brother during the train ride, but she couldn’t say if it took exactly thirty minutes.”
Harry had acquired a look of vast confusion. “Hold on,” he stated anxiously. “What do you mean I’ve been bonded to Malfoy, what does that even mean?” It seemed that the headmaster had taken Hermione’s pointed look to heart and spoke up first this time, “unfortunately, Harry it means exactly as it sounds, you are bonded to Draco.”
In truth, Harry had no real desire to say goodbye to the Dursley’s, least of all Dudley. He felt certain that Draco felt the same way. As they reached the bottom of the stairs Remus urged him on into the kitchen where he was sure all three Dursley’s were waiting; for the two of them to finally be gone undoubtedly.
He watched Potter roll his eyes insincerely and meet his soft smile with one of his own, “Oh shove off Malfoy. Now, aren’t you going to invite me in? Where are all those posh manners you’re always on about?” It was Draco’s turn to roll his eyes, but he opened his door wider and stepped to the side to let Potter in, closing the door behind them.
I hope you enjoyed it, as always I love all of your comments, they fuel me! <3
Harry met Malfoy’s gray gaze and returned his statement like question with a soft smile before speaking, “Why not, Malfoy?”
“Yeah…they got into a bit this morning, and Ron left in a huff upset he hadn’t been the first to know…”
“That summer, that summer after the Tri-Wizard Tournament, my home was not the same,” Malfoy spoke his eyes fixated on the rumpled blankets strewn about on the bed. He hesitantly continued, “I’m used to going home and facing scrutiny, Malfoy’s must be perfect after all, so it’s never really been a warm welcome. But this last summer, it was hell Potter.”
“I guess the two of you have a point then,” she laughed. “I suppose with Ronald the best approach is to just be direct. He’s not great at trying to put pieces together so it’s best to just be straight forward…honestly Draco, I don’t think you need to be quite so nervous. It’s clear Harry is smitten, and Ronald loves Harry and wants him to be happy. He will come around I’m sure of it.”
Quickly putting pieces together in his mind, Draco reasoned with himself that if he took the biggest leap of faith there was, if he dared open up his heart to horrible rejection, there was still time to rectify the situation before they returned to school. And who would Potter possibly tell? He would probably be too embarrassed, especially with the fact that it was Draco, and wouldn’t ever tell a soul that, that… Draco’s train of thought was jilted as he felt the softness of Potter’s lips ghost over the skin of his neck and Draco involuntarily let out a soft whimper of a sound and responded without a second thought.
“Fuck off,” Draco said flipping up his middle finger before turning back towards Harry and Lupin.
As the two boys sat in quiet contemplation during the bus ride back to Little Whinging from the shops, Draco couldn’t help but let his small Harry reserved, half-smile remain. Draco looked down at the small stack of books seated in his lap, remembering how the brunette had watched him scour the bookshelves of the shop pretending to scowl in disinterest as he began pulling books out to inspect. Though Harry walked out of the shop empty handed, he could tell the other boy had still enjoyed himself, and they both admitted on the walk back to the bus after lunch that it had been a much-needed change of pace from the past week of silent brooding.
“Me too,” he spoke earnestly, wishing the other boy would meet his eyes again.
Hermione donned a face of contemplation, her facial expressions telling Harry that she was in agreement with that statement, she gave her own huff before continuing, “Oh, fine Harry. You’ve been bonded to Malfoy” she finished with throwing her hands down into her lap in an exasperated sigh. “Why I am always the one breaking the bad news to Harry,” she said with a pointed look at both their professors.
Draco felt his cheeks flush, and his insides vault. However, before he could react the brunette drove on.
He should have felt embarrassed as Draco dropped to his own knees on the floor leaning over Harry for the hottest fucking kiss of his life, as his fingers reached for Harry’s flies. The thing was he wasn’t embarrassed at all, this was Draco.
Harry’s mind was reeling as he paced back and forth in the tiny space of the room he now shared with Malfoy, he wasn’t sure he could even really think about it as just his room anymore. The familiar ache of the bond had started to take form twisting his insides, creating a dull ache. Malfoy had only been in the shower for maybe ten minutes and he was already beginning to feel weak from the blooming pain. Though to be fair, Harry had taken the first shower, and had been hoping to keep the pain mildly at bay with at least a small touch from the other boy, anything to avoid what he was feeling now but Draco had hurried into the shower without a second glance or spoken word to harry.
“This is brilliant Draco, really.”
All Harry could do was laugh, as he looked from Draco to Remus, who’s amused look seemed plastered to his face as he looked between the two of them before leading the way back out into the entryway of the house.
“Oh?”
In the spirt of full disclosure, he hadn’t been entirely sure where they’d been headed Harry had only known that he’d wanted to get the blonde alone. The closer they got to the pitch; Harry began searching around for anywhere that was at least semi-private. Knowing full well that there was a chance someone was seeing them from one of the Burrow’s various windows at that very moment. Harry’s eyes hit the storage shed where the Weasley’s kept their brooms and Quidditch gear, and quickly glanced back towards the house hoping that the shed would be enough of an obstruction from prying eyes.
Draco spends the rest of the day agonizing over which of the books in his swiftly growing collection he should share with Potter. He thinks it’s interesting because he’s never thought of loaning someone a book as something so intimate before. However, he’s never really had the opportunity to share his books with anyone until now either. During his time at home after the war Draco found he needed something, a distraction from everything going on around him. Watching his father’s trial and subsequent shipping off to Azkaban, his mother’s numerous and dubious coping mechanisms, and flitting around a house that was more reminiscent of a prison than the place where he grew up, despite his mother’s best efforts.
The two boys watched mutely as Dudley nodded at his two cronies, and before Draco could think about it or react, one of the hefty boys had hoisted him up by his biceps yanking his arms behind his back and keeping him in place with his back pressed against the foreign boy’s chest. By the time Draco could recover, his eyes locked with Potter’s who seemed to be in the same position as him struggling against his assailant.
In that moment without even trying to listen he knew they’d been caught out by Ron.
Slowly, he slid one hand from the brunette’s hair, and down to rest on his back pulling him in closer before using the hand fisted in raven locks as leverage to tug him from his safe haven tucked away in the crook of Draco’s neck and forced green to meet gray. The tunnel went stark silent. All he could hear was the ragged breath being pulled from both of them, feeling it fill the space around them, not even the thundering rain could be heard in Draco’s mind. On pure feeling and instinct, he surged forward brushing his lips against Potter’s before slowly pulling away eyes still closed, nervous as to what he would find written on the other boy’s face should their eyes meet again.
“Oh, absolutely,” Harry responded before hoisting the blonde back up by the thighs and carrying him off to their bathroom. The sound of Draco’s laughter echoing throughout their flat the entire way.
“Time to find out if this little ‘bond’ I’ve overheard mum and dad talking about is for real,” Dudley spoke with a smirk. “I heard them say it could be real painful for you to be separated from each other, let’s find out shall we?” He finished with a nod; voice filled with malice, sneer full force.
He felt a lot like Elio, from his alternate reality, he could relate to the way this character had quickly and without warning become completely beguiled by someone who he thought didn’t even like him. The feelings of confusion, that Elio has in regard to the intoxicating exhilaration he feels when near Oliver are one’s that Draco could narrate without having to think too deeply about. It also doesn’t help that Potter has stopped rubbing circles on Draco’s ankle, and instead opted to just rest his hand there in a soft grip as if not touching him at all isn’t an option. Which is making it impossible to give his brain the clearance it needs to fully absorb the story in his lap, so instead he gives in to Potter. He closes his book, settles himself into the sofa more comfortably, closes his eyes and gives into the feeling of just letting himself be there in that moment with a boy that makes his chest hurt in the most addicting way.
Draco spoke it so earnestly, in his usual way, in the way that Harry was surprised he was growing used to, in the way that Harry had grown particularly fond of, and in a way that made his response come so easily to his lips.
Harry looked over fondly at the blonde who was curled up faced away from him, a first for them since they’d not even been this distant on night one. All he longed to do was reach over to the blonde, run his fingers along his spine, bury his face in the crook of his neck and breathe him in, tease him about his blatant confession of loving Harry for much longer than he’d been willing to admit (how long had it been exactly?), and so why couldn’t he? Why was he holding himself back?
Secretly, Draco had been thrilled by the letter. Mostly because it was clear that whatever Harry had written was enough to convince Hermione Granger that he was in love with Draco. “And yes, Harry, you didn’t have to say it in your letter, it’s clear your more than fond. The rambling was very telling.”  He’dbeen replaying the words in his mind over and over that day. Sure, Harry had explicitly told him he loved him and continued to do so, but now he’d pretty much confessed as much to someone else.
“Potter,” Draco spoke softly, his gaze intense as it scanned over Harry’s features, “your screams shook the entire house, I’m shocked your aunt and uncle didn’t scramble in here ready to strangle you, or at the very least flee the house to protect themselves from whatever was murdering you.”
“Okay, then. Best be off boys.” With that Remus, began to steer them out of the room only a bit awkwardly.
“Of course, it is, who would want to spend their sixteenth birthday with such charming muggles,” Malfoy nudged Harry’s elbow with his own, a grin gracing his face full force. Harry couldn’t help but let out a laugh and grin back at him. Feeling unsure if he would ever get used to the way Malfoy’s face looked lit up with a smile, and how it seemed to make his stomach twist in a way that made him want to elicit that same smile over and over again.
Harry sighed, running his hands over his face, and wiping the sleep from his eyes, not that he’d gotten any real sleep that night. Why was he holding himself back from the one person who he’d admitted to himself more than once that summer was the one person, he felt understood him? He knew what it was like to experience things no child should, to suffer at the hands of a pre-determined destiny, Draco knew him, and he could be himself around him, and above all Draco loved him. He resisted the urge to act on his impulse and reach out for Draco, but he knew they both needed time.
“Oh great, we’ve got another Hermione. Is this how it’s going to be now, the two of them rambling on like this?”
Harry maintained eye contact with Draco, the half-smile returning softly, giving Draco a little reprieve.
“Ready boys?” Without waiting for a response Lupin began shrinking their school trunks, “best to just let Hedwig out Harry, so I can get her cage.”
“You see…well, I mean…I know the bond is going to wear off in a few days, or at least it should, it’s never been very clear…I mean, well that doesn’t matter so much. The point is, the charm should mimic our bond so when it wears off, and we’re apart far more often then we’d like to be…you can touch that dragon and it will feel like it feels when we touch now…”
Harry had been woken up several times in the short amount of time they’d been bunking together with Malfoy’s sad whimpers as he tossed and turned on the three times to small cot they shared. But did Harry dare share his nightmares with Malfoy?
Draco mused that he was now being forced to make a very adult decision, at the very ripe age of sixteen and it felt very unfair. How could he turn his back on his family, or at the very least his mother? He knew deep down that his mother would do anything to keep him safe, she’d already demonstrated as much after Voldemort had taken up residence in his childhood home. He didn’t want to put her in danger, he wasn’t positive enough that his father could or would protect her.
He’d been stuck there every single time he gave it another read through. Harry let out a strangled sigh, and felt the bed begin to shift before warm soft arms encircled his waist.
“Have you noticed how different Malfoy seems, I don’t think I’ve heard him speak since we arrived?” He said before taking a bite of toast and glancing down towards Malfoy at the eighth-year dining table.
Albus thinks his friend has been off since New Year’s Eve, truth to be told.
He’s – he doesn’t even know what he
“Those things alone make you closer to the girl than most of the students here,” their father states.
Malfoy watches back unblinkingly, and after a moment Harry wants to look away from the intense pair of grey eyes – eyes that have been haunting his dreams during his weakest moments. But he forces himself to hold Malfoy’s gaze, forces himself to focus in present. He has a job to do. A possible murder to solve.
He wonders, if he’d be okay with Rose and Scorpius dating. It doesn’t
He decides to start with the dungeons, and goes back to the Entrance Hall, then takes the door on the right side, and walks down the set of stone steps towards the dungeons. In his mind, Harry goes over the answers from the three students, examining the details and if they had any inconsistencies between their stories, or anything that might have stood out. Why did Miss Westen tell him about Riley’s jealousy? What was distracting Miss Travers? Another boy? Could Riley have done something out of jealousy?
“It is time to solve this case,” Harry tells the audience. “There are two possible solutions to what happened to Jenna Travers on the Hogwarts Express, 9 January. One of the solutions is quite simple, but, unfortunately, would leave an offender unsentenced, for the time being. This solution would fit with most, but not all the facts.” Harry speaks grimly, feeling the tension around him in the Great Hall.
Malfoy’s brows twitch slightly. “Perhaps I was.”
defeat the darkest wizard there was…”
He gives Scorpius one last scrutinising look, and then follows his line of sight. Scorpius is watching James, Albus’s brother, who is in the process of scowling at them. He glances back to Scorpius and sees his friend’s jaw tightening, and has an idea of what could be the issue.
A frown takes place between Harry’s brows. “Take a seat, Malfoy,” Harry says quietly, feeling nervous. If Ginny reacted the way she did, Harry’s not looking forward to see how Malfoy will, as he will be asked the same thing.
Draco lifts his brows in question, leaning back in his chair.
Potter nods. “We need to speak with the Headmistress first before starting the questioning. Do you mind if I am present when Quinn will question Scorpius?”
Harry sees how there’s a flicker of shock on Malfoy’s otherwise expressionless look, as then the man glances at his son. Harry too feels…apprehensive.
James leaves after hugging Ginny, and after murmuring a quiet ‘later’ to Harry. Ginny looks stonily at the Malfoys, before giving Harry a sharp look.
Draco gives Potter a dry look. “In the flesh.”
“What the fuck, Scor?” Albus asks, keeping his voice steady, but unable to suppress the glare in his eyes. His chest feels heavy, and he tries to ignore it. “What the
Harry hears Hermione walking closer to him, before sitting down next to him.
She had screamed her voice hoarse an hour and a half earlier, when Harry had spoken with her after Riley’s interrogation. Harry had explained her everything Albus and James had told him earlier, and everything he was allowed to say to her regarding the investigation. Ginny had been beside herself with anger, her magic sparkling around her threateningly. It wasn’t of course all meant for Harry; she was fuming at James for organising a party, including alcohol, which made it much more serious, since some of the guests had been underage. James could be arrested for it – even if he had nothing to do with other people’s drinks. Harry knew that Ginny was also angry at herself for bailing to work and leaving Harry with the kids; annoyed at Harry for leaving the kids by themselves and going to work on New Year’s Eve and being gone for the night; disappointed at Albus for not telling them he had been dating someone four months ago. She was also furious at the wizarding world in general for their obsession about Harry Potter, and how it was causing pain and sorrow to her son.
Draco watches Potter silently. “How would you explain the book? Or the unlocked door?”
Draco knows that Travers’s wand was more carefully inspected at the Ministry, by spells more thorough than Reverse Spell, which can only display the echo of the last spell the wand has performed.
The gargoyle leaps away, revealing the familiar circling stairs Harry hasn’t seen in such a long time. The stairs take them upstairs, and after knocking to the door and hearing a quiet ‘
“Silence, everyone!” McGonagall yells, and manages to take everyone by surprise.
Albus scoffs, turning around to face his brother. “Not anyone’s business? Not –
Albus wonders. Even Albus’s father seems to be coming along with Scorpius’s father, and they were the ones who were brawling their entire time at school.
A short, uneven breath leaves Malfoy’s lips. “What are you doing, Potter?” Malfoy asks with a blank look, unable to hide the roughness in his voice. He doesn’t move away.
Quinn nods. “Could you state your whole name and birthday for me, James?”
?” Malfoy continues, seething.
“…I can’t fucking believe this,” James rumbles under his breath, only moments after they have started their work in the small room next to the infirmary. “I could be at dinner – or – playing Quidditch – or – fuck – doing whatever the hell I
The Headmistress looks exasperated. “I’m sure all of you have already heard about it from your house Prefects or through the Hogwarts’s grapevine. I will make the official announcement during breakfast.”
Travers. “So, it
“Miss Travers was threatening you, yes?” Quinn asks again.
Professors Fox, Longbottom and Moonstone are in the middle of an intense discussion with three students – sixth year Hufflepuffs; Skylar Westen, Stefan Woods and Nate Riley. Albus can’t see their faces and expressions, as they are situated on the other end of the hall, but wonders what it is about.
“ –Potter,” Scorpius says stiffly, “We need to talk.”
?” Potter, one of the two Aurors, asks, and when Draco stands up and turns to give him and the other one an unimpressed look, he continues, “This is a crime scene! You have no permission to be here!” He shouts, lifting his wand towards Draco.
Harry pulls Malfoy’s head up, presses his lips softly against his, “
The fifth-year Ravenclaw had stayed in a compartment with her cousins for most of the train ride. She had met Travers at the luggage department, after which, she had lent her book to her.
Having thought about it several times during the past day, about Malfoy’s touch and his lips, Harry has had to force everything down, somewhere deep in his mind, in order to focus on his job. And now that he finally has a moment of quietness, a moment when he can think of something else than the fates of his children, or the crime they ought to solve, he wants very much to think of the previous night. He can still go and check the compartment later.
Albus nods. “I saw her at the train, talking with Scorpius.”
Albus watches as his mother leaves through the front doors in the Entrance Hall, his stomach twisting nervously. He’s going to be questioned under Veritaserum the next day, and even though he has nothing to hide – at least regarding Travers – he can’t stop feeling worried.
Albus’s mind spins. He wonders, why Scorpius is being questioned? If the Aurors didn’t know that Albus talked – or rowed, more like – with Travers and Riley, then surely they don’t know about Scorpius’s involvement either.
And then, something heavy and unpleasant drops in his stomach, as he realises something else. What James had heard Travers say on the train, implicates that she knew Harry was single and possibly looking for a partner. He thinks, if Albus had known about his parents’ separation, and told Travers about it.
“The Aurors have been called to investigate the matter. I do not know much, yet. I do not know if there are other people associated with the incident. All I know, is that the safest place for everyone is here, in this school, in this hall. Stay put, and do not panic,” McGonagall says sternly.
Harry frowns, thinking fast. “We need to check everyone’s wands,” he says grimly.
Harry jumps slightly – he hadn't heard Quinn approaching him. He clears his throat and nods at Quinn. “Is James ready?”
Potter takes one step up the stairs, and he’s standing so close to Draco now that their bodies are nearly touching. Draco feels the anticipation fluttering down his spine, as well as the urgent overwhelming need flooding into his groin, as he gazes into Potter’s darkened eyes.
“What the hell is this?!” Ginny asks again, her eyes blazing with anger, before she turns to her son. “Albus, what
Malfoy looks slightly bothered, and glances away briefly, before giving Harry a serious look. “Well, yes, actually. But I suppose it is not necessarily good news,” He says, pulling a book – the one that was lying in the pool of blood in the compartment they found Miss Travers from, now dried – from the chair next to him and places it on the table.
with him? Why would James’s words make his insides sizzling like that? Why? Albus is frustrated, is enraged, is confused.
“I dunno. She didn’t tell me,” Riley tells Harry, holding his gaze. “She was stressed out by something, and I…kinda,” Riley says with a grimace, “was frustrated by that. She blew me off, told me she’d need to change into her school robes and that she’d go to the carriages with Skylar, and that she’d meet me in school.”
Harry gives a calming pat on his son’s shoulder, and then sees Scorpius hesitantly trailing after Albus. “Hey boys,” He greets and then sees Parkinson, talking with two older students in one corner, while sweeping the room with his gaze every once in a while. He nods at Harry when their eyes meet.
Harry lifts his brows at her.
Albus’s mind whirls, as he tries to understand what the hell is going on. He thinks hard about everything he just heard. James…did James do it? The mistake? Is – is James the reason Travers is dead? Dread flickers to the bottom of Albus’s stomach; what if Scorpius and James have something to do with Travers’s death? What if one of them…what if they killed her?
“Yes,” Rose says quickly. “I might be the last person who saw Jenna Travers alive in the train.”
They are alone once more. They look at each other, but neither of them speaks. Harry knows what the reserve in Draco’s grey eyes means: they have a lot of talking to be done. Apologies, forgiveness, acceptance – and Harry knows it will not be uncomplicated, and that it will be bloody frustrating, and dreadful, and it might not even work out between them. But at the same time, he thinks…that it if he does not see it through, he will regret it for the rest of his life.
“Bones?” Potter asks, interrupting Draco’s thoughts, as he gestures for the Auror sitting beside Keir to give her report.
“What is it?” Draco asks, watching Potter closely, disregarding the sting of irritation he feels at the man, who is apparently capable of performing wandless magic, as he keeps waving his hand over the door.
What did Potter mean about his marriage? That they are not, in fact, a happily married couple anymore, and haven’t been that for the past two years? That they are not even together anymore? Draco doesn’t know how to interpret Potter’s words.
Albus frowns deeply at his cousin before moving his gaze at the table.
There’s a shocked silence.
“Sir,” Smith, an Auror in his mid-thirties, and Bones’s partner, is the first one to walk up to Harry, looking alert but worried at the same time.
There’s a tense silence.
Malfoy looks at him, a hint of a smirk playing on his lips before he speaks.
After the Minister had left, followed by Hermione, Harry had met with Ginny, and together, they had decided to talk to their children about their divorce. In order to preserve some privacy, they had taken up one of the small classrooms on the second floor. It had been uncomfortable, quiet and painful, had left Harry feeling raw and concerned. He reckoned Ginny was feeling quite along the same lines.
?” Draco and Potter ask at the same time. Potter looks puzzled, but Draco thinks, he himself definitely looks horrified. What in the name of Salazar is Scorpius playing? What has he meddled into?
“What the hell are you doing in here,
“…ALBUS?!” His mother shrieks, and Albus can’t really blame her.
Moonstone nods slowly, studying Harry’s features.
McGonagall sniffs and gives Harry a horrified look.
Harry licks his lips, staring at the expressionless mask on Malfoy’s face, turned away from Harry. He then realises that Malfoy hasn’t said ‘no’. That he hasn’t said if he wants it to happen again. Which…Harry thinks he does. Or…he at least hopes so.
He stares at the parchment for a long moment, before letting out a huff of breath, feeling light, feeling a rush of excitement at the one word above Draco’s signature.
Hermione lifts up a calming hand, or perhaps a hand to stop his spiralling painful thoughts – Harry’s not sure which. “None of ours,” she says quickly, reassuringly, knowing what was the very first thought in Harry’s mind. She continues with a grim look and heavy tone, “But a sixth-year girl was found dead in one of the train compartments. Her name was Jenna Travers.”
Voices carry over to him from the distance. Someone is moving in the corridor, walking closer to him.
McGonagall watches the students gravely. “There has been an incident in the train. A girl…a girl has been found dead – “
“Malfoy,” Potter says, cutting off his explanation to Granger.
as well.
Albus still feels the anxiousness and nausea curling in his stomach. He manages to catch his brother’s eye from the Gryffindor table, gives him an intent stare, a questioning look. James looks back steadily, before shaking his head slightly; indicating that no one of the Gryffindor house is missing from the Hall. Albus gives his brother a similar kind of gesture.
Albus doesn’t remember much from the walk back to his dorm after the questioning, after finding out about his brother and Scorpius. He’s definitely not mad because of some
“…Fuck,” Albus mutters, furiously shaking his head, feeling how his throat keeps tightening, how his breath is hitching. “I didn’t – don’t listen to me…” He gasps, turning away from his cousin, turning his back to her and hoping to bloody Slytherin that she doesn’t ask why, or that she doesn’t bring up the fact that Albus is trying so fucking hard not to cry in front of her.
“What about?” Harry asks curiously.
Ron gives him a strained look. “I know you’ll crack it. You’re the best there is,” He says, and when Harry glances at him with a wary look, Ron shrugs and continues pointedly, “I mean, you
Draco barely suppresses a much-needed sneer. What does Weasley think, exactly? That Potter has been slacking during his time in here? That he has had all the time in the world, during a possible murder investigation? Now that Draco is looking at him, and seeing how exhausted Potter looks, he reckons the poor bloke probably hasn’t been able to take a proper breath during the whole day before now, and even now he is being reprimanded by his wife.
been sure of it before.
“What the bloody fuck, Al?!” James yells, and then they’re openly duelling, backing towards the hallway, sending hexes and jinxes in a rapid pace, whenever they’re not blocking what the other throws forward.
Harry narrows his eyes slightly. “And how did that make you feel?” He asks, wondering if that would be enough for the bloke to actually harm his girlfriend – or worse; accidentally kill her.
Once he is positive that he’s alone, Draco lets his shoulders sag down, taking in several deep breaths before continuing his inspection.
Susan Bones – Harry’s old classmate – runs the pub now, and she greets him heartily, before telling him that he shouldn’t hesitate to ask if there was something he needed. She tells him that the pub is closed for everyone but the Aurors at this time of day, and that she will turn in soon, but her bartender; Douglas, will stay up for a bit longer, should they wish to eat or drink something. Harry gives her a grateful smile and tells her he quite appreciates her help.
“Harry,” Neville greets quietly as he steps closer to Harry, Quinn and Higgins.
He lets out a small huff of annoyance; as if it hadn’t been enough that he went and fell for one of the mindless girls that only seek his company because of his looks, but then James had to cock things up even further.
Regarding the questioning the next day, Albus thinks Rose will be all right, that it’ll go smoothly. He doesn’t really worry for her, as much as he does for his best friend. Albus can’t stop thinking that something’s not right with Scorpius. Albus – well, Albus thinks Scorpius might know more about Travers’s death than he has let on.
And that itself is enough to tell Albus that something is bothering his friend. Based on his past experiences, Albus has proved to be rather good at reading Scorpius. He knows there’s something Scorpius is not telling, but he reckons that his friend will talk to him about it eventually.
“As Albus had dated the girl previously, he presumed she knew some of his ‘secrets’. However, he told us he hadn’t been worried about the threat.”
Harry wonders, if Lily knows too.
There are moments Draco wishes he could take back – moments he thinks he should apologise for. But then again, Potter never really apologised for trying to kill him during their sixth year. What Potter
Harry feels relieved, but at the same time, he’s burdened by the past days’ events. The case is solved. A young girl, as young as his own children are, has passed away, and Harry knows exactly how easily it could’ve been prevented. He thinks of the girl, wondering if she had known how the potions were going to affect her. If she had intended it to happen. If she had wanted end her life.
“McGonagall has contacted the girl’s parents; they will likely be at the school soon. She will keep everyone in the Great Hall for now, until your people arrive, and start the investigation.” Hermione says, looking exhausted, trailing a hand over her now unruly hair.
Potter looks away, a strained look on his face. “That paradise has ceased to exist over two years ago,” he says very quietly.
There is a long moment of silence, as Harry watches the people gathered in the hall, a sombre look on his face.
And why did Potter tell this to Draco? They are not friends, not at least on Draco’s half. Why would Potter open up about his personal life to Draco?
Hermione tells Harry that they need him for the statement, and then says her goodbyes to Draco, telling him that she will be expecting a full report on her desk next morning. Draco merely nods at her.
“Bloody tosspot,” Malfoy grunts, already making his way back to the compartment.
Albus rolls his eyes. “This is ridiculous. I mean, yeah, both Scor and I saw her, but we don’t have anything to do with what happened to her,” he says, feeling exasperated.
Albus scoffs, inwardly cursing James, for getting him into this mess. “First of all, it was my
“Oh, yes!
There’s a frustrated groan. “Untwist your knickers, Quinn, it’s only me!” Ron yells and a second later, he lights up his wand.
Harry exchanges a look with Ginny, and briefly thinks that he hasn’t seen her as fragile and concerned after – after the war, and for a small moment he wants to pull her into a warm embrace, to give her strength and comfort. But the moment passes, and instead, Harry focuses on Quinn, who starts to speak.
“The head injury didn’t instantly kill her?” Potter asks with a deep frown.
Harry gives her a nod, “A good idea. Ron could perhaps keep an eye out in Hogsmeade until we get there.” He then pauses as he remembers Ginny. “Ginny. I need to inform her,” Harry says, desperately trying to keep his thoughts together.
Albus frowns at his friend’s back while he hears his mum grumble something under her breath about ‘even his son not getting along with him’. He then sees his father, talking to who must be the Scott sisters’ parents, since Westen’s parents haven’t yet arrived. Albus sees his father sending a worried look at their direction, before gesturing Hazel Scott and her parents to the classroom.
Draco gives him a nod. “I’d say she was barely conscious after the head injury.”
“Auror Parkinson will be stationed in the common room for the night,” he adds, and sees several girls looking calmer and more collected.
Albus does the eye-thing again with Rose at the Ravenclaw table; who has evidently done a similar check-up with her own house table as she gives Albus a worried shake of her head. There’s something Albus cannot identify in her expression. She seems…more than worried. Terrified, even. He knows Rose is not easily shocked. Albus has an uncomfortable thought that perhaps Rose…knows who it is.
“Hi, Mr Malfoy,” Albus says politely, nodding at the man who in appearance is almost as much alike with his son, as Albus is with his father.
Harry gives Malfoy a tight-lipped smile. He knows about that too, and remembers feeling that for once, being what he is, had been a good thing for someone. Had helped someone.
Draco lifts his brows at Potter.
Hermione swallows hard, nodding a couple of times. “Yes…yes, I’m…I know,” she says weakly, before taking in a deep breath, and standing straighter, pulling up the ‘Head of the DMLE’ look on her face. “I hope you do find out what happened. The press is going wild, now that some of the parents have talked,” she says with a tired voice, pinching the bridge of her nose. “It will get worse when the parents start arriving here, trying to pull their kids out of the school,” She continues, before whispering, “And if they find out that
“What is this?” Ginny hisses, giving Harry a disbelieving look.
Harry gives Albus an incredulous look. “Are you lying, Albus?” Harry asks, feeling shocked and confused.
“No spells were found, no traces of any other magical signatures, but her own.”
“Rose confirmed – under Veritaserum – that as she had left Travers’s compartment, Travers had been alive and well, and that there had not been anything out of ordinary in her behaviour. She also told us, that she had not seen anyone as she had left Travers’s compartment, on her way back to her own.”
“Yes.”
James chuckles. “Should’ve known…” He mutters, and Albus practically trembles with rage.
“Something’s not right,” Cory whispers, a deep frown between his brows. “They’re staying put,” he continues, still watching the group of teachers with the three students close to the Entrance Hall.
“Miss Travers’s death was both an unfortunate accident and the result of a careless use of sedative potions,” Harry continues, his voice now sharper, making everyone fall silent once more. “She fell, unable to control her body after taking three vials of Calming Draught, and hit her head to the edge of the bench in her compartment. The blow to the head caused a massive blood loss and a traumatic brain injury. Had someone been there with her – as Miss Travers had been barely conscious after she fell and incapable of summoning help – we wouldn’t be here today.” Harry speaks solemnly.
Albus frowns at the Hufflepuffs, before turning towards his friend. “What do you think, mate?” Albus mutters and nudges Scorpius, evidently pulling him from his thoughts.
What was that about? What did Scorpius say in there?
Yes, Harry is aware of the fact that Draco and Scorpius look alike – quite like Albus and Harry do – but Scorpius is different from his father; he is, usually at least, carefree, smiling, polite, and open-minded. Whereas Draco…is not. Or was not. Harry couldn’t really say, as he hasn’t spoken with the man for a long time.
“Okay. That’s all for now.” Harry says after a short moment. “Auror Quinn will take you back to your common room.”
lied to me! They went behind my back! Can’t that be enough, dad?!” He yells, storming away from the room.
“I’m sorry, Al,” his father mutters, kissing the top of Albus’s head.
When Harry doesn’t reply to him, Moonstone lifts his head up, and evidently sees the look of uncertainty passing over Harry’s features. “Harry?”
Ginny lets out a scoff. “Then how would the girl have known?!” She hisses, her eyes blazing. “How would
“Were you in your room, with Scorpius?” Quinn continues.
, and they tell each other everything – at least, Albus had thought they did! And…and the fact that Scorpius would go for his
