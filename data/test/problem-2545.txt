Potter didn’t say anything but he nodded seriously.
He didn’t know what Harry wanted from life, frankly he had no idea how the man was still single, he was definitely a catch. Did Harry even want a boyfriend? Would he only be after something casual or did he want to settle down properly? What were his views on marriage and children? Draco didn’t know the answers but he would find out what Harry wanted and he would make sure to be the one who made him happy.
“Erm, well, look I definitely don’t want to overshadow Ron, this is his night for news, but I guess you’ll all find out soon enough anyway that I, er, actually quit today.” Arthur, Molly, Bill and Charlie all looked at Harry in surprise. “And before you make a joke-” Harry gave Fred and George a bit of a cheeky look next to him in order to hopefully break some of the tension at his news. “-I didn’t quit because of Ron being my boss!”
“Hmm, well I suppose I can’t say no to that and I have always thought you should just live your life the way you want to live it and forget what the press say.” Fred said, seemingly less suspicious now.
Harry relaxed and grinned again. “Good. I will then.” Was all he said.
“Harry…?” Draco asked over Harry’s thoughts.
“Always? You mean he had it at school?” Blaise said, frowning.
“How do you know?” He asked her suspiciously.
“Well Friday is market day in town over on the main island.” Draco said happily. “I usually go if I happen to have the day off. If not sometimes Mattie gets some stuff for me and drops it round. Shopping is always fun and we could do with some more food anyway. Some of the locals have little stalls selling things they’ve made. JP’s sister has one with jewellery, I’ve got some of her bracelets and necklaces actually.”
Harry got there first though stretching out his right hand and summoning the second plate. It came flying towards him effortlessly at the perfect speed and he managed to set it down on the table in front of him in a very controlled manner.
“You like him.” Hermione stated, it wasn’t a question.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Something like that….” Harry mumbled in annoyance. Then he sat up straighter and told Draco the full story of Miss Violet. Draco hated her already, she sounded extremely annoying. “...anyway, it all kicked off after you left this morning.” Harry finished off.
Draco took another breath and moved his hand over Harry’s still as he looked into his eyes.  “I actually realised it about a month ago. It’s sandalwood which they do use in a lot of broom polishes and yes I also put it in your aftershave as now it’s a smell I always associate with you.”
“If you read The Prophet next week you’ll understand.” Potter said cryptically.
George was nodding. “Yeah that works and I think he’ll go for it. I know him the best if you want me to run it by him first?”
Thanks again to the reader who requested a Draco getting jealous of Harry moment, included here for you, hope you liked it!
“Well what more do you expect?” Draco said dramatically. “You don't have the natural instincts of a potioneer and you lack creativity but you’re right you can follow instructions well which explains why you were able to follow Severus’ instructions in that book but still doesn’t explain why you were such a suck up to Slughorn.”
Draco followed Harry up the stairs into the twins flat. Despite all the times he’d been in the building for business meetings it felt wrong to be up here in their home. If he wasn’t careful he’d end up being friends with the twins… or maybe they already were.
Draco frowned at him. “I don’t accept charity.”
“What makes you say that?” George asked with his mouth half full.
Harry smiled and dived head first into the waves, swimming out strongly to meet him. They swam for as long as they wanted to. Harry didn’t know how long they spent out in the sea but it didn’t matter. Time just felt irrelevant out here. They swam properly sometimes as a form of exercise, other times they stopped and were a bit playful splashing each other and diving under the water. Biscuit swum alongside them for the most part but they never got too deep for him and he would swim back easily to the beach to walk around there for a bit when he wanted.
Malfoy then put his pineapple back down again to explain fully. “Yes, all the heads of the different sections complete managerial and emergency protocols training. We take turns to be duty manager and whoever is DM is technically responsible for the overall running of the hotel for that day. They respond to emergencies and make the final call on anything that crops up but the GM, the general manager, is usually still around if shit really does hit the fan. Then there is the owner above him but he’s not around as much.”
Harry spent some time petting Gandalf affectionately before Draco used him to send the biggest order off. It was nice to see Harry was clearly taken with the owl, Draco had never felt the joy of giving so much as to when he’d given Harry that present and it was nice to think Harry had something that he’d given him. Hopefully it would always remind Harry of him but Draco wished for more gift giving opportunities in the future, even if the owl had been more expensive than he’d budgeted for and he now had even less of his personal money.
Teddy played until Dromeda came home and was in such a happy mood that she didn’t question anything and he didn’t tell her anything but Harry told her quietly that he needed to talk to her after dinner once Teddy had gone to bed.
His eyes wandered to the gift basket sitting on his desk ready wrapped in his signature black and gold colours. It had been a little tight to get it done in time but he’d stayed up late last night to finish it as he didn’t want it hanging over his head today. Draco was pleased with the products though and certainly hoped Potter would be. There was a whole range of haircare and bath products  all using slightly different blends of peppermint, green tea, freshly cut grass, scents of parchment and forest floor and eucalyptus which wasn’t something he’d discussed with Potter but he felt it went well with the other scents.
“And the worst thing is that I know now how much he needs help but there’s no way in hell he’ll let me help him.” Harry continued sadly. “I figured stuff was still a bit messed up with his parents back at the Manor but I just thought he’d cut them out of his life and was doing OK now. I mean the shop looks amazing and expensive, I thought he must still have money… and I knew he was getting a bit skinny but I just thought he was working too hard and skipping meals, I’ve been there you know, with the aurors, I didn’t realise that he couldn’t feed himself…”
Potter looked at him a bit quizzically as if trying to work him out for a few moments which made Draco slightly uneasy. “OK then, well if you can then great but don’t worry too much if you can’t... And, erm… I-.” Potter took a deep breath and seemed to be considering his next words carefully.
“I-I… I don’t know what to say.” Harry said, still in awe, still seemingly lost for words.
“She’s in there still?” Draco said quietly to Daphne as he took the familiar wand from her and ran his fingers over it.
He’d spent the last two years perfecting his products and selling them to private clients by owl mail order. It had taken a while to build up a client base but Blaise and Daphne had helped a lot buying them and gifting them to everyone they knew telling them where they got them from. Draco had actually managed to make some really good potions and cosmetics so his customers were impressed and kept coming back for more as well as recommending him to their friends. He’d actually build up a really good small business and it was proving quite lucrative so he’d managed to add to his savings.
“Yes Hopsy it’s just a standard Tuesday dinner remember? I said nothing special.” Draco gave a gentle warning look to the house elf.
It’s not that he didn’t like Ginny, he loved her of course he did, he
He sighed. “I dunno really… I guess at first this house had bad memories for all of us, not just me and like I said earlier, it wasn’t a nice house to be in so I didn’t think anyone would want to come. Then I just got used to one of the other Weasleys always hosting. It was just natural that we’d all end up back at The Burrow and it was how Molly liked it. I also liked going to the twins or Hermione’s flat, then their house when they got married… we also had things at Bill and Fleur’s sometimes, particularly in the summer, it’s beautiful there on the beach…”
Also, it was a hard chapter to write. I've definitely realised that as a writer I'm not very good at the heavy, angsty stuff... mild crisis of confidence again with this chapter but I'm persevering with it and hopefully it still reads OK... :/
“Oh and Potter?” Draco called after him slightly. “Try to look half decent, people actually know me here.”
Teddy jumped up from his chair very excitedly and announced that he was going to let Draco in. Harry could hear Teddy’s excited squeal that confirmed it was indeed Draco at the door and the young boy announced loudly, as the footsteps got closer, that he’d saved Draco a seat at the table next to him.
He felt slightly bad as he got the impression that Harry was a bit worried about having him over but he honestly didn’t know where else they could meet safely. He didn’t particularly want to use the office that he kept for business meetings but he supposed he probably should have offered instead of inviting himself over. Oh well it was done now and he’d be lying if he said he wasn’t intrigued about visiting Harry at his home.
“-it’s just another coping mechanism and frankly we don’t blame you knowing what’s happened in your head in the past-” Fred chimed in.
Harry looked up in surprise and gave him a quizzical look.
He waited more and paced around the flat anxiously whilst looking out the window every thirty seconds for any sign of change. An hour later there was still no sign of movement and the shop was still closed.
“Er, same please.” Harry said as Blaise hoovered the bottles over to him and then finally he poured himself a glass of red too.
“Hey.” He said casually.
Draco laughed. “Oh, come on, I’m sorry but that was one of my highlights of that year, it’s sad now to know it wasn’t true.”
“He said that?” Ron said sceptically and looked half pleased, half disbelieving which was an amusing combination.
Watching Harry in his home just doing normal everyday things had felt so special to Draco, especially since he found out that Harry never had anyone over. It was like he’d been invited into an exclusive part of the man’s life. Even in the less intense moments where they’d just been drinking or eating either talking or not talking, it had all just felt so right, so normal, so… perfect.
“You’ll let me ask anything I want?” Draco repeated with a sceptical look.
“Well you’d better not be having ideas about Fred or George, they’re not my type.” He said assertively.
“I’m not making any promises, but I’ll take another look at the rooms for you. We do have one that’s empty but it’s because it needs repairs. I might be able to get the maintenance crew in tomorrow.” Draco said non-committedly.
“Relax, it's still a good look. The shirt is excellent and the boots too, I just feel like it would look better with grey jeans than blue jeans that’s all.” Balise said in a considered flat one as he often spoke.
He wasn’t really thinking of it as a biography, although it followed the events of his life he didn’t want it to be about him at all. He wanted it to be about all the other heroes who helped ‘The Hero’ as the world called him. Fourth year was hard too as he realised that he was probably going to have to ask Mr and Mrs Diggory if he was going to talk about Cedric’s death and the graveyard. Sighing, he put them on the list. Writing about fifth year would be awful, that was one of Harry’s worst years of his life but it would give him an opportunity to write about how corrupt the Ministry was then and how much it’s turned around. Although he had his personal misgivings about how he was treated at the Ministry even now, he was Kingsley’s man through and through and he did know how hard they’d all worked to reform the wizarding government. It wasn’t perfect but it was miles better than it used to be and he had a lot of friends who worked there who he would never betray.
“Fine.” Harry said, starting to back out of the room.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy if you walk out that door right now you can consider yourself disinherited. You will get nothing more from us and you will not be fit to carry the Malfoy name.” His father said, taking a threatening step closer to his son.
They’d spoken about Harry’s new project at length on Monday when Harry had visited the Ministry. He’d only gone to give an official statement about his leaving, (which had already been written for him by the time he’d got there but he’d gone along with it) but he’d ended up staying most of the day. Kingsley was completely supportive about the book and although he agreed there was some sensitive information that shouldn’t be released to the public, he was confident they could get round it together. Harry agreed that Kingley could read any first draughts that came along to review but other than that Kingsley said he trusted Harry to progress with it as he saw fit.
“No chance Forge, I’m getting there first today!”
Draco did indeed recognise the vial as one of his own when he finally managed to concentrate on it long enough and he distinct smell of chamomile was hitting his nostrils already making him feel calmer. He found the strength in his hand to raise it to his mouth and pour in a couple of drops. That would be enough. Harry’s other hand had returned to his back as he perched on the side of the armchair.
“So did you sort out Hermione’s present?” Fred asked Harry casually.
Draco was now holding a teacup but was still frowning at Harry’s bandaged hand and obviously wasn’t going to let it go. “Tell me what happened.” He demanded using a voice that was both stern and gentle if such things were possible.
Draco frowned, how annoying it was that she had planned this out. She really was determined for Potter to be around more and it simply wouldn’t do. She could be friends with the man in her own time if she insisted, Draco was already dreading the wedding anyway. Of course Lucius and his mother weren’t invited, no one ever invited the Malfoys anymore but there was a chance he could find out where the wedding was and try to sneak in. Daphne had insisted that her family wanted Draco there but he wasn’t sure if he believed her and really wasn’t convinced that going out to a large gathering was wise even if he wanted to go, which he didn’t really.
“Y-yes”
Once again George seemed to read his mind. “I’m sure you can see him later Harry. He still wants to be your friend and he’s determined that things won’t be awkward between you. He'd hate that.”
“Probably nothing.” Draco agreed hoping that he was just being stupid. “Still, let’s just get these sent and go.”
“Who?” Fred seemed to be feigning ignorance and Harry didn’t understand why he seemed reluctant to talk about him.
“Wow.” Draco said, sounding slightly breathless again but also a bit tired.
Just then Kreacher popped into the hallway and did the most formal low bow that Draco had ever seen him do. He was even wearing a brand new crisp clean white rag instead of the dirty one he usually wore and he had a small navy necktie on too, clearly trying to make an impression. Draco knew from Harry that Kreacher had been given clothes but he just refused to wear them.
“I’ve fucked it up haven’t I?” Harry said quietly. “Draco’s right, why did I have to be so God damn nosy.”
Draco’s lip curled upwards slightly and he decided to have some fun if Harry seemed OK with it.
“We would be happy to receive your recommendations Chef Boucher.” Daphne said to the chef with a dashing smile. “I take it that each course comes with a wine pairing too?” She asked confidently.
Harry frowned at her. “Why not?! That’s not fair. I told you all about your potential future husband!”
“-we couldn’t exactly all fit on the doorstep.” The twins said.
“But you can’t relax in your own home, that’s not fair.” Draco countered.
As always I'd really love to know your thoughts. I get so happy and excited by comments in my inbox and I always reply to every one so hit me!
Ron shrugged. “We figured we’d give you the time you needed but we knew if something came up you’d be there, it’s just who you are… but erm, you- you know you can always say no right?” He added with a bit of uncertainty.
“I am afraid Pierre is a very busy man and cannot be disturbed during his brewing process. However I can make an appointment for you to meet him and discuss your order tomorrow if that is suitable for you?” She said opening a black leather diary on the counter and picking up a glamorous gold feather quill.
“I erm, talked to Fred.” He said quietly.
“Morning Potter.” Draco’s familiar tone came singing cheerfully into the room.
“Is that where father is?” He asked Leo directly, seeing as no one had actually confirmed it.
“Hmm, you should speak french more often.” Harry said approvingly. “It’s weird to see you as Pierre again.” He added looking at Draco strangely.
Draco mentioned he was hoping with Graham brewing at least one day for him in the lab at the shop that he could still have Sundays off but that would depend on Graham’s skill level and how much Draco could delegate to him. Overall Harry agreed that it was a good plan and apparently Daphne was pleased with it. She liked Graham enough from what she knew of him at school and their brief meeting today to welcome him onto the team. Harry could tell Draco seemed much more relaxed tonight and remembered what he said before about needing structure in his life. This was good, things were all working out.
“For years I told myself that I didn’t want to know so it didn’t matter and then when I met you again and we talked about doing the book I thought it would be healthy to slowly unravel everything again and make sense of it all piece by piece. I had imagined there would be memories that I had repressed but I never knew I had the answers in my head all along. I never realised how much I’d witnessed but shoved aside in a mental box somewhere to be forgotten. How could I not remember a massive whole interaction like that?” He questioned as if it scared him.
Then Draco was stalking him like prey, walking towards him with a hungry look in his eye that made Harry forget to breathe. As he got close to Harry he lightly trailed his fingers up Harry’s bare right arm pausing over the two faint puncture wounds.
The last thing he needed was for Potter to think he was too poor to feed himself or that he didn’t really know how, it was a bloody embarrassment. Secretly though he was pleased at his bigger portion and he knew Daphne was only doing it because she cared. It was true, he had lost weight but he was healthy enough still, he made sure to tailor the sustenance potions to his exact needs so he could get all the right vitamins and minerals.
“Oh, er, good.” Harry said before gathering himself and remembering why he came. “He’s actually the reason why I asked you to dinner.” He said casually, taking a sip of his dessert wine. It was a bit too sweet for him but it was alcohol so he drank it anyway.
Draco snorted to confirm that he did. Narcissa chose to ignore it.
“Yeah sure, I’d like that.” Harry replied. “You want me to come with you anyway don’t you boy? Yeah, I’m your favourite cos I give you more affection than the grumpy Slytherin. You stick with me.” He said giving Biscuit lots of kisses and cuddles.
Harry was a bit surprised and frowned at him slightly. “
Blaise was the third man to throw his arms around Daphne in as many minutes but George didn’t seem to mind as Fred clapped him on the back looking just as relieved as everyone else to see Daphne unharmed.
Harry stood up just as George was about to walk away. “I think it’s time I go back actually.”
When they reached Draco he smiled. “You got chocolate eclairs?” He asked.
“I thought Daphne was your best friend.” Draco said simply. He knew really that Blaise and Daphne loved him but the two of them had been best friends for a lot longer than they’d been friends with him and sometimes he still felt slightly on the outside.
In his confusion he thought he had imagined the voices that came. “Draco, Draco, where are you?” “Draco, son?” “Oh, Draco, we found you, finally.” They had embraced like they had never done before and Draco had forced his feet to follow them back to The Great Hall following his mother’s voice as if in a trance. “Come, Draco, come, it’s ok, come and see.”
Fred sat up abruptly. “No! I’m not, I’m really not!” He said quickly.
Harry grinned. “We broke into the Ministry during the war and stole a necklace right from Umbridge’s neck in the middle of her conducting a trial.”
“Daphne, shall we?” George gestured to the seats in front of them.
Draco had never heard his mother stutter in his life.
Two more flights of stairs and he was standing outside his old bedroom. Was it really only two days ago that he’d moved out of here? It seemed like a lot more than that, so much had happened. Then again he felt like he’d been with Harry for years not weeks. He knocked on the door.
“You were going to run the shop?” For me?” Draco said slowly.
“Well I can tell you want to ask me something. You came here to discuss the book right? So... hit me with it I guess.” Harry said casually trying to pretend the conversation wasn’t as deep as he thought it was about to be.
“You mean he was disappointed to not see Pierre.” He said bitterly.
“Ok.” Harry said simply sitting up and gathering his confidence. “Well I know that Pierre is Draco and I actually need to talk to him about something really important but I don’t know how to approach him. I honestly don’t want to cause any trouble for him, I completely respect his desire for privacy and I can see how much his business means to him. I just want to talk to him but I don’t want him to freak out about the fact that I know where to find him.”
Upon entering the room he smiled at the familiar peaceful light atmosphere in the room, only now it smelt like his mother. It was a bright floral feminine smell of jasmine, freesia and rose but it was slightly too sweet and the scent was not quite clean enough for Draco’s taste.
Williamson cleared his throat and then spoke in a rather official Ministry sounding voice.
“So I think we need to take care of you now.” Blaise said kindly but stubbornly. “You sure you’re OK to close the shop for a day? We could always ask one of the Weasley twins if they have a spare staff member?”
“Of course I did.” Draco said in a bit of a sulky way. “It’s all I’ve ever wanted really, I tried to impress you when I first met you. I just didn’t know that those things wouldn’t be impressive to you.”
She took another sip as Harry continued to eat. Seafood wasn’t really something he ever ate and it wasn’t his favorite but it was nice. Luckily he wasn’t a fussy eater.
“Can I ask you something?” He said frowning.
Sometimes he used to just grab a coffee and a pastry at a coffee shop by the ministry and shove it in whilst walking. Sometimes Kreacher would pack him something and he’d have it at his desk. Sometimes he would have breakfast at the flat with the twins but now he had much more of a routine and he liked it.
Draco looked at Harry seriously. “No, please don’t. I know it’s stupid but I know in my gut that it’s Mother and I just don’t want to call the aurors until I know more about the situation. Mother won’t do anything rash, she has probably been planning this and waiting for the right time to slip past Lucius. I say we just wait for them to finish talking. Mother will release the locks when she’s ready and then Daphne will tell us what’s going on.”
Harry was starting to get a bit of a routine now that he was enjoying being a man of leisure. If it was up to him he’d probably just make last minute plans with people but others needed to have a routine and had other things going on in their life. He’d agreed with Dromeda and Teddy’s school that he would pick him up every Wednesday from now on and it was great to know he’d have some more time with his godson. Dromeda, as it turned out as more than happy to share some of the parenting responsibilities.
“But you must see that I can’t stay here now Daphne.” Draco said flatly, defeated.
“Thanks, I will, I promise.” Harry said sincerely.
“Yes.” Potter said simply but when Draco frowned and went to interrupt Potter held up his hand to silence him. “I’ve come this far and I’ve made up my mind now that it’s what I want, what I need… but I was never going to name anyone without their permission. I’ve spoken to everyone else and they’ve all agreed you were the last person on the list.”
“Yes well I’d better get a shag out of it.” Blaise said as if he was annoyed with the idea of taking Fred but he was still smiling.
It was around half nine at this point so the shop was already open but the door to it was closed so Draco thought it would be safe for him to come out from under the cloak. Afterall, it was highly unlikely that Lucius or his mother would be shopping in the Weasleys joke shop.
She wasn’t wrong though. Something did need to be done about him.
“So it’s true then?” She asked, looking at him curiously.
“I- I… thank you.” Draco said as he couldn’t decide what else to say. “And since that day?” He prompted.
He paused and then started another angle. “You remember that first serious conversation we had about three years ago?” He asked Fred with a fond smile.
“So you’re not interested then?” Blaise questioned which Draco was very grateful for.
It was only then as he looked at Harry’s face but the anger in him was still bubbling up and Harry’s expression did nothing to stop this at the time.
It was around four o’clock when Harry knocked on Draco’s office door again.
Daphne raised his eyebrows at him. “I didn’t mean it like that, I’m not some stupid fan girl Draco give me more credit than that.” She paused and then carried on in a more serious tone. “I meant I like him, he’s different now, not like I remember him being at school at all. He knew about the shop because he was at the Weasley shop and he saw it out the window, I guess they’re good friends. He honestly was complimentary and she said he wanted a bespoke gift basket. I think he was genuine.”
Ahhh!! :D
Hermione smiled properly at him this time and he met her eyes cautiously.
Keep them coming!
He was suddenly worried that they were setting him up with one of the Weasley twins. Blaise had mentioned rumours about one of them so maybe one or both of them weren’t completely straight. That was never going to work though, they were too tall, too pale and too red-headed for his liking.
“So, erm, you alright mate? You kinda disappeared on me today.” He said looking a bit awkwardly at Harry.
It was also the first time Harry had seen him in short sleeves and it showed off his arms and shoulders nicely which were quite muscular for someone of his slim frame. He could also see the whole of the leather holster on Draco’s forearm although the wand from it was clearly in Draco’s right hand down by his side. He wondered whether it was more practical to have the holster on for him all the time or whether he kept it on to cover up what was underneath.
Draco nodded. “The bath was heavenly actually, I haven’t had one since I left the Manor and it was exactly what I needed. Thank you.”
Blaise was the one to reply this time. “Ah the mystery cloak. Of course.”
Draco looked like he appreciated the comment but didn’t respond. Well he did always like flattery, Harry thought to himself, although he was slightly annoyed about the fact that he was making much more of an effort with this ‘new friendship’ than Draco was.
He knew that Draco had come on leaps and bounds but sometimes he forgot how insecure Draco could still be and he would have to try harder to see things from his point of view too.
“Yes that is true.” Draco said in an arrogant way but Harry knew he was only joking around.
Thursday during the day he’d helped George out in the shop as Fred was covering for Lee at their Hogsmeade branch and Verity had called in sick. It was unusual to spend proper time together with George without Fred but it was nice. Hermione had actually only gone back to work four days to start with and she said she would go full time after Rose’s first birthday so Harry spent a rare full day with her on Friday. He was still there when Ron got back home and ended up staying for dinner as he hadn’t seen Ron since Monday evening and his best friend had lots of stories to share about how he was transitioning into his new role.
“Coffee!” Harry said suddenly and then cleared his throat looking slightly embarrassed. “Er, sorry, erm, I meant would you like coffee or tea or anything?”
“I want you.” He moaned into Harry’s ear as he started rubbing his hands all over Harry and leaning in to kiss his neck, desperate for him.
Ron grinned at him and clapped him on the shoulder. “I knew it, I had a bet on with Williamson. He’s going to be pissed to lose the money but he’ll still be happy about it. Shacklebolt knew this would happen. He never took you off the books you know. You’re still employed as a… what did he call it- a ‘freelance consultant with field auror privileges’.”
Draco had gone upstairs too to vanish everything in sight after the way he’d left the flat and now it was a completely blank canvas for them to make it into a proper flat for Graham. If he accepted it of course. Draco went back to Grimmauld Place and started making the potions lab and then empty office space Harry had given him his own. After that he got to work making the orders that had come in from his meetings yesterday. It felt so good to be brewing and creating again in a safe space where he knew Lucius would never find him. He was good at what he did, he enjoyed it and his customers loved his creations. Lucius could never take this away from him.
That made Harry laugh and he was once again taken back by how smart and how observant Teddy was. He picked up on everything that anyone said and always remembered it. He was looking forward to telling Draco Teddy’s reasoning how he could feel free to laugh and joke about the two of them having a baby after finally being secure that Draco wanted it as much as he did one day.
Daphne came in through the back of the shop that morning in a good mood like she always did. Draco was hoovering in his office but had the door open just looking over the diary again and double checking the week ahead. He wordlessly handed her the diary so she could take it back to the counter for the day.
“So how was your day with Hermione?” Fred asked Harry.
Harry shrugged. “Maybe I should start trying to lead more of a normal life now if I’m going to be embracing my publicity for this book.” He said.
“Ah, yes that’s a good one. You’ll like it.” Potter said.
“The man in the bookstore that slipped Ginerva the diary was Lucius right?” He said with a sad tone.
Draco then slowly moved his arms from around Harry so that he was no longer touching him but he didn’t shrug off Harry’s arm that was still around his shoulder and didn’t seem physically uncomfortable so Harry didn’t move.
“How did you mend yours and why did mine work so well for you?” Draco asked.
“You said it earlier, I’ve always shown my emotions and that is true in my magic as well, the two are very strongly linked I guess.” Harry started. “I’ve always had anger issues, I don’t need to tell you that… I had periods where I felt like my anger was right at the surface and I was just about keeping it away but it was ready to bubble up at any moment… you always knew how to drew it out of me… fifth year was pretty bad I was pretty angsty.”
Draco was extremely happy with his new clothes and it was nice to see his large wardrobe in his room and the chest of drawers actually completely full. If he was honest he could do with more space in the wardrobe, his dress robes didn’t quite hang properly in there. Never mind, it was a good problem to have really and he couldn’t find it in him to care at this moment.

Draco raised his eyebrows at him. “Hmm let’s see, bigger bed, dressing room, better shower, more storage, one less flight of stairs to climb, the real question is why aren’t we in that room already?”
She looked at him curiously for a moment before asking something which he did not expect. “Has Harry told you that he loves you?”
“Of course, I put your favourite table aside when I saw your booking. This way.” She said finally looking over in Draco and Blaise’s direction. She smiled at them satisfyingly, probably because it didn’t look like Harry was on a date, Draco thought, and then led them to a rectangular table right in the far left corner.
Harry cleared his throat slightly. “Well, I erm, well you know I don’t like sleeping alone and I, er, I just always thought I’d only move into that room… you know, if I ever found someone to be with properly, here at home, if I was happy enough in a relationship to ask someone to move in with me.”
“Good.” Was Draco’s reply
“Whatever you say then boss. I just don’t think it would kill you to swallow your pride and ask for help once in a while.” Daphne said, waving one hand dramatically. “And he’s hardly my boyfriend Draco. We’ve had one official date.”
“So Draco,'' Proudfoot has always called him Draco as it was easier than constantly clarifying which Mr. Malfoy he was talking to. “I saw you looking in the greenhouse today. Do you like Herbology?”
Daphne summoned a fourth glass and poured the rest of the bottle into it before it floated over to Harry. She then moved into the centre of the room in an effortlessly commanding way.
“Oh Draco, you two are really rather good together and it’s so obvious how much he cares.” Daphne said softly. “I think you’ve made him very happy.”
“Hit me with it, be brutal it’s fine.” He replied knowing that she would be.
Defensive magic wasn’t his best but he hated the idea of using offensive magic now. It reminded him of what he’d had to do during the war and the person that he’d been before. He wasn’t that person now. He promised himself he would never attack anyone ever again verbally or otherwise but he would still defend himself and others if he was forced to. Hopefully they could still leave with the trunks without having to cast a spell but that was looking unlikely now.
“At this point anything alcoholic would be welcome!” Harry laughed honestly and the others in the room smiled at that.
“It would be better in the long run too.” Harry said hoping again he wasn’t overstepping but wanting to try and persuade them that this really was the best option. He wanted justice for Draco and Lucius deserved to be locked up. “He will be secured as a criminal not just as a patient. Either he’ll be a permanent resident of St. Mungos or if he gets better then he will be arrested and tried for his crimes instead of just released from hospital care. Also if he is a criminal then it would help your divorce case immensely, he wouldn’t have any rights so you could probably get your inheritance back Draco, if you wanted it.”
“No I wouldn’t” Blaise agreed with a soft laugh. “But someone else might and if you leave it too long then you’ll end up in the friend/housemate zone permanently so just do it.”
Just then the elevator in the reception area chimed and the doors started to open. Draco had already reacted though dragging Potter through the open doorway onto the white stone path outside. Potter was protesting loudly but following along away. Draco let him go once they were outside and there were no guests around. It was still early and the pool and beach area wasn’t open yet.
“Course, thanks.” Harry said simply. “You can wait in the kitchen when you get back, help yourself to anything in there and Kreacher is around if you need anything. You know the drill.”
Harry nodded slowly. “Yeah I did but it took me a while not really sure why though. Everyone was totally fine about it of course and I’ve never experienced any negativity about being gay. The press have speculated and even asked me outright but always in an inquisitive way not in a derogatory way. I always tell them that anything about my private life is none of their business anyway. I’ve always been very careful to never deny it and I’ve always made a big deal about supporting gay rights. Me, Fred and George went to London Pride a few times and George took loads of photos and sent them into the Prophet, it was great! I always encouraged the rumours because I’d like to think that if I ever settled down with a guy then it wouldn’t be a big shock to the wizarding community or anything but I just haven’t really confirmed it either as I know they’d run a stupid ‘Harry Potter comes out’ article which I’d hate.”
“Just get them some more cloaks from Fred and George and have them apparate here under them and it will be fine. I can floo call them and give them the address. Having them know it as part of the fidelius charm won’t make the house any less secure, they still won’t actually be able to speak the location even if Lucius does somehow find out they visited.” Harry continued explaining.
Also, please check out my other stories if you haven't already. The next one to update will be The Desired.
“Sure.” Potter said with a more confident voice. “That sounds nice.”
Kreacher was indeed happy to see him when he arrived back at Grimmauld place. He was fusing around him taking his coat and making him feel welcome. His house elf was old now so it was good that Harry wasn’t here all the time, Kreacher had plenty of time to himself and definitely didn’t work everyday but he kept the house clean no matter what and did seem to enjoy having a master to look after when Harry was around. Hearing that Harry was staying tonight and would need dinner he immediately wandered off to freshen the sheets on Harry’s bed muttering about what he’d cook this evening. Harry had tried to tell Kreacher after the war that he could work at Grimmauld as a free elf but Kreacher had been so confused and upset by the whole idea that Harry had given up. Instead he just always made sure that Kreacher was treated well and he never gave him a direct order he just nicely asked him to do things.
“Merlin no, definitely not.” Harry replied looking mildly horrified. “Talking of clothes, shouldn’t you get in some?”
Harry flirted back. “Well we can always try again and see if we can do better.”
“Sure.” He said slowly.
“What the-” Draco started furiously turning so sharply towards Daphne that the rest of the tea in his cup went all over the middle of the sofa. A bit of the hot liquid caught his hand too and then he dropped the cup on the floor where it smashed.
“What if we’re both wrong?!” Harry asked, smiling. “What if the Harpies lose the game and the cup?!”
“Mr Malfoy” back to his professional tone “Do you disagree with anything that has been said so far or are these statements correct?”
Harry nodded his exhaustion coming over him and feeling slightly tipsy all of a sudden as he finished his dessert wine unable to find his words.
Draco suspected that the real reason was that she was still avoiding the dining room but as he had no desire to visit it either he thought the subject was best left alone for the moment.
Harry laughed properly at that. “You know, I used to hate coming home before, it always felt so empty and quiet compared to wherever I’d been before but now wherever I am I always just think about how I can’t wait to come home.” He took a step towards Draco as he said this and slid his hands up over the taller man's shoulders, then interlocked his fingers behind Draco’s slender neck.
The words came out of his mouth automatically but he noticed Draco sharply withdrawing his hand and turning away from him.
There was his signature jet black hair which was always ridiculously messy but this style... looked good. It was shorter at the sides and back than Draco remembered but still wavy all over and long and tousled softly on top just coming down across the right side of his forehead to cover his famous scar. It was still sticking out in all sorts of places but it looked gloriously windswept rather than scruffy. Underneath Draco could see those familiar emerald green eyes shining brightly beneath a pair of glasses but the glasses weren’t the stupid round ones of his youth. They were wider and slightly straighter on top and then round underneath. The frames were slightly thicker too and made from a stylish black wood. They suited his face and hair very well. His jaw was square, manly and covered in a thin layer of neat black stubble that surrounded his mouth and faded into this muscular neck.
“Anyway… Potter?” He said, clearing his throat.
“And Sam is?” Malfoy questioned pressing a key into the ignition and turning it.
“Well from now on we’ll be using exact times, none of this vague terminology, I can’t abide that.” Draco said screwing his nose up in a really cute way. Well, Harry found it cute anyway even though it wasn’t what Draco had been going for.
He realised that he hadn’t spoken in a while and Blaise and Daphne were still looking at him with satisfied expressions.
“The man we were literally just talking about thirty seconds ago. Your memory isn’t that bad, why do I get the impression you don’t want to talk about him?” Harry frowned in confusion but then it hit him. “Oh right, you’re fucking him aren’t you?!” He asked with a cheeky smile.
“Yeah maybe for you! You need to get out more!” Fred teased.
.” He said with a smile.
“We apparatted from under the cloak.” Harry replied.
“I know right.” Harry said playfully but then he became slightly more serious. “He’s a good man Ron and he makes me a better man too. I really do like him a lot, I think this could be it for me, you know.”
As always please let me know what you think. Comments motivate and inspire me and if anyone wants a proper chat to discuss plot points etc then you can find me on Tumblr.
“Third year was an interesting year wasn’t it?” He said casually.
“Ooh Mr. Potter, such a shame, you were doing so well.” Daphne said back at him in mock disapproval.
Ron was still looking at him a bit suspicious but he nodded anyway. “I’ll come with you.” He said slowly and then directed his attention back to the others. “Auror Proudfoot, you’re our most senior auror. I’m putting you in charge of apprehending Mr. Malfoy, bring him into a Ministry holding cell for now. Once we have the evidence from the witnesses we can call a mind healer later to assess him and prepare for a transfer to St. Mungos by the end of the day if all goes well. Take your partner Foster obviously aaaaaand-” He said, looking round the table mentally assessing everyone’s strengths.
Ron had used Percy’s death in the battle to fuel his desire to round up the rest of the Death Eaters after the war. It gave him the fire he needed at first and then over the years Ron had settled into his role. He was a good auror and the role had been good for him, he learnt well on the job. True, he wasn’t as powerful as Harry but he had more consistent control and his instincts were just as good. In fact in recent years Ron’s instincts had actually been better than Harry’s. Ron had got better at the job each year whereas Harry almost seemed to get worse. He knew he didn’t enjoy his job and he was beginning to think he was more of a liability for the department. He’d mentioned this several times to Ron and his boss Head Auror Robards but they always told him he was being silly. They assured him that he was the best asset they had and that he was brilliant at his job but he wasn’t so sure anymore. Really he wanted to quit but then what else would he do with his life?
“Yes he was most insistent I’m really sorry Harry, I hope you don’t mind.” Draco said quickly, although seeing Harry’s smile made him less worried about it than he had been.
Harry sighed. “Yeh, I know, I’m sorry, I- er, I should have spoken to you first. My chat with the bosses was just a bit intense you know and I, erm, just needed to clear my head for a bit.”
“Yeh you’re right.” Potter said slowly. “I guess I’d just quite like to get to know you. I’m beginning to think that we never really knew each other. We just saw what we wanted to see. I hate that actually. People everywhere think they know me because I’m famous, they always assume things but they don’t actually know anything about me. I think maybe I’ve been guilty of that too with you. I’d like to start over and get to you know, properly, if you’ll let me.”
It might have been obvious from the parcels where they were going and it wouldn’t take someone too long to catch up to them on foot if they really were following or spying on them.
“Yes, I was considering what you were saying yesterday about the rose garden and it is looking like a lovely day again today. Why don’t we start in the grounds?”
“-what you deserve more than anything is to be happy. If this is not what you want then I’m glad you walked away from it.” Fred finished.
Wow, OK, that went better than expected, thought Draco. Although that was only surprise number one really.
I'd love to hear your thoughts so please let me know!
“Merlin, no wonder I’m hungry” He thought out loud, more to himself than to Pinky but to her he turned and said “Yes, thanks Pinky I do feel better.”
“I’m listening and we have time.” Blaise said softly before settling back in his armchair.
He took a deep breath and allowed all the techniques he used from mediation and occulemany to calm himself down and not show his thoughts to Blaise. If he really needed to he would go to Blaise for help, he knew that. His business and this opportunity was much more important to him than his pride, but for now, he hadn’t failed, he could still do this.
Harry gently forced Fred’s face upwards, looked into his eyes and whispered one soft word back at him.
“But they are happy now and so am I. Owls can’t really come this far, too much open water for them to travel with no rest and it would be a bit suspicious for me to get owls turning up anyway, but Mother still writes to Blaise and he emails me to let me know they’re OK. I pass little messages on to them through him sometimes too.”
“Me too.” he whispered back to Harry and practically felt the man’s massive grin. Unsurprisingly Harry was in the best mood ever for the rest of the evening.
He bought all the things he needed from her and told her to keep the change as she had been so helpful and then went off to buy the fish that she had recommended. After that he looped back to the stall he’d seen earlier that had a large selection of vegetables now he knew what he needed.
“Well I have no idea what that is but the house elves used to make me something at the manor that had milk, coffee and cinnamon that’s all I know.” Draco said instinctively.
Harry looked up at him in surprise. “You knew at school?”
Harry’s stomach lurched a bit, he didn’t think Draco would have mentioned him. When he didn’t reply Hermione addressed him.
Fred and George exchanged a glance again.
“Nonsense. It’s the first time you’ve ever brought anyone to my bar Drake and he’s really fit at that.” Then she gasped dramatically. “Oooh is this a date? Please tell me it’s a date. Ahh! I have to text Bex-”
Harry had also struggled a little when it came to talking about the dementors as he had written in the book what he had heard every time they came close. Draco was full of apologies once again for his behaviour as he was saddened by the truth of why Harry was so badly affected by them. At least they could now laugh though about the memory of Harry shooting his stag patronus at Malfoy dressed as a dementor.
Harry was laughing along with both of them immediately feeling happier and back at home here even though he was worried that this might be the last time he was welcome.
“You don’t need to understand my decision, Mother, you just need to accept it. I have thought about this a lot and I’m not going to change my mind. I need to make my own decisions and form my own life away from here. I still think there is hope for us to have a relationship in the future Mother. I cannot risk Father knowing where I live but if you want to write to me then your owl will find me. She is clever, just be sure to tell her it’s for Draco. I will accept your letters and write back as long as you let me do this and don’t try to interfere in my life anymore. I cannot reconcile with father.” Draco should feel himself getting worked up and was willing his voice to stay calm as he continued.
I will try by best to get it out on Wednesday but I have a full day of work tomorrow now so realistically it might be Thursday evening.
“I still want my independence.” Draco said straight away. “Normally I’d say I want to take it slow but you know we do already live together! I like living here with you though, I like seeing you everyday but I think it works because I still have my work which I can use as my time and I like having lots of different rooms in the house that I can go to and do my own thing. Plus, I know we kind of said we missed each other Sunday cos we’d only just kissed for the first time and all I wanted to do was snog you senseless all day-”
George looked up at Harry again and smiled softly. “Yeah that would be great actually, if you’re sure you don’t mind.”
Harry felt his breath hitch. Was that basically an admission of love? Should he take it like that or was that not what Draco meant? Wasn’t it odd that they had both smelt something in a love potion at sixteen that later reminded them of each other? Harry never thought he believed in soulmates but that had to mean something… right?
“Thanks, I will definitely check them out.” Draco said smiling, he was hoping Harry would let him read the books he’d already spotted in the pantry.
“Quite soon actually! They’re getting married on Halloween, how unoriginal!” Daphne said, rolling her eyes. “The whole thing will be ridiculously extravagant too and everyone is just so sickeningly happy about it!”
“Anyway, I went because I was being nosy and met Daphne behind the counter. I actually really liked her straight away, there was just something about her. Plus I actually did think the gift baskets looked nice and you would appreciate one so I made an appointment with ‘Pierre’ the next day. He changes his hair and his eyes. I don’t know if I would have recognised him if I wasn’t already suspicious of him, but I already had it in my head that it could be him. By the end of the meeting I was pretty convinced. It was in the little things I guess.”
An old very ugly house elf who was pretty hunched over walked into view. He peered into the fire with a very curious expression.
“Thank you Kreacher, nice to meet you.” Daphne said politely as she passed the house elf her cloak.
She paused for a moment and Harry was just contemplating how to say no when she fluttered her eyelids at him in a weird way, why women thought that would work Harry had no idea but she wasn’t done. “We could get some dinner and make a date of it?” She said suggestively.
“So you didn’t speak to Ron before you left?” Fred asked.
Tuesday afternoon Harry had gone to visit Luna. He needed to confirm he had an editor for the book before he started and also wanted some writing tips. The visit had been really nice as he hadn’t spent time with Luna in ages. He had seen her at gatherings when everyone had been together but he felt guilty when he realised he’d been neglecting their friendship too. She was really honoured to be asked for help though and Harry could tell how excited she was to work on it with him.
“I’m really serious about my privacy and this is a case OK? So you’re bound by confidentiality not to disclose any details on my home to anyone ever, even when this case is done. If you do there will be consequences for your future employment here at the ministry.” He said in a serious and slightly scary tone. They both nodded seriously. When he spoke again he softened his voice significantly. “But as it happens I do trust you to be professional. I’ll side you along Auror Rogers and Ron can take you Auror Boot that way you’ll be able to come inside but not repeat the address to anyone anyway.”
“Why can’t you stay here?” Blaise asked Draco.
“Draco,” Blaise said with a soft but bewildered expression on his face. “The way I understand it is that he’s gone above and beyond to make sure you have everything you could ever possibly need here for your personal life and your business. Think about everything he’s done to make you feel welcome here… do you honestly believe that is a man who wants you to leave after a month or two?”
Harry sighed. “I know how ridiculous that sounds, I know it’s way too fast and I don’t blame you if it freaks you out…” Harry trailed off again.
“Oh yeah it was this radio show that Lee ran to give people news on the war, rally the resistance, spread hope, give people a few laughs you know… it was brilliant. Sad too of course… that’s how I heard about Ted Tonks…” He trailed off.
“What do you think of the new look then?” Harry asked.
Breakfast had been tense and silent this morning, even more so than usual. Draco had forced himself to eat a few mouthfuls of toast as he wasn’t sure where his next meal would come from, but it hadn’t done this sick feeling in his stomach any favours. The two aurors that had been their guardians for just over a month had escorted them to the Ministry about an hour ago, introduced them to an Auror Savage and then left without a word. Savage had taken the three of them to this holding cell and they hadn’t seen anyone since.
Harry laughed at them and just like that everything was back to normal. Even though they were at different places in their lives and they didn’t always understand each other it was times like this where he thought they could just be back at school having a laugh together and he knew that no matter what they’d still always be friends.
“Then it’s mother.” He said determinedly. “I look like my father but my brains are all from my mother fortunately. She’s clever and she’s more powerful than people think. Lucius isn’t actually that good at spells really. He can duel adequately and he knows dark offensive magic but this, I don’t think he’d know how to do this.” He said, waving his hand at the room. “Plus he wouldn’t have smiled at the twins.”
“Mother.” He said in a dangerous tone and gestured towards her house elf.
There seemed to be quite a few people sitting on little stools near the bar or under the covered section next to it but the main deck so far was empty. It definitely looked like the sort of places the locals came. It probably wouldn’t be advertised on any of the tourist websites but Harry could already tell it was a bit of a hidden gem. He decided that he very much liked the look of it. It was homely and unassuming.
“Come in.” Came the familiar aristocratic voice of his mother.
“You just what?” Fred asked gently.
“Well I don’t want it any more… Draco said he’s not going to make it for me anyway but- I- well, I want to prove that I’m not, I just-”
In truth Harry was exhausted too. It had been a long day and he hadn’t quite expected their conversation tonight to take that dramatic turn. At least now they were so much closer than they had been this morning though, even though neither of them was sure if that was even possible. They were closer together as a couple in their understanding of what they’d been through and they were also a lot closer to the end of the book, or talking about it at least.
“Merlin Fred, now you’re dating Blaise?” Ron exclaimed loudly. “What is it about these bloody Slytherins that makes them so great we end up talking about them every week?!”
He knew Draco liked to read but the idea of him fawning over classic muggle literature was a little bewildering. Although Harry would be lying if he said it didn’t add to the whole mystery and appeal that was the modern Draco.
“What happens to you?” Draco said quietly, finally finding his voice and looking at Harry with a mixture of emotions running through him.
“Right OK then.” Ron said straightening up again. “You all have your assignments and I have every confidence in you. Proudfoot, remember about the reinforcements and send me word via a patronus once Mr. Malfoy is in the holding cell. If you need me in an emergency then summon me with your band and I’ll come. Everyone wearing one?”
“Harry…” Draco began gently. “Harry, it’s fine, remember, we discussed it and I’m fine I forgive you.”
Harry didn’t want to be alone either. He did feel a bit lonely when he was home, especially at night but he was enjoying Grimmauld Place more than he thought he might. It was starting to feel more like home and it was no longer the prison that he once considered it to be. It was nice to have somewhere that felt like home in a way and he thought he should have made more of an effort to make it his home before instead of running away from it and just drifting along. It provided him with a certain calmness that he thought had been missing from his life.
“Well other than your annoying amount of fan mail I see no harm that’s really come from this as long as she doesn’t come near you again” Draco said casually. “Thanks for telling me though and checking I’m alright with it.”
Draco knew what his friend was doing but had to admit it was a clever proposal. It allowed Blaise to help him but still get something out of himself so it didn’t really feel like charity, especially if he was paying for Daphne too. Draco also considered the fact that he likes spending time with his friends both separately and together. Given the fact that he would see Daphne at work everyday this would work well and he also very much likes routine and would probably look forward to being properly fed twice a week. He could survive on sustenance potions the rest of the week if he had to.
Draco was somewhat surprised by this. Although his father wasn’t giving anything away that wasn’t necessary, he did seem to be cooperating with the Minister. He supposed there was no point denying what the Minister clearly already knew, it would only make things worse. If Kingsley was surprised by this too he didn’t show it. He just carried on speaking to Lucius in the same steady manner as before.
“I was wondering about the others too.” Harry said thoughtfully.
Then he moved Harry’s hand into his lap and caressed it with his other hand whilst he paused and took a deep breath. “The third scent I didn’t understand at the time. I thought it must be to do with flying but then I never loved it as much as you did. I only joined the Quidditch team to have more competition with you, and I’d even given it up that year, so I wasn’t sure why I would smell it as strongly as I did in the love potion. I suppose maybe all these years later it finally makes sense.”
“Yeah but he won’t want to work with us if he thinks he betrayed his identity to Harry.” Fred said to his twin in a worried voice and withdrawing his hand from Harry’s leg.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait” Draco stepped forward in a commanding manner which took even himself by surprise. “What about my father. Where is he? What happened?” He asked in a voice that sounded much more confident he felt.
Draco blinked in surprise. He’d forgotten all about his estranged cousin. All he knew was that his mother had an older sister who married a muggle and was cut off from the family and that they’d had a daughter but that she had died in the battle of Hogwarts. He’d never met them.
“Thanks. I’ll erm, I will miss you though. I mean if you’re sure this is what you want then I guess that’s good for you, but, erm, well it will be weird you know, not seeing you every day…” Ron said quietly.
Just then Kreacher appeared in the room suddenly out of nowhere with a floating teapot and two steaming teacups full of yellowish liquid. He sent them a teacup each and set the pot on the coffee table before vanishing.
“Go Draco. You should go. He will never forgive you for this, you need to leave.” She said calmly.
Fred cut him off. “Don’t be stupid Harry you’re not going anywhere. Stay here George can bunk in with me it’s fine.”
There was something odd there, Draco had thought about it when he’d read the first chapter of the book expecting it to mention a loving family home and being raised as the-boy-who-lived. Instead the chapter had started very differently.
“Do you, by any chance, know what Mrs Granger-Weasley’s favourite scents are? For example what comes to mind when she smells Amortentia?”
“Why would I mind?!” Harry said expressively. “I didn’t even know it was there, it’s hardly going to inconvenience me. You need a lab and there’s one ready made, I’m pleased for you and I want you to use it.”
“Is that you giving us your blessing?” He asked with faint amusement but really he knew it wasn’t quite that easy.
“I never used to drink coffee, that’s quite a new thing but yes I very much like to start the day with a big mug of strong coffee now. Guess that counteracts the lack of sleep!”
“Aww, don’t worry my little Prince.” He said leaning over and kissing Draco’s forehead. “I’ll always spoil you and make you nice lattes.”
“Do you have any idea how long I’ve wanted to see what you’ve been hiding under your clothes Harry?” Draco said quietly.
His face flushed and he nodded shyly.
This was where Harry squirmed slightly. “Erm, pretty close.” He admitted. “But you honestly have nothing to worry about there, please don’t feel threatened or anything, don’t let that ruin this. It’s completely over, he knows that and he’s fine with it, we really are just friends and he just wants me to be happy.”
Phew.
“Oh sorry.” Daphne said, quickly jumping up and vanishing the hot liquid before repairing the cup. “I really shouldn’t have said that while you had hot liquid in your hands are you ok? Did it burn you?”
Daphne, to her credit, was still acting surprised that Harry brought it up.
Harry hesitated slightly as if he wanted to say something else but he didn’t. He gave Draco one last look, smiled and then walked out leaving Draco with a lot to think about.
Draco's first full day back at Hogwarts, what will the day have in store for him?
“Yeah, we’ll get there I promise.” Harry said tentatively. “I- I can’t… I can’t do that bit tonight but I had the stone all along.”
Draco once again noticed that he had the biggest steak but he chose not to comment on it. He’d always had a healthy appetite and was used to lots of courses, well he was used to it once. A chorus of thanks to the house elf and comments about the appetising dish rang out from around the table.
“Perhaps not but it’s always nice to hear... especially from you.” He added after a dramatic pause.
was the true master of the Elder Wand until you disarmed me at the Manor and then you used my want to disarm Riddle making his own killing spell backfire and claiming the Elder Wand back. It would have never gone against its master, which was you. You had all the Deathly Hallows. You mastered death.”
“You wanted to impress me?” Harry asked with a cheeky grin and a raised eyebrow.
“Harry… your cloak… it’s unlike any other invisibility cloak out there… you can’t possibly be telling me…” Draco trailed off eyes wide in surprise, confusion, awe… there were lots of emotions there.
Who do you think will win the bet?!
“Afternoon all!”
“I’m sure you can convince him Blaise.” Draco said flatly. “From what I’ve heard he’s just like you.”
“Where are you going?” He said surprised, aware that his mother was not allowed to leave the house.
Harry gave another feeble smile. “Yeh I did a little.” Clearly a lie, Draco thought. “I was just thinking.”
“I’ll always save you Draco and I’m OK with being your own personal hero because you’re mine.” Harry said as he traced the side of Draco’s face lovingly, glossing over the fact that Draco had used his best friends given names for the first time out loud, there was too much else going on in his head right now.
“Me, I did.” Draco said simply.
There was a slight pause and Draco caught Blaise and Daphne giving each other a bit of a knowing look.
“I know that she hasn’t changed her mind.” Harry said stubbornly back to Draco’s mother. “I’m sure you could stay with her if you wanted but like I said there is our place too if you’d prefer. So you have options.”
Daphne nodded slowly. “Yes. I was in the middle of totalling up an order with a customer when I noticed her come in but I couldn’t leave the customer I was dealing with and I didn’t want to show any sign of being flustered. I didn’t want her to think I had a reason to worry about her visit. So while I was finishing up with the lady in front of her she had plenty of time to have a good browse. I was keeping half an eye on her, she looked at everything Draco, everything.”
“Why? It’s really not that far and we usually walk.” Daphne said suspiciously. She had lowered her voice too and was looking around but Draco had already taken her arm thinking, as always, of the three D’s.
A moment later Harry was pressing an uncorked vial into the palm of Draco’s hand. And rubbing his back in a soothing circular motion with his other hand. The touch was nice and it was nearly enough to calm Draco down on his own. It was much firmer and more masculine than when Daphne had done it. Draco wasn’t normally one for physical affection but he suddenly craved more of Harry’s touch.
“Why am I not surprised?” Draco muttered before speaking in a more authoritative tone. “Well while you’re at the Ministry today pick up every handbook they have and then bring them back here to read thoroughly. I’m going to read them even if you don’t. Also bring your contract back here with you. I want to read that too before you sign it. You tell them that you need to clarify the terms and you need at least a day to think about it, don’t sign anything or agree to anything today.”
“What is there to discuss Potter?” Draco said angrily. “You want me to play the villain in your pathetic little book so that the public will understand poor little Harry Potter more and leave you alone is that it?”
Harry leaned in and planted kisses all over Draco’s face making him laugh and bat him away.
Ron cleared his throat a bit and repeated himself. “What if I’m rubbish at it?”
As he got ready to go to the flat Friday evening he suddenly felt nervous. He’d never been worried about what state he’d turned up in before yet now he was over thinking about what to wear and how to start when he got there. It was all very odd. He asked Kreacher to put together the ingredients he needed and then went to put his trainers on.
“What did he do?” Harry asked tentatively.
“Oh.” He said as if contemplating something. “So I’m guessing it doesn’t usually go with pasta and garlic bread then? When you had it at the Quidditch you weren’t eating…” He trailed off.
Blaise had asked him outright if he was gay on one of his trips to France all those years ago. Draco had panicked at first and tried to lie but Blaise had just laughed and told Draco that he was bisexual so there was no judgement from him. It had been the first time Draco had ever knowingly spoken to someone who wasn’t straight and he was so relieved to not be the only one. He actually found he liked Blaise’s direct approach and after that day they’d been very honest with each other. Blaise had even offered to have a little fun with Draco but Draco had quite a specific type and just wasn’t attracted to his friend that way. He also preferred his partners to be strangers, he never allowed himself to get close to them so it would feel weird to him doing anything with someone he actually knew. Daphne knew now too and she was very supportive and non-judgemental. Draco always thought that Blaise and Daphne might get together but apparently they were so close that they basically saw each other as brother and sister.
“Yes I agree. This is better.” Draco said shifting himself up slightly so he could nestle into Harry’s neck and give him a kiss there.
“That Strider guy is pretty fit.” Draco said approvingly.
“Sorry but I’m not telling you that. I’ve already said too much.” Harry said stubbornly.
“Don’t be.” Harry said. “It honestly is way too early to tell them yet anyway, I just want to enjoy being us here hiding from the world for a little while.”
He hadn’t expected that. He’d expected her to insist he pull himself together and face the man. Instead she took the gold silk scarf she was wearing around her neck and transfigured it into a large soft blanket before laying it over him as he scooted further up the bed and curled into a little ball.
The woman, Mattie apparently, had got a blue Nokia phone out of her pocket but put it away at Malfoy’s words. “Hmm, well I’m getting you both a drink to celebrate regardless.” She said stubbornly.
Sunday was supposed to be his day off. Daphne had been his promise to have one and he agreed but to be honest he was pretty sure he would end up working most Sundays. This Sunday however he was indeed taking a day off to go to a Quidditch game. He went back and forth between really looking forward to finally getting out and doing something fun to then being really worried about being around hundreds of other witches and wizards who might see him. Logically he knew the security and privacy measures Potter had put in place would work but he was still anxious that somehow his location would get back to his father.
Fred perched onto the bed next to Harry and seemed to reach out to touch him for a second but then thought better of it and drew his hand back into his lap.
There was a moment of hesitation and then all of a sudden Harry’s lips were on Draco’s neck. They were soft little kisses all over yet Harry’s stubble beard was rough against Draco’s smooth skin, it was another delicious contrast that Draco found thrilling.
Draco spoke again. “Is that everything I can do for you today Mr Potter?”
“What George means,” Fred interrupted. “Is that it might help you too, to finally process everything you know?”
Daphne took a deep breath and then looked him straight in the eye. “Harry Potter.”
She straightened up and returned to her more regal stiff posture that was so familiar but Draco could see the cracks in her mask as she spoke. “Draco dear, it is good to see you. Thank you for agreeing to see me.”
“Good morning, apologies if you have been kept waiting oh-” She started speaking as she was closing the door behind her and then looked up to see who she was talking to. “Auror Potter, you are most welcome here.”
Not being enemies was one thing but friendship... that was something else.
“What?” Draco said, quickly the panic rising. “How on earth would they know that? Merlin, we’ve been so careful, no one could have possibly seen us together.”
“That I kissed someone last night” Harry said smugly.
“Oh were you serious about that?!” George said, surprised.
“OK…” Draco said slowly and then waited for Harry to continue. He had no idea what he was going to say but Blaise knew more than anyone how Draco felt about being given money now so if he thought this was a good idea then maybe it was worth hearing Harry out.
Draco still didn’t look convinced but he did relax his body language a bit and allowed his hand to be held once more by Harry. Harry thought he could see the tiny flicker of a smile in his eyes.
Draco was thinking.
Harry moved quickly to sit next to him but didn’t touch him. His mood had changed quickly too and now he looked anxious.
“He told me a secret.” Draco said simply.
She continued writing his name in the diary and then shutting the book. It glowed faintly as it closed and she caught Harry looking at it.
With a hint of domestic life for our boys ;) <3
Harry sighed as he realised he was rambling. “Do I just tell Pierre that I know he’s Draco or will he panic and hex me?!”
Potter had spoken well there and Draco had no doubt that it was his testimony that had helped him and his parents secure their freedom. They had exchanged a look at the end and Draco had given him a small smile and a nod that he hoped had conveyed his gratitude. He’d written several letters to Potter after that trying to thank him properly and potentially even trying to form some sort of official truce with him but he’d never ended up sending any of them. When he moved to France he cut himself off from England almost completely and buried all the bad memories of the war. Since being back he avoided the Prophet but even so he hadn’t heard anything about Potter other than little snippets from Blaise and Daphne. All he knew was that he was an auror and still the Ministry’s golden boy.
The owl was eyeing him slightly warily but when Harry opened the cage and held out his arm he fluttered happily onto it and then pecked affectionately on Harry’s hand as if saying hello.
Potter was studying his face curiously but after a moment he stopped and looked down at this drink which he took a big sip of.
“Ah, excellent!” George said grinning.
“Approach me?! I’m not a bloody dragon!” Draco said, offended.
Damn. When they said it all out loud like that it did make it seem rather obvious. Of course between the two of them they would work it all out.
“I know, it’s just it hasn’t been that long since me and you… and I don’t know if you’re really OK…” Harry trailed off awkwardly avoiding Fred’s eye.
Potter stumbled over his words as he replied. “Erm…well... I guess... it just... erm... felt like the right thing to do.”
Potter sighed. Draco had a feeling he was used to telling half truths of his own.
Harry’s breath caught in his chest as he watched Draco’s beautiful silver eyes sparkle and then darken in the centre with obvious desire. “For what?”
“I made these for you yesterday but one in particular is quite experimental so I wanted to test it myself last night before I gave it to you. It’s definitely safe but seeing as I don’t have the same issues you do I can’t say for definite that it will work, but I’m confident it will.” He explained pointing to one particular product.
“So does that make you Frodo?” Draco said smiling to himself.
“You ‘wanna cuddle’?” Draco imitated with amusement. “I don’t do cuddling Potter.”
“I can understand that.” Harry said honestly. “Do you mind me asking how many vaults you have?”
Harry slowly got up off the chair. Draco wanted to tell him to stay close but he fought back the urge.
“Well I don’t think either one of us have had an easy life! You know, it’s funny really, how much we judged each other when clearly we knew so little about each other's lives outside of school…”
Draco sighed. “I don’t have much choice so I guess whatever it is is fine. Just make it basic please, not too expensive. I can’t imagine Pritchard will mind it being basic if we’re giving him a free place to live… Also, I’ll pay you back for it in time so let me know how much it is. It still looks like I’ll be indebted to you forever though Harry.”
“Always.” Draco repeated. “I’ve fancied you since fourth year you oblivious idiot.”
“What?” Said his friend clearly amused by Draco’s rare, slightly tipsy state.
“Sorry mate but it’s appreciated. You can tell Hermione it’s my fault.” Harry offered with a smile.
After a while of just looking into Fred’s eyes and focusing on his face, the features that he knew so well, he could feel himself relax and his breathing get back to normal. Then George was there too, passing him a glass of water which he happily accepted, drinking it slowly whilst still holding one of Fred’s hands. A few more minutes later Fred was getting up to sit next to him on the sofa again looking a bit worried.
“Relax Harry.” Draco said seriously seeing how worried he was. “I was joking. I really appreciate that you were looking out for Mother and talking to her about family was, well it was really touching. It might be good for her to see us together more. She is still a little sceptical I think and she needs to know how serious I am about this, about you. Even if it means I might not get laid this week.” He explained with a bit of a smile.
“What? You think I’d miss the chance to wish you good luck on opening day?” He said to Draco smiling at him.
“Sounds terrifying.” Draco mumbled.
“Harry?” Draco prompted again when Harry didn’t answer. Draco came and simply sat opposite him cross legged on the wooden floor of his bedroom close enough to reach out and touch him.
“Has that happened before?” Draco asked softly.
“WHAT?”
“Yeah, I only met her a couple of times but she seemed like a good person, she was even kind to me. I think she understood my situation better than Mr and Mrs Greengrass. I always thought Daphne seemed like her Grandmother.” Draco added walking over to give Blaise a hug.
“You’re OK.” He said flatly, holding her close in a rare voluntary embrace.
“I’m sorry that you had to pay the price for that.” Harry said sincerely.
He felt Harry come in from behind him and press his body up against his and then his hands were running up and down all over him.
“OK great.” Harry said enthusiastically before turning to the cupboard in the TV unit and opening it. “What do you want to watch?”
“His old pal…” Ron’s eyes suddenly went wide. “Merlin Harry is this guy a Death Eater?”
He took it and sent his coat and briefcase into the corner of the room with a flick of his wand. Then he went over to give Hermione and Rose both a kiss.
George had a big grin and gave a little playful laugh. “Well I’ll definitely try and live up to it! And unluckily for Harry but luckily for you I am very straight!” He said with a wink.
“Oh Harry, what would you do without me? Drink up mate we’ll sort this mess out.” Ron said nudging Harry’s glass and taking a large sip of his own.
Sorry I didn't get this chapter up over the weekend but at least I'm posting on a Monday night like I said I would! I was just hoping it would be chapter 31 by now, oh well!
He exclaimed with his eyes suddenly going wide. “Riddle was looking for a wand. I was there in a meeting when he was furious about his wand and your wand and then he took my father’s but that didn’t work either… he was looking for another one, he kept going on about it and that’s why we had Olivander in- in the basement, he was looking… for an unbeatable wand.”
After dinner Harry summoned his notes from upstairs and they sat in the lounge together to go over them. Draco had already read the first few chapters which went over first year but he had said he wanted to interject his side of things a few times which he would write himself and give to Harry at some point.
He seemed more confident about welcoming Draco into his house than he had been on the floo call.
“Anyway, I don’t really remember her much from school but there’s something about her you know, I erm, well I think I like her.” George and Fred looked at Harry then in surprise, clearly this wasn’t what they expected him to say.
(Plus I just think their first date is really fun, sweet and kind of hot and I hope you do too! Am I allowed to say that about my own writing?! Ohwell!)
He didn’t even try to bat her away like he usually did when she gave him a soft kiss of the forehead. She knew better than to touch his hair though, he never let anyone do that.
“This is the part that I don’t want the general public to know… the idiots who wrote that unofficial biography of me years ago, well they tried to track down my muggle relatives and question them for the book. Arthur told me about it as he caught them snooping about the Ministry records. Fortunately they couldn’t find anything and then Arthur put some sort of adapted fidelius charm on the house where- where I grew up, with him being the secret keeper... So there is no record anywhere of where I was raised and the only way you can find the house now is if Arthur or someone who knows like me or the Weasleys tells you where it is. Kingsley, Hagrid and McGonagall know where it is too but they would never say anything and everyone else who knew is dead... Obviously the house is still seen by all the muggles and my Aunt and Uncle don’t know anything about it.”
Harry flushed again. “I, er, I’ve never… lost control like that and come in my pants like an inexperienced imbecile. I usually last longer than that and I only meant to kiss you anyway but…”
“Oh.” Daphne said blinking in surprise. “He’s one of the Weasley twins?”
Daphne came to give him a kiss on the cheek. “Morning darling.” She said before boldly making her way up the stairs to Draco’s flat above holding a brown paper bag.
This was love.
Draco swallowed thickly inches away from Harry’s face. He spoke so quietly that Harry barely heard him but there was still no mistaking the words. “The- the only future I want is- is with you.”
“Of course I enjoyed it. I thought that was obvious.” Draco said, turning back around to face Harry and letting the water run down his back rinsing the shower gel that Harry had just rubbed in.
He’d had his fair share of heated sloppy kisses with the muggle men he’d hooked up with years ago but he’d never much cared for them. It was only when he started things with Fred he realised kisses could be good but even then there had never been that level of intensity, that fire. Draco was soft but strong, he was gentle but fierce. Everything about Draco was a contradiction in the best possible way and it made Harry feel alive for the first time in ages. He wasn’t just coasting along anymore, he was really living.
Blaise laughed as Draco tucked into his eclair and waited until he’d eaten it all (which didn’t take long) before looking at him slightly seriously again.
All in all it was a very strange but still somewhat relaxing evening. His mother said she was tired and was going to have a bath and retire to bed early which was a bit of a relief. Draco gave her some lavender bath salts he’d made and then went to join Harry who had already gone into their bedroom. Just as he was leaving his mother’s room though she called him back.
She was looking at him suspiciously but not unkindly when they broke apart. “You know you’re going to have to give me more than that don’t you?! You never hug me willingly Draco!”
Harry simply nodded but didn’t really elaborate. Ron was frowning and thinking. It was quiet for a moment as Ron finished his beer. Harry’s was only half drunk, he wanted to pace himself tonight.
He took a bit of a breath and glanced at George who gave him a small encouraging nod. “...but… well, you were so young you know and then literally straight after the battle you went head first into the Ministry and you’ve been busy ever since. You work, you drink, you shag- not that I’m complaining about that last one!” he laughed and George rolled his eyes.
“I have been returning to some of my old ladies circles, lunch dates, shopping trips, that sort of thing.” She explained. “Just trying to keep my ear to the ground and pick up anything new. It was hard at first, I feel like an outsider now and many of my old friends are long gone but I managed to pick up little things here and there from conversations and magazines. I started hearing lots of positive things about a certain new french potions and perfume shop that had recently opened up in Diagon Alley so I decided to check it out. As soon as I walked in I could see you all over the place, in your design, your drawings, your labelling.”
“Merlin’s bollocks have you really?” George said coming back into the room with a sandwich and a bowl of crisps. He put the bowl in the middle of the coffee table before sitting in the armchair opposite the couple on the sofa. “Drink away then mate.” He said as he waved his wand in the direction of the kitchen and the bottle came floating towards Harry.
“And what? What’s he going to do? Run and tell your father?! Or put it in The Prophet? Do you really think he would do that? Draco you listen to me now.” Daphne said fiercely. “Do you really think that I would just blindly let him back here without properly talking to him? Without thinking it through? I would never do anything to put you at risk. I know how much you value your privacy and this business.”
After he’d successfully put Rose down for her afternoon nap he found Hermione and offered to cook the evening meal for them. If he cooked it now then it could stay warm and be ready for them later so that she didn’t have to worry about it. Hermione being Hermione worked on a menu plan that she had on the chalkboard in the kitchen and everything was very organised so Harry went to work on the lamb hotpot that she’d been planning to do. Just as he put it in the muggle oven that Hermione had to cook low and slow he heard the sound of Rose’s soft cries on the monitoring charm. Hermione took a break from her work and went to get her so she could have a big cuddle with her.
“What about your father? Did you know him?” Harry asked tentatively.
Buckbeak had been an interesting discussion too. Draco admitted he’d acted like a prat but he said that he was under strict orders from Lucius to try and get Hagrid fired in any way possible that year as Lucius had been livid when he tried to overthrow the teaching position at the governors meeting only to have been ignored. It made a lot more sense to Harry and he found that when he really looked back closely at all the memories he had of Draco from that time he could see that Lucius had been in control of everything and that Draco was only ever doing what he’d done to survive as he’d had to his whole life.
“What?” He said looking at Harry with a slight frown.
“Yeah, Draco, I’m up here.” Harry called back cautiously. “I’m really sorry I-
“What there aren’t any mug-”
Draco took a deep breath. “My arrangement with Miss Greengrass is over and that is all you need to know Lucius. There will be no wedding to any witch, pure-blood or otherwise. Not now, not ever.” He said with a twisted smile, this was every bit as satisfying as he had hoped.
“I would very much like to have you with us too.” He added after a moment with perfect sincerity.
“Take care of yourself, Malfoy” looking at Draco and cracking the tiniest of smiles but a definite smile nonetheless.
It was Miss Greengrasses turn to let out a small laugh and she also seemed a bit more relaxed even though she was still in her professional shopkeeper role. “No need to apologise, she always was a bit of a bitch if we’re being honest.” She hesitated for a moment and was looking at him intriguingly. “Are you certain that no others stick out in your mind?!” She asked with a raised eyebrow.
Harry was thinking and nodding along. “Yes, you’re safe here. He would never think to look for you here but even if he knew you were here he still can’t get in. Blaise knows where you are and even he couldn’t get in at the moment. You’re right about us not being seen together too, we’ll be careful tomorrow but that’s achievable. I have my cloak after all and Fred and George have invisibility cloaks that they sell too which might come in handy. They're not as good as mine, if you look closely you can tell something is there and the charms on it wear off after a while but they’ll do if we need them. I’ll get you one anyway. Besides, I might not be an auror anymore but I still have a few tricks up my sleeve.” He finished confidently.
Literally as soon as he’d come back home the sexual tension was through the roof again and now there was no way Draco would be able to look at Harry again without hearing those sounds in his head. What he wouldn’t give to be the one who was making Harry moan like that.
Harry spoke again to fill the silence as Draco still hadn’t spoken. “Erm, you can owl me if you want, I can borrow one to reply if needed but I don’t actually have an owl so maybe just floo call me when you’ve read it and we can meet up to discuss? Er, if you want. Anyway it’s 12 Grimmauld Place and you can leave a message with Kreacher if I’m not around and I’ll call you back.”
“Sarah lost her mind when I told her I’d been taken on for a potions apprenticeship by someone who did a potions and alchemy masters in Paris. That’s what she wants to do but erm, well… it’s just me and her and we can’t really afford it. That’s why I’m trying to save my money for her. I’m putting it all aside in the hopes that I’ll have enough for her first year at least by the time she leaves school but erm, yeah guess we’ll see. She doesn’t think she’ll even get in but I know she will.”
“I am.” She said simply and then she paused for a moment before adding something else. “I- I am sorry Draco. I thought that you had chosen Miss Greengrass… I- I did not realise how unhappy you were. I just want you to be happy… you are still my son, you will always be my son.”
“I wished I had been lying.” Harry said bitterly.
“Thank you.” He said simply to the twins before Harry could answer them.
“He said that did he?” Harry asked with a faint chuckle. “Maybe I should have waited until the end to give you the letter after all.”
Shit. No, he didn’t mean that. He didn’t want Harry! ...except he did… he very much did. He’d always told himself that these stupid feelings were purely physical but after dinner on Saturday night he wasn’t so sure. He knew deep down that the more he saw of the real man that Harry had become the more he was intrigued by him and the more he liked him.
Draco nodded slowly as if unsurprised by this but looked slightly sad. Then he raised Harry’s arm to his lips and kissed softly over the marks. Then his kisses grew fiercer as he kissed his way up Harry’s muscular as if he was marking his territory.
“Absolutely. It’s beyond attraction, he cares about you.” Blaise stated leaning forward in his chair slightly and giving Draco a more serious look. “You should have heard him when he floo called me the other day, he was so worried about you and he wanted to know what you’d do if he gave you access to the Black vault… he really wanted to do the right thing.”
Harry smiled. “I have no doubt that you will find someone to make you happy one day and he will be a very lucky man.”
“But now…?” Daphne prompted gently.
Narcissa’s face was determined even though her eyes were still showing an element of fear as she non-verbally disarmed him and grabbed Lucius wand from midair as it came flying towards her.
He sounded lost, scared and sad. So much so that it made Harry want to hug him. Harry was confused, he was glad that Draco was accepting that he needed help but he thought Blaise was helping him. Has something else happened?
(They don't have a good ship name... Any suggestions? Gaphne?!)
“Great, thank you.” Draco said, keeping formal but friendly. He couldn’t show any emotion yet. “I would prefer not to get into it now on a floo call. I can give you a bit of time to get ready if you like and then maybe we could meet face to face?”
Blaise and Harry were watching the interaction. Blaise seemed to have an approving smile on his face and Harry a nervous but happy one. Draco realised he was still under the cloak but he had been enjoying watching Harry’s face and eyeing him up and down completely whilst no one could see him still. He thought it was probably rather foolish to still be under it though even though he was still wary of all the other sets of eyes out there, he could see that none of them were directed this way. It seems like they really were in their own little private bubble here.
“Well given that I cooked for my Aunt, Uncle and cousin for years and never gave them food poisoning, as much as I might have wanted to, I’d say you're safe.” Harry laughed slightly.
“Remus asked me to be Godfather, he managed to come to Bill and Fleur’s when we were hiding out there briefly during the war. It was the last time I properly spoke to him actually… He was best friends with my dad at school alongside Sirius so that’s why we were close I guess but I didn’t get to spend as much time with either of them as I would have liked. I wasn’t really that close to Tonks to be honest. I mean she was awesome and she fought alongside us a couple of times and then she would makes us laugh here at mealtimes sometimes-”
Fred looked up at George who had come to stand next to the table in between Fred and Harry and they had another one of their silent conversations.
“Erm, you go ahead and watch what you like. I actually need to pop to the hotel for something.” Draco said, trying to sound as casual and convincing as possible.
Draco said nothing but he nodded giving his permission which was all Harry needed.
So.... does it make sense?
So Blaise didn't take Fred back to his hotel room after the wedding... do you think that they will get together eventually? And if they do will it just be a fling or something more?!
Harry suddenly looked horrified. “Shit, Draco I didn’t think of it like that-”
They both spent the first part of the morning at the shop. It was Pritchard’s first day so he wanted to set him up with some jobs and make sure he knew where everything was and what was expected of him. Plus Harry was going in anyway to sort the flat out with his two Gryffindor friends. Harry had told them that he was Pierre’s investor and they were doing the flat as part two of the business to rent out for extra income. Draco would just make sure to stay out of their way.
By mid afternoon he’d finished and cautiously went upstairs to see how Fred was doing. Fred seemed happy to see him and was laughing at his own stupidity. Other than the noticeable absence of physical touch nothing really had changed between the way they interacted and had it not been for George’s words Harry would not have been concerned about Fred in the slightest. Still George wasn’t naturally a worrier at all so if he was worried about Fred then Harry would be too. He promised Fred he’d stop by again on Thursday and said that he’d definitely see him for the game on Sunday too.
“So what you’re saying is Blaise would have shagged me by now, or tried to anyway, if his best mate didn’t fancy the pants off me?” Harry said with a cheeky grin.
“I honestly think that I might be able to teach you how to control your emotions more though. Mostly, it’s something that I’ve always been good at. I was trained from a young age but that hadn’t always been a good thing… I am definitely still learning that there is a difference between controlling your emotions and burying them. When you bury them they always come back up in some form or another, Sunday was proof that it does still happen to me so I’m not saying I’m perfect… but I definitely think some mindfulness techniques might help you when you feel your emotions getting the better of you in that moment. You just need to make sure that you still wind ways of expressing them in a calm way so they don’t build up again.”
family and your mother will be there too. I’m sorry I didn’t make it clear, I just assumed you knew but I’ll communicate better in the future.”
“I still hate that name.” Draco insisted.
As Draco finally took off the cloak Harry couldn’t help but stare at him. He’d forgotten how good Draco looked today. Obviously when he saw him the other week at Daphne’s he’d noticed how handsome the man was of course, he was only human, but this Draco in front of him, wasn’t just handsome, he was bloody gorgeous. The casual look was a good one on him, he never thought he’d see Draco in muggle clothes like this but he liked what he saw. The tight jeans and the deep V of his T-shirt that almost matched Draco’s porcelain skin tone was taking his mind to all sorts of places, making him think things he definitely should not be thinking…
“You’re such a pain in my arse Harry Potter.” Ron muttered. “Good to have you back though.”
“Fair assumption to make.” Draco conceded. “I did get the impression a couple of times when I met Potter that he seemed to know it was me but I told myself I was being paranoid, seems maybe I wasn’t.”
“Hey.” Harry said, greeting him with a big grin after Draco had been rendered speechless for a few minutes.
I pride myself on doing hamper gift boxes with bespoke and personalise products in so that was my little inspiration for Draco's business, I wanted it to be more than just standard potions!
Overall the whole evening was nice and refreshing, a true escape.
“Harry.” Blaise greeted back. “Looking good.”
“So you found Fred, someone who already knows you and who happens to also like men as well as women and made yourself a substitute for a relationship because it was easier. You probably told yourself that it was temporary so it didn’t matter and that you would find someone else eventually but how long ago was that?”
Harry responded for him. “You saw her?” He asked Fred.
Draco blinked several times in surprise yet again. So that had already come out in his mother’s trial? He really wished they would stop using his name though. Draco knew it was stupid, pathetic really, he was dead, he couldn’t hurt him anymore, but that name still haunts him.
Harry pulled away and looked at Draco seriously for a moment. “I want to see you, completely, please, can I?”
It was still quite early but it was apparent now that neither man would be going back to sleep. Harry got up and slipped his checked flannel pajama bottoms on and wandered to the kitchen. He made a strong coffee for himself the muggle way with freshly ground beans as he usually did when he had the time, he was a bit of a coffee snob and this just tasted so much better. He’d bought a proper coffee machine for Fred and George’s like the one he had at Grimmauld Place but really it was mostly for himself. He brewed a tea for Fred the muggle way too and added milk to it the way he liked it and took the drinks back to bed. He doubted George would be up yet, that man slept through anything.
So yeah... for anyone who hasn't guessed I'm a massive foodie and definitely a big coffee snob!
“Yes Mother.” He said looking at her once again on the top floor landing.
Then again, Draco had been through a lot over the past couple of days, well over the last month really, perhaps longer. It was obvious now that Draco had never really had an easy life. Harry was contemplating everything that Draco had shared with him. He was so furious with Lucius and he wasn’t giving up on trying to convince Draco to turn him in. He knew Ron would help and they could put Lucius away for good. For now though he would just try and encourage Draco to relax while he was here, get some sleep and eat properly. All those things would help. At least both of them felt confident that Lucius wouldn’t find Draco here.
Where do wizards buy food/ingredients from?! The Weasleys for example... I've seen this discussed before and there are a lot of theories, not sure what my favourite one is though!
“I’m not opposed to that.” Draco said smiling slightly too but trying to hide it. He wondered how much further they might go tonight. “You’ll have to wait until Blaise and Daphne go though. Assuming you get back before they leave like last week anyway.”
“I will Blaise, I promise.” Draco found himself saying honestly.
Just then his Mother walked in and looked both of them up and down critically. “Goodness, I feel quite overdressed.” She said in a snobbish tone.
“I see. Will I see you at lunch?” He asked, trying to be casual.
He was feeling very anxious today and he didn’t cope well when he was anxious. During the war and the aftermath he’d suffered panic attacks and nightmares repeatedly, it had been bad. It was only meditation, exercise and being in the water that helped keep him calm in his daily life. His new life here didn’t include being able to swim or even relax in a bath but the addition of his daily yoga was helping. Yoga was something he’d picked up from one of his french muggle-born lovers and he liked it. He didn’t really understand all the spiritual connections that some muggles apparently had with it but as a basic form of exercise and meditation it was good so he’d researched it more and come up with his own little routine. He usually only did it along with his meditation exercises in the evenings but he had lots of time this morning and he needed to calm himself down.
Blaise had never learnt how to cook either and kept very little ingredients in his cupboards but he definitely was not short on money and knew all the good places to go in both muggle and wizarding London. He did also have a fancy wizarding coffee machine that would make anything you ordered for you so he settled Draco on the sofa with a coffee whilst he went to get some breakfast.
“My arrangement with Fred isn’t really what I want, what I thought I would have, but it is nice… With Fred I know I’ll never get hurt, I’ll always have someone who will listen to me and he never judges, ever, I can cry, I can get angry, I can get drunk and throw stuff, or I can be happy and dance around like an idiot, it doesn’t matter, he’s always there and he always knows exactly what I want or what I need at the time, I’m lucky to have that and I don’t want to give it up… I don’t want to be alone…”
Most of the day was the same as any other Tuesday. Draco’s meetings went well in the morning. The bespoke perfumes were really taking off and rapidly becoming his signature product which he was pleased about because not only did he like making them, he could also charge a lot for them even though they didn’t take much time to make. He’d lost a whole brewing day yesterday so his stock in the shop was running a little low but he was on top of his owl orders and his bespoke gifts so that was the main thing. Daphne just made a note on anything running low in the shop and Draco said he’d make his priority tomorrow as well as the new orders that had come in today.
“You can’t be serious? When? And how did you get polyjuice… I just have so many questions.”
“So what are you cooking?” Was the question he asked instead.
Also, when he was living at the Manor he’d been able to get through it as he had an end goal in mind. He had a vision for the future and he knew where he was heading. Of course he felt immensely proud that he’d achieved that now but what was next? The business was going well and he tried to be happy with that but he didn’t know where to go from here. Sure he had vague ideas, earn enough to get a small place of his own for starters. Somewhere out in the countryside somewhere where he could escape if he needed to. However, that would take years and that picture of his future wasn’t as clear as the vision of his shop had been.
“Do eat up Draco, you’re looking a bit too thin these days.” His mother said, and he didn’t need telling twice.
He had hoped to get some time with Harry before dinner but it would have to come after. Now that Harry’s head had left the space on the desk he could see an unsigned contract for an ‘emergency on-call auror and freelance Ministry consultant’. So that was the official role then was it? It was a bit of a mouth full. He might come back and read it in a minute whilst Harry slept but he supposed he should really go and find Mother. It was only polite to tell her he was home.
He had a sexy sort of confidence when he moved in the kitchen, chopping various things and setting out all the pans he needed. Draco didn’t have a proper pestle and mortar to make the spice paste in as Harry said he would have done at home, but he improvised with a bowl and the end of a rolling pin, which for some reason Draco did have. Watching Harry flex those muscles and pound the lemongrass, the ginger and the garlic with the spices he’d cooked off in the pan, Draco was grateful again for Harry’s lack of top.
“Well then come to mine.” Daphne said. “We have guest rooms, or we can even all live in the dowager house now.”
“I didn’t survive at the age of one because of anything I did, how could I? I was literally a defenceless vulnerable baby. I wasn’t any different from any other baby, the only reason I survived was because of my mother’s sacrifice enacting some old magic... It was all just so confusing to me to have everything suddenly changed one day… You have no idea! To go from being a nobody, being told every day that you’re worthless and then suddenly be famous to someone who everyone idolised when it wasn’t for something that I did or understood... I guess that’s why I have such a problem with it and all these years later and why my brain is so fucked up.”
His mother had been watching the whole thing with a slightly amused look on her face from her still fancy transfigured chair. “That was well handled.” She commented quietly to him so that Harry couldn’t hear.
Blaise took Draco to a bit of exclusive Italian restaurant for lunch part-owned by a wealthy client of his. He paid them well to give them a private table at the back where no one would bother them as he knew how Draco felt about being in the public eye. Blaise had actually recommended the investment to him as he knew the other owner was struggling with finances but was an excellent magical chef. Draco’s friend always knew the best places to go and he had so many connections.
The party did indeed go on pretty much all night. Particularly since around midnight Fleur went into labour just as Fred had set off another round of fireworks. Of course Molly said it was all Fred’s fault! The Weasley matriarch then went into panic mode but Bill was calm and controlled as ever. He was getting ready to take Fleur to St. Mungos but the labour was just progressing too quickly for her to be moved so in the end he floo called for a healer and one stepped through the fireplace to deliver the baby instead.
“Dra- close” He mumbled.
Of course the bloody man is kind to house elves and they all worship him, Draco thought to himself but he reminded himself to be polite too and said a simple thanks to the elf at the same time as Blaise.
“Apart from us!” The twins said cheekily and both leaned over at once to mix up some of Harry’s ingredients and started chucking them across the kitchen to each other.
