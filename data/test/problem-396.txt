Malfoy’s presence in the room suddenly seems to throw him back into a dark and shrouded place, where Bellatrix Lestrange tortured his best friend as she cackled wildly, a slave to insanity. Where he had lost his dear companion, Dobby. Anger and loss whip inside of him like a brewing storm.
He places it back onto the sheets meticulously, wanting Malfoy to pick up on it's deliberate arrangement when he returns. A sick and shameful part of him is thrilled at the argument that he knows they will have once Malfoy realises his careless mistake. He has always been able to rely on the twat for a brawl when he needs one most. And it is now, more than ever, that Harry desires these constants- even if it ends with him with a black eye, no matter how fucked up that makes him. It will only truly feel like Hogwarts again once he and Malfoy settle back into their rivalry.
He smiles to himself and plonks down under the tree. A caramel coloured leaf falls on his nose and he watches as it tumbles into his lap. Then, like the universe is pulling one perverted prank, the leaf shuffles over, cruelly slowly, to land on the very part of his bag where he knows Malfoy’s papers are stuffed away. Knows better than anything else, even. It settles there, mocking him.
Malfoy pauses for the briefest moment before continuing to write, and the falter was so small in nature that Harry could have easily missed it had he not been acutely aware of everything around him. There is a tension in the air that tells Harry that Malfoy has acknowledged his presence, and merely does not give a fuck. As if it is deliberately trying to agonise Harry, the nearest lantern flickers wildly, making Malfoy’s angular features appear even more prominent.
When his next free moment comes around, Harry practically sprints to sit down at his desk. He grabs the closest piece of paper, not knowing that this would spark what it does, and writes a response.
Malfoy just continues staring.
Somehow, he is now one step closer to solving this puzzle. Victory is so near he can practically smell it. Although, Harry reminds himself as he pulls his body up, he has had a whiff of it before. He isn’t a fan of the taste of the aftermath. Maybe he really should leave it alone this time. This could be personal, intrusive even. Does Harry honestly want to get caught up in Malfoy’s melancholy world?
“Uh- yes. It’s me,” replies Harry after a lengthy pause, “Real.”
on his cauldron, but it doesn’t appear to work. He grabs at his hair, messing it up even further, and his glasses finally just plop off his nose. In irritation, he vigorously thrusts the cauldron into his bag too, which despite being quite petite, still barely fits.
He turns his attention to the easy companionship of his friends around him instead, sick to death of thinking about Draco fucking Malfoy and his fucking family.
Except that this is Malfoy, and nothing is ever transparent with him.
He roams for hours, he thinks, just going nowhere. Once he starts, he finds he cannot stop. It is at times like this that he realises how expansive Hogwarts actually is. For most of his time at school, it appeared to him as just the Gryffindor Tower, the Quidditch Pitch and the Great Hall. Lessons are lessons, of course, but these three things defined the castle in his mind. Now he acknowledges just how wrong he was. With the halls void of life and the corridors silent, bar the tread of his feet, Hogwarts seems almost limitless. Indeed, he wouldn’t be surprised if it was; if the castle is recognising his need to keep moving, and is just pulling random rooms and passageways out of thin air. The longer he walks, the more weight drops off of his body. Obviously, he is tired- fucking knackered, in fact- but this only serves to power him on, determined to leave the stress of the dorm room behind him.
She smirks jokingly and Harry thinks that she has become more confident in herself since the war. To be candid, he is delighted to see it. He has been concerned that the memories of Malfoy Manor, paired with the suffering of her parents who still struggle to remember their beloved daughter with real clarity, would be too much for Hermione to handle. On a good day, they don’t flinch from her touch; they allow her to tenderly repeat her name and sometimes, if they are lucky, they will have moments of recognition. Harry has seen it himself and it broke his heart into splinters. Though, clearly, she can handle it. He should have never doubted her.
Curiosity piqued so high it makes his head feel like it is going to burst open, Harry is glued to the doorframe. Every now and then, Malfoy pauses in writing something down on the piece of paper in front of him to follow the next step in the brewing process. Without fail, each time he raises out of his chair to reach across to the cauldron, his glasses slide down and Harry can hear faint curses, of which he can relate. He never thought he would be able to say that- that him and Malfoy have something in common, even if it is something so inconsequential as greasy glasses.
“Ha Ha. You’re hilarious,” Malfoy deadpans, obviously thinking that Harry is making a jab at him about their earlier conversation.
The next few days are
When he opens it, it reads, in intricate handwriting completely well known to him by now:
“Watch him whilst I set up wards.”
Justin startles and then laughs, face scrunched in amusement. He must see Harry’s face fall because he rushes to justify himself, still chuckling. “Oh no, Harry, don't worry, I’m not laughing at you. It’s just because I noticed you looking really confused a couple of minutes ago and I’ve just been waiting. Sorry if that makes me cruel,” and the twinkle of humour in his eyes settles Harry’s anxiety.
“Oh really?” Harry says, pulse is thrumming, “Nothing gone at all?”
in their time back here- Harry hasn’t seen him. As much as he has been fervorously trying to not think about it, he cannot help the interest, the curiosity, the questions, which bubble within him. Just why does Malfoy not want him to speak to him? Why is he not telling the teachers exactly what happened? The more he is denied answers, the more he craves them.
At one point, in all his nervous distraction, he bashes into a branch. As he rises, rubbing where it hit him, it flings back with even more vigour and rips his cheek. Pain blossoms, hot and sickly, and he places a hand at the point of injury. When he brings it back down, he sees dark specks of blood on his fingers and feels woozy. It forces memories filled with anguish and fear, all bathed and dripping in red and black, to the front of his mind; he has to sit down and catch his breath.
“Yes” answers Malfoy, but his voice wobbles a fraction and his gaze couldn’t stray further away from Harry’s own.
When he gets back to the dorm-room, Malfoy is perched on his bed, writing something on a piece of parchment. His long legs are crossed and boots kicked off, the picture of relaxation. And one that Harry doesn’t wish to see. Clearly, he has not been anticipating any visitors- he is slouched, the epitome of casual. As such, Harry feels like he has seen a tortoise without it’s shell. Malfoy’s don’t
that urges him to take a shower. His body screams to stay in bed but those words drown out the noise with its own demands.
She seems to take in his dried tear tracks and general dishevelled state, and thankfully accepts his unlikely tale with a nod. Harry scrubs hotly at his cheeks, embarrassed, as soon as she turns her eyes to Malfoy.
this is a whopper!!!! almost 10k ... ur welcome xoxo it just never felt like the right time to cut it off but i also didnt wanna leave anything out! its so late for me rn so i will probably come back in the morning to proof read and be like shit what the fuck so please allow any grammar/ atrocious vocab mistakes
“Professor, I-” he starts to explain, but loses his words. “I don’t know. He needs help. Now. I put him under a Stasis Charm, but I don’t think it will hold.”
He is just contemplating going to sleep in the bathroom when he feels a light tap on his shoulder. Jumpy, he gasps and jerks his eyes open in shock.
She never finishes her sentence, because in his peripheral vision, Harry catches the title of the book,
This strikes a blow in Harry’s stomach. It is absolutely not a positive message, since he is pretty much being told to fuck off in more formal terms, but he is almost certain that everything Malfoy is saying is being filtered through that facade of his. Harry can see that he is angry- his flexing fists, his deep set brow and stormy eyes, they all reveal what Malfoy is trying to suppress- and Harry despises how he pretends otherwise.
Harry pretends to be affronted, “I’m just making it easy for you to satisfy that humongous ego.”
“Calm down there, Malfoy,” he says, despite the blonde’s impeccably calm demeanour, “Someone might start to think you actually feel something.”
“Do you nee-” Harry says, assuming an aura of helpfulness, even if only to mask the fact that he actually wants to know why Malfoy is here. But he never finishes his words, for Malfoy abruptly turns away and, in a split second, withdraws from sight.
Well, Harry has been known for bottling his emotions in the past. Why drop the habit?
------
Mcgonagall has seemingly managed to avoid accusations of any possible house favouritism; there are no suggestions of Gryffindor Scarlet or Slytherin Emerald- the names interior designers have donned the shades, so commonly requested, by house-proud fools. The room is composed primarily from wood, with peachy yellow walls and mahogany furniture. Dotted around are numerous plants, both big and small in size, stretching out to meet each other and making the room feel like the inside of a tree. It’s charming, he thinks grudgingly. He is a little happy that he does not have to endure the inane colours of his previous house. It has been said that red can send you insane, he had watched a stout reporter say so on some Muggle documentary, and his brain does not need any more encouragement.
He is burrowed away in a nook between the streets of bookshelves, one of those spots which people tend to overlook. It is warmly lit by a candle, and almost silent. He is mainly there, however, because he is sure Ron and Hermione would miss him if they were to walk past. They were in an especially overbearing mood at dinner, cuddling over their plates of Shepard Pie. He knows that they have just booked their holiday for the half term break, so he cuts them a bit of slack, no matter how bitter the loneliness tastes. Besides, his hiding is primarily due to him not wanting to explain why he is reading a piece of academia by choice. Ron would be baffled, Hermione demanding.
“I don’t,” Malfoy replies, attempting to seem offhand. He crosses his arms over his lap, like a shield.
socks.
“I heard that someone got a kinda clear one but- get this, it’s bloody weird- they have no idea who the students are. Teachers are shitting themselves because either the Pensieve memory is just not clear enough, or there are some random blokes running around the school beating up Malfoys. Might’ve broken in.” And Ron raises his eyebrows for dramatic effect, blue eyes wide and expectant.
There had been so much hope in him yesterday, but it was unrealistic and naive. As if one good day with Justin could fix all his problems- he scoffs at himself, what utter bullshit. This and the lack of manifestation from Malfoy’s dragon is proving him delusional.
The penny drops and strikes the floor. Harry will remember the moment that jaws swung wide open and outrage exploded for years to come. Zacharius Smith seems to be booing from his seat on the Hufflepuff table, his angry features distorted in indignation. For the first time since the war, Harry sees Malfoy showing emotion. His eyes widen in shock, face white as a sheet. Harry cannot gage whether this is positive or negative. Hermione hums a murmur of approval and glares at the furious students in obvious contempt for their behaviour.
, raining gold glitter onto his face.
Harry winces as the bruise to his heart, which flares up whenever he is reminded of someone he lost, is ripped apart in its current state of healing. It is as if somebody has plunged a knife into a partially-closed wound. Suddenly, he staggers to the nearest wall at the cutting realisation that everyday will be like this at Hogwarts. It’s overwhelming and he has the urge to scream into the nearest surface.
This was different. It was unbothered. It was careless. It was free.
Subconsciously, his body takes him back to the Potions classroom. The castle is quiet at this time, since everyone is at dinner. In the distance, he can hear the animated voices and clattering of cutlery in the Great Hall, but it fades as he heads further down the corridors and stairwells, until there is nothing but his footsteps and his head which is beginning to pound. He is tired. Today has been a good day, he managed to make it so- refused to give into any creeping anxiety- and he is proud. But that doesn’t mean that he can keep going forever. As he has said before, his pleasures are brief. When they come, he embraces them with open and gracious arms, knowing that they will soon flitter away. Like when you wake up from a dream and have it slip from your memory within minutes, he then quickly forgets what the happiness feels like.
Harry’s subconscious adds, and he grimaces, feeling inexplicably uncomfortable.
“Funny one,” he says to nobody in particular and caves into the itching to get them out again. Who is he to argue with the universe?
Greeting Harry like an old friend, the sun shines through the window, its rays reaching out to stroke every corner and surface in the room. Everything is touched by its light; it is radiant, and glimmering with the arrival of a new day.
“What the fuck?”
Of course, he is aware of the concept of sexuality and he knows, has
Definitely tomorrow.
At the risk of sounding like a whining child, Harry is fed up. He is tired and extremely hungry, having missed dinner by now. When he focuses a little, he notices that his legs are marginally shaking. Whether that is from the intensity of his day or the running from Dean and Seamus, he isn’t sure. He wants to go to bed. The least Malfoy could do is answer his perfectly sane questions. And they
harry finds something out about justin and interacts with draco properly for the first time :) xx
Justin’s breath is on his, hot and wet, and his hands move slowly around to the back of Harry’s neck. Each languid stroke of his thumb causes tingles to ripple from where was touched. Their lips are almost touching, just a whisper of air between them.
“Yes. OK.”
Harry looks up at the curly-haired boy beside him, who is smiling timidly, appearing almost afraid, and he suddenly understands that this is that exact same moment for Justin. He needs to be there for his new friend, needs to convey that he
There is certainly a sense of
Steel eyes are staring down at him, tearing him apart, and he seizes up again. A mixture of panic and something else indiscernible swirls in the thick iron of them. This close, Harry notices that Malfoy has a faint birthmark on his left eyebrow. Weird.
“OK, mate. Get off my woman now, or I may have to press charges.” says Ron, half kidding, half not. The alpha male in him has him cautiously watching Harry, before visibly shaking off the notion and returning to his conversation with Dean.
He needs his bed
, and it wouldn’t do anybody any good to have Malfoy here to witness it. Stumbling backwards, Harry finds that he almost feels intoxicated. He lets his bed catch him as he falls back, and watches with a sick sensation in his stomach as Malfoy hurries away down the corridor. Again, he lost control of the conversation without even realising it. Why does he even try?
But Malfoy is nowhere to be seen in the vicinity, and Harry is only partially glad. He came here to get away from his problems, not run into them. Still, he can’t help but feel marginally glad whenever he sees the boy. If Malfoy is anything, it is definitely not a routine. He is unpredictable and unexpected, a puzzle, not unlike life.
“You- uh..are very, uhm, pretty?” he accidentally phrases it as a question in his nervousness and he wants to slap himself for his lack of charm.
Blatantly agitated, Malfoy spins back around, skinny frame fidgeting from side to side. He looks at Harry irritatedly, but he stops, and that is enough.
“I didn’t come to
Acting upon impulse, Harry sidles down the aisle, being as quiet as possible. Malfoy is as quick as a cat and could leave any second if he notices Harry approaching. It definitely seems to be a recurring theme; Harry won’t let it happen this time. He has no clue what he is going to say once he gets to him, but his gut leads him forward and tells him that it doesn’t matter. In retrospect, he should have told his gut to go to hell.
Anyhow, he is feeling fragile, and on edge. Too many questions and he might snap. That is why, when Justin approaches him next, as he has done four or five times so far, Harry will continue the pattern of smiling sheepishly, before running away. It is the understanding pity in Justin’s eyes that makes him the most frightened. There is nothing he would want to do less than have someone confirm all of
Harry thinks about the paper all day, wondering what could be on it. Half of him wants to be concerned that he is so dedicated to acquiring the knowledge but the other half, the louder half, says
If Harry doesn’t face some verbal abuse in the next five minutes, he very well might just punch this stupid facade away and demand Malfoy treat him like the rival he has always been. Maybe then the sinking pit in his stomach would cease falling lower and lower.
Falling onto his back, Harry watches the ceiling for a while, with its arching beams and dirty stone, searching for any signs of life. Instead, a part of the left wall crumbles and bounces on the floor, only about two metres away from his hands. The breeze skids across him when he is lying like this, a gushing river of air. He wraps his robes around himself, teeth chattering and fingertips numb. It isn’t peaceful at all, and he isn’t sure why he ever thought it so. Therefore, he musters up all the energy he can find and rolls forward onto his knees first. His mind is so exhausted, his body an ever sorrier state.
“I, for one, would appreciate a lift in morale. Some of us are not especially eager to be returning, and I think it would help.” she says, looking pointedly at the two of them.
This has quite literally never happened before. Well not quite, he has certainly had fan-girls, and even a few fanboys, compliment his appearance. However, he has always regarded them as insubstantial. They wouldn’t think him so had he not been the ‘Saviour of the Wizarding World’, times two. Never has a person, with a lack of incentive or alternative intentions towards him, called him handsome. Not even Ginny counts, she had only done so when she had wanted something from him. He’s truly shell-shocked. And panicking.
Before he can contemplate making a dash for it, the engine begins to pump and the train starts to move out of the station. Although the strength of Hermione’s charms had made him feel alone for a moment, bar his two best friends, he still feels lighter at the thought. Ron and Hermione start chatting about their predictions for dinner in the Great Hall that evening, and whether Mcgonagall will bother them all with a speech or not.
, only the door behind, which had suspiciously just swung wide open for no apparent reason.
“Furthermore,” she pauses emphatically, “our additional year group, eighth year, will forgo the housing system once and for all. Eighth years, you are, from now on, one house. Please do not forget your duty to each other. You shall be sharing a new common room close to the greenhouses and your new dormitory arrangements will be assigned upon arrival. ”
This first sheet, however- he has some semblance of understanding of it, though his certainty dwindles with every passing beat of his pounding head. Despite what his abysmal years as a Potions student might indicate, Harry is able to at least deduce that they are, in fact, ingredients. If not for the recognisable elements, then because seeing Malfoy stealing supplies from the Potions classroom is pretty much a telltale sign.
. Then, just as he was about to make a mindless, empty comment about their Potions homework, Malfoy was nodding his head stiffly in an uncomfortable mixture of greeting and acknowledgement, before he strode away.
sooo.... hope that was good? left everyone on a bit of a cliffhanger there! don't worry i wont take over a month to update this time, i promise. my mental health has been really bad recently and i have been really struggling to find motivation to do things like get dressed let alone write whole chapters of books. luckily, harry is my comfort character and i find a lot of joy in being able to express how i feel through him. its taken me a while to get here so i hope its okay? currently its 3am in the uk and ive written a lot of this very tired so i will go back and edit in this morning. i hope everyone is okay in these scary times (im still in shock... my exams have all been cancelled) and if anyone ever needs to chat, lemme know and we can exchange social medias etc x PLEASE LEAVE KUDOS AND COMMENTS BECAUSE I NEED THE MOTIVATION TO BE HONEST!!!!!! i love this story so much but #depression sometimes wins so yeah please be nice cos this takes a lot of my energy otherwise i will get sad lol anyway ok BYE love you all xoxooxo thanks for reading!
Harry clutches his stomach, feeling the telltale signs. “No, really. I think I’m going to be sick.” His head is still stranded in between all the different images at once, stuck hearing what he thinks is Malfoy screaming. It could be anyone, though; he might have triggered another memory. Whoever it is, the noise pierces his brain and slices through, ripping even harder. He rushes to the railing, barely getting there in the first place for all the tripping up he nearly does.
With the new temperatures, comes Hogwarts infamous woolen season. Harry dons his latest Weasley jumper, noting how baggy it has become on him since only last year. He also takes great joy in unlodging his knitted beanie from the bottom of his trunk, laughing when Justin reveals his own penguin-patterned one. Calling Harry out for his judgemental attitude, Justin demands he must wear it about for the duration of a school day as payment. He caves in and tries to tune out the looks he gets. Frankly, it is some comfort that he gets stared at for the ridiculous, cartoon bird wearing ice skates on his head as opposed to the usual reasons.
All week, he has been cradling his pillows and hoping that somehow, the date would never arrive. Alas, it crept up on him before he had even begun to come to terms with the idea of being a full time student once more. It is now, at the ungodly hour of five AM, that Harry is wishing desperately that his bed-sheets would swallow him up. He reckons that he could live quite pleasantly in the furrows of his duvet for the remainder of his life, should some god grant him this kindness.
Dragging him out of his stupor, a finger prods his back lightly and he whips around to see a curious face shining up at him. Before him is a first year Hufflepuff boy, with a face peppered in moles, and sporting inquisitive blue eyes which are currently staring up at Harry unnervingly.
does. With his eyes so tightly screwed shut they begin to hurt, and his duvet pulled up securely around his torso, he prays slumber will come. Unsurprisingly, it doesn’t.
When he reaches for the knob to turn on the shower, it is cool to the touch and eases some of the taut tension in his hands. The water slides down his back euphorically, and Harry wonders how the majority of wizards can go weeks without this. Cleaning charms could never knead out the knots in his back like the kisses from the water droplets do. He revels in the stream pouring down on him, letting the glitter trickle into the drain and his exhausted limbs be alleviated. It is the simple things.
For a while, every direction he takes is a swamp of students dressed in mid-autumn gear. Seriously, it is like gazing upon a field of bobble-hats when the first years finish their lessons. It has always been this way- offensive knitwear is, in all ways but literally, a Hogwarts tradition. However, this year, the larger crowds forming indoors as a result of the cold weather, bring Harry much grievance and anxiety. So instead he finds himself seeking alternative passages, and gets to know the castle in yet another way. One would almost think he was up to no good again, with the level of sneaking and evading he is doing. Only this time he is running from chatty eleven year olds, not an evil Dark Lord.
He frowns and realises his eyes have dry from staring for so long. To give them- and his mind- a break, Harry inspects the castle, which fills the landscape in such a way that it seems like there is no perceivable way for it to reach an end. Looking upon its greatness, he feels a familiar sense of awe. Familiar from what? He can’t pinpoint it. It is only at the very moment that the lake’s ripples lash at a nearby rock that it strikes him.
When Harry doesn’t offer any immediate response, he gives in and faces him again. He raises his eyebrow expectancy. It shows off his birthmark.
“Oh, Justin. I’m so sorry,” says Hannah comfortingly, “You can come and stay with me or Neville during the holidays if you want somewhere to stay other than the castle.”
Asleep, Malfoy isn’t necessarily noisy, but you can certainly detect his presence. The bed frame creaks, and the sheets rustle loudly whenever he moves about, which is frequently. Every now and then he even snores. Harry would’ve thought that with the amount of effort the twat is going through to pretend he doesn’t exist, he would have thought to cast a Silencing spell on his bed, but, hey, it’s none of his business.
Something is wrong, and Harry isn’t sure what it is. After a few seconds, he realises that Malfoy’s walk doesn’t sound right, because he isn’t wearing those stupendous boots. In fact, the exact offenders are strewn in front of him, far more messily than Harry would have ever thought Malfoy would permit them to be. They are black leather, with a partial heel, and a dark green stripe lining the sole. Overly-fancy for school, Harry decides, as all his clothes are. Although, he won’t lie and say that his ratty and ancient trainers fare well against them. Still, he can allow their presence if it means that Malfoy is stomping around the castle in just his lavender socks. The idea causes Harry’s mood to lift a bit. It’s too good.
From the moment Hermione reminded him of the scheduled appointment this morning, for he would have forgotten otherwise, Harry has had a rather substantial ache brewing right behind his brows. It pickaxes at his head, digging into his skull with sharp jabs that make him visibly wince.
. “What the fuck? So now suddenly it is an issue? You piece of shit, it’s who I am! You think I wouldn’t change it if I could?”
Once he notices Harry, Malfoy’s previously informal expression transforms rather magnificently into an stormy frown. Harry isn’t quite sure what he’s done, other than exist, but he supposes that could be enough to ignite Malfoy’s rage. Considering the usual aura of aloofness, Harry welcomes his fury like he is greeting an old friend. It is just his luck that it is as he thinks this that Malfoy’s countenance snaps back into the facade that Harry has come to know and
Mcgonagall continues, “This has led me to make the decision that, this year, the normal house rules will be discarded.”
----------
Harry can feel his word vomit coming up only split seconds before it happens, and he is rendered helpless as he prepares for whatever bullshit is about to come out of his mouth. He blames the silence- it was killing him to not break it.
This is what he keeps in mind as he scribbles something on a piece of paper haphazardly, his wizarding watch telling him that is three in the morning. The increasingly dark bags under his eyes were already rather telling, thank you.
Harry wiggles his toes into his duvet, appreciating the crisp cotton and solemnly swearing that he will never buy a pair of silk trousers even if Malfoy were to hold him at wand-point. There is happiness in simplicity, and he hasn’t fought tooth and nail to stay alive just to fuss about with luxury. Keep your silk pyjamas and fancy clothing, Malfoy, he thinks. His raggedy tartan-print pyjama bottoms have served him just as well.
Perhaps concluding that it is safe, he folds up the piece of paper on which he has been scrawling all evening, and places it in a side pocket on his satchel. Harry observes all this with hawk-eyes, despite his lids being heavy and threatening to drop closed.
hi!!! hope you enjoy this <3 please leave a comment if you do
if that doesn’t that sound self-centered.
“I will, Professor. Thank you,” says Harry politely. As soon as the last letter leaves his lips, he runs out of the office, faster than he knew he was even capable of.
Neville swats at him, laughing and teasing, “Put it away, Justin! I’m not into you like that!” and the sun beams brightly on them all, as Justin jokingly gestures as if to unzip his trousers which elicits screams and yelps from Hannah and Neville. Harry just smiles and tries to ignore that he actually
. However, his will is ignored and it moves again, although slower than before. Obviously, it had previously misjudged how quick and attentive Harry is, and he tries not to be disgruntled by the fact that a puny ball of light is faster than him.
The morning of his return to Hogwarts comes around so swiftly that Harry feels like he has whiplash.
And Harry doesn’t know how to handle the fact that he now has to pretend he didn’t just see that, and that it didn’t unnerve him on different levels. And, fuck- whilst he is at it- he hates that he can’t just forget about stupid Malfoy and his stupid glasses and dragon, and go on with his day like everyone else in this unjust world. He seriously considers that even Malfoy doesn’t think about Malfoy as much as Harry does, and that is saying something considering his narcissism. It doesn’t help that the dragon seems to have disappeared entirely and Harry is beginning to question once again whether he made it up in some delusional, sleep-deprived, depressive state.
They are a group of teenagers, both emotionally and physically scarred, who prevailed in the face of a madman, and who came out the other side of hell’s road. Harry feels that he is justified in having pride in that. A small island of easy camaraderie in a vast ocean of students, they dish out the food and enjoy the small luxury of friendship.
“I don’t believe you,” claims Harry.
“Horrible.” Ron answers, shuddering.
anyway pls pls pls leave comments and kudos and share because i’m not kidding when i say it motivates me so much more when i know people are enjoying it 🥺 thanks bbies
, no thinking about the git, not tonight.
“You do that and I’ll tell everyone just how much you’ve been stalking me,” threatens Malfoy, a glint in his eye. Cruel. Addictive.
Back in the castle, Ron races to his dormitory in shame. There are some spikey prickles on his head that indicate it is growing back already, so it won’t be long until whatever trick the man at the bar pulled is reversed. Hermione’s leading theory is that Bar-Man slipped something into his drink whilst he wasn’t paying attention. It is absolutely hilarious, of course- though not to Ron. Ginny almost fainted from laughter when she saw him.
also regarding corona, i hope everyone is safe and sound. i live in the uk and i feel like nothing is happening, its terrifying. sending everyone lots of love- if you ever need to chat let me know :) x
Merlin. He’s going to die.
“I wish I had a tea right now,” he says to break the stillness. Immediately, he wishes he could take it back and continue on in civil silence. Another length of time passes, the wind beats down on them harder, and Harry accepts that he isn’t getting a response.
Of one- Harry, creeping again. He shakes his head at himself internally, cringing, whilst still observing the boy in front of him, and above all, the letter. Realistically, he knows that Malfoy is not plotting some great downfall of Hogwarts. Harry may not understand the way his brain works- warped by that unnatural blonde hair of his most likely. He has long suspected that upon Malfoy’s birth, Lucius was horrified to find out that he was brunette, and has been bleaching Malfoy Junior’s hair ever since in shame. However, something in him does recognise a sameness in the twat. Some sort of sense of confusion, and perhaps guilt. Harry can empathise. For all the people who died on his watch. The fierceness of that burden crushes him at every given moment, like the air has turned to heavy lead.
Once he is gone, because of course he leaves, the steps catch Harry as he drops. He burrows his head into his hands, overwhelmed with humiliation. In spite of his plight, one thought wiggles its way to the front, as pathetically incessant as Harry was only five minutes prior.
“Ah.” she says.
“Don’t be stupid, my love. Justin, any friend of Harry’s is a friend of mine,” she swears, as if they have been close all their lives, rather than two people who barely know each other's names, let alone any detail of real substance.
, that there are people out there who identify as Justin does. The knowledge has always resided in the back of his mind, smothered by Harry’s aversion to thinking about it. But he is immediately and unwillingly thrown back to his childhood- days which blurred together, hiding in the gloom of his cupboard, and overhearing Uncle Vernon curse the gay couple who had just moved in down the street.
That evening, Harry stalls his inevitable entrance to the dormitories for as long as possible. He clings to the sofa’s armrest, a ludicrous fear haunting him that he will be dragged through by some miserable soul. His fingers clench around the aged fabric; he grips it as if he were a newborn lamb on the verge of being ripped from its mother. He feels weak and childish. Age eighteen and he is frightened of a bedroom.
Once comprehension strikes, he drops it to the floor in shock, letting it tumble from his loosened grasp. A numb feeling sets in his body.
soooo hope u liked that! just want to say thank you so much for reading, your comments are all so kind and they make me so happy. im actually quite surprised that so many of you are enjoying this story, so i hope i can deliver for you all. THIS TOOK ME SO LONG probs at least a good 30 hours.. im fine tho, just running on endless cups of tea. speaking of, i need to bring tea back into harrys life. its my coping mechanism and i like to imagine it is one of his only ones too. i hope this all makes sense to you all (or rather, doesn't, since it doesn't make sense to harry). this is all supposed to exploring how illogical the human mind can be sometimes and how lost u can feel in urself. love u all, hope ur well xxx
Of course, it is indeed possible that the resulting potion from all these ingredients is harmless. Something for sleep, perhaps, or educational purposes. Merlin knows that half of Hogwarts are more than likely brewing Cheering Potions to get through the days. If Harry had the capability to successfully make one without poisoning himself in the process, he would absolutely be down in the doom and gloom of the dungeons with them. He even entertains the idea that it is just a madman’s ramblings, driven by the hour of the night and the pungent fumes coming from the cauldrons. As always, the odds are against Harry. It is all very probable that this is a mundane list, nothing out of the ordinary.
opinion, even if they are a glittery Scarhead,” Malfoy says with a sniff, and for a moment Harry feels like the old haughty, holier-than-thou Malfoy came back. Ever so minutely, Malfoy smirks, as if he is thinking the exact same thing. It is glorious, like a real victory. The moment is strangely enjoyable.
He cannot give one, at least none that he deems legitimate enough to have warranted that gruesome outcome. And yet try as he might to forget it,  it still happened- Malfoy had almost bled out in the girl’s bathroom, blood pouring out of him like a flower opens its petals. The image of it makes him feel nauseous and the bubbling red liquid in the Pewter cauldron suddenly appears a lot more unappealing.
He yanks his curtains shut in frustration, but trips over himself when he gets his feet stuck in the trailing fabric. As he lands on his arse, he hears Justin snickering next to him. He flips off the Hufflepuff and climbs onto his crisp and icy sheets, missing the undemanding company of his friends. Alone, he succumbs to the terrors of the night and the wind howls like packs of wolves outside. Malfoy's soft snores fill the barren room.
Suddenly, Neville clasps his shoulder and draws him a hearty hug. It is unexpected, and not entirely welcome at first. However, he should have long learnt not to underestimate the power behind one of the man’s infamous hugs, since it soon provides a little comfort. He squeezes back wholeheartedly.
Hermione whirls on him.
Two things happen next. A faint rosy flush begins to show up on Malfoy’s cheeks; he looks less like a broken China doll now, and more just like he is enjoying a deep sleep. It eases a tension that Harry hadn’t realised was there. He smiles, reassured.
Despite her obvious beauty, Harry feels a little uncomfortable, as if he’s playing a game that isn’t his. He shifts his legs and twiddles with his thumbs, and her face falls ever so slightly. They lie there together for a few idyllic minutes, her having moved back on her front and him leaning against the tree. A few leaves flitter into his lap and he tunes into the background noise of someone’s rap music being blasted somewhere near.
Frowning, Mcgonagall responds, “I have to disagree, but of course we will support whatever decision you make. Have a think, and we will reconvene soon.” Her teacup is empty now, and Harry’s own pasty brew has gone stone cold. He feels a little guilty that he didn’t drink it; the ratio of milk to water was just far too high for him to tolerate.
He loses his grip on himself, breaths no longer coming uniformly but in harsh, jagged stabs to his chest. This has to be a dream.
------
As he stands, he rediscovers all the glitter on his body as it falls and flitters to the ground in shimmering gold blurs. Without his glasses on, and in the path of the moonlight, they are stars falling to the earth. He grabs his glasses and definition returns. No longer blessed by ill-sightedness, the glitter just looks like glitter once again. Sometimes he prefers life without all its sharp edges, and will choose to go about his day half-blind. It is certainly softer, and often more beautiful in its simplicity. He finds that if he doesn’t strain too hard, the temporary letup of the harsh lines and mean details of reality is a welcome break. And if he fell down the stairs a few times too many in the process, or accidentally walked into Kreacher as he skulked on the landing, well, every system has its flaws.
Slowly taking off his hat, his blue eyes darting around to see who is watching, Ron reveals his very shiny, and very, very bald head.
“Elliot!”
“Wait!” she exclaimed, “I know you’re preoccupied romantically, shame that, but if you ever want to hang and hear more about my witchy talents, send me a text!” she wiggles her eyebrows and hands him a piece of paper. Harry, being a bloody wizard, has no idea what the standard response would be to someone who just gave you their contact details, of which you will never be able to use. So, he just murmurs his gratitude again, along with a farewell, and makes his exit. With him, he carries the happy spirit of Erin’s laughter.
He’s not sure how long it has been when Ron and Hermione fall into the carriage, but Hermione automatically fastens the blinds shut. She then aims a silencing spell out of the window, and the world settles a little back into place, the commotion coming to an abrupt stop. Smiling at Harry, she collapses next to Ron on the seats and he notices their bedraggled appearances.
Someone’s toad hops down the corridor, distracting him momentarily, and Harry hopes it’s not Trevor. Malfoy watches it too, and jumps when it lets out a loud
. It defies reason, however he speaks the language of his instincts well, and this is what they tell him. If only his opinion was valued and respected by the twat. Yes- he needs Malfoy to stay. If anything, just so that he has a purpose, even if it is solely figuring out
. Hermione and Ron may have gone about it thoughtfully, but he still felt it. Their scared eyes gave away their fear, whether it was for, or even of him.
It is excruciating, watching one of the worst moments of your life unfold in front of you. The shock of it knocks him back from where he had been shaking Malfoy, and he is overwhelmed by the magnitude of what is happening. All he knows is that at a certain point, numbness and pain can coexist; he has both.
Instead of fleeing, his apparent deathwish prevails and he awaits Malfoy’s response eagerly, hoping he might reveal what he has been working on in his distress. And if there was just something about the life in the boy’s eyes during their episode in the dormitory last week that sent a little thrill to running up Harry’s spine, then sue him for wanting it back.
Shit.
Malfoy is sat delicately over a table in the corner of the room. He is writing something onto a piece of parchment, elegant quill, which manages to maintain the same haughty nature as its owner, perched high in the air. Harry reflects that he is not sure whether he has even heard the man say one word as of yet. Good. The more posh drawling he hears, the quicker his life span dwindles.
It’s only after a few minutes that he realises she’s watching him through her round sunglasses, slipping gradually off of her nose.
When he reaches the tower, he realises that he has absolutely no idea what he is going to say whether Malfoy is snogging someone or not. In his best case scenario, Malfoy has already left and spared him the dilemma. In the worst, he will be alone, and Harry has already established he doesn’t know how to handle Malfoy by himself. Either way, he is fucked, and now he is just stuck on the steps wondering why in the world he thought this was a good idea.
Cracking open an eye, he watches Malfoy gather up his belongings. He shoves it all in the leather satchel that he had been carrying last night, and in all the movement, one of the pockets pop open, displaying the piece of paper that Malfoy had been scribbling on all night. Harry’s hands itch to grab it. He can pretty much assume that it is significant, perhaps even containing some crucial information, with the way Malfoy had been clutching it so tightly throughout the evening. At one point, Malfoy had even let his glasses slip off his nose in favour of finishing his sentence, as if he couldn’t bear to let the thought slip away from him. Granted, he certainly wouldn’t have allowed himself to look so, well, so
At some point, Justin proves him right and does retire for the night. Harry is hyper-aware of the lack of others in the room. The chances are high that Malfoy is sleeping in another dorm-room by now, blissfully Harry-free. After his own embarrassing display of anger today, he would be surprised if he is ever even able to face the twat again with any bearing of pride. If their feud were a battle, Harry unquestionably lost the instant he let himself succumb to whatever monstrous fire they have unintentionally built between them. Until now, he has almost always held it together. Almost.
“You do.”
“Oh, Justin,” Harry balks, “Tell me you didn’t start taking it every day. It fucks you up.”
After a couple of minutes of standing there like a plonker, he braces himself and heads up the spiralling staircase. He hates it here, he does, but dispels the memories that almost come flooding back by quickening his climb. The wind blasts him with her icy breath as he emerges from the top.
“Yeah, maybe,” Harry says unconvinced and awkward. He doesn’t really fancy third wheeling for two weeks straight.
Later, after they have been for a stroll around the grounds, Justin departs from him to head for dinner. He had implored Harry to come with him, but Harry cannot stomach the idea of food presently. If someone were to ask why, he couldn’t give an answer that made the least bit of sense. He would expect to have an appetite after a day which, in the end, turned out to be rather active. However, he finds that as soon as his mind begins to close off for the day, as he knew it inevitably would, he can only think of one thing.
“Potter?” says Malfoy, slightly quieter now.
As she embraces him in the hallway, her earl-grey scented perfume soothes an ache he didn’t even know he had and he releases a long sigh of contentment. When all goes to shit, one can always count on Hermione’s ability to spark a burst of motivation, even if it is brief. He doesn’t think that he would have ever made out of the cave, as he has taken to calling his bedroom in an attempt to force him to leave it, had it not been for her persistence. There is grace and excellence in being the bossiest one in the room, he ponders fondly.
Sometimes he doesn’t feel real. Ever since he saw a glimpse of the after-life, he has secretly harboured the frightening yet freeing thought that he is actually dead, and that this is all a figment of his imagination somehow. But no person in death could feel the rustle of the cotton so vividly as it brushes against his moving limbs, no person could recognise something as small as the vibration in the floorboard as Malfoy’s lightly steps out of the bathroom.
“Probably not,” replies Neville. There is a silhouette of ivy against his skin where the sun has kissed it. Twinkling under the luminescence, his brown eyes seem to gleam gold. It hits Harry that Neville deserved the blessing of the Sword of Gryffindor more than he himself ever did. He recognises it now in the richness of Neville’s stare and so he smiles, reeling with pride on the other boy’s behalf.
Lingering over him is Malfoy, dressed in the same blue silk pyjamas that he wore on their first night here. They make him appear so unintimidating that Harry has to smile; he thinks that the point of the expensive silk is probably to boast wealth more than anything, but Malfoy just looks like he belongs in a spa with a bunch of Muggle women. He looks disgruntled and a bit pissed off, as if Harry was the one who woke him up and not the opposite.
-----------
He ignores the question in the comment, and instead throws it back in the bastard’s pointy face. “What about you, Malfoy? Maybe I had too much faith in you, but I thought you would be doing a bit more to prove yourself this year. Not in class?” he says, and he tunes out the part of him that deflates at how spiteful he sounds. Why did he ever think they could be anything less? Friendly civility, boring civility- it clearly doesn’t work for them. Harry hopes that Malfoy recognises this now- he feels mad with how much he wants him to- and decides to ditch this charade once and for all.
Though, when it comes down to it, he realises that he doesn’t give a damn about what they are
, before screaming for Madam Pomfrey to drag him out of the infirmary by his ankles. Either that, or the second, worse option, which is that Malfoy will simply stare at him and ask him why in Merlin’s name he is there. To which, Harry will have no reply.
The weather gets chillier, and rain starts to fall more frequently. His walks around the castle grounds, however, pursue. Sometimes he remembers an umbrella and he reserves a quick pat on the back for himself. Mostly he doesn’t but it is no matter, because with every splash of rain on his cheeks, comes the appeasing sensation that he is being cleansed. The clouds release their tension and so does he; it is a pleasant company.
“But it’s just Malfoy,” he groans, “You can’t say you don’t find the image of him wearing washing up gloves just a little bit funny.”
“No, Potter. Busy with none of your bloody business,” His long legs somehow start to plough forward even more rapidly.
In a state of shock and anxiety, he begins to question whether he did make up that encounter earlier, though he is certain he did. It was certainly Voldemort’s voice, and Harry dreads to think that he could ever return. Though he had watched his body fall, watched it crumple and give into the weight of holding pure evil, he has to admit the thought does plague him. In a world where the lines of science and magic are blurred, you can never feel complacent. Voldemort came back from near-death once before, and Harry isn’t definite that he couldn’t again. He also feels overwhelmingly guilty that he wasted so much time- was even worried that it was Malfoy himself who tried to kill him- when the boy in question had in fact been here, dying alone whilst he hugged a tree.
, Harry realises.
For the last four nights, he has awoken in a cold sweat, the ghost of Justin’s breath still tingling on his. Justin. Another
Passing Ollivanders, Harry considers that he still owns Malfoy’s wand. He courtly wonders how Malfoy is handling that situation and spares a snigger at the pain he hopes it is causing him. Imagining Malfoy living Muggle-style brings Harry great joy, but when he tells Hermione, she just looks at him disapprovingly.
He lies like that for at least an hour, leaving it until the last conceivable minute before some divine will must manage to fire up a little energy in his muscles. Stroking the crinkled cotton of his duvet, he stands up and collects his Star Wars socks from off of the floorboards. They are a little dirty, but his new robes will do a decent job of covering his ankles up, and really, the only person who would notice such a thing would perhaps be Professor Flitwick with his small stature.
Soon, Ron is joining them and following in tow is Ginny. This is only slightly awkward. He’s fine. They smile at each other halfheartedly, Ginny tapping her foot in that impatient manner of hers, and Harry coming close to fainting with each counting second.
With no goal in mind, he ambles along the busy road. Ignoring the bodies that crowd him is difficult, but as it’s noon on a weekday, it could be worse. On a street corner somewhere, a busker plays the saxophone and he wishes he had some Muggle money to drop in the top hat.
The first weekend of Hogwarts has passed. Now, Harry faces, with dread, the prospect of
-------
Now what?
, his subconscious hisses.
This seems to startle him, some of the stiffness diminishes from his body. His lips are tightly pressed together and Harry thinks he might be chewing them. Harry himself is so tense he could snap in two halves, and he shakes his foot back and forth in distress. An idiot, that is what he is. Everything he has said this evening has been an embarrassment, but it would be the cherry on top for his offer of civility to be snubbed by
“Ha Ha, Harry. Very funny.” Ginny retorts drily.
He thinks back to last week, when Malfoy had mocked him for spewing over half the platform. When the git recovers, Harry has plenty of vengeful jabs in store. Idiots who administer litres of poisonous substance and almost die as a consequence deserve it. Idiots who practically give their rivals-turned-acquaintances heart attacks by doing said deed in their most feared location.
Suddenly wary that Malfoy could run off, and they would never speak again, Harry says all in a rush, “Don’t move dorms. I won’t bother you anymore.”
Astonishingly, Harry has actually been distracted enough since entering the Hogwarts grounds, that he hasn’t dwelled on any of the anxieties that he is painfully aware will visit him again in the privacy of his bed chambers this evening. It has been invigorating to chat with his housemates again, not having seen them properly since the couple of ostentatious charity functions that had taken place over the summer. Merlin knows Harry had not been in the most amiable of moods at these, mostly taking to getting pissed at the bar with Ron.
It hovers, perhaps judging how well it thinks he is going to fare with carrying on. He is inclined to think that that would be,
An expression of sympathy spreads across her features and Hermione’s full lips downturn at the corners. “Not at all. I was under the impression that Kings Cross even had orders from the Ministry to heighten their security today. It appears someone isn’t doing their job right.” she frowns. Harry feels hotly embarrassed at the level of fuss that surrounds them at every instance in which they are outside.
“That must’ve been a pleasant conversation. How did he take it?” says Neville.
“Relax, I didn’t try to off myself. At least not technically,” Malfoy tips his head back, fed up. The words rip into Harry’s stomach. And then Malfoy is deflating, the energy leaving his body once and for all. He whirls around and his eyes are blank. “I think you should go now, Potter. You’ve done your part and I’m unfortunately still here,
“For you, Harry.” And he chucks what Harry now realises is the Muggle phone onto his bed. It is a little irresponsible- Harry has to scramble to catch it- and he can't really comprehend how someone could be so careless with something so precious, and doubtlessly expensive. But then he remembers, a little bitterly, how wealthy Justin is; how quickly his things could be replaced if necessary. Justin may be one of the friendliest people that Harry has spoken to in a while, but they have lived vastly different lives. Is that a bad thing? He isn’t sure- a common motif.
“I’m not really sure, Professor,” he admits, avoiding her gaze and instead staring at the trim white quill on her desk. It isn’t a full confession, but it is all he can say without risking a panic attack. On the other hand, the idea of lying, of just going along with the Dark-Wizard-Fighting-Auror that the Wizarding world expects of him, leaves a sick and dirty taste in his mouth.
of a tosser. As a result, Harry is only
The office is not much different than when it belonged to Dumbledore; the mismatched collections of objects scattered around the room feel almost like an homage to his eccentricity. A well-used, bobbly pair of socks on the armchair by the tallest window, a curation of ivory coloured shells which stir up the stinging smell of seasalt and whisper to you with the sound of waves everytime you pass by, dotted along the top of the bookcase. There is even a Muggle yoga book sitting atop a table. In the madness, however, he finds a method. A neatness in the placements which is so distinctively un-Dumbledore that Harry instantly knows Mcgonagall has strategically placed each individual item, probably trying her best to recreate what cannot be recreated. The image is so honest, so blue, that Harry suddenly wants to hug her, recognising her own grief in himself. He feels it too when he flicks through all of Sirius’s old motorbike magazines, grasping at the pretense that he understands his godfather. A man that he never honestly knew.
Once his heart stops pounding, he turns towards the actual source of the noise: Justin, with a furious scowl on his face and his phone up to his ear. He has never seen his roommate look anything less than happy, unless you count the pitiful stares he is prone to shooting Harry. It is an odd expression on him. Usually, he would admit that Justin is a handsome guy but his features have distorted so much that it changes his appearance entirely. In a way, he is the anti-Malfoy. It shocked Harry to see the git
A low buzz sounds through the room as Elliot hangs up.
situation, before ditching the false pretence and rolling his eyes in gross exaggeration. The pale and cool bathroom lights wash out what little colour he has, and he appears more ghostly than ever. As he leaves the room, shadows flit across his high cheekbones and jaw, illuminating the sharp angles of his face and he looks bizarrely ethereal. Harry frowns, because he could have sworn that usually the bathroom has warm, yellow lighting. He must be mistaken, because the bathroom simply
At one particularly low point in his exploring, he opens the door to what he assumed would be another corridor, and rather catches Seamus and Dean in the act for the second time. This time it was at least seventy-five degrees more compromising than the last.
“Exactly”
He remembers last night, as memory gushes into his mind along with full consciousness. How could he forget the way that Malfoy had been wrecked with sweat from brewing potions in the heat of the room? It was a shocking sight, so different to his usual appearance. Even at his worst- the trial, the war- Malfoy has never looked quite as willingly sloppy as he did then. It was apparent in the war and its aftermath that Malfoy knew he looked less than perfect, and was not pleased about the matter.
His heart racing, he grabs his wand and aims it outwards, a shield. Recalling upon experience, he keeps his eyes sharp and refuses to even blink. It renders him vulnerable. Breathing heavily, he grounds himself, willing that he stands upright and sturdy, like he once did.
Particularly stuck in his mind is the image of Malfoy’s face, illuminated by the glow of the effervescent silver light and elated. Harry is trying his absolute hardest to wash it out- to wipe it from his memory and move forward, forcing himself to be content with the robot Malfoy of the daytime, but his efforts are to no avail.
Seemingly clearing up, Malfoy tries to cast a
It is only when he sees Malfoy’s curtains closed for the first time in weeks upon entering the dormitory, that he feels a warm flower unfold in him and the residual chill begins to melt.
It’s the question he has been dreading. The flutter in his stomach stops, but only to be replaced by it welling up, growing unbearably until it is close to bursting inside of him. Mentally, he has been begging her not to voice whatever queries she obviously has, and all this time his prayers have been answered. Then, he hears Hermione’s reprimanding tone in his mind,
“I hate you,” Malfoy spits. Every word, every syllable, is venom.
. Fuck it all.
A day passes without consequence. Harry dutifully dodges most people who come to find him, including Ron and Hermione. Despite his stubborn insistence to be alone, they had discovered him at the Astronomy Tower last night, arriving with a hot plate of food in hand. He had gobbled it up gratefully, realising he had gone over a day without anything other than a slice of toast. Hermione had hugged him tightly, informing him that Mcgonagall had revealed some scarce details to her and Ron only. He was tightlipped about the whole affair. They left soon after that, though not before several attempts to comfort him. It didn’t go unappreciated despite his solemn exterior- in reality, their kindness made him weak at the knees.
Justin whispers “Hey” from his left hand side and he rolls over to look at the boy. His auburn curls are always particularly messy in the morning, tumbling from their naturally quaffed style into disarray- though not quite at Harry’s level. In a slightly dreamy state, still fresh from slumber, Harry admits to himself that he finds him attractive- not that it means anything.
“No offence, Ron, but how could it be any fucking worse?” snaps Harry bitterly, feeling unreasonably resentful at his best friend. Ron had been roomed with Neville, Ernie and Zabini. Whilst Harry has some semblance of pity for Ron’s impending endurance of Zabini’s infamous vanity, he cannot help but secretly wish they could swap places. Fucking
“Uh, Hello,” he says. It is so quiet he is afraid he may have to repeat himself, but Malfoy breathes deeply and Harry knows he heard him.
, Harry panics. He didn’t foresee this outcome in the dozens his mind hastily moved to create in the silence after he asked that stupid question- didn’t imagine that it could turn around on him somehow. Trust Malfoy to completely disregard his question and manage to yet again surprise Harry. Now, Harry stands here like a fish out of water, struggling to find an answer. He looks everywhere frantically, as if there might be a sign that says
Snape’s memories.
to say to each other, even though it was usually spewing with resentment and scathing insults. He found, however, that nothing was coming out. All he could do was stand there spluttering, like a fish out of water. Malfoy was biting on his lip awkwardly, as if he was having similar troubles, and Harry tried desperately to put together a sentence in his head. The only thing he was able to come up with was
In the dank room, where the only noise is some faint Potion-bubbling and gurgling of the lake beyond the walls, Malfoy’s silence is deafening.
plot is building ;) still not giving much away but we have some more lovely draco-stalking time. but mainly i wanted this chapter to be about harry's relationships with people in his life- feel like its necessary.
(See the end of the chapter for
He thought that, in the worst case scenario, Malfoy would give him a blank, marble stare and leave. In the best, he would laugh, and potentially mock Harry. What he didn’t foresee was the undeniable anger in his voice.
Suddenly, Harry can’t take it anymore. His mind has been so mind-numbingly bored for so many months that he feels as if he is going into overdrive with expectation and information. “Sorry, what happened, Justin?” Harry inquires, feeling incredibly embarrassed in spite of their considerate and friendly faces, “You’ve been kicked out? How come?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“The one and only,” he says haughtily, staring at Harry with scrutinising judgement. His gaze flickers behind Harry, to the pool of bile on the planks, and his nose crinkles in disgust. Afraid it might cause him to be sick again, which would in turn elicit cruel teasing from Malfoy, Harry refuses to look at it. Instead, he just stares at the horizon. The moon is rising steadily over the mountains, her silver shadow beginning to cast over them. A creak of the floorboards causes Harry to look back at Malfoy, who is watching him with something indiscernible in his eyes. It makes Harry queasy all over again.
(Nothing happens. One minute, two minutes, three.)
and then he regrets that thought when it brings more images of said
, Hermione's voice whispers in his head and he feels like flipping it off. Alright, alright, he gets it.
He blames Dudley for every cruel remark he ever made about the boys who dared to dress femininely at school, and Petunia for allowing it. As much as she pretended to turn a blind eye, her silence was compliance. He blames Vernon for perpetuating it, with his foul mouth and resentful nature, turning down the invites to meet the husbands that moved in down the road. The letters stopped coming after a while, and Harry can only imagine the spiteful responses that they received. Finally, he blames every single coward who sided with them. Whether it were Dudley’s sidekicks, or Vernon’s blustering and warty work colleagues. All of them were bullies. It’s not a sickness, no, but it’s
Hands and bodies slam down on the carriage window, trying to grab his attention. Unofficial biographies written about his life are squished up against the glass and a head-shot of himself taken by Rita Skeeter in fourth year is leering at him menacingly. The noise is unlike anything he has ever heard before. Voice on voice upon voice overlap in an unsynchronised and roaring chorus, grating at his skin and mind with every relentless note. He squeezes his eyes shut and hopes that he can control himself in front of such a large crowd. The last thing he wants is to cause a spectacle and have himself plastered on the front page of the Daily Prophet. His recent absence from society has made them ravenous, practically foaming at the mouths for a chance at a piece of gossip on their hero.
Harry vaguely recognises that perhaps Malfoy’s blissful face isn’t as a grotesque sight as Vernon’s pink and infuriated one, but still, both are tormenting. The memory of the incident just plays again and again and again; Harry wishes that he could drown it out like he used to do with the headphones and the ancient Walkman that he had found locked away in a ginormous box of Dudley’s unused stuff. Maybe he should ask if Dudley could send them over. At this point, he would definitely anything to stop the unwanted interest that he feels growing at the image of Malfoy in that fucking silver-lit room. He really doesn’t need a repeat of sixth year, no thank you- Hermione and Ron wouldn’t ever let it go.
