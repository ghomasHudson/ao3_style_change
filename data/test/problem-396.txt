“Look, it’s not my fault if you can’t appreciate a design conversation with a renowned...no, wait. We aren’t having this fight again. It's more important that I remind you of the false bottoms. Do you remember the false bottoms to drawers."
am learning that even devastation is an opportunity for transformation, and my gratitude evolves as I do.”
And kiss him he did. Draco sighed, full Victorian ghost. Pansy had been right; he’d wanted this for far longer than the month he’d even been aware. He’d wanted this since Harry had beat him in their first Quidditch game. Since Harry had walked away instead of punching him when he’d seen the badges. Since Harry had pulled him from the deadly flame and since he’d seen him in the Ministry halls and since he
Pansy had tried to convince him he was crazy, that the job was getting to him. That the late-night dinners and the morning coffee and the texting were just him spending too much time on cases and not enough time dating. That the sporadic work trips out of town where Potter
Draco was restless. He knew why he was restless, but the knowing wasn’t solving the problem. He’d already been banished from the kitchen by a frazzled Astoria, asked politely to leave the library by a silent, reading Scorpius, and had been bitten by the Crup for too much pacing while she was trying to nap. Finally, he’d settled in the slightly-too-cold solarium, staring out the window at the snow and unable to sit down or even finish a cup of tea.
“Not until you agree to stop,” Malfoy hissed. “Can’t we just get through this year? I earned my place here, same as you.”
“Blaise found them, brought them to his flat. Called me back from Switzerland and we just got them back on their feet. Narcissa didn’t know he’d been sleeping rough, so when she found out, she did everything in her power to keep it quiet. Secretly gave Draco a bunch of her own inheritance, the one he’d been cut out of, and we never spoke of it again.”
“We can?” Harry asked. He knew, and he knew that Malfoy knew, that he’d only walked today in the hopes of running into this man again. But still, he was surprised.
“Sod that,” Harry replies, reaching behind him with one hand to open the door and dragging Draco inside with him with the other. “I can starve, I don’t even care. Inside.
Harry just shook his head as Ron left the room and got out the sheets and blankets that Hermione kept for him in the trunk by the end of the couch. Weirdly, though, the pillow was missing. He guessed when he’d used it last, it had ended up back in the room. Torn between sneaky in and just piling up his jumper, he made up the bed instead and pulled some PJs out of his bag, which had been moved into the room for him. He tried to just toss and turn for a few minutes, but it was useless. He was going to need a pillow. One year of camping was enough, and he was only a few feet and an awkward situation from fluffy comfiness.
“You know when he said you were good, I don't think I ever quite believed him. He tends to fuss over pretty things. But you
Draco didn’t know what to do with these moments. Moments where it almost seemed like he was being invited over, almost like he was being forgiven, accepted. He was reading pieces of paper and he was completely unsure what they meant. He knew what he
“I was already living out here, by then. I...uh, I didn’t stick around for long. With my family, and Astoria. It wasn’t conducive to living,” Draco scuffed his shoe against the tile.
“We’ll go shopping tomorrow after you’ve had some rest,” Pansy said, patting him on the shoulder. “We’re taking the van down to the place with this run. I’ll stop for lunch on the way back. Want soup?”
He sensed Harry but did not see him until he came around the other side of the bed and stuck his head through the curtains there. “I’m going to kiss you goodbye now,” he announced, leaning down on the bed. Apparently, he was on his knees on the other side. “And I am going to keep kissing you goodbye until you stop being ashamed of me. I meant what I said last night.”
“Didn’t say a word, my love.” Her pitch was a bit too high and Draco threw an arched eyebrow in her direction that she shrugged off. “I mean,
whore. Do not believe we are on equal ground here, fool. I am here with a message from your mother. This is your last chance. After Samhain, the offer to return to your station and your house expires.”
“That’s fine, I don’t need to know. But you need to picture it more clearly. Consider the way the air felt during your memory. What was the weather like? Who was there? You know, every possible detail.”
“I got you a cookie. Best bakery in town,” she said, handing him a paper bag that he took mechanically. “Snowman, for the child-man I know and love.”
“Well then, that’s that. Harry has spoken, and we will continue forward. You have, I’m afraid, lost my trust. It’s not impossible to earn it back, but—”
They remain in this embattled embrace; Draco knows they look like horny teenagers at his parent’s door after curfew. For a few minutes, he also doesn’t care. He wants to scream when the shame creeps back in, guided by the fact that Harry is now rutting ever so slightly against his knee.
He had an itch in the back of his throat, and he had felt all day like someone was watching him. He was annoyed and on edge when he stalked into the coffee shop looking for Diego.
it read. Nothing else. Harry read it twice, but just as he was about to put it aside to investigate the inside of the envelope, both pieces of paper burst into more blue flame, and disappeared.
Draco rose and saw beneath the paws he’d been watching carefully, gasping at what he found when he walked toward Harry.
I PROMISE we are almost at answers. I'm not trying to drag this out, I swear. I just figure giving you some is better than none. SORRY!
So instead, he waited as the room slowly emptied. As people went off, in twos and threes. Off to their days, their lives, their families.
"Thank bloody Merlin," shouted Ron, throwing his hands in the air and standing to offer everyone more wine.
“Yeah, but weren’t they under investigation for money laundering and profiting from crime? Like, last year or something.”
Carl laughed and swung himself forward, capturing Draco in his arms with light and humour in his eyes that had been missing for months. "Then I assume you need a drink," he teased, leaning into Draco.
The rest of the day—and most of the night—Harry would oscillate back and forth between utter despair over the mistakes of his past and intense fear of the future. How much longer could he fool Hermione and Ron? How much longer could he convince Draco to forgive him? How much longer would Montgomery not question his seventy hour work weeks?
“I take it back,” Ron said as they all took the stairs two at a time. “You may continue to sleep with my best friend.”
When it opened, Hermione had the baby girl propped on her hip and her hair bundled on her head. Hermione Granger, the Mother, was not a tag he’d ever really considered for her. She looked content enough, he supposed, but it was an obvious change unlike it was for some families. As she registered that it was him, her mouth fell open into an exaggerated ‘O’ and she took an involuntary step back. Many things became clear to him at once; first, Harry had not informed his best friends about their recent reconnections. Which meant she had not been filled in on the information Pansy had disclosed without Draco’s permission.
,” Draco said to the kitten, “that I am a Slytherin. That I think about things in a very specific way. That by the time
Draco put the paper into the same hand as the kitten and carefully took three steps forward. If he’d leant down right now, he would probably smell Harry’s cheap shampoo and cinnamon toothpaste.
Harry, who had been wandering about the new room, examining various objects around him and exploring the bookshelves, snapped his gaze back to Draco. “Yes?” he confirmed.
I were going to say anything, it would only be to remind you that you are single. And from what I hear in the world,
sticking point. Draco, in his attempt to understand, had decided that the thing to blame for all the pain was not Harry, but the Auror department.
“Ginny?” Lou asked gently. They didn’t often broach the subject of his broken engagement. It usually just led to Harry shutting down.
every time she thought he couldn’t hear him. He could play with them and laugh and joke, and it almost looked like he was himself again.
He stormed off before Harry had the chance to respond; for no reason that he could understand, Harry’s heart swelled.
“You know what, Marci? I am not sure I’m actually suited to a career with our illustrious leaders. Bit too much bureaucracy, not enough seeking of the truth.”
,” Harry repeated. “No. I just want...I want my old life back. So I’m going to take it. Draco and I are just—we’re just acquaintances.”
“No, no...hear me out. You don’t feel happy the same way because, well...war. I think I feel that way too. Like, any memory that you have that feels ‘
. You came into a house containing those two, spoke of illicit spells, and you expected them to just drop it? Have you met either of them?”
He had spent the past five years in constant motion. When he hadn’t been travelling with his friends or rebuilding Hogwarts, or suffering the intensity of Auror training, he was used to being busy. So busy, in fact, that he hadn't had to address any of the nightmares that occasionally woke him up. He'd been able to ignore the random moments of fear and panic so deep he would have to go and hide somewhere until they passed. He'd gotten so good at ignoring them that he doubted if anyone but Ron had noticed.
Babies, though adorable, do not make very good conversational company. It had been two days since Harry had run into Draco, a fact that was still confusing him. When he’d stuck Rose’s pram on the train that morning, desperate for a break from the London flat, he hadn’t had a plan in mind. He’d just bought the cheapest off-peak ticket he could find and thought he could get some Christmas shopping done outside the city chaos. Technically, he supposed, he did actually know that Draco’s organization was in Wycombe. He must also have been living there, but he honestly hadn’t remembered it until he’d run into the pram. He hadn’t been able to talk to anyone about the encounter since.
"Traditionally," the small nurse beside him whispered, "You name them yourselves when you adopt from hospital. The mother refused to see them, so whatever you choose will be their first names…"
He’s in Draco’s note. Just...let’s get this over with. Where. Is. Your. Wand,” he repeated through gritted teeth.
Diagon. Shouldn’t you still be at school? The term only just broke up. So why were you there to talk to this mysterious not-me yesterday morning.”
them to mean, but how did he translate that into action? Did Potter seriously believe that he was going to just show up on a whim of a Wednesday morning and help him with the crossword puzzle over coffee? Like they’d been married for a decade?
Harry considered the alternative. Was he, realistically, going to sleep if he left this room right now? “The lounge has a bed in it too, right now,” he said, scrubbing his neck. He sat gingerly on the edge of the bed and waited for Draco to do the same. Luckily, they both got over their ridiculous embarrassment the second they were sitting across from each other; it was quickly replaced with the weight of the things left unsaid and unexplained between them.
Potter’s eyes snapped to his and he looked murderous. “You really have no fucking boundaries, do you? Does this
“I think the timing was off,” Harry muttered into his second-pint glass. Draco had long ago lost track of how long they’d been here; Potter, it seemed, was well versed in nursing a drink. He was on his third glass of cider and things were getting a bit fuzzy around the edges. Warm. Cosy. Not a bad thing if he were to stop now.
The kiss ignited him. It fueled him. It dragged his arms, forcefully, around Harry’s back so that they were pressed entirely and completely into each other. When Harry was kissing him back all of a sudden, backing them up until his back hit the wall, Draco let loose the sound that was fighting its way out of his throat. He let it go on. Now that he was here, he couldn’t be the one to end it. Finally, Harry pulled away, though his hands remained braced on Draco’s arms.
But suddenly, it was gone. Draco had dropped the spell. As he looked up to find out why he ended up with a lap full of Malfoy. He was kissing him before his brain could protest why. Draco’s breath was ragged and hot on his skin. He smelled like night air and fire and three days of outside, and it was the best thing Harry had ever inhaled.
He threw himself into the pelvic thrust, let his legs go to jelly when his knees fell in tight, and positively went insane. The last chorus found him out of breath and laughing like a lunatic. He turned to Harry to share his joy and found Harry staring, mouth agape, similarly out of breath. His chest above the corset was red and flushed, the wig on his head was slightly askew, and the wildness that stood in front of him made Draco’s heart stop beating in his chest.
He heaved a great sigh and tried to ignore the fact that the tinned music of the seasons played even in
He hung up with Erica and went immediately back to sleep. He woke up to a giant crashing sound that had him flying out of bed.
Draco gulped. The door was never closed. Going over the past two weeks, searching for any error he'd made or shift he might have missed, he came up blank. The lack of knowledge made him uncomfortable, just as it always had. He forced silence that he hadn’t had to use in years; silence in the face of fear was a far more difficult task for him than he liked to admit.
Before he worked out what side of this internal battle he was going to land on, Draco had reached out, taken Harry’s hand, and pulled him close, until their chests were flush and their height difference unimportant.
“I just need to talk to him, Pansy,” Harry insisted, trying to push past her. She used her significant height against him, placing a hand on his chest and stopping him.
So, Draco allowed the bizarre truce to continue. He watched as Diego and Harry skillfully danced around each other in the narrow space, joking and cajoling constantly, handling the afternoon rush with a breezy confidence that made Draco feel very inadequate. It was clear they were both good at this, and the customers loved them; they had a playful banter that Draco had never heard from Diego before, and stupid nicknames that seemed to shift and disappear at a whim. As far as he could see, things were never spilt or broken, even as they jumped and shifted to both ends of the counter with hot objects and glass.
person, and not some sort of clothing-slinging, customer-service-programmed robot. She blinked once, looked between them, and then nodded sheepishly.
He was silent, as usual, these days. His robes were not regulation colour; McGonagall had basically given up on trying to keep the eighth years in uniform. There were only thirty-five of them, after all, and since they mostly did a strange combination of private tutorials and small practical classes, she’d quickly started to forgive small infractions. Sometime around mid-September, Parvati had started showing up in full, brightly coloured Muggle outfits that made Draco’s current deep-purple robes seem understated. Unfortunately, the colour only highlighted the parts of Draco that Harry had suddenly started noticing. His pale, long features seemed sharper under the jewel tone. His hair bleached to silver as it curled at the collar. If he hadn’t been so dower, the light in his eyes would have also been reflected.
Intrigued though he was, Harry shrugged. He was exhausted and a little drunk, and he just wanted to sleep. “Whatever,” he announced. “Go to sleep, Ron. You’re on my bed.”
Potter laughed. "Is it ridiculous that I'm bloody tired? I'm going to take a nap. Tell me if anyone tries to murder us in the next forty minutes."
Draco opened his mouth, trying to think of a way to finish his job. Which meant that, when the punch came, his mouth was hanging open. His teeth rattled uncomfortably in their sockets and his face swung wildly away. His wand was in his hand before he could stop himself and Potter landed flat on his back, knocked off-kilter by both the hex and his immobilized foot. Draco looked down, cheek stinging and mouth agape as the gravity of what had just happened also occurred to Potter.
He did not feel better when he saw Draco and Harry sat at a table in the middle of the room and immediately realised he was overdressed.
“I know,” Harry said, saving him even though he had planned to let him flounder. He deserved to flounder a bit, but it was Christmas and Harry was feeling charitable. “I know, Draco. So what are we going to do about it? I already told you, I can’t do this if you are going to run every time things get hard.”
Draco suddenly closed the gap between them, sinking into a kiss that he had been planning for weeks, had been desperately trying to convince himself he didn’t need, wasn’t going to take. Which was pretty stupid, in retrospect. Of course he needed it. He sighed contentedly against Harry’s shocked lips and Harry laughed, wrapping his arms around Draco and kissing him again, more gently, more carefully. They needed to be more careful this time, Draco knew. It was just hard to remember when he was wrapped up in
“That’s because I have a package for you. Lucky I didn’t get around to sending it up to the castle today!”
. “Sam is still looking for a sports editor. You can write, darling. Plus, you were on the team at school and things. I could put in a good word for you…”
“You rarely see even one star in the city. And when you do, it’s because it’s so bloody hot that you can barely breathe.” He sat up, pulling his knees up to his chest; Hermione was lying in her bright yellow fuzzy housecoat.
Of course, this place wasn’t like that at all, and he hated that he didn’t hate it even slightly. The chairs were comfortable, but not at all trendy. The tables were the ideal height, and his little back corner was bright from the patio doors. The music was always an eclectic and bizarrely catchy mix; sometimes, it was old rock, sometimes it was a heart-wrenching, soul-blues. The pastries came from a bakery uptown that had always made a delicious blueberry scone. Draco’s Americano was always rich and dark, and the perfect temperature. Normally, he could happily spread out for hours on end, barely taking in his surroundings, drinking way too much caffeine because Deigo kept putting new cups in front of him while he was fully focused on his sketch.
“Oh, I know there isn’t,” she replied as she unlocked the door. “There couldn’t be. You’re still in love with the old one.”
Draco, the new one. Sure, he was attractive, and Harry refused to discount that, but his friends didn't know the things he knew. They didn't get to see his giddy excitement about going to Muggle films. They didn't see him embarrassed because he was slightly drunk and wobbly. They didn't know that when he drank, he was so affectionate and emboldened that Harry spent most of the time they were in a pub slightly breathless.
Draco slept on Theo’s couch that night, a restful sleep despite the shortness of both the sofa and his blankets, surrounded by the knowledge that he was safe and cared for by those around him, even if the safety was occasionally encroached upon by his past.
“I mean, sure, but you really don’t need to worry about that. I know that you have Sirius’ all sorted, and yours is in trust since after the war. Do you need to make a change?”
He never saw him in meals, but he always managed to find him relatively quickly in the corridors. He didn’t dwell too much on the why. Draco spent hour after hour playing with the kitten, reading, dozing in various window seats. Harry couldn’t help but draw the comparison between the kitten and its owner; they were perfectly suited to each other. Sitting quietly and listening or watching, Harry never grew bored. Even this fact worried him; Harry Potter was a restless person. It was his basic nature. But something about being near Draco Malfoy right now, with his soft kitten voice and his slow, deliberate actions, soothed the fear in Harry until he would sleep each night,
“There are?” Harry deadpanned. “There is more than one reason as to why you are on my front stoop at my family Christmas?”
When he acts, he is fully committed. He is present and entirely aware of what he is doing. This means that when Harry’s back slams into the door behind him hard enough to rattle the window in its pane and something deep within him growls in satisfaction, Draco is completely aware of it happening.
In which the details of the the few years after the war appear. It is more than Potter has ever been willing to divulge. Draco knows because he's read all the articles.
“Only when asked,” he teased, winking at Neville without meaning too. Sometimes, when he was in this mood, the winking got a bit out of control. Neville shot him an interesting look; part glower, part...something else. If he didn’t know better, if it weren’t Neville, he’d assume it was interest
He had been successful, however. Three days into his conquest and he had turned the tables. Suddenly, Malfoy seemed to be around more often than before. He was eating in the common areas, he appeared for interdepartmental meetings that he had previously skipped, and he came to morning roster, which he didn't technically have to do. And, he was watching Harry. He really was quite gorgeous, and Harry was completely fine with making him slightly frazzled by returning his confused gaze. For a few days. Almost a week, really. Harry ignored him for what felt like ages.
"Don't say it. I can see it on your face. Don't say it. Not to me. Save it. It had better be a fucking amazing story, Malfoy."
“Yes, well exactly,” Malfoy continued. “So, sometimes, I go to the tower to clear my head. I don’t much like my dungeon quarters. They feel too much like…home.”
Knockturn was as unpleasant as it had always been. The tall, crooked buildings let in no light, and the unnecessary awnings cast even more unnatural shadows than the rooflines themselves. Almost nothing was signed, and if it was, it was with an unintelligible name like
He read the piece with a critical eye. Short, but sweet. Informative, but tantalizing enough that he hoped it would help. Parts of it made him cringe but Luna reassured him that it was fine. That it would be helpful.
him. I just...you were happy. It was, you know...good. It was the first time it was good in so long.”
Draco, for the first time in ages, did not have a comeback. His hands fell to his sides and he stared at the floor. Harry took the opportunity to step forward, into Draco’s office, reaching out to hold open the door from behind where he stood.
“The police?” Ginny interjected, stopping Harry with a hand on his arm. “Ginny, don’t. We’re going inside.”
Now Harry usually refrained from making this assumption; his ‘gay-dar’ was not good. He’d been informed of this by enough people to make him sheepish. But as giant red lips took to the screen, and the people in fishnets on stage started gyrating ridiculously, Harry was so positive that he had made the right call inviting Draco here, of all places, that he grinned a huge grin.
How the outside world felt about it hardly mattered; two men falling in love in a remote corner of Scotland was very uninteresting to the Wizarding world, especially if they were never convinced to find it interesting. The story never hit the papers, despite the reappearance of a much-beloved and well-known Gossip Columnist a year after their first kiss.
call, but when he got home and sat at the kitchen table, his feet became leaden, and movement was impossible.
Can you tell I've already completely mentally checked out from work right before break? Three posts in two days? Yup. I am doing no adulting right now...
“Well, get over it. Now, Carl, the one listed in your reports. He’s the one from the car in the summer, right?”
“Understood, Mrs Weasley,” Draco whispered, opening the box to gaze at the familiar brushed platinum inside. It had an inlay of flat, single moonstone, tiny and unassuming. Harry’s matching ring had an emerald instead. New beginnings and great love. Fitting, now. Fitting even then. The pain of it’s meaning not changing at all hurt him deeply, but Draco snapped the lid shut. Suddenly, he was pulled int a loose hug, a carefully held embrace with distance and caution, but a hug nonetheless.
After an hour spent in three bookstores, a shop that had recently gone from selling hair accessories to vintage records, and the weird new popup that seemed to be trying to market bottles of scented air, Harry found himself in front of the chic little music store that he’d always been afraid to enter when he’d come down this street before. Music people scared him; there was an arrogance about them that unsettled him. He’d once managed to go into one of those chain guitar shops, with the full intention of buying himself a new guitar. He’d fled after asking a question about an amp that had been met with indignant animosity and arched eyebrows. Guitar people could be mean and Harry Potter did not enjoy being looked down on.
That was, of course, until the dog decided to break free of his bonds; he did this at least once a week, but Draco was still literally never ready for it. The tug was instant, and fierce, unprompted, and accompanied only by a tiny growl and a yip. He wasn’t being willful, Draco just hadn’t been paying enough attention. The Shiba usually just wanted to see something. Generally, it was a snake. Or a hedgehog.
“You can just put your judgement away, Potter!” Dean called from the tiny living room. “We brought you some too.”
with a baby taking care of an infant who was feistier than most, but still. He knew he wasn’t sure he was doing it all that well, but, since Rose had taken more than one nap, had been fed, and everyone was currently alive, he refused to call Hermione. Instead, he worked while she slept and balanced himself on caffeine and pop music. They would be fine.
“Oh thank god. We’re short-staffed as it is and this new shipment of reindeer games — I shit you not, that’s what they’re called— is on its way because it missed the truck and also I’m pretty sure that Maya—”
Neville sighed, looking pained. “No, I’m serious. You don’t. Come on. I have to get you to the hospital wing. McGonagall's going to
"You know, D," Harry grinned, pulling Draco to him and nibbling his ear, an act that always elicited Harry's favourite sounds in the world. “You sound suspicious like you might be
Although he was fuming, Draco did note that Marci’s face fell slightly upon hearing this accusation and the sadness was just enough to drag him back to himself. He took a deep breath and slumped down in the chair across from her, head in his hands.
"Trust me, I'm Harry Potter?" Draco smirked. The old joke rolled easily off his tongue and made Harry smile.
Draco stood up, reached across the table, and smacked Harry straight across the head. He walked out without another word, leaving a stunned idiot to wallow in his own inability to see sense.
One, he would have recognised in the place beyond life. One, he could have picked out of a room full of a thousand people.
, Harry. You haven't been you in ages. Draco tried to show you that. I think we'd have been in that hospital room a year and a half sooner without him. And how did you repay him?”
Ron chuckled, misreading the tone of his voice and his shortness of breath. “And you are calling me because…”
It didn’t surprise him, therefore, when he woke up Friday with what was either a cold or near-death flu. He was still deciding when he dialled Erica’s number.
Amanda led him to the door, tucking his recently abandoned coat onto his shoulders again and smirking.
“The seating chart is in the cloakroom?” Harry asked, confused. Draco nodded noncommittally as they entered the room.
It is such an embarrassing position, but there is no embarrassment. There is no room for embarrassment in the spell, there is only doing and wanting, and you want him so much!
"What the hell are you talking about, Potter? What does me talking to him have to do with you? Why do I get the feeling you are angry at me for whatever reason?"
It’s one of the reasons why you don’t have eyes for anyone else but him. Nobody is able to affect your mood like he is.
"You will follow every command, and obey it to the fullest until such a time as you are released from this spell."
It fits him to shift his moods with the blink of an eye, especially since it is so difficult for you to change your own mood.
And then it happens: Parker bumps his shoulder against Draco, which makes Draco laugh. Laugh out loud, so that Harry could hear it. And then Draco bumps back into Parker. The last thing Harry sees before they turn the corner is Parker lifting his arm, most likely to slip it around his waist. It makes Harry wish that he isn't  the senior-squad leader and in an office full of Aurors so that he could get away with murder.
It hurts you that he would leave you alone like that. But you know it hurts him that you need a spell to enjoy being with him. So, by all accounts you are even... making each other miserable.
A surprised sound escapes your lips as you feel the cold gel beneath your fingertips yet again, but this time it feels a hundred times colder.
Harry walked around his desk, still smiling way too much for Draco's taste. "Draco, would you do me the honour of being my date for the Christmas Ball?" he asked.
You can't shake the feeling that he wants to say more, but for once in your life you don't feel the need to taunt and prod, but are just able to enjoy the touch.
But what Draco truly was for Harry was heart and home. Just seeing him, being with him; and it didn’t hurt that they were both still as insatiable for each other as they had been the day of their very first kiss.
"Weasley, I believe you are indebted to me, and once you figure it out, I will gracefully accept your gratitude," Draco said, and started to walk towards his lab.
Draco had many sides, some came along with his Veela-heritage, like the need for open spaces, the need to touch Harry every so often, and make sure that Harry was happy and more than ok. Some were simply part of his upbringing, as he never allowed himself to walk out the door in anything else but the perfect attire, and there would never be any sort of discussion with Draco Malfoy in public. Harry had learned that one the hard way, because the row that had followed at home still was in the top three of all the rows they had over the nineteen years which followed. It had been that magnificent, especially in the make-up department.
Obviously, he thought wrong, and it is annoying! Why does Draco even concern himself with Parker in the first place? That youngster is neither that beautiful, nor that witty, and certainly not funny. He is also prone to mistakes. Although Harry may be a bit stricter with him than he usually is even if he does deny it whenever Ron asks. He is also rather clumsy. He knows that if Draco dislikes one thing it's clumsiness. That is why Harry is so careful around him, not that Draco has ever noticed.
As your fingers start to open your shirt, you finally catch on with what is happening, especially as you see the orderly lined up dildos and the five- ringed cock harness with the soft black leather, which you hate as often as you are grateful for it being there.
Draco pinched his nose: "Please tell me you are aware of how ridiculous you sound? You are a senior-squad leader. Let the juniors do their fucking work so that you have time to annoy me again."
A moan escapes your lips as his cock slowly fills you. The first sting of the intrusion only highlights the fact that he is moving inside you.
"Going to but failed to, yes I did. I am not certain what you expected, but there are monitoring wards on my doors. Keeps me up to date on the Ministry gossip as well," Draco tried to fudge over the details, since technically it was not really in the grey area anymore.
Your cock is already stirring in your trousers, as you imagine all the different outcomes this evening could have.
"Well, then I believe you finally got yourself a date for the Ball, Harry," Draco said, before he pulled Harry into a kiss, just to show him how it's done.
Draco shook his head, before he knocked on the door once and entered the office. "Rumour has it you are in a particularly bad mood today, Potter," he said in lieu of greeting.
With fascination you notice the sweat that makes his hair stick to his forehead. He is glowing in lust and that fact in and of itself makes the whole situation so much hotter for you. Even his perfect trousers are most likely getting wrinkled... it makes you proud, though it is a silly thing.
Harry slowly moved his fingers over Draco’s soft feathers. He simply couldn’t get enough of the softness. He always itched to touch those soft feathers and, most of the time, Draco indulged him. But only after some staring and sighing, sometimes even some loaded looks. And then it was only for a short time, before he had had enough again... or demanded rough and fast sex, as if to make up for the faux pas of having enjoyed a soft patting.
"Slowly, I want you to lose your mind slowly, until lust is all you feel, and all you are," Draco says and so the spell slows down the movement.
It wasn’t that he didn’t like it. More often than not, he couldn’t even fight the soft purr that escaped from deep in his throat. But it was his Veela - instincts warring against his Malfoy- pride and, having been raised a Malfoy, as Harry understood now, was not an easy lesson to overcome.
And then, as your voice is growing hoarse, he finally shows some mercy on you and removes the cage. You come even before he has a chance to thrust again. And it feels so good!
As you floo home, you dare to wish that maybe one day the truth will find it’s way and you will stop hiding, stop hurting him. But for now this is the best you can do...
Once you turn around and are settled with your back against the headboard, feet pointing towards Draco, your hands start to move of their own volition, caressing your chest, moving ever so slightly towards your nipples.
Draco breathed out a heavy sigh. "Potter... Harry, if I could barely stand you, do you think you would have entrance to my laboratory, where you have annoyed me daily until recently?" And then finally something dropped into place for Draco. "Wait, you are not coming down to me anymore because you are doing junior-field Auror work, on top of your normal duties, is that it?" Draco asked exasperated.
A sob of relief escapes your lips. The mere knowledge that this will find such an end, and sooner rather than later, feels like the absolution of all your sins.
You still have to put in some effort, and sometimes you are too lazy to do so, but that is okay, because you do not need to tell him about those times.
A helpless sound escapes your lips as your hands slow down, inserting the toy inch by slow inch. The muscles in your thighs are contracting due to the effort of holding you up. You want to move, you want to be filled, but you cannot.
"I am not keeping tabs on you. It's not like I have the time. I just saw you two earlier," Harry replied, though Draco could see that that was not even half of it.
And even though you see him sitting right there on the other side of the room, it feels like he is whispering in your ear, making your body throb with want.
"Why is Parker always hanging around Malfoy?" Harry huffs, as he watches junior-Auror Parker walk down through the office next to Draco. It annoys him, because really Parker should work and not laze around all day every day.
"So very needy. But never let it be said that, I have no mercy. You may even choose, Potter. Would you like to fuck yourself with that toy, or would you like for me to fuck you?"
You sink more deeply into the bed, while putting your feet up, spreading yourself open for him to see. You sense his gaze travelling over your body, taking the sight of you in. It sends hot and cold shivers all over your body. How can he have such power over you just by looking? Or better yet, why does the fact that his gaze has this power over you turn you on so much more?
You are not sure how, but the first dildo, the smallest of the three is in your hand, while the fingers of the other hand are dipping in and out of your own hole. This time, your fingers move faster, as if the last command has erased the order to go slow. You need to be filled, and you want it now.
You only saw the curtains in their true colour once and ever since, you are reluctant to stay long enough to repeat that experience, because it had touched something in you that could never be acknowledged; that should not even exist.
You know you are touching yourself, something you hardly do outside of this room. But in here, under the spell, it doesn't feel like your own touch. It feels as if his hands are on you, especially as you have no control over the movement. The spell has taken that control from you.
"Not you, him. He doesn't have any business being this cosy with you like you have been best friends forever, when after all this time you can barely stand me, even though I try so hard," Harry blurted out and then shut his mouth with an audible snap.
Your fingers move further downwards, stroking your thighs, making the soft skin there come alive with goose bumps before they move back again. A soft moan leaves you as your fingers start to tease the rim of your muscle, and a slow shudder works through your body, need coming alive inside you.
Even if it wasn't for the spell you would hardly know how to react to a smile from him. It is both mesmerizing and endearing and that makes it dangerous.
There is acidity at the end of the words, but all you hear is the warning of not breaking the spell, as your hands switch to the medium dildo.
"Though, if you take the choice that I shall fuck you, the cage will stay on until I remove it. If you choose the toy, I shall remove the cage, and you are free to come whenever you like. So, Potter, decide. Would you like to be fucked in a way that satisfies all your needs, or do you come here just for a quick and dirty orgasm?"
"Mate? What's gotten into you?" Ron asks, and Harry pushes his fingernails deep into the inside of his hand.
"I believe the annual Ministry Yule Ball is in two weeks. After six years of you nearly asking, I am tired of waiting. If you are not going to ask me, I will go with Hilton from the Obliviators," Draco threatened.
"There. All set, Potter. Now I want you to give me a good show," Draco request-orders again, pushing you towards the bed.
When did it stop being only about your pleasure and start to be about his as well? You don’t know, and you don’t remember. You are certain though, that he always knows how to get the most out of it. But you no longer feel like it has to a battle. You want him to enjoy your company, and come to long for it to the same degree you long to be here, with him.
For those precious moments the world seems to stand still. You feel like you are floating on a cloud, sated and safe. Your eye lids get heavy, and close on their own so often, until you are simply unable to open them again.
You, of course are unable to refuse the order, so you listen to the filthy noise that is only making it too obvious how slow your hand is moving. Dissatisfactory, but at the same time making you long for more. Some part of you is unable to believe the way you are acting, but that part does not matter. All that matters is this lust and want, and the fulfilment of both.
Draco scanned the sky desperately, and sure enough, almost camouflaged against the sky, he found a white, feathered head, the gentle curve of massive wings.
“Parkinson, whatever you want, why don’t we just step outside? These people did nothing wrong,” Harry said coolly.
Finally, after too many sleepless nights, he wrote a very short letter, three sentences that were going to cost him far more in pride than they were in postage.
"Why aren't you asleep? It's late," Harry said. Realising that was completely the wrong question, no matter how happy he was to see a sleepy, crumpled Draco at two in the morning. He wasn't really allowed to ask that question, not now. He shook his head at himself. "Wait. No. Why are you here? More important."
“Aguamenti,” he murmured as he dropped his bag again. The water in his canteen was cool and refreshing, and he laughed at himself for not realising he could have done it sooner.
So he’d send Draco scraps of parchment. He’d send them for as long as it took for him to approach. For Harry to be able to hold out his hand and have it grasped in return.
Draco tilts his head, captivated. Harry stands and steps toward him. Draco instinctively backs up, never having had a good experience Harry Potter advancing on him.
“What are you doing in London?” he asked Draco, ignoring the feeling in the pit of the stomach that he should really be drawing his wand. Throwing curses at each other was hardly the long term plan, and it was a risky move to draw a wand on another wizard in the middle of the day on a street not known for thinking before casting.
exactly this keeps happening. Are you following me? Having me tracked? One job is a coincidence, two is a bit of a fluke. But
Knowing what he did now, his anger and sadness back in full swing, the surname bristled and Harry stood at full attention for a moment as the anger swelled. All at once, however, he fell apart again.
Draco moved toward it and extended a careful hand, grinning when the baby nuzzled closer and made a miniature version of his father’s own screech.
With a few years of distance from the rowdy club scene, Draco finally understood its appeal. The anonymity, the unguarded way he got to just be himself, not to mention pretty people in pretty clothes who bought him drinks and told him he was pretty too. All those things were what he needed.
, would you like to go into this ridiculously old cloister library and look through dusty tomes for the tiniest shred of evidence that there was once magic in these tombs?”
Potter cleared his throat and pushed himself off the counter, “Unicorns, hey? Like, white and a horn and rainbow tails?”
"We aren't,” Pansy replied, carrying a large bag and box back into the kitchen. “But Theo and I have news. And we figured telling you while you opened pretty things would prevent you from hexing us.
Draco grinned at him. “No one is standing here pressuring you. Instruments are like parts of your body. There’s not much point in me trying to convince you which one you should buy. I’ll be back there if you need anything.”
They agreed to meet and Harry left with the box. He spent the rest of his evening eating snacks at the bar and making a list of things he understood and things he still needed to know. For the first time in months, the columns were almost even.
With Harry Potter! In his little Muggle hidey-hole! Don’t you want an autograph?” Pansy simpered, stepping forward as Harry simultaneously moved toward her.
“Night, Harry,” he said calmly as he walked by, hoping that the fizzing in his head wasn't apparent on his face.
With this regular, insistent help, Harry cobbled out a new sort of life for himself; a new normal, where he sometimes managed to stop his mind from going over and over the endless litany of things he'd messed up. Where occasionally, he
Pansy had eyed Draco, looked at the dog, and proceeded to bully the lady into opening the door for them. An hour later, he’d marched out of the shelter holding a leash and a bag of kibble.
“Pretty sure that’s illegal,” he’d replied. Harry had just laughed, made some joke about how that just made it ‘more fun’, and then tackled Draco into the covers.
She looked at him sadly but didn’t argue. “I… I’ll put it through, if you insist. But. Draco, one thing before you go?”
Pansy turned to him sharply. "What? No, Draco. Merlin, how did you manage to completely miss my point. We aren't 15, Draco. Go love someone. Go love the person your brain is
Life. It is hard. And messy. And scary and perfect and awful and lovely and the most confusing part of the universe. It is full of ups and downs and in-betweens that you can't even begin to feel. These characters are just life. Come join them on the random meander through years of regular. Years of tea and dirty spoons. Years of adventure and quiet. Because at the end of the day, life is just daily. We find joy in that. If you need a reminder of how,  try finding one thing that you think is beautiful. And then go half an hour at a time from there.
Confusingly, Ginny's plan seemed to be an annoyingly regular presence in his life. She started by making small, bizarre requests for help. It started with mundane tasks that she obviously did not actually need help with; she would show up at the house requesting company while she went to the bank, or help to babysit Rose and baby Hugo, or to be her buddy on adventures into muggle London.
The shop was empty when Harry walked in and he exhaled in extreme relief at the fact. He was not interested in signings or attention today. He'd managed to get there by tube, only getting stopped once by a gaggle of young girls wanting a selfie.
The surge in his movements was very complex; he was instantly out of control in a way that he’d never before experienced. His mouth was open as though he was going to explain, but instead, he crashed into Harry's chest first. As most humans would have, Harry stepped back with one foot, braced Draco by the arms, and opened
Which, of course, also meant that this was the first time Hermione was seeing him since he’d managed to not show up to his own wedding and left her and Ron to pick up the pieces. His mind raced as he tried to determine how exactly he was going to deal with this.
The surface was very tidy. That wasn’t surprising. Draco’s workspace was always meticulous, even at the Ministry, where new files were hitting his Unspeakables office every other minute. There was a clear file system, and anyone who chose not to follow it earned the wrath of the pernickety Lifelong Slytherin.
“You can’t be back here,” he said wearily. “I’m not giving you a comment. Not after that last article you wrote. Sod off. Tell them to send someone else.”
“Dear Merlin. You’re right," he teased. "We need to sell that place immediately. The last thing it needs is haunting.”
“I suppose you’ll have to find some other unsuspecting small business to ‘invest’ the profits of your terrorism into.”
"Do you really think we need wards?" Draco asked as he checked the hinges on the kitchen cupboards one more time.
“You didn’t have to get up,” Hermione whispered with a yawn, setting herself down on the footstool across from the rocker.
Since he had no plans to continue surviving, Draco had thrown himself into a dangerous and reckless lifestyle. He went to the club every night that week, drinking until he was close to blacking out, then taking home the first thing he found. Diego, however, had refused to leave him alone the night he’d found him in the bathroom, passed out on the floor. He kept trailing around after Draco, shoving water in his hands until Draco had given up and gone home. Diego had followed him home, and slept on the couch the entire night.
“So, when I said, ‘see if you can find the plates’, you heard, ‘spend time setting up a set of fairy lights while Draco negotiates the bedroom furniture with the movers’?” Draco said with a smirk.
“First of all, you want to be the one to try and test that? Remember that time I said you were jealous? I wonder how you would feel if you discovered you were
doing magic? I’m just glad my parents are both…” He looked up at Draco suddenly. “Sorry. That was an awful thing to say. I...are you sure you’re still willing to do this?”
Draco sighed, dropping his hand and shoving his hands in his pockets. "You just seem different… not as carefree or something,” he explained. “As when we first met, I mean. Is it work?”
Technically, the gala was the last event he had to attend as Potter and Prose. His manager had set up the donation months ago, convinced that Harry needed the PR boost. At £500 a plate, he wasn’t sure how a fancy ass dinner in the Royal Botanicals was going to help his public image, but that was why he employed other people to do the parts of celebrity that he did not understand.
"I'm my experience, that may be uni in general. Do you ever wonder how the Muggles do it? Drink the way they do without potions?"
There was moonlight casting a faint warm glow through the rivets of the canvas, and Harry figured that, for those with better eyesight, it was likely enough to see by.
Draco took a sharp breath. “Want to just call this date one? I mean, we’ve already gotten the whole inappropriate public snogging out of the way.”
“Yeah, whatever. Listen, I’m going to go outside and light a fire. Get a snack maybe. You can do what you want.”
“Yes, fine,” Malfoy agreed. “Let’s stop this back and forth. I promise you, I regret most of what I did before age nineteen. Well, except maybe for the badges.”
"No, I would never suggest that. I don't want you doing this for anyone. I just want you to live again. Don't you want that?"
But Lucius, not a man of simple revenge, had crossed all the appropriate t’s. There was a letter from a Mediwitch declaring him of sound mind; there were three witnesses to the change in the will, one of whom was a blood relative—a distant cousin Draco did not remember ever meeting. The will was set in stone.
afraid. Something deep down in his core told him that he was in grave danger. Serious trouble. He didn’t feel like that often. Before he’d been kicked out, every report from the agency had included the phrase "reckless to the point of stupidity" and "ignorant of limitations, even in regards to personal safety”.
you were sleeping with someone," she'd squealed, despite his protests that it was far more complicated than that.
It wasn’t, but there was nothing to do about it, especially as Buckbeak crouched low and then leapt into the air, the baby unfurling its own wings as it gripped tightly. Just as it had every year for the past five, Draco’s stomach gave a joyful lurch, his ears ringing with the sudden exhilaration. The wind whipped and tore at his face, but he tucked it lower into his scarf and grinned. Harry’s legs held his tighter as he gave a whoop of joy. He felt the same, but apparently, this year, his emotions demanded silent awe and the prickle of tears.
“I just ran into him in Diagon and...well, okay, I sort of followed him, but the point is, he knows.”
“I don’t have your history with them. Not from school, not from the war. Oh, sure, I knew your family. But what good has that ever done for anyone? I have pages of my family tree I’d sooner burn. So hear me now, Draco Abraxas Malfoy. I knew something was wrong. I’m angry at you. Furious. And I want to protect Harry. But, I
“Draco, no offence meant here, but...is there something I can do for you? Only, I’m really busy this weekend. Got to get all the plants under stasis before the frost.”
He was promptly leaping back in pain as sharp, blue flames lapped at his skin. Swearing, he drew his wand and tried casting a variety of spells on the box. Detection, anti-dark magic, release; he tried everything that wouldn’t destroy the box, but the blue flames remained.
Oscar cleared his throat and said, “They were full of silly activities. Nothing too flashy, not super expensive, but always so much fun. We have space for that here. Could be like a funfair, with games and practice duelling for those of age. Snacks, of course. And you could have rides outside—course, we'll have to put a shield up in the area or whatever, but if you're selling tickets, there'll only be so many people right?”
"Pansy, enough," he said gruffly. "You're implication is unprofessional and untrue. Potter is a coworker whom I have managed not to murder."
. The ride to Kew had been uneventful, but pulling up to the gardens, Harry found car after car of semi-important people of the London elite. He’d now spent enough time amongst them that a few called his name as he exited the car, but he decided on a perfunctory wave rather than a stop-and-chat.
Draco smiled, but the expression was sad and broken. Harry reached out to smooth down his hair. He brushed a hand across his cheek.
"So, Draco, you going to tell us why he's still at your flat?" he muttered nonchalantly. "Theo texted us," he added apologetically.
“Alright, new plan,” he called above the wind. “Everyone change and put the brooms away properly, and I’ll supervise you in the Great Hall until your next class. If you’re quiet and respectful with your games of snap, I can probably even scare up some cocoa. An elf owes me a favour.”
“No rush,” came the unmistakably posh accent he’d been waiting for since the beginning of the year had revealed him sitting at the head tables. Neville chuckled and continued his task. His day was
Pansy and Theo’s flat had not changed at all. Which made sense. Despite how it currently felt, it really hadn’t been that long. Most happy people didn’t shift their lives all that much over the course of one season. He knocked a little too hard and found Theo behind it when it opened.
“You are almost as famous, amongst Draco’s friends,” Harry replied teasingly, the menace only apparent because Draco had spent so much time studying his hatred for Al.
As the months wore on, Harry got decidedly worse. He stopped trying to sleep at all, instead spending most nights wandering the house until passing out for an hour-long nap. He also stopped coming home from work at regular hours, preferring to be busy as long as possible. He took on case after case, offered to finish other people's paperwork, and when these things weren't enough, voluntarily filed things by hand, a job no one in the Ministry ever did.
“I have a question,” Harry said suddenly. Draco gestured for him to continue. “Why? Why are we friends all of a sudden?”
This thought helped him stop questioning his choice of button-up and cardigan, though, so he supposed it was for the best.
He looked at her, waiting for her to go on. Her face was scrunched up in that ‘I’ve been thinking too hard about this’ way. “There are ways I'm supposed to be feeling too. Maybe I should be yelling at you not to let him back into your life, to run in the other direction,” she continued. “But I’m not going to.”
“Ow,” he said sheepishly. “Fine. Maybe a little? But only because...Hermione, you didn’t see this kiss.”
In three years, not much had changed. The music stands had moved corners again because Al hated them and was constantly trying to get them out of his line of site. They’d acquired a double bass at some point and it was precariously pinned to the wall just waiting for someone to buy it. It still had the faint glow of terrible lighting, the smell of dingy old strip mall, and the promise of possibility that was synonymous with the place.
“This has to stop,” he said suddenly, whirling around on Harry who had the decency to look surprised for a moment. It was when his face relaxed, however, that Draco knew just how screwed they both were. Harry nodded slightly and sighed.
Malfoy sighed dramatically. “Second-year theory papers,” he groaned. “They’re dreadful. I have no idea why I even set them. They’re unnecessary.”
How could he have been so stupid as to believe that they didn’t know where he was? That they hadn’t been watching? That they didn’t know where he lived, and what he did, and… and
The boxes were piled in the centre of the room, where they’d been since they’d been delivered by the moving company. There were no case files, which was comforting. They’d been picked up by a young, blonde witch with a natural air of authority who would have been Harry’s type in a former lifetime.
Like a terrible play where you can already see the ending, Enter DRACO MALFOY. Harry could still clearly remember the conversation from that day, almost word for word. They’d had their boots off, trading Quidditch magazines ver another cuppa that none of them needed, and Ron had looked up to see a blond, scowling head wander quietly into the room to fill his own mug.
Harry knew right away that he had to get craftier. For the rest of the week, he found reasons to go down to Magical Law Enforcement and Containment; sometimes, he hand-delivered memos that should have been sent by charm. Other times, he pretended to be inquiring about a former case with one of the officers who had filed the paperwork. Once, he brought the entire department coffee, complete with cranberry scones he had bought from the fancy bakery. That particular act had cinched it. It signalled the end of the careful, guarded observing that Malfoy had been using as his defense mechanism.
Potter didn’t offer compliments. Potter didn’t praise him or help him, or as a rule, act in any positive way toward him. It threw him for such a loop that he spent the next hour with a coloured pencil in his hand that never touched paper. He just watched Potter, for far longer than was likely appropriate.
Ron and Hermione, best friends that they were, had been very calm about his decision not to enter the Air Force. They had no right to be calm about anything at all. He’d told them in a terrible way. At their leaving tea, with all their teachers standing around holding flutes of champagne, all of them dressed in the fanciest Dress Uniforms that their posh private school could imagine. It had been the entirely wrong time to blurt out that he had, over the last two weeks, changed the entire trajectory of his five-year plan.
Draco burst out laughing. Before Harry’s offended expression could transfer into angry words, Draco shoved his hair out of his face and sat heavily in his chair. “Harry, do you ever wonder if you and I are linked by some sort of bizarre, universal thread?”
“Hi, Hare!” Pansy called, rushing down from the second floor of the old Victorian. She was in her stocking feet, but her coat was on and a scarf was slung around her neck.
Harry let the frustration he had been feeling well up. “Yeah, well, be that as it may, I don’t know Draco, and you and Pansy can just stop claiming that I am somehow the answer to this problem. He’s your friend. Just tell him.”
"Well, maybe, but that's not a bad thing,” she argued. “Once they see how fun it is, they'll stay anyway. Gosh, I am excited to duel again. Who would have thought?"
“Well?” she repeated when he didn’t reply, holding the ice she’d given him against his face. “Any thoughts?”
"I don't know that I've done much of anything, really,” Harry remarked. “Although, the Aurors are certainly seeing much more of you lately."
"We start by going forwards. Come on," Harry gestured. They'd reached the high street and Harry grabbed his hand and pulled him along.
“Go. See. McGonagall. I’m not doing this with you right now. Not without witnesses,” Malfoy sneered. He spun on his heel and stormed away.
“He just uses the pen for the takeaway cups, but he draws really awesome designs. I’ve wanted to get a couple of them permanently inked,” Diego laughed. “Go on, Harry. He’ll get a kick out of it.”
In that week, he also moved some investments around and cashed out some royalties so that he could pay Gloria handsomely to stay his ‘manager’ and de facto personal assistant until the end of the year. Although he knew it wouldn’t be fair to keep her after that much time, he’d grown incredibly used to someone else running his life for him and he wasn’t quite ready to give it up. Since, he reasoned, she’d seem ecstatic when he’d asked, he was going to put his guilt away for a little while.
“He told you about the bank thing?” Pansy replied sharply. “Merlin, he really did trust you, didn’t he?”
He tried laying down beside Draco and forcing himself to sleep, but he just couldn't. Giving up, he padded as lightly as possible down to the bathroom. He cleaned up his earlier mess, then went to the cabinet.
He crawled into the bed, into the soft white duvet, and closed his eyes, putting the list away again. These weren’t
The street was dead and lifeless, save for the few vendors who did morning wares; the coffee carts, the woman selling the handknit broom covers for winter riding (which he’d almost been tempted to buy, simply because it looked like a giant, broom shaped tissue box with a spot for your hands to tuck into and hold on. January lesson game changer. He’d come back to that later, depending on whether or not he could convince himself he didn’t care how ridiculous it looked). He stretched his arms above his head and yawned in the refreshing morning air. Being out of bed had definitely been what he needed.
Finally, he found his breaking point and pulled his owl, Artemis, from a deep slumber, much to her fury.
Before he could stop himself, Draco snickered. The man looked at him questioningly as he approached. “Not usually,” Draco explained. “He’s not generally a fan of people…"
“I just don’t want you to...regret me. Don’t. This isn’t how you—you know I want this too. I think you’ve known I want it longer than I have. I just—”
The three of him just stared angrily. He sighed and pushed on. "I don’t know how or why, but it feels like we are all in danger. So, at the very least, I want to know why we are here and who the
Despite his frustration and confusion, Harry grinned as Draco sprang out from under the covers, clad in one of Ron's far-too-large PJ sets and utterly flustered. Flustered Draco was rare. It was also Harry's favourite.
. I can’t talk to you because every time I try, you smile or you chuckle,” Harry whimpered. “You make a lame quip or you get frustrated about some tiny, stupid thing.”
Reasoning that it was after two, he decided to sneak into the room and just grab a pillow. Whoever was in there was asleep, anyway. Was it a problem that the door creaked significantly when opened? Maybe. Was it an issue that Harry was not the stealthiest of people? One could argue yes. But pillow? Worth it, he thought.
“Follow me?” Harry stammered, stopping in his tracks. “Who’s following me? Hermione, are there people following us?”
And so that, as they say, was that. That was it. One night that started a train of similar nights; evenings with a strange tone of friendship, which eventually led to dinner, and a walk to see deer in a park because Draco had never seen them. Coffee by the Thames one Wednesday just because. Small, insignificant moments that became less insignificant in tiny intervals that neither of them understood.
“I have no money. We can’t get married.” The complaint had been to Pansy, not Harry. Harry would just brush him off in the way of the rich who didn’t know how rich they were. Draco had been that person. He knew what the feeling would be. Pansy understood.
“Well, I mean,” Ron said reasonably. “At least then it’d be dealt with, wouldn’t it. Whatcha reckon, Harry?”
Draco let a month drift by, doing nothing more than stopping in for lattes as though nothing had changed. Unfortunately, the more time he spent
Harry and Ron had quickly disappeared into the house, Hermione remaining at his side until Arthur came and took Rose from her arms. She squeezed his hand gently and smiled sadly before she, too, left him in the entryway.
Hurrying up the stairs, he was pretty sure he knew what awaited him in her office. Sure enough, as the gargoyle spun out of the way, he was attacked in an enthusiastic hug that only lasted a second. His head was swiped a moment later.
But Draco knows only the important part is the disastrous reality that if Harry Potter is capable of being attracted to men, as this first authorised biography would suggest, then Draco is even more pathetic than he was before. Because if there is a possibility of Draco's exhausting little crush being reciprocated, then the fact that they have been fighting even more than normal, and not just on the pitch, just becomes hopelessly depressing.
Potter jolted but then lifted his shoulders in a shrug. "Was waiting for you to pick your room. The specs suggest one is slightly bigger."
“Draco,” he called, more deeply than loudly, hoping that his tried and true ‘I’m Harry Potter’ teacher voice would be enough to cause him to pause.
“Are you alright?” Draco asked, not sure if his tone was aiming for concern or mocking and therefore falling flat.
He shoved Draco lightly back into the cafe, where the music had been turned down, and where Bridget had disappeared. Except for the old couple who always sat in the back with crosswords and tea, he was alone and staring at the stupid, clueless facial expression of a completely confused Harry Potter.
“I have a much better secret,” Harry whispered, leaning in a breath more as Draco drew in a breath that he did not release. “You have incredibly wonderful forearms.”
He rested his head against the cool wood of his front door for a moment before fishing out his keys with a sigh and resigning himself to having to go in if he was going to be able to take off his overly-warm jumper and shower.
Draco paused here, but Harry didn't think it was for impact. It was like Draco needed a moment to recommit to his speech, collect himself. He gave a small nod.
His father’s death had been even less anticipated. No one was able to tell them what had happened; Azkaban, never known for its care of prisoners, rejected any attempts at blame for the illness that had taken him within a week. They had apparently real medical reports that showed the tumour in his spine growing at an alarming, unnatural rate. Draco honestly didn’t care.
“Harry, mate, you know you’re my best friend and all, but I think we need to draw the line at kinky—”
“Relax. We both know this is the right choice. Admit it, I lasted longer than you thought I was going to.”
"Call her he insisted she can help explain. You have your free will back, Carl. Use it to get some answers."
It took a moment, but Draco’s face broke into a smile and he laughed a little bit too before turning to Harry in irritation. “Not what I meant, idiot. I just...I have roommates. And we leave the doors open. It helps when I can hear people.”
Harry laughed. “Abe, my friend, you know I’d be honoured, but you barely know me. And I know none of your friends. Besides, isn’t a bit late to be adding people to the wedding?”
Draco took a deep breath and rolled his eyes, before he turned around. "Weasley, what are you talking about?"
Yes, this does fill the need to be out of control, but there is also this ache which stops hurting when you are the focus of his attention. You don't mind that that he doesn't feel the same, that for him it is only wanting you, but hardly the way you want him. This way it is safe, this way it can go on forever without becoming complicated, without becoming dangerous. Sometimes you just have weak moments when you realise that he never undresses for you, never is naked with you and you wish he were. You wish to see him, so that you can fantasise even more. But those things only matter in the back of your mind and are only heard in weak moments when you wish for impossible things.
"He should focus on other leads and leave the in-house work to me. That is, after all, the rule I set up with his team," Harry fumes.
“I love you,” Harry replied, because suddenly he couldn’t remember when he said it last, but it was too long ago, and Draco needed to know; he needed to say it now.
And just like that, as your hands start to move on their own, you know again why things are that way. Because you are Potter and he is Malfoy and it only makes sense in this room. Because in the light of the day it would never work. Because to the world you are the perfect hero just waiting to settle down, and he is the enfant terrible, of whom everybody has a certain respect, while also cutting him whenever possible.
For the last couple of years, he has told himself over and over again, that maybe Draco is just not the guy who makes friends fast. As far as Harry knows all the friends Draco has, he has known since early childhood.
"Not the Zabini branch, though if Blaise were to fall for a Muggle-born he would marry her as well. It's not like the Zabini family doesn't have multiple marriages with Muggles in their lines, they just never advertise it. For the Malfoy's, a Muggle-born would not do, but there might be one or two half-bloods on the tree, certainly on outer branches," Draco explained.
And with that, he picks up speed, making your body shiver a bit. But only a few thrusts later his orgasm hits him, making him come buried deep inside you, his head hidden in the crook of your neck.
This is also what the curse grants you: comfort in your own body. You don’t feel awkward or worried about the things that normally make you so uncomfortable, like your scars, the knobbles of your knees, or that you are not as steady on your feet as others seem to be.
By now, you are well adapted to his mood-swings. You have learned to read them from the most minuscule gestures. Sometimes you can’t help yourself but be amused by the snit he is acting out; or the arousal when he acts all oversexed and lewd.
"Please," you beg, working against the spell to get control of your vocal chords, to get what you need.
"Being a mate is what I am, so please, if you have to go in, make sure to mention that I did warn you," Weasley said before he went away again.
Easier because when you come here, step out of that fireplace and feel the spell settle upon you, it is effortless to do what he says, to follow his lead, to obey his every command.
His face is so close to yours that his breath caresses your face. There could be a kiss without both of you having to move that much. And for a moment you hope, but you aren't surprised when he moves back up again and starts moving.
"What should be wrong? Nothing is wrong, everything is perfectly fine. When Parker returns, tell him I want a word with him," he snaps before he turns around, stomping away. It might not have been his best idea to throw the door shut with as strong of a push as he does, because as the window smashes, the silence on the outside of his office is even greater than inside. As he turns around, he sees Ron, fixing his window with raised eyebrows.
You are unashamed when warmth spreads through your body, arousal in its wake. You stand up fluidly as soon as Draco moves his arm to dictate for you to do so.
You hear the movement before you notice Draco stepping closer. Your hand is still fucking you way too slowly, not giving you what you want or need.
Draco was also a romantic, and a cuddler, not that Harry ever was stupid enough to mention that one out loud. Sometimes he was up for joking and silliness, and Harry enjoyed it all.
Yes, yes you are. You need it; need him to fuck you. But you cannot word it, cannot beg him for mercy. You can only let your hand slowly move the dildo in and out. Devastation! Or maybe torture would be the better word for it. And he has to be aware that he is torturing you. Aware that today there is a need that you are aching to be fulfilled.
Realising that you never thought about why he is still using his wand at all, you let your thoughts drift away.
And you like it. You like being called a 'good boy', a 'well behaved pet', a 'fantastic cock-sucker'. Like the way he puts your behaviour into words that make something inside you go wild.
There was a slight puff at the end of the sentence, that Harry knew meant Draco was annoyed because they had not yet done, what they said they would. Draco didn’t like it when scheduled things weren’t finished on time. This time however he also couldn’t really complain at Harry for the delay. They’d spent yesterday in bed like horny teenagers, making up for the last two weeks when their love life had been sacrificed for other things. One thing had led to another and breakfast in bed was well deserved in Harry’s opinion. It was due to their circumstances that Draco had rewarded him with a slow ride, the way Harry enjoyed the most: unable to move, out of control, at Draco’s service, as his mate moved ever so slowly above him, sometimes hard and fast, and sometimes slow, taking Harry in inch by painful inch.
After the toy falls off somewhere, your hands go back to your behind, and as you push your feet more into the mattress to lift your hips from the bed, you spread yourself open, for him to see, but also for him to take.
"You would do anything just to get fucked, wouldn't you? I don't even have to order you, I could frame it as a question and allow you to act the way you want, and you would do it, without hesitation."
"He is in a foul mood, broke the glass of his door, made two secretaries cry, and has junior-Auror Patterson close to a nervous breakdown. Don't know what happened, but he is in a truly foul mood," Ron replied looking a uncomfortable with what he was saying.
However, right now it doesn’t matter. Right now, you are his and in a way that makes him yours as well.
This is something you can only get when you come here, to him. Your arrangement with him gives you the freedom to act in ways nobody, not even yourself, would expect or allow you to act.
"Apparently the case you assigned him to has a potion connection. You are reading your team's notes, right?" Ron asks, looking at Harry with a bit of shock.
Before there can be any more thoughts on how and why you come here, there is the soft touch of cold fingers on your neck and a whispered
“Oh, no, surely you didn’t. Forget it Potter, I know that look, and it is not going to happen. We have a tree to decorate.” Draco sat up, stretching slowly. The feathers adorning the sides of his face, his lower arms and legs and around his hips all the way to his bellybutton, outlining the small paunch that had grown there over the last months. gleamed in the afternoon light, making Harry’s fingers itch once again.
Draco got the feeling that he was missing something important like nearly fifty percent of a puzzle. The thing was, he had never known the pieces were there to begin with.
At least it is satisfyingly longer than the first one. You know it will reach deep enough to at least hit the spot you really want to be touched, even if the width of the thing is unsatisfactory right now.
Putting first your hands, then your knees on the bed you slowly crawl towards the headboard. With every movement along the way, you can feel those burning eyes on your body.
"Well, why would you? Though, certainly you were invited to Parkers engagement party? He adores you, though he thinks you doubt his capabilities." Draco shook his head.
However, as it is in the middle of summer, the last ball is in the distant past and the next one isn't even in your schedule yet, so there is very little you could have done to piss him off. Of course, there still is a chance that he might be pissed off, because it is easily done. And sometimes he just acts that way because he can; because he wants to.
For ten years, he has been trying to get close to Draco. And, in some way he believes that he is some sort of friend to Draco. Not the good kind of friend, not the tell you all my secrets friend, certainly. But, at least once a month he manages to get Draco to agree to a pint at the pub. Harry believe that to mean something, like a friendship forming.
It was a mean game, and it was meant to be mean in more than one way. Asking you why you come here when the reasons are most likely obvious to him. But it is also that circumstance which allows you to get what you want.
The wild panic in the man’s eyes as he returned to the land of the living was sickeningly gratifying, and Harry didn’t even bother trying to deny himself that; he’d had a very long year. He allowed the macabre glee that flared in him as he recognized fear. He’d examine that later.
did you want to stagger your way there through a series of miss-timed jumps? To a place you've never been, in a city you don't know? Come on, Potter. I swear I won't bite. Or hex. Or whatever it is you are convinced I'm going to do."
“I know,” Harry said gently. “I...maintain my previous offer, you know. If you want to...check. If it would help. If you need it to just be…a thing you check.”
Draco was still looking at the gift when the panic washed over him. He put it gently on the table and stood up unsteadily. He was on the back porch before Pansy caught up to him.
“Well, look at that. Seems you have far better luck with baby hippogriff than you do adults, apparently,” Harry laughed. “Think we still get to go?”
Harry looked at Draco, his hair in disarray, his pyjamas sagging. It was an image not many people had seen; or at least, that had always been his assumption. He nodded.
Also, most of the people have no right to stare at him the way they do either. Ogling him up, even when Harry is right next to him. Who do they think they are?
Begging is your last resort. Lust is making its way through your body, and all you want is release. You need release, because then you may be able to be yourself again, to leave this room and face the world like you do every other day.
There is a small chuckle from Draco and you let your eyes jump to his face. Though, instead of saying anything more, he just smiles at you and raises an eyebrow.
Now that you are appreciating such things, not only on him but also on others, you have also started to dress with more care yourself. You like how a good suit makes you feel ready for the next meeting, with the added bonus of wearing your robes open.
Yet, coming here ad seeing the familiar sight already calms your nerves, and you dare to take a deep breath and relax a bit.
"So, here is your report. Your guess was right, you will be pleased to hear, but now I do have to go back to work," Draco said on his way to the door. As he opened it, he turned around one more time. "And Harry, let the juniors do the menial tasks again, and don't forget my tea when you come back down to annoy me," he said before he finally left the office.
"Please fuck me," you add for good measure, as his lips hover over your face, and you are finally able to see those amazing gray eyes up close.
Surprise fills you at the lack of shock you feel at the mere suggestion, as you lean down to remove your socks. Rather you find yourself intrigued. How would he teach you? What would he make you do? Which poses would he enjoy seeing you in? Could you make him lose control with the right movements?
And just like he said he would, he takes you hard, deep and slow. Each thrust perfectly aimed to arouse even more.
You carefully pick up the harness before you turn around and move in front of Draco's chair. You sink to your knees and present it with both hands as you were ordered to do a long time ago. It is an order you have heard so often that it stuck with you. And so, it comes easily now, and feels natural. No longer is there twitch or any oddness when you sink on your knees for him. Quite the opposite: you have come to relax in this position as it means he will take care of you.
There is a long suffering sigh from behind you before Draco drawls: "One day, I shall teach you how to do a strip- tease so that watchers, or in your case I, are able to enjoy the show as much as the view."
"Maybe something new came up. Have to praise the guy, not many juniors like to talk to Malfoy," Ron says.
Your body moves in rhythm to the pushes and takes you along on the ride. Your muscle relaxes easily and soon your moans go from satisfied to needy again.
stupid, you acted like a buffoon. So, will this year be the year when you finally get your act together and ask me?" Draco had to fight his instinct to tap his toes, but allowed himself to cross his arms.
It is only now, with the thought of release in your mind, that you feel the hot pulse of your cock, which is straining in its cage. And oh what a horrible yet titillating feeling that is.
“I seem to recall last year, beneath the tree in the gleam of the fairy lights… you know I would like to do that again.” Harry grinned pulling Draco’s hand up to his mouth to kiss it hungrily, letting his tongue caress the knuckle.
You are so full with him, and it makes you feel not only the physical tingle of finally getting what you want, but feel so much more.
You come here because you feel safe with him, feel safe in the knowledge that he will take care of you, and give you what you need, even if it isn't how you imagine it would be. You come here to be you, and not have to live up to any sort of image others have of you. So, even if it is torture and you have to endure it, you want to feel him inside you. Feel the weight and girth of his hard, perfect cock as it is being pushed inside of you in the most satisfying way, rubbing against all the right spots, making you feel alive.
"That is quite a body count for everybody's darling," Draco said, rather impressed. "But out of everyone, you most of all know that he has a temper. So really why are you stopping me and not the others?"
Draco pins you to the bed with his hot glare and moves between your legs. Slowly, sensuously he opens his fly, sending a shiver from the end of your spine to the other.
At the moment, though, what with carrying their child in him, he was unable to hide his Veela-features. It was a fact that Harry enjoyed far more than he should, for two reasons: the beak and claws were horribly sharp and, currently a flare of Draco’s natural temper made them come through, and, secondly, the fact that Draco was miserable over all of it. Getting him to rest, to relax, took a lot of coaxing from Harry.
"I shall show my gratitude and hinder George to make an experiment tester out of you, but that is all you get, ferretface," Weasley shouted after him.
This isn't enough, not deep enough, not touching you the way you liked to be touched, not spreading you in the most satisfying way. It's not
“We said we would put up the tree this weekend, and it is Sunday afternoon. The weekend is nearly gone.”
"But you were laughing with him, you were bumping his shoulders, you never do that with me," Harry said defensively, finally standing up, because he apparently didn't like being talked down to.
But where you turn a blind eye, and ignore the truth that is strangling you, he will be consider what is happening and use his sharp mind to his advantage, as he always does. And, for once, you can’t afford to get the short end of the stick. Some secrets have to stay secret.
Harry was aware that he should worry as well, but he wasn’t. Draco would never hurt their child, and he didn’t mind the jealousy.
Only when your body begins to move does your brain try to catch on. The last thing you notice is the yet again raised eyebrow and a slight frown, before you turn around.
He loathes you for that. You feel it in the burning stares he throws at you when you turn around to shake yet another official's hand. And if you dare to overdo it, he will make you pay, sometimes to your relief and sometimes to your utter dismay.
The command, softly spoken into your ear, settles easily. As it does so, the knots and tingles in your body loosen up or vanish and you feel carefree, the weight of your responsibilities lifted.
"But I don’t want to annoy you. You joked with Parker so easily, but you are always so stiff around me, and we always argue, and-"
You are able to catch that comment most likely by design. It was meant to cut. And it did, though not deep enough to hurt. It was just enough to make you aware of your pride, your ego; your likeliness to lie to yourself.
A loud moan escapes your lungs as some sticky fluid appears between your fingers, slowly being rubbed on your nipples. The sensation alone makes your hips jerk. Although whether it is due to the cold feeling or because he has the power to drive you insane without even being close to you, you don’t know.
Softly, Harry leaned closer and brushed a kiss against Draco’s temple before he moved back again to caress Draco’s body. The pregnancy was neither planned nor wanted. They both still struggled with the thought of having a child, of giving up what they had together, making room for someone else. But at least he felt a bit of joy and excitement. He saw it as a new adventure, and a family of his own - he had at least always wanted that.
“I…” Potter hesitated and inhaled sharply. He pushed an unruly fluff of hair out of his face and then his whole body seemed to collapse into itself. “I’m sorry, I don’t know what’s wrong with me. I just feel so discombobulated. Which is ludicrous. We’re
Harry smiled gratefully. In the midst of everything in the spring, George had been uncharacteristically quiet. He’d bustled around taking care of the trivial things and gently finding out what Harry needed. While Ron and Hermione fussed, George cared. In the long run, he’d appreciated both, but he’d definitely gained a friend.
“Harry!” Ginny shouted, rushing forward to try and break the tall man’s fall as he crumpled to the pavement. “What the hell did you just cast?!”
“I know how I’m supposed to be feeling. I should be furious. I should be saying things like ‘how can I ever trust you now’ and ‘I’ll never be fooled again. But…” He trailed off with a sigh. “Hermione, what the hell am I supposed to do?”
“Only then, Diego comes in here the next day saying you two had split, and he didn’t even seem that upset, which felt... wrong. You two were so... I don’t know, perfect. It made sense, the two of you.”
Draco and Harry had so quickly become inseparable that they didn’t have time to question the wisdom of it all. When people challenged him, Harry argued that since everything between them had always been irrationally intense, it made perfect sense that a relationship would be the same. It was hard to explain that to people who had only known Draco as cartoonishly evil, the cause of all annoyance for six years, the source of real concern for the final year that mattered. At the time, Harry hadn’t been able to correlate that with the man who stood before him now, all soft edges and whispered jokes and vulnerable affection. That was really the problem; his friends were on the
“I’m going to help you,” Draco sighed. “You’re clearly useless at this particular skill set, Auror Potter, and I would like to go home at some point today.”
voice, he immediately attacked. It wouldn't win him any points with her, but he was too keyed up to care.
“And my finances and personal documents,” Draco whispered, genuinely afraid of what was coming next.
If Harry had all the information, he'd never be standing across from Draco in any space. He'd never gain trust again.
“Why do I know this place?” he whispered, not at all sure who he was talking to. “I...this just...I think I’ve been here before.”
The day he carried the last of his work into the publisher, it was a week until Samhain. Draco was typically morose; this time of year always made him homesick, which always made him angry at himself. He missed his stupid family bonfire and the party, and he missed Hogwarts Halloween just as much. He felt a distinct self-loathing that those things were true. He was, unsurprisingly, in a foul mood that was not helped by the October drizzle that had descended upon London.
“Why?” Harry mused, genuinely confused. When Draco just looked away, he shook his head and headed toward the tent. “As long as you promise not to attack me, I think we'll be fine. Come on, let’s do it now. Then you should try the spell one more time. Make sure it wasn’t a fluke.”
"Well, I think it's brilliant," gushed Hermione as she read aloud in the middle of the living room one evening.
Draco knew he was speaking very quickly and he wasn’t entirely sure why. Was he fighting to go? Or was he fighting to stay? He literally didn’t know. The expression on Potter’s face seemed to suggest that he didn’t know either.
Harry suddenly looked directly at Draco and beamed, and the expression was so out of the blue that Draco froze for a moment. In all their history, he had definitely never been the recipient of a full-blown Potter smile. It was certainly disarming. He suddenly felt like he was part of a very secret club he'd never realised he wanted to join, and he felt quite out of breath for some reason.
it didn’t exactly end well. But does that mean I have to now ignore him forever? That hardly seems charitable.”
he bothered by Draco’s presence? He’d studied him for three more days until, annoyed, Draco had put an end to that.
Harry panicked. “Every-I mean, I’ll usually find some friends inside and stuff but…fuck, Draco, sorry, I didn’t mean to imply this was like…a group thing?”
family, then he is. Or if you need us to be furious and never speak to him again, that’s what we do.”
“Yes, exactly,” Harry whispered menacingly, continuing up the stairs and motioning for the girls to follow. “Now, tell me
“It’s Poppy, actually. And yes, that sounds lovely. It’s glorious to meet you, Mr Potter,” she added, reaching out to help Harry up. “Thank you for saving Malfoy here. We’ve all been wondering when some bloke would finally make him sack up and get out of this hellscape.”
“I feel better. Sorry about yesterday. I think I was less prepared to leave home than I thought I was. It’s just…”
“You see, the problem, Zinnia, is that Potter has always forgotten the same thing about me,” Draco continued, reaching into the pocket of his scarlet edged robes as he stood up. He bent down and scooped up the kitten, who had already started trotting back. In his other hand, he held a familiar looking, pink, frilled piece of paper that was folded into a tiny square.
it. To just read what he wasn’t saying in the unseasonably warm, early June dusk. Harry hadn’t. He still didn’t.
Eventually, he'd just stopped fighting and let her decide he could 'keep his secrets'. It would be much easier, after all, if he'd just made up with his finance and fallen into bed again. Impossible dreams and the like. Not for the first time in the past few years, he envied Amanda's beautiful simplicity; in her mind, despite the hardships her life had contained, things were still reasonable. There was grey between black and white, but it didn't have to contain quite as many shades. Muggle treachery was serious, he knew that. He saw it every day he spent at the shelter. The things people could do to each other knew no bounds. Evil and cruelty didn't require magic to occur, even between families.
There were days when Harry was engulfed by the misery of his current adult life; on those days, he had a hard time cutting himself any slack at all. Every single thought or action reminded him of his many failed attempts to even
Clasped against Harry Potter's forearm, however, his Apparating darkness was filled with some sort of - well, not light, not exactly. But certainly, it was filled with a
Harry truly wasn’t sure, since Crookshanks had almost ruined cats in general for him, let alone kneazles, but Neville insisted that the magical breed was far more docile when mixed, and far more intelligent than the average cat. Holding the tiny bundle now, who snuggled down beneath his cupped hands and almost immediately fell asleep with her pointy ears flicking gently, he had to admit he could try and let him be right.
Harry sighed loudly and pulled the cloak from his head, not moving from his cross-legged position on the floor. “You’re very irritating, you know.”
He waited on the bench, calmly holding the book, as Potter showered and emptied his locker. As he sat on his own bench, facing away from Draco.
For an hour an a half, Draco fitted brackets into holes and screwed strangely topped screws into even stranger places. The whole time, he chatted amicably to Potter and convinced him to tell Ron about the incident at the Ministry first thing Monday.
Harry opened his mouth to— do what, he didn’t know. “That’s your fault,” he said instead. “I want to do far more than kiss you when you are standing in front of me fully dressed for work. I haven’t been able to think since you showed me your costume.”
When he came back to the main room, where the tables were still set up for the Hufflepuff and Slytherin second years, he found Draco Malfoy sitting on the first row of desks, nonchalant and kicking his bloody legs. He looked like a pale, put-together toddler. A small child, that is, if Neville were capable of ignoring the casual ease of his sexiness; he totally understood the appeal Harry found there, though there were still many moments when Neville’s brain short-circuited in trying to work out how that much forgiveness had been found even in
But the sleeping potion was only slightly stronger than the ones Draco had been making him at home. Soon, he was taking twice as much as he’d been prescribed. He ruefully smiled at himself in the mirror on the second time he doubled the dose.
"Oh you know, a drink. Or a meal if we are adventurous enough?" Harry pressed on. "A walk, even. Somewhere other than the Ministry. You. Me."
Despite his very intentionally calm tone, Draco held his breath, bracing for the backlash. It was reckless to remind his father that he couldn’t actually
“Every time you open your mouth, it becomes even more obvious that you do not know my father. Does he still believe you’re a squib?”
“Yes, well,” Draco waved, nodding at Harry and looking meaningfully at Pansy. “Important things first.”
,” Draco said, pulling back to look at him straight on. Grey eyes and silver hair in the moonlight. Convictions and understanding, an inability to back down. A past and a present, a future they’d both secured. In other words,
Harry strolled out of the lab grinning. It wasn’t until he was halfway back to the emergency ward that he realised how badly he’d fucked up.
“I’m afraid that will be utterly impossible,” the goblin replied with a malicious grin. “Every advisor has been booked for
sitting around and talking to him all day, the more certain he became that he needed more from Potter. He just had absolutely no idea what he was supposed to do about it.
“Draco,” Harry replied calmly, proffering a large bag and picking one up from the porch where he’d evidently put it down. “Do you mind? These are heavy and I walked from the tube.”
“Are we going to keep pretending that the kiss from the first year of uni didn’t happen? Because we both know it did. And we both know your friends know about it.”
They sobered as the food arrived, Theo looking down at his plate of hot pie and his pint and holding out his hands. The others completed the circle silently and closed their eyes.
Resigning himself to needing to know, he slipped into the closest branch of his bank, just a few blocks up from the store. When he got to the teller, he handed over his card and swallowed down his panic as she frowned slightly and rescanned it.
“Harry,” she sighed. “Harry, Harry, Harry. Neville, even if he is questioning his sexuality or his marriage or whatever, is
“So, let me understand,” he said. “You aren’t asking for your job back? You aren’t going to...fight for your position, or something?”
“You said it, not me,” she grinned. She turned serious a moment later and for some reason, it made Draco stand up and face her.
The shop was rammed with holiday shoppers, but Harry’s grin remained firmly in place as he pushed his way through to the back room, where he knew George would be hiding and organizing while the younger employees took charge of the chaos. It had been Angelina’s only demand when they had expanded to the third store; during December, George took a step back and let other people run things. He actually seemed grateful after the first year, and he’d been much easier to convince ever since.
He watched the blond putter by the closet for a moment, putting things away, getting ready for the morning before he went to make dinner. The whole thing seeped in routine and normalcy, and it made Harry's heart swell happily. Clearly, he had just needed to come
in Paris; standing on top of the bridge, he’d managed a pretty decent shot of the water. The first time Harry had noticed it, he’d spun around to grin at Draco.
“It’s where you met him first. When we were eleven. Merlin, Harry. He used to talk about that all the time. It was in his
Harry didn’t show up to meals, never appeared in the staff room in his customary desperate-for-tea stupor, and didn’t turn up at Draco’s table in the library each night with a stack of papers and a silent presence that Draco hadn’t realised he had grown to appreciate. In fact, if it weren’t for his students claiming otherwise, Draco would have been convinced that Potter hadn’t returned from the break at all.
“Would. You. Shut. Up!” Draco shouted as he entered. “It’s bloody Saturday, and I’m pretty sure you’re even keeping the owls awake.”
The words — the first Draco had ever spoken to him — leapt unbidden to his mind. How did he remember that? He was not the sort to remember trivial details or sentimentalities. The boy that had said those words had disappeared long before Draco had ever even entered his life fully. And yet, here they were, as clear as though Draco was standing here.
He observed for a week, carefully collecting anecdotal evidence. He quickly realised the story he’d been told was not exaggerated. He watched as the two professors would turn the opposite direction in the corridor to avoid walking past each other. They would sit at opposite ends of the staff table in the dining hall. Longbottom would rarely leave the greenhouses before dusk, and would always look around fervently before returning to his second-floor quarters.
"Harry, you don't call me 'babe',” Draco interrupted. “It's clear you've been taking that potion again. Please sit up. I need… we need to talk. Well. No. Actually,
"The issue, I think, is that I ideally need a loft… high ceilings, no room divisions, you know. But Mortecue, even the wider township, it's so small. There isn't much available."
Harry blinked, and it was almost Halloween; flying lessons were in full swing, stuck in the Quidditch pitch because he had decided they would be. DADA classes were hilarious and well-attended, loved by most students and giving Harry such peaceful sleep that he felt more rested than he had in years. The smallest of thorns in his side was that, no matter how hard he tried, he just kept
“Darling, we both know we’ve been done for a while. You deserve to be who you are really are, and we both know you can’t do that around me. You care too much about taking care of me.”
late. Not André late. Store-was-already-open, Grandma's-already-been-run-over-by-a-reindeer-twice late. He ducked into the back room and threw his apron over his jumper and went to fish his antlers out of the pocket.
"Or I'm done,” he said in a clipped, cool tone, interrupting Draco’s most recently constructed excuse.
He hadn’t seen Harry in months, and the last place he’d expected to run into him for the first time since that summer was in a pound shop on the high street of Wycombe on December 5th. He spared a thought for the fact that Harry looked
“Harry, it’s none of my business, but you know I can’t tell you anything about other clients, right?”
spending time around Draco. They had very little in common, but found ways to stretch out hours of work in comfortable silence. Draco liked watching the teams practice and Harry soon started inviting him to fly, leading a team through drills and generally helping with the coaching. Being two of the youngest professors at the school was difficult, and they both seemed to realise at the same time that they could treat each other as allies. It was strange and much was left unsaid, but decades of experience and hate turned out to be easier to bury than either had expected.
He surveyed the flat as surreptitiously as he could and found it in much the same state it had been that morning.
“For a little bit. But is that worth giving up what is being offered? A second and third attempt, a chance to just be happy?”
Harry’s head jerked up from his pile and he stared at both of them. Ron was splayed out in his seat, robes open and at ease. Draco’s legs were crossed at the ankle, casually possessing the surface of Harry’s desk like he’d always belonged there.
you, Malfoy!” she suddenly snapped. “Harry’s been here since Saturday and he made no mention of you.”
Draco watched the question flicker across Harry's face. He wanted to ask, he wanted details. He wanted to know what had happened here, but, it was just a second. He settled his features. He returned Draco's favour, and didn't ask follow up questions.
“Customer,” she called back in a slightly strangled voice. Appropriately curious and possibly a little concerned, Abe’s head appeared around the corner of the door.
“These things are adding up to strange, though, Draco,” Diego continued. “The tension with Harry. The scars. That word those people used... Muggle? What’s it mean? Who are you? Is it some sort of cult?”
They all stomp back to the change rooms in a neat line, always on display in the practice pitch. The reporters' clicks are audible even from a distance, and Draco has to fight the urge to run up and sheild Harry with his cloak; the sensation reminds him that the biography is sitting, blazing Harry's photo in full view, on top of his bag. His face heats with embarrassment.
what your little editor shoved you into? Or no, wait. You don’t ask questions, do you? Just butt your way in without invitation. You just go where you are sent. Always have.”
“Harry!” Neville yelped in surprise. He sighed, next, though, and Harry laughed, already anticipating what was happening.
“Mum. Dad. This is Harry Potter,” Draco said pointlessly, his voice firm and sure. “I know you know him, but. Penelope. This is my boyfriend. I’m sorry I haven’t introduced him to you until now.”
“You must move him so he is sitting with us,” Astoria implored, a hand on his arm in a possessive gesture that was very unlike her.
Theo had been an accident, truthfully. They’d slept together once, in a messy and ill-advised adventure in sixth year. When Draco found him in Diagon, begging on a corner and bruised from head to toe, it hadn’t taken more than a minute for him to offer half his savings. He had been raised in privilege and the number seemed large enough; he didn’t understand at the time how quickly they would burn through their resources, especially in London. When the money ran out, they’d both decided that going home was not a choice. They’d made their way North, fought their way into terrible jobs that did not pay rent and survived. Just barely, but survived.
“I’m not sure you know what this means,” Draco frowned. “If you kiss me now, we can’t go back. Even to the hate.”
for a very long time. I am smart enough to know that when the likes of Pansy Parkinson shows up unannounced and proceeds to occupy the time of my Defense teacher for the entire day, it is not going to be good for me to then ignore any request said teacher makes. We have three more days of term. It’s not a big deal. Go take care of what you need to, then have a good break, and I’ll see you in the New Year.”
“I’m in the middle of a class,” he complained, aware that Jordan Dawes was going to be completely incapable of helping him. Her hair was whipping wildly in the wind and she shrugged at him apologetically. “Alright, alright. Head back in. Tell her I’ll be up in five minutes, once I get these Hufflepuffs into the hall. If she can meet me there…”
He was pretty sure that working together did not include staring in desperation during interdepartmental meetings. It also probably did not involve watching for the familiar, beautiful, impossibly small adjustments everyone made: checking for changes in the set of his jaw, or the crinkle of eyes when he thought something was stupid. The unconscious brush of a hand against silvery blond hair, pushing it out of his eyes, just as Harry had once done for him. These things that he noticed were not something he was allowed to be doing anymore. They were not part of the amicable co-worker pact he had agreed to many months ago.
Largely because Harry was often left wondering what bell Draco had heard that had made him decide it was time to leave. Malfoy always left on his terms, and therefore, Harry never had the chance to stop the disappearing act he obviously had perfected. He wanted to stop him, to freeze Draco with the physical contact his body was now screaming for. As much as their conversations had opened up, that first touch on Harry's arm by the lift was the most Draco had allowed since, and he wasn't sure he could stand it much longer. Still, something gave him pause. Something made Harry leave it alone.
Draco chuckled. “Yeah, that’s a tough lesson to learn. In all this time you were helping me mark, you never thought to bring your own papers?”
"I do. So why can't I work here?" He knew he sounded petulant, and Collette was not going to let him get away with that for long.
“Nothing that bad,” Harry laughed. “But the Muggle owner who worked here got suspicious pretty fast about how I was managing to get everything done as quickly as I did. And then he started following me home and stuff. So, I sort of, um–”
“Search me, since you never talk about how you know each other, but it's definitely old animosity or something. What was it? Sports rivalry? Academic?”
Harry spent the next hour unpacking but found himself bored witless by half-ten, just as he had predicted. Making a split-second decision, he threw on his old house scarf and headed down to the lake.
Draco was leaning on the edge of the door in Hermione and Ron’s kitchen, technically, under the guise of ‘drying dishes’. He had the towel flung over his shoulder and everything. But since he’d just been throwing a spell at all the dishes Harry held up with his own wand, they’d settled into their current positions instead. Harry was perched on the countertop, avoiding Draco’s gaze.
"What? Date blokes? Guess you're right, actually. Wait!" Harry said, suddenly realizing something, letting his arms fall and standing straight up dramatically. "I don't actually know that you've ever dated anyone."
Hermione looked unhappily at the stairs to her right. "He actually isn't here. I promise you. He's at Neville’s today."
Bill smiled kindly. “That’s fine, Harry. Try me. If I can’t help, I can at least ask around. You’ve come all this way. School doesn’t get out until Friday, so it must be important.”
Harry, inexplicably, blushed and tightened his housecoat, before turning away and tossing a large stack of papers into an old leather bag. Without complaint, he followed Draco down to the end of the third floor corridor, through the hidden door in the tapestry, down the spiral tunnel, and out into the darker, cooler passage that led to his office.
"Harry, please. You have know me for how long now? Seventeen years at least, when we are counting Hogwarts. You must know that I am the arguing type. I enjoy it, and I especially enjoy arguing with you, like I presume you enjoy arguing with me. Its comfortable, relaxing and fun. Also quite beneficial, because I do not explode in the face of the morons I am forced to work with." Draco shrugged his shoulders.
Draco, on the other hand, struggled with his fear of turning into his own father, of repeating the same mistakes, and with the knowledge that he needed to raise his child to live up to Malfoy standards, but also to accept that their child would be half Veela. However Harry knew that was not all of it. He could feel it, the hint of jealousy. While Harry had no doubt that Draco would do everything for this child, it was too early in their relationship for Draco to share him.
A sudden movement of his wand catches your attention and distracts you from trying to figure out the meaning of the words.
Finally, your fingers do what you need them to do and pushing the toy in, making you moan in a delightedly. There is a slight edge to the pleasure. Not pain but still a throb that makes it all so much better. It makes it easier to focus on the pleasure.
You're pretty sure he doesn't need it any longer. You are good at wandless spells but only at what is generally considered the essentials:
“Maybe, if you behave, and I can move that way. Otherwise you will have to live with you on your back and me on top of you, but then, I seem to recall you didn’t mind it this morning, either.”
On dark nights, when you are not careful you dream about those hands all over your body. So you try to be cautious, because you can only come here so often before Draco will realise the truth, which you hide so perfectly from yourself.
"Please," you whisper, desperation now lacing your words, not only because you need more, but also because as your want to be satisfied is building, trying to take control, you can feel the spell slipping, nearly breaking, and fear of that happening creeps into your heart.
"What? No, you can't, he can't hold his liquor at all and gets really rude," Harry said before he stared at Draco. "You knew? You knew I was going to ask you?"
Stepping out of the floo, you are greeted with the same sight as always when you come here: black curtains - which you learned are of a dark royal blue - and an empty room.
"Listen to the obscene noises your body is making, as you are fucking yourself the way that pleases me," Draco says, letting his hands ghost over your chest while speaking.
Here you do not need to be the one in charge. Here nobody wants you to save them. Here you get what you
