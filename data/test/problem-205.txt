Draco was cruel. He had been cruel. He hadn't changed. Even if he regrets following in his father's footsteps, he wouldn't be able to do anything else if he could go back. Draco can't change. He knew he was horrid. He'd stay horrid.
"I want you to fuck off, Potter." Malfoy laughed, his eyes harsher than Harry had ever seen. He half-expected a stinging hex, but thought against pulling out his wand. "Why do you even want it? It's horribly unhealthy."
Harry supposed it made sense if Malfoy still thought he was scheming. He still wished he would've gotten to see Malfoy like he did last night, though. It really was a sight to behold.
"Like your mom," Harry nodded, he heard Malfoy's mom died not long after Lucius was sent to Azkaban. He didn't think she was a bad person, not like Lucius.
"Thank you." Dobby waved from Draco's leg, it was a perfect portrait of the elf. "He dropped a cake on my aunt's friend."
Harry woke up hungover. Sick warmth pooling in his gut as he tried to forget his dream. It wasn't the war, though. At least the ones with Malfoy were good before he woke up.
It was past lights out when Draco decided he would stumble out of the bathroom with Potter, Filch would catch them. They'd have to sleep on the concrete. Draco could conjure up a soft feather bed for them. His father had taught him how on the one occasion they'd gone camping.
"Potter, let me in your wards or I swear I'll tear down this entire wall," Draco shouted, breaking Harry out of his sleep. He walked to his bedroom door as Draco continued his annoying yelling, still shaking as he flung it open.
"Shame you weren't here yesterday," Malfoy shouted over the music, Harry felt the vibrations against his face.
"Right, well, I thought Nagini would have been tasteless."
He didn't bother changing his clothes, leaving the house in his joggers and t-shirt.
"But you hate me."
"Right," Harry sniffled again, disliking the new air of discomfort, and sat down to smoke his last cigarette, "I need a new pack."
"I think I feel the centaurs."
Malfoy's wand fought with the map's magic, Harry had picked it up again. His eyes instinctively found Malfoy's name.
Harry had to get him alone somehow.
"I'm not that stupid, babydoll." Harry laughed as he said it, it was ridiculous to call Malfoy that.
That wasn't expected. Potter was coming down, he was entirely in his right mind. He should be angry, enraged. He should hate Draco a thousand times more than he did before. Potter had no reason to be as friendly with Draco sober as he was when his veins were tainted. It was all so odd.
Harry came. Not bothering to clean himself before letting the alcohol and activities of the night take it's toll.
He was already fisting his cock, aching for release.
"I ha-" Draco let out a sigh, avoiding Harry's eyes as he inhaled a shaky breath, "I think I'm in love with you, too."
"I jus need a fag and I'll forget it again."
"Do you think there's actual ghosts in ghost peppers?" Harry hummed absentmindedly, his fingers reaching out to the packages. The Ritalin always made him so curious, the strange focuses were comforting- it felt more natural to see through fluorescent fuzz.
"Never cared?" Harry asked, is that how Draco saw it? All those years. Never cared? "Draco, I-"
"Thought you were too good for poisoned lungs."
Brian- or maybe it was Tyler?- was enthusiastic, utterly ecstatic. His flat was a dirty red and gold, Harry didn't pay much attention to it until Brian-Tyler had screamed his name as he came. His full name. 'Harry Potter' he had said. And Harry was quite sure he never told the guy his name.
"Really, Potter. Merlin, how people will talk. I'll give you one." Draco talked against Potter's neck, against one of the bruises he'd made knowing it would make Potter even more undone.
Harry's mouth went dry. He hadn't been back there since- he'd been avoiding it entirely. Nothing was even there anymore. What could Malfoy possibly be doing there?
Harry just remembered he heard Malfoy was gay a year or two ago, how could he forget that ridiculous headline in The Prophet 'Draco Mal-GAY?!'
If Draco had anymore clarity, he would've asked for it in signed parchment. But Potter very much insisted on being a slut. He was determined to make Potter feel like he was in the highest circle of heaven. No one tries to kill God.
Draco moved Harry's jacket to his lap, "I'll let you off this time, only because you almost died."
Draco made his journey down to the Great Hall, thankful the corridors were empty as he failed to contain his laughter. He almost believed Potter saw him. How preposterous.
"Oh, how the chosen have fallen."
"If you insist on being a slut, you can't decide I'm evil when you come down. You're not allowed to wake up and blame it all on me, it's almost entirely your fault. Understand?" Draco would've made him take an Unbreakable but he knew Potter well enough to know it would only be cruel.
Draco stood next to Potter, a meter away. Potter laughed and pulled him closer, mocking him for not knowing the parameters of a cloak.
"Moderately," Potter replied, smiling as he looked Draco up and down. The hungry eyes had returned.
"I should have gone to France, that sounds incredible." Harry sounded like he was yearning, the biting smile ever-present in his tone.
"You've got to be bloody joking. You're my protection detail? You can barely take a first year."
Potter laughed, twitching his nostrils as he adjusted to the feeling of the heroin. They did snog. Potter didn't get too overzealous. Draco was in deep shit.
"Malfoy, I know you're in there," Harry tried through the door after a minute or two of waiting.
"7. You were screaming."
"I'm not high anymore, I think."
Draco welcomed the hallucinations now, hoping for some sort of catharsis. Harry hated him- not outwardly, but Draco knew his look of malice. When he spoke at Draco's trial, he was just trying to be Golden Boy Potter. Trying to solidify his place as an upstanding citizen who couldn't bear to let a fellow student waste away in Azkaban.
Harry laughed, feeling his mind get a little fuzzy. Barely feeling the million little puncture wounds, he took off the jacket and tried to remove his shirt but his shoulders refused to move with him. Harry started to say something but his thoughts got fuzzed over as Draco pulled the shirt off of him.
"Harry, please, you have to have some sort of protection," Hermione pleaded, her hands almost tearing out her hair as they ran through it, he was really starting to feel a little guilty.  "You don't have to stay in the safe house but these radicals are serious, you know about the attack on St. Mungos."
Harry leaned against the bathroom door, not caring that it pushed glass shards deeper into his back. He didn't know where his lighter was. Maybe it fell when he apparated.
Harry had already smoked half of his fag, he stared at Malfoy for a long while as he let himself relax against the wall,  hot sparks of his magic hitting his neck but he couldn't be bothered to stop the burning. It was always a surprise to see Malfoy, he looked entirely different than his teenage self. His hair fell loose on his face, tattoos snaked up from his collarbones and his auror training had given him such a muscular build. Harry had only seen him a handful of times since he testified at his post-war trials, he couldn't get used to how much Malfoy had grown.
"Jus' need to sit down for a bit," Harry checked to see if his nose was bleeding before gesturing for the packs Draco was holding.
"Never pegged you for a classist, the fame's really gotten to you, huh?"
Draco whined. Harry felt his hands hesitate to touch. Maybe that was what he did wrong that night in the club, be gentle, caring. He pulled up above, a line of spit still connecting their lips. Cheeks flushed pink. Draco looked serene.
"Just fuck me. I'll get you out of my system. You'll be rid of me. I'll be rid of you."
"What are you even doing here?" Harry asked, "I can't imagine why you'd ever be in the vicinity of this many poor people."
It hadn't even been long enough to tell but Draco would miss him. He was destined for the unhappiest ending; at least it would be in bliss somewhere, drowning his sorrows and his guilts in collapsed veins. He focused on Potter. Pushed back everything. He would just kiss Potter. If he was always going to turn out a shit person, he may as well let himself have the simple pleasures.
"Mischief managed." He stored the map, trying to come up with the exact words to ask Malfoy.
"Heroin."
He didn't go home with anyone that night, resigning to lay awake in his bed. Thoughts tainted with the whiskey and the tequila of the night, along with the utterly intoxicating scene with Malfoy. His face stung where the bricks had scraped against it, his hands hummed with the memory of Malfoy's sweaty skin, his lips swelled and longed for more. He'd put on some music, not paying attention to the lyrics so much as the way it stirred his cock with fantasies.
"Incendio," he muttered to the cigarette between his lips, his hand shaking as he took a drag. The smoke comforted his lungs. Just like the pills comforted his fingers as he emptied six onto the bathroom counter. Glass pushed deeper into his skin as he moved, falling into the routine. A drop of blood fell onto one of the lines Harry had made, coagulating the powder in a sharp red. He had lost his cash. Rummaging through the cabinet until he found the metal tube he had pocketed from a muggle party, he wished he'd tried the cocaine he was offered there. Snot caught on his upper lip. He wiped it, making sure his nostril was clean enough for the ritalin to move straight through to his brain.
"Dobby." Harry stared, his voice was barely a whisper as his throat began to close up.
"I recall you saying you like to give." Potter giggled. He fucking giggled. Draco regretted ever getting the Golden Boy high. Regretted staying in the room. Regretted every decision he had ever made. Fuck it.
"A bunch of stupid terrorists, Golden Boy. You, of all people, should take Deatheaters seriously."
He thought about Malfoy far too much. It wasn't healthy, Malfoy had gotten him killed- just for a minute. Harry reckoned it was all the wand's fault. He still had it, always next to his own. Sometimes, when he used it, memories of Malfoy wormed their way into his skull. Harry used it on purpose, for that purpose. But he didn't like it.
Draco hated himself for it, but the potion he'd been using to supplement his lack of supply had been intense. Memories of Harry- Goldie- flooded his every sense. He missed Harry. He missed being babydoll. He missed being able to see Goldie.
"That was the bit I liked, actually. The bit that makes you a twat is dropping me in my room and waiting all day to check if I was still alive," Potter's words were angry, but he only looked defeated. Draco knew he would be craving.
His voice got a bit too breathy as his veins filled. Potter noticed, those moans were purely sexual. Draco knew this wasn't a hallucination, but how could it possibly be real.
Those feelings lingered into his highs, it took a while simply to forget it and let himself relax into the potion. He really missed heroin. Maybe on holiday he'd be able to get some. Or maybe he could go to some muggle street corner and try his luck. He'd have to find paper money. And muggle clothes. And get past the Hogwarts wards. It would be an ordeal.
Draco hadn't been careful enough, leaving a misshapen blood trail to the room of requirement. He should have known to use the cleansing charms, the color vitality, the stain removing, even the scent removing. Never, he had never made a mistake like this before. He had never left someone a trail of bloody breadcrumbs to his euphoria.
Harry stared at Draco. What the fuck was that question? Of course it mattered to him.
Harry jus hummed, inhaling the last of the smoke before standing, almost falling as his body adjusted. He held his hand out for Draco, their eyes met and Harry noticed how pretty those gray eyes really were. Harry had never really looked close enough at Draco's eyes, always shying away from them during school and harshly averting them after the trials. He could see the reflection of the sky in them, dark clouds on blue sky, moving so fluidly. It was beautiful. Beautiful until he felt the sharp ringing in his ears, glass connecting with his skin. He held the pill bottle tightly in his hand, careful  not to lose it.
"Another long one?"
It all sounded so genuine, he supposed he would play along. Compliance was much easier than having to think of ways to escape the inevitable ruin of himself, "My nose. Bleeds sometimes when I snort it."
Harry wasn't as drunk, the alcohol coming off in his sweat as he talked to Draco about pointless things. He was still drunk enough to ignore that Draco warranted his hatred.
Harry groaned, laughing as he tried to bring Malfoy back to him. Malfoy only palmed at Harry's cock harder and slipped around his body. He pushed Harry against the wall, his cock against Harry's ass as he kissed up the back of his neck. "Don't get cocky, Potter."
"I wasn't joking, Goldie. My impulse control is incredibly low, you have to stop moaning like a little whore." Draco stretched his legs out, crossing them. Potter was getting to him. Drugs were the culprit, those were what made Potter so unnaturally appealing. If his blood was pure, it wouldn't be rushing at the thought of Harry Potter.
He couldn't fall asleep that night.
Harry felt like he'd been squilched. His head was trying to burst apart. He could feel tiny glass shards underneath his skin, aching and foreign. Shaking. He was still shaking.
"Fuck, man. They have more security on Dreamless than the philosopher's stone had." Harry laughed, the laugh he had when he was biting his lip back.
"Fuck." The door opened to a half naked and dripping Draco Malfoy, "I was just going to get dressed and leave."
"I like Goldie."
Malfoy picked up the needle Harry had been aiming for, pulling the liquid into it from the saucer in Harry's hands. The invisible rope tightened around Harry's arm, making him let out a whine that Malfoy mocked. His veins glowed a sharper gold.
He joined, entirely too sober.
They stood there smoking for a while, not saying anything and simply observing the men who went in the club. Drunk, loud, rowdy.
Harry wanted to dance. He wanted to come up behind Malfoy, take his waist in between his hands, lick up from his collarbone to his ear and whisper something alluring. But he couldn't think of anything alluring, and he couldn't bring himself to move. His body was a cage, keeping him anchored to the side of the bar only allowed to watch as Malfoy let his lips drag across strange men. Their hands all over him, his hands all over them. It was just like Malfoy, to be the center of attention and be completely unbothered.
"Do what?"
Draco relished in the realization, letting himself relax as he allowed the calm warmth to resurface in his bloodstream. It was just a hallucination. Just another figment of shame.
Malfoy finally snuck away from the Great Hall during dinner, he would be alone. Harry went to follow him, ignoring the protests of Ron and Hermione. McGonagall would take off points but it hardly seemed important.
"The first one's supposed to last longer, Goldie." Malfoy's voice was soft, it vibrated against his skin. His hands were in Harry's hair, gentle. "If you start to feel like you got stomped on by a hoard of centaurs, then it's out."
Harry stopped outside the store, trying to catch up as time felt like it was leaving him behind. He realized he didn't eat.
Potter was chanting 'babydoll' and profanities in a forced whisper, his hands were close to pulling out Draco's hair. He was staying quiet. When Potter came down his throat, Draco swallowed it, resisting the urge to spit it into his mouth. Draco didn't think Potter was ready for that yet.
Harry didn't think about that.
The patronus he'd been summoning turned red, started running towards Draco with it's tail pointed forward. Draco waved it away before it could sting him. Scorpions weren't kind. They were actually kind of scary. Makes sense fate would make his patronus a devilish little bug. He was in the same range of evil.
"You're allowed to call me Draco, it is my name. I wasn't aware you actually knew it."
Malfoy didn't come back to the club the next night, Harry had gone home with some American on holiday. His friends were obnoxious, egging him on as they'd snogged on the dance floor. At least his hotel was quiet.
"I don't sleep much, Drakey," Harry laughed at himself, but he didn't try to say Draco's name correctly. He fell onto the floor, letting the candies fall around him. "Have a crunchie, I got them for you."
Gentle fingers ripped the tiny bits of glass out harshly, Harry didn't mind it. His body had gone into that comfortable overwhelmed state, only feeling the soft warmth the wounds radiated. Draco had moved all over his body, Harry had hardly noticed he was hard until Draco stopped everything.
"What, we can't be friends?" Potter was an idiot. It was in the ink that etched it's way through every layer of skin that made sure they couldn't be friends. He'd be killed if his father found out, if The Dark Lord found out. No, they couldn't be friends. So why was Draco following Potter into his room? Why was he pleased with it?
"Your tattoo, I didn't think you could see them."
"Don't act dumb, Potter."
"It's honeycomb toffee, you precious brainless thing. My grandmother's elves used to make pastries with it."
"You can call me Goldie whenever you'd like."
The first nightmare in a while. He'd forgotten his potion. Harry woke up well into the evening, sweat and fear smothering him and pushing him into his bed like an anvil. He didn't feel like going to the club, aware of the experience he might be missing out on. His teenage self would throttle him for even refusing the opportunity, but the dream held too much weight just then.
"You told me it was made of bees, Potter."
"Well, what do you propose?" Harry felt their knees brush together, nothing separated them but the box that couldn't be bigger than Harry's palm. He could see what was in it now; three bags full of white powder, an array of needles, and some potions. It all looked so pretty.
He could destroy the wand. Break it and scatter it across the forest. That would hurt Malfoy, though. Wouldn't it? It hurt Harry when his wand broke, his chest tightened and glass shards spread through his muscles, tearing out his veins and innards before placing them back all wrong. It took days before he felt correct again. Cruel. Too cruel to do that to Malfoy.
It was nice to be alone. It was also fucking horrid. They'd stuck him in a room just under the Astronomy Tower. Built specially for him. He'd never thought McGonagall to be so cruel.
"I killed the real Dark Lord before-"
Draco started tortuously fast, overwhelming Potter just to see if he could handle it. The taste of cum filled out his taste buds. Potter had already came in his pants, and Draco was lapping it up. It felt demeaning to clean up Potter's mess, but the noises Potter was making was more than balancing the scale. Draco was painfully hard, he just wanted to make Potter cum down his throat before he addressed it.
Harry woke up in his own bed, alone, and late to potions. Which meant he already missed breakfast and his N.E.W.T. studies, and Transfiguration. He didn't bother scrambling to get up. All he had left was Dark Arts and Herbology. Hardly seemed worth it.
He felt an invisible rope tighten around his arm and Malfoy's wand tap against his skin. It made his veins glow a glittering gold. Malfoy had whispered it was just to see where to inject. It felt more intimate than Harry would have imagined.
"Merlin, Potter." Draco sounded exasperated, breathless. Malfoy, Harry corrected himself.
"So are yo-"
Thoughts of the impending future were making him nauseous. He searched his discarded robes for the box. Potter's eyes were nearly gleeful as he retrieved it.
"You don't want me to call you that, you're drunk."
He didn't do much that day; a glass of firewhiskey, a film he paid no attention to, some muggle medications- stronger pain pills from when he broke his collarbone in the New York tube before getting to a healer. He fell asleep after a few hours, ignoring the owls he got.
"Fuck off," he snorted "Don't you read the tabloids? I'm fully reformed, Baby. I've even got the certificates to prove it."
Ron called some Ministry bloke from his fireplace, talking about the protections.  Harry was half listening before he felt his head grow tighter, his scar aching as he itched for a cigarette. He spelled his jacket to him, "I'm having a fag."
Next time. That was a surprise.
"You're a loon."
Harry had been staring- in shock, or awe, or infatuation he couldn't be sure. Malfoy was there, drink spilling over him as he danced around himself. Entertaining the men who dared to be within his breath. He was ethereal- dressed in all white, with what little clothes he had one. Incredibly pale, scars on display. Harry had made one, he was sure.
Harry had been waiting for an opportunity to ask Malfoy. He couldn't just shout over the Great Hall that he wanted to try some of Malfoy's heroin. Expulsion would really ruin his year.
"You're incredibly insensitive." Potter's voice came from the top of the dorms, he was dressed in what Draco had left him in. A pair of his own silk pajama bottoms and a shirt Draco knicked from a muggle-born in his second year.
"Wasn't. I've always had them."
"I do."
Harry cursed himself for remaining shackled to the bar the whole night, he wished he'd danced with Malfoy, kissed him, gone home with him. Fuck.
"I said it was fine, Malfoy."
"So you do read the tabloids about me. I'm flattered, truly."
Draco woke with the force of his own vomit, Pansy standing over him and the dormitory completely desolate. Her face was twisted with disgust and even worse, concern. She charmed the victims of his vomit clean, only telling him he was going to miss breakfast before she left.
"You're a horrible idea." Draco pushed Potter's hands away, he was not going to take Harry Potter's virginity on his first high. That would be beyond diabolical. He'd be sent to Azkaban on principle alone.
"You're crying."
"It would mean something to me. I tried incredibly hard for it to mean nothing but- you really shouldn't."
"That's even worse." He motioned for Harry to come over to him. Harry complied, moving to sit next to Malfoy- should he call him Draco now?
"Find out, Potter." And with that, Malfoy had apparated out. Harry thought only a cruel god would have squilched him before he could dig his hands and his cock into him.
"Wow, buy me dinner first."
"Oh yes I'm horribly frightened." Potter had noticed, but he hadn't connected the dots. Merlin, he was a fool. Draco was an even bigger one. "I don't actually want to have sex, Potter. It's a bit too much work."
No one except Potter. He knew now. Except- no, that was a hallucination. The clarity of the heroin hitting him just in time to remember how unrealistic that experience was. Potter couldn't have actually been there.
"I'm not one of them. Never was." Draco's voice was cold, he had stopped moving.
"Babydoll, you're a prat."
"Monkey see, monkey do," Draco muttered as he took the chocolate bar, it was not at all what Harry had made it seem like. It was exactly what Draco liked. Harry still knew what Draco liked.
"Well, buy is a strong word."
"Don't then."
"Sorry." Harry thought about moving away from him, only getting as far as to stir slightly as he choked down a lazy laugh.
Malfoy opened the box and handed him one of the potions, "It'll help with everything but the cravings."
Draco didn't hold back, Potter screamed with every thrust carefully aimed to hit his prostate. Potter whined when Draco went back to leaving dark bruises wherever Draco's mouth could reach. As his head was starting to clear, he realized what a horrid idea it was to leave hickeys all over Harry Potter. But when he stopped, Potter started. He realized why it had made Potter cum in his pants. It felt so fucking good. One sharp bite to his carotid and Draco came, he didn't have enough warning to even pull out.
"Narcissa like-"
He was too paranoid to use the Room of Requirement again, even if it was only a hallucination. Potter couldn't possibly know about the old Slytherin washrooms. They'd been closed down before Dumbledore was even headmaster. Draco motioned to Snape that he was going to leave, it wouldn't get called to attention, no points would be lost. It was perfect.
"You can't be serious," Draco laughed, Harry Potter had stolen an entire stock of candy. It was absurd.
"Can I have one?" Malfoy asked, he was leaning against the wall only half a meter away. Harry flinched at first thinking he had seen the pill bottle but quickly fished out another cigarette before Malfoy could register that panic.
"You stare a lot for someone avoiding me." Malfoy's voice was right next to him, breathy and low. He hadn't taken someone else home. Harry was one meter away from Malfoy and hadn't even known it. Too blinded by jealousy- well, he wouldn't call it that, just something.
Draco didn't go to any of his classes. No one noticed when he was gone, the professors didn't take house points. Merlin, he barely had a house anymore.
' was less than effective, apparently he'd put it in his trapped chest. The wood locked angrily. It took almost the entire period to coax it open, and took up the first few minutes of Advanced Potions to actually find the map.
"Do you need food, Ness?"
Harry hated that voice, too. Almost as much as he hated the man attached to it, with his white hair and perfect auror robes. "Sod off, Malfoy."
"Alright Lucien, what the fuck does someone want?" he asked the bird, petting it gently as he spoke just as gently. The bird spat the letter out unceremoniously.
"Let me see, you could have been poisoned."
Harry searched through his chests in his free period, trying to find the Marauders Map. He knew he'd packed it. His
"Put on the rest of your clothes and maybe I won't."
"Doubt it, Mal-gay."
"It's your name."
"It's got honey- like the bee hives in it. They always made me think of you, you like chocolate and honey. It's perfect for you."
Malfoy just laughed, letting Harry lead him outside. Cool air easing Harry's mind and amplifying the alcohol in him. He pushed Malfoy against a brick wall, hands firm on each of his hips.
"You're fine with me?"
"My name's Harry." The implications hit Draco, a warm torrid wave pulling him into the tide. It was cruel, how Harry threw around the comfort like it didn't mean anything. Like it was still there.
"Which stash did you find?"
Draco couldn't contain his reaction to the name, he whined. Out loud. To Potter. Who thought he was the worst of the worst.
"It is bee hive, though." Harry defended quietly, almost as if he was convincing himself.
"It doesn't concern you."
"Goldie." Draco gasped in response to the cruel images, the sick feeling crawling up his bones muffled by the soft euphoria spreading through his innards.
"If you're too loud, I won't do anything else to you." Draco's instructions were clear, he just hoped Potter was lucid enough to follow.
"Fine I'll call you-" Harry stopped to think for a minute, barely containing his laughter as he decided "-babydoll."
It felt good, though. That Harry looked at him like he was a person. No one had looked at him like that all year. Harry had hated him all year. It didn't matter much that Draco's stomach twisted and knotted at Harry's words and the look in his eyes. At least he was paying attention.
Harry would help him.
Malfoy slipped away, walking away as Harry watched. He shouted after him, "What about tommorow night?"
Harry's fingers were still brushing against the thestral on Malfoy's neck, it was trying to wrap itself around his carotid. It's breath was almost real against Harry's fingertips. He stroked along its mane, only pulling away when he heard Malfoy gasp.
Draco took the hand he'd been gripping to keep from travelling to his left forearm, pressed it to the wall behind them as he moved to straddle Potter. It wasn't as swift as he would have liked but any physical contact would surely set Potter's world on fire. Draco was touching him all over distinctly for that reason, Potter's moans were fit for a high end whore. He can't possibly be a virgin.
"What would it mean to you?" Harry asked Draco's unconscious body as he replayed their conversation.
"Are you?"
He locked the door, placing a charm to really make sure it couldn't be opened. Finally, Harry relaxed. Unfolding a dollar bill from his pants pockets and placing it over four of the little pills, he crushed the pills with his wand. Only a little stray magic spilling out from the end. It was calming, the routine; crush, line, cut, snort. Simple. The lines made his eyes water and his throat get caught in itself, but he finished them with a smile. Flushing the toilet, and composing himself as best he could before he went back out to Malfoy.
Draco smirked, patting a small box set out on one of the many side tables "Who said I was alone?"
He carefully constructed his robes, not a thread of fabric out of place. It was a shitty facade, but it seemed to fool everyone. No one had even suspected he had to snort three carefully formed lines every morning to get through his days.
"Harry-"
"Never thought you'd put something muggle inside you." Potter's voice came muffled in through the soaked cotton overtaking Draco's brain. He was entirely too stoic, giving Draco nothing to perceive.
Draco had a blissful second where he thought he'd fallen asleep, the knock at the door seemed too surreal for him to be conscious. His smile only lasted the second before the knock became words, words he couldn't possibly be dreaming.
"Mandrake," Draco repeated, his cheeks tinted the slightest bit pink. Narcissa was coiled around his arm, over his hoodie sleeve.
Harry knew eighth year was going to be shit, he was nearly twenty years old and he was still longing for the boy he'd almost let himself fall in love with in sixth year. He kept Malfoy from Azkaban as a sort of repayment. Reparations to himself for getting too close, for obscuring his own thoughts and feelings.
Eighth year was going to be shit. There would be a constant reminder of how stupendously he had fucked everything up. At least he knew he would always be able to get a release.
Draco wasn't there when he woke up. He expected as much. It still hurt to wake up like that, incredibly cold with his thoughts swirling from harsh dreams. Harry ran his fingers through his hair, shutting his eyes tight as he let out a groan of frustration.
"How noble of you," Malfoy scoffed, getting his wand out and mumbling a "Murus Reparo."
"You want me to eat a bee hive? Like what the insect makes?" Draco asked in disbelief, it sounded absolutely vile.
Harry didn't notice him.
"I know, I'm not an idiot. I just want to kiss you." Potter had him trapped against the wall outside the dormitory.
"Yes."
"I'm more of a giver, Potter." Malfoy smiled at him, studying his face.  Sighing as he pulled the box back into view, opening it and taking a bag out of it, "I'm not gonna let you just have some, you'll get me expelled. You'll have to do it with me."
Malfoy was somewhere. He was definitely somewhere.
Potter's hands found their way back onto Draco, one trailing up his right leg and on trailing down his left shoulder. Draco's had enough sense to grasp Potter's hand before it reached his forearm. The sharp whine coming from the lowest part of Potter's throat was deeply inhumane. Draco was honestly trying not to be diabolical, Potter was honestly trying to be evil. The world had turned backwards.
"Now I don't like the way you say Potter." Harry parroted, secretly hoping he'd get a sweet nickname too.
Harry had wished that on him, but he never thought it could be true. Draco always had someone. Crabbe, Goyle, Snape.
Draco reckoned he could try to go to class, but he couldn't leave his little potion lab. Someone could find it. There wasn't any reason for someone to search his room, but there also wasn't any reason for Draco to trust anyone. They all wanted him gone. He was sure of it.
It tasted of lavender, warm sugar, and plywood flavored chewing tobacco.
The Astronomy Tower.
"We could watch something, I figured out a spell to make the sheets project whatever."
"I got a new one." He took the wand anyway, he was shaking less and still eyeing Harry.
"No, you haven't. I spent 8 years with you and I've never-"
Maybe it was the heroin.
"It's- Potter. I- hm." Words were hard to come by, Draco's mind was only reeling with shock and horror at what Harry Potter could do with this information. Ruin his name- his
"Don't get too overzealous, but I'd quite like to snog."
"Don't make me quit."
They were all dead.
Draco faltered, the cover blanket stopped moving only half unfolded. "I'm not actually."
He didn't deserve pity. He deserved hatred.
Malfoy looked terrible. Skin barely clinging to him. The scar Harry had given him painfully obvious on his shirtless body. Ribs poking out. Collarbones sinking in. Stomach unnaturally flat. He was shaking as he stared at Harry, his eyes rimmed with dark purple circles. He didn't look like Malfoy. He didn't look like Draco.
Potter usually stared at him, though. It was perfectly normal for Potter to stare, perhaps he and the weasel were scheming. Finally getting revenge for the train. Draco prepared himself to deflect their amateur hexes, gryffindors weren't famous for their cleverness.
Harry could feel the wards Malfoy set up, his magic was comfortably cool and for a split second Harry worried he had found something scandalous.
"The snake's name, Prat."
"You don't have to stay and pretend to care, I'm doing fine. You can leave."
Harry killed himself a thousand times in the silence that followed, cursing himself over and over for ruining it all this time. Draco didn't speak, he didn't move. Until he did.
He waited until Potter was almost speaking in tongues before he pulled off, ignoring the pathetic whines as he moved backwards and lower down. Potter nearly screamed as Draco unbuttoned his trousers, Draco had to tell him to shut up. If anyone came in Draco was damned, The Boy Who Lived doped up and naked under him. He cast a Muffliato without Potter noticing, not that he would have noticed much.
"Try some of what, Potter?"
"You're an idiot. Just have one."
That was the truth. Draco was incredibly worn down. Potter was surprisingly resigned, Draco decided he was more respectful sober. He was thankful for it, if Potter had insisted Draco would have obliged.
"How do you not know what a crunchie is? Stupid wizards, this is a delicious- a delicacy." Harry sent haphazard surges of magic out to light up Draco's room, Draco was convinced he had just invented the spell.
"I'll find something you'd like. I don't know a lot of pretentious films."
"Incendio," Harry said softly, lighting it wandlessly. Malfoy coughed a little on his first puff, but it seemed to come naturally to him.
"No. Draco. Are you okay?"
"Thanks, babydoll." Harry drank it without thinking twice, if his head was clearer he would be wary of some sort of poisoning. All the dopamine and whatever brain chemicals come from sex have skewed his judgement.
"Same thing, just to you instead."
"What." It wasn't a question, a snarky demand.
"Always at my best, Draco."
Harry felt a tear fall as Dobby rounded the curve to the underside of Draco's leg, disappearing again. He worked on controlling his breathing, he went to a psychiatrist once who told him to think about his surroundings. Draco. Cigarettes. Glass. Blood. It was horrid advice. Being aware made him feel even more unreal, unworthy, uncontrolled.
Malfoy parted from Harry with a wry chuckle, his hands reaching down to palm at Harry's cock. "Not tonight, Potter. I've decided."
"I like toffee more, you should've lead with that." Draco sat beside him, careful not to let their legs brush against each other.
Potter's face wasn't anything to perceive either, nothing that could be correct, anyway. He looked hungry staring at the poor sight of Draco- where was the malice? The disgust? The scheming? It was infuriating, how much the heroin distorted Draco's view.
Draco said it like it was the pinnacle of confessions, his voice was raw and his hands shook as they held onto the towel around his waist. Harry didn't know how to make sense of it but he knew what Draco meant, in that moment Harry knew exactly how Draco felt. He pulled their bodies flush together, letting years of infatuation and obsession and love flow from his lips to Draco's. Harry could feel their tears mingling as they crashed into each other like tsunamis. Gentle. Caring. Desperate.
"Well now I really know." Harry pushed his way into Draco's dorm, dropping candy bars from the absurd stockpile in his arms.
Draco didn't unfold the rest of the blanket, leaving Harry to do it himself. His last hit had completely worn off, his blood wasn't boiling for another. He was completely sober for the first time since he'd been held in the ministry cells before his trial. It had been at least an hour. He hadn't even thought about heroin or the potion. That was- Draco didn't know what that was.
Infuriating.
"Yeah, she loves them."
"When do you sleep?" Harry asked as soon as the thought popped into his head, "Seeing as you're the only one protecting me."
Draco would be awake. Draco needed to eat. Draco needed to talk. Draco needed to sleep.
"Malfoy needs to get an early start on the protection wards, I'll find something to eat later." Harry gripped Malfoy's forearm and apparated out before Ron could object.
"Like what?"
"Yes, babydoll." Potter giggled again.
Draco didn't try to hide the line of heroin he made on the floating shelf above, inhaling it to let himself rest as easily as Potter. He strengthened the wards before he let the warmth spreading through his sinuses and the warmth radiating from Potter swallow him whole.
He pulled on a jumper and sat on his desk chair, looking up at Harry expectantly. The potion helped him look less like shit.
Draco debated pretending to be asleep, leaving Harry to the mercy of Filch but Harry kept begging in his hushed shouts at the corner of the door frame. His voice filled the room, infested it. After what seemed like hours, Draco moved. Rising from his helpless attempt at sleeping and opening the door, he braced himself for whatever doom Harry could possibly bring him this time.
"You don't get to do that. You don't get to care. You never cared before."
"Merlin, Potter, do you really think I'm an idiot? Obviously you're going first."
This was all such a horrible idea.
"Exactly! They're Deatheaters, and you're the bloody Boy Who Lived! At least let the Ministry strengthen your wards and give you a protection detail. Merlin's sake, you're in real danger!" Her voice was strained, she looked so tired. Harry was feeling more and more guilty as she went on, but he didn't need protection. He killed Voldemort.
"I forgot about that." Draco didn't forget, he'd been thinking of the bruises he'd left on Potter since he made them.
He could hide it. Push it down in some chest and forget about it for years. That would be cruel to the wand. Besides Harry wouldn't forget about it. He'd get drunk, dig through all his chests, and cry through a battery of simple slurred spells.
He'd be awake now, wouldn't he? It had to be four in the morning. Harry had gone through nearly nine bottles, so that's what he would guess.
His vision went black. Then green. Then everything was that awful white. He heard trains.
Harry couldn't sleep. The image of Malfoy blissed out on concrete floors too strong for him to handle. The memory of Malfoy's voice, all breathy and- he sounded like sex. Pure sex, on heroin. He knew Malfoy was up to something, he just never thought it could possibly be that. It was weird. So weird. The anti-drug speakers had never said heroin looked so pretty. They always said it was horrible, that you'd be homeless forever and die instantly. Malfoy wasn't homeless and he wasn't dead. He was ethereal.
He wasn't going to class. The professor wouldn't take house points. Harry hardly got house points taken for anything, it was almost unnerving how everyone acted like he couldn't do anything wrong anymore. He made his way to the Astronomy Tower, feeling his legs get heavier with each step, his throat felt like a desert, his heart was pounding, his hands shook. He needed a drink.
Harry grimaced, Draco almost let himself question it but held it back. They were still strangers, despite whatever intimate knowledge they had before it was ruined. Draco wasn't allowed to ask questions like that.
"No. It was quick." Harry couldn't take his eyes off the Dobby on Draco's leg, he looked happy, peaceful. Exactly like Harry remembered him.
"I want to try some." Harry's voice responded to Malfoy's expectant look before he could think of what to say.
The marks on his neck- Draco's marks on Potter's neck were overwhelming. Potter moved first, Draco was thankful he did. He couldn't be at fault for the way their lips met, the way Potter's hands traveled up under Draco's shirt. Draco couldn't be at fault for this. Their tongues met and Potter pulled back with a smile, an addition to his hungry eyes.
"Were you snooping, Malfoy?" he asked, a languid smile on his face as he wandlessly spelled over two glasses of firewhiskey.
He missed the last few months of sixth year. It wasn't as lonely.
Draco moved first, crashing their lips together and gripping at Harry's shirt, pushing them even closer together. Harry's cigarette had come with them, he let it fall from his hand onto his floor. Matching Draco's energy, the desperation and fire behind it.
"It hardly looks like a delicacy." Draco laughed, only allowing the least dangerous amount of comfort. They could speak, he missed speaking.
"They hate muggles, thought you all thought they weren't even worth an attack." Harry searched around for a cigarette, wincing as the glass moved deeper into him with every step.
Potter laughed at him. Git.
"Why does it matter to you? Not like I was screaming for you."
"You can sleep it off here. I'll make up a bed, just promise me you won't hate me in the morning for taking you in." Draco decided civility was his best option. Don't get too comfortable, don't be too cold. Surely, Harry didn't actually intend on coming to Draco's sad abode. It was just the alcohol. He shut down any hope of drunk words being sober thoughts. Harry just thought he was familiar.
"Didn't think basilisks ate frogs," Harry muttered. Draco was so excited about his snake, it was warming the way his eyes danced with adoration.
"D'you wanna get out of here?" Harry shouted, not interested in Brian enough to go through the motions. Surely they'd talked enough now to have a shag. He hoped he wasn't being too crass.
Malfoy had taken to some bloke- tall, muscular, tattooed to the heavens. He looked a bit like Harry, just bigger. They'd barely talked for a minute before they were snogging, tongues down each others throat. Hands all over each other. Harry could almost hear the sounds Malfoy would make, he'd imagined them for so long. He wished it was him instead.
Vomit. Whiskey. Mouthwash. Whiskey.
It opened.
Harry couldn't think of anything to say. Draco sounded so empty.
The bartender slid Harry a whiskey, said it was from someone he didn't care enough about to look at. He couldn't possibly break his focus on the beads of sweat trailing down Malfoy's neck. The warmth was nice, though. Gentle burns made their way down his throat and into his stomach, he groaned softly after he had downed the glass.
"You mean something to me, Draco."
"My house elves are not slaves, you prat. And, I'm here on official Auror business."
It was weird to talk without insults, but Harry decided not to dwell on it. Regrettably, they were going to be spending quite a bit of time together, it would be exhausting if they couldn't be civil for at least some of it.
"We could have breakfast." Draco smiled, the half smile he'd sported all of sixth year that held no emotion.
"Which stash do you not want me to find?"
" Harry heard in parseltongue, Narcissa's concerned judgement. When had Draco let her out? He'd been in the bathroom too long. Draco would start to worry, he'd try to get in, he'd take away Harry's pills. Vile.
"Was it a nightmare?" Malfoy asked, Harry just noticed that he had been staring back that whole time.
"Really?" Harry asked, feeling his organs flip as he stood up.
"It would mean something to me, too." Harry felt the words fall out of him, they didn't let him think. "It's all meant something to me, actually."
The potion was ready.
"What would you have done?" Harry spoke directly into Malfoy's ear, hands trailing up and down his body as it rolled back into him.
"Potter, I don't know what the fuck a crunchie is." Draco couldn't keep his smile down, it was all too familiar. Like it could have been real. Harry wouldn't even remember if Draco allowed himself to pretend a little. He wouldn't do anything but it had been ages since anyone did anything for him. He could let himself smile at the gift.
Harry moved without thinking, falling into Draco's bed like it was a practiced routine. He supposed it used to be. They didn't speak, only listened to each other's uneven breaths as limbs settled to light intertwining.
"Sorry, mate." Harry kept feeling guilty today, he really just needed to go home. Calm himself down, not that the pills would calm him down at all but it would make everything less irritating.
Slytherins and drugs. There was a joke there. Harry wasn't lucid enough to make it.
Malfoy scoffed, "Some of us have jobs, Scarhead. I can handle a little sexual harassment for a steady salary."
Malfoy pushed Harry's hand away when he reached for one of the needles in the box, "I won't be held responsible for you killing yourself."
"Are you scared of letting me see your stomach?"
"Let me take them out, Harry." Draco was on the sofa, only in his boxers, letting the littered wounds contrast with his skin. He was pretty. "Shrapnel's not good for you."
Harry didn't answer.
Drac- Malfoy nodded, a silent laugh behind his lips. The cigarettes came without Harry noticing, there was one filling his lungs before he thought to Accio them. He was noticing Malfoy's eyes. They were grey, cold, comforting. The dream came back in little snippets; Blood mixed into those eyes. Lifeless at the floor of the Astronomy Tower. Harry hated thinking about school, but it was better to think about Malfoy.  Malfoy's skin used to be grey in school, he used to be sickly, strung out and frayed at every end. Harry felt guilty he never thought to help. Well of course he thought about helping him, saving him from himself, pulling him aside in a hallway and begging him to switch sides, making him feel indebted to the world. But Harry knew Malfoy wasn't stupid and he wasn't that heartless, he couldn't ever bring himself to pressure another kid like that- like him. Maybe things would've been better for him if he could. Harry wasn't sure which 'him' he was thinking of. Malfoy. Potter. Both.
"Why wouldn't I be real?"
When Harry looked away for a moment- just a second- to order a drink, Malfoy was gone. Fuck. He'd missed his chance again. Malfoy had gone home with someone, and he got to experience Malfoy. What he felt like around his cock, what he sounded like, what he tasted like, what he begged for.
They stayed like that, panting and fit together like a puzzle for the amount of time it took Draco to finish coming down. Then, with his cum dripping down Potter's thighs and Potter's cum drying on their stomachs, Draco could truly reflect on what took place. It was honestly just an unimaginably horrid idea.
Malfoy gave him a strange look, his light eyebrows furrowing together. "I find them comforting."
Harry tried for far too long to undo his spell, further cementing the idea that Harry had indeed made it up on the spot. Draco had never seen lights like that- like the sunset, comforting and warm. It felt like an opera, watching them fade into a dark blue before they sputtered out completely.
Draco really struggled with the process of how to get in and out of the dormitories for the minute and a half he had before Potter asked him for the password. The answer was incredibly coerced, Potter's hands wear circling dangerously on his collarbones.
"No, I mean, you call me 'Malfoy' again. I've heard it."
Harry wasn't acting. He genuinely didn't understand what he'd done wrong. Kiss him? They'd already done that. "I won't kiss you in public again."
He missed the isolation. It wasn't as difficult.
"No reason?" The regret had set in. Draco knew it was only a matter of time before Potter went back to despising him. He scratched at his arm, where Draco had shot him up. Draco was disturbed he remembered the event so clearly, and so fondly. Potter sighed before he continued. "Suppose you're right. Leave a note next time, it's incredibly rude to transport unconscious people."
"Suppose you want me to hire you as a translator then."
"Wasn't personal, Potter."
"Merlin's Sake, what time is it Dra- Malfoy," Harry grumbled, rubbing his eyes as he felt the sharp tightness of a hangover growing behind them. He saw Malfoy's eyebrows raise at his almost 'Draco' mistake, he made a mental note to deliberately think of him as Malfoy.
Fuck. Did Draco really have no one?
"Tell him I thank him for his service."
"Sorry."
Draco faltered, his body stiffened, he pulled back away from Harry. "Fuck, Potter. I need a drink."
"Good luck with that." the cashier snorted as they left.
"I shouldn't be drinking on the job anyway- Wait, Potter you're bleeding." Malfoy pointed to Harry's nose.
He'd have to ask Malfoy. Bloody hell, he'd have to ask Malfoy.
"You do still remember," Draco laughed, Harry felt his face get warm, embarrassed.
It seemed like Malfoy was deliberately evading him, what with all the bobbing and weaving. The footprints came to a still, Harry was fifty paces behind. He could see where Malfoy had dipped into.
Malfoy's face held an indescribable emotion, "Sod off."
A worse idea was leading Potter to his bed, putting up silencing and shrouding wards around the canopy sheets. Even worse, fucking Potter into his own bed in his own dormitory with a slytherin scarf pulling their bodies closer. It was incredibly hard to rationalize the fact they were both nearly sober during the whole ordeal.
It burned more this time, he didn't stop to breathe between lines. There was blood on his cigarette as he picked it back up from beside the sink, smoking despite it.
He could hear Draco swallow. "Okay."
"You were, actually."
He cast another Silencio charm on his pocket, and on the bottle, before exiting into the cold thick air of his home. Worse than outside. He tugged Sirius' jacket closer to his body, wincing as he felt glass shift.
"Turn off the lights." Harry grumbled, shielding his eyes as he complained to Draco.
Draco pulled back, his face was bewildered, maybe hurt. He left. Harry trailed after him, confused.
Harry pitied him now.
I am going to make up a buncha spells with Latin and French words bc I can
It wasn't because of the potion. It was real life. Real, horribly awkward, painful life. It couldn't be a dream either- wasn't horrific, wasn't euphoric. It was just Harry in Draco's room.
The potion delved into that memory on occasion; shaky hands, empty gut, dry throat, blood from biting his lips, Dumbledore's kindness, a glimpse of Harry under the floorboards as he fell to his knees. Regret. Guilt. Bile. Blood.
"Killing you would be bad for my job, so I'm just gonna let you believe that, honey." Malfoy's saccharine words made Harry gag, he really disliked how many pet names were in Malfoy's arsenal now.
Draco sat up, his hands started to twitch as he noticed he had sweated through his sheets. He rummaged under his bed for one of the potion bottles, he'd made enough to last the week.
"You wouldn't," Harry spoke softly, pressing their lips together. Relishing in the taste of Draco's bloodied chapped lips. It was sweet. Draco returned the kiss, his hands traveling up Harry's neck and through his hair. It had been a while since anyone had touched Harry like that, he couldn't help the smile that broke their lips apart.
"You want more?" Draco was baffled by the sentiment of it all.
It was a practiced routine. Spelling his water bottle to whiskey. It came out more sour when he used Malfoy's wand, it was better sour. He'd miss that. He was allowed to miss that. Whiskey hadn't done anything wrong to him.
"I always suspected your creepy obsession with me was of a homosexual variety."
Harry couldn't fall asleep that night. Despite the warmth flowing through him, firewhiskey making his hands brush golden touches against his own body. His fingers found his lips the most and it never failed to create pale phantom lips.
Draco laughed, the first time he'd felt it in a long while, "Merlin, Potter. You didn't think they actually put bee hive in it?"
"An Opaleyed Basilisk-" Harry faltered, remembering Tom Riddle's Basilisk, Malfoy seemed to notice "-I trained her with Charlie since she hatched, she even knows how to control her eyes. I learned a little parseltongue."
Harry expected Hermione to object, Dementors were hardly a step up from these new deatheaters "He can't possibly throw me in-"
Draco moved closer, his fingers settled on a puncture wound on Harry's jaw. They were so close.
"Let's dance." Malfoy held out his hand, Dark Mark in full view, as if he was testing Harry. Seeing how far he could be himself before Harry went back to casting 'Sectum Sempra' and hexes.
Harry noticed the blood, smeared across pale skin, pink lips, and stray strands of hair. He cast a quick 'Scourgify' on both of them. At least the plan seemed to work, Malfoy had completely forgotten about his healer idea.
The kiss wasn't like last time, it was softer.
"Calm down, Potter. Wouldn't me to be the one you lose your virginity to, now would we?" Draco circled his finger in the excess liquid of the saucer and shattered to suck it off his finger. Potter stared, he could feel it. Potter also groaned. It was already getting exhausting. He used his off hand to put everything back neatly in the box while he sucked the rest of the residue off his finger. Potter was still staring.
Potter was getting to him.
Harry still hadn't come up with the words, the sight of Malfoy disheveled with his right sleeve pushed up to his shoulder wasn't helping. He was sat on the concrete floor, his back pressed against the only wall that seemed strong enough to hold the ceiling up. Harry was baffled as to why he'd never noticed how pretty Malfoy was.
"Draco I- I'm sorry."
Potter fumbled to kiss back, their lips smashing together. Their hands wandered. Their moans mingled. Their magic seemed to repel, making it all so much more sweeter as they fought against their basic energies. Draco's lips traveled to Potter's neck, sucking, licking, biting.
"You're insufferable."
A voice boomed in his head, like his link with Voldemort. But he was dead. He is dead. Voldemort can't possibly be alive. Right?
"You'd like that. You already love something long and hard in you." It was a cheap joke, not even a good one. He was sure he'd get a needle-dick joke in return.
Draco laid in his bed flicking a mini patronus with his old wand. It was proof that Harry was actually there.
"Stay quiet for me. Don't want anyone to stop us, do we, Potter?" Draco cooed, pulling his pants to his ankles and grabbing his wand to cast lube charms. He didn't want to wait anymore than he had to.
Harry scoffed and unwrapped the one he was offering, took a theatrical bite and reached it back out towards Draco.
Snakes had been a sore comfort for a while, they plagued Harry's nightmares and held small conversations during the days with little garden snakes. They judged him for everything. Bastards, the lot of them. One particular snake who used to hang around, saw him taking a line once and told him he'd be better off with a Crucio. The bastard even offered to do it for him.
Harry motioned for a fug, Draco scoffed but handed one over. He didn't seem to have a lighter, not the full muggle experience, then. Draco lit it before Harry had the chance. Wandless and wordless.
Malfoy was dancing alone when Harry got to the club. Brightly colored and languid in his motions.
And it was gone. Almost no trace of the gentle lingering hands, soft skin, warm sweat- it was washed out.
"What's her name, Draco?"
It was bigger inside than it looked, but not by much. Draco had a desk, bookcase, bed, trunk, and some sort of potion set-up. It was better than the cupboard, but the air felt dark and heavy.
It was nice, to be ignored for once. Everyone was too busy dealing with themselves to worry about Harry. The only downside was how much time Harry had to himself, just to think. About the war, about everything that was gone, worst of all about Malfoy.
"You alright?"
Harry looked at him. Pitied him where he stood.
His belief in it being a hallucination was perfectly concrete, until Potter wouldn't stop staring at him. That same hungry look he'd hallucinated. He wasn't that high, it didn't make sense. Potter definitely had to be staring at him.
By dinner, Draco had to force his leg to keep from shaking and force himself to keep his robes on despite the sweat seeping through the fabric of his shirt. He was sure he looked a horrible mess to anyone paying attention. Potter was still staring.
The night after was a small German boy, he reminded Harry of Malfoy at Hogwarts. Not as filled out as he was that night at the club, but exactly as Harry had pictured Malfoy under his robes in 5th year.
"A thestral," Harry mused, reaching his fingers out to Malfoy's neck where the drawn death horse moved up to Malfoy's ear.
Harry took Malfoy's hand, sweaty and warm, "Let's get out of here."
An owl pecked at his window incessantly, terribly hard to ignore. He didn't recognize the bird, probably an obsessed fan or The Ministry tying to get him back into auror training. Harry heard the glass pane crack before he finally let the owl in. It looked incredibly angry. Harry notice the gold pendant on around it's neck 'Lucien' was his name.
Harry rounded the corner. There was a door where the staircase used to be. A simple door. It looked like the cupboard under the stairs. Maybe they had turned it into storage room. He checked the map again, just to make sure Malfoy was in there. Ink footsteps paced just behind that door.
"What about AIDS?" Potter slurred too close to Draco's ear.
That was before. Draco knew Harry wouldn't ever be Goldie again. He'd known that for a year. It still hurt.
It looked good. Malfoy looked good. Harry wanted to try it. He knew he shouldn't, heroin was the worst of the worst. But it looked so fucking good.
Malfoy didn't come back to the club for another week. Harry had lost interest in anonymous sex, spent his nights searching the crowds and nursing numerous drinks. He ignored the men who approached him, even the one who looked exactly like Malfoy if he'd gone into trapeze. At home, he would think of Malfoy at every angle and perception. Waiting and hoping he hadn't fucked everything up, with whatever it was he did.
"I still have your wand." Harry raised the wand out to Draco, smiling a bit when they made eye contact but Draco only looked tired.
Harry offered him a fag as he got another one out, both still just standing in the doorway. Malfoy gestured for the lighter, fumbling with it for a few seconds before whispering a frustrated 'Incendio.'
"I'm just trying to do my bloody job, you prat. Just let me take you to a healer just to-"
They stopped at slytherin dorm first. Draco huddled to Potter's bare chest, Potter continuing to not show any signs of regret. It was infuriating, he had to think Draco took advantage of him- that Draco was an evil worse than The Dark Lord. But Potter kept his smile and his arm slung across Draco's shoulders to keep them in the cloak.
Harry picked one off Draco's floor and held it out to him. Understandably, Draco hesitated. The way Harry had described it was less than appetizing.
"Harry-" Hermione started, but Harry was already out the door. He couldn't imagine any neo-deatheater would attack him in broad daylight surrounded by the policing aurors.
Harry heard the faintest hissing coming from inside, "A snake?"
"See it's fucking incredible. A spiritual experience. I'm gonna start a petition to put them on the train trollies." Harry spoke with his hands, his smile still that unnerving saccharine and his skin seemed to glow under his magic.
Finally, the third night Malfoy was back. Already dancing with some guy when Harry had come in. He was wearing all black, a lovely contrast against his pale skin. Harry was determined to talk to him this time. But his body failed him again, only allowing him prolonged stares.
Crush. Line. Cut. Snort. Three of the little pills. He actually took a piss while he waited to see if his nose would bleed. Little drops fell from his nostril, but stopped as soon as they started. He had heard good things about cocaine, more bad things, but he did want to try it. Maybe he'd try it if the Ritalin stopped working as well, like he tried Ritalin after the cigarettes stopped calming him.
"Safer here than.." he didn't know how to put it into words, the fluorescent lights and the fresh smell of construction was calming. It felt like that train station, but no one expected anything of him there. No saving the world, no going back, just money.
"Wait, stop."
"You and your terrorists can kill me some other time," He regretted his words as soon as they came out, studying Malfoy's face for any real kind of hurt.
"This definitely isn't a hallucination," Malfoy groaned, pushing a black box behind him as Harry entered what seemed to be an even worse off version of Mrytle's bathroom.
" Harry heard faintly in parseltongue. Narcissa. Was she talking about him?
"Are you going to kiss me again?"
"You're so smart."
"If you call Skeeter I will murder you myself."
"Goldie. I like that. This was a really good idea. Feels better than you look on it."
"Apparently not."
"You've ruined my day. I'm going to pretend you never said that, the bees made this and nothing you say can ever change that." Harry's smile had settled in Draco's mind, it made him feel warm. Like it used to.
"Is your cock broken? Do you need to see a healer?" Draco asked, holding back his snark as he faked concern.
"Good boy, Goldie. Now you get more."
"Can I- Do you want this?" Harry asked, eyes searching Draco's. His face was relaxed but his eyes held a substantial amount of terror.
He hated Malfoy, hated himself, hated everything, and most of all he hated heroin. Firewhiskey was his only solace weak enough to keep him from making bad decisions, but strong enough to drown out his pain.
"Coward."
Harry downed all his firewhiskey before replying, "You'd have to tell me about all your sex interests before I tell you anything about mine."
Draco had expected Potter's vengeful return to sobriety. He hadn't anticipated his complete absence. Transfiguration was usually dull, but even duller without Potter staring at him. After that he decided to investigate.
"It's what your snake calls you."
