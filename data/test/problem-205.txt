As the door formed, he hadn't expected someone else to be inside already. Neither did he expect such a calm room, filled with harmony and a rather content Draco Malfoy who seemed lost in his own world. He felt like he intruded on something, yet he couldn't tear himself away from the spot, even when something in him had registered that he should maybe close that door behind him.
"I believe we're done, I've better not wasted my time here, try to get a decent grade would you." He got up from his chair and pushed it back to the table. He'd done it just in time, because seconds later the girl was standing next to him, wearing a slightly confused expression. Draco didn't bother to explain, if she wanted to know, she'd ask him later.
Somehow, these pressing thoughts weren't the only thing on Draco's mind. Potter kept interrupting them, with his emerald eyes and fluffy hair. With that slightly trained body and Merlin, the dimples he got when he smiled…
The conversation had silenced at his arrival, but no one had spoken up yet. Draco looked at Harry, hoping he'd be able to ease the situation a bit.
"Just the usual, being so clever and all. I'm just as smart as her, but do I put up a whole show in front of the class, just to let them see how smart I am? No. I don't think anyone should act like that, but there she goes putting her hand up every single time-"
As he looked around, he realized how jolly the castle had begun to look. There was Christmas decoration on the walls, and several students were already wearing ugly Christmas sweaters. This reminded him of the fact that he was staying here for Christmas, and that Potter had volunteered to stay at Hogwarts with him.
Harry was confused at first as the other was standing still instead of moving away. Was he still taunting him? The blonde was looking at the ice beneath him and didn't budge an inch. It was only when he saw how the other's face was turning pale that he realized what was going on.
Harry hummed. "Sure, I was planning on heading back to the common room as well. Fireplaces make me feel relaxed or something, I don't know. There should be someone there who can explain what I'm reading as well."
His kissing showed this emotion, as it became more intense. His nails had again found their way into the other's back, but this time not out of anger or pain.
Blaise frowned at him, clearly not having expected that to be the reason for his absence lately. "Why?" He asked, seeming almost a little merely returned his offense with a cold glare. "Because I've decided to come to terms with my childish past, and apologize for it."
A sudden cold spread through his body like fire, paralyzing him and leaving him to stare at the other with a wide-eyed expression. The violin still rested on his shoulder, his arms frozen around it as if someone had simply paused him.
For now, he wasn't sure what to do. Hugging was fine, not a permanent solution, but a nice temporary fix. Draco decided it was probably the best he could manage right now.
Well, to answer that: when we started writing the story, we didn't really have in mind how old they were and all that hocus-pocus. We just wrote whatever, basically. So I edited mentions of Dumbledore out and changed it to McGonagall for this. We decided while writing that the story takes place after the war - as you'll notice while the story progresses. However, in our story, Snape ain't death cuz well... It's Snape... So yeah, they returned to Hogwarts after the war which makes them like 17-18?
It felt a bit weird. Potter didn't annoy him anymore if he were honest, that hadn't happened for a very long time. But Granger and Weasley on the other hand… They were just as skeptical of him as they'd always been. Potter was actually kind, but they kept provoking him. The only reason Malfoy was holding back on his remarks, was the fact that he wasn't Potter's enemy anymore. This meant he had to leave his friends be as well, and he was decent enough to do that.
He stopped and smiled lightly, looking around a bit. "But that's all there is to it," he concluded. He'd left some parts out, but Potter would never know that.
"Quality, huh?" He chuckled, gladly accepting the other's closure. It didn't matter, the other in his arms right now was what counted. Whatever the other thought of him about now, it wasn't such a bad thing. Else they wouldn't be hugging like this, yet that didn't mean he should get his hopes up.
It felt weird to laugh while laying down on the bed, yet he couldn't help himself. "My bad. Forgot someone already did. Let me rephrase it. 'It's not as if someone will just break down the door to sweep me off my feet'. Is that better, Mal?"
He nestled himself to fit better in the hold Malfoy had on him, his hand combing through blond locks as he allowed his fingers to curl the locks around his finger. With that, he also started to hum and nuzzle his head in Malfoy's nape, noting that his skin felt soft, just like his hair. He moved the locks aside as he pressed his lips shortly to the skin unconsciously before leaning his head against the other. Yet he didn't realize it yet, was not conscious of his actions.
"I've tried with Pansy in sixth year," he said. "Mostly to create an image you know, but it soon became pretty clear that it didn't work at all. I don't think she even fancies guys, she's never let them close." He kept his eyes shut as he spoke, keeping his voice low. Loud sounds would absolutely shatter the calm air around them.
"Perhaps we could ask some of the herbology students who like to bake to make some Mandrake cupcakes?" Harry started out in the open. "Or just a cake with the house colors. As for drinks, we could use food coloring for drinks, just to keep it somewhat closer to home for muggle-borns as the basic spells."
He had to say something to explain himself somewhat more though, at least he felt like he should do that. "Again, I didn't want to interrupt you but when I heard you play…" Harry couldn't look at the other anymore at that moment.
This went on for a few minutes until the boy got stuck. Oh no. No, no, no. Not happening. He scratched the back of his head while taking a deep breath. Malfoy just explained this, didn't he? Oh man, maybe he shouldn't have questioned himself about their situation and just shut it all out to just focus on what the guy told him.
A silence fell as soon as Draco was done talking. Blaise kept scowling at him, but his other friends, who'd been sitting there during the whole argument, simply looked away with a guilty expression. Draco knew everyone here was dealing with the same regrets, each person just acted them out differently. Draco just so happened to be the first person to bring that to the light, to undertake some action.
Harry cleared his throat before he answered. "Sorry, I didn't mean to intrude. I was passing by to see what kind of room I could expect for the party, I had no idea you…"
"Oh, I see," he mumbled. "You know, if I didn't know any better, Draco, I would have said you were offering."
He didn't usually just hug people, it mostly came to Hermione and Ron's mom occasionally, with Ron himself giving him a more brotherly hug at times. They did not last all that long. Well, aside from a few specific moments in their lives. Hugging this guy was somewhat different, more intimate. That was not just because of his crush, is what he told himself.
He knew very well that was not enough, yet with these feelings darting all around him he just had not felt the need to eat at that moment anymore.
"Just warning you, she won't let you go unless she knows you're being monitored by someone." He informed him.
When Harry heard the first sniff, he didn't think much of it. People do that sometimes. It was when he felt the other nuzzle his face in his sweater, that he felt something wet that he automatically pushed himself away. Malfoy obviously didn't want him to see him this way, yet he couldn't help himself.
Obviously, they had been informed of his cold and how he had, once again, managed to get himself in the hospital wing.
And there it was, the infamous Malfoy sneer. There were a lot of words he would love to throw at Potter at that moment, but instead, he made sure he looked decent and went for the great hall as well. Stupid Potter, brushing him off like that.
They left Ron running after them to catch up after swiftly sneaking something in his mouth. He was chewing on it still as he fell in pace with them. Hermione sent him a disgusted look but ignored it while Harry felt the room spin. Did he eat something wrong? No, if that were the case it wouldn't take effect so quickly would it? Did someone have a cold that he was infected with then? Harry didn't know and could care less. All he wanted to do right now was to just cuddle up in some blankets. Chills had been running down his spine just now and he did not particularly like that.
Their walk there seemed to last hours and Harry wasn't too sure if he should say something to break the silence or whether it was awkward at all. Fogged as his mind was he didn't really register everything around him. Thinking back that he had just left Ron and Hermione without notice, he squeezed Malfoy's shoulder. "We should have told them we were leaving."
As much as he liked making out with the other, it was beginning to feel like that still wasn't enough.
He'd just admitted another flaw to the Gryffindor. He'd done it again. Man, he really felt the urge to punch something.
He vaguely mentioned to the other and the violin had in his hands. The longer he stood there, the more it dawned on him that Malfoy must have gone here to be alone. Something rent useless now he had gone and entered, without permission, and stayed to watch - once again, without permission or an acknowledging nod.
Harry huffed. "True. Well, since you came up with that oh so brilliant idea, why don't you take the honors to gather those as well, hmm?" Malfoy was right, they should let others help decide on the party if they were gonna get all the houses together. Harry tried not to yawn again, making a wetness flow and glaze his vision. He was tired, yet he didn't want to fall asleep, not yet.
Harry almost dropped his cup as the other spoke. When he realized who it was, standing at the side of his bed with an angry glare his eyes widened. "You. This is not what it looks like." Well, it was. Obviously. He had gotten himself in the hospital wing after he had just left the room after promising to take better care of himself.
Malfoy nodded and followed the other back to the castle. As soon as they went inside, he could feel how cold it had been outside. The sudden warmth surprised him but felt incredibly good. "The great hall doesn't serve tea around this hour though," he noticed as they walked towards the entrance of the hall.
"Ah yes, no, of course - that's fine" he replied. He rolled his shoulders in hope to pop them, yet failing to do so. His body felt kind of stiff after all the constant sitting and laying around with any other movement. Well, besides the pacing around… An itchy feeling had also made way in the bottom of his legs due to the position they had been stuck in for quite a while now.
"Draco, there you are! That's great to hear, we have been setting up a list here as well. We should add them to it later."
The other had secretly hoped that the blonde would have come after him, but obviously, that guy only cared about himself. He walked towards the library, that potion homework wouldn't write itself.
To say Hermione was just surprised was an understatement. When she returned with her book, both Ron and Harry had been gone. She had groaned in frustration, cuz why couldn't they just stay put. However, after Ron came back she started to worry. Ron, on the other hand, was quite relaxed about it, as if their friend would just appear out of nowhere. Hermione looked at the blonde, eyebrow arched up. Ron stood behind her, glaring at the Slytherin. "And why would we believe you, Malfoy?" she bitterly asked. As if Harry would let Malfoy help him, especially when there were more suitable people Harry could have asked.
As he pressed himself closer to the other he let out a little whine. Had he acted like this that night as well? If so, he was surprised the other had put up with him. When Harry had dated Ginny he never really had any problems with giving her hugs, though his heart had felt fluttery. Then again, he had never shared a bed with her… Lingering on that thought, he suddenly felt his mouth move. Harry was silent himself until he realized what he had just said. 'Have you ever dated someone?'
"I doubt it's the room's doing though," he pointed out. It didn't take long for him to realize what this could imply, which made him speak up again. "I mean, you were sedated by that potion Pomfrey gave you, right?"
When he was still unable to fall asleep he had started to pace around the room and bang his head against the wall several times, with time intervals due to Madame Pomfrey coming at him and tucking him back in. There had been a moment he fell asleep, but a nightmare had shaken him. It had caused him to space around, even more, that drove the nurse crazy. When he started to talk to himself though she had forced him back in bed and given him another potion - whatever that might have been. It made his drowsiness worse, so he guessed it should help him sleep. It did. He slept for over three hours maybe, until the effects of the potion couldn't hold his nightmares back and he was back at square one.
"It's okay, I guess I would be frustrated somewhat as well if I were to be in your shoes." His eyes fell on the skates and he grinned. "I see you managed not to drown?"
The grin was still lingering on his face, possibly showing a bit of his excitement. He didn't really notice this though since he was slightly lost in his thoughts.
"I see I was being overly honest," he tried to cover up his slip-up, only failing as he voiced yet again his thoughts. He groaned and let himself sink through his knees back on the bed, hands overlapping his face. "You heard nothing."
It felt nice and warm to stand like this, so when the other brushed his fingers through his hair, Malfoy didn't complain. It felt nice, so why should he? He merely snickered, still slightly shocked from the whole thing.
Harry didn't want to move anymore, his limbs felt way too heavy. Fortunately, Hermione told Ron and him to stay there and wait for her. Ron, being stubborn, grinned and wondered how much he could dart between the shelves and return without her noticing, leaving Harry to his own devices. Harry didn't mind to have to wait there. He actually felt like he would fall over if he would do so anyway. Though on the other hand, he just wanted the day to be over with and let his body rest. His body felt weirdly heavy, yet awfully light as his head kept spinning. Maybe he should take something in against it…
The Slytherin shifted a little, creeping even closer and tightening the hug a bit. He wondered why this was so nice, and why he'd never done this before with anyone.
Yes this was weird, and yes it was very new to him, but then why did it feel so cozy? It felt like there was simply a cat sleeping on him. However, this wasn't a cat and if anyone were to walk in right now, Malfoy's reputation and carefully composed image were gone.
The blonde looked at him for a moment, still thinking about how he could also get rid of Potter's homework problem. There was a solution, but it would keep him in the hospital wing for a while longer. And as much as he wanted to return to his room, preferably with a nice cup of tea, he also promised the other to help. Besides, he didn't dislike having company. The Slytherin dungeons would just feel cold and lonely at this hour.
Harry was surprised by the sudden entrance of the two Slytherins, Parkinson more to the back as Malfoy was. Not to mention the other had stated his first name in the greeting, yet he made note that the blonde had probably done that because of the presence of the other students. As he realized the other kept eye-contact with him, a smile graced his features as well.
Harry let his hand linger somewhat longer on the other's face, smiling softly as he looked the other in the eye. "That would do," he said.
Honestly, he was turning into Granger. He let out a slightly irritated sigh and leaned back in his chair.
It still didn't feel right to the Slytherin, Potter had a whole family to return to. And as stiff and proper as his own family time during Christmas was, Draco did enjoy spending time with his family. The past few years it had been grim and hardly celebrated due to the war and the things leading up to it. This had never kept Draco from loving Christmas. He had always enjoyed the fancy dinners and family reunions. It had been the only time when the Malfoy manor seemed to warm up a bit. When his father could be seen joking, and when his mother really seemed to enjoy herself. He simply didn't want Potter to miss out on his own family time just because Draco had to.
His reaction couldn't be vague either. Since when did he even plan his answers thoroughly like this, though? It lay on the tip of his tongue, a small laugh, 'what? No. Haha, what made you even think that?'. Something along those lines. But nothing came out. He was just gaping like some stupid goldfish at the other, eyes shifting to different places as he had no idea what to do with himself.
He'd done it again, he'd called Malfoy 'Mal' again. Now that Draco thought of it, it was a miracle he'd never commented on it. Not really at least. He didn't comment this time either since he doubted Potter would care. The boy was nearly fainting. "You should go to Madam Pomfrey, I don't think anyone would want to wipe you off the floor. Go now before you faint." Why did he care, why was he concerned? He couldn't be concerned, he shouldn't care less about what state Potter was in. Then why did he dislike seeing the guy this miserable?
"Then could we please just cuddle?" His question was mumbly and rushed, but Draco was sure Potter had heard him. He wasn't going to repeat himself anyway. Nervosity and embarrassment washed over him, consuming him all at once. There was no turning back now.
When all of his classes had ended, he got reminded of the boy once more. He should still be in the hospital wing. He didn't have to visit him, not at all actually. But he couldn't help being curious as to how he was doing right now. A quick glance wouldn't matter, right?
"Ah yes, you two were hosting it together, right?. It's good to hear you two are not bickering anymore." Well, that wasn't exactly what he had expected for her to say, but at least that was out in the open now.
"Yeah," he simply replied, taking a sip from his water. "In fact, we're planning to have a Christmas celebration with all four houses. You know, to have the Christmas spirit" Hermione rose her eyebrows at that while Ron whistled. "Bringing the houses together, huh? That's uhm…" he glanced behind the other before eyeing him again. "You know there will be other Slytherin students staying back here as well, right?"
He had felt the other shake and only now realized his word hadn't really helped. Hesitantly, he brought one hand to the blonde locks to brush through them and bloody hell they were soft. "Sorry… It's okay, Mal. You're fine, I got you."
Outside the kitchen, he fell into a slower pace and absentmindedly wondered where he should sit as he could feel his heart hammer in his chest. Malfoy just kind of sticked to wandering around, sipping his tea as he did so. He eventually found a bench and sat down on it to finish his tea in peace. He gestured for Potter to sit down too. Malfoy would personally see to it that he finished his food if he liked it or not.
Slipping in his shoes he went back, through the common room where a few students were seated, back towards the great hall. He wasn't sure if Luna would be there, but he decided that he could best look there first.
Ruffling his own hair he searched for words to start. He knew what he wanted to say, but how? Contemplating, he failed to notice how long he let Malfoy wait. Draco was patient though. He rarely rushed things anyway. This also seemed like a difficult topic, especially with your ex-enemy. Maybe it had been a bit rude to make him talk about it, but Draco knew from experience that talking about it was way better than bottling it up. If Potter hadn't told his friends yet, maybe it was better to tell someone who wasn't quite a friend.
He had been staring at the bed for a bit now as he suddenly came back to his sense by the absence of any sound besides their breathing. "Giving in to deviate from your usual behavior you had fallen back to, just to help me doesn't count, I suppose?" he mentioned. It might have less an impact, but he had to say something or the other would start to wonder where his thought had wandered off to this time.
"I'm implying that there's always a few who manage to smuggle illegal stuff onto the grounds, nothing super serious of course, but fun at parties. Just funny drinks, magically modified stuff and such, can make things a lot more fun." Draco hadn't taken much of this stuff himself, he liked to know what he was doing and remember it afterward. "And I know, that sounds kinda shady, but no one's ever died from it and I think there's much shadier stuff out there that we can't even get our hands on, so…"
"We both know I wouldn't have listened to anyone at that time, it was bound to happen." The Slytherin sniffed, thinking about how much of a childish person he used to be back then. He'd really lacked some sense back then, he was able to admit that now. "But you, you weren't much of a careful person either. You kept returning to the forest that kept trying to kill you, no sense of danger at all really."
Then he thought about why exactly they'd gone back to their old-school rivalry. It seemed very childish all of a sudden. It had probably happened because Draco hadn't known how to act in front of Potter each time he saw him after the war. He didn't know how to justify his actions during and before the war, and he didn't know how to react to him standing up for him during the trial. Because of this, he'd reverted to the childish mockery, just to get a hold of himself in front of the Gryffindor.
He continued to brush his hand through the blond locks, holding back from the temptation to kiss the boy's forehead.
He was so tired. He hadn't slept that well last night and Draco being this pompous jerk really didn't help him out. With one heavy sigh, he tried to get rid of all the negativity in him. "You know what, fine. I'll act as if you're not some kind of drama queen. Now, if you would please let me work."
Harry watched the other stretch and let his eyes fall over the blonde's body, mesmerized for a moment until he snapped out of it as the other started to pace. Maybe he should decide to eat his food or bring the plate back. It would keep his thoughts in place, at least he hoped it would. Taking a piece of the bread he started munching on it, yet it didn't taste well. It might be him or because it had laid there for a while, but he decided to put the plate away. He stood up as well and grabbed his glass as well, drinking the last bit before he placed it on the plate. He should bring it back now.
He lifted his hand a bit, as to ask the other to stop walking. He turned back towards the lake and walked closer to it. When he reached the edge, he carefully put a foot on the ice. After making sure it wasn't breaking already, he lifted a bit more of his weight onto it, checking how sturdy it really was.
"Right, of course." Malfoy handed the other the list. "So, how are things going? Is there anything I've missed so far, considering the party?"
It was the most ridiculous expression the blonde had ever heard, but it was true. It would be a big enough distraction, Draco was sure of that.
"Potter!" Someone screamed from a slight distance. Harry didn't turn, knowing who it was just by the underlying tone and he didn't plan on spending time with that person. "Ignorant twat," the voice continued to mutter, this time a lot closer to him than before.
Somehow, he was kind of glad Potter had walked in. Draco had started to enjoy his presence, and even though it had seemed scary at first, he was glad the other knew about this hobby now. It was good to finally be able to share it with someone who he knew would treat it well. It was very nice. He didn't even feel scared or nervous again, it was actually the opposite now, quite calm and relaxed.
"We want to use the room of requirement and all houses are invited. We could really use the help to decorate and set the whole thing up, you know?" While the Ravenclaws reacted positively to his message, he saw the Hufflepuffs split up, one towards him and the other out of the great hall. Turned out that they were up to it and the other was fetching some friends. Harry was glad that the Ravenclaw he had talked to before carried some parchment around and flipped out the so-called 'enhanced quill' - he just wanted to call it a pen, but decided against it. If this went on like this, then he wondered if there would even be people against the whole idea.
Lightly, Harry let his head fall on the table forehead first as Hermione started ranting about how Parkinson was the worst person in the world, after Malfoy of course. He could never just come out and say it without Hermione trying to cast spells on him. She would believe someone cast a spell on him that caused him to see a kind side to Malfoy. But he honestly did, he just knew that the blonde wasn't actually all that bad. If he were, he wouldn't have wasted his time by helping him out with his homework. Would he?
He let go of the hug to guide the blonde towards the edge, setting foot on land again. He felt himself relax as he let his hand rest on his chest and closed his eyes for a bit, letting out a huff.
Malfoy could feel the heat creeping up to his cheeks. He just kind of stood there, frozen as the other boy panicked. His words were messy, his face was turning red and everything about the Gryffindor screamed nervosity and regret. Draco kept telling himself this was just because Potter had made it awkward, people tended to react kind of like this when things got awkward. It was all just a misunderstanding, and Potter, being the hot mess he always tended to be, was only making it worse for himself.
He almost dared to ask. His curiosity almost made the words slip from his mouth, but luckily his brain prevented that from happening. It was too complicated, even Malfoy wasn't sure what to think of it yet. All he knew was that even though it should be out of bounds, it highly interested him. It didn't repel him as much as it should.
Draco decided there was only one thing he could do to get attention. As Harry walked away, he ran after him, dropped himself onto the floor, and started rolling around dramatically. "Pottaaah!"
"Alright…" He nodded. Something in him wanted to continue bickering. Something in him wanted to scold the other for being such a prat, but this time he was thoughtful enough to ignore it. Instead, he noticed how Potter was looking dazed, again.
Draco wanted to tell the other how amazing he was, how much he felt for him and all sorts of stuff like that, but he couldn't.
He knew Potter had been joking, but who was he to let a comment like that slip by untouched? Besides… Hadn't they been trying to overpower each other like this for years?
Harry didn't really know how to respond to that, let alone had the will to do. He simply shook his head with a sigh and turned back around again - he really had to find Ron or Hermione to help him after all.
Draco assumed it had been his mother's wish to create the room but had never heard the full truth about why it was there. He simply loved it and was glad it existed. He was even more glad that Hogwarts had granted him the chance to revisit it when he wasn't at home.
"Shut up, Malfoy." Harry turned to find Draco's eyes. "How about you go to your daddy and cry 'cuz you failed to get people's respect?" He knew he was rambling, but without Ron or Hermione, he barely had any impulse control. "Well… I would… He hasn't got the time to reply every time though. Especially not when it's about some jerk called Potter." He replied.
"I understand," he replied. "I have made mistakes as well, we all do. Some of just make the ones that have more impact as others." In order to cut the conversation about the topic and lighten the mood, he pointed at the Christmas decorations. "So we should be grateful we can spend Christmas together. Everyone who stays at Hogwarts should come together like you said. It's our last year. We should treasure hat we have left."
Draco couldn't help but envy the other a bit. Potter had so many people who cared about him, who celebrated Christmas with him, who had amazing dinners with him, and who knitted him cozy sweaters.
That had surprised Harry quite a bit and he stalled his writings to look back at the blonde who had leaned back in his chair. Okay if this was some weird daydream due to his fatigue it might as well end now. He shifted back to his work before the other would notice his staring, trying to keep the words fresh in the back of his mind so he wouldn't have to ask the guy to repeat himself.
It caused a worried Gryffindor. All he could do for a moment was just stand there with the boy as he held his wrist. Oh man, how do they never give you social studies to teach you how to handle sad or traumatized people? When he felt a light breeze come past him he looked at his blanket. Would it be weird to open it up and let the other in? Honestly, Harry wasn't too sure if he could find any words right now but neither would it help at all if he just stood there. What he did know was that Malfoy wasn't the guy who would want to be seen in this broken down state by just anyone passing by.
Harry breathed out and laughed softly, averting his eyes for a bit. "Well, yeah, obviously. Then... what was it?" he softly spoke.
His voice had sounded very calm and low, but now that he thought about it, that could just be the thing that made it sound threatening.
Ron wasn't really sure how he felt about it, but as he had mentioned to Harry, he was willing to give the other a change. To prove he wasn't that bad, not anymore. Although Ron had to admit that the Slytherin hadn't called him nor Hermione names anymore since he started hanging around Harry. Maybe Harry was a good influence on the blond, Ron concluded.
The Slytherin gave him a perplexed look. "Scared of the forest, you mean? Well excuse me, but any person with a functioning pair of brains would do well to be scared of that. I'm sure you understand why, seeing as you've faced most of what lives there throughout the years already."
"Ron," Harry brought out in a whisper, though loud enough to make his friend turn his head towards him. "Wish them a happy Christmas for me." Ron smiled at him, offering him a hug.
Draco let out a relieved sigh. There was no way back now, but maybe he shouldn't care about that too much.
"You're wel-" He looked up in some kind of shock, cutting himself off as his mouth hung open. "You made that exact sound, didn't you?"
"Sure thing, but if no one knows what's going on it'll just continue. I understand that I'm not the person you want to talk to, but let me remind you that I've also spilled a little insecurity to you." Draco spoke, reminding himself of his mother. She would've said the same thing if it were Draco laying on a hospital bed.
Draco nodded and sat up a bit more. "So you wouldn't mind getting used to it?" He asked, his face turning a bit more red than usual. He couldn't care, all he wanted was to just cuddle and be cozy. It was stupid, ridiculous, unusual, and very random, but he still wanted it and he wasn't going to deny himself this.
Though the image of Snape kept lingering. He wondered why the man still seemed to hate him so much. Was it because he reminded him of his mom, Lily Evans, and the man still couldn't handle it? Maybe he shouldn't search for so many things to even occupy his mind if he wanted to rest, but his mind was overflowing with questions sometimes that just lingered.
When Draco finally realized what he was doing, he quickly looked away. That had not just happened, that was just because Potter had saved him a few times. People tended to like heroes, right? That was all just some kind of natural thing. It didn't mean anything weird at all.
That turned around quite quickly. But did he want the other to do his homework for him? Surely, Snape would put him in detention or give him a load of extra work to do if he messed this assignment up. Yet, what could he even offer the Slytherin? He would have to do it on his own. Or, well…
Because it was nice to feel the comfort of someone being close to him, no matter how often he told himself he didn't need it. Why did Potter just have to get so sleep-drunk and put Malfoy in a situation like this?
"You must really value that then," he mumbled. "And I just crash in to disturb you. Goodness, why didn't it just isolate the room, seclude it for others?" He ran his fingers through his hair, which did no good to it, and shook his head slightly.
Harry lifted his head, eyes finding the other's grey ones once again. "How much of all of that was weighing on your shoulders. Back then, I had always wondered why you acted so high and mighty and just saw you as some rich brat. But after all, you were just so unsure of yourself. No, I mean, not entirely unsure, more like uhm, ya know. Keeping an image. Just… Yeah. I feel selfish now I know how you felt about it all…"
"I know what he has done, so does he, no need to remind us. I… understand it's hard to look past it, but we can't keep things like this. We need to move forward now." Maybe he should have pronounced that differently, 'cause he could see the hatred in Ron's eyes.
They sat in silence, concentrating on their food as several students walked by. Some chose to go outside and enjoy the snow as Draco and Harry had done. Others went for the great hall to sit there and study or play games. Draco had never really understood why people did that in the great hall instead of the library or common room but suspected that they had their reasons to do so.
"I fell asleep because I thought you needed some good rest, and I thought that if I'd leave, you would just continue pacing the room so I stayed, for your own health. Did it for yer own good Potter." Merlin, he was so drowsy. He could really use some coffee. There was no way he'd really wake up before drinking that.
Somewhat unsure of his actions, Harry decided to scoot the other way and pat the bed to invite the other to his side. "Now," the corners of his mouth rose once again. "About our Christmas plans."
"I'm keeping you here until you can normally function again," the nurse, who was done examining Harry, sighed. "Try to take better care of yourself next time boy, this could have serious consequences. Fainting is just the first and least severe one." A hum left the black-haired boy's lips as he went to stare at the ceiling. He recalled how back at his uncle and aunt's house he would feel nauseous when he was locked up for long in the small, dusty space. He couldn't really comprehend why it would have such an impact on his body. Doesn't it like, adjust to circumstances over time...?
After a while, the ice became less dark again, and he dared to get back up. He walked the last bit towards the Gryffindor and kind of leaned against him, half hugging him out of relief as soon as he reached him. Was he actually shaking? He didn't know, and he didn't care. All he knew was that he was glad to be safe again. He mumbled a few soft curse words and buried his face in the fabric of the other's robes.
"After that, the potion should turn green," Malfoy began. "If it doesn't, add more mushroom. Easy as that. I hope you do know what comes after that?" He looked up to the other, searching for a sign that told him he didn't have to repeat his whole explanation again. After that explanation, the rest came back to him and his mouth shaped in a small 'o'. "Yes, yes. My bad," he grinned. He picked up his quill, dipped it in the ink and continued writing.
A frown edged on the other's face. Malfoy was worried about him, that shouldn't surprise him as much as it did. They had become friends, after all, it was a friend-thing to do - worry about a friend in the hospital wing that is.
The boy with his wild, messy hair had paused shortly at the other's request. What was he even doing? Harry had silently watched the other try the sturdiness of the frozen lake before the blonde really set his weight on it and his own breath caught in his throat. He had even prayed for whatever being out there that the ice wouldn't break. But now, as he had come closer to the edge of the lake, he could see Malfoy actually enjoying himself just sliding on the slippery ice of the frozen lake. It seemed childish, but he knew how he had enjoyed doing that with Ron and Hermione before the war in the earlier years as well.
"I'm afraid I am, yes," he said, gently smiling down at the other as he touched his face softly to wipe some of his tears away.
"A date," he murmured, deep in thoughts. Now Ron and he were in a fight it was even more likely the two would go on one, right?
It took the Slytherin a whole lot of patience to not morph his face into an annoyed sneer. Luckily, his voice stayed calm, be it a bit cold. "Read the paper, Granger." Distrustful she scanned his eyes before she let her eyes fall on the crumbled parchment. Seeing as he almost wanted to push it in her face, she decided to take it and at least take a look at it. She immediately recognized the handwriting. That was Harry's alright.
Harry really seemed troubled. It annoyed Malfoy to only be able to watch, instead of making it go away. He simply didn't have a clue as to how he could get rid of the other's problems, due to a lack of experience and knowledge on this kind of subject. Of course, this was entirely his own fault, but still. It bugged him. And if something bugged a Slytherin, there was a guarantee that it would be crushed and gotten rid of eventually. He just needed to figure out how.
Draco felt shaky, sad, and was a complete mess, but in an intense need of appreciation and care. Potter was the embodiment of these things. Potter was what he needed.
He walked up to Granger since he thought she'd have the least aggressive reaction and would actually try to figure out what had happened. Weasley would just get angry. He cleared his throat to alarm them of his presence and held up the paper as he spoke. "Potter's in the hospital wing, he nearly fainted due to a lack of sleep and food. He's still a bit dazed, but I do think he wants to see you guys, so that's why I'm here."
He tried to listen. After all the other had wanted to talk to him about gravity-resistant trees when he had been searching for something that could help him breathe underwater with the Triwizard tournament. He had brushed it off while the other had probably just wanted something to talk about with Harry, as these trees were probably used for the brooms the players in quidditch used.
Harry didn't deserve that, Draco didn't want to hurt him, but it was so hard for him to get over himself.
"Just before you say anything," he started, his voice a bit lower and hoarser than usual because he'd just woken up. "You were the one who started to act all sleep drunk all of a sudden, and who started to cuddle up to me, you know. Not the other way around." He paused and yawned. The words didn't come out as easy and clean as they usually did. He did continue, however.
It had been nice, the quiet undramatic moment just before that girl had come. He wondered if tomorrow things would be back to old. He kinda wished he didn't have to endure the next day with Draco challenging him again and the like.
"I'm a businessman Potter," he said. "I'll do it if you've got something interesting to offer me in return."
"If I made the great Malfoy show such weakness towards me and let me sleep oh so graciously on his lap, I guess I'm not allowed to actually tell you off." As he stared the other in his eyes, he felt the corners of his mouth rise as of why he bit on his lip in hopes to prevent it.
"Need a description of that," he expressed his thought. Whether it would help him through the night and stop the nightmare was something he both hoped for as that he felt like it wasn't that. Yet he had no other option, now did he?
While they waited, Harry's eyes wandered around the kitchen to fall on one particular house-elf carrying candy.
Soon enough, fingers found blond locks and the glasses-wearing boy breathed in deeply as he pressed his face in the soft mop of hair. If they both wanted this so badly, then why did they hold themselves back? What had stopped them?
"Yes, Hermione does," he hummed, "but it's not as easy to understand." He kept writing, not minding the silence that fell back. He would have been surprised by the guy asking about Hermione if he wasn't concentrating on his work.
"Should I even ask what happened this time, or instantly assume it's because you don't know how to take care of yourself?" Yes, Draco was fuming, but not because he hated Potter. It wasn't like that at all. Maybe it was even the opposite. He was angry because he was worried. Though, it probably didn't look like that to the Gryffindor. He should've thought about that, but decided to not bother at the moment.
To his relief, the girl nodded and didn't seem to disapprove of his actions. "I'm glad you're finally trying to get over it, you've been a real mess, moping over Potter."
Never had he thought he would feel betrayed due to the fact that his best friend wouldn't be on a date outside, in the freezing air.
Both amused and pleased he watched the other enjoy himself, setting their 'task' to find Ron to the far back of his mind. Ron could wait, he had Draco Malfoy here, who was actually having fun. It was a rare sight and he was sure to capture it and save it.
He couldn't say it wasn't fun though, because it was. If Draco didn't enjoy mocking others, he'd never become Potter's rival anyway. It seemed like the boy in question had also discovered this.
The room grew darker, and the castle became quieter. Before he knew it, Draco was starting to doze off as well, due to how comfortable and warm he was. He didn't fight it, and soon enough his head dropped to the side as his breathing got into a slow and steady rhythm.
Harry looked up for a second before looking down on his notes again. "I would say 'be as kind as to help me then' but then again, you're a Malfoy. Slytherin to top." He was silent for a while as it dawned on him that he had actually written quite some nonsense on his paper and tried to ignore the heat that sprawled to his cheeks. "Don't you have anything better to do, anyway?"
Draco neatly sat down beside him, keeping his distance, but being close enough to look at the book and explain it. Yes, he was actually doing this. What a disgrace…. "Right, first of all, the information you've already have. You can completely discard that." He took a new roll of parchment and spread it out on the desk. He then continued to explain what was wrong, and what it should be. He could've done that with kind words, but he decided to put it as it was: harsh and clear.
He stirred and turned to find an angry nurse stomping over at him. He was dragged back to the hospital wing. Back in the bed, he glared hard at the cup with the potion. He was so not drinking that.
"Off you go mister Longbottoms. This boy needs to get taken care of, you go and take care of yourself," Madam Pomfrey said, waving the blond off. Neville gave an apologetic smile before he headed out, leaving him alone with the nurse. She stared at him and Harry found it both hard to look away and not meet her gaze. He knew he ought to have looked after himself a little better as this. Yet who could blame him? He was having fun playing outside with the snow together with his friends, too bad he caught a cold.
Okay. Yep. This was absolutely the closest someone had ever gotten to Draco. He was not used to this at all and was actually a bit paralyzed by the other boy's actions. He didn't dare to move and dared even less to speak. A big part of him wanted to shake the other off, but there was this small part holding him back.
It was clear Potter wasn't in the mood to talk, but he cared little about that. "I want you to forget what happened just now." That surprised the Gryffindor. Forget what he just said? Well, that little- "I'm not sure what you're talking about Malfoy." He let a silence linger to give the blond time to form an answer before cutting in. "Or you must be talking about the way you had been rolling around the floor? I mean, I knew you were in Slytherin but that it would mean you would just up and go act like a snake all the way?"
Before all of this, he had never even thought about kissing the Slytherin, but right now, he barely couldn't think of anything else.
Draco and Pansy ended up finding the busy group in the great hall, already planning stuff out. Draco noticed that it wasn't just Potter and Lovegood, but also a few others from various houses. What would they say if they discovered that Malfoy was hosting this party too? Would they still be willing to help, or even come?
Harry folded the blanket back around himself, face nuzzling in the blanket for a bit before he decided to form words. "I'm glad you seem to think so as well," he grinned shortly. "I had already forgiven you for most of your actions, I mean I don't think I would have helped you if I had been still mad about it…"
"I should just get this done and over with or else I might forget it and die anyway - though I doubt you'll care about that part." He flipped through the pages, stopping on the page he had left off, before spinning in his seat towards the blonde. "Now, explain."
"Why did you assume they'd be on a date anyway? I'd say they're in the common room." He mentioned while kicking some snow just to do something. "And then there's of course, the possibility that they're in the room of Requirement. I know many Slytherins use it for… Well… Things that need privacy, so maybe Gryffindors do too, I'm not sure. I mean there's no place in this school where you can truly be alone."
"Well, yeah... I'm afraid that I can't deny that I can't get that person out of my head." A long sigh left his throat and he looked up again, only to let his gaze fall on the wall in a dazed way. For him to realize he was crushing on the person who was standing only a few meters away. Draco Malfoy had never been on Harry's list of 'potential date partners', but then again had he never been all that busy with dating. With Voldemort after him he never really had been given a lot of time to do so.
Malfoy nodded softly. "I guess so," he replied, his voice hollow. After making so many emotions rush through his body by telling Potter so much about himself, he just felt a bit empty. He appreciated the other's attempt to lighten the mood, but couldn't really get into it. He was just glad Potter accepted him.
"Pomfrey might have some though," he seemed to ask it rather as to propose going that way. Well, it might be tricky as he had just left the place and weird as it had been him who had been put in the hospital wing. Harry wondered what Pomfrey was thinking about the two hanging out this much all of a sudden. Then again, Pomfrey hadn't been there when they left and he didn't feel like going through all the stuff there.
He hadn't expected Potter to be so considerate. That he'd move him away from the door. At first, he hadn't understood why, but when he'd got it, he'd felt strangely thankful. And when he started to mutter awkwardly, spreading his arms, Draco realized that he didn't know what to do either. That they were both confused. The thing was, that Draco wasn't used to this kind of gesture. He wasn't a physical person at all.
As his gaze fell on Luna, he was reminded of the party he had discussed with a specific Slytherin. "Hey Luna, you were gonna stay at Hogwarts over break, right?"
"Yeah, I got that," Draco softly replied as he carefully worked himself up a bit to clean some of the books and parchment away. Should he leave, or stay here? There was no reason for him to stay, now that studying wouldn't happen anyway, but did he want to leave?
"Well... You're not wrong actually. There. I said it, now give me back my arm. I'm going back to my room."
"Getting uncomfortably friendly, I see?" The blond boy responded, refraining from looking too surprised. Hiding behind disgust and irritation, his to-go escape plan. He and Potter weren't friends, where'd that idea even come from? Utterly stupid… right…?
Draco quickly understood what Potter was trying to do, and got him some paper and that new quill from his bag. Then he handed it to the other, also handing him a book to have something to write on. He hadn't mentioned this idea, because he'd thought the guy was too dazed to actually write something that made sense. But if he came with the idea himself, it should be alright.
"Maybe we should just find some of your housemates and ask them personally instead," he grinned. In return, Luna smiled and agreed as they, once again, returned to the great hall.
If it hadn't been for his peak of confidence, he would've stood in the entrance forever. He walked up to the group of students with a faint smile, hoping they would let him explain himself before they judged him.
"You're comparing the sound I just made to a Christmas miracle…?" Draco raised one eyebrow. What was in that potion, had it made him high or something? It was confusing, and Draco wasn't used to Harry being like this towards him, but he didn't dislike it. It was actually a bit endearing, and the comment had maybe flattered him a bit. "You've never seen me laugh genuinely?" He asked, hesitantly.
A sudden stroke of anger and bitterness hit him, raising the volume of his voice as he continued. "They left me," he cried, "those bastards left me here, running away now that they're hunted for the shit they've caused. They can't do that!"
Draco, too, could feel himself melt into the other's touch, suddenly forgetting about the world around them entirely.
A hum was not what Malfoy probably wanted as an answer, but it left Harry's lips almost too soon. He tilted his head to the side in thought before he eyed the other again. "Well, yeah. Ron can be a little stubborn sometimes… But I guess that made us such good friends. I understand him, I mean the war has been hard on most people. Yet I just… I can't leave it like this."
Draco sniffed, not entirely uninterested. "I've seen some Ravenclaws carry those around… An enhanced quill, right?" "It actually is-nevermind. An enhanced quill alright. It takes quite some while to run out of ink. Very useful if I say so." He moved it somewhat closer to the blonde in hope of sealing the deal. He didn't really know what else to offer him.
He wasn't sure what to say next. All he could think off, or rather, all the soft spots he knew from Potter, were a risky subject. He couldn't mock him with them and thus didn't. Instead, he sat down on the bed next to his and stretched. "I suppose all we can do is bicker, right?"
It was as if all the frustration, all the tension between them that had been building up for years, was flooding out and pouring over them.
With little resistance from his impulse control, he wrapped his arms tightly around the other to press him further in, another breath of relief coming from him. "For Merlin's sake, Mal, have a little mercy on my heart. What were you even thinking, that part was way too fragile."
Of course, before Draco could enter the dungeons, he had to go through a hallway where a certain person was having some sort of midlife crisis on a bench. Of course, this certain person was Potter, because this universe really liked to fuck him over sometimes. He felt himself tense up a bit but used this to keep the calmest, unphased expression as he walked past the boy, ignoring him completely. He had apologized already if Potter didn't take his excuse, that wasn't his problem.
It felt as if he indirectly approved of a part of Malfoy's personality. For some reason this made his insides squirm, almost making him feel giggly. He was glad Potter approved of him. He turned to look at the other.
A shiver raced up the blonde's spine after the other had briefly let his lips flutter over Draco's neck. Heat spread over his face, which luckily, was buried in the other's sweater. He loved the feeling of fingers raking through his hair, and he loved being this close and comfortable, but he hadn't expected contact any more intimate than that. His neck still seemed to be tingling a bit. He didn't dislike it. They both seemed to be a bit sedated by each other.
It wasn't hard to notice, really. "Stuck already?" He asked, keeping back a sigh. Ah, he was obvious as hell it seemed. He slowly turned, biting on his lip and raising an eyebrow. "Maaaybe?" Malfoy instantly decided Potter wasn't allowed to make that kind of face again. "Right. Where?"
He wouldn't have thought that this would come from him staying over at Hogwarts over break with this rival-to-friend relation growing to this. Who would have thought Draco Malfoy would lay in his arms, showing Harry his fragile side like this?
That stuck up brat. "And after how you spoke to me about my father, you actually think I would just go ahead and listen to that request?" Draco raised one eyebrow as if Harry had just said something entertaining. "I thought the Gryffindor in you would naturally do the right thing, we'll see what that is. I'm just here because asking you to forget about it is a lot easier than asking a group of people to forget about it. It's a matter of efficiency, I'm not depending on you."
"Merlin, let me wake up on time," he mumbled as soon as he had finally arrived on the side of his bed. "I don't need both Snape and Malfoy breathing down my neck."
While Malfoy and he had been fighting in the past years, he had never really hated the guy, nor his friends. Though he couldn't be sure to say Hermione felt the same way about the girl. Deep in thought, he started to play with the blanket, humming now and then. There had to be an easy way though, right? After all, if these guys really were befriended with the blond, they should accept his decisions, right?
Being around Potter kind of felt like being around a puppy, or a very friendly dog. He'd noticed this before, but was still kind of charmed by it. Draco had to admit that he liked his kindness and acceptance. None of his other friends were like this, it had to be some kind of Gryffindor thing. Gryffindors were often kind and warm towards others, but Draco had never been on the receiving end of this. It was nice, and maybe a tad addicting. He had to admit that he was drawn to Potter's warmth like a moth to a lightbulb. His only fear was if it would burn him.
The dark-haired boy let out a little hiss at the nails that sunk in his flesh, yet decided not to mention it. The Slytherin was a mess in his arms, turned from the cunning guy to a puffy mess.
It was a little weird to just sleep with a friend like this, he had to admit that, though he had to say that his relation with Malfoy had been weird from the start and therefore this was okay. Unlike he had thought, he didn't fall asleep almost immediately. Due to his rapid heartbeat, and his focus on it, he just couldn't fall asleep. Malfoy could hear it, feel it even, he was sure of that. With a somewhat content sigh, he nuzzled his head in the fabric that was draped around the other's frame.
"Very philosophical," the blonde replied dryly. "Though I believe that if you want an empty mind, you should go to Weasley, he's got one. Must be very quiet in there."
Ignoring the screaming in his head, the 'you must be misunderstanding this!', he pressed back against the blond's lips.
Draco had doubted if the other would actually stay but found himself looking for what he should say now that it was clear he would. He'd forgotten that a remark like the one he'd made required further information. He was obligated to explain himself.
It probably didn't make much sense, but Draco didn't care to explain himself. He was currently engulfed in the smell of burnt wood and something soapy, which had become a bit familiar to him by now. Maybe it was just the fact that Potter had saved him, or that he just happened to be the first person Malfoy could reach after being so scared, but he had a very calming air around him.
Even though his parents had died before he'd even been able to meet them, he still had a family and a home to return to. Draco wished he could be a part of a thing like that.
Harry groaned once again when he was pulled up and breathed out deeply as the blanket lay on the floor. He stared at it as he answered the blonde. "Couldn't sleep with my mind occupied."
Draco could practically feel the other's eyes on his back, but ignored it and continued as if he were alone. He eventually got really into it and couldn't prevent a smile from playing around his lips as he focused on the music sheets.
As the day went on, Potter popped up in his mind several times. Draco tried to push it away and succeeded most of the time, but it kept coming back. He tried to pay attention to his classes since that'd spare him some revising later, but it just wouldn't work that day. In the end, he just got so annoyed that he almost blamed it on Gryffindor. It wasn't fair, he knew that, but in a way, it was his fault right?
Pansy, sharp as she was, had noticed, however. She gave Draco a strange expression while ripping small pieces off her bread. "I'm still curious…" She said. "I know," Draco answered, not looking phased by her words at all. She was testing him, trying to get her answer by provoking him into emotional reactions. Smart, but Malfoy knew how to deal with this.
Somewhat against his will, he made his way to the place he knew the man would be, the dungeons. He honestly wished he didn't have to go, but after last time he didn't dare to wait with handing in his work. On his way, he stopped. He hadn't finished the thing yet.
This room seemed quite like a peaceful place, as a room made purely to drink coffee and tea and look pretty. A room from paintings in which the people were looking calm, had smiles on their faces. While he had never really seen Lucius Malfoy treat his son all that kindly, he had no idea what the man was like behind closed doors. He didn't dare to ask as well, that was not something he should ask. Rather, they should think about stuff like the party. That was what he came here for anyway.
The Slytherin walked to the sofa and put his stuff down. A few music sheets were already placed on the small table, probably containing his favorite pieces.
"You couldn't have told them, and they wouldn't have believed me. They'll find out eventually, you're not dying." The blonde told him. Maybe it was because he'd been taught to be self-dependant all throughout his childhood, or maybe it was because most Slytherins tended to keep their issues to themselves. Whichever reason it was, to Malfoy it didn't seem important to notify the whole school about this fainting problem. "What do you think it is anyway?" He asked as they neared the hospital wing.
"I swear, if you're going to say you're not hungry I will personally force some food down your throat Potter. No more hospital wing trips." It sounded like a threat, but really that wasn't how he'd meant to say it.
"Maybe you have to sit down with them and spill your genuine thoughts and feelings about it," he murmured.
Draco didn't know how to feel about this and just kind of looked away a bit flustered. "Christmas with Potter… That's set then," he mumbled, suppressing a chuckle. This was still all very ridiculous.
It was true that Slytherins respected each other's boundaries. Pansy, however, didn't seem to do so. She never had, Draco reminded himself. "I can assure you, that's all there is to it," he said, his voice a tad colder than before, hoping that this would tell her that she should leave the matter be.
He knew they weren't sad tears, but he still didn't want the other to cry and mess his pretty face up.
"Yes, I suppose so. I think you could do with some sleep, and I'm not needed for that." He stretched as he got up from his slightly crouching position. "I'll try to notify your friends, but I doubt they'll believe me... "
"Morning, Harry." She looked him over with an eyebrow raised. "You seem… quite fresh yet tired somehow."
While they had grown much closer these days, he shouldn't get his hopes up nor expect anything. He wouldn't want him anyway. He ruined the life laid out for him, though he knew Malfoy wasn't all too keen on that future. Harry couldn't possibly decide to risk their friendship.
Draco noticed how weird this situation was, how unusual it was for him to be so personal with someone. But the only reaction he could manage was hoarse and broken. "I am…" It came out more like some sort of question. He was so confused. Several emotions were trying to get a hold of him and he didn't know what to do with it. Not with himself, but neither with the boy standing in front of him like a lost burrito.
"Surely, you must also know that if you really do become friends with him, the whole school will know. Trying to keep it from me will be useless." "I know," Draco replied, his voice low. This had obviously annoyed Pansy. She went quiet but was nearly attacking her bread instead of just gently ripping pieces off. "Fine. Your problem then. I like a bit of a show anyway."
"I'm willing to because last time had a positive effect on my sleep as well," the Slytherin explained. "I'm purely doing this for my own wellbeing." Well, that wasn't completely true, but it felt better than saying 'I want you to be well-rested and if I can help I will'. He understood that all of this confused the Gryffindor. Draco himself wasn't coping with it that well either. But maybe it wasn't bad, maybe they just had to get used to it.
The kitchens looked quite chaotic when Draco entered after Harry. House-elves were walking around with plates and dishes, preparing food or cleaning things. He really hadn't expected the kitchens to look like this, and suddenly appreciated his meals a lot more. It wasn't like he'd never seen house elves work before, the Malfoys had quite a few of them as well, but he'd never seen this many in one place work like this. Back at the Malfoy manor, he'd rarely seen them, they weren't treated as kindly there as they were here.
There was nothing stopping them from spending days in this room, but after all, they were still human.
Draco hummed a 'yes', but then realized he had actually been dozing off. It was all just so warm and soft, how could he not fall asleep? However, he did understand why Harry hadn't fallen asleep yet, and why he couldn't. After all, this embrace thing was very unusual. His mind was probably spinning just as much as Draco's was.
Being near to the other shouldn't make much of a difference, but once again Draco realized that it did.
"You're crazy, you know that? But well, if it's thick enough I guess you could do that. Now as for your tea." He pointed with a little wave back to the castle, one hand pressing in Malfoy's lower back to guide him away. "I'll just worry about that instead of your weird liking to scaring the bloody hell out of people."
Harry raised an eyebrow. "What you were implying?" If he were to be honest, he had never heard of the contents of the parties. Surely, he knew that the houses held their own parties, but he didn't really know what to expect. Were the Slytherins wild party animals or something that he mentioned this?
Malfoy wanted to curse at the other, he wanted to make him tell what was going on exactly. Why didn't he care, what was wrong with his mood?
He didn't dare to look up due to the rapid pounding of his heart he could hear clearly and the heat that was crawling to his cheeks. This probably ruined their friendship but he felt attacked at this moment and he couldn't really handle it in his current state. Having given up on keeping his mouth shut he started to add in a low voice, directed to himself as he was in deep thought as he tried to retreat from the other's warmth.
Draco slipped back into his usual cold posture and tidied his robes, which had been wrinkled due to his little dramatic display a few minutes ago. Maybe he shouldn't have done that after all. As he walked back towards the Slytherin dorms, it dawned on him that he'd spoken badly about his father. Not only that, but he'd also shown a very vulnerable side of himself. In front of Potter. Malfoy didn't agree with his father, but he did respect him. He was grateful for the protection he offered. Speaking ill about him in front of all those students…
Yes, it would be great if students from all four houses would join in. Not only would it be a 'jolly Christmas at Hoggy Hogwarts' it would also be a real come-together. No one had to be left out unless they wished not to participate of course. The teachers wouldn't bother them either, as the room of Requirement would most definitely provide them with a place they could just celebrate Christmas their own way without the teachers barging in. This would also be a good way to let Malfoy wiggle himself back in the masses. Harry knew that most students disliked the blonde Slytherin, but they might allow his presence near again. It was Christmas after all and Harry just knew that Malfoy felt bad for his actions.
Malfoy leaned back again. Something about all of this satisfied him. Teaching someone, and then seeing the result was quite satisfying. Maybe that's why people became teachers. He continued to kind of look around, lost in his thoughts.
He walked into the hospital wing and started looking for Madam Pomfrey. She'd know what to do. Draco found Pomfrey in her office and immediately asked her to please take a look at Potter. She seemed a bit confused at first, which didn't surprise him since nearly the whole school knew about Malfoy's and Potter's usual rivalry, but this was about a sick student. She got up and walked up to Harry, who was holding himself up against a wall. The first thing she did was guide him to one of the beds, then she commanded him to sit or lay down so she could ask him a few things. After that, she started a quick checkup to see if this was a natural or magical issue. Malfoy just kind of watched, he wasn't sure what else to do. Suddenly he felt like an intruder. This was a medical issue, those were quite personal, right? Who was he to just stand there, invading Potter's private doctor moment thing?
Harry cleared his throat when he realized his previous intimate action, somewhat unsure of why the other hadn't said anything about it yet. Didn't it bother him?
There was a moment that Madame Pomfrey came walking in with a student that had gotten sick by eating too much. She had been busy with the child until she went to get something and passed by him. He hadn't seen her surprised look then, but when she came to him, a frown on her face, he was pulled back to the here and now.
Harry groaned. "If I even make it there." He kept himself up by leaning on the table next to him. In all honesty, he was ready to leave to get himself checked upon yet he didn't want his friends to worry about him. Surely, if it were anyone else he could have asked them to tell his two buddies, but this was Draco Malfoy. They might rather believe Snape telling them as the blonde. Harry bet Hermione would try to get Malfoy to tell them what he did to their friend, while in fact, Malfoy was just being nice.
"Leave Ron out of this, Malfoy," Harry mumbled, trying to concentrate on the words he was writing down. "Does it anger you?" A small smirk spread across Draco's face. "I am merely displeased with your words," came his response to the blonde. He didn't feel like looking up, knowing that the Slytherin probably had a smirk plastered on his face. "Now, I do believe your business with me is done, so if you just leave and let me do my stuff. I'm sure you have another letter to write to your father."
"You must be very dense than," he sneered back. Malfoy had been pestering Potter since year one because of one simple reason: he was incredibly easy to anger. Draco always got the reaction he wanted, it was honestly the most entertaining thing.
"I feel like a child," he mentioned, having progressed the scene somewhat by now. "That's… not surprising actually, I mean you're being fed…" Draco let out a small, almost laugh-ish sniffle. This whole scene was just too idiotic. He really hoped Potter was dazed enough to not remember this had ever happened afterward. Harry looked at him with his mouth still open, eyes slowly widening. "It can laugh." He made it sound as if he just figured out a miracle, something like that he figured how to survive on Mars or something. Now gawking at the Christmas tree he started to slowly speak. "Miracles do happen. It's Christmas time at last…"
Harry frowned. Malfoy was right, why did he just assume they wouldn't be in the common room? They had often spent their time there after all, even if they had been around other people. Hermione would maybe drag Ron to the library, and if she wanted a kiss she simply pecked his lips.
As Malfoy had spoken a few took that as a sign to leave while others just took a few steps away to settle down on the tables again. The girl behind the blond had kept a look of amusement through the whole ordeal and it made him wonder if something was funny about it, yet he decided not to ask. Instead, he grabbed for a glass to fill with water while he studied the list of students.
He'd never taken the proper time to think or feel anything about it. Now that he did, he realized that the emotions he'd put away had been piling up. The letter had affected him, contrary to his own beliefs. He felt hurt, and abandoned. He had been making things up to hide the true meaning of the letter.
It seemed like the world had just stopped turning to allow them to take their time with this, but there was no way that could've actually happened.
He looked around and fiddled a bit with his robes. "Sorry, you were probably not waiting to hear me whine about excuses."
"Oh my, Malfoy. I didn't know you knew muggle memes, how interesting~" Harry grinned, making sure he kept walking.
Pomfrey mumbled a few things about a potion and how she would be right back as he sipped his hot drink. He finished the cup and sneaked out of the bed to get away from the room.
Potter was sitting at one of the tables in the back of the library when Draco strode in, wearing a grim expression and ignoring the other students. He leaned on one of the chairs and cleared his throat to indicate his presence. Harry allowed his eyes to slowly slid away from the potions book to find Draco Malfoy looking down at him. God, if there was anyone he didn't want to see right now… His eyes narrowed. "What do you want this time Malfoy?"
Draco got the stuff he needed, made sure it was in a small bag that no one would suspect, and hurried off towards the room of requirement. Now, this room had always been some sort of safe haven to him. He'd been using it to practice since his fourth year, and the room had always taken the same shape of a certain room in the Malfoy manor that he felt very familiar with. It was like a little trip back in time, back to his childhood. The only thing it lacked was his mother to watch him.
It seemed like she wanted to continue interrogating Malfoy, but restrained herself. They were in the common room, after all, it wouldn't be appropriate to cause a scene.
Well, maybe that was because he had never played any musical instrument himself that he had never bothered about it. If he were to have played the piano or violin or something himself, the chances of him paying any interest in it would be severely higher than it was right now.
Draco didn't know what he'd expected after last night. Had he expected to wake up with the Gryffindor still next to him? Maybe that was a bit of a bad assumption, seeing as he had made the other confess just before they went to sleep. It wouldn't be weird for the other to look for some privacy after that…
Harry frowned, not recalling having said that for a moment until he did. A short groan left him, short due that he cut himself off. "I let that slip huh…" Well, there was no denying that anymore, the other had heard him say it after all. Shrugging, as far as he could in this position, he tried to make it seem as not that big a deal he said that, while it actually really was. "Well, yeah. I do."
Ron was the first to come to him at the beginning of his first year at Hogwarts. They had become good friends over the years and Hermione had even joined them, making them known as the Golden Trio. He knew they would have some issues with him suddenly coming up with 'hey I have befriended Malfoy, you two should too' but his emotions had ruled him and he hadn't been reasonable when he spoke to Ron. If it were Hermione, things might have turned out differently. But now Hermione avoided him in order to both not anger her boyfriend as to force the two to talk. Harry hadn't seen Ron ever since their argument as well… It had made him both mad at the other as himself.
"It happened before I could think about it, but I'm not that shallow. I'm not trying to play around with you."
"Great." Draco stepped back but hesitated. Potter seemed very agitated. It'd be a shame to let that go to waste. "That potion requires a boomslang skin, not bloodroot," he remarked while scanning the list of sloppily written words beneath the other boy. "As much as I enjoy watching Snape roasting you over the tiniest mistakes, I can't stand stupidity."
Draco frowned and thought about a way to distract Potter from the dark lord. That wasn't an easy task, especially because no one could control dreams, but maybe there was a way. "You need something that'll occupy your thoughts more than Voldemort." He eventually concluded, after having thought it through a few times.
Potter was sitting at one of the tables in the back of the library when Draco strode in, wearing a grim expression and ignoring the other students. He leaned on one of the chairs and cleared his throat to indicate his presence. Harry allowed his eyes to slowly slid away from the potions book to find Draco Malfoy looking down at him. God, if there was anyone he didn't want to see right now… His eyes narrowed. "What do you want this time Malfoy?"
"I mean… this was discussed during class, but you're usually busy with anything but the class, so, this doesn't surprise me." He stopped for a bit. "Snape isn't exactly the kindest either, he doesn't reward students in the right way. It should be based on knowledge, not houses." It sounded like a thing a Slytherin would never say, but it still fits with one of the main Slytherin traits: wanting to achieve things. Some preferred to do that by cheating, but most purebloods actually played a fair game.
As he let it sink in he slowly nodded. Well, it was quite to be expected for someone like him to play an instrument. For some reason, it seemed to make sense that people from families like Malfoy made their children play an instrument.
"What you decide to use for that is up to you, I'm just pointing it out to you," Malfoy quickly explained. It had probably sounded a bit weird, him telling Potter to look for some company during his sleep. Yes, that absolutely sounded ridiculous.
Now the other had stopped playing and was facing him, Harry immediately regretted his decision, he had intruded this place after all. Malfoy seemed to cherish this place, or else he wouldn't be here. His mouth moved without a sound. Honestly, what was he, a fish?
What should he do? Could he just pretend it had never happened, and if so, did he want that? Did Potter want to forget about it? It had been nice, and Draco was sure they'd both gotten a healthy amount of sleep, which was great.
Malfoy nodded and turned towards the nurse's office. He knew she wouldn't let him go without being sure there would be someone looking after him, making sure he would actually take better care of himself.
"Hey Mal?" He started somewhat unsure. "Do you think you and Ron could get along if I had a word with him? Or we could just go and talk to him together, I don't really know. I'm not sure what to say about it, but it would make things… Easier. One thing less on my mind you know?"
"What?" Harry felt a rush of panic. Had he said something wrong to make the other feel bad? "No, no of course not. It's fine. I'm glad you can just be honest with me about that."
The man really had problems with dealing with students, Harry thought to himself, barely flinching as he realized that oh yeah, the man had entered his mind before. He hoped he hadn't let it slip.
"Thank you," Malfoy sat down on the sofa and gently placed his violin next to it. "But I'm not going to play at the party, sorry. You're actually the fourth person to hear me play, my parents and Pansy being the previous three. I wouldn't... I just don't think I could play at the party."
Pulling back to stroke his thumb over the other's cheek as he gazed in the eyes that reflected the head over heels him in them.
That had surprised Harry quite some bit and he stalled his writings to look back at the blonde who had leaned back in his chair. Okay if this was some weird daydream due to his fatigue it might as well end now. He shifted back to his work before the other would notice his staring, trying to keep the words fresh in the back of his mind so he wouldn't have to ask the guy to repeat himself.
It went silent again, which caused another thought to pop up in Draco's head. Potter hadn't taken care of himself, why? And why hadn't his friends noticed this yet? Draco didn't expect the Gryffindor to be good at hiding emotions or feelings, so at least Granger should've noticed.
Malfoy made him feel weak, made him feel like he was falling down a cliff. He grew both hot and cold by just simply staring at the other, and it scared him.
But wait, did he even have class? Pomfrey would've woken them up already if that were the case. Draco suddenly remembered that it was Christmas, the holidays had already started. They didn't have class, and he didn't have to hurry at all. He could just take his time, fetch some coffee from the great hall and return to the Slytherin dorms to maybe take a shower or something.
"Could we talk to your friends now? I'd rather get it over with as soon as possible," he resumed, calmly looking at the other. Had he actually messed his hair up even more? How was that possible, and how didn't it look as hideous as it should?
They should get back to the castle themselves, to search for the duo. He would've looked in the common room and see if he was there or maybe Malfoy and he should get to the library. Yet instead, his mind registered the snowflakes sticking to the other's robes and in the blond locks. Harry wished he could keep staring at the blonde, but as per usual, his mouth let his thoughts slipped.
Actually, Hermione was going with Ron now the two of them were dating. After the war and his break-up with Ginny, he did not feel like spending this year with the Weasley family. He felt responsible for Fred's death as well. If he had known about the sword, the snake, necklace and all these other Horcruxes carrying parts of Voldemort's soul he could have spared so many lives. Fred's life for one. People had died just because of him. No. He didn't feel like he was allowed to spend Christmas with the Weasleys as if nothing had happened.
Maybe Hermione could answer him on how to handle things with his feelings as well. She would only talk with him again when Ron and he made up. Though, Harry felt like he needed her help now as much as with the battle against Voldemort.
It was too quiet. Too peaceful. They should be fighting, not sitting together in peace. It wasn't like them at all… But it was nice, for a change. Kind of. It certainly was a lot less exhausting. "Doesn't Granger help you out with this stuff?" Draco asked. They were chatting anyway, so he just went with it.
A nice and quiet thing like this couldn't last forever, which became clear when Draco noticed a black haired girl walking up to them. Several alarm bells in his head started to ring, pushing him back into his normal behavior instantly. Pansy couldn't catch him hanging out with Potter, especially not this peacefully.
"I'm the one who actually should ask that," he softly chuckled. "After all, It was I who had draped myself all over you. But just to have answered your question, no that was no problem. Even though I'm still not as used to it."
He thought Draco had done it out of a whim, with no further meaning, and while this was partially true, that was not how he felt about it.
With a cough, Harry held his hand out towards the other. "You hand me the list, then we'll just add them to this one on the spot." Harry wasn't sure if he didn't know how to behave because of the group and the conversation or just because of the presence of the blonde in front of him. Surely, it could be because of both of those two reasons. He had tried to keep the other off his mind after he left the hospital wing, yet that was hard to do with the real thing standing right in front of him.
"Luxury, huh?" he mumbled, lifting his head to place his chin on the other instead so he could look the other in the eyes. Their proximity was unnerving, yet he still spoke. "It's quite sad to have to think like that."
Harry wore a confused expression as well until he spotted the girl coming in view. Naturally. He gave a curt nod. "Keyword; try."
"Not?" he teased. "That's just disappointing." Malfoy dropping his stuff was for Harry a sign that the other wasn't leaving him for quite a while, and for him, that was a good sign.
Harry wore a confused expression as well until he spotted the girl coming in view. Naturally. He gave a curt nod. "Keyword; try."
"Yes, of course…" Malfoy answered slowly, and a bit confused by the other's quick speaking. He seemed a bit agitated, had something happened at the Slytherin table? However, Draco didn't have the time to ask, because Potter was already walking off. Something had absolutely put him off, but what? He looked down at the papers and examined them to see if they were any good. This didn't take him long. He neatly stacked them back together again and rolled them up to take them with him.
"I think I'd like some goblin wine with that if you have it. A bottle should do," he added to his previous order when the elf returned.
"Say, Mal," he mumbled, a small smile playing on his lips as he smelled the familiar scent coming from the other that he had become quite used to. He paused for a bit, thinking his words through carefully. Just stating 'We should move here instead of the hospital wing' seemed somewhat rare, plus it pointed out his unusual frequent visits to Pomfrey's room.
With a huff he decided to grab his almost-done bundle of papers to combine it with the papers he had written in the library like half an hour ago.
It was weird that even though he'd felt so good moments ago, he had never felt as terrible as he did now.
"Trying might not even be the right way to say it. No failure allowed." He spoke short and quick. He wanted to wrap this up before Pansy would notice they hadn't been swearing at each other yet. "Come on, let's go," He muttered to the girl. Draco had never felt bad after annoying Potter. Not once. But this time, he felt strangely rude to leave just like this. However, he wasn't allowed to think about this too much. It was better to pretend as nothing had happened to their usual rivalry. Surely, everything would be back to normal tomorrow, he thought as he walked down the library.
That stupid Parkinson clinging on Malfoy wouldn't get off his mind and he liked to say he actually despised this feeling. If only the blond would forget all about his stupid confession, he would do so as well and surely things would turn out fine. He had gotten over Cho Chang, he had gotten over Ginny, so he could get over Slytherin boy Malfoy as well.
While he hummed in agreement, Harry noticed the ache he felt at the thought of the two of them hiding away from the other students.
Draco never reached the dorms. Instead, he went to the library. He told himself it was because of his Arithmancy homework, but even he knew better. He'd seen Potter walk off in that direction. It wasn't like he wanted to be around him, but he did want to make sure he would keep his mouth shut about what happened.
Draco decided to leave them be and simply went for some breakfast at the Slytherin table. The hall was already pretty empty, seeing as most students had probably left either last Friday or the previous evening already. The Slytherin table was also pretty empty, but Draco didn't mind that at all. All he wanted to do was get some quick breakfast anyway.
It was then that he finally realized why Potter affected him so much. Why he wouldn't leave his mind, and why he'd suddenly become so attractive. Draco felt the urge to laugh because of how ridiculous it was. How stupidly obnoxious he'd been. He was in love with Potter and there was nothing he could do about it.
"Can be anything, as long as it interests me," Draco replied. There wasn't a specific thing he wanted. Proposing a deal like this was ridiculous anyway, but he still wasn't backing away. Maybe he'd expected Potter to react a lot more offended, or angry.
Draco eventually decided to use this silence to say the thing he'd actually intended to tell them when he came here. "Me and Potter have decided to host an inter-house party, to celebrate Christmas but also to get rid of some of the tensenesses that have been between the houses ever since the war. I'm not forcing any of you to help or come, but I would like to remind you that this is the chance to show that we're not the bullies anymore."
"I would like just a glass of water and some bread, please," Harry spoke first and Draco looked back down at the elf.
Luna, who stood next to him, rose her eyebrows. Not only because of the first name basis, but for the silence that lingered with the other students too. Harry sensed her speak up already but didn't hold her back. Maybe it would do well if she would speak.
He had to agree on some point, but he didn't truly think it would be good to share this with Malfoy. Although a part of him screamed to just get it over with. He let his head fall back just too fast, banging a little hard against the wall which made him groan. "Okay karma, fine, I'll tell."
He'd never been a morning person, even though his parents had always wanted him to be at lunch at 8 in the morning. His brain simply hadn't woken up yet around such early times, which made him wonder how late it was right now.
The question was if Potter would be willing to help him with it. The mere thought of curling up against the other, pressing his face into the soft sweater, being warm and taken care of... Draco had truly steeped to his lowest level of decency. The only assurance he had was that he couldn't get any lower, which was his only reason for accepting it.
He snorted at that. "Just the two of us? That's not fair, you'll know I'll beat your ass." As friendly as they were being now, Harry wondered how things would've gone if they had been friends rather than rivals, enemies as one might say.
The blonde came to his bed and took hold of the vial on the little table next to his bed. Harry looked at him for a moment, unsure of what to do for a solid five seconds before he accepted the help of the boy to drink the weird substance. Draco had expected him to just take it from him and drink it, but this didn't happen. It seemed like he'd have to feed it to him. He reluctantly brought the conical flask closer to the other's lips, eyeing him to get some assurance that this was the right thing to do. All he got was a glassy stare, but that would have to do for now. He tilted the flask and hoped Harry was conscious enough to know how to swallow the liquid.
"Don't leave just yet, please," he said. Should he explain the situation? He wasn't totally against that idea. Somehow, even though he'd intruded his personal space, Potter didn't seem like a threat. He just seemed a bit out of place, but not as severely as anyone else would've done. Maybe the room had been right to let him in.
Draco let go of the wall and stood up straight, which resulted in him actually looking down at the other because he was taller. "I, am not weak, Potter," he spoke. It almost seemed like a bit of his usual posture toward Harry had returned. His stern face softened a bit as he let a small grin spread across it. "But I am great, you got that right."
"Thank you," he said while preparing his tea. The elf nodded and scurried off, already busy with the next task.
He did want to go. He didn't like hanging around this arrogant twat. The boy who lived. The young Malfoy was still convinced he didn't deserve the fame. He hadn't achieved it, he'd just rolled into it. To Draco, a Slytherin, this had always seemed very unfair. However, not liking Potter meant that he'd do anything to annoy him. If the boy asked him to leave, he simply wouldn't. "You'll fail potions, you know. With an essay like that…"
They made their way through the halls towards the great hall. It was then that Harry was reminded of that he would see Draco there. Ron and Hermione didn't know about his little homework sessions with Draco. He wondered how long it would take for the two of them to fight each other as usual. With how Draco had treated Ron and Hermione, he wasn't sure if they would ever like him even a bit.
At least, Draco could confirm his mind was absolutely more hazy than it should be. This was all Potter's fault. Dreamy, charming Potter with his stupid warmth and irritatingly amazing hugs.
Harry hummed. "Yeah, got me there. I especially got scared of some creature screaming when I found a unicorn in the forest. That just gave me the creeps," he grinned at that before he was reminded of the events there. That forest held quite some of his memories. That place somehow just drew bad luck to him. Well, most times that is. That reminded him, had he ever thanked Mrs. Malfoy? He didn't think he did. He frowned as he pondered if he ever was going to have the chance to tell her face to face. Were Mal's parents informed about their friendship?
"How come you were practicing now? Are you planning to play at the party?" Though that would be great, Malfoy had just told him this was rather personal. Then why had the other come here to play? If it was to get his mind of things, was it because of the party? If that were the case, he should have just told him.
"I should just get this done and over with or else I might forget it and die anyway - though I doubt you'll care about that part." He flipped through the pages, stopping on the page he had left off, before spinning in his seat towards the blonde. "Now, explain."
Maybe for the first time ever, Draco knew exactly how he felt. His eyes widened a bit at this resemblance, but he didn't say anything. Somehow it felt wrong to tell the hero that he, a former death eater, the kid of a man who'd murdered some of Potter's loved ones, felt the same way about the war. That he had the same nightmares and post-traumatic experiences. It simply wasn't his place to act as he'd gone through the same stuff.
"I might hope so, cuz else I would need a backup plan." It was nice to be complimented, even though it wasn't quite a direct one. Harry could sense the other believed in it. The weight of his lack of sleep from the other night started to get to him as another yawn tried to escape him. He laid his head down instead of resting his chin on the boy's frame.
I'm not J.K Rowling nor is my collaboration partner and thus we don't own Harry Potter nor do we get paid for any of this.
By the time he'd finally finished the last bit of his homework, Draco realized he'd missed dinner. He decided he could manage without it for one night since he was absolutely not in the mood to interact with anyone. Maybe it was best to call it a night and deal with everything the next morning. He'd finished his homework, so tomorrow he would have enough time to look for his ice skates and try the lake again. Though he was sure more students would've gotten that idea by now, it would probably not be as deserted as it had been today.
"The 'I woke up in a hospital wing, tired, with wrinkled clothes, and now my mood is ruined' part. The 'maybe I've never wanted this' part," Draco hissed back.
Harry halted and lingered to stay like the other had asked, pondering whether he shouldn't just leave the other alone. He felt like he should stay now the other had proposed to explain the situation, and honestly, he was quite curious about this room and about since when the other started playing, why he had never known about this.
Oh god, they hadn't fallen asleep like this, did they? Why didn't Malfoy push him off, or gently drag his head over to the real pillow at least? Had the other been too tired to care? Harry felt heat rise to his cheeks as he clumsily tried to get away from the other.
"I know this probably doesn't excuse my actions completely, but back then… During and before the war… " He hesitated for a moment, unsure if he should proceed or not. "You have to understand that I didn't know what to do anymore. I was Lucius Malfoy's son, raised to be just like him. A sophisticated pureblood with bigoted standards and terrible morals. I acted terribly during my first years at Hogwarts because that was how I'd been raised, but also what others expected me to be like. And when he came back… When all the death eaters were summoned… My father had never left the dark lord's side. I didn't have a choice. I was involved with the death eaters just as much as he was, it didn't matter if I wanted it or not because I was Lucius' son and had no other choice but to follow in his footsteps. When I had to choose between Hogwarts or Voldemort, during the battle of Hogwarts, I had to choose for Voldemort. I couldn't leave my parent's side, they were the only close family I had, I couldn't leave them. I was also convinced that Voldemort would win, I couldn't risk it."
"I'm not sure if Slytherins and Gryffindors have the same romantic tastes, I dare say they absolutely don't, but if it were me I'd say the courtyard near the lake, or somewhere near the lake and the forest…"
He shifted his gaze to the other, keeping it there because well, it wasn't a bad view. He would have done anything for the other, at least he could admit that now, but this was such a delicate thing. Draco did not trust himself enough to do it.
Malfoy hummed. "I'll try." There was no way people were gonna listen to him, but if Potter dared him to do it, there was no way he was backing off.
He'd lost them when it turned out that his whole life consisted out of wrong choices when all he'd done turned out to be worthless. And now all that was left was the sobbing mess that was clutching onto Potter as if he were the last thing on earth that could keep him from drowning in his own messed up mind. No wonder his pride had left him.
Harry finds Draco in the Room of Requirement playing a violin. They end up talking about things like what Christmas at the Weasleys was like and such
Rubbing his eyes he looked at his two friends. "Yeah, I'm sorry. Didn't know it was this bad…" Hermione let out a long sigh. She looked at him for a few seconds before hummed and after a short pause, patted her lap twice before she stood up. "We're going back to class. Make sure to rest up, okay?"
"May I kiss you?" Harry mumbled, lips already inching closer to fill the last bit of space between the two of them.
A soft curse left his mouth between the kisses, a small sign of how much everything still overwhelmed him.
"But it's Christmas, most students are gone anyway... If we just sneak into the kitchens, we might make it without being seen."
Harry never wanted to be their hero, he just wanted to have friends and find love like anyone else did.
"Yes, you have, Malfoy. Ever since you met him in your first year. Sorry, but I dare say you've been quite obsessed with the boy for many years now. I know it used to be out of envy and hate, but now, after the war… I don't think you hate him anymore Draco. It's something else now. I guessed it had something to do with regret, and I was right." She stopped for a moment to glance down at him. Her expression was a bit puzzled. When she continued, her voice was softer and more hesitant than before. "But there's more to it, and I'm not sure what it is. I just care about you, and if this is troubling you-"
Taking a sip from his water he saw a mop of red hair enter his view and his priorities slipped. Placing the plate and glass to the side he jumped up to sprint towards his friend, leaving the blond without a word. "Ron! Ron, stop please."
But Potter. He'd gone through a lot more than Draco had. Was that the reason for his nightmares? Draco looked up at the other but didn't voice the thought yet.
He decided it had been enough, and began to move back to the shore again. However, another loud cracking sound made him freeze in his tracks. Yes so maybe Potter was right.
"In that case what, Potter?" The blond raised an eyebrow, daring the other to continue explaining himself. "Got deep dark secrets you're about to reveal?"
"I see you've already made progress on sharing the idea?" She nodded, walking further with the papers pressed against her so he couldn't read.
Harry had been glad Malfoy felt comfortable enough to share this information with him. As he had lived the most part of his life in a closet he had never had many expectations pressed on him besides being quiet. It had surprised him when the Dursleys had given him his own room, yet besides that, things were the same.
With thoughts of winter and the sounds of the lake he was currently under in the background, he closed his eyes and finally got some rest. The last few days had been quite hectic.
His skin was easily stainable, sometimes too easily. He couldn't help but mumble the other's name, softly and impulsively.
Draco took a deep breath and smiled faintly. "This might sound ridiculous, believe me, I'm not even sure if I should even bring this up, but I can't help myself." He paused and looked the other straight in the eyes. "I can't help but wonder… The person you fancy… That doesn't happen to be me, right?"
A sudden sentimental feeling started washing over him. Like waves, unexpected and uncontrollable. It made him feel raw and vulnerable. Maybe it was because of the pressure he'd felt lately, which had finally lifted, or the sudden excess of care he was receiving. He felt unworthy of receiving something so precious, something so valuable.
"I don't intend to be likable towards you, I thought you'd know that by now." Again, he ignored Potter's remark, but his posture had become a bit tense. Affronted, Harry stopped writing altogether and put his things down. "You know, Malfoy. There's a brief moment when you first wake up, where you have no memories. A blissful blank slate, a happy emptiness," Harry almost enunciated. "Whenever I see your face, I wish I could just stay in that moment." With that, he picked the feather back up and continued taking down his notes.
Draco shook his head. "No, no it's nothing you've done. You've been nothing but kind to me for a while now." He looked up at Harry, seemingly hesitating on something.
Harry's eyes shifted to the arm he had seen Malfoy's deathmark on and gulped. "He speaks to me in my dreams," he murmured. "Says he's coming back and all… Even after the war, his presence is still there… Water… I just can't help but see blood, ya know?" His voice was shaking and he cursed himself for it.
That was it. With an angry glare, he saw the blonde stride over to the Slytherin table. His insides felt like they were burning and being ripped apart at the same time. He was fuming yet he felt this weird urge, the need to cry as well. Harry made his way to the Gryffindor table, completely ignoring any greetings from the people seated there, and grabbed an empty plate beside a random student before taking a few things he thought he would be able to get down his throat. Then he left again. He didn't want to see anyone now his feelings were all over the place, not when he had no control over his own reactions. He just had to get away from all these people.
The blond let out a small chuckle, mostly out of nervosity and the other emotions that were raging through him. "I wouldn't be hugging you if you weren't Potter, I like quality," he said hoarsely.
Draco scoffed. "Of course. I told you I liked ice skating, right?" He leaned against one of the hospital beds, dropping his stuff on it because he'd gotten tired of holding it. "I don't always need hero Potter to save my day." Laughing he sat up straight, placing the glass away for now.
"Have you checked the room of requirement for the party's room already?" the Ravenclaw asked, a housemate leaning on her shoulder as he agreed.
Slowly he lost himself to the overpowering lack of sleep. He knew he would regret falling asleep, the nightmares would come back. But it was just too warm and comfortable.
A yawn escaped the Gryffindor and his eyes felt heavy. "I don't need an answer," he murmured. "I never planned to tell nor for you to return it. Just forget I even said anything." He couldn't go and wipe the other's memories. His one arm was tingling from when it had been wiggled between the bed and Malfoy's frame so he wouldn't have been able to even hold onto his wand normally.
Harry groaned as the other moved to the middle, weaker-looking part of the lake. He even taunted him and as much as he wanted to prove the other wrong, something told him not to go there. Yet he couldn't back down now, could he? Trying to hum inside his head to keep himself calm, his eyes darted to the ice as he stepped closer. That damn ice moved as a blanket. How the Slytherin didn't seem to have any problems with that was a miracle, yet Harry tried to look unfazed.
"I doubt Ron and Hermione wouldn't go and tell me upright that it's all inside my head and the guy's gone, they have been doing that a lot. Didn't help. But if it comes to reminding me to drink I guess they do the job…" Harry murmured at that statement in response.
"I'm sure you two have talked it through just now, but I expect you want to hear it from me too," he shifted his gaze to the redhead. "Potter and I have indeed put aside our differences, and I was hoping you'd be willing to give me a chance too. Now, I'm not asking you to become a friend, I can see that would be quite a thing to ask in my current position. However, I would like to be able to hang out with Harry without you and Granger trying to glare me to death. I understand it's difficult to forget what I've done, and who I've been, but I'm not asking you to do that. All I want is to bury the hatchet, and for that to happen, I suppose I should apologize for what I've done. I owe you, Granger, Potter, and many others a great apology, so I'll start it right here. I'm sorry for what I've done during the war, and I apologize for being such a childish prick during the years before that. Please, forgive me for all the ugly names I've called you, that was an awful thing for me to do."
As Malfoy had mentioned that he had to do it for 'his friends', Harry shortly wondered whether the blond had forgotten about their talk last time, that they would be friends as well. However, as he continued Harry's eyes widened. He had never heard Malfoy talk like that. Not to mention that he felt as if he had been waiting for the other to say that. Yet that was ridiculous.
"Trying might not even be the right way to say it. No failure allowed." He spoke short and quick. He wanted to wrap this up before Pansy would notice they hadn't been swearing at each other yet. "Come on, let's go," He muttered to the girl. Draco had never felt bad after annoying Potter. Not once. But this time, he felt strangely rude to leave just like this. However, he wasn't allowed to think about this too much. It was better to pretend like nothing had happened to their usual rivalry. Surely, everything would be back to normal tomorrow, he thought as he walked down the library.
Kissing Draco fucking Malfoy, that was a thought Harry had pressed back far away in a corner - but here he was.
Malfoy gave him a puzzled look. "Did I?" He wasn't even sure, maybe he had. But he'd given him that sort of laugh before right? Yes, but in a mocking way, that's different. Right then…
"How's Christmas at the Weasley's though?" Draco suddenly asked. He'd been rather curious about it, and he needed a distraction anyway.
"Well, I'm not that fond of having a near panic attack, thank you very much. And why would you even want to- You know what, never mind. Let's just get off the ice."
Conscious of his bare front, he lightly pulled his sweater back, hand going through his hair as if to fix it.
"Will we return here, after getting the food?" He asked, looking back at the room as they walked towards the door.
Christmas at Ron's house, huh? That had not been on his list of possible questions the other could have asked him at this moment, though he reckoned the other was just curious about it.
He felt the sudden urge to get even closer, but seeing as this wasn't possible, he went for an alternative.
This was why Malfoy usually took his time to think before he spoke. He already began to regret what he'd said because the longer he thought about it, the more stupid it sounded, even to him. But then why had he said it? Maybe because he hated being brushed off. Or maybe because Potter had hurt his pride. He would never admit that, but it was probably true.
He realized he'd actually spent a long time in the hospital wing. The sun was already starting to set, and he could hear the hall next to the hospital wing getting busier by the increase of talking students. He noticed he hadn't eaten for a while too, his last meal being the toast he'd quickly stuffed into his mouth during lunch. How was it possible that he had spent a whole afternoon, talking with Potter out of all people?
Harry didn't know who to thank first. God? Dumbledore? His parents? Maybe Lucius? He was just glad that the other took up on his offer, it would have been quite some trouble to find something else the blonde would have deemed 'worthy' for this exchange.
He felt terrible for upsetting the other like this. His own fear and confusion were affecting Harry and that was not what he wanted.
And thus he sat up and then bowed down to grab some stuff from his bag. "I have a better idea," he began, "what if we make the homework together? Right here. Shouldn't take too long, and I think it could be quite efficient if we do it right."
He then took a step closer to the other and lowered his voice, pressing his lips softly against the skin right between his jaw and ear.
The other Slytherin let out a disapproving laugh. "Why would you do that? I know you, Malfoy. You wouldn't do that unless there's something in it for you."
Harry stopped staring the other way to find the other's eyes again. "Hmm, well you know about Cho Chang and Ginny. Aside from the two of them, I haven't dated anyone, though…" He frowned lightly. He was bringing the topic up again. "I do have my eye on someone, as I might have mentioned. For my future plans, well, honestly I'm not all that sure. But I guess I want to try and be an Auror?"
He had to confess he wanted the other to lay with him like this without rest. But with the other cutting himself off, he didn't know what the other wanted from him. It messed him up, made him need a few seconds to breathe. He was kinda afraid to be let down, so he needed to shake it off.
The other's hands in his hair were driving him crazy, he never would have thought that such a thing could please him.
"Right, Christmas." The Slytherin got up and hopped onto the other's bed, pretending to not be phased by that at all. "I haven't really talked to my friends about it yet, actually… You see…" Draco hesitated for a moment, biting his lip and wondering how he could explain that he hadn't even told his friends that they were friends. "... They don't even know we hang out like this. I'm just… I don't even know for sure why I haven't told them."
"All I'm saying," Draco continued, "is that I've come to terms with the war and with myself. I've been a bully, a prick, and at least I can admit that now. If you're not able to do that, if you're unable to move on from the past, I can assure you, you won't have a very pretty future lying ahead of you. The dark lord's gone, we've lost. It's time to admit that we were wrong."
As expected both Ron and Hermione weren't present in the Gryffindor's common room, yet that was not why he left soon after. It was because he remembered his stuff was still in the hospital wing. The halls were still crowded and it took him longer as he expected to get to the room. Madame Pomfrey was still absent, which he would consider strange if there had been any other students at the moment, either sleeping over or in need of patches or whatever. The nurse might have a busy day tomorrow, he pondered as he returned to the lion cave. Harry was quite sure that Malfoy wouldn't be the only one that would want to try to skate on the lake.
Harry could sense her worry yet he didn't feel like discussing this at the moment. "Yes," he replied. "No need to worry about it." He saw she wanted to say something but decided to keep it for herself as she sat back.
"I mean… this was discussed during class, but you're usually busy with anything but the class, so, this doesn't surprise me." He stopped for a bit. "Snape isn't exactly the kindest either, he doesn't reward students in the right way. It should be based on knowledge, not houses." It sounded like a thing a Slytherin would never say, but it still fits with one of the main Slytherin traits: wanting to achieve things. Some preferred to do that by cheating, but most purebloods actually played fair game.
Rather now, he felt as if he had gone back to the Dursleys. Cold, holding back and acting as if he was alright.
The dinner tables in the great hall never served it, most of the students were still minors after all, but Draco had grown up drinking only the finest wines during his family dinners. It was like any other drink to him, really.
Draco was happy with the other's explanation but decided to add some more to it. "I thought the party could be a way to strengthen the bonds between the houses, to get rid of the old feuds and have some fun before we all leave Hogwarts." He paused for a moment, looking at the group of people that was now silently listening to him. They wouldn't like what he had to say next. No one liked to talk about that, he'd noticed.
"Well, I was drenched so it was no surprise for me, yet Pomfrey got all mad," he mumbled. "But well, yes. Aside from the cold, there is nothing wrong with me." When he yawned he huffed. Okay so he was wrong about that, his body had caught up to the lack of sleep now his energy from the snowball fight was gone.
"Well, good luck down there." He turned around on his heel, robe flying after him, as he continued on his track.
Taking note there was enough snow to his left to grab, he decided to just throw the ball in hope of luck standing on his side. The other was still quite the distance away, but he didn't dare come closer without any snow to arm himself with.
"I know," Draco muttered, surprised by the other's sudden actions. Yes, he had asked for this, he couldn't complain now. Not that he wanted to, it felt weirdly nice to feel the other's warmth again. He shifted a bit so that he wasn't sitting anymore, but wasn't sure what to do from there. Should he just… curl up? Or hug back? Or stay like this? Why was this so difficult for someone who nearly always knew what to do and how to deal with things? It wasn't like he had some kind of stupid, girlish crush… Oh but wait… No, absolutely not. He instantly threw that thought away, as if he were stung by it. What in the world was he thinking about?
However, he wondered if it was wise to go out and play one-on-one after his lack of sleep. He also asked himself what they would do if Madame Pomfrey wouldn't let him go. Would he have to stay here another night? And what about Malfoy, what if he met Ron and Hermione in the hallways? After Ron's sudden outburst he wouldn't be surprised if they would act out even more on the rivalry act.
As usual, the Boy Who Lived felt that tension of being frustrated and powerless, the embarrassment not adding any good vibes. He just wanted to fall into a hole or sit in a corner so no one would bother him. Which had been Draco's goal, even Harry knew that. He tried to regain his senses and push his feelings away. He stood up with a deep sigh. "Can someone get a broom? I dropped some trash."
"And I mean… At least my father's not dead," the blond boy hissed, desperate to cover this sign of weakness up. The pang of guilt Harry had felt almost immediately disappeared. How did he dare to talk like that, and to bring his dad up? He knew Draco was taunting him and thus just continued to walk away.
Hermione gasped as she lightly hit the red-haired boy. "Ron! Harry needs to rest, you can't just make him run all the way over here." Harry stifled his laugh at the horrified look on his friend's face asking, no begging, him to help.
Upon arriving at the library Harry found himself walking towards the shelf with potion books instead of searching for the other Gryffindor, he stared at the books with a frown. Why was he standing here? Harry was about to leave and continue through the library to find the other when it suddenly all fell in place. The assignment.
It was too quiet. Too peaceful. They should be fighting, not sitting together in peace. It wasn't like them at all… But it was nice, for a change. Kind of. It certainly was a lot less exhausting. "Doesn't Granger help you out with this stuff?" Draco asked. They were chatting anyway, so he just went with it.
"I want you to forget about it. The whole conversation." He deliberately didn't answer Harry's question, because he couldn't. Just a moment he'd probably regret for the rest of his life. However, instead of being ashamed of it, it made him bitter. Angry, almost.
"We," he started unsurely. "Have come past our differences." Honestly, he thought that sounded more like a question, and seeing Hermione arched her eyebrow up she thought so as well. Her intense stare was now, however, directed at Malfoy. "Is. That. So?" She dragged her words out. Harry wasn't sure if she commanded Malfoy to clarify that or was just letting it progress, yet it sure did sound as if she was telling the blonde to reply as well.
He made sure that he gathered all his belonging and yawned as he walked off. It had been quite problematic to get back as he attention was all over the place. The stairs had moved halfway and he started talking to the small painting in front of him. So much for getting more rest.
There had to be something to get his mind off of things, there had to be something he could do. Malfoy was pacing the common room, thinking of a way to distract himself. Reading wasn't good enough, and going outside with his broom would be no good in this cold either. He didn't want to spend time with his friends as well, he honestly preferred to not talk to anyone for a while. Then what was there left to do?
One of them noticed him and Harry, and walked up to them, asking them in a squeaky voice what they would like to have.
It went silent. The longer Draco didn't answer, the more insecure Harry began to look. He looked like he was about to take his words back, but before he could do this, Draco had decided he could at least show some comprehension.
"I'm sorry, it's just…" Draco stopped pacing and looked at the other with a difficult expression. "I know it's your own fault, I guess I'm just angry because you make me worry. And I'm irritated because you keep ending up in this damn room, I don't like seeing you hurt Potter." He really shouldn't have acted all his frustration out on him, it wasn't fair, but it had still happened. What was wrong with him?
"No need to get defensive now," Harry grinned, cocking his head to the side. "That incident with the hippogriff though, may I dare say, was your own fault. If you had only listened, something you actually did on the lake, it might have been prevented. But no, the great Draco Malfoy had it all handled."
Harry wasn't really sure if he was supposed to reply to this, yet the silence that lingered made him quickly think of something. Malfoy probably wanted to know what he thought of this then, right? Or maybe he just needed to tell him what this was. It made no sense to him, he had intruded, why would he even receive an explanation. It didn't make it any less awkward or anything for that matter.
It scared him to hear those words. Harry knew he should brush it off, or maybe just laugh it off with a 'yes that would be ridiculous indeed', but instead he felt himself stiffen as he stared back. He could do it, say it wasn't the truth that is, but he would be lying. People had found out about his habits, so who said the blonde wouldn't see through it? Then again, he could tell him. He could. Yet there was no way.
He decided to grab some water when he took notice of his dry throat. It was not as if Malfoy would wake up now or that the other needed to see him when he woke up or whatever anyway.
"A-ah," Harry managed to get out. Illegal stuff, huh? That did sound like something they would do. He didn't wish for that to be brought, he knew himself to be quite dense when it came to things. Someone might slip him some of that stuff without him noticing. Though he doubted they would even go ahead and do that, he still would prefer that that kind of stuff was out of his reach.
Potter hadn't asked him to follow, but Draco decided to do it anyway. What else was there to do in an empty hallway? As they returned their stuff to the elves, he wondered what they should do next. He'd been hanging out with Potter for over 24 hours now, he was sure of that.
Thinking of it, Malfoy actually craved some time for himself. "You know, I think I'll head back to the Slytherin dormitories then. I probably have homework too." He shrugged. "I guess I'll see you later then…" He looked at the other as they left the kitchens and returned to the hallway.
"The night you didn't have a nightmare… I don't want to brag but I was there too. And to be honest, I had quite some peaceful sleep too. So I don't want to propose any weird ideas, but the reason that you didn't have a nightmare could also be that you didn't sleep alone."
Instead of huffing and turning around, Harry let himself lean against a tree and let out a long groan as he looked at the sky from which snow was still falling.
