“It’s not. Not really.” Harion meets his gaze for several long torturous seconds. “Have you ever wondered if you could have a second chance, a way to have true, living, breathing relatives? Would you? Would you tell them and share the details of your connection? Or would you secret it away and hope that they never found out for fear of being rejected by the only blood connection you had left on this earth?”
“I know you do Severus.” Her voice is even but sure. There was a certainty in her tone that left little room for arguments. She didn’t need to know exact details about the horrors that were his younger years before he was formally adopted back into the House of Prince. She could see it clearly written in the lines of his body. “Neither of you deem yourself worthy of happiness much less love. Familial love is something almost foreign to you. I’m sure you’ve seen glimmers of it in your many years alive Severus and I have tried to show it to Harion but even then you both doubt the validity of that love. And yet you both fear being alone more than anything. You fear that you will never truly be able to find people to love you and be loved by you and that you will end up alone.”
The plump woman, who Harry quickly places as the likely mother of one horrid red-head his age, looks taken aback by Bellatrix’s greeting. Harry knew his mother got a sort of sick glee out of surprising people with her demeanor. “Ah, my Ginerva and I were just out and about.” Bellatrix offers the larger woman a short smile and motions toward her son.
Bella may have revealed too much but if it would calm the territorial werewolf that counted her son as a member of his pack then she would lay all of her cards on the table. She had nothing to hide. She had tried, with all her sanity, to raise the little boy in a home filled with love and happiness. How well she had accomplished that was up for debate but there was no one who could say she did not adore the little boy.
“Yes. Anything discussed with your account manager will remain confidential.”
“My Lillian lives? I was under the impression her soul had departed this Earth. She had promised me a return to my soul and never showed.” Harion tilts his head at the new piece of information. So, before his fall Voldemort had known of his daughter but something occurred and they both found themselves on the receiving end of a killing curse. “If not her then who might it be that raised you? Perhaps a stepmother, then? Did James Potter remarry?”
“Will my answer remain completely confidential?”
“I have. Yes.”
The mother and son pair wat patiently for around fifteen or so minutes before another goblin whom Harry was more acquainted with steps out from around the teller desks. “Good afternoon Miss Black and Young Mister Black. Please follow me and we will begin conducting business.” Harry follows his mother and the goblin into the private meeting room.
At Narcissa incredulous tone Remus raises an eyebrow and shrugs his shoulders. “Of course, I do. I’m a werewolf and have been since I was five. Obliviating doesn’t work on me. Even blood ritual obliviations. As my mate, they also did not work on Sirius. Conveniently, the headmaster forgot that such mind matters are shielded for shifters and their mates. The bond is too strong to allow such manipulations to take place. Though the blood ritual blurred some of Sirius’s memories for a time they did not remain unknown to him. As for James and Lily…the moment, they stepped foot into Potter manor and Gaunt manor respectively they were cleansed of their issues.” Remus glances at Bellatrix and tilts his head in thought. “How you were never saved from such house familial magic we are all still unsure.”
Harry calms down completely and feels his eyes shift slowly back to normal and his magic calms down. He hated Albus Dumbledore. He hated that man more than he thought he ever could hate someone but he was only an eleven-year-old boy. He may be Lord Harion Black of the Houses of Potter and Black but he was not powerful enough to take on a man like Albus Dumbledore just yet.
Lucius’ tone erred toward questioning their sanity. Narcissa’s narrowing gaze states that she does not appreciate the tone and Lucius almost rolls his eyes at his wife. She was far too stubborn for her own good, but he adored her regardless. He still remembers how she had marched up to him when he was in fourth year and demanded he took her to Hogsmeade on their next free weekend. He had been so startled that he agreed without really giving it much thought. No one had ever dared to speak to him in such a manner. His father had not been particularly happy with his choices that summer, but he had already been under the youngest Black daughter’s spell.
“They brought you to the Malfoy estate following their discovery of you. And one of the Black sisters took you as their charge. You’d be a Malfoy if it were Narcissa. Andromeda was estranged by then…so Bellatrix.” Harry nods and watches as the mirage of the man takes one great step forward and wraps his arms around Harry bringing him into a hug. “I find myself angry on your behalf little one. Those retched muggles will pay dearly if they still breathe.”
Draco’s head of shimmering blonde locks finds itself on his lap after a few moments of getting comfortable and with a sense of quiet ease his fingers move through the silken tresses. “Father says that you can see the squid from the windows in the dungeons. Mother says she’ll send along extra blankets if it becomes too cold.” The mass on the platform is thinning out as more students board the train and their parents apparate away. Part of him wonders if his birth parents felt the same way as him when they first rode on the massive train. Surely they would have, his mother said they would have.
The great serpent bobs her head as if to nod at him.
“Mother says both of my parents were in Gryffindor.” The blue eyed boy closes his eyes in content as fingers run through his hair once more. Their cabin was rather quiet as most students had not reach the majority of the compartments in the back and the older years knew most pureblood children knew to take those seats first. At least that was what his mother had told him. “Even my god father was, the first Black to be a Gryffindor apparently.”
Silence settles in the parlor for a long few minutes. The grandfather clock ticks away steadily and Lucius passes the parchment with Harion’s heritage test results to his wife. “So long story short, our cousin is smarter than he looks, and James really didn’t betray you.” Bellatrix rolls her eyes and leans her head back in exhaustion.
He could read fairly clearly between the lines of his mother’s letter through years of practice reading her words. They balanced one another. Despite being mother and child for all intents and purposes they understood the harsh reality of mental trauma. His mother had been uncharacteristically aware of every thought and feeling that went through his mind whenever he’d get in his mood and as he grew to understand his trauma he understood hers as well.
“Tell me, Severus,” Bellatrix starts after refilling her own cup of tea. “Are you aware that The Dark Lord is currently possessing the Defense Professor?” Severus very nearly spits his tea out had it not been for the intensive Pureblood training his grandfather had put him through in his youth. He had not expected her to be so blunt about what was going on at Hogwarts.
“Severus!” Bellatrix tucks a stray strand of raven hair behind her ear where her wand is tucked haphazardly. In the last six years since she took Harry in and began raising him, Severus had seen her blossom into the woman she had once been when he first met her before the war really took hold. She was far more of a woman than the crazed shell she had been when her mind had shattered. What a beauty life could be when you saw someone so near to death. She looked for all the world like a true heiress of the House of Black. “Whatever brings you here? Is it Harion? Is he alright?”
Harry watches as the man closes his eyes and falls silent. With a gasp, Harry sits up straight in his chair startling the man. “It’s here. Your soul or what’s left of it! It’s here at the school!” Harry stands and starts pacing. Marvolo watches him with confused amber eyes. “I feel so stupid! Mother visited my defense professor secretly a few nights ago. I wasn’t sure why, but the man always gave me the oddest feeling like he was a sickening sort of person with half of my blood if that makes sense. I think what’s left of your soul had taken up residence in my defense professor.”
Narcissa steadies her gaze on Sirius and the man flashes a wolfish grin. “I want a trial. I never received a trial and by law, I should have. One of you two likely has the ability to demand it seeing as you’re the last remaining Blacks.” Narcissa frowns softly because that was a fairly large request and Sirius knew that.
“I’m not sure.” Marvolo runs a hand across Harion’s head tucking a stray black curl behind his ear. “If what my Lillian said was true…then I split my soul many times and the one housed here may not be powerful enough to fully bring my back. If you were to find several of them, it may be possible. If I made several they would be things I deemed worthy no matter how insane. So, founders’ artifacts and Gaunt family heirlooms.”
“Nothing of the sort I assure you.” Harry closes his book because Draco had been itching to lay in his favorite spot for the last five minutes. Without fail Draco instantly falls onto Harry’s lap and nudged Harry’s fingers into his hair with a relaxes sigh. “I’ve just grown to have a healthy sense of preservation. I just want to see how things play out. Patience.”
“If you really must know,” Narcissa sniffs indignantly. “Bellatrix and I would like to speak with him concerning anything he may know about the night that the Potters died or even goings on before that moment.”
“Hello mother, I hope you were not waiting long for me.”
“Good morning lovebirds.”
~~XxX~~
Her tone dares someone to question her and when they all glance at Draco he merely shrugs and turns his nose to the side trying to appear superior.
“He was like this when we found him Narcissa.”
“No, we have not forgotten that husband dear.” Narcissa snaps softly crossing her arms. She seems upset that Lucius had brought that topic up, but Bellatrix had not even thought about the possibility that Sirius would refuse to see him. It had been ten years since his imprisonment, so, he may very well be insane by now. “We will be going under the pretense of having him sign documents for Bellatrix to renounce the Lestrange family name and return to her maiden name. He is still technically the head of house black since Uncle Orion passed on.”
“When did he die?”
Bellatrix sighs softly and leans back in her seat looking slightly defeated. She had been trying for the last hour to wrap her head around everything they had discovered at Gringotts this morning. Harion and Draco were currently passed out in Draco’s chambers upstairs after a rather tiring day of visiting the graves of their deceased relatives. With a small sip of tea to refresh her throat, Bellatrix begins from the first moments with the Goblin.
“Are you really so worried about the girl, Theo?” Pansy murmurs to him.
The group is startled as the dirty blonde haired woman standing before them hurries across the room and plucks the little thing from their leader’s arms. Of course the dark haired Nott didn’t respond to the rather rude treatment he received because his own thoughts would have been to do nearly the same thing if the situation was reversed.
Harry nearly snorts when mounds of candy and pumpkins spring forth on the feast tables to celebrate the muggle holiday of Halloween. Harry and Draco vanish the candy and pumpkins alongside the entirety of the Slytherin table. In their place several sixth and seventh years conjured decorations for Samhain. While pumpkins remain, they are no longer carved with frivolous faces and are instead joined by corn stalks, apples, acorns, and gourds. Carefully so as not to burn themselves each of the Princes of Slytherin places a little candle into one of seven small cauldrons that line the length of the tables.
“They haven’t been physical, as far as I know, mostly just taking her things and hiding them. They also make fun of her teeth a lot. The front two are a bit bigger, you see, and it upsets her that they point it out.” Harry frowns sharply at that because certainly none of them were truly great looking. They were children for Merlin’s sake. Some genetics appeared better for children like the Black genetics running through him and the Malfoy genetics running through Draco but surely children wouldn’t make fun of her for things she could not control. “She said that they did cut open the bottom of one of her bags just yesterday after one of her classes.”
Harry nearly spits his pumpkin juice out of his mouth in laughter at the grumble Draco gives about the bloody peacocks. The Malfoys were well known for own a multitude of prized peacocks. Those very same peacocks wreaked havoc chasing around the young heir whenever he so much as stepped near their vicinity. “Bloody hell those things still chase you? Mother would have them put down.” Pansy sniffs daintily toward Draco who merely glowers in her direction.
A smooth oval shaped nail runs around a gaunt cheek and the babe looks up in surprise and fear but not a sound escaped his lips at the touch. The dirt and curls did little to hide the nasty looking scar that ran along his forehead marking him for who he truly was. Somehow it didn’t mean as much after glancing at the poor shape the boy was in.
The more Harion looked the more the man seemed to waver before flickering translucent. He was not a ghost. His magic was much too powerful to be that of a ghost but also not entirely human either. This vision of a man was something in between the two. “You’re not living, are you?” The man tilts his head as if sizing Harion up for a long moment before dropping his hand from Harion’s cheek. The cool brush of his fingers remains, and the enticing feel of dark chocolatey magic lingers on his skin.
The curse fires instinctively. It's an automatic response, a muscle memory born from months with Death Eaters for company. At first he doesn't even see the Gryffindor. His spell is aimed at the snarling fangs of Fenrir. At the sadistic Carrows. At Aunt Bella. It takes two more spells for him to remember he's at Hogwarts not the manor, and it's Potter that his duelling. His eyes sting as much as the mark on his arm.
There's a shift of wind and a soft pop, much softer than what accompanies Apparation and Draco relaxes somewhat, realising Potter and his posse have gone.
Lupin frowns at the letters, looking back at the others before slowly lowering himself to his knees. His wand is still in his hand, but it's tip is lowered. The open body language gives Draco much more relief than it should.
"That is your name,"
Draco wonders if it's trying to devour him too.
the other, Lupin looks up, bewildered. Draco is already gone. He falls to Mad Eye Moody's side, with a scowl. One of the most famous Wizards in history and he's taken down in a simply fray? Draco is disappointed. He

to kill a teacher before, this time he saw no way he wouldn't succeed. "I'd ask why you're talking in riddles, but it's no surprise that only nonsense leaves your lips. I doubt you have the capability for much else." His wand spins idly in his hand, typical Malfoy disinterest painted on his face. Firenze can't know. There's nothing for Firenze
"It's no surprise you're so bitter and immature." Firenze replies, petting the head of the Thestral fondly. "Children don't have the capability for much else."
"You're not supposed to be in here." A voice says behind him and Draco flinches.
" Draco yells. Potter's Stupefy dies, half formed on his lips as he watches the man fall and he turns quickly, looking for the root of the spell. Draco darts away, still disillusioned and dodging green light. The move forces him further into the fray. He works his way towards Lupin, the ex-Professor firing spells so quickly that his wand is nought but a blur to Draco's eyes. A particularly sharp cutting curse catches one of the Death Eater's the man had been duelling and once he
"Right now, it's going back to the castle and going to bed, lest I waste anymore time on you."
"You and Dumbledick-" The class cries out, both offence and encouragement. He talks over the noise. "You and Dumbledick don't give a Troll's arse about any of us unless we're wearing red."
"I see," Dumbledore says lightly. Draco examines them. Most wands are clutched so tightly in their owner's hands that their grips are white knuckled. Moody's false eye is swivelled, locked dangerously on the place where they're hidden. "Perhaps our guest would be willing to reveal themself?"
There's nothing.
"Hey, Moony." He rasps, trying to raise his head before letting it thunk back on the floor. "Why the long face? Did someone eat your kibble?" The others try to crowd in suddenly and Draco jerks away as if burned only for a hand to latch onto his arm. His sleeve is slick with blood but Sirius doesn't seem to care and his head turns up, looking for Draco yet still unable to see him. The blonde realises then that Sirius has been awake for far longer than he thought. "Wh-" Sirius' fingers edge too close to Draco's gaping cut and he cries out in pain, shoving him away with enough force that he's pushed into Lupin's side. It seems to have been the cue the others were waiting for and Draco deflects Tonks' spell before narrowly ducking Moody's.
It doesn't. Instead Draco is spat into his body, slamming into it with such awareness that his conscious breaks through the stunning spell that his past self had fell victim to. The Bat Bogey Hex has subsided and Draco sits up slowly, stomach rolling and green around the gills. He takes in the room around him with trepidation. Scattered around the room are his fellow Slytherins, all younger than he remembers. Their faces are flushed with life, clear of the haggard expressions that had followed them around. Relief blooms in his chest. It's smothered by fear.
, he wants to scream but as he opens his mouth he breathes a ragged and pitiful sound.
"There are consequences to your actions Mr Malfoy."
Draco's summon is silent but it's strong and the Prophecy comes towards him with speed that rivals a Snitch. Heads jerk towards it as it moves, but no-one has time to follow it's path completely as two doors open high above them. Five figures sprint into the room and Draco shrinks the prophecy to the size of a marble, tucking it into his breast pocket. There's a quietly whispered spell to prevent anyone Accioing it from him and he watches as Nymphadora Tonks sends a stunning spell towards his Father. It misses but Draco compensates by sending his own. He's torn between hurt and relief as it hits it's mark. The spells rain down, a cacophony of magic as the Order members work their way to the sunken floor. The spells stream by in bursts of light and Draco sticks close to the edge of the room, fingers tight around his wand. A flash of red light works it's way towards Potter, too preoccupied crawling to Longbottom to notice and Draco meets it with his own spell, sending it wildly off course. It veers left and hits a Death Eater, sending him crashing into the wall with such a force that the crack of his head meeting stone is loud in the room. As Dolohov goes down, Kingsley Shacklebolt looks around with furrowing brows before settling into a duelling stance and facing his next opponent. Draco is so focused firing spells and erecting hastily cast
There's no light. No gravity. Draco is only vaguely aware of himself, and it's mostly due to the
"-alfoy? Malfoy?"
He thinks desperately.
He's not entirely focusing as he transfigures his clothes back into school robes and as he slumps on the ground, closing his eyes and letting a cleaning charm wash over him, the sleeping Slytherins stir. Draco wishes they would have slept longer to give him one moment of peace. He ignores their groans and swears as they groggily wake and swallows the bile in his throat, rising to his feet and staggering over to the door, pulling it firmly before remembering that he'd locked it. "Draco?" Someone asks from behind him but he ignores them in favour for unlocking the door and moving into the hallway. His journey is more a stumble than a walk, and he finds himself veering to the side, resting heavily on the Castle's stone walls. Draco uses them as a crutch, fingers digging into any cracks and grooves he can find whilst he grits his teeth against the violent painful pulse of his cuts. He's not going back to the Common Room, not yet, he needs somewhere private. Empty classrooms are out, save he be intruded upon; the last thing he needs is a handsy couple or a nosy teacher finding him injured on a classroom floor. The Room of Requirement is a non-option, the mere thought of it sends the ghostly heat of Fendifyre scalding the back of his neck and the next breath he takes feels like smoke and ash. There's only one place to go.
Harry suddenly opened his eyes to put them on Malfoy, on his knees, his face close to his cock.
“Ok, I’ve my answer…” Malfoy sneered, sitting on his bed. “And so what do you intend to do with my offer?” he continued.
"But… how?" he blew, his heart nervously racing in his chest.
This statement floated in his mind, very quickly joined by a second, much more problematic, which compressed his chest as if he had just realized it.
Then the kiss stopped, the young man stared at Malfoy, but Malfoy looked at
“Don’t force it, mate.” Ron’s voice intimated, to his right.
Malfoy’s hand on the fence twitched slightly as he stood up slowly, while keeping his eyes firmly fixed on the landscape in front of him.
“Potter, please get out of here now!”
“That’s what I’m seeing, yes” he concluded, in a cold tone, his smile disappearing.
A good shower would set him straight. He needed it, terribly…
Harry moved forward again, determined.
Harry was frustrated and angry at himself for having felt the urge to replace his girlfriend with Malfoy for a moment of intimacy with her. Anger that grew stronger as he saw Malfoy evolve around him.
Harry’s eyes wide opened when he recognized the object.
“Well they’re wrong, I’m just another student and I also need to study to improve, it’s not innate!” he protested, raising his eyes to the ceiling.
"You mean you really don't have anything against this kind of practice?" he says, wrinkling his eyes.
Harry held her hand and held her every time his thoughts took him to the pebble road, lit by a moaning lamp post.
Not right now?
Malfoy continued to look at him in silence before accentuating his grin and lifting his chin.
Harry turned his eyes away from the armchair and placed them on the imposing black desk, also in moldings, where a multitude of files of all kinds, of which his must have been included.
He finally agreed to sit down and turned his attention to the young man who was a few meters away, his hands in his pants pockets, leaning against his desk.
This bloody mistletoe!
Harry opened wide his eyes, visibly shocked by his frankness, and then nodded before resuming his reading, his hands again tense on his book.
Harry raised his eyebrows, smugly, while completely detaching himself from Malfoy’s thighs. He lingered on the half-open shirt, revealing the milky skin of his torso as well as the fine line of blond hair that went down to his groin. Harry stared at it for a long time before looking down at the bump that Malfoy’s erection was forming through his trousers, holding back a moan knowing that he was directly the reason.
He was an idiot…
Harry made his gaze travel over Malfoy’s naked body, his breathing accelerating as he detailed it. Malfoy was particularly well proportioned, his skin of an almost transparent whiteness, shone as if the moon were reflected on it.
Draco closed his eyes, inhaling deeply to take the time to refocus.
He needed to clear his head because if he kept going down that slippery slope, he knew he couldn’t get up.
“I think we have to leave the past behind, if you want my opinion, let him move on its own, you can’t blame him because he’s trying to make up for his mistakes.” Hermione sighted.
At least for his mother, who was still living at the Manor. He had decided to move away, still too disturbed by what had happened there.
Staring at a grain of rice which he turned with his fork, he did not immediately hear the question that Ron asked him. He only emerged when he felt a violent blow in his arm, causing the fork to slide in the bottom of his plate.
His eyelids began to close when he felt sleep finish him off. He let his spirit escape, hoping that this night would be without dreams.
Malfoy took the direction of the bedroom while Ron and Hermione told him that everything was going to be fine and that we would find answers once the results of the Healers were recovered.
Draco came down and walked like we were sending him to the slaughterhouse. With his jaw stretched out, he went to the Aurors' office, a knot in his stomach.
Helpless…
Draco’s smile widened and became softer, with his heart beating louder in his chest.
Malfoy released his neck to slide his hand between them and up to his own neck to loosen the clasp of his cape which fell at his feet. Harry took the opportunity to put his hands between the sides of his robe and look for a piece of skin to catch.
Theodore Nott was a bloody genius. It was undeniable and Draco was delighted to know that he would take care of Harry, convinced that he was the best placed and also the best wizard therapist of his generation to be able to help Potter out psychologically.
"No, I was going to go anyway," replied Harry, doing his best to calm down.
He would find out later about Malfoy, he had to first understand what had happened to him and how it had happened. It was mainly on this story that he had to concentrate to move forward, to clarify the more than confusing situation in which he was entangled.
“Shut up, Malfoy!” Harry hissed, between his teeth.
after all, right?” he taunted, raising a sarcastic eyebrow.
Of course, Malfoy came from time to time with his colleagues as he did with Ron and Neville, but he had never seen him with his Hogwarts friends as he did tonight.
He felt himself pale and it must be seen because Hermione rose suddenly by calling Mrs Pomfrey with a loud voice.
“Look mate, I’m telling you this because I noticed that you two were less together, I’m just worried.”
“Now, if His Highness wishes, I would like to return to my dorm,” Zabini said, pointing to the building in front of him.
"Fuck you, Malfoy!" Harry shouted, exasperated.
She took two steps towards Harry and stole a kiss from him. Harry gave it back to her and put his arm over her shoulder.
“Don’t worry, mate, we’re not going to ask you to sing Hogwarts' anthem to make sure you can talk again.” Ron laughed, chewing a Chocolate Frog on a chair by his side.
And Draco had given up the idea of trying on his suit, and he following Harry to their bed, devouring his lips avidly, lying on the sheets, Harry just above him. Draco squeezed his fingers a little tighter on the edge of the kitchen closet, remembering Harry’s lips eating his neck, his warm breath burning his skin. His jet black hair, tickling his chest, making him shiver, his heady perfume filling his nose.
"Ron, stop being so childish, you want!" Hermione sighed, rolling her eyes and hitting his shoulder.
"How did you know someone had just kissed me?"
“No, but it’s their mere presence that bothers me. Already that in Hogwarts we supported them, I don’t want it to happen again. And then Malfoy is so weird lately, look at him, he doesn’t look anymore like that arrogant little prick he was, it seems like he’s impersonating someone else”
“Malfoy!” he suddenly yelled.
He took care of washing himself generously with his shower gel, rubbing his hair to massage his scalp, giving a feeling of comfort that he had not felt for two days.
So Harry went to the cafeteria with Ron for his breakfast, determined to forget the last slippages of his misguided mind. When he sat next to Ginny, she smiled at him, kissing him in love, and he immediately felt much better. He took her against him and began to swallow his meal.
Harry was lost in his grey eyes, darkened by pleasure and the strands of blond hair that fell before them. Harry found himself wanting to put one back behind his ear and remembered the man who had done the same and Malfoy had rejected him. So, Harry lowered his arm that he had lifted and caught Malfoy’s sex pointing at him.
And it was all Malfoy’s fault.
“Do you remember where you got them? Did you buy them or were they given to you?”
Malfoy had taken some time to answer.
“Me too” Harry breathed, who really hoped not to see Malfoy’s face appear during his personal pleasures.
“I assure you, Potter, only the chair has the spell. The rest of my furniture is perfectly devoid of it. But you’ll soon realize that, because obviously, if he had been, he wouldn’t have any effect on you” he confirmed, standing slowly, to get close to him.
She smiled at him and followed Ron out for their next class.
Harry took them out without flinching, applying himself to smoothing the tablecloth already in place before arranging the service on it for their dinner.
The haemoglobin escaped in fine red lines and traced the hollows between his fingers, dyeing the white, almost translucent features of his skin. He frowned detailing the red liquid rolling over the cracks in his hand and bent it slightly to let the blood flow to the side before shaking it to drain it over the table. He then removed the small pieces of glass and placed them on his plate, now stained with broken pieces, before taking his towel to sponge off his hand.
"Stop! I don't appreciate you're kidding me and especially not with this kind of bullshit! So you're going to give me the pleasure of revealing the real information that you and Blaise were talking about earlier!"
It had begun like all the others, piles of reports to read and correct before sending them to his boss so that he would sign them and gratify them with their usefulness. He had just completed his last investigation when an alarm sounded throughout the open space.
"But that’s not the problem, Malfoy! I just don’t want it to go on, is that clear?" Harry said in a retreat.
“Yeah, probably, so we’ll pick up Hermione on the 4th and get out of here,” Ron nodded up.
This one moved a little, getting closer to him. Harry could feel him breathing and his perfume reached his nose. A perfume that he had only perceived once, only a few days and yet, this one haunted him since that moment...
Harry glanced at him slightly and tensed up again when he fell on his immaculate arm, remembering their last discussion.
The snow had fallen all night, covering the alleys with its white carpet, the cold wind blowing between the dead trees. He enjoyed these moments.
Apparently, even then, he kept thinking about Malfoy.
Potter measured him for a moment before speaking again.
"Huh?" Harry startled. "N-no, nothing, I was just dreaming," he added, kissing his cheek.
“No, of course not…” Theo grinned, stretching out his ever-disturbing smile.
Was it he who produced all this? Was it his magic that caused this mess?
“And what will be my reward if I succeed?” he asked, raising an innocent eyebrow.
He had believed in a spell or something, but had realized that he and only he was disturbed.
spell, I really don’t see the point in offering to help you master it in nonverbal!”
Because if Harry had the power to break the ice that hid his being, Draco had the ability to give birth to that glow in the Survivor’s green eyes that showed how important he was. That incandescent fire that burned in his veins when he handled words. Stinging and sharp when he was angry, subtle and enticing when he wanted to make him lose his mind.
“So what do we do?” Harry asked, crossing his arms on his chest.
Draco couldn’t believe what was going on.
His head wasn’t spinning, it was his mind that was spinning. His stomach, too tight, was causing him a high heart when he descended one by one the steps of the stands between one of the rows of seats.
He waited patiently for the water to warm up, leaning on a cupboard in the kitchen, his fingers on the edge of the work surface.
“Why are we doing
“Are you alone? Where are Ron, Hermione and Ginny?” his friend wondered.
Harry then stopped chewing, holding his breath.
When his breathing slowed, he kissed him gently before pulling out and letting Ginny rise.
The others stood back. But Malfoy advanced until he found himself a few inches from Harry.
“What are you talking about?” he spit, always distrustful, allowing himself to more familiarity given the person standing in front of him.
“Well, I’ll tell you, I never thought of it…you weren’t together until I got here…” Harry said in a breath.
An acid taste rose up into his throat, coming directly from his stomach, prompting him to rise quickly to expel it.
It had not been easy to temper him, but he had finally succeeded and Malfoy almost threw himself on Harry to kiss him wildly while removing his clothes.
“Oh! That’s one of the peculiarities of my practice, you see. The chair you were sitting in a few minutes ago is spellbound to dissuade patients from leaving my office. It’s endowed with a powerful persuasive spell that plunges anyone in contact with it into a sense of well-being and comfort. The patient is then totally relaxed and reveals everything I want to hear without having to cook it more” he explained.
Harry wouldn’t budge, he was kind of petrified about what Malfoy was doing to him.
Harry had stretched out his arm to grab some food and after a last look of distrust, he had bitten immediatly in the piece of bread, delighting himself with sugar that delighted his taste buds. He had sighed, feeling his body invigorating, the feeling of hunger weakening as the sugar passed through his blood to awaken his senses.
Malfoy was always staring at him and Harry felt bad, being so glared.
His father was rotting his days in Askaban and his mother was trying so hard to make a good face.
“Seriously? Good old Theo? I am not even surprised that he chose this path, it is certainly the one that suits him best. Manipulating people was one of his favorite hobbies” he noticed while drinking a sip of wine.
The symbols he had seen yesterday appeared, floating before his eyes before Pomfrey rotated them with a wrist move.
Let Malfoy have the upper hand.
Malfoy squinted his eyes before lowering them to look at his thigh and then raised them to plunge his metallic irises into his.
Was Dumbledore still there?
“But… How is that possible? he asked, blinking, terrified.
“I don’t see how, making me lose my temper and pissed me off, are something to do with your work Nott” he hissed.
“I didn’t intend to look at him. He was the one who stood right in front of us, I just noticed that he was there.”
Then Harry uttered not a single word and swallowed his saliva to retain what he had on his heart and to keep buried all his secrets.
“Err… You came to see Draco I suppose?” he asked, as if it were the very evidence.
Harry relaxed a little, still keeping his wand in his hand, lowering it a little and began to detail the strange secret passage.
"Ok, go rest then. I’m sleeping at Mione’s tonight, we’ll see you tomorrow, did you bring it?”
He couldn’t decently let his misplaced cravings take over… He had Ginny and he loved her, he was sure of it.
Harry stared at him for a moment before gave him a slight smile.
Harry barely heard Ginny’s exclamations behind his back, the speed of the wind blowing through his ears as he moved forward. He was alone now, neither Ron nor Ginny had been able to follow him.
Harry blinked, disturbed by his question, which he was absolutely not prepared for.
“I know what you saw and you never knew how to lie, so I know you’re telling the truth. Thank you also for your frankness” Draco sneered, revealing her white teeth in a sincere smile.
"So, you think pureblood like me doesn't respect traditions?" he asked, seriously.
“But who gave me such an asshole…You’re really crazy! You fucking obsessed!” Harry shouted, pacing the room while pulling his hair. He was clearly on the verge of an explosion.
“Don’t say it like that!” Harry sighed, turning his head to plant his eyes in his own.
“No, sir” he said, by closing everything about Malfoy in a corner of his head.
The students turned away from their teacher to examine the various trinkets on their table. All identical, they looked like a Muggle puzzle, where a few pieces were nested together. Some more in relief, suggested that they had to rotate to match.
He had never liked Malfoy, but he would never have gone so far as to kill him.
“Okay, you’re right, we can’t…”
The other students around him were all focused on doing the same, depending on the specialty they had chosen.
Potter, grabbing bits of his hair, his eyes looking down, terrified.
“Thank you” he blew, a ball forming in his throat, preventing him from swallowing properly.
Malfoy stopped in the door gap, lowering his shoulders, resigned.
He wanted it last time. He was crazed to touch Malfoy’s imperfect lips. Too pale and too tight, every time he pinched them. And now he absolutely wanted to taste them.
Harry laughed before he could help himself and held his arms to his ribs as he collapsed on his chair.
Harry opened wide his eyes.
Theo had stared at him for a long time before deigning to answer him very calmly.
“It doesn’t take a genius to guess that this guy just got dumped. Malfoy, and his legendary way of making you understand that you are a piece of shit in one fucking gaze. Who could honestly want to spend time with someone like him?" Ron retorted, with a wicked gaze to Malfoy.
Harry passed his hands on either side of his skull and pulled his hair.
“Great! It’s awesome to see you all back here!” Dean said, excited.
Twist of fate when we knew how much they were supposed to hate each other. That even Ginny, his girlfriend, didn’t help him to get better, even though, on the other hand, he loved her…
“Well, you’re going to have to do it, because that’s exactly what’s going to happen... NOTHING! Absolutely more NOTHING!” Harry thundered, mimicking with his arms.
"It doesn't matter, you just panicked, you never wanted to do it at first," Draco replied.
Harry listened, his eyes fixed on his best friend, his hands on his temples, his wand sinking into the skin of his forehead.
“Where is your sense of joke?” he taunted, raising his eyebrow a little more, his gaze firmly set on the object.
“We’d better try to get some sleep, tomorrow we’ll start practice and I think we’ll be even more exhausted than we are today,” Ron said, changing the subject and taking off his clothes to put on his pajamas.
Harry uttered a raucous moan when he was fully inside, allowing himself to breathe for a moment before moving back a little. He began a new movement, his eyes still anchored in those of Malfoy who also stared at him with his dark gaze.
“Stop being dumb!” he winced, then began to remove his own pants, pulling off his underwear and throwing them carelessly to the side.
“Is Malfoy back yet?” Harry interrupted, in a louder voice.
"No … it can't be true, it can't be …" Draco stuttered.
“Count on it” he said, opening the door with a smirk, before crossing the threshold and disappearing behind.
Snape, Harry. And yes, he has my full confidence.”
The beats against his chest intensified as he stared at Malfoy with a certain appetite, feeling all his senses waking up when he was doing nothing more than reading a
Malfoy gauged him for a moment, obviously trying to find out if he was lying.
An immeasurable need to cry came up to his throat, imagining that he had let him make love to him, that he had let him touch him delicately, the indescribable glow shining in his grey eyes when he was preparing him.
“Yeah, but I feel like I’m spending my fucking time, typing this damn report that’s going on forever...”
He nodded before Ron disappeared, leaving them alone in the small living room.
“Learn to master yourself, Mr. Potter, your future depends only on what you do with it and the actions that flow from it.”
“I’m not staying, Potter. I still have work to do,” he replied, in a dragging tone.
He then shifted his focus to the door and began to turn the handle when Malfoy’s dragging voice behind him startled him.
Once the cabin had touched down, he came out with a heavy heart of apprehension.
The Gryffindor, turned completely, his eyes wide open by surprise.
“See ya, Potter” Malfoy replied behind his back as he reached the threshold of the rest room door.
“So what’s the fucking problem?”
“Are you okay?” he asked, looking into Harry’s eyes.
"I just told you no, so good evening to you too," replied Harry, in a tone without appeal.
His emotions were particularly heightened today and Harry knew who was behind it.
Malfoy hit his nightstand and the objects on it wobbled dangerously.
“Hi Hermione, as you will no doubt have noticed, there is a little problem with Har... Potter and I doubt we’re on time for the reception,” Malfoy added of his dragging voice.
Harry closed his eyes as strong as he could to stop facing the truth. He placed his hands on his ears so as not to hear what Nott kept telling him.
…?” he answered in a breath.
Draco looked at him intensely before he sneered.
Harry focused his attention on the armrest, pulling on the quilted fabric under his fingers. He glanced at the clock, following the hypnotic movement of the slowly moving needle.
"It will be, I promise" he said, staring at it with a determined look.
“Yes... Just like that...”
Harry opened wide his eyes, stunned.
It was perfectly ridiculous, but the despair of one day finding back his world as he knew it, gave him the irresistible urge to collapse and cry.
"Fin-" He whispers, voice shaking and barely audible. His wand wavers where it's pointed at Sirius. "Finite Incantatum." Sirius flicks into existence and there are startled exclamations echoing in the Atrium. Lupin's wand almost cracks beneath his grip and he all but falls at Sirius' side. His hands go to his cheeks, disbelieving and grey eyes matching Draco's flick open.
"Where is he?!" Potter questions before his voice raises into a deafening yell. "WHERE IS SIRIUS?!"
There's a shift of wind and a soft pop, much softer than what accompanies Apparation and Draco relaxes somewhat, realising Potter and his posse have gone.
Potter.
NEXT ON DEEDS UNDONE:
"-Cant-Breathe-" He gasps out, unimpressed. He can almost hear her patience waning.
"We're not alone."
Fudge turns a violent shade of purple. "And I do believe the Prophet will be expecting answers, perhaps it's best to go prepare for them."
"We would like to escort the students back to Hogwarts via Portkey. I do think, after all they've been through, and the appearance of the Dark Lord, it would be best if you would allow them to do so privately."
"No!" His protest is soft but strong and he can sense the vague chill of her presence beside him. "I jus'...need to...rest." Draco tries to assure her. "Can I...res' here?"
"No favouritism among the houses?" He tips his head back, laugh incredulous, when it lowers his lips are turned down into bitter grin. "Look me in the eye and tell me that anyone else would've received the same treatment. That any Slytherins would've received the same treatment-"
before ducking an off fired curse and making his way to Tonks to do the same. His Aunt is mere feet away, cackling manically as she fires one vicious spell after another. Despite her speed, Draco is quicker. Her spells bounce off of his shield charms, each popping up at random in front of her targets until she snarls, turning and baring her teeth. He thinks bitterly that she should be proud at him for so easily getting under an opponent's skin. She had been his teacher after all.
They open again suddenly, Draco's entire body jerking as he claws his way out from the nightmare of a memory. The same ceiling greets him, the same floor hard beneath him, but it's not flooded with water, it's still the puddled damp. There's no torturous cuts on his skin, layers of flesh pulling apart and Draco blinks, staring up unseeing as he pants. It was just a dream. He slowly sits, tilting his head back and greedily welcoming the cold air of the chilly bathroom. His breathing has almost returned to normal when he becomes aware of the terrible ache on his arm. There's a stain on the bathroom floor, like rust and grime except the shade is deeper and it pools, mixing with the thin layer of water on the ground. Draco's chest seizes. His eyes are locked on the blood on the ground and all he can feel is the pain in his arm as it becomes overwhelming, Myrtles voice rings in his ear as loud and clear as a bell. She's saying something, a tangled hum of a sentence but all he can hear is her screams of 'MURDERER!' Draco tries to breathe but chokes on an inhale, imagining the thick cloying discharge of that spell in the air. It cuts his lungs now as easily as it had his flesh those years ago. There's ringing in his ears...no, it's screaming...no, it's his own cries. Draco thinks beneath it all he hears the hum of Snape's lullaby.
"They're gone." Dumbledore assures. "All but the ones we can trust."
Draco's emotions flutter between anger and humiliation. "Sod off!" He manages to snarl. "Filthy Mu-" This time it isn't his breathing that cuts him off. He presses his lips together, eyes clenching shut and flinching at the word he was about to say. "Just- Sod off," He pants weakly. He isn't entirely sure why he didn't say it, internally he frowns at himself. It had been like that since some point during his Sixth year. After the summer and the things he'd witnessed, the word felt heavier on his tongue and the sound of it made his stomach turn. Draco had forced himself to say it, sneering the word even as he began not to believe it. He’d thought it might be easier that way, that listening to their screams might be easier to hear if he thought of them solely as Mudbloods instead of actual humans. After all, it had worked so well for the Death Eaters causing the screams.
"Go-" He tries to say through hitching breaths. His skin feels like a tight cage around his bones. "-Away."
felt tainted after the Dark Lord's brand had sunken into his skin. He crawls towards the sinks, pulling himself up and running one of the taps. It squeaks beneath his hand and his fingers catch on an odd engraving on it's side. He pays no attention to it, instead he groans in frustration as no water meets him and grabs the next one, turning it quickly and almost crying as cool water rushes from it. Draco sticks his head under it, inside his mind he can hear his Father's echoing voice berating him for doing something so muggle and improper. Except his father wouldn't be berating him. Not any longer. Not now Draco had ensured his captivity in Azkaban. Eventually he slumps to the side, leaving the tap running as he presses his forehead to the chipped sink in front of him.
Draco isn't sure what his role was to be in any situation. What had his role been before?
"Guests." Moody corrects dryly, he's still turned in their direction and the Order members turn too, wands raised and ready. Moody fires a spell so quick that Draco almost doesn't stop it. His Protego is whispered, but the mere hum of his voice makes the Order members stiffen. Moody smiles as if smug at having confirmed his presence. Draco scans each Order member with open fear. They're all covered in blood and dirt from the skirmish and he watches Lupin raise his nose in the air. The Werewolf looks years older, face creased and eyes hollow.
"As your Headmaster, I must insist against such reckless action." Dumbledore says. "However," He adds, voice gentle. "I do commend your courage and your loyalty. Now, take hold of this Portkey. Madam Pomfrey will see to your injuries. One...Two...Three..."
It's as if the room collectively holds it's breath, and Draco holds his own with it.
"Perhaps that's not the role for me to take."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco lets the exhaustion take him.
"Well, Alistair?" Dumbledore says politely. "Why did you request such privacy?"
The breath he takes is painful and sharp. "I don't know what you're talking about."
Myrtle's bathroom is as he remembers it from before the war. The large mirror is still spotted and cracked, the sinks riddled with various chips. The floor is damp beneath his knees as he sinks to it, and he's thankful that in the dim light he can't fully see his reflection. Draco always struggled to look at it after his marking. He never looked different, not at first, but he could feel it. His magic felt tainted,
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know." He says blankly. The voice is referring to the bathroom, Draco is referring to so much more. He shouldn't be in this time, in this alternate life he's just created. He shouldn't be in Hogwart's after all he's done,
"So could you." He says in rebuttal.
." He says the spell so gently that if it wasn't for the way her body stilled, he'd think Voldemort was being kind. "You could do much better in my service." He begins, and those red eyes move up. Draco holds his breath, even though Voldemort's eyes settle slightly to his left, it feels as though the other is staring right at him. Skeletal fingers move forward, mere inches from touching Draco.
Time. Devourer of all things.
"Department of Mysteries." The cool voice of the Ministry says and Draco keeps his wand in his hand as he walks forward, past the protection of the lift's golden gates. The corridor is so dark his pale skin seems to glow, and the flickering torches mounted on the wall are the only source of light. He'd been here before; once as a child and several times when he'd felt older than his bones. The only noise is his footsteps as he approaches the black door. They echo uncomfortably in the quiet and Draco takes slow breaths to steady himself. He's buzzing with energy, adrenaline rushing in preparation of what he'll face, and magical core insistent on any type of release. It's swollen, feeling far too big for his skinny form and he hopes he'll be able to cope with his fully matured magic in an immature body.
"Either give us the prophecy or watch your little friend die the hard way!" Draco watches Potter's throat bob as he swallows thickly, hand outstretched with the prophecy, an open offering. Time slows as his Father reaches for it greedily. It's the moment of truth. The last moment. If he did this...If he went through with his plan...It would change everything. That had been the purpose of course, but faced with the final decision leaves his wand hand shaking. He's scared. He always has been. Neither option offers him an out from that fear. If he let his Father take the prophecy and give it to Voldemort, it would only aid his reign of terror. Draco would still wake up with blood staining the walls of his home, Nagini slithering in the hallways, Death Eaters in the rooms he'd played in as a child. The image of Fenrir's smile, all fang and threat, flashes in front of his eyes and Draco's fear grows thicker. He can't go back to that. He can't live like that. Not anymore. Not again.
The next spell she casts is met with a
"Sirius," Lupin breathes.
It's the same demanding tone she'd used in his lessons. This time Draco feels brave enough to ignore her. The first spell to leave his wand is a flash of green light that she blocks. They grow from there, each one faster, each one more vicious than before. He uses every spell in his arsenal, every spell she'd ever taught him and unleashes it all in a barrage of light and colour, the magic making his wand hiss and thrum. At first Bellatrix whirls wildly with unrestrained rage before her eyes land on the blood dripping from his arm. She cackles victoriously.
Draco isn't sure he deserves to be just a boy.
"Most students call me Moaning Myrtle," the Ghost tells him as if he hadn't already known. "They're all so mean."
." Sirius flicks into existence and there are startled exclamations echoing in the Atrium. Lupin's wand almost cracks beneath his grip and he all but falls at Sirius' side. His hands go to his cheeks, disbelieving and grey eyes matching Draco's flick open.
Firenze sends him a look that's even sharper and clouded with amusement. "Categorically." His hand moves gently down towards the broken wing and the Thestral hisses. "It'll die if it's left like this." He says it so matter of factly that Draco can't help but wince internally. He was right. Injured and alone it would die. Everything would die eventually, he wasn't sure why the thought of it suddenly felt so bad.
"Everything dies." He says plainly.
He hears the hum of her voice as she answers but he's so tired. He's so very tired.
"Granger," he calls and she pauses in the doorway. The Gryffindor turns her head to face him, eyes narrowed and nostrils flaring, clearly expecting an insult. "Thank you." Draco says quietly, and he's surprised by how much he means it. The shock of his thanks seems to fry the few brain cells she has and Granger stares at him, mouth slightly agape before she nods slowly and walks through the door.
Her body has not even hit the floor when the voice rings out.
"You're having a panic attack," the voice says and Draco flinches. He knows, but Malfoys aren't meant to be so simple. They aren't meant to be so weak. "You need to focus on your breathing." It says and Draco realises with a growing horror that the voice belongs to Granger.
Draco lets the exhaustion take him.
of himself. There's no body or bones to keep him together and tethered. He's just a presence, drifting in a non existent wind. The sensation starts slowly. If he had to describe it, Draco would say it felt like grains of sand against his bare skin, but that's not quite possible with his lack of body. The feeling builds until the grains are no longer brushing against his feeling, but pushing and pressing. It turns burning and Draco is swallowed in the sensation of it, gritting imaginary teeth against the pain.
"Y'know Bella" A voice yells and they both whirl to the source. Sirius Black stands atop the dais, eyes sharp but grin lazy as he stares down his cousin. "I always did like Andy more."
She'd whispered.
"Oh dear," Myrtle says suddenly above him. "Are you dying?"
It fades quickly, but he knows they've seen it.
The blonde is deaf to the word that leaves the Saviour's lips but he's not numb to the pain. Magic slices through his skin, but it's not like a knife through butter. Instead it's like a pinprick, before the gap widens and the skin pulls itself apart. There's tension in the act, like pulling damp clothes from your skin, but it persists and each cut opens with overwhelming agony. He can feel the tears on his skin again and sobs openly, breaths wet and ragged. It's too much for his body to bear and his eyes close.
NEXT ON DEEDS UNDONE:
"You - you can't just - " The Minister splutters.
Was he even allowed to be anything else?
"That is true," Firenze says with a low hum. "Everything has it's time... But, you could change that. You could save it."
It takes a moment for them to register his meaning. Draco doesn't have the energy for full sentences.
The words spell in the air, but they flicker and shake. "Protect him." Lupin reads. "Protect who?" Draco pushes himself backwards, one hand lingering on Sirius' chest before he withdraws.
, he wants to scream.
"Which is why you need to." Granger says. "Copy me." He listens to the exaggerated inhale and exhales of her breathing. He struggles to mirror them and closes his eyes until he slips easier into the pattern. "There we go," she encourages. His cheeks burn from the vulnerability of the situation. She stays there until his breathing is shaky but regular and Draco grows tenser, pulling his knees to his chest and staring at her from lowered lids. Granger stares back at him. She looks as she always has, dark skin only a few shades lighter than her eyes, the curls that halo her face are as untamed as always, but her expression is different. It's not full of contempt or pity, it's open and curious, as though he's the cover of new book she's discovered. His stare turns into a glare and she huffs, standing and smoothing her hands over her robes as if it can neaten the wrinkles from where she'd been knelt beside him. "You should see Madam Pomfrey." Granger says before arching a brow at his blank expression. "For your arm," she clarifies before tacking on, "and also for a calming draught." The Witch turns to leave.
Draco scoffs. "Well my role isn't to be stood in the dirt chattering with you." Firenze's voice stops him as he turns to leave.
"Fin-" He whispers, voice shaking and barely audible. His wand wavers where it's pointed at Sirius. "
"We're not alone."
Draco's teeth grind. "Consequences? Like the ones issued to the Golden Boy? Do remind me, Professor: What were his consequences for chasing a troll in first year? For almost setting a snake on a student in second year? And lets not forget his attempt at fame and fortune last year. What were the consequences for entering the Tournament again? What are the consequences for any of your precious Gryffindors?"
The world buzzes around them and Draco lifts his head, shuffling closer to Sirius as one by one, the floos light up. The steady flashes of emerald green are too similar to the Killing Curse for his liking.
"You're asking me?" She says, bewildered and Draco remembers just how little kindness she'd received before their first meeting.
Potter's spell bounces off a silent shield and Voldemort turns, shoulders heaving as if he's a tired and disappointed parent berating his child. "Did you parents not teach you to wait your turn, Harry Potter?" He asks lightly and Draco can picture the smile on his face as he says; "Oh, I suppose they never got the chance. Such a shame." Potter's features twist with fear and rage but Draco staggers away as silently as he can, stomach rolling and desperate to leave. "You have irked me far too often, for far too long" Voldemort says as Draco drops to his knees where he'd laid Sirius. "
- righteous anger won't hurt me for long." Her wand raises. "I'll show you how it's done, shall I? I'll give you a lesson - " Potter edges around the side of the fountain as she screams; "
"The journey must have been hard." The Professor says, cutting him off. "What you did is no easy feat. Nor is what you're going to do."
"You're asking me?" She says, bewildered and Draco remembers just how little kindness she'd received before their first meeting.
It's different from the other times he's cast it. There's no hesitation. It's of his own whim and impulse. This time his voice doesn't shake, he's learned not to be so obvious in his reluctance, but his hand certainly does. He knows as his lips form the last letter that it's failed. There's none of the hatred and anger that it needs to carry, instead it's frightened and desperate and he feels like a wounded animal. Every action he takes is nought but a snarl.
"And what
He stumbles when he lands, his usual grace foreign to limbs he's yet to grow into. His arrival is almost silent, and he lands in a shadowy patch of the room. Draco still takes care to disillusion himself non verbally as he takes stock of the room. There are ten Death Eaters, all of them with their gazes fixed firmly on the Boy Who Lived. Potter stands on the raised dais, in front of a whispering arch. Clutched firmly in his hand is a glass prophecy, in the other his wand, warily raised. His dark complexion is the palest Draco has ever seen, his eyes tight and the turn of his lips painfully desperate. It takes a moment for Draco to realise why. Longbottom lays at his Aunt's feet in a pile of sweat and tears. The remnants of the Cruciatus curse lingers heavily in the air like a sour smell.
"Come on!" Sirius jeers, "you can do better than that!" Bellatrix cries out in rage. Her next spell flies over his head in a blur of red light. The second finds purchase in his chest. The laughter hasn't fully died on his lips even as his eyes widen in shock. It seems like an age as the spell hits them, and then he falls, body curved in a graceful arc as he sags backwards towards the archway. Draco is there to catch him. The room is silent save for the thundering crack of his Apparation. He lands quickly, a body blockade between the Heir of The House of Black and impending death. There's a ghostly feeling at his back, the whispering beckoning him, tendrils of mist leaning towards him as if seeking an embrace. He grips Sirius tight and spins so quickly his entire presence lasts no less than a second. They land in the Atrium, a mess of tangled limbs. Draco turns, laying Sirius on the cold floor, his chest rises shallowly, face shining with sweat. Unconscious, but alive.
Saint Potter. The Golden Boy. The Hero. The One Who Defeated The Dark Lord. He never did any wrong. Even if he had, everyone would flock to him with adoration and reassure him that he hadn't. They'd still be in awe. He'd still be Potter. He'd still be good. Draco doesn't get to be that. He gets to be Malfoy. The spells that want to leave his lips are dark. He doesn't want to hurt Potter, not really but all the magic that comes to mind are spells that turn bones to ash and boil blood in it's victim's veins. He doesn't want to hurt Potter and that's not fair either. Potter is his rival and his enemy and everything he wants and hates and can never be. Draco can't bring himself to cause more pain. Malfoy wants to cause so much pain.
"Well, Alistair?" Dumbledore says politely. "Why did you request such privacy?"
"No!" His protest is soft but strong and he can sense the vague chill of her presence beside him. "I jus'...need to...rest." Draco tries to assure her. "Can I...res' here?"
"Come out, come out, little Harry." She croons, voice bouncing off of the polished floors.
" - See here Dumbledore! You haven't got authorisation for that Portkey!" Draco doesn't lift his eyes from where they're staring blankly at the floor, but he can imagine the redness of Fudge's face. "You can't do things like that right in front of the Minister for Magic, you - you - " His voice falters and Dumbledore's voice drops to something low. Draco doesn't care enough to listen in. The presence in the Atrium is quickly dwindling and the Slytherin hopes if he waits long enough he can get them both into a floo discretely enough.
The days he spent casting it on others under threat of his own torture. The way she'd forced him to kill, to torture to tear lives apart and laughed every time. Righteous anger could not hurt her for long.
, Draco thinks darkly.
"I'll fetch a teacher!" She proclaims suddenly. Draco can't tell if it's out of concern or a want to get a student out of her usually empty bathroom.
, the shield shimmering around Potter who looks around startled. Draco rises, tired and staggering but wand raised and burning. It would be a lie to say he hadn't thought about this. He steps forward, closing his eyes and summoning enough strength for this one final fight. He calls to mind every lesson he'd ever had with her. The hours spent beneath her
"Mas-ter-" Bellatrix gurgles wetly, iron fills the air as blood leaves her body. There's no Snape with his singing hymn this time, the spell's victim lays on the cold hard ground, with no warmth to keep her company.
Her face appears suddenly in front of his, ghostly form leaning through the wall of pipes beneath the sinks. He'd spent enough time with her antics in Sixth year, so Draco doesn't so much as blink.  Myrtle seems both curious and disappointed in his lack of reaction.
The closer he gets the less he can breathe and Draco slashes his wand, drawing a burning line on the floor between them. It glows like heated coal before cooling but the Order members look down at it as if it'll strike them. He can't fathom why they're being so gentle with him. The Death Eaters would had cursed him by now. He'd be writhing under a Crucio, not for information, but for their amusement.
"You cannot win against me!" Bellatrix cries.
"Stop!" Sirius and Lupin say but the others don't hear them over their spell casting. It's harder to dodge the spells now that Moody's fake eye seems to be able to see his silhouette and his steps turn into a manic and desperate dash.
Draco flinches and turns, heart in his throat and expecting to see Potter's body laid lifeless on the floor.
The green flames rear up and swallow him. The floo had never been Draco's favourite method of transportation and he's reminded why at the feeling that washes over him. He finds the flames have a funny kind of heat, the warmth is there but yet it isn't. He holds his breath through the journey, feeling vulnerable and uncomfortably warm until he stumbles out in the middle of the Ministry's Atrium. The fireplace he'd just vacated gives a dull roar before flickering to a mere ember. He's here. He made it. Grey eyes turn immediately to the golden gates, gleaming innocently. The security desk beside it is completely empty, and Draco thanks anyone who's listening as he darts forwards to the lifts. There's no telling just how long he'd been in Umbridge's office. Draco jabs the button for the lifts manically, as if that will quicken it's appearance. It arrives with a loud clank that makes him wince before he slips inside, pressing the button for the ninth floor with no less ferocity. It startles into movement and his descent is accompanied by a jangling and rattling noise that he would otherwise find worrying. As it stands, he's quite grateful for the noise, unsure if he'd be able to bear the silence.
He hears it when he stops outside the door, the nervous chatter and babbling of others. Their voices are unmistakable and he picks the members of the D.A. out. Dread settles in him like lead. He's late, he didn't come early enough. If they're here then Potter is, and his Father is too. Magical discharge rises suddenly in the air, so thick Draco could choke on him and he panics. Apparation is never a good idea when your mind isn't entirely clear. Regardless, Draco turns, feeling his bones squeeze and pop as he's carried through space.
Draco's teeth grind so hard he thinks he hears them crack under the pressure. "How dare you-"
"I'm... not dying..." He says, words slurring. "...I need-"
Malfoy. Malfoy. Malfoy. It was always Malfoy. '
"...'s your bath...bathroom..."
The Wizard's chest seizes. He'd just killed his Aunt, surely it wouldn't be too much to kill his Professor. He'd only
He hears the hum of her voice as she answers but he's so tired. He's so very tired.
"Such violence," Voldemort says, tone soft. It still echoes in the empty Atrium, and Draco feels each repetition in his aching bones.  "Such bloodlust." He moves with such ease that he looks as if he's floating. Draco finds himself frozen, quite unable to move. Voldemort's snakelike face isn't even turned towards him, rather his red, slit-pupilled eyes are focused on his dying servant.
Draco feels as though he may be hinting at something more than the Thestral and the thought makes his skin prickle uncomfortably.
Moody laughs a rough and gravelly sound.
"Who's there?!" She asks sharply, eyes whirling, wand still trained on Potter. "Who's there?! REVEAL YOURSELF!"
"Protect him." Lupin reads. "Protect who?" Draco pushes himself backwards, one hand lingering on Sirius' chest before he withdraws.
The tears are hot, eyes burning as they streak down his face. His mouth is open, sobs coming from his hitching chest. One of the tears slips over his lips and the taste of the salt is as bitter he feels. The sink beneath his hands is ice cold in contrast, and the chipped surface digs uncomfortably at the skin of his palms. Draco doesn't care. His arm burns beneath the fabric of his sleeve, swollen and sensitive. He hasn't been able to bring himself to look at it. Instead, Draco stares at his reflection in the mirror. He doesn't want this. He doesn't want any of this but he has to do it, he has to be one of
"...'s your bath...bathroom..."
NEXT ON DEEDS UNDONE:
I don't know whether I like this chapter or not, but I'll let you know that I happen to love the next one.
"Bella," he says, voice cold and high. "My faithful servant." His wand lifts towards her, and her eyes light, ready to receive his merciful help. "You have disappointed me." The Dark Lord says. "
. Her eyes had shone the same way then as they did now.
Draco decides then that he hates her no less than he did before. He grits his teeth, opening his eyes to say something but all he sees is the blood and the water and then Potter is there and he can't breathe.
A familiar jangling noise comes from his right and Draco's head jerks up, pulling Sirius' body backwards and disillusioning him too. He can feel his own flickering before he reinforces it, placing himself defensively between Sirius and whoever is coming their way. He isn't expecting it when his Aunt rushes from the lift, grin unhinged as she rushes towards the telephone lift. Another creaking noise and a second lift arrives. Potter runs out before the golden gates are fully opened, and Draco watches his Aunt turn, firing a spell in Potter's direction. The boy hero ducks, diving behind the Fountain of Magical Brethren. The golden gates ring like a bell as the spell hits them instead of it's intended target. Bellatrix stops running, instead she turns, hip cocked and head tilted as she stares at the Fountain.
them, Potter!" She crows, sending a wordless spell towards the Fountain where Potter is still hiding. It hits the head of the handsome wizard, and it's blown backwards, rolling off his shoulders and screeching across the floor, leaving scratch marks in it's wake. "You need to really want to cause pain- " She sings. "
Draco sits beside him, ears ringing and chest heaving. He's aware then, of the ache in his ribs and dampness of his cheek and arm. He looks down, detached and suddenly exhausted as he takes into the account the vicious cut on his arm. The rush of the fight had left him unaware, but he watches the blood drip down in rivulets, soaking his fingers and staining the wood of his wand. He needs to go. He knows that, from what he remembers, Dumbledore would be here soon, then Voldemort himself and then the Aurors. Draco doesn't want to risk being caught by them, nor did he want to risk Sirius being sent back to Azkaban.
over Order members too idiotic to remember to protect their blind spots that he misses the Death Eater that works his way towards Potter. He turns at the man's enraged yell, seeing him stumble away from Potter and Longbottom, one hand raised protectively over his eye.
"You should ignore them," He tells her, eyes fluttering. "You don't deserve it, Myrtle." She never had. It was part of why he had connected with her so heavily in the past- the future. She had been misunderstood and alone, unable to do anything about her circumstances. Draco had been put in a far too similar predicament. Myrtle stares at him from behind her round glasses and Draco struggles to keep his eyes on her. Bile rises suddenly in his throat and he turns to the side, retching onto the cold floor. Myrtle shrieks at the mess whilst he heaves. It's his own fault. It's the fallback of magical exhaustion; a consequence of all he's done in the space of a few hours. He presses his back against the sinks, pushing himself away from the pile of vomit, not having the strength to so much as raise his wand, let alone spell it away. His head droops, chin touching his chest.
”, satisfied?” he asked, raising his eyebrow a little more.
Harry had always known deep down that Malfoy would be a Death Eater, it was in his genes, it was the logical follow-up to his fate.
OoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoOoO
Malfoy sneered, holding him by his shoulders.
” he calmly replied.
“I wish in the future you wouldn’t try to go back into your past like that again. I’ve no desire to have to explain what may have damaged your neural connectors” he said, in his dragging voice.
When he took a shower that night, he sighed and let the tears come to his eyes.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment and thought back at the strange event that had occurred that morning. Harry had certainly let his emotions get in the way of his magic and had once again made him feel five times what he felt.
“Well, it doesn’t look like!”
And how could he have slipped like that?
The flask always floated in front of him, the golden reflections reflected through the room while the Cauldrons Cakes, still in suspension, shone with this faint yellowish glow.
“It’s too complicated, I don’t want to do that anymore” he blew, almost crushing his hand into his own as his burning gaze was already falling on Draco’s lips.
Malfoy breathed a weary sigh.
Harry nodded positively before looking away, seeking to mask the discomfort he felt in his presence.
Candles floating above his head were reflected in the golden liquid of his mead and he stretched a bitter smile, tightening his fingers against his glass.
Harry felt the blood leave his face when he realized that he knew exactly where he had seen the box before and was angry that he had not understood it earlier.
It was beyond anything he knew, and he had no idea how to manage it on a day-to-day basis.
“Let’s say it’s a good start, but you’ll have to be a little more demonstrative next time” he replied, in a smirk.
Draco, surreptitiously closed his eyes to the sound that resonated between the walls, then immediately reopened them, his heart bursting in his chest.
Blaise shrugged his shoulders.
He pulled on one of the skins of his thumb once again and winced under the pain before he carried his hand to his mouth to lick the wound.
Potter gauged him for a moment before answering him.
Because he couldn’t stand to feel Harry go against him, the scent of his skin filled his nostrils and put his mouth against his shoulder to delight in the spicy taste of Potter’s skin.
“What did you not understand in the words “go home Potter”? Should I have gone into more detail? I would have thought the message was pretty clear.” He asked, in his dragging tone.
After a last breath, Harry deigned to turn his eyes towards her before once again lowering his head to put his attention on his plate.
“We’re adults now, Ron, it’s no longer a matter of pissing each other off like we used to.” Harry jeered, rolling his eyes.
“How was it with Theo?” he asked abruptly, the question burning his lips.
“Potter” Draco answered, shaking his hand.
“I sleep at Mione’s tonight, but I can go home if you prefer?” Ron asked.
He instantly froze when he felt it pushed, too, to join the first finger still inside his flesh and closed his eyes under the pain he felt going up his spine.
Ron had some information to bring to them, hoping that what he was saying would later prove to be true.
Potter rolled his eyes.
Malfoy ended up breaking eye contact and quickly escaping in the opposite direction.
Hermione smoothed her hair quickly before smiling at them.
He then rested the cloth and glanced at the enchanted objects that prepared the meal before leaving for the living room. He hesitated for a moment in front of one of the closets then sighed before opening it to take a glass.
“Acid Pops” he spoke, clearly.
“Oh come on Potter, just relax, it’s not like it’s really serious.”
Closing his eyes, he tried to calm down the beats that hit strongly against his chest and failed lamentably when he opened them, to stare at Malfoy’s teeth biting his lower lip.
Holding his breath, he looked for pictures of Ginny, but they did not come... Only Malfoy’s were dancing in front of him. Then, he took a deep breath and resumed his slow movements, imagining the fucking grey eyes that shone as he looked at him.
He had to calm down too… He shouldn’t have been so weak in front of Harry. Out of respect for him, for everything he stood for, he had to stay strong. Although he was never very brave, working with Harry, he had learned to make some effort.
“So what are you waiting for? Do it instead of saying nothing...” Malfoy dared him in a grin.
He had always thought that Blaise was trying to looks like him in order to take his place among their fellow men, wanting at all costs to crush him in order to form an image of a powerful prince that no one could dethrone.
Potter gave him a black gaze.
Malfoy gave him a haughty smile and looking down on him.
He seemed more relaxed, calmer and it was very destabilizing to see so much change in Malfoy’s behavior.
“What is it? What is it, Malfoy?” Harry shouted, releasing the pressure he had on his heart since the beginning of this conversation. “Obviously, you have feelings for me, but you can’t leave your fiancée because Mom and Dad won’t agree and it would sink the investment of your two families!” he added, drawing closer to Malfoy, who immediately became tense, “So I’m asking you,
“You… you get married?! But … how long have you been together? When did it happen?” he asked, stunned.
Harry froze but did not turn around. He closed his eyes and sighed.
Draco sighed while crushing the dried flesh of octopus in his terracotta bowl, hoping everything was going well.
“It’s already been an hour, I took the opportunity to go round the classrooms and find out where I was staying. Sorry, Ron, but the rooms are not mixed.”
“Fine. Just… be careful.”
“It’s okay Harry, you’ve been in a coma for two months and who knows how you got into this state…” Hermione replied, frowning as she pondered to find the answer to her mute question.
Malfoy still held his hips firmly, his fingers stuck in his skin. His breath was crashing against his shoulder and he was sweating from the orgasm that had passed through him a few seconds earlier too.
He heard Malfoy discuss plants and benefits with the store manager, who gave him some information about the products he sold.
“And why couldn’t you?”
“I don’t know what he took from you but you’re not in your normal state, you don’t know what you’re doing” Draco said.
"For Merlin's sake, Potter, can you stop showing off!" he hissed.
The urge to talk to him itched and he was constantly struggling with it, preventing it from getting the upper hand.
“The connection is that in addition to being pretty good at it, you also know some spells that, I remind you, you are supposed to be fighting against. Isn’t that totally ironic?” he grinned, the bitterness of his voice echoing directly into the chest of Harry who felt his breath block.
Harry froze, raised his eyebrows high, and then lowered them, his eyes moving from left to right seeming to be looking for something. Then, Draco saw him turn his head towards one of the trophies, at the top of the library and linger on for a moment.
"Shut up, Malfoy!" Harry hissed, pushing him to the back of the room.
The cold winter air blew in his face, drawing the lines of his skin every gust. However, neither the cold nor the snow that fell by large flakes would spoil this moment when he felt soothed and at the same time so energized.
“Oh… yes, I could have, that’s true, but since the war, I wanted to continue to do justice to those who didn’t survive, you know? And as much as I love Herbology, I can’t stand by while Death Eater are still running around…” Neville blew, staring at his feet.
“Then let’s go home quickly so you can rest” he said, reaching out his hand.
“How’s the team? You found a replacement seeker while I was not operational?”
Harry’s words resounded hard in his head, his hands resting on his thighs, squeezing a little more his black pants, sticking his nails into the garment.
Malfoy nodded.
Harry looked at him in silence as his words were circling in his head, unable to calm the anger and bitterness that was taking hold of him.
Harry loved him… This Harry was
“But he’s dead, isn’t he? He’s definitely dead?” Harry asked, whose breathing suddenly became more difficult to control as a dreadful doubt seized him.
Malfoy swallowed as he stared with fright. The muscles of his jaw were contracting at times when he seemed to be looking for a plausible answer to give him.
“Your compliments go right to my heart”
Harry would have thought he was going to persist as he promised. He had expected Malfoy to do worse or continue as he had begun.
Forgetting Ginny, forgetting Nott, Harry took a few steps and took Malfoy with him into the room, slamming the door in his back.
There was a pleasant little silence where none of them spoke. Ginny played with a lock of her beautiful hair while Harry let himself be hypnotized by this move. He already felt the tiredness regaining him and his eyes struggled to stay open.
“You don’t have to go on and you know it” Malfoy hissed.
The beats of his heart beat in his chest, imagining Ron’s disgusted look if he heard that he was banging Malfoy while he was dating his sister…
Harry was still smiling, his face a few inches from Malfoy’s face, which was frowning. He looked at his fine features and his light grey eyes, feeling his heart beating louder in his chest, the corners of his lips slowly lowering, as his gaze landed on Malfoy’s offered mouth under him.
He also had a terrible desire to cry with rage, because he did not understand how he felt. Worse still, he was visibly the only one to be under the influence of this strange emotion since Malfoy seemed perfectly calm and serene before him, chatting with enthusiasm, as a fire burned inside Harry, burning his entire body, pulling to the tip of his hair.
"You're not making me a bad joke, are you?" he asked, raising an eyebrow.
Harry could not prevent a thin smile from adorning his lips when he looked at Malfoy. The boredom could easily be read on the features of his face as he pretended to be focused on Kingsley’s speech. He blinked once and then, probably feeling watched, turned his head in his direction and raising his eyebrows.
Draco had repressed a wince, in front of the arrogant look of his former roommate.
Harry frowned and decided that from now on, he would do anything to avoid running into him.
Harry sneered, rolling his eyes.
“Fuck it…” he said, deciding to move on.
"Blaise! Did you know that Potter was gay?" he asked, immediately.
attention.
“I’m not afraid of you, Malfoy!” Harry replied, in a deep voice.
“Obviously, yeah...” nevertheless admitted Harry, shrugging his shoulders.
“Maybe it’s because their student isn’t always reporting everything to
