A smile crept over Harry's face despite himself. Draco was too smart, it was obnoxious really, and it shouldn't make him want to kiss Draco's smirking mouth.
"I know what she said." Draco's whole body was cringing in, now, back to the haunted figure Harry knew well. "But she didn't — she wasn't even a Death Eater, it was all distant and irrelevant until the day it was right in front of her, and she was terrified. I know she wishes she could take it back."
"Here, give me your hand," he said. Harry held out his left hand, bemused, but the man held it in a firm, warm grip with his right hand and picked up a biro to write a number on it with his left. He held on a little longer than was necessary; Harry was absolutely burning with embarrassment now.
Of course, not all of Draco's distraction this morning could be attributed to the fall of Slytherin.
"Tell you what," he said. "How about you just tell me what you think I might like to tell you, and I'll tell you if it's true."
Luna showed them to a cosy table in the back corner. Malfoy sank gratefully into one patchwork armchair, and Harry collapsed into the other.
Malfoy looked around at them with an almost awed expression, like he couldn't quite believe they would put themselves out on his account. Harry liked it, liked the way it made his mouth curve and his eyes catch the light of the gilt candelabras, turning silver into gold.
Harry's room was one of the smaller rooms in the house, although still expansive, with dark wood furniture and a four-poster bed. Harry hadn't made much of it besides putting his clothes in the wardrobe and spelling the textiles red; his Hogwarts trunk still sat at the foot of the bed, full of everything sentimental Harry had ever owned. It was tidy, thanks to Kreacher, and Harry saw it as Draco would. Painfully reminiscent of Hogwarts, and strangely devoid of evidence that it was
perfect, your hand posture is a little stiff —" Harry scowled, and Malfoy trailed off. "But honestly some people play the wrong note even on the very simplest scale, you've got excellent dexterity, you'll probably be a disgusting natural and I'll have to persuade Kreacher to trap your fingers in the oven door so you don't get better than me."
"Oh Malfoy, my dark hero," she said, dropping her broom and flinging herself melodramatically into his arms. He caught her, surprisingly deftly, and he looked surprised and a little pleased as she laughed at him. Then a funny look came over his face, and Ginny frowned.
Harry smiled awkwardly at the man, who gave him another reassuring grin before turning around to the three ladies and Hermione. He flourished his arm, looking down at his watch.
element, which Hermione hadn't mentioned. He didn't know a lot about churches — the Dursleys would sometimes slope off to one at Easter, or when Aunt Marge was down — but he was fairly certain they didn't like people like him. He wondered if John would mind if he knew he was dealing with an odd, slightly broken, possibly bisexual wizard.
He wished he could ask his dad. Ginny seemed to follow his thought process, because she looked uneasy, like she was trying to think of what to say.
Much to Harry's surprise, he didn't hear Malfoy make a dart for the door at the earliest opportunity that morning. He didn't hear anything from the top staircase at all until well past ten, and even then, Malfoy's step was unusually slow and heavy.
There was silence for a moment, as Harry concentrated on excavating forkfuls of spaghetti from his over-full bowl. Malfoy sucked in his pasta shapes one at a time, looking pained.
"That's a good sign," said Hermione. "He doesn't want to make himself look needy to you. He wants to be your equal. He could probably try to play to your pity and rinse you for cash or favours, like a good Slytherin, but he isn't. He's pushing you away, because he cares about the balance of your relationship."
Bill Weasley, with his sand-worn combats and white muslin shirts with no collar, his fang earring and his leather bracelets covered in cursebreaker amulets. And Sirius, particularly in pictures, a young Sirius in his leather jacket and punk studded collar, Sirius with his sleeveless shirts and turned-up jeans. And both of them in dragonhide boots, of course, like the ones Harry still wore — when he left the house, at least.
They rose from the kitchen table, Luna pulling him into a tight hug before turning to the kitchen fire. Ginny slipped behind her to hug him too, while Luna fumbled with the Floo powder.
Harry led Malfoy up the stairs; Malfoy followed quietly. At the first landing, he froze at the sounds of merriment in the drawing room, but Harry ignored it and led the winding way up to the third floor.
Except for one last place. One quiet afternoon, Harry found himself standing outside Sirius's room. He hadn't really made a decision to do it; he'd just drifted here, trance-like, and now he was on the threshold it seemed silly to hold back. He pushed the handle down, and let the door creak open under his palm.
"Have you seen the new roster for the Tutshill Tornados?" said Ginny to Ron, before Harry could get too uncomfortable at the compliment.
Harry blinked at her. Mornings were not his strong point; Ginny, however, had been training for two hours already.
It helped, but it didn't stop the more discerning owls from occasionally finding a way to get to him.
There was a moment where the silence hung thick. Harry found himself staring at the place where Dean's hand rested in Seamus's hair, suddenly still.
Janine presided over the meeting. There were ground rules, and introductions, and then a blonde woman in a designer blouse began the sharing circle by telling them, matter-of-factly, that she'd been to her abuser's funeral, and how she still didn't know how she felt about it. And then less matter-of-factly, that her husband had lost it and punched her complicit uncle, nearly knocking him into the grave, and that she'd laughed herself sick in the car on the way home. Elsie, beside her, snickered into her hand.
Harry grimaced at the memory of all those people who had never believed him. Who hadn't even entertained the possibility that Harry Potter was anything but fine. Draco caught the expression, turning his head to face Harry again.
Harry watched Draco's lips form the words and wished he could kiss them. Draco blinked at him for a second, then turned away again.
"Well, there's this potion based on Amortentia – it smells nice, like you did, and... never mind. I've always wanted to use it, and it seemed a bit more sensible than a deodorant that gets you suffocated by a dogpile of girls. Should have known you'd never use
"No," said Harry, exasperated, "I just like it that way sometimes. God, Malfoy, you are so annoying."

way to healing that. It's in very early experimental stages as a treatment for anything other than Cruciatus, but I happen to have heard from a reliable source that it has encouraging results when used to treat both addiction and traumatic memories."
"Don't say a word," she said, gesturing to the open bathroom door, and the sounds of Malfoy being sick.
, really, never two men, except that one time Ron got Neville when playing spin the bottle. But that hadn't been like this, that had been a peck with no passion behind it, not like Dean who was pulling Seamus close against him now —
She was obviously enjoying her studies at the Library, however, as she kept attempting to engage the household on the content of her various books, talking about the many benefits of Mind Healing at dinner and leaving copies prominently on the coffee table. After the thin layer of dust made it clear nobody was going to pick them up, the books vanished, and in their place were laid out a series of short, brightly coloured pamphlets.
"It's a nice idea for a tattoo," he said, shrugging one shoulder. "Far be it from me to get in the way of your strange impulses."
"Goyle went to prison with his father. Parkinson would have had enough to run off to the continent with the rest of them."
"Your loss," said Malfoy, smirking. His eyes were heated, and they sent pleasurable shivers down Harry's spine.
"Whatever," sneered Malfoy, turning his back to light a fire under their cauldron. "You're pathetic, Potter, drooling all over me like a puppy just 'cause I'm the first guy you snogged."
At the desk, all the letters and notes and scraps of paper he'd discarded in his quest for his mother's letter had been neatly arranged in drawers, roughly in date order. Harry felt his eyes prickle. Kreacher had been no fan of Sirius, but he must have taken the time to do this. He must have known that one day, Harry would want to be here.
He told Adhikari that he didn't want to go to Diagon Alley for Christmas shopping. Adhikari told him it was his choice. He told her he couldn't stand the idea of being mobbed by fans. Adhikari nodded, and told him he'd be ready one day.
feel something, but it was more like an abstract jealousy — of her freedom, of people having sex at all. Of this normal thing that Harry wasn't even entirely sure he wanted. He
"They should hire you," said Draco. "I'm not joking, Weasley, I'm pretty sure the only reason someone hasn't picked you up is that they haven't spotted you yet."
He took in the room beyond, blinking in surprise. He'd expected the place to look exactly as he'd seen it before — turned over, dusty, a mess — but it seemed that Kreacher held no fear of entering here. The dust was banished. The bed was neatly made. Gone were the magazines, papers and old correspondence that Harry had casually tossed about in his search for his mother's letter; the old clothes and shoes were back in the drawers, the trinkets and knick-knacks arranged neatly on the bookshelf.
"Call me whatever you like," he said, and it was obvious that Draco had intended for it to come out smooth and dismissive, but it didn't. It came out too fast, with too much air in it, breathy and quiet. His eyes widened, flicked to Harry's mouth, and they were much closer than they should be for a casual chat. Harry burned with the urge to just do it, to throw away all the reasons why it would be absolutely stupid and just kiss him, right here in the kitchen with Kreacher still fretting in the corner.
"Now, usually during the initial session I talk a little about what I can offer, the therapeutic and magical approaches I can take, and what you're looking to get out of our time together. This time, however, I'd like to start by acknowledging something very significant, which is that unlike most clients, I already have a great deal of knowledge of you. Doubtless some of that knowledge is based on faulty assumptions, or has been outright fabricated by the media, but I would be remiss in my professional duty if I did not acknowledge this. Furthermore, I am deeply honoured that you have chosen to embark on your therapeutic journey with me, a journey that must be very difficult for you to share and may touch upon globally significant events. I want you to know that I take the added responsibility very seriously."
He dragged himself up from the orchard, a few hours later, to find Dean stretched out alone on a blanket, sketching one of the sunflowers they'd planted. Neville's, naturally, was the best; nobody had figured out how, since they'd not caught him tending to it.
"Well, yes," said Harry, tilting his chin up to grin at Malfoy, whose eyes flicked away from his onions to look at Harry in a quicksilver flash. "But I was having a panic attack at the time, and you're not a
"There are many ways to care for a master," said Kreacher huffily, and Harry looked down at him, touched. "I is not thinking
"Now," said John, gesturing broadly. "You can expect a bit of hazing from the regulars, try to take it in your stride." He turned to the van, edging between Hermione and one of the ladies, and tugged a large box of clothes out from behind the soup station. "And if you hate it, we can always have you back at the church doing the cooking. Here you go."
"Do you remember in third year when I decided I was going to go full artist and rock a beret?" said Dean. They all snickered.
The fire whooshed, and Ron and Hermione both stumbled into the kitchen. For a moment, time hung like the cloud of soot in the air, Harry's eyes trying to drink in every inch of the sight of them here together, both the same and different; Ron somehow looking even
More seemed to lift off him as they spoke, one of those weights he only noticed when it was gone. He wasn't, in fact, a freak. He wasn't substantially more broken than anyone else would be, had they been through what he went through. He just had a few issues, and he would fix them bit by bit, just like he fixed Grimmauld Place.
. Hermione's at the library, Ron is at the Ministry all hours doing Auror training, and Neville's doing some sort of botanical study at Kew Gardens. Seamus is actually upstairs asleep, he works nights. Don't worry about disturbing him, though, he puts up one hell of a Silencing Charm. Which is fortunate for all of us," he added, with a smile to himself.
"Shift it, Potter," said Malfoy, and Harry did so awkwardly, feeling bare and unpleasantly sticky. Malfoy waved his wand over the mess and pulled his trousers up. Harry did up his jeans and leant against the desk behind him.
"Oh, take me now!" cried a third-year, and dived. Harry dodged and threw himself through the portrait hole. Hermione jumped, and slammed it behind them.
Neville raised an eyebrow at him, but gestured up the stairs; Malfoy nodded, and followed him out of the kitchen like a man condemned.
kid," admitted Harry, curling his hand around his necklace. Malfoy caught the movement, and his shoulders dropped.
thought Harry. It sounded like a dream. Except Harry had met one, and he hadn't seemed particularly happy, and even though flying was grand the idea of extra fame brought him only nausea.
"Oh, is that what this is about?" he said. "Alright, Potter, I'll take your guilt money in Muggle though, thanks. No wait, you're going to buy me some bloody disgusting sandwich, aren't you? Couldn't have me
"Alright, Potter, I've had enough of sitting here trying to ignore your lack of culture. Let me show you how to play the piano."
"I'm asking because I don't really know where I get my looks from. Or if it even matters. And I wondered if you knew. Or if you ever think about it." Harry flopped sideways and pressed his face into the grass. "Sorry, I'm not good at this, please can we forget I ever spoke?"
The walls were still plastered in posters, and Harry found himself reaching to touch them, eyes roaming the walls like exploring a treasure map. There were posters for Muggle films Harry didn't know, flyers for concerts — with an electric buzz, Harry noticed the address for one of them was in Camden — as well as adverts torn from Muggle magazines. Next to the wardrobe there was a black-and-white poster of a man in a leather jacket and turned-up jeans, sitting astride a motorbike with his hair slicked back and a cigarette dangling from his mouth.
He loitered uncomfortably as Draco sat Pansy, Harry lingering at his own chair at the head of the table, more in a display of loyalty than anything else. Draco gave him a funny look as they finally sat down.
"Let me guess – she laughed you out of the room?" said Hermione. Ron patted him consolingly on the shoulder.
Class was finishing as they arrived, and they watched the class pass them with shifty eyes. Pansy gave Harry a death glare.
Harry blinked the moment away, grinned at her, as though the whole thing were normal. He wished it could be normal.
"I think Kreacher is hinting that you should say a polite goodbye," said Seamus, snatching the last piece of pizza off Harry's plate and winking at Kreacher. "Off you trot."
"Come on," said Ron seriously. "We ought to go and introduce ourselves. I can't even remember any of their names."
"Come on," said Harry, and Malfoy trudged up the staircase to his room. Harry thought Malfoy might appreciate the room, given the Slytherin green colour scheme, but he didn't seem to see it as he made straight for the bed; Harry moved the towels he'd laid out for him out of the way and let him collapse face-down onto the bedspread.
Harry growled and pushed Draco back against the opposite wall. Draco grabbed fistfuls of Harry's robe again, trying to force him away, but Harry resisted, pinning Draco down.
Harry watched him a little longer, twisting his necklace, feeling the unhappy feelings ease their way out of his body.
" said Harry dejectedly. The common room, previously in various stages of deep inhalation and predatory crouching, returned to normal.
"Can I see it?" said Malfoy quietly, nodding at Harry's arm. Harry held it up. Malfoy lifted Harry's wrist and drew it gently towards his face.
Eventually, they unearthed the edges of the overgrown lawn, flagstones and statues scattered across the space like islands in a sea of long, brown grass. Harry mowed it back with the shed's rusty scythe, and Kreacher vowed to maintain the lawn with an unsettling fanaticism.
Harry watched as an extra cup materialised discreetly; Luna poured herself a cup and sat cross-legged beside the coffee table to drink it, smiling at them both. Harry was just about to ask her how her day's adventuring went when they were interrupted by the tell-tale sound of Ginny running up the stairs.
Harry didn't hate her. She was entertaining, actually. She reminded him of a posh Ginny, sharp and a bit mean and a bit fun.
"Some time between five and six, I imagine. We'll have dinner at seven. You know, if you want some."
For a long moment, Harry stayed there, near enough to feel Malfoy's warm breath on his cheek. Then Malfoy exhaled sharply and looked away.
There was a small cauldron in one corner of the kitchen, with a Notice-Me-Not and a few nasty hexes attached for any non-householders. It held their so-called housekeeping fund. Out of stubborn determination to contribute, people kept giving the pot unreasonable amounts, and out of stubbornness Harry refused to spend any of it. He hadn't told anyone, but he thought he might distribute it when people left, so they'd each have a little bit to start their lives with once they were done here.
Harry snorted, but he slid between Draco's legs again, one hand on the side of Draco's head as he slicked up his cock with the other. Draco's smirk fell away.
Malfoy ate each pancake slowly; it seemed to be an effort, and Harry decided Malfoy would need something stronger than tea to get him through the day. He fished the cafetière out of the sink.
"Yeah," said Harry, turning back to his book, staring at it in the hope it would somehow grab his attention off Malfoy. He was still staring, unseeing, when he heard the front door slam.
"I don't think we should try to pick up where we left off," she said, voice clear, and firm, and a little too fast. Harry, much to his surprise, felt his body flood with relief.
"You and your service kink, Potter, honestly," he said, grabbing Harry's hand. His fingers felt thin and cold in Harry's grip.
"Malfoy.” Harry took a step forward into Malfoy’s space, watching his silver eyes go wide. Malfoy was taller, but he didn't look it now. "There is a difference between thinking and doing
Harry wasn't even sure what he believed now. What he'd seen at the Other King's Cross, with Dumbledore, when he died — was it even real? Were the people he'd seen in the Stone even real?
"I do wonder what would have happened if it had been heads," he said, staring up at the archway of leaves and branches above them. Draco's Warming Charm pulsed, warm and familiar around him.
. And people hate you for it, some people hate that we all have to be your best friends or get branded as a Death Eater! So it doesn't matter what you say,
kind, the kind that made Malfoy's face heat. There was probably something horribly wrong with him, that he got such a kick out of it.
Harry woke early, despite the hangover he knew most of the rest of the house would be sleeping off. After a few minutes attempting to get back to sleep, he gave up and worked in the garden for most of the morning, the better to control his impulse to keep listening out for the creak of the attic stairs.
Harry didn't know why she'd called it now, but she was looking at him. He looked down to see that the knuckles of his right hand were white around his fork, his left palm pressed against his necklace in a subconscious gesture. He took a deep breath, letting his hands drop.
"’Rains!" he repeated, and Harry followed him upstairs to the chunky children's train set, laughing at Teddy's little face lighting up when Harry sat on the floor and began to drive a train around the track.
Harry looked at her, then over at Ron, lounging on a beanbag and smiling gently at them both. He wondered what they would do if they weren't worried about him. Whether they would have moved out, found their own place. Started talking about the big things — children, marriage, a family together.
It was fortunate that his first session with a Mind Healer was later the same week. He drafted ten owls to cancel the session, only to close his eyes and see Teddy's face. He wanted to be better. He
The weather turned dark and icy, so Harry couldn't walk as much as he used to. He listened to the records they'd bought in Camden on a loop, regret dragging on him with every bittersweet note. He cleaned everything in the house. He sat in the drawing room every evening, resting against the reassuring warmth of Hermione or Ginny or Ron, saying little. In the daytime, when everyone was out, he wandered the city, or went to the church to help with the soup run, mindlessly chopping vegetables until his fingers went wrinkly.
He looked tired, hollow. Three or four weeks of peacetime had taken the sickly pallor from his face, the one he'd had since sixth year, but it still looked as though he hadn't slept in a long time. Despite that, Malfoy had changed since Harry had last looked at him properly; his face was more angular than pointed nowadays, bold lines and dark shadows in the light of his lamp, and he had long, elegant hands that flicked over the pages too quickly for him to be really reading. The gold lamp threw flickering splashes of gold into his silver hair and shadowed eyes, making him look warmer, softer, more approachable. He was really quite...
"Ah, Harry," called Seamus from the doorway. "I was hoping to pick your brains about my birthday party. Are you
"Brilliant," said Shev. "I'm glad. It'd take some colour on the leaves nicely, if you ever fancied it, but you'll have to book next time."
"Right," said Fish, grinning and slipping the notes into his pocket. "I know where he's probably sleeping, mostly cos I told him it's a good spot. I've passed out there many a time when I was in a pinch. He might have gone somewhere else, depends how full the hostels are and if he'd rather chance it outside, but the weather's pretty good so I reckon he'll be there. It's a little alley not far from here on Guild Street, in between an old greengrocer and a greasy spoon."
"Are you joking?" Harry let out a dark laugh. "Mostly, I was a kid with no sense of my own mortality, and I had help at every turn. And even so, I'm only
Harry broke himself out of his trance to look at Neville and Luna, sitting comfortably together on the sofa and smiling at the scene, then Ron and Hermione, who were both pulling the face they pulled when they were expecting Harry to be weird about something.
Draco's eyes flicked briefly to Harry; Harry felt like his whole body ceased to exist, frozen in space.
"I only have eyes for you," crooned Seamus, yanking Dean down into a kiss which unbalanced them both, knocking the pair of them into a prone position amongst the piles of plastic packaging.
that help — professional or any other kind — was not a bad thing. That even if he felt completely fine, it wouldn't hurt to ask for it. But some part of him slipped away at the thought, left a void in his chest at the horror of ever seeking help, ever being a burden.
Adhikari herself turned out to be a slim, brown-skinned woman with a glossy bun and a manner reminiscent of Professor McGonagall, although she was much younger. She was wearing a long-sleeved blouse and jeans, which somehow failed to take away from the severity of her manner.
It was also, Ron had told him, very illegal, and required special dispensation to do it as an Auror. Harry, stomping his way down the stairs, wondered if this were one of the benefits of being an Unspeakable.
"Blaise!" said Malfoy, hopping down the last few steps and diving in for a hug. Harry, used to seeing a lot more in the way of fancy manners and reservation between Slytherins, was both surprised and irrationally annoyed.
"You may be right, Weasley," said Malfoy haughtily, giving Ginny a smirk, but Harry could see two spots of colour high on his cheeks.
"God, you sound just like mum," Ron teased, and the conversation moved on from Malfoy to who would take the now-vacant Seeker position. Harry was only half-listening, eating his stew unusually slowly, turning over the strange reality of Malfoy in his mind.
Then at half past seven, Hermione dragged him out to volunteer. Harry's stomach lurched as he stepped past the wards, but the cool September air rushed into him and it was alright, it was
Harry stepped back against the bannister, chest clenching. He wanted to go inside, wanted to watch Malfoy's musical discovery again. A horrible feeling kept him in the corridor, fear and knowledge that Malfoy would give him a dark look, Harry's presence in these moments not welcome.
Draco's hands tightened in Harry's robe and he snarled, mouth opening, and the parted lips almost felt like invitation - enough that Harry tilted his head, moving the press of mouths to something more like a kiss, and with something like inevitability Draco responded, pulling Harry tighter, thrusting his tongue into Harry's mouth with the force of his fear and hatred behind it. Harry whimpered, surrendering as Draco moved him against the wall again and bit, grinding his hips, wrestling Harry though he was putting up no fight.
"Positively tranquil," he said, dry, and looked surprised and maybe even slightly pleased when the whole table snickered at this — barring Neville, who was still watching Malfoy with a faint air of suspicion.
Malfoy turned and stormed away. Harry wanted to yell that he wouldn't want to anyway, but for some reason the words wouldn't come.
something? Had he got so deep into lying that he never knew when the truth would have been so much better?
"Oh, no," he said, not knowing why he was disappointed. Of course you needed appointments to get things permanently inked on your body, that was normal, and Harry wasn't going to actually
Adhikari's office was a long, narrow room on the ground floor. One end was dominated by a large desk, the walls around it crammed with bookcases, each one stacked with books and binders up to the ceiling. Harry had a momentary vision of Hermione dashing over to inspect them and smiled.
it, living in a Muggle house and working a Muggle job and having almost entirely Muggle friends and acquaintances, but
Christmas at the Burrow was loud and busy and a little too much, and Harry found himself resisting the urge to clutch the necklace. They all laughed a little too long, covering up the gap Fred left, and then when Ron and Hermione got up to leave the atmosphere was tense — Ron's face pinched, Hermione looking torn between guilt and frustration. Harry drank to numb himself to the noise and went to sit on the step outside, watching the fairy lights dance over the frosty grass.
"Alright," said Harry, grinning, and now he had more than enough motivation to attempt what had been on his mind when he pushed Malfoy to the wall. He slid to his knees.
Dean was dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt, stretched out long and lean across the grass. The t-shirt looked good against his dark skin. Harry crossed the garden to sit next to him, his mind churning over questions he didn't know if he should ask.
"Idiot's probably got bored and gone for a jaunt by now," said Ron, which was annoyingly perceptive.
"It was him," insisted Hermione. "I'd know him anywhere, and besides, he took one look at me and ran for it."
He knew people were watching. He tried not to hear the whispers in the queues, tried not to see the glazed eyes and scarlet faces of the shop assistants. But people were coalescing into a crowd as he left the last shop. One girl at the front, no older than twelve, was pushed forward by a gaggle of giggling friends; he slid the sunglasses down his face to look at her. Suddenly, after all the fear and frustration he'd felt, he found it easy to smile at her.
"The '93 final was an absolute crime," interjected Malfoy. "The referee was crooked, I'm convinced of it, that's the only way he wouldn't call foul on Drummond —"
everyone moves out. Not that I want them to. I mean, I'd be pretty happy if it was like this forever."
Andromeda levitated a tea service down onto the coffee table and folded herself comfortably into the armchair opposite Harry, smiling as she looked between them.
"I hope not — the things you've always said —" Pansy's voice sounded younger, almost tearful. Draco looked at her, face softening.
"Well, I'm happy you had someone else to talk to about it, and I am happy to pass on the information to whomever you'd like, if you'd prefer not to do it yourself," she said.
"It's a lot," agreed Harry, sliding down to the spot next to him. "I can't imagine what it's like sober. Well, I can, given that I haven't had one since you turned up."
With a startling crack, Kreacher appeared at his elbow. He was positively vibrating, his skinny mouth stretched in a manic grin.
"Or you could come stay with me for a bit," said Harry, and Malfoy promptly spluttered the coffee all over his sleeping bag.
Shev turned to set up her pen for a moment; Harry leaned around her to watch as she assembled the gun with nimble fingers, dropped a little ink into a pot, and carefully dipped the needle in. Then she turned, grinned at him, pressed his hand down into the arm rest and brought the tattoo gun to his skin. Harry breathed out sharply.
Harry followed Ron down to the great hall with extreme nervousness. Ginny waved, but Harry's eyes went straight to the Slytherin table; Malfoy was there, looking troubled and pale, and Harry almost missed the loud obnoxious boy that used to hold court there. Pansy was at his elbow, as she so often was, and although she was talking loudly and brashly at a younger Slytherin boy she looked almost as pale and tired. She was facing away from Draco, and Draco stared ahead without paying the slightest bit of attention, but Harry could see their hands tightly entwined between them.
," he said. "Blaise took me clubbing a few times but it was quite different. All shiny lights and decadence, I'm sure you can imagine."
Harry nodded, taking the instructions and shoving them into his back pocket. He felt soft, strangely out-of-body. He got up, smiling and thanking them both again, more than was necessary he suspected, and then he stood outside the shop, blinking at the sunlight.
Except Harry couldn't imagine asking any other ex-Death-Eater to live with him. He wasn't entirely sure what that meant.
"Can't be," said Harry. "Last I heard Narcissa Malfoy had taken what was left of the Malfoy estate and upped sticks to France. Andromeda got a letter from them."
"You don't have to try very hard to be that, Weasley," said Seamus. Harry watched Ginny's blush with a strange, detached sort of envy.
invite him," said Ginny, who was sitting on the table facing Luna's chair, one calf pressed against Luna's thigh. "He's going to be in the house anyway. It'd be rude."
Hermione huffed against Harry's side, as if she were offended by this. Pansy's eyes flicked briefly to Ginny, but then she waved a hand at Draco.
"I paid his mate to tell me," said Harry. "If he's spinning a Machiavellian plot through withdrawal symptoms and the complete collapse of his life, he's smarter than I gave him credit for."
"Hi," said Harry, and then he was enveloped in the warmth of Hermione's hug, too-tight. He turned to bury his face in her soft hair, her familiar smell.
"Harry," interrupted Hermione. "That wasn't quite what I meant, and aren't you forgetting something important?"
Harry was frustrated. Why hadn't Malfoy said any of this? Harry was sure they could have fixed the paperwork situation between them, and Dean would know all about Muggle jobs for Draco since he looked in the paper so often…
His hair was bright blue today. His chubby limbs were bigger, less baby-like than Harry remembered, and Harry realised it had been far too many months this time.
"Snape always said you were too stupid for wordless magic," said Malfoy, staring at the wand with open envy. Harry snorted.
Ellie looked at his birth date for a long time, and Harry felt a rush of disappointment again. He didn't have any ID, but Ellie obviously deemed him of age, because she waved him back behind the screen. The shop beyond was narrow but well-lit, and his tattoo artist perched on a rolling chair beside a bench like the kind he remembered from the doctors as a child. Behind her, on another bench, a large man was gritting his teeth as an even larger man used a strange, buzzing machine on him. Everything smelled faintly of disinfectant. Harry caught the large man's eye and had his first moment of personal misgiving.
"Madame Malkin's does," said Neville, who was a little red in the face from his attempt to prevent himself from laughing. "But you'll have a hard time buying Muggle clothes there. She's trying but they're just a bit
"Some of these must have been bought by Regulus, Harry, not Sirius," said Hermione, who was surprisingly enchanted by the record collection. "This one is from 1977, wouldn't Sirius have left by then?"
The group left haphazardly after dinner, Ginny and Ron arguing up the stairs about whether Mbene would make it to the World Cup, Luna following behind. Hermione stopped longer to pick a fight with Kreacher over the washing up, which Harry ended by getting up and starting it himself, throwing suds at Hermione when she tried to argue. Neville stayed, having given himself a second helping of stew, and Malfoy stayed too, still picking over his first one and shooting Neville furtive looks.
He stared at the empty space for a long moment. Then he pulled open one of the desk drawers to look for a pen; there was a self-inking quill at the very top of the drawer, resting innocently on the papers below it. Harry gave the walls a suspicious glance and picked it up. He was fairly certain it was one of his, from his desk downstairs.
"That I deserve to suffer for it, for the rest of my life," whispered Malfoy eventually. Neville's arm, still preventing Malfoy's escape, slowly dropped.
"Oi!" said Harry, but they did not hear him. Harry rolled his eyes and waited for the corridor to clear.
Without thinking about it too much, he took up the quill and signed his name on the blank space. For a moment, the black ink glistened on the surface of the parchment, but then it sank into the fibres, and it felt for a moment as though the whole house shivered around him.
"I — yes," admitted Malfoy. "I was — I can't justify it, I wish I could, I really did want to hurt him more than anything else in the world in that moment, I know I can't make excuses for that but maybe I could explain — "
Malfoy's lips parted, eyes going wide and soft under Harry. Harry stared back, every muscle tensed in a paralysis of want. He couldn't, he
"Mr Malfoy, twenty points! If you have a problem with keeping your arguments out of my hearing, kindly remove yourself from my sight."
Harry watched the others pack up the van with adrenaline thrumming in his veins. The cold night air stung sharp and heavy in his chest. John clapped him on the shoulder, and Harry jumped; John gave him an apologetic look, and folded his hands carefully behind his back.
Best of all, she was happy to fetch the shopping. The front door of Grimmauld Place loomed large, nowadays, a solid barrier against an unwelcome tide.
"Who doesn't?" said Dean bitterly, then he sighed and set down his pencil. "Yeah, sorry. Hermione's great, honestly, nothing against her, not trashing your best friend or anything. Especially since she's a literal genius who did save the world."
"Thanks," said Harry, snatching it back. He didn't like the look on Draco's face, fear and hate and resentment tightening his sharp features.
Draco," said Pansy, expression softening as she looked back to him. "Write to me, won't you, when you know the result of the hearing?"
"This is wild," said Ginny, yanking the ladle out of Seamus's unwilling grip. "Draco Malfoy, drug addict. How did that even
"It's deodorant," said Dean. "It just smells nice. Well, I think it smells awful but some people like it."
Though Harry still felt twitchy and frustrated with himself, the conversation flowed past his involuntary hostility. Malfoy seemed to be on form, trying to prove something — he was all smooth manners and plummy anecdotes about the Slytherin common room or his nights out with Blaise, play-acting the rich cad. Everyone seemed to find it hilarious, and Harry realised with a deep self-disgust that he was
"If I find out that you are being anything but an absolute delight to Harry, I will personally hex you with the curse of a thousand papercuts."
"Yeah, good job," said Ginny dryly, with a fragile smile at Dean. Something silent went between them — an apology maybe, Harry wasn't sure — but before the silence could get too awkward, Ginny tossed her head.
The steady rhythm of plunging his fork into a weed-riddled bed kept his hands occupied and his mind quiet. Kreacher brought him sandwiches and lemonade for lunch, and Harry ate them reclined on one of the stone benches in the shade of the apple trees. Even now the trees were heavy with fruit, although Neville had assured him they would not be ripe for another few months. Harry enjoyed watching the branches sagging a little lower each week, enjoyed the fantasy of biting into the first ripe apple of the season. Of borrowing Molly Weasley's apple crumble recipe, and cooking it for the house.
Harry let Draco drag him forward, watched him saunter ahead with his finger still hooked in Harry's robe. He
"I actually can't think of a reason why not. I mean, there's no weird revenge ritual or humiliation you could put me through that would scratch the surface at this point. I'm not even entirely sure I can feel
Harry raised his eyebrows. Malfoy didn't say anything else; didn't react at all. He looked exactly as awful as Hermione had said. He was starkly skinny, pale skin looking paper-thin and eyes red-rimmed. A yellow bruise ran across one cheekbone, and Harry thought he could see the ghost of another mark on his neck. He was visibly shivering in his too-big coat, despite the warm summer night, and his hair was long and limp over his eyes.
Dean glanced at Luna, as though seeking back-up, but Luna was contemplating her fingernails. She looked up after a moment, surprised that attention was now on her.
Harry's eyes prickled. It felt like too much, too much to bear — but then again, for the past few years he'd not been able to bear it at all, not been able to think about it, pushed it far away from him, into the outside world. So maybe feeling what he felt now was good.
Harry tried to watch how Ron and Hermione touched, trying to learn the difference by observation alone, but they were not like the others. Ron touched Hermione easily, but gently, like she was something precious; like a butterfly that had chosen to land on him and might float away at any second. Hermione, reserved as she was, would typically wait until she thought they were alone to lean into him, to curl up against him, to kiss him in the kitchen in the sliver of sunlight from the basement window while the kettle whistled to itself on the stove.
"And he can't use while he's here," said Hermione. "He'll have to agree to be tested. I think there's a spell I can learn."
"So, what brings you through my Floo?" he said, resting against the kitchen table, unable to believe the ease with which he referred to Grimmauld as
Harry rolled over on his stomach and propped himself up on his elbows to stare down at Draco's perfect face. He was so close, his elbow against Draco's ribs, warm through the thin t-shirt. Draco looked up at him, eyes shuttered, mouth tense.
"I bet Great Auntie Walburga is turning in her grave," Malfoy declared, pulling his gaze away. "Den of filth and iniquity, how
Seamus raised an eyebrow at Harry, apparently picking up on the subtext as well, and then broke the tension by suggesting a game of Go Fish. Malfoy, to Harry's surprise, tentatively agreed, and it was painfully awkward at first, the long silences and careful politeness saved only by the background music and Seamus's occasional humming along.
Harry tamped down his hot flare of anger. He had the feeling that this would be the least of the story, and there would be time to murder Spider later.
Harry closed his eyes and tried to think of someone naked in his bed. He'd barely seen anyone naked — Ginny, once, pure and pale, arching up against his shaking palm — but it felt wrong to think of her now. He thought of the people in the dirty wizard mag they'd passed around the dorm, girls with fake smiles and the men not smiling at all, and they all had figures like Oliver Wood but oily. They didn't make him
"I'm sure it will," said Hermione, not sounding sure at all. "If not, you'll just have to hide in your dorm until Ron writes to George. We'll tell everyone you're sick."
"Don't, Potter, I can't bear the pity.” Malfoy pulled himself up straighter, voice turning clipped. "Afterwards, when he finally seemed to realise what he was doing and stopped, I knew that I had to leave. I may have hated myself, but I didn't want to
Harry needed to be in company, supervised, before he did something stupid. He jumped up, reaching past Draco for the drawing room door handle, but Draco was kind of in the way, and Harry's lunge was ill-judged, so the two of them ended up almost chest-to-chest. He let out a sharp breath.
"BOYS!" said Slughorn. "Really, this is not the playground! If you carry on like that I'll be forced to send you out of the classroom!"
Malfoy's hand, cold and shaking, wrapped around Harry's and lifted it, pressing Harry's palm into his own chest. Harry's skin found the necklace, felt the cool rush of the Calming Charm break over him, focusing on the feeling of the glass under his fingers. It wasn't enough to stop his laboured breathing, but then Malfoy was there in front of him, crossing his legs on the pavement in front of Harry, cutting into the flow of foot traffic like a rock in a river. Harry heaved another breath.
"Want to know where I've been today?" he prompted, shoulders taut and tone more hostile than Harry could account for, given that he hadn't asked.
"Frankly, Harry, of course I do. As would anyone else who's lived with you for this amount of time, given how you've reacted to other suggestions that you might want a little help." Harry scowled at the kitchen table rather than meet Ginny's eye, even though he knew it would do nothing to refute her point. "Grace is my Mind Healer and she's actually really good for me, and so is this group, so far. I wish you'd consider it. I'd be there to, you know, help get you through the door."
testify to the Wizengamot and keep me out of Azkaban. But if for some reason they felt like they owed a little
"I hope you're going to be careful," she said, dumping the pile in his lap, and went upstairs to find Ron.
"It might not be forever," she said. "Malfoy gets his wand back soon. He might even get it back early — he has a review hearing in a few weeks, now he's got a
A stray firework, late to the party, pulled them both out of their sleep a few hours later. Draco shot up, peeling Harry's arm from his bare chest with a wince. Harry rolled over to look at his bedside clock; it read three in the morning.
To emphasise the point, he flipped the pan. He'd really got the hang of making perfectly fine and even crêpes, every time. Malfoy watched him showing off in silence, without comment or mockery.
Malfoy took up a position laying on the sofa with his back to the door. Harry could only see his feet, bare and pale, propped up on the bee cushion.
, too good, and he was going to come any minute with that perfect hand wrapped around him and Malfoy's mouth on his and the long, lean heat of the body against him –
"Naturally," said Malfoy, but then he made them all piña coladas covered in whipped cream, with big pink umbrellas he forced Ron to conjure out of cocktail sticks. Somehow, he managed to make the drinks sparkle.
know about this. Not because he'd disapprove or anything, but because if he ever gets embroiled in an Auror internal investigation — even as a witness — he could be given Veritaserum and spill all sorts of secrets. The interrogator only has to word a question badly and that's it, every illegal thing he's ever witnessed might come out of his mouth. It could ruin his career. There's already a lot of things he's had to disclose to even be considered for the role, I don't think they'll take it lightly if anything else comes out."
"Why wouldn't it?" said Hermione, laughing. "Here." She extended the arms of his shirt with a twist of her wand.
He held the bag out to Harry. Harry took it, peering inside; on top of a stack of CD cases sat a round, silver plastic CD player. Every available inch of plastic was absolutely covered in tiny runes, drawn on in black felt tip.
A man with a vast mohawk bumped into them, and Harry was jolted out of his trance. He caught Malfoy's arm.
Pushing the thought out of his head, he put on his leather jacket, cast a Warming Charm over his hands, and headed outside.
, she mouthed, gesturing down the stairs. She waited until they were on the first floor before turning on him.
"You're very clever, Teddy," said Harry. Teddy looked at him, nodded, and curled back into his chest.
"Come on," said Harry, reaching forward and pulling him by the arm, hoping action would smooth over what words could not. "I want to see what's in the next shop."
"Very little is permanent," said Adhikari, and Harry glanced down at his tattoo with another smile. "But I must tell you, recovery may not look exactly like you expect. You may not become exactly who you were. But I feel confident that you can become someone you are happy and proud to be."
Harry sipped his mystery drink. It was nice, really, to see everyone. Nice to remember he'd been part of a wider whole at school, that there were people he knew and liked in the world outside the walls of Grimmauld. He was just beginning to unwind when Malfoy walked in.
Malfoy was looking curiously at everything, taking in the small details: the stack of junk mail piled incongruously on the otherwise-tidy side table, the coat stand covered in brightly coloured jackets, the picture-hook evidence of removed paintings Harry hadn't yet replaced on the walls, the shadowy curtains hiding Mrs Black.
Hermione had a mercenary streak, but it had been a while since he'd heard anything like that from her.
"And I just wonder," said Dean. "How things might have gone if I'd not left him to his shitty friends and his shitty life."
"Come on," he said, and Harry let himself be dragged back into the warren of market stalls, wondering if Malfoy found it as disorienting as Harry did. They spent less time poking around at every stall this time, although Malfoy lingered over a dragon-shaped incense burner, and Harry, on impulse, bought a tank top with 'party like it's 1999' written in neon letters.
"Alright," said Harry. He put his thumb on the C key. "I trust you." He played the scale. Malfoy's expression bloomed into a smile that took all the wind out of Harry's chest.
can do that sort of thing. With you there, at least, because if you're behind me there's a chance they'll overlook the whole ex-Death Eater thing. And Pansy wants to start in PR but she's only got piddling clients in Paris at the moment and anyone with any knowledge of international affairs won't touch her — she'd work for free if it meant your name on the books. Fundraising, awareness campaigns, all that sort of thing. It could work, Harry — you could make something amazing here."
, one of which was somewhat reassuring and informative and one of which must have been in the Hogwarts Library for more than 50 years.
Harry took a deep breath. It was true: his mouth still felt unpleasantly tingly, but the rest of him felt quite good, actually.
want to watch an alcoholic drink himself stupid with the money Harry'd just given him. He thought of Sirius, lying on the sofa at Grimmauld, blackout drunk. He wondered what had pushed Fish to that point — whether he drank to keep something bad out, like Sirius had. He seemed so chipper, but Harry knew how easy it was to pretend everything was fine. His chest ached.
"Valentina, I love your dress," said Janine, and dashed over to give them both a kiss on the cheek. Harry watched her go, and started when Ginny handed him a cup of tea.
"I don't like it," he said eventually, and his voice cracked. "I feel drunk and I don't like it. Fuck, is this me now? Unable to drink like a normal person?"
He caught Harry's eye. Harry looked away, focused on his forkful of potato with a scowl, and forced himself to keep his eyes down for the rest of dinner.
Harry came down on Saturday to find Hermione and Malfoy huddled in one corner of the drawing room, talking low and fast. The floor around them was scattered with papers and books; Harry had to duck as Hermione Summoned another from her room without looking.
"Makes sense," said Malfoy, which wasn't what he was expecting. Ron would have told him that people loved him, Hermione would have given him a gentle lecture on facing his fears, and none of it would have helped.
" he murmured, with an elegant swish over his lower body. "Cleaning Ccharm. I'd do it wandless, but you should really know the full cast. And
"Alright," said Harry, raising his hands. "It wasn't an insult. You're allowed to enjoy nice things."
"Now," said Draco, giving Harry an assessing look. "First of all, posture. Hands out, let's see. Try not to slouch. Align your elbows, up a bit, yes. Feet near the pedals, but not on them, you won't be using them today."
Harry continued to stare, at a loss. They'd kissed, and now he was off to work for Voldemort, and wasn't there some rule against this sort of thing? An agent of the Dark Lord and the one Chosen to defeat him?
him but Malfoy knotted a hand in his shirt and pulled him forward. Then Malfoy's whole body was hot against his, and his erection was pressed against – oh God, it
"I wish I'd known them," said Draco quietly. His finger was resting over the hole where Andromeda used to be. "The ones behind the burn marks, I mean. Sometimes, I wonder… if I'd known them, maybe things would have turned out differently."
He stared at the carving for a long time. It was always with him, the knowledge that he was living in Sirius's ancestral home, but it struck him now that it must have been a strange feeling to have your antecedents looking over your shoulder at every moment of your life. Sirius's childhood world was steeped in layers of family tradition. He would have known his history back to ancient times, seen portraits of his great-great-great-grandfather, known exactly the winding path of joys and sorrows that led to his existence. Harry didn't know what that was like. Was it always bad? Was it always oppressive? Or would his mother and father's traditions have given him comfort? He would never know.
At the other end, beside the window, two plump grey armchairs faced each other around a coffee table, surrounded by modern, casually stacked half-shelves of yet more books. There was a spider plant cascading over the top of one, strange glittering objects decorating the others. There was something that looked a lot like a pensieve on one shelf.
"Anyway, he moved in with Spider, and Spider deals pretty much anything he can get his hands on, so I s'pose it was only a matter of time before Draco took
me and Hermione sleep in separate rooms. I mean, it's ridiculous at this point, we're both eighteen and serious and they've known her for years. Do they think we're going to get up to anything in the comfort of a bedroom that we couldn't have done in a tent?"
"That won't be necessary.” Harry could hear the tone of suppressed amusement in Hermione’s voice. "And Malfoy?"
"You can't grow flowers on poisoned ground," muttered Malfoy, and turned his face away from the drawing, startled when he noticed this brought him closer to Harry.
"It's going to be very strange, being in a different year," said Hermione. "I mean, I've not really spoken to Ginny's friends before, and now I'm sharing a dorm room with them. It's like first year all over again. You don't know any of the seventh year boys very well, do you?"
Dean pulled the sympathetic face that alerted Harry to the fact he'd said something incredibly depressing about the Dursleys again. He forgot, sometimes, the extent to which their treatment of him had not been
"Well, George has got a muggle telly in his flat," said Ron. "And we were watching it and this brilliant advert came on where the guy sprayed this special stuff on himself and it made girls throw themselves at him, and George told me he'd get me some if I gave him twenty galleons. And the best thing is, it's muggle so it's not prohibited!"
"I called in some favours," said Fish, "And I got my mate to let us kip on his floor. I had nothing better to do than sit with him while he gets himself together. But my mate's in sheltered housing and he can't get caught with guests, and in any case he's right pissed off with both of us after a few days, so he kicks us out. So I point Dray in the direction of the soup run and a couple of charities what aren't too much trouble, and I was gonna hang out and look after him a bit longer but he got a bee in his bonnet about me drinking too much, we got into a barney, and I haven't seen him since."
"Yeah. Rehab. State-sponsored, made the mistake of getting sauced up and calling a policeman a wanker one too many times. Dunno though, maybe this is the time, right?"
Strolling past decorated houses and families inside watching Christmas telly, Harry was surprised to note that he didn't feel that grey, desperate unhappiness he used to feel, alone with his thoughts. It was Christmas Eve, the cold clear air was crisp and bracing, and there were people who would be glad to see him at the end of his stroll. Nothing was perfect, but all was perfectly well.
Harry laughed like he understood the joke, and handed over the rest of his Muggle money for the albums.
"Music," said Harry. "Usually when I have a Bad Day I listen to something terribly depressing and it makes me feel… weirdly better."
"We broke up because Ginny wasn't ready to get serious, that's all," said Harry. "And I don't know if she'll be ready in the next decade… if ever. She's got things she wants, and I don't think I feature anymore."
"How kind of you to offer, Harry," said Blaise blandly, as though she hadn't noticed. "Perhaps some tea."
"I don't think that'll be necessary," said Harry dryly. Shev looked like she wanted to say something teasing in response, but professionalism got the better of her. She nodded at the bench.
Before Harry even had a chance to move, Malfoy had slid elegantly behind the beer pong audience. Harry followed, nudging Ron in the back as he went. Ron looked around, flinging glitter as he did so; his eyes widened at the sight of Malfoy at the punch bowl, ladle in hand.
"I know Blaise Zabini can't have anything to do with him any more," said Hermione. Harry and Ron both raised their eyebrows at her.
Harry decided to return to Hogwarts after the war for his seventh year. So did Hermione, which was not surprising, and Ron, because he couldn't bear to be away from Hermione.
And with that, he traced his tongue over the head of Malfoy's cock. Malfoy exhaled sharply. Harry grinned, and put a hand on his hip, steadying himself as he wrapped one hand around Draco and ran his tongue in a circle over the rosy flesh in front of him. Contrary to what Ron liked to believe, he had received this before, and while his eyes were closed it had been too gentle, but... good.
"Alright," said Harry. "If it's the principle of the thing." He reached out and drew a fifty pence out of the pile. "I'll buy myself a Mars Bar on you."
"Well, mostly by encouraging people to engage with local services," he said. "There's a stack of leaflets in the back — if you're serious about this, I'd recommend you take some home and read about what each one offers and to which people. People won't or sometimes
like to apply to the Aurors after all. But it all seemed either impossible or undesirable, and it made him want to sleep.
"Bad habit from a bad Muggle," said Draco darkly, and for a moment Blaise dropped her bland reserve to look intrigued.
"You were right," said Malfoy, his grin sharp as they listened to You Oughta Know. "I did like that one."
"Do you know, it's weirdly calming when you insult me?" said Malfoy. "I think I'm fundamentally broken."
is now, which is a posh git with a nice face who's clearly working to become a better person. He has many qualities worthy of admiration."
"Great!" said Ellie, as if that settled it. "Here, fill out this form. We're cash only, is that a problem?"
Then Malfoy drained his cup and rose, slowly. Harry followed him up the stairs, watching Malfoy's elegant hands trace over the bannisters as they mounted the main staircase, studying the set of his slim shoulders as he walked. They didn't turn on the lights in the upstairs corridor, letting the moonlight spill down from the skylight on the top floor, and Harry wanted to say something ridiculous, like
It was a cold, sobering sort of thought. Harry touched the necklace, smooth glass under his fingers, and vowed to himself that he, too, would try to be better.
Malfoy began strolling closer in that insufferably arrogant way of his, all aristocratic grace even when the Ministry had stripped them of everything and his name no longer meant a thing. Harry already wanted to punch him.
"I wondered if you'd ever talk to me again," said Blaise, voice light, as though it were nothing at all. Harry was beginning to think that it was just something about how Blaise spoke.
. If you don't look after it, House will cause trouble. Dust, spiders, Doxies. Food going bad. Doors slamming."
Harry winced, a look Andromeda politely ignored as she led Harry into the living room. It was a small terrace, painted in bright whites and lemon yellows, ruthlessly tidy and bursting with plants and vases conspicuously arranged above waist height.
As Harry towelled himself dry in his bedroom, staring at his new wardrobe, he was treated to the sound of Dean and Seamus squabbling over Dean's clothing choices in the corridor, darting in and out of each other's rooms and bickering their way into the bathroom. He wondered where Malfoy was. What Malfoy would wear. He wondered, for the first time, where Malfoy's old things had gone — had he never owned Muggle clothes? Did they get lost? Stolen?
"I don't know if I've changed. I walk the line every day between the voice in my head that says that I'm a Malfoy and I am owed the world, and the voice in my head that hates every inch of me. It feels like whatever I do to defeat one lets the other run rampant."
"A bit of the last one," said Harry, still grinning. "Maybe a bit of the second one, too, I guess I don't know what I don't know. But mostly I said it because I'm a Gryffindor, and we love rushing into adventure."
Harry wanted to hate that laugh, but all his bitterness didn't stand a chance against seeing genuine happiness from Malfoy. He sparkled with it, transparent as a suncatcher in the light. Harry couldn't imagine how he'd survived in Voldemort's court, being so readable.
"Pans, you should come and see my room," said Draco suddenly, loud and bright. "It's actually rather lovely, a bit like the Slytherin dorm with all the green and the four-poster and such. The House Magic doesn't seem to be working quite right yet, but it's still very nice."
"I heard the rumours of that back then, you know. I didn't believe it. It might not astonish you to hear this, Potter, but I was a rather precious and sheltered child, and the idea of a parental figure putting someone in a cupboard to sleep sounded like it was something out of a particularly macabre book. My eleven-year-old self was convinced it was simply a transparent ploy for attention. My Mind Healer would call that projection, I expect."
"It's a genre," said Dean. "Maybe I'll play you some if we can ever figure out a Muggle soundsystem. God knows how the record player works, some impressive spellwork going on in there. We tried bringing an actual CD player in, but the House Magic fried it immediately."
Everything seemed to turn to slow motion. Harry's heart, already beating fast from the flush of flirting, now seemed to flutter unpleasantly in his chest. He gasped, taking in an urgent breath as he took a step backwards, staggering until he hit a low wall. He slid down it, chest heaving, body dizzy, a sense of nameless and all-encompassing dread filling his every pore.
Neville, Ginny, and Hermione worked on the decorations in the drawing room, and Dean, Seamus and Luna tackled the dining room. Each of them popped down to the kitchen every now and then to steal a sandwich or a cup of tea. Each of them was suspiciously covered in glitter.
Harry's whole body zinged with adrenaline, Draco's hands tangled in his hair, Draco's chest against his. Harry's mind went blissfully blank, thoughts utterly stolen by the euphoria of having Draco finally against him.
join me. I've a friend in the French Ministry who would absolutely love to meet you. I'm sure he'd offer you a position on his team after five minutes of your company."
"Good-o," said Fish. "Knew he'd land on his feet eventually, posh git like that. Tell 'im I said hello. Say, do you wanna blow this lot off and go grab a pint?"
"Oh forgive me, Potter, my closest confidante, for not telling you every thought that crosses my mind," said Malfoy, pressing a hand to his chest.
"Nah," said Harry, "I'll take them all. And these." He brandished the records. The man's pierced eyebrow rose.
Harry sat up, tugged at Draco's velvet trousers; Draco helped him with fumbling hands, pushed his trousers and boxers down with an inelegant movement, kicked them away. They hit Harry's wardrobe and fell into a crumpled pile beside the boots.
But they didn't look for what they came for, both of them content to wander a little longer. Malfoy tried to make him buy some giant boots all covered in buckles; Harry accidentally bumped into a rack of studded collars outside a very sexual-looking shop and had to pick them all up, the owner laughing at him as he helped Harry out.
"And this is Keith." Keith was a little younger than Janine, in jeans and a shirt with the left arm pinned up, his right arm sporting a bicep the size of Harry's head. He nodded at Harry, grim. "And Elsie." Elsie was tiny, dressed in black, with jet-black hair and white make-up, and she was standing behind Janine with the air of someone hiding. She looked as though she couldn't even be Ginny's age. Harry gave her an encouraging smile — she turned abruptly away from him. Ginny patted Harry on the arm, and circled around Janine to talk to her.
It was a double lesson with Slytherin, which meant Malfoy was there, but he had managed to make it out of the door first and had already taken off at record speed when he heard Ron and Hermione's voices.
"Thanks, Harry," she said, smiling vaguely at her embroidery. She'd taken to hand-stitching patterns on every textile Harry owned; little doxies on the curtains, bees and butterflies on the cushions. Harry felt like it would have been normal to be annoyed, but wandering through the house had become a treasure hunt; Harry's favourite find was the little pink moustache she'd embroidered over Walburga Black's face on the family tapestry.
Luna gave him a kindly look. "He's gone out for coffee with a friend of mine. He has a lovely space in Camden I think would suit him very much."
Draco wanted him. Draco wanted him, and Harry wanted Draco, and now they were going to do — something —
Harry patted Ginny on the back in congratulations for her victory, and dragged himself up to have a shower.
"Of course not, Harry!" said Ginny, apparently not noticing her brother's urgent head-shake. "It's your house, you can invite whoever you want."
Time seemed to stand still for Harry. Dean stood frozen for a moment, but then his hands came up to dig into Seamus's hair, head angling to deepen the kiss, and Harry couldn't understand why the whole thing hit him like a punch to the chest, like something he'd never seen before — not that he
They entered the room. Almost every female head – and a fair few male ones, too – turned his way. The nearest girl's nose twitched –
His pang of jealousy was tempered by sympathy. They were the only two Slytherins to have returned, and no wonder, for who would stay in a school that had witnessed their loved ones fight to destroy it? The Slytherins were broken, social pariahs, and the worst thing was, Harry could not see how any of them deserved it. Most were too young to have made a decision, and of those who did, how many of them had been given a better choice? And did
"Oh, but I thought you had one," said Malfoy, flashing him a smirk as though they hadn't nearly fallen out. Nearly done something else. "Hippogriff chest tattoo, wasn't it? Or was it a Horntail?"
to hate you! I haven't for ages, and I promise you that the fancying thing is pretty horrifyingly new and weird and I
Malfoy turned away from the drawing room. Harry took several swift steps back down the stairs to avoid being seen, nearly spilling his tea.
"The cottage pie sounds great," said Harry, casting a nervous glance at the door. He hoped not too many students made it a habit to raid the kitchens, because he'd be off his guard with all the food the elves would try to force-feed him.
Everyone turned to look. Malfoy stared back, wide-eyed, taking in each face in turn. Harry tried an encouraging smile.
"You did me a favour and looked the other way, once. I guess I don't want to look the other way, now I know you're here."
"You had me to learn from!" said Seamus. "Font of filth that I am. Do you know, Potter, that I thought you didn't like me for like, a solid year?"
to talk. He wanted to sit up, pull Draco close, and kiss him. He wanted to say he was sorry for how he'd been before, but he knew Draco wouldn't care to hear it.
It looked like the sort of place Harry couldn't quite believe he owned. He wondered if he might sell it one day, now that people wouldn't turn tail at the very sight of it.
come to Paris," said Pansy seriously, staring at him. "You must come and see your mother, and meet Astoria. She'd simply
"Wouldn't be your smartest move either way," he agreed. "Given that there's no chance in hell anyone in the house would ever sell Harry out, we're all more than equipped to take you down, and one of us is going to be an Auror soon."
There were several familiar, brightly coloured printouts in the tray. Harry turned around to stare at Hermione.
Harry could hear the noise of the common room as he travelled down the stairs. He tried to stop, but Hermione tightened her grip.
Harry didn't want to question his version of reality. The idea felt like standing on the edge of a deep, dark pit.
while in the service of Lord Voldemort," said Ron, grinning. Harry felt a sharp, hot stab of longing — for a world without Voldemort, for a world where Sirius and Regulus both had a chance to grow up and mend a bridge, share their love for Muggle music. To show it to Harry, a
Was he being selfish, haunting Grimmauld Place like a sad ghost? He'd wanted them to stay here, he'd wanted to help them, but was he actually holding them back?
Hermione gave him a reproving look this time. Harry downed the rest of his cocktail and quietly hoped Malfoy had poisoned it.
"Anyone else, Potter," said Draco against his lips, some moments later, "And I'd think that was a line."
Harry watched as Draco brought a spoonful to his mouth. His eyes fluttered closed, a moment of rapt indulgence, and Harry found himself gripping his own spoon hard enough to bruise.
The week before his birthday, the bright summer weather broke into a deluge of thunderous rain. The house felt hot and close, the outside unusually dark, occasionally illuminated by the bright, harsh flash of lightning.
"Out the way, snotface," said Ron from behind her. "I need to get to the drinks cabinet after the day I've had. Training on a Saturday? Should be criminal. Oooh, biscuits!"
"I'm sure old MacDonald would be delighted to have you," offered Ginny, messing up on purpose to make the Muggle-borns wince.
to know. People who found him attractive and interesting when he was just being Harry, some scruffy git wandering about getting tattoos and buying records.
"Well," he said, "It's the first time anyone's done anything exactly like it. Maybe there's money in it. Certainly Magic Mobiles seem to be making a killing."
Draco moaned, and bit, and together they writhed in angry, vicious abandon - then Draco was rolling on top again, and Harry was tearing at clothing, and with closed eyes and jerking hips, both of them pushed themselves over the edge. Draco came against him with a cry, and in heated shame Harry followed.
Draco Malfoy stood in the back of the van, his cheeks flushed from the cold, his head at an awkward angle against the roof and long hair spilling out from under his wooly green hat. His expression was caught between guilty and exasperated.
"Ginny takes him charity shopping," said Ron, who'd been watching Harry watch Malfoy. "She's a menace."
"Beer pong," shouted Seamus from the opposite end of the table, gesturing at the arrangement of cups. He was shirtless, and completely plastered in green glitter. Behind him, a six-foot drinks fountain pumped out waves of unsettlingly green punch.
Harry's eyes began to prickle. It was absurd, impossible, that they should be okay with this at three in the morning, yet here they were taking it into their stride, like this was all unfortunate but perfectly normal. Like the man Harry had fallen for wasn't Draco sodding Malfoy.
Ginny made a beeline for the group of people collected at the back of the room. Harry trailed behind, focusing on the table rather than the people themselves — there were cups and glasses, a jug of orange squash and a tea urn, and the four strangers were all clustered around an open Tupperware box of brownies.
"This school, unfortunately, does not have solitary confinement facilities," said McGonagall, looking amused. "But perhaps you could be given the day off. To research. Miss Granger can fetch you some relevant books and then return to her afternoon lessons. In the meantime, I suggest you stay locked in your dorm. Come to me if there are any developments, please, Miss Granger."
When he got to the Leaky Cauldron, he stopped to catch his breath for a moment. Then he slipped down the back alley, tapped the brick, and stood back.
Autumn struck the house in a sheet of icy rain, and Harry woke to another Bad Day. He knew he should do something — walk in the rain, visit the Burrow or Shell Cottage, make a plan, look for a job, maybe even write to the Ministry and tell them he was wrong and he
"Oh," he said, and took a deep breath. Then, because Ginny was openly searching his face for what that meant, he added, "Yes, I think you're right."
Harry glanced at Malfoy, hovering behind her by the stairs. He was looking at Dean, clearly disappointed.
Draco smirked lasciviously, and he took advantage of Harry's shock to slam him back against his father's desk. Harry winced, pulled Draco closer by his shirt, rolled him over and slammed his head back into the desk.
Malfoy was striding into the dungeons when Harry caught up. He heard Harry following, and spun to meet him.
Andromeda placed Teddy carefully onto Harry's lap; Teddy blinked at him, sleepy-eyed and ruddy-cheeked, before resting his head on Harry's shoulder and sticking his thumb in his mouth.
That Christmas, however, was a strange and uneasy affair. First, they lost Luna for a few weeks, as she went to stay with her father; Harry missed the sight of her quietly writing
"I —" said Blaise, as though she wanted to say something comforting, or perhaps apologise. "I'm glad to see you've landed on your feet."
"Me too," said Ginny. "But it does make it easier to tell people what you're feeling when you have a word, you know?"
"Right," said Malfoy, miserably. "Well, that's as much as I can ask. More, really. I'll keep out of your way."
"The Dark Mark was instant," he said, voice so quiet Harry had to lean forward to hear. "Absolute agony, naturally, but it took a second. One second to make a decision like that."
"I guess fortune favours the bold a lot more if they have a plan," said Harry, painfully aware that he did not have a plan. That he didn't even know where to start.
"I solemnly swear I am up to no good," Harry murmured, on a whim, and the spell broke, releasing a secret drawer with a soft pop.
"Not bad," he conceded. "I've seen him sell out for much less. Alright, Potter, take me to whatever torture dungeon you're hoping to keep your new pet Death Eater."
money, right? Where'd it all go? Was it shit with his dad? My guess is they turfed him out, didn't like his
it, he thought — had feelings that he sated with his own hand — but it didn't feel overwhelming, as Ron had tentatively, drunkenly described his first time with Hermione. He felt an envy for their glow, the spark between them.
"I don't think he knew," said Harry. "I don't think he believed it was going to be the death of him. He knew it was a risk, and he took it. Like a Slytherin. Like someone staring into an enemy's face, and taking a risk to pretend not to recognise them."
"George sent us prank deodorant that attracts women!" said Ron quickly, saving Harry from a potential hexing. "Harry didn't know."
As he spoke the words, he sat up again, drenched in alarm. What if Luna couldn't — Malfoy couldn't go out on the streets again — Harry couldn't bear the thought of him being that vulnerable again —
"You don't really think this was your fault? Can't you hear it from the outside? That a pathetic excuse for a man found a messed-up teenager, targeted them and systematically
Then the rest of them left the breakfast table to work or study and Harry was left alone, with nothing to do but fight Kreacher over who got to do the washing up. Thursday daytimes were always bad, but today was particularly dire, as heavy rain meant that the garden needed no tending, and there wasn't much left to do about the house.
"In that case,” Harry stared into silver eyes with pupils blown wide, "You can always come up to my room. You can show me the CD player."
He strode forward, pausing for a moment to buy a silver and green dragon from the wizard in the top hat. He pretended he didn't know who he bought it for.
confident the Black house had accepted him as the true heir — Walburga certainly didn't. But he wasn't sure if it counted as a
Ginny lent me some foundation before the party. I didn't give it back. Much as I deserve to stare at it for the rest of my days, sometimes I'm too much of a coward."
"Oh," said Hermione. "Well... not necessarily. I mean, it's not that different from kissing a girl, is it... and many authorities believe in a sliding scale of sexuality, so maybe you're just a
"If Darren tries to cheat off me one more time," replied Dean, stabbing at his stew. "I'm going to be calling you to help me dispose of the body."
"You're good, you know, Weasley," he said, guiding them back to the safe zone of Quidditch. "You're going to get hired any day now, I'm sure of it."
girls throwing themselves at you?" said Harry. "I mean, when you've got Hermione. Wouldn't she kill you?"
"It IS you! Oh my God, it's Harry Potter! I knew it! Can I have your autograph? I'm such a big fan."
Then Ron corralled Harry into a discussion with Dean about whether Muggle martial arts were better than Auror combat training, and Hermione danced with Ginny on the coffee table, and everyone got progressively louder and more drunk until Harry looked around and could no longer see Draco.
"So what are the black ones?" said Harry, making the mistake of looking at Draco. His face was very close.
Headmistress McGonagall looked disapprovingly over her glasses. Harry squirmed in her new office, feeling like a first year. How could he feel like this, when only a few months before he'd killed the darkest wizard in a century?
"If I can manage it," he said. Harry stared at him; Ron had always craved recognition, but this was something different. It was as though he'd finally realised that he didn't have to covet it — he could just have it, if he worked for it enough.
Seamus obviously caught something of the tension in the room, because he looked between them. A slow smirk crept over his friendly face.
up to something. But he's not now, and I very much doubt he'll be back now he's seen me. Harry must know that."
"I don't know if it's obvious," said Neville, who'd been silent up until this point, "But I also say no. I've come too far to
"You're misunderstanding me," she said. "I'm saying that dating someone with that kind of power differential is risky and irresponsible."
He made it as far as the third floor without meeting anyone. It was very strange, to see a fifth-year Ravenclaw sniffing the air and making random leaps; Harry took pity on her, and blocked her nose.
The next morning, however, Harry came downstairs to find that Malfoy and Dean had not forgotten their plans. Malfoy was leaning against the drawing room door in black jeans and a band shirt that Harry recognised as one of Dean's.
Kreacher was much less gaunt these days, and he had an array of pillow-case outfits now, from casual cotton to formal silk. He seemed to have more of a sense of humour the more time Harry spent with him, and he hardly ever went into wailing agonies of guilt any more. For reasons Harry couldn't explain, he seemed to get on with Harry more than anyone else, though nowadays he was unfailingly polite to everyone, even Hermione.
"Hey," he said. "Buy you a drink? I can introduce you to Jenny. Well, if she lets me in, which she probably will if I flash this cash."
"Sometimes I wonder if I should have followed your lead with this Auror business," said Ron, staring at the ceiling.
"I cooked, you serve," he said, grinning at Ron's mock-outrage, and as Ginny dished up she made a threatening gesture with the ladle that flicked tomato sauce onto his glasses.
"Potter," said Malfoy in his ear at one point, as they stared at an array of weirdly shaped sunglasses. "This isn't normal for Muggles, is it?"
Molly had done a beautiful job of the dinner. The house itself looked more festive than he'd ever seen it. He should be happy.
Harry also watched as he left for his first day working for the Muggles. He left the house grey and rigid; he came back on heavy feet, but flushed and triumphant.
"Merlin's bollocks, Potter, you're – well, let's just say you're looking in the wrong section." He gave Harry a contemplative look. "Here. Follow me."
Then the door opened, letting light flood in from the corridor. Malfoy was silhouetted in the doorway.
because apparently the accent isn't proof enough that I am a British citizen. So I gave up on that notion and went to my meeting with my probation officer, which was an
"Hello, Mr Potter," she said in polite, clipped tones, further cementing her McGonagall-esque quality in Harry's eyes. "It's a pleasure to meet you. Please, come in."
"Sounds awful," he grated out, through a closing throat. Ginny looked at him for a long time, face a mix of frustration and sympathy, and Harry felt as if the walls of the kitchen were somehow far away, as though everything was far away —
Hermione, who had visibly slumped at the mention of the Harpies, looked annoyed at this point of common ground.
They hadn't said much, yesterday. Everyone had been too keen to talk about Harry's tattoo, crowding him, and Malfoy had smiled wryly from behind Hermione's shoulder and vanished upstairs.
"You're not wrong about him needing good influences, Harry," she said. "And I wouldn't mind. But I can't abide hurting my friends. If Draco in the house would hurt anyone, I'm not interested."
She held up a notebook as she spoke. It was absolutely rammed with precisely drawn flowers, like a botany book, except that amongst the plants there were a hundred different kinds of skulls.
He pulled out the Marauder's Map.  There was no-one in the common room – it was now or never if he was going to make it to the kitchens unscathed.
Harry, abruptly, didn't feel at all normal. Should he feel jealous? He would have, once. He'd been stupid with jealousy, once.
"We liked Radiohead, too," said Harry. "Alanis Morissette. Bowie. Pink Floyd. Honestly I don't know what I'm into, seems to be all over the place."
"Hi," said Harry, running a hand through his hair. The man looked up at him, gave him an obvious once-over, and grinned.
Wandlessly, Harry opened the door, holding the food out like an offering. Malfoy was lying on his front on the bed; he craned his neck to look up at him.
"Problem, Malfoy?" Seamus's voice rang out, bright with false cheer. Malfoy was silent for a moment.
"Yes, well," she said, flinging her arms back against the sofa. Luna began to fan Ginny's hair on her lap like a halo. "Thanks. But I don't think pretty is what I'm aiming for in life, you know? Mum used to make weird comments whenever I dressed up, stuff about how I was going to make some young man very happy one day, and I guess I thought that was always going to be my job, you know? Get married, make a nice home, have kids… all stuff to make a man happy."
Fish threw up his hands, like he didn't believe it but wasn't about to start a fight over it. Fish, Harry supposed, would be in a position to know about addicts and honesty. Harry looked at the fresh pint in front of Fish, grimaced, and found himself pushing his own beer away.
me, sir, is room service inadequate?" said Harry dryly. Malfoy gave him a funny look, but stepped back to let him in.
"Sorry, guys," said Dean, taking the vial off Hermione. "I'm going to look after him. We can do another day. Or you can just go without me?"
Draco ruined Harry's plans by appearing in the kitchen doorway as Harry was making the coffee, sleep-rumpled and unsure in Harry's spare pyjama bottoms.
Then Malfoy's face came back into view, and Harry looked away, catching the eye of a girl in a neon dress who gave them both a lingering look as she sashayed past. She winked.
A thin older woman and someone with cropped blue hair and a nose ring were waving at Janine from the door.
The central staircase, always a focal point of the house, was now even wider and more grand, light streaming all the way down from the roof to the foyer. The handrails, once uncomfortably low and wobbly, now slipped firmly through his hands as he ran down the stairs, keen to see the drawing room.
"Apparently, this is called a mixtape." He waved it over his shoulder. "Although I'm not sure why, since it is clearly not a tape. Elliot made it for me, so I imagine it's a little eccentric, but it's the best I've got for now."
"You made it, Harry, help yourself." John gave him a paternal smile, gesturing with the plastic cup in his own hand. Harry looked around to the man in the van, smiling what he hoped was his most charming
"Take it you did a lot of thinking, then?" said Hermione, as Harry sat down in the common room with a flop.
"Hello Neville, would you like a tea?" asked Luna. Neville smiled and joined the cross-legged party by the teapot.
Diagon Alley hit him like a wave of Christmas cheer, and Harry remembered what it was to be around so much
The letter at the top was in handwriting Harry knew well — Remus Lupin. Harry felt a stab in his chest, burning eyes threatening to break him open. He remembered throwing this letter aside, before. If he'd known what was to happen, maybe he would have lingered.
"Tell us the play-by-play then," prompted Seamus, and Ginny settled down on the floor between him and Luna to tell the tale. Ron flopped down beside Harry.
"Only to win over the guard with the tale of our great love, Draco, only for that reason." Pansy patted his hand. "And besides, you had your revenge. My ego has never recovered from your
Ginny got up to put the next album on, stripped off her Quidditch leathers and dumped them beside the record player. Then she stretched out on the floor with her head on a beanbag, Luna settling in next to her. There was a lull for a moment, as everyone listened to the now-familiar opening bars of the album. Neville tapped his foot, smiling to himself.
"Perhaps I can do something about her," said Blaise, a note of emotion creeping into that otherwise unreadable voice.
Harry turned around then, looking to join Ginny, Seamus and Dean dancing, just in time to catch Seamus stumble into Dean, stare at him, and then kiss him.
, he thought, and slung his arm back around Draco. Draco shifted closer, and Harry smiled into his shoulder.
He did end up losing to Ron, of course, but then Ron did the victory dance until Hermione was in fits of laughter, so Harry didn't mind.
"Well, he told me a lot of things. I knew he had a temper, but whenever he snapped at me he was always so
A few days later, in a quiet moment, Harry found Malfoy stretched across a beanbag, lean and elegant, pale hands turning pages on an old, fragile Potions textbook.
"Your existence makes me uncomfortable," muttered Malfoy into his cup, but his shoulders slumped again.
"Can I get you anything?" asked Harry, the question coming out rather more rough than he'd intended.
He sounded warm, even indulgent. Harry found himself striding forward into the drawing room without thinking about it.
"Everyone's very surprised, but this is the only thing that I've done so far that matches my original life plan," she said, when Harry asked. "Mum and dad always recommended a gap year. To find yourself, you know?"
He kept his eye on Malfoy as he ate. He had no idea what he was going to do, but then plans were not really in his nature. The first thing to do seemed to be to ascertain what Pansy's role was in all of this.
"That's right.” Andromeda smiled at Teddy. "Of course, he took to saying many other words immediately after, including such delights as
"Let me stop you there.” Malfoy held up a hand. "I am sure he has many virtues, but the fact remains that he could be the kindest, nicest, most perfect person in the whole wide world and I will still hate Harry Potter. Because it is very important to me that I do."
"Watch the face, Draco, honestly," said Pansy, but it was soft now, and one hand came up to stroke his hair. They stayed like that for a long time.
over someone like that, and it seemed unutterably cruel that the first person he'd been charmed by after escaping the clutches of Voldemort was another, pettier scumbag. He supposed that he really ought to find it funny, given what a horrible brat Malfoy had always been, but he didn't. He could only think of a skinny, pale boy in a bathroom, too terrified to know how to get out.
Harry stared at Dean's face, serious and familiar. He watched the rhythm of his shoulders as they rose and fell in exaggerated breaths. He tried to hold back the tears, though his chest ached with them.
"We'll have a nice dinner party," said Hermione, whose voice sounded a little tight. "I'm sure it will be… lovely."
. Spider was annoyed at me for it, for the state of the flat and how little effort I was putting in. One day, when he was particularly annoyed with me, I asked him for a paracetamol and he told me we'd run out. I didn't really think we had, part of me knew he said it just to mess with me, so I toughed it out for a few days, but I started feeling shivery, like I had the flu, and then when I told him about it Spider was all nice as pie again, sitting me down on the sofa and saying he was sorry, that of
The party was in full swing when he arrived at the. Someone was playing Christmas hits out of a tinny speaker, and the crowd were lingering in the cold this time, dancing and chatting rather than slipping away into the night. Marjorie and Barbara were handing out shoeboxes wrapped in cheap wrapping paper, and John was standing by the back of the van gesturing enthusiastically to the person inside.
"I can't figure out the criteria," he said. "For what I like, I mean. For a while I genuinely thought I just fancy Quidditch players, but it's more — I dunno. People I trust. People I feel close to. I don't see handsome strangers and go all gooey, even the Veela just made me feel a bit fuzzy. I'd say I'm not sexual, but I definitely am. I don't know."
His mind seemed to snag on the word. It was one thing to read it in a leaflet; it was another to see someone he knew, someone who could just say it aloud, albeit with a fierce awkwardness.
But with the weather outside wet and hostile, the quiet days slipped into louder nights. With the fire lit and his closest friends good-naturedly bickering on their beanbags, the drawing room began to feel like a smaller, fancier version of the Gryffindor common room. They listened to the radio, and learned to drink wine mostly because it felt like a shame not to use the drawing room's antique glassware. Some nights they played board games, although Monopoly posed such a threat to house harmony that when Harry spotted Ron putting it in the bin one morning, he kept a careful silence.
Luna had given them their first cake for free, but Harry put down more cash than he needed to and told her to keep the change. She accepted it with a peck on the cheek. Malfoy froze like a startled deer when she turned to him and kissed his cheek too; Harry repressed a laugh at the sight of his face.
"See you, mate," said Ron, patting him sympathetically. "I'll brief everyone in the dorm about nasal precautions. You know, just in case."
Then he went to Flourish and Blotts and bought Hermione an expensive quill and a notebook, because at least she couldn't have read a notebook already. Harry was served by Blott himself; the man was all smiles, but Harry made some loud comments about how he hoped his excellent staff were being paid a fair wage and treated well, and left Blott standing at the till with several curious eyes upon him. The assistant that day hid his grin behind a copy of Advanced Potion Making.
Harry leant his head on Hermione's shoulder. The park was a peaceful oasis, cool and tranquil in the autumn light. Amber leaves fluttered down from the trees; Harry breathed in the smell of damp earth and tried not to think of anything at all.
Harry wondered who that would be. Harry knew that he was only in contact with Blaise, Pansy, and his mother, because the Fidelius Charm meant that Malfoy had been obliged to ask Harry to send out his address. Harry had sent Narcissa and Pansy polite notes, and had received replies. He hadn't read either of them yet.
"That's a good idea," said Hermione brightly, "Why don't you go together? You can't leave Draco in the lurch Harry, he'll need your help with the Muggle bits."
"I don't know," said Draco, looking back to Harry with startlingly soft, open eyes. "I think people deserve safety. Love. Happiness. But I don't know if
"I tried to limit the glitter," she said dryly, gesturing to the décor. "But I'm afraid there was no saving the dining room."
"Yes," she repeated, after a moment. "Yes, right. I don't think I'm the same person I was and I know
"You think this is funny, is that it?" he hissed, shaking Harry, "Yet another way to humiliate me, is that it? Haven't you done enough, coming to my hearing and being all
Harry turned to push Malfoy away, but it all seemed to go horribly wrong, because now they were there, he couldn't move his hands off Malfoy's shoulders. And Malfoy was giving him a dark, daring look, tilting his chin, and Harry wasn't going to
"What a band!" said Ron, laughing over Hermione's frustrated noises. "Galvin Gudgeon, backing vocals."
"You're worse than Seamus," said Harry, hoping Malfoy couldn't see the heat in his face. "I have no idea what you mean by that."
"Alright?" said Harry, holding out a bowl, looking curiously at the sliver of dressing room behind her shoulder. It looked a little messy, but Harry couldn't see what she was up to.
He thought he might just have to risk it. If he left now, he'd be able to go down to the kitchens for a snack before mid-morning lessons. Not that he knew what they even were – he'd have to hope he bumped into Ron and Hermione.
"You could fetch your own," said Harry, setting the bowl down on the side and sitting on the pouffe. "Or eat with us."
"Hey, it's me old boarding school chum!" he said, in his terrible rendition of an upper class accent. He slapped Harry rather hard on the back. "You find Dray in the end?"
"Alright," said Neville, eyeing the cauldron like he had every intention of overfilling it himself. "Deal."
"I didn't finish," said Harry. "D'you think it's weird how quickly everyone's decided to be fine with him?"
Another weight lifted off Harry's chest. He didn't know what he'd been expecting today — some deep dive into his childhood, perhaps, something wrenching and impossible — but this was a very bearable plan. He didn't have to start anything huge today.
On Wednesday, Malfoy attempted his best invisible impression at dinner, trying to sneak his way through the kitchen to the casserole dish despite the fact that absolutely everyone had one eye on him.
"Sorry I'm late, everyone," called Neville down the stairs, brushing mud off his cardigan as he did a little jog into the kitchen. "What's for — " He saw Malfoy and stopped, eyes narrowed. Malfoy, already pale, went white.
read something you give them, but if you can drop an organisation naturally into the conversation you'll have more luck. Not that everyone will want to talk to you, and that's alright — we're not here to save everyone, especially those who don't want our help, we're just here to hold out a helping hand. Make sense?"
"It's… complicated," he gritted out. "Besides, you said yourself it's good for trauma. Cruciatus damage. That sort of thing."
"Ah, something I can help with," said Blaise. "Are you having trouble with the Ministry Application for Muggle Identification?"
"I know you've probably never treated my sister with anything but the utmost honour," he said. "We've got potions first, by the way. Looking forward to Slughorn finding out you're
"He was in Slytherin, naturally," said Harry, staring at Regulus's spot on the tapestry. "Strong views about Muggle-borns and magical superiority. Loved old Voldie's teachings." Malfoy didn't flinch, but his lip quirked in a cold sort of smile. "He was a Death Eater, and he got pretty far in before he realised that it wasn't all that great. Then he found out about something very important, something Voldemort wanted to keep hidden, and he knew where it was. So he tried to destroy it. He died in the attempt."
"Yeah, get your kit off, Harry," she called, grinning. Harry looked at her, then at the slim tube of pale blue silk that made up Ginny's new dress, and swallowed. He glanced at Dean, sharing in an awkward ex-boyfriend moment; Dean grinned, and then nodded to Luna.
"Um," Draco repeated, eyes flicking between Dean and somewhere around the region of Harry's belly button. "Yes. Right."
"Go on then, Potter," he murmured in his ear. "Look at that picture for five minutes and tell me you're not turned on."
"A hundred years, if you need it," said Ron seriously. Then, because he knew Harry well enough to know this kind of conversation gave Harry the urgent need for space: "Wanna cuppa?"
"He sounds like a prick, but can we not discuss vigilante justice against Muggles in front of an Auror-in-Training?" said Ron.
and come down in those accursed velvet trousers and a shirt, usually not done up, and sometimes he wore a studded bracelet, obviously from Camden, that made Harry's mouth go dry and his thoughts blur into nothing.
"I felt like shit after the beating he gave me," Malfoy continued. "But Spider settled me down on the sofa and gave me some tea and paracetamol and for a few days I just lay there, feeling kind of sick and kind of spaced out, but okay. Nothing was really
"It's all very sad," said Luna, and curled up beside Ginny like a cat. "Ron, you're next, if you're willing."
"Oi, Potter," said Ron, jumping on his bed and waking him with a start. "You're safe now, I reckon. How does it feel not to drive women crazy with your scent?"
"Malfoy," said Harry gently, "I know you had opiates in your system. Fish said you went through withdrawals. If you weren't an addict, how did that happen?"
She was staring at Ginny, and her eyes were very wide. Harry raised his eyebrows. So he hadn't been imagining
Harry wondered if he should announce his presence, but he couldn't think of anything meaningful to say. He felt, abruptly, exhausted.
"I don't know why you think I should care about such things," said Draco. "It's a personal goal of mine to be disinherited. They shall have to burn me off all the tapestries in the land, so thoroughly shall I be an insult to pure-bloodedness."
"Alright, Malfoy," she said, and punched him on the arm. "Don't be all boring, I'm sure she's simply delightful. You should invite her over, seems like we're doing that now."
"Don't give me undue credit for the bare minimum of moral decency," he said. "It hardly begins to make up for what I've done."
Winter broke at the start of March, and with it some of Harry's low mood. He celebrated the bright, clear days of spring by learning how to repoint, render and paint the front of the house. It looked utterly different by May, clean and bright, the windows washed and glossed. Ginny and Luna helped him decorate, their handiwork evident in the rainbow-painted window-boxes bursting with spring shoots.
Harry nodded, and when Ron was gone he curled around the bee pillow and stared, vacantly, at the front cover of
For the rest of the week he watched the four of them, so often the only daytime presence in the house, and tried to decide what it was that was going on between them. Dean and Ginny were affectionate and tactile now, in a way they hadn't been before that Thursday conversation, shoulder-barges and pats on the arm. Seamus flirted with Ginny, and Ginny flirted back, but Harry was fairly sure that was simply their preferred style of communication, signalling nothing more than platonic affection. Luna and Ginny were different again, ebbing and flowing about the house, often independent but always coming together again to talk nonsense on the sofa, shoulder to shoulder. And by contrast Dean and Seamus orbited each other in a tight circle, Dean eyeing Seamus when he wasn't looking, Seamus watching Dean as he drew.
Draco gave him a baleful look. "It's Latin, I didn't invent it," he complained. "Now come here, before I give up on this nonsense entirely and run off to Paris."
article about his abused childhood gave Harry a panic attack that shook the books off all the bookshelves. They'd used it once more when Seamus rather enthusiastically described a part of his horror novel where the ghost possessed the girl and forced her to murder her brother, which sent Ginny off to the bathroom to be unexpectedly sick.
"Great," he said, and after a moment the smile became genuine. "Go absolutely wild. Me eighteenth was a bit of a drab affair, now I come to think of it."
"So if you love Harry, and Dean…" said Luna, and Harry, Dean and Ginny shared a moment of shared horror for what might be about to come next. "And you've done sex things with both of them… couldn't you love two people
Draco shifted on one foot, swinging the plastic bag. Harry blinked, shook his head to clear it, and stepped back to let him pass. Draco tossed his hair and strolled past Harry, looking around at the hallway.
"Would suit you," he said, holding up a collar and winking. He was wearing a skin-tight PVC vest and a collar of his own, with a padlock on it. "Or maybe for your boyfriend?"
Malfoy stared openly at each colourful shop and eccentric stranger, his eye caught by something ridiculous at every street stall. Harry followed him into the throng, adrenaline humming, giddy with the feeling of exploration — not just of Camden, but of the sight of Draco Malfoy himself, hair falling about his slim shoulders as he ran from curio to curio with all the glittering enthusiasm of Arthur Weasley in a toaster shop.
boy, and how you think maybe we should give it a go, and how everything is going to be fine as long as I fall in line? Guess what, it's not fine. Nothing's fine! My father's going to die in prison and my mother doesn't have money to
Through Harry's ire, Harry caught a flash of fear in Draco's eyes, a second of soul-deep hopelessness that seemed to sap his fury from him. He relaxed slowly, eyes on Draco's face, which was twisted in bitter hate that seemed to fade into naked fear as Harry stared. Draco's eyes flicked to Harry's lips, and Harry realised how closely he was pressed to Draco even as Draco's jaw tilted up in defiance, bringing his sneering mouth closer.
Harry dived back onto the bed and slid between Draco's legs, finally able to press every bare inch of himself against him. He felt the pleasure of it crawl across the surface of his skin in a breathtaking shiver, his groan falling against Draco's mouth.
"Makes you feel things about boys who are otherwise unremarkable and quite gross, sometimes," said Ginny bitterly, who hadn't noticed his eyeline. Harry was too fascinated by the pain on Dean's face to be too wounded himself.
"Anyone of the right inclination," explained Hermione helpfully. Harry shook his head in disbelief. He'd had a few surprises on the way here, and of course there'd been
"I don't suppose you recognise it?" said Harry, looking at Malfoy. Malfoy sat up, squinting at the window, and then his face broke out in a smile like the rising of a dazzling sun. Harry found himself caught up in the sight of it, the flash of teeth, the pink bow of Malfoy's mouth curving up with excitement.
"I don't think Worsley did it on purpose," said Harry, amused by Malfoy's unknowing interjection into what happened to be a common household argument.
, thought Harry. That was what people did, when they'd invited someone into their bed. They brought them coffee, and kissed them gently awake. And maybe they did other things, too.
"Did you hear that the reserve Seeker for the Holyhead Harpies is pregnant?" said Ginny. "She announced it's Byron Warbeck's, but he swears he was in Paris at the time of the supposed conception. Quite the scandal."
The next day, Harry put on a white t-shirt, Sirius's turn-ups, and his dragonhide boots. He borrowed Luna's white scarf, and pulled on his leather jacket. He stole Dean's sunglasses from the telephone table in the hall, and tucked the map of London under his arm. Then he walked out of the door and walked south, and he didn't stop until he was on Charing Cross road.
"I thought you liked manual labour?" Malfoy watched Harry settling onto the seat. "Honestly, Potter, I try to do nice things for you."
Harry tried it on, as promised, and then went to look at himself in the mirror in the hallway. A sharper, paler version of his father looked back at him, a bit scruffy with a few days' growth of beard. His hair was longer than Sirius's, and beginning to look more orderly now that the weight of it had overcome the messy curl. The necklace looked… cool. Like something Bill would wear. Or Sirius, maybe.
Harry couldn't entirely tell if Draco was feigning his enthusiasm. He watched him, eyes roving his face until Draco's smirk fell.
Draco's moan was electric in his veins. With enthusiasm, he wrapped his lips around him and sucked him in as well as he could, listening for the sounds that told him of his success. His own cock was still hanging from his open jeans, and he pressed a palm against it, too scared to do anything more for fear he might come like this, giddy with power, the taste of Draco on his lips.
"I think I've had enough of travel for a bit," said Harry, flinging a hand over his eyes. "I've backpacked all over the country, seen all the sights, remember?"
Everyone nodded in firm agreement that it was lovely, and then the room lapsed into silence once more.
The shading was stunning, carefully arranged to make the flowers look as though they overlapped the skull and snake, rather than simply sitting beside it. She'd even taken advantage of the fading blackness of the Mark to add more depth to the skull itself, giving it cracks and flecks, a sense of blackened decay. The snake almost resembled a scorched outline of a snake now, rather than the writhing, living thing it used to be. Inside each eye socket was dark green now, filled with tiny purple-blue flowers. Harry ran a gentle finger over them.
"Oh, to be that Firebolt, eh?" said Dean, winking at Ginny, who was still very much blushing. She rolled her eyes at him.
"I trust you," he said, and he was almost tempted to laugh. Adhikari was a bit intense, nothing like the sarcastic Healer Draco had described, and he found it strangely appealing. It felt like he couldn't upset her. Like he couldn't make her feel sorry for him, even if he tried. It was much nicer than the idea he'd had in his head, a teary-eyed therapist asking him to talk about his feelings.
"Unlike you, Mr Sexually-Oblivious-Until-He-Gets-A-Tongue-Down-His-Throat, I'm slightly more aware of who I actually fancy," snapped Malfoy. "Don't read too much into it."
Harry looked at Kreacher, the little elf who'd done so much for his Masters, good and bad, and felt the seriousness of that duty.
Sometimes he wished he could curl up with Ron and Hermione, like they had in the tent. But it wasn't the same now.
The idea made Harry uneasy. He couldn't really put his finger on why. It just felt stupid, taking something good and right and nice and trying to make it different. He'd managed not to lose Ginny over their failed relationship, but he didn't want to take the risk with Luna. They were just better as friends.
"Funny how things work out," said Harry, staring at the lines of Draco's profile, gilded by the streetlights, aristocratic features no less perfect for the bobble hat.
"You don't know what interests me, Malfoy," said Harry. Malfoy stopped dead; a stranger slammed into him, cursing, and Harry pulled Malfoy back into motion, dragging him up some stone steps and onto the main road.
Harry wordlessly cast a Cleaning Charm over his sticky hands, smirking. He ran his tongue over his wet lips, and Draco closed his eyes as though praying.
Draco was on the front step, illuminated by the hallway light. It gilded his long hair in gold, bathed his bare shoulders in a honey-glow. He was wearing the black velvet trousers again, and pointy black boots. His t-shirt was long white cotton, slashed at the shoulders and hem, with a picture of David Bowie on the front. He looked as though he might be wearing body glitter. There was
Harry was not gentle as he took Draco into his mouth, imagining how it felt to him, feeling obscene and pleased when Malfoy groaned low in his throat. Harry began to move, using his hand where his mouth could not reach, and it was ridiculously arousing to be doing this to him, to have him moan when Harry used his tongue, making him scrabble at the wall for purchase when Harry swallowed around him.
"And of course there's this incredible bias towards Western magic in this country. Did you know that there are indigenous tribes across the world who practice magic without wands, but Western wizards went in and insisted they weren't doing it right, and wouldn't let Indigenous students study at the schools that white wizards set up in their own damn lands unless they bought a wand and learned spells in Latin? And don't even get me started on the Statute of Secrecy, it's completely at odds with the way other cultures integrated non-magical societies with magical ones… it's ethnocentric, and enforcement literally divided communities."
"Of course," said Hermione, looking madly curious. "Um, how about now? I left your homework downstairs. If we make a break for it we can probably find an empty classroom."
Over the next week, new and better clothes seemed to enter Malfoy's wardrobe, all staunchly Muggle, nothing obviously expensive, but better-fitting. He had jeans that didn't look like he'd borrowed them, now, and shirts that he left open to show a flash of the silvery scar across his chest. He watched as Malfoy began to fill them out better, as the labouring and the Quidditch and the walking and the good food made him look stronger, healthier. Even his hair seemed to gleam again, long and soft and tied back with Luna's embroidery thread. He looked good.
The dormitory door opened, and Hermione fired a nose-blocking hex without checking to see who it was.
to know. Harry didn't know how to hide it, felt like it must be transmitting out of his every pore. He ached when Malfoy laughed. Every stupid word he spoke in that ridiculous accent seemed to root Harry to the spot.
"Binary? Like in Arithmancy?" said Malfoy. "Hermione has all these equations written with runes in her dressing room —"
? Never mind that I'd never touched a Muggle oven in my life. And there were people at the house, mostly quiet junkies, but occasionally someone scary or unpleasant. Sometimes they'd call me names, make gross jokes about Spider's posh little rent boy, and he'd just laugh. But still he was always so
"Don't want no scrub weighing you down on your path to Quidditch superstardom," agreed Seamus, nodding sagely. Ginny's grin was bright and fierce.
"You're really obscene," said Harry to the blond boy waiting outside, looking somewhat like sex personified in an open shirt and tight jeans. Or maybe it was just Harry.
And wasn't that a miraculous thought, Draco Malfoy nearly undone below him. Harry sat up, surveying the lithe body stretched in front of him like a dream. The slim chest still heaving, the sharp vee of his hips, the rosy cock still bobbing. The perfect hands, the slim pale forearms…
"I still can't say I believe what people say about my image," he said, "But I am beginning to appreciate maybe I don't see things that clearly, when it comes to myself. Almost like childhood abuse has a detrimental effect, or something."
"Honestly," Draco enthused, wide awake now. "I'm on good terms with the chair of trustees for the War Orphans' Fund, I could introduce you, she'd know exactly what we need the most. And of course you have John to consult, did you know he's on the board of half the homeless charities in the area, not just the soup run? Maybe even your Mind Healer will know people, isn't she a trauma specialist?"
He stepped quietly into the alley, awkwardly balancing two coffees in one hand, and pulled the cardboard back.
"No problem, Harry," he said. "Sorry to miss you at the graduation ceremony, by the way. Hermione told me you were wicked sick. Feel better now?"
"Know I'd what?" said Malfoy. "React quite as much? Bullshit. If you tell anyone, Potter, I swear –"
"Believe what you like, but I've not been… entirely good. It took me a long time to admit to myself that I was hiding Dreamless Sleep in my room not so much for nightmares but more in case I wanted to just… take a holiday from existing."
"My t-shirt was wet." He held up the offending article. Malfoy slumped into a chair and put his face in his hands.
"It's very difficult to properly feel sorry for oneself when one's nemesis is also there sulking in the corner," he said. "I'm about as capable of enjoying Quidditch today as I am capable of enjoying forks to the eyes, but if we do something else, will you let me enjoy my misery in peace?"
" — And I know there is absolutely nothing I can say that can change what I've done, and I don't expect you to accept my apology," Malfoy was saying, as Harry neared the door.
"You're very welcome.” Fish grinned at the meal they'd mostly demolished, and downed the rest of his third pint. Harry watched him, guilt still churning, and then gestured for the bill. Fish looked disappointed for a second, but then brightened.
"Hey!" Harry protested, resisting the absurd urge to cover himself. "It's... possible it's not related..."
Malfoy went silent at the next song, though, staring at the wall intently as he listened, and Harry tuned in to the lyrics. Be a good boy, try a little harder, you've got to measure up, make me prouder.
Harry pulled on his pyjama bottoms and then stuck his head out of the door. Malfoy was on the landing with a sheet wrapped around him at armpit height, bony shoulders spiky and tense. He was staring at the three identical closed doors in front of him.
"Is it just me," said Seamus cheerfully, turning off the pizza alarm with a flick of his wand, "Or is everyone getting more Slytherin as they get older?"
"The first time I saw her, I told her I was only doing this because I made a promise to an enemy, and I could barely get three words out without my throat closing over. It was bloody awful."
"That just makes it more bizarre," said Malfoy, but he slumped against the wall, and looked a little better.
"It's quite big," he said, letting his nerves get the best of him. It wasn't huge, but it wasn't a tiny little thing either.
kinky," he said, waggling his eyebrows significantly. "All that good behaviour's got to break some time."
He was purposeful now, intent on exploring him, running his teeth along Harry's lip, and Harry slid his hands into Draco's silken hair. Draco made a soft noise into his mouth, and Harry thought he might die at the sound of it, wanted to hear it again and again. He pressed himself closer. The hand that was not supporting Draco's weight slid along Harry's torso, working under his t-shirt. Harry could feel something firm and hot pressing against his hip, and the thought made him feel giddy.
"And just so you know, I personally won't hesitate to shop him to the Ministry if he steps one toe out of line," said Seamus.
"Fuck, that would be… good," he said, nails digging into Harry's buttocks. "But I think it should be me, this time."
Harry hated himself for it, but the first sight of Andromeda always felt like a punch in the gut; she was so utterly like her sister Bella, all cheekbones and dangerous beauty. But when he looked again, the image always faded, along with the urge to reach for his wand. Everything about Andromeda was softer — from her fuller figure, to the loose plait of brown hair, to the smile lines around her eyes. She looked older than Bellatrix ever had now, older than her years, and Teddy was burbling happily on her hip.
"How do you want to do this, then?" said Harry, as gently as he knew how. "Do you want me to just keep out of your way?"
"I don't know," mused Draco in a breathless whisper, after a long, heated moment of sweat and lips and tongue. "I think I said something about stopping if you wanted to try something else. And then you stopped. So what would you like to try?"
"Funny old world, isn't it?" said Malfoy, voice bright and brittle. "Can you give me the brain juice already before I die of awkwardness?"
, it's not like you could think I knew you fancied me or anything, I mean, you didn't know either –"
with the others. Mostly I was running errands for the creatures treating my home as their own personal den of filth. The Dark Lord really only kept me
New Year's Eve was better. They had a party at the house and invited all the Weasleys, though only George, Bill and Fleur accepted. Neville and Dean and Seamus came, too, and Neville brought Hannah Abbott as his date. They all ate takeaway Chinese and danced to the WWN, drunk and a little wild. Ginny kissed Harry at the countdown, and it was nice, it was something he missed, until it went on too long and then Ginny broke away with a hasty: "Harry, I can't, it would be easy but it would all be wrong, it would just be what we're
"Only another eighteen hours, Harry. It'll be over in no time. I'll go tell McGonagall. And I'll be sure to bring your homework!"
"Wait, no way Ginny's getting clothes and I'm not, gimme that catalogue," said Ron. Ginny chucked it at his head, but Ron caught it. "Hey 'Mione, how about this for you?"
Luna was waving at him madly from the doorway of a tiny, pink-painted tea room, tucked neatly between a crystal shop and a large textile emporium. She was wearing a pink apron, and an awful lot of things about her array of strange new clothes and the smell of food and incense clicked into place.
Harry tried not to feel too triumphant. Draco might not know exactly what he wanted, but he wasn't about to go running after Pansy the second the opportunity arose.
Harry, feeling suddenly irritable for reasons he couldn't really name, yanked at the sash window to let the owl inside. As he did so, he glanced down at the street; lounging under a tree opposite his house was someone tall, sharply dressed, and looking suspiciously like Blaise Zabini. He turned back to Malfoy, who was unfolding the note with slow, measured gestures.
"Come and sit with us." Her voice was gentle but firm. Malfoy glanced back at the door, then at the seat beside Luna, opened his mouth as though he were about to decline, and then promptly sat down.
It was two in the morning when Harry finally heard them; he padded up the stairs on quiet feet. The first thing he spotted was the red of Pansy's eyes, the smudge of mascara underneath — but her hands were wrapped tight around Draco's neck, and Draco was stroking her dark hair and murmuring something soft. Harry's stomach turned to knots for what felt like the hundredth time.
Malfoy swallowed, still focused on the onions, but no longer chopping. Harry felt hot and cold at once, alive with hope and longing and the
Harry saw guilt and self-loathing etched into Malfoy's frame, shoulders hunched and spiky, face screwed up. It was interesting to see it on him, someone Harry associated with entitlement and petty cruelty; it reminded him of sixth year, of crying in a bathroom.
Hermione had the grace to look embarrassed. "Yes, well. You should know better now, at least. How much did you hear?"
He went inside in the afternoon and had a long, cool shower. The house was still and quiet, everyone asleep or out, so he walked down to the drawing room and put an album on the record player and half-reading Seamus's abandoned Quidditch annual. He was almost asleep when Seamus, bleary-eyed and still in pyjamas, poked his head around the drawing room door.
"For heaven's sake," said Ron, bashing his head on the window as he stuck his head out. "What on earth — oh, alright Harry?" his face broke into a slow grin, taking in his and Draco's entwined hands. "Watching the sunrise, are you? God, it's going to be gross with you two, I can tell. And after me and Hermione have been so polite and respectful as well. Well just you wait, Harry, there's going to be public displays of affection all over the shop now, don't you doubt it. I
He dropped a large, heavy paper book onto the coffee table. Several Pamphlets fluttered to the floor.
"I'm flattered," said Harry. Malfoy scowled and opened his mouth, but Harry was spared his riposte by the whistle of the kettle. Harry and Malfoy both went to get up; Malfoy looked at him for a moment, then shrugged and sat down again.
going to be you who deals with him, you know that, right? He causes trouble, he has a breakdown, he has weird withdrawal symptoms, you're the one cleaning up his sick or whatever."
Pansy's first drink was finished before she even touched the soup. Harry sipped at his, painfully aware of the pin-drop silence. As though sensing a dinner party in need of rescue, Kreacher swiftly switched the aperitifs for wine; Pansy snatched up a bottle of red before it could begin to pour itself. She tipped almost half of it into her glass. The complete abandonment of manners made Harry warm to her a little.
, not stiffen up entirely, loosen your elbow up a bit. Here." Draco closed a hand over his wrist, tilted it slightly. Harry stared at the point of contact, thinking that the idea of him
Harry had an intuition that Draco would ask him for another finger at almost the moment that he did, which was reassuring. Draco was making little movements, pushing onto his fingers. Draco's cock was leaking, rosy and within tempting closeness to Harry's mouth; he wrapped his mouth over the tip and Draco clenched and arched up, fists scrabbling at the sheets.
In honour of the bittersweet nostalgia, Harry popped the cork on a bottle of pumpkin juice and set it beside Malfoy's left hand. Malfoy took a swig, looked surprised, smiled to himself, and then schooled his face into disapproval.
"Necklaces can be for boys, Harry," said Ginny. "At least try it on, you'll like it. It's the exact colour of your eyes. And all you need to do if you're ever feeling overwhelmed is touch it. It'll help."
"This is a number for a guy I know," he said. "Cash-in-hand labouring. It's not consistent, but it's something."
" said Harry, louder than he intended. He dropped his voice again. "And what about you? Are you just a victim in all this? Don't think I couldn't feel as well, Malfoy –"
"Yeah. Hefting bricks, mixing cement, sawing wood, that sort of thing. It's hard work, but they won't want to check your ID or know your National Insurance number or anything."
"You're a prat, Harry Potter," said Ginny eventually, and the insult felt inexplicably grounding, inexplicably normal.
bad at keeping stuff quiet around me. She was bursting to tell me what you talked about last night, but 'cause she couldn't she settled for hinting. I think she thinks I'm too stupid to get it."
"No! Well, in a way, but she hasn't put me up to this. Sometimes I do things all by myself, you know?"
Draco didn't come back that day, or if he did, Harry didn't see him. They ordered Harry's favourite takeaway that night, and Luna told him that Draco was moving into a new place that night.
"I can't believe you didn't tell me about Camden," said Harry to Luna, when she'd taken their orders and come back to lean against their table.
They left the room, Dean shutting the door behind him. Then Ginny began to giggle, which set Seamus off, and before they knew it they were all laughing until they cried.
Then he followed them all up to the drawing room, crossed to the drinks cabinet, and asked if anyone wanted a drink.
," said Draco, a word weighed down with fear and disgust and despair and too much history. "I don't know what you want from me, Potter, but you can't have it."
"I draw the line at selling you Westlife," he said, sliding them into the bag. "Nobody needs to please their flatmates
They'd only invoked Red Topic twice in the house. They'd invented it when a casual group discussion of Lorcan d'Eath's
spelled out in flashing green glitter. Bursting from the unused fireplace itself was an impressive floral arrangement, orange flowers nestled amongst broad ferns and greenery, and Harry noticed there were garden roses tucked into all the vases and curio boxes scattered around the room.
So it was horribly unfair, in Harry's opinion, that since their day at Camden Malfoy seemed even more determined to lean into the role of a Byronic hero. The Muggle builders seemed to call Malfoy with work all the time now, and he'd bemoan that fact in the drawing room of an evening in his paint-stained jeans, slung across a beanbag with an arm over his face. He'd complain in a transparent fashion about how he'd turned into the
Harry frowned, looking at the date. July 1995, the week before Harry's fifteenth birthday. He somewhat doubted that Lupin was on holiday with some lovely friends, then. Had he been in with the werewolves all that time?
Harry took a deep breath, resisted the urge to gently bite that smirk off Draco's face, and went to sit back down next to Ron. He carefully avoided Hermione's eye.
"And you fit right in," said Harry, patting him on the back. "Come on, you git, before I change my mind about the tea."
Harry had only a few memories of Aunt Petunia that weren't tainted by the looming spectre of Vernon Dursley. As a young child, he'd held this strange and painful urge to be near to her, coupled with the fervent desire not to be noticed and subsequently told to go away. But by the time school came around, Harry rarely saw Aunt Petunia without Uncle Vernon there, and Aunt Petunia in the company of Uncle Vernon was an Aunt Petunia he was happy to hate.
Harry gestured at the end door. Malfoy, looking as though his body were lead, pulled himself into the bathroom and shut the door.
Hermione threaded her arm through Harry's. Harry felt rather as if he were being frogmarched to his doom.
A long silence, which Harry couldn't interpret, and then Ginny muttered, "Well, serves me right for forgetting a Silencing Charm."
"No," said Dean. He leant his head against Seamus. "But I will. Mostly because I'm mad curious at this point. Never seen Malfoy like this before."
"Alright," said Harry, returning her shoulder barge. Twenty-four-seven Quidditch was obviously having an effect on her — she barely moved. "So what is it?"
Harry's thoughts went fuzzy, every part of his body attuned to the man now working his cock with messy, wet enthusiasm. He could feel his blood pounding, impossibly hard, balls drawing up already and it was too soon, he couldn't finish, he wanted to feel this forever. He pulled at Draco's hair, and Draco looked up at him with such a face of beautiful concern that he couldn't help himself from tugging him up for another kiss.
"I think it's a very noble thing for you to consider, Harry," said Hermione. "But I hope you know what you're getting into."
"No promises," said Harry, smirking at Malfoy over his coffee. Malfoy looked back at him, confused and unsure; Harry raised his eyebrows, still smiling, and something in Malfoy's shoulders eased.
She added a leaf, and then another, then began to sketch a bulb — she hadn't asked him any more questions about the art, which was good, because he really didn't know. He watched as she outlined a half-open lily, gently curving up his forearm with the tip of it pointing to his wrist. It seemed appropriate to Harry that it would be forever half-open. The real Lily had barely started her life.
"You're not really hiding anything either," he growled, and pushed the sneer off Draco's lips with lips and tongue and teeth.
His first observation was that it looked suspiciously like the beanbags were breeding, looking bigger, more numerous, and more decorated with blankets and scatter cushions. The sofas, too, were longer and plumper, yet somehow still absolutely the same, recognisable from the embroidery bees still buzzing over the arms. The polished wood floors gleamed, the old rug looked new again and twice the size, and the piano was on its own little dias, elevated. Plants Harry recognised from the garden were here now, Neville's scattered pots multiplying into great bouquets of foliage. Harry hadn't noticed before, but he realised now that Grimmauld had never been using Wizard Space, not in the whole time he'd known it, cramming itself down into the size of what was still an admittedly very spacious terrace. Now, it seemed quite happy to stretch out, settling comfortably into physical impossibility.
As well as the obvious candidates of Harry's current household, they invited George, Dean, Seamus and Hannah Abbot. Ginny, to his surprise, asked to invite Cho Chang.
"Fuck," hissed Malfoy. "Potter, what— " he looked between Harry's bleary-eyed face and his bare chest for a moment, swallowed, and then whispered: "Potter, you better tell me you have a house-elf, or else I don't think much of your sense of humour."
have one," said Hermione, while Ron pulled a dubious face behind her back. "What if you want a Muggle job? To buy a Muggle house? To use Muggle services?"
The next morning he found Kreacher in the kitchen scrubbing at the surface of the table, as though neither of them had ever left.
"I think there's a music stall," she offered, leaning over the counter to pick up a receipt. "In amongst everything else. I'm not sure where exactly."
," said Malfoy, "I am perfectly capable of enjoying normal, earthy Muggle pursuits. I don't need to be surrounded by, by glittering chandeliers and peacocks and — "
Harry gave up on his attempts at modesty. He got up to finish his charade, booed good-naturedly as Neville's team won, and carried on the celebration until he no longer cared about the night's losses, trouser-related or otherwise.
Malfoy just stared, lingering in the doorway. Harry laid out a place at the table and gestured pointedly.
Harry would not have turned anyone away, but he was secretly relieved that it was Luna asking. Her presence in the house was quiet, and she took an interest in the drawing room, which despite being one of the more functional and well-lit rooms in the house, still made Harry uneasy. Harry kept largely to fixing the kitchen and bathrooms, the bits he needed.
Malfoy snatched up his bag and swept away in one movement. The door shut behind him with a resounding crack.
Harry took another deep breath and repressed his inner Molly Weasley. He knew perfectly well how ineffective the clucking and fretting was at making Molly happy or her children compliant; it tended to make at least a few of her children do the
an addict, he might have pissed them all off," said Ron, making a move towards the kettle. Hermione pulled up a chair; Harry stayed cross-legged on the floor. "Besides, I dunno how good Slytherins really are when you're broke in a gutter."
"Now, doubtless you will find the first step to playing terribly dull and un-Gryffindor, but do try to give it a chance before you attempt to mangle three blind mice. Scales."
"The second I said no," he said, "I sort of realised I didn't want to do it. Have you ever had that?"
"Yes, thanks," he said, squirming in the knowledge that he'd been nothing of the kind. Neville beamed, but then his grin slipped a little into embarrassment. Harry, who was now familiar with this expression, slumped into a chair and smiled up at Neville.
"You're not interested in men," said Draco, as though the notion were impossible, and Harry was about to get angry with him when something caught his eye. Two men were standing on the opposite side of the road, staring. They were in Muggle dress, but they looked vaguely familiar, and as Harry watched the taller man's mouth formed the words
"No," said Malfoy, giving her a look down his nose. He paused for a moment, as everyone perked up expectantly to hear the nickname. "It was Posh boy. Or Poshy, which sounds rather dreadful to my ear, but I don't think I was working with the nation's greatest wits."
"We could have a separate area," Dean suggested. "For people who want to play. The dining room would be
Harry watched Malfoy a lot. He watched as he left for the shops with Luna, or followed Ginny to the Quidditch pitch. He watched as Malfoy came back smiling, as though the jaunt outside had been rejuvenating rather than exhausting. Harry watched for those smiles, the ones that seemed to bloom without Malfoy's permission, and realised how little he'd seen that sort of smile from Malfoy. How much of the sneering, snarling, smug and cruel expressions Harry knew were not the whole of him. Malfoy was polite and careful with them, but if they meandered into a topic he loved he went a little wild, a little manic, all wide arms and too many words per minute. It was infectious — people responded to it despite themselves, smiling or laughing or rolling their eyes, arguing back or teasing. Like it was natural.
Harry blinked at her, trying to decide if this exchange was a good or a bad thing, and what on earth she was talking about.
and not dead in the gutter, for his own amusement. And to torture my parents, of course. You know, when he wasn't literally torturing them. Or — or me. "
"You could put something on that doesn't make me want to die," said Seamus. "Put on Alanis Morissette."
"You would, wouldn't you?" said Draco, with a smirk that seemed caught between respect and alarm. "Very well, I'll ask, but I'm sure she'll say no. She hates your guts on principle, of course."
Malfoy was filling the kettle when Harry arrived, silently, in the kitchen. Malfoy turned to put it on the stove, saw him, and jumped again.
Harry suppressed another laugh. Ron went scarlet to the tips of his ears, and Hermione dropped her fork. Draco, torn between looking embarrassed and amused, shrugged one shoulder.
The sun was bright today, the sky a perfect blue, the air pleasantly cool around them. Ginny threw his broom at him, took to the air, and proceeded to thoroughly and brutally prove to him that he would never have made it as a Keeper. After an hour, they swapped roles, which was a little better for Harry, and then she challenged him to upside-down sit ups hanging off their brooms, like Wood had used to make him do. She won, and Harry watched her carry on well past victory, scarlet and sweaty and messy.
be discussing in this den of my enemies," said Draco sternly, but he didn't look genuinely worried. He looked amused, and soft in a way he didn't often look, and Harry suddenly got an acute sense of what it must have been like for Draco, all those dinners in the kitchen and games in the drawing room with references he didn't understand, in-jokes he would never be privy to.
"Try to match which fingers hit which keys." Draco's voice was soft and surprisingly patient. "Here, I'll count. One," he raised his thumb and then placed it on the C key in front of Harry. "Two, three, one, two, three, four, five." He played up the scale as he moved his hands.
"Well, thank you all for a delightful evening, please excuse us," said Draco, doing a little bow to the room. He seemed to realise he was being ridiculous, winced, and pulled Pansy out into the corridor.
"Come on, Potter," said Malfoy, looking back with a smirk on his face. "If this helps, you can do me a favour and tell people I'm on their side."
"Ooh, careful what you say," said Ellie from behind the screen, a laugh in her voice. "You'll give your boyfriend ideas."
"The Muggles have places to put people with no home and no money," said Malfoy, though he sounded offended. "I'll get a place eventually, but having no Muggle documents has posed a problem."
One rainy, dark Friday, Harry made his way downstairs to the kitchen to start dinner only to find Malfoy there already, chopping onions. His eyes were very red, his mouth downturned. Kreacher was on a chair behind him, wringing his hands.
"What use are you then?" said the man, winking at him, and began to rummage in the box. A small queue began to form behind him.
It looked old, the sweeping calligraphy at the top declaring it to be the Title Deed to 12, Grimmauld Place. He smoothed it out and read the first line.
"It's being a bad host," said Ginny, as though that trumped all potential objections. Ron nodded, as though this logic were obvious.
"Ooh, look at this," said Ginny. "Yves Saint Laurent jumper, bottle green. Which is the number you need, Dean?"
It was always magical, Christmas at the Burrow, but Harry was privately rather happy to retreat to Grimmauld with Ron and Hermione, the morning of New Year's Eve. Their peace and quiet lasted approximately an hour before Dean, Seamus, Ginny and Luna all burst back through the drawing room Floo at once, demanding to know what was happening with the New Year's Eve party. Harry, lying over one sofa with an irrepressible grin, gestured vaguely at them to do whatever they wanted to the decor and then absconded downstairs to consult with Kreacher about party food.
Harry jumped, but mercifully it was just Malfoy, coming up from the dungeons a little way behind him. Harry stuck his wand in his pocket.
a happy Draco, not like Pansy did. Harry didn't really know how Draco was doing at all. His stomach twisted.
"Oh, I'd be fine," said Malfoy blithely, his mouth curling up at the corner, glancing back at the house. "I'd get housed in some hellhole of a hostel, get some dreadful Muggle job, and when my probation was up I'd run off to France to live with mother in a state of terrible sobriety except for the occasional cigarette. She wouldn't ask any questions. She'll act like she's on holiday and Father is merely away on business. It'd be nice, peaceful. I'd get some job at the French Ministry, probably via mother acquiring blackmail material on someone important, then mother and Pansy would conspire to marry me to Astoria so she can have grandchildren, and I'd be so broken by life at that point I'd end up doing whatever the three of them say, although not before losing all my hair from the stress."
"Here." He thrust the paper bag at Draco, who pulled out the little dragon figurine with delicate fingers.
Harry helped Kreacher with the washing up, and then he paced the kitchen for an hour afterwards, telling himself over and over to go to bed but not doing anything about it. Instead, he polished the kitchen table with Kreacher's secret recipe wax, comforted by the gleam of the wood, and pretended to himself he wasn't listening for the tell-tale click of Pansy's heels on the floorboards above them.
He'd chosen a Mind Healer called Adhikari. Hermione approved of her research into traumatic memory loss so much that when Harry had read her name from his list of potentials, she'd done a little dance of excitement and launched into a description of what an amazing researcher she was. Hermione's enthusiasm was really the only reason he chose her, besides the fact that he was fairly certain she was not the same person counseling Ginny or Draco.
They abandoned all notion of heading out that weekend. Harry made pasta while the rest of the household took up positions leaning on the kitchen table, loosely under the guise of helping, although with the exception of Neville quietly chopping onions they were entirely in the way. Harry didn't mind, especially since they kept him topped up on the wine that nobody wanted to wait to open, and Ron and Ginny kept them entertained with a sibling skit over who got to sit at the head of the table, culminating in a quick-draw Stinging Hex duel which Ginny won. Harry, laughing, ruined her victory, claiming the end of the table himself. He kicked back on the chair, like Sirius used to do, and attempted to pull something that halfway resembled Sirius's trademark smirk.
Malfoy picked up his lamp and swept into the stacks, ignoring Harry's stare. Harry watched him blankly. Malfoy was going to show him
But the next shop wasn't a shop, it was a tattoo parlour. The front of it was absolutely plastered in photographs and art and rock music blared from inside, undercut by the faint noise of buzzing.
He was still at the kitchen table, on his third cup of tea, when Ron and Hermione emerged from the Floo, carrying several bags of shopping.
"Here," said Dean, pulling Harry's head forward to lean on his shoulder. Dean smelled of honey and lemon and charcoal, and Harry pressed his face into the warmth of his shoulder, trying to take deep breaths, trying to breathe through the waves of unassailable loss, intractable fury.
The household had spotted his change in mood, but as it involved him getting dressed and leaving the house more, they all seemed to assume that it was an improvement. And it was, if Harry were honest with himself; when his mind wasn't on Malfoy, his thoughts began to tentatively prod at the looming abyss that was his future. Malfoy, of course, could not be in it, except as a funny kind of friend who used to be an enemy and now only pretended to be for fun. But there were other things he wanted. To help people, that was a given. Young people, he thought, people who hadn't had a good time in life. He thought about teaching, but it seemed completely beyond him and his lack of academic motivation, and he wasn't ready to go back to Hogwarts yet. Besides, it wasn't really what he wanted. He wanted to help kids like him, kids who were made to feel worthless, kids who didn't have real family. He wanted to give them a childhood he'd never had.
"I live in a magical mansion in central London," said Harry dryly. "Let me buy you the stupid chunky trainers at least."
that made him hate himself, for thinking of something like that when Malfoy was pouring his heart out to him.
would take my word. I suppose I could write it anonymously, but if I were going to write an anonymous tell-all I don't really even have to be here at all. I could make it all up. And if I can make it all up, I can certainly write something better than
Harry sighed, hand wrapping around his Calming Charm. His head felt a bit fuzzy with drink. The bathroom lights haloed above them, blurry, as though his glasses were smudged.
Harry wondered why Malfoy was here with them — whether he'd decided there was something in what Blaise had said, about making friends with them for the social clout. Still, they were playing now, and Malfoy didn't appear to cheat, and slowly their renditions of Go Fish became more smug or spiteful, and it was almost fun by the time Seamus's victory dance was interrupted by the sound of the others downstairs.
"Badly," he said, but he played it anyway, and Harry sank his head onto Ron's shoulder and prayed for sweet release from the beautiful torture of watching Draco Malfoy caress a piano into resonant life.
He lowered his mouth, and Harry had to close his eyes against the vision of Draco Malfoy, all bedroom eyes and sharp cheekbones, closing his lips around Harry's cock.
"Er," he said, staring as Dean and Seamus disentangled themselves and sat up, both glaring. "Yes, well. I wanted to talk to Thomas. Dean. Dean Thomas. Well, all of you actually, but Dean first. If you're not busy, that is. You all look like you're having fun, I should go — "
"I promised to be a good boy," said Malfoy dryly, shaking his hand. Ernie laughed at this, loudly, and Harry turned back to Ron.
"If it's gonna turn into anyone's weird sex cult, it'd be Luna's," offered Seamus, a grin in his voice.
"Okay," said Harry, letting a low note of warning creep into his tone. "Tell me how you're a piece of work. Now, I mean, not before the war."
Then the room lit up in bright white light, a loud boom rattling through the windows, and Draco startled and pulled away, eyes wide. Harry looked at the shower of sparks behind the curtained windows, and laughed.
"Alright, stop it, guys, we all did what we had to," he said, staring down at his dinner with a slight smile. Malfoy winced at this, but he looked perhaps a little less petrified.
"I've been somewhat concerned, Draco," Blaise was saying, not sounding particularly concerned at all. "I had intelligence that you were living with a Muggle, an Ian Webb, but for the last few weeks you've been completely off the grid —"
But it was Dean, his long legs up on the chair, hands nursing a tea. Harry looked between Dean and Luna, heart still racing;
"What if this doesn't work?" said Harry nervously as they jogged briskly in the direction of the bathroom.
"That was when I thought I'd never have to see him again!" protested Harry. McGonagall gave him a look.
Harry shifted to see what he was doing, and almost regretted it at the obscene sight of it, one dripping finger sliding into him. Draco gave him a smirk.
"Right," said Harry. "I'm going to go and get the shopping. Because I leave the house. Want anything?"
"You could have asked her to join us," said Fish, emerging out of the shadow of a doorway with a grin on his face. Harry leant in, conspiratorially.
"Harry, come and say hello," said Ginny, in her 'gentle persuasion' voice — the one that would have annoyed Harry, if he were capable of feeling anything except intense discomfort.
"Then how?" Harry breathed. Draco's eyes flicked to the distant space behind Harry's head. He was so close, lashes glittering in the lamplight.
Malfoy rolled his head against the wall to look at Harry. Harry shook his head, hard. Malfoy's lip curled, disgusted, but Harry didn't think it was at him.
"When I need a laugh.” Malfoy’s eyes were still red, but sparkling now, and Harry was still holding his hand. Harry dropped it, reluctantly, and turned to leave the bathroom before his mouth said something stupid.
. Luna made him some beautiful change of address notecards with gold filigree and tiny buzzing bees in the corners, hexed to disintegrate if intercepted.
Harry looked around at his friends, overflowing with pity and kindness for a man they all had good reason to hate, and swelled with affection for all of them.
The conversation moved onto which records to put on, which Harry watched without input, feeling bitter and pathetic. Somehow, though, the argument led to Dean promising to take Malfoy to trawl record shops in Camden.
"Thanks," said Neville, giving Malfoy another uneasy look. Malfoy was absolutely rigid in his chair, white as a sheet and staring at Neville as though the man were about to eat
"And they wouldn't even fit that many people in a room," mused Harry, gazing into the distance. Then he turned to stare at her.
"Doesn't need electricity, naturally," said Draco, leaning against the wall and looking down at Harry. "I fished it out of a skip and fixed it, in case you were worried about the extravagance. I probably shouldn't have told you that, Merlin if my mother could hear me now, no manners left at all —"
"I'm only thinking of you, Draco," she said, quieter now, as though everyone wasn't listening intently. "It would give the Malfoy name something to stand upon again. And the Greengrass money will make the Manor renovations possible."
"Right," said Malfoy, looking past Harry to Dean. "Would somebody be so kind as to explain to me how the game works?"
"Do you trust me?" said the voice behind the screen, and an older woman popped her head round the panel, grinning. One side of her hair was shaved to the skin, the other side dyed in purples and pinks. Harry was painfully reminded of Tonks.
Luna slid onto the beanbag beside her to watch. "How do you know what to order, if you only see one angle?" she said, giving the catalogue a curious poke. Her and Ginny shared a 'funny old Muggles' smile, whilst Dean rolled his eyes.
Malfoy was silent for a moment, pressing his face into his knees. He heaved another, steadier breath and pulled his back up against the wall again.
Harry looked away from the piano keys. Draco's face was close, his thigh pressed warm against Harry's own. If he noticed Harry's scrutiny, he didn't show it. Malfoy brought his hands up to the keyboard and began to play every note in sequence, fingers steady and elegant. Harry swallowed.
"Absolutely," agreed Harry, grinning at her. She rolled her eyes, but he could see she was repressing a smile.
Harry forced himself to Floo call the Burrow to tell them where he was, and then he lay across a dusty chaise longue in the ugly drawing room until he had the energy to begin.
"Absolutely not," insisted Draco, but he tensed against the threat of Harry coming to test that assertion.
"Perk of being an Unspeakable," said Blaise, with a sniff. "Several years of quibbling and dithering with the Gender Identity Transfer Service promptly evaporated after my application was accepted."
"Er... Cho Chang, isn't it?" said Jack, with unusual guile for a Slytherin. Unfortunately, his housemates ruined it with their looks of dawning confusion.
than I am and how can I look that in the eye? How can I even contemplate that? Fuck, Potter, I wish you'd be a bit more horrible, just so I can
Harry turned on his heel, looking for Ginny. He knew she'd probably have the perfect training regimen to get the tense, warm feeling out of his chest.
"And yes, you're right," said Ron eventually, because he was much kinder than Harry. "She probably is deflecting. She likes to solve problems, but the War has given her problems she can't solve with logic, so she focuses on other people. But she's a smart woman, Harry, she'll figure that out eventually. We'd
, thought Harry, settling into the chair and pulling the folder towards him. He unwound the string binding, and pulled out the first document inside.
"Don't get comfy!" he said, full of wobbling joviality. "In the spirit of inter-house co-operation, I'm splitting you all up!"
"Not a substitute for therapy," said Hermione sternly. "I've brought you a list of Mind Healers who might consider putting you on their books pro bono until you're on your feet. And the address of the local NA meetings. I can't make you go, but I would consider it a fair price to pay for the benefit of what I've just given you."
Not that he cared. Seamus loved Dean and barely tolerated Malfoy, and besides, Dean had got a handle on his jealousy now. He encouraged Seamus to be who he was. So it was nothing to Harry, despite the prickle in his limbs.
Harry stared at Dean, whose focus on his notebook was intense, his sketch lines gone dark and heavy. With a deep breath, he repressed the urge to jump to Hermione's defence.
"Give me your hand," murmured Draco. Harry lifted it, and Draco poured a little lubricant into Harry's hand. Then he pushed it between them.
"Maybe you should shove it up his arse," agreed Seamus. "It's your body, Weasley, do what you like with it. You do know I was only teasing just now, right?"
"I think that makes it worse," murmured Malfoy. Harry didn't really know what that meant. Time hung for a moment, as though Malfoy were actually waiting for the invitation that was playing on repeat in Harry's mind, but then Harry shifted, and Malfoy started, and then Harry realised whatever he was hoping for was stupid and impossible and tactlessly timed, to boot.
"Do you ever wish you weren't weird?" said Harry, and immediately wanted to punch himself in the face. Luna, to her credit, just gave him a slow, gentle smile.
Harry pulled on his new blue jeans and a white v-neck t-shirt, looking at himself in the mirror. He might have made a big deal of changing but even Harry could see it made a difference. The t-shirt fit flatteringly close to his chest, flashing the necklace, and that one small detail plus the obvious newness of the outfit made everything about his look more deliberate — made Harry's stubble look designer, the long hair fashionable.
He sprayed his underarms liberally. He sniffed; it was strange, but he couldn't smell anything. Harry remembered Dudley had some truly awful stuff you could smell all through the house – maybe his wasn't working?
"Why's he not off enjoying the Riviera, anyway? Isn't that what the rest of the war criminals are doing?" said Ginny. She kicked back in her chair, arms folded.
." Kreacher stuck his nose up and made a little gesture with his elbows that Harry realised, with delight, was Kreacher doing a mocking impression of a wizard. "I is thinking it's not much of an ask for Kreacher to have
Malfoy sucked in an audible breath. Harry gave him a sideways glance; he had that pinched look on his face, the one Harry was coming to recognise as guilt.
"Alright." Malfoy set down his spoon, pulling a face at the remaining rice. "That's enough of that. Show me to my cell."
"And, um, you're sort of my charge. The others agreed to you staying on the condition that I'd be the one, you know, looking after you. If you need it."
"I still don't know. It's funny really, I spent so long knowing exactly what I was going to be doing with my life whether I wanted it or not, but now I have options I can't even begin to choose. I know more about building houses than I ever expected to, and I seem to have a rapport with House Magic, I could make a career in that if I wanted. Or I could use my skills to renovate the Manor, but I don't know if I'm… ready yet. And I want to help people, and I'm good at making things work with magic — oh, speaking of, your present, it's in the drawing room, hang on —"
"Quite," said Hermione. "Would you like to read my draft sometime, Draco? You're really the only person in the house likely to take even the slightest interest."
"Anyway, he was a proper lost little lamb," he said, waving a poppadom for emphasis. "Didn't know how any of the real world worked at all. Didn't know about the dole. Who doesn't know about the dole? Didn't know about how to talk to the council, didn't know about shelters, didn't have any fuckin' ID on him or anything. Didn't even have sensible shoes."
"Yes, I can't help but wonder the same myself," she said, twisting the toggle of her overcoat. "Do I care about justice and decency innately, or is it because my parents are compassionate people and nurtured that in me? Even if I do care innately, would I be brave enough to stand up to Voldemort? Would I even
"What's up?" said Hermione, sitting on the teacher's desk. Harry leant against a wobbly table and ran a hand through his hair.
Harry remembered asking Ron that very question one night, his whole body burning with shame. Worse, he remembered the unsettling cartoon-based books Hermione had handed him silently a few days later —
"He looks good," blurted Harry, and Ron's eyes widened. Harry stuck his face in his drink, and prayed for a merciful death.
"My apologies, I overstepped." Malfoy's tone was cold, posture stiff. When he turned away from Harry, Ginny gave him a disapproving look.
"Not yet, Harry, but I'm working on it," said Ron, giving him a wink. "Best pass training first, before I take over the whole department. Anyway, better dash."
On the first floor landing, someone had wound green bunting around the bannisters, and the corridor was filled with scattered balloons bouncing gently to themselves. The sound of the record player filtered out from the drawing room, and there were shrieks echoing up from the dining room already. Harry held on tightly to Luna as they entered the drawing room.
Still, the drink was delicious, and Ron was clearly in a cheery mood, gesturing with enthusiasm as he filled Harry in on the news of Ernie MacMillan's shock decision to become a Muggle financier, and how unbelievably boring it sounded.
to say it. Sometimes it comes out before I can stop it. I've been chastised so many times, told I need to be
"Nah," said Dean, stabbing a piece of curried chicken with his fork. "I just wish he'd man up and face us. Get it over with. I need to know if he still acts like he needs a punch in the face."
