"You bet!" With that, she trotted down the steps and Harry turned back into the room just as Jason slid past him with a mumbled, "Night, Mr Potter."
! We don't always get to choose who we fall in love with."
"'Valiantly sacrificed?'" Malfoy read aloud and made a scoffing sound, but the splash of colour over his cheeks belied his mockery. He was pleased, and Harry was happy for him. "All I did was push the idiot out of the way of falling debris. It was a spur of the moment decision. And a stupid one."
Each time their eyes had met, the Potter had flushed scarlet and looked away, finally earning a suspicious glare or two from Granger, who had turned it immediately on Draco, who had pretended not to notice.
Hermione was waiting in Harry's office.
~~~~*~~~~
Draco broke the kiss and patted a dazed Harry on the rump. "No time for that, Potter. We have a spell to fix."
Harry decided it was because he had not been involved in the planning process this time. In fact, he had not been involved at all. He suspected several of the girls were behind the latest edition of the Gryffindor/Slytherin war, because it was not likely any of the boys would have thought of it. If Harry had known, he would certainly have put a stop to it.
snatched the wand from his hand.
Harry walked inside and was fairly stunned at the changes. The front hall was finished and gleamed with highly polished blond wood. A sparkling multi-faceted chandelier hung over their heads and a patterned rug—Persian, most likely—muffled their footsteps. The walls were complete and now delineated both parlour and dining room.
Unwilling to divulge the type and amount of bacteria found in everyday drinking water, Harry pointed ahead on the path. "Look! Is that a peacock?"
Back to the subject at hand, however, he told me he'd done plenty of digging into Jacob's background (I already mentioned he knows everything about everyone) and he apparently had some big plans that he hadn't the funds to complete. Jacob had planned to get his hands on some of the Malfoy holdings and use them to his own benefit, thinking the family had so much that they wouldn't even notice. I admit, I had that own idea not long ago. It's wrong, of course. As Malfoy said, "If it involves a Malfoy, not a single coin changes hands that we don't know about." I suppose it's how they've stayed rich all this time, even though the war and the reparations payments afterwards.
It seemed to take forever to shake off the damned Stunner, but Harry finally managed it—thankful he'd managed to hold onto his wand—and then staggered after Zabini and Parkinson's captors. A simple Scent Detector Charm allowed him to follow the faint trail left by Parkinson's perfume. It was a useful spell and most criminal sorts did not even realise they could be followed by their cologne.
Harry scowled, but had to admit that Ron was right. Lately, Hermione and Draco had been speaking in such a convoluted fashion—discussing runes, ritual magic, and spell theory—that Harry found himself drifting off into a sleepy daze much of the time. It was easy to see why both he and Ron were feeling apprehensive.
"I can't let all of these other people die!"
The shrill voice jolted Harry from a deep sleep and he opened his eyes to muted darkness. He breathed in a familiar, pleasant scent, interlaced with other, unfamiliar fragrances, and felt the slide of skin against skin as a warm body next to his shifted. It took him a bewildered moment to remember where he was.
"What do you have against my flat?"
She tucked her wand into her belt and loosened the stopper on the vial. It released from the bottle with a small pop and she slipped the cork into a pocket. Maeve reached up and Draco felt her cool hand on his jaw, prying it open. The vial was warm against his lower lip.
She turned to glare at Malfoy and Harry blinked when he noticed the other side of her face. A huge birthmark covered most of her right cheek. It was a deep reddish colour and looked almost like a handprint. "I already went over this with the cops. Don't you have the bloody police report?"
"Where the hell are we?"
"No, Harry," Remus said quickly. "We love being here with you and we'll gladly stay as long as you'll have us. We just want to be sure we haven't worn out our welcome, as it were."
Draco lay still and concentrated, trying to ignore the rain tapping endlessly upon him. He seemed to be bound with ordinary ropes rather than magical ones. Foolish woman. He began to work on the knots whilst muttering the words to a loosening spell.
"Tanner wants to see you."
Mulciber laughed, an irritating, slightly insane-sounding titter. "Oh yes, I have, haven't I? And you know why, don't you, Draco? Don't you
—enveloped it completely in hot wetness.
Mark blinked at him and looked down at the chess pieces that remained. "Oh. Well, it only comes out when I drink. And sometimes when I want to impress a bloke." His gaze snapped to Draco's again and he flashed a grin.
"Three down and…fifty seven to go," Kay-Kay said cheerfully. Seamus groaned.
"Did you approve? That was the day I finally knew that you wanted me as much as I wanted you. You were so flustered, it was adorable. I was going to kiss you in that gazebo and then take you inside and make love to you in Anton Beauvoir's bedroom."
"Harry, reach up and grab that one above you. If you and Malfoy hold it steady, we should be able to climb on easily."
Avoiding Malfoy didn't work out as planned. The arsehole marched into my office first thing this morning and started yelling at me about being an inconsiderate jerk for leaving without sending word, as though I needed to check in with him before I made a move. I managed to hold my tongue and simply regarded him coldly whilst he ranted. Then I asked if he were finished. When he nodded, I turned back to my work and ignored him until he stalked out. I don't think he was truly angry when he entered, but he certainly was when he left. Serves him right.
Harry smiled at him and Draco smiled back. "Are you going to…?" Harry asked and shifted.
Harry stopped pushing the button, which hadn't worked anyway, as the lift started moving again. He turned to Mary contritely. "Sorry," he said. "Want me to um… cast a Cleaning Charm?"
"They never reconciled, Lucius and Draco. By the time we realized it was fatal, Lucius could no longer communicate. Draco believed… he still believes, that Lucius despised his choices. In truth, Lucius was very proud of him." A tear trickled down her cheek and Narcissa lifted a hand to brush it away with a wan smile. "But coming from a mother, those words mean little to a boy desperate for approval. Draco needed to hear it from Lucius. And now he never will." She replaced Draco's hand on the bed and rose to pour a glass of water from the chilled pitcher on the bedside stand. She took a drink and offered the pitcher to Harry, who shook his head.
"Did that upset you? Used to being the centre of attention, and all."
"He could still be setting up this whole thing. Hell, he could be the one paying Rosier."
Parkinson whooped.  "Nice arse, Potter!" she catcalled.
"You see, Potter? There is always time for tea."
"People are not always who you think they are," Harry offered. "I should go. I'll leave my Floo open for you, in case you have additional information. Or questions."
Harry felt a pang, a bit stunned that his spell had gone so far awry. Bits of paper still fluttered in the air. "They don't--"
Tanner's brows shot up and his entire face went red. Harry would have laughed aloud if Malfoy hadn't sounded like he was struggling to breathe. He was most likely fighting not to hex Harry on the spot.
Harry could not prevent his jaw from sagging open, not only at the words, but at the friendly, sincere-sounding tone. Malfoy's eyes sparkled, betraying the lie. Harry shot to his feet and glared at Malfoy. "Very funny. I'll go tell them to narrow the search. Also, you're an arsehole."
Potter froze as Draco positioned the cushion until Potter’s abdomen lay upon it, effectively taking Draco’s place.  Draco moved quickly behind Potter and knelt between his still-spread legs.  He used his thumbs to lever Potter’s cheeks open, earning a gasp when he mercilessly gripped the reddened, bruised flesh.
"Got bored with it."
Malfoy waltzed in as casual as you please this morning, bringing tea and crumpets and asking about my trip. He even wore the scarf I'd bought him. Of course, I was instantly suspicious and wondered what he was up to. I didn't ask, of course, or he would have got defensive, so I just waited until he revealed his plot, which I still haven't quite determined. He asked me to have dinner with him tomorrow evening to get my opinion on something he is working on. I've learnt not to ask an Unspeakable anything work-related and Malfoy in particular, so I agreed. I admit I'm curious.
They were tired enough to stick to business, so in less than twenty minutes they lay in Harry's bed, clean and slightly damp. Draco's head lay on Harry's chest and he listened to the slow thump of Harry's heart. Harry's hand idly brushed his shoulder. Draco had never known such contentment. It still amazed him at times, when he allowed himself to analyze it.
He sat gingerly and wondered what the fuck he was supposed to hold on to.
He couldn't. It was nearly midnight and they both had classes the next day. Besides, Potter had promised he would return.
"Thank God… but you already loved me."
"No! In truth, Draco, I'm the one using Ministry resources for personal gain. You are definitely not a suspect and I could get in serious trouble." Potter put out a hand and pressed it against the wall next just above Draco's shoulder. He leaned closer and Draco watched as a bead of sudsy water followed the curve of his cheek and then paused at the edge of his stubble-covered jaw. "Serious. Trouble."
Feeling pleased with himself, Harry turned to go, but a sleepy voice stopped him in his tracks. "Harry?"
Draco watched as Harry turned away with a cough, not-subtly attempting to hide his laughter. Shacklebolt leant back in his chair and massaged his temples with both hands whilst heaving a great sigh. "Malfoy, I will never stop cursing the day you walked through the doors of this building."
George lifted a brow. "Ron used it, then?"
The ballroom was filled with small cliques. Draco made note of key patterns for future reference; Darrington was hovering far too close to Appleby's current mistress—that could be useful for later blackmail—and Sampson was already drunk. It was likely he'd arrived that way, the idiotic sot. If Draco'd only had the time, he would have attempted to extract some insider Quidditch information from him. There was always money to be made if one knew which players were injured or were about to leave one team for another. Draco sighed; business before business.
The Slytherins were more open about it, of course. Harry snarled at the unfairness. Malfoy had been the one to cancel the damned Shield Charm, and yet no one was calling
"Not officially. I'm on indefinite leave, remember?"
, if Draco was any judge, and he was—and a black cloak. His ugly glasses had been replaced with lighter silver frames that seemed to highlight his green eyes. Potter's hair, thank Merlin, was still unruly, and far too long to be fashionable.
"Fuck, that was hot," Potter said.
Potter cleared his throat and Draco raised his head to see the Gryffindor standing behind the couch. The sight of his bare flesh made Draco's brows shoot upward. Potter blushed nearly scarlet. "The thing is… I haven't figured out how to change back with my personal effects. My clothes and my wand always disappear. I always find my wand in the Gryffindor dorm next to my bed, but my clothes… I don't know where they go."
"I suppose not." He cast a spell on one mug and the tea leaves rose from the water, spun in the air for a moment, and vanished. "Sugar?"
"Your attempt at small talk could be a way to get me to provide you with information to assist in learning who I am, in the event you are bluffing. But to answer your question, I sent Crabbe after you to prove that I could, to assure you that you are no threat to me. In fact, you are less than nothing."
"I can't leave you out here, Eroe," Draco said. "I've no spare mews and if I put you in with one of the others, they'll likely tear you to pieces. I'll decide what to do with you in the morning."
"One down, and one to go," Draco whispered. His fingers were crawling slowly up Harry's ribcage.
"You are grasping at straws, Malfoy. Your criminal activity has made you paranoid."
Saturday, 8.5.2004
Seamus straightened his desk and then shucked his Auror robes and pulled on a brown cloak. "Still raining out there?"
Harry lowered his glass and prepared to smile, until his gaze was drawn to the woman at Malfoy's side. She looked elegant and polished and every inch an excellent match for Malfoy. The drink Harry had consumed suddenly tasted like dust.
Harry woke to find the house empty, which seemed bizarre. He didn't expect either Parkinson or Draco to be morning people, and yet they were already gone despite the early hour. There was no note and he tried not to be alarmed, wondering where they had gone. He wasn't Draco's keeper, after all, and the man was obviously quite good at taking care of himself.
Now I feel completely wrecked and I have no idea how to make any of it better.
"Bloody hell," he said.  "My hand is aching.  I should have specified a riding crop or paddle."
"I am never drinking again."
Harry nearly dissolved into laughter, but he kept tickling and managed to manoeuvre himself between Malfoy's legs, which suddenly whipped up and wrapped around his back. A swift twist later and Harry was the one flat on his back with a smirking Malfoy sitting astride him.
Draco repeated the words twice more, until Harry thought his bones might liquefy. The heat of Draco's fingers seemed to burn into Harry's and he leaned back into Draco's chest, unable to stop himself.
flavour you'd be and hilariously inaccurate divined fortunes, surely predicting your untimely demise every other month.
She glanced at the charmed sundial on the wall again, noting it had been another eight minutes since she last looked. It was most unlike Draco to keep her waiting, and she felt more than a little rankled at the growing possibility he may stand her up.
Gather 'round me lads and lasses: sit ye for a time,
A loud sniff from Draco drew Pansy out of her thoughts. She looked at him properly now, and noticed that he had dissected both a smoked salmon and a brie and cucumber sandwich into their component parts, and crumbled most of a sablé beurre into a pile of fine crumbs. The ice in his gin and tonic was all but melted.
The worst part of it all—the biggest injustice—was that not a single person had bothered to ask her what she wanted. Whether children had even factored into her life's plan. Whether she was even considering that journey for herself. It was just
"Speaking of counterintuitive," Pansy interrupted, taking a short drag, "I don't see the appeal in clothes that are meant to be normal-sized suddenly being miniature. It looks like the house elves snuck a finger or three of Ogdens and made a complete balls-up of their laundry charms." She waved her cigarette emphatically. "Designer fashions are meant to be worn proudly and marvelled at, not soiled and sicked-up upon by miniature humans having unrepentant disregard for the atrocities they commit."
With ire on the Quidditch pitch, they play a crackin' match,
Shaking her head Pansy added, "Just keep telling yourself that, someday it'll come true."
They insisted on sharing their every excited wish for power, every foreseen opportunity for glory, and every other banal idea they had in mind for the future of their progeny. They fussed and fawned over their beloved's every movement. And they were very forward in stating how she would be so fortunate when she had her own children by virtue of all this glorious experience. How she would be certain to raise them
"I find the miniature clothes utterly adorable myself," Draco beamed. "Potter does too. He's already started buying—"
Pansy sighed as she flipped the page of her
get hangovers. Besides which, you've had to cancel your share too; and in some quite dubious circumstances, need I remind you?"
The sexual tension in the air would give ye a wet snatch.
A waiter arrived at their table with napery, cutlery and sparkling water. "Good morning Miss Parkinson, Mr Malfoy," he said smoothly, as the table setting arranged itself around them. "Lovely to see you again. What will you have today? May I suggest the—"
In the opinion of one Pansy Parkinson, springtime was wonderful.
"Stow it, Malfoy," she quipped, "and don't talk to me about people being 'dramatic'. I tell you,
People who had got themselves into a godawful state of discomfort and malaise—and wilfully so in most cases!
Draco snorted. "Unlikely they'll want to do that, but there are worse things that could happen than having seven children running around the house."
Throughout the eighth year common room a charmed tin whistle's merry tune cut the air. Seamus Finnigan stood by the fire smiling gleefully. He coughed, and then sang...
The first one's name is Potter: a right delightful boy,
They fled the room quite quickly, robes trailing off their arms,
Often they'd be found a-trading insults in the hall,
She flashed him a wicked grin, waving for the waiter. "As if that was even possible!"
He's seldom off his Quidditch broom 'cause it's his favourite toy.
Maybe more for the fun times she'd had at Hogwarts. Considerably more so after Third Year when they were allowed to visit Hogsmeade, and she could smuggle sweets and other contraband back to the Castle.
She watched Draco open his mouth, only to close it again, his brows intensely knitted.
But only to be happy that they're in each other's arms.
Draco nodded and hummed in agreement. "A self-disassembling anything does sound rather counterintuitive, though it might make—"
The second one is Malfoy: of pureblood does he be,
It be quite strange, how time has changed, the way that they once felt.
"Keep me waiting while you shop, will you?" Pansy snapped, cutting him off. An opportunity to wind Draco Malfoy up was never to be squandered. "I don't ask much, really, just punctuality for our brunch on the third Saturday of the month." She blew a thin line of smoke toward him, teasing it into a pink and silver helix with her wand. "The same one we've had since graduation?"
Pansy growled fiercely pulling the expended cigarette butt from its holder. She flicked it away and it vanished into the air, leaving a thin trail of silver smoke in its wake. "Pregnant!" she exclaimed, "and you think that's a
Looks rather like a ferret, behaves like quite a prat,
The waiter again gave a curt nod of his head by way of acknowledgement. "Of course. Please enjoy," he said as he left.
Draco looked tired and more than a little flustered.
T'was plain to all of us that that there was maybe something more.
Gather 'round me lads and lasses: sit ye for a time,
"Take your time. Please trust me. I will never despise you. I love you. will you trust me not to despise you at least? "
"Toffee."
"Look. He told us a bit of his past. The people he lived with were horrid and he will understand. It's not my story to tell but they really were horrible to him. He is a good man and powerful enough to help us and - and your mother."
Draco took her to Florean Fortesque instead of the candy shop because he knew that children prefer ice creams. He wanted her to loosen up a bit so that she would tell him everything. He entered the ice cream parlour, her small hands in his as he searched for a table which was not surrounded by many people. They ordered their ice creams and sat down. She seemed happy with her choice and told him that he ice cream was absolutely delicious. Her excitement delighted him.
"BRING HER BACK." She shouts and Lucius has cast silencing charms around the room. But he is afraid that they will collapse if she continues screaming like this.
They came inside and sat in front of him. Ron was the first one to murmur "We were not the ones Harry. You know us better than that. Moreover, we were with you after the trial, trying to search him."
Meanwhile, her stance becomes normal and she mumbles, "I have nightmares. Can't sleep alone."
After a few minutes, she murmurs, "He molested her but he didn't stop at that. He was rough with her. He hit her. He crucioed her too and I think that he cast an imperious on her as well."
"It's Potions Master Malfoy for you, Albus." Mr. Zabini says harshly. His eyes are steeled and his body is stiff with tension as he continues, "Do you even know the meaning of love. This is not love. What you are doing - wait a minute-"
"He gave all the exams." Black said in a low, dangerous voice.
She finishes her speech and then starts laughing. Draco smirks when Ginny's own brothers cast incarcarous on her and her eyes widen in shock. Suddenly, her entire family is standing in front of her, their wands pointed at her and she glares venomously at everyone.
. Anyone but him." Draco said and leaned forwards, his hands joined on the table in front of him, "Even Ronald Weasley would do."
"More. Bring more." Had it just been Draco's hand or leg, they might not have required so much water, but Draco's whole body was red and he needed to act immediately. So they poured more water and Draco screamed in pain. Harry's heart ached. It was a torture for him. Inside, he was falling apart but he had to be the strong one here. Atleast Draco had come to him before it was too late.
Five days had elapsed and nothing had changed. Nothing Harry did could bring unconstrained happiness on his face. It seemed that his past did not stop haunting him. He had known that something would go wrong. One could just call it a feeling. He had a very strong feeling today and he had taken time to look at Draco before leaving their bedroom. Draco had sat near the window, staring at the sky quietly and he looked beautiful. His hair were unkempt and he was still in his nightclothes. Harry had placed Draco's breakfast on the bed. Draco had slept late again. He had a target and had to complete it.
"Malfoy." She spoke again but he couldn't answer. His knees felt week and he fell upon them.
Draco did not understand anything. He didn't understand this version of Potter who was donning heavy gowns that looked pretty but out of place on her, seeming like someone had forced her to wear them or Ronald who was ignoring the fact that his best friend was probably - unhappy with being groped or this Granger who was ignoring both of her best friends.
Thank god for small mercies that Ron is snoring. He heads towards his bed and sits on the edge, staring at the floor. A couple of minutes later, he lays down it and places his hands behind his head. Unable to sleep, he stares at the ceiling unseeingly. He shouldn't want to protect Draco after what he just saw. He shouldn't care. He shouldn't love him except that he does. He can't help it.
Half an hour later, they are ready and Draco presses a soft kiss on Harry's mouth before looking into his startled eyes quietly. He is actually relieved that they will be sleeping on separate beds until he wants otherwise and he is astonished that Harry actually decided to do this. He kisses Harry's forehead softly and embraces him.
" Okay " Harry said and Draco placed his head on Harry's shoulder. Harry could clearly see that Draco was upset and something was stopping him from revealing everything to Harry. He would try again and again and he will keep on trying until Draco told him.
Harry was looking at him and he walked towards the man's bed. Harry made space for him and he sat down beside Harry. For a few minutes, they just looked at each other.
"Noooo." The scream startled her so much that she shot up in her bed. Her right hand went underneath her pillow to get her wand and left went towards her scabbard that hung on the side of her bed to grab her sword.
Harry takes a deep breath and pulls his chair back. Scorpius does too and Harry walks closer to the boy. He places both his hands on Scorpius's shoulders and looks deep inside his eyes.
"So you came." He jumped when Harry's small and pained voice reached him. The first emotion that assaulted him was anger which transformed into grief a few seconds later.
She is always upto something, always on the move. The only time she is quiet is when she is sleeping and that happens only at night.
Harry snarled "Of course you think that I am concerned about – about the fact that these scars will remind me of your past. You stupid asshole, why DID YOU NEVER TELL ME ABOUT THESE?"
By the end, his face was wet with tears and kissed Draco's forehead softly. Draco slept peacefully. Dreamless sleep was doing it's work and Harry dragged himself out of the room before closing it. He could not sleep now. He had to find a mind healer who would be discreet enough to not rat out Draco's secrets to the prophet.
"Let's leave, Harry." Draco whispered, his silver eyes looking into his trustfully and Harry's breath hitched for a moment. He nodded and turned towards the crowd "Please leave us be."
The desperation that he often went through reared its head again and Draco's eyes must have been transparent because Harry’s intense eyes bore into his. His hair was wet and water droplets slid down his body. Draco wanted to lick them and Merlin he wanted something that was completely impossible because how could Harry cleanse him.
A second had passed before when he was shoved off. Draco yelped and sat back on his knees, stunned beyond belief, staring at Harry who was wiping his lips. His green eyes were angry and were full of desire. He just stared at Harry for a few moments before speaking, "What's wrong with you?"
Severus looks quietly at her before leaning forward and placing his hands on the table, "Have you spoken to their father?"
While Draco is busy getting over his shock, Harry takes a moment to look at Draco's handsome face. He has soft blonde hair. He has silver eyes and a pointed chin. His lips are red and his face is flawless. Snape has arrived but Harry doesn't look away from Draco.
"HARRRYYY." He shouted but got no answer so he tried again "Harry get up. You are kidding are you not? I know that I fucked up and I am sorry." He shook Harry's chest and whispered frantically "Harry please. Harry. I am so sorry. I will never repeat it again." But Harry did not answer. He lay their like a rag doll.
When she doesn't answer him and just keeps on looking at him, he whispers, "I can try to comfort you but I can't make it go away. I can reduce it but you have to let me."
"Thank you." She murmurs. Harry stares at Draco's frozen form. What's he doing? This's not fair to Ginny.
Harry belonged to her and her alone and she would get him back at any cost.
Harry stammers out a reply, "I wasn't obsessed-"
"I –" hiccup "sold myself-" hiccup "and then and then, you came and rescued me and – and they were with you." Some things were still untold. For example, who were they and how had Draco already tasted betrayal at their hands. But he kept quiet and let Draco speak.
They were presently apparating to the venue. Severus had also got an invitation but had said that he will arrive with Lupin.
"Do you trust her?" Draco asked and Harry nodded. "Will you remain with me during the check up?" Harry nodded again and Draco asked the last question "Will Weasley have to stay in the room as well?"
Harry tries to get out of his grip but the man flicks his wand and binds Harry's hands behind his back.
She looks at him with a tiny smile and sad eyes, "I'll live. The Dursleys couldn't kill me. Nor could Voldemort. Rejection surely won't. I have made my mind. Nothing will change it now. You saw what happened to Tracie today. I know that Ariana is a veela. I can't risk her getting closer to Scorpius. You know that family. How can I do this to my daughter? I must save her. I must do anything to save her."
"What the hell do you want me to do?" He hissed at him angrily.
"Did you make the connection?" He asks.
He knocks the door.
She smiled, "Then, I'll never come back. Not until the Malfoys are here. Will you speak to Malfoy?"
Harry shakes his head and mutter blankly, "Just take him away."
"I am giving this vial to you. Drink it once you reach the Dursley's home. I'll inform your relatives about your decision. I'll talk to them-"
"You can't even
"Malfoy is currently resting in one of my guest rooms and I would like to know why. He's injured." Harry finishes and is satisfied to see the change in Snape's face. His eyes widen and his jaw drops in shock.
, headmaster."
Every second that elapsed was an hour for him. He knew that Granger would do everything in her power to save Harry.
The laugh belonged to Fred, as was evident from the gold earring that he wore in his right ear. Potter was sitting between the twins today. Actually, she was
Those people who fucked him ruthlessly and without preparation, who called him a cunt, a whore, a worthless, good for nothing slut went to there home, slept with there wives, played with there children.
"I am here." A voice reaches her ears and a very cautious looking Harry walks in. An elf trails behind him, a tray of tea and some snacks in his hands.
The board of the school claimed that he was not a good influence on students. With time on his hands, he had nothing but to look at the walls and the old photos.
Harriet huffed, slamming her hands on the table, "Set everything to right."
While he prepared eggs for Harry and himself, he pondered over Harry's aggressive behaviour and wondered why he had never noticed before.
A knock on the door brought her back from her musings and for the first time, she realised that she wasn't in her bedroom. She looked around. There was a wardrobe but it was black instead of brown and slightly larger too. There was a mirror and it did not have the crack that her mirror had. Even the windows were larger than her windows.
He can literally feel the pain that she is feeling. It's written all over her face. It's evident in her trembling fingers. It's evident in the bruises that are still there on her neck. It's obvious from the fact that she doesn't want to eat anything, that she doesn't want to talk to her own mother. The corner of her lip is still scarred and her cheeks have bruises too.
"Harry, who are you speaking to?" He heard Draco's soft voice and knew that the trio's unexpected arrival was going to ruin everything. What he had not known was that Draco would do something completely unexpected and out of the way.....
However then Pansy murmurs, "Aguamenti" and a stream of cold water starts falling over his head. He screams and sits up, completely drenched in cold water. Blaise is leant against the wall, smirking at him, his arms crossed over his chest. Pansy is seated on Blaise's bed, examining the nails of her left hand, while her wand is in her right one.
"I never wanted them to touch me ever. But I sold myself willingly and it is a sin. I can not forgive myself for it. It is all my fault. Had I not been ignorant of the muggle world, I would never have resorted to such measures. I do not even remember their faces clearly. But I remember their words and their hands and their roaming dirty eyes make me feel so dirty. Sometimes I can feel them dropping some money on my chest and my chest burns. It's so degrading." Draco paused for a few seconds and then continued "Sometimes I can not breathe. When I lie down, I can feel them on me and - and in- inside me, pinning m-me-" Draco stopped after this and Harry tried to calm his racing heartbeats.
- Draco of this dimension was wearing a potions master's robes and was staring at him open mouthed and Draco knew that if he did not move immediately, either Harry Potter and or potions master Draco would curse him.
Had been forced into prostitution or fooled by someone into it. Why he never contacted Severus? Yes he had been banished from Britain but he could have contacted someone, anyone, his friends or Severus even Harry.
Petunia slumps on the couch, her eyes terrified as they fall on Vernon, "We haven't even thanked him properly yet. I - I will never be able to forgive myself if something happens to him."
"I can take care of myself Potter." Draco mutters haughtily, attempting to lighten his mood but fails. The terror is still there and Harry closes his eyes and turns around. Draco wishes he could empathize with him. he wishes he could know what Harry was feeling right at this moment but he doesn't think he can understand it completely.
"Don't talk in riddles." Draco snaps rather impatiently.
His eyes were glued firmly on Draco who was looking at the scattered broken bottles and old pizza boxes and dirty dishes. When he turned back towards him, his eyes were full of restrained fury.
Harry walked softly towards him and knelt down on his knees. With soft hands he parted Draco's arse cheeks and looked at his anus. Harry touched it and Draco uttered a sound that could be a surprised moan.
"From what I know, your friends and you used to despise Lucius Malfoy at Hogwarts because he was a death eater. Would you like to tell our readers why Mr. Malfoy decided to forsake you-know-who's cause?"
Warning: Groping without consent
"I'm hungry." His voice is unsure and blank as he mutters a moment later, "Let's go and have lunch. I've a message for you from aunt Hermione. Let's go to that new Chinese restaurant."
Petunia opens her mouth to say something but nothing escapes from it. A sob wracks her frame when she realizes that this child will never meet his mother. Petunia was supposed to protect Lily like she had promised she will.
"Malfoy." A blank voice calls him and turns Draco's world upside down because the voice belongs to Harry sodding Potter who's supposed to be dead. He doesn't know what actually happened. Unlike Draco, Potter became an auror straight after graduating. Everyone was very tight-lipped and even Skeeter didn't publish anything useful. All that the general population including Draco knew was that Potter had lost control over his magic during an assignment and had blown an entire village. It was a small village but the explosion had led to deaths of several muggles and had gravely injured many others. Somehow, his partner had escaped unscathed. Draco doesn't remember who Potter's partner was. Consequently, Potter's wand was snapped and he was banished from wizarding world. It had happened a decade ago.
Draco told them and they laughed. They laughed so much that their faces became really red and Draco couldn't resist joining them. He wished he could tell Potter - Harriet Potter about this encounter. Of course, that wasn't possible - not anytime soon - seeing that they couldn't go five minutes without snapping at each other. Draco sighed, closing his eyes.
But right now, he had eyes for Harry only.
Sirius looks at Harry for a few moments. The tense silence is broken by Snape, "It's not that easy. You can't just go there and bring her back."
Draco kneels in front of the black lake and looks at his reflection. His robes are dirty and his eyes are tired. His hair is a mess, the strands sticking every which way. This is not how he should go for his interview and that too when the the interviewer is Harry Potter, the youngest and enigmatic headmaster of Hogwarts. But Draco has no alternative. Around twenty hours have passed since Draco slept and he is running on a small bowl of mashed potatoes that he ate around seven hours ago. Pansy didn't let him take even a robe and he couldn't beg for one from Blaise even if the man
He had two options now. Either he could accept Mark's offer and return but that would be a death for him or he could ignore the words and carry on. That would equate death too because Harry would gradually receive the photos and would leave him alone. Harry would break and would never be able to accept him back and Draco couldn't live without Harry. He loved him so much. He couldn't breathe without Harry. He couldn't exist. He couldn't let anyone else touch him except Harry.
"Lure him to the Three Broomsticks, preferably alone."
"Harry. You should not have hidden it in the first place." He spoke and Harry screamed "Stupefy."
"Umm. I will start reading it then." He spoke and Harry nodded.
"Stand up and face me. I will look into your eyes and cast the spell and then I will extract your memories and store them in my vault." He says. Harry nods again and faces the man.
"I will kill you and you know what, she is present in this room and she is watching you. I will destroy you and I will not just kill you. I will torture you and I will kill you only when you beg for death." Draco stares at Potter. This means that she had been right. Potter had known that she will want to see this.
He insists and she grins, "That's what I said. Professa."
He was on the twentieth stair when everything revolved around him. He blinked and tried to clear his muddled mind but nothing would stop. So he tried to step down the stairs. When he looked down, the stairs seemed to move.
"No-one."
"I will just-" Scorpius starts.
Albus shakes his head sadly and starts, "I can't tell you. She forbade me and I can't afford to loose her trust. I can't leave her alone. She has no-one except her mother and me. Do you understand dad? I can't let her down. If this doesn't go well - if even you can't help her, then no-one can. You are my last hope, She refuses to even talk to others. She won't speak to even headmaster Snape."
He clears his throat and reveals himself. The girl lowers her head very abruptly and he frowns in confusion. Albus's fingers are wrapped tightly around hers.
If Ron and Hermione really despise Scorpia and Malfoy, then he would just have to give them an earful. He would loose his oldest friends but he refuses to go against his principals. Albus loves Scorpia and loving someone isn't a crime.
"Draco." He heard Narcissa whisper from a distance. Draco's body had not healed completely yet. No one could touch him. Not because they were not allowed. Hermione had given the numbing ointment to Harry and Harry had applied it. No they were too scared or perhaps disgusted to touch Draco. Narcissa and Lucius were scared perhaps and he did not know about Remus. He wondered why Remus had turned white when he had seen Draco's body. Harry had noticed something akin to fear in Remus's eyes before they turned blank again. He heard something fall on the floor and opened his eyes.
"What the fucking hell is all this? Why have you turned my home into a dustbin?" Draco asked him and it was obvious that he had barely stopped himself from yelling. 'MY' that Draco had just spoken did not escape Harry turned insides warm.
"But they-" Draco stared and Hermione interrupted, casting a spell on his left and right nipple "We will talk about it when you are comfortable. This is not the right time. We are your friends. I -" She cleared her throat and her eyes welled. Draco stared at her and Harry stared too as she wiped her eyes with a tissue paper, whispering "I am sorry for not noticing earlier. Ron is sorry too. He really considers you his family Draco. he has, since you married Harry. In fact, he was the who burned the divorce papers with professor Snape. Just know that you are not alone in this. We want you to heal and you have to express your pain to heal, Draco."
They only watched as the Fred wrapped an arm around Potter's shoulders. She was still in her off-shoulder gown so his hand rested on her forearm. He wrapped his other hand around her stomach, pulling her close to him. She smiled tightly.
"Look Potter. I think that Lucius, Black and I should come with you with aurors and half of the DA and Albus must stay at Hogwarts with aurors and the other half because the dark lord would ask his death eaters to attack Hogwarts. Lupin must gather werewolves if he can and follow us. You will head straight towards Draco under your invisibility Cloak and give a portkey to her. I got Lily and Potter's house in Godric's Hollow cleaned and furnished for you. It's warded and has protection charms around it. I have already sent three elves and Miss. Granger over there. They will help her. She knows the required healing spells and charms and potions." Snape murmurs in a calm and soothing voice. It calms Harry a bit. His fingers are not trembling now. They have a plan and if everything goes well, it will be finished today.
“It’s our newest dark detector model. I saw you liked the last one, so thought I’d give you our latest version. This one can go underwater and all!” Ron said while eyeing the object himself. Harry turned it in the morning light, admiring the bug-like design. the body of it looked more sleek, less clunky than the one Ron had used in Hogwarts. This ones’ wings were sleeker too, smoother. Harry also noticed a small red light, like that of a camcorder, emitting from the front of the body, like one large bug eye.
Harry raised an eyebrow, impressed. He stored the detector safely back in its box and grabbed his glass of port, smiling.
“The Ministry.” they clinked their drinks together, the rich red colour of the port swirling around both glasses. Harry leaned back in his chair and watched the rest of the Weasley’s open their gifts.
“Merlin, Harry, how did I not know about this place?” Malfoy said, gazing around the room. Harry walked over to the taps and leaned over, turning the faucets so that water spilled out of each of them, all the different colours and smells swirling together in the bottom of the pool.
“We don’t have much time. This was only what they sent to collect me. I’m not sure how many there are now.”
“You have something of mine.” Draco took another step, fully entering Harry's dimly lit room, casting a shadow behind him into the hall.
Harry shook his head and sighed.
CRACK
“Did you find it then?” Harry said. Malfoy just looked at Harry, pointedly.
A few moments passed, Harry’s breathing finally returning to normal. He shrugged off his backpack, which slumped open on the pebbles in front of him. Harry glanced down, and a glimmer of red caught his eye. Harry frowned and reached in, pulling out a small, snitch - like object. It was the dark detector. A rush of adrenaline pulsed through Harry, who fumbled with it for a second. Damn it, how did this thing work? He turned it over in his hands, until he spotted a small key like protrusion on its underside. Harry grasped it, turning it experimentally. It felt like a wind up mechanism as it slipped slightly when he loosened his grip, so harry wound the key until it would go no further. He paused, and remember the image of Ron whispering into his one a few months ago. Feeling a bit stupid, but knowing he had no other ideas, he brought the dark detector to his lips and whispered “find out whatever is in that lake.” Almost immediately the detector’s wings started flapping like a dragonfly’s, and forced its way out of Harry’s grip. He grimaced as he watched the object pelt towards the lake, preying Draco wouldn’t see it, but as soon as it reached the shore it dived, and disappeared into the water with the tiniest of splashes. Harry relaxed, Draco hadn’t noticed.
“What are you doing here?” Harry blurted out.
Harry reached for his wand and turned the paper over with the tip. The underside of the note was blank. Harry's pulse quickened and he felt fresh sweat staining his shirt. Hastily, he quickly incedio’d the parchment until it had vanished completely, and wafted the resulting smoke away hastily. A moment later, a bony set of shoulders and a pin-like head stuck themselves out between two bookcases and glared at Harry through narrow eyes. Harry sat up straight and tried to look innocent.
Harry moaned openly into Draco's mouth and he felt Draco’s thighs sliding under his open legs. He pulled himself up by Malfoy’s collar and straddled him, pushing his tongue deeper into the blondes hot mouth. Moments later he felt two hands pushing themselves up under his thin t-shirt, and short nails digging into the damp flesh of his back, making him gasp. Fuck, he needed more. He needed…
“I don’t.” Harry tried to argue.
with a flick of her wrist, the giant teapot floated gently towards her, and poured steaming amber liquid into their teacups.
“What are you doing back at Hogwarts? What good is it coming back here if you're going to be locked up in Azkaban before you can sit your exams?” Malfoy’s jaw tightened, and Harry's heart sped up. He could see that had struck a nerve, and waited for Malfoy to retaliate, to bite back. Go on. Harry's conscience egged him on. Fight back.
“Did you feel that?”
“Be good, Draco. I love you very much.”
“Malfoy’s wand. I have it. I completely forgot until McGonagall reminded me at the beginning of term. I won it from him during the war.” Harry frowned as he spoke. Harry felt angry with himself for not thinking about the implications that could have had on Malfoy.
“Sorry?” Harry felt a trickle of doubt creep up through him. He fingered the tip of his wand poking out of his pocket. Malfoy wouldn’t dare attack him, would he?
“Kreacher?” Harry said, carefully.
They both gratefully accepted the invitation and when he stepped inside, the warmth hit Harry like a engulfing wave. He looked around at the familiar room, and unravelled the scarf from around his neck. He always felt safe in Hagrid’s hut, Only the Weasley’s Burrow could top the cosy homeliness he always felt here.
“Yes you do Malfoy.”
Harry groaned. He could feel the ornate handle of the door digging into the small of his back. He shifted his hips under Malfoy’s weight to try and relieve the pressure. Malfoy looked down at Harry, watched him moving under him, and then suddenly pushed himself away. Harry watched as a flush crawled up his cheeks before he held his head in his hands, and sank into a nearby armchair. Harry felt his heart pounding and he watched the blonde. He was hunched over himself, breathing heavily, his shoulder blades poking through his white shirt, reminding Harry of the sight of him swimming in the lake, his shirt clinging to his body as he went. Harry blinked and felt a flush of his own tingling in his cheeks. He couldn’t believe Malfoy of all people could make him feel like this. The stupid, dangerous git.
The next day Harry woke early, just after dawn, and dressed quickly in the morning sunbeams that filtered in though his bedroom window. Malfoy hadn’t said when the Auror's would be coming to take him away, so he thought it a good idea to rise early, just in case. Grabbing his wand and pulling on his invisibility cloak, he left his room quietly, and made his way down through the chilly castle corridors to the empty entrance hall, where the great wooden doors stood firmly shut. Harry looked around into the Great Hall, and saw at the edge of the Gryffindor house table Professor McGonagall standing alongside two taller cloaked figures, talking inaudibly. Harry watched them for a bit from underneath his invisibility cloak, until he heard the bell tower chime. The three adults gave each other significant looks, and McGonagall strode towards the entrance, making Harry flatten himself against a wall near a suit of armour.
He stopped when he reached the three visible wizards, looking up at the tall bald man, expression blank. However, Harry didn't fail to notice Draco's hand tighten slightly on the strap of his satchel. Harry smirked.
“Oh! Master Draco’s wand you mean?”
“Hmm… well, there is a possibility dark magic might be involved, if you’ve got no idea. Shall we go take a look at the Lake?”
“There’s always another way.” Harry whispered, their faces nearly touching.
Harry slid into his comfy bed, and decided he wasn't going to tell Ron about Draco's evening swim in the Great Lake. After all, Ron had said to report back to him if he saw anything suspicious. What Harry had witnessed, he concluded, as he turned out the lights and curled up in bed, wasn't anything suspicious at all. The only thing he’d seen was a broken boy, trying to find some sort of feeling in a sea of numbness he’d sunken into.
He followed what he thought might be dark droplets of water left along the flagstones, until he came to a door. Pointing his wand up the doorframe, he saw in glittering monochrome the initials D.M inscribed upon the wooden door. Harry blinked and paused momentarily, before leaning in and concentrating with all his might to focus on hearing something, anything at all, before the sound of a twisting door handle behind him made him jump out of his skin. He spun around, his wand outstretched, to find a squinting Seamus Finnegan emerging from his room, a hand raised in front of his face, blocking Harry’s wand light.
“We are enemies. Remember? We hate each other. I hate you! I always have! We...” Malfoy trailed off, and looked at Harry, bewildered. Harry just stared back, getting his own breathing back to normal.
“Been watching me, have you Potter?” Malfoy said, quietly.
sounded like Kreacher clamouring, and then the smallest of voices thanking him. A voice that Harry would recognise anywhere. Harry drew himself up and reached instinctively for his wand in his back pocket. He waited a few moments, his heart pounding, and then stepped forward, cautiously into the room.
“Malfoy. You will return immediately to the Slytherin common room and inform Professor Slughorn of the changes. Potter. You will stay here and clean up this courtyard until It has been returned to it’s original condition. Do you both understand me?”
“Running away Potter?” Harry looked over his shoulder into the room and saw Malfoy emerge from a shadowy spot, pointing his wand directly at Harry. Harry swallowed, and turned around to face Malfoy, his furthest hand reaching casually into his pocket where he'd stored his wand.
“Unsettlingly so.” McGonagall said, not attempting to hide her concern. Harry was relieved to see that he was not the only one who’d been unnerved by Draco’s initial quietness, but now he’d seen beneath Draco’s façade.
“So what, you can prove yourself as the saviour once again? I don’t need your help.”
“Can Kreacher fetch master a drink? A nice cup of tea for Mister Potter?” Harry ignored the house elf as he rummaged through the dresser of his bedroom in Grimmauld Place. Where the hell had he put the bloody thing? He’d already torn apart the front room, searched the shelves of the library and gone through every single piece of furniture in his bedroom. It was nowhere to be found. Harry yanked open the last drawer of the dresser, revealing a pair of old shoes, some parchment, and a battered tin sewing kit. Frustrated, he slammed the drawer shut. Why couldn't he have actually tried to organise this place before he’d rushed back to Hogwarts? He’d managed to cancel all the magical spells and wards in the house with help from Ron and a couple of curse breakers, so why couldn't he have found the time to at least try and sort out all his possessions? It wasn't like he owned much. Harry stretched his neck side to side irritably.
“Minister. I do believe we have had a confession of highly illegal dark magic from the Malfoy boy. It is only right if we immediately escort him to Azkaban to await trial for his crimes.” the bald wizard growled. Harry felt Draco’s hand go limp, and saw his eyes widening in fear.
The orange evening glow shone in through Harry's window, illuminating his trunk which was open at the foot of his bed. Harry was working his way around the room, picking things up, considering them, then either putting them back down or tossing them into his trunk. He came over to his desk, now completely buried under mounds of papers, and got to organising it. Piles for things to keep, stuff to throw away, and stuff to take back home. He came across a letter, turning it over to scan the handwriting. It was Hermione’s. Harry went to toss it into his trunk, but hesitated, and instead pulled the letter out of its torn envelope, and unfolded it. It was nice seeing Hermione’s handwriting. His eyes scanned the parchment and came to rest on Malfoy’s name, neatly written and capitalised. Hermione had implied he should consider defending him and his mother, as they’d both saved his life. Not so long ago Harry had thought this was absurd. But now, having seen Malfoy in the flesh, seeing how defeated he was, hearing Neville’s opinion, maybe it wasn't such a bad idea after all.
Harry decided not to wait up to hear when Malfoy returned. If it was anything like last time he'd be waiting a while. It was probably quite a task getting back into Hogwarts unnoticed without any magic, which is probably why the return journey was so lengthy, Harry thought. The issue of what to tell Ron churned in his brain as he undressed, preparing for bed. He caught a glimpse of himself in the wardrobe mirror as he pulled on his flannel pyjama bottoms. He looked at his bare shoulders, and how they flexed with more muscle than Malfoy’s had done when Harry had seen him emerge from the lake. Harry thought about how both of them had changed so much from the scrawny, immature boys they’d once been, how they were now fully grown adults, with a hell of a lot more history than Harry had anticipated they’d have at this age.
“We’re here.” The Auror halted and finally released his grip on Draco's arm. Draco rubbed it, and flexed his shoulder while he took in his surroundings.
Narcissa approached the gate and Malfoy saw her look at him. Her eyes were sad, but looked meaningfully into Draco’s.
“Ah. There you are.” Harry followed McGonagall’s gaze up the corridor and saw Malfoy, stony faced and cloaked, pacing quietly towards the four of them. He wasn't carrying any luggage, except for a leather satchel which hung from his shoulder.
“Scorgify.” Harry muttered, and some of the blood over Malfoy’s face was wiped away. Harry never really had perfected that spell. Immediately Malfoy lurched forward.
“Dale, In regards to the bodies…”
“Thanks for taking care of it, Kreacher. I’m really glad you found it.” Harry said, and left the room, quickly getting back downstairs. He entered the front room, and grabbed his rucksack from the leather sofa.
“‘Arry! Arry are you alrigh’? Arry!” Hagrid ran towards him with impressive speed, taking only a few seconds to reach them.
Harry shifted in his seat uncomfortably. He didn't need to be reminded that he was being constantly watched, stared at, and scrutinised. Coming back to Hogwarts was supposed to be an escape from all that, but now, he realised, eyes will most definitely still be on him. He looked up at McGonagall.
“Just a little thing from us at the Ministry. I reckon its a bribe for you to join the team, but don’t think of it like that.” Ron said. Harry chuckled, slightly disbelieving the fact the Aurors had decided to get him a Christmas present. Harry pulled the end of the ribbon, watched it unravel, then lifted the lid. He reached inside and pulled out the small object, recognition dawning over him.
Harry looked at Kreacher uncertainly. He hadn't told him when he'd be coming home.
“She gave up her life to save mine.” He said, and looked back up, glimmering eyes locking with Harry’s. He felt a sudden cold run over him as he realised what Malfoy had just said. What he had alluded to, intentional or not. Harry couldn’t help the gush of understanding and empathy he had for Malfoy. Sure his mother wasn't dead, but being in Azkaban is as close to death as one living will ever get. A life sentence there is a fate worse than death. A fate she had chosen to protect her son.
“I promise you I’ll explain everything later. Properly.” Harry said. Ron looked up at him, then behind him to Malfoy, and nodded.
The elf appeared in front of Harry, and bowed.
He blinked rapidly and rubbed his eyes under his glasses as he straightened himself. The dark room slowly came into focus, he made out walls, the floor, the doorway...
Malfoy wasn't at dinner that evening, just as he'd also missed the previous evening meal the day before. Harry deduced this was to be the norm for Malfoy - he’d noticed all of the other 8th years were present in the Great Hall, so Malfoy would have the whole common room to himself at that moment. Harry chewed on a chicken thigh thoughtfully, picturing the pointy blond dining all alone in the room, before dropping the greasy bone onto his plate and pushing the bench out from under his knees, jostling the other two inhabitants either side of him. Neville peered up at him.
See you soon Harry,
“Yea, pretty much the whole thing. And Hagrid’s.”
“Malfoy.” Harry heard himself say. Malfoy blew on the liquid in his cup and took a sip, without breaking his eye contact with Harry.
“To the Ministry.”
He saw Malfoy lift his head, his blonde hair falling messily in his eyes, which were glinting slightly. Harry took a deep breath and willed himself to ignore the heat rising in his chest.
“Kreacher, has anything… happened since I left?” Harry stammered, trying to keep up with the little elf, who made haste through the house and disappeared through the door to the library. Harry stopped, and listened.
“Hang on, are you mental?”
Ginny gave an unconcerned glance down at her more organised pile of homework and smiled.
“What's wrong? Don’t you want to go back?”
Harry checked his watch, the moonlight glinting off its crystal face. 11.36. Harry peered at the numbers, then looked back out at the dark lake. He’d been sitting in his usual spot for the best part of an hour now, waiting for Malfoy to appear as usual beneath him. He had been down to the common room earlier as many of the 8th years were leaving, biding them goodbye and muttering well wishes for the Holidays. Harry had maintained a happy expression, trying not to seem obvious that he himself did not intend on leaving that evening. When asked, he said he was going to apperate home, as he had arrived at Hogwarts in that way. Nobody questioned this, to which Harry was grateful.  After the common room had emptied, Harry went back up to his room, the absence of Malfoy during the commotion of everyone leaving indicating to Harry the blonde was remaining here, perhaps cooped up in his room, alone.
Once the day's timetable had been completed, Harry trudged back to the 8th year common room, feeling deflated. He bypassed all the talkative inhabitants of the common room and up the stairs to his bedroom. Once inside, he let himself fall heavily onto the cushy bed. It was a good few minutes before he moved again, he had his head buried comfortably in the feather pillows, eyes closed against the blackness. Eventually he rolled over, and fell into a restless sleep in the dying light of the day, waking a few hours later to find himself bathed in moonlight from his window. He blinked, bringing his vision to focus and looked at the clock on the wall. The spindly hands read 10.03 pm. He’d slept through the evening, exhaustion overcoming him from the draining day, and missed dinner. There was no chance he'd be getting back to sleep anytime soon, so Harry dragged himself up from his bed and trudged into the bathroom. He took a quick sobering shower, and changed into an old grey shirt and some baggy plaid pyjama bottoms. He brushed his teeth and spell-dried his dark hair, which had grown to be long and ever more unruly.  He went downstairs into the abandoned common room, the embers of the fire still glowing in the pit, and made himself a steaming hot chocolate, smiling when he saw 3 custard creams appear on a plate next to his mug. He took them back upstairs to his room and sat on the end of his bed, looking out at the stunning view.
Severus breaths slowly and deeply and looks at Black. She is staring at him, her eyes blank. If Severus had expected some kind of accusation or threatening, he was sorely wrong. All he received was utterly unreadable eyes.
He had gone on and on for an hour after returning from the zoo and then again before sleeping. For someone who hated Draco Malfoy and didn't want to be his friend, Harry surely talked a lot about him. But Sirius hadn't complained, not even once. He had nodded and Ohed and Aahed at the right places.
"Headmaster Dumbledore, Malfoy says that we are not in our dimension anymore," Harriet says, finally turning to look at Dumbledore, "Surely, he's mistaken?"
"I should have controlled myself Draco. I didn't do anything because you didn't let me." Harry spoke softly.
Harry nods and then speaks up softly, "You have the burning desire to sleep next to me. Are you sure?"
"I want to see Maw-no- Ma-l-foy's white peacocks and gardens. Please take me there." Harry requests Severus very politely but then the boy's always very polite and calm and composed.
"You'll find our stuffed dragon in mother's wardrobe - lowest drawer," Draco muttered quietly and it did the trick.
"No, no. This is not true. This is not real. I want to go back. I didn't want him to die. I-"
"I thought she would end up as a potions mistress Harry. I was totally stunned when she just left and married and that was that. We barely see her you know. She is there at the ministry balls with Nott and she smiles and all but it seems fake. She won't mock me, no matter how much I insult her and believe me, I tried."
"They will invite People from Britain as well." Draco muttered, his back stiff.
"What- Where are you going? Just stop interfering."
"Mom wrote that she woved you. She weft a wetter for me and asked me to give these things to you. She weft a wetter for you too." Petunia looks at Lily's son and sobs. Her tears just won't stop.
All he had desired was a chance at a happy life with Harry. Of course fate found a way to fuck it up for him.
Lord Burbage this. Lord Burbage that. It's nauseating and slightly terrifying to hear someone being addressed as 'lord' yet again after decades. He has half a mind to go and shake the red-headed man's shoulders.
Without giving aunt Sierra and uncle Severus any opportunity to say anything, she said, "I know that this is too much to ask of both of you but we don't have any other alternative. Uncle Severus can only ascend the throne if he's family and he'll be family if he marries you."
No words were exchanged. They were not needed. Draco knew that Harry was reliving old and painful memories and he could empathise with him.
Draco frowns before nodding, "Yes. I do. Why won't I?"
"He's only a bit mischievous. No, we do not," Lucius answered, his frown becoming more pronounced by the second, "May I ask why you're asking this question, my lord."
"Why are you asking me?" Draco asked and Harry answered "Just like that. Can I?"
"Sorry for being late." Albus murmurs and heads inside. He settles down beside Teddy.
"Are you going to say anything or am I just wasting my time here?" Severus muttered sharply and Harry stared at the fireplace quietly, his eyes angry.
Different types of sounds that escaped Draco's mouth distracted Harry and he stared at him. Sometimes, he frowned and sometimes he smiled and other times, he burrowed in Harry's stomach. He wondered what Draco was dreaming about.
Draco jumped in surprise when Harry punched the wall angrily.
Harry keeps his eyes glued on his book. He doesn't look at the blonde, not even when he sits down besides Harry.
The day is bright and sunny and she decides to go out to enjoy the beautiful day later on.
He scowls at the child, "Professor."
"I'll wait for you to come back. Also, I'll -" He mutters and continues in a low, embarrassed voice, "I'll miss you."
"Honestly Draco, since when have you cared for opinions of others. I love you and you love me and rest of the world does not matter. I do not care about them." Harry replied and Draco glared at him "You did. You said that I insult you by spying on you and you wanted me to stop."
Harriet stops when they reach the gates of the castle. For a moment, Tracey twists her face and gazes around, as if she can sense her presence. Her face is red and her eyes are so terrified that Harriet trembles. Tracey's body is quivering. Her terror and heaving chest send a shiver through Harriet's spine. She could easily have been in the place of Tracey if she was brave enough to tell everyone that she was a veela.
"I gave him the potion. He is not in pain and is sleeping." He replied, his eyes on Harry.
She stares at him, wide-eyed.
"Yes." He replies.
A movement brings Harry out of his musings and Harry turns to find that Ginny is about to leave.
He wrapped his arms tightly around Draco and sighed when he felt Draco bury his face in his neck again.
"Then, far be it from me to stop you from doing what you want to. I am here if you require my assistance with anything." Came the soft reply and Harriet nods before walking out of the room. She really mustn't get late. Once out of the office, she starts running as fast as she can.
Draco would never trust him enough, not even if Harry sacrificed everything for the blonde.
"Harry what's wrong?" Remus asks once his eyes fall on Harry.
Mother and Severus walk in but Potter doesn't.
What if he hit a tree instead. That won't do. Voldemort lay back down on the bed and closed his eyes, willing sleep to take him.
He gasped and closed his eyes and then the door because he had interrupted something he should not have.
"I pranked Professa Snape aunty." The child whispers as if sharing a secret, her green eyes wide and impossibly mischievous.
Inside the bath, he washed his face and brushed his teeth wondering about Draco’s sudden mood changes.
For a moment Draco wondered if his scars disgusted Harry and would have asked that question. But he caught himself when he noticed that Harry's eyes were narrowing as if he could read Draco's thoughts very clearly.
Draco cuts Granger off, "That's what you think."
Harry pulled back and Draco moaned from the loss of contact. But Harry unbuttoned his robe with gentle fingers and Draco shivered again. All the while Harry looked into his eyes and Draco's gaze did not waver. A second later his robe was on the floor and so was Harry's.
"All right Potter. Let's do this then. You have told Granger and Weasley, I assume?"
This criminal act does not bode well for the young Malfoy. We tried to reach out to his Father, Lucius Malfoy, who was found guilty of his crimes only a few days ago, but we were denied access to the top-security wing of Azkaban.”
Harry looked at her unconvinced. She crossed her legs and tucked a strand of orange hair behind her ear. The light from the fire beside them flickered against her pale skin. Even though they were not dating anymore, Harry found it hard not to be impressed by the soft glow of her prettiness.
“I need you to go to Hogwarts. Find McGonagall…” but the words died as he spoke them. If Malfoy really had done something terrible and she found out, he would be expelled from Hogwarts. Possibly even incriminated for his involvement. Harry shook his head. Harry couldn’t allow that to happen.
“At the Battle of Hogwarts, one of His plans to defeat the Order was using the Inferi. The task to enchant the mer-people in the lake into Inferi was left to my mother, but I took the task on myself, as I didn’t think she’d survive the process. I don’t know how much you know about how that works, Potter but it’s not exactly an easy process. It’s a curse. I had to come down here and perform this sort of ritual, and I created a bond with myself and the Inferi in the lake. As long as I am alive, the Inferi stay alive. And they keep growing. At the battle, I was too much of a coward to use them. But the bond still exists. The whole time I was home I feared the Inferi would take over the lake, hurt people, and I would be exposed as the one who had cursed it.  That’s why I started coming down to the lake at night. I was hoping the Inferi would recognise me as their Master and want to kill me to be released from the curse. But it didn't work. Every time I went in the lake I was hoping one would pull me under. I didn't know what I was doing, I just knew the Inferi had to kill me themselves, but without my wand I had no way of summoning them.” Malfoy paused and looked out towards the lake. Harry followed his gaze, settling on the bodies on the shore. Malfoy inhaled, and carried on with his story.
However, only a few moments of pacing later, the castle reappeared in front of him, huge and foreboding. He could swear that it was leaning forward and glaring at him.
Father's hands were clenched into fists and he was glaring dangerously at Severus. Draco knew that he would have to interfere if he wanted to avoid any further fights.
He slammed open the door to find Harry talking politely to his cousin and aunt and his blood boiled. Tessa's crying had been reduced to sobs and he closed the door before placing her on the floor. She ran and sat on the sofa beside her father, not quiet touching him.
The elf shook head and pulled his ears. "Room. please master."
But - but how was this even possible. Father had never in his life been the head auror.
forgive you." Blaise murmurs and Draco narrows his eyes. What's with his friends today. His nostrils flare.
"This can't go on." Blaise muttered and switched the lights on while Harry tried to walk properly. He nodded and sat down on the sofa, staring at Blaise. Blaise was a bi and single and had no plans to settle down any time soon. At least that was what he told Harry. Harry had a sneaking suspicion that Blaise had a huge crush on someone although he didn't who that person was.
Harry heard the note of desperation on his eyes and shifted his chair and stood up.
"What do you think is going on?" Blaise asked, his chocolate brown eyes worried.
At this, Ron stopped to think. He did not understand why Draco always glared at him. He sympathised with him and wanted Harry and him together. He had always supported them.
"Head auror Black, have you lost your mind?" Draco asked incredulously. What this man was suggesting was preposterous. It was completely absurd.
She knows that even being the girl-who-vanquished-Voldemort won't help her survive. As they side-along Tracey, Harriet falls on her knees. She is shocked by their sheer hypocrisy. They want their freedom but are not ready to grant others even their basic rights. She breathes hard and closes her eyes. What was the point of the battle if even ten years later, there is a whole race that can't exist. This was exactly what Voldemort wanted - except that he wanted everyone except the purebloods to exist though how he thought that was possible was beyond Harriet.
"After that scandal in the department of mysteries-"
"YOU ARE SELFISH. YOU DO NOT EVEN CARE ABOUT ME. HOW WILL I LIVE WITHOUT YOU. YOU COWARD. BLOODY PATHETIC COWARD." He shouted angrily and tears of rage and helplessness streaked down his eyes. "HOW AM I BLOODY SUPPOSED TO ALWAYS BE AROUND TO SAVE YOU. YOU ARE JUST LIKE EVERYONE ELSE, LEAVING ME TO MY OWN DEVICES. BLOODY COWARD."
"Will you both just SHUT UP?" He shouted, frustrated by their quarrelling and mother's incessant tears. Mother had not stopped crying ever since Severus had told or rather shouted everything at father. To say that father was shocked would be an understatement. Father had turned completely white. He had only ever seen him so shaken up when he had realised that Lord Voldemort had returned from death.
Someone sat with him and touched his shoulder and someone reached for Draco but he knew nothing except the fact that Draco had died and Harry had never been so ashamed of himself.
"Please, I haven't done anything wrong. Have mercy on me," She cries but they don't respond. Their movements are robotic and eyes are hard. Even ten years after the battle, the old worn out law criminalising the mere existence of Veela in Wizarding Britain prevail.
She tries to be silent but of course she can't. Her loss is painful and she is hurt.
He jumped when he felt aunt Petunia's hands grasp his "You will stay in touch with us, won't you?"
Draco stared and a bead of sweat gathered on his forehead "Did he-"
"Not yet." Scorpius replies, "You are back early."
There's no love lost between them. Petunia hated Snape for taking her sister away from her. A part of her will always hate this man.
"It's okay. Harry, why are you crying?" Draco asked and he ignored the way his own voice broke. No he was not crying. He was not a child. He ignored everyone around him. It was not difficult considering that they had gone silent. Everyone except Harry was silent. Though, when one heard carefully, Granger's sobbing could be heard very clearly.
Harry waits for her answer. She is crying and it's breaking his heart.
"Despise you. DESPISE YOU." Harry screamed and Draco replied "What am I to you, after all? I have so much emotional baggage."
"We came to meet you, Draco." Mother replied and Draco couldn't bear to look at her. He had almost forgotten Granger's presence. Almost. She made herself known by a simply whispered sentence "I hate to interrupt this but I really do need to speak to you, Draco." Draco looked at her with narrowed eyes. How dare she? Always interfering. Bloody nosy woman! Weasley and Granger had been one of the several causes of Draco's quarrels with Harry.
Albus sucks in a breath at that and continues looking quietly into his father's eyes.
He could not speak. He could not breathe. He could not exist without Harry.
Bill was busy speaking to Fleur and didn't notice anything happening whereas Ronald sat there quietly, staring at his untouched plate. Granger was sitting all alone on a separate table while Scorpius was sitting with the Weasley kids on a table close to Granger's. Charlie Weasley was sitting at the far corner with a couple of men whom Draco didn't recognise. He had his back to his entire family.
"They must be so ashamed of me. I am a disgrace and I am- am dirty." Draco whispered in a low voice and Harry trembled all over. This was the first time, Draco had used this word.
"Are you sure?" Harry whispered and let Draco's head fall on his shoulders. "Yes." Draco replied and Harry looked at the trio first and then at Hermione and Ron.
"Do you understand?" she asked, making sure that her voice was sharp and brook no arguments.
" I understand a bit. I will understand it completely if you tell me everything. " Harry replied softly and Draco looked at him desperately.
"I am tired." Draco whispered, looking deep into Harry's eyes. Harry nodded and spoke "Let me unlock the wards and you can take rest. You can talk to me about anything. I hope you know this."
Albus merely smiled and waggled his eyebrows mischievously. Harry glared at him one more time and then turned his face away, his cheeks feeling warm. He stared down at Scorpius who was still eerily quiet and was still staring at him.
Blood trickled down Harry's hands and gathered around his body. Draco shifted a bit and placed Harry's head on his lap very gently. It was his fault.
Scorpius did look sick. Harry realised with a jerk that Malfoy was begging him - that he was a beggar. He studied the man's face and couldn't see any deception.
Draco stared at Harry, surprised that the man wanted to go to the party at all.
"We'll keep him out of your way. Please, forgive him. He is only seven," Narcissa murmured, her eyes defiant, unlike her husband's terrified ones. It was more of an order than a request. Voldemort had no doubt that Narcissa was as mad as Bellatrix and their elder sister who ran off with a muggle. Madness ran in the blood of Blacks. He won't be surprised at all if she stood up and pointed a wand at his throat right now.
He stands beside it and flicks his hand. Suddenly their double bed transforms into two single beds and Draco is too stunned to even ask anything.
"Thank you." Draco's cheeks felt warm and he hoped that he had not turned red.
A few seconds later, Ron started shaking with fury "She is married for gods sake and- how can you claim this?"
"I have missed both of you." He whispered hesitantly.
"How can you even compare the suffering of two people?" She started and Harry interrupted her "Perhaps, you are right. He'll never come back. He is done with me and our marriage."
With a confused mind and pounding heart, Draco walks inside the great Hall, staring at Potter who is now sitting at the Gryffindor table, his eyes firmly on his plate. He doesn't look at Draco. Not even once.
!" Albus is suddenly pulled out of the pensieve by a
Please review
"Ms Potter-" Dumbledore started, only to be cut off by Bill, "
Draco dismissed him "It's okay. I will call Kreacher and take his help. You must take rest." And started cleaning his room.
"I don't. Believe me Draco. I want to fuck your tight arse and you don't know exactly how much I want that. I want you, actually no, I need you but I need you to want it too. " Harry replied nipping Draco's neck a bit and Draco moaned. But when Harry inserted his little finger inside the hem of his pants, Draco's face shined with sweat. Harry hugged Draco tightly and apparated them to their bedroom. He placed Draco very gently on their bed and turned around to lock the door.
"Malfoy. Earth to, Malfoy."
God! She loved Lily so much. She shared all her things with Lily and had been too possessive of her. Why had she wasted so much time in fighting uselessly?
"Should I?" She persists as if she actually means it. He rubs his forehead tiredly.
"It's hogwarts all over again. Never mind. He's in the guest room?" Snape asks and Harry nods, his eyebrows furrowed together in a frown.
"No." Black's smile faltered and his brows creased as he leaned forward, "This is a very complicated case. Lately, many other disappearances have been reported. Four of our aurors are at St. Mungos and two others escaped death narrowly. You're our only hope."
"Damn you to seventh pit of hell, Lucius. I hate you so much." Severus hisses viciously and casts a stinging hex on the man's legs before bending down and picking Harriet up. Without looking at the child's face, he closes his eyes and apparates to his manor, knowing that Black will follow him.
She looked up at him at that and shook her head, her eyes wide and watery and tortured all of a sudden.
"If today's quota of glaring at us has finished, can we go? I would like to know how, exactly, we have landed in some other dimension. Unlike you, some people actually have work," she drawled. Zabini snorted in response and Malfoy breathed deeply, trying to hide his grin and failed. This was Parkinson's way of telling Harriet that she actually didn't terrify any of them at all.
Sirius only smiled at him, "It won't but okay. I'll take the blame."
Father and Severus back off a bit.
"I am happy Harry. Happy and avenged. They will lead the rest of their pathetic lives in Azkaban and I want to really live now, heal and live with you." He murmurs and kisses Harry's lips right in front of the Weaslette. She shrieks and he kisses Harry again, his eyes gleaming with mischief.
"Finnigan won't. He can't know. He can't. I
He bent down a bit to cover Draco's scarred nipple inside his mouth.
Petunia could never tell her exactly how much she loved her. Vernon had literally begged her to go and she was too late. What if she had visited her earlier. What if Lily had Petunia's help and support too. Would she be alive right now?
Draco sighed deeply and sat beside Harry "I think that it is –"
They looked at each other, Draco looking angry and Harry looking sheepish. The silence was broken by Harry "So will you sleep in my room? I won't take any advantage-"
Harry did not answer and it was worrying. The green eyes stared at him and he stared back. Harry's hands that had been on his sides wrapped around him tightened and he flipped them around, lying on Draco and Draco's breath hitched. He breathed when Harry held Draco's hands in his and stretched them above his head and kissed his lips hungrily. Draco's heart beats sped up and he stared into Harry's angry and hungry eyes.
"An eye for an eye makes the world blind Harry." Draco whispered and Harry pursed his lips before speaking "Its better that the world in which a person is forced to sell his soul, his dignity to earn bread and butter ceases to exist. The people whom you are trying to protect destroyed you and they deserve to be destroyed. I will find them and I will make them pay. They are lucky that I am not Tom Riddle. I would not do what they did, at least. I am not a monster. I just want justice and justice, I will get, one way or another. Actually, I think that they should consider themselves lucky that you are strong. You would not let me kill them. They should thank you and they will thank you, Draco. Mark my words."
"Draco, we are your family." Remus murmured and this time even he was not enough to calm him down. He shook his head and clenched his eyes shut to stop any more tears from slipping.
"Harry, he is angry. He will hurt you. You must-" She started and Harry had expected what happened next. He pulled away from Harry and moved two steps and slapped her tightly on her cheek. She stared at him with a hand on her cheek, her eyes wide with shock. Harry rubbed his forehead tiredly.
Harry stopped after that and Draco waited for him to continue. But when Harry didn't, he turned around to face the man. His eyebrows rose when he found Harry curled into a small ball. Perhaps it was difficult for Harry. His best friends had wanted to tell Draco about it but Draco had refused, wanting to hear the story from Harry itself.
"Mom wrote that she forgave you." His eyes are really huge- larger then Lily's and much more beautiful.
What had exactly happened? Had Draco always been so tortured? Why had Harry never noticed? Had he been so engrossed in his life? Why had he never tried?
"I should have backed off damnit, why don't you understand this?" Harry mutters, his hands on Draco's shoulders and his eyes still shining.
She sighs audibly before starting quietly, "I was afraid this would happen. I must warn you though. You can't stop her from doing something she has put her mind to."
Alas! Draco had not replied to his owl.
"Ah!" said Dumbledore, "Since we do not know how long we will have to stay inside the castle, I would like to start classes. We have teachers and students and time," smiling pleasantly.
He slams the door open fully expecting a pacing or crying or glowering teenager standing in front of him. When he opens the door and a bucket full of water falls on his head, he is so astonished that he can barely stop himself from shrieking.
"Thank you." Severus is startled for a few moments. He had forgotten that Black was sitting with him.
Severus has not slept a wink for three days now. Dumbledore had asked him to let her stay with her relatives for three days at least.
Their eyes meet once Draco settles down and Potter sits up. He folds his hands on the table and pulls the chair closer to the table.
The last thing he saw was Sirius's shocked and terrified eyes and white face and felt a rush of glee in his heart.
Draco glared fiercely at her "Of course not. I was not raped. I am a man. Have you ever heard of a man who was raped? Are you nuts Granger?"
They were silent for the next few seconds. Harry broke the silence this time muttering "I had never known that you are a coward."
"Lucius." Narcissa spoke and Harry listened quietly as she continued "You must tell him now."
"I'm Sorry. You don't have to answer that." He continues awkwardly.
That was when he felt it. He felt Draco's magic enveloping him and he felt his legs lift and wrap around Draco's hips. Harry was shocked and turned on. Draco was bloody powerful and he was hard for Draco.
Draco was not standing in front of him anymore, probably because he couldn't face Harry. He was standing at the window, looking out and Harry walked over to him.
His eyes had closed and he was just slipping into slumber when he heard a softly murmured "I love you too, my Harry." And felt a soft kiss pressed on his lips.
"But, you like dad." James argues bitterly and looks away "He's married and is thirty nine and loves your father and you still like him."
"FUCK OFF OR ELSE-"
Initially, it was hard to accept it, particularly when Lily left her to go to that school. With time, Petunia learned to accept it but it was too late to apologize. So Petunia stayed away and then she married Vernon who convinced her to talk to her little sister. He promised that Lily would forgive her and then- and then you-know-who killed her and Petunia lost the chance.
"I just want to get rid of the shame, the filth, the dirt that has settled on my body. Touch me. I know you want it." She says. She keeps her eyes blank.
He nodded and started hurrying towards the said room. He supplied potions to this hospital and so some people recognised him but he did not pay any attention to them.
Draco saying his vows...
"Who are you?" He asked.
Harry stopped speaking for a bit and then continued "Am I a monster for wanting to kill him Draco?"
"Before you even think of seeking someone's else help, I will tell you something. I have invented a de-aging potion which will allow you to de-age yourself to a particular age for a specified period of time. But I can modify it to allow you to return to your own age after a specified interval for a short duration if you want. You will stay your age for a few hours at-least. It's my invention. It's better if you don't-"
She wondered what had woken her up.
"You are, Draco." She whispered softly and Draco snarled at her sitting up "I am not in a bloody trauma. you have no right to judge me. You don't know what I went through. You were happy in your life. It was me who suffered through everything."
He had just spoken a word when Draco walked over to him, his eyes boring into him and his hands inside his pockets. But Harry could see that he was fidgeting.
"Draco, Harry is fine now. He will live and is sleeping now. Before you go to your husband, I am demanding you to meet me after everything has settled down. I am leaving now. Others have left. Hermione and Ronald are with Harry." Severus's voice was curt and Draco swallowed. Nothing could remain hidden from his godfather for long. "Don't think I do not know what happened over here. You are lucky that he didn't die. He was on the verge of death today. Years ago, I lost Lily because I was too insecure and resorted to being marked instead of talking to her about my insecurities. You are lucky that you still have Harry. You won't always be lucky. Mark my words. He will go insane if you don't start trusting him."
Harry was worried about Draco. Actually it was an understatement because his concern for Draco knew no bounds. Draco had gone into silent zone. Many a time, Harry had noticed him looking sadly at the ceiling. He had refused to share it with Harry.
Draco nodded silently and replied "Take some rest. I will ask Kreacher to clean your night clothes and get tea and something to eat with it ready for you.
Will wonders never cease?
Harry nods.
They would go and give speeches in front of people to gain votes or appear in wizengamot and decide the fate of criminals. Did they have any right to all these things. How were they not criminals when Draco begged them to prepare him because he had already had two clients that day and they proceeded to fuck him dirty and bloody.
Scorpius turns around and walks back to face James.
"What have they done?" Harry asked and Draco looked into his eyes, his eyes widening with absolute fury.
Lucius blinks a couple of times to ensure that this isn't a dream. When he's sure, he looks at the pouting faces of the two five year olds and nods, "Yes. Yes. Go ahead."
"Malfoy!" A loud, surprised and excited voice broke into his thoughts and Draco froze. He was tired, hungry and annoyed. He did not have patience for Ronald Weasley right now. However, he pasted a smile on his face and turned around, expecting a bloated Ronald Weasley in his stupid clothes running towards him. However, when he saw a tall, fit and a quite handsome red head in black jeans and a white shirt, his jaw fell open.
Harry apparates in front of his house in Godric's hollow and takes a long breath. Finally, he is home. He has been trying to escape the media and the general wizarding population for the past two hours. He knocks on the door and Hermione opens it. Her red-rimmed eyes suggest that she has been crying for a long time.
He was not weak and could take care of himself. He won't let Harry treat him like a damsel in distress. When he sat straight on his bed and stretched himself, he realized that Harry was awake as well and from the corner of his eyes, he noticed that Harry was looking at him.
"I know." Albus mutters smugly. Scorpius rolls his eyes before looking back at the other two occupants. They are watching them, wide-eyed.
She cut him off with a whisper, lowering her face, "I know. I want her to have a safe and a happy childhood. She'll not get it in this country."
"Harry, say something." Hermione whispered, clearly anxious and Ron just shook his head, "I don't believe this mate. I mean, Sirius?"
Severus wants to say many things to her. He wants to get Potter checked for curses but all he can do is stare speechlessly at her.
Then he stalked towards Harry. He was looking at him cautiously, perhaps trying to understand his anger and he glared at the man.
Harry heaves a noticeable sigh and Draco watches as a shudder wracks Harry's entire body.
"Severus, you knew that Potter was alive and you told no one, not even Black." Draco mutters politely, trying to coax an answer out of his annoying godfather. The man still doesn't respond. He closes the door and heads towards Draco's bed before taking out something from his pocket and casting a charm to bring it back to its original size.
attacked. But that was mom's voice and why would she need to wander around the castle in the middle of the night and scream.
Fred and George looked sharply at Draco but didn't say anything before leaving too. Percy smiled politely at Draco and although Draco was disgusted, he didn't say anything. He smiled back and was so angry that he wanted to break something. Charlie and Creevy left after them and were followed by Ronald who was looking straight ahead, taking care not to look at Draco at all.
She nods and traces a random pattern on the bed-sheet before murmuring quietly, "I don't want to eat."
"Potter." Snape snaps at him and Harry ignores the man. He ignores everyone in the room or in the house. He walks towards Sirius's room. He is sure that his godfather is still sleeping. He knocks it before entering. To his surprise, Sirius is having breakfast with Remus.
"Shall we keep a home warming party? It has been a long time since we enjoyed ourselves at all."
He looks silently at his best friend. Ron and Hermione are his oldest friends. He trusts them. He always has and he is confident that it's Scorpia's illusion that they detest her for something she can't change and shouldn't be expected to change.
Harry had never wanted anything so much as he wanted Draco to be happy.
"Draco, get up or so help me. I am getting Pansy."
"I have realized my mistake. Forgive me." Draco spoke and Harry looked at him, really looked into his eyes this time and spoke "But you do not trust me."
"Sorry professa Snape." She manages to whisper before she starts laughing again. He keeps on the staring at the child. Never in his entire life a child has been so amused after being glared upon by him.
"Stop blaming yourself for everything. You didn't assault me." Draco spoke frantically and Harry shook his head, looking at Draco sadly.
Draco cut him off nervously "I- Harry, I had a nightmare and then wanted to clean myself and then wanted to die but then your face came into my mind and so I hurried to your room."
"Don't worry. Bring her before she disappears."
Harry took his time to look at the scars and tried to study his own feelings towards the same. All he found was sadness for Draco and black fury at those bastards.
"No. Please have mercy. Please." Tracey Davis, an seventh year Slytherin pleads as she is dragged by a couple of blank faced aurors. Her hands are secured by handcuffs and she is crying. She is literally crying. Tears are sliding down her cheeks as she screams and cries loudly to be spared because she hasn't done anything wrong. Harriet follows them, hidden underneath her cloak. They are not alone. Oh no. There are professors and other students. They are just standing there, staring at her being dragged away. The only crime she has committed is that she is a veela.
"I want to murder him. I will never be able to live in peace unless I punish the bastards who hurt us. Giving up is not in my nature Draco. I cannot forgive them. I need to punish them. When you entered my life, I had decided to forget my childhood. After all, I was never raped. I had lived in constant fear in that house but had managed to protect myself somehow. I simply can't forget it Draco. I have to punish them. I hate them so much."
"He doesn't deserve our love and one day - one day I will pay him back," she said quietly before standing up and stalking out of the classroom. Scorpius followed her with disturbed eyes. Ariana was angry. Her eyes were burning so brightly that Harriet couldn't help but stare at the girl even after she had left.
He had refused and had lied about his reasons. He had said that he did not want baby. He loved babies but had been afraid that he won't be able to take care of one. He should have told Draco. He should have told everything to Draco. He should have asked Draco about his own sorrows.
turn it into a wall. I cannot do that.
Draco's flushed when Harry appreciated his efforts to prepare Harry's favorites and replied " You have been working hard on your duelling for the past few days. I wanted you to have a good evening."
"I'm sorry Ms Potter but that is impossible right now," Albus answered, his face giving nothing away. He was not smiling but his eyes were calm but then he was always calm so it meant nothing.
"That is your headache, not mine. Theo has refused to play any part in this now and has vanished. Pansy is helping but Malfoy won't listen to her. He knows about her now. She is hiding. You are the only one who can do this."
Around twenty minutes later, Seamus sneaks inside. His eyes widen from horror and his face turns white when their eyes meet.
He takes her lower lip between his lips and sucks it. He tries to be as gentle as he can though the urge to pin her hands above her head is so strong that he almost does it - almost.
Ron and Hermione don't follow him. Nor do they say anything else or stop him. Harry puts his hands in his pockets and walks out of the Gryffindor common room. He looks around and sighs in relief. For a change, Draco is nowhere around. He walks towards Snape's classroom, hoping that the man is still there.
"Will you tell me about your past? " Harry changed the subject and asked. Draco replied "I don't want to. Not yet at least. "
"Yes Master"
Draco looked stunning, his eyes blazing with fury and his whole body alert as he shouted "I WANT A DIVORCE. YOU ARE A CHEAT." Harry wanted to grab him and kiss him but he shouted "I AM NOT A BLOODY CHEAT AND I WON'T SIGN THE DAMN PAPERS."
He started walking towards the table to complete his breakfast "It's okay if you do not want my presence. I will not impose myself on you." He said quietly and sadly. He was genuinely hurt which must have been obvious in his voice because Draco hugged his waist to stop him and whispered "Sweet Merlin, Potter, aren't you overly dramatic. I am just worried."
"Bye, Harry," called the boy's aunt. The front gate was still closed so that meant Potter would come out in just a few seconds.
"What're you exactly saying?" Severus asks.
Albus turns his scowl towards his oldest friend and four year boyfriend, "This might get over faster if you just come inside with me."
Five minutes were spent in comfortable silence, after which Draco spoke up "Harry" He stopped and cleared his throat before taking a sip of his tea.
Harry stared, dumbfounded at Draco. Draco was breathing hard and his eyes were alarmed. Sweat was trickling down his forehead. and the first thing Draco did was to open the largest window in the room. Harry simply stood there. He was beyond humiliated. He had just wanted to make love with his husband. There were other ways to stop Harry. Draco did not have to hit him.
She nodded and moved aside to make way for him and he flooed over to the hospital.
"No. I did not get any letter." Neville whispered and Draco turned towards Hermione and Ron.
"No-one hates you all right. Not James or Lily or Weasleys and dad isn't a child. He will get over his animosity towards your mom. He will help.
"You know what's odd?" Hermione asks absently, her eyes distant the way they got when she was trying to figure a puzzle out.
He knocked the door and a small voice called "Enter."
Harry restores all the memories back inside his mind before sitting down on the chair. He places his elbows on the table and covers his face with his hands. It's finally happening. He had known that it eventually would and there's no way to stop it now. He curses his past, clumsy self for falling in love with Malfoy and risking everything. He curses Malfoy for being a coward. He was an utter fool for believing that Malfoy would love someone like his past self.
