His little snakes came out of their hiding spots to try and comfort him as best as they could, promising to bite whoever had made their human cry. Opal changed her position and did her best to try and stop his tears whit her little forked tongue. That did work since the lithe tongue was tickling his face and made him smile and giggle amidst his cry. Onyx left his pocket and slithered his way into his shoulder to help his little friend making Harry laugh.
-	As long as you have studied the theory hard enough, there is no reason why you should not be able to perform the spells under carefully controlled examination conditions. - said Professor Umbridge dismissively.
-	Seeing as you weren’t present Friday and I am a prefect, I was given the task to give you the speech we usually give the first year students. – Draco said sitting straighter that he was already – First things first, our house, now yours too, isn’t the House of Evil as some students call it. It is true we have our fair share of Evil wizards, but the Merlin, most powerful and important wizard to date was a Slytherin, in case you didn’t know. Most people believe we are all into the Dark Arts just because of the actions of some of the former students of the house, but that is another lie created by the other houses and unfortunately not denied by people that know us. Even though the majority of the Slytherin students is pureblood we still have some that aren’t, like Tracie Davies from our year. And in case you are wondering, no, the few students that are muggleborn or half-blood aren’t mistreated in this house. The Slytherin house is already abused enough by outsiders that we don’t need to create more problems on the inside.
Harry stayed silent until Opal slithered down his leg to go and explore and try to calm the new thing in the room, Malfoy that now was silently sobbing with tears down is face . He tried to tell her to come back, that she shouldn’t bother strangers, the only response he received was silence. Malfoy was distracted enough that he didn’t even feel the snake climbing his leg to get to the seat.
Hearing the high voice of their little human, both Opal and Onyx left their exploring of the booth aside and climbed the boy’s leg and tried to caress his face like he usually did when he had them on his lap. That seemed to work a little bit, since the boy took a deep breath and thanked them caressing them in return. Also making the boy not notice the worried face that Sirius made when Harry mentioned the Dursley’s and the quick change from worried to surprised at the appearance of the snakes.
One week, was all it was left before Harry could go back to Hogwarts and get a little bit of freedom for the next 10 months. All he had to do was follow the absurd orders of his aunt and hope that she would let him go to Diagon Alley the day before the ride to school. With everything that happened this summer Harry didn’t had the time to go and get his school material for this year.
-	Respecting my wishes! I sent dozens of letters and receive 0 responses and you are telling me you were following my wishes. Why in the seven hells would I want to be alone after what happened last year, with the Dursley’s of all people! Hermione think a bit, do you really think that if I was given a choice between the Dursley´s and Sirius house I would choose the Dursley’s. Do you really think, believe even, in that? Do you really think I would choose a summer slaving around to one I would be with my friends? – Harry said angrily.
The elf nodded and popped out. Harry had noticed when he put his first spoonful of food in his mouth that his shirt’s sleeve was starting to get red in the spot in contact with the wound, probably since the blood wasn’t being put to use and he needed to get the wound clean or it may infect. Dobby appeared 2 minutes later with a bottle of essence of dittany, according to the label, and a roll of bandages. He carefully poured a bit of the liquid inside the bottle on the wound and massaged for a few seconds until the skin and wound absorbed the liquid and then wrapped his hand with the bandages. When he was finished he thanked Dobby for the meal and the stuff for his hand and left for the Slytherin dorm. Dobby said goodbye and told him that if he needed anything else he should call for Dobby and he would help.
Harry didn’t like where this conversation was going. He may not be talking to them, but he still considered them his friends and he wouldn’t let the old women just treat them like what they were saying was a stupid thing that didn’t deserve any attention. So he decided it was his turn to speak, with or without being called.
“Thank you. You know, for someone rather good at cooking, I really am bad in Potions. It surprises me sometimes.” Harry said with a laugh. The other kids exchanged a look between them but remained silent and finished their homework. When everyone had finished their homework, they got up and left the Common Room to go to the Great Hall for Lunch.
-	Harry, I really need to talk to you. Can we talk now please? – The girl said in a pleading voice. – I know you are mad at me and Ron and that you probably don’t want to talk to us, but after what you said in the train I have been thinking and you are right. We really need to talk, so please talk to us. I know you saw the look Ron gave you at dinner yesterday and he is mad but I have been talking to him I’m almost there convincing that you being in Slytherin doesn’t change who you are. It took me the weekend to think about your change of house and I realized that I don’t care in what house you are, you were my friend first and that’s what matters more. So please can we talk?
-	We were only respecting what you wanted, why are you talking like that? – She answer. – You said you wanted to be left alone so we left you alone. We only wanted to respect your wishes.
-	So, according to you, Cedric Diggory dropped dead of his own accord, did he? - Harry asked, his voice shaking.
With a tap of his wand his trunk, the terrarium and Hedwig’s cage were shrunken and tucked away in his bag while he told Hedwig to go ahead and fly to the school. His snakes were rolled up one in his neck while the other decided to stay in the pocket of the hoodie he was wearing.
He entered the pub and walked to the back where the entry to Diagon Alley was. He touched the right bricks and the wall opened to give him entry to the alley. Harry went first to Gringotts to get some money for his purchases. Looking at his Hogwarts letter Harry directed himself to Flourish and Blotts to by the books he needed for this year. He wondered around in the shop for a while looking for the books for classes and for books to read in his free time. He left the shop when his stomach started to make noise, remembering him that he didn’t had breakfast and that he needed to be feed. So he went back to the pub where he ordered something to eat. After lunch, the boy went to the ice cream shop, seeing as sweet things were something he rarely ate during summer.
-	 Detention, Mr. Potter! - said Professor Umbridge triumphantly while seating down thinking the discussion was over. - Friday evening. Five o’clock. My office. I repeat, this is a lie. The Ministry of Magic guarantees that you are not in danger from any Dark wizard. If you are still worried, by all means come and see me outside class hours. If someone is alarming you with fibs about reborn Dark wizards, I would like to hear about it. I am here to help. I am your friend. And now, you will kindly continue your reading. Page five, “Basics for Beginners”.
-	Well, all those people are idiots then. I have to go now, Remus just got home and I have to go help carry the stuff he bought in the market. I’m very glad to have talked and seen you Harry. Know that I love very much. Goodbye.
“It’s good to see that we are not alone in our hatred for her. Yesterday morning we were in the common room talking and I swear to you that some of the seventh years were making some plan to make her disappear from the face of the Earth. They were really worried about their grades. If the seventh years don’t think they can make it, how in the name of Merlin will we, we have O.W.L’s this year.” Harry said in an exasperated voice. “God, I do really sound like you. No offense.”
-	What are you doing here, Potter? Can’t see the booth is already occupied? – Draco said with his usual sneer.
What surprised me the most was the way they just accepted that I was now a Slytherin and that they never tried to attack me or anything! I spent the whole weekend in my bed only leaving at night when they couldn’t see me and never once they tried something against me. They just accepted that I needed time and they gave that.  Yesterday at breakfast they even included me in their conversations, they were really nice to me. When I received your letter I could actually feel the love and the worry and I started crying, not my best moment I must admit, but they didn’t make fun of me. Draco even hugged me and petted my hair. It felt weirdly good.
I didn't say in the last chapter because I forgot, but all the characters and places used in the story belong to J. K. Rolling, obviously.
When Harry heard the name of the new Defense teacher, he could feel the headache already forming and when he looked at the table of the faculty, she was indeed there. Dolores Umbridge, his newest nightmare. The Headmaster was already continuing his speech when a “hem, hem” was heard in the Hall interrupting him, everyone looked at the form of a small women dress in pink clothes and an awful pink head band that matched the clothes the woman was wearing.
“Dumbledore said that he had received a letter from you and that you said you wanted to be left alone. It’s Dumbledore, why would he lie?” the girl asked. “Now that you mentioned it no, he didn’t show any letter. That is odd! Why didn’t I ask to see the letter? I could have told if it was really from you or not, with the amount of your homework I corrected.” The girl said now scratching her head. “I don’t get it. But still, you could have told Dumbledore when he saw you at the trial, that you wanted to leave, I’m sure he would have let you leave.”
-	You better not even think about it or the consequences could be dire. – Malfoy said. – And what about your little friends, have they deserted you?
-	Don’t worry, you’re not going mad or anything, I can see them too. – A blond girl said. – I have been able to see them ever since my first day here. They have always pulled the carriages. You’re just as sane as I am.
Harry got his books and then went looking for the Transfiguration class room, it took him a while but he finally managed to get there 10 minutes before class. As he entered he could already see that the right side of the class was occupied by Ravenclaws, so he chose a seat in the left side in the back. A few minutes later the rest of the Slytherin fifth year students arrived and occupied the rest of the left side of the class room. At exactly 9 AM Professor McGonagall entered the classroom and started her class. The class occurred without accidents and Slytherin managed to get 15 points from answering right the questions the teacher asked. When they left for lunch, Draco pushed Harry aside and asked him if they could talk at the end of the day, to which Harry agreed.
I’m really happy that you are able to get Sirius name cleared, because he deserves justice and they have to start searching for Peter soon, because where he is most likely Voldemort isn’t far. Besides living in hiding doesn’t do any good to anyone, much less someone that was in Azkaban for 12 years. I hope Sirius is doing okay.
“It is a good idea. Merlin knows we could use all the help we can get.” Harry said “Do you have any idea who would like to join? You can count me in, Pansy would most likely want to participate, Theo and Tracy would too. Blaise is my bodyguard so count him in too. Would you like to take part in the study group to, Draco?” Harry said, turning to the other boy that had been ignored practically the entire time since he arrived.
The women touched the blackboard again with the tip of her wand making the first message vanish and be replaced by the ‘Course Aims’.
Slowly and rather numbly, Harry stood up and willed his body in the direction of the Slytherin table. As he made his way there the colors of his uniform started to change from the usual red and gold to the green and silver of his new house. When he arrived at his new table the only place left for him was between Malfoy and a brown haired girl, so without another choice he sat down.
-	I need to think a bit more, but I’m aware that we need to talk. Can you please give me until the weekend? – Harry asked her and received a nod as confirmation.
-	Did you really not read a word of what it said? – Harry asked now more calm but still a bit anxious and the blonde nodded.
-	That’s the problem, I never sent any letter saying that I wanted to be left alone. After everything the Dursley’s have done to me, so why would I want to stay there for the summer? Dumbledore knows that, Hermione and Ron know that even the Weasley’s know that so why did they believe in that letter that I supposedly wrote. Since I started Hogwarts, every summer the Weasley’s find a way to have me in their house for at least half the summer and last year, that happens to have been the worst of them all, I have to endure the Dursley’s the entire summer where is the logic in that. – Harry said exalted.
“For about 2 weeks now, I bought them when went to Diagon Alley to buy my school material. The one with the white spot is Opal and the complete dark one is Onyx. Aren’t they pretty?” Harry said picking them up and showing them to her, hoping with would distract her from his wrist. It didn’t work, since when he picked Opal up and was showing her to the girl, his sleeve went down and showed the top of the bandage he had maid last night. “What happened?” the girl said in a worried tone.
-	I have two actually. And who cares if it’s against the school rules as long as I don’t get caught I don’t have to worry about anything. And if you try and tell you will have to prove it and that would be rather hard. The teachers would most likely think that you were trying to get me into detention or in trouble and wouldn’t even believe in you. – stated Harry, while he showed Onyx. – And don’t worry I’m not going to tell anyone that you were crying like a baby.
After the shower, the boy returned to the shared room to guard his pajamas and found the room empty besides Malfoy that was seated in Harry´s bed with Opal in his lap, patting her small head. Harry didn´t know how to react to the way that his snake liked the caresses Malfoy was giving him or the way Malfoy seemed to like his snake back. Onyx was nowhere to be seen, maybe under the covers enjoying the warmth. He was rather fond of warm places.
Have you ever heard of Dolores Umbridge? She is our new Defense Against the Dark Arts. We had class today with her. Can you believe that we will only be taught the theory of spell casting and won’t ever have practical lessons? But we will still have the practical part in the exam. She says that we only need the theory to know how to cast spells. It´s ridiculous. There was a discussion during class and when I said that Voldemort was back she said it was a lie and when I insisted she took points and gave me detention. The Ministry is really desperate to pretend that he isn’t back, but that is jeopardizing our studies, just the theory isn’t enough. Oh Merlin, I sound like Hermione speaking!
Finally the 1st of September arrived. It’s time for the ride to Hogwarts, a fight with his friends, a conversation with his godfather and an awkward moment in the train. It couldn’t get worse, right? WRONG!!!!
I want to thank all the people that read the first chapter, bookmarked and left kudos, thank you very much to all of you, I wasn't expecting that many people to read it, nor bookmark or leave kudos.
-	Seems kind of reasonable to me, so that’s alright. Now let’s go and get breakfast. – The blonde said, getting up and putting Opal in the pillow.
-	It is none of your business were my friends are or why I was crying. – Malfoy responded rudely. – Now, shut up and leave me alone. If you don’t want to you don’t need to leave the booth, but bother me and I won’t bother you.
Harry nods and follows Malfoy out of the room. In the common room, most of the fifth year students were waiting for both of them. All the kids headed to the great hall to get breakfast. Harry mostly walked behind them half listening to their conversation and sometimes responding to any question he was asked.
“Mister Harry Potter, Dobby is very happy to see you. Do you want anything to eat?” said the small elf popping in front of Harry.
Harry finished eating and the plate disappeared with a snap of Dobby’s fingers being replaced with a slice of Treacle Tart in a plate. He ate it with pleasure. After, the plate disappeared again.
When he was almost over eating the owls started showing up with some mail. Surprisingly, a blackish brown owl with white facial markings and yellow eyes landed in front of him with a letter for him. Harry took the letter and tried giving some bacon to the owl, but the bird started pecking at his eggs instead. In the front of the envelope his name was written in a letter he recognized as belonging to Remus. He was scared for a second, thinking for some reason Remus was writing him so soon. He was waiting for the end of the of the week to right to him and Sirius telling them about his first week and because he was slightly scared to tell them that he had changed houses and ended up in Slytherin. Harry slowly opened the letter.
A dark skinned boy, introduced himself as Blaise Zabini, offered to show him were the fifth year dorms were located, Harry nodded his head and followed the boy up the stairs, to a room filled with 6 beds, his belongings were already in front of the third bed counting from the door. The boy thanked Zabini for the help, and headed to his bed. Once inside the comfort of the closed curtains, that the beds in the Slytherin dorm also had, Harry allowed himself to take a deep breath and think about all that happened that day.
When Morning came Harry woke up with the sound of all the other boys he shared a room with also getting up. Seeing as there were 6 boys trying to occupy the showers he decided that he would that a shower at night before going to bed. He fished his uniform from his trunk and got dressed in his bed with the curtains closed. After he was ready he picked up his timetable to see which subjects he was going to have today. In the morning he was going to have Care of Magical Creatures, which was a subject he rather enjoyed. In the evening he was going to have Defense, which put a frown in his face almost immediately just thinking about the person that taught the subject. That class was faded to go wrong.
-	Thank you, Headmaster, for those kind words of welcome. Well, it is lovely to be back at Hogwarts, I must say! And to see such happy little faces looking up at me! I am very much looking forward to getting to know you all and I’m sure we’ll be very good friends! The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards to be of vital importance. The rare gifts with which you were born may come to nothing if not nurtured and honed by careful instruction. The ancient skills unique to the wizarding community must be passed down the generations lest we lose them forever. The treasure trove of magical knowledge amassed by our ancestors must be guarded, replenished and polished by those who have been called to the noble profession of teaching. Every headmaster and headmistress of Hogwarts has brought something new to the weighty task of governing this historic school, and that is as it should be, for without progress there will be stagnation and decay. There again, progress for progress’s sake must be discouraged, for our tried and tested traditions often require no tinkering. A balance, then, between old and new, between permanence and change, between tradition and innovation … - the women kept on talking without noticing that absolutely no  one was listening to her speech - … because some changes will be for the better, while others will come, in the fullness of time, to be recognized as errors of judgment. Meanwhile, some old habits will be retained, and rightly so, whereas others, outmoded and outworn, must be abandoned. Let us move forward, then, into a new era of openness, effectiveness and accountability, intent on preserving what ought to be preserved, perfecting what needs to be perfected, and pruning wherever we find practices that ought to be prohibited.
Both of them simultaneously turned and began walking towards the door of the pub. Harry took a deep breath when he opened the door and a copious amount of cold, biting air punched him across the face.
The line was so long tonight that they had decided to disillusion themselves and sneak past, he was sure there was no way that this could break the statue of secrecy, just maybe some common courtesy unwritten laws. It’s not like any of the muggles would know.
“Yes.. yes I do.” Malfoy began to awkwardly twiddle with his fingers again. “Have a bed, that is.” Draco continued to make no move. If Harry didn’t know Draco was a prostitute, he’d probably think the boy had never had sex before.
“Well, are you just going to stand there and brag or…” Harry joked, making a smirk light up Draco’s face.
“Why don’t you play me something?” Draco lounged back in Harry’s chair, making it obvious he wasn’t leaving the office anytime soon.
Harry undid his zipper and practically groaned with relief as he emptied his bladder, soon putting himself back in his pants and doing the zipper up again.
Harry gave up on reading the bottle and unscrewed the lid, spraying two pumps on his neck. It smelled okay he supposed.
When all the buttons were undone, Harry let the fabric drop from his shoulders down to his elbows before shuffling the rest off so that the shirt was calmly settled in his hands. He slowly began to strut towards Cole before squatting down to the floor and wrapping the shirt’s fabric around the back of Cole’s neck. Swiftly bringing the man’s face to within an inch of Harry’s. He kissed his cheek right next to his ear before pulling the fabric away and standing up, being sure to push his butt out in the process.
Sleep was, decidedly, the worst thing Harry could’ve done. His dreams had supplied him with nothing but blurry images of a pale body and… Was that chocolate syrup?
“Yeah, yeah… I wanked, like, three times. I mean, I can normally go for multiple rounds but… Ya’know… Poor little mini-Harry is really spent…” He could feel his own face light up red.
“I never wanted to be a drug dealer! I just got sucked up into it.” His breath shook. “I was the lowest rank in a ring bigger than I’d ever imagined.” Malfoy explained.
“You said to keep it easy.” Malfoy replied. Catherine just grumbled in response. Cole swiftly moved back in the circle next to Harry.
Harry had been absentmindedly stroking at Malfoy’s ankle for a few minutes, staring into nothingness in the distance. When he turned to face Malfoy, the man showed him a comforting smile, one with crinkles at the eyes.
Harry frowned at the image, everything was slightly out of scale. None of the lines looked quite right next to eachother, and the flower heads were comically large.
“How rude! Is it not completely obvious that I made it all!” Harry announced, putting his hand flamboyantly on his chest. “Well, everything apart from the pastries, I ran downstairs to your café to get them.”
“Then I guess you vanished my jeans or something – I don’t know I didn’t really question it at the time but it was some pretty smooth magic, I mean who knew you could cast wandlessly, where did you learn to do tha-“
What would even be at the top. Maybe a bedroom or a lab or a prison or a red room or a… well that’s it really. Harry looked behind himself to see Malfoy was following him up the staircase from behind.
He tucked the pieces away into his pocket for safe keeping, he’d need to bring them back for examination.
Harry felt the warm wetness of lube covered all over Draco’s arse- he must’ve already prepped himself. Harry grunted at how wet Malfoy was. Their kissing intensified from slow and devouring to hot and heady, filled with so much need it almost made Harry go blind.
“Yes.” Harry’s face had shaded red, his lips plump and stretched around his smile. His eye’s were glowing.
“Yeah… I’m ready.” Harry answered, looking into Draco’s eyes and seeing that same tangled look of lust, filled with a nurturing glaze that Harry had remembered from last time. Draco pulled his fingers out and shifted, lying with his full weight on top of Harry, groin pressed to groin and chest on chest, until he was staring just as deeply as before at Harry’s eyes.
Harry’s eye’s flicked down to the sweet treat, and Draco wasn’t wrong. They appeared to be bigger than Harry’s hand, and there were four of them per plate. Four! His stomach let out a groan.
After a few minutes, Harry’s coffee arrived next to him, the same man that was behind the till holding the cup in his hands.
“Bonjour, Harry.” Ron shouted out in just about the worst French accent he had ever heard. “I can smell crepes”
Malfoy crawled onto the bed until he was straddling Harry’s hips, trapping Harry’s dick between their bodies and began running his hands along Harry’s collar, chest and stomach.
Within a few seconds he was easily descending the wand back down to the glass. This time even more smoke began to flow out, beginning to float up around the handle of Harry’s wand and drift towards his fingertips.
“I went down to this new café about a mile away and got us some pastries for before we leave. I could practically smell the café down the other end of the street. I couldn’t help myself.”
. Now Malfoy was really asking something. Harry had always slept in his underwear, he’d never had the need for pyjamas, but he definitely didn’t want to be bare next to Malfoy. His cheeks painted pink at the thought of it.
His mouth-watered, despite the pain his eyes felt from being attacked by the sun rays streaming through the curtains. He breathed the scent in deeper, he hadn’t woken up to well cooked food for the past two years.
Harry felt a loud laugh bubble up out of his throat, making him choke on the tea that he had just drunk. His smile roared out as he replied through a burst of giggles.
“How can you even move your fingers that fast, it’s quite impressive.” His eyes were trained on Harry’s trimmed nails.
Harry wasn’t quite sure where he had apparated to but when he looked up, he saw himself stood outside of a small café in Diagon that he’d never seen.
He stared at one of the enchanted images on the pages, watching Malfoy’s body stroll down a dark alleyway. It was a weird photo to have in the article, appearing to have no real correlation to the article itself, which made the image pop out more than any of the others.
Harry ran his eyes over to the photo on the right of the page. He expected to see a run down, greasy-looking git, but instead he had the breath knocked out of him.
He suddenly seemed aware of every nerve in his body, every contour of Draco’s skin, and Harry let out a whooshing breath to the side of Draco’s cheek, where he watched him with a deep stare, eyes flickering from Harry’s eyelashes to his nose to his lips. Looking out for every expression that crossed his face.
“Okay then.” Harry replied and lifted up the bed sheet, pulling his body into the bed side. He laid on his side and stared at the wall as he felt the dip of Malfoy’s body in the bed. Even as Harry tried to lean away from Malfoy, leaving a gap in the bed between them, the man’s heat radiated over to him.
“Don’t worry Harry, you can always just plant some roses and tulips in the drier parts of the soil.”
He pulled away from Draco and brought one calloused hand up to rub against the soft skin of his cheek.
“Of course.” Harry laughed. “Come on in.” Malfoy followed Harry through to the kitchen, where Mia was sat at the table with a cup of tea warming up her hands.
He needed some water before reading this. He sat back down in his seat, vanishing away the coffee in his cup and casting a quick Aguamenti instead. He sipped on the cool water, clearing out his throat before he cast his eyes back on the letter.
Malfoy’s lips worked on Harry’s neck whilst his hands fiddled with his nipples. Flicking over the peaked nibs again and again, making them stand up hard. Harry was sure he could come just from this as he became aware that he was a moaning mess beneath Malfoy, whispering an incoherent string of appreciative mumbles.
Harry felt his stomach drop, he wasn’t too sure why, but he didn’t want to think too far into it. He soon returned his focus back to the article and absently read through it, until he reached one quote that seemed to jump out at him.
The poor sod was still laid down on the floor, a small bruise beginning to form on his cheek. Harry quickly leant down to feel his pulse.
“Sorry, I-” Harry apologised, bringing one hand up to rub at his eyes. “Sorry, let’s just… Get back to making breakfast.”
In slow motion, he leant forward and pressed his lips softly onto Harry’s, for only a second before pulling away and staring endlessly into Harry’s eyes.
Harry looked around himself once more, no one would have to know where he’d gone, He could easily get back before Ron and Hermione. He just had to see Malfoy and see whether maybe he was just imagining his brief past encounter.
“Of course not, at least now people won’t be quite so surprised when I tell them that your down in my basement.” A smile lit up Malfoy’s face.
“You are though. Even if you don’t think you are. You’re almost too willing to forgive.” He smiled, moving his hand back down to Draco’s jaw, letting his fingers dance over the bone.
The smell was getting more grotesque by the second, and when the incessant bleeping of the fire alarm started to sound, he tried to block it off by covering his ears with a plump, silk pillow.
“Well, I’m doin’ lovely now that yer here.” Winston directed his attention to Draco. “Why yer a good lookin’ chap, aren’t ya? What’s yer name?” He asked, holding out one oversized hand.
“What are you talking about? What was wrong with that time turner?” Harry sat up on his arms, looking past Malfoy’s knee to see the other half of the time turner fragments left on the floor.
He pulled himself away from the kitchen table and opened up the window, letting a scrawny, black owl hobble its way inside. On it’s leg was a small note of parchment.
Harry shuffled around, leaning back against the couch, then leaning forwards, then sideways, then eventually settling for crossing his legs and leaning back. By the time he’d made his decision, Draco walked in with two cups of tea.
Harry was stood outside of the small, cosy café once again. This time, however, he noticed the warm, inviting smell of fresh pastries wafting out through the door. His stomach let out a loud growl of approval.
After five more thrust of his fingers and hitting Harry’s prostate two more times, Draco decided that Harry was ready and pulled his hand out of Harry’s hole.
“Give me a second.” Harry whispered, pausing Malfoy’s movements on his crotch, but that still didn’t stop Malfoy from shyly running his fingers across the outline of Harry’s erection through the fabric.
“You haven’t ever been with a man before, have you?” Harry asked, his voice almost a whole octave lower than when he last spoke. Draco wanted to drown in the sultry smoothness of his bedroom voice.
“Something to do with the altitude. I was planning on moving my bedroom into the lab and moving the lab underground, where my bedroom is.”
“It’s alright, I can apparate myself.” Malfoy stood, disappearing from Harry’s eyes with a crack. Harry frowned at the rejection before following behind.
Overall, everyone was deflated. Hermione was evidently disappointed; the estate agent was quite agitated, and Harry was annoyed at himself for upsetting the other two.
Harry followed her outside. A few days ago, the garden’s old swamp land had been dug up and replaced with new grass, leaving an empty grass field in place of the dirty mud. Whilst it had given Harry’s wallet quite the punch, it saved him far more time than doing it all by hand.
“Enough to want a second one, in real life?” Malfoy questioned. Harry waited a few seconds before his brain cells managed to gain back the capacity to form words.
Draco’s breath sped up, turning into a pant as Harry’s lips moved lower, to Draco’s neck, then collar, the chest before settling on his nipples.
As soon as his eyes hit the floor they were distracted by a bright clump of blonde hair in the centre of the floor.
When Draco imagined the beautiful sound of his name falling from Harry’s lips, he felt his orgasm fast approaching. Once he sped up his hand to the point that his wrist ached, he couldn’t hold back any longer and he saw white as come splattered out of his cock onto the flooring in front of him, covering the wood in lines of white spunk.
“Will do, bye.” Harry waved back, flashing her a quick smile before pulling his face out of the fire.
Harry nuzzled himself in closer to the wall when he felt the brush of Malfoy’s foot on his own. He was sure the other man was doing the same as Harry on the opposite side.
They ate the rest of their breakfast in a lull of conversation until Harry left to put on his Auror uniform and leave.
Which it was, the case was just a clearance of an old alley, which housed a peculiarly high intensity of magical energy, despite appearing as a normal alleyway. Harry expected that a few magical artifacts were likely being hidden in the rubbish bins against the wall.
“I thought we stopped with the lies.” Harry’s voice was soft, no higher than a whisper. “Tell me, what’s wrong?”
This time it was Harry’s turn to comfort, he wrapped his legs tighter around Draco and lifted one finger to stroke the hair out of his eyes.
“Are you sure about that, Potter?” Malfoy, smirked, not looking away from Harry’s crotch. Harry quickly moved his hands to cover his erection.
It's quite annoying that I lost a lot of bookmarks and kudos that I had on the previous upload but thankfully enough, I've written enough of the fic that I can still post some chapters :)
“No, it was my fault.” Draco moved swiftly beneath Harry, noticing their position and panicking, he shot up, forcefully bashing his forehead directly into Harry’s.
“Of course.” He crackled, looking over to Ginny’s approving eyes. Without thought, he wrapped his hand around his drink and downed the rest of it in one gulp, hoping that the alcohol might just calm his nerves enough to dance.
“We can buy you a pint if you want?” James offered, “We’ve got a whole group, I’m sure we could spare a place.”
For a moment- a cruel and terrible moment- Harry thought that this was when Draco would reveal it was an act and that he really didn’t want to sleep with Harry. That he was repulsed to even be near him.
“Sure, but I’ll pay next time.” Harry settled, if Lucius was technically paying for the meal, then he would let him.
Harry does it again, Draco’s arse cheeks jiggle against Harry this time, a loud slapping sound filling the room. Harry feels like his nerve-endings are on fire, every thrust inside Malfoy brings him closer to his much needed climax.
“No, I really think I must’ve misheard.” Harry rolled his eyes and repeated exactly the same sentence.
This place sounded perfect. It was exactly what Harry had wanted. Small but with a decent amount of rooms, modest but beautiful, simple but intricate, and it would take loads of work to get complete. Which would actually give Harry a purpose instead of wasting around in bed everyday like usual.
“Fuck Malfoy, you’ve got such a sweet arse.” Harry thrusts in harder. “You like me fucking you?” He’s not even aware of his words as they come out. “Fucking your pretty arse, you like it rough, don’t you?”
“Whoops.” Draco muttered, before noticing that the champagne had began to shoot out of the top of the bottle along with the cork.
“What’s wrong?” He asked, nurturingly lifting his finger to rub Harry’s cheek. Harry felt embarrassed to vocalise what he wanted.
“Well…” Cole replied, looking down to his wristwatch once again. “I can certainly see what you mean by history.”
“They’ll all love you, but I invited a few more people that really liven it up a bit more. They should be here around about now, actually.” Cole rambled, letting his gaze dart off around the room.  “Let’s go chat.” Cole suggested, grabbing Harry’s hand and tugging him in the direction of Catherine.
“Fuck!” They screamed in unison, clutching their foreheads in pain. Harry collapsed down onto Draco, making the man squeak out like a dog toy. He swiftly rolled off him onto the floor.
As soon as the two boys stepped out of the floo into their own apartment, Harry was back on Draco like wildfire, pushing him against the wall next to the fireplace.
“Fucking hell Malfoy.” Harry cursed, begging for some form of relief from his tongue. “Please, Draco.”
He wrapped his lips around the brim of the bottle, trying to avoid the champagne soaking the floor completely.
“How exciting!” Cole interrupted again. “If we all know each other, let’s forget about trivial greetings, how about we get straight to partying?” Harry was now extremely thankful that Cole was here in order to alleviate any tension between the two groups.
Harry smiled at the stranger and gave a little wave before cursing himself and turning back to the bar.
Harry sat in a mild daze for the next few minutes, laughing when anyone else laughed and playing along with the rest of the group. His mind too preoccupied with trying to not think of Malfoy to focus on anything else.
“I know it wasn’t, but maybe it would be a good thing. I mean, I can’t live with you and Ron forever. I need to grow up and become an actual twenty-five year old man.” Hermione looked down to the ground in subtle agreement. “And you’ve got a baby on the way, I shouldn’t be here whilst you’re trying to build a family, I should really find a new place.” Hermione looked back up to Harry, he could see she was torn.
It felt like cloud nine, the small exhale of breath from Harry’s nose tickling Draco’s face as their lips worked silently against one another. It suddenly hit Draco that he was kissing a man, for the first time in his life, and that this wasn’t just any man. This was
“Oh My Merlin, look who it is!” Cole suddenly beamed, turning around the room to run in the direction of the new arrivals. “I’m so happy you guys actually came.”
The kitchen looked cosy, it was large but was filled with wooden cabinets and a traditional cooker. Harry’s mind was already filing in with new possibilities for the décor. The woman swiftly turned and moved the kettle over to the stove and began heating the water manually.
Then Draco pushed even harder, brushing his thumb against the spot behind Harry’s balls and before Harry could even register the feeling of pleasure, his eyes had rolled back, and he was panting for breath.
He wasn’t quite aware of how much time had passed in his silence, maybe seconds or hours or days. But it was enough time that Harry’s anger had faded into a small dose of guilty regret.
“I’m Draco Malfoy, and I need to speak to my Father.” Narcissa opened the door further, showing her pregnant stomach.
“Right so let’s start it off easy okay.” Cole suggested, “We’ll go clockwise, starting with Catherine and then stop when we get to Harry to play Spin the bottle, yeah?” Everyone nodded their heads in unison. Harry counted how many people there were. There would be ten goes before Harry’s. At least he would have enough time to think of something good.
Harry proceeded to have this internal argument with his mind for the remaining duration of his walk.
“Cool, I think Madeline just got in so I might be able to swap our shifts, I’ll be back in a second.” Cole turned around, going into what was presumably the back office and returning five seconds later, “Yeah, she’s cool with it, I’ll just get your order, What was it again?”
Malfoy took a few steps forward and crawled onto the bed next to Harry, moving him so that Harry was lying down on the bed with his head on the pillows. Malfoy grabbed a cushion and tapped Harry’s hips.
“Come and have a seat, tell me what happened.” Harry placed one hand on Malfoy’s shoulder and tried to direct him to the kitchen with the other.
“Wow, you are really great at complements, Potter.” Draco smiled. “But thanks, Dad sent a bit of money to us for the next two or so days, he’s arranging with Gringotts for us to have access to the family vault but apparently processing takes a few days. So, I thought I’d go shopping with some of the money.” Draco beamed, straightening the corners of his coat.
“Really?” Malfoy moved his hands to grab a hold of Harry’s drink as he swiftly took a large gulp from the glass. Harry’s body bristled as he watched Malfoy’s adams apple bop up and down.
He’d been staring at his reflection in the orb for the past hour, debating whether he should press his wand to the material or not.
Then he told Cole about seeing him at a gay club with Ginny, then returning to that same gay club just to catch a glimpse of him again, then accidently bumping into Malfoy at Cole’s party (Harry couldn’t help but notice how the corners of Cole’s lips were downturned when Harry described kissing Malfoy for the first time), then, finally to where we was stuck at today. The mysterious crystal ball, which was filled with a preview of Malfoy’s work – Harry could feel his cheeks heating when he spoke about the sphere so he decided to not tell Cole quite what happened in the vision inside, in fear that Harry may adorn an erection in this very public place.
“With that guy’s nephew. You said you weren’t sure if you should’ve had him admitted, but you’ve saved his life.” Harry said, picking up his tea to take a sip. The taste of popcorn felt like a slap across the face. The buttery taste now associated with his last night with Draco.
“Sorry mate! I left my jacket here.” Damien smiled with a wave, pushing the door open and disappearing inside of it.
Draco finally moved his hand from the outside of his pants under the waistband and into private territory. The touch of his hard dick was comforting against his hand, the heavy weight of it reassuring. He wrapped his fingers around the familiar girth, groaning at the much needed jerk of pleasure.
“This is the really cool guy I was telling you about.” Cole explained, forcing Harry to turn around and greet Malfoy. As soon as his eyes landed on the blond, he felt as if the air had been punched out of him.
“You look nice.” She complemented, opening her arms out to him for a hug – which Harry accepted. “I’ve missed you.” She told him, cradling her arms tighter around him.
“Well, I best leave you to close up.” Harry finished, beginning to pack away his belongings. Cole evidently ran through his mind, trying to think of an excuse to make Harry stay, but none came.
So, Harry lied down on his bed, shuffling some pillows underneath his head. He stared at his tenting pants, weirdly intimidated by the idea of breaking his chain of abstinence.
. He only showed up to the place to get fit. The idea of finding working out fun was insane. That settles it, Andy must be mentally ill. He would never be good enough for Harry.
Harry pulled some burn lotion out of his kit and chucked it over to Malfoy. “Rub that on when your ready.” He walked over to the kitchen counter and lifted himself up, placing his bum on the wood. “Basically, you’re in nineteen eighty.”
“Okay, you’re safe.” He chuckled, Malfoy took the hand off his eyes and watched Harry’s fingers working on the remaining buttons.
There were only three stalls, which were painted a spotty white, mouldy grime growing at each of the corners. The urinals had water stains running from the top to the basin, leading down to the open drain at the bottom.
Draco tiptoed closer to the table, not wanting to make Harry aware of his presence. He could hear the sound of satisfied humming coming from Harry as he pushed two eggs around the pan. Two
“Yes, you go do that.” Harry instructed, pulling the classified files in front of him and inking up his quill.
Harry pulled once again, mildly embarrassed at having his chest fully on show. Malfoy tutted at him.
When Draco leant down to kiss Harry through his thrusts -rough and disjointed- Harry felt a strange fullness well up in his heart, matching the one growing in his belly. He felt like he could scream and cry and dance and die all in one moment, because he’d never felt quite so loved in his entire life. So that was when he realised.
“I was destined to be obsessed with you ever since I first heard the name Harry Potter.” Draco revealed.
Harry was amazed at the bathroom, there was a large jacuzzie-esque bath in the corner, with a shower on the other side of the room. Both were large and slightly too on the luxurious side for Harry but, he supposed he would have to spoil himself with something. Although he did still need to call the plumbers to fit everything up to the water supply. So perhaps he would still be showering at Ron and Hermione’s for a while.
Cole’s eyebrows immediately shot up, his lips falling into a momentary frown before he caught himself and referred back to his usual kind but indifferent expression.
“I have to be honest; this doesn’t look good.” Lucius explained, moving his finger to wrap around the small hourglass, “But luckily, the hourglass is still intact. The sand within it is what contains the time magic, without it, you would have no chance of getting back.”
“No!” Malfoy interrupted, worry running itself all over his face. “No.. There’s no need for that.” He awkwardly smiled.
Harry didn’t know how he was ever going to be able to sleep when Malfoy’s breathing was so loud. He tried to anyways, pushing his head into the pillow and shutting his eyes, his body rigid as a post.
Harry stopped all movement, even his leg shaking under the table – which Draco hadn’t even been aware of until he’d stopped. He ran his tongue around the inside of his mouth, leaving an indent on his cheeks.
“Fine,” Harry agreed. “I’ll be back in ten.” Harry waved, leaving the kitchen to stumble down to the corner shop.
Harry read through the practically illegible scrawl and then stared at the owl, who was calmly waiting on the sill.
Whilst Harry’s concern was annoying, it warmed Draco with endearment. He didn’t want to do anything wrong.
“Good night.” Harry muttered, pressing a final peck to the slightly curled hair at the base of Draco’s neck.
Now when Harry pushed in, he somehow managed to reach even deeper into Malfoy’s body. This time Draco couldn’t contain his moans. His whole life he had thought that pornstars were just faking how good sex was. But now, with Harry’s dick deep inside him, he felt himself turn into a moaning mess beneath him.
Finally, after casting a drying spell, he picked up a white and painted a vignette over the drying paints. Illuminating the clashing colours with a white outline, shading it into the creases of what had previously been a dark green spike.
“Did you plan this?” Malfoy speculated, his long, lean hands moving to rest on the table. Harry gulped and stuttered out his panicked reply.
Harry fiddled with his sleeves as he stumbled over, a warm smile growing on Draco’s face. His gaze dropped to Harry’s chest as he raised an eyebrow.
With out a word, Harry pulled Malfoy’s fingers out and dipped his own index finger into Draco’s ring, gasping at the warm, soft skin of Draco’s arse.
“Just turn the bloody thing off!”, Harry immediately turned it off, with no hesitation. “Thank Merlin, I’d almost gone insane.” She joked.
“Why not?” Winston asked, completely unbothered by Draco’s insults. He turned his face to Harry and in a hushed tone said “I’ve always liked the pre’ty ones.”
Harry lifted his eyes back up to the dance floor and decided to wait, surely, he’d see Malfoy at some point.
“Oh my God.” Lily said, once again. “As if seeing your doppelganger today wasn’t enough. We’ve found one for Lucius too!”
He chose one of his nicer dark green button ups, but strategically left the top two buttons undone. Maybe he should tie them up? Or should he undo another one? He undid his third button down. Great, now he just looked like a pale, spanish pornstar. He did it back up again.
Which is how he found himself now sat on the living room floor with the radio on full volume and a (still incomplete) puzzle resting before him. He had reasoned -in desperation- that if he played music loud enough, he wouldn’t be able to hear these ridiculous, incessant thoughts. However, Harry’s antics appeared to be driving a heavily pregnant (and hormonal) Hermione Granger to madness.
“No. You can tell me anything Harry.” Malfoy continued rubbing Harry’s cheek. Harry sighed and leaned into it. He took a deep breath.
“Can I have trim on the top, but keep it long, and just smooth out the sides, please.” The man asked, Harry nodded. “Oh, and can you make sure the cut is really even? The last guy I went to cut it so bad.”
“What was that?” Harry asked, brushing his nose against Malfoy’s and listening out for a second hitch in the blond’s breath.
Now that Harry looked at Draco properly, he could see that his hands were still shaking and he looked a bit like a hurt puppy dog. It reminded him of the young Draco being rejected of Harry’s friendship. Harry waved his hand at Draco. Making him come and sit next to Harry on the couch.
“Well… we’ve found the first thing to fix.” Hermione said, trying to hide the grimace overtaking her features.
A loud crash from across the street pulled him out of his thoughts. He paused in his cutting to look out of the window.
“That’s nice to know…” Harry took a long sip of tea. “Speaking of, why don’t you tell me about your new, famous potion.” Harry smiled, Malfoy took in a deep breath and held it for a second.
The were both breathing in short pants, their hands gripping onto each other’s. Harry stood, dragging Draco up with him as they walked hand in hand to the staircase. They descended slowly, almost as if they were scared for what was about to happen, but by the time they reached the bottom, Harry was punched with a wave of emotion.
After renting their skates, Draco was quick to put them on, Harry could sense the excitement from him, even if he were trying to play off.
Harry dropped his hands back to his sides and now he could see that the light that was once gone had returned to Draco’s eyes.
Malfoy pulled himself off of the beds, the sheets draping away from his body elegently. He took a few steps towards the wardrobe and the subtle wobble of Draco’s arse made Harry’s already spent cock attempt to fill once again.
He read over the letter again, and again, and a fourth time just to be sure. He didn’t even know what to think. He wasn’t angry at Draco anymore, he knew that. If anything, Harry was ready to go back to Draco.
The waitress came out with two cups of coffee followed by their food. Harry looked over it with excitement as his stomach rumbled like thunder.
“How about I give you some breakfast and then we can head down and have a look around the house, it’ll be easier to figure it out when we get there.”
“These look lovely Harry!” Mia adored from behind him, she’d spent the morning trimming and priming the bushes all around the house, which was evident by the splotches of dirt all over her clothes. “I can’t wait to see them finished.”
“If you head upstairs, I’ll follow and show you the different things I have on offer.” Malfoy moved to one side, allowing Harry to step past him.
He’d managed to make the whole day avoiding his evident attraction to Malfoy, but at this point, he couldn’t avoid it. He was used to having about one wet dream a night about the boy, which was how he’d lived for the past week, but three was just too many. The result of these dreams left him with an extremely hard, and painful case of blue balls.
“Cool.” Cole said. Just as awkwardly as before. He let out a deep breath. “What are you doing in Diagon then?”
“James! Why are you ignoring me?” His eyes shot open, revealing the delicate face of Lily Potter. “Oh My God, I am so sorry!” She apologised, her hand covering a laugh. “I thought you were my husband!”
“I don’t know what your talking about.” Draco took a step back, feeling his bum press up against the kitchen counter. Harry took a step closer.
“Hello there, I’m guessing you’re here about the house.” She greeted in a small, high-pitched voice.
This time, they were rewarded by the click click click of what must’ve been ten locks being undone. The door slithered open to reveal a small house elf, in a pillowcase. Harry choked. It was Dobby.
“Nothing more than a whore, letting me fuck you like this.” Harry’s hand falls into rhythm with his thrusts. “And you love it, having a little slut. Don’t you?”
“Shhh,” Harry moved so close that his nose was only a hairs width away from Draco’s. “I think we both know what you did.”
“Think of this as a preview, Potter.” Malfoy whispered lowly. “And trust me, you’ll come back for more, they always do.”
“Take a guess.” Harry looked around the circle, his eyes pausing when they landed on Malfoy, who’s predatory gaze was locked on Harry.
“He hasn’t told you yet?” Harry asked, ignoring the twinge of jealousy that Cole could talk to Malfoy.
“Don’t even try it Parkinson, I’m going with truth.” He insisted. She sulked for a few seconds, looking around the circle for inspiration.
To Harry’s surprise, Draco didn’t choke or splutter around the champagne bottle. He seemed to be able to drink back the explosive top of the bottle with no problem.
“I was just leaving actually, but hopefully you two will have fun.” Hermione replied, slowly beginning her walk towards the gate.
To start with, you could see Hermione’s teacup shaking with how hard she was gripping it. Her eyes going wide when Harry explained their living situation.
“Ooooh, What’s the gender.” Ginny asked excitedly, Harry supposed that Ron and Hermione wouldn’t care too much if Harry told Ginny.
Then suddenly Malfoy’s orgasm hits him and his white spurt of cum shoots up and onto Harry’s stomach.
“I said to lie down.” He commanded again. Harry leant his back down to the floor, feeling his nerve endings stand on high as the cold penetrated through his shirt.
or anyone else. He was perfect to me, he didn’t worship me and don’t you dare even say that he didn’t deserve me! He deserved the world, he was so pure and loving, he was just scared! He was a scared, little boy when you knew him. But he’s changed so much, and I’ve never met someone anything like him!”
The light streaming in through the curtained window slowly woke him up. He cursed the sun, he felt so well rested that he didn’t want to wake up. He hadn’t woken up during the night, not even once, and that hadn’t happened since he’d gotten here three years ago.
The two stepped out of the basement and were greeted by Mia stood by the kitchen door with a mug of tea in her hand.
Harry’s bedroom, however, was decorated in true Gryffindor fashion. Although the red colour scheme and four-poster bed wasn’t fashionable in anyway, something about the memory of his life at Hogwarts comforted Harry to no end. There was a four-poster double bed in the centre of the room. Alongside a leather sitting chair and a work table, which was currently drowned in piles upon piles of his sketches. Harry had gotten his closet from Ron and Hermione’s house. There was no point in buying everything new anyways.
. He hadn’t woken up this late for years. He looked back to the window to see an auburn brown owl pecking away at the glass pane of his window.
“Then I thought, to celebrate your newfound sexuality, we could have a go at going to a gay club.” Ginny proposed, her voice going nervously high-pitched.
Harry squinted at the sunlight streaming into his room. He’d forgotten to close the bloody curtain. Aches and pains ran up and down his entire body, echoes of sleeping in a far too uncomfortable position.
“It’s not stupid…” Malfoy still didn’t look up. “Look… Maybe we couldn’t have been friends in Hogwarts, but why not now?”
Draco took the two plates over to the table and placed one in front of Harry and the other in his own space. Draco chuckled at Harry’s expression.
Harry tried to make a word but Harry was so overwhelmed by Draco’s tight warmth the he couldn’t pick one and failed, instead choosing an incoherent moaning groan. Draco’s eyes closed of their own accord and his mouth opened wide in a silent scream when he dropped himself back down again. He moved his hands down to rest onto Harry’s chest, giving himself some extra support when this time he raised himself one… two…. Three… four inches higher before dropping back down again.
“Why are you so insistent that I forgive him?” Harry snapped. Ginny’s eyebrows furrowed at Harry, her eyes giving his face a once over.
Draco Malfoy? As in ex-death eater, prostitute, genius potions master Draco Malfoy?” Draco’s body flinched at her words, like she’d physically hurt him, not just spoken.
And all couples had little blips, right? Sure, most of them were just arguments about family and not drug rings, but they were all still just little blips.
Then a hand appeared over the back of Malfoy’s hips, digging their fingers into his hipbones. Harry glanced up to see another man, he looked fairly similar to Harry, except a bit taller and larger.
Therefore, he was perfectly justified to approach his head Auror office with his wand clutched tightly in one hand and his mildly crushed croissant in the other. Maybe he was being just a tid bit paranoid, but he always trusted his gut. It was
“Painting?” Malfoy questioned, settling his cup tantalisingly close to his crotch. Draco didn’t ignore the way Harry’s eyes followed his mug.
Hermione shoved a sketch Harry made of one of his flower choices in his hands, “Look how good your shading is!” She complemented, pointing to random pieces of paper and shoving them each to Harry separately.
It was too much to take in. He looked just how Draco had remembered, but something about having Harry willingly naked in front of him made it a thousand times hotter. Draco thought he might come solely from touching Harry, and oh merlin did he want to touch Harry. His back itched with the need to feel his warm skin beneath the tips of his fingers. His hand wished to feel the weight of Harry’s dark, long cock in his hands, he wanted to breathe Harry in, never let him go and stay with him in this state forever.
“Malfoy.” Harry greeted, proud his voice was strong, despite the feeling that he hadn’t drank for five years. He took a quick sip of his (fifth) Gin and tonic of the night.
He’d expected a chuckle or for Malfoy to suddenly push him away, but instead he heard a small gasp drop from Malfoy’s lips. They sat frozen like that, neither knowing quite how to continue, before Harry reached a hand out to Malfoy.
“Well, I wasn’t sure about your budget or your styles, so I sort of went with everything they had.” She turned around to pull a tray out of the oven. “I have a small file of each house that I picked out, so you can cross a few off of the list now, maybe get it down to ten.” She suggested.
So, Harry made his way into the café. There weren’t many seats, maybe five tables in total, but there was one that was small and circular with a single chair tucked under it that seemed to be calling Harry’s name. Harry checked his wristwatch. Five pm. Still early enough for a coffee. Harry dropped his coat on the table and then walked up to the counter.
Then he dipped his brushes into a dark black (which for whatever reason was a horrible colour to find a good quality of) and flicked dots of black onto the canvas. Dirtying the pristine spikes with grime and dark. Making them hardly resemble what they once were. Harry soon stopped with the flicks, deciding that perhaps, he had added to much black to the painting.
Draco met each thrust of his fingers against himself, bobbing up and down against Harry’s hardwood door. The hand on his dick sped up as he imagined the exact image that he’d walked in on, him bent over with his arse in the air and Harry savagely thrusting in and out of him, using him like a doll.
“Don’t worry Harry, I can see why that seems scary. When I moved out, I’d never been alone before, I hardly knew how to live on my own – seeing as I came from such a large family.” She began, moving away from him to lean back on the sofa.
“Whatever, here is our case. Read through it quickly, I’ll apparate us up there in five minutes.” Harry explained, returning to his paperwork. Grimacing at how scratchy his handwriting looked on the page.
“I am!” His shout left silence in the room for a few seconds before his sighed, and in a weaker voice, he continued.
“Sorry, Harry. It’s my first day.” He smiled before turning on his heel and leaving to the break room.
Harry paused to think for a second. Maybe meeting up with Ginny would be a good thing. She was always up for a good night out and she might even distract him from Malfoy for at least a few hours.
The Gryffindor slowly let his fingers walk down from Malfoy’s neck to his shoulders, collarbone, chest, stomach, hip, pelvis before letting them wander around to squeeze the firm muscle of Draco’s arse. Draco gasped when Harry’s calloused hands grasped down on the muscle, tugging his arse cheeks apart.
“I’ll just have a fried egg if you’re making, got to get my protein in the mornings.” He smiled, casting a joking gaze to Draco. Draco shot a passive-aggressive smile back at him, feigning some form of chivalry.
He let himself fantasise -only for a second- of him opening the door, them locking eyes for a split second and then having rampant sex on the couch.
“Okay, Okay I get it. I’ll have a shower. I should have time.” Harry glanced down to his (slightly grimey) watch.
Draco looked so small, his shoulders hunched and fingers twisting into one another. His eyes were shooting around Harry as if he was scared to even look at him. He looked just as tired as he had the few nights before, deep circles lying beneath his eyes.
Harry felt his prick twitch in approval of Malfoy’s movements. He tried to make himself look away; he really didn’t need to have a bloody hard-on from the thought of Malfoy.
The shock of the steely grey eyes made Harry flinch back, which obviously tested Malfoy’s patience, who swiftly leaned forward and attached his lips to Harry’s.
He figured that his reply would get the message across well enough and tied the small note back onto the owl’s leg.
Malfoy continued grinding back against the man, however, Malfoy himself didn’t appear to have any noticeable erection tenting his pants. How the hell Malfoy could do that and not be hard as a pole – Harry had no clue.
Her eyes flicked to the dance floor and then back to Harry, then she did it again. Then a third time just to be sure.
“Well you better work for it then.” Harry pushed his face onto Malfoy’s, wrapping their lips once again, except this time their tongues were both fighting against each other, making it fast and aggressive.
Once the delivery men had left, the whole process had sped up ten-fold. The three of them managed to wingardium half the furniture in and make the rest of it weightless, meaning that most of the rooms were filled within the hour.
Harry closed his eyes and pretended to be asleep, hoping that it wasn’t completely obvious that he was awake. He heard Malfoy’s breath hitch for a moment and his head move to look at Harry. His breathing paused.
Harry could hardly take the waves of pleasure that radiated through him with every thrust of Malfoy’s skilled fingers, with every curl of Malfoy wet tongue and every squeeze of Malfoy’s hands into his arse.
“Merlin, I’m going to cum so hard.” Harry breathes. “I’m gonna…” He leans over Draco, hips taking short, rutting thrusts, his lips near Draco’s ear.
After a few seconds, Draco felt his body give way to the intrusion, relaxing around Harry, almost as if he wanted to pull him in further.
“Get on with it.” Catherine shouted from the side, causing Malfoy to immediately grab the back of Cole’s head and smash their lips together. Harry soon realised that he had never actually watched two people kiss this closely before and he was struck with the question of: why the hell hadn’t he?
. “-my parents are very religious, I kind of hope I just end up with a girl, so I look outwardly straight.” Cole confessed, sadly peering into his coffee cup again.
Then it was all too good to be true when Harry remembered the whole crowded room was watching him. Harry frantically jumped away from Malfoy, causing the two men to bash foreheads together.
When Draco moved over to the fridge to pull out the bacon, he heard the high pitched, grating voice of Harry’s date (Tim, was it?) start talking.
Harry only ever asked him to hide The Prophet when he’d brought home a muggle. What was his thing with muggles recently? The past five he’d brought home were all muggles.
“Yeah, of course, that’s fine.” Harry munched down on the last slice of pancake. “I better go and get some stuff ready. He informed them, pulling himself off the table to walk up the staircase.
“What’s hard to explain, Potter?” Harry looked down to the time turner pieces in his hand, the rest were in a jewellery box in his flat, he needed to bring these back.
“Let go. I’ll walk you.” Draco shot Harry a doubting glance before finally letting go of the bar, his weight immediately tossed onto Harry, tightening his hold on the man. “That’s more like it.” Harry complimented, rubbing his hand lightly on Draco’s wrist in a comforting gesture.
“God, I’m so sorry, Malfoy.” Harry placed his hand on Malfoy’s shoulder, Draco leaned into it for a second before shrugging it off.
Once his nerves had calmed and he could take in his surroundings, he looked at the body in his office chair with a dumbfounded expression.
“No! Not at all! I came here to talk to Cole.” He explained. Whilst his original intent wasn’t necessarily to talk to Cole, he had spoken to the man, so it wasn’t really a lie. Malfoy’s eyebrows immediately furrowed.
“We did spend loads of time together, Draco. But most of it always ended in sex, we never really got to know each other, spend time talking instead.”
“But I still need to file a report for my recipe. I’ve looked everywhere and I can’t find it.” Malfoy’s eyebrows furrowed.
He was not sure if this was working at all but judging by the silence of the circle around him, he presumed he was doing a good job.
“Oh my word, how did you cook this, Harry?” Draco asked, amazed as he shoved another spoon full into his mouth. “It’s delicious.”
“I’ll have a hot chocolate, please. Get me something sweet as well.” Harry strolled passed to grab their usual seats by the windows. Two comfy leather chairs, with cushions and throw blankets resting on top.
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed as he pulled away from the kiss, shooting Malfoy an inquisitive look before shimmying backwards between Draco’s legs and lifting one to rest above his shoulder- so that his view was unobstructed.
He walked down the pavement, suddenly aware that every person around him seemed to have a very peculiar fashion sense. He took particular notice of a tall man sporting double denim and his girlfriend who was wearing a neon pair of bell bottom pants with a curly perm.
Malfoy whimpered beneath Harry, his legs tugging tighter around Harry’s shoulders. In the time that Harry had spent ogling the buttplug, Malfoy had already grown too needy and was pumping his cock long and hard with one hand whilst the other was circling his loose, wet hole.
“Oh yeah, one-hundred percent. It’s easier for me here, I’m not quite so scared of my parents finding out about my sexuality… And if I miss them, they’re only an owl away.”
“You can say that again.” Ron agreed, a disbelieving laugh dropping from his lips as he said it. “Speaking of which, a new case came in yesterday about a drug ring in France.” He digressed, letting the conversation lull into the usual topics.
Mia had began to pop around every other day that Harry was here now. Although it was a bit odd that the previous house’s owner was constantly showing up, Harry accepted any extra help with open arms.
“Whether I hate you or not, you are the only thing from my old life I’ve seen in the past three years.  Meaning that currently, you are the only thing proving to me I’m not insane and didn’t dream it all. Anyways, we could always start over. Call a truce? Be friends?”
“ ‘kay, I’ll be back in a sec’” She whizzed off the sofa and down to a separate room, which Harry assumed to be the bar.
Draco nods furiously, moving his arm away from his mouth onto the headboard behind him, both of his hands needed to stop his body from being pushed into the board.
“It’s absolutely insane, I mean I didn’t believe you when you said you were actually going to fix this place up, and it only took you like -what- a month, two months?”
“Yes.” Malfoy answered, Harry felt his groin begin to fill as even more images of Malfoy in compromising positions popped into his mind. “If the price was right.” Harry cleared his throat.
“Wha-“ Malfoy looked down to his Auror robes and then back up at Harry. “Did you… change clothes?” Malfoy asked, furrowing his eyebrows at Harry, “And get a haircut?”
It had been about twelve days since Harry had met Malfoy at Cole’s party and Harry felt extremely proud of himself. The task of fixing up the cottage and designing the gardens had almost completely taken his mind off of the blond. He had even found a passion in flower design, the intricate nature of the aesthetics could distract Harry for hours. The only time Harry’s mind would stray back to Malfoy’s propositions were late at night when he was kept awake with the blurry images his mind would create.
Malfoy turned to face Harry, his face dropped from focused to confused for a second, before a small smile settled on his lips.
Whilst Harry wanted nothing more than to feel Malfoy’s pure heat wrapped around him, the sincerity of their conversation had planted other ideas into Harry’s head. Maybe he was ready. Maybe he would let Malfoy take his virginity.
“I think that could be arranged.” Harry replied, letting his eyes drift shut as Draco flicked and swirled his tongue back and forth.
“Hello you two, I brought some biscuits.” Mia greeted from the gate, walking through with a newspaper in one hand and a packet of digestives in the other. “Wow, you two work quick, it looks just like it did when I was a girl.” She beamed, approaching the two and chucking the biscuits at Harry, which he caught with his seeker reflexes.
“Have you been drinking Carlsberg, Cole? Disgusting stuff.” He muttered, a grimace set on his reddened lips. Cole’s eyes appeared to be glazed over as he stared up at Malfoy.
“Okay, I’m just going to get changed now, can you keep your eyes closed?” Harry asked, turning back around to look at Malfoy, who still had his hand covering his eyes.
Malfoy had taken the lead between the two men, one arm wrapping up around the back of Cole’s head whilst the other was dangled carelessly on his shoulder. Cole made no effort to move either of his arms, instead just leaning back on them. Whilst Malfoy looked like a sex god, the kiss itself was relatively tame, it was kept between lips with no tongue whatsoever, but that didn’t stop a jealous lurch from spiking through Harry’s stomach. Harry hadn’t realised he’d cared about Cole so much, because he definitely wasn’t jealous for Malfoy. No, definitely not.
He squinted out at his curtains, hating how bright the sun seemed to be today. Then the memories all came flooding back to him. He’d walked in on Harry.
Harry dreaded to think what that statement meant. Did Alex want to have sex? Maybe just a blow job? What ever it was, Harry felt a small bubble of dread.
Suddenly, Malfoy pulled his hand away and ran it over his clothes confusedly until he found what he wanted. He pulled out the wood of his wand and pointed it towards Harry. Harry didn’t even feel the need to flinch at Draco pointing a wand in his direction. Malfoy cast a lubrication spell at Harry, Harry gasped at the new sensation of the cold lube filling up his arse. He fidgeted around on the bed slightly as Draco watched on in awe.
By six pm, Harry had gotten home and immediately clumped on his bed to sleep. The whole renovation thing was really tiring him out.
It felt as if everything had fallen into place. The living room was adorned with two sofas, one a dark grey and one plaid, each pressed against separate walls, blankets were slung over each of the couches – making them emanate warmth and affability. A small, low coffee table was sat between the two, along with a new TV rested on a wooden oak stand.
Which is a good thing, he concluded. He didn’t want to look too eager. Hopefully Malfoy wouldn’t mind.
“How are you dealing with it, honestly?” Cole’s eyes seemed to bore into Harry’s and it made him shuffle where he was sitting.
When he left the bathroom and found himself back in the hallway, Harry noticed that one of the doors was ajar, a yellow light shining out.
Meanwhile, Malfoy had the biggest shit-eating-grin settled across his face. Harry pushed his eyes down to the floor.
“No not at all, I think it’s amazing actually.” Draco’s body relaxed. “I mean to be forced into being a death eater-“
He quickly reattached their lips, pushing Harry down further into the covers and grinding his hips down onto Harry.
“You still eat exactly the same as you did in Hogwarts. Like a pig.” Harry took a second to chew before speaking up.
“Let me have a look.” Harry stepped away from Malfoy, Draco let out a small whimper at Harry’s movement. Harry needed to keep his cool, he had an hour and a half. He didn’t want it to be over in five minutes flat.
“I think, no matter how annoying you can be, I’d really miss you if I left alone.” Harry’s heart warmed. “Also, everyone back in two-thousand-and-four would definitely think I’d murdered you if I went back alone, I mean it looks pretty suspect anyways.”
“There was this light flash and I felt like I’d been chucked up into the sky, then when I fell back down, I was in 1977.”
Ginny on the other hand was absolutely ecstatic, so full of energy that Harry wouldn’t have been surprised if a beam of light shot out from her with accidental magic. She’d been rocking the new-born back and forth for a few minutes after the mid-wife had checked her, leaving a wide smile across Ginny’s face as she spoke in a ridiculous voice to the baby, who obviously had no idea what Ginny was saying.
Harry straddled his legs on top of Malfoy on the bed, trapping Malfoy under his weight. Malfoy lifted his hand to Harry’s jaw, where Harry took Draco’s other hand and set it on his own hip. Tenderly, Draco reached to Harry’s glasses and pulled them away from his face, setting them on the bedside cabinet. When they met eyes again, Draco seemed to get lost, unable to break the contact.
“We’re thankful that you’ve still got it on the market.” Hermione piped up. “I could hardly believe that it hadn’t been bought yet.”
It was very palatable (for a herbal tea) and left a lovely buttery aftertaste on his tongue. He normally only ever drank builders tea, but perhaps he would (maybe) allow a cup of popcorn tea every once in a while.
“It’s a bit emptier than usual actually!” She shouted back. “I’ll sit here, can you go to the bar and buy me a drink?” She plonked herself down onto the bench.
Harry gripped Draco’s chin with his free hand and turned his face towards him, so that their eyes were closely locked.
Damien was actually a very worthy partner for Harry (which annoyed Draco to no end). He was muggle but worked as a doctor in a London Hospice. He was extremely charming, (he’d even managed to make Draco’s knees go weak a few times) and was brilliant at complements.
He picked up the newspaper, ready to put it to one side and go to sleep when a small envelop rolled out of one of the pages, swooping down to the ground with a subtle thump.
“So are you going to confess your unrequited love for me as well or have I just embarrassed myself and this was all one sided?” Malfoy joked, finally meeting Harry’s eyes.
“Is this okay?” He asked, lowering his head frustratingly close to Draco’s erection. His pink, aggravated, wet lips looked so appetising that Draco was half tempted to thrust up into them.
“Of course I’m not serious, Harry.” Draco rolled his eyes. “Meanwhile, I was expecting to have your cock in my arse by this point so can we leave the small talk for later.”
“Malfoy’s a big boy, I’m sure he can handle himself.” Kingsley’s face contorted, he seemed quite desperate now. “I’ll give you a pay rise if necessary?”
Harry finally looked up to meet her eyes, they were warm and nurturing, there wasn’t even an ounce of judgement in them.
“What do you mean?” Cole asked, looking around himself and leaning in, like he was finding out some top tier gossip.
Harry stayed so still, his body straining with the effort of not moving. His eyes were now closed and he was biting his bottom lip, a pained look on his face and fast breaths falling from his lips.
“Here’s your order.” A young girl carefully placed Malfoy’s order in front of him, swiftly leaving without another word.
Draco pulled himself over to Harry’s side of the bed and his eyes immediately jumped when he saw what Harry was holding.
“Don’t bother  the small talk Potter, I know that’s not what you’re here for.” Malfoy grabbed Harry’s hand and shook it anyways, holding on for slightly longer than strictly necessary. “So, what are you here for?” Malfoy asked, a predatory smirk adorning his face for what felt like the millionth time. Harry felt himself go weak at the knees.
“Haven’t got anything planned at the moment.” Harry informed, reaching down to pop another puzzle piece in place. They settled in silence for a few seconds before Hermione shot him a disapproving look.
“No! Wait-” Draco slammed the door shut behind his back and immediately fell down onto the floor in front of it.
Anyways, his situation seemed to be a blessing in disguise. He’d never made quite so many paintings in his life. He must’ve made about four per day. They were all dark and jagged, even the life portraits of his garden always seemed to put emphasis on the shadows.
“Don’t worry, I’ve got a few rental contracts filed away anyways.” Malfoy smiled, showed them a courteous wave and turned around.
Draco does nothing but let out a string of incoherent words into his arm, practically screaming with pleasure. Pre-come dribbling down liberally from his cock, coating the shaft with a glossy shine. Harry reaches his hand down to stroke Draco’s silky cock.
“Well then Harry. Would you like to dance?” Harry practically choked on how dry his throat suddenly felt.
The pressure in his head was building and building, it had been since they’d left the Leaky. It was insufferable.
“I dare you to strip tease.” Malfoy dared, his eyes filling with amusement. The whole circle looked around at Harry, wondering whether he’d accept.
The two fingers twisted gently inside him, making him flinch a little bit when the same sensation hit him. The fingers rooting inside him were now surprisingly comfortable, warm and wet, moving smoothly. Now he was aware of Draco’s erection pressed against the inside of his thigh -he hadn’t even noticed that he’d taken his pants off at some point.
Harry felt his heart skip a beat whilst he stumbled up into the middle of the circle. Every member of the game appeared to be watching Harry with rapt interest. “What do you want me to strip down to?” He asked, feeling a blush strike up his face and sink down to his chest.
They were quite nice, he supposed, a dark leather jacket with dark jeans with a button up top. Not too different to what he normally wore to work, but Draco insisted they were “completely different to your work clothes” and that Harry just didn’t “Have an eye for fashion.”
Harry looked up to Draco’s resting body. He was in a sleep so deep Harry was sure a troll attack wouldn’t even wake him up.
Draco began to drop little kisses onto Harry’s shoulder, making him relax into Draco, making the movements of his fingers a little easier until suddenly it hit Harry.
Harry felt like he was intruding on something very private. It didn’t feel like he should be in the room.
“I sure hope little Harry comes out even half as dashing as the bloke” James remarked, Lily rolled her eyes.
“I can’t believe you only got muggle furniture Harry.” Hermione complained, “It would be so much faster if we could just use magic to move things.”
“No, I’m good thanks.” Harry declined, shimmying the shoe off of his foot and swapping to the other.
Which Draco really couldn’t blame her for, his father did plant Ginny with a horcrux and Draco himself had been a dick to the Weasleys for years, but the uncomfortable gaze she gave him always made Draco regret everything he’d ever done to the family.
He was at the cottage, sipping on his morning coffee when an owl knocked on one of his windows, from it’s leg, Harry could see the Daily Prophet, with a large red bow pinned to the top.
Harry looked down between their bodies for a moment and Draco felt the tip of his erection align with his entrance. Draco gripped his arms, felt the strength of them, Harry’s whole body was vibrating with tension, and then he pushed forward, and Draco’s mouth dropped when he felt the stretch. The two let out matching groans when the head submerged itself through the tight ring of muscle.
“Hi. Just checking, you do know this is a date, right? Because I am definitely thinking it’s a date and just want to make sure that you are not having one of your ‘I’m in denial about liking men phases’ and that we’re both on the same page here.” Draco rushed through a wide, white smile, moving his hands back and forth as he spoke.
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed as he shuffled back on the bed further. Draco couldn’t ignore the heat in his gaze now that he had an unobstructed view of his fingers circling Draco’s arse.
“How much does she weigh?” Harry asked, directing his question to Hermione, but she didn’t even seem aware that Harry was in the room, let alone that he was talking to her. Ron answered instead, in a low whisper of a voice.
Harry repeated again, his thrusting animalistic, not stopping for a seconds breath, using Malfoy like he was nothing more than a doll. It was just what Harry needed. With each thrust a grunt fell from Harry’s lips, sweat droplets forming on his forehead from exertion, but he couldn’t stop. It was never ending, pounding into Draco without mercy. Draco’s mouth swapped between falling open in loud moans to grinding his teeth shut against each other, an attempt to silence his screams. Harry braced his hands beside Draco’s chest and moved back and forth, back and forth, so fast that their bodies appeared to be blurring together.
Draco had collapsed fastest and to avoid crushing the man, Harry had landed in a push up position with the blond rested below him, their torsos above one another.
“Hi Draco.” Harry greeted, one of his hands snaking to tuck into the hoodie pocket. Draco took a step away from him in response.
“Do you want to sleep with me?” Harry asked, making Malfoy’s breath pause, Harry rubbed his thumb in circles against Draco’s cheek.
Then he settled on fixing his hair. The black strands on his head had always been wild, especially in his youth, but now he’d learnt the magic of hair cutting spells.
After a little while though, Draco needed to feel Harry’s skin against his, so he pulled back – only for a second – to pull Harry’s shirt over his head and drop the fabric back down onto the floor. Draco rested his hands on Harry’s arse again and squeezed, finally pressing his own clothed erection to Harry’s, making him gasp.
“We should head over to your house, I’ve got a few things to put up in the basement.” Malfoy explained, chugging his coffee down.
He hooked his thumbs into the elastic of his waist band and pulled his trousers and underwear down to his knees in one swift motion, forcing his cock to slap up against his stomach. He was painfully hard, precum beginning to drip from the swollen tip already.
“Maybe.” Harry announced. He wasn’t really buzzing with want for the guy, but he was attractive. He would be a good hook up, just to take Harry’s mind off Malfoy.
“So you’re not going to go back to Draco?” He asked with one eyebrow raised, Harry knew that no matter what he said, Cole knew what the real answer was.
Malfoy showed him a warm smile, it made Harry’s heart skip a beat. He snapped out of it and quickly pulled himself up from the ground, onto his feet. “I’ll go grab a shower.”
“Ya’know, I genuinely think you made the right decision leaving him. And I say well done.” Cole complemented. Harry ignored the frown he felt pull at his lips.
The plain brick walls poked at the corner of Harry’s mind. Did Harry know this place? Something about it stuck out like a sore needle. He chucked the paper down to the floor in frustration.
“I’m not going to,” Harry insisted. “I shouldn’t be with someone who thinks lying to me will make me like them.”
“Doggy would be less painful, but I think I would die if I couldn’t see your face whilst you came.” Malfoy explained, lining his aching cock up against Harry’s loosened hole.
It was almost too much, after all that waiting and denial, Harry almost couldn’t cope. He whimpered against Draco’s mouth, the salty residue smoothly being replaced with peppermint. Draco’s hands tightened against Harry’s back and he could feel them slowly descending onto his arse, each settling over one cheek before firmly squeezing the muscle.
“Hi Bethany.” Draco greeted his youngest Barista. She was only sixteen and had worked there since Draco opened the store two years ago. She was extremely shy when she’d first started, but in recent times, she’d really warmed to the place.
Just when Harry was about to drift off to sleep in Draco’s embrace, he heard a small whisper being pressed into his hair.
“I… I am.” He chuckled. “But you still notice it.” Harry pulled his hot chocolate for a sip before quickly placing it back down. “Oh Circe, he’s coming over here.” Draco turned to look at the approaching man.
“Oh, umm, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to… go out tonight… and, maybe, have a drink.” Harry stuttered out. Ginny stared at him blankly for a second. Then let her eyes drift as she thought about it.
, he saw him just five seconds earlier doing exactly that. Draco began to move his hand vigorously against his dick, the skin shuffling with his touch, each feather of pleasure building until Draco was arching his back against the door. He thrust up into his hand, imagining Harry whispering small, dirty words into his ear. About his arse and cock and how hard he was going to fuck him.
“I might be wrong, but…” Harry was only a few inches away now, Draco could feel the heat of Harry’s body radiating over to his, “I found a little… mess… outside my door this morning. Had to do some cleaning.”
His mind drips in and out of consiousness, hardly able to hold a thought. Like a tide going out, only to come back in and get higher each time.
He lifted his hand back up to Draco’s waist, but the movements unsettled the Slytherin. Draco’s intake of breath had thrown their balance, chucking them both to the floor.
“But now I can see the basement in front of me, I realise that the whole problem was me lying to myself, if you know what I mean.”
potion. Harry had read an article about it in the Prophet only a few weeks ago. An underground ring of Somnomsatanas was being dispersed, it was known to knock out the patients cold, stronger than any sleeping spell out there. It’s theorised that they would be under until an antidote was delivered, but no antidote had been found yet, leaving hundreds of bodies in storage at St.Mungos.
The bright light danced over the muscles in Draco’s shoulders, caught in his reflective hair, illuminating the telling shine at the head of his cock. Harry watched Draco’s chest rise and fall as he breathed… as he barely even wanked.
His stomach rumbled just reading the names of the various desserts, each sounding more like heart attack central than the last.
“Mia, will you help me carry this couch inside?” Harry asked, walking around the wrapped sofa and grabbing one end.
Draco opened his legs a bit wider and brought his free hand down to rest between his thighs, leaving his other hand to teasingly flutter up and down the shaft of his erection. Slowly, he let his finger brush against the sensitive skin of his arsehole. He bristled at the touch.
Draco had set up the snack table elegantly and efficiently (as any Malfoy would), only occasionally pausing to scold Harry for his lack of finesse. It was ridiculous, the man had tried to put the sour cream and cheese celery stick right next to the chocolate biscuits! How unappetising!
“No! Tell me now, Malfoy.” Harry stood up, pointing a finger at Malfoy’s face. He felt some of his anger dissolve when he saw how wet Draco’s eyes were. “Please, you can trust me.”
“Fucking Potter! Please, please.” Draco began to beg, still unable to stop his grinding down onto Harry’s fingers. “More. Please, fuck. Fuck me Potter.”
“These chocolate biscuits really are lovely though.” George said, appearing out of no where from the opposite side of the table, three large biscuits resting in his palms.
His heart was nothing but a dull thud, only slightly accelerated when it lingered on the night he and Draco had had before his argument. It was all going too well. If only he’d found that box the night before when he was helping Malfoy, then he would have never made love with the twat and he would feel
Harry looked over his own shoulder, searching out for a flash of blond hair, pretended he wasn’t searching for Malfoy, telling himself that he was just looking around. Which Harry immediately muttered to himself was ridiculous as he was only lying to his own brain. However, when there was not a single blond hair in sight. Harry felt his heart drop slightly.
“Draco told me that you never got on with him in school. Quite the rivalry.” Harry nodded. “What was it that changed your mind?”
“That’s so cool.” Cole interjected, evidently not aware of the substantial amount of tension radiating between the two boys.
He imagined Harry leaning over him and shoving his hand to Draco’s front to wrap his fingers around Draco’s erection, hanging down in front of him with his desperate arse still begging in the air. Draco tugged from base to tip as he imagined Harry’s strong, calloused fingers massaging his length, making Draco squirm beneath his touch.
“It’s nice to be back. I haven’t been able to visit since we were in school.” Malfoy frowned, Harry felt a pull at his chest.
“I hate to say it, but it completely goes against Malfoy etiquette to let the house owner sleep on the floor.”
“You know I… I wasn’t really expecting you to come.” Malfoy admitted, his eyes glued to Harry’s hands working on his laces.
He chucked his long legs out of the bed, groaning when they got tangled in the sheets. The fire alarm was even louder now that he had the pillow off his ears. Normally Harry would’ve used magic to disable the fire alarm by this point, but as he hadn’t, Draco could only assume Harry had brought back a muggle man.
He almost burst into another round of tears upon seeing Draco’s face, kind and comforting. Oh Merlin, he felt like a toddler who’d grazed their knee.
He lugged himself out of bed, tugging at his legs when they got tangled in the sheets. His tossing and turning had left his entire body covered in a thin sheen of sweat, he was almost tempted to jump in the shower, but he fought against the urge. He was soon out of his room and in front of the kitchen sink with a clear glass in his hand, ready to be filled.
“Merlin, those waffles are bigger then I thought!” Harry awed at the blueberry covered dessert. Draco wasn’t looking at the waffles though, he was casting a peculiar glare in the direction of the kitchen. “Earth to Draco.”
Harry rolled his eyes and stared down at his now empty cup, he had wanted advice from Cole, not some-sort of weird gossip exchange.
“Fuck.” Malfoy mumbled. “I can’t believe it.” He moved forward and pushed Harry’s hand out of the way, wrapping his own palm around Harry’s cock. Finally feeling Malfoy’s hand on his erection made him whimper, squeezing his eyes shut. “I have the boy who lived naked and hard for me.”
“Come on Draco. I think we need some space.” Harry lowered a hand down to Draco’s quivering body, he hadn’t even noticed that tears were now streaming down his pale cheeks. He didn’t know when he had started crying, but he didn’t have the heart in him to care at that moment. Draco wrapped his hand in Harry’s and stood up, following the man into the kitchen.
“Look, the inside is really cool.” Harry reached for the plan of the house, showing her the document.  Her eyes glared at the paper for a second before alternating her gaze between the paper and the photos.
Harry peeked out of one eyeball. The idiot had his eyes squeezed shut, as if that would make him unrecognisable.
He flicked the tip of his wand and suddenly Harry’s legs were tugged into golden restraints against the other two posters of the bed, forcing him to be spread eagle in front on Malfoy. Malfoy’s eyes moved to focus on Harry’s crotch, intently examining the large bulge.
“Ooooo, the newspaper delivery is here.” Cole observed, standing up out of his chair to get one. “Maddie! Can you bring over Draco’s usual, pop it on my tab.” Cole shouted towards the cashier, pulling one of the newspapers out of the mesh bag they were in.
“Cool. Cool. Well you, sort of, put your head between my legs and , kinda, nuzzled against my… dick, I guess.” Harry’s head shot around the room, before meeting Draco’s dilated, black pupils. “Then you… palmed me through my underwear and asked me what I wanted. You even… put your finger on my… uhm… anyway… I asked for a blow job and yeah, you can figure out the rest, it’s not that hard.”  Harry sighed at his unfortunate choice of wording. “ I mean it was quite hard.”
He whipped out of bed, grunting when his legs got tangled up in the sheets. He chucked a muggle hoodie over his pyjama top and begrudgingly left his room to go through to the kitchen.
“How you’ve managed to convince yourself that I’ve never had any feelings for you, despite me using every possible trick in the book to make a move. For two years.”
Draco pulled back slightly and squinted at Harry’s cheek. He swiftly lifted his finger to his cheek and began rubbing at it.
“M’lady.” Harry tipped his head as Draco gripped onto his hand. Draco giggled (yes, giggled) and jumped up with the help of Harry’s hand.
“Ew, gross.” She grimaced, turning to chug some of her tea. “Well, anyways, you should go get that shower now, you’re covered in dirt.” Harry groaned.
The stall door flew open, and Harry hasted to push his cock back into his pants before reaching into his sock and pulling out his own wand, aiming it squarely in the face of the idiot who spelled the door open.
Harry smiled and plucked one spherical pastry out of the box. It seemed to be some sort of cinnamonney-cream concoction. He popped it into his mouth and the warm sweet taste of a cinnamon puff exploded on his tongue.
“Mmmhmm.” Draco replied, trying not to let the image of Harry fucking him into his mind. For only a moment, Draco couldn’t help himself and imagined Harry fully sheathed inside of him, but the image was ruined when he pictured Tim in place of himself.
Harry looked down to see that his body was rested on a large, four poster, double bed with embroidered green sheets lining them. The bed itself was extremely comfortable and felt like a cloud underneath Harry’s back.
“We need to look around my house.” Malfoy looked like a small child as he spoke, bottom lip pouted out and large eyes tearing up at Harry. It made Harry’s heart whimper.
“They’ll want to do a house check.” Malfoy explained. “…And I used to be a p-prostitute. Remember? That’s illegal.” Draco fiddled with his fingers, unable to meet Harry’s eyes.
Harry paused to think. A strip tease wasn’t the worst dare, he supposed. In fact, he could think of ten worse things off of the top of his head.
Ginny, however, looked shockingly unperturbed by the outburst, her face settling on a curious expression.
“See, just like I said. You are far to forgiving.” He smiled, the hand resting on Draco’s lower back drawing small circles into the fabric.
He hadn’t had a wet dream since his school days and, frankly,  a twenty-five-year-old man should not be put in the position that the only action he gets are in his dreams. Harry felt the sharp pang of shame bubble in his belly.
“What about the alleyway?” He ran behind her, pointing out the photo, the force of his finger almost crumpling the page.
“That’s insane! You have to meet him! He looks exactly like you! The only difference is your eyes!” She examined, stepping closer to Harry in amazement.
“For all that is holy, Malfoy, can you just leave?” Harry flopped down onto his own office chair, rubbing his hand over his face. Whilst it would be best for Draco to leave, part of his heart was already mourning his departure.
Harry moved to one of the tables next to the window, two chairs were placed around a small square table. The chairs were coated in dark brown leather, studded with small gold pins. Harry took a seat in one of them and daydreamed out the window until his order came, along with a resigned-looking Cole.
He spoke to the girl for a few minutes, she had a similar style to Cole with black hair, but she had pink streaks dyed into it. She also came with a personality on par with an energizer bunny.
“Don’t worry, there’s no hard feelings.” He accepted, almost annoyingly forgiving, “We’re all men. Nothing that interesting to see.” He laughed.
“Anyways, now you’re on maternity leave, you can help me house search.” Hermione’s face lit up. She’d always loved interior design; she discovered her love for it when her and Ron had first moved in. Harry had supposed their house was
His room was dark, the only light coming from the street outside. It felt almost inappropriate to turn the lights in his room on at this hour in the morning. He felt a shiver run up his spine, his room definitely wasn’t this cold when he’d left.
“No, there’s extension charms across the whole cottage.” Hermione’s eyes practically bulged out of her head.
“I’ll pay later.” Harry answered with a wink. Harry wasn’t sure if he was doing this whole flirting thing right, but his test dummy appeared to be decently flustered as he shot Harry another shy smile.
“Umm… I was on an Auror case. We were clearing out an old alleyway, where we found the timepiece. Malfoy- um, sorry – Draco, picked it up and then suddenly it started spinning really quickly, and heated up until it was red. Then Draco touched it and dropped the time turner.”
Ginny had suggested that they should go somewhere new, but Harry argued that he already knew this club and felt comfortable here (and that he didn’t want to go just because he knew that Draco did occasionally go to this club as well).
“What’s he called?” Harry was tempted to put his hand of Malfoy’s knee for comfort, or maybe give him a hug, but ice radiated from Malfoy as he covered himself up with his arms.
-	Don’t worry about it. That woman would have invented a way or another to get me in detention. In the hearing if she had what she wanted I would have been expelled without even having a chance to defend myself. What saved me was Ms. Figg and my memories of what happened, otherwise I would have been expelled. – Harry said with a twinge of anger in his speech. – I have to go now, but we can talk Sunday alright?
-	But I sent you a few letters in the beginning of the holidays, even though Dumbledore said you didn’t want to be bothered, I didn’t want to believe that, but I never got an answer so I stopped sending letters. And when I heard the Weasley’s talking about you having been expelled from Hogwarts I tried sending a letter again but you never responded, so I just gave up thinking that you really wanted to be left alone. – Sirius said dejected.
Harry hurried to get to the meeting point in time, which he did, but still had to wait half an hour for his aunt to get him. After getting him they headed towards the house where Dudley’s friend lived to get him. When they got there, Dudley argued with his mother because all his friends were staying for a sleep over so he had to stay to. After 5 minutes of his cousin whining, Petunia ended up agreeing and letting him know that she would be there at 11:30 to pick him up.  After apologizing to the other boy’s mother for Dudley’s behavior they continued their way home.
-	Professor Umbridge asked me to bring you this. – He said extending his hand with the note on it to professor Snape.
-	Mister Potter this behavior is unacceptable coming from a Slytherin student, but since Umbridge already took points from Slytherin and you have detention to serve with her and seeing that you are a Slytherin student for only for days, I will be lenient with you and not give you any extra detention. Keep in mind that this is the only time that I’m being kind, because the next time anything similar happens you will be serving detention with me instead and I can guarantee that it will be much worse than anything that women does to you, are we understood? – Snape said after reading the note, his face showed the displeasure he felt while talking.
Harry picked up the shard of mirror and looked at it. It looked like a normal piece of a broken mirror, he could see his reflection perfectly well. He said Sirius name out loud and waited for something. A few seconds later the surface of the mirror started getting foggy and when the fog disappeared harry could see his godfathers face. Harry smiled brightly and Sirius face wasn’t any different.
-	No, he isss not! Becaussse I am the prettiessst one between usss and all the other sssnakesss in these shop. -  responded the white ringed snake with what sounded like a crying voice.
Draco was the first one to notice the tears now streaming down Harry’s face and in a surprising attitude, that had everyone around them gasping, he passed his right arm over Harry’s shoulder pulling him closer and started petting his hair and asked in a low voice if he was alright. Harry unconsciously passed him the letter and whispered in response that finally someone cared enough. It took all of 10 seconds for Harry to realize what he had done. In a second, he ripped the letter from Draco’s hand and ran out of the Great Hall and headed to the common room to get his books. He started heading to the Gryffindor common room and then realized that he was heading the wrong way and turned back to the dungeons.
He thought he heard Harry distantly speaking but right now he just needed to think. Fred. Fred Weasley. Fred Weasley and Harry. Was he OK with that?
When he decided that it was, he slipped out of bed and made his way over to his en-suite bathroom. It was when he got into the shower that he was reminded of how much worse his ‘prison sentence’ could actually be. He hadn’t really missed the manor but he had forgotten how amazing his personal bathroom was compared to that pathetic thing in the safe house. He had a choice in here between a powerful and invigorating shower or a relaxing and indulgent jacuzzi corner bath. This morning he felt more like a shower so he opened the glass door and stepped in.
“Thanks… and Harry is fine.” That voice was so familiar to him, it hadn’t changed at all and it made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up.
“I know Kreacher quite well and he has always been polite to me Mr. Potter, thank you.” She replied stiffly.
“Yes, that one! I’m still just so sick of these stupid comments even seven years on, they still treat me like I just walked up to Voldemort and killed him effortlessly all by myself. I hate that, it’s just so far from the truth. Also, I got another letter from some random person wanting to do my official biography again this morning!” Harry said in an irritated fashion.
“Not directly although I’m assuming that is their goal.” Daphne started. “They apologised for your behaviour which resulted in the engagement coming to an end. They assured me that whatever the cause they’re sure you regret it and between us they think we could resolve the matter. It was full of flattery about how I’d make the perfect daughter-in-law and even consisted of bribery reminding me that you would get access to your main vault when you get married and they would ensure I would get my own vault matching yours. They invited me for dinner on Saturday evening at the Manor to discuss the matter.”
As Draco finally took off the cloak Harry couldn’t help but stare at him. He’d forgotten how good Draco looked today. Obviously when he saw him the other week at Daphne’s he’d noticed how handsome the man was of course, he was only human, but this Draco in front of him, wasn’t just handsome, he was bloody gorgeous. The casual look was a good one on him, he never thought he’d see Draco in muggle clothes like this but he liked what he saw. The tight jeans and the deep V of his T-shirt that almost matched Draco’s porcelain skin tone was taking his mind to all sorts of places, making him think things he definitely should not be thinking…
“Yes, you could be right. Although I have to warn you that pretty much all my stories have some sadness in them now.” He said, his tone a bit more serious.
“It does make a lot of sense, all of it.” Draco said thoughtfully. Then he looked straight into his eyes. “But I know you Harry. I’ve seen you grow up, mostly, and I’ve seen a lot of different sides to you, you’ve told me stuff, personal things and well I’m still here aren’t I?” He smiled softly.
“What are you scared of?” Fred mumbled into Harry’s chest hiding the tear that was rolling down his cheek.
It was hot already and the sun was reflecting off the water. His body was feeling cool but Harry could feel the skin on his face and shoulders getting hot. Then he noticed Draco looking at him.
“I’m really lucky to have her, I really don’t think I could trust anyone else to run the shop floor like that when I can’t do it myself. It’s hard for me to give up control like that but I just don’t think my business will be successful if people associate it with the Malfoy name. I can’t even afford to pay her much. she's way too good to me. I’ll have to make it up to her when I can.” Draco said seriously.
Draco personally thought it looked delicious, true Hopsy would have plated it better but he knew it would taste good. Harry didn’t reply to the backhanded compliment and just started eating. He suddenly looked a bit tired and deflated again even though he had perked up after their talk this morning. He wanted to tell him that Mother was just playing a game and he needed to play back but he didn’t know how to communicate that to him here. Well the least he could do was stick up for him.
“Yes, sometimes.” Draco surprised himself by admitting that. He kept telling himself that he didn’t miss them, that he didn’t miss anything or anyone from his old life… but was that the truth?
Draco chuckled lightly again because finding humour in this situation was easier. “Yes I look forward to that conversation when you can’t even say what you mean out loud. You never talk abut sex without blushing.”
Harry’s stomach lurched a bit, he didn’t think Draco would have mentioned him. When he didn’t reply Hermione addressed him.
Draco panicked slightly. He was thinking that Harry would invite him over, he couldn’t possibly let Harry see his abysmal flat.
“Relax Draco it’s fine.” Daphne said. “Harry deliberately told us to apparate to this point round the back and make sure nobody was here before you came in case the cloak did that.”
Harry nodded. “Apology letters he said. One for you and one for Ron. I didn’t know he was doing that and I didn’t ask him to. I have no idea what they say but yeah, maybe you should read it first and then we can talk more.”
His wand was visible down the centre pocket and could be drawn with his right hand at a moment's notice. Hopefully the fact that he had his sleeve rolled up slightly would put any suspicions of the dark mark he wore out of someone’s mind as they would probably expect someone hiding it to have their sleeves firmly held right down to the start of their hand. It was a bit of a risky double bluff but the wand holster was charmed securely on and would not budge. It was 100% waterproof too so he wore it all the time even in the shower so he never had to look at the mark either. He’d had it commissioned in Paris a couple of months after he’d arrived and worn it ever since so now it was just part of his arm.
Lissey vanished again and Draco looked down at the plates for the first time. The little pastry did indeed look delicious and was topped with a lovely little rocket salad. He frowned though as he looked around and saw that his was slightly bigger than everyone else's. Draco raised his eyebrows at Daphne.
Ron looked surprised and somewhat impressed by this news but he took it on the chin and carried on. He waved his wand at a smaller screen on the left and brought up Draco’s file then turned to his secretary who was also in the meeting taking notes as always. “Marge get someone to check that please and update the records.”
Harry laughed slightly and immediately felt better. Somehow it was comforting to him to realise that Draco was just as nervous as he was about everything. He closed the gap and tucked himself into Draco’s stance, their bodies fitting together perfectly.
“My mother.” Draco replied simply and Harry seemed surprised by this. “You thought my parents didn’t know?” Draco asked, chuckling slightly at Harry’s reaction.
He was trying to find some sort of witty remark or joke in his head but they’d all vanished. “Bloody Malfoy charm.” He muttered under his breath but just loud enough that Draco probably heard. He picked up the stupid love heart swimming trunks and wandered into the bathroom area to put them on and brush his teeth.
“Of course, Mr. Potter, your word carries more merit than most here. We shall trust what you have to say so please share your evidence with us.” The Minister spoke addressing the ‘Golden Boy’ as that was the part Potter seemed eager to play today.
Harry shook his head and snorted looking down at the sofa but then raised his head to look more seriously at Draco silently urging him to speak his mind openly, which he did.
After a month of slowly becoming friends, one long night breaks that final friendship barrier and brings Harry and Draco closer together.
There was a part of Harry that wanted to tell his two oldest friends how happy he really was. How there was someone who kept making him smile every time he thought about them. That the person in question was waiting for him when he got home and that Harry thought he might just kiss him the moment he walked in the door because it was all he could think about. Harry had never had someone waiting for him at home who he could just walk in and kiss. True, he’d had Fred at the flat but that wasn’t the same. This was different in the best way possible.
He watched the kiss between Arwen and Aragon and thought about what he’d promised himself and Blaise last night. When would be the time to try and kiss Harry… was he brave enough?
“See you soon.” Draco said and then pulled his head out of the fire just as Harry got up to walk away.
Draco called out to Blaise that ‘Dray’ wasn’t acceptable either and what was wrong with calling people by their full names just as he walked out the door. Then Daphne and Draco stood there ever so slightly awkwardly for a moment which was very unusual for them. After a short moment though she reached out and placed a tentative hand on his arm just lightly.
“Well no one is forcing you.” Harry said jokingly, lifting his hands up in the air so that he was no longer touching Draco.
This wasn’t the moment to press the matter further though. After some more general chit chat he made his excuses to leave. After all he had a hot man to get back to, he thought happily to himself.
“I-” Draco bagen shakily. “I haven’t taken it off since the day I put it on six years ago. It’s an expensive one, self cleaning, waterproof, durable… I intended to leave it on forever.”
Draco snorted. “Why doesn’t that surprise me? You can wordlessly, wandlessly cut your best friend down from a lamppost in the blink of an eye in the middle of a duel with a Death Eater but you can’t do a simple cleaning spell? Here, let me, I’m excellent at them.” He boasted as he drew his wand from it’s holster and waved it over them both.
He got up and wandered to the back door, pausing like he always did to try and identify who was outside. Except hard magic like this didn’t work when he was tired, everything seemed fuzzy to him this morning, he felt weak, vulnerable, he didn’t like it and he didn’t want to open the door to someone who he didn’t feel safe with.
Harry didn’t respond for a moment, still looking at Draco hungrily. Then he replied “you if I had my way.”
“Yeah” Ron said slowly and nodded, letting Harry’s words sink in and willing himself to believe them.
“I’m glad things aren’t awkward between us, your friendship means so much to me you know.” Harry said sincerely.
He was sitting on the floor with his arms behind supporting him and his legs stretched out in front looking very relaxed. It was a little colder tonight so he was wearing his silk silver and black dressing gown too. He’d only been there about half an hour, enjoying the stars in the night sky when he saw Potter approach and sit down beside him, a little closer to him than last night. He was looking at him with a raised eyebrow in amusement.
“Well you’ve been a bit up and down... like the Friday before last when you came round after you got your eyesight fixed, well you looked really good and you seemed happy, possibly a bit excited and we thought maybe your new look might have been to impress someone… but then when you didn’t come here last week we were worried something might have happened, then on Friday you seemed really happy again, the happiest we’ve seen you in ages actually but you seemed quite distant and you kept checking your watch…” Hermione trailed off and Ron picked up the thought.
There was a caprese salad with a pesto dressing, a platter of cold Italian meats and cheeses, a basket of fresh focaccia bread and a large bowl of the most creamy looking mushroom risotto. There was even a generous helping of tiramisu for afters which made him smile, a ‘pick-me-up’ indeed. He was immediately reminded of his childhood summer holidays in Italy, some of his fondest memories were there. This was exactly what he needed. Just when he thought it couldn’t get any better a bottle of his favorite Tuscan white wine appeared with two glasses.
“Come back to bed.” Fred mumbled as he pulled Harry backwards. Fred was surprisingly strong and Harry allowed himself to fall back into bed.
Most of the day was the same as any other Tuesday. Draco’s meetings went well in the morning. The bespoke perfumes were really taking off and rapidly becoming his signature product which he was pleased about because not only did he like making them, he could also charge a lot for them even though they didn’t take much time to make. He’d lost a whole brewing day yesterday so his stock in the shop was running a little low but he was on top of his owl orders and his bespoke gifts so that was the main thing. Daphne just made a note on anything running low in the shop and Draco said he’d make his priority tomorrow as well as the new orders that had come in today.
“Thanks Kreacher, but I would like to try and be more independent too but perhaps you could just show me around the kitchen a bit and tell me where things are and what the breakfast options are. Would that be OK?” Draco asked kindly, trying to copy the way Harry spoke to his house elf.
Harry turned serious slightly. “But the physical touch thing… doesn’t seem to be an issue for you with me?”
“Really?” Draco scoffed. “You and Blaise would make a terrible couple and clearly they don’t realise that Blaise does not ‘date’. Although I’m sure under normal circumstances he would have persuaded you into bed by now.”
So yeah, I'm a massive foodie and I love coffee! Those of you reading my other story will know this!
He took another sip of wine whilst Daphne finished her fish course and was waiting for him to continue. “He does have a serious side too though. People underestimate him as he’s not clever in an academic sense but he is talented with what he does. He’s driven and very passionate about his business which he built up from scratch from a young age. He pretends he doesn’t care about stuff and brushes things off but he’s more caring and sensitive than he lets on. He’s been single for a while as people just don’t really understand him or his… family, and he laughs it off pretending to be a bit of a ladies man but deep down I know he just wants to find someone special and when he does he would do anything for her. He’s sweet really even though he would deny it. He does have money, he’s done well for himself but you wouldn’t really know it. He never buys himself flashy stuff and lives in a modest way but he’s always buying small gifts for people for no reason. He’s a real family man and dotes on his nieces and nephews.”
Daphne and Blaise both raised the glass to their lips but Draco and Harry both hesitated. Draco couldn’t tell what was going through Harry’s head with Blaise’s words, was it too much? Too coupley? He had been trying to casually slip it into the conversation all week that the plan for him to live with Blaise and Daphne was no longer happening but somehow it felt more momentous now they were in a relationship. It was like Draco officially asking to live with Harry long term, it felt like a big step even though they were already doing it and he half wondered if Harry would be OK with it.
Draco looked at him gratefully and nodded. “So the full sexual orientation discovery story?” He asked with a smile.
“It was,” Draco sighed. “But we can focus on your sixth year memories today, I might write some of mine one evening this week and see if we can include them alongside yours.”
“Well she is fit from what I saw in the paper but not sure if I want Dr- erm Malfoy’s seconds.” George covered his mistake quickly and Fred gave him a quick concerning look before looking away.
However, the fic is still not 100% finished (although it does have a plot sorted) so if you have any ideas of where to take it, feel free to comment, I might even include them. xx
“That’s not something I could ever decide for you Harry. You need to figure that out on your own. And I know you’ve heard this before and that you’re probably sick of it – because Merlin knows that I am – but people like me, your real friends and family will always be here to support you. Okay?”
That was another thing about Harry. He had a real problem with proximity. He was constantly dropping little, tiny touches across Draco’s body, like rubbing his shoulder or hooking his thumb through a belt loop or pocket. Draco was quite embarrassed at how much the little touches affected him at times. Merlin, he was such a pervert.
“A few hours I guess, she started having contractions early this morning” Ginny explained, Harry nodded along, pretending he knew anything about pregnancy.
“Honestly Harry, you’re more of a drama queen than Ron, sometimes.” Hermione joked, aiming her greasy spatula in Harry’s direction. Suddenly, the sound of quick feet stomping down the staircase echoed around the kitchen. “Speak of the devil.”
“Come on, I know you can do better than that.” Alex spurred on, letting his thumb loop into the belt hooks of Harry’s jeans.
