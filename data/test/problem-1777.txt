"What is this?"
"... a snap and I thought to myself, that can't be good. Gabrielle nearly threw up on Sam and-"
"I want Teddy to meet his family," Harry said when he was asked the question. "Isn't that a good reason?" The four of them were walking back to 12 Grimmauld Place, the children running ahead to jump in the slushy puddles while the adults hung back to speak.
Scorpius stirred when Draco gathered him up into a tight hug. Draco took a deep breath, the familiar smell of his son calming him considerably. He kissed Scorpius' forehead, then looked up to watch Harry boil water and measure out tea leaves. Steam rose hypnotically from the kettle. The old house creaked and settled in the dark. Spoons clinked against ceramic. A clock ticked somewhere upstairs.
"No denying it." Harry stretched his aching back. He was sore from head to toe from all that running and chasing. "Hermione was amazed. I think she was expecting the worst."
The young boy shrugged.
wondered out loud. Why would his father get so mad at Harry?
Molly made sure the bandages were done up properly because if there was anything she had learnt from keeping so many raucous children alive for this long, it was how to fix up broken bones. "How is the other party of the fall doing?" She made Harry tilt his head up so she could examine that cut on his cheek.
"Why didn't you tell me your teacher's name is Harry Potter?"
Theo guffawed. "Christmas Eve. Big difference."
"Oh, yes. I can practice my writing. Harry says that's very important."
"Potter."
Both Scorpius and Draco ogled Harry.
"Really?"
Draco smirked. "I've taught him well. A worthy heir."
Draco's words were deliberate, as though he had been formulating them in his mind since that morning. "That's all this can be." He needed Harry to understand this more than anything.
"You can't go back home."
Now intrigued, Draco shifted in his seat to face Harry. "What about you and Ginny?"
"Can I go explore now?"
"I like that. I'm really happy too. See?" Scorpius beamed at Draco. "I'm happy about many things." The Malfoys were in Scorpius' playroom, working on crafts for school. Scorpius picked up his colour pencil and continued his drawing. "I'm happy about my friends. I'm happy that I can fly again now that it's spring. I'm happy because I get to go on another vacation with Mum. And I'm happy when we play together. I don't think I have anything to be sad about at all."
Draco picked up the Snidget imitation from the mantle of the old stone fireplace in the great room of 12 Grimmauld Place. The intricate figurine looked rather out of place beside crooked frames of Harry's friends and family and the misshapen clay plate adorned with five-year-old Teddy's blue smudged handprint. "I cannot picture you buying something like this," he told Harry.
Harry didn't mention that he thought it was weird that Draco had dropped in without warning. He went back to slicing mushrooms. Out of the corner of his eye, he watched Draco move over to the banquet table to the old gramophone that was playing an old Muggle record. Harry liked having music play in the background when he was doing chores. It was something to hum along to and it filled the silence of the house.  "You can turn it off," he told Draco.
"Mhm," Scorpius mumbled. He knew his mother was lying but he also knew she meant well.
"Shut up." Theo didn't even spare a look Draco's way. "While I was there, I did safari tours in Tanzania. We chanced upon a family of elephants by a watering hole. Gorgeous animals. There was a calf who was rolling around in the mud, having a time. Reminded me of you, Scorp. Chubby little thing, it was. Wouldn't go more than a few steps away from his mother, but you could just tell he had an adventuring spirit about him, the way he was looking at us. Probably wondering who the devil we were."
"Huh?"
"It's not scary!" Annie exclaimed with her characteristic bright grin. "It's because you're
Draco didn't say a word. He opened the door, walked into his house, and locked up behind him before letting out a slow exhale and leaning his forehead against the cold wood, trying to calm his breath, pushing down the anger and frustration rising in the back of throat.
"I'm not excited," Scorpius lied. He grabbed his books that his teacher held out for him and then hurried to his seat so he could get excited in private.
"Do you know what your problem is?"
Harry could easily retort with 'why not'. Those words could slip out at the moment, when plainly confronted. But the more time he spent thinking about it, the more resolutely those words echoed in his mind. Why not? Why not fancy someone other than Ginny? Why not get his rocks off with someone else if he felt like it? She obviously didn't care who he was doing what with. It could be anyone at all. Anyone.
"Well, I... That is, shouldn't we ask Draco first?"
Draco glanced up to find Harry at the doorway, flushed from the winter wind, wiping his dripping nose with the back of his glove, squinting as his spectacles fogged up, damp hair sticking up on end, scarf askew around his neck.
Harry glanced at his watch as Scorpius stirred upon hearing the familiar name. A little less than ten minutes.
Harry cursed his Firebolt for failing him miserably against Draco's Yajirushi. All he could do was watch as Draco zoomed past him towards the flitting Snitch. Draco was just barely an inch away from the golden ball when it blinked out of view. "Damn," he swore as his fist closed around thin air. So close.
Harry waited for a beat, then asked, "Does it bother you that I'm here?"
"They were looking at your drawings. They really liked them. They said that whoever drew them had a great imagination."
"Draco Malfoy."
Whoever had captured the blurry picture on the cover of Witch Weekly had managed to get it just right. Teddy's shirt was all askew and muddy, and his shoelaces were undone and trailing in the grass. Scorpius was flushed from the heat, but he still looked pretty as a doll, munching on popcorn. Draco was in the middle of saying something to Teddy as he tossed an apple with a lazy flick of his wrist. Harry was in his own world, his head tilted up towards the sun, eyes shut.
"Really?"
"Harry Potter, are you truly heartbroken?" Ginny gasped. "How could I ever be so cruel?"
"Yeah." Scorpius' eyes went wide too. "That's it, Theo! They used to fight when they were boys, but they aren't boys anymore. I need my father to grow up now."
Harry opened his mouth to retort. But he didn't. Because he realized that Draco hadn't said anything offensive.
"No, thanks. I'm on a raw diet," Harry said as he reached for the bag of marshmallows. "Unroasted marshmallows and unmelted chocolate only."
Scorpius didn't answer.
Draco flicked Harry's ear hard.
"You should have woken me up." Draco ran his fingers through Scorpius' hair. "You can always wake me up."
Harry grimaced as he took his third potion from the nurse. He tried his puppy dog eyes with her to no avail. She merely shook her head in disapproval. "It's quite disgusting, you know?" he insisted.
Scorpius pouted and stalked away. He didn't fancy being called ugly. Blame it on some Malfoy pride, if you will. Besides, after all he had seen of Harry, he was willing to defend the man.
Harry pulled her hand away from his hair and pressed a soft kiss on it. "You are a
"I was wondering if… his mother would also be here."
how truly awful life's been for you since then. I couldn't care
He reached up to graze his fingers against Harry's chin. "If I say no, will you stay?"
On cue, the front door flung open with a loud bang.
"I know you do." Scorpius could count on Harry.
"I can't," Harry blurted out. He deposited the startling figure back into the box and shut the lid. "You can't just give it away."
Scorpius gave Harry a big nod. "I think it would be wonderful." If it was anything like the stories he read, a night at a magical ball would be a fascinating night.
"But maybe you'll get hungry when you see me eat. What would you like? A sandwich?"
"Worked on us."
"It's the biggest tree I've seen," Gabrielle gushed
"Lasagna sounds good."
"Me?!" Harry pretended to be offended, even though he had heard her comment on him being a 'lost cause' for many years now.
Draco shook his head to wake himself out of his reverie and looked up at Harry. "Is that all?"
So here they were, four days later, spending Saturday morning on the grounds of Malfoy Manor, learning to fly a Firebolt, much to Draco's chagrin.
"What did he say?" Theo asked, feeling a conspiracy coming along as soon as Draco caught up to them with long, angry strides. "Did he say something awful?"
"This morning..."
Draco had seen his fair share of frights in his life, but this…
Draco harrumphed and pulled the towel away from his son's wet hair. "What could you possibly want now, Scorpius?"
Draco nodded hesitantly.
"Family," Draco scoffed. "Just because Teddy and I share a bloodline doesn't make us family."
"Maybe."
Draco interjected with a tsk. "I'm serious."
Scorpius ignored him and kept stomping off. If he wanted to make sense of things, he would have to learn more about this strange person. His nanny would be the best person to ask. "You are
Harry didn't say.
Patricia smiled while slipping into her sandals and said, "I suppose we should enjoy him while he's like this. They do grow up before you know it."
"That's not what I-"
That's all Harry had to say to get a glimpse inside Draco's infamous wardrobe. His eyes were wide in awe at the rows of shirts, trousers, sweaters, robes, shelves full of shoes, scarves, jewelry, and it was all arranged with such precision and care that he didn't dare enter without permission. Draco pushed him into the room without fanfare, muttering, "It's not that bad."
"He doesn't look that brave to me."
Harry finally resorted to pulling Scorpius up onto his lap. "He'll be here in a bit, buddy. Why don't you go back to sleep?" He settled into the sofa while wrapping the blanket tight around the boy.
Draco rolled his eyes. Scorpius and Potter were always on the same side, and always pitted against him. Best not to engage at all.
"Everyone in your class will," Harry assured Scorpius. "Imagine how funny your class pictures are going to turn out by the end of the year with all of your missing teeth."
Harry shook his head at them, instead grabbing their hands. "
After the heated kiss, Draco broke away from Harry. He was not the least bit satisfied because he felt like he had just lost yet another argument. "You make my life very difficult."
"Braaaains," Scorpius droned.
When the two finally returned, Scorpius was glad to have the grass under his feet again. He snatched some berries from the basket of fruits they had brought with them, then ran off with a promise to bring back something cool for Harry from beyond the grove of trees. Harry waved at the sprinting boy, marveling at his energy, before sitting down to stretch his legs.
"Who?"
"Stop that."
He had to duck to dodge the balled-up paper projectile Draco aimed at this head.
"Because I haven't seen him in months," Theo said with great sadness. "I miss his chubby cheeks."
"I guess."
But Draco drew him back in with a gentle touch at the small of his back. Draco tasted gingerbread, smelt familiar soap, and felt a flutter in his stomach as he brushed his lips over Harry's. They hardly ever kissed this way, lingering in tender and nonchalant.
Draco cast a cursory glance at the state of his home. "This is what happens when Stori finds her Christmas spirit. It's absolutely garish."
"I'll be fine."
He stood up, just as measured, clipped footsteps sounded in the hallway, and the door opened wide.
"It's not like what?"
"It's hot enough to fry an egg out here," Draco complained, "you've put me in clothes that I would rather be caught dead in, and this is a weekend I wanted to spend in my home, preferably not nursing a sunburn. But you, Potter, seem hellbent on an excursion."
In a rush, chilly November turned to festive December. Scorpius spent his evenings cutting out snowflakes from scrap paper, practicing his carols for the performance, and helping Patricia with holiday bakes. Draco had to diligently wrap and hide presents that were owled almost daily to the manor, courtesy of Astoria. Harry became busy with the winter pageant and planning a packed Weasley party schedule.
Draco tsked, shook his head.
He tugged Harry near.
Scorpius hadn't thought of that. "Oh!" he exclaimed and he held up a finger. "Can he get his
Harry heaved out a loud exhale. "You are rather daft, Malfoy."
Then he realized that pushing his luck had yielded rather favourable results. Maybe he should keep pushing his luck.
"Now, now, Draco," Astoria tsked. "If you go around acting all sweet like that, hell might freeze over."
With that, Draco shut the door in Harry's face.
The figure froze as though sensing a presence.
Draco frowned at Harry.
Harry supposed he could. "But I should go," he decided. "You need your sleep." He stood up. "I'll see you tomorrow." He walked out of the library, wondering what had prompted him to be so brazen. He had woken up in Scorpius' bedroom at midnight, concerned when he thought that Draco hadn't come home. After a quick search of the manor, he had found Draco asleep in the library, over strewn papers and parchment. That's when he had felt a strange compulsion.
"I don't need you. Nanna will owl it." Scorpius loved feeling this superior and independent. It didn't happen often when he got into fights with his father.
"Cake, Dad?"
Harry Potter was a grown-up. Scorpius wondered if he would live alone when he was all grown up. Probably not. He wanted to get married to someone really nice and live with her. As long as he had one person with him, he was fine. "You don't even have
"I said something like that."
"What?" Harry asked with a smile.
Draco choked on his drink.
"I'll bring over some food tomorrow. You'll need your rest tonight, and I'd wager you'll be famished tomorrow. How does that sound?"
Harry waited. He knew Draco had heard him. He watched the faint pulse on Draco's neck, beating a gentle rhythm, and waited.
Harry said, "Then I'm not doing anything either."
"For me?" he gasped.
"It's the tallest mountain in Africa," Harry said. "Theo climbed it."
"I wouldn't call myself an investor for that," Harry said modestly. "I wanted to help some friends and they needed capital to get started."
"I don't know, Potter."
"No, I'm fine, I'm fine. Please, sit down."
He struggled up off the couch in a flash, letting out a gasp when his ribs protested. His vision started to fade and a wave of nausea crashed into him. He crumpled back into the seat while clutching his head. He had to remember. What had happened to him? How did he get here? He paused. Where was ‘here’? Frantically he swept his eye around the empty room where he blearily saw antique furniture and a dying fire in the ornate fireplace. Above the fireplace was an old portrait of two regal aristocrats dressed in ball gowns. They were blinking disdainfully down at him, painted lips pursed tight. Deep maroon velvet drapes hung down to the floor from windows lining one wall. A discolored rug lay under his feet, spanning the expanse of the large room. A cobwebbed chandelier hung above him, unlit. And a flicker of motion at the corner of his eye made him glance at the doorway where Harry Potter stood, appearing slightly taken aback.
"Right? What are you going to do alone in this huge mansion when that happens?" Patricia waved goodbye and followed her ward out, resorting to jogging to catch up with him when he stamped his foot in annoyance at her tardiness.
"Sure, of course."
"I know." Scorpius folded the important letter back up and put it in his pocket, like he had seen his father do many times. "And Teddy said I need to write to him more."
"What's he like?"
"I just know. It's why you're always hiding it." Scorpius stared at the Dark Mark for a long while. Then he asked, "Are you a bad person?"
"Harry... Don't-"
"Hey, Harry," she grinned.
Scorpius had a plain this-must-be-your-fault look on his face. "I think he's still angry with you."
It mattered.
Draco muffled his frustrated growl under the blankets.
"Does Harry come over with you?" he asked.
"I'll be right back," Draco sighed. Astoria appeared troubled as she nodded. Draco weaved past the small crowd to get to the door.
"I can't seem to help myself around you."
"I did." Scorpius looked down at his shoes. "I've been making my own lunches. Nanna got bread and strawberry jam from the grocers. I know you like sandwiches, so I thought you might like this one."
one around here looking out for you! And this is the thanks I get?" He threw his arms up in the air, turned his nose up at Harry, and stomped out of sight.
"Right." Harry had arrived at the manor in the evening to find the Malfoys in the same position he had left them - groggy in bed. And then Draco had forced himself awake and walked like a zombie to the study, mumbling about getting work done before the upcoming deadline in three days. Harry watched Draco write diligently. So serious. "I can hang out with Scorpius tomorrow if you want to go in. It's Saturday," he offered.
"Something like that."
"It's exploding, isn't it?" Teddy laughed behind closed lips so his candy wouldn't fly out of it. He held out the bag of candy to Scorpius.
He frowned, clearly offended by Gabrielle's mocking tone. "I'm not." He picked up the sandwich and bit into the jammy spread. Scorpius was rather liberal with the strawberry, jam sliding down the other end of the bread and plopping down on the table. "I don't know what I'm supposed to do," he said between chews. "It was a lot simpler until last week. Now I'm wondering if maybe..." He didn't finish his thought, opting to take another bite of the peace offering instead.
Molly smiled at the young Malfoy. To her, Harry was like a son. And when she had a bad feeling about things, she was usually right. She always had a bad feeling when it came to the Malfoys. However, she swallowed her lecture. She had already been on Harry's case since that dreadful tabloid piece. There wasn't anything left to say. "Will you be going home?"
"Nothing," Draco answered a little too quickly while turning on his heel.
"For God's sake-" Harry grabbed the first thing he could get his hands on, which was a box of jellybeans, and threw it at them, sweets exploding everywhere when the box hit the doorjamb instead of its intended targets. They sputtered indignantly as they were pelted with little sugary projectiles.
Draco tsked and pulled Scorpius on top of him. Scorpius ducked his head when Draco brushed his blonde hair away from his forehead. The ache in Draco's chest that had started the night before was starting to return as he tried to memorize his son's slight frown and pursed lips. How time flew. "I love you," he said. "Do you know that?"
Teddy.
Harry could hear his friends' hushed conversation as he walked away from the drawing room with Teddy in tow. "You shouldn't go through people's mail." He stalked into his cramped study. "It's an invasion of privacy and you could find yourself in hot water." He tossed the letters on the already messy desk. "I hope you don't go around opening your friends' letters at Hogwarts." He frowned in reproach at Teddy, who stood at the doorway chewing on his thumb. "You're such a bother these days."
Scorpius pulled a face behind Draco's back.
have a pet, what would you like?"
"I'm bringing Scorpius and Teddy over next week," he said over the loud arguments in an attempt to shush them. "And you know how Teddy gets when you say no to him."
"Of course." She gave him a fleeting kiss, then stepped back with a wink. "What are you fantasizing about these days, darling?" she wondered.
said that he wanted to meet his cousin. His father had somehow jumped to that conclusion.
Harry had known this was going to happen. It always played out this way when he got hurt. Someone
"Hey, Dad?"
"He was a Death Eater," Teddy said simply.
"Don't fret."
Harry was surprised by Scorpius' initiative, although he didn't express it in any way other than by widening his smile. "Teddy's coming into town tomorrow, so I've got to get his room all set up," he said. "I'm sure he will keep me busy, like he always does." As he said that, he thought of something. "Hey, Scorpius?"
"-because you've played easy-going-"
Harry nearly laughed at the question but he caught himself in time, disguising his chuckle by clearing his throat instead. "Well, I'm not supposed to have favourites, Scorpius," he said dutifully.
"That doesn't mean I need to stay here."
"Hey, Dad?" Scorpius sidled up beside Draco, who was preparing dinner. "Do you think, before bed, we can practice songs for the winter pageant?"
Harry was undeterred. He didn't move away, and he didn't move any closer. He stood where he was, his piercing gaze trained on Draco. "Hmm."
Just until Harry had widened his eyes in shock, snapping Draco back to his senses.
"What?"
"Isn't it?" She sighed in contentment. "And you've been stirring up trouble, Harry?"
"Sounds good. I'll see you after school tomorrow."
"He sure does. He says if I don't finish my vegetables, I'll get warts on my face and I'll turn into a goblin. That's so silly. But he tells me it's true."
Harry grabbed the hood of Scorpius' winter coat to stop him his tracks. "Come on!" He tugged Scorpius back towards him. "Tell me." He crouched down so they were eye-to-eye. "Is it a secret?" he hummed. "I can keep a secret."
"We should get going," Draco quickly intervened, grabbing Theo's arm hard.
Teddy waited until Scorpius had to stop for air. He got up from his seat, placed both his hands on Scorpius' shoulders, and turned around to push Scorpius down onto the chair. He knelt in front of the young boy. "I'm sorry, Scorpius." He wiped Scorpius' tears away. "I didn't realize how much Harry meant to both of you. Or how much both of you mean to Harry. We've been talking a lot the past couple of days, since you sent that letter. He let me read it. He thinks it is the most lovely letter and painting anyone has ever sent him, ever. Mind you, he gets a lot of letters. He is very popular, you know? A lot of people love him. Out of
"You've been happy lately."
"That's right. And we did a good job for the most part, didn't we?"
"Ah, the tables have turned," Draco smirked. He slid off the couch and brushed Scorpius' cheek with his thumb. "Sleep with Mum tonight. Goodnight," he whispered.
"Then I suppose you'll just have to do without."
When Scorpius isn't around anymore, nothing would change.
"Touche."
Scorpius immediately tried to look sullen, which was comical to see because his big smile dropped in an instant and his shoulders sagged theatrically.
Harry swallowed the rest of his argument. Happy? He sort of was, actually. "Yes," he answered and folded his arms against his chest. "As a matter of fact-"
"That's what
He didn't want to wake up before Teddy. They had been telling silly stories all night long. Or rather, Teddy was telling silly stories about Hogwarts while Scorpius listened eagerly. They had fallen asleep that way. Scorpius had never slept in a tent before, so it was a lot of fun. It wasn't a
The barn owl swooped down onto the bed and pecked at the mop of red hair that peeked from under the covers. Ginny Weasley flapped her sleepy arms about to no avail. She could tell Teddy's owl from all the others because it was always dead set on annoying her every time she tried to sleep. She rolled over with a whine and blindly felt above her head for the bird's neck so she could wring it just a bit before letting it go. The owl evaded her hand quite easily. "Give me my letter," she groaned. "That's all I ever want from you. Why won't you leave me alone?" The owl hopped over to perch on her chest and she undid the scroll that was tied to its leg. Then she shooed it away grumpily.
Draco couldn't pick out a single word of what Harry was saying. He could see Harry's lips moving, his left arm supplementing the story with descriptive gestures. Scorpius was listening intently, his mouth hanging open in astonishment. A familiar dread twisted Draco's stomach into knots. It made him weak. He managed to walk up to the foot of the hospital bed and sit down before his knees gave way. He gripped the edge of the mattress as he pretended that he was fine. That he hadn't spent the last three months fighting to keep it together. That he hadn't missed hearing Harry's voice.
"Inside," Harry murmured instead of handing Scorpius over. He turned away from Draco and walked down to the kitchen, trusting Draco to follow him in. Draco was too confused and tired to argue. He closed the door behind him, dragging his feet as he made his way through the dark house. He entered the kitchen just as Harry swished some dim lights on with his wand. Harry motioned for him to sit at the long banquet table. Once Draco had dropped into a chair, Harry handed Scorpius to him. "I'll make some tea."
"It's just a little cut."
"There's nothing to see, Ron." Harry's right arm was in a sling and tied close to his chest so the bone would remain in place while it set. Other than that and a small scrape on his cheek, he looked fit as a slightly banged up fiddle.
Scorpius' thumping footsteps echoed down the stairs, and his muffled voice calling out, "Dad? Harry?"
Completely befuddled, Harry exclaimed, "What are
"I don't believe you."
Gabrielle gestured at the sandwich. "So, what's this for?"
Astoria scowled at Draco. "Shut up." She limped her way to the sink to toss in a dirty spoon. "Turns out I'm not so young anymore." She arched her back and moaned in pain. "Talk me out of those ridiculous soirees next time."
Once the children were occupied by the goodies in her bag, it was the adults' turn to squeeze the breath out of her. Her brothers were the roughest, of course, ruffling her hair and thumping her back. She was utterly disheveled when she got to Harry.
"I can't very well ask the nurse for ice-cream, can I?"
In contrast, Harry seemed to have it worse. The tabloids had been flush with opinions pieces, near-voyeuristic pictures, and confused uproar.
A minute later, when Scorpius strolled out of his playroom and ran into Harry and Draco in the corridor, he had to do a double take. "Gosh, Harry," he gushed. "You look handsome!"
When he walked into the living room, he found the curtains had been drawn and Potter was standing in front of the fireplace, pretending to read a book. He also spotted his wand on the table beside the couch he had been laid up on. Relieved, he strode to it and slid it into his pocket. Then he hazarded a glance at Potter who quickly averted his eyes down to the brown pages in his hands. The stuffy silence was difficult to sustain. So, Draco cleared his throat. "I-"
"Yes."
"Sore subject." Harry didn't like talking about his childhood. "It makes him special though. He appreciates the little things in life. I've noticed."
Scorpius laughed at Teddy's glum expression. "Okay. No one said anything at all. Besides, we-"
from this fantastic magical pub because everything smelled so good. He was used to eating food Patricia made. All of this seemed most exciting. There were many different people inside and outside. They reminded him of busy bees, flitting about in a hurry.
"Okay." Scorpius didn't know what else to say. "Bye." He turned and ran off to join his friends in the mess.
Harry knew that meant 'no'.
Harry jerked awake. "Huh?" He blearily swatted at his ear before flipping over onto his side so he could glare at Draco. "What?"
Ginny pouted. "Why didn't anyone tell me?" She narrowed her eyes at him. "Or does no one know?"
"If he asked, what would you say?"
like his Scorpius.
As far as anyone was concerned, yes, Harry was a rather good friend. That's all this was. With Scorpius gone for three days, at least Draco didn't have to come up with more excuses for being away from the manor. A small reprieve. It was getting difficult to keep track of the lies. Not just the lies they told others, but the ones they told each other.
"Who's Harry?"
Scorpius hid his face against Draco's shoulder again.
Draco wrenched his arm out of Harry’s grip, anger bubbling up in him. Savior Potter looking to fix things, as always.
"No way."
"What I want, she doesn't. What she wants, I don't," Draco said. "Especially when it comes to Scorpius. We're both stubborn. Spoilt in our own way." Both he and Astoria came from very affluent wizarding families, and were used to getting their way. When things didn't go their way, they both reacted with anger and resentment. "Similar upbringings, so we know what to say to make it hurt. Yes, she's perfect. She thinks I'm perfect. When we're together for long enough, we became far from perfect."
"Think of the children."
Harry tsked. "For what it's worth, I think this is completely bogus."
"I'm sorry." Harry couldn't stop his voice from quivering. "I am. I wish I hadn't- And now I-" He broke off as his words cracked in his scratchy throat.
"I want ice-cream.
Harry simply nodded and said, "Scorpius is family, after all."
Draco tried to relax the fists he was making as he watched his son precariously perched on the broom with Potter walking beside him, leading him in a slow floating flight. He was imagining all the worst case scenarios, from a broken arm to a cracked skull. He was sitting under a large oak tree, trying to read his book while also not interfering. Harry and Scorpius had been at these flying lessons for the better part of an hour already. Draco was at his wit's end. He couldn't believe he had thought a broomstick was an appropriate present for a six-year-old boy. The kid had barely learned to run properly a year ago. He let out a sigh and tried to focus on the words on the page, realizing that he had read through three pages without really reading at all.
"Let me do this too?"
"No," Scorpius muttered. "I'll go with Nanna tomorrow." He got up from his chair and sidestepped Draco so he could walk out of the room, leaving his father feeling quite guilty.
"That he's really nice," a girl chimed in. Harry looked down while blushing modestly. Just in time too because the children now turned their attention to their teacher, admiring him from afar. "My brother said that I'm so lucky that I get to be in Harry's class. He said that when Harry was still a little boy, he was called the Chosen One. He fought a lot of monsters. He knows a lot of spells. And he-"
Teddy gasped. "How dare you?" He wiped his thumb on his pants and pointed an accusatory finger at Harry. "
He tried to think of the last time he had gone out to a restaurant. Likely with Astoria a few years ago? He had certainly
There was complete silence after for a few moments.
"Just tell me already." Harry was perplexed as he squinted at Draco's back. He tried to remember the night before. He remembered dinner, talking Malfoy's ear off about the kids, more than a few glasses of wine, some laughs, the cellar, then blank.
"Oh!" Scorpius squeaked.
Time spent at the Malfoy Manor was not much of a secret to close friends in Harry's life. He didn't outright say that he wasn't able to join in on impromptu drinks because he had already promised an evening to the Malfoys, but he didn't try to hide the fact that he was teaching Scorpius how to fly or that he was occasionally invited to stay for dinner. It wasn't a topic that his friends broached. Harry returned the favour by not speaking of it either. Out of sight, out of mind. However, not a soul knew about time spent at 12 Grimmauld Place. Not a soul but Harry and Draco. As far as they were concerned, no one needed to know.
He quickly dropped his arm to his side. "Ah. Uh."
"I'll return him without a scratch," Harry promised.
bothering
Scorpius had barely sat down on the bench in the dressing room to get the weight off of his jelly legs when his mother and father walked in, evidently having shirked the rest of the school's performance. Thankfully they weren't the only parents who had slipped out, that would have been very embarrassing for Scorpius. Well, he was embarrassed, nonetheless. But he would have been
The two of them were in the manor, in the great room, sitting across from each other in armchairs. It was too hot for a fire, so they sipped on scotch instead as the sun set. Theo had always found it difficult to read Draco, and he found it especially so that evening. "Are you alright, Draco?" he finally asked.
Draco was running.
A while later, with empty plates and full bellies, Theo suggested a nightcap with cheesecake. "The good stuff," he told Draco as he began clearing the table.
"One final graham cracker." Teddy sandwiched the chocolate and marshmallow with a firm press. The marshmallow squished out, oozing over the edge of the cracker. "Down the hatch." He took a huge bite.
Draco had missed two days of work already. He couldn't afford to get even further behind on tedious paperwork. He was much more productive working in his office than at home. Patricia was still away visiting her mother. If Harry was offering so graciously...
"Well, people can't get married unless they find the right person," Patricia said wisely.
"Mum and Dad weren't right," Scorpius figured with a sad shake of his head. "That's not good. I hope he marries someone right. Don't you?"
"I miss you more than anything."
Before long, they were in the nurse's office and he couldn't have stopped crying even if he wanted to. It was even sadder to see because when Scorpius cried, he kept his voice inside, screwed his eyes shut, and pursed his lips closed so not one sound escaped him. He ended up shaking and trembling with each stifled breath.
"He broke his neck?" Scorpius echoed in alarm.
His nanny wasn't far behind. Patricia appeared at the doorway, looking a bit embarrassed. "He thought you broke your neck," she said with an apologetic smile.
"I didn't think you wanted me to," Draco answered without skipping a beat.
"Maybe you could come over for a visit?"
"Better than me, so I can't judge," Harry answered. He hopped up on the counter beside Scorpius and helped himself to a chunk of edible play dough, rolling it between his hands to make a ball. "What do you do with Draco on your days off? Besides nothing, that is."
"Some people are like that," Draco explained. "Some people are nice and they smile at everyone. I know it makes you feel special. But he is just your teacher. Teachers have to be nice to their students. That's all."
She picked up the longer letter.
"Yes, I think I had better let them know. I will be right back, Scorpius." Harry moved towards the outside office where the receptionist helped him with Scorpius' emergency contact.
"And then, with a flick of her wand, Ophelia transformed the floor into the smoothest ice," Astoria gushed. Draco set the food on the table that was already sticky with spilled syrup, dusted in powdered sugar, and messy with smushed fruits. Astoria took her seat at the head of the table, Harry sat opposite the boys, and Draco remained standing behind Scorpius while still sipping on his coffee. "The waiters wore skates. They skated around to each table to serve us the grandest wine."
Harry was tempted to ask how long it was going to take, but he held his tongue instead of antagonizing Malfoy any further. He glanced at his watch as the call ended. He still had some time before it was time to put his tired students to bed. He was sure Gabrielle could manage. He took a breath to calm himself, purposefully ignoring the pointed look the secretary was giving him. Draco Malfoy. Still a git. After composing himself, he walked back into the nurse's office.
Draco responded with a flat, "No," while Harry stammered, "This isn't- I mean, we're not-"
Harry knelt down next to Scorpius Malfoy and watched the boy blink rapidly with his chin tucked to his chest.
"Hmm." Harry looked away and closed his eyes again.
Harry glanced to the side where Draco stood, watching. "I'll be right back."
can marry him, Nanna," he decided. "You're nice, just like him."
ugly to you?"
Scorpius burst out laughing. "Oh, Harry."
"It's an art project by the students. Scorpius was supposed to bring it home, but I think he isn't too happy with them, so he keeps leaving them behind," Harry explained. "I was hoping to give them to you in person in school, and I haven't seen you since... well... Anyway, um, I think that's supposed to be you and him on a Quidditch pitch. The other one is a starry night he drew for his mother."
Draco and Theo Nott were sitting at a table in a small café by Theo's office, as they always did once every few months, catching up on things. Theo spent much of his life traveling for work and pleasure, so whenever he was back in town, he made a point to reach out to Draco. Theo was one of the few people from Hogwarts that Draco could stand. Theo was also one of a handful of people from Hogwarts who would give Draco the time of day. He had helped Draco when it came to rehabilitation in the adult world, after all the court dates and probation he had to deal with. Draco owed a lot to his friend. And his friend knew it.
Draco was trailing behind. He would rather be at home, cool and dry. Instead he was trudging up a bloody mountain because Potter was adamant that he join the boys. His hair stuck to the back of his neck and he was wearing the most Muggle clothes in existence. He looked down at himself and cringed. Harry had picked it out for him and would not hear a no for an answer. Honestly, whoever thought of this indecent rubbish for grown men? Khaki pants and a grey short-sleeved linen shirt that showed, rather prominently, the Dark Mark that he strove to hide every day of his life.
Draco supposed so. Scorpius' fascination with his new teacher. Scorpius insisting on seeing his cousin. Scorpius asking Harry over for dinner. Scorpius wanting someone to teach him to fly. Halloweens, birthdays, adventures, all for Scorpius. He nodded.
"What should we do now?" Harry asked, wiggling his brows up and down.
Harry stepped away from the kiss with a quiet laugh and a baffled shake of his head. Teddy had clapped his hands over his eyes, dramatically crying, "I've gone bliiiind." Scorpius was gawking at the two men, blushing pink all over.
Draco blinked once, then nodded.
"You may want to call his parents, Harry," the nurse advised. "Just to let them know? Nothing is the matter. The swelling will go down in a few hours. He just needs to rest with his foot elevated."
"Why?"
He squinted at the sound and muttered, "Not very good." At the open doorway stood Draco with a mug of steaming coffee in hand. Harry dropped his head in his hands. "Ugh." He took a few cleansing gulps before grabbing his spectacles from the bedside table. "What time is it?"
"Oh, you don't know the half of it," Teddy crowed. "Harry's been on the most adventures out of any other person in the entire world ever. He's won every Quidditch game he has ever played. He won the Triwizard Tournament. He's swam with the merpeople and met the centaurs, you know? Harry and Ron and Hermione even know a giant. I've met him. His name's Hagrid. He works at Hogwarts. You'll meet him in a few years. He's really nice. And they've all learned a lot of curses; some of them are really
"I want to go! I want to see elephants!" Scorpius gave Draco an angelic and pleading look. "Can we go, Dad? Please?"
"He's better now," Scorpius added when he saw the aghast expression on his father's face. He clutched Harry's hand. "Don't worry. The Healers made him all better."
"Yes."
Harry wiped Scorpius' tears away. "You're the smartest."
"I'm trying out for the Hufflepuff Quidditch team," Teddy announced to the table. "I want to either be a Chaser or a Seeker."
in here?" Scorpius stammered.
"I don't need money to get you a present."
"No." Scorpius jumped off the countertop and scurried to the front door. He opened it a crack before Draco could stop him.
"But won't there be blood in my mouth? Alex lost his tooth in class. It was messy. He was crying. He said it hurt a lot and tasted awful."
"I'll stay with you," Scorpius whispered.
"I just thought... Well, you just... seemed like someone who would think the opposite."
Scorpius sidled up to Draco and glanced at him out of the corner of his eye. "I thought he broke his neck too," he whispered. "But he didn't."
Harry trailed off. He studied Draco for a second, then asked, "Because that's your job?"
Astoria stepped in front of Draco, stopping him in his tracks, and rested her arms on his shoulders. When he pulled a face at her, she responded with a laugh. “Do it for the fantasy."
Scorpius' glower intensified. "I'm asking Teddy. Not you," he muttered. He tucked his head down and obstinately kept writing.
Harry was in the middle of a dusty endeavor up in the attic at 12 Grimmauld Place when the doorbell chimed. Andromeda had tasked him with finding some old albums and books her grandmother had stowed away for safekeeping. Harry was tempted to ignore the door since he was elbows deep in some boxes, but the ringing didn't stop. He was still brushing cobwebs off his hair when he finally got downstairs. He was not expecting to find Draco standing at the stoop when he opened the door.
tent, of course. Teddy had made a tent in Scorpius' playroom out of blankets, chairs, and pillows. Teddy had also set his wand above their heads to make a soft light that wasn't too bright. The tent was plush and it was the most fun sleep Scorpius had ever had. He would wake up at night when Teddy elbowed or kicked him. But that was okay. Sometimes he awoke because Teddy was pulling him into a tight hug while muttering nonsense. He didn't mind that either. This was the first time someone had slept over in his room.
to be mean and you just won't let me." His hands were clenched into fists and he stood as close to Harry as he possibly could. "It's not fair. You shouldn't be nice to me. You shouldn't."
"Of course, I do." Draco clasped Scorpius' hands tight. "You are the best thing that ever happened to me. I will always love you more than anyone in the world."
"Harry
"Yes!" a chorus answered. Scorpius couldn't even open his mouth, that's how dry his tongue had gotten.
"You aren't supposed to play with your food," Scorpius hummed, his lips quirking up into a sly smile. He chomped on the flower and chewed it happily. "Yummy."
Scorpius gulped hard when hi classmates started standing up. He struggled to his feet and pressed his hands to his sides. His eyes flicked from Gabrielle to his parents frantically. This was such a bad idea.
Harry said, "Because sometimes it seems you can't stand being around me."
As Draco made his way downstairs, he made out commotion coming from the foyer, where the boys had cleared a path to show off their cartwheel and round-offs to each other. At that moment, Teddy and Harry were racing each other from the dining room to the living room doing somersaults, Scorpius cheering them on with excited claps and hoots whenever Teddy veered into Harry's path. The Christmas decorations had been pushed out of the way to make room for their ruckus. Christmas music blared. Draco gingerly lowered his aching body down onto the marble steps to watch the chaos. How or
"Bye, Harry."
"How? I barely touched you."
"I'm thinking of waiting until I'm dead so that you can tell him all about my life," Draco grumbled.
Harry swallowed hard. "You should go. He's out there on his own."
"Right."
Scorpius eagerly opened his very first letter from Teddy and plopped down on the sofa to curl up and read it. It was hard to contain his anticipation.
Draco frowned at Scorpius. "Why? You seem perfectly fine eating a turkey."
nice to you, right?"
She hung her head in defeat and pinched the bridge of her nose. "Honey-" She broke off to sigh.
He set the bottle down, then sat back into the couch again, looking at Draco without pretense. "Yes."
Now that it was morning, he had woken up before Teddy. So he had been pretending to sleep for nearly an hour. Then Teddy stirred angrily, as though he didn't want to wake up yet. He could barely flutter his eyes open. As soon as he saw Scorpius staring up at him adoringly, he smiled. "Good morning," he whispered, taking care not to overpower the little boy with his morning breath.
Harry didn't deny it. He had been lounging on the sofa, twiddling his thumbs, and staring at Draco for a while now. Draco sat in an armchair and was going through some letters. Scorpius was at the other end of the sofa, by Harry's feet, carefully colouring in a picture book he had on his lap. "Is this all you two do on Sundays?" Harry finally asked.
"Go home, Patty," Draco told Patricia. "It's so late already. I can fix dinner for us." He couldn't believe his son's audacity to make such a big fuss, dragging poor Patricia into the whole debacle. "I apologize for all this."
Draco squinted at Theo, suspicious as he often was around him. Theo was usually up to no good. "What? Why?"
Right?
Scorpius had been swinging for a few minutes before his father and his teacher walked out the front doors of the school. He nearly fell face-first onto the slushy gravel in his hurry to get off the swing. He caught himself in time though, and ran up to them. "Shall we?" Draco asked him. Scorpius nodded. He had a lot to ask his father. Draco glanced up at Harry again to say goodbye. Scorpius mimicked him and then the Malfoys were on their way home.
Draco didn't know what had come over him. He clenched his offending hand into a fist.
"Why not?" Scorpius asked. "It's okay, Dad. He likes to know if things are broken. Yesterday, Annie broke some crayons and Harry said-"
"Have you ever tried a chocolate spread?"
After the war, the wizarding population had been fragmented more than ever before. Dark Army sympathizers were run out of town. Most went into hiding. The few that couldn't escape in time perished in the hands of vigilante justice. It seemed Malfoy's time had run out. With no family or friends to turn to, he was well and truly alone in a world that no longer had a place for him.
"Then I'll be bored at home."
Draco didn't find any of this amusing and he turned away. Harry walked over to the full length mirror at the end of the closet to inspect his attire. He fixed his shirt while peeking in the reflection at Draco rummaging through a drawer angrily. Yes, he had been cheeky with that question. Eliciting any reaction out of Draco was a pleasure, but a scowl was especially sweet. There was some truth in the joke. What did Draco think of all this? That's what Harry wanted to know. Getting a straight answer about their relationship was like pulling teeth. Harry quickly looked away when Draco shut the drawer with a loud snap and stomped towards him, scowl still in place.
Harry snorted, "No," but paused and looked puzzled. "Wait. Again?"
They reached the top of the hill. Draco arched his brows when he saw the fanfare down on the field. The large fairground was teeming, white tents scattered around banners, people strolling through well-trodden paths on the green grass, smell of sugar and grease wafting, mixed with the sounds of twanging guitars and drums that streamed from the speakers beside a makeshift stage where a band played old Blues music.
"I never know with you." She paused for a moment, most likely thinking of what to do next. "Goodness, don't just stand there. You should be resting." She bustled over to Harry and forced him back into bed, despite Draco still sitting on it. Arthur cringed at his wife's bright idea.
Harry conceded. "Alright. I won't say anything." He let go of Draco with a light push.
"Probably."
Harry clenched his jaw. "No, I don't."
Draco nodded as he watched his son run down the gravel road, backpack swinging wildly as it often did. "I don't think I'm ready for that."
"Teddy?"
Hermione cleared her throat as she sat beside Ron on the couch. "Harry, something on your mind?"
Harry dropped his face in his hands.
"Would you like to go with me?" Harry asked.
He was sulking in his bedroom when Draco found him after some searching. He didn't even look up when he heard his father enter. He pretended to be busy rearranging his books. Draco sat down on the floor beside him and watched him pretend for a while longer. Scorpius kept up the act for a minute, but there was only so much he could do with books that were already neatly stacked up. So he sat back in his chair and looked down at his hands.
Sometimes Harry was rather sweet and naive. "I'm not your keeper." Draco noticed the look on Harry's face, the way he bristled. He enjoyed riling Potter up. "You can do whatever you want."
"Seems that way." She tossed the cucumber slices onto the plate before reaching for the salt. "Just a simple misunderstanding."
favourite, okay?" he said in any case. He rubbed his itchy nose and dried his eyes as he turned around. He gasped when he nearly ran right into his father's legs. "Oh," he squeaked. "I-I-um…"
"Me?" Draco exclaimed. "What about you?"
This Scorpius was
"Simple?!" Either take a truth serum or let them dig around in his brain, that was the simple choice he had. "This is preposterous! It's borderline criminal to strong arm me like this!"
Scorpius nodded quickly. "Okay." He turned around and ran out of the study without saying anything else.
"Is that what brought you two together?" Astoria wondered. "Scorpius?"
"Goodnight."
Scorpius started and quickly shook his head. "Merry Christmas," he said, then he attempted to scurry past his teacher.
"No."
Harry winked at him. "Who says I'm stopping myself? It's part of my wholesome breakfast, isn't it?" He leaned in and placed a hand beside his mouth, like it was a secret. "Don't tell anyone."
"And you've got Harry."
It wasn't long before Harry started to feel sorry for the kid. He examined the picture. It wasn't that bad. Scorpius had drawn a large, irregular sunflower surrounded by jagged clouds. He hadn't even started coloring it in yet. It seemed just penciling an outline had reduced him to tears.
"He'll be alright," Harry assured him. "Ted's great with kids. He has a lot of young cousins."
"They say you should be locked up in Azkaban."
And hesitated.
"You're a big boy," Scorpius chided lightly. "You're supposed to sleep in your own bed, remember?" That's what Draco always told him if he kicked up a fuss and wanted to sleep in the master bedroom.
"Nanna's been trying to teach me for ages," Scorpius said. "It's hopeless."
excited," Harry told Scorpius, ignoring Draco's feeble words without batting an eye. "He is in his second year at Hogwarts. That's pretty cool, huh?"
friend. Like Mum's your best friend, right?"
Hugo and Rose cackled at Teddy's theatrics while Ron and Hermione simply shook their heads. They were used to scenes like this whenever Harry and Teddy were around.
Scorpius was a puzzling piece in Draco's world. Often he would slip out of his leisure reading, thinking about his son. He spent time watching Scorpius colour his next masterpiece, wondering where the years had flown. He would be playing Scorpius' newest imaginative game, and a nagging anxiety would tug at him deep down. For seven years, his world had revolved around this precious boy. When he wasn't at work, he had been with Scorpius. And when he couldn't be with Scorpius, he had searched hard to find an au pair who satisfied both his and Astoria's criteria, settling on Patricia who had been with the family for most of Scorpius' life. All he did, he did for his son.
Draco shrugged. "No skin off my back. I was just wondering." There were a few things he was wondering about. "The Weasleys?"
happy. Mine's doing it too! I'm not scared, though."
"Then you don't love Harry anymore?"
"Patty makes a good lasagna."
"Don't you find it interesting?"
Furious, Draco grabbed Harry's wrist and jerked him forward with a snarl. "What more do you want from me?!"
Teddy whipped his head to the side, his eyes crackling icy blue. He couldn't make out the owner of the voice but everyone in the vicinity of the culprit shifted anxiously, not liking the look on his face. "What does it matter what he's like?"
"Sure."
"No one knows because there's nothing to tell." Harry should have known there was no hiding anything from Ginny. She had always been quite perceptive when it came to him. He was also very glad for her at the moment. He pressed his hands to his flushed cheeks. "I'm very confused and there's nothing to tell."
Luna thought about it.
Draco watched the three of them bicker over the cake from his perch on the corner of the credenza behind them, thoroughly exhausted and dreading the kitchen clean-up that awaited him. He watched Scorpius and Teddy wave the sparklers wildly as Harry cut the cake. He watched Harry make the boys taste the cake first 'just in case'. And after getting a big nod of approval from the boys, he watched Harry try a piece. He watched Scorpius flush with pride when Harry loudly proclaimed that this was one of the best cakes he had eaten all year. There was surely crumbs everywhere, but Draco rarely had a chance to see his son like this, so he didn't bat an eye.
Scorpius didn't really care that Harry wasn't married. He was just wondering. Maybe because Harry already had Teddy for a lot of years, even though Teddy was off at Hogwarts now, Harry didn't feel lonely in that big house all by himself. He had said that he didn't mind, but still, Scorpius wasn't sure. If Harry was so nice, why didn't he have a perfect family? And who was this mysterious girl who made Harry so sad?
Draco snatched it from Harry's hand to study it. He blinked a few times to clear his swaying vision, then frowned, turning the paper this way and that. "What the hell is this?"
"Is it okay if I'm coming over? You won't be alone," Scorpius realized.
"It's a long story," Harry told him. "Remember those red posts on the roof of the storage shed by the playground? Well, last week we decorated them with some lanterns. The kids wanted to..."
to be nice to him, Scorpius."
– on the floor, the counter, the walls, and even the ceiling.
"It's a surprise. My uncle has a shop in Diagon Alley and I bought it. " Teddy reached inside the bag, grabbed something and tossed it into his mouth. "With my own money too. It's pretty good. Don't worry, it's not poison. I wouldn't try to poison you. At least, not yet. I have to get to know you first."
"I can't wait to see Michael and Annie and Fran and Bertie and-"
"Well, my teammates really did think it was adorable."
"I know."
Draco blinked. "What?"
that could happen?" he asked. "You might be a bit angry with yourself, a bit embarrassed, and tomorrow will be a brand new day. So, if that's the
Harry wasn't sure what just happened. "People can change, right?"
Scorpius studied Draco, who was plating some biscuits. Everyone had someone who would take care of them, right? That's how it worked. "I'll take care of you."
He supposed they were. They had a child together, after all. "We are close for the sake of Scorpius," he said. "Why? Jealous, Potter?"
The Aurors couldn't seem to grasp Draco's words. After a moment of deliberation, they got up and left without saying another word, leaving Draco alone in the interrogation room once again. He dropped his head on the table and curled his arms around them.
"Mhm."
"They'll get you too," Scorpius cried. "I'm scared. They're everywhere."
"Stay the night."
"Yes," she said just to spite him. Then it was her turn to ignore him. She turned her attention to Scorpius. "I wish you would write to me more often." She kissed his cheek, leaving a hint of her cherry red lipstick on him. "I really do enjoy reading your letters."
He blinked awake a second time, not remembering falling back to sleep. He was alone in bed this time and the noise in the manor was reaching unmanageable levels, as if he were living on top of a zoo. He supposed that meant it was time to finally give in.
Harry shrugged. "I don't know."
Harry paused. "Oh?"
He opened his eyes-
Draco was left by the wayside and all he could do was watch Harry walk back into the school.
"No."
"Harry's never awful," Scorpius corrected Theo.
"If you don't want me to say it, I won't."
"You know?"
Draco thought about that a lot these days.
Scorpius was quick to scramble onto his father's lap. "I hurt my leg," he sniffed.
He remained leaning against a damp tree trunk, arms folded at his chest, absentmindedly kicking dew off of some blades of overgrown grass at his feet. "Why not?"
Scorpius stayed just outside the kitchen. He was quite close to tears. Draco noticed and his laughter subsided. He ruffled Scorpius' hair to let him know that everything was alright before venturing into the mess. "Let me see."
"That's okay," Scorpius answered while getting under his blanket and rolling away from Harry. He was the only child who didn't bring a stuffed animal to school to hold while sleeping.
"I am insinuating that if you don't get off of my property, I will blast you off of it."
Harry decided to break it with a quick apology. "I'm sorry about earlier," he started to say. "I didn't mean to overstep-"
Draco looked down at his hand for a moment. It felt warm, despite the snowy wind blowing over him. Convenient? He clenched his hand into a fist before throwing the door closed. What the hell?
Scorpius was tempted to say that his father had started it, but he kept his mouth shut. Draco was too miffed to do anything but follow sullenly. He was always being pushed around nowadays.
"Don't ask me." Harry held his hands up in surrender. "He thinks he's some kind of a collector. Don't bother with it. It's a phase. And don't you dare show Scorp's letter to anyone."
"Okay."
He was always running.
"Besides, I
Imagine his astonishment when he clapped eyes on Harry and Teddy.
The Aurors blinked at him in disbelief. "Beg your pardon?"
"Time for you to wash that off," Draco said. "I've run the bath. Hop in. I'll be up in a moment."
Scorpius scowled and stopped short of Theo. "Don't call me 'squirt'."
Harry thought about it. "Not often. A handful of times, usually off-season." He put his feet up on the coffee table, ankles crossed. "Why? Jealous?"
"What?" Draco snapped at him.
Christmas season had arrived.
"You've already done so much."
"You don't like him either. I heard you. If you don't like him and I don't like him, then he shouldn't come to my house," Scorpius declared.
"That's not how it works," Draco huffed. "His idea of fun and mine are very different. I'm going home."
There was a quiet knock at the door, then the nurse popped her head in. "Mr. Malfoy is here."
"We're going home." Scorpius turned around and started walking down the hill.
"Bye," Scorpius said with a wave. "See you tomorrow."
"For God's sake!" Harry exclaimed. "He's six, Draco. If he wants to dress up for one blasted night, let him! It's no skin off of your back."
"DON'T YOU DARE, DRACO!" Astoria drowned Draco's excuses with one breath. "Don't you dare try to shove blame off of yourself! You do this all the time! You have always done this. You think you can wipe your hands off of matters concerning your life because life happens
It took her a few minutes to wake up. She rubbed her eyes and sat up in bed while yawning. When she unrolled the parchment, she found a smaller paper enclosed within. She read that first.
Draco clenched his fists. He didn't want to lose his nerve, not now. It wasn't often that he let his guard drop like this. "If something were to happen, and I know this will sound preposterous... Scorpius is all I have. That is-" His words broke but his gaze never wavered from Harry. This was an important moment. He knew what the answer would be. All he had to do was ask the right question. Let go of his pride for a moment to ask Harry Potter the right question. But he couldn't bring himself to say the words out loud.
"I know."
"Then make it clearer for me."
"Yes."
"It's got a cork, it's got a label, it's full. What more could I ask for?"
Caught off guard, Draco stilled, his fingers trailing by his collar.
Turns out the Malfoys had a case of strep throat. The doctor prescribed some potions for the pain and to kill the bacteria. Scorpius had the worst of it. He could hardly speak or swallow because of his sore throat. Draco had gotten away with a fever and cough. The potions made them entirely too sleepy, so they slept most of the day away once they got home. Scorpius thought it was great. He had never felt this gross before. He had also rarely been coddled like this. He could tell that his father was feeling bad for him. He felt bad for his father too. So he lay very still as Draco wrapped him up close in his sleep.
"Aw," Rose tsked. "Keep Minky. She's a nice monkey."
Harry seemed confused. "Do I need one?"
"Don't worry, I've got you."
"Don't say that." Harry patted Draco's back. "You heard him. He wants to spend the day with you. He means it, you know? He really does like having you around."
She heard pitter-pattering footsteps skipping to the bathroom and she turned away from the kitchen window with another defeated shake of the head. Honestly, where would the Malfoys be without her?
"Do you want me to be angry with you?" Scorpius huffed.
The boy nodded his head.
"What's happening?" Scorpius asked helplessly. He was at a complete loss. Something was going on and he was the only one who didn't seem to know what to do about it. The tiny cogs in his head were grinding hard. Scorpius stared at the magazine that lay face up on the floor while worrying his bottom lip. The photographs continued to move idly. They were a bit blurry and fun to see. He had never really seen himself in pictures like these before. He was usually made to pose and look proper. No one took pictures of him like this. They had had a fun day at the fair. That's where the pictures were taken. He picked the magazine up off the floor. One of the photos showed Draco laughing at Harry who had been drenched by a sprinkler that a clown had pulled out of his sleeve. That had been too funny.
"You can mix them too," Harry offered. "Teddy usually puts strawberry on one slice and chocolate on the other."
"I can invite my friends over?"
Scorpius eyed the jams. He wanted something sweet, not salty. Harry observed him for a moment before reaching over to split the sweet stuff from the other stuff. Scorpius beamed. This was the best! He wondered if he should try the red jam or the purple one.
"You really don't care, do you?"
Harry shut up and took it. He held the precious box in his hands. A life with Ginny would be perfect. He had thought so since he was fifteen. She was beautiful, funny, and sharp. They had many things in common - family, friends, humour, food, music, Quidditch. She understood him, sometimes better than he understood himself. Rickety bungalow, three children, annual Quidditch League pass, Christmas year-round. He could imagine all that with Ginny. "Ugh," he groaned and sat down with a thump on the trunk.
"I know, right?" Teddy grimaced as the sourness hit the sides of his jaws.
"She will be around. For Christmas."
Draco didn't have an answer because he didn't know either. It really was quite hard to say no to Scorpius.
Harry knocked on the door to Teddy's room that was perpetually locked now that he was old enough to learn how to cast a charm.
"-let the goblins have their share and be done with it!" she finished, sitting up straight as a rod, as she did when she was indignant. Ron was rubbing her back, trying to calm her down. "Anyway," she shoved an errant piece of hair behind her ear and sank into the couch, "I digress."
"Potter."
"No, I think it was more than that."
Yes, it's impossible. Spontaneous. A mistake. All that.
"I should go," Draco muttered. He started to push off the table.
"Yes. She likes stars too."
"End?" Harry had a sick feeling in his gut. "Can we talk about this like reasonable adults?"
"Why are you saying that like it's my fault?"
Harry shrugged. "Sounds about right."
A very amused Theo followed him in and set Scorpius down once they were inside. "Like she was some kind of what?" he asked. Scorpius was startled, so he didn't say a word.
Harry was a mystery to Draco. The man would be utterly hopeless one moment and then spout something thoughtful the next. Draco couldn't get a fix on him, not because Harry hid his sentiments, but because he wasn't hiding them. He had always known Harry to be bold. He wasn't afraid to take a chance, look the fool, try something different, or say what was on his mind. He wasn't even afraid to fall asleep beside Draco.
"You know those times when you did something so awful that you just want to curl up and disappear? Well, I'm having one of those moments."
"Not even a fish," Scorpius muttered. He looked down at his book and glared at it, perhaps hoping for his teacher to go away if he ignored the man for long enough. But Harry was just as stubborn. Scorpius flipped the page in his book deliberately and Harry didn't budge. Then Scorpius exhaled in exasperation. "You shouldn't be nice to me."
"For now, yes," Harry mumbled with a sheepish smile.
"Come on, Potter," Theo urged. "I want to hear all about your Christmas escapades."
"Eat your veggies, Harry," George piped in. He nodded once at Scorpius, who smiled back, and then he followed his brother out the door. That left Arthur and Molly. Patricia wandered out of the room again to evade more awkward conversation.
"My collarbone."
Draco sat beside his son while watching Astoria and Harry walk away to a secluded corner of the crowded dressing room, talking amongst themselves. "What are they saying?" Scorpius wanted to know. "They're probably talking about me, huh? Do you think so?"
imagined herself with one. All her life she had wanted to spend days full of adventure, travel, experiences, and freedom. She did not want to be a mother. It had never been part of her plan. She had made that very clear to Draco before their marriage. At the time, Draco had agreed. They had agreed to adventuring and traveling and experiencing freedom together, now finally rid of the war and their past. So, she had been shocked when Draco fiercely urged her to keep the baby. Their marital problems started to surface after that. Astoria hated Draco for making her feel guilty for what she wanted out of life. Draco hated Astoria because of her seemingly callous attitude towards their unborn child. And, just before Scorpius was born, they separated with rough water under the bridge.
"Wow." Scorpius found it hard to believe that someone as famous as Harry would be eating a sandwich with him or teaching at his school. He ignored the disparaging noises his father was making. "I don't think I would like to be that famous," he confessed. "People talk about you all the time. Did you know that?"
"What?" He stilled.
Scorpius was sure this was not allowed the moment he bit into the most decadent dessert he had ever had. He turned to his father with an expression of amazement. "Dad!" He held half the s'more out to Draco. "Try this!"
"Yes, yes." That was followed by muffled voices in the background. Then, "I'll be there."
Draco had blinked at Harry.
"Time for bed?"
Harry was knocked out cold a minute later, curled up on the couch. Scorpius tsked and patted Harry's head gently. Draco rolled his eyes at his son's concern before ushering him into the kitchen. Patricia was beginning to prepare dinner when the Malfoys joined her. "How's he doing?" she asked.
"I don't know."
The four of them were playing Cheat. It was game of deceit. Each player had thirteen cards and they had to go in a circle playing cards face-down in ascending order starting with ace. If you didn't have a card to play, you could pass. Or, if you didn't have a card to play, you could lie and place cards down on the pile and hope that no one would call you out on it. So far Teddy and Draco had dwindled their hands down to just seven cards. Scorpius had fifteen in his hand and that left Harry with a whopping twenty-three that he was begrudgingly rearranging.
"He is," Harry agreed with a twinge of pride in those words. Scorpius was trying so hard to be on his best behaviour. Harry was impressed by how much the boy had changed since that first day at school. He glanced up when Molly tiptoed towards them to unfurl a thin blanket over Scorpius. "Thank you," he mouthed. The Weasleys had done a great job making Scorpius feel at home. Harry was proud of them too.
Draco studiously drank the cold drink, grimacing when he was hit with a serious case of brain freeze from trying to finish the juice too quickly. He wanted to get out of the kitchen as soon as possible.
"Looks like my work here is done," Harry joked as he brushed his hands off.
Harry rubbed his hand on his pants to get rid of the warm tickle that slowly subsided as Draco's magic dissipated. "I'm fine," he told the boys who were standing on the landing. Scorpius peeked from over Teddy's shoulder to look at his teacher. Harry held out his hand to show him. "See? It doesn't even hurt anymore. Not even a scratch."
Harry winced. He brought a hand to his mouth to hide his grin. "Was he obvious about it?"
"Hey, squirt!"
Bewildered, Scorpius struggled to get out from under the blanket. "Where's Dad?"
"I just wanted to say how well you are doing in class," Harry said to him. "You are respectful of all the other boys and girls. You don't make a fuss about anything. And I've notice the effort you're putting in to make friends. I just want you to know that you are doing well, alright?"
With a wave of his hand, Harry wandlessly unlatched the window, and it flew open from a gust of wind, freezing rain splattering into the bedroom, cooling the air almost instantly. Dramatic. He shut his eyes against the droplets.
"More than Harry?"
Draco glared at Theo defiantly. "Scorpius wanted to exchange presents with Ted, so yes, I had Teddy over. Potter happened to be with him."
"What?!"
Harry was on the floor, dazed and covered in tomato sauce. There was spaghetti
is what I hate about him. He wants to make everything perfect," he ranted. "Like the world needs to look the way
When Scorpius returned with a toad grasped firmly in his hands, Draco was livid while Harry howled in glee. Scorpius was dismayed by their reactions, having hoped to surprise them with his ingenious find. Instead he was promptly marched into the manor where he splashed sadly in the bathtub while his father scrubbed his hands with an obscene amount of soap.
Theo swallowed his curiosity. He knew better than to push Draco to open up. It was best to let him be. "Anyway, speaking of Scorpius," Theo said, "when do you pick him up from school?"
After all the lecturing, he made sure to look sincerely sad and sorry. He knew that they weren't angry with him. They simply seemed to think that he was incapable of taking care of himself. There might be a bit of truth in that statement, but Harry glanced over that. He then told them that he had to continue maintaining a good relationship with the Malfoys because Teddy would be very angry with him otherwise.
At two, parents started to wander into the classroom while the children attempted to be on their best behavior. Harry and Gabrielle ushered the adults to their seats in the middle of the room. The children were sitting on the floor at the front in three neat rows as instructed by their teachers. Many of them were waving wildly at their family. For most of the kids, this was their first performance.
either."
"He was right about everything." Scorpius sniffled. "Teddy said that everyone would be angry with you and that it'll only make you sadder. I don't want you and Dad to be sadder. Teddy was right about everything." He pushed the rest of his sobs down. This was the worst day in his whole entire life. "And... I thought you got really hurt, Harry. I got scared."
Harry tsked. Draco had a complex when it came to his relationship with Scorpius. For one thing, Scorpius adored his father. He thought Draco was one of the coolest people ever. Draco would do anything to keep being that person for Scorpius. That meant hiding his past, because his past had more than few demons lurking in it. Secondly, Draco wanted to provide as stable a life for Scorpius as possible, something his parents couldn't do for him. In his eyes, a stable life meant that the parent behaved as a parent should, and nothing more. Revealing to Scorpius that Draco wasn't just a father was not part of the plan, Harry knew that. "When will you stop lying to him?" he asked Draco.
Harry tsked and pulled Scorpius into a one-armed hug once again. "You've had such a rough time." He pressed a light kiss on the boy's cheek. "Thank you for caring." He looked Scorpius in the eye. "Please stop butting into my business."
He swiftly got up and stepped away just as Molly sat Harry down. Scorpius was too preoccupied to notice so he stayed near Harry and looked on with interest. Draco sidled towards the window as nonchalantly as possible.
Before long, Harry and Andromeda were waving goodbye to the departing train along with the throng of families on the platform. Teddy hung halfway out the window, a bright grin lighting up his face, ready to face adventures of Third Year with his friends, no doubt getting up to more shenanigans and trouble than the years before. Andromeda sighed wistfully. "Before long he'll be forging his own way in the world," she mused.
"And are you a big boy?"
"Dad says we can have lasagna for dinner and then cheesecake for dessert!" Scorpius crowed. "Because Theo's here, you see?"
"Why don't you want me to be nice to you?"
"Everyone's cooled off now. It won't happen again, right?"
Harry didn't have any pretense in either his voice or his expression. "We could forget all about it."
"Whatever shall I do?" Draco tsked as he went back to his dinner. "He doesn't seem even a
"No, I didn't."
The room was plunged into darkness.
... And the next thing Harry knew, he was opening his sleepy eyes, buried under the weight of a heavy blanket.
Draco watched Harry massage his aching temple and Scorpius pout sympathetically. "Are you sure you want to go back to your place?" he asked.
"Wait."
"Have you
"Don't talk too much. Your voice could run away on you."
"Can we go to the park to look for leaves?" Scorpius asked.
record of me breaking the law over the past decade?" Draco seethed. "Do you have any substance in your case?"
"Thank you." Draco hoped Scorpius would keep that promise.
"What's
Harry sat down on the steps. "Is your nanny coming to pick you up today?"
Draco wiped some of the rivulets of sweat off of Scorpius' neck. "Will you look at me?" he asked. "Scorpius? Can you open your eyes and look at me?"
"Potter," Draco grumbled.
"Gotta go,
Scorpius scowled at the page.
Lost and blind, he ran through the unforgiving maze in his head. Blackness surrounded him as he struck wall after wall in an attempt to escape. Every inch of him ached but still he ran. Blood rushed against his ears, rendering him deaf to his own footsteps. If only he could-
A strange prickle ran up Draco's spine. Behind his hand, he felt a steady thumping at Harry's chest. "I haven't done anything..."
"Not often." Draco was vague on purpose. "There is no point in fighting it. Bygones and all. It's just wasted breath on them."
"You don't seem too keen on it either."
Harry Potter sat behind his desk with a quill in one hand and his eyes raised from his book to scan the room of twenty five-year-old children who were busily drawing masterpieces. The new school year had started just three days ago and at least half of his students were already settled in. Those were the children he and Gabrielle, his partner in crime and teaching, would never have to worry about.
Draco scoffed. "What? No."
"Gosh, if you hold your teddy that tight, won't you hurt him?"
"He never lies to me," Teddy clarified.
Harry was mouthing the words along with the class. When he saw Scorpius staring at him in absolute misery, he smiled wide and indicated for the boy to stand up taller. Scorpius squared his shoulders and blinked hard a few times to clear his eyes. Then Harry motioned for him to breathe deeply. Scorpius imitated him. He felt his breath shaking in and out of him, but it steadied his hands. When Harry started mouthing the words again, Scorpius got his squeaky voice to cooperate. Although hoarse and barely noticeable, he started singing sadly. He was doing such a poor job. He wanted to cry.
"What?"
"No!" Draco exclaimed, spinning around to face Scorpius. "Do
being reasonable!" Draco exploded. "You think you know better? You think you can push this aside? The world does not revolve around you. It isn't an idealist paradise out there, despite what you might think. It doesn't bow down to your every whim and fancy.
"Are they your not-so-proper family?"
Harry's irritation was plainly visible on his face when he answered. That expression softened immediately when he saw Draco's weary eyes and slumped shoulders.
"It's nothing to worry about. He took a bad spill in the playground and sprained an ankle. We-"
have a job," Theo added with an affected sniff. "I'm an investor. And if you're envious, just say so. You've been a bit prickly this evening. I can't imagine why." He tossed a loaded look Harry's way that Harry didn't see because he was busy loading his fork with Patty's famous lasagna. Draco did see and he kicked Theo under the table. Theo didn't give Draco the satisfaction of a reaction. Instead he asked Harry, "I hear you're something of an investor yourself, Harry. Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes?"
Draco watched the two of them join Teddy's Simon Says game. They got along well, the two of them. Annoyingly well. Draco often felt a twinge of envy when he saw how easily Harry could handle children. The only child Draco could stand was his own son. He would never have been able to wrestle the rest of the brats by himself.
Harry reached out and yanked Draco back.
Harry narrowed his eyes at Scorpius. "What?"
Harry pondered her words. "Is there anything wrong with that?"
"Is Harry married?"
"Let's have some juice," Draco said.
Draco could tell where this was going.
Draco shook his head. "No, never." He did enjoy having dirt on Potter. "You and Weasley?"
He had ended up coming home much later than expected. He had found the house shrouded in darkness. It was just past eight. On a weekend, Scorpius' bedtime was anywhere between nine and sleep. He wouldn't go to bed without fussing for a little while. So, when Draco had found Scorpius and Harry asleep, evidently tuckered out after an active reading session, he had been pleasantly surprised. Scorpius was still recuperating and Draco had some more work to do before he could think about dinner. He was glad for the lack of interruption.
"That makes you very lucky," said Draco.
Draco would hate to go within ten miles of them.
Scorpius made Teddy sit down and told him all about the past three months. How miserable he had been for being so awful to Harry and Draco. How Draco had tried to hide that he was affected at all, but Scorpius could tell he felt sad too. How quiet it had been in the manor. That maybe they had blown this all way out of proportion. He told Teddy about the ways they had tried to tell Harry that they were sorry about everything. How he had wanted Harry to speak with Draco again. "It's like they're not even friends anymore," Scorpius sniffed back his tears.
Teddy didn't answer.
"Dad? You locked the door." Scorpius' voice was muffled, coming from the hallway.
Harry said the darnedest things. Scorpius wound his arms around Harry and hugged him. "I know."
a cast. He just wanted to go home. He didn't protest when he was picked up by Harry. He hid his face against his teacher's shirt, hearing kind words being spoken into his ear.
Scorpius' eyes went wide. He flicked his gaze between his star and his teacher's star. He realized after comparing the two that his teacher drew a much more grown-up star than he did. "I want to draw
Just as quickly, a flurry of answers followed. Conversations over dinner, meaningless tiffs, meaningful looks, hints he had somehow missed - like interlocked gears finally clicking and moving together.
"Right," Draco said with obvious disinterest. Then he reached for the Quibbler that lay discarded on the coffee table. Harry figured that was the end of their conversation. He went back down to the kitchen where he was preparing lunch.
"Well, it's not the first time you've had to fend off your fans." She winked at him. "And, speaking of your precious fans, Teddy's being a pain in my arse again. I mean, how many damned broomsticks does he need? He sends me a letter every other week asking for one. What does he do? Gobble them up for dinner?"
The Burrow was packed with festivities in lieu of Ginny's return from her tour with the team. Molly had spent the entire day cooking and cleaning, charging her children with chores and chiding the little ones when they got in the way. The table was set with the most delicious food that George and Bill kept sneaking morsels of. Not all of the Weasleys could make it, but the ones that could were enough to make a racket in the house. Ginny was the coolest aunt, after all.
"My home is not broken," Scorpius chimed in. "It's a nice home. I'll tell Harry tomorrow."
Scorpius was doe-eyed, innocent as ever. "Why do you think I want something?"
"Let's gooooo," Rose whined. She grabbed the men by the hand and urged them out the front yard, onto the street where little monsters and fairytale creatures flooded the sidewalk.
"Your dad says many things. I don't want to hear it."
"He is clearly not interested."
"Yes, yes. Even Harry Potter can be a lost cause."
Sure, this is absurd.
"So?"
"It's not baseless accusations, Mr. Malfoy. We've taken statements from the witness that we believe to be true."
"You're being a tad dramatic."
Scorpius dismounted his Firebolt with Harry's help. Just as he took his first step, he tripped over an undone shoelace and fell onto the soft grass. "Ugh." He sat up while rubbing his sore hands together. "Stupid shoes."
"Did you hear about Harry Potter?"
"Potter!" Draco stormed over to the stairs, squinting to make out Harry's fallen shape. "If you broke any of my vintage, I swear-"
"Oh?"
Scorpius didn't say. He simply cuddled up close to Draco.
The older students blinked at the strange seven-year-old boy who had suddenly butted into their conversation.
Ginny dragged Harry to a cramped bedroom currently filled with luggage from visiting family members. "I have something for you." She finally let go of him once she had shut the door. "But you cannot tell my brothers. Promise me."
"Am not!"
"No, of course not," Harry said earnestly. He would never do anything to hurt Scorpius or Teddy. "We're adults. We can keep it together for the kids, regardless of the situation."
"Go." Harry nudged him off the bed. "You'll be late."
"Harry's not your teacher, and he's coming over tomorrow to teach you to fly?" Theo once again threw a pointed look at Draco, who did not deign to react.
Scorpius held the magazine up to Hermione, but she knelt next to him instead. "We went to a fair yesterday," he told her. "It was a Muggle fair. See?"
"It is," Draco interrupted with finality, without leaving room for negotiation.
"I suppose it's no one's fault but your own." Draco examined the offending ankle with prodding fingers. He couldn't tell how bad the damage was but, from the looks of it, it wasn't that bad. "One more thing, Scorpius," he said. "Didn't you think it wise to mention that your teacher is Harry Potter?"
Gabrielle wiggled her eyebrows. "Maybe love is back in the air?"
that Potter was going to be his teacher, Stori." Draco now sat up straighter. "You don't know what I've been going through these past few months while you get to romp around the world."
Draco had half a mind to join Scorpius in his sulking. Instead, he paid attention to the eggs sizzling in the pan. "He's busy. I'm sure he has a good reason to leave without saying goodbye." He scrambled the eggs with the wooden spoon rather forcefully, spraying splatters of egg white on the hob.
Harry had been expecting the offer, and had already thought up a ready excuse. "No, no. This looks worse than it is. I'll be right as rain tomorrow. Molly will be expecting me-"
"I could have told you two days ago."
"It's okay that you do." Scorpius pulled his legs up onto the couch, cross-legged. As if readying himself for a long conversation. Draco had to stifle his groan. Scorpius didn't notice as he went on to say, "Do you know something? I think it's okay that you like someone other than Mum."
"Yes."
The boy huffed. "He is a worrywart whenever I try to ride my new broom. It's very distracting, you know?"
A few minutes later, Harry was knocking at the door to the Burrow while Scorpius and Teddy stood behind him. The little boy was looking about in awe at the strange plants half-hidden behind fences. This house was like the ones he read about in his picture books. It was old and had ivy growing on the outside. The windows were crooked and the walls seemed to sway with the wind.
"NO!"
That evening, the moment Draco had walked into the manor, Scorpius was racing towards him, nearly colliding with him. "Whoa." Draco held out a hand to stop him. "Where's the fire?"
"You are being defensive."
Scorpius watched Draco drop his head in his hands with a defeated sigh, and asked, "Why didn't you tell me?" When Draco didn't answer, Scorpius got up on his knees on the sofa cushions and forced Draco's hands away from his face. "It doesn't bother me," he insisted. He wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and hugged him tight. "I was lying when I said I didn't like him. It doesn't bother me that Harry's your boyfriend."
Harry held the pillow to his face to muffle his embarrassed complaint and hide his foolish grin. Damn it, he really wanted Draco Malfoy.
"What for?" Draco muttered.
"That I liked it."
The next morning, Harry was met with a very glum Scorpius. "Oh, what's wrong?" he asked.
Harry let out a sigh. "I'm sorry."
Draco didn't know who he resented more at that moment, Harry or Scorpius. "Damn it." He ran after his headstrong son.
"Some of those are priceless, Potter," Draco exclaimed as he heard bottles clanging together in the dark. "Watch it." Just when he finished his warning, he heard stumbling and falling.
of nerve."
Scorpius followed Teddy's instructions. The chocolate melted all over his hands and the marshmallow stuck to his fingers, and he couldn't be more ecstatic.
Hopeless. Draco checked his laughter and shook his head instead. "I should be charging you for the show." He began a search under the bed for his sweater.
"Oh, I'm just saying." Harry swirled the amber liquid in his mug very attentively. "In case you had forgotten." He then gestured at another mug filled with steaming tea sitting on the counter. "For you."
"Oh, go on."
Then he turned around to face the figure on the floor. Redoubling his hold on his wand, he approached it. A nagging thought in the back of his mind told him he was still dreaming. It must be a dream. He knelt down. With a gentle wave of his wand, he lit the chandelier in the foyer.
Harry was the first to recover. "Excuse me," he mumbled as he sidestepped Draco.
"Really?" Scorpius was fascinated. He thought that only happened in fairy tales. "With music and waltzing?"
she was seeing, but she did see. She saw exactly what the heading had read – a picture-perfect day. Actually there was nothing incriminating in the photographs or in the article surrounding it. It had just been a shock to see Harry photographed with Draco Malfoy. She looked at Harry, who was watching her every expression with carefully guarded eyes. She looked at Draco as well. She hadn't seen him since after the war.
"Yeah. That's so cool," Scorpius said shyly.
Draco had had enough. "No," he snapped. "I've been trying to speak to you for weeks. I can't find you at school, I can't get a hold of you at your place, and I can't even talk to you when you're standing in front of me?!" Draco was too fed up to bother keeping his tone civil. "Fine, if you want to freeze out here, that's fine. But the least you could do is listen to what I have to say for once if your life, Potter."
Scorpius paused and looked up at Harry, squinting when the sun got in his eyes. "Why do you call me that?" he asked. "My name is Scorpius."
"You might be the smartest, Scorpius," Harry hummed, "but Teddy's definitely the craftiest."
made a fool of himself. And, in other circumstances, he would be giving Potter grief over getting blasted on a couple glasses of wine. But these circumstances were different.
Turns out he had been worried about Scorpius for no reason at all. He shook his head to himself once the Malfoys had rounded the corner and disappeared from view. Trust him to jump to awful conclusions. He tiptoed back into the classroom to fill Gabrielle in on all the details.
Harry didn't say.
"You've snapped back to your senses?" Ginny reached out and hooked a finger under Harry's chin to make him face her. "You wish you hadn't? And nothing like this will happen again? Is that the plan?"
"I'm saying that I thought blood was all that mattered to you," Harry replied frankly.
"Impressive." Draco wasn't being facetious either. He had been trying to show Scorpius how to tie his shoes for ages. "Did Patricia teach you?"
"Harry said so," Scorpius told him. "He said it's okay to cry because then people will take care of you and be nice to you. He says it's okay to get mad too.
Draco picked up Scorpius' discarded broom off the grass and said, "I wonder if I'll ever get used to the idea of him flying."
"You told him you're his family?"
Now it was Scorpius' turn to harrumph. He planted his fists at his hips for good measure. "I was just going to ask what you wanted to Christmas," he claimed. "I wasn't being needy."
Astoria's words faded as she stepped inside the manor, saying, "I didn't think I'd walk in on you confessing your soul to Harry Potter-"
Harry didn't know what to do with that kid. "I wanted to speak to him before I... That is, we had a couple of long talks after we received your letter," he said. He didn't mention that the 'talks' were actually just him trying to convince Teddy not to sulk. "He's protective."
"Why don't you join us?" Theo offered.
Harry clicked his tongue and grabbed the pile of cards off the table, much to Scorpius and Teddy's glee. "How did you know?" he grumbled at Draco.
Scorpius tugged at his pouting lip, utterly guilt-ridden and contrite. There must be a way to fix this.
Draco scoffed. "You and me both."
Loads of questions hung in the air, tense and unsettling. But Draco stayed put, as did Harry. Eventually they reached for their tea. They sipped the hot beverage while unraveling their own thoughts, trying to find the right words, unhurried. Harry had no delusions of what life was like for Draco. A man with a criminal record linking him to the Dark Lord would never be able to scrub his past clean. He would always be high on the list of 'persons of interest' when it came to any situation related to the Dark Arts. And if he was called in for questioning by the Aurors, he was in no position to argue.
Draco groaned inwardly as he walked into their living room and placed Scorpius on the couch. What was Potter doing, filling his son's head with nonsense? Some of the things his son said led him to believe that the boy was really much older then five. "It's... complicated," he said as he knelt down in front of Scorpius and helped him take off his shoes.
Scorpius picked his head up to look at Draco.
"Oh, I need a drink," Draco moaned as he scrambled up to his feet and sped out of the room before he heard anything more from his pure, innocent baby.
"Don't worry. I think you're doing just fine now. Maybe some more medicine will help you get a bit of sleep." He rested a hand over Scorpius' forehead. It burned. "Something for the fever," he decided. "But I do have to warn you, it's going to be very gross."
"I suppose it is," Harry answered. "I would take you along if I could."
Harry nudged Draco. "See?"
"You were at school, weren't you?" Arthur asked wondrously.
Harry hesitated a beat.
Harry squeezed Scorpius tight. "Trust me," he whispered. "I know
Astoria was infuriating. She was entitled, belittling, and smug, about many things, but especially about his life, and he was not going to engage today. He stormed out of there without another word.
"Everyone at school says awful things about you."
Draco didn't comment. He knew he was too much. He pulled a black bow tie off a peg. "You could have just transfigured one for yourself," he said while turning Harry around to face him. "You didn't have to come all the way here."
"Dad, you need to grow up," Scorpius advised. "You are my father now. No more fighting with Harry. He doesn't have a mother or father to teach him to how to say things. That's why sometimes he is rude to you. But he's always nice to me."
"Harry? Harry Potter? You don't know?"
"Mr. Malfoy-"
Harry now stood beside him, hands pressed against the edge of the sink, leaning forward to study his expression. "What happened last night?"
Scorpius blushed. He had never thought that he could have a big brother. He cast a sideways glance at Teddy.
Ron Weasley came into the drawing room in search of his daughter. He rolled his eyes when he found her coddling Harry. "Done feeling sorry for yourself yet?" he asked.
Scorpius looked up at Harry. "Nobody," he maintained. "And I like playing on my own."
"It's wonderful."
think that, because you're my family, they're your family too." Teddy said in all seriousness. "You'll make a lot of friends because there are a lot of kids your age. I'm the oldest. I'll be your big brother."
Ten years later, though, things change…
"How about a face?"
Harry dried his hands on his jeans and sat down on the bench. "Speaking of Scorpius," he said, giving Draco a pointed look.
Draco was confused. "You liked him well enough ten minutes ago. What's happened now?"
"I know that," Draco murmured. He could feel Scorpius pressed against his leg, squeezing his hand, obviously wanting him to say no. "Would you like to visit, Scorpius?" he asked.
Draco could think of hundreds of reasons, and he was sure Harry was thinking of the same reasons, so he didn't bother to answer. Instead, he said, "Have you been with anyone besides Ginny Weasley?"
"Not really," he murmured. "Did you like it?"
Draco nodded once and walked away without a word.
Teddy grabbed Harry by the shoulders and spun him around, shouting, "
FATHER AND YOU LISTEN TO
"Sure, there is," Scorpius retorted, coming to Theo's rescue in an instant. "He's exciting." He liked Theo because Draco liked Theo. That was reason enough. He also hadn't seen Theo in ages.
"You come here right now."
"Good morning."
Draco was much too spent from the hike up to argue anymore. He should have known Potter would pull a quick one on him. It had only been a matter of time. He let Harry usher him down the hill. Teddy and Scorpius were already speeding towards the bustle, having honed in on an ice-cream stall.
She wrinkled her nose. "Your funeral." She went back to rooting through her salad to find the strawberries. "How's it going with you and Malfoy anyway?"
"That's the reality of things," Harry insisted. "Teddy and Scorpius are a reality of my life. I will absolutely not apologize for them."
Astoria knew that to be true. Draco had always been rather lonesome, even as a child, too aloof to have this much fun. "He seems to be a popular boy."
"I don't like him anymore and I don't want him to come over."
He trailed off into incoherent mumbles.
of an effort than Draco possibly could. The straw that broke the camel's back was Harry lecturing him on the merits of Halloween, of all the godforsaken days to argue about. Draco knew he was on the wrong side of the battle, but he'd be damned if he recognized that in front of Potter. He dropped the bag of candy on the floor of the playroom with an angry huff. All he ever did was indulge them.
