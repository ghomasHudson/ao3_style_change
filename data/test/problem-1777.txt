, and I just. Draco, I don’t know why I didn’t tell you, I don’t know, I don’t. I just felt like, I felt, I just couldn’t. I couldn’t. I should have and I didn’t and I’m sorry.”
“Eh, whatever. It’s maddening sitting still all day.” She throws her head back groans loudly. “Ughh, I would
“Well in that case,” Draco freezes when Potter gently takes his braid in between his fingers, giving it a little tug before he pushes it behind his shoulder. Draco doesn’t breathe once, watching him with wide eyes. Potter leans forward and his heart rate spikes. “I agree that you’re not a blood purist anymore. But if we’re saying it like it is,” he melts when he feels Potter’s warm breaths on his lips, “you're without a doubt insane.”
He grits his teeth. “You see me at PTA meetings every week, Boot.” His fists clenched involuntarily and he feels himself grow hot. He wasn’t at the meeting today and Draco had only taken it as a sign that he would finally get lucky. Clearly, he was wrong.
Bloody hell, he shouldn’t have decided to wear all black today. He must look odd; he feels odd. Draco shifts on his feet. Twenty faces keep laughing in front of him and he wonders if he was the thing they were laughing at.
Draco smiles faintly as he watches the picture perfect image of childhood innocence through the stained, unpolished glass. He wonders if that’s how he and Potter would have looked, had he not spoiled the chance of a possible friendship that first night at Hogwarts and continuously for the next seven years after that. Had Death Eaters and jealousy and bloody obligations not played a part in shaping his school experience.
Theodore Nott, who took his virginity and the first bit of his sanity too when he abruptly left for Belgium at the first stirrings of the war.
Ron groans. “Your worst nightmare, mate,” he grumbles to himself, brutally stabbing his eggs with his fork. But even he was enraptured by Malfoy’s graceful legs and aristocratic beauty. Nearly everyone was watching Draco Malfoy saunter into the room, lapping up his oozing sex appeal like thirsty strays. It simply wasn’t fair. If the git had to be a girl, why did he have to be such an attractive one? He looked like one of those animated Muggle Princesses for fucks’ sake.
Draco thought Arthur Weasley’s starry-eyed gaze was unbeatable. Clearly he was wrong because Harry looks as if someone had gifted him the Sun when James wraps his arms around his waist for less than a second.
Not wanting to admit that he has absolutely no idea what an amusement park is, he asks, “I don’t know, will I be amused?”
Next to him, Scorpius noisily slurps down several spaghetti noodles. It was the only thing Draco knew how to cook at the moment but thankfully Scorpius didn’t seem to mind much. Either that or he was masquerading his distaste for the dish under his overly enthusiastic eating. He had to admit, he does miss the convenience of house-elves. Learning to cook dishes other than the three variations of spaghetti he knew was on his ever-growing to-do list.
It shouldn’t be nearly as endearing as it was to see Potter’s face turn a guilty shade of pink. He blinked owlishly at him, before turning his gaze to his plate, glowering at it like it somehow insulted him. “It doesn’t take a bloody genius to note that you have a nice singing voice.” He coughs into his hand. “For a ferret,” he adds, because just like Draco himself, Harry Potter couldn’t bear the idea of giving him a compliment without throwing in a special insult just for him.
He’s always wanted attention when he was younger. He’d take every open path he could to make himself remembered. However, the post-war version of himself learned that attention isn’t always all that it’s cracked up to be. Large crowds staring at him always feel like the Wizengamot glaring down with critical eyes and tight mouths. He can’t breathe whenever he’s in front of one, his breath tightening and suffocating like he’s trying to breathe with his face covered in plastic. It’s god awful and he doesn’t quite see anything humorous about his discomfort from the attention.
“Malfoy,” he says around a mouthful of the crackers and cheese set out for them, “fancy seeing you here.”
Draco nods proudly. “One of my best creations. It helps me during the late nights I’m up conducting research. Good for a bit of inspiration, you know?” Though maybe he wonders if he should have put some of that energy into finding suitable art for his home.
Harry swoops in and saves him, retelling in detail about one of Draco’s studies on his wall about the Earth in perihelion and the strength of blood curses. He hadn’t told him about that one, seeing that there was very little room to conduct an experiment ethically, but he’s so fucking grateful that he had the good grace to speak for him.
Draco blinks in bewilderment, looking at Harry for support. He only shrugs. “Oh. Okay. So do I just uh…” He awkwardly bumps his fist against James’. “Boom,” he lets it explode once they bumped.
Right, because really, look at them. Potter, with bacon greased hands and mouth, nearly drooling over his plate as he eats. And him, with his refined and posh-to-a-fault mannerisms. It truly was either a miracle or fate’s special way of fucking with him.
“It’s the only time, or else you two will continue shutting each other out. We’re a family, one little divorce doesn’t change that.” He murmurs, patting the chair arch, “Family doesn’t fade.”
“Never call me that again,” he hisses in warning. Harry risks smiling, somehow knowing that this version of Malfoy, all hissing and dramatics, was far from dangerous. He points his wand to the bedroom door. “Now leave Potter, so I can be excited in private.” His sneer is far less sinister than before and is actually a rather endearing look on him.
Up above, a small gray moth hovers around the light produced from his wand, the only lit light in the room, dancing around the artificial ray in circles. Draco’s eyes follow it, drawn to the tiny insects’ movement. Watching its mesmerizing motions was a far less demanding task than figuring out what in the hell he was going to do about Astoria.
aggressive. He was hardly even raising his voice. “Look, this is you,” Scorpius holds a yellow box of the biscuits right under Draco’s nose. “Buy my biscuits! Buy them! Buy them now!”
That goofy grin on his face is enough to settle his nerves at the moment. “Whatever.” His cheeks heat up. “Love you too,” Draco grumbles, meaning every word.
Draco tsks softly, rubbing his cheek with the curve of his thumb soothingly. Albus is still beside himself with laughter and Scorpius looks as though he may fall ill soon. “At least it’s a funny one, right?”
A hand grabs her by the elbow. “No,” Harry says. “No, just give him some time. This is…different for him.”
His voice is less breathy this time and his writhing body has stilled behind him. It takes Harry a few seconds for his body to catch up to his brain and he’s nearly about to continue pressing open mouthed kisses further and further down Draco’s body until he notices. Draco’s hand tugs a little harder than before at the hairs on the nape of his neck, drawing his attention to the present.
Draco clears his throat awkwardly, straightening his tie. What the hell was Scorpius telling this kid? “I can’t sing,” he lies. Albus puts his hands on his hips, looking thoroughly unconvinced. Merlin, who raised this child? Oh, right. “And I don’t think
“Harry Potter,” he responses through gritted teeth. Just saying his name produces a schoolboyish sneer on his face. She gently brushes his cheek up and down with the smooth edge of her thumb, scratching the skin lightly with her manicured nail. “Apparently, Scorpius thinks he’s a real hoot.”
Scorpius tugged on their connected hands, trying to free himself from Draco’s strong grip. He just can’t seem to find it in him to release him into the unknown.
father. From what I can see, you’re taking care of him without any help from his mother, you’re putting a conscious effort to ensure that he doesn’t grow up with the same biases as you, and not to mention, you
Oh he was going to be sick all over these scuffed floors. Of all the nice Muggle kids in this sodding school, his son befriended a Potter? And not just any Potter, but one that was an exact replica of Harry Potter?
Harry raises a brow. “No offense, but he should have known that you didn’t like women. I mean… look at you.”
He sighs and places a hand on Harry’s shoulder, looking torn between wanting to comfort him or wanting to throttle the magic out of his body. “Look, I get it alright? You’re still hurt over the breakup; Ginny is too by the way. But snogging some girl that could dub as Malfoy if she cut her hair isn’t okay mate, no matter how fit she is. I mean honestly, I always guessed you were a bit obsessed with him, but come on Harry, this is taking it too far.” He looks to Hermione for back up and she nods with a straight face and crossed arms. Merlin’s tits this was worse than he thought. “Seriously, she even said my name like he does.” He shudders, looking a little green in the face underneath his array of freckles. “Super creepy.”
Draco rolls his eyes digging his hands into his perfectly plaited hair. “It’s not because of the sodding chopsticks. It’s just…” he shakes his head, trying to articulate his words carefully lest they have another misunderstanding like the infamous ferris wheel ride. How can he accurately tell Harry that the intensity between them has somehow grown stale in the few hours since they were snogging like teenagers in Harry’s kitchen?
“Scorpius!” Blaise yells in a deep baritone voice behind him. Draco winces. He should have taken that potion. “Your overprotective father wants to see you!”
He rolls his eyes. “Thanks.” He frowns. “Is it odd that I’m a bit nervous?” He's been bouncing with anticipation all this week and now that he’s actually going to do it, his bloody nerves are getting in the way.
Draco laughs into the soft cotton of Potter’s Muggle shirt, his drunken mind leading him to rub his lips along the fabric to feel it’s kitten fur softness. “But I have my left hand!”
She’s gone before he can respond. He’s tempted to follow her and ask what it is that he needs to figure out, what in world did Hermione have an opinion about, and why in Merlin’s name would he need good luck for. But he doesn’t, because when he looks up, not a single pair of grey eyes are staring at him and Parkinson is nowhere to be found as well.
“I…” The wind blows long strands of blonde in his face, covering his mouth and eyes. “I don’t know.” All he knows is that he doesn’t think they were quite made for posh dinners and button down shirts. He wants to be somewhere where they could let go of their pretenses, erase their former selves, and just be. Potter and Malfoy would have never been able to do that without fear of being let down or rejected.
“So,” he says, drumming his fingers on the gradient countertop. “Are we going to have a healthy, adult conversation about why your son supposedly hates you?”
from the war? No, he’d learned nothing from Voldemort literally taking residence in his home and being forever marked as one of them. Somehow Potter’s got it in his mind that Draco was up to something, and was sick enough to use his own child as… what? As a way to infiltrate Muggle spaces and harm innocent children?
“Same thing.” He stands up, ready to drink his sorrows away in his office. No, smoke them away. That’s what he’ll do. “Get whatever you want.”
“Oh,” he breathes. “Okay.” He looks down at his joined hands. The question is stuck in his throat and he doesn’t know how to ask it without sounding like a fool.
Harry points in the direction of a balding man older than his father with a hooked nose and stiff posture. “
“They’re good kids aren’t they?” Potter says from behind him, a smudge of pink paint on his flushed cheeks from a boy who wanted to paint flowers on him.
James turns his nose up. “I have an issue with both of you.” He huffs, “Of all people, why him? What makes him better than Mum?”
In another universe, maybe where Draco has the disgusting misfortune of being a Gryffindor, he can see himself boldly telling Boot to shut the fuck up and step away from the man he was trying to bugger.
Home. He doesn’t want to go home. Home is empty and cold without Scorpius and Astoria there. Soon Scorpius would be heading to Hogwarts and where would he be? Home, in an empty, cold house with no art on its walls and lacking the footsteps of another person. Even the great, vast universe is filled with more life than Draco’s home at the moment.
“Does… Godric, I’m old,” Ron heaves. Draco cocks his head to the side worryingly. Wasn’t this man an Auror? He stands up straight and fans his red face several times. “Does Ginny need to beat her arse for you Malfoy?”
Albus suddenly snaps his fingers. “Aha! I’ve got it!” Two blonde heads turn towards the bouncing child. “Scorpius, you should bring Mr. Malfoy!”
Because that’s really all he wants, isn’t it? Someone to tell him that he’s not crazy, that his work is good, that
She kisses him twice on his forehead, her finger tracing his dragon earring. Then, like the Slytherin she was, she pulls his hair back and whispers in his ear everything he needs to know about how to keep what was his.
Ron snorts into his drink when Harry’s done explaining. “Sounds like a load of bollocks.” Hermione curls her upper lip and from the sharp squeak he lets out, Draco can only assume that she pinched his thigh. “I-I mean that sounds super interesting!” He clears his throat, leaning forward with feigned interest on his face. “Please, tell me more.”
Draco lets himself give in to the hug for a single second before pulling away. He couldn’t afford to let himself get aroused around all of these people and Merlin especially not around Potter’s sleeping child.
Draco scrambles away from Harry’s body and warmth. Wrapping his arms around his knees, he levels him with a cautious gaze. “Why do you want to know about that?” A sliver of his old nastiness that he can’t push back down in time works its way back into his voice.
The shopgirl snaps her gum and with a tired sigh, begins to scoop one of every flavor into two cups. Draco hands the first one to Lily and Potter can hardly remind her to remember her manners before her mouth was full of strawberry ice cream.
Potter stills, eyeing him as though he was trying to make up his mind about something. “You’re actually ser—” He shakes his head, quickly moving away from him. “Nevermind. Kids! It’s storytime.”
It was only when two gifts were sent by owl for them when he saw a glimpse of joy in Scorpius’ eyes for the first time that day. Potter’s gift may be worth all of the frustration. Maybe.
Even Greg Goyle, who was sitting next to Malfoy, seemed to be becoming a bit flushed in the face. Harry watches him stare several more times at Malfoy’s swollen chest before finally bidding him goodbye and awkwardly adjusting the front of his robes as he walks away.
reflects off on the smooth expanse of his forehead, dancing across the lightning bolt scar; taunting him.
His voice falters. He remembers those same comics sitting above the shelf on his bed in his childhood. He remembers learning what the word ‘Mudblood’ meant before he even knew how to spell his name. He remembers being three years old and his mother coddling him, telling him that he’s magic. She had quickly followed this statement up with a reminder that he was
Either a squirrel was feeling particularly cheeky today or someone was in the tree and was ungraciously hinting at him to find his own tree to daydream under.
“Don’t be mad at me,” he protests, “I am simply saving you from the embarrassment. If anything I should be
Draco rolls his eyes. “No one needs to beat anyone’s arse. But uh, thanks for the sentiment I guess. And yes, that was Astoria, Hermione.”
Ron drums his fingers on the table for several minutes, staring at Draco with an intensity that makes his stomach tie into knots. He leans back into the booth, his face giving away nothing.
,” Blaise and Pansy say together, wagging their eyebrows in unison. Draco wrinkles his nose. He and Harry were definitely
“Drew,” Draco corrects softly, craning his neck to look at the crumpled piece of paper Scorpius waves in his face.
Draco huffs, still peering into the room. “Of course I am and I’m going to have Albus help me. Tomorrow is the last day of school for him, there’s no harm in having a little fun. Even I pranked my Charm School tutor on my last day.” He smiles. Those were good times.
Warm fingers trail along the raised skin on his arm and this time he actually does shiver. The calluses on his hands felt as delightful as he imagined them to feel. “No. I’m not.” He doesn’t realize it, but he was edging dangerously close to his faded Dark Mark.
“So what,” Harry challenges, “You’re just going to hate him because he’s not your mother? Don’t you think that’s unfair?”
Scorpius shrugs. “Did you know that he once rode a dragon Dad? Like, a real dragon?” He grins, bouncing on the balls of his feet. “That’s so cool! Have
“Worst eater ever,” Potter grumbles, not even looking as he reaches over to wipe Lily’s face. Somehow, it only makes it worse, with ice cream finding its way into her lashes.
There’s truly no structure to it; it can happen from the turn of a head, a touch on Draco’s arm, a kiss on the neck. It can happen like it has now, with Draco pulling Harry into a storage closet in his son’s school and dropping to his knees without an ounce of warning. Because he can. Because he wants to.
Only he can hardly focus from the sound of giggling and laughter floating up to the third floor. After half an hour and with hardly two sentences written, Draco’s considering whether it was worth casting a silencing charm when Potter bursts into his office. He opens his mouth to chew him out for not knocking, a skill that even Scorpius had mastered, when he noticed a woven gift basket in his hand.
His body slumps over, his weight pinning Draco onto the desk. He hardly feels his legs, his flesh has turned into a mushy pile of that Muggle Jell-O food that Scorpius likes so much.
“You’re right,” Harry murmurs when Draco has to pull away for air. “The reality is so much better than any fantasy.”
He flips over, beginning to press small kisses onto Harry’s fluttering chest. Harry moans, arching his back up into his mouth. “Fuck, I don’t know if I can go again—you wore me out.”
“I didn’t say anything,” he mends quickly. Insulting a child was definitely the wrong way to start off the parent-teacher relationship he was hoping to cultivate.
He doesn’t quite know if he deserves an apology from a boy that was only telling the truth. He was a war criminal and in the spirit of saying it like it is, Draco’s fairly certain that he will never be more than that. At least, not when he was in England. Plus from the way James was fuming, he doubts he’ll ever get that formal apology. Luna should though. Her forearm is clean.
Ana nods, seeming thoroughly unconvinced but letting it go all the same. He’s grateful. “Did you get a chance to look over that pamphlet I gave you?”
“Draco,” she sighs. “You know I love you right?” He freezes. Noticing his reaction, she laughs, shaking her hands quickly. “Not like that, love. I think we both know. We always knew, didn't we?” She laughs again and he unclenches completely. He hasn’t heard her laugh in a long time. “But, if you would, listen to me?”
“I’ll give it back, just hold on.” Harry captured Malfoy’s curious gaze. Harry wiggles to the orange in his hand to show him that two can play this game. The open juices flow down his wrist in a sticky trail of tangy flavor.
Draco doesn’t know quite how to answer that question, frankly because he’s never heard of a calculator either, but he does indulge him in everything he knows about the mystical sound Muggles have discovered coming from Saturn's rings.
Ignoring the last disgustedly sweet sentiment at the end, something about the rest of his statement didn’t sit right with him. How can he just talk about it like it was some strangely
Draco yanks Harry by the collar of his shirt, pulling him closer to him. “Yes, and he’s the biggest sodding bisexual poofter in all of England you crazy bint!”
He thought that it was the last thing that he wanted to do and that his day couldn’t possibly get any worse. But, like always, Draco Malfoy was there to prove him wrong once again.
“I’ve got you now you little twerp!” She roars. Scorpius squeals some more, throwing the dragon on the floor as he tries his best to scramble away from her.
He leans over the stove, his hands gripping the counter. “I don’t know what to do with him at times. I know why he’s so mad, but I can’t change the past.” He goes to run his hands through his hand but Draco stops him, clutches onto both. His hair looked nice today. “I made mistakes, I won’t deny that.”
Draco truly was beautiful—all pale skin glittering from the combination of fairy lights and the dusted gold glitter on his cheeks and eyelids. He quite liked his robes too—despite Draco’s persistence in only wearing dark colors, Harry has to admit that dark hues do serve him well. Everything felt perfect, except for one tiny, minute detail.
“Oh,” Draco breathes, some the pain starting to disperse and beginning to morph into sparks of pleasure. His calloused fingers are godsent, truly.
“Shut up. And you should be honored, one day you’ll get to see it if you play your cards right.” Harry rolls his eyes, though secretly ecstatic for that day. “But I don’t want the first time we, erm,
Draco’s face crumples into a sneer. Waiting for his answer, Potter looks down on him and he wishes that the sodding prat would just sit down so that he isn’t reduced to being loomed over by everyone’s favorite Gryffindor. Death is a better reality than being in a submissive position to Harry Potter.
Draco frowns. “Is that some sort of Muggle saying?” If so he’ll have to add that to one of his multitude of lists. Perhaps he’ll make a new one titled Muggle Sayings and Phrases. That’ll go nicely on his wall.
He doesn’t like Harry’s mirror. It talks, unlike his Muggle one on Shooter’s Hill. In a voice too smug for an inanimate object it says,
“First Lucius, now your son,” she tuts disapprovingly. “Draco, I’m not saying that you should never care about what he thinks, but I really want to emphasize that his opinion doesn’t hold as much merit as you think it does. Especially when it comes to who you decide to fuck. You’re single and handsome, the world is your gay oyster yet you concern yourself about what a ten year old thinks? Pfft, this one right here,” she points to her blossoming stomach, “will have to deal when I want to fuck Blaise or our side pieces.”
Harry nods, his eyes drifting back over to Malfoy who was blissfully unaware of the chaos he and his sweltering chest has ensued. “Agreed. Maybe Hermione could—”
For a horrid little terror, Draco is beginning to think that the kid wasn’t half bad. Then again, he tends to like anyone who can get under Potter’s skin these days. His father scowls disapprovingly at him and sucks his teeth before turning his attention on a still sniffling Scorpius.
When he’s drawn up from the dip Harry sniffs at him, an odd grin on his face. “I thought you were going to drop me,” he admits.
, for you to touch me like a girl. Because I’m not one and I don’t want to be touched like one. Merlin’s saggy tits, that probably doesn't make any sense.”
Pansy sits down in the kitchen chair Draco pulls for her, sighing all the while and rubbing her stomach. “Paranoid much?” She jokes breathlessly. As much as she tries to deny it, Draco knows this pregnancy was far harder for her than she will ever admit.
Close up, Draco can see how awful she looks. Bleary, dark eyes shrouded in dark circles. He was married to this woman for ten years, but yet Draco’s never seen her with her hair and nails undone, with her lips cracked as she tries to summon up the courage to speak to him. He doesn’t recognize the gaunt woman before him. He doesn't know if he wants to either.
Harry growls, crossing his arms over his chest like a petulant child. Malfoy reaches for the jar of pickled tentacles set near Harry when he notices a smattering of dark green on his nails.
After his tenth attempt to grip the food with the sticks and watching the roll slide out of his grasp, he sets the paired utensil down and mopes. Draco rolls his eyes. Good Merlin, they should have agreed not to act like children as well.
“That was for the book,” Potter grins, those dimples deeper than he’s ever seen them. “It’s literally exactly what I was looking for. I could literally kiss you right now!”
“I’m gonna tell him.” Intent on finding Harry at this very moment to shag him silly, Draco pushes his seat back, his arms wobbling as he does, “I’m gonna—
Potter’s face looks wonderfully surprised and he actually jumps a little in shock. “Malfoy you don’t have to I mean, geez Al is a great kid and all but Merlin his singing—”
Draco wants to try kissing him again. That tingling feeling is addictive in a way he’s never expected. The heated friction of Harry’s beard scratching against his mouth still sings in the pores of his skin. For that alone, he’s willing to give just about anything a try. Twelves years of nothingness will do that to a person, he supposes.
Instead of answering, Scorpius bites his lip, an unusual bout of shyness overcoming his face. He starts swaying side to side, hands braced firmly around his knees. “Can I ask you something? And can you promise not to get mad?”
“Well I don’t play follower, to anyone in fact,” he points out, a familiar air of snootiness to his tone. “Though I will say, both this potion accident and Hermione taught me a very valuable lesson.”
James tugs at the ends of his hair, looking so much like his father than Draco has to clear his vision several times to make sure he wasn’t seeing a very melodramatic 13 year old Harry Potter in front of him. “You’re not listening! You
Once his best friend, fictitious lover, now served as his greatest enemy. The thought of her finding a legal loophole just to keep Scorpius holed up in Paris after they’ve already made a life here in London makes his fingers twitch and they instinctively search out another bottle of Firewhiskey, only to remember a second too late that there was none left in the glasses.
She laughs again and it’s officially the most he’s heard her laugh in one day. “I know about you and Harry Potter. You two make quite the couple.” She reaches up on her tiptoes and plants a soft kiss on his cheek. “Keep the hair and the man.”
Scorpius, who had been watching the scene unfold with wide, pale eyes, is the first one between the four of them to reach the Floo powder, pinching a bit into the fire like he’s seen Draco do and calling out for St. Mungo’s.
.” She snickers into her palm and Harry just knows that whatever it is wasn’t going to be a walk in the park.
Draco rolls his eyes. Yeah, he bets he was looking forward to Draco making a right fool out of himself. He wouldn’t dare to give him or Scorpius the satisfaction. “I’d rather not degrade myself by doing so.”
“So.” Harry, looking unusually uncomfortable, points to his flowery pink plate with a chopstick, “Sushi?”
Draco notices a scrap piece of paper sticking out of Harry’s coat pocket. Before it flies away, he gently takes it from his pocket, smoothing it out and smiling at the small message written on the crumpled note in scratchy handwriting.
“Alright then,” Potter starts. Draco waits for him to pull out a children’s book and begin reading from it, but he does no such thing. Instead, Potter gives them all a content half-smile, basking in the anxious eagerness of the children and Draco. What was he up to?
Pansy and Blaise’s owl was a gorgeous pure black hue, not white. His mother preferred to Floo him than deal with the birds. His eyes scan the stamped address at the bottom of the envelope. “North Sea?” His stomach drops. Azkaban. His father.
There’s a polite knock on the door right when he’s settling into his seat, a glass of Scotch hanging loosely from his hand. Cool blue eyes peer at him from behind the door. “Trouble in parenting?” His mother quips. The knowing smirk on her face looks out of place with the elegant finery she has on.
“It means Parent Teacher Association. Basically, I’ll be helping out around your school and doing… stuff. Important stuff, I’m sure.” He doesn’t exactly know what a ‘booster club’ was but hopefully it was better than that god awful Slug Club?
Anger and anxiety blossom in the pit of his throat, threatening to explode into some magical occurrence if he’s not careful. He takes a deep breath, forcing himself to calm down. The
Down below, a young man gifts a girl his age with flowers and an overly large stuffed bear. Potter’s arm wraps around Lily, the other slung behind Draco’s back. Better judgment aside, Draco leans into it, the curve of his bicep pressing into the beginning of his braid.
Harry curls in on himself and Draco worries for a moment that he’s going to be sick. Sometimes it wasn’t just Gryffindors that lacked tact.
Draco looks away and mentally creates a list of all the reasons why kids were terrible pests and certainly
Scorpius feels it too, noticeably staying away from him even though they both knew Draco would never snap at him. It’s only when he nervously asks to use the Floo to call Albus does he speak to him for the first time since they arrived home.
He just wanted to be friends. At least friends. And he wanted Malfoy to know that Harry didn’t hold any ill feelings towards him. Maybe some annoyance and mild disgruntlement at times, but not hatred. If only Malfoy could just be here, so that he could tell that simple sentiment, then maybe he would stop feeling so drawn towards him.
It works like a charm because apparently, that was all Hermione needed to dive into a lengthy one-sided discussion about her Ministry work, her werewolf activism, and literally every single fault in the government. Harry and Ron indulge her as best as they can, nodding and asking questions while secretly exchanging bored looks each other’s way.
“Splendid!” Malfoy beams, a pleased, dark look passing over his eyes. He roughly grabs Hermione in the crook of his arm. “Now, you’ll have to show me how to use a tampon because I can’t figure it out for the life of me.” He hears Hermione let out a nervous giggle. They sashay away, Malfoy glancing over his shoulder one last time to give Harry an evil wink and smirk.
Albus nods, clinging onto every word Scorpius mutters. He may not always show it, but Draco was beginning to think that there may be some manners hidden underneath his boisterous antics. At the very least, the kid seemed to be a focused listener when his son was speaking. Draco can appreciate that, even if he can’t appreciate much of his other characteristics.
Harry flushes and curls his hands into fists. “Whatever Malfoy.” He can’t even come up with a suitable retort because Malfoy was right— his eyes were on a part of Malfoy’s body that had captured his attention since that damned potions accident.
Harry holds his chin between his fingers firmly, “It's not like that. Granted, I do think a potion and a Mind Healer would really help you—”
Harry grumbles, seeming to let it go and allow Draco to sleep. His eyes are just fluttering shut when he notices the bedspread between Harry’s legs moving rhythmically.
He’s stacking the carrots into three neat rows to cut on the worn dinner table when Harry whispers in his ear, “You okay?” Nodding, he gives him a tight-lipped smile. He can handle a stinging nose and racing heart for a few hours. He always has been. This was Harry’s family and he will need to get used to them for this to work.
His son throws his head back into the air and sighs dramatically before stomping the winding staircase, each footstep vibrating throughout the room. Draco shakes his head. He was his mother’s problem now.
The only other person who is as quiet as he is was James. He sat next to Lily and Ginny, scowling when Harry had boldly sat next to Draco. One seat next to George remains empty and Draco wonders who else they were waiting for when Molly serves everyone their plates.
Potter consumed his thoughts most days now. Over break there was no lesson plans to be sent and Draco found himself checking the Muggle horoscope daily again. He may or may not also have checked under the horoscope for Leo as well. Just to see. He had to force himself last week not to ask Potter for his birth chart to satisfy his curiosity.
Draco smirks. He couldn’t wait to see his son’s shirt adorned with a Slytherin green crest. Dutifully obliging, he sets him back down and is immediately engulfed in a rapid succession of excited, ten year old babbling.
“You! You fucking stay. Ginevra is a grown woman, she can Floo herself to St. Mungo’s.” Harry’s back falls flat against the squeaking cupboard as Draco pushes his finger further and further into his chest. He glances over at Ginevra, terror clear as day in his eyes.
It shouldn’t bother him this much. He sees parents pick their children up late from the school all the time and not turn their hair grey if they're a few minutes past time. But not Draco. He valued punctuality too much. So much so, that he had ran out of his presentation with the Astrology and Astronomy department and into the nearest men’s room to hastily change into his Muggle clothing. His fingers are fiddling with his last undone button when he rushes to Apparate.
He takes this, swallows his pride, and accepts his compliment no matter how biased it may be. “A little bit of validation that I am wouldn’t hurt though.”
Malfoy, who had always had an eerily light footfall to him, is as silent as a cat when he ambushes Harry in the Potions classroom. Harry jumps when he sees him standing right in front of him, his crooked glasses sliding off his nose from the movement.
“So what, we’re just going to let him sit by and blatantly disrespect you like that?” She shakes her head, red hair flying. “No way. I will
Draco snorts. “Someone needed to tell them. They’ll thank me later. If not, they can still bugger off either way because I don’t care.” He points his chin in the direction of Parvati and Padma’s stunning traditional Indian garbs and nods his head approvingly. “Now
He gently sits down next to him on the bed. “Can you just please tell me what’s wrong? It could be some side effect of the potion.”
They laugh, except for Ginny, whose eyes are transfixed on something behind Harry’s shoulder. “I don’t know about you Ron, but I would hex you to pieces if you try to mess up my relationship with
He doesn’t know about the potion part, but Harry had to admit that if his personality wasn’t so dreadfully ugly and there wasn’t a sneer permanently fixed on his face, Malfoy could be described as somewhat pretty. But girlish? He couldn’t see it. It was probably his natural aggressiveness that prevented him from seeing Malfoy as anything other than a raging, overstimulated manic. Even as a female, there was something so distinctly masculine about Malfoy that was hard to erase from his character with a single cocked up potion.
She eventually gets him to go back to take a sample of the cocked up potion and he gives it to her to obsess over. How she managed to find time to do extra studying outside of the insane amount of homework all the professors were assigning left and right never ceased to amaze him. He wondered when she slept—if she slept at all.
“Mr. Potter,” Draco purrs when the last person leaves. “There’s something very urgent I need to discuss with you.”
He was desperate to leave for somewhere, anywhere else. Something about this crowded environment was biting at his nerves and he refuses to concede that the culprit was his fictitious anxiety this time. No, they needed to be somewhere else, like in a house with the rain thumping rhythmically against the rooftops and grey light pouring in from the windows. Somewhere less…this.
“I think it’s sweet,” Hermione states firmly over her wine glass. “Don’t be upset because your cooking is rubbish.”
“I... I’m sorry, I shouldn’t have—” He does as his Charm School tutor always told him to do and pushes his pride down his throat, realizing that regardless of his curiosity, this was none of his business. “Sorry.”
, arsehole, is this question right here.” He points to the second question that caused this entire mess, reading it in a loud, clear voice in case Potter is as deaf as he is stupid. “‘In your opinion, do you think that Frankenstein is a neglectful parent to the monster? Answer in complete sentences and give three examples from the text to prove your point. What do you think would constitute as a neglectful parent?’ Does this seem okay to you?”
“Draco,” Harry grabs his arm before he can make it down the steps. He presses his lips close to his face and for a moment, Draco thinks he might just kiss him on the cheek. He leans in, waiting to be rewarded for today, for not losing his shite in front of such a large crowd. Warm breath tickles his ear as Harry says, “A Calming Draught is not a replacement for therapy and a potion.”
He’s sure his face is burning. She had forced him and Scorpius to watch that Muggle movie with the red-haired mermaid and he knew exactly which song she was referring to. From the way Harry and Albus were snickering, they knew the one too.
Draco hadn’t realized how hard he was laughing until the sides of his stomach stiffened into a dull ache and Harry’s face and neck was an adorable shade of red. It keeps coming, bubbling up under his chest and reducing him into a puddle of fondness for Harry.
His son shrugs and continues to excitedly wave in the air a childishly drawn picture of him and a dark-haired boy with green eyes and brown skin. Draco raises a brow in interest. “It’s me and Al. Though, I don’t know why it isn’t moving.” He brings the paper to his face and inspects the drawing with a pondering frown.
Draco concludes that he may be a bit of sadist, seeing how much he loved to torture himself reading the Muggle horoscopes that came in the paper.
“It’s not,” Malfoy states quickly, wiping the tear tracks from his face. “I don't even know why you care so much.”
Watching as Malfoy does his usual rounds for breakfast, Harry vows to catch him in between classes, to show him, to tell him that he understands and that he's thankful for his forgiveness. That maybe, they can start on even ground again, to let the dust of their past settle and try to go forward in the future as friends.
The lights are turned on when he comes in, and he hears something, an animal possibly, wailing. “Good Merlin…” he whispers, his nose wrinkling. The sound claws at his eardrums painfully. If that’s what a pregnant Pygmy Puff sounded like, he was in for an even longer night.
Several minutes later the Floo roars to life and before he knows it, Harry is stomping into his office and waving a familiar looking parchment paper in Draco’s face, a fond smile on his lips. “Care to explain what this is?”
Despite the tears still falling freely down his face, a wry little smile forms on Draco’s lips. His fingers clutch a little tighter into the stuffed dragon Scorpius left with him. He seems so happy, so bright as they run together and Draco has a feeling that he just
“Better?” Draco asks. He hardly hears Scorpius’ murmured yes over his friend’s cheering and loud applause.
There’s a bottle of wine calling his name downstairs and Draco was not above using a little bit of alcohol to ease his nerves. He tiptoes on quiet feet, trying his hardest not to disturb Scorpius during his Floo conversation. But curiosity grips him when he hears soft voices talk to each in harsh whispers and Albus’ voice is devoid of its usual giddy joyfulness.
“What says the first day of spring more than a bouquet of cherry blossoms, eh?” Harry waggles his eyebrows in that ridiculous manner he always does when he finds something particularly witty.
He fixes his with a flat look. “I quite like my skin on my body, thank you. Besides I haven’t asked you to meet with Pansy and Blaise.”
Malfoy tsks in mock disapproval. “I would chastise you on your choice of language, but it would be fairly unnecessary of me to scold a detention serving delinquent such as yourself, yes?”
He needs water. Or liquor. No, water. No one needs to witness Draco’s Death Eater Blues spectacle again.
Bloody hell that was today. He sighs. All of this glasses' endeavor with Scorpius caused him to forget about today’s commitment. “Right. I’ll see you later then.”
She rolls her eyes, sitting down next to him on the stands. “I said hello, Harry.” Her brow already sweaty from playing most of the afternoon. Harry smiles at her, resisting the twitch in his hands that whispers for him to reach out and touch her by the waist like he did when they were together. He wasn’t her’s anymore, they were friends and friends don’t grab each other by the waist and place their head on the other’s shoulders.
Even Ron, who still wasn’t Draco’s biggest fan, is enamored with his son, teaching him chess moves with an easy patience Draco has never seen from him.
“Excellent! And don’t worry there’s always room available for parent volunteers. I’ll put you on the listserv so you can get an update about our next meeting but first, what is your email address?”
The same four witches and wizards are there: Stalls Windsor, Cressida Crass, Reese Parcel, and worst of all, Vera Galatea. Muggleborn, Gryffindor, and with a notable hatred for him, Galatea is certainly not his biggest fan. She has a good reason of course to loathe him, but Draco can’t help but wonder if it’s her who's been voting against him all this time. He needs all of their approval to have his studies accepted and he doubts she’s willing to give any ex-Death Eater a chance in this department.
Harry’s there at the entrance of the kitchen, clinging onto the door frame as his tired eyes scan the shattered mess of tea, glass, and fresh blood Draco was sitting in.
Draco bites the inside of his cheek, his arms swinging loosely around his body. “I can burn them for you if you want?” Just like his father, he too has a talent for burning literature.
“Yeah, I bet you do,” Draco mutters, the feeling still surreal. He looks at Scorpius. “Go pack your things. You’ll need to stay at my mother’s for the night.” As much as he would rather take Scorpius with him, he was never the type of kid that would willingly give up his rest for an adventure. He’ll be whining to go back home before Pansy is even in her hospital bed.
Harry doesn’t even blink in response. His face glows under the false constellation, the luminous quality of Draco's magical creation reflecting back in the pupils of his eyes. He’s there, everywhere—on the rim of his glass, the black of his hair, the shadows of his face. His namesake has made its mark across Harry’s face.
Draco sighs again. It was scary how much Scorpius was like him. He was stubborn and held onto things far too long. Just like him, he wore guilt like a second skin, causing him to overcompensate and over-apologize for every little mistake he made. Draco did that a lot with his father and then later with Astoria. And now it was a trait he unknowingly passed onto his son.
Malfoy gives a half-hearted sneer. “Thanks. Because that’s what every girl wants to hear when they’re—” he groans again and lays his head flat on his parchment. “Just forget it.”
Draco shakes his head, looking at the cherry blossoms in his hands. The first tear that falls down his cheek is a complete accident—a result of some sort of cosmic occurrence, he’s sure of it. The second falls and he reasons that he probably just has allergies. But then third comes and he concedes that maybe he wasn’t as terrifying as he likes to pretend he was.
Draco scoffs. “When have I ever made a big deal out of something?” Scorpius fixes him with a withering look, then glances around their new, bare-walled house as if to prove his point. Pursing his lips, he folds the paper onto neat little squares, shoving it in his breast pocket for later. He holds his palms up. “Fine. I won’t make a big deal out of it.”
He wants to say something to her. Something, like he sees her, he understands, he’s so sorry for not realizing before and blaming her for something that was out of her control.
Straightening up instantly, Draco shrugs on his cloak and hastily leaves out of the building before Jaspers comes back to tell him any more obvious truths. “Ana, yes how are you? Is Scorpius okay?”
Harry squeaks then blushes beet red. Oh, right. He rubs the back of his neck and gives him an awkward smile. “Ah well, that’s a bit convenient then eh?” He chuckles nervously, internally kicking himself for his timidity.
Harry puffs his cheeks like a fish, looking like Scorpius when he gets caught doing something naughty. “Ah, you got me there,” he admits, scratching gruffly at his beard. Draco is unimpressed by his humor and he lowers his eyes in embarrassment, his entire body deflating. “Look, I didn’t want to try anything with you until Ginny and I’s divorce was finalized.”
is, right? Doesn’t that go against nature or something? I guess magic does too if we’re being objective…” He realizes he was ranting and coughs in embarrassment. “Sorry, I guess what I’m saying is, is not to rule someone out just because they seem one way. You never know, the perfect bisexual guy could be right underneath your nose but you’d never think so because he seems straight.”
“Don’t talk with your mouth full,” Draco half-heartedly scolds. He was still fixated on the strange pamphlet in his hands. “And it’s… an opportunity. Mrs. Lellory gave it to me.”
Potter peers over to look at Draco’s watch. “Sure,” he shrugs, “We have a few more minutes to kill.”
He tries to conclude with his meal, but the smiling faces of nuclear Muggle families on the pamphlet stare back at him.
He looks over at his wall, wishing that the answer was plastered somewhere amidst the sea of calculations and predictions.
Underneath a tiny headline about an attempted break in at Gringotts, the paper encourages readers in bold print to turn to page five for more details on their private relationship.
Ron covers his mouth with his hand. “God I think I’m going to be sick.” He shakes his head quickly and recomposes himself. “No, no. The female menstrual cycle is natural and there is nothing to be disgusted by.” He nods, before smiling proudly to himself. “Hey Harry, have you ever heard of this thing called feminism? It’s pretty neat, Hermione taught it to me. This may sound crazy but there are some books that you should really read, they’re… Harry? Harry?”
Draco makes a sound mixed between a snarl and a yelp as the hand yanks him away from his wand with irrevocable swiftness. It latches tightly to his fingers and with reignited resolve, Draco readies himself to knock the prat out with his bare fist before hexing the first wizard.
He learns more about himself and what he needs more than he has in ten years with Astoria. Like, for example, Draco finds that he hates topping, no matter how much he wills himself to do so. Harry’s amazing of course, but those seven times of having sex with Astoria has given him an irreversible aversion to it. Bottoming could hurt at times, but doing something he’s uncomfortable with hurts worse.
He nods, humming as though he’s figured it all out and can deduct why Draco hated Potter so much. “Well, maybe that’s why you’re so scared. Mr. Potter rode a real
“Harry!” Ron’s faint voice calls, “Don’t let Malfoy distract you!” Between the whistling air and Malfoy’s snarky remarks, Harry forgot for a moment that he had not only a team but an entire crowd waiting on bated breath. He tends to forget that he isn’t just playing against Malfoy, he was playing for his house.
Potter softly elbows his ribs. “I’ve been meaning to say this for a while, but, I’m sorry for what I said after that first PTA meeting. You’re clearly not…like
The shaking starts at the base of his spine this time, working its way to his hands last. The urge to vomit at the realization is so dreadfully intense, Draco nearly gives in and hunches over from fear.
He nods distractedly, giving Ron a half-hearted pat on the shoulder. “Yeah, sure, Unicorns are great. I gotta go but I’ll see you two at dinner, yeah?” He leaves before they can keep him any longer than necessary, ignoring Ron’s cries of
There’s a very fitting Muggle song that children would sing about this. He and Malfoy sitting side by side in a tree, only there was no kissing between them, just a newfound trust in one another and maybe, if Malfoy allowed it, something more.
The door is opened with a flick of her wand and McGonagall waves them towards it despondently. “Dismissed.”
. Merlin, was he a bore. What was Pansy thinking? Draco knew that his oddities and love for astronomy weren't the height of groundbreaking conversation but come on, even
All eyes turn towards him and he sets his fork down, rolling his eyes playfully. “Fine. You’ve caught me. But in my defense, it’s only a low grade of Veritaserum and I’m only doing this because there seems to be some unresolved animosity in this family.”
As soon as everyone was ready to go they all side along apparated to a small alleyway near Kings Cross. Mr Weasley went and got them all trolleys and they loaded there things on to them.
Potter flips what appears to be a pancake in the air with practiced ease. Showoff. “She never seemed to stop,” he mutters bitterly. “Which is all the more reason to be careful.” He levitates a plate of dry toast over to Draco. “To hold you off. I can hear your stomach growling all the way from here.” Draco rubs at the pink tinge forming on his face. He hadn’t noticed his stomach was so loud.
Draco shakes his head, not having it in him to correct the misunderstanding. He can’t believe it. This feels too perfect, too good to happen to him on this day of all days.
“Nothing. Goodnight.” He pauses, tests the waters before saying quietly, “I… I care about you. A lot.” It’s not quite a proclamation of love, but it’s there, so close to what he will say one day to him.
“I hate you and you’re stupid scar face more!” Malfoy counters, lunging at him as he kicks and claws at his clothes. “You literally ruin
There was that laugh again. “You’re a menace,” he quips, lacking any bite at all in his tone. “And your teeth will fall out prematurely.”
This time, Draco really does snarl, quite loudly in fact. Boot turns to him as if suddenly noticing his cold presence, a warm smile plastered on his face despite Draco’s persistent scowl. Harry cringes and shakes his head, mouthing for him not to say anything about Ginny.
Frantic, Harry searches around to find a sheet of long blonde hair and a green skirt, but the students slowly filtering around him are all Fourth Years going to Snape’s. He spins around and finds himself face to face with two highly concerned looking Gryffindors.
Head in his hands, Harry gazes over at Malfoy’s blushing cheeks, watching as he nervously tucks and retucks a wayward piece of blonde hair back behind his ear, his eyes suddenly fixated with the breakfast food on his plate and not on the Gryffindor table. The sausage, which he discreetly shoved off to the edge of his plate, was being avoided like the plague.
“Filthy,” Harry agrees, his wet tongue swiveling languidly in the hollow of Draco’s throat, sucking and licking at the skin in a way that will surely show the next day. He moans into the air. “Absolutely filthy.”
Counting his breaths, Draco reminds himself that Muggles were not dangerous. He wouldn’t be burned at the stake—metaphorically or literally—for being a wizard. And if they tried to he had his wand, Kingsley Shacklebolt, and the Muggle Prime Minister to defend him.
Harry had set his plate in front of him, brushed his fingers through his hair, and ordered him to take a bloody nap.
Harry gapes at him like he just suggested eating with his feet. “No! I can do it, I just need to focus.” He bites his lip, his face an intense look of concentration as he tries once more to lift the food with his chopsticks. It looked promising, the food stuck into the end of the sticks as he slowly brought it off the plate and to his opened mouth. Draco resists the insatiable schoolboy urge to kick the table and make him drop it just to see his reaction.
“Oh fuck you!” Harry shoves him on the bed and Draco drags him down by his sleeve with him. He rolls his eyes as Draco curls up and laughs into his bedspread, his face buried under a pile of long hair and unmade red bed sheets.
Ana, keen enough to sense that there was some shared history between them, shifts uncomfortably next to him, her clipboard tight in her ringed hands.
Draco clutches at his chest once they’re outside, the night’s winds not strong enough to blow away tonight’s failure. He doesn’t know whether the hyperventilating begins before or after Ron and Hermione say their goodbyes to them. All he knows is that it took everything in him to put on a fake smile and choke out a parting goodbye before he’s hunched over with his hand on his heart, breathing out far more air than he’s inhaling.
Thankfully Scorpius is at his mother’s for the weekend, because he still doesn’t know how to explain why he and his teacher share the same bed when they can. Or why he was walking around wearing Harry’s too large shirt and pants.
He should stop thinking about this. He should, lest he find himself having a panic attack because of his constant fear of having a panic attack. It’s happened before, he doesn’t see why it wouldn’t happen again.
going to regret it.” His eyes find Harry’s and he gives him one last sneer before grabbing Parkinson’s arm and leading her away from the trio.
“Yes Harry. Maybe now Scorpius can finally meet that mysterious oldest son of yours. He’s dying to ask him about Hogwarts.” He looks at Scorpius who is currently gawking at a fat caterpillar on the sidewalk. “He says I’m too old to tell him about how Hogwarts is now.” He rolls his eyes. Scorpius could be such a berk.
He brushes against his prostate again and Draco stifles a cry. Adding just the right amount of pressure to send jolts of pleasure up his spine but still not enough to unravel him completely. He does it again, only this time he rubs it for less than a second before retracting his fingers. “You bloody tease, just get on with it!”
“Though I heard,” she purrs, “That Mr. Potter is out on the market again.” She crosses her smooth bare legs, biting her lip in a way that he assumes is supposed to be seductive. She has a glob of hot pink lipstick smeared across her teeth and Draco wonders if he should be a good samaritan and tell her so.
There’s a collective intake of breath, and after that, no one makes a sound. James’ footsteps and the slam of a door echo in the now silent house.
Draco’s trying to reason with Scorpius about why he can’t let his Muggle school friends come over to see Princess when he notices his hair beginning to fall loose in the middle of the school hallway. Harry’s there, grinning like a madman with a laughing Lily in his arms. Harry blinks innocently at him and claims that it was actually his seven year old child who unbraided his hair, not him.
His voice is another murmured purr and Harry can feel his sweetly-scented breaths on his cheek. “Projection, projection,” he croons in his ear. The closer he gets, the harder it was for Harry to tell whether it was his breath or his body that smelled so invitingly sweet. Whatever it was, it was making it hard for him to concentrate on pretending to look busy.
Potter’s voice is turning into a pleasant lull and Draco’s eyes are demanding to be cast into darkness. When he wakes up, Potter’s looming over him with a small smirk in an empty room.
Draco takes this as a win for the day. Not Splinching his bits off should always be considered a win.
He blows her an air kiss and steps into the Floo just as she flips two fingers at him. He was suddenly in need of a long, hot shower.
“Out. On Saturday’s Ginny takes them to her Quidditch game so they won’t be back until later. Sit.” He motions to the table before them.
Draco gives her a breathless half-smile, pushing a long strand of hair away from his face. “No, no, I’m quite alright. Just came back from a, uh… jog?” He swallows, trying fruitlessly to lubricate his dry throat.
Malfoy gasps, grabbing his wand and launching a quick Stinging Hex on his neck. Despite the pain, Harry laughs, pleased to be taunting Malfoy without the threat of them coming to serious blows.
Potter comes in, his booming voice and charming smile capturing the attention of everyone in the room. Even Kacia quiets when he walks in.
become an Animagus. “Good Merlin, please tell me you don’t live your entire life around these made up rules?”
Draco allows himself to smile, showing off all of his straight, white teeth. They were arguably his best feature, after his eyes and his hair and his cock of course. “You wish.”
Draco casts the proper cleaning and protective charms, hissing at the cooling sting. It’s been years since he’s had to do either of those charms and it seems as though the discomfort never ceases to go away.
The sternness in her mouth relaxes and Ana nods her head in quiet understanding. “Ah, I see. Scorpius is a bit on the shy side, but I think Al is helping him open up more to the others.” Her mouth curls into an amused smirk. “And wouldn’t you just love to know who Albus is?”
ing the nefarious lube container from the drawer. A wet finger, then two, then three, works him open with surprising speed. There’s no time for build up or foreplay. Harry was a man on a mission. “But not enough to do this—”
George smiles and for a moment, Draco sees double. Inhale, exhale. George’s hair is too long, it’s covering something that’s not there.
Unfortunately, cutting carrots is a little disgusting. His hands are covered in carrot residue and he can only take so much before he stands up to wash his hands of the odd feeling. Draco stares down at his slightly orange-tinted hands as he walks to the loo. Ew. This is why he hates cooking.
He finds himself a seat in the back, far away from the other parents talking amongst themselves and especially far away from Potter and Boot laughing together at the front of the room. Draco taps his foot impatiently and checks his watch. 5:05. The meeting was supposed to start five minutes ago. Where the hell was the sodding leader of this group?
Hermione won’t stop sighing next to him, both from her exasperation of Harry’s aloofness and because she absolutely detested not knowing every single little there is to know in the world. Ron keeps chattering away in an attempt to ease the tension but was unknowingly heightening it with his constant babbling. Between her sighing, his talking, and Harry’s ever-shortening fuse, every opportunity that could be used to corner Malfoy for a talk is spent with Harry trying not to snap at his dearest friends.
Draco lifts his chin. “I am, actually. Complimenting you.” Potter stops drawing. Possibly stops breathing. Draco holds out his hand. “Now, may I see one of those coloring utensils, please? I think I will draw a flower.”
He’s meant to laugh at the joke, but his wife’s name makes his stomach pull into tight little knots.
He trudges into the school with heavy feet and with an even heavier heart. He’s grown thickened skin over the months, but every so often, one of their rejections manages to cut him a bit deeper than he can handle. Even a dragon can be burned from fire.
Astrology’s validity in the wizarding world doesn’t carry over into the Muggle world so seamlessly. Draco himself embraces aspects of Wizarding Astrology in his work, but Muggle Astrology had no real bases, no foundation, or a theoretical constitution. It was just composed of pretty words lumped together to trick hapless fools into believing common philosophy.
I personally hated this chapter. I hate writing sex scenes more than anything in the world but I love them in fics and I know a lot of people do too. The only way I can get through writing them is by making it as purposefully awkward as possibly. So here y'all go; my very awkward, very first published sex scene. I did my best lmao.
He laughs and Draco flushes a little. A nice laugh to match his equally nice voice. Gulping down the piping hot tea Potter shoved into his hands the moment he sat down, he makes a valiantly conscious effort to not think about Potter’s bollocks while sitting at his kitchen table. Though with the muscles in his back stretching as he reaches up to grab a bit of flour from a high shelf, he finds it impossible not to think of it.
“I’m fine,” he sniffs airily, “You don’t have to worry about me.” He sounded less convincing, once the brick school building comes into view—large, imposing, and completely different from anything in the wizarding world. His grip on Scorpius’ small hand instinctually tightened despite his internal reminders that Muggle children were not dangerous. If anything, Scorpius probably posed a greater threat to their safety than them to his.
Draco leans forward, examining him closely. “Tell me, Potter, where did you get your eyeglasses from?”
“And I know that you care about her after everything. But you’re not a bad person for wanting to protect Scorpius’ peace of mind.” She looks at Harry. “Help me out here Potter?”
The sound of Finley’s heavy footfalls trail behind his muttered curses about poofters and Malfoys, and it’s all Draco can do not to turn around and hex him dead. He doesn’t need his mother to tell him that he was a better duelist and far more magically powerful than Finley will ever be.
He makes the unfortunate mistake of turning around just to see her grabbing Malfoy’s hips from behind, forcefully bending him over and pretending to fuck him as Malfoy moans like a cat in heat. She pulls on his hair and he rolls his eyes back like he does every time he places a fucking sausage near his lips during breakfast. His keening vibrates in Harry’s ears.
“So, last night.” He roughly clears his throat and glances over at Draco. Draco raises an eyebrow, already frowning in faux displeasure from the humming and from the question he knew Potter was attempting to hint to.
But no, the British Ministry cares more about whether being a Capricorn will help you find the love of your life in the next 29 days.
Offended, Draco bristles in his leather seat. Those ‘rules’ were hardly made up. “You do realize that most of that list is composed of my
Disregarding her point, because she makes an annoyingly excellent point, he questions, “Side pieces?”
With balled fists, Scorpius marches into Ana’s room, his head hung low and his black-framed glasses sliding down the bridge of his nose. Today will be an uncomfortable day for him, but he’ll survive.
This is where he draws the line. His already pristinely posh accent turns sharper, crisper as he attempts to formally decline Potter’s request. “Oh no, I wouldn’t want to impose—”
He brings Harry’s hand to his clothed chest. Underneath, the skin tingles faintly, like all magical wounds do.
The Calming Draught was wearing off, he can feel it from the way his heart was beating a bit too fast to be comfortable in his chest, but all he has to do is answer this one last question. Just one. He can do this.
“I…” His son is being brainwashed right before his very eyes. “There are so many things wrong with what you just said that I don’t even know where to begin.” Needing to take his frustration out on something, he growls at the large pile of unbought biscuits, the things taunting him with their presence. “That utter bastard, making us sell biscuits— for what? It isn’t like biscuits is the only way to fund things!”
His breathless ‘yes’ is buried under Lily’s squealing about the young couple and from the talking of the other riders. He hopes to Merlin that he didn’t just imagine it. Because if his ears serve him correctly, and he thinks they do, then he was positive that Harry Potter just asked him on a date. One
First, he nearly gets the scare of his life right out of the lift when Jace Jaspers, the bullheaded astrologist, jumps next to him as he steps out to head to the conference room. Draco's made it a point to ignore Jaspers as best as he could every time he had to come into the Ministry, but like a hound, Jaspers' managed to seek him out each and every time.
He wipes his sweaty palms on his trousers, hyper-aware of how odd his wizarding name and waist length white-blonde hair was amongst this group of regular looking Muggles. Even his dragon earring, the black metal that looped down from his Helix to his earlobe, just screamed
He waits until every child has walked quietly down the hallway before making his move, feeling far less unnerved than before.
Draco chides him with two soft tuts of his tongue. Several pale fingers absentmindedly trail the fine red trimmings of Harry’s robes.
Potter raises his hands passively. “Look, Malfoy, it was just a simple question to gauge reading comprehension. What’s the big deal?”
Draco’s learned the hard way that anyone who befriends Harry Potter will be subjected to small displays of physical affection. All strictly platonic of course, because what a headline that would be—the wizarding world finding out that the Chosen One fancied blokes?
“Already?” Harry asks incredulously as he wipes the saliva from his mouth with the back of his hand.
“Yes,” he says with the utmost conviction. No more distractions; this was happening. He rears his head back, looking at Harry through the ruffled strands of blonde hair that have come undone out of his braid. “Intimidated Potter?”
Harry’s throat dries. Suddenly he was imagining a very male Draco strutting around the castle with his robes and heels. He presses closer into his body, more than grateful than ever that he had someone to help hide his pesky erection from anyone’s prying eyes.
Harry wraps an arm around his neck, pulling him close to kiss him on the cheek. “Good, because I want you to see this. They do specials every month on a certain weird space thing and guess what this month’s special is on?”
what that thing is? Huh. Let me get a closer look…” The only thing she looks closer at is Luna’s breasts rising and falling beneath the amulet. “So pretty,” she purrs. Gryffindors.
Ana excuses herself and gives them several minutes to collect themselves. Potter places a large, tanned hand on Scorpius’ small back. “Hey champ, there’s no need to apologize. Accidents happen sometimes yeah? The important thing is that both of you are okay.”
“You can and you will,” McGonagall declares without a shred of remorse. “As for your quarters, you will need to be moved to a private room for the time being.”
He swallows, hating that his throat was still drier than a desert despite how much water he’s been drinking. “I never said I was sorry for… everything. So, I’m sorry.”
Pansy would kill him if she found out he was smoking without her. So he vows to smoke enough for the both of them.
He removes his fingers, and Draco tries his best not to seem too disgruntled over their loss, reminding his needy libido that it would soon be filled with something much more satisfying.
He hums again, ignoring him as he checks the tea for the fifth time. Draco narrows his eyes. It’s been too long since Harry’s remembered that they used to be enemies for a reason. If he wasn’t so head over heels for this stupid Gryffindor, he would have hexed him in half. He does not do well being ignored.
His own wand is strapped onto his thigh, the length of holly begging for him to brandish it and hex Malfoy off his broom.
Potter puts a hand on Draco’s shoulder and gives it a little shake. His natural reaction is to growl indignantly. He hasn’t seen Potter since the trials, since Draco was paraded around the wizarding world as nothing more than a vicious war criminal. He can’t just touch him so casually as if they don’t have a shared history. As if nothing even matters and they’re just two wizards navigating the Muggle world together.
Oh, what joy Rita Skeeter and the Daily Prophet readers would have if they could see him now. He could just visualize the headline,
He reasoned that he didn’t care if it hurt, but there was no way he was going to showcase how inexperienced he really was right now when everything was perfect and Harry had hardly been touched at all.
Harry nearly chokes on his spit when Malfoy roughly grabs one of his breasts in his hand and smiles down at it fondly. “My figure was always perfect but it’s nice to know that I’ll be just as desirable as a female.”
mouth. Something’s shifted between them, he can feel it. He couldn’t just be Malfoy to him anymore. Truthfully, he stopped being Malfoy to him a long time ago. Maybe around the same time he went from being
He melts into his seat, feeling all the more anxious than he did when he was standing in front of the room. His long braid swings on along the back of his chair, the tail swishing with each movement of his head.
Potter makes an indistinguishable sound and mutters something under his breath. Something that makes him blush and makes Draco wish for the love of all things magic he would repeat it louder. A thick slice of syrup-covered bacon is shoved into his mouth to avoid speaking any longer.
Albus continues chattering at rapid speed, with Harry having to remind him every so often to take a breath. “And you’ll finally get to meet my Uncle Charlie, Scorp! He lives with dragons.”
Draco shakes them off. Damn kids and their stupidly adorable faces. “Whatever. Be back here in three hours, that’s five o’clock exactly. Now go on, scram.”
Okay yes, maybe when he was younger and yes when he was drunk gossiping with Pansy, but in general? No, he was the furthest thing from mean!
There it goes again. The conversation that makes him so tired that he can sleep for a light year. He doesn’t know why Harry and Astoria are both so mentally exhausting. Neither of them knew how to let things
“You’re not wrong about that,” Harry adds, snorting into his chest. Draco’s still silently dying in shameful mortification to care about Harry’s comment.
Harry warned him that something will click, that he’ll see what everyone’s been saying. Only, he never thought that he'd see what he’s been avoiding in his own reflection.
Draco swears Pansy can smell the gillyweed on his washed skin when she arrives through the Floo the next day, her narrow eyes narrowing further as she looks him up and down.
He hears Harry swallow loudly in his ear. Draco lightly taps his foot in encouragement. With a deep breath Harry moves with open arms to engulf his son in a hug. “James, hey, how are you? How was school? Did you learn anything interesting—”
The corridor is becoming crowded again as more students file into Snape’s class. A green skirt that was nowhere near as finely pressed as Malfoy’s twirls around pale legs and Harry’s drumming with anticipation again.
Harry shakes his head, eyeing the various notes, figures, and calculations with the wide-eyed curiosity of a first year Hogwarts student. “Nothing. But really, who would have known that you were, well, like
Letting go of Scorpius’ hand, Draco looks Potter up and down, his nose placed snobbishly in the air. Outside of the classroom, Potter looks as though he dresses himself in the dark. The arms of his rolled up sleeves are wrinkled and if he looks close enough, Draco thinks that he may be missing a gold button on his maroon shirt. There should be no reason why his child looks better put together than him. There was also no reason why he should be standing in front of him at the moment. “We’re good over here Potter, but thanks.”
, “and now you’re…” he gestured vaguely to Malfoy’s pink face. “I don’t know, it’s just odd that you’re suddenly so sick and groaning in pain all the time and…”
“Well, Lily seems to be the only child here with sense.” Draco looks around. Dozens of Muggle children were walking around with flushed faces and smiles, their eyes glowing as they pointed to the next monstrous attraction. This was what he wanted Scorpius to experience. What example would he be setting if he denied Scorpius from enjoying Muggle culture as his father had done to him?
“Aw Draco, maybe that’s a sign,” Harry tsks, reaching up to rub the top of Draco’s stinging head with sympathetic eyes. “Maybe it’s just the universe’s way of telling you that you look better on your knees.”
“And you are?” Potter opens his mouth to respond but Draco drunkenly pushes his finger against his parted lips, not caring for a second how peculiar the action is and thinking only of the best way to get Potter to
With wild eyes, she searches the train station, as if trying to mentally seek out Scorpius. She’s off again, looking through each train cart window and calling out Scorpius’ name.
He wants the very best for his son, he really does. Yet how can he show what the best looks like when all he’s gotten from his mother is the worst? And it’s not like Scorpius needs any reminders of his mother’s neglect. From the nervous energy that surrounded him when he asked for Draco to meet his teacher, they’re clearly still fresh in his mind.
Harry every so often gives him a thumbs up from in between an intense game of exploding snap with George’s son and Draco smiles back, peeling his potatoes and content with being alone as he does. This wasn’t so bad, as long as he stayed out of the way. Scorpius was doing good enough for the both of them. They could get through this yet if they both played their parts.
Potter laughs at his offer. His laugh truly is a marvelous sound to the ears. Some of the rage bubbling his chest shimmers down like cooled lava, still hot and burning to the touch, though not as violent. Not as destructive.
“Maybe… maybe you should cut him some slack, Ron. He’s not doing anything and he can’t help it if, well, er… you know.” He makes an awkward motion to his chest and flushes. He lowered his voice, suddenly worried that Malfoy may have unnaturally sharp ears and could hear every word he was saying. “This is exactly the type of thing Hermione is mad at you for.”
That night in their bedroom, the last day of September is hot and sweetly scented and heavy from the incoming thunderstorm. Harry kisses each of the pale scars on his chest, no longer avoiding them. Draco tells him to always check the cabinets for hidden potions in the future, no longer avoiding that either.
Draping the blanket over his shoulders, Blaise says, “Do you love me enough to listen to me when I say that you need to go back to a Mind Healer and finally take those potions? I mean think of how much better you’ll feel if…”
He waits an hour, two hours, three brutally long hours before he’s nearly vibrating with pent up sexual frustration and he has to drag Draco from the ball right when things start to shimmer down and couples begin to say their goodbyes.
He loves Blaise like a brother, but there was a very distinct difference between talking to him about sex and talking to Pansy about sex. Draco doesn’t think he could mutter the words ‘Harry’s cock’ to him without one of them running in the other direction. He loves Blaise, but Merlin, Draco doesn’t think he’s met anyone who embodies the essence of a heterosexual man more than him. At least Harry has Ginny to talk to, regardless of their previous engagement.
“That sounds a lot like an end to me.” Shaky breathes puff out onto his cheek, hot and desperate like the heat from the fire. He tugs a little harder on his hand. “You…you’re coming back? Right?”
Her face suddenly widens and a grin the size of a troll breaks out onto her round face. She crouches down and squeals, “Oh and you must be Scorpius!”
“I heard that!” Draco folds his arms over his chest. He may have to protect himself from his own son tomorrow. He, Harry, and Albus ought to learn to be grateful for his sense. Never mind the amulet, but Draco makes sure every morning to give them each reminders of the astronomical occurrences happening that day, just so they’re all well prepared. Only Lily seems to appreciate his efforts. She was currently squealing over how pretty the condensed brew is. The amulet looks much like a glittering pink crystal when finished and Draco knew that out of everyone, she would find the beauty in it.
Ana holds up a finger in a ‘one moment’ gesture, disappearing into her classroom and coming out with an outstretched glossy pamphlet and a smile. Draco frowns at the pamphlet she hands him.
Harry Potter is immensely annoying, like a bee buzzing around his ear that keeps coming back for the proverbial honey. He’s there, constantly drawing Draco’s attention from whatever he was previously focusing on to him and those bothersome dimples. He screws with his head, his focus, and worse of all, Draco lets him.
The watch on his hand ticks disapprovingly at this suggested new adventure. It was 4:50 already, and the boys will be wondering where they were off to if they’re not back by five. Draco took punctuality very, very seriously.
Draco gingerly takes the flowers with unsteady fingers. They were beautiful—a bushel of cherry blossoms blooming in the palms of his hands. The vivid pink hue is an unexpected drop of color in his grey day.
Draco scowls at the suggestion. “What? No!” Yet he’s backing up, falling onto the soft, pillow-stacked bed with Harry falling on top of him, pinning him down like a beautiful, victorious predator. Harry raises his brows, dimples gleaming under the warm yellow light and he has to swallow two times before he admits, “Maybe a little.”
Draco steps back, wincing as the young woman with her hair in a tight, low bun, snaps at her rowdy group of children to fall in line and shut up. Merlin, Draco wasn’t too fond of children either, but that seemed a bit harsh. And that’s coming from someone who went to Hogwarts for goodness sake.
He hardly pays attention to the Transfigure lesson and instead watches Malfoy from the corner of his eye until class is dismissed. Harry stays back, purposefully matching Malfoy’s slow pace in getting his bookbag and things together. Most of the class is gone when Professor McGonagall clears her throat.
“This is bad. This is really, really bad,” Ron says. Harry looks next to him and sees him wipe his sweaty forehead with the back of his freckled hand. “We
No one is supposed to be this aware of their own breathing. But Draco is, and he misses Hermione’s question as a result.
He rolls his eyes. Those two were thick as thieves and constantly had secret gossiping sessions that he was never invited to.
Pink lips form the shape of his name again and Draco wants nothing more for him to say it. He leans as close as he dares, waiting for something, anything.
Draco decides to do right by him. Since he took so much time out of his very busy schedule in Azkaban to write Draco back, he decides not to
Finally, Harry couldn’t take it anymore. He hated Malfoy, sure, but he didn’t want him to suffer like this.
“Yeah, I know,” Harry snorts. “A list that has things like, ‘don’t cast Glamour spells the first day of the Spring Equinox, don’t overexert your magical core with transfiguration spells on a Blue Moon, and any hexes you cast will be strongest between the civil twilight period and nautical twilight period? Don’t eat food off your lap when it’s daytime?’” His face twists in bewilderment at the last one.
Potter studies him for a quiet moment before conceding to his plea. “Alright. Just know that you ever find yourself in a bind, you don’t have to suffer alone. I’ve had my fair share of sour dates.”
Draco smiles at him, a hint of shyness in his face. “Good morning,” his breath his minty, though with the same traces of sweetness to it as always.
The owl blinks at him with bored, yellow eyes as he ties the envelope back into her leg. She must be awfully exhausted, besides the letters he and Harry exchange daily, she also has to take the lesson plans Harry sends to him nearly every morning. Even though it’s Sunday, Harry still sends tomorrow’s lesson to him, the lines for his approval crisp and ready for his signature.
“Come on Draco, just look at your wall!” Harry gestures over to the twelve foot wall with parchment papers held up on it with sticking charms. There are so many papers stuck to the wall that it’s a bit of a shock remembering that underneath the rows of parchment, the wall was actually painted a gorgeous olive green color. His lists, including reminders about upcoming astronomical cycles and events, were plastered in meticulously neat rows. So he was a bit of a neat freak? That wasn’t too weird, right?
Draco gives him a faint smile, his watery grey eyes looking back to the steel door of the school entrance.
Potter lets out a soft snort. “That was awful Malfoy. Who knew you would succumb to telling Dad jokes?”
Harry and Ron jump in surprise from being caught mid-conversation. Harry’s eyes flit over to the seat where Malfoy once was. How did he get over here without making a sound?
He clears his throat. “Maybe I would if I wanted to recall just how ridiculously posh one person can be.”
a tall white guy.” He peeks into the room and from what he sees, there was no shortage of tall white blokes around.
She puts a hand on his sleeve, not knowing she was edging dangerously close to his Mark. “You shouldn’t worry yourself. Your son is a lovely addition to our class this year. He’s wonderfully bright and such a sweetheart.” She lowers her voice, “And I’d say he’s doing us all a favor in passing on some manners to that little devil he’s playing with.” She winks coyly at him.
Harry takes his hand, but instead of shaking it, he kisses his palm and closes his fingers over it, securing his kiss like an amulet. “Deal.”
Scorpius ends up bringing a telescope from Draco’s study. It was by far the coolest object they had in the house and Draco took an hour casting protection charm after protection charm to keep anything from happening to it. Every astronomer needs a good telescope, and this one could beat out most of the competition. He had to be six feet under before he let a single grubby hand mess it up.
That bittersweet feeling is lost when Astoria is standing in front of him again and all that is left in its wake is unrequited bitterness.
“Well now you’re here and you know that I’m not dead. So, goodbye.” One hand appears from under the blanket and he waves it dismissively as if he was shooing away a pesky house elf.
Draco manages to take a shaky breath and begins a list in his mind of every time he bested Potter in school in an attempt to calm his nerves. It’s a bit disheartening because the list is pitifully short.
Hermione bugged him about it the entire rest of the day. While they were at Zonkos, Honeydukes, the Shrieking Shack, walking through the town, and she even continued talking about it while walking across Hogwarts grounds.
He wrote the same words etched onto the back of his hand over and over for half an hour, clenching his hand to try and relieve any of the burning pain the scratching of the quill caused him. He was determined not to show the bitch how much it was bothering him and the  few times he ended up dropping the quill by accident or it cut particularly deep and he hissed, she would just look up smiling sweetly and say "is something wrong Mr Potter?"
They started walking towards the door of the house and Harry followed. As soon as he got inside he was ambushed in a large tight hug from Ms Weasley.
"Sorry Harry it's good to see you but I have to do this. What was the first animal I brought into your Defense against the Dark Arts class"
He shook himself, got up, and headed into the washroom. He splashed his face, and hand, with some water and braced himself on the sink. He couldn't let himself believe that this is something that was real. It's easier if he pretends it doesn't mean anything even though in his opinion it definitely meant something. He shook his head, took a deep breath, and went back to bed to dream of cold grey eyes and growling voices.
"It makes me look a little peaky I think. Best to change it." She screwed up her face in concentration and then, Pop, her hair turned a brilliant shade of bubblegum pink.
I’m sorry I’ve been so inactive lately, but I’m just not really feeling this fic anymore. It’s not getting too much attention on here anyways but I figured that any readers who do check in on this fic should know that I’m not planning on continuing it. I might of course but I’m just not vibing with it anymore. We’ll see what happens in the future but until then consider this fic abandoned.
Harry was feeling pretty proud of himself for that while looking at Dracos shocked face...until he was suddenly being slammed against the wall by the older blonde, That shook his confidence pretty quickly.
Fudge looked distinctly unhappy about Dumbledores arrival but didn't say anything. Then he asked for Harry's account of what happened.
Eventually. It came time for the Jury to decide his fate. He couldn't be expelled right? He had done the right thing hadn't he? He waited with baited breath as the minister and his people talked quietly amongst each other.
Ron had a look on his face that told Harry he thought he was going bonkers and Hermione looked a tad concerned, as though he was babbling nonsense. Just then a small airy voice drifted up from the side of the carriage.
They got off the train and waited in line for a carriage. They ended up a few people behind Malfoy and so Harry spent that wait sneakily taking in every inch of his body. He looked lean and fit, probably from quidditch like himself, and he was tall, about the same height as Harry. Maybe a bit taller. He would be nice to fuck. Harry decided he wouldn't let himself think of anything more. Malfoy would be good for a quick fuck and nothing else.
And then before he knew it. Everyone else was partnered up. And he was alone. At first he was relived but a bit annoyed he'd have to work alone as the project was sure to be hard, That is until Snape narrowed in on him
Harry responded with ease. He relished  the year he had with Professor Lupin as his DADA teacher. However. He was less keen on his year with Professor Moody, who was coincidentally standing right in front of him.
He sprinted down to the DADA office and burst in panting a quick "sorry I'm late sorry I forgot".  Umbridge sent him a stern look and said "you'll get detention next week as well Mr Potter"  he just nodded and sat down in his seat, picking up the quill with trepidation, and starting to write his lines. The now familiar, but still painful prick of the words on his hand started and soon enough the scars on his left hand reading "I must not tell lies" were reopened and oozing blood.
After about two hours in Harry's mind they started their decent. They spiralled down onto a grassy park across from what looked like a muggle housing development.
"Very well then" Fudge said "I hereby clear Harry James Potter of any and all charges placed on him by this court of law"
Harry woke up the next morning feeling a bit more refreshed then normal, the bed here was much softer then the Dursley's, but the numbness was still there. It pressed on his chest like something passively sitting there. He ignored it.
Harry shook his head and scolded himself for even thinking that. To distract himself until Malfoy went away, he turned away and dug his nails into his palm under his cloak.
"Come on, quickly now, you need to eat well before you leave. Stressful things those trials don't know why they would put a child through it" Ms Weasley ranted.
"Ya, just Malfoy's bloody annoying. Why's he have to go after us like that every year?"  Harry grumbled.
Harry was getting more and more angry by the second. First, he gets in trouble for saving his no good cousin, and then he's best friends kept secrets from him?
The class went on without much happening although Harry still spent most of the time wondering where the heck Draco was. It bothered him that he didn't know. Damn it, he hated how much this boy could get to him. However. Harry was so busy kicking himself for caring so much about Draco that he didn't realize until too late that Snape was telling them to set into partners for a project they would be starting next lesson. He glanced over at Ron hopefully but he just smiled back meekly and pointed at Hermione who shrugged.
As they both processed they kissed some more and then spent hours talking, figuring out the other really wasn't all that bad away from prying eyes. After that night the library became their meeting spot. Sneaking around to find eachother and press hungry kisses to the others mouths.
Bad dreams, where Draco teased and ridiculed him, he preferred these ones as he knew they were the most probable; Wet dreams, where Draco seduced him and they spent all day in bed in bliss, these ones he begrudgingly welcomed even though he'd wake up from them with a hard-on and an uncomfortable feeling in the back of his mouth; But the ones he despised the most were the good dreams.
After averting his gaze several times, Harry gave up and decided to just give in and stare at the perfect boy across the hall from him. He let his eyes roam around the parts of the boys body he could see and was just thinking about how much he would like to find himself in a dark deserted corridor with him, when food suddenly appeared on the table in front of him.
"Don't worry, I see them too. I have since my first year. Your just as sane as I am" A blond Ravenclaw said, looking up from her book. She was so quiet that he hadn't even realized she was there until now.
They both stared at eachother and Draco mutters "fuck it" before leaning in again to kiss Harry, gentler this time. When they broke apart Harry swallows and whispers* I feel the same way about you Draco.
Harry vaguely heard Ron say something along the lines of "I'm gonna kill him" and Hermione asking if he was alright. He just nodded, took a long sip of his butterbeer, and started talking about how Umbridge better teach them something soon or their all going to fail their OWL's. That's when Hermione got a nervous look on her face.
Harry looked around the courtroom and took in his surroundings. In front of him was a very tall raised platform where several people were sitting, and behind him was a ring of seats for what he supposed were spectators, of which there were none thankfully. The Minister For Magic, Cornelius Fudge, who was sitting on the raised platform at the very front, welcomed him and began listing off his charges and the people around him.
After a bit of waiting the brim of the dirty old hat that had been sitting on the stool ripped open and started singing a song. Harry tried to concentrate on what it was saying, he really did, but his attention kept wavering and he found his eyes wandering over to a specific blonde across the hall a few times.
"Well it sure looked like it? If no one did it then-" a look of understanding dawns on his face and he sneers weakly "figures the chosen one would harm himself. What, looking for attention on famous potter? And it's Malfoy to you"
"Woah woah woah Hermione calm down. I forgot I had detention with Umbridge for talking about Voldemort and she made me stay late because of it."  He shrugged, wincing involuntarily when it made his still throbbing hand burn with heat. Hermione was on him in an instant.
He for some reason hadn't gotten into too much trouble at the Dursley's, Aunt Petunia has miraculously defended him after receiving a strange howler.
Once he took the badge the bottom of the telephone box started moving down like an elevator until he could see the shining floors and grand entrance hall of the Ministry.
"It seems that your court hearing has been moved up a bit. We only have 5 minutes to get there." Mr Weasley said nervously.
His next hated class was obvious. Potions. He hated it for two very good reasons. The first one was very obvious, Professor Snape was kind of a dick. But the second was less obvious,at least he hoped it was. His second reason for hating Potions was that every single time he walked in that goddamn room his heart stopped. Because every single time, there was Draco, Harry had decided that since the crush wasn't going away he might as well call him by his first name, sitting right there already pulling out his notes and supplies. He was infuriatingly handsome and Harry hated it. How the hell was he supposed to get any good work done when that infuriating blonde masterpiece was sitting across the room from him! And two tables down too so of course Harry had a unobstructed view of his perfect arse which he frequently got distracted by no matter how hard he tried. And just his luck. He had potions next.
"Harry. The order thinks that there's something out there that Voldemort is looking for. Something he didn't have last time. We're not sure what it is but we think it's in the ministry." He explained. "Unfortunately that's all I can tell you right now Harry." He said with a sad smile.
He refused to let himself dwell on the impossible and threw himself into the DA. He made lesson plans, did private lessons, talked with Hermione and Ron, even as Umbridge's ridiculous decrees piled up and up and up. Winter break passed in a blur of colour and presents Harry appreciated but didn't remember.
Hermione must have caught the look crossing Harry's face because she quickly said "We're sorry we didn't tell you about it. Dumbledore forbid us to say anything in case someone intercept something"
Harry nodded and winced. Fortunately he was saved more embarrassment by the bell, at which he rushed straight up to his dorm, Grabbed the first sharp thing he could find and ripped at his arm. The blood gushed out in small torrents to the best of his heart as he breathed a sigh of relief. It always felt better after he cut sometimes. He watched the blood pulse out of the would for a few more seconds before closing it up and cleaning up the blood with the wave of his wand.
The next morning Harry woke up around noon and went down for a late brunch that Ms Weasley had made up, and then went straight back upstairs to pack up his trunk.
"Harry you have to be up nice and early tomorrow to get to the ministry. Molly will make sure to have a good breakfast ready for you."
Harry was frozen in disbelief, because standing in front of him was his former Defense Against The Arts teacher. Remus Lupin was standing in front of him with a small smile.
Harry didn't ask anymore and eventually found himself out on the Dursley's back lawn, pushing off into the night sky on his firebolt.
Well Harry thought that's one way to get him out of my head. And promptly fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow.
His meetings with Draco got less frequent as he was studious as well and he found himself thinking Draco and Hermione would get along.
Harry looked over at Percy hoping to see some flicker of recognition, but he was already bent over his parchment writing furiously.
His vices weren't enough and his mind too small to handle the things he needed to keep hidden. He couldn't sleep well or eat well, sit still or move, be truly happy or productive. He was a mess. And it only got worse after Umbridge forced Dumbledore out of office.
Harry is pissed at Draco and says things that end up with him being pined against a wall. Read on to see if it’s good or bad.
Over the course of a lifetime Harry would find out the answer to that question, but for now he was contented to lay with Draco underneath the stars in the highest tower in Hogwarts for a night of peace and quiet that, unknowingly to Harry, would be broken quite soon, in an irreparable way.
He tried everything to get him off his mind, including more cutting but curiously, he just couldn't make himself do it much after remembering Draco's worried face that day in the washroom. It haunted him.
Today he choose a spot on his abdomen and sliced it open watching the blood lazily bead up and roll down his stomach, staining his skin red. After a minute or so of watching it he cleaned it up and cast a spell he’d learned in the library to close it without a scar.
Harry, feeling incredibly nervous, walked through the door and descended down the grimly lit staircase into the waiting area of the court room.
That's when he noticed the sheer amount of people that jumped at that. There was a short wizard, a thin witch, Lupin, Moody, and a young witch with purple hair.
Harry didn't think he'd ever smiled this wide. But. He didn't think he was as happy as he should be. Still he walked out with Dumbledore looking happy and he went home with Mr Weasley and told everyone the happy news and celebrated with them. He was glad that that weight was off his shoulders but there was something more, pressing, on his mind.
, he wants to add, but Scorpius’ bright laugh from inside the nurses’ room reminds him not to be short with the father of his new best friend.
Draco sinks into his chair, feeling no older than thirteen as he pouts angrily in his seat over Harry Potter.
Those willing to go through with this exercise with him have described it like being in a building with a weak foundation or those moments after Apparating where nothing feels quite right.
“My house,” Draco says. He really didn’t want to accidentally run into Ginevra nor was he particularly enthused to go back into the same house he had a breakdown in. Further, he wasn’t sure he was entirely comfortable having Scorpius in Potter’s house, even if Draco would be right there with him.
“I… I know.” She quickly brushes away something from her face. A tear, he thinks. “I haven’t felt like myself for years. I know it’s not a good enough excuse but it’s all I have. I wish I would have done more too. But you have to believe me when I say that some days I physically couldn’t.” Her chin wrinkles, quivering along with the twitching veins under her wet eyes.
He grits his teeth and instantly regrets it, cradling his sore jaw in his hands. “What did I do? You should be concerned about what he did! He was hexing me for the last five minutes of the game, he could have seriously injured me!”
Harry snorts, “Yeah? Well why don’t you try learning new things with three—” He coughs guilty. “Er, nevermind.” He pops another sushi roll in his mouth, this time disregarding both the chopsticks and fork completely and popping it into his mouth with his hands.
, Hermione told him. So he grips onto Harry’s hand because he’s real, wonderfully so. He doesn’t miss Hermione’s nod of approval.
Draco internally rolls his eyes. As if he’ll risk outing himself to the Daily Prophet about his not so salacious affair with Harry Potter, his son’s presumed straight teacher, and his former arch-nemesis.
The words hit him like a slap across the face. That’s what it was! No wonder why he felt like he was going to crawl out his skin. Granted, he still should probably take those potions, but nevermind that. St. Mungos was bound to see an uptick of hospital cases from wizards and witches performing simple heating and cooling charms.
Draco tosses them their amulets carelessly in the air, trying not to give too much thought about it when Harry grins widely at the sight. Ugh, this does
His hands wrap around his glass of wine, swirling around the Merlot in the bowl. “Well, I guess because it's the one thing everyone else takes for granted.” He smiles, though nothing he was about to say was worth smiling over. Sitting up on the domes of his knees he excitedly states, “For example, did you know in about 3.5 billion years, the Sun will die? Nothing can stop it from happening either. Then there’s always the chance that the Earth could be swallowed in a black hole. Meteorites come close to Earth’s atmosphere nearly once a year, yet no one makes a big fuss over it. Yet all it takes is a big enough meteor coming into Earth’s gravitational pull and
A foreign owl bangs against the window, ruffling its feathers out and scratching at the stainless window with its talons. Growling, he moves to grab the letter before the peckish creature damages his windows. He flips it a treat, grateful that it doesn’t demand for a written letter back.
“I'm serious,” Harry protests. “If he can’t see how great you always were then that’s his loss, not yours.” Really, Malfoy wasn’t the easiest person to get along with but once you got to know him, it was hard
He nods, laughing a little under his breath. “It was, but honestly, looking back on it, it was the best thing that could have happened. Had I not failed I would have never known that I was dealing with PTSD.” Draco feels something sink uncomfortably in his stomach. Possibly, it was his swallowed pride. Harry tsks softly. “I would have never gone to see a Mind Healer, or think to work in Muggle London. I would have never started working with children as part of my therapy, never became a teacher and be here with you.”
His own hands settle into the curves of Draco’s waist. For a moment, Harry was actually glad that he didn’t want to have sex tonight. He didn’t get many opportunities to just hold him and enjoy his presence like he could do currently. Sex would come, but for now, Harry was content with just being with Draco.
He lifts his chin. “I’m here, okay? I’m here if you… if you need anything.” He knows that he can’t fix her, but he doesn’t have to push her away either. He meant what he had said in France. He wants to share custody one day, and more than anything, he doesn’t want to see her suffer.
“Really?” Harry asks, rolling his eyes. Draco always refused to kiss him in the morning unless Harry cleaned his mouth beforehand. It was dreadfully annoying but it was one of his quirks that he had come to like.
needs that had to be addressed. Needs that were currently straining against the leg of his trouser pants.
“I didn’t know that it’ll—” He stops himself, choking on the familiarity of his words. He can almost hear Malfoy’s purring tone taunting him.
He cranes his head up, his braid dangling in between his eyes. “The stars look better from this angle. Prettier.”
Though, when Harry nuzzles his chest and wraps his arms around Draco’s midsection, he’s beginning to reconsider just how much he actually minds if Harry fell asleep right here. He could get used to this; lying in the sun with Harry’s inky black hair tickling his cheek, the distinguishable scent of sweat, sex, and woods filling his nostrils with each inhale.
Groaning, Draco buries his head in his hands, his spaghetti temporarily forgotten. “Oh good Merlin…Scorpius, I am an
Draco opens his mouth. Closes it. But nothing, that’s what. Harry had been honest with him, far more than Draco could ever be with his own Mind Healer years ago. More than he dared to be with himself at times.
“What a complete load of bollocks,” Draco mutters to himself. He throws the crumpled paper onto the table and drains the last bit of pomegranate tea in his porcelain. A note that was to be owled to Pansy this morning gets shoved off to the side. “Are you ready to go Scorpius?”
Harry’s breathing steadies, and for a moment, Draco’s nervous that Harry may fall asleep on top of him like this. He wouldn’t mind if they weren’t on top of Harry’s desk and in the middle of a children’s classroom with their cocks out.
,” the bird says in Astoria’s airy accent. It hops down from the marble counter, fluttering down in a whirl of silvery mist. “
“But I’m okay now.” More than okay, actually. “You have to accept the reality.” He presses a kiss against his own scar, peeking out from underneath his fringe. “Besides, I thought we agreed that we loved the reality more than any fantasy?”
at the end of class and dashes out the door, waiting on the tips of his toes outside of the classroom for Malfoy to finish dogging Snape with questions. Ron finds Hermione and the two stand off in a secluded corner, their faces etched with concern as they discuss whatever it is the two talk about these days.
Draco sits up straight like an arrow, his migraine pounding from the sudden movements but somehow that seemed insignificant to the real issue at hand.
Scorpius wisely snaps his mouth shut, though he gives him a nasty glare as Draco tugs him through the halls to Potter and Ana’s classrooms.
Draco’s mouth parts in shock. So it wasn’t such a long story at all. “Oh,” is all he can say as he attempts to gather his bearings. “Um, no I haven’t.” He raises a cautious brow, not knowing whether it was appropriate to make a quip, but deciding to do so anyway. “So… like you then?”
Draco sucked the rest of it off of his finger slowly, releasing the digit with a satisfying pop as Harry watched with hooded eyes.
She also looked exceedingly young, like she had just graduated from Hogwarts. So young, that he reckons that she had no idea about his family’s history.
Harry gives him a small, teasing smile which Malfoy returns with a scowl. “Oh, since when did Saint Potter become an expert on the cisgender female anatomy?” He asks, his voice dripping in sarcasm.
He flips the pamphlet over so that it’s only the blue background that he sees. First, he was going to learn how to cook something other than spaghetti.
“Why? Because it’s mean?” Scorpius snickers triumphantly as he skips onto the first steps of the staircase. That little… “You also said that it looked like he couldn’t get it up if you held it on a string but I don’t know what that means. But I heard enough to know that you can be mean.”
“They’re yours—how can I not love them?” He places Harry’s hand on the longest one. It started at the bottom of his left rib cage and extended to the curve of his shoulder. Had there not been enough Dittany available, he would have scars on his face too. And over time he would have loved them, just as much as he loves the ones on his chest. If Harry just looks at them from a different angle, maybe he would understand why. “All of this,” he leads his fingers down the scar, “is yours. All of me is for you.”
Ron places his necklace on, his face morphing into pleasure when the hanging amulet glows pink. “Is it normal for it to make you feel good like this?”
Harry’s hands fly to the buttons of Draco’s shirt and he knows it was taking every inch of self-control to not rip the things off. Draco does him a solid and Vanishes his shirt.
“Honest. Right. I guess if we’re being honest I have to admit that I wasn’t as truthful with you as I could have been before.” He lowers his eyes. “Being honest is actually hell.”
Call it petty, but he was enjoying having the height advantage over him for once in his life and he doesn’t see why he can’t enjoy it again tonight of all nights.
Baby steps. He would suggest meeting one Weasley at a time, but he may reach 50 before they’re done.
She’s raging of course, but Draco thinks he may have been onto something. They have to return to Harry’s house three times over after Albus claims that he forgot another something—his toothbrush, his favorite family photo, his wand. Ginny threatens to send a Howler during his first breakfast at school if he screams about needing another thing from the house.
the bloke on sight. “I only ever saw him date girls and he only seemed even slightly attracted to me now that I’m stuck as one,” Malfoy says bitterly. “I bet he’ll go right back to hating me once I’m a male again.”
side of the bed for both of their sakes—and crotches. “Here, I’ll go downstairs and get you some tea.” He looks at the small purple bruise forming on the back of his arm and tuts sympathetically. “And maybe some ice.”
He’s so tired that he could sleep for an entire moon cycle but seeing Harry’s face as he drops to his knees and unbuckles the front of his straining trousers is worth the missed sleep.
Exhausted, Draco looks at him with puffy eyes and a red face. He was openly crying and yet Potter’s face is still more expressive than anyone he knows. It was like reading a book: Harry Potter and the Not-So-Subtle Expressions He Makes.
is nothing like the Manor. There’s history here, though not in the same pretentious fashion as the Manor’s portraits glaring down from the walls and the fancy antiques that mean virtually nothing when there are a hundred more just as valuable items in a single room. No, this history is different. Draco can see it in the walls, the chipped paint on the house, the tree trunk littered with tic marks and corresponding names engraved in the bark. He can taste April in the air, intertwined with the sweet Chamomile flowers planted neatly along the sides of the home.
Furrowing his brows, Draco wonders what it was that Scorpius could ask that would prompt Draco to get mad at him. Maybe it was a question about Astoria. Those questions never made him mad per se, just furious at her and the past. But not him, never Scorpius himself for inquiring about his mother.
“—with me,” Malfoy finishes. They both stare at each other with wide eyes before Malfoy begins to laugh brightly at his eagerness and Harry flushes all over again. “I must say that I appreciate your willingness.”
He’s just explaining the premise of his experiment and the vibrations of their wands when the conference doors slam open.
After several moments of chewing the inside of her cheek and huffing, she finally gives in. “Fine. But if this behavior continues into the Sunday dinner, best believe me and that young man will have a long talk.” She turns, her eyes focusing on something at the side of the couch. “Oh and Harry?”
Malfoy opens his mouth to fire a retort back, the word ‘idiot’ ready to slide off his tongue when Ron shouts from down the hallway.
Draco kisses his cheek sweetly. “I’m certainly not opposed to that.” His warm lips press small kisses down his cheek until he reaches his mouth.
Snorting, he says, “How could I be? We’ve always wanted the best for each other. And if this was the best, then so be it. I won’t deny that I miss the comfort, but I like to think there’s value in going outside of your comfort zone.” He looks directly at Draco as he says this.
“Don’t flatter yourself,” he snips, “it’s…it's been a while.” Heat rushes to his already pink face and he turns his lips up in contempt. He hasn’t had a blowjob since school, but he’s not going to ruin the moment by telling Harry that. “Besides, I just want you to fuck me Potter, unless cocksucking is the only thing you’re good at.”
Between the hate staring and the staring at his arse, Draco’s probably accumulated more than a dozen odd looks from parents and children. They never stare at Potter like that though. Even when he stares back at him. No, they don’t see the expression Potter reserved only for him, the one when his face tightened to a point that looks painful, eyes narrowing into slits, his mouth thinning like glass in distrust.
Harry pulls away from him, gripping him by the shoulders. “Nothing. Don’t blame yourself for others' misconceptions about you. I’ve seen your work Draco—you’re brilliant.”
Harry is far too overdressed. Internally he’s wondering how best to ask a man to take off his trousers and pants when Harry hastily discards his lower clothing with two quick tugs, his cock jutting out when he yanks his pants down.
“Isn’t this dangerous anyway? Sending kids out onto the streets and asking strangers to buy food from them?” He swore that this had to be breaking at least three Muggle laws. “Potter’s trying to get tiny children kidnapped!”
The kids give a half-hearted applause when Kacia finishes her twenty minute long, one-sided discussion about her cupcake shop and Draco sees some parents jostle awake when Ana finally pulls her from the front of the classroom and thanks all of the parents for their participation. The kids exchange exhausted looks with each other when Kacia jumps up and tells them that she brought cupcakes for them all.
“Side effect?” Her eyes grow wide and she laughs, loud and hollow. He winces. “Sure Potter, I'll give you the password.”
“Hush! People are staring!” Draco narrows his eyes in warning. Knowing Scorpius, his son is just enough of a nutter to start screaming that he was being kidnapped just to mess with him.
Draco scowls. “Hey, don’t you worry about that. We’ll find you something great to bring, you’ll see.” He bends down, making sure that he and Scorpius were at a similar eye level and cups his chin in his hand. “I promise Scorpius. You know I don’t break my promises.” It’s a dangerous thing to say to a child, especially a child who's been severely disappointed before, but Draco was willing to take a few risks for him.
Draco rolls his eyes good-naturedly. “Not true. Don’t listen to Scorpius, I can make a mean pitcher of water.” Merlin. He knows he’s probably going to burn these damn eggs.
The children are sluggish, subdued from a full day of learning and playing. Most of them are either Scorpius’ age or younger and Draco realizes just how much he’s missed having a five year old tugging on his trouser leg and asking him to play. They’re surprisingly docile too, having been to afterschool long enough to know better than to cause mischief. One little girl with chubby cheeks and neat cornrows down her back especially tugs at his heartstrings when she politely asks him in a tiny voice if he can open her bottle of orange juice for her.
“I hate obligations and I hate my father. Though if I had to choose, I think sometimes I hate myself the most. Sometimes. Please don’t take that statement for more than it’s worth.”
Harry stared blankly at Hermione. She had just finished proposing to him that they make their own group to learn Defense. At first he thought it was a great idea, until she asked if he would run it.
Harry agreed and with that he sits down with Draco and they quickly dissolve into easy conversation and laughter in between which they eat and Draco points out constellations he'd learned by heart as well as playfully naming a greenish planet he found with the telescope "Harry"
Despite Draco's obvious intent the words came out softer then he meant them to, still laced with concern and his hand still tight around Harry's arm. Harry reluctantly pulled back. "I'm find Malfoy. Leave me alone."
But Harry was hardly listening. No matter how hard he tried to get it out of his head he just couldn't stop thinking about the way Malfoys hair had looked, or how his grey eyes were like storm clouds.
And so it went on like this for the rest of the week. Then the next. And then finally, two days before they had to leave for Hogwarts, he finally just did it. After dessert had been set on the table, Harry stood up and said quickly
After that everything went downhill. He was constantly worrying, writing letters to Sirius and Remus day and night and needing to know they were alive and well and what was going on with Dumbledore and having to word it just right so that Umbridge couldn't identify anything from reading his letters. He couldn't focus in class, the DA took up too much of his time, his sanity was cracked, and his grades were falling rapidly, which is how he found himself in the library at 7pm on a Saturday night with a pile of books and parchment in front of him, preparing to tackle his giant mountain of homework.
In fact it almost felt. Good. Like a release. Harry stood there for a few seconds marvelling at how it felt and then cleaned himself up and went back to chopping the potatoes.
Harry woke up bright and early the day they had to go to Kings Cross. He was still one of the last ones to wake up though.
She asked countless questions, starting to tag along to the library and and subtly tried to get things out of him but he held fast. Eventually she lost interest and forced him to focus on the upcoming O.W.L.S.
The Dursley's had gone out for the day and he wasn't to do anything, not that he was planning on it anyways, when he heard something downstairs. A few thuds were emanating from the kitchen below and if Harry strained his ears hard enough he could hear low whispers. He knew he should be concerned, but he just couldn't bring himself to care. The Dursley's couldn't possibly blame him for it because he was locked in his room. Except, Now he wasn't. He had just heard the lock click into the unlocked position.
"No, no there something pulling it this year, look! He pointed out the window, "they're right there!"
Suddenly his eyes settle on a boy who's off in the corner talking to some others, he wasn't sure who it is but he sure was good looking, even from the back Harry could tell that he had a toned figure and he could definitely see he had a nice ass even through the robes he was wearing.
Draco grabs his arm. "No, tell me what the fuck just happened, I come in here and find you calmly staring at a bleeding wound so I think I deserve an explanation"
He stumbled a bit but regained his balance as Hermione called "Harry! Ron, Ron Harry's here! He's here!"
During Transfiguration, their first class of the day, Hermione sat next to him and handed him a protein bar as she had every day that week. She had obviously noticed him picking at his food at every meal (he wasn't hungry plus why would he eat when he could look at Draco Malfoy from across the room!) and had made up her mind to do something about it even though Harry had shut her down when she tried to mention it. He just took the protein bar and took a bite more out of respect then out of hunger.
Soon enough they were at the school sitting down at their House Tables getting ready to see The Sorting. While they were waiting though Harry happened to glance up at the staff table and noticed a short, stout, vaguely toad like woman wearing all pink.
"Whats wrong Harry?" She asked rushing over to him. He tried to wriggle away from her. "Nothing Hermione. Nothings wrong."  Hermione didn't listen and continued examining him "nonsense I saw you flinch something must be- HARRY WHAT IS THIS?!"  He winced as she found his hand and grabbed it. He immediately pulled it away as just having her touch it was excruciating.
As soon as Hermione let go of him he went quietly up to his dorm. As much as he loved Hermione she could be a bit much sometimes. And all he wanted to do right now was take some time to himself to let the fake smile fall off his face and relax. He was having a bad day, usually the numbness took over and Harry was happy to let it do that so he didn’t have to feel the sad, but today it hasn’t leaving Harry to survive all day with bone crushing sadness weighing him down like a 1000 pound weight over his head. So Harry went and did the only thing he knew how to do on days like these to make it easier.
