“Shall I read you a book?” Harry asked, pulling the chair a bit away from the couch, so that they could both see the fire.
“He doesn’t know half of it.”
. . .”  He took a shuddering breath, and then another.
Over the following year, Malfoy didn’t get any easier to work with.  He was always sullen whenever Harry went to him for help and sneered just as much as he always had.  But he always did help, and he never charged, and usually he was able to give some useful information within a few days at the very most.
Malfoy blinked.  “Really?” he asked.  “I’ve gone to the trouble of creating an absolutely brilliant solution to all your problems, and what makes you curious is the colour?”
“Do you know me at all?  Have I become a complete sad sack?  Don’t answer that.”  Draco made a snorting sound.  “Not verbally spar,” he said under his breath.  “What else do you think I’ve got left?”
“Why?” Harry said, because he couldn’t really believe it.
Harry could feel tears behind his eyes, but he didn’t know why they were even there, so he didn’t let them out.  He was very good at not crying.  No one liked a crier—except for how Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia seemed to like Dudley.  But that was different.  Harry nodded.
“Last time I checked.” Kavika sipped her coffee. “But you can be whoever you’d like to be.”
Sometimes Draco was weird, because who even said the word ‘shan’t’?  But as Harry watched him shuffle he remembered his question.  “Why aren’t you married?”
“Can I have one?” asked a rotund person, with pretty curly hair.
Harry groaned. “I—don’t know—if I—can. ‘M so—hot.” But he tried to go slow, loosening his grip, running it up his aching prick. He shuddered.
Astoria turned to look at him, her green eyes cold as frosted grass. “Rune didn’t break up with Draco. Draco broke up with him.” Her voice was a little sharp—it often was, with him. Harry had always assumed it was just because they had never really spent much time talking. For the first time, he began to wonder why. “And it didn’t happen in August. It happened right after he advanced to Level Two. The morning after, in fact—when he should have still been celebrating.”
“You can keep it in your mouth.” Draco’s voice was soft. “I just want to make sure you hear this. Do you understand?”
“Peter Pettigrew killed Cedric,” Harry said.  “It happened before your father got there.”
“So good.” Thumping down her wand, she folded her hands and pinned Harry with a wide smile.
Harry shook his head.
“What’s confidential?”
“Malfoy,” Harry called. “Get to it.”
After chewing a bit more, Harry finally managed to swallow.  “I thought you said old-me said he couldn’t trust people there.”
“You’re an Auror.”
“You think all the Aurors who helped Voldemort in the puppet regime were under Imperius?”
Fortunately, Malfoy shone on all the portions of the course that dealt with theory or procedure. If assigned to write essays on a curse, or delineate the process by which an Auror would break one, Malfoy surpassed the rest of the class, which meant that so far he was doing well enough to be near the top.
“So, Draco Malfoy didn’t actually make nosy trainees much worse?” said Yin.
“So all that about—about wanting to stop Death Eaters, and hatred, and violence—here you have a chance to do
“Yeah. It’s terrible.” Teddy looked even more concerned. “Are you all right?”
Instead, Harry had to deal with Mrs. Mulpepper, who abruptly burst into tears when she learned he was looking for Malfoy.
Harry felt like he should tell him to wait, but he didn’t know. He didn’t know what he felt. What if that one therapist had been right? What if there was a
“He should be trivialized.” Bennet.
“I depress myself. Smoothie?”
“Nothing wrong with a fox.”
“What?” Harry asked, having become rather mesmerized by the repetition of Malfoy’s bony fingers untying lace after lace.
“Harry Potter!” Alby said, bustling forward.
.  I’ve seen people
“You won’t be either,” Draco said.  “I’m sure you’ll find a very beautiful wife and have plenty of very handsome babies.”  Slowly, his stack finally in order, Draco played another card.
Harry’s grown-up body wasn’t short.  It wasn’t taller than Draco either, but it was wider, the shoulders and chest broader.  It wasn’t big like Arnold Schwarzenegger was big—Uncle Vernon thought Arnold Schwarzenegger was tops—but he sort of looked like someone who could beat you up, if he wanted to.  That wasn’t the awful part, though.  The awful part was he looked like he
“There aren’t two separate worlds!” shouted another. “Your world, our world! There’s only one!”
“No?”  Harry was unsure where this obsession Malfoy had with being drunk came from.  “I was just going to say, since your birthday is at the beginning of June and mine is at the end of July, that means we get almost two whole months of in-between birthdays.  In fact, it’s our in-between birthday right now, which means—”
“It’s a terrorist organization,” Savage answered.
“You know what happened after the holiday party,” Harry said.
“And I don’t want to just keep
“I’m not talking about Malfoy, obviously,” Luna went on.
Harry squirmed out of his grasp.  “Do you mean Granger and Weasley?”
“Poor little orphan Potty. If only you knew.”
Tentatively, Harry tried the chocolate.
His voice was light and normal, as though nothing had happened.  Harry didn’t understand.
“No, really,” Harry said. “I’m curious. Would you beg forgiveness in one moment, then champion your
“You’re right on that.”  Harry looked around at Draco’s sitting room.  The poor floral-print chair was sagging in the middle, over-stretched from too many enlargement spells, the little table beside it.  Not wanting to ruin the chair completely, Harry cast a Summoning spell for a sofa to come over from Grimmauld Place to use instead.  “Let’s have somewhere to sit, shall we?”
It was kind of nice, actually.
“Don’t sack him,” Harry said quickly.
“Right,” Harry agreed. “It’s just the way Spragg says it, it sounds like he thinks non-mags can’t think for themselves, and even though the whole point is he wants to protect non-mags, it begins to sound like the neo-purist. Sometimes, it’s easy to . . .”
“Fine. It’s not good enough for you? I’ll choose another.” Turning away, Malfoy took the stance again. “There,” he said, after a few moments. “I’ve got one.”
Draco stepped in, his movements so precise, just like Harry remembered.  “It’s still dark in this foyer.”  Taking out his wand, Draco pointed it at the ceiling.  “
” Draco said again, and more light crashed into an invisible shield.  “
Draco went pale.  His face changed.  “Take it away,” he said, but it wasn’t in a snarky voice.  His face wasn’t a sneer, either.  He was looking sick, actually.  “I mean it, Potter.  Take it away.”
“His Boggart?”
And another.
“I don’t like his ideas either.”
“Everything,” Teddy said.
Harry’s heart dropped.  “You mean—to grow me up?”
?  Do you like him more than me?”
“You bullied me,” Harry said. “You hurt me. You cut me off; you made me feel alone. You hurt people I loved.”
“No,” Harry said, but he had to move quickly to avoid another curse.
“Draco.”
“Draco is doing what he thinks best,” Andromeda said.  “It’s okay if you’re angry, but it isn’t fair to blame him.”
“I wouldn’t love a vampire koala,” Andromeda said.
Malfoy, who was beaming, nevertheless looked very startled to be so included, and nearly fluttered as Andromeda threw her arms around him.
Few things could have distracted Harry from the subject at hand, but the offer of magic did.
“I know I’m pleasant to look at,” came Malfoy’s laconic voice, “but did you have a potion you needed ID’ed, or not?”
Harry blinked. “He doesn’t.”
“Draco.” Harry put his hands on Draco’s shoulders, pulling him away, pushing him back on the bed. “Draco.” Harry moved down the bed, opening Draco’s shirt again. He put his mouth on one of the scars.
“Turn over,” Draco said, yanking on Harry’s hip. Harry turned over, and Draco grabbed the toy. “Get that thing away,” he said, tossing it on the floor, where it continued to thrust. Fumbling, Draco found his wand, then Banished it. Then he Banished his clothes. All of them.
Draco held on.  “Don’t ever do that.  Do you understand me?  Don’t ever do that.”
Harry remembered, the first day the hand-to-hand combat segment of the class began. Malfoy hadn’t just mastered all of the holds, but was sharing his experience with his partner, helping his partner correct the holds when they weren’t quite right.
The terrier shook its head. “How’s it looking there?”
“Who was that lady?  Who’s Cecil Vance?”
“He wouldn’t have done that if he didn’t love you?”
to tell anyone?” asked someone else.
“Yes.”
made heat zing up Harry’s spine.  These days Malfoy practically ignored Harry once Harry handed the potion over, except here Malfoy was standing too close and saying
to help . . . They’re
After several long minutes of Malfoy standing there, Harry just inside the door, Malfoy spoke.  “I just . . .” Trailing off, Malfoy turned around. His pink skin had gone pale, almost a sickly grey colour, though quite red about the eyes. Harry could see how tired he was, haggard lines about his face.
Harry wanted to say, but he ignored Malfoy, instead turning to the class. “I’m going to demonstrate a series of holds,” he said, “and then we’ll work on how to get someone into those holds. That way, you know where you want to get at the end of each bout. Okay, Malfoy,” Harry said, turning back to him. “Keep your body nice and loose for this.”
This year’s exam schedule was a little tight, due to Reveal. The Council was working on a vote of no confidence for Fudge, which—if passed—could mean another stay on Reveal to allow for a new Ministry and a new chance at the Deal. If, however, the vote didn’t pass, Reveal would happen on the date it was last scheduled, without a Deal. Since the Auror Department needed all the help it could get if Reveal happened without a Deal, graduation date for the Academy was being pushed up so new Aurors could immediately be certified and help out.
“I do,” Malfoy agreed. “I’m never going to. Never. Do you understand that?”
The Ministry held its holiday gala in early December so as many people as possible could attend before they began overseas Apparating for holiday travel, but the Auror holiday party was always close to Christmas. Harry was still invited to the Ministry gala; technically, his position as an Auror instructor made him adjunct to the Ministry, but he had stopped going years ago, despising the number of reporters and pure-blood “philanthropists” who thought he was there for their personal show.
“What happened with the books—that’s accidental magic.”  Mister Malfoy’s voice sounded gentler now.  “It happens when a magical child is scared, stressed, or hurt.  You’re saying that’s never happened to you before?”
“Yes, I am.” Malfoy straightened his posh robes, shoulders down now, looking more relaxed. “You don’t have to do anything, Potter. Like you said, you don’t owe me. I just wanted you to know.”
Harry skipped down the page.
“I wonder what form mine will take.  Not many people can cast full Patronuses, but my mum can.  Hers is a dragon.”
“You said I did magic.  Was it the books?”
Harry had slept so little that he found he needed the coffee, so he walked back out to go to one of the nearby cafés. He always went to La Reve these days, since he was pretty sure that was where Malfoy went, and Harry had since got used to it. The walk was nice, invigorating. When he came back, he passed through the green, by the Timothy Tree, where Malfoy always used to sit.
“But.”  Harry frowned.  “You said . . .”
Harry needn’t have worried. Ron was right; Teddy could take care of himself.
Finally letting go Harry’s hand, Draco began searching the desk in Savage’s cubicle, much as he had searched Harry’s.  After a few moments of this, he placed a piece of parchment on the desk with a quill on top.  Harry looked at the parchment, but it appeared blank.  Draco turned to Harry.  “Harry, may I have my wand?”
“Fuck,” Harry said. “You’re so good. You’re so good. You’re so—goddamn—good—” And he thrust inside Draco’s mouth; he couldn’t help it, and Draco moaned for it, eager on the floor like some kind of—well, like some kind of eager whore. “I’m going to,” Harry warned. “I’m gonna—I’m gonna—”
“Yes,” Yin said, because Harry had told them that almost straight after it had happened. “And you liked it. Is it safe to say you want him physically?”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to interrupt.” Malfoy’s eyes swept over Rune in a way that Harry recognized, because in his first year of Level One, Malfoy had looked that way at him all the time. Harry felt embarrassed that he hadn’t recognized it and embarrassed for Malfoy now that he did. “Please. Continue.”
“Most children your age have learned a bit more control.”  Mister Malfoy’s voice was still kind, even though he was saying Harry was bad.  Harry had heard that before, too.
“I’ve told you,” Alby said.  “Little lord Malfoy isn’t my business any more, and I’m glad to be rid of him.  He was more trouble than he was—”
Harry did as well, careful not to let his skin brush Malfoy’s, and then they were whirling away into the Ministry of Magic, leaving the sun to set over Pecket Well and the house at the end of North Dashberry Street, where a pretty little cottage sat in an weedy lawn.
Alby glared at him, rubbing his throat and glancing back at Draco.
“I’m fine where I am, thanks.”
He could touch Draco’s thighs—Draco’s lean, hard long thighs—so Harry did it, settling his hands on Draco’s trousers and stroking up to Draco’s arse, then again. Harry tried to remember the last time someone had straddled him like this; he couldn’t. He tried to remember the last time someone’s thighs had made him feel this way—Ginny. He wanted to do things to them. He wanted to fuck them.
“I don’t,” Harry said. “Not usually. Or I didn’t feel helpless, during the war. Now it’s . . . . In some ways, the war was simpler. You picked a side, and you stuck to it. Now—I don’t know how to do that.”
“Kindness,” Harry said dully, even though he shouldn’t.
“No,” Draco agreed, tilting his head.  “You’re right.  I’d probably kill those poor Muggles, wouldn’t I?  Or at least I’d torture and maim them.  Maybe I would rape their children—who knows the kind of monster I am.  A boy-loving bigot; how’s that for a bogey-man?”
Harry blinked. Everyone in Wizarding Britain knew who Teddy Lupin was; they all knew Andromeda Tonks as well. Harry thought about telling Duggins he should brush up on his
Harry put a self-conscious hand to his hair.
“Then why is Dad still there?”
“Malfoy, wait,” Harry said, impatient. “Just let me out of this—”
Harry wanted to tell Teddy, but didn’t. “No,” Harry said. “You don’t need to do anything.”
He meant the fire spell, and Harry had spent enough time with Teddy and Rose and Hugo to know the answer to that question.  “No,” he said, and put his wand away.
Harry sighed. Vinicius had become an Auror shortly after Harry. They had begun to be friends in the early years Harry had been a part of the Auror force, but they had lost touch when Vinicius had become a liaison with MACUSA when Baggot had retired from the force. After ten years as a liaison, Vinicius had asked to be transferred back to the UK and had re-joined the Auror force. He hadn’t really remained in touch with Harry during his absence, but at the holiday party Vinicius had been charming and handsome. He’d had a crush on Harry before he’d left for the States, he’d admitted. When he’d invited Harry back to his flat, Harry had thought,
Harry thought that seemed obvious enough, so he didn’t say anything.
“I said, hold still.”  Malfoy’s steady fingers pressed more firmly on Harry’s clammy skin.
“Thanks,” said Teddy.
“Of course there are extremist bigots,” Malfoy said. “On the pure-blood side. I shouldn’t even say extremist; I shouldn’t use the same words I would for Reveal nutjobs, because pure-bloods are so much worse than some political—there were
“Who do you reckon?”
“That’s not a reason to stop,” Harry said, coming closer.
Swallowing a sigh, Harry realized he’d got relieved about Malfoy too soon. “Still wants to be an Auror.”
“Draco.”  Harry came out from around the lab bench, noticing that Draco was very pale.  “I’m all right.”
“A shop?” Harry said, surprised.  “What kind of shop?”
Harry wondered how he could have possibly missed how out of his mind Draco became when he was upset.  When Draco grew up, Harry guessed, he’d learned to control it better.  “Dobby,” was all Harry said.  “Would you kill Dobby?”
Someone came out of the Pallas Arch, and a few of the reporters turned to see who it was and whether it was someone they would attack with questions, but most stayed focused on Harry and Lee, who was opening his mouth again.
“Of course, Auror Potter.  Only, we small business owners have to contend with so much.  Surely you can understand—”
“What happened to them?”
“I,” Harry said, then hesitated. He wasn’t sure why. He just hadn’t expected Draco to say that.
“Who got to me?”
“Well, why couldn’t it have happened when—why couldn’t I have—why wasn’t
“But Malfoy can usually tell something about it just by looking at it,” Harry said.
“You want to talk about Malfoy having been a Death Eater?”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, “Vance thinks you might have broken the magical restriction.”
Rune was explaining rather eloquently what he thought of as the difference between terrorism, protest, and war, as well as the merits and detriments of each. Harry wondered whether Rune had a little breeze, and then Malfoy was returning, setting down a fresh, crisp-looking salad in front of Rune, as well as a liverwort lemonade.
Fairchild was a Level Two trainee who had brought her non-magical date to the holiday party, and it had caused quite the scandal, on top of several other scandals of the evening—one of which had been Harry chatting with Vinicius, since the wizard press had immediately begun ‘shipping’ the two of them.
“Oh . . .” Timothy’s voice was equally soft. He turned back, looking first at Malfoy, then Harry. Then he looked up. “Will I see my . . . mother . . . ”
Harry’s eyes went wide.  Not only had Draco let him sleep in a bed, but it was
“I’m your trainee.”
.  Do you know how filthy rich that could make us?  It could make us famous.  We’d be—” Draco appeared to search for a word—“
“You already know?” Draco looked at him in surprise over his curry.
to be made fun of.”
Clearwater,” said Spragg. “They’re a fever dream made up by the people who want to keep fighting a war that’s already over—people who miss the glory days when they thought they fought the good fight.”
Standing up, Harry rummaged about. Though he had never been very scholarly, his experience—and the innate proficiency the Horcrux within him had once given him—meant that he knew a lot more about Dark Arts than most. Harry found a quill, a cloth, charcoal, a candle stub, a knife, sterilizing alcohol. This would take some work to figure out, some experimentation. Harry was sure he could figure it out.
“What?”
“‘Course you did. Why in Merlin’s name would I ever think our experience of that school made us even
Harry backed up, only afterwards realizing it put him back in the doorway of the building.  It could be a trick, but all the man did was move his arm, and the owl hopped back up onto his shoulder.  The stick slid out of his sleeve—Harry hadn’t seen him put it away—and then he waved it.  “
Standing up, Harry walked over to the window. The outside grew as he came closer, expanding to include the horizon of Buckley-Bickford on the opposite side of the courtyard, then the courtyard itself. Behind him the voices went on in a dull ebbing roar. The faculty was used to his abrupt disengagement. Usually Penelope came to him and said,
“Yes.”
“It’s someone who wants to make you breakfast all the time,” Draco said.  “They want to do all the washing-up, and all of the laundry, and clean up after you.  If you don’t let them, sometimes they become very upset.  You have to make sure there are enough chores for them to do.”
Harry could feel himself stiffen up.  Draco could most certainly feel it too.
Draco opened his eyes.  “Yes, Harry?”
Teddy shrugged.
In the cupboard, long robes and cloaks hung on hooks next to some other clothes that seemed pretty nice.  Harry tried on one of the coats just for fun, finding some weird gold coins in the pocket.  Not wanting to steal, he put the coins back and the coat back on its hook.  Three or four brooms stood in the corner, which seemed odd as Harry had never been a particular fan of cleaning, and the room outside was hardly immaculate.
“It’s not a trick,” Kavika said, unnecessarily.
“It’s not a grudge, Fudge,” Harry said. “I could look past the war. I
Harry nodded—not so vigorously now.
him, when all he was trying to be was gentle. “I’m really bad at a lot of things. Protecting people isn’t one of them.”
“They say it’s risen,” said Spragg. “And maybe it’s better if we stop seeking compromise. Maybe it’s better if we drop the wards without a Deal. Otherwise, we’ll just be arguing forever the merits of—”
“Oh, the Ludville case,” Shacklebolt said, when Harry was done.  “Don’t worry about that.  Mysteries has it under control.  I’m sure it will all get cleared up in the end.”
Harry was a month into the new year and no clearer on answers. At the start of the new term, he had done the Boggart exercise with the Level Ones, just as he did every year. Many of the trainees’ Boggarts had been some form of Reveal, which at this point was understandable. Reveal as Hermione had always proposed it was a gradual, years’ long process, but under the current Fudge administration, Reveal was looking more and more like a looming threat. Without a Deal, Reveal would happen suddenly, without warning, endangering the non-magical and non-magical-born people it sought to liberate from the secrecy of the Statute.
Duggins brightened like a Lumos. “Would you like to tell me more?” he asked.
Harry raised a brow.  “Did you think the life of an Auror was glamorous?”
“That must have been hard.” The lines in Kavika’s face went softer. “How did it go?”
“I’m so glad you’re not an Auror any longer,” Robards said, turning away. “We’ll use the Penseive Projector in Wizengamot Administrative Services. You two stay in the waiting room—we want an unbiased viewing.”
Malfoy finally straightened from the scattered notes he’d been scribbling when Harry had cracked in.  “Hullo—” Malfoy paused, as if startled to see him.  “Potter.”
“The one in there,” Harry said.  “With the rain.”
“Draco Malfoy let Death Eaters into Hogwarts,” Penelope said. “He’s the reason—”
“The accident didn’t happen to Draco,” Harry said suddenly.
“What would you do there, Malfoy?”
“Apparate?”
“Maybe that’s my own business,” Draco said, his gaze dropping again.  “Leave me some decency, at any rate.”
“Well, then, what am I?  Mushy peas?”
Harry swung to face him. “You are
Several hours later, Andromeda called him for lunch.  She hadn’t asked him what he wanted, which resulted in rather more cabbage than he ever would have asked for.  There were also chicken and dumplings, though, so that was all right.  “You’ve been very quiet,” Andromeda said.  “Have you found Teddy’s video games?”
“Yes.”
“You have it?” When Malfoy nodded, Harry said, “Now think about that moment. Allow it to wash over you.”
Draco put it down.  “I’m going.  That spineless little worm, I want to see him taken down.  I want to see him—”  He bared his teeth, a brutal expression that Harry remembered from the teenage version, but never from Draco in his twenties.  “You can’t stop me.”

Someone pushed against Harry. “Does it hurt when you disappear?” asked a short girl with a round little nose.
are more Minister than this pillock will ever be.” Ron waved his hand at Fudge.
Harry frowned. “Are you asking how Voldemort came back to life?”
“First Aid and Minor Magical Healing. I think Draco really respects you.”
Rune took Malfoy’s hand, leading him away.
“Helping you,” Harry said, trying to pull away.
Reaching into his pocket, Harry pulled out a bottle.  “I brought a potion,” he said, holding it out.
“I’m going to take your wand,” Harry said, because Draco was going to get mad again and start burning things.  Half expecting resistance, Harry went to take Draco’s wand, but Draco let it go easily.
“Come in,” Harry said, opening the door wider.
21 years
Draco threw the plate on the floor, right at the fox, who skittered aside even though the plate and food went right through her.
Pillwickle couldn’t be talking about the bias against non-mags; Harry felt sure. Pillwickle was the one who had said that non-mags were another species at the holiday party, and all of the Board were fairly anti non-mag.
When he didn’t say anything, Harry loosened up a little. He’d been pressing Draco down into the bed. “It’s not meant to be a test, Draco.”
“Yes.” Draco’s teeth found the corner of Harry’s jaw. “I was supposed to be.” His warm hand slid around Harry’s dick.
“Is that what this is about?”
“Your saviour. Stupefy,” Malfoy added, pointing at another NDE as he guided the man out of the room. The NDE battling Ron fell to the ground unconscious.
“Um.”  Harry pulled his hand away.  “Maybe you shouldn’t.”
“Now I’m going to put my other about your neck,” Harry said, then spoke over Malfoy’s shoulder to the class. “Remind your partner what you’re going to do when you’re going slow. When you practice, everything should feel comfortable. Malfoy,” Harry added, very softly, “relax.”
The man had been drawing his stick out of his sleeve, but he stopped at Harry’s words, obviously taking in Harry’s stunned expression.  “Ah,” the man said knowingly.  “You haven’t seen one before.”
“I’m sorry, Harry.”  Draco’s voice sounded strained, but Harry couldn’t see his face.  He was staring down at the papers, not looking at him.  “You did.”
Malfoy had said,
The image in the IC:WUT/UC turned again, showing the main entrance corridor of Windermere Hall, with Travers walking down it. “You made it!” Travers said, looking young and honestly pleased.
Greengrass had been pretending to examine his nails, and this comment did not appear to perturb him. “Leave my daughter out of this. You’re embarrassing yourself.”
“I mean, I want to talk about you going to Academy.”
“Why the fuck were you trying to kill me?”
As much as Harry disliked reading, he could be really focused if he was intent on something.  Painstakingly, he read through each paper, following the letters with his fingers so they jumped around less.  He searched for Cecil Vance’s name, as well as addresses or any locations he could find with a map.
“This really would be so much simpler if either of you had paid any attention at all in History of Magic.” Hermione looked so Hermione in that moment that Harry found himself smiling, even though he should have felt guilty.
Harry grabbed him, trying to contain Draco’s thrashing long enough to Disapparate.
“The Aurors did that,” Ron said, turning from his conversation with Malfoy, “but by the time we got to the site, whoever did it was always gone.”
Teddy’s Order of the Phoenix was trying to put in place measures that would help the non-magical world integrate with the magical, whether there was a Deal or not. One measure was the educational facilities, where non-magical people could learn about magical people, and magical people could learn about non-magical.
Nyala pressed her lips together, brow knit with worry. “I don’t know. I don’t know; I never told him. I mean, I told him once. I was eleven. He was twelve. I think he thought—he thought I didn’t know what I was saying, that I was just obsessed because he was Teddy
“Yeah,” Draco grunted. “Fuck. The way you take it, you’re so willing for it, aren’t you; you love getting fucked from both ends, something to fuck your mouth and fill your slutty wet cunt of an arse. Fuck.” Draco’s voice dropped to a raspy whisper. “You’re not even hard.”
Malfoy took a quick breath. Then another, and another, but finally, the shoulders came down. “Good,” Harry said, keeping his hands on them. “Keep them here. Now think about that memory. Don’t just concentrate on it with your mind—let it into your body. Let it enter you. Let it fill you. Let it surround you, become a part of you, so you’re living inside of it, and it’s living inside of you.”
The door of the cabinet slowly creaked open.
“Many of these aren’t Pot—your cases,” Draco said, correcting himself, “and there are a great deal of files.  I wonder if you were cross-referencing older Ministry cases to look for a pattern that matched your current suspect.”
“Well, I—” Draco stopped, swallowed. His gaze swept down. “I probably just imagined you’d—you’d pin me down and have your Auror way with me.”
“I must confess, Harry.”  Draco looked very serious, his blond hair lit up by the firelight.  “I am not fond of Aunt Petunia.”
“Yes,” Harry said, as Draco’s eyes rolled back, and he fell onto the sofa, unconscious.
“People will want to see you,” Kavika had said, a few years later, after more sessions than Harry could count. “You only have to ask.”
After a few hours Draco rolled up his scrolls, stoppered his bottles, put the quill down on the bench, and came over to where Harry was trying to learn the spells.  “Are you finished already?” Draco said, smiling down at the book, forgot on the table.
Draco was trying to distract him.
Harry stared at him. “That would be the trainee that didn’t pass.”
Harry eyed her. “That doesn’t help.”
,” Draco said.
involved in my job as a shopkeeper’s assistant.”
“We have far more important members,” Travers said. “Ones you’ve heard of.”
Rombe Pickle got too warm on nights like this, despite winter still frosting the windows. Andromeda had lit a fire in the hearth, and the soft glow danced amidst excited hands and loud voices, suggestions, ideas, laughter. Malfoy was in the thick of it, ensconced on the sofa beside Astoria—leaning against her a little, Harry saw. Malfoy sometimes did that. He and Astoria were always touching, and the sudden memory of Malfoy on the train came back to Harry, Pansy Parkinson’s hand in his hair.
“Sit down,” Malfoy said dismissively.
“Bi.”
“No, really,” Malfoy said. “I’m fine.”
Harry smiled.  “Do you want to show me the colour spells on the fire?”
But Draco didn’t finish, and Harry couldn’t figure out what he’d been about to say.  ‘Tough,’ maybe, because he did look that.  Dudley would probably like to have such a body when he grew up, instead of the one he’d got.  Harry tried to be glad he didn’t look like grown-up Dudley, but while grown-up Dudley had been round with greying hair, he hadn’t looked in the least threatening, and that was what this body was.  It was threatening.
Harry had forgiven Malfoy for letting Death Eaters into Hogwarts.  He’d forgiven everything, not because Malfoy’s behaviour had been in any way acceptable, but because Malfoy was a different person now.  He had grown up; they had both grown up.  The past would always be between them, but it didn’t have to rule their lives.
“You’re holding on too tight,” Harry said, trying to make his voice as soft as he did for Rose.  Reaching out to Malfoy’s wand with one hand, Harry touched Malfoy’s little white knuckles with the other, tugging his fist a bit.  Malfoy’s grip loosened, and Harry repositioned Malfoy’s grip on the wand.  “Do you feel the magic inside you?”
“Yes, what?”
Surprised, Harry felt his wand rip out of his hand. He tried to retaliate physically, with hand to hand, but Malfoy was still too quick, dancing back, blocking the swing of Harry’s fist. “Accio wand,” Harry said, realizing too late that this was something he could do. Malfoy had already pushed him down, toppling Harry with his own weight, and maybe the Summon hadn’t worked, or something like that, because all Harry could think of now was the fact of Malfoy on top of him.
“This is the opposite of everything Travers did,” Harry said. “You are the opposite of him.”
cool.”
Harry looked down at the book, trying not to let his face fall.
“Of course.” Greengrass fluttered, always so eager to please the former Hero of the Wizarding World, even while her husband sought to constantly undermine him. Harry didn’t know how much Lionel Greengrass had told his wife about Harry’s defence of Draco Malfoy, who was still deeply reviled by the Greengrass family for his former engagement to Astoria. Frankly, Harry didn’t care to know.
Malfoy had told him,
Harry knew how the indicator solution worked.  He’d tested it himself, all those years ago with Malfoy—if someone hadn’t had any crocodile tears, nothing changed colour.  Which meant that either Savage’s desk was covered in crocodile tears, or something else was wrong.  Decanting the solution back into the bottle, Harry followed it up with a disillusionment.
“Oh,” Draco said, looking as though hunger was an entirely new concept to him, but interesting nevertheless.  “I suppose—yes, I could eat.”
“Funny,” Malfoy said. “Knitting’s not bad.”
“I’ll see you both tomorrow at Academy.” Then Teddy was opening the door, Nyala rushing after him.
“Maybe not hard enough.”
“And let them get all the glory?” Malfoy asked. “Hardly. Protego!” A witch had just escaped an Auror spell. Seeing Malfoy escape, she had tried to cast an Unforgivable, but Malfoy’s shield was just quick enough. “Petrificus Totalus! Did you see that stag earlier?” As the witch fell over in the Body Bind, Malfoy looked forward, where shadows of retreating Dementors blocked the doorway out. “That was mine,” Malfoy went on. “I made it. I could do it again.”
Harry had already forgotten he had told them about this line; he’d been thinking about how orientation felt without Malfoy.
“What should one do if one spots the infamous escapee Fenrir Greyback?” Pillwickle went on.
“My mum isn’t here,” Draco said, “and it’s our in-between birthday.  We do what we please.”  Then he made the pudding into a snake, and somehow made it say,
“Because of your father?” Harry guessed.  “Or because of blood purity?”
Fingers slid down the crease, down to the waiting hole, wet and soiled with come. Fingers pressed against the opening, teasing muscle of the rim with light pressure as the fingers pressed some of the come back in.
, was another thing that Kavika told him to do in times like these, besides try to get outside, besides
“Good boy.” Draco pointed the wand lower, probably making that tight little circle with it at his testicles, but Harry didn’t see; he was too intently licking. “Okay,” Draco said. “Now you can suck.”
Harry felt his eyes bug out.  “You have a tattoo?”
All the cabinets in the kitchen came open, slamming against their casings with a loud crack.  Dishes inside jiggled with little tinkling sounds.
Harry moaned harder. In response, Draco slowed, fucking slower, more gently. “Tell me what you want, Harry.”
“He was beloved by many people,” Draco said.  “Our Headmaster.  And he loved many people in return.”
Startled, Ron turned, admitting Nyala and Teddy into their little circle.
Harry’s stomach felt much better after having dumped a portion of its contents into the toilet, but he felt all the wrong temperatures—cold but sweaty, a little light-headed.  His mouth tasted terrible, and yet he couldn’t really think about it, because Mister Malfoy wasn’t angry.  He wasn’t annoyed or telling him to hurry up, and for once, getting sick had been entirely Harry’s fault.  Harry didn’t understand, and the worst part was the way Mister Malfoy kept running his fingers through Harry’s hair, because it felt nice.
“I have no desire to have a wife, Harry,” Draco said, handing back the cards.
“Do you really want a statue to be made of you?”
“Harry.”  Draco’s shoulders in Harry’s body slumped.  “It’s going to sound deeper because the sound is reverberating through your own skull.  Talking with your voice also sounds different to what I’m used to hearing when you talk.”
Harry glanced at the package.  “But it wouldn’t be big enough anyway.”
“I couldn’t before,” Harry said. “Not while you were still a student.”
Baggot was a good-looking man with a very broad frame, a round face, bright blue eyes, who said in his gentle-giant voice, “Get over it.”
On her perch, Heloise shifted from foot to foot.
“Harry!” Draco’s hand shot down, squeezing the base of his own dick, stopping himself from coming.
“All right, already,” said Draco.
Steps sounded on the stairs.
“I’ll show you, if you’ll let me,” Harry said.  “But right now, you don’t—you don’t know me the way that I know you.  It isn’t fair to you.  And it isn’t fair to me.”
“And will the trainees ask you where he went?”
Fire.  Coloured fire.
“There’s no need to yell.”  Petunia sniffed.  That was familiar too, only she always used to sniff in disdain, like Harry smelled bad or something, and now she sounded—well, she sounded a little teary-eyed, and Harry almost felt badly.  “What’s wrong with you, anyway?  Are you ill?  Your voice sounds terrible.”
Heloise had a perch in the lab where she sometimes slept, but she wasn’t there, so Harry went upstairs to the kitchen to check the window.  Draco said that was usually the window he left open for her, just in case she wanted in when he wasn’t home.  Sometimes she tapped on Draco’s bedroom window, but Draco said he didn’t let her sleep with him.  He said she made a mess.
“I know it’s not,” Harry said. “It’s hope.”
Looking away, Harry picked up the phial with the milky grey substance.  “Besides,” Harry went on, “this isn’t an interrogation.  I’m literally handing you the counteragent to Veritaserum, so you don’t have to tell the truth if you don’t want.”  Harry handed Malfoy the phial.  “What kind of Auror does that make me?”
“Unless he’s the one saying them,” Andromeda went on.
“Don’t,” Harry said.
“Well,” Draco said, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.  “That was—”
“We love you so much,” said Hermione.  “And sometimes we’re afraid that you’re—you seem detached, sometimes, and we worry—we worry . . .”
“You remember that I can’t sleep?” Malfoy’s eyes were wreathed with something a little like hope.
“Aunt Petunia says I’m rude.”  Harry could feel chocolate on his face, but he didn’t care.
Harry shook his head.
choose. It’s yours. Not anyone else’s. Do you know what Malfoy deserves from you? Nothing.”
“You’ll have to ask for it,” Draco said.
“Everyone is saying Teddy’s Order is going to destroy the Force.”
“I say,” said a man coming from the dining room.  “What’s going on?”
“Marrying Astoria?” said Ron. “You never know. Maybe that pure-blood fortune was too good to pass up.”
“Yes, I’m sure you’re very talented.”  Mister Malfoy didn’t seem at all impressed.
“Something that happened. So many things happen. What happened?”
“Just this. Tap my thigh three times if you don’t like it.”
Draco went still.  “Yes, Harry,” he said, then flew up on his broom.
“I was making several things.  Just in case, Harry.”  Draco’s face looked tired and miserable.
“Harassed,” Kavika said, sipping her coffee.
“Oh,” said Doctor Yin, as though they had not known this all along.
31 years
“Where did it land on you?”
They had hurt him.
“We’ve got to take it to the Aurors,” Harry said, putting the vial in his pocket.
Either that, or embarrassed.
“Music, obviously.”
“I don’t feel fine, is the problem,” Harry said, playing with the crystal puzzle, frustrated with it already. He set it down with a clunk on one of Doctor Yin’s crowded shelves. “I don’t want to not know what I want. I want to know what I want.”
Malfoy hesitated, then took the proffered hand. “Does that mean you can use the information?”
“Teddy,” Harry said in a rush.  “You know I love you—right?”
“Why are you always . . .”  Mister Malfoy stopped, then sighed.  “It was that Cure-All I went to get for you earlier.  I suppose it didn’t work.”
“Draco,” Harry said, much louder and close to Draco now.
“I’ll tell you; I’m sorry; let go.”  Harry yanked on the parchment, but Malfoy still held onto the other end.  “Malfoy—Draco.  Let go.”  With a final tug, Harry got the parchment away.
“Mmm,” Harry moaned, at last pulling off with one long, hot suck. “Do it.”
“Why, to catch up with an old acquaintance,” Malfoy said. “I didn’t know you were here. Come back to the party.”
“Now, if I had told you, would you have believed me?” Mark asked.
Hermione finally looked at Harry. “Did it turn into something more?”
“I wanted to be a hero.”
“Also true.”
“I’ve heard of Parkinson,” Malfoy said, looking sulky. “I was in the war, you’ll remember. I had the—prestigious people living at my house. I was personally—intimately—acquainted with pretty much everyone of consequence there used to be.”
For the life of him, Harry couldn’t think of anything else remotely posh that he knew how to make.  “Beef wellingtons,” Harry suggested because Malfoy had made them, even though Harry was sure he couldn’t make them.
Harry’s hands hurt from clutching him too hard.  “I thought.”  He gasped for breath.  “I was afraid I might not get you back.”
“But it’s not a good title,” Harry said, then wondered why he was arguing this.
It made me want to tell that poor man what he was getting into, but of course
“How is he?” Kavika said.
“Potter,” Mister Malfoy said, sounding a bit frantic.  “Drink this!”
“I’m sorry I went on like that,” Harry said.  “I shouldn’t have.”
“Yes, Harry.  I value it—tremendously.”
“The same?” Malfoy’s voice was low, a little threatening. “You said we could never feel the same.
Harry remembered that from school.  Malfoy liked to hear himself talk.
“Tomorrow,” Harry said.
“Right.”  Finally, Malfoy looked away, a slight frown between his brows.  “I’ll . . .”  As though at a loss, Malfoy turned back to Harry, reaching for him again.
“Draco,” Harry said slowly.  “That was years ago for you as well.  You’re twenty-five.  That was eight years ago for you.”
Harry shrugged. “Who’s allowed to go under the Whomping Willow?”
“What’s a spell I could use to arrange them by viscosity?” Harry asked him.
Harry wondered if the man was finally realizing he was absolutely mental.
“No,” said Harry. “Kavika is right. And you’re right as well, Mister Bickford. Everything is changing.”
“Because he doesn’t know,” Draco said, still in that frantic way.  “He doesn’t understand that—Harry.”  Taking him by the shoulders, Draco held on very tight.  “There are people who love you.  Do you understand?  You are loved.  You are so loved.  If you run away like that, you’ll—if you were ever hurt, you’d break their hearts.  Do you understand me?  Do you know there are people who love you?”
“Do you . . . you want to come inside?”  Dudley opened the door wider.
Responding to the tug, tilting his head up, Draco smirked. “I know,” he said, resting his chin on Harry’s thigh.
Draco’s mouth had got thinner.  His hair had a bit less shine.  “All right,” Harry said, after a long moment.  “I’ve calmed down.  Are you okay?”
Harry shrugged.  “You always do.”
Of course, Malfoy was afraid. He’d always been afraid, even when they were kids. He was afraid of his own Patronus, for Christ’s sake. “Malfoy,” Harry said, more gently now. He took a step forward. “I won’t let anyone hurt you. You have my word.”
Alby was going to deny it again, so Harry increased the hold of his magic on Alby’s neck.
“Well, partially thanks to him,” said Savage. “If Baggot hadn’t failed him, he wouldn’t have had to apply again. A third time.”
“You identify potions for the Auror Office, so we can keep dangerous brews off the streets.”  On Malfoy’s frown, Harry added, “Sometimes you develop potions to help us, too.  You cured me, once.  Several times, actually.”
“I said I don’t
Harry wanted to offer him sympathy. He didn’t know what to say. “The other instructors say you’re brilliant.”
Harry pointed his wand.  “
“From whom?” asked Harry, who wanted to hex anyone who even looked at Teddy in a way that was suspect, but generally refrained.
“Thirty-two years old.  And that scar.  Merlin’s beard!”  Malfoy snapped his fingers.  “You’re Harry Potter!”
Without looking back at it, she swished her wand, letting the chandelier fall a meter so she could catch it in a web of magic that lifted the chandelier back up while repairing the chain. Still no one in the shouting crowd around Harry seemed to notice, and Harry didn’t want them to. Slipping behind Ron, Harry escaped the knot of people—only to be faced by the rest of the holiday party, where people were all beginning to stare at the two former Ministers arguing, at Head Councillor Hermione Granger rushing to join them, at the Boy Who Lived desperate to escape.
“No, Harry.”  Draco gripped him by the shoulders.  “Harry.  I don’t want you to ever act in a way you don’t feel.  Whatever you feel or don’t feel is okay; don’t let anyone tell you differently.  Do you understand me?”
“The Headmaster?” Harry asked, pushing in so he was purposely squashing Draco’s arm, but Draco still didn’t put it around him.  “The one that everyone liked?”
Ginny had told him once, when they’d been arguing about it.  She’d said that she thought he might be bisexual, and he had been so convinced he wasn’t.
“Get on the bed,” Draco said, pulling Harry away from the wall, turning him around. He gave Harry a push on his chest.
I know spells.  I’m not a Muggleborn.  Can I . . .?” He’d begun pointing the wand, but again looked up at Harry.  His cheeks were pink with excitement.  “What about the decree for underage magic?”
Penelope was facing off Baggot. “The Flanders Flip, as you well know, is a
.” Astoria sipped her champagne.
“Er,” Harry said.
“They’re Aurors,” Draco snapped.  “I should have thought that would be obvious.”
Harry thought of the Order, which had been so different, which had been so effective—even if, in the end, Harry had been the one who had to die in order to stop Voldemort. At least the Order had been on the right side; at least the Order had done something, but thinking of it now felt wild, a little over the top. A secret organization to stop a sociopathic zealot who had led a coup on the Ministry of Magic? What insanity had Harry lived through, when he was young? What insanity was this whole world, where regimes could be toppled so easily, and minds could be controlled, and the very institution that was meant to stop it helped it happen?
“—but I believe there is Auror casework to be done,” Robards went on. “Instructor Potter, seeing as how you are not an Auror—”
“Malfoy.”  Harry took another step.  He was standing very close to Malfoy, now.  “I think you could do anything you wanted, if you put your mind to it.”
Eventually, it began to rain. Harry listened to the dull
“We’re in London?”  Harry looked around.  The street was lined with buildings without spaces in-between—tall ones, short ones, most of them built of wood.  Some of them looked quite crooked-y, like they shouldn’t be standing.  Most had windows.  Turning, Harry looked at the building they had been in—the one with the hearth and all the books upstairs.  Actually, now that he thought about it, he wasn’t sure about having a hearth upstairs.  Didn’t they have to be on the ground level?  This wasn’t like any street in London he’d seen before.
Harry thought he might drool. The sight of the pink prick was too much for him, even softening, and his own prick was aching enough for the both of them. He moved down for a taste—
Draco had established specific properties of the Fountain of Youth without even having any of it available; it was meant to be mythical stuff.  What was more, he’d done all this without Harry even seeing, because when Harry had been helping him, they’d mostly been doing indicator solutions and diagnostic tests.
Harry stared at him uncomprehendingly, less because he couldn’t comprehend and more because he didn’t want to comprehend. “How could I be happy if you get yourself killed?”
Harry stopped, waiting for Milligan to say something, but instead she said, “Mm-hm,” soothingly, waiting for him to go on. She must sense his impatience, and Harry was fucking this up. He hadn’t meant to fuck it up, but he was. “And Ron and Hermione,” Harry ploughed on. “They are two, but in some ways they’re ‘the one’ for me. No one will ever be as important as they are to me. And then there’s Teddy. There can be someone that I love,” Harry went on. “But I don’t believe there’s just one person out there, waiting.”
“That’s how I feel.”  Harry took out his glasses, sliding them back on.  “I promise, it won’t change.”
Harry grew, memories crashing into him in a rush—Hagrid, Hogwarts, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, Voldemort.  Auror training, Savage, Robards.  Draco Malfoy, Cecil Vance, illegal potions, the warehouse.  The glass bottle falling off the shelf.  He could remember being a child, the confusion of seeing Dudley all grown-up, Draco making cake, making his nose-hairs grow, making a Patronus whose meaning Harry now understood.
Harry whined again, but managed to nod his head with Draco’s hand in his hair, and Draco let go. Immediately, Harry descended, and immediately, Draco grabbed his hair and yanked. Harry made a sound of protest.
,” Mister Malfoy said, raising his voice over the ruckus of the dancing table.
Harry strained to hear the rain, but it was too soft, though now that he listened, he could hear a
“Then why don’t you?”
“How are you this evening?” Fudge asked.
Harry heard the traditional answers: Tarantallegra, Expelliarmus, Engorgio, Reducio, Lumos, Aguamenti, the Bat Bogey Hex, heat spells, cold spells. He did not have to think about them to accept them and discuss them; he did not have to think about it to point out that Protego was definitely a combat spell and didn’t fit the category. He had to stop when someone suggested a tree-growing spell, because that one was slow and might not work. Sensing that he was actually having to think about it, which might mean he would have to think of everything, Harry said that they would come back to it. Usually they did practice next, but if he could keep them going for long enough he wouldn’t have to think at all; then they would go and he could finally be alone, alone, alone—
As Harry finished up, he realized Mister Malfoy had just been standing there, not doing anything.  When Harry turned he found Mister Malfoy watching him, something that seemed unhappy filling his silver eyes.  Harry checked to make sure all the chocolate was cleaned up, but the kitchen looked quite clean once again.  By the time Harry looked back, Mister Malfoy was turning away, sliding his wand into his sleeve.  “Harry,” he said decisively, sweeping off toward the cabinets.  “Do you like cake?”
Draco beamed.  “I said, no ‘laughing!’  From now on, only serious spells!”  Then he pointed his wand at himself again.  “
“Is that so?” Greengrass wasn’t even really feigning disingenuity at this point. “I think I heard he was failing Gordon’s class.”
Harry looked up, hardly able to believe anything so vulgar could come from a child’s mouth, but Draco was fourteen.  He’d got taller, his face longer.  He was old enough to say it, if not mean it.
Fudge’s green head shook sadly in its own hearth. “I’m afraid we really can’t set a precedent by passing a failing trainee, just because he is a momentary wizarding media sensation.”
got me what I wanted?”
“And I thanked you for it—what’s the matter with that?”
Malfoy reminded Harry so strongly of Lupin in that moment that he thought of the way he had more than once seen Teddy and Malfoy, sitting under this very tree. When Harry didn’t take the chocolate, Malfoy put it on the bench between them and stood up.
want to be an Auror. Me. I don’t want to buy it; I don’t want it to be given to me; I want to earn it. Just one thing, for myself, that I did, that he doesn’t want, that—”
“About what?”
“Nothing, Harry.  Just—sometimes, this is a lot to take in.”
Harry came out of Head Auror Robards’ office disappointed in life, the Aurors, and most of all in this stupid case he couldn’t solve because the one extra potions class he’d taken at Auror Academy was hardly enough to determine the use of this particular potion.  The Department of Mysteries was too busy for Auror problems, Harry had learned.  He would have to do the research himself, which wouldn’t be a problem except that he’d be stuck at his desk trying to figure it out while Muggles were dying on the streets.
“That can be fixed.”
“Malfoy is smarter than that,” Harry said.  “He’s smarter than that and he’s cleverer than you; he’s better at potions than you, and you resent him for it, and you won’t let him do his fucking
Maybe he could build a castle. Sighing, Harry waved the blocks away. “I keep thinking about Hogwarts.”
“I hadn’t noticed.” Harry found his hand moving to his other hand, rubbing the scar on the back of his fist. “I was looking for Teddy. That’s not true. I was looking for Vinicius. And Malfoy. But I was looking for Teddy, before.”
“We’re not going to say anything?” Harry asked after taking a sip.
Perhaps Malfoy was thinking about their “epic rivalry,” or whatever nonsense, or perhaps Malfoy was actually afraid. Indeed, Malfoy had been quite terrified of Harry more than several times in school. Either way, Harry didn’t want to cause a scene. Still standing behind him, Harry kept his voice low and soft, just for Malfoy’s ear. “Malfoy, are you—”
The train in the memory was coming to a halt, and Goyle was throwing open the door, pushing his way into a crowd of second years. Crabbe and Zabini followed. “You go on,” Malfoy told Parkinson, who was holding out her hand for him. “I just want to check on something.”
“Is it true you defeated the Dark Lord with a disarming spell?” one of the trainees asked, inevitably.
“Okay,” said Harry, because he was fairly certain that despite Doctor Yin’s eccentricities, the experiment would probably not involve alpacas or other live animals. Perhaps it would involve taxidermy ones.
Then there was Malfoy, tall and blond and doing much better in Wandless Combat. This made sense, and Harry felt that he should have expected it—Malfoy had already had a year of training, after all. But Malfoy had been such a poor student that Harry hadn’t realized how much Malfoy had retained; he knew all of the techniques—the holds, the feints, the ways to move. Even if he could not execute these things as well as someone who naturally excelled at physical combat, he was ahead of the rest of the trainees, and for the first few weeks Harry had been startled to see it.
The waiter put plates down around the table, the smell making Harry realize he was hungry, though he wasn’t sure he could eat such hot, heavy food in such a close atmosphere. “Icebox lily cucumber sandwich and liverwort lemonade?” the waiter asked, now holding only a plate and a glass, with the big tray under his arm.
For a moment, Harry watched how the firelight from the hearths played in Malfoy’s hair.  “I know you dislike me intensely.”  He paused, half hoping Malfoy would dispute that as well, but he didn’t.  “But you’re the only one I can trust right now.”
Malfoy began to smile. Harry began to reach for the back of his other hand. Trainees began to ask questions.
By Wednesday, the preparation for Draco to infiltrate the NDE meeting at Windermere Hall was complete. Robards would not let them come Thursday night to plan the mission further, claiming that additional planning would only exhaust everyone and changes in plan would confuse everyone. Harry itched to point out how little faith Robards was showing in his team, but then thought of Malfoy, and was silent. It was true. Malfoy could use the rest.
“Oh,” Harry said, doing his best not to feel disappointed.
“Father said—he said the Headmaster is un
“Your wand work is good,” Harry went on, “but it’s at potions you really excel.  You’re the best potions master I’ve ever seen.”
“It’s still my office, Malfoy,” Harry said, finally beginning to be impatient. “Tell me what you want, or—”
Harry felt a bit like he might sick up.
“I would wager you that if I still had my practice, every single patient would be talking about Reveal. Honestly,” Kavika went on, “I was wondering when you would talk to me about it.”
“I don’t know,” Draco called up to him.  “You’re so
Malfoy’s eyes widened slightly. “Mm-hm. Yeah. I’m good. How about you?”
Malfoy sneered at the counter.
Christ.  Harry’s hand clenched on his own chest.
“But you want to keep him safe.”
“But you mean—you would fuck me.”
“Uhn!” Harry shouted, convulsing on the bed, but Draco just held on, and then he began to fuck, and fuck, and fuck.
, however, caused Harry’s clothes to lift him the metre he needed to catch Malfoy’s hand, and then Malfoy was hauling him up, angling the broom to catch him. After an awkward moment, Harry was settled behind Malfoy on the broom, and Malfoy was whisking them away.
“I’m just sorry I didn’t figure it out before Vance got to me,” Ron said.  “That Imperius potion was some powerful stuff.”
“I didn’t say—”  His voice too loud, Harry cut himself off.  “I didn’t say I liked you better, just in a different way.”
“What did I say about ‘should’?” Ron’s voice was gentle. “One day you and Hermione have to realize you’re not the ones that control the systems. The world would be a lot better if you were.”
“Heavens.” Draco shuddered again.
Harry glanced at the wall where the portrait used to be.  Instead there was a painting of a field of flowers with thestrals grazing.  “Luna painted over it.”
“I have something.” Malfoy did not appear to mean coffee.
A hum started low in Harry’s toes and moved slowly up through him.  It felt kind of nice.  “What am I meant to know?” he asked.
“There was an improvement in the building of ships and new trade routes through Asia that led to the Age of Exploration, which meant non-magical people were closer to having access to power previously only held by magical people. That was the real reason,” Hermione went on, “but the wizards behind the movement to conceal the Wizarding World from the non-magical weren’t about to admit they supported the Statute because they were terrified of non-mags, so they made it about law. They said that non-magical law wasn’t extensive enough to govern wizards, that they needed to have the power to create their own law—so they did.”
“You wouldn’t be a bad date if you tried,” Malfoy told him. “Everyone would still think you’re brilliant.”
Harry frowned.  Even if Malfoy had been a prat and a Death Eater and just generally the worst, calling him that seemed out of line.
Fuck.
“When speaking of those who received too light a sentence,” said Fudge, “I hardly think I merit even a mention.”
to respond—and yet, he had been the one who had been able to break through the compulsion of the powder.  Who and what Malfoy was had reminded him—because, for a moment, Harry had forgot it.  He’d forgot everything, everything between them, except for the taste of Malfoy’s lips against his, the press of Malfoy’s body against his own.
“Sure.”  At last, Harry found the book and pulled it out of the shelves.  “But I thought maybe we could read together.  How about this one?”
“I’m not a Crup,” Harry said, but Malfoy was already brushing by, walking out the door, as though he expected to be followed, and Harry didn’t know why, but he was following him. “Malfoy,” Harry said, catching up and walking beside him, “you can’t just come into my office whenever you want. I have office hours. If you want to talk about your marks—”
“Sorry,” Harry said, going after him.  “Auror business!”
Harry was going to ask him why, but the fox put its translucent silver paws up on the couch, then hopped up between them.  Harry budged over to make room for it, which put a small smile back on Draco’s face.
Malfoy wasn’t there.
“I’m sorry I called.” Harry ran his hand over the back of his fist, the scar. “I didn’t know what else to do.”
“Not if I don’t first.” Malfoy turned to Harry. “That’s how I found the Teddy—I put a tracking spell on her.”
Harry didn’t want to hear.  He couldn’t bear to hear.
The non sequitur of the question actually made Harry stop rubbing his scar. “Do you mean if he was an Animagus?”
“Citizens,” said Teddy. “Of the magial world. Just people who want to be there for each other, and want to help.”
equals. We’re not even the same species.”
“Has anyone ever done that for you, Harry?” Draco’s voice was so low and soft, words whispered like a secret in Harry’s ear. “Studied you? Made a project of you? Taken you apart piece by piece so they know how your body works, every detail of you, every little breath you take?” Draco bit him again, almost too sharply.
“Why, are you?” Harry said, before he could stop himself.
“And then imagine ten of those years, wanting something
Draco really wanted to do it, even if it was just to make Harry happy.  Harry said okay.
“That’s just it, Harry.”  Draco was playing with the placemat again, his wand making the fringe at the edges dance.  “The only person who would reasonably be going through your desk is you.”
“No.  I want to make you hate me.  You, specifically.”
“Do you miss him?” Harry asked, at last done with the snaps.
Malfoy didn’t move, standing there extremely stiffly. “Do you embrace all your trainees after their final exam?”
the trunk, then all was black and shadow. Next, the face of the non-mag, still unmoving under the effect of the Full-Body Bind. Next, the face of a Dementor, that grey skin, those dead eyes, that black hole of a mouth.
“Oh, you always were so clever!” Fudge’s sharp little eyes sparkled as he waved in the direction of Hermione and Shacklebolt, who were still talking to Pillwickle and Greengrass. “They have been talking of nothing but Reveal all night. I’m curious what you think of it, Auror Potter. It’s hardly—”
Malfoy turned back to him, a brow raised. “Exercises?”
Bickford bounced harder. “My great-great-grandfather!”
Harry began, “Q and A with Malfoy later—”
“I’ll take the sofa,” Draco said.
“Then we can visit him.”
Silver light filled the IC:WUT/UC, and at first, Harry thought that one of the Aurors in the room had been able to stop dueling the NDEs long enough to save Malfoy, but no. The Dementor Kissing Malfoy startled back, and the Patronus was a stag.
is second-rate.  Father says.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, reaching for him.
them?  For the one whole day he was going to be twenty?  Did he have leather trousers, too?
“Oh.” Startled, Draco glanced down at the fox, who had been scratching behind her ear for most of this time, watching them without much interest.
Despite what Draco had said, Harry had sort of expected that he would be pushing Draco up against a wall at some point, but that was not what happened.  Draco had been correct—Harry had done the kissing up till this point.  The other times they’d kissed, Draco had wanted to be kissed, and by Harry Potter, but Draco had not wanted Harry the way that Harry wanted him.  Draco had been unable to, not having the same memories, or the time to process.
“It’s a trick I learned from you, actually,” said the man.  “Owls are terrific finders.  If Heloise has your cousin’s name, she can probably locate him even without an address—unless he happens to be hiding.”
“Potter.”  The man shoved the phial he’d been holding in his pocket.  “You do know what magic is?”
Harry didn’t know what to say, so he sicked up again into the toilet bowl.
“Yes,” Kavika said gently. “And how it will make you feel in the moment? With all your students assuming you’ve done something terrible?”
Malfoy’s eyes went larger, his cheeks pinker.  He opened his mouth to say what Harry could only imagine was
“I didn’t used to think of him as a person,” Teddy said. “He was a Death Eater.”
Draco smiled faintly, just a twist at the side of his mouth.  “Yes, Harry, you have a desk.”
Shrugging, Harry held out his hand.  “Give me the paper.  I’ll write it.”
meant that he didn’t mean the other things he’d said then, but Harry had no way to tell without asking.
“And I wanted to thank you for that,” Harry said.  “And tell you that—that you mean everything to me.  Everything.  Because—because you’re my family.  And family is—it’s the most important thing.”
Malfoy had been perfectly cordial since the incident with the siren tongue powder, still helping Harry with potions ID, never complaining about anything.  And that was a problem, wasn’t it, because Malfoy wasn’t a perfectly cordial person; he was clever and capable and at times, even charming, but he wasn’t nice.  Now, however, he was nothing but polite and professional with Harry, and Harry didn’t know whether the attitude was a result of just flat-out homophobia, dislike for Harry personally, still grief over his mum, or some combination of all three.
Mister Malfoy frowned.
Ron gave him a little smile, one of the kind ones. “Okay.”
“It must have been really hard for him,” Hermione said.  “Being an eleven-year-old with you.”
“I obviously couldn’t do it on my own.”
“What?  Oh.”  Hermione turned around to look at the picture.  “Yes, she’s becoming quite the little artist.”
on the Quidditch field be used as the determining factor for failing marks?” Penelope.
“He’s your family,” Mister Malfoy said dismissively.
Thank you all for your very kind response to this story.  I hope you continue to enjoy!  If you want to talk, you can find me at letteredlettered on tumblr.
“The tea,” Malfoy said, wiggling his fingers.
“All right.”  Harry got into bed.
“Just for a moment,” Harry soothed. “I’m going to touch your shoulders. Here,” he said, gently putting his hands on Malfoy’s mostly bare shoulders. “They’re up near your ears. See if you can relax enough to drop them.”
“I don’t care,” Draco said, still clutching him.  “He could have hurt you.”
“Don’t you ever get bored, squaring off with children every day?” Malfoy fired off another spell, which Harry countered. “Don’t you wish you had someone who could match you—your speed, your strength, your skill?”
Someone gasped. They’d probably been a year old when the Dark Lord rose; they had no good reason to fear the name.
Hesitating, Pillwickle looked toward Fudge’s hearth, then turned back to Harry. “Having Draco Malfoy as an Auror would demonstrate a certain lack of bias,” said Pillwickle.
Malfoy turned from the window to face him. “I’m in love with you,” he said. “I don’t know why. I’ve never known why. You’re—you’re bloody impossible, and I’m—I’m—well, look at me. I was a Death Eater and I tried to kill your friends and I—well. All number of other things you’re probably too righteous to forgive.”
Some bastard out there must think Ron a right idiot.
“I bet you like the really kinky kind,” Malfoy was saying. “The kind with tentacles. And Animagi. And—”
Then the little bell above the door rang.
“Then what’s the criteria?” Malfoy said. “Who is allowed to climb and who isn’t?”
“Baking a cake,” Malfoy said scornfully.  “What does it
, Harry wanted to say, but didn’t.  Instead he put down the salve and opened the bottle with the orange liquid in it.  “Drink this.”
This sounded wise, now that they had said it. Previously, Harry wouldn’t have supposed that thinking about leaving the Academy could have anything to do with Draco Malfoy.
“What do you think I’ve been doing on this broom? Honestly, Potter, what were you thinking?”
“You’ll have fun if you ever do make Auror,” Ron went on. “The Force loves fresh meat who’s arrogant and thinks they know everything.”
Harry looked over the group of trainees, Malfoy lounging against the wall in the back, as though he hadn’t a care in the world. “Would everyone who hasn’t yet taken a turn come up, please?” Harry said.
Harry rolled his eyes again. “A Malfoy probably can’t even cast a Patronus.”
“That’s the spell we use to get places.”
“You never know.”  Malfoy put his stupidly straight nose into the air.
“Oh, do you mean Travers?” Harry asked. “That wasn’t destruction of property; that was blood supremacist bigotry. Glad I’m here to clean this up for you.”
“The very brave man.”
“Then was it . . .”  Draco licked his lips again.  “Was it because I stopped you from torturing someone?”
.  Murderer and a bigot and a—”
Harry leaned his head against the windowpane, feeling the cool glass.
“Your hair,” Malfoy began, then stopped.  His tone was completely different to what it had been.
“I think he’s fitter,” Vinicius insisted.

“Yes, though that’s hardly relevant to—”
“No bad dreams?”
you’ve been away, Potter, we’ve got seven open right now.”
“Can you sit here, please?” Mister Malfoy said, and Harry realized he’d forgot to look around.
“Thank you, Harry.”  Using his wand, Draco lit a fire underneath the pot, then started back over to his bench.
to school with me.”
Malfoy stood up, pacing over to the window. The breezy tone was gone, but his voice was still soft. “If I don’t, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life,” he said. “I already regret it. I’ve regretted it for—I wish I had been brave. I wish I had been a braver person, that I could face—well. I wish I could have faced things. Then.”
“Yes, it is!”  Malfoy’s horror seemed to be slowly morphing into panic.  “It is!  It’s a sickness!  You’re—you’re sick!”
Most of the furniture at Grimmauld Place was crap, but the couch was all right.  Luna had helped Harry pick it, which was why it had stage coaches and dogs and cabbages printed all over it, but it was very comfortable.  Carefully, Harry moved the floral chair over to a corner, so he could work on fixing it later, then moved the couch in front of the hearth, beside the little table.  “It appears to be a sofa,” Harry said, sitting down.  “I think if you sit on it, you’ll discover that it actually is one.”
Harry didn’t see Heloise, so he went to look at the photo album again, the one with Sirius Black in it.  The best photo of Sirius was one in which he was turning to smile rakishly at the camera, while the smaller boy Draco had said was Sirius’s brother waved his arms in the background.  The arm waving and something about the smile made it seem as though Sirius was about to do something devious.  The album also had Andromeda when she was young, but Harry wasn’t very fond of her, so he skipped over those to look at more pictures of Draco’s mum instead.
“All I did was put my thumb in,” Harry said, but he thought it was nice, the way Draco was holding his hand, gently rubbing it dry.
“I do many things,” Malfoy said lazily. “Ignoring you isn’t one of them.”
“And I didn’t fancy taking care of a ten-year-old once again, but here we are.”  Andromeda headed off toward the kitchen, and that was the end of that.
“But—”  Harry glanced at the door.
If anything, this seemed to make Malfoy even more angry.  “I see,” he said icily.
Rune’s face broke into another brilliant smile. “How about a dance?”
“Yeah,” said Savage.  “I’ll bet.  Come on, Potter.  That was what you needed.”  She started heading toward the door.
Mister Malfoy stood there for what seemed like a long time.  “All right,” he said, at last turning away.  Picking up Harry’s glasses—his new glasses, which Mister Malfoy had magically shrunk—he held them out.  “Put these on.”
“Well, not—not wholly. My father also hates it, and—fuck it. What’s the point?” Malfoy turned away, his shoulders a spiky little line. “You’re right, Harry Potter. You’re right; you’re fucking—you’re fucking
“As an Auror, I sometimes have to make sure people can’t recognize me,” Harry said.  “So, I know a bunch of glamours—just things to make you shorter or taller, change the colour of your hair, the length of your nose, that sort of thing.”
“No,” Andromeda said, paper rustling again.
“I need your hair,” Malfoy said from across the room, still not looking at him.
“Harry!”
“Don’t worry about the books, Harry.  That was . . . normal.”
Though this was a very Kavika question, Harry found himself frustrated by it. This wasn’t fair, because when Harry was with Kavika, he knew her well enough to trust her, and trusting her made him feel like he could share. “I don’t think there’s anything I can do,” he said at last, trying to share anyway. “Teddy is his own person. I have to let him be that.”
“All right, pretty. All right, I’ll give you my cock, just let me get it out for you.”
Tonight, Harry was trying to read
“Yes.  I’m probably the most discreet person you know.  I bet you never know what I feel at all.”
“I quite like your insides, though,” Harry pointed out.
“Tomorrow.”

“Is this some kind of kink of yours?” Draco asked, once Harry began to put the bandages on.
“Hilarious,” the man—Mister Malfoy—said.
“And later?”
“Exactly,” Harry agreed. “He’s not a natural. He worked at it. I think Malfoy could do anything, if he put his mind to it.”
“What do you think about revolution, Instructor Potter?” Suddenly, Malfoy swung to face Harry.
“Show it to me,” Harry said, and Malfoy at last took his hand off, baring his forearm for Harry to see. The skin was as clear as ever. It really was a well-made arm. Harry put his hand over where the Dark Mark used to be, and Malfoy gasped. Harry took his hand away. “Does that hurt?”
“Sure,” Malfoy told the reporters, finally coming to stand beside Harry, still without even looking at him. “I’ll even tell you all about the wedding. It’ll be the purest-blood ball of them all. Here,” he added, finally slipping his hand out of his pocket so that he could release the broom from under his arm. He held it out towards Harry. “This is for you,” Malfoy murmured, then turned back to the press. “I hear the wedding is the first time you’ll see the last three Ministers for Magic all in one place, since before the war,” he went on, then tilted his head, pretending to look thoughtful. “I should say: the last three, unless you count the Dark Lord as a Minister for Magic. I believe I heard that one is dead.”
“I like him too.  Not . . .”  Harry swallowed.  “Not the way I like you.”
Shacklebolt just nodded. “Keep me apprised as the situation develops.” Then the air cracked again, Shacklebolt disappearing into a shimmer and then nothing.
“Why wouldn’t he mean it?” Kavika said. “People have been in love with you before.”
Harry ignored the questioners, except the last one. “Really, Lee? You?”
“I mean,” Duggins said hastily, “do you want to talk about the trainee?”
Though laconic, there was a command in Pillwickle’s tone that drew Bickford to instant attention.
“He’s always getting things wrong, you see,” Alby went on.  “Or it’s possible he’s doing it deliberately—he
“Yes.” Harry tried to nod, but
“Harry, he’s our age,” Ron said. “It’s not like we’d be putting a trainee—”
“Sometimes it means not being true to yourself, but other times it can mean being respectful towards others.  Come, let me—”  Leaning forward, Draco started wiping Harry’s cheek with the napkin.
Harry’s hand squeezed.
The training room was long and open, with wood floors and mirrors along one side, which were helpful for correcting stances and demonstrating wand motions. “Well, of course,” Malfoy said, suddenly dropping his bag by the door and coming in farther. “If you want to do it naked; that’s fine. Nudity doesn’t bother me.” He sniffed. “It’s good for you.”
“Yes.  I had better not get
Harry realized their positions were reversed, now. Malfoy had been standing here, by the window, three years ago at the end of term, just after graduation. Harry had been standing where Malfoy was now. “I know what I feel now,” Harry said again. “I don’t know if you still feel the same, or—”
Malfoy stopped wiggling long enough for Harry told hold his wand steady.
Gradually, however, the scent of bacon and the sounds of something happening on the other side of the door lured him, and as there was nothing else to do in the bathroom, Harry finally opened the door and walked out of it.
She said it all so calmly, like a history text.  Harry swallowed hard.  “Was he—Draco said a bad man killed my parents.  Was it him—Voldemort?”
When they squeezed out again they were back in the room with the flower-print chair and the books everywhere, the fire still crackling merrily in the hearth.
The smile faltered.  “You fell asleep.”
Harry moaned to show he loved it.
Harry let him go.
“Harry.  Yes.”  Draco kissed him again.
“No,” Harry managed to say.  “So, the upshot is, I should have brought a salad.”
“Er.”  Harry’s stomach went tight.  “You didn’t—you’re not, are you?”
had claimed Narcissa had died of a broken heart, but people didn’t die from broken hearts.  Not really, and Harry hadn’t asked Draco what had really happened to her.  He hadn’t wanted to make Draco say it.
Ron’s lips pushed in deeper at the corners. “Somehow I think I’d manage.”
hard. “Try having it be Malfoy.”
worried he doesn’t need me,” Harry said. “I don’t know.”
“What?” Harry said blankly.
“This isn’t going to go well for Mister Parkinson,” Harry said, walking back to check that the Pensiwve had been cleared entirely. It was empty.
Harry, who had been working twenty-hour days helping non-magical people adjust, started awake at the sudden silence. The room was dim, Draco’s naked body a grey outline against a deeper darkness.
“Will you look at this filthy arse?” Draco said, and Harry realized Draco was behind him. Then Draco was slapping him—a hard, flat hand stinging across Harry’s right buttock.
The humour fell out of Malfoy’s face, but his voice remained light-hearted. “You’re asking because of who my father is.”
Andromeda’s hand fell.  “Very well then.  I shall be in the garden, should you require biscuits or companionship.”  She swept out of the room, leaving Harry in the sitting room with nothing but the glowing silver fawn for company.
Harry played with his teacup. “You don’t think I need to give her another chance?”
“I can’t very well now, can I?” Harry gripped Draco’s hips in turn, pulling Draco toward him so that the front of Draco’s trousers brushed against Harry’s softening cock. “You spent me.”
“Oh.”  Harry stayed hanging over the side.  “Were they fun?”
“Are you okay?  How are you feeling?”
Pointing his wand at the table, Draco cleared the jam and butter as well, turning to put them away.  Coming back to the table, he fussed with the placemat, cleaning it with his wand even though it didn’t look dirty to Harry.  Then he put his wand away, then took it out again.
just as true, and Harry had remembered Malfoy’s smile when Malfoy had defeated him in the sparring match. He’d looked so light, so free. He’d looked
“It’s,” Alby gasped, “Imperius,” he gasped again, “potion.”
He’d never seen her in his life, and he didn’t know her name, but Harry knew who she was.  She was Dudley’s wife.  She was holding Dudley’s child, and standing there beside her—that was Dudley.  He didn’t look or sound like Dudley, and yet the cadence of his speech was the same, the flavour of his movements.  The scowl on his face was heart-stoppingly familiar, and Harry couldn’t get over the fact that the man—the old man, with a wife, with a child, with thinning hair—he was Dudley.
“Careful. I hear such language is not quite . . . de rigueur, these days.”
. Why do you think I want to be an Auror in the first place?”
Harry had already thought about this. He’d thought about this too much, because Kavika had said he should first seek to acknowledge his feelings, then try to understand them. “I’m like his focus. Like he can’t interact with the rest of the world without me, like he can’t be him without—without loving or hating me, and it’s not fair. It’s not fair to me. I shouldn’t have to deal with it.”
“Malfoy,” Harry said, still feeling weary. “I don’t forgive you.”
Harry looked at the red and gold silk.  “It’s great,” he said, because it really was, even though Draco’s seemed less cartoonish and far more elegant.
“I suppose,” Draco said after a pause.
“Your father always wore it long.”
Harry knew he shouldn’t have said it.
“I forgot all about your Muggle relatives,” Andromeda said, looking thoughtful.  “I’m surprised they’re still around.”
In the kitchen, a pan of scones was floating out of the oven to hover over bacon frying itself on the cooker.  A bowl of cream and another bowl with berries were already on the table, and Draco was spelling plates, cutlery, and napkins onto the table.  “Would you like breakfast, Harry?” Draco said, as though nothing at all had happened.
“Just another thing gone wrong this millennium.” Penelope shook her head. “It has to start getting better sometime, doesn’t it?”

“It shouldn’t matter what they assume.”
“That’s it?”
that the whole institution is a pack of Muggle-loving Mud—”
Malfoy stared at him, that long, unblinking stare. “I know,” he said, nothing in his face moving besides those thin lips. He didn’t even blink.

“Harry,” said Molly, who knew he didn’t like to be Flooed at times like this, but who could also not just fucking
“Well,” Harry said, holding the book and feeling a little like when he was eleven and Hermione was scorning him for not having read
“Merlin’s beard!” said the blonde woman with the big eyes. “You’re Harry Potter!”
“Yes, well—”
Harry hesitated.  "Yes.  No."  He didn't know what he had come to say.  "I came to say—I forgive you.  Not because you deserve it.  I don't know; maybe you do, but that's not why.  I forgive you, because life's too short, and I don't want to be a person who holds grudges, and I don't want to be defined by . . . I don't want to be defined by anyone but me.  So I forgive you; that's what I came to say."
“So, like a supermodel then.”
“Come, Harry,” Draco said, turning away again.  “We’ll work on your feints.”
Harry finished, explaining that Malfoy still had not even passed Level One, couldn’t cast a Patronus, and furthermore was unnecessary for the purposes of infiltrating the Death Eater meeting. “If we really need to get the Ward Bore into the meeting,” Harry pointed out, “someone could Polyjuice as him.”
“Yes.” Harry crossed his arms again. “He hasn’t—he hasn’t done anything.”
“Hey,” said Teddy.
The flush was mounting high in Malfoy’s cheeks began to spread all over.
“He is my boss,” Draco said.
“Who are you?” said an imperious voice.
“And Father loves me, as well,” Draco went on.  “He loves me so much.  So much, he would do anything for me.  He just wants what’s best for me, and I—I’m going to disappoint him.”
This had the potential to get very ugly indeed.
“You would feel responsible?” said Kavika.
Harry wasn’t sure why Malfoy felt the need to tell him this now, but he waited and he listened.
—that was—at least—partly—true . . .
“It’s an Auror matter,” Robards said, pushing forward. “Harry Potter has no—”
Something caught in Harry’s chest. He tried to concentrate again, seeking Malfoy in the vision of his Patronus, but he’d lost focus completely. The Patronus had dematerialized, and he would need to cast it again.
“Draco.”  Harry closed his eyes.
“Can I shield and ward you, now?” he asked, trying not to sound wretched.
Harry picked up the bottle off the lab bench and put it into Malfoy’s hand.  “The powder,” Harry said.  “It’s making you want that.  If you fix it, it will go away.”
Shaking his head, Harry turned away, dismissing Malfoy with a hand. “I don’t care what your boggart is. I don’t care what your Patronus is; don’t disrupt my class again.”
Teddy was shaking his head, still scanning the street. “I put an anti-Apparition ward on him.”
Harry took a step to follow.
“Don’t twist my words,” Malfoy snapped. “We both know Granger’s the strongest one of us, naturally.”
“We don’t have principalities.”
Harry hadn’t meant it like that.  Christ.  “Malfoy—”
Mister Malfoy looked tired.  He looked really, really tired, and Harry wondered whether that was because Mister Malfoy thought Harry was pretending.
“Malfoy.” Harry went to him. “Draco.” He put his arm on Draco’s shoulder, and Draco looked up at him.
“Chief Robards,” Shacklebolt went on. “As Academy faculty, Instructor Potter serves as liaison to this office. He also—as you might recall—has personal experience with the Death Eaters who may be involved. He’s also Mister Malfoy’s instructor in Auror training, so I’m sure you can see the prudence of allowing Instructor Potter to serve in this mission as Mister Malfoy’s handler as well as I can. Can’t you?”
“Voldemort put part of his soul in me,” Harry said. “That’s as real a soulmate as you can ever get.”
“You knew for
Suddenly, Draco clutched Harry’s hand again, his hand claw-like.  Something in his face looked pained.  “Stay with me?” he panted.  “Through the next year?  I don’t want to wake up alone.”
“You certainly discriminate.”
exist to make my life horrible.  What was the point of that?”
Draco leapt to his feet as well.  “Why
The day had been warmer than it should but was already growing colder with the dipping sun; no breeze stirred the Timothy Tree or Malfoy’s hair, but Harry could feel the coolness in the air.
“But you would have thought about it.”
“Oh, the ones you’d expect,” Teddy said. “Though Instructor Savage used to like me.”
“You don’t have to do anything you don’t want,” Ron said. “Because we’re here. And Hermione’s supporters are here. And you can—we can all—we can do what we want. We deserve to do what we want.”
now, would you?”
“You taught me how.”
“It’s a bit intrusive isn’t it?  Like someone telling you that you can’t wear ribbons in your hair.”
Harry pictured himself, naked under the stream, nothing to look at. Nothing to do. Nothing to think about but himself, four-oh-eight in the morning. He was too tired to take a shower anyway.
“That’s not right,” Harry had said.
“Shut up,” Nyala said, slapping his arm. “We’re the neutral observers.”
to be, because there are so few pure-blood families left that they all need to mate and reproduce, propagate, and why? He doesn’t even believe in it, or if he does, he doesn’t want it. He doesn’t want it. Love isn’t enough.”
“What can I do with it?” Harry said, swishing the wand around as he had seen Mister Malfoy do.
“No.  I don’t think he would have.”  Draco’s arm stayed tight around him.
“Ron can take care of himself,” Harry said. Then he said, “I’m responsible for all the trainees. I’m an instructor. I’m meant to keep them safe”
,” he said.  “
“Dunno, could be high,” said Nyala. “The bloke who dumped him is dancing with the fittest Auror in the room.”
“Oh, yes,” Mister Malfoy said.  “Lots.
Then Malfoy was closest to the boggart, and the rats and their tea melted into Malfoy’s boggart.
Draco’s gaze darted up.  “Like me?”
“Did something change?”
“You want to . . .
“Both of them taught me magic.  Mum played Exploding Snap with me—and lots of other games as well.  Father taught me duelling.”
“Slowly, Harry.”
; I’m not pathetic.”  Draco appeared to be over his little outburst, moving on to curiosity.  “His name is Teddy?”
Harry frowned at her. “What’s that got to do with anything?”
!!!” Malfoy yelled.
“Seventeen years ago,” said Spragg.
“Well, at least I can correctly assess my progress.”
“I appreciate that you call them non-mags, instead of using slurs,” Spragg said.
The man stared down at him, so Harry stared back.  In addition to his notable hair-colour and slim figure, the man’s clothes seemed rather posh, despite being strange.  He had on grey trousers and a grey waistcoat with a blue shirt underneath it, a blue square in one of the pockets, and a silver chain  at his hip.
It reminded him of the way Malfoy had always been sweeping or scrubbing or stocking shelves when Harry had first seen him again at Slug and Jiggers—when Malfoy had looked just like a skeleton, and Alby was always saying awful things to him.  It reminded Harry of dark spaces and spiders and an ache in his stomach that wouldn’t go away.  Harry didn’t like to think of it.
“Yes.” Sitting up again, Malfoy gave an arrogant little roll of his shoulders. “I bet you’d like to know where.”
“At Hogwarts,” Mister Malfoy said.  “It’s nothing to be ashamed of.  You . . .”  Trailing off, he wet his lips.  “You always had strong magic.”
Harry turned to Teddy and Nyala. “You’re very quiet,” he said, underneath one of the older Aurors, who had taken up the thread of Rune’s conversation.
“You just need to keep moving the tails under the knife to ensure they’re the right length, and make sure your fingers don’t get caught.”
, Harry was going to say, then remembered Teddy instead of Rose.  When Teddy was angry, he yelled.  When he was listening to music, though, he ignored everyone.  It wasn’t malicious, Harry had learned; he simply turned the rest of the world off.
Harry jerked under him. “Please,” he begged. “Please.”
Malfoy just rolled his eyes.  “I’m not a vampire, Potter.”
“Say it again,” Malfoy breathed.
“How obsessed were you?”
Harry didn’t even try to block it.  He’d never been good at Occlumency, and he didn’t even particularly want to be, right now.  Instead he thought of Draco kneeling before him when Harry had had a cold, Draco listening to him while they tried out the Wood-Eye Lye.  He thought of Draco sitting before the fire, teaching Harry colour spells, then casting his Patronus.
“I don’t know.” Harry took off his glasses, Summoning the little red cloth Luna had once given him to clean them. “I don’t know, probably not. I—maybe I was an Auror too long. I saw too many blood supremacists; it makes me assume that anyone who talks about non-magical people as weak wants to enslave them all and torture them.”
Malfoy had found that feeling. Harry suspected he would never struggle to cast a Patronus again. “That was the only thing he was failing in class,” Harry said. “He should pass.”
“Get off me.”  Trying to push it off, Draco’s hand went right through it.  His lip curled in an ugly expression.  “Get it off me.”
,” said Penelope, instantly infuriated. “I’ve never forgiven him for failing Draco, the Old Blood stooge. Did you see how he didn’t even say anything about the Order?”
“I think so.”
have been that way.”
“Harry,” Draco breathed, wrapping his hand around them both.
and the wizard wireless, with only a few resurgences of interest here and there. The last time Harry had seen reporters gathered here had been Draco Malfoy’s first day at Academy. Hopefully, whatever the reporters were here for, it had nothing to do with Malfoy’s Patronus. Or Malfoy in general. Or Harry.
“What really happened to my parents?” Harry asked.  He’d been wondering about it since Draco had kept asking him about them the night before, and talking about their families reminded him.
Some of you will recognize that a scene in this chapter is inspired by this
cork.”
Harry didn’t know.  He didn’t know what he would like; he didn’t know anything.  Draco hadn’t told him
Draco must have found this amusing, because he smiled.  “No, not silver.”
The one good bit to come out of this realization was that Harry no longer desperately wanted to shag twenty-year-old-Draco, which was a relief.  Harry had never been attracted to someone this much younger than him before, and he didn’t like how lecherous it made him feel.
“That’s not what I meant, and you know it.”
Malfoy had said.
“I know,” Harry said, startled.
“Whinging about it.”
He couldn’t do something to help, though, because he was stuck in this house.  It wasn’t even in London.  Draco had said they were in Dorset, last night when they were lying on the bunk beds.  Draco had also told him he should get some sleep, but Harry had kept having questions, and Draco had answered all of them.  Or most of them, except now Harry didn’t even know if Draco had told him the truth.  And Harry had no idea where Draco had gone.
“I haven’t told him a thing,” Draco muttered, old-Harry’s voice making it sound like a growl.
“The problem is,” Robards went on, ignoring Harry, “every time we get a lead on an NDEs meeting, they know the second we Apparate anywhere even close, and they Apparate away before we can catch them. The wards are too good. The most we ever get is one or two, and we can’t arrest them for simple meeting—we have no proof of their crimes. But if we could get someone in there with a Ward Bore, Insight Contacts, maybe even a Hearing Raid . . . . If you go to the meeting and act like one of them, we’d finally keep the NDEs in one spot long enough to find out what they’re doing.”
Malfoy jerked back, almost violently. He seemed on the verge of hyperventilation. “But I had to—I had to rebuild every
“If I pass,” Malfoy agreed. “If I don’t, I’ll be at those centres every day, doing what I can. And if I do pass,” he went on, “I’ll still be doing what I can, whenever I can. Just as long as I’m doing something to help.”
Rombe Pickle was in the midst of an orchard; the apples were not quite ripe but would be in a few weeks, still hard and green now in their twisted branches. The stone house was on top of a little slope, at the bottom of which stood a knot of other stone houses and hundreds of apple trees all readying for autumn.
“Need another cock, Harry?” Draco said gently, still petting Harry’s hair with his free hand as Harry sucked.
Harry spelled the food off the floor onto the plate, then charmed it clean.  “I’ll just leave this in the kitchen under a warming spell for you,” he said, because Draco had obviously eaten some of the breakfast—though a precious little.
“The current Minister for Magic wishes to embrace non-magical people as our sisters and brothers,” said a booming, steady voice, cutting through the small chaos. “By joining the rest of the world and being a part of it, instead of holding ourselves separate and aloof, we can better understand our neighbours. And perhaps prevent war in the future.”
,” Draco cried.
Malfoy gave him a stare, the eerie one, eyes too intense for this early in the morning. “You do think I did it. Of course. I should have signed my work; I should have thought my elegant penmanship would have been recognizable to—”
Draco gave him a small but definite smile.  “The food is not going to disappear,” he said.  “You can chew.”
“I just wanted a chance to read to find out what was going on.”  Harry just hoped that Draco didn’t remember that there had been a letter also.  There was no way he was ever going to let Draco’s younger self read it.  “That’s about the cure to age you up,” Harry said, nodding at the ledger in Draco’s hands, “so you should read it now.”
Malfoy’s cheeks were still pink, but his eyes almost seemed to flash. He straightened his shoulders. “Yes. It’s something I want. It’s something I—yes. I wanted to help. For when we—when Reveal happens.”
“How do you feel about that? What Draco said to you?”
Harry looked up at the man.  “Is that what we’re calling kidnapping these days?”
Draco’s eyes darted toward Alby, and Harry’s heart froze for a moment in his chest.  When it unfroze it beat too rapidly, filling Harry up with the need to touch Draco all over again.
“I’ll go as slow as you want me to,” Harry said, keeping his voice slow just for good measure. Then he put his lips by Draco’s ear. “But if you want to come fast that just means I’ll get to make you come more. Over and over.”
“Harry was right,” said Andromeda.  “I should not have told your secrets.”
“If you want me to tell you you’re tops at potions every time we meet,” Harry said, settling in in front of his Pensieve, “you’re going to have to wait.”
“What did you like about being needed?” said Doctor Yin. “Maybe we can start there.”
“Well,
“Yeah,” Harry said, after another moment. “I guess Draco Malfoy seems petty in comparison.”
“Like—I could blow up?” Harry said, very interested in this, despite the possibility of not surviving.
Harry set the ledger down.  Taking off his glasses, he rubbed his eyes.  His head hurt from concentrating.
“He failed,” Dumbledore said, and Harry remembered Malfoy, shaking as he faced Dumbledore on the Tower. The memory faded, and Dumbledore vanished.
Another quill rose above the cubicles so it could float to Draco’s hand, but Draco began walking swiftly in that direction, so Harry followed.  They came to yet another desk, which Draco searched just as he had the last.  He made that quill write things as well, took the paper it wrote on, then returned everything to look as it had been.  Then Draco took Harry’s hand again and squeezed it.  “Just one more thing, Harry.  You’re doing so well.”
“It is a telephone,” Draco said.  “It can hold pictures, too.”
“You mean because you don’t get to blame him anymore.”
Harry felt like he could lose himself in petting Draco’s hair.  He thought that he could do it forever, and then he thought of those lonely nights at Grimmauld Place.  This would be enough activity for Harry—just getting to touch Draco like this.  It would have absorbed him completely, he wouldn’t need anything else.
Malfoy looked away, sniffing arrogantly. “I was in her lap. She’s telling me I’ll have a wonderful time at Hogwarts. I’ll make plenty of friends. I’ll do so well, and impress everyone, and—there. Is that one you wanted? Irony?”
Malfoy lingered. “Do you need . . . ?”
“What else did your parents do?  Did they teach you magic?  Did you play Exploding Snap with them?  Did you . . .” Harry tried to think of other things that wizards did.  “Duel?”
Harry thought Narcissa was fucked up about being decorous.  Being kind wasn’t about hiding who you were, it was about being
Harry turned around to see what was happening, but someone was grabbing his arm.  “Harry!”
Harry tried to concentrate once more on his Patronus, its filmy, silver vision showing him Malfoy with his own crowd of eager non-magicals.
“I don’t want him to have nothing,” Harry heard himself say.
Harry spent a few days of the week before term started with Vinicius, who was an attentive lover and an excellent cook, but seemed rather too interested in Harry’s Auror exploits and heroic deeds as a seventeen-year-old for Harry’s comfort. As with most of his other partners, Harry was reluctant to spend the night, as he was more prone to nightmares whilst sleeping beside another person, and he didn’t exactly feel comfortable at the prospect of explaining them to yet another person who didn’t understand them.
“Here, here,” said Adebayo’s girlfriend, whose name Harry still didn’t know.
?” Ron had said.  “He’s a field Auror!  Shouldn’t he be in the field?”
“I meant,” Malfoy began, then stopped.  He didn’t look snobbish any longer, just miserable all over.
After blowing his nose, Draco looked up at him with watery eyes.  “He was?”
Fuck.  Harry didn’t understand what Malfoy’s problem was, and Harry didn’t want to deal with it.  He didn’t want to deal with Malfoy’s ridiculous mood swings and his tetchy defensiveness and his horrible sensitivity, because the pain in Harry’s chest still ached and he didn’t like it.  He didn’t like dealing with this sort of thing.  Swiping the bottle off the table, Harry put it in his pocket.  “I have to go take care of this,” he said.  “If there’s more of it out there, it will cause problems.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Alby said, “but Aurors paying upstanding shopkeepers under the table sounds a lot like bribery, and bribery is something I would certainly report to Head Auror—”
“Where’s Travers?” called Harry.
In the end, Harry spent the evening with the most logical choice, someone he should have known to call all along, someone who always understood him and always cared.
“Ew, Potter, no,” Draco said, squirming under him.  “You’ve appalling taste.”
“I just meant, you first met Icarus at Hogwarts. Obviously, you’re more than school friends.”
“You want me to speak up in class?”
Even pushing open the door was a breath of fresh air, the cool airy atmosphere of the long stone hallway instead of that hot room, packed with too many hot voices.
Harry’s smile fell away.  “He doesn’t have a wife.”
Harry thought about the topical analgesic, since he truly did feel poorly.  It would probably ease the ache in his throat, or at least alleviate the cough.  Harry thought about how Malfoy said he would rub the cream onto Harry’s throat, and then he did what Malfoy had told him to do and went away.
“How are you feeling?” Kavika sat on her couch, looking both poised and relaxed, comfortable in this perfect little parlour where Harry felt safe from the world. “About people being in love with you?”
Draco turned to look at him.  “I meant older-you.  He was depending on me.”
“I’m thirty-one,” Harry said, then Apparated downstairs to get changed.
Draco stared at him.  “Potter,” he said, then seemed like he had to start again.  “Potter, do you really think my fetish for green eyes began when a potion turned me into an eleven-year old?  It began when I was
Harry checked the bedroom, but the bed didn’t look slept in, so when Harry took the stairs it was two at a time.
Malfoy put the plate under what looked like a microscope.  “Then how is it being used?”
Harry frowned. “I’m not seeing evidence of it.”
“No, Harry,” Draco said.  “I . . . thought I wanted to, once, but I was very much a coward.  You can talk to snakes, by the way.”
Dazedly, Draco blinked his eyes.  His lips were wet and red from kissing, just like a movie as well.  Even with his sallow skin, pulled tight over his sharp features, even with the hollows under his eyes and that dull hair, he was beautiful.  “Have you reconsidered the dry humping?” Draco said, sounding dazed as well.
Harry wanted Ron and Hermione so desperately it hurt.
Draco just looked at him.
“Besides,” said Felixana Bole, a Councillor strongly opposed to Reveal. “Some of the New Blood has found the key to quick and easy happiness through destruction of our traditions. How can we continue to have happy memories when we see our way of life eroding away before our eyes?”
“Yes,” Harry said, but then couldn’t think of what else to say. His brain was still stuck.
.  Lee Jordan had begun working there two years ago.
“I’ve gone and shocked you,” Draco said.
That night Harry had bad dreams. In them was someone he desired, someone who made him ache, but every time he touched them, he began to bleed. At first the cuts were little, as though the person were a parchment and he was too sharply swiping his finger against the edge of them. He ignored the scratches, thinking he was only being careless, but then the wounds grew deeper. “You’re hurting me,” Harry told the person.
“Then what are you trying to do?”
“He’s always been a sanctimonious prick,” Malfoy agreed. “If it’s any consolation, most of the other instructors have been treating him like the absolute shite he is. Not even all the trainees are worshipping at his feet these days. Poor little Potter. I daresay coming to work these past few weeks have been a proper misery.”
“Good morning, Harry,” Draco said, smiling.
“This reminds me,” Ron said, glancing around. “I should check with Hermione. I likely have schmoozing to do.”
,” Savage snapped. “
“Well, I can’t,” Harry said, reaching for the door.
Harry smiled.  “She likes you a lot.”
This time, Harry knew why Malfoy looked so surprised.  “You can resist Veritaserum.”  Then he rolled his eyes.  “Obviously.  I should have known.”
Draco stared at him for a moment, the silver fox uncurling and letting out a big yawn.  “I really do mentor you on the ways of having parents, don’t I?” he said, but his voice was not unkind.  “In the scheme of things, it’s more important that Mother have a roof over her head than be proud of me.  It’s more important that she have food to eat and the cushions she likes and the robes she—Potter.  If I had to prostitute myself to every Muggle on the street so that she could have her bonbons, I’d do it.”
“Thanks.” Hermione smirked. “Now, you’re going to keep looking, aren’t you?”
“Then what happened?”
you the powder didn’t have an effect on the one wearing it.”
are you?”
“You’ve found a dark object, then?” Harry asked.
As the trainees continued to practice the holds, Malfoy and Teddy continued to perform a cut above the rest, and Harry thought about what he would do for any other trainee who was doing particularly good work. He’d been walking between all the pairs of sparring partners, helping them with their techniques and offering pointers. When he finally came to Malfoy and Teddy, he stopped.
Kavika had told him.
Harry nodded.
Harry snorted. “Stalk me? The wards can be adjusted if I invite someone over.”
“It’d all been cleaned up.”
Having established a correspondence by owl with Malfoy was convenient.  Over the next year, Harry owled Malfoy potions to ID from time to time, though Harry still visited plenty in emergencies or when he thought the case needed more explanation than could be conveyed by note.  Or when it was late and no one else was in the office, and Harry thought Malfoy would be awake.
“All right,” Harry said, because if it made Draco feel this badly, he could avoid it.
“Um.”  The man was obviously mental, and somehow he had a remote control flamethrower , but Harry tried to be polite, particularly with adults who were scary.  “Have you gone mental?” he asked politely.
“Um.” Harry took a step back.  “It’s for me.”
“I thought it’s because you wanted to be an Auror.”
Malfoy’s eyes had been looking through him, a bit; now they snapped back, boring holes through Harry’s.
Once the Life Water was added to the potion Draco had prepared, the cure would take a full twelve hours to mature, after which the cure had to be administered all at once.  Frowning, Harry pulled the ledger closer to read more carefully.
“Because—” Draco gulped.  “Because of me?”
“Hidden signatures?” Harry asked, the first time Malfoy had brought it up.
never killed anyone.”
in the sparring match. Malfoy was taking care of
It looked like Malfoy was preparing to do something to the Wood-Eye Lye.  “Can’t you just . . . I dunno, taste it?”
next, then
Kavika obviously guessed, her steady look of appraisal making Harry regret the turn of the conversation even more. He wasn’t ready to talk about Teddy being an Auror again; he’d said all he could say. “Will you talk to Teddy about it?”
Malfoy’s eyes went large, his mouth falling open a bit.  “Do you mean I can—”  But then Malfoy snatched the wand, as though Harry might take it away.  “Of
“The depths are stirred with other partners?”
“Of course, it’s the end of the world,” a woman screamed. “They could kill us all with the flick of a stick!”
“No,” Draco said, “but I know about them.”
A wave of relief. Then a knot in his stomach.
Malfoy’s gaze passed into thoughtfulness, but something about this expression was almost tender, and he was still looking at Harry.
“I will next time.”
“And you have to be nice to it.”
Draco let him, and for Harry, getting something on his tongue was like heaven. The smell of it. The tenderness of it, the hardness of it. The way it grew harder and harder as Draco stroked his wand beside Harry’s face, where Harry was intently licking on the cock in the way he was allowed. Harry’s mouth had never been so wet. And then he got to lick the tip, but there was no pre-come.
“Don’t bother about the books,” Mister Malfoy said abruptly, coming closer and taking the book.  “Have a sit.”  He crossed the room to pull out a chair at the table.  “My mum always gave me warm milk went I went off.”
“How well you know me, Harry,” Draco murmured.
“Oh,” Malfoy said, glancing down at the bottle as if he’d forgot it was in his hand.  He set it down on the lab bench.  “I’ll probably cast a containment field and look at it in a bubble.”
“Very,” Harry said, giving Draco his hand.  Together, they Apparated away.
It took a while of fucking for Harry to process this, and then he still couldn’t. “Another what?”
Right after Harry had taken off Malfoy’s Dark Mark.
Robards gave Shacklebolt a weak smile. “It’s not really a Minister matter.
Harry whined again, sucking hard, arching his back and thrusting into the air behind him to get more of that faux cock.
“I couldn’t concentrate.”
“Zidwidley collected my indicator solution a few months ago,” Harry said.  “You know how Robards always wants any unauthorized brews under lock and key.”  Dammit.  Harry was going to have to go to Malfoy for more.
“I tried everything.”
“I wasn’t panicking,” Harry said, moving to set the milk and phial on the table so he could help pick up the books.
“The only one I needed studying for was yours,” Malfoy said, not looking up from his diagrams. “Look how well that turned out.”
“Why did you cast it if you didn’t even—what the fuck is wrong with you?”
for this.  And you’ve got Hornley!”  Stuffing
to solve problems and stop dark arts—that anyone has bothered to figure it out!”
“It’s not a mechanism to make you dislike Malfoy as he is now,” Yin said. “It’s a mechanism to compare the person you once knew and the person you know now in a clearer way. You may find by comparing the memory with the real thing, you can leave the past behind—or you may instead find that the past is still with you. If it’s still a part of you, it may not be something healthy to part with—it may be healthier to find a partner who isn’t Draco Malfoy. Either way, you wanted to find out.”
“You have that, ‘I may leave society and become a hermit for a thousand years’ look on your face,” Ron said, grabbing Harry’s elbow, pulling him away.
“Instructor Potter has a statement to make,” Lee Jordan said loudly.
“Merlin’s toadstools.”  Malfoy pushed him away.  “You’re no fun.”
Draco’s face went a bit pale, his eyes beginning to flash, and now Harry recognized Draco’s anger when he saw it.  “That whole bit about being friends—that was a lie as well?  You didn’t tell me about my
Harry was aching, his cock hard enough to hurt, leaking at the tip, and he was with Draco—Draco with his teasing little smiles and his insanely good looks, Draco who was so fiercely protective and so hopelessly loving, who was so smart, so clever, who hadn’t been able to stop fucking boys even though he’d tried, who’d had a Muggle boyfriend named Rohit.
Malfoy had said that dancing would be like
Hermione frowned.  “Did Malfoy do something?”
Robards gave his sick smile, absolutely hating this. “Of course.”
“What I said,” Nyala said. “About loving him.”
Harry let Bickford’s voice ring out without turning to face him. He took a breath, then another, then finally turned to Bickford. When he spoke, his voice was quiet. “You want to honour our traditions? Let your instructors pass the people who pass their class. Malfoy did well enough on the examination; combined with my newly obtained knowledge of his ability to cast a Patronus, he’s done well enough to graduate to Level Two.”
Harry entered the cloakroom to find Malfoy facing the empty pegs on the stone wall, where trainees hung their cloaks and books, above which were placards with the trainees’ names. Today, above the placards, scrawled in a thick, messy brown substance that had been wet once, but now was dry and flaking, read the words
, Draco had told him.
“Do you mean—fish and chips like they have at the Leaky Cauldron?”
?” Draco said, his voice at a dangerous pitch.  “Don’t you
Harry’s hands moved to Draco’s hips, moving a little closer to line them up with his own. “Do you want to?” he asked. He’d leaned in to Draco’s ear to whisper, but Draco’s pale skin was there, the elegant line of his neck under his jaw. Harry put his mouth there, beneath Draco’s ear, and Draco made another sound. “Can I?” Harry asked, his hands moving to the fastening of Draco’s trousers.
“I know.”  Draco started petting his hand, just like Hermione had done.  “I know that now, but—I didn’t then.  I was—I was—it hurt so
For the infraction of breaking Robards’ asinine policy against communicating with Death Eaters, Harry was desked for a month.  For the further infraction of threatening an innocent (“Innocent, my arse,” said Savage) shopkeeper, Harry was desked a second month.
“Come with you to make sure Astoria’s father isn’t terrorizing her?”
“Harry’s trying to have emotions,” Andromeda said.  “Let the poor boy have them.”
“Shocked. I’m shocked!”
Harry played a card, and Draco played another on top.  Harry played one on top of that, and it was a snap, so he kept going.  Draco was silent as Harry played the next three cards.  “Your turn, now,” Harry said, when the series was done.
“But you’ve finally learned not to.”
“Aunt.”  Draco made a hissing sound.
“I can’t understand what you mean. The whole world’s going perfectly. Reveal’s in the toilet; we’ve lost Shacklebolt, and the Council might appoint a criminal of war. What’s not to love?”
“But . . .”  Objections were swirling around in Harry’s head, and he was having trouble pinning one down.  “You drank something.  With my hair in it.  Isn’t that why you’re resistant?”
“Am I allowed to eat it?” Harry said, trying not to sound too excited.
Draco had told him, but Harry couldn’t bear to tell younger Draco the truth.  He couldn’t bear it; Harry’s heart would break in half, and he didn’t know what would happen to Draco’s.  Certainly, he wouldn’t be sitting here with Harry in front of the fire.  Draco wouldn’t want to be near Harry at all, and Harry didn’t know whether adult-Draco would want to after this either.
“I said go away!”  Malfoy flung his arm out, but he had to bring his face up to do it, and Harry saw it—Malfoy’s red eyes, his red face, every part of him puffy from crying.

“Where’s Robards?” Harry asked, an uncomfortable feeling beginning to crawl up his spine.
Instead of falling, the chandelier floated above everyone, a minor Christmas miracle.
Kavika had been in Beirut almost the whole summer, as she had most of the spring, only returning briefly shortly after graduation for one session before returning to her daughter, Nadia. Laila, Kavika’s granddaughter, was having developmental difficulties, Kavika had told him after graduation. Nadia had been seeking out her mother for both physical and moral support, and as a result, Harry had been seeing Kavika less often. She had called him today for a special session—not one of their usual ones, she had said, as she had something about his treatment she wished to discuss.
Thank you again to buildyourwalls, icmezzo, seraphcelene, and siemejay. <3
But who else? These were important questions to ask. Harry went through the list. Luna, Neville, Molly, Andromeda and Teddy, Hagrid. He had wondered sometimes if he might add Ginny to this list. He wanted her, suddenly, powerfully—someone who had understood him, someone to whom he had been a whole world. Was this because of Vinicius? Harry didn’t know. He should eat something. Maybe he was hungry. Maybe he and Ron and Hermione could have dinner. Maybe they could get takeout. He could get curry. It was eight o’clock. Dinner for the Weasley-Grangers was usually around six-thirty. They would have Hugo. Harry didn’t know if he wanted to see Hugo. Harry didn’t know if he wanted curry. Maybe a pasta. He wanted those quiches Malfoy had brought for him that night they brought the memory to the Department. How had Malfoy known he hadn’t eaten?
Harry stared at him, Draco’s tense little back.  The tips of his ears were red, and Harry didn’t really know what Draco was asking, but he was sure Draco himself didn’t quite know what he was asking either.  Earlier, Harry had been convinced Draco was asking whether his grown-up self was sleeping with Harry, but this seemed different.  Draco wanted to know whether Harry cared for him, and yet it still seemed to embarrass him.  Possibly with Lucius discouraging anything remotely homosexual, he’d also censured discussions of feelings.
Harry finally opened the door, looking around to assess. No one seemed to have noticed his absence. The party was still going on. No one seemed to have noticed he had returned, either. People were facing in his direction, and yet their eyes seemed to pass right over him. Frowning, Harry turned back to the men’s. It was easy to see why no one paid him any mind. Even the door itself was hard to see, wreathed as it was in Notice-Me-Nots. Harry turned back to the hall.
“You can’t get it to look nice,” Harry explained.
“I do!”  Draco was shaking.  “I do! I—
“Yeah.” Harry’s hand moved over his fist. “I don’t get to be discreet.”
“But he’s in love with you,” Kavika pointed out.
“You’re saying I don’t trust my friends?”
“Oh, yes.  He was annoyed that you seemed to be the only one good enough at potions to help the department.”
“Let’s take a look at those memories,” Harry said.
“Malfoy,” Harry said, not meaning to sound sharp but sounding that way anyway.  “Stop.”
“I promised I’d protect you,” Harry said, feeling panic slowly clawing its way into his chest. He’d made a promise. He’d made a
“Maybe we shouldn’t produce too much excitement,” said Teddy. “There’s going to be a lot of it going around.”
“I was just getting—ingredients for my potions!”  Alby looked excited about this explanation.  “For my little shop!  How do you think I get ingredients for my little shop?  They’re in that warehouse!”
Disbelieving, Harry looked at their dead bodies. “But how did it happen?”
“Oh,” Harry said.
“Oh.  Where would I go?”
Malfoy to look at him, not his coffee. Harry brought the coffee to his lips again, and Malfoy looked away. He slipped his hands into his pockets. “You know that legend about the Timothy Tree, that only the most virtuous trainees can climb it?”
“Best stay there, Harry. Everywhere is blowing up; we need people all over, not just in London.”
“Pity.”
“Well,” Malfoy said again, then didn’t say anything else.  Suddenly, he swooped toward his little tray and grabbed a bottle of blue stuff.  “This is an indicator solution,” he said, not looking at Harry.  “You put your thumb in it, and we’ll use it to determine whether you’ve had a certain kind of poison.”
“Where?” said Bloomenthal.
“I thought the Order of the Phoenix was the Shacklebolt organization,” said Penelope, frowning.
or other, but Harry hadn’t made a point to seek it out.
Harry scrawled in the margins as she spoke, then said “Thanks,” when she was done.
“Draco,” Harry said, reaching out.
“Questions like that,” Harry pointed out.  “He thought people would say stuff like that to him.”
After arguing with Vance, Harry Apparated straight from the Auror Office into Malfoy’s sitting room.
It started out that way, Harry’s thumb brushing the corner of Draco’s jaw, just under the ear, stroking along Draco’s jaw to his mouth.  Harry leaned in, angling his face so they didn’t bump noses.  His lips gently brushed Draco’s, and Draco made a little gasping sound, letting his mouth fall open.  So Harry did it again, brushing Draco’s mouth with his, gently pulling Draco’s lower lip with his own lips.  But Harry could have more; Draco was opening his mouth against Harry’s, and Harry could have it, so Harry opened his own mouth and kissed him deeper.
“Yes, Harry.”  Draco smiled faintly.  “Like I taught you.”
Malfoy nodded again, sharp, decisive. “Split up—take my Patronus; give Teddy yours; that way we stay in touch. Expecto Patronum!” Silver spooled from Malfoy’s wand, materializing into the tiny bee, but Malfoy was already Apparating to grab a non-mag and Disapparate them out of the way of an exploding Wheeze.
“Liked him, did you?”
Robards began to say, “This is all very dramatic—”
at Windermere Hall. What is the world coming to?”
Lee said.
“So, it’s more a friends-with-benefits sort of thing.” Milligan was nodding. “That’s really okay, Harry. Lots of people have that sort of relationship. It’s perfectly adult.”
Malfoy leapt off the broom, graceful since childhood but also from the too many years of Defensive Flying Baggot had forced him to repeat. He whirled to face Harry, eyes blazing. “What do you mean by that?”
towel.”  He cleaned his hands as Draco sat up.
Ron gave him one of his encouraging smiles. “It’s okay, Harry.”
Malfoy swallowed. Then he flashed a smile so brilliantly genuine, it absolutely had to be false. “I will be there.”
“The Malfoy child can have his own political opinions, of course,” Pillwickle said, stately and solemn.
, Kavika had once said. Harry thought about it. “We could talk about my boyfriend?”
Draco caught the Snitch three times after that.
Malfoy made a little whining sound.
“Who?” Harry asked, feeling just a little overwhelmed.
“Queen Al
.  Yes.”  Mister Malfoy turned back to his notes, sounding even more amused.  “You can do magic.”
“Go on, sweetheart,” Draco said, his hands moving harder. “Come for me while I touch you, while I take care of you; I’m never going to stop; I love you; I love you.”
“Now, Harry,” said Mister Malfoy.
“Thanks,” Harry said, picking up another mini-quiche. This one had tomato. “These are really delicious.”
than capable of ascending to Level Two—”
“Do you really think they would allow me to become an Auror if I had said anything else?”
“I like your hair,” Harry said.  Teddy’s hair was curly and green today, shaved on half his head.  He had on ripped-up jeans and a black t-shirt with some kind of band on it, probably a Muggle one.  “How was Hogwarts this year?”
They stood there, Harry on the stoop and the man just outside of it, the frown smoothing out of the man’s face almost in slow-motion, as though he was realizing something one thought at a time.  When his face finally stopped its incremental fall, the man looked almost soft, his eyes somehow shining in the dim light of the street.  Then he swallowed hard.  “Oh,” he said, quietly.
They ate.
“Go away.”  Malfoy’s back was still turned, but every part of him radiated displeasure, from the set of his shoulders to the fist by his thigh.
to say it,” Harry said.
“But you don’t think it plays a role in your prejudice against him?” said Fudge.
“You already said that.”  Draco looked away, toward the sofa cushion.
,” he said, taking a step back.
me.  Except when I was a baby.  I mean, that would be weird.  But we used to—well, never bother.  I’ve got my hair cut, and Malkin’s going to be making me a whole new wardrobe as well as my school robes—you know Malkin, of course?”
Harry had to get half-way across the room before he reached the entrance, and for a moment, the rest of the room seemed frozen solid. Everyone knew that Teddy had graduated Academy but then chosen not to be an Auror, taking several of the graduates with him on his path to creating the new Order of the Phoenix. A few Aurors had quit to join him, and people like Savage saw the Order as a rogue vigilante terrorist group hellbent on destroying magical institutions. No one was talking to Teddy and Nyala.
“The culprit has been found,” Harry said. “They were a trainee.”
“Not right now,” Draco said.  “I thought that once you’re older and need to look for the final ingredient, these documents might help your search.”
“Well, Harry,” Andromeda said, putting out her hand.  “It’s been very nice getting to know you at this age.  You’re a lot more emotionally intelligent than I expected.”
Concentration broken, Harry snapped back into the orchard, where the crowd had separated him from Nyala. Weaving amidst the crowd, Harry made his way back to her side as non-magicals shouted questions.
“But you’re so—”
“The powder.”  Harry really should have extracted himself from Malfoy’s arms, which were still around him, but he couldn’t find the wherewithal to do it.  It must have been the powder.  “It’s an aphrodisiac.  A love potion.  Something like that.”
Harry swallowed hard.  “Some boys who didn’t like you in school may learn to love you after it.”
“Merlin,” Mister Malfoy murmured.  “I thought my memory had exaggerated how obtuse you were.  No wonder we never got on.”
“There, you see?”  Draco lifted his chin up some more.  “
, had all published front page articles about Draco Malfoy’s infiltration of a Neo Death Eater ring at Windermere Hall, blowing wide any possible follow-up uncover work Malfoy could have done. Harry felt fine about that. Malfoy wasn’t an Auror—not yet, though he would be if Harry had any say about it. Apparently, the Board of Regents thought he didn’t.
“He hasn’t been following me,” Harry said. “He’s done nothing so far this term. Nothing.”
“I’m serious.”
“Harry.” Kavika seemed to hesitate. “There’s no need for you to make allowances for Draco Malfoy. Like you said—there’s no reason for you to have thought about him at all.”
“I work here,” Harry said, his voice stiffer than he meant it to be.
“Fuck you,” Malfoy said.  Grabbing the bottle out of Harry’s hand, Malfoy threw it at the rubble of his former home, where it smashed into dozens of pieces and splattered green potion everywhere.  “Fuck you, Potter.  Fuck your potions, fuck your fucking Auror uniform, fuck your stupid scar, your clueless—” Malfoy gulped for air.  “Clueless—” he tried to say, but he didn’t finish, choking on another sob.
“I’ve seen it before,” said Chan.
“I say,” Draco said again.  “Is there something wrong with you?”
“Shit,” Harry said, darkness and cold settling in over his shoulders.
Harry didn’t.  “What about the kids who aren’t pure-bloods who read?”
, and Harry never wanted him to. That was the whole point.
“Well,” Vinicius said, breaking off his story, turning to follow Harry’s gaze. “I can see how he’s very distracting. He’s still remarkably fit. I think I might go give it a go, if you know what I mean.”
“I know that.” Swallowing, Harry shifted his weight. “I wanted to defend you too.”
In front of him, Draco had powders and seeds and things that looked like mouse ears, but Harry didn’t know what any of it meant.  He noticed, however, that Draco seemed tired.  Harry hadn’t seen it earlier because he’d just woken up, and then he’d been so hungry.  He should have noticed because Draco had said,
Harry took the potion back.  “That was quick.”
“You shouldn’t have to save the—” Harry had stood up, turned around to face Teddy—whose face had changed to look exactly like Harry had, when he was seventeen. “World,” Harry said, his heart breaking.
“What are you saying?” Harry asked.  “I thought I was meant to be thirty-one, and that’s how I ended up here.”
“Tell our guest, Harry Potter, what you do here, working for me,” said Alby.
of the name, ugh.  There’s so much you have to learn.
“Draco.”  Harry stood up.  “Please don’t call him names.”
“From the Fountain of Youth?” Draco jumped up.  “They’ve found it?  Someone’s found it?  You’ve got to—no, wait, don’t tell
“Stop moaning,” Malfoy said, after another minute.
Harry reached for his coffee again, running his finger up the side of the cup, feeling the warmth through the pounded copper. “Maybe he didn’t,” he said at last. “Do it just for my attention, I mean. Maybe he—he was just . . .”
“How do you know?” Malfoy said, his voice lofty.
For some reason Draco’s words were the hottest thing that Harry had ever heard, and so he swallowed the wet in his mouth and did exactly what Draco said: posted his pretty cunt back onto Draco’s cock, hard.
Draco lifted his hand to bring more jars over with his wand, but Harry grabbed his other hand.  “You’ve got to promise,” Harry said.
Malfoy said nothing more, and the door only made a soft click to signify he had gone. Harry could think of nothing he wanted more than a shower, as if hot water could make his exhaustion slip away, and stop him from remembering Hogwarts—how it felt to quarrel with Malfoy in the corridors. The blood dripping down the stones, students turned to stones as well, the Inquisition Squad on patrol, the sickly stench of Snape’s classroom, the warmth of Dumbledore’s office. Dumbledore and death, so many dead.
“Draco,” Harry said, once they were both lying in the dark.
Then it dawned on Harry, that Teddy didn’t know. He didn’t know about blood on the walls and the Chamber of Secrets; he hadn’t been there in a circle of Death Eaters when Cedric had died; he hadn’t watched Nagini slither out of someone who should have been a woman; he hadn’t been at the trials, with Charity Burbage floating above a table. Teddy knew about the war, but he didn’t
Draco waved his wand again, extinguishing the fire.  “Mum used to do this spell for me at night,” Draco said, looking up at the stars.  Their light made his face look pale in the dark room.  “Her side of the family all has celestial names.”
Mister Malfoy smiled.  “Had enough at last?”
, the ghost had said, but Harry was beginning to think that “old enough” might be never.
“Did he make you breakfast?”
Thinking of something, Draco straightened up again.  “Do
They’d talked more about it. She’d asked him for names of his other friends. He’d told her she could look at the
“I’ll go with you,” Harry told Ron.
“Auror Potter,” Alby said, wheezing for breath and sounding a little squeaky.  “Am I under arrest?”
“That can’t be true,” said Adebayo.
“Maybe he has less to lose by being wrong.”
Malfoy’s lips pressed together, his eyes a little too large in comparison to the vitriol that had been spilling out of his mouth not moments ago.
“Not a trick question,” Yin said, and the very real quality of their voice as well as the light trace of humour in it snapped Harry back into the present. “Maybe you can tell me about the dream. If you want, I can tell you about mine with Nearly Headless Nick—but you might have to get a few extra therapy sessions after hearing about it, sorry.”
“Yeah.” Harry rubbed his hand some more. “The Deal.”
Malfoy’s mouth turned into a small, surprised smile, gentle in a way that did a kindness to his face. Then he looked back toward the pub. “I had better get back.”
Kavika gave him an arch look. “Then we should be grateful you find him so easy to read. I have barely any experience with Draco, but the father—I would not say he’s terrific at Occluding, but still, he can be inscrutable.”
“But how could you not . . .”  Draco’s face was splotching up with colour.  “I mean.  Didn’t you . . . ?  And, and Oliver Wood.  You said—and he was—I thought you meant—?”
Afterwards, Draco said he needed to look at the files.  In the spirit of helping, Harry read a few of them, but after two or three of them he gave up.  Draco was going to read them anyway; he could just tell Harry what they said.  Maybe if they got in trouble, Harry could help with magic, so he decided to practice the spells he’d learned over the last week.  In the evening, Harry got to have more chicken salad and beef wellington, and then Draco made them biscuits and tea.  After dessert, Harry thought they might do something fun like they usually did, but instead Draco said he had to read more of the papers.
Teddy nodded, still seeming so thoughtful. “Fellow,” he finally said.
“You’re smart,” Harry said.  “You persevere.  You’re creative.  And you’re loyal.”
“This is some kind of psychological torture,” Draco announced.  “If I had my wand I’d Legilimens you and find out what’s really going on.”
Harry remembered how Draco had taken those hairs.  He had also brewed the Polyjuice, sometime when Harry hadn’t seen it.  He’d been planning the trip to the Ministry, and brewing the cure, and being a Death Eater.  Harry didn’t know what else.  “Okay,” was all he said, because he wasn’t even sure why he felt bad that Draco hadn’t told him.  It just would have been nice to know.
“Yeah. That happened. So did Hogwarts.”
“I had a boyfriend.”
When he put his glasses back on, Kavika was smiling slightly. “The holidays are coming. How do you feel about that?”
“Oh my days.”  Malfoy put a hand to his heart.  “Not tea.”
“How could Muggles hurt you?” Harry asked, staring down at Draco in bemusement.
Harry started after him as well, but what could he do? Force a Side-Along when Teddy Apparated? That would be inappropriate, unfair, and yet his feet were taking him toward the door regardless. Then he was outside, and Teddy was disappearing, Nyala with him. Though the sun had been out that day, the night was cool and sharp and dark.
“Do it,” Draco said loftily.
rude, and also a big baby.  Harry didn’t want to be a baby, and he especially didn’t want Draco thinking he was a baby.
Draco hesitated again.  “I’m saying neither of us has ever been particularly nice to each other.  While I’d like to try that at some point—now isn’t that time.”
“You really are a dunce at potions,” Malfoy said, jerking a cutting board off of a shelf, then slamming it on the table.  “The lye is a diversionary tactic to make it harder to discern the potion’s key ingredients, and the dust from the wooden eyes makes it dangerous to test, even though the lye is highly diluted.”
Malfoy’s lips parted slightly, mouth hanging open as he watched the phials reorder themselves and settle back on the racks, now in order by colour.  When the phials went still, Malfoy’s mouth snapped shut.  Snatching the bottle in Harry’s hand, he strode away.
“Yeah.” Ron gave him a rueful smile. “You defeated Voldemort. Not blood supremacy. We all have our part to do.” Looking down, Ron jabbed a finger at the tiny rectangle in Harry’s hand. “Even him.”
Draco’s lips looked really red.
Ron had said.
“But you’ll be facing down such dark terrors!  And saving the blood of innocents!  And puppies!” Mrs. Mulpepper called, as Harry finally made his way out of the door.
“We only want you to be happy,” Hermione agreed.
Aurors. You told me yourself.”
Draco arched at his own words under Harry’s hands, and Harry heard himself say, “Oh fuck.” He wanted to touch the skin underneath; he wanted him, but he wanted to get all the buttons, to get to touch it all at once, see it all at once—Draco’s chest, his beautiful body, all of that skin. Draco’s skin. Draco’s skin under his hands, Draco arching under Harry’s touch, Draco’s chest against his—
“I can,” Harry said.  “I do.”
Harry’s jaw dropped open.
Harry wished he had a coffee.
“Because it’d be immoral.”
“I’m sure Instructor Potter is just as exciting as ever,” a voice said, slicing coldly though the other questions. Malfoy was strolling out from the Pallas Arch, holding a broom tucked under his arm, hands thrust in his pockets. Harry’s heart did that hard thump he now recognized as pity. “But I know for a fact that at least—” Malfoy pretended to count—“six of you are absolutely
Harry stopped at the intersection of Diagon and Knockturn.  Malfoy wasn’t a decent person.
Apparently, Malfoy hadn’t seen him either, because Harry stood there frozen for a moment before Malfoy noticed him, both of them on their way to the bench beneath the Timothy Tree. Malfoy stopped, his mouth falling open in unguarded surprise.
Ron glanced down at Hermione.  “Harry’s been saying Malfoy’s much better for a while now,” he pointed out.  “And he’s been doing IDs for the Ministry not-for-profit all this time.  And you’re calling him Draco,” Ron went on, turning back to Harry.  “So, was it okay?”
“That was fine,” Mister Malfoy said, going to close the cabinets.  “You just need a little bit more control.”
“Thanks,” Teddy said.
“I didn’t have a particular problem. I just thought we could talk about him.”
“It is nice,” Kavika said. “It’s not always easy.”
“I don’t want to step on you,” Harry said, his voice equally soft. “I’m just . . .”
“I imagine that you do,” Harry said. “I know you did what you did out of fear. I know how young and scared you were, how you were trying to help your family, how you would have done anything for them. That doesn’t change any of the hurt—hurt
“The war?”
For a while they worked on the files, sorting them out by date, then by case.  Harry skimmed the tops of the papers, which still seemed mostly boring, but Draco read through a few of them.
So, Harry followed Mister Malfoy, who seemed to be following his stick up a set of concrete stairs attached to the estate.  They went up two storeys, then down a covered concrete hall open to the air on one side but filled with numbered doors and potted plants on the other.  They stopped at door 127.  “Probably best to stay out of sight,” Mister Malfoy said, leading Harry to stand behind the plant, then pointing his stick at him.
, where it had been reported that the Wizarding World’s most famous disowned Old Blood was “gaining an appreciation for non-mag culture.” Harry knew this for a fact, as Malfoy had asked Teddy to come with him to some non-mag concert. “It’s good for them!” Andromeda had said. Malfoy had owled her directly after the graduation in which he hadn’t participated, stated quite elegantly that he wished to apologize and longed to make amends. Andromeda had shown Harry the owl. “He was a child,” she’d said. “People change!”
“That’s not fucked up.”
The tables in the room swished away like a painting being mixed up.  A loud
“There are bunk beds.”
“Come on.” Hermione took Harry’s arm, steering him toward the door. “Ron’s punched someone.”
What would make him happy was not having to think about what made him happy. Shouldn’t you just know what would make you happy? You shouldn’t have to think about it, and anyway, Harry should have been happy here. It was better than Grimmauld Place, but then again, anything was better than that. Harry wished he could go to work.
“Well . . .” Mister Malfoy slowly looked about the kitchen.  “
After a few moments, the stretching and tugging was done, and Harry looked wonderingly down at his hands. Everything was blurry.
“I think he was a very bad man,” Harry said.
“Oh, thanks,” Malfoy said.  “That’s much better.”
Now was usually the time when Kavika returned the favour of small talk, asking Harry about his life—simple questions: how are you, how are things going, tell me about Academy. Harry used to let this go on for a while, giving minimal answers, waiting to see where she would press, but she hadn’t, not really. Instead, she had waited for him to open, allowing him to get used to her, and then when he was ready, allowing him to talk about what he had wanted to talk about. Sometimes Harry still didn’t know what he wanted to talk about, really; he just knew he always felt better once he left.
“We knew you would be sceptical,” said Parkinson, “so tonight we’ve prepared a demonstration. Rodolphus?”
.  Malfoy had ridiculed her so cruelly, but it had never occurred to Harry that Malfoy hadn’t done it because he was intrinsically a prick.  He’d done it because his parents had told him that was the way the world worked—but Harry had already known that.  Lucius and Narcissa had also told Draco that Muggleborns would ruin their whole culture, and for the first time, Harry understood why Draco had believed them.  Growing up with only Crabbe and Goyle for friends—even Parkinson—Draco must have felt like an alien, someone so completely different.
; I just . . .”  Draco flung himself back into the corner of the couch, sprawling out again.  He moved around a lot, and Harry wondered whether Draco had too much energy to sit this long on the couch.  He didn’t appear to want to leave however, for he went on to say, “I just
Malfoy’s quick, shallow breathing hitched. He closed his eyes.
“It doesn’t
, during the war, and do you know what else—?”
Malfoy put his hand on Harry’s cheek. “Have I taught you that you can have things, that you deserve them, that you deserve kindness and comfort and attention?”
sound of paper slapping on paper sounding like definitive punctuation.
Though the Academy grounds still had its anti-Apparition wards and buildings their protection wards, the wards that had concealed it from the sight and knowledge of Non-magicals had dropped. People gathered on the green, standing in the spot where the Timothy Tree had been, and ten times as many people crowded outside the Pallas Arch, waiting to enter as though to see some sort of miracle within. The sound of honking car horns and shouting people was almost deafening atop an undercurrent of sirens.
had been in both mourning and celebration.
“I don’t,” Harry said.  “I didn’t even realize that was why I was always coming to you.  Not for a long time, anyway.”
After breakfast Draco wouldn’t let Harry even clean his plate, casting a Scourgify on it and putting it away.  If the washing up was really that simple Harry didn’t understand what had taken so long earlier, but he figured it was best not to argue.  After that, Draco gave him towels and then left Harry in the bathroom, saying he’d put the new clothes in there with a spell.
Thank you to icmezzo and seraphcelene for helping me get this written. Thank you to siemejay for looking it over, giving me your truthful thoughts, encouraging me, and helping me be better always.
“0871 871 8710,” said Petunia.
“Sometimes I just feel like I need to get away,” Harry said.
Harry had been shaking her hand, but now he faltered, looking over at Draco.
“Mark was nice,” said Ron.
“That’s a very Slytherin definition of lying.”  Draco had opened the book and was doodling with his wand again.
“Are you sure about that?” said Spragg. “Are you sure about that, after centuries of Obliviate?”
He wouldn’t be alone.
“Bellatrix Lestrange, for starters.”
it,” Malfoy said.  “I’m not a
“You don’t think worries about the future could affect your sleep?”
“Fuck me.” Harry was begging now. “Fuck me, Draco, put it in. Put it in; I need it in.”
“Can I touch you now?” Harry whispered.
“What does Theodore Lupin have to say?” said Walter-someone.
Harry opened his mouth to say, but of course, that was what he had just told Yin. It was true, he realized. About the sleep remedies. Harry trusted him.
“I meant with your—whatever.  Here’s the number.  Are you ready?”
Finally it was down. “Harry,” Draco breathed. Then he reached inside, and Harry could feel the brush of Draco’s fingers—his beautiful fingers, brushing over Harry’s cock through the material of his briefs. Harry jerked a little against his hand. “Harry,” Draco said again, like a prayer. “Sweetheart.”
tell me she’s in Azkaban; don’t you
Malfoy’s eyes went softer, and Harry’s heart skipped a beat.
“You don’t feel the same.”
“That seems like a strong word,” Teddy said.
Draco was trying to sit up.
“Harry Potter.  Is he okay?”  The man reached for his back pocket, and Harry saw that Mister Malfoy tensed, but the man only brought out a piece of paper and unfolded it.  “I got this by owl, see,” the man said, “but there was nothing else on it.”
“Anyone,” said Yin. “Well, unless I know them. Then they’re dreamy.”
“There aren’t any.  Not even insects.  Nothing lives here—nothing wants to.”
“We were trying to figure out whether you were the heir of Slytherin.”
“I don’t have feelings. For him,” Harry added, when he realized how that sounded. Then he thought about having feelings, and what Kavika said about sharing them, and went on, “It would be nice to.” Then because that wasn’t clear: “Have feelings.” Then because that still wasn’t clear: “For someone.”
Mister Malfoy didn’t move, but Harry suddenly had the impression that he was getting angry.
“I remember the Ministry.” Spragg sneered. “Half under Imperius, half complicit, bending to the world of a Dark Lord.”
Malfoy just shrugged.
The brave new world.
“What, so they can get a slap on the wrist?” said Spragg. “When will you realize the institution is broken?”
“Maybe I shall,” Malfoy said breezily, coming over to Harry’s desk, placing his thigh on it to hold some of his weight, then poking the Veritascope. “So, old Povey wanted to keep me, did he? I was very attentive in his class, Potter. You should have seen me.”
They’d done a bit of shopping in Diagon Alley, Draco looking like Gilderoy Lockhart and Harry looking again like Draco, just because he could.  Draco had eased up some, only saying 'Why are you like this' three or four more times, and only saying 'Go to hell' once.  He’d dragged his feet a lot though and looked like he wished he had a pillow to throw over his face.  Harry felt like he should have known that thirteen-year-old Draco was a drama queen, but somehow, he’d missed it.  Harry didn’t suppose anybody else would go to the trouble of dressing up as a Dementor just to scare someone they liked to torment.
“And at Hogwarts,” Harry said immediately.
It was actually the best Orientation Harry had had at the Academy—even better than his own, when he was a trainee, as that had been shortly after his defeat of Voldemort and everyone except Ron had been a bit scared of him. Harry was actually thinking that, in a normal session, he would prefer to talk about Teddy, who sometimes left Rombe Pickle without telling Andromeda where he was going. Andromeda did not seem particularly concerned about these disappearances.
“That’s . . .”  Swallowing, Harry tried again.  “That’s not how I’m looking at you.”
“Thanks,” Harry said.
“Put your face on my cock,” Draco said, “and maybe I will.”
, Harry needed to say.
“Instructors Clearwater. Spragg. Savage. Povey—”
“I never said anything of the kind.” Savage.
he’d said when they broke up.
“Where do you keep it?  Is it in the warehouse?”
Harry put his hands on Draco’s hips. “Hold still.”
“I’m . . . not sure what you mean?” Harry said, when nothing more seemed forthcoming.
“Of course,” Harry said, his voice mechanic.
“Fuck,” someone said.  It was the blond man, and fire roared to life against one wall.  Harry was busy jumping out of skin, while the blond man strode about saying, “Fuck, fuck, Merlin, fuck,” pointing a stick at various places in the room.  Fire leapt up after him, burning on candles, and Harry realized the fire against the wall was in an old sturdy hearth.
Instead, Draco slapped the other side, then again, then again, until Harry was drooling all over the fake cock and arching his back to get his arse slapped, trying not to bite on the lovely dick in his mouth even though it was fake. Any prick I give you, Draco had said. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. “Fuck me,” Harry panted, finally taking the dildo out.
“Of course not,” Andromeda said.
“Do you think this anger and embarrassment had anything to do with the pain or fear it caused you?”
“He died,” Draco said, which was what Harry had been expecting to hear.
Harry’s heart twisted, and he wanted to hold him.  He’d never wanted to hold someone as often as his hands itched to touch Draco.  “I’m going to feel the same.”
“I’m ten.”
“Not bad, Malfoy,” Ron said, then immediately turned, petrifying three NDEs one straight after another—two duelling Robards, another duelling a different Auror. Then he was leaping out of the trunk to join the remaining fray.
31 years
“I guess not.”  The unhappy look on Draco’s face tugged at his soft cheeks, making his eyes so big, his pink mouth a little bud.
“Oh, fuck,” Malfoy whispered, but Harry was already forgetting.
“Getting personal, are we, Potter?” Malfoy quipped.
“I was!”
Malfoy stared down at Ron’s hand like it was some kind of sudden snake in the grass, then up at Ron, then, inexplicably, at Harry. Then he was swooping in, grabbing Ron’s hand with gusto, pumping it several times energetically. “Three years means one hundred and fifty percent of the Auror you are, Weasley.”
“But it’s not
“How wonderful for you.”
“Take care of your family.”  Squeezing again, Harry let her go.
“Well, that’s silly.  Accio them.”
“Well, Harry.”  Draco glanced down at him.  “I’m trying to ID the potion that fell on you—that’s the best way to devise a cure, in most instances.  Reverse engineering.  But—Lumos.”  A light shone at the end of Draco’s wand.  They’d reached a landing with several doors, and Draco chose the one to the right.  “I’m having trouble with the ID.  It’s got to be quite complex, to de-age both your body and mind so thoroughly, and it’s looking as though it’s not temporary.  It would really help if I could talk to the brewer—but of course, that’s impossible.”
Putting his head back on his pillow, Harry closed his eyes.  The pyjamas Draco had transfigured for Harry were much nicer, different than the white and blue striped ones he’d had before.  These were green and silver, and felt a little slippery, like silk.  They were the most comfortable things Harry had ever worn.  “Draco,” Harry said, putting his head over the side again.
“Leverage for what?”
“Smell?”
“Do I get to sleep on top?” Harry said, pretty excited about the prospect of bunk beds.
Self-sufficient meant you could do everything for yourself.  Harry had always thought being self-sufficient sounded great, but Draco hexing Dudley sounded pretty great as well, and Harry couldn’t tell which he preferred.  Maybe it was best to be self-sufficient and also have a protector like Draco, who would help if you needed it.  Harry looked up at Draco again, the gold light playing on his face.  Harry wanted to sit closer to him, but he was already as close as possible.  If he leaned some, though, more of Harry could be touching him.  Thinking Draco might not notice, Harry tried it.
“Ah.”  Draco’s hand stopped.
Harry looked speechlessly down at the broom, so surprised that for a moment, he just stood there. Malfoy had disappeared from Harry’s mind as soon as the press conference started—Malfoy, who had come to distract the reporters. Instead, Malfoy had left the broom.
“Like what?”  The man looked angry, but the way he was talking wasn’t.  “Harry—what’s wrong?  I thought you’d be so . . .”  His voice faltered.  “Impressed.”
“One more thing,” Harry said. “Can you take my place?”
“What?” said the girl with the shaved head. The pub was too loud; she hadn’t heard.
Draco picked up the book again.  “We could read together, if you like,” he suggested, holding it out.
“Oh,” Draco said breathlessly. “You like that. What about this?” His hand went lower to tug on Harry’s bollocks—rather sharply.
“There will possibly be—” Draco hesitated—"a great many.”
“This isn’t a game,” Shacklebolt said, not even bothering to look at him, and Malfoy shut his mouth. “Instructor Potter. I assume you would prefer to personally oversee Mister Malfoy’s wellbeing and safety during this mission?”
“Obviously, it was enough,” Penelope said. “It nearly killed you. Several times. Plus, it killed half our friends; it took so much away from us—”
At last, Malfoy stopped casting, sweat beaded at his brow. “Timothy,” said Malfoy
don’t know,” Draco said, bringing his nose down.  “Only Mum says they have, and you shouldn’t put them on things, or wear them, like Mum says I can’t wear pink anymore, because Muggles have—well.”  Draco sniffed.  “You’ll never catch
Ignoring this, the Aurors swept into the courtroom.
Draco cleaned Harry’s plate with a tap of his wand, then charmed a large slice of the tart onto it.  Then he cast a spell on it that Harry didn’t know and added a scoop of cream.  When Harry tried it, the tart was warm, the cream was cold, and if he hadn’t decided it before, he would have decided then and there that magic was really wonderful, and so was Draco.
24 years
“Er.” Looking around the room for inspiration, Harry remembered Kavika’s window with its tree, her tapestries, her side table with coffee. Nothing was in this office other than chrome, black paint, and white leather. When Harry started thinking longingly of Kavika’s Magibricks, he realized he was again rubbing the back of his hand. “I’m not sure,” Harry said finally. “We’re fine. I like him.”
Christ.  Harry had always told Draco he was a genius at potions, and he’d meant it, but he’d never realized Draco was this good.  Draco could have written papers.  He
“Potions consultant!  What’s that?”
“He hasn’t got
It reminded Harry of something terrible he didn’t like to think of, so he didn’t think of it.
“No,” Harry shouted. “I wanted to be with you.”
” Harry put out his hand, and Ron dropped the rectangle into it. “I shrank it. I thought you might not have read it.”
“Because I want to remember,” Malfoy said. “Who I am now. Who I’ve become.”
“I never understood why you live here,” Harry said, the algae massaging his feet now.
Harry began to get that empty feeling, as though at last having hit capacity on what he was able to feel once more.
Harry turned to look at him uncomprehendingly, and Malfoy’s expression broke all over into softness. “Come,” he said lowly, taking Harry by the arm, so gently, leading him to Harry’s desk, his chair. “Sit,” Malfoy told him, so Harry sat.
“Dudley never much cared for me.”
Then the world was swirling as Harry struggled.
Harry poked him in the side. “That’s not an Auror.”
“I’m sure you had your reasons.”
After the Leaky, Harry and Draco walked back to Tailored Tinctures, where Harry took off their disguises.  The next year should be coming soon.  “Do I change these clothes?” Draco said, plucking at his trousers.
When Harry reached out, Draco scrambled away.  “Don’t touch me,” he said raggedly.
