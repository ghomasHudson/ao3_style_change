“I couldn’t help him. Harry started levitating and screaming. His magic threw me against the wall, and all of the beds and wardrobes smashed. Luckily, Neville st-stupefied him and, well, he told me to bring him to you.” Ron and Hermione’s eyes widened at the use of Harry’s first name, and then again at each word as Malfoy recounted the past ten minutes. “And, well, you heard the rest.” Malfoy grimaced as he remembered what had just happened.
“You were with him??” Ron said, confused. “And why is he wearing one of Harry’s sweaters from Mum?!”
“Malfoy! Get away from Harry!” A voice suddenly said. Draco’s face flushed. He turned around to see a very angry Ron and a slightly less angry but extremely concerned Hermione, both with their wands pointing directly at him. As soon as they saw the boys’ tear-stained faces, they lowered their wands.
“Wild magic, I know.” Neville finished. “Thank Merlin the other three weren’t here. More people means more chance of serious injury.” Neville gulped and looked into the distance. Draco knew this look. It happened whenever they thought about the war. Draco himself had experienced it often.
All nine of the 8th years laughed and smiled, and Harry all of them knew that everything was only going to get better from then on.
In case the mention of angst turns you off the story, (I know I feel this way sometimes), I want to note that the current relationships the characters have are healthy and everything turns out okay in the end. :)
“Harry, you should have told us.” Hermione whispered. “That is child abuse Harry. And animal abuse, too. They could have been put in prison.”
Draco nodded. “Do you know where they are? Hermione and Ron, I mean.” Draco said as he dug beneath the broken bed frame to pull out Harry’s old plaid pajama bottoms and jumpers for the both of them. The castle felt much colder when Draco wasn’t snuggled up against Harry.
“No...no...don’t hurt her...it is not funny!!! STOP!!!! STOP!!!!” Harry was thrashing around in his bed, sobbing and screaming violently. He was having a nightmare. Draco was used to this, but they were not usually this intense. He held his boyfriend’s head to his chest, running his thin fingers through the dark and unruly hair. Harry’s eyes opened. His face was red and his eyes puffy. Tears streamed down his cheeks. Draco hated seeing him like this, it reminded him of all of the trauma from the war they had been through. All of the pain caused by the Death Eaters. All of the pain Draco and his family had caused him.  The blond thought, trying to push away the negative thoughts so he could pay attention to the withering boy beside him.
Swifty, Draco pulled Harry’s cloak over him and his love and disappeared as he opened the door and ran down the hall. The façade he had been attempting to hold up with Neville disappeared and Draco felt his eyes fill with water once more. Harry was now holding onto Draco, burying his crumpled face in his boyfriend’s neck.
“Yes, My Lord.” Lucius bowed once more and then moved back into line at the hand gesture from the Dark Lord. Voldemort continued on then, calling forth this Death Eater and that one, giving them orders. When they were finally dismissed, Lucius really did take a sigh of relief. As he turned to talk to Severus, he found the stoic man was already halfway to the door. In an almost undignified manner, Lucius rushed to him and grabbed his upper arm. “Severus wait!” he whispered harshly.
Blaise sighed. “You might as well. I’ll have to ask Harry if it’s okay to tell you and you’ll want to be sitting down if he says it’s okay. Besides, we have a medi-witch on hand here should you need it. Come on through, and I’ll go talk to Harry about it.” Blaise stepped back and waited for his mother. “Just… sit down and I’ll be right back.” He sighed as he ran a hand through his hair. “Harry?” he called through the door. “Harry I need to talk to you, it’s important. Listen, I know what’s going on is weird, and it hurts, but this is very important. My mother’s downstairs demanding to know what’s going on. She knows something’s not right, and she wants to know what it is now. Please, Harry, either give me permission to tell her or you need to come down and tell her that it’s none of her business. She my mum, I can’t do that.”
“Of course Headmaster. Would anything less be tolerated?” They both snickered at their private joke.
McGonagall had gone to Madam Malkins Robes for All Occasions and had the wedding robes commissioned. Since they weren’t actual wedding robes, she didn’t raise too much suspicion in her dealings. Draco looked them over when she returned and praised her for her success in obtaining exactly what he wanted. Tradition stated that the bride would wear her hair down a loose on her wedding day. Well, neither Harry nor Draco were female, but they did have long hair. They had been in the Forbidden Forest for five months without a haircut. Since then, it had been trimmed but not cut. Draco thought they would wear their hair loosely pulled back for the ceremony, and had hair clips commissioned to match their robes. McGonagall got those as well, and they were perfect.
“What happened? When did they get here? Are they alright? What’s the diagnosis? Can you heal them? Is there any permanent damage? What is he doing?” Dumbledore asked in rapid procession.
“Yes Harry, if you wanted to. We have multiple properties, but this one was the farthest one away from England and away from all the press that seems to be your shadow. I thought you might enjoy the reprieve.”
, Draco couldn’t hardly stand anymore and sitting for long periods left him aching everywhere. He was essentially on bedrest until he gave birth. The first articles had gone over smashingly. Everyone was sending owl after owl with congratulations, gifts, and apologies for the harm done to Harry’s sight and hearing.
When dinner approached, Draco sat down in his room, alone for the first time that day, and began to write his vows. He didn’t know what he wanted to say, but he knew he had to say something. It wasn’t common for a couple to use their own vows with the ceremonial blessing they were using, but Draco wanted it. So he got it. He first made a list of all the things he wanted to say to Harry, then how to say them. Finally, he filled in the blanks so the whole thing would flow nicely. At last, he looked down at his vows.
“I just wanted to let you know that your daddy loves you. Not Blaise, because Blaise isn’t your real daddy. Draco, you remember me telling you about him? Well, he’s the man with the blonde hair and beautiful steel gray eyes. He’s your real daddy. Blaise will love you too, don’t get me wrong. It’s just that Draco would have loved you so much more because he helped to make you. And I don’t want you to ever think that it was your fault that he left. It was nobody’s fault except his own. Draco just threw a hissy fit when he saw something and misinterpreted it.” Harry sighed.
“Not necessarily,” Draco answered with a dreamy smile on his lips. “I was born with black hair and dark eyes too. Now look at me.”
After taking a sip, Draco smiled to Harry and continued. At the start of our seventh year, this past year, nothing was any different than it had been. On September 4th, we went to Care of Magical Creatures out on the grounds. Hagrid had procured several hippogriffs for the class. It wasn’t the first time he’d done so; we knew the rules for the beasts. But Harry and I had gotten into a fight and carried it over into class. We insulted one of the hippogriffs-”
“Then I’ll just have to wear Draco’s for now, won’t I?” He reached into the box, pulled out both rings, and slid them onto Harry’s and his left ring fingers respectively, watching as they magically changed sizes to fit the wearer. “Come, I think an audience awaits. Try to be calm through the questioning and be as vague as possible when forced to answer. If it gets too bad for you, seek shelter in the Slytherin dorms. You still have the password right?”
Draco slumped against his lover, neither caring about the wet mess between them. Just as they were to slip into a deserved nap, there was pounding against their door. Draco immediately felt Harry tense beneath him. He yawned and clutched Harry closer. “Just let them in,” he said sleepily. “They’ll see that we’re fine, freak out a bit, and go away. It will be better than putting up with that pounding all day.”
“Or,” Ron said, looking around to see if anyone had noticed Hermione, “they’ve stopped looking. They said they would tell us if they found any new information. They haven’t said anything to us at all in the past month. What if they have stopped looking, ‘Mione? It’s been three months. No one could survive in there for three months. I remember when Harry and I went to follow the spiders. We almost died then. If Dad’s car hadn’t of found us… I don’t even want to think about it.”
“Oh, Draco. Of course I will! I was just upset that no one has mentioned anything all day. I know it makes me sound full of myself, but I was sure someone would say something. Everyone knows my birthday, and lots of people have said things before. But today... It just seemed weird. Even Ron didn't say anything!”
“This is exactly why we didn’t tell you anything,” Moody growled. “We can’t draw any unwanted attention. It was my decision to tell everyone about the training and the attack. They’re logical excuses. You two are the only ones we had to worry about asking questions, but you didn’t. Not until now.”
Harry was gesturing wildly, his eyes wide as he tried to give his two cents on the matter at hand. Draco tried to translate, but many of the gestures didn’t make sense to him in the order they were given and Harry was moving too fast to keep up with. He tried to slow him down, but Harry was too agitated. Not mad, just wanted to get his point across and couldn’t since he couldn’t speak.
The professor left, leaving Madam Pomfrey to debate on whether or not she wanted to fight Harry on the sleeping matter. When he turned hardened eyes on her, she sighed and held up her hands in defeat. “I concede. For now,” she amended. “It will come time for you and Draco to sleep at the same time, you know. It can’t always be like this. But for now, I will allow this. Goodnight Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter.”
“I’m perfectly fine, Blaise. Theresa says I can move about as long as it’s not too fast or sudden or anything. You’re not my medi-witch. And I
There was plenty more gesturing from Harry and lots of yelling and talking from Draco. After several minutes of this, Hermione leaned over and started explaining Muggle sign language to Ron: how it worked and why it was formed. While she was telling the story of a young girl named Helen Keller, Draco interrupted her.
“Five months?” Ron interrupted. “Five? It’s been just over six. You’ve been stuck in the Forbidden Forest for six months.”
That was another thing they’d talked about – the excuse used for why Harry was away. If he were away for training, then he needed to get some kind of training. Voldemort was still a real threat, and now Snape wasn’t able to spy. Even the Malfoys were stuck at Hogwarts for their protection. It would be best for all of it to come out to the public. It would protect the former Death Eaters in the longrun, would bring all the information to light, and would show that Harry wasn’t trying to hide anything.
pleased with the Malfoy men escaping his grasp. And while Narcissa had never been marked, she was as good as considering her husband had been the Dark Lord’s left-hand man and ‘lover’. She’d been thinking over the position she’d found herself in ever since her husband had defected. She’d never been a diehard believer of the Death Eaters and Voldemort, but she didn’t side with the Light either. She had been hoping to remain neutral. But that was not to be. She’d answered a missive from her sister, Bellatrix, and found herself at the end of Rabastian’s and Rodolphus’ wands.
Just as he went to turn away, a faint clicking sound was heard. Wand immediately in hand, Snape turned back to the door to see the knob twisting and the door opening so very slowly. He peeked in to see what was going on, only to find the two boys in bed, Harry curled around Draco. Then Harry’s eyes opened and looked directly at him. The message was clear, and the arms tightening around the sleeping blonde only cemented it.
“Of course!” Mrs. Zabini gushed. “Of course of course, you two just relax and enjoy yourselves. Do owl before you come back so we can have the place looking nice and be home. You know how hectic things tend to get when you least expect them to.” Harry’s face fell.
That calmed anyone who seemed worried, and the questions continued. The party started to wind down and people started to leave in twos and threes. When it was just the Weasleys, Hermione, Neville, Luna, Dumbledore, Snape, Narcissa, Lucius, and Remus left, Draco cleared his throat to get everyone’s attention.
“Good afternoon Blaise. Please, please come in.” She held the door open and Blaise entered, still dragging a stunned Harry Potter behind him.
“You think I’m a bad parent?!” Draco screeched one time, as he was instructing Missy to rearrange the furniture and to recolor it cream. “You think I don’t know what my baby needs?! What, do you think I’ll hurt It? You probably think I’m completely inept too, huh? That I don’t know how to change a nappy or make a bottle. Well guess what, Mr. Savior of the Wizarding World, I
“Severus!” Draco cried, sitting up suddenly. “How long have you been there? Harry, how long has he been there?”
“Of course,” Theresa answered, saying the first thing in quite some time. Well, she was one of the four to yell ‘what’ when Harry answered ‘yes’ to sleeping with Blaise. “I was hired by Blaise Zabini to take care of his then-pregnant husband, Harry. Harry shared with me the real story, that the baby was Draco Malfoy’s and that he, Harry, was only friends with Blaise. That wasn’t the reason I was there, and didn’t care. I was there to take care of a pregnant wizard, and soon deliver a baby from said pregnant wizard. I was awoken around 3 am on December 22 of last year when Blaise and Harry claimed Harry was going into labour and having contractions.
“By the power vested in me by Merlin, I now pronounce you husband and husband. May your love so endure that its flame remains a guiding light unto you.”
“Blaise?” he called quietly as he knocked on the door. “Blaise are you in there?” There was a bit of mumbling so Harry opened the door and walked in. After closing the door, he made his way to Blaise’s bed and stood beside it. “Blaise can you hear me? Are you awake? I don’t mean to wake you so late, but can I stay here with you for a bit? Please?”
Severus snorted. “More like Granger’s too smart for her own good and pointed all of this out to Weasley.”
“The wards stayed up, and the food kept coming. And Harry stayed on the ground. On the third morning, I woke up being floated back to the ground. As soon as I was down and fully awake, I started yelling at him for any- and everything I could think of. I must have ranted for ten, twenty minutes before-” Harry was gesturing wildly. “It was not a full hour and you know it! I finally realized he wasn’t saying anything back. We were friendly by now.” Harry gestured some more. “I am not saying that.”
“Yes, yes, yes!” Draco chanted. He had leaned forward so he was raised up on his knees, his hands holding the headboard in a tight grip, his head hanging between his elbows. “Come on, baby, do it. Fill me up.”
“Yes, Father. Harry and I are wed. We combined our names: Potter-Malfoy. It wasn’t that long ago. We have also made plans to have a more ceremonial renewing of vows at a later date. Surely you can understand why the secrecy was needed? We could not allow anyone to know, especially the Dark Lord. We were not sure as to what your allegiances were, truly, at the time. Even now, we do not want to let anyone know of Harry’s true powers. He is so powerful, Father.”
peaked Voldemort’s interest, and he found the Gryffindor was involved with one of his most loyal servants’ child. He called Lucius forward and let the blonde Death Eater torture the boy.
Of course all the professors showed up – Dumbledore, Snape, Hagrid, Grubby-Plank, Sinistra, McGonagall, Flitwick, Hooch, Sprout, and Madam Pomfrey. Even Binns and Trewlawny came! Firenze sent his regards. Remus, Narcissa, and Lucius also attended.
“Christmas sixth year? Yeah, last Christmas for Creevy. And yours was... Graduation? Really? You thought it would take that long? Of course, I thought they had it at the Tri-Wizard Tournament in fourth year. Weasley couldn’t keep his eyes off Granger throughout the whole fiasco. You two really didn’t start dating until Christmas last?”
“Has it really been three months?” Hermione asked in a small voice. She seemed shell-shocked, as if such a thing were unthinkable. “They can’t give up on him. It’s Harry! We need him! What will they tell everyone? It’s not something you can just come out and say! What are they going to do? What are
Using his left hand, Harry lubed up his own cock to ready himself. Draco was now taking three fingers and was nearly ready. If it were up to Draco, Harry would have skipped the fingers entirely. But there was no way that was going to happen. If it were up to Harry, they’d not be having sex; he feared harming the child. But Draco showed him book after book that said it was okay, good even, to be having sex. So long as it wasn’t rough or kinky. So Harry made slow, careful love to his husband any time Draco asked. Never once did the brunette say no, no matter how tired or sore he might be.
“We’d like to start at the beginning of our story and get through the whole thing today, leaving the details for another interview. As Luna can surely attest, Harry and I were not friends during our years at Hogwarts. Our first and second meetings pre-Hogwarts were actually quite tense and ended with Harry rejecting my offer of friendship. Up until the beginning of our seventh year, this past year, we were enemies. We both played Seeker on our House teams – Harry a Gryffindor, myself a Slytherin. Even our families were on opposite sides with my parents being Dark Lord sympathizers and Harry’s being members of the Order of the Phoenix.”
“Good afternoon, Mr. Potter. Mr. Malf- Oh my!” he gasped as he finally looked up and saw Draco’s belly. “Please, forgive me.” His slight Russian accent had gotten deeper with his exclamation, but was receding once more. “I was not prepared for such an event. Again, my apologies.”
“No, Harry. I have to do this my way.” He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, his Malfoy mask falling into place. “What is going on, Father?”
“Think about it, Harry. Is this the ‘power the Dark Lord knows not’? And even if it’s not, you’re still damned powerful enough now to really give him what for. The next time you meet, you’ll wallop him good for sure!”
Severus stopped and turned toward him, wanting to get back to Hogwarts. This information was crucial. “What is it Lucius? I have places to be. Some of us have to juggle two lives very carefully lest we be caught.”
“Just so,” Draco agreed. They’d all agreed to keep Harry’s magical abilities to themselves, not needing Voldemort to know how powerful Harry was without a wand. “He can’t see very well, but his magic gives him plenty of information. For instance, he has no idea your briefcase is brown, Mr. Volkanov, but he could pick it up and carry it away with perfect accuracy – no groping about. He knows where Severus is standing behind him without looking. He knows where the spiders in this room are. He can navigate back to the Great Hall with no assistance from this room.”
“Do you… Do you always let your husband talk to you in such a manner, Mr. Zabini?” Dr. Mitchsens asked.
But the whole week looked normal. There were two appointments for the whole week. One was on Tuesday; that was the one for Harry. He had needed to have an evaluation with the head Auror to go over how he was doing and if there was anything he wanted to discuss. The other was on Wednesday; that was the one for Draco. He had gone out with some friends to have a few drinks or whatever.
“A slow labor. Poor ducky. At least his mum is here with him. And I’m here for you, love. We’ll get through this just fine. I remember when your mum went into labor, you know.” Harry turned surprised eyes on the Weasley matriarch. “Oh yes, indeed. She was much like Draco, driving James absolutely nuts with her worrying and nesting and griping. But her labor was hard and fast. When you decided you were ready, you wanted out immediately. There was no time for numbing spells or even a proper mediwizard. You popped out right there in St. Mungo’s waiting foyer, you did. Nurses assisted your mother. Your father fainted on the floor, barely caught by Sirius. All of this was told to me later; I wasn’t at the hospital myself. It was such a story to hear!”
“Regardless of the name given, it will be Harry’s child. If you secret it away and the news is leaked – before or after the birth – how do you think the public will take it? Surely you don’t
“It’s not that they don’t already know,” Draco explained. “It’s that I don’t want our wedding photos to have me as big as a Quidditch Pitch! I mean, I’m already getting there as it is. It’s not hard to see that I’m two-and-a-half months along. Another few weeks, and I’m going to stop wearing my pants because they won’t fit anymore!”
“Do you really mean it Blaise?” Harry asked. “You really want to stay here? This is where we’d live?”
Harry tried to rim his husband and smile at the same time, but it was difficult. So he focused on pleasing Draco instead. It made him giggle that Draco had not only become more amorous in the later stages of pregnancy, but had also developed a penchant for talking dirty. It wasn’t the norm for them, but Harry wasn’t saying ‘no’. Hearing his sexual prowess hurled back at him was another turn on of his. If he could reciprocate, he’d at least try. Instead, he put his all into his actions.
“Oh, we have a pretty good idea when that event took place.” Harry and Draco smiled at each other, Harry giving Draco a warm hug for added comfort. “Anyways. I’m sorry about the emotional bit. I know it comes with the territory of being preggers, I just didn’t expect it to be so… so… fluid. I just went from happy to bawling sad in no time at all!”
“Oh yes, yes he did. I think it’s a lovely name, and I would love for his middle name to be of his father’s. You do talk to the baby, don’t you Harry? Ah, well you must start right away. Talk to McKay as if you were already holding him and coddling him. Babies can hear, even in the womb my dear. I began talking to Blaise as soon as I found out I was pregnant. And have Blaise talk to him too. I know he’s not the biological father, but it will help the baby recognize familiar voices. Blaise will be around while he grows up.”
“McKay, I know you’re eating and probably don’t understand a word I’m saying, but I’m your daddy. I’m Harry, and this big guy next to me is your other daddy. I told you about him. Remember Blaise? But he’s not your real daddy. I told you that before. Draco’s your real daddy. Blaise is just here to fill in for him since he’s being an idiot. But don’t worry one bit, we love you still the same,” Harry said softly as McKay sucked on the bottle. “He’s so little.”
. He has changed his ways, never wanted anything like this to happen. Smart? Brain? Knowledge? Yes, knowledge? Okay, knowledge. You? You knowledge? Do you know him? Yes, you know this Death Eater.” A significant look at Draco, then back at Snape. “Yes to that as well, Mr. Potter-Malfoy, yes to that as well. Now I really must be going.”
, Harry reminded him via more writing. Their personal language didn’t have many of the words Harry needed during these conversations.
“Of course I do. I just spent the last three weeks gathering all this stuff and recording and spelling it for you. I’ll likely not forget it for months!”
Harry placed a hand on the top of his stomach. “I’ll begin doing that immediately. Is there anything else I should know about my first pregnancy?”
And he did. He started with the detention-giving class, giving his view on things as they were and as they were just then with hind-sight. He left little out, perhaps only glossing over some events; others he went into great detail. He did not stop once they returned to Hogwarts. He continued on to describe their wedding and why he chose what he did. With a tear in his eye, he recited their vows for his father, explaining the meaning behind Harry’s simple gesture.
“I am Blaise Zabini. I am under Veratiserum. I am the current husband, but wish to part with my husband in favour of bettering his life, his future husband’s life, and their child’s life. The child is not mine. I do not work either, currently, but was actually looking into a job just near where we were living in France. That’s not important, is it Dr. Morris?”
“I love you too, Harry. And you have nothing to be sorry about. Madam Pomfrey gave me many pamphlets and books on what symptoms to expect during each month of pregnancy. I must admit, I am not going to enjoy the last two months. She suggested you read over all of these as well so you know what to expect. I believe everyone will want to fuss over you first. And, depending on the time, I believe Granger and Weasley should be arriving any–”
After that, two buffet tables filled with food to munch on appeared – sandwiches, vegetable platters, fruit platters, dips, chips, cake bites, candy, and more birthday cake slices. Harry floated a plate of fruit and dip over to himself and Draco, feeding Draco bits of the sweet treat. Several people cooed in affection at the sight. Harry, himself, snagged another piece of birthday cake, confetti vanilla this time complete with sprinkles.
“It’s a good thing you had me take McKay,” Theresa said with a smile. “I don’t think Harry even realizes there’re other people on this planet besides him and Draco right now.” She smiled as McKay looked up at here and giggled. “And what are smiling about? Your daddy’s making a scene with Draco.” McKay giggled again. “What? Draco?” McKay giggled. “You like the name of your real daddy? Draco. Draco Draco Draco.” McKay would have fallen over he was laughing so hard if Theresa weren’t laughing so hard.
“Your eyes were blue too, Harry,” Molly piped in. “Almost all babies are born with blue eyes. They’ll change in a week or two weeks’ time. And my twins were born with dark hair. Arthur fainted right on the floor at the sight of that! One week later, it all fell out and the red hair came sprouting right in.”
Draco looked a little confused. “It’s nothing, really. I mean, I take great pride in my hair, but it grows fast. And in case you haven’t noticed I keep it relatively short which means I must cut it in some way. It would grow back. It’s really not
He touched his finger to the mark on her forearm, unheeding of her murmur of pain at the action, and called for the rest of his followers. In as little as ten seconds, the first ones began to appear. As they winked into the small room, they bowed at the waist and then crawled forward to kiss the hem of his robes. He allotted five minutes for all of his followers to appear. Anyone after that was punished. If no one was late, then he only punished those who cut it too close to that five minute mark.
Harry nodded his head as Blaise led him over to sit on a bar stool with him and Theresa. “Blaise had mentioned wanting to stay here, permanently. I asked if he had said anything to you about this, since it would be a major decision in both your lives. I know you’d said before that you would like to stay here for good, but sometimes you change your thoughts. I suggested he ask you again before he floo-called his parents,” Theresa explained.
Fresh tears sprang into Harry’s eyes as he threw his arms around Blaise’s shoulders. “Of course, Blaise,” he said. “Of course I will.”
The pile of gifts grew and grew until Harry blushed even just looking at the table. Everyone now knew he was mute thanks to
Throughout the night, Harry helped Draco with massages and shuffling walks when needed. Narcissa fed him ice chips. Molly kept out of the way by knitting on the couch. She’d talk to Harry about all sorts of nonsense when Draco was having a moment with his mother. Without him knowing, Narcissa snuck a picture of him and Molly on the couch.
“And that goes for you too, Severus.” They waited in silence for a moment before said man walking into the room with a scowl on his face. “Harry’s hearing, smell, taste, and magic are beyond advanced. He knew you were here before you even walked into the Infirmary. I didn’t expect you to linger at the door and listen in on our conversation.” He placed a hand over Harry’s as he began to gesture. “I expect both of you to get along, because I’m not leaving Harry, and I won’t stop seeing Severus. You’re both family to me now. I need you both.”
She was silent for a few moments, thinking of her response. “If it is his first pregnancy, I would talk to you about everything there is involving a male pregnancy: the first few months, the cravings, the mood swings, everything including the actual birth. There are many possibilities for things to turn south, and I would want you able to cope with them and calm your husband down until a medical professional could arrive. I, personally, have been working in this field for several years and will maintain the utmost secrecy, at your discretion of course.” She flashed a smile.
While they didn’t need jobs, he knew Harry wouldn’t be able to stay at home all the time. Frankly, neither would he. But the child changed some of those plans. His child would not be raised by nannies and house elves. It was a lonely life for a child. Perhaps there could even be one or two more children down the road for this one to have siblings. But that was something to consider in another few years, not now.
Ron silently sighed and let the tantrum run its course. He went through this maybe twice a week. It’s not that he didn’t feel the same way, he just didn’t know what to do. Hermione was the brains, she thought things through so as not to make a mistake. Harry was the point man, he got the job done. Ron was the strategy, he did the in between things. Hermione thought it out, Ron started the action, Harry finished it. Well, Hermione wasn’t thinking and Harry wasn’t there to finish it. It was suddenly up to him to be all three parts of their triad. It was a mighty big pair of shoes to fill for someone with small feet.
Dr. Morris pointed to Draco. “My name is Draco Malfoy. I don’t work. I am the father of the child, and am partaking in this only to get my husband and child back. I think this is stupid, for the record.”
Harry was fine, Draco was fine, it was the day after Christmas, and Voldemort was gone. What else was needed? A good shag from his boyfriend was all Harry wanted. And he got one. The holidays ended and school began once more in January. Everyone was so excited that Voldemort was finally gone. Parties were held nearly every weekend in the dorms, the Room of Requirement, the Great Hall. Eventually, their sixth year ended. Harry was worried Dumbledore would make him go back to the Dursleys’, but his fears were in vain. He ended up, weirdly enough, spending the summer at Hogwarts in Snape’s rooms.
But no one was coming. No one was there. He had no choice but to let go of Harry or risk falling himself.
Somehow, Harry had convinced Draco to accept a more muggle style of living. In exchange for not having a house elf, Harry had volunteered to do most of the cleaning and all of the cooking. He didn't mind; he liked to cook. It was calming for him. He was also able to get things like a more muggle kitchen, the telly and all the extras, a radio system, and other little muggle things in the house. Draco insisted on a two story (with basement and attic) house with six bedrooms, four and half bathrooms, two kitchens (one formal and one informal and more muggle), etc. etc. etc.
“You’ve got that right,” Dr. Morris said. “Let the record show that Blaise and Harry have never had sexual relations with each other. If asked if they have slept together, however, the answer will be yes as they have shared a bed before. Moving on. Harry, what is McKay’s full name?”
Harry finally came to his senses and jumped out of bed. He grabbed the nearest set of clothes, not even carrying that his shirt was probably inside out. He tied his tie by memory, not bothering to look into the mirror as he did it. Harry grabbed his bag from beside his red canopy bed. Somehow, by the time Harry was done Draco was already hurrying out the door. “Bye love!” Harry shouted after him.
“Don’t touch me.” Harry said weakly, looking at his knees. He was no longer angry, just sad and scared.
He was fairly certain that all of the Gryffindor boys were already seated in the Great Hall at the moment, but he wanted to be sure. One of the benefits of being gay was that the castle had no problem with Harry smuggling another boy into the dorms, even if the other boy was a particular tall, blond Slytherin. That meant that they slept together in Harry’s bed nearly every night. The other Slytherins had nearly no respect for privacy, especially now that it wasn’t rare for Draco to thrash and cry in his sleep from memories of the war. They all were worried about him, though they would never openly admit it. They knew Draco was sneaking off somewhere, but he seemed happier and didn’t want to ruin whatever was helping him.
“I c-can explain! Me and P-potter are not-” Draco stuttered, trying to find a reasonable explanation for why he was wearing a red and gold tie, and Harry was wearing a green and silver one.
Draco pushed himself out of Harry’s arms and looked down at him. “Darling, we can’t be late. They’ll know that something is up. Pansy and Granger are already on to us, they ganged up on me when I was in the library last week. If it wasn’t for your stupid invisibility Cloak, they would have seen us together!”
“Malfoy, Harry. What is happening? What is wrong?!” Hermione said as her own eyes filled with tears. Ron’s brow was creased with worry.
Draco looked at Harry and tried to be angry, failing miserably. The most he could do is a light “annoyed”.
Draco realized that this must have been what Harry was remembering when he had his nightmare. All of this time, and he had never known a thing. All Harry had told him is that he used to go stay with his muggle relatives each summer, and they were a bunch of gits. He never knew just how horrible they were. “Git” didn’t even begin to describe the people Harry had just recalled. Draco looked at Ron and Hermione and he could tell that neither of them had heard anything even close to the raw truth of what had happened to Harry every summer, and all year before that.
“STUPEFY!” A wire of red light emerged from behind one of the other Gryffindor’s beds and hit Harry in the back. The boy went rigid, then fell onto the pile of red canopy, splintered oak and mattress. Draco’s wand was somewhere in that mess, along with Harry’s glasses.
“I really have the best friends ever. And the best boyfriend ever, too.” Harry said. His two closest friends and Draco all smiled widely when they noted that Harry sounded okay, if not happy. Genuinely happy. They all gave each other a group hug, not caring that they could hear the door to the common room open as Dean, Thomas and Neville strolled in, flanked by Pansy and Blaise.
A lanky boy emerged from the light’s source. He looked positively terrified. He looked at Draco, confusion streaking across his face for a moment, then it was shaken off.
“No,” Hermione said, surprising the other three. “Harry, me and Ron-and I am assuming Malf-Draco too, love you. You can’t push us away like this.” Hermione and Ron embraced their best friend, and Draco did the same. They stayed this way for a few minutes and Draco was surprised that Ron let him borderline hug him. Ron was, too.
“What is wrong with my tie?” Harry cautiously looked down at his tie. There was most certainly something wrong with his tie, in particular the color of it. Harry flushed. Around his neck was a silk green and silver tie, identical to the one that belonged to Slytherin boys. “Oh shit,” He said quietly. He looked up at his friends, all gawking widely. He tried to smile and play it cool, but it came out as a sort of grimace. “Oops.”
“Harry…” Draco gasped. His charcoal eyes were filled with fear. He pressed his lean body against the cold wall.
“Dr-draco, I lost control. I could have hurt you. I could have killed you!” Harry said, his words barely audible as he sobbed in fear of himself. “Get away from me! I can’t be near you, or them. I am dangerous, I don’t deserve to be here.” Harry knocked Draco down onto the floor and stood above the armchair.. Draco could see a faint purple light pulsing under Harry’s skin. Draco stayed still. As much as the wild magic scared him, he could not leave Harry in the state he was in. Draco refused to think about what Harry would do to himself if he left him alone.
Harry pulled down his shirt and turned back around. He looked at his hands, unable to make eye contact with his friends and lover. He continued. “The punishments always involved no dinner though. Until Hagrid came and picked me up, I had been living off half a grapefruit and whatever I could nick from the lunch counter and cornershop during school every day.” Harry grimaced at the memory and his stomach growled. No matter how much he could eat, he could never make up for the lost meals. He was always hungry. “It didn’t get much better when I came back from Hogwarts, either. The best thing that happened was that I moved out of the cupboard, and got my cousin's second bedroom. But, this time I had Hedwig.” Harry realized that Draco probably didn’t know who she was. “She was my owl.” Harry added. Draco suddenly remembered a white snowy owl flying into the Great Hall during third year. He felt a little better knowing that he could understand who Harry was talking about.
Ron was the first to say something. “So...are you and Malfoy, Draco, a thing or…” He looked very uncomfortable.
“He killed her right there in front of me! I couldn’t use my magic, the ministry was already after me at this point and I was not seventeen yet. I threw a lamp at Dudley’s head and they locked me in my room. I would have done more, but I hadn’t eaten or slept in eight days. By the time I was allowed to go out again, Uncle Vernon had thrown her in the dumpster. The DUMPSTER!!!!” Harry was full on screaming at this point.
“They hurt her, too. They locked her in her cage all summer, nearly every year. They starved her, too. And I couldn’t do anything about it. I had to sit there and watch as they hurt her. I could see the pain in her eyes. It got really bad between sixth and what would have normally been seventh year. My cousin Dursley strangled her. He held her out of the window, his hand around her throat. She was too weak to fight back. He killed her. And there was nothing I could do about it.” Harry let out a giant sob.
“Before I came to Hogwarts, I lived full time with a muggle family. My Aunt, my Uncle, and cousin.” Harry lightly gestured to Ron and Hermione. “You have met them.”
Harry looked into Draco’s eyes for permission. The blond simply squeezed Harry’s hand in response. “We are a thing. More specifically we are in love. We have been dating since around Halloween. Apparently the castle has nothing against smuggling other boys into the Gryffindor dorms, which has worked out rather well for us.”
-All people in Harry’s year were forced to return to Hogwarts for an 8th year so that they could make up for the time they lost the previous year and study for the NEWTs
Draco flushed. He wasn’t supposed to be here. This was not how they were supposed to find out. Draco forced himself to look at the Gryffindor, and was surprised at who it was.
“I love it when you call me that.” Harry said sleepily. Draco huffed and took Harry’s face in his hands, forcing the sleepy boy to look him straight in the face, or as best as he could without his glasses. “Besides love, I thoroughly enjoyed your facial expressions as I kissed your precious neck right in front of them. You blushed so pink, I saw Parkinson look under the table even!” Harry chuckled at the memory and Draco blushed scarlet. Harry finally sat up and put on his glasses and grabbed his wand.
When they entered the room, they saw Ron and Hermione lying peacefully together next to the warm fire.  Draco noted. The blond placed Harry in one of the cozy armchairs, folded the Cloak, and tucked it into his pajama pocket. Draco bent over to gently wake up the sleeping couple, but Harry tugged on his shoulder and forced himself to look into Draco’s eyes.
Pansy finally spoke up. “Which Slytherin is the question!” She said, with a mischievous grin on her face.
“Don’t even try, Draco.” He said, ignoring the gasps from the table. He grasped his boyfriend by the shoulders and hair, bringing him into a deep kiss. Still in shock by what was happening, Draco stood there for a moment, then realized that there was no point in pretending anymore. He slung his arm around Harry’s waist, drawing him even closer. The entire hall erupted in cheers and catcalls. Harry heard a few ugly names, but he didn’t even care. He was in a whole other world, one with just him and Draco.
“I know. I am sorry, guys. I know I should have said something. I never wanted to think about it. I was only ever happy when I was with you three and our other friends, and I couldn’t ruin that. I had let the dark take over every other aspect of my life, and I wasn’t quite ready to open my relationships up to it, even if it would help me heal. I know I should have trusted you, but it was too hard. I…” Harry couldn’t finish his sentence, and no one pressed him too. He had been so, so brave already and if this was the most he could say at that moment, then that was that. “I promise I will tell you the rest some other time, but can we please, please talk about something else right now?” After a few seconds with no one pressing him to say anything else, Harry relaxed. He felt free, as if a huge weight he didn’t know was there had been lifted off his shoulders.
Ron cleared his throat loudly, looking very uncomfortable with the situation. “Well,” He said looking at his best mate, “I don’t mind you liking blokes, ‘Mione’s thought you might ya know - be gay for a couple years now,” Hermione blushed and gave a half smile to Harry. “But, a Slytherin?!” Ron said. Harry forced himself not to roll his eyes. Leave it to Ron to put house loyalty before sexual orientation.
Draco, Ron and Hermione’s eyes widened and Harry forced himself to look up at them, or as best as he could with no glasses and his eyes red and puffy as he cried. Draco grasped Harry’s hand and held it tight.
Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoy the story! It is pretty angsty (idk what got into me today!)
“Yeah, ‘Mione is right mate. Merlin knows I can’t say it better than her, but I really don’t mind that you are gay. Looking back it was rather obvious. You never seemed to really enjoy the kissing part of relationships with Cho or Ginny. You called your first kiss ‘wet’ mate! I should have known then.” The group shared a collective laugh. “But seriously, we won’t let anything happen to you, and going to see someone will really help.” Ron looked at Harry with a caring smile.
-Hedwig was gone before the Order came and picked Harry up at Privet Drive (Before the Battle of Seven Potters took place) (Sorry for the strange wording, it will make sense when you read the story! Promise!)
“Harry, it is okay. I am taking you to see Ron and Hermione. They can help you.” Draco quivered quietly. The boy whilted back into the taller one’s arms, still too disoriented to think properly.
Hermione gasped and Draco and Ron flushed white. “Oh Harry…” Hermione said, her voice quivering as she took in what was in front of her. Across Harry’s back were several long scars. All deep and painful.  Draco thought.
Tell me how you liked the spacing in the comments! Also, tell me how you liked the story  in general and if there is anything you would like me to write about, or if you have any criticism. :)
“Your friends are right, Love. We all have your back, and will always support you no matter what.” Draco said as he gave Harry a short and sweet kiss. He then turned to Ron and Hermione. “It meant a lot to hear that from you lot. I hope we can be proper friends.” Draco said with a smile. He held his breath, but exhaled with relief as both Ron and Hermione smiled back at him.
It was mainly the sixth and seventh years that gave them trouble. The 8th years were too tired to fight, and they all knew that the war had hurt everyone. The first few months had been difficult, but now there was a silent truce that existed between them. It helped that there was no avoiding each other, really, as they all shared one common room and main schedule. Fighting would have made the year miserable, and there was already enough stress about the NEWTs and the war.
“Get up!” He said at Harry, then realized that that wasn’t possible, as he was sitting on top of the Gryffindor. He blushed and got out of the bed, being careful to stay inside of the curtains.
Neville looked away as Draco pulled the clothes onto a shaking Harry. “They normally stay in the common room. I hear Ron go down the stairs every night. Dean and Seamus normally spend the night in the Room of Requirement...apparently ‘the beds are too small.’ The kinky bastards.” Neville chuckled quietly. “Harry must have turned into a deep sleeper. He wasn’t in sixth year and before.” Neville and Draco blushed simultaneously as Neville realized what had happened. Draco had charmed his shoes, and always used Harry’s Cloak when he snuck in each night, and out again in the early morning.
“Playing games, passing notes, and holding side conversations. I’ve never had an issue with capturing a class’s attention before.” Harry grumbled, feeling out of sorts seeing Malfoy taking notes on him.
He made a sharp turn and suddenly the tall grass melted into a maze of empty tables and chairs that were so massive he couldn’t see the tops of them. He raced through the larger-than-life table legs, dodging falling drops of champagne until he found his way to the dance floor.
Draco glanced around, trying to mask his awe at the dimly lit room with hundreds of seats arranged into neat rows. They were facing a massive white sheet of some material Draco couldn’t name and he cast Harry a questioning look. Harry just winked at him and lead him towards the back, climbing the strangely lit stairs. The theater was already quite full and people were still filing in, making mad grabs for the best seats and saving spots for friends who hadn’t arrived yet. Draco and Harry had managed to snag seats in the middle of the second to the last row, something Harry seemed quite pleased about.
"You poor thing, come here." Daphne pulled him over to a bench that had been used as a prop in their last production. When they were both seated she took his hands and gave him such a comforting smile that Draco almost started crying in earnest. "Why don't you tell me everything?"
“You said you had originally thought you were under the curse for eight years. That implies you believe differently now. What changed?”
Pansy opened her mouth to say something but movement from the lake cut her off. Fleur Delacour had broken the surface, ending her bubblehead charm as she swam to shore. Draco couldn’t help but notice a distinct lack of a missing object.
“We all thought that if you came back, it would mean revolution. That we were going to overthrow Snape and the Carrows.” The single Slytherin that had joined the throng piped up. Harry thought her last name was Clio, but he couldn’t be sure.
“Hermione! I didn’t see you come in!” A raven haired witch exclaimed happily, flitting to her side. “And you brought both of your boys! Excellent! Drinks and snacks are in the kitchen.”
“You would have liked her, my Nymphadora.” Andromeda turned to put the kettle on, bustling around the kitchen aimlessly. “She had a warm heart and a wicked sense of humor. Not a day went by that I didn’t hear that girl laughing about something. She had an indomitable spirit, you know. She didn’t give a damn what anyone else thought, she simply marched to the beat of her own drum.”
“Alright, let's get this over with.” Harry sighed, eyeing the gloomy library wearily. “Draco, I want you to stick close this time. A lot of nasty things could have taken root in those shelves and I have a feeling we will need you nearby.”
“Not if she had already moved on to Krum. She did go to the ball with him.” Draco scowled, doing his best not to imagine Harry running his fingers through her bushy hair as they snogged in a nondescript room.
“Ah, ickle Ronniekins. You have my sympathies.” George grimaced as Harry settled on the threadbare couch between them.
"Yeah. Especially when you don't style your hair. It looks better down." He scratched his nose awkwardly.
As the first strains filled the theater Draco purposefully ignored Pansy's pointed glare. When she tried to pester him about where he had been he shrugged her off and closed his eyes. He took a calming breath and allowed himself to get lost in the character of Tom Riddle, shoving all of his personal feelings, thoughts, and fears to the side. Everything went smoothly for the first few scenes, but then it was time for his character to fall in love with Harry.
"What an unusual girl." His father almost smiled. "Now, it seems I have quite a bit to think about, so I'm afraid I'm going to have to cut our time here short. You did very well up there tonight. I had no idea ballet could be so… enjoyable."
“I had just found out I was the last horcrux and that my last mission from Dumbledore was to die. I walked into that clearing without a wand, ready to die if it meant protecting my friends and the students and teachers of Hogwarts. Voldemort killed me with the killing curse.”
“It’s a beach party, why do I have to wear a collared shirt?” He asked as she forced them into his hands and pushed him towards the changing rooms.
“I see. Where would this security sweep be taking place, if I agree?” Bill’s expression gave nothing away.
“Might as well be.” Draco drew in a deep breath, bracing himself for an unpleasant evening. He was going to do his best to get along with the idiotic Gryffindors, for Harry’s sake, but he didn't have high hopes.
“That’s what I’m counting on.” Harry whispered, emerald eyes searching for answers to unasked questions.
"Oi, over here." A staged whisper caught his attention and he followed the sound. She was hiding in an alcove beneath the marble staircase.
"Harry, you were brilliant!" Hermione squealed. She had bright red scratches on her face from where she had been clutching it in fear. "You were fantastic! Really, you were!"
“It’s a bit more complicated than that. The Malfoy men are marked Death Eaters. The public would riot if we just released them.” The same haughty wizard that had ridden his last nerve at the trials snorted.
He followed him down the hall and into the drawing-room. When they rounded the corner Draco almost stopped. He was not prepared for what he saw.
The entire Wizengamot erupted into cries of shock and outrage. The roar of their voices gave Draco a headache. The Minister had to use the sonorous charm for the second time that day to call everyone to order. When at long last everyone was silent he resumed his seat at the high table.
“My mother is the editor in chief of Witch Weekly and she told me to cooperate with Skeeter and give her whatever juicy story Skeeter thought would sell. It wasn’t personal, it was just good business.”
“Is that it, then? Ravenclaw’s lost diadem?” He said instead and he kicked himself internally. What an idiotic thing to say in this situation!
The sound of the front door opening and closing was followed by an unnatural silence, broken only by Kreacher's muttering.
“That’s alright.” Draco said softly, unlocking the door and pulling Harry inside. He knew Harry usually went home directly after a date, but he didn’t think Harry should really be alone right now.
“I follow instructions!” Harry cried indignantly. “Just...sometimes I tend to get a little lost along the way.”
“Ah, yes, sorry about that. I was...delayed.” Draco cast an irritated glance at the crowd who were now watching their interaction speechlessly.
Almost a decade's worth of sexual tension was being poured into a single kiss and before too long it became slightly overwhelming.
He weighed the pros and cons of walking out on this session, and after some careful deliberation, he decided it wasn't worth incurring the wrath of Minerva McGonagall.
There were multiple cries of “Harry!” and “He’s alive!” echoing around the hall, but when the Dark Lord let out another furious snarl they all fell silent.
Was he sure about that shirt with these pants? He would be going to meet Harry for coffee after the manor, shouldn’t he look his best?
When he reached Bristol he had conceded that Harry was right about one thing at least. He had no right advocating gay pride when he was too scared to come out to his own father. After a quick stop for petrol and a bite to eat Draco found himself sitting alone on the cliffs at Severn Beach. He took solace in the solitude of the seaside. Sunlight danced across the water as his thoughts wandered. Draco was reminded just how much he loved the ocean, stunning in its endless beauty. The rolling waves seemed to whisper to him and he sat and listened until he could hear no more. Just as the sun began to set he got up to leave, casting the water one last longing glance.
"I think I could make that happen." Malfoy's arrogant smirk was back full force and Harry’s heart kicked into overdrive.
“You are running out of time, Draco.” Dumbledore leveled him with his gaze. “I think it is high time we discuss your options.”
“Mind? Why would I mind?” Harry finally tore his eyes away from the page and looked up at him. “Just the fact that you took the time to painstakingly draw me over and over again...filling all of these sketchbooks took a level of dedication I can’t even begin to fathom- it actually means a lot.”
“There will be no more sorting at Hogwarts school.” The Dark Lord said conversationally, stroking Nagini’s snout as she coiled around his shoulders. “There is only one house now. All of the others are obsolete. The emblem, shield, and colors of my noble ancestor, Salazar Slytherin, will suffice for everyone.”
“No, you’re being rash and reckless as usual. If it’s alright with you, I’d like to be on the same page here. This is over a decade’s worth of careful consideration on my part whereas you’ve thought about this for a mere seven weeks.” Draco said in an agitated rush.
“I can’t even imagine you being simple.” Harry rolled his eyes. “Other than Hermione, you’re the smartest person I know.”
“It looks like I accidentally knocked one of yours in, so I suppose it’s your turn.” Draco looked up with a much too innocent expression.
“If he almost killed you why did you defend him?” The excitable wizard in horn-rimmed glasses called over the voices of his peers.
“Wait, hold on-” He stepped back, just out of Draco’s reach. “I didn’t know you were an artist. You’re really talented.”
“Do you think he became a death eater because he was under the imperious curse?” The witch on the far end chimed in again.
He felt slightly guilty about the immense sense of repose that had washed over him, but he couldn’t bring himself to fully care. His family lived to see another day.
Draco hardly noticed as Dumbledore spoke. He gave a shite eulogy about a student he rarely interacted with and then told them all The Dark Lord was back. As if that weren’t obvious. Could there really be people who hadn’t figured it out? He glared around the hall. How many people would shout ‘death eater’ at him when they came back? At all 5 of them? Then the most terrifying thought of all… How long until those accusations become true?
Harry shot one last wave to his friends before trudging off towards the Dursleys. It would be nice to not have to pretend to be alive. The Dursleys wouldn't notice. Even if they did, they wouldn’t care. He was free to wallow. To watch Cedric die every time he closed his eyes without needing a silencing charm. It would be a relief to just stay in his room, make no noise, and pretend he doesn’t exist. So in between scavenger hunts for news and the occasional walk to blow off steam, that is exactly what he did. As time wore on he became less apathetic and more angry. Why didn’t anyone trust him? Why wouldn’t they tell him anything? Why was he, the one who watched Voldemort return, forced to find clever ways to listen to the Muggle news because no one would tell him what was going on?! Anger was an emotion. Emotions were healthy, right? Being angry was better than being numb, so he ran with it.
They seemed to fall less often when they skated hand-in-hand, but their falls were much more spectacular. Draco’s side ached from laughing so much at some of their more epic wipeouts. They bickered playfully and it was strangely reminiscent of their verbal altercations at Hogwarts. Draco loved the familiarity of it. He was comforted that their budding relationship hadn’t diminished their strange, antagonistic form of flirting. Over the next two hours, they both became much better at keeping their feet and Harry even convinced Draco to try skating backward. It ended disastrously, but it was fun nonetheless.
“You come for dinner once a week indefinitely. You can even bring Malfoy if you want to, just pop ‘round for a meal. We don’t always have to chat, so if you’re not feeling up to company don’t consider us company. Just let us feed you and make sure you’re alright. Do we have an accord?” Bill held out his hand.
She briefly considered leaving and just finding another bar, but that would take effort she simply didn’t want to expend. A heavy sigh escaped her lips. There was nothing for it.
"Nice." Draco raised one eyebrow as he considered the complexities of dating two people at the same time.
Draco trembled slightly as he felt Harry’s hands moving hungrily across his body. Was this really happening? He leaned forward until Harry’s feet were firmly back on the ground before taking complete control of the kiss.
“No! No, no- you stop this! You stop it this instant! STOP!” Myrtle screamed, splashing water all over the floors in her agitation.
“You’re such a bitch sometimes.” Tracy snapped, carefully marking her place before closing her book and standing up. “Come on, Daph. Let's leave Pansy to fondle her Gryffindor lover in peace.”
“Don’t you dare, Potter.” Draco dug his heels into the floor when Harry tried to pull him onto his lap.
The entire courtroom erupted into chaos and Harry was mildly amused. He had never intended on anyone outside of his small circle of friends knowing he was the last horcrux. Seeing everyone’s intense reaction, however, was somewhat entertaining.
“No.” Madame Juliette breathed. “No, I think that was perfect. If we can all keep this energy till our last show I will be thrilled.”
"They must have been a memorable two. Weren't you with one of the Weasley twins at some point?" Draco supplied helpfully, thinking back to when Pansy had done some digging for him.
Not being forced to socialize? There was no way he could pass that up. Besides, the painting was rubbish. This bet was practically already won.
The ministry has fallen. Hogwarts is being run by Death Eaters. Harry realizes something profound and Draco does what he can to help. How will this first year of open war end?
Then Harry’s words sank in and Draco’s breath hitched. Sure, they had been on a few dates and they fancied each other, but they hadn’t explicitly stated that they were dating yet. He didn’t know if it was too soon to put labels on it and he hadn’t wanted to make Harry uncomfortable by pressing the issue.
“Yes, my Lord. Thank you for this most gratuitous opportunity.” His father knelt before the Dark Lord and the others followed suit.
“What’s going on? Why does Draco know Dumbledore is off campus?” Hermione’s eyes were narrowed in curiosity but she didn’t look scared.
“It was a rivalry, we were young and clever and just stupid enough to let our brains get us into trouble. Your dad and Snape hated each other. They each hexed the other any chance they got, it wasn’t one-sided.”
"Good morning masters." Kreacher greeted them in a tone that made Harry feel like it was meant as a scolding.
Hermione and Pansy had seemed alright on Sunday, but they could have just been playing nice for Draco’s birthday. He hadn’t spent any one-on-one time with them in too long. They probably thought he was a horrible person.
“Don’t worry, these are just the early birds. The rest of the guest list apparently likes to be fashionably late.” She casually moved the group towards the boombox.
“I…” He struggled with the surge of emotion welling up inside of him. “Thank you. That really means a lot.”
“I don’t have to put up with you, it’s a genuine pleasure to be your friend.” She insisted. “I can’t believe we wasted our school years hating each other. Imagine the study guides we could have made!”
“Voldemort needed leverage to force Draco to cooperate. Lucius was in Azkaban and he wanted Draco to take his place.” Harry glanced down at Draco again, He was staring at his hands sullenly, his pale blond hair falling across his eyes.
“Pie it is then.” Harry nodded, pulling the birthday candles out of his pocket as he made his way over to the counter. “Go ahead and sit down, I’ll bring it to you.”
Longbottom grabbed at the sword and swung around, brandishing it at the Dark Lord. He laughed as he deflected the blow, sending the sword flying. It landed roughly ten feet away from where Draco stood and he looked over at Harry. He was still laying as still as a stone at the Dark Lord’s feet. He had said the snake was the last Horcrux. If he killed the snake, the Dark Lord would be mortal once more.
Draco tried not to let their familiarity bother him, but something about it made him mildly uncomfortable.
Thoughts of being trapped down here for the rest of eternity spurred him to move faster. The scent of damp earth and moldy wood assaulted his nostrils, getting stronger the farther away he crawled from the shrieking shack. After what felt like an eternity he understood the source of the smell. A wall of interwoven tree roots blocked his path.
"Yes, well Druella was a batty old woman and Cygnus was always more on the vapid side." Draco grimaced. "I don't mean to speak disrespectfully of my ancestors, but they would have to be incredibly obtuse to prefer Bellatrix over you."
“We’ll see if it sticks.” Harry shot him a lopsided smile and Draco’s heart melted just a little bit.
“You’re good people. You don’t owe me anything. In fact, consider it payment for my debt to you for saving my life during the war.” Harry waved him off, brushing Draco ever so casually with his arm.
“Come with me." Draco grabbed his hand and led him into the living room. "We are going to sit here until either you feel better or we fall asleep, whichever comes first."
Draco spat on the floor and wasn’t shocked to see blood. He was pretty sure he had bit his tongue during the last round. He gingerly ran his tongue across his teeth and winced when he found the sore spot.
“I prefer to think of it as sharing my vast amounts of knowledge with the less academically inclined.” She sniffed.
“-is doing everything he can to defeat You-Know-Who, so sod off, yeah? If he thought clueing us all in would help defeat the right bastard, Harry would clue us in. If he is keeping secrets, there must be a very good reason. So why don’t we all just shut up, put all of our personal feelings aside, and listen to The Boy Who Can Take Two-”
“I’m glad you like it.” Neville beamed. “I didn’t really know what you drink, so I took a stab in the dark.”
“I was only saying — she was with the others, they were with Hagrid! As far as detentions go that's pretty tame! You heard Dean and Ted, they weren't worried! They know Ginny can look after herself!”
“The pleasure is all mine, Mr. Weasley. I have a quick breakfast prepared for you inside if you would like to follow me.” His mother gave them one last gracious smile before heading back down the drive, not bothering to check if they were following.
“I know that now,” Harry said gently. “I didn’t know what a self-righteous prat I sounded like back then either.”
It was as if her entire personality had changed. This Tonks was a shell of the one he met last summer, making Harry slightly worried for her.  Was this all the effect of what had happened at the Ministry?
They took turns pointing out different constellations and talking about nothing in particular. It might have been a dull end to their evening to anyone else, but to Draco, it was perfect. It wasn’t terribly long till Harry was snoring softly and Draco smiled. He repositioned himself slightly, cradling Harry close, before allowing himself to nod off too.
“Don’t be daft, Tracy.” Pansy scoffed. “It’s called the TRI wizard tournament. There are only supposed to be three champions. Do you honestly think Potter is smart enough to trick the Goblet? He can’t even do a simple summoning charm right.”
“Don’t mention it. She was out of line.” The woman waved him off. “I don’t agree with your choices either, but I won’t deny you your right to make them.”
“Yeah, I know what Dumbledore said.” Harry nearly growled. He took a deep breath and then looked back at her. “Sorry. Didn’t mean that. You’re right, of course.”
“It was Draco.” She said simply. “When I realized that there was even the smallest chance to save my son, every fiber of my being fought to do just that.”
“How would you describe your relationship with Narcissa Malfoy?” The severe-looking witch cut across the haughty looking wizard who had opened his mouth to speak.
“Of course I did, we still have a whole day to spend together.” Harry felt his stomach flutter at the way Draco’s face lit up.
The gardens of Malfoy Manor echoed with friendly conversations peppered with laughter and the gentle tinkling of cutlery on plates. Narcissa sat back in her chair with a fresh glass of white wine and observed the people gathered around the table. Draco sat in the seat of honor at the head of the table, eyes alight with excitement and smiling so much it made her cheeks hurt just to look at him. On his right sat Harry in all of his charismatic glory, doting on Draco while still managing to include the others in the conversation. Hermione and Pansy sat across from Harry, holding hands beneath the table like a couple of love-sick teenagers. A year ago she would have never believed that she would be playing host to Harry Potter and Hermione Granger, let alone that she would be entertaining them for Draco’s birthday. So much had changed in the two months since their release. She watched as Hermione smacked Draco’s arm playfully after he and Harry erupted into gales of laughter- most likely at her expense, judging by her expression. Pansy was regarding the three of them with fond exasperation, speaking out in her girlfriend's defense when Harry continued the joke. Seeing the four of them together filled her with a satisfying joy.
The unmistakable sound of a duel suddenly filled the corridor. A cacophony of noise was making Harry’s head throb; people shouting, screams of terror, giants roaring from outside the windows. It was all so overwhelming. He barely had time to register that the diadem was destroyed. When they came to the top of the stairs Harry’s heart seemed to fail. Death eaters had invaded the castle.
“Ah. Apparently you two were the last to realize you love each other. There was apparently a card game in – Not a card game? With a card game... A bet? Ah, there was a bet in Gryffindor on how long it would take you two to go exclusive. I can see that. Why you two couldn’t is what amazes me. Hey, who won the bet?”
Draco turned the CD player off; Harry couldn’t possibly be listening anymore. In fact, Draco was sure Harry couldn’t breathe anymore. Thinking he didn’t like it, Draco took the CD out of the player, put it back in the case, and then started back to their rooms to get rid of the gift. It hurt that Harry didn’t like it. Hermione said they were some of his favourite muggle songs. He didn’t understand why Harry didn’t like what he’d done. Harry had told him several times that his voice was beautiful and amazing and that he loved it, so that couldn’t be it.
“Yes. We do,” Blaise answered. “Well, we’re off. I brought our bags and a portkey with us so off we go.”
After coming forward and kissing his robe, the man began to speak. “We were successful, my Lord. All of the crystals were obtained in a timely and efficient manner. All muggles in the area were killed… eventually. A few of the others got a bit carried away, but the task was completed as you willed it.”
“No word, no news. I would like to know even if it’s just to say ‘Sorry kids. We have been investigating some people, but nothing has turned up.’ That would be better than nothing!” she sobbed. “I need him, Ron. I just… I can’t understand there not being the three of us. I don’t know what to do anymore. It’s so weird not having him around. He missed Christmas, Ron! He had presents waiting for him. I waited for him. I just want-”
involved. We’re not going to stop now. And I’m pretty sure you didn’t want to see that while it was happening. Therefore, if the door is locked we’re probably having sex.” Harry made a gesture. “Yes, or masturbating. Like sucks when you’re lost in the Forbidden Forest for five months.” There was a pause in which Pomfrey and Snape thought Draco had fallen back to sleep. Then… “No that kind of sucking you perv!” he almost shrieked, playfully slapping Harry on the shoulder. They both noticed he didn’t move away from the Gryffindor however.
Well-meaning as the redhead’s words were meant to be, they worried Harry. Draco was due in a month, and he already couldn’t leave his husband’s side. What was he supposed to do about Voldemort?!
“I need your memories. No, I need just one of your memories,” she corrected. “The one of two days ago when Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy came into your classroom. I need to see it so I may see for myself what happened. Not that I don’t trust your word, Severus. It’s just that you may have overlooked something that I deem important or unusual for one or both of the young men in question.”
Harry shuffled himself and Draco out of the way so Snape could leave to tend to Lucius Malfoy. As Draco cried into his shoulder, wondering why his godfather had betrayed them all, Harry tried to think of a way to calm his husband. He decided to just let the emotional outburst pass before he tried to explain anything. However, Harry nearly lost his patience in waiting for that moment of being done to arrive. When it finally did, Harry tried to explain things to Draco.
This time, Harry came first. It was a rare happening, but one that both enjoyed to no end. Then again, the mere thought of Harry filling him with his come, of that come producing the child that lay within his belly, of Harry losing control like that, was enough to make Draco follow directly after. They cuddled again, Harry hunching in around Draco for warmth and protection and just so they could touch one another. Again, Draco thought that the day apart thing was sheer torture, but only allowed the thought for a few moments before he turned his thoughts back to the nirvana he was in now. Again, another Muggle term. But it fit.
So I was going to make this a short story, kinda like my other two. However, I don’t think I can make too much of it. So, yeah. It’s a one-shot now. Yeah. That works for me. If you don’t like it, stop reading. Or don’t read at all. Or continue reading, complain about it, send me flames. My response will be: all flames are put in a jar and will be used when I take over the world. Because I will one day. I just have to learn who all I want to keep around. *crickets* I mean… *clears throat*
The fire roared to life as the floo powder hit it, but was quickly quiet again after Harry went through with Draco in his arms. He landed on the other side, just barely managing to turn his body so he took the brunt of the impact with the floor and sheltered Draco instead. When a hand touched his arm, he was on his feet lightning fast, cradling Draco closer to himself in case it was a threat. Instead, it was only Pomfrey. The fireplace beside him roared to life and then spit out Severus, albeit much more smoothly. “Poppy, these two walked into my office nice as you please not five minutes ago. They walked in as if not a day has passed, but once we reached my office…” He motioned to them as if in explanation.
. I got to thinking, I liked that fic too. So I decided to write another fic similar to that one. So this is for you,
Dimitri sat in stunned silence, his quill hanging precariously between his fingers. Draco let him have a moment, using the time to drink some more water.
“Come along Potter.” They walked to the doors leading to the hallway outside where McGonagall was waiting. “Minerva,” he greeted. “Potter is all yours.” He closed the door behind the Gryffindors.
“Yeah, I guess. If you want to, I mean.” He moved to the other side of the large bed and Harry crawled into his spot. “You sure you’re okay?”
“Draco, what happened?” Immediately, Pomfrey got to work, scanning the unconscious Gryffindor and Draco in turns to snuff out all injuries. Finding none on the young blonde, she turned her full attention on Harry. “Head trauma, magic depletion, physical exhaustion,” she rattled off quietly.
“You’re all bloody nuts!” Dr. Morris exclaimed. “You need to see a shrink not me. But yes, I can do this. I want no part in any sort of backlash from the media you might receive.”
There was a bright flash and a small snap. The pair looked up to see Colin Creevy standing over them with his camera in hand and a big smile on his face. “I knew it!” he pronounced loudly, snapping another picture. “Everyone else said that I was wrong, but I wasn’t!” Another two pictures of the stunned pair. “There was no way Draco and Harry could be an item for very long. There was too much of history there. But did anyone listen to me? Nope! I said that Blaise and Harry would get together and they all laughed. Well, I’ll be the last one laughing now!” He flashed another picture before turning and running off to tell the news and develop the pictures.
Where they would live was another matter. They could buy or build anything they wanted, anywhere they wanted. His father had offered the west wing of the manor, but until they knew where his mother’s allegiances truly lay that wasn’t really an option. Having a carrier, Harry Potter, and Harry Potter’s child under one roof was a thing of Voldemort’s dreams. If Narcissa Malfoy was even a tiny bit interested in pleasing the Dark Lord, it was too big of a temptation. He couldn’t live with that kind of pressure on him all the time, looking over his shoulder constantly. And the danger his child would be in? No. Just... Just no.
“The Forest has its own wards,” Shaklebolt said, looking at the Map. “This is amazing. Where did you get it from?”
All this occurred before Halloween. Corvus was only a month old. Harry had been terrified, but knew he had no choice. He was also terrified of waking his husband after returning to his side. Draco was going to be horrified and absolutely livid. They’d promised, in the Forest, to always stay together, to face whatever came at them together. Yet Harry went off on his own to face Voldemort. Harry didn’t see it that way. Of course, that’s what the two sides of the fighting was about once Draco was awakened.
“Like this for example,” she said, leading him into the Great Hall and right up the one of the larger bouquets on the table they were to dine at. “This is a bouquet of ivy, fern, tulip, poppy, and heather. Each symbolize something unique. He chose the fern, ivy, and poppy for both of you; the tulip for himself as a declaration of love to you; and the heather for you, as a symbol of the protection you’ve given him these last five months. There are Gryffindor and Slytherin colours here, red and green. He has brought people you are familiar and comfortable with to counterbalance Professor Snape. He and I are uncomfortable with one another, but have worked together for you. He is a remarkable young man, I must admit.”
Neither were allowed out of Snape’s rooms unless they were using the floo to go to Dumbledore’s office, but they were okay with that. They found plenty to amuse themselves within their room or the main room in their chambers. Even though it was possible, the professors didn’t want Harry and Draco in their own rooms. They felt it was better that they stay with a teacher, Snape preferably. And Snape wanted Draco close by. Just because he and Harry were getting along didn’t mean they liked each other.
“If you had offended me, Luciusss, you would be dead. I want your ssson here within the week. Underssstood?”
“Ah, ‘could’ being the key word there. Give me that.” He snatched the disk out of Harry’s hand, opened the case, and popped the CD into their player. Taking out his wand (Harry wondered where he kept it since Draco’s boxer briefs didn’t have much space in them), he tapped the player twice and said, “Play random mix.” Rock music suddenly filled the air, and Draco’s voice was singing the words.
“I’m sorry Harry, I’m sorry we did that to you. But I wanted everything to be perfect, and I knew you wouldn’t let me out of your sight. It’s just another few moments. You’ll go with McGonagall soon, and I’ll follow shortly with Severus. Then we’ll be married and nothing will be able to separate us. How does that sound? And we’ll have our baby soon!”
“No, you can’t do that. If you put wards up, how will Madam Pomfrey be able to come in and check on me and the baby? I know you can take care of us, but I don’t want you to have all that stress anymore. It was necessary before. Now we have Madam Pomfrey and Severus and Dumbledore to look out for us.”
“Excellent!” came the jovial answer. “I do believe Madam Pomfrey wishes that you have a bit of both, Draco. It is cold this night, no matter how spelled your robes are. Harry, my boy, how is your salad?”
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy. I don’t own Hogwarts, Diagon Alley, Hogsmeade, Privet Drive, or Fortesque’s. I don’t own the Knight Bus, Mr. Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia, the Hogwarts Express, the Nimbus 2000, or the Firebolt. Do we get the point yet? I don’t own anything. Except the horrors I’m about to put all of these people through.
Harry took the offered potion from his professor and threw it at the Dark Lord, causing the glass to shatter and coat the (man? Maybe…) in the potion. A silent scream was ripped from Voldemort’s throat since the silencing spell was still in effect. “Good-bye Tom, for the final time.
So, do we know the drill yet? I don’t own Harry Potter. I never have, and I’m pretty sure I never will. I don’t own Draco, Severus, Hermione, Hagrid, Petunia, Piers, Bane, or Fluffy.

So when Harry made a beeline for his husband’s ‘wrapped’ cock, Draco lay back and let him. The blue bow was removed with Harry’s teeth, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder if Harry knew that was a tradition too. But then he stopped thinking. Because Harry swallowed his cock down to the root. A flashback to the first time the Gryffindor had tried that almost made Draco laugh. It had taken the last two months to get to the point of going down on one another and not choking. But now Harry had no problems. At all. And,
She didn’t hesitate for a second. “It’s none of your business.” The three other doctors gasped at her audacity while Blaise just smiled and sat back. “This is Harry’s pregnancy, and I know there’s something out of the norm going on here. I believe that you are married, but… and I’m sorry if I overstep my bounds, but you have always called him Harry. You don’t have any pet names for him. You mentioned you were married within the last week, but his pregnancy is two months along now. If I were to become Harry’s mediwitch, I would talk to him about everything. If he wished you present, so be it. If there was something he did not want you to know, I would not tell you. Unless it was life threatening. I am not asking that you tell me what’s going on; it’s none of my business. I am here to take care of Harry and his baby.”
“I am. Draco asked me to meet him here, to talk about something. I, too, have something to tell him.” Once more, his hand covered the plane of his stomach.
“He…” Draco stopped to think for a moment. “By doing what he was told? By coming back from missions successfully?”
Meanwhile, Dumbledore had laid one hand over Harry’s forehead and the other over his heart while Madam Pomfrey chanted in a low smooth voice. Hermione ran back into the room with the two requested potions in hand. Other than the chanting, all was silent. Once the headmaster removed his hands, the matron took one potion at a time and coaxed them down the unconscious Gryffindor’s throat.
“McKay Draconis Zabini. But it’s only Zabini because I was married to Blaise when he, he being McKay, was born.”
“No. I told them that I liked to be on my knees bound and gagged, that I like being at your mercy while you torture me with hands and tongue... and toys.” He grinned evilly.
Blaise led the other three doctors away and performed the memory charms so they would not remember this morning and then sent them on their ways. Harry took Dr. Rhodes to his personal chambers and sat her down on a couch there. “I wish to tell you my situation. Blaise knows all of this, so feel free to speak with him about anything. Blaise and I are married, and that is it. Neither of us love each other, neither of us ever thought of marrying the other before two days ago. This is not Blaise’s child. We just graduated from Hogwarts not even four days ago. I am in love with Draco Malfoy, and this is his child.
Severus, that’s who cared. The poor man had walked in on the two more times than he could count. They didn’t close their bedroom door, and they weren’t always in their bedroom to begin with. No amount of yelling or threatening worked on them; they continued their liaisons wherever they pleased. Only to himself would he admit that their flexibility and stamina was quite impressive, especially with as big as Draco was getting.
Harry had been writing back and forth with the Headmaster to come up with a plan to deal with the publicity of the attack, the results, the pregnancy, and his marriage. He was mostly worried about the fallout from his marrying a ‘death eater’ and what might happen to Draco. Harry had always hated the press and how they were so fickle when it came to him – one day he was The Boy Who Lived, Savior of the Wizarding World and the next he was the next Dark Lord or some crazy wizard who couldn’t control his magic or who knew what else they’d come up with in his absence.
“I know that, and I won’t keep you long.” A quick look around showed too many people could overhear their conversation. “Walk with me.” They walked out of the room as calm as anyone, not drawing attention to themselves. It took a few steps, but Lucius finally started talking. “I am repaying my life dept to you, have been for some time now.” Severus’ steps faltered. “I know you are spying against the Dark Lord, Severus. Put your wand away, you fool. If I had wanted to turn you in, I would have some eight months ago. I’ve had suspicions for over a year; known about it for eight months.
“No, but it’s bloody annoying not being able to feel anything. I mean, those are my bits down there!”
Harry stepped up behind Draco and put his arms around the near-crying young man. But Draco shook him off.
Draco was sat on the edge of the bed while Harry stood between his legs as much as the pregnant belly would allow. Draco’s hands began removing Harry’s clothes. Harry’s hand moved down to Draco’s prick and began to slowly massage the leaking appendage. Draco cried out. He was so hard and wanted his husband so badly. He tried to undo Harry’s jeans faster, but his fingers kept fumbling. He growled into their kiss in frustration.
Harry stared at the bouquet for a few moments longer before turning to his Head of House, placing his right fingertips over his lips, and then pulling them away. It was his sign for ‘thank-you’. McGonagall seemed to understand all on her own. They embraced for a moment, before pulling away. She started to explain other things to Harry while they waited for Draco and Snape to arrive. As soon as the doors opened, Harry turned to look at the entering pair. Draco was stunning, even with Snape at his arm. As quickly as his unbalanced body would allow him, Draco made his way to the front to stand with Harry. Snape stayed at his side.
Sunday came, and so did Harry and McKay when it was dinner time. He held McKay in his left arm while he ate with his right hand. Blaise asked him how he was doing and if everything was okay. Harry simply nodded. When he was done and McKay began to get fussy, Harry stood to leave. Blaise reached out and took hold of Harry’s wrist to stop him. “Will you please not leave? Not tonight. You’ve been doing this for months, and I’m worried Harry. You lock yourself up in that room. It’s not good for you or McKay. What’s wrong?”
“Just before McKay was born,” Harry began, his eyes growing in shock as he answered an answer he didn’t know he had. “I wasn’t feeling well and went to Blaise’s room. I knocked, and then entered. I asked if he would mind sharing his bed, and he said he didn’t. Then he scooted over to the other side of the bed and I crawled in, keeping to my side. We fell asleep for a few hours.” There was a moment’s pause. “We didn’t have sex!” Harry explained. “We slept together, literally. We were sleeping in the same bed. The question was just worded weirdly.”
“No, I'm setting the record straight.” He shrugged out of Draco's hold and staggered to the side. After righting himself, he continued. “If you really want to know, Draco likes to make me make him beg. That's right. Draco is gagging for me, probably even right now. He likes to be a slave to me.”
Harry’s eyes lit up and he motioned the sign for ‘knowledge’. “Really? You know a charm for that?” Draco wondered skeptically.
“Sev!” a voice called out. “Sev, is he okay? What happened? Is he alive? Did they hurt him? I just got here. What is that? Who cares? What about Harry? He’s alive, right? They didn’t hurt him? If they did I’ll kill them all. The prophecy may have been for Harry, but I’ll kill Voldemort if he hurt him. Is he okay? What happened? He is alive, isn’t he?”
Lucius Malfoy was now and truly fucked. He hadn’t prepared for this happening, hadn’t thought of the repercussions of his actions, hadn’t thought it would get back to the Dark Lord. But he should have know that it would! Potter and his son lost in the Forbidden Forest? Of course Dumbledore would come up with some kind of excuse. It had been six months since they’d had that detention. It was March now. The snow would begin to melt in its entirety so the search could begin in earnest. He wouldn’t spare a single knut to find his son. It would-
Harry began to rant about all the things he was suffering from, all the things that hurt him. He couldn’t stop, didn’t want to stop. He didn’t care who he was telling; Ron and Hermione were so concerned about saying something wrong around him that they had practically stopped talking to him altogether. Dumbledore didn’t try to do anything else with him, and all of his teachers had given up. Well, Snape still hated him. Now more than ever if the pensieve incident was anything to go by. Harry ranted about that too. Suddenly, he wasn’t ranting anymore and a pair of soft lips and strong hands held him in their grasps.
“Yes sir, master Blaise.” Kipper disappeared and came back a few moments later. “He says he’s just fine.”
“I don’t know. I was so emotional over losing Draco, because that’s what happened. I lost him. I was hysterical, not knowing what would happen to me or my baby. I grew up without knowing anything about my parents. I didn’t want that to happen to my baby as well.”
“I was afraid of that. I can take care of it, but it may take a lot of time. What about you? Is there anything that needs to be looked at right now?”
“We already know that,” Ron said, looking at the map. “We already checked the whole of Hogwarts. Harry’s not here. They really did-”
“Excuse me, Harry, Draco,” Luna interrupted. “What was that just now? Was there a blibbering humdinger about?”
Before Harry could answer his stomach growled. “I think a grilled cheese sandwich with roasted potatoes and some ranch dressing sounds better,” Harry said with a large smile.
“Set him down there Severus,” she sighed, and immediately began working. “Calming Draught and Dreamless Sleep I believe will cover it,” she said after a few moments of silence.
“Harry, it’s the middle of the afternoon.” With a slight groan, he started to stand up. Harry was right beside him, assisting him with his slightly off-balance girth.
“Harry’s not in training. Malfoy’s not in the infirmary. They’re both missing. In the Forbidden Forest.”
“I believe that is my part of the story,” Hermione cut in. “Harry spelled six charms two years ago, or so. Two for each of us. My necklace has a charm for Ron and a charm for Harry. Should either be in mortal peril, the charm will burn. It cannot truly hurt the wearer, but it is uncomfortable. Whatever has happened these past six months, his charm has turned warm many times.” Here, Draco scoffed. “But today’s was a searing pain, white hot. It was unlike any other time we’d felt it burn before.”
“We found traces of them, a few tracks,” she reported, her eyes widening at the ability to speak again and the words that were forming. “We didn’t want to get your hopes up, as the tracks are old, but we have doubled our search efforts. We brought in others so that Hagrid would not be missed, nor any of the other teachers.”
“Harry, Harry Potter. He’s been gone for so long now. Everyone knows the three of you are always together. It can’t be easy to split the three of you apart. I just wanted to say I’m sorry and that if Hermione, or you even, need someone to talk to that I’m here.”
Draco stood at the side of the crib and looked down into it. A simple mattress with a tiny pillow, a knitted baby blanket, and Draco’s old stuffed crup lay waiting for It to arrive. There were two outfits on the rail of the crib, one in soft green and one in soft purple. The couple was trying to avoid House colors as well as the obvious blue for boys and pink for girls. Not that they didn’t have blue and pink, dark green and bright red stuff for the baby. Just … trying to keep it to a minimum.
“Damn it!” Blaise swore. “I said I didn’t have time to explain and apparently you don’t know. Do you know where Draco is? Or where he could be?”
Harry blushed furiously and squirmed in his seat. “One. Draco Malfoy. And he’s the only one I’ll ever have sex with again.” His blush deepened. Draco gave him a peck on the cheek.
She mouthed her answer, but no sound came out. Before she could be questioned anymore, a loud sob came from the left side of the office. All eyes were suddenly on the boys there: Draco had his face buried in Harry’s chest and was clutching his robes tightly in his fists. Harry’s eyes were blazing; he had one arm wrapped around Draco and the other outstretched toward McGonagall. After a few moments, that hand lowered to wrap around Draco as well. He kissed Draco’s head, but kept his eyes glued on McGonagall.
So what was the issue? The problem was that Harry didn’t get happiness. Every time he got something good, it was snatched from him in an instant. Parents? Dead. Magic? Savior. Friends? Turned against him. And all the while, Voldemort was a looming shadow over them all. He was the only one that could kill the monster. How, though?! How was he supposed to kill a Dark Lord?!
“The House name isn’t even that important,” he bit out between clenched teeth. “We combined names, so it’s not like people won’t know. Why does anyone get a say in my life? my child’s life? What business is it of theirs? They don’t need to know. It hasn’t even been born yet! Everyone is all up in It’s business and it hasn’t even truly started life yet!” He wrapped his arms around his large belly as much as he could in a protective embrace. “You don’t get it, do you? No one needs to know about It. It’s safer that way. I can keep It safe if no one knows,” he whispered, a tear falling from one eye.
Harry tightened his grip on Draco and looked toward the door. A few moments later, Severus walked in. “Poppy. I came to retrieve my memory as well as to see if there are-” He froze at seeing Draco awake and sitting up in the bed. He was even more shocked that he was in Harry’s arms, even though he knew the two were expecting a child. “Draco.” He moved to hug his godson, but Harry maneuvered him away from the professor. “Fine. For now Potter. I want a full update on their conditions, Poppy. Do you know the story yet?”
He lead Harry out of the room, a room which is totally silent from the revelations that had been given. Ron took the initiative to get the guests out and clean the house quickly before he and Hermione left to go to their own home for the rest of the evening.
“Not right now they’re not,” Theresa said. “Now push or you’ll suffocate your son.” Harry pushed and a loud wail went through the air. “Again, that was just his head.” Harry took a deep breath. “And one more should do it. That’s it! It’s done and over with Harry! Hang on while I get McKay cleaned up.” There was a lot of moving around, lots of crying, and a little bit of noise Harry didn’t quite get. “Here is McKay Draconis Zabini, born December 22 at 4:09am. Say hello to your son Harry.” She handed the wrapped bundle to Harry and then went to cleaning and setting things to rights around her and the area.
Harry released Draco and then sat up so his legs dangled off the side of the bed, his back to Draco. It continued to stay silent, even after this.
“She makes it seem like I know what she’s doing,” Harry quipped. “Like I had any idea I could even get pregnant until I went to see Madame Pomfrey. She’s the one that chastised me for nearly an hour about unprotected sex. Now there’s something I could have lived without.”
“Allow me,” Severus said, not happy about it. “It was a gift from Messieurs Wormtail, Padfoot, Moony, and Prongs, a group of students long since come and gone from Hogwarts. It was used, in their time, for pranks and sneaking about. Misters Potter and Weasley and Miss Granger have used it for sneaking about, and usually getting into trouble.”
“I am Harry Zabini, and I have no reason to work because I’m freaking rich and just had a baby.” He blushed crimson at the first statement. “I am under Veratiserum currently. I had Draco’s baby, but married Blaise because of a mix-up. Now Blaise and I wish to part so McKay and I may reunite with Draco. McKay is our son.”
Lucius Malfoy was pleading for his son’s life now. Severus was thrown off kilter for a few moments. Then, with a sneer and straightening of his back, Severus said, “I would if I could, Lucius, but I can’t do that.”
“What?!” four voices shouted. The sudden noise made McKay start to cry. Harry, surprised at his own answer, took a second to respond to his child. He finally shushed him by magicking a bottle and giving it to the hungry and surprised little boy. Draco decided to continue from his earlier outburst in the mean time. “What do you mean you’ve slept with Blaise?! You just said a second ago that you’ve only slept with one person and that was me and that’s all you’d ever want or need. And now you’re saying you’ve slept with Blaise?!” He turned to face Blaise. “I thought you said you hadn’t had sex with him!”
Blaise stood and went over to him, grasping him gently by the shoulders. “Harry, Harry look at me. It’s okay. I don’t appreciate being yelled at, and neither does Theresa. But we know why you’re doing this. A man was never made to get pregnant, and the chemical unbalance in your system is making what normal women go through twice as hard because you’re a man. I’m not saying it’s okay when you throw your tantrums, but we do understand why they’re happening. It’s okay, as long as you know you’re doing it and feel remorse for it, genuine remorse. Now, we were talking about you. Would you like to know why we were talking about you?”
Harry’s face was swollen, making him almost unrecognizable. Draco would know his face anywhere, though. He had drawn it enough times to be familiar with every inch, every angle. The Weasel and Granger both looked worse for the wear as well, tied up on either side of Harry. A party of snatchers were hovering over them, grumbling unhappily amongst themselves. Draco jolted when he recognized Fenrir Greyback among them. That would be just Harry’s luck, wouldn’t it? To be picked up by the most violent and bloodthirsty Werewolf alive?
“If you overreacted, then I went nuclear.” Draco chuckled and Harry’s head snapped up, finally meeting his gaze.
“How did you know I love the sea?” He asked quizzically, allowing her to lead him into a beautiful guest bedroom with white floors, cream-colored furniture, and turquoise walls.
“Why not?” Draco struggled to banish thoughts of wagering impossible things like the loser having to kiss the winner. “What are we betting?”
By the time Draco and the ginger made it back inside Theo was on his third Long Island. He watched as Draco ditched the redhead and started flirting with a burly man wearing leather by the billiard tables.
She was in a much more beach-appropriate sundress made from a gossamer fabric printed with sunflowers over a cream-colored under-dress and her unruly curls were piled in a wild messy bun.
“It tastes like grass clippings.” Draco looked at him as if he were seriously questioning Ron’s sanity. “How do you drink this stuff?” he pushed the pint away with an air of disgust.
Pansy looked up to try and gauge her reaction. Her face gave nothing away, which was infuriating. They sat in silence for a long moment, facing each other with their legs tucked neatly underneath them before Pansy sighed.
Harry’s other hand moved to Draco’s cock and started pumping it in earnest, tightening and twisting every third or fourth pull. Draco jerked his hips into Harry’s hand once, twice and then was coming. He cried out, long and loud as his come landed on the bedspread. Harry kept up his slow thrusts as Draco milked his own orgasm from him. Though he couldn’t impregnate Draco again right then, he held still when he was done to just savor the moment and the feeling.
“As if that great oaf knows anything about this place. I’m going back to the castle.” He started walking, not bothering to worry about Harry or Hagrid or even Merlin himself.
“Harry wants to tell Weasley and Granger about us. That we’re okay, that we’re together, that we’re having a baby, that he’s blind and mute. I don’t know if I can do that. Tell them about him, fine. But me? I’m not friends with them, I don’t know them. I don’t really want to know them to tell the truth. And what if they hate Harry because he and I are together and having a baby and don’t want anything to do with him anymore? I couldn’t handle being the cause of that.”
“Potter stop!” Snape cried out, grabbing Draco by the arms and pulling him toward him to look at him closely. Harry and Draco both froze, and look of shock and confusion on Draco’s face and one of loathing on Harry’s. “Your nose is bleeding, Draco. You can’t play so rough. You could get hurt. Or the baby. Here, use this until I can get a Blood Clotting Potion.” He handed Draco his handkerchief and made for his personal rooms. As soon as Snape let him go, Harry pulled him back to him, signing
“How in blazes did you come across a nundu?!” Madam Pomfrey shrieked, trying (but failing) to keep the volume down.
“I concur,” Draco said. “We’re not discussing Harry’s sex habits. That is for me to know and you to fantasize about, Granger.” He smirked, settling back in his seat with a smug air about him.
“Lucius, you know as well as I do that the Forbidden Forest is an entity of itself. Nothing can be tracked unless it’s by foot in there. And we do not have the manpower to track down two students at this time with the force that is needed. We have cancelled all Care of Magical Creatures classes for the time being and Hagrid is practically living in that forest. He knows that forest better than anyone. We will find them, rest assured.”
“Simple blood thinner with an anti-coagulant potion,” Snape answer, glancing over Harry’s list. “This is almost perfect. You forgot one thing though: sliced caterpillars. They’re necessary for making the blood platelets thinner and therefore ineffective. Take the potion.”
“I didn’t!” Blaise said back, eyes wide. “I swear by Merlin’s name we’ve never been together like that. I was never interested in Harry in that manner. Yeah, he looks good, but I’m not gay Draco.” Everyone was silent then. “Hey, I’m not gay,” Blaise said as if just coming to the realization himself.
Harry walked up close to Lucius, wanting to help him first. He placed one hand on his stomach and one on his forehead to ease the pain Voldemort was causing. He closed his eyes and forced his magic into the other man, searching for where the pain was striking.
“Fine. I am not leaving the room however. I am only turning my back. Clap your hands or something when you are done, if you please.” Then he did just that, leaving Harry to get dressed on his own. Not ten minutes later came the clap that signaled that Harry was done. “Mr. Potter, Draco wished that everything be per–” Regardless of his doubts that the young Gryffindor was perfectly dressed and groomed in ten minutes, there wasn’t a hair out of place on the younger man’s head. His stubble had been shaved, his hair combed, his robes on and wrinkle free. “Amazing. Now, I have warded Draco’s door so that it is impossible for you to enter or even touch the door. However, I have allowed sound to pass through so that Draco himself may assure you of his well being. Come along.”
Harry slowly stood and moved behind Draco so he was cocooned in warmth and love. One of Draco’s hands moved back to grab a fistful of Harry’s cloak to bring him closer, but wouldn’t let Snape step back either. The blonde held the other two close, despite how much they hated each other. After a few more moments like that, Draco backed away. He laughed softly. “Sorry. I guess I’ve finally hit the mood swing stage. Three months next week you know.”
“It’s okay father,” Blaise responded with a smile as he placed his left arm around Harry’s waist. “Harry and I are off to one of the properties. We don’t think going somewhere public is a good idea. We want to keep this quiet until
Severus cleared his throat. “Draco, I was wondering if I could speak with you on a sensitive subject.”
Draco sighed, knowing better than to try and lie to Harry. “My father.” He felt Harry tense behind him. “I know, that was my first reaction too. But remember what Sev said? He tried to save me, tried to convince Sev to keep me as far away from the Dark Lord as possible. Doesn’t that mean that he really does love me, just that he never actually showed me?”
Two fingers at his entrance were hardly even noticed… until they were squirming inside him. A whole day,
” He turned to his godfather, still blushing but looking apologetic. “I’m sorry, Severus. This is my fault, not Harry’s. It’s the pregnancy. Madam Pomfrey tried to warn us that my … libido, would increase around month six. I didn’t realize just what she meant, that I’d lose all inhibitions. I have so little control over myself right now. And there’s certainly no ‘off switch’ that I’ve been able to find.” He couldn’t even look the older man in his eyes, he was so embarrassed.
Hermione began to cry tears of joy and she threw herself into Ron’s arms. “They might find him yet!” she cried. “He’s alive! Did you hear? He’s alive!” He just continued to hold her as she cried, his own eyes a bit watery. After a few moments, he nodded to the teachers in attendance and slowly made his way back to their common room with Hermione still clutching his robes in her hands.
“And sometimes you are, like last night. But it doesn't matter what they say. Let them think that you're the bottom in our relationship. It's more surprising when you whoop their butts at some later point in training or in the field or whatever. Let them think you take it up the arse for me every night and half the mornings. I'm okay with that. Just because I'm usually the one on my knees with my arms tied behind my back sucking your cock doesn't make either of us any less of a man. Come on, Harry. I feel like playing with toys tonight.”
“Harry, if it be your wish for Draco to be bound to you, place the ring on his finger.” He gently took Draco’s hand and placed it on Draco's left ring finger. “Harry, repeat after me.
Over the next several hours, Draco managed a few ice chips and another two contractions. Harry was captivated by the look and feel of Draco’s stomach as the skin rippled and their child beat against the confines of Draco’s belly. He couldn’t help but run his hands over the stretched taut skin as it contracted and stretched. He gave Draco back and feet massages to help with the discomfort there. They walked around the rooms a number of times, sitting on the couch or at the kitchen table or back in the nursery. At one point they stood under the shower spray, warm water cascading over them. Draco said it was helpful, but tiring the stand. He attempted a nap after that.
It turned out each layer was a different flavor. The first piece Harry tried was lemon custard; he passed that on to Draco with a puckered face. The next piece was a much nicer strawberry. Once everyone had a piece, they sat back down and resumed their conversations. Draco motioned Albus over so they could discuss their education.
“Come now, I couldn’t write what was on there and ruin the surprise now could I? Just wait a moment. I want you to appreciate this. It took me forever and a day to get everything together. And I had to ask Granger for help, Granger!”
Harry moved up behind his husband and wrapped his arms around the protruding belly. Surprised by the hard feel of the belly and the rippling of skin he felt, he moved around to Draco’s side and squinted his eyes in question. Draco sighed and nodded.
“Magical depletion takes a fair amount to accomplish,” Ron stated in a normal tone of voice. Everyone’s head swivelled to see who had spoken; the adults had forgotten about the two young Gryffindors and Draco had not noticed their entrance due to his relief that help had finally come. “I know Harry’s powerful, but what did he do in such a short amount of time that his magic is nearly gone?”
“That’s enough excitement for one day,” Theresa announced with a slight laugh. “It’s time for a check-up. Come on you two. Will Blaise be joining us today, Harry?”
They decided their first interview would be an overall story about the obvious: the history between the pair, the detention, the issues they struggled with, the pregnancy, and their marriage. They’d found a way to strategically mention the pregnancy and the marriage at about the same time during the interview so it wouldn’t be obvious Draco had been knocked up prior to their wedding. It was just gauche to admit such a thing.
“I hate this, just for the record,” Draco griped, but obediently stepped forward and allowed Dr. Morris to slip a few short strands of hair from his right temple. “Can you tell that she took any hair?” he asked.
“I believe there is much the two of you need to discuss,” Dumbledore stated, rising to his feet and making to leave. “I will leave you to it, and return to Severus’ side. Soon, he will wish most vehemently to return to his own rooms. Poppy will need some help to deal with him then.” He chuckled and left the room, closing the door to Snape’s rooms as he left.
