He directed a deliriously happy Kreacher to put the tray on the bedside table and dismissed him, the murmurings of how much of an honour it was to serve a real Black heir fading as he went. He was unsure of how Draco would react to Harry, never mind a slightly batty old house-elf.
“Malfoy?”
Once everyone had finished their driving, Miss Bumble herded everyone back into the classroom to collect their results and hand out their homework — some ridiculous amount of parchment on the experience of driving, no doubt! As long as it didn’t involve actually driving any more Muggle vehicles, Draco didn’t care what it was.
“Because, you complete moron, I didn't want you to be around me just because I was having your baby. I’ve been waiting for you to come to your senses and kick me out, but instead, every day, you do these little things for me that make it harder to keep away from you. Subscribing to my favourite magazines, even though I know you never read them. You buy my favourite caramels and leave them for me in my room. The foot rubs you give me when my ankles get sore and swollen from lugging around your spawn all day.”
“You have a point, Longbottom,” Pansy nodded, turning to shove Ron and Blaise past Malfoy into the room. “That woman gets more terrifying the older she gets.”
“Are you sure? You seem— Forgive me, but you seem especially calm for someone who has just found out they have a grievous and potentially life-threatening sickness.” Draco could see the concern was genuine from the knitting of his eyebrows.
I’ve been running away all my life, Harry. I’ve been fucking things up since I was a child.
“Just go, Pans. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“Look, I’ll happily call whoever you want whatever you want as long as I get a drink sometime soon,” Seamus grumbled, and everyone readily agreed that a good drink was exactly what the situation needed.
“It’s magic from within the core. I guess it makes sense, in a way, to include the essence of the person the restoration is intended for—” Draco froze as the implications of what Harry had said began to sink in.
“Nice duck postcard, Malfoy!”
“Yeah. At first I thought he must be up to something so I tried coming up with a list of evil duckling-related plots, but it turns out he’s genuinely looking after them. So, I sort of thought—”
Slowly, Draco nodded tiredly and allowed Harry to lead him into the en-suite to get cleaned up.
It had been a couple of weeks since their bonding, and for the most part, they managed to get along. Madam Pomfrey had checked him over the very next day, running test after test on him until, finally, she assured him of the rather obvious conclusion that his core was in much better shape. Harry had been amused at Draco struggling not to roll his eyes at the matron. Of course, it wasn’t an instant cure-all, and Draco would need to continue to ‘
“Oi, Malfoy!” His yell halted Malfoy in his tracks just outside the heavy library doors. “I want to talk to you!”
They turned back to watch the new family, all of whom had fallen asleep, bobbing together as a unit, their tails all linked to each other for safety. It was so relaxing to watch, and Harry’s heart felt lighter than it had in years.
“Hold on a second, you’re not just after a quick one, are you? You actually like her.”
“Why are you saying all this?” whispered Draco, as if terrified of what the answer might be.
Pansy nodded. "You've got this. We've been listening in this whole time, and you're doing amazingly. That whole thing with the wand? Priceless!"
extremely unbecoming and I am going to blame it all on the alcohol and the bond. And possibly on the ganache as well. At least we both slept like logs afterwards and neither of us was woken up by horrible nightmares. Huzzah!
"No! It's Draco bloody Malfoy, that's what! Look, just read this," she demanded, waving the parchment in front of his face.
I love you,
Harry watched as Malfoy struggled not to rise to the bait, huffing a quiet laugh when he saw that he’d obviously lost the battle.
“No. I don’t think I ever did. Not really.”
I don’t know if you will ever read this letter. I will probably be in a cell in Azkaban when you do. Just leave me there, please. I deserve it.
“What’s there to talk about? It’s done. That’s that.” Harry levitated his trunk and strode across the room, pausing when he reached the door. “See you around, Malfoy.” Draco wasn’t sure what hurt the most, the sight of Harry walking away or the fact that he was no longer ‘Draco’.
Draco found himself absently following alongside Greg on the way to the Great Hall. If he had ever thought about reconsidering his decision about Potter being his core mate, this only made him all the more certain that he had made the right choice.
As he rounded the corner, Harry couldn’t help but huff a small laugh at the sight of his pet bobbing around a flustered looking Draco Malfoy. He shook his head and made his way over. As he drew nearer, he saw that Treacle wasn’t interested in Malfoy, but his pet, who just happened to be a very handsome-looking male seahorse.
“I didn’t know, you know, that you were sick. You always seemed fine, and I made sure I never looked close enough to notice anything different.” Potter sucked his lower lip into his mouth and began to worry the plump pink flesh with his teeth as if he were debating how best to articulate his thoughts. “Everyone lied. They always did. The Dursleys, Snape, Dumbledore. Especially Dumbledore. I guess I was just waiting for the next great lie to come along. And then suddenly I’m the only one who can save the day again, and it was — it was just too close to home, you know?”
In the end, it was easier just to give in. And as Pansy and Blaise whooped and danced in victory in his front room, he focused on sucking air into his rapidly shrinking lungs. He told himself that it was only one night. Not even a whole night, a few hours, really.
“Shut it, Potter!”
“Guys! Stop!” Of all the times for his friends to bicker, this certainly wasn’t it. “He just stood there quietly. And then he locked the door and he just, sort of, sat on the floor… crying.”
As far as Hogwarts feasts went, this one was certainly extravagant.
Draco, whose face had rapidly grown redder and redder as Harry had spoken, looked like he was ready to erupt. He stepped closer to Harry until they were only a foot apart and abruptly pushed his weight into Harry’s chest, causing him to stumble back a step.
he was.
“Really? I’m not sure you could make it any worse.” Ron smiled jovially at Harry and clapped him on the back. Harry knew that although Ron was teasing, he supported whatever would make Harry happy, and that meant more to him than he would ever know.
“No.”
“I have an illness that’s affecting my magical core. The only known cure, a bonding with my core-mate, is unacceptable. I want to make a potion substitute. Maybe see if we could use Phoenix tears, or Murtlap, perhaps.”
“Shut it, will you both? What do you want?”
Draco had thought he’d gotten off lightly, having managed to avoid any sight or mention of the infamous Saviour and his two moronic friends. He’d, rather foolishly, thought he might be able to make his way through the night without having to deal with them. After all, surely the Golden Trio had better things to do with their time than to bother with a stupid reunion.
“Just Harry is fine, and tea would be great, thanks.”
“Draco, I told them everything—” Draco sucked in a harsh breath at the implication of his mother’s words, and he silenced her with the weight of his stare.
Take care,
“Well, the room obviously feels it’s doing something one of us wants,” explained Granger, rubbing her tired eyes.
his illness that had brought them all here, after all. Harry picked up the packages he’d dropped when he cast the Shield Charm and placed them carefully at the foot of the bed.
He missed her so much that sometimes it hurt to breathe, which was why he had made the desperate decision to slip a letter to Malfoy under his door before classes. He didn’t know what good it would do, but he'd poured his heart out in that letter. He only hoped Malfoy could find a tiny slither of compassion somewhere inside that stone cold heart of his, and let Treacle visit Atlantis.
“Because they’ll get infected, that’s why.” reasoned Harry carefully.
"Fuck, guys!" he groaned. "Do you bloody mind? If you can't get some decency, can you at least get a room?"
In lessons, he finds himself in Potter’s company a lot. If a partner is needed, Potter appears next to him as if it’s the most normal thing in the world. For weeks, Draco’s been having to work alone or partner with the professors, and now, suddenly, Boy Wonder is everywhere he looks. It’s not just in classes, either. When he’s studying in the library, Potter often finds him, sitting next to him in silence as they both work through their assignments.
“What—?”
At the mention of Draco, Harry felt his shoulders sag, the earlier panic beginning to creep back over him. He heaved a great sigh and leaned against the wall next to where Ron was standing. He was glad to see his friend had a sympathetic look on his face.
“No can do,” chuckled Hagrid with amusement. “I reckon they’ve already pegged you as their mother. Looks like it’s up to you.”
“Draco! Really, you should think about how you’re speaking to me!” His mother’s mouth had thinned dangerously, her eyes glinting wetly. Well, that was too bad, because he was upset too, and, at that moment, he was the injured party and had plenty to say. He pushed himself out of the bed and forced his wobbling legs to take his weight.
“He says: ‘
Emboldened by the way Harry’s body was undulating against his, Draco slid his hands along the waistband of Harry’s boxers, pausing briefly before shoving the material away to grasp the taught muscle of Harry’s bare arse.
“I agree, pyjamas and then we’ll go from there.” He forced himself to walk to his dresser and lift out a black t-shirt and a pair of grey bottoms. “I’ll change in the bathroom if that’s ok?” Then, without waiting for an answer, he went into the bathroom, closing the door securely behind him.
The instant the words were out of his mouth he regretted it. He heard a gasp from behind him, and suddenly had trouble staying upright. Draco. His chest was throbbing with loss for something he hadn’t even known he’d wanted, but before he could think of how to fix things—maybe ask Hermione to find him a Time Turner—Draco had already begun to move from his spot on the floor.
“You’re far more trouble than your worth,” Harry informed him as he gripped Draco’s wrist firmly and pulled him out of the toilet, through the crowds, and outside into the alley he’d arrived in.
“Can we try to stay on topic, Potter? You’re the one who wanted to talk this out.”
“What books?” Harry had the feeling that this was the wrong answer. Annoyance flashed across Hermione’s face and she looked to Ron for help, who silently shook his head at her in refusal to get involved.
He leaned his head back against the wall and sighed heavily, the stabbing in his lungs making the simple act that much more difficult. He tugged a shaking hand through his hair, letting his fingers form a fist, and pulled, hoping the sharp pain would help anchor him. It didn’t, but instead simply mixed with the pain that was already working its way through his body. The small reprieve he’d gotten from the bonding ceremony made the return of his symptoms that much worse. He knew he was nearing the deadline for the bond to be either consummated or nullified, but he just couldn’t bring himself to care.
The air in the small room was close and stale, making Draco wish he’d cast a Bubble-Head Charm before entering. It really shouldn’t have surprised him, given that Severus didn’t actually need fresh air anymore. He looked around at the familiar space as he waited for Severus to show up in his portrait, taking note of the many books and bottles lining the shelves. He couldn’t help but step closer, observing the many rare ingredients. Unicorn tears! Draco couldn’t believe it! They were ridiculously difficult to come by. Where had Severus got them from? As he reached out to lift the bottle for a closer look, a sudden low cough broke the silence, causing Draco to jump about a foot into the air in fright.
Backing away, she heard Blaise closing the door quickly while she pressed her palms to her face. "Oh my god! My eyes! My eyes!"
"Look, Pans, I know it's a shock, but it's not actually that big a deal."
“Hold on, I’ll be righ’ back.”
Well, Neville supposed regular sex with one of your best friends could be considered stress relief. He let out a nervous giggle, and the two men finally pulled apart, questioning grins on their faces.
turn to make
Draco sat on one of the stools at the workbench, almost falling over in his haste, and began to read the article, doing his best to keep his voice steady.
he thought as he poured a generous amount of wine into a glass. As he strode back into the living room and handed Draco his drink, he began to formulate a plan.
It was only a few hours into the new school year, and Harry had already reached his peak of social interaction. There was only so much staring, fawning, and demands for autographs that a person could take. Harry had had enough.
"What's all the bloody noise about, Pans?" Neville's sleep-laden voice came from the couch.
“Very well, Mr Malfoy, but if it persists please visit Madam Pomfrey for something stronger.”
“I’m not stalking him,” argued Harry in exasperation. “I just want to see what he’s up to.”
Harry and Draco both froze at the sound. The screech that followed would haunt Draco for the rest of his days.
Pansy yawned and poured another black coffee for herself. They'd ended up watching movies until late, and she still wasn't fully awake yet. She looked over at Neville's sleep-slackened face with a rueful smile; it was difficult to blame him for her having to be up early, but still, she wanted nothing more than to courie under the blanket with him and go right back to sleep.
“Why, Harry, I’d be delighted,” smiles Draco with only a hint of amusement. “The one by your foot, that’s Apus, since he’s the biggest. And that one there, the one in the water? That’s Cetus. Aquila’s the one that’s running around and pecking at stuff on the ground. The one that’s singing constantly? That’s Lyra. The one with the really skinny long legs? That’s Grus. Misca is the one always flapping her wings. I think she’ll be the first to fly, actually. Where is…Merlin!” Draco swoops down and scoops a drenched duckling out of the makeshift pond. “This is Pavoa. She’s constantly getting herself into trouble. I swear she must have used up nine lives already. There’s one more…where is she…ah! See there, in the longer grass? That’s Chamaelea. I swear she’s the stealthiest duckling around.”
Without further ado, and to Seamus’ great delight, the bottles of Firewhisky were opened and passed around the circle.
“Then believe me, shithead,” retorted Harry, grabbing Draco around the neck and pressing a punishing kiss onto his lips. “I love you, all of you, from your poncy manners to your Dark Mark. I love you. The question is, do you love me?”
With that, Severus sat down at the desk in his portrait and resumed reading his book. Draco wasn’t worried, however, he knew that Severus was still alert and would offer advice if he needed it. He pulled a large reference book back towards him along with the article, determined to choose the right components of Harry’s essence without verging on creepy territory.
However, you did leave a love bite the size of a fucking Quaffle on my neck and Orion was really suspicious about it. He asked me a million questions and I doubt that he bought the excuse of a weird rash caused by an expired potion. He was extremely grumpy and a little bit handsy. I seriously considered hexing his eyebrows purple as you suggested, but I’m terrified that he might fire me, so I just spat in his tea. Disgusting, I know, but incredibly satisfying.
“Oh fuck off. Don’t start that again!”
“How’s that possible?” Ron demanded, as he wrestled his shoe onto his foot.
Having felt she’d explained herself satisfactorily, Luna ignored the assortment of bemused and indignant expressions of her companions, intent on examining the intricate knotted pattern, tracing the loops of rope with her index finger. Draco couldn’t help but watch her as she traced the pattern, the blossoms in her hair giving her the look of a princess from folklore.
Draco tried his best not to wince at Harry’s bitter scoff, which was softened only by the self-deprecating smile he offered before continuing. “I’ve had so much useless advice on this whole thing I could cry.”
The room, although spacious when he first conjured it, was becoming more stifling by the second.
Then, mere minutes after they’d stumbled through the Floo, Harry felt Draco’s arse clench around his cock like a vice as Draco moaned his release. The thought that Draco Malfoy, Death Eater and arsehole extraordinaire, had just shot his load all over his fireplace tipped Harry over the edge, and he thrust twice more before stilling, his cock pumping Draco’s arse full.
"No reason," Pansy assured with a smile, "I just had a nice day is all. Nothing special. Now, will someone hand me my wine before Tom starts the quiz?"
“Salazar! Can’t you lower your voice? I’ve got a splitting headache.”
“I’ve messed this whole thing up, haven’t I?”
“You don’t want me to stop, Harry.” panted Draco, pressing his erection onto Harry’s. “I can feel how much you want this.”
He tiredly dragged himself out of Severus’ rooms and into the corridor, unaware that the Potions Master was watching him leave, his eyes heavy with sadness.
do? That I woke up one morning and thought how nice it would be to fuck you or die if I don’t?” His words seemed to snap Harry out of his self-pity, his lip curling as his burning green eyes met stony grey.
“Fuck off. If anyone’s to blame, it’s you lot,” Potter said, joining the fray.
He could see Narcissa’s mouth continuing to move as she expanded on the news she’d just hit him with, but he couldn’t make out the words. His ears were slowly being filled with a persistent buzzing like someone was inserting bee after bee into his brain. Pregnant. He knew what that meant, of course. It was the bit where
“It’s never worked for anything more than a Lumos before,” moaned Harry, as they began to leak pre-cum over each other, making the slide of their cocks that much better.
Once everyone was outside the room, they began to dress, each laughing and chattering about their predicament now that they were finally free.
“Well, I didn’t, not really. I just asked it not to place me in Slytherin, and it decided that Gryffindor was the next best thing. It was because of you, you know.”
“I’m going to clean these before I can heal then, okay, Draco?” Harry advises, looking carefully for any sign that Draco has heard him.
The other men exchanged glances. "No one," Harry answered. "And we kind of want to keep it that way for just a little longer. You can keep the secret, right?"
“Yeah,” agreed Ron around a mouthful of potatoes. “We’re all less likely to get random flashbacks of Voldemort getting his arse handed to him this way.”
“You know, for someone who spends their time practically stalking Malfoy, you don’t really notice much, do you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Neville nodded. "Make sure to release the oils from the leaves. So, is it serious with this girl?"
“It’s not illegal, is it?” He hadn’t considered that there might be some kind of fishy business going on that they would want his help with, but now, the possibility caused his stomach to flip over painfully.
“Harry,” Hermione’s voice had taken on a softer, but serious, tone. “I know you’re used to always having a problem to solve and Voldemort’s plotting to intercept, but it’s different now. You need to stop jumping suspiciously at everything and just enjoy not being under constant attack for once!”
“Yes, I can certainly understand how you could miss a large oil painting framed in polished gold gilding.” Draco couldn’t help but wince at Severus’ tone and decided to intervene before an argument ensued.
“Ah, welcome back, Mr Malfoy. I must say, you gave us all quite the scare.”
“Weren’t you all about to kindly fuck off?” Draco asked, his face pinched as if in pain.
As much as he seems to be coming back to himself, Harry still finds himself worrying. There are times when Draco doesn’t think he’s being watched, where he looks in such despair he might drown in it. He has nightmares, too. Harry can hear him scream and cry in his sleep from his own room down the hall. He’d learned very quickly to leave him be on those nights, as the one time he tried to offer comfort, Draco had punched him in the face and snarled at him to leave.
“Not if it ends up with you killing yourself.”
He could imagine Potter looking sheepish when faced with the angry matron. Merlin, the woman was frightening. However, before he could try to decipher Potter’s mumbled response, his mother began to fuss with his water glass and jug, causing the ice to clatter against the glass as it sloshed around in the water.
“I think we’re going to need to list the most potent healing ingredients and their reactions when combined with stabilising agents. I think that would be the best way to handle this potion. Your core is unstable, is it not, and in need of healing? There is a glossary of rare ingredients on the middle shelf there, with the red spine. I suggest you begin reading. I will be here if you need to ask any questions.”
being serious! What does it matter to you what he’s up to?”
“Mother, what are you doing?” sighed Draco through gritted teeth. It was amazing how he managed to sound exhausted and furious at the same time.
The man in question was still lying in the middle of the bed, the blanket wrapped securely around his body. Harry tilted his head and wondered how the Malfoy heir would feel if he knew he currently resembled a poorly constructed sausage roll.
“Draco?” whispered Harry cautiously.
“That was you? Why, you little—”
Harry huffed at the gesture, but grabbed the proffered bottle and took a deep pull regardless. As the alcohol burned his throat, he had to admit he did feel a little calmer, which was more than he could say for Malfoy. His pale eyes were bright with emotion as he turned to face them all.
“You’re such an arse, Seamus!” Harry rolled his eyes in fond exasperation.
“So, Draco and I, we’re life-bonded? What does that even mean? I’ve not seen him in years…I don’t get how we can suddenly be bonded.”
"Yeah, you sound it." Neville glared at the oblivious couple. "Look, you two, we need to talk." He waited until they'd disentangled themselves before continuing. "I'm happy you guys are together and whatnot, but if you want me to keep this a secret, then you're going to need to stop dry humping each other all over the place." Draco looked ready to interrupt, but Neville didn't give him the chance. "I'm serious. You're causing me serious psychological pain, and I swear to Merlin, if you don't stop, I'll be sending my therapy bill directly to you both!"
"Or," began Draco, his eyes shining with mischief, "we can mess with them
Just then, the door to the room slammed shut with an ominous thud.
He swung the door open and sucked in a harsh breath as he found himself staring at Draco, his eyes squeezed closed in pleasure, as a slim brown-haired man knelt before him, his head bobbing frantically back and forth.
“I set up a trap so that when he opened his bedroom door, half a dozen duck eggs smashed onto his head.” He grimaced as his friends gasped in shock.
Draco couldn’t help but snuffle a laugh at that, because as great as the old man had been, there was no doubt he was also a few sandwiches short of a picnic.
She shrugged. "I taught him all the mundane spells he knows. I've just learned all their counters as well."
“I haven’t found home yet, but maybe one day—” He let his words trail off, his skin too sensitive with possibilities for him to be able to think.
"Oh. My. Gawd," Neville exclaimed, and he wanted to curse Lavender for rubbing off on him, but he couldn't think of anything else to say. Except…
mate…” His mouth turned downwards with distaste at the concept. “…is Potter.”
“Why, Potter, I didn’t know you cared.” Merlin, even the arse's familiar drawl was getting him hot.
Harry stood awkwardly for a moment as he watched the other man try and choke back his tears and then shrugged. Draco was right. If Harry was going to keep him there, the least he could do was give Draco his personal space.
Draco sat cross-legged at the bottom of the bed with Harry’s foot in his lap. They’d opted to have a lazy Sunday and had asked the house-elves to send them up a breakfast tray. They’d kissed and talked and eaten, and then kissed some more, relaxing in each other’s company. Now, they’d struck an easy bargain — Draco massaged Harry’s feet, which were feeling sore from Harry’s frequent jogs, and Harry read the articles from
As for the physical fitness trainer, I’m sure he would be more than happy to dye his hair whatever colour the Saviour prefers. Otherwise, you could still rekindle your romance with Chang or maybe with Ginevra. The
"Not at all, dearie. In fact, you're welcome to stay the night if you want. I hate being in the flat when Draco works late. It freaks me out."
“Not that being threatened by a guy in a towel isn’t utterly terrifying, Malfoy, but I have no idea what you’re on about.” Draco had no idea when Neville had developed sass, but he was certain it hadn’t been there before.
“You’re joking! That’s fucking priceless!” gasped Weasley, almost as red as his hair from laughing too much. Draco found himself hoping that the gits would all laugh themselves to death. That would teach them!
“How’re you feeling?”
Well, there was the barracuda bet, but Draco wasn't rushing for anything. Not when there were schools of tiny fish darting around the coral and rocks. He fumbled with his gear for a second and pulled free the underwater camera he had brought. He focused on a particularly bright group of Parrot fish, their gleaming scales vibrant shades of pink and orange and blue, and snapped a few shots of them.
A pointed cough reminded him he wasn’t on his own and he turned to face the group, who looked less smug than before. In fact, their expressions ranged from pissed to pitying. However, it was when he saw Ron’s wince that he knew just how badly he’d messed up.
“You do know that’s a Muggle movie, don’t you?” Harry noted blankly as if the prospect of Draco knowing what a movie even was only added to the surrealism of the situation.
His arms were splayed across the bed, the forearms facing upwards. Across the left arm, over the remnants of the faded dark mark, were long bloody welts. It looked as if Draco had scratched his skin raw, and sure enough, the fingernails on his right hand were caked with blood and bits of skin.
“Why bother, Potter?” challenged Draco breathlessly, his eyebrow cocked sexily. “If I wanted to drink, I would have stayed in the club. I was under the impression we came here to fuck.”
Until he didn’t.
“Malfoy, for the love of— Stop the fucking car!”
“You had none whatsoever!” Draco responded as he pushed himself away from the door frame and stalked to the Floo, his graceful movements seemingly unhindered by his blossoming stomach.
“More?” questioned Harry stupidly, feeling like his brain had vacated the premises.
“Draco?”
Blaise was laughing. "Oh Merlin, did that really just happen?"
“What about earlier? You told them about
Draco mused.
we do it. Let’s just try again, and this time, maybe we could make it less of a hate fuck and more of a…I don’t know…new beginning?”
So, I know you’ve been home for a few days. I also know that you’re sitting in your stupid tiny flat, refusing to go outside. How do I know this? Because, as we already established in my last letter, you’re a coward. You think if you go outside, something terrible will happen. People will form some kind of anti-Malfoy mob and drag you off for public retribution, perhaps?
He had no idea what McGonagall had been thinking, segregating the eighth years like this. It was like they were being stripped of the only identities they’d ever known at Hogwarts. House-unity was all very well, but there were too few of them and enough emotional baggage to fuel a soap opera. He wasn’t stupid enough to think he had the worst lot, though, the majority of the eighth years were Gryffindors, after all. He could only imagine how the others felt. How Malfoy felt. Not that the git didn’t deserve every bit of misery that was slung his way, but the thought made Harry all the more grateful he had his friends nearby if he should need them.
“Sweet Circe, what did you do?” breathed Harry, horrified at what Draco had done.
Potter and his friends are suddenly everywhere he turns, making a point of saying hello every time they cross paths, no matter how many times a day. It's having a roll-on effect too, with the other eighth years no longer glaring at him and a complete lack of open hostility. Longbottom even invited him to hang out with the Gryffindors the other day. Draco’s shock and inbred manners had battled before he finally managed to choke out a painful, “no, thank you.”
Draco found himself groaning almost obscenely as he took a generous sip, before wrapping his long fingers around the mug, trying to leech some of the warmth. Harry seemed to notice, as a Warming Charm flared to life around him without warning, chasing away the chills left in his bones from sitting on the cold bathroom tiles. The irony that Harry was the one warming him up instead of the other way around made him snort a quick laugh. Draco felt the sofa cushions shift as Harry sat beside him, curling his legs underneath himself as he sipped his drink. They looked at each other, both aware of the Erumpent in the room and neither willing to be the first to mention it.
Neville stared at Draco, barely hearing Hermione's questions about the conference, and the full meaning of his realisation set in. His jaw dropped, and he struggled for words. Draco must have noticed something, though, because his eyes widened and he jumped up, dragging Neville after him back towards Harry's bedroom.
Harry quickly cast wandless Locking and Silencing Spells at the door before he turned and pressed Draco back onto the bed, his tanned body settling on top of Draco’s pale frame.
“Partners, Malfoy? You know, working together, study-buddies, mutual prisoners of impending doom.”
“Harry. I’m just Harry. Erm, I don’t suppose you’d introduce me to your friends?” Potter looks nervous yet hopeful as he gestures to the ducklings.
Dear Harry,
However, before Harry could rally his inner Ravenclaw and knuckle down, a flash of platinum hair in his peripheral vision caught his attention. Malfoy. Skulking as per usual. He found his eyes narrowing in suspicion as Malfoy made his way into the Care of Magical Creatures section, only to emerge a few seconds later and begin to argue with Madam Pince. Harry could feel the annoyance surge in his blood at the sight. How dare he go around harassing old women! True, the ancient librarian could more than handle herself, but that wasn’t the point. As if Malfoy hadn’t caused enough trouble already! After a moment or two, Malfoy had clearly had enough and turned his back on Madam Pince and stalked towards the entrance.
Hermione made a little noise at that, but raised her chin and met his eyes, fluttering her lashes slowly. "I'm not sure exactly," she said in a low voice. "I just woke up one morning and realised that I was seeing you in an entirely different light. I think perhaps I'd been dreaming about your scraggly hair and strong arms." She ran her finger up his bicep. "I suppose I just found myself powerless to your magic charms."
Sudden footfall on the stairs alerted them that the teenagers had finally emerged from their rooms, slicing through the tentative calm and ratcheting the tension back up to unbearable. Seconds later, James and Teddy stepped warily into the kitchen. Harry steeled himself and gently beckoned them towards the table.
“Dunno, mate. Maybe ask ‘Mione?”
Draco,
“Trust me, I’ve learned never to question that room,” advised Harry, sharing a knowing smirk with Draco.
“Maybe it’s his new hobby and she didn’t have the book he wanted?”
Draco stood in his tight black boxers as Potter’s eyes roamed over his hairless body, taking in his slim lines of lean muscle that he’d worked so hard to maintain.
“Oi, don’t even think about it,” grinned Harry, wiggling his foot in Draco’s lap. “Keep going!” Draco returned the grin and resumed pressing his thumbs along the arch, feeling smug whenever Harry hummed in pleasure. “Okay, ‘
“I suppose we could talk? First, I mean. Before…”
“Forget it.”
“Of course there could be new ghosts. Not everyone who died at the Battle would have wanted to go on, you know,” informed Luna. “Perhaps that’s why Draco came here in the first place.”
Somewhat perplexed, Draco watched Hagrid stomp away out of sight and waited. The ducklings were getting louder and louder, seemingly fixated on getting to him by any means. He could feel the panic begin to spread from his chest and out over his entire body, his skin prickling with it as if being poked by hundreds of tiny, but shockingly sharp, needles. He found himself beginning to whisper “come on, Hagrid, come on,” over and over again, although whether this was out of concern for himself or the ducklings, he couldn’t say. Before long — although Draco would swear it was hours, days even — Hagrid crouched back down beside him, holding a rather large cardboard box.
didn't even realise you liked men."
Which brings me to the main point of this letter, actually. Yes, I’m pissed with you! Of course, I bloody am! But how
Harry was halfway through the door before he paused, not wanting to leave the situation tense. “Anyway, suppose I’ll see you in the morning, Malfoy.”
It irked him no end to see Potter looking particularly hot, and not in terms of degrees. Life as an Auror had obviously agreed with him, filling out his previously skinny frame with muscle. The biceps on the man were unreal, and as he let his eyes follow the path of the beads of sweat rolling down the tanned skin, he thought he caught a glimpse of ink on Potter’s forearm. Draco found himself leaning forwards as he took in the enticing sight.
Everywhere he looked, the absence of Harry screamed at him. He staggered back into the bedroom and sank heavily onto Harry’s side of the bed, feeling as if a black pit of despair was consuming him from the inside out. He lay back and rolled onto his side, burying his face into Harry’s pillow, breathing in the light remains of his scent. He knew it would fade soon, just as everything else they had shared would fade. His whole body shook violently as he began to sob, his lungs struggling to draw breath as he gasped around the pain. He’d set Harry free and Harry had left, just as Draco had known he would.
"Sounds good to me," he replied, giving up on his impersonation and going over to inspect the pile of DVDs next to the TV. "I'll pick the movie, you sort the popcorn."
“No, I can’t!” The unfairness of the whole thing was threatening to overwhelm him. He sunk his teeth into his bottom lip until the coppery taste of blood began to tingle along his tongue. “Potter! Of all the impossible, self-righteous, puffed-up twits in the world, I get fucking Potter!” He could feel his eyes begin to smart again, and he wished, not for the first time, that he had managed to die in the Room of Requirement after all. If only Potter hadn’t flown back to save him. “After everything that’s happened, that’s who I get for my core twin!”
Finally unable to ignore his bladder any longer, Harry stretched his arms out over the bed, freezing when his arm brushed something on the pillows. He opened his eyes and reached out to find a piece of parchment lying on the opposite pillow, the neat writing completely unfamiliar.
“Now, as I was saying before you decided to have an attack of the hysterics, when Mr Potter has been informed of the situation, we will ask him if he will consent to the bonding. As I, being Headmistress, am legally able to perform bonding ceremonies, I will preside over the discussion and, Merlin willing, the eventual ceremony. In the meantime, Madame Pomfrey will monitor your condition. You will be excused from all classes and assignments until such a time that you are given a clean bill of health. Your mother has requested, and been granted, permission to stay with you through this difficult time.”
“If you keep agreeing with Gran—” Draco broke off as Pansy glared at him and quickly corrected himself. “If you keep agreeing with Hermione, I’m going to have to send you the bill for my therapy.”
However, before he could lift his quill, the library doors burst open, and Malfoy strode in, his pale face looking frantic as looked around. Before Harry had the chance to think about hiding, Malfoy clocked him and did an odd half-run, half-tiptoe move over to his table.
He lifted the quilt and slid down underneath until his face was level with Harry’s morning erection. He breathed in the musty smell of sleep as he nuzzled his nose into Harry’s groin, pleased when he received a low moan in response. As Harry’s hand fisted his hair, he knew that it was going to be a very pleasurable morning indeed.
Draco
Blaise shrugged. “I’ll get some Skiving Snackboxes from Ginny.”
I wish I could be with you right now.
“You waited.” Lately, Blaise had been too busy hanging around with Ginny bloody Weasley to spare much time for his actual friends. Draco had been meaning to confront him over it, but with his Potions project almost complete, he found he was often otherwise occupied too.
Draco creaked open his eyes wearily and made a grab for the bedside clock. He suppressed a yawn and held the clock in front of his face, trying his best to make out the time through bleary eyes. As soon as he was able to focus, he gasped, threw the clock onto the bottom on the bed, and leapt from the bed in a mad dash, cursing all the while. He had no time for his usual routine — not even time for coffee! He forced his legs into the first pair of trousers he came across and padded into the living room as he fought his way into a t-shirt and jumper.
*****
Perhaps it wouldn’t be that bad, he thought as he stared in the mirror, smoothing down imaginary creases in an attempt at normality. He could stay with Pansy, Blaise, Greg, Millie, and whoever decided to show up from his old house. With any luck, he might be able to get through the night without having to speak more than ten words to non-Slytherins, and when he thought about it like that, he almost believed that the reunion might not be so horrible.
“It’s important you both know you’re not in trouble. You're both of legal age and should be able to explore that side of your relationship, but we do need to set down some rules and discuss the situation properly.”
“I am
who was saying he couldn't wait until that night to put his tongue inside Draco's— Merlin! Harry...and Draco. Draco was fucking Harry. Her best friend, with whom she shared everything, hadn't bothered to tell her he was fucking another one of their closest friends!
“You’re kidding?”
“Mr Potter informs me that you’ve had somewhat of a miraculous breakthrough. Well done, Mr Malfoy.” Even through the fog of his feelings, Draco could register the Headmistress’ rare praise hidden within the brief statement. However, before he could thank her, she continued on brusquely. “He also informs me that you both wish to dissolve the bonding? This is easily done, however there are possible side effects, dangers of core collapse and depression being the two most common. Do you still wish to proceed?”
“I don’t care, Harry! I couldn’t give a monkey’s fur what he’s up to, if anything, and neither should you! Oh, honestly!” She threw her hands up in frustration and pulled her parchment closer. “Fine. Whatever. Ron,
“Well, what did the Ferret have to say for himself?”
You’re such a sore loser! How could you accuse me of using a
I’m going to put it back together, Harry. I’m going to spend every single day of my life telling you that I love you, convincing you that you’re everything I want, making you believe me when I say that there’s no one else in the whole world I’d rather be with – even if we’re both drama queens, let’s face it.
Two days after Harry received Malfoy’s letter, he still hadn’t decided what to do. Ron had suggested that he get another seahorse to see if the company would perk Treacle up a bit, but Hermione had told him to hush. She was brimming with the kind of fervour he only saw in her when she got going about S.P.E.W, but instead of getting on his nerves, it actually made him feel a little better.
They had spent the first few days of the holiday taking lesson after lesson in the basics of diving so that they would be allowed to explore the caves in the reef below. The thought made Harry tingle with anticipation, the thought of gliding through the azure water, stroking the row of coral and swimming with the fish. Draco may have been desperate for a break, but he hadn't realised how stressed he himself had been. How disconnected he and Draco had become, merely passing ships in the night. He wanted more time to relax with Draco by his side, and be darned if he wasn't going to make sure he had it.
He walked to the dresser and opened drawer after drawer, knowing that all the ones that had held Harry’s clothes would be empty, but unable to resist poking the wound. He went into the bathroom and saw Harry’s toothbrush was gone along with the ironic comb that Harry used to keep next to the mirror. Not once had Draco ever seen him use it! He pulled the door to the shower open and was unsurprised to find the citrus scented soap Harry favoured was gone, his bottle of shampoo looking lonely on the tiles.
The shared moment seemed to dissolve, causing both of them to lower their eyes, each unwilling to be the one to take the initiative.
You love me, you say? You love me so much you can’t eat and think about me all the bloody time? Well, you’ve got a fucking hilarious way of showing it! The moment you had a chance to be with me, you fucked off! You left me lying there sleeping! You didn’t even have the decency to wake me up and explain things to me. No, you just let me wake up and wonder where you’d gone and what I’d done wrong.
“All right, Mother,” soothed Draco as he grasped her hand tightly, unnerved by the grey pallor of his mother’s face and the shadows that had now taken residence under her watery eyes. “Let’s explore the options.”
ok? You look a bit queasy. You should lie down and I can get you some soup from the kitchens. I’ll even feed it to you if you like.”
“Harry!” Hermione had her library scolding voice on, obviously unimpressed as Harry began to push up from his chair, his sights firmly set on Malfoy. “Where’re you going? You’ve still got extension charms to revise!”
Where the ravens of his own tattoo ended at the edge of his arm, Harry’s began. The exact same ravens. A few lone birds flew towards the larger flock a few inches across Harry’s skin.
Healer Greyson paused until Draco nodded that he should continue, obviously picking up on the undercurrent of emotion passing between mother and son.
“Malfoy! For fuck’s sake!”
“Why do you want to help me? Is it just because of the baby?”
“Wait, where are you going?” Called Narcissa, her voice suddenly shrill and strained. “You’ve not eaten all day.”
“Harry!”
“I know you will, Harry.”
He looked down at their joined hands, his mother’s knuckles almost white with strain, and he found himself looking at her lovely face as silent tears rolled down her pale cheeks. Merlin, they were all damned, and likely not to a place as nice as hell.
“Stay. Stay with me.”
“What the fuck would you know about it? Just get me one.”
“You’re certifiably insane, do you know that?” scoffed Draco, looking torn.
“Well, I
“Hey! What the hell’s your problem, dickhead?”
He’d shifted onto his side, pausing as Harry snuffled briefly next to him, as he wondered if Harry and the girl Weasley would get back together again. Blaise would be crushed. He’d been hanging around the ginger annoyance like a tenacious fly and still hadn’t shagged her yet. The thought of Blaise being as miserable as himself gave Draco a shameful feeling of comfort. At least he wouldn’t be alone. Maybe he and Blaise could start a broken hearts’ club. They could get t-shirts made especially. The thought, instead of cheering him, only added to the growing heaviness he constantly carried around inside him.
Looking forward to seeing you,
“Well, what did you name yours then?”
"Of course. And it's lucky our good friend Nev is here to help explain what's happened." Draco fixed Neville with his trademark Malfoy stare, causing the other man to look extremely nervous. "Why don't you be a treasure and explain to Harry just how Hermione seemed to find out about us."
“You’ve heard me sing?” Draco watches Harry cautiously nod his head, his throat suddenly dry. “It was something my mother used to sing to me. Pennies From Heaven. It’s a Muggle song, if you can believe that. My father made her stop.”
Over the next week, Draco tried two other combinations in Severus’ rooms, both of which resulted in disaster, and he was getting desperate. He spent his days trying to ignore the stabbing spikes in his chest, which the Pain-Relief Potions barely touched upon. He knew he could take a stronger dose, but it would make him drowsy and inconsistent at times — something he couldn’t afford if he was going to find a cure in time. The tremors in his hands had grown to the point that his handwriting was becoming illegible. At mealtimes, he opted to eat solid finger foods, no longer trusting his dexterity with cutlery. He was paler too; his skin was beginning to take on a muted grey tinge, made worse by the thin layer of sweat upon his brow and upper lip.
Pansy’s voice seemed unusually shrill as it cut through his thoughts.
Harry sat for a long moment, watching Narcissa take deep breaths through her nose in an apparent attempt to calm herself.
“Come on, Harry,” agreed Hermione, “you’re always going on about him whenever you can. And I bet you think about him loads more than that.”
“Sorry m-mate…just wanted…to check t-things…were good,” gasped Ron, leaning against Harry for support.
Draco looked at the instructor and had to admit that the man looked green about the gills, but who cared? He had done it, and decidedly better than Potter had. That was a win in his book.
An hour later, they’d dissected every bit of useful information from the article. Draco had set up his cauldron with the almost completed potion bubbling over a low flame, and was now debating on which particular essence of Harry’s to include. Draco felt this was a process he would be more comfortable tackling on his own, but there was no doubt he needed Severus’ expertise.
— a highly prestigious Potion’s journal for him. Something alien began to flutter inside his chest at the collection of items and Draco knew with absolute certainty it wasn’t his core.
“I was just telling it like it is. It’s not my fault he can’t take the truth.”
"I—I need the bathroom!" he declared, his voice overly loud and shaky.
Draco rolled his eyes and forced himself over to the door, pulling it open tiredly.
“For the love of Merlin, Potter—”
“Can…Should I sit with you, or—” Merlin, Draco hated feeling so unsure of everything. What was worse, he was as good at hiding it as Weasley was at hiding his ginger heritage! It would have been intolerable if Harry wasn’t obviously feeling exactly the same.
“Before you all start getting into another stupid argument, could you just not?” asked Draco, his quiet voice somehow carrying easily through the chatter. “Yes, we’re stuck. No, we don’t know why. And as much as I love to blame Potter for stuff, it likely wasn’t the sinister plan of anyone here. So, if it’s not too much trouble, could we all just focus on the problem at hand? I’d rather get out of here before Christmas, thank you very much.”
Theo nodded next to Blaise, opting for silent support.
"Neville," Hermione asked, finally regaining her wits, "why aren't you surprised that we just caught Harry and Draco...doing...stuff."
“What are you suggesting? We do like a pet-share thing? ‘Cause I’m not sure I can be away from her for too long.” Harry was trying to work with Malfoy to find common ground, he really was, but the thought of handing her over to Malfoy for days at a time made him sick to his stomach.
"Because I'm in love with Draco!"
“You’ll need to make them a nest and you’ll need to feed them too. Just line this here box with something soft and they'll be okay for now. They’ll have been okay ‘til now ‘cause they live off the yolk at firs’, but now they’ll be hungry.” Hagrid paused in his instruction to pull a well-thumbed book out of the box and passed it to Draco with a smile. “This here will tell you what you need to know, feedin’ them and the like. Wet dog food with greens is bes’, I think. You’ll need to make sure they have fresh drinkin’ water. A tub for them to take a swim in now an’ then would be good too. There’s some of Fang’s dog food in the box an’ some spinach from my garden to get yeh started.”
Harry moved closer and sat gently on the bed beside Draco. He felt the mattress dip with his weight, but Draco gave no sign that he noticed or cared.
Blaise grinned and only stretched out further, crossing one leg over the other. "My desk too, Granger, and I like my feet up there."
"Oh, yes. Now I find myself thinking of you whenever I so much as touch my wand." Draco was never going to let him live this down. How the hell had he gotten into this?
“What, you need permission?” Draco quipped, still feeling like he was missing something.
Draco smiled affectionately. "I love you too, you great big lummox."
“How the fuck do you know all that?” queried Draco suspiciously.
“Maybe he’s chatting up the giant squid. New crush and all that.”
“You need to stop thinking of your sickness as a taint, which would necessitate the use of an antidote. Nor is your sickness a curse, which would rule out the use of the many cures littering your list. It
“I already lost your father, Draco; I can’t lose you too.”
under a Love Potion, you dolt. Is that the only way you think someone would ever want you?”
Just as he was about to react to the distasteful mallard, the door clattered open and Neville came bustling inside, carrying a heavy-looking woody plant in a large red pot. Draco stood there, watching Neville settle the plant next to his bed, and waited until finally he couldn’t take it anymore.
Please, don’t burn it.
“Draco, I’m just going to have a look, okay?” asked Harry gently as he reached for Draco’s wounded arm.
“Who do you belong to, then?” Enquired Harry as he began to untie the letter. As soon as he had the letter free, he offered the owl a treat, which it turned away from and hooted disdainfully.
“You have the count of three, Potter, before I hex your arse out of this pen!”
Draco had no idea how long he’d been sitting on the floor. His legs were prickly with pins and needles, and his arse was numb with cold. Harry seemed to have taken the hint that he needed some space. He’d been sure Harry would have pounded his way in by now, demanding they get on with it and finish the job in true Gryffindor fashion. The self-sacrificing idiot!
“It’s just after 10 am. I let you sleep a bit, but we really need to get things going. There’s loads to do today.”
“I tried to make up for it. I got people to back off and I stopped the pranks.”
’. Sure enough, he’d only been gone about five minutes when he reappeared in the doorway, out of breath and holding a large flask and two mugs. Draco raised his eyebrows questioningly, at which Harry merely smiled, closed the door securely behind him, and poured them both a steaming mug of hot chocolate.
Harry felt a static at his fingertips. Something wasn’t right with Malfoy, that much was clear. He looked at his friends, and he knew if he said anything they would give him the ‘you’re obsessed with Malfoy’ talk again. Just the thought made Harry shiver.
And yet, here they were. Personally, he blamed Granger. He bet her know-it-all eyes lit up when she received the invitation, and the other two had no choice but to go along with her mania. The thing was, he knew she wasn’t stupid. Granger had bested him in every subject in his Hogwarts career. She had to know that he’d be there, that people would expect it as part of his neverending atonement, so to show up practically dragging Potter by the scruff of the neck was so cruel it had to be nothing short of a personal vendetta.
"Oh, really?" Harry hesitated, his interest piqued. "And how, may I ask, will you do that?"
“Draco, I—”
“He was in the Care of Magical Creatures section! He doesn’t even take that subject!”
“I think it would be best if everyone, and I mean everyone, left. Draco and I have things to discuss.”
“You—” Draco feels his eyes bulge and he knows he’s about a second away from throttling Potter with his bare hands.
"Is that so?" Hermione asked, breathless, leaning towards him a little.
What would he wish for? The right to choose. It wasn’t all bad being with Harry, but it wasn’t what he would have chosen for himself. Surely, they both had that right? He felt beholden to his own magic and the resentment of having to rely on Harry to live burned so strong sometimes it was all he could see. Classes were due to start back in a few days, and Draco could feel his resolve set upon discovering a cure as soon as he possibly could. He couldn’t stand being as good as a hostage any more.
“You wouldn’t…” gasped Seamus, clutching his Firewhisky tightly to his chest.
“Absolutely,” affirmed Draco firmly. “I think it’s essential we talk about protection—”
asking him out." Hermione laid her hand on Harry's and trailed her finger over his hand for some reason. Her voice was saccharine, and hearing her simper was just plain wrong as far as Draco was concerned. She'd been fawning over Harry all night, and Draco was about two minutes away from checking her for a badly cast Imperio.
Harry’s hands pushed Draco’s boxers down, freeing his leaking cock to press a wet trail between their stomachs. Their kisses grew more frantic still, teeth pulling at lips and tongues tasting every inch of each other’s mouths. Hands pulled them closer together as they snapped their hips in rhythm with one another, their cocks pressing and grinding, precome slicking the way to make each thrust glide more easily.
“Scarlet creature? Where do you think you are, in a warped version of a Nathanial Hawthorne novel?” demanded Harry, his patience with Malfoy’s antics vanishing on the spot.
“Yeah, alright. I’ll sit and behave.” Harry couldn’t help the fond smile that crept across his face at his husband’s familiar snark.
"You look so good, 'Mione. You're getting me so hot. Why don't we move this into the bedroom?"
“He’s my house-elf. I’ve told him the situation and to take orders from you as long as they don’t contradict any orders I’ve already given him.”
“I assure you that I don’t have a problem. I simply have far too much to do without having to supervise my pet in its fraternisation with the common riff-raff.”
Hermione's mind was too busy trying to decipher all it'd witnessed to notice the man approaching until he was upon them. "Hey, guys," Neville asked, his voice questioning. "What's going on?"
“Big and hot? What are you, five?”
Having successfully talked herself into it, she broke the seal and unrolled the parchment.
His godfather was silent for several moments before responding. His brow was furrowed, something that had tended to happen in life when he’d been greatly worried.
“Of course,” growled Draco, revelling in the feeling  of Harry grinding their cocks together. “Of course the bloody Saviour can do wandless bloody magic.”
But I digress.
“I don’t know why, but I need to do this. I
“Breathe, ‘Mione! Ron, I don’t think she can breathe.”
Suddenly, Draco had an idea and closed his eyes to help block out the shrieks, doing his best to take long, deep breaths — he was never going to manage to calm eight ducklings if he himself wasn’t calm first. After a minute or so, he felt slightly more grounded and began to sing, making sure to keep his voice low and gentle.
After a few moments of scratching away at his parchment, Draco lifted his head and focused his gaze on his godfather.
Harry looked at Draco's playful grin and shook his head in mock despair. God, how he loved the idiotic man!
“Not if I stabilise it, it won’t be. Powdered willow bark could manage that. It’s flexible but durable, positive but not overwhelmingly so.” Quickly, he snatched up his quill and added his thoughts to the list. “I need something to counteract the side effects of distance from Harry’s magical core…maybe Ashwinder eggs? They would sort the ague symptoms…”
“Please, Severus. I wouldn’t ask if I had another viable alternative.”
badges, Draco clinging to Potter’s waist as they soared through the air, Fiendfyre at their heels.
“Fuck, you’re right. I swear, I’m going to miraculously come down with some tropical disease the day before.”
“I’m sorry! I swear, the second it happened I felt like utter shite.”
After a few moments of struggle, Harry managed to lift Treacle from the tank despite her fighting and distress, trying to hold her and soothe her at the same time. “Yes, I know you want to stay, but I’ll see what I can do tomorrow when Malfoy is more reasonable.”
“Very true.” agreed Draco, his eyes glinting with mirth as he sipped his coffee.
He must be, it’s the only explanation for how often he finds himself thinking of Potter. Of how confident he carries himself when in class, only to try and blend into the background when in a crowd. How his glasses magnify his green eyes, making them seem all the brighter. How he quietly cares for those he loves without need of acknowledgement — ordering extra ink and quills for Granger and making sure the plates with Weasley’s favourites are nearest to him during meal times. He notices that Potter has grown a little taller in the last month, his shoulders filling out his robes when before they were small and thin. Sometimes when he’s working in the library, he thinks of taking Potter’s hand and looking him in the eye as they stand together and tell the world to fuck off.
He kicked the door shut and cast a quick
It was too much.
He made me use smuggled unicorn and erumpent horns in the potions I prepared for him. One of our clients found out, and Orion is going to blame me for it. He’s going to say that it was all my idea. He said the Aurors will never believe a Death Eater like me. That they’re just going to shove me in a cell and throw away the key. They won’t even bother to use
when forced. Thankfully, he was standing behind Pansy, and she seemed more than happy to take the brunt of interacting with the populace. After a while, the whole thing seemed to bleed together, the minutes losing their structure and each face morphing almost seamlessly into the next. The night felt never-ending.
“Come on, old man. We care about you.”
“What the hell are you on about, Potter? Fuck off!”
"Yeah, so if you don't mind, could you keep it a secret a while longer?" asked Draco hopefully.
The few agonising seconds it took for Harry to notice the abrupt change seemed endless, and Draco barely managed to hold back grateful sobs when Harry suddenly backed off of him. Confused worry filled Harry’s lust-blown eyes as Draco began to scramble off the bed, and all at once, he knew he had to get away. He spun on his heel and ran to the bathroom, slamming the door behind him.
Harry's voice was firm. "Sorry, but it's true," He looked relieved to get it all out once and for all. "I love Draco. I love him."
He had no idea how long had passed since they began to kiss, but Draco knew he wouldn’t last much longer. The heat and pressure, the push and pull of the whole thing was too much, almost overwhelming, and he felt sure that he would combust any second. It seemed Harry was feeling something similar, as with a final few thrusts, both men reached their orgasm, spilling messily onto each other’s body. They continued to rock their bodies together as they rode the final waves of their high, clutching and kissing as they groaned their way back down to earth.
“Yeah? Like what?” Harry asked suspiciously.
“No, Mother! Just don’t, okay! Healer Greyson — patient confidentiality. I don’t want any word of this leaking anywhere.” The sombre Healer nodded his understanding and quickly left the room, leaving Draco and his mother alone for the first time in hours.
“Damned right,” agreed Blaise. “Especially not after the whole Sixth-Year debacle.”
"Do we have any kind of salve around here? I've got some kind of nasty rash all over my arse."
“Why not? What aren’t you telling me, Draco?”
“Maybe you are, but you’re a disease that I don’t mind succumbing to.”
“I swear to Morgana, if you mention the fucking baby one more time, I’m going to throw myself out of that bloody window.”
“How do you know it will even work?”
Harry pulled his bag onto the table and began rooting around, finally pulling out his map and activating it with a quick tap of his wand.
“You know what, I’ve got better things to do than put up with this shite.”
“Harry was looking for Draco.”
“I’m sorry. I thought— I don’t know what I thought, exactly. That you were up to something, maybe? But I watched you, and you weren’t, and I thought I could have some fun with it. But then I saw you cry after the egg trap—”
“I swear, I won’t give you my notes!” she threatened, eyeing his folding with distaste.
“So, if this is true, how do we figure out if it’s platonic or not?”
“Now, see here. I appreciate that you’re all meaning well, but can everyone just bugger off? Some of us have stuff to do.”
delicate, and I require your assurance that this will go no further if you choose not to be involved.”
“Sorry, didn’t see you there, Professor,” muttered Harry sheepishly.
Pansy brushed a quick kiss against his cheek, left some money to cover the tea bill, and swooped out of the cafe before Draco could so much as blink. She waited until he'd turned back to his tea, then she slipped back into the cafe and stopped the waitress.
“Why?” breathed Draco, tightening his hold the more Harry tried to push free. “Scared? Worried you won’t be able to get it up?” He darted his tongue out and flicked it across Harry’s mouth. The contact, wet and over too quickly to think about, caused Harry to gasp and Draco, relishing the sound, couldn't help but push Harry further. “Or are you worried you’ll like it too much?”
"So you keep telling me!" chuckled Harry, feeling very pleased with himself. In just a couple of short days, they would be on their way to paradise.
He couldn’t blame her. If he had to handle Weasley’s stupidity day in and day out, he’d be bloody tired too.
“Because I love you.” breathed Harry, sliding his hands up to cup Draco’s face. “I’ve tried so hard not to, and Merlin knows you don’t make it easy, but I can’t help it.”
“Can I just—”
I don’t deserve you after what I’ve done. You have a bloody huge heart and somehow you have forgiven me for my past mistakes, even when I couldn’t forgive myself. But you can’t possibly forgive me this time. Besides, I don’t deserve it.
It took every bit of emotional strength he had to suppress the eye roll that was itching to make itself known. Merlin, Malfoy was an arse. He forced himself to take a calming breath and write back what he hoped was a winning response.
He sloped through the door, kicked off his shoes, and went straight over to greet Treacle, even though she gave no indication that she knew he was there. Her beautiful scales were beginning to lose their shine and she was much thinner than usual. Merlin, he was terrified for her.
“Erm, you draw the line at fluffy stuffed duck toys in primary colours?” Neville was obviously trying not to laugh right in Draco’s face, and that more than anything else seemed to make Draco all the more furious. He tightened his grip on the duck and stepped closer to Neville, fury practically radiating out of his entire body.
Just because you’re an insensitive prat who runs at the first hint of difficulty doesn’t mean I love you any less.  Of course, I was going to help you! Idiot.
Deciding that he wouldn’t be able to stomach anything after all, he got to his feet and lifted his bag onto his shoulder, pausing for Greg to catch up. Greg always waited for him, and a Malfoy never forgot loyalty. Merlin, he wished Greg would hurry up though; the walls were beginning to close in, and he was desperate for fresh air.
could get pregnant, and
Harry ignored her, keeping his eyes trained on the origami bird he was folding.
“No dear, but this water doesn’t look fresh. How are you going to manage to stay hydrated if the water is less than adequate?”
Harry was surprised at how easy it was to sneak out of the hall without being stopped. Mostly, he stuck to the edge of the crowd and kept his eyes on his feet, and before he knew it, he was sprinting up the main staircase towards the seventh floor. It was a long shot—it was hardly a place that was filled with pleasant memories for Malfoy after all—but something inside him was urging him along to the Room of Requirement with absolute certainty.
“It’s alright for you guys. Everyone you know that died was honoured. Remembered. They all got funerals and plaques and Orders of bloody Merlin. What did Vince get? Nothing. Not a bloody mention. There wasn’t even a body for us to bury so we could say goodbye.”
“No! Stop it!” hissed Draco anxiously as he watched one or two of them begin to bump off the shield repeatedly, as if hoping brute force would do the trick. “They’re going to hurt themselves! Hagrid, can’t you do something?”
“Like before,” parroted Harry, his voice flat. “And how do we do that?”
“Such sexy talk, Potter.”
“Do you mind, Potter? Some of us are trying to get off here.”
“Is your mother aware of this? Or the Headmistress?”
Draco strained to get closer to Harry, searching for more friction. Harry sucked and bit at his collarbone, and Draco found himself gasping for more. He dug his fingernails into Harry’s back and dragged them up and down, scoring the flesh, causing Harry to growl hungrily into his mouth. Draco wanted to get at him. He wanted to hurt him and mark him and — Merlin, help him — he wanted Harry to do the same to him. He wanted their consummation to scorch him from the inside out, cauterising the wounds that still seeped from the war, and his father, and all that life had thrown at him.
Draco dropped his head. Well, at least now Ron knew.
"I can't go to work; I've just suffered a trauma having read that litany of sexual deviancy. Obviously, I'm calling in sick. Now, sit and spill."
“Ok, I suppose the best way is to think about the situation logically,” agreed Granger. “Malfoy, what exactly were you thinking about when you activated the room? That might give us an idea of what we’re dealing with.”
This weekend, however, Harry had been off shagging some girl in a posh hotel in Edinburgh, so Neville had to put up with Lavender Brown as a partner. She wouldn't be so bad if her voice wasn't so ridiculously annoying. If he had to hear her whine one more time, he might have to hit himself with a Killing Curse. Because, Oh. My. Gawd.
“Not if I can help it,” Harry heard Malfoy mumble as he was pushed the rest of the way through the door and it slammed closed behind him.
A quick glance around the room showed Harry to still be in the bathroom getting the oil. She looked around, trying to decide where to position herself to give Harry the most shock. Finally, she settled on lounging back on the couch, her arms propping her up and her legs crossed, sure to draw his attention. It reminded her of that one Sharon Stone movie she'd seen and made her blush. It wasn't the most comfortable of strategic positions, but she knew it would give him a perfect view of her revised outfit, and most of all, it'd be effective.
“This is just another trick.” Draco refuses to look at Potter, shaking his head vigorously as if trying to rid himself of bothersome flies.
“How?” It wasn’t the most eloquent Draco had ever been in his life, but considering the bizarre events of the evening, he felt he was doing rather well in the vocal department.
Finally satisfied that Draco would be comfortable enough for the night, he filled a glass of water from the adjoining bathroom and placed it on the bedside table. As an afterthought, he conjured a small bucket and placed it on the floor next to the bed, just in case Draco was sick during the night. Lastly, he set a monitoring charm to let him know when Draco finally woke up and left the room, taking care to lock it securely behind him.
“I can explain.” Potter pushes himself to his feet and stands facing Draco, his hands held in front of him in a placating gesture.
"Here it comes," she advised, trying to buy time. "Be gentle with me, Harry."
“Absolutely.” agreed Draco. “Now, I have a book which should explain what you both need to know. I propose we all go over it together right now, that way we can answer any questions you both may have.”
As if summoned by the flash, Harry appeared at his side, gesturing for him to hurry up. He shook his head and pointed to the camera and the fish, clearly indicating that he wanted more pictures first. Harry, seeing that Draco wouldn't move on until he was ready, shrugged and then swam over to another school of beautifully striped Cardinalfish, their pointed and spiked tails swishing around as if without a care in the word. Draco managed to suppress a delighted grin as he watched Harry assume a thumbs-up pose amidst the fish, and snapped away.
“What now?” Malfoy parroted incredulously. “Your bloody pet has defiled mine, that’s what!”
“As Master wishes, I’m sure he is knowing best,” grumbled Kreacher, causing Harry to sigh. It had been years since the Dursleys had starved him, but he still hadn’t gotten into the habit of always eating breakfast. Sure, if there were others about, then it was different, but cooking and eating breakfast just by himself seemed like a waste.
“I can’t— I need to sit.” Draco pushed himself away from Harry and slumped to his knees, leaning against the partition wall. A split second later, Harry was sprawled alongside him, their shoulders pressed together as they both fought to catch their breath. Although Harry cast a quick cleaning charm, neither man thought to cover themselves, opting to leave their clothes lying on the floor, their boxers half off and straining around their lower thighs as they rested.

"Don't look at me; I never told them!"
“Now, for your pairs. In the spirit of inter-house unity, I have taken the liberty of randomising the pairings.” Miss Bumble ran through her list, the students moving to join their partners as she read. Draco couldn’t help but snort at the expression on Granger’s face as she was paired with Longbottom. He only hoped she had her affairs in order. He felt sorry for Greg who was paired with the Weasel, although, with any luck, Greg would end up thumping the ginger twat. Draco was so focused on passing judgement on the other pairings, he completely missed his own name being read out, only jumping to attention when Potter sat down next to him with an angry thump.
You can’t just write a letter like that and expect things to be suddenly fixed. That’s not how things work. And you just sent the thing off thinking… what exactly? What was it you expected me to do? Nothing?
"Wow, I can't believe we're finally going to have our first kiss," she stated breathlessly. She hoped to all the gods in the heavens that she sounded sexy and not terrified. Or disgusted. Because honestly, this was like kissing her brother.
“Not following you,” Hermione gasped, finally returning to her usual colour. “Following
“I must admit, I am a bit.” She smiled at him as she once again sat in her chair, and he breathed a sigh of relief, laying back down.
He remembered what she had said when he had first shown her the letter. He had expected her to look regretful but ultimately tell him to let it go. Instead, he’d sat at the breakfast table shocked as she ranted and raved, slamming cups and plates about as she got herself more and more worked up.
“Oh no, not this again,” sighed Pansy, looking over at Theo, who was giving her a strange, I-told-you-so look.
"Shall I put on some music?" he blurted out suddenly, desperately trying to control the furious blush that was surely spreading across his entire body. Fuck. He was never going to be able to look Hermione in the eye after this.
Then, after several minutes, Draco moved forwards and straddled Harry’s lap, one knee on each side of his thighs. Harry held his breath and waited, unable to move even if he wanted to as Draco began to lower himself until he was seated fully upon Harry’s lap, his blossoming bump brushing against Harry’s stomach. Harry looks into Draco’s eyes, searching for an explanation or a sign that Draco needs something.
“You do realise that I have no idea what half of this stuff means?”
“Come, Atlantis!”
“Wait a minute,” Granger ordered, making half the room roll their eyes. ”They just appeared now? While we were wondering how to get out of the room? It’s got to be a clue.”
Draco sat cross-legged on the window seat, watching as Pansy and Blaise lounged on the sofa arguing over a game of Exploding Snap. Usually, their constant stream of bickering would drive him mad, but he hadn’t had much of a chance to spend time with his friends since he and Harry had been bonded — neither of them had — and Draco couldn’t help but watch his friends fondly as they bantered back and forth, each attempting to cheat and getting caught. Harry was out with Weasley and Granger in Hogsmeade, and Draco could only hope he didn’t come back drunk. Harry, as Draco had discovered on New Year’s Eve, had no stomach for liquor, and the last thing he felt like doing was holding Harry’s hair back as he retched up into the toilet like a bloody novice.
Suddenly, Draco pitched forwards slightly and groaned painfully, his hands sliding over his bloated stomach.
“I had every right,” argued Narissa calmly. “He’s the other parent.”
Okay, the easiest bit first: Azkaban. After a very conflicting 5 seconds where every emotion on the spectrum ran through me, I set off for the Ministry and barged right into Kingsley’s office and did something that I always said I would never do — I used my name to get you out. That’s right! I, Harry Potter, The Boy Who Lived To Resent His Fame, demanded that the Wizarding World owed me for saving their arses. I demanded that they put you in a holding cell and not just cart you right off to that blasted depressing rock, and I got them to launch a full investigation into your good friend Orion.
Harry ignored the cold drawl and took a few steps closer to the seahorses, who were chasing each other around Malfoy’s neck and shoulders.
“Oh, we do, do we?” mocked Draco in a sing-song voice. “I’ll have you know that I don’t have to do shit.”
“Relax. McGonagall will never sign off on it. Think of the red tape.”
“Oh, I don’t think it’s broken at all, Harry.” Luna was sitting cross-legged on one of the sofa seats watching the proceedings with a mild expression. “I think it’s given us what we all need.”
“Do you want me to come with you?”
"We're fine! Just need to see if Neville can help me with something. It's a guy thing. Be right back!"
If Severus was shocked by Draco’s sudden appearance in his room at ten o’clock on a Sunday morning, he certainly masked it very well. He merely put down the book which he had been reading and quirked his eyebrow in question.
"Draco! Are you about ready?" Harry perched on the arm of the sofa as he waited for Draco to finally emerge from the bathroom. He'd been in there for nearly an hour! "If you don't get a move on, we'll lose our spot!"
“Forever. I promise,” whispered Harry, before reclaiming his mouth once again.
"I can't have sex with you!" reiterated Harry, sounding completely panicked.
“Pansy!” Draco’s yell seemed to echo around the Great Hall as he stalked through the doors, his eyes narrow as he scanned the Eighth Year table. The woman in question looked up at his shout, breaking off the conversation she’d been having with Granger. Seeing he had her attention, Draco strode furiously towards her until he was towering over her where she sat, causing the majority of the diners to pause their eating to watch.
Harry stared dolefully into his drink for a moment before deciding to cut his losses and leave. He lifted his jacket off the barstool and began to weave his way through the melee when a shock of white-blond hair caught his attention. Surely not, he thought to himself as he found himself craning his head for a better view, and there he was—Draco Malfoy, surrounded by several men, all vying to get his attention.
“No, I shouldn’t have said that stuff. It’s just—” Harry broke off as if searching for the right words before continuing with an air of determination. “I get so lost in all those who died so that we could win, that sometimes it’s just hard to see anything else. This whole night, I’ve been seeing them everywhere I look— Tonks, Remus, Fred. Even Snape.”
Harry retreated once more as Malfoy moved closer to him.
that bad!”
“What makes you think I have no other options?”
“Oh.” The look of foreboding on Harry’s face made him feel utterly petrified, although he couldn’t figure out why. “We can remove the bonding, and we can go on with our lives like before.”
“You don’t think you’re a bit obsessed with him?” Ron nodded at Malfoy’s bemused face.
Harry shook his head at how surreal his life had become as he followed the prim little house-elf through Malfoy Manor. He’d been apprehensive at the thought of having to go back to the place where his friends had been held prisoner and tortured, but he needn’t have worried. The place was unrecognisable, obviously having been redecorated to within an inch of its life. Now, the oppressive rooms were light and airy, something he never thought would have been possible. Finally, after traipsing after the elf for what felt like miles, they came to a stop just outside a large ornate door.
“Not yet,” Harry explained, beginning to inch his fingers closer and closer to Draco’s arsehole. “I need to make sure you’re open, remember? I don’t want to hurt you.”
“I used to; now I’m not so sure.”
Harry had no idea what to do. He’d always sucked at comforting crying people. It had been one of the things Ginny and Hermione had always moaned at him about. This, though, seemed different. More raw. He began to slowly rock them both, smoothing his hands over Draco’s hair and back as he murmured soothing noises into Draco’s ear. After a while, the shuddering had stopped, and Draco was still and silent.
“Fuck off!” huffed Harry, uncomfortable at the sudden turn in the conversation. Taking another bracing slurp of whisky, Harry launched into a detailed recount of his list, much to Ron and Hermione’s delight.
"Funny, Blaise. Really hysterical. Never mind that I've been harassed most of my day, as long as you're provided amusement."
“Why should I?”
Finally, after what felt like a year long battle with his bedding, Harry managed to twist out of his covers and landed with a painful thud on the floor. A loud snore came from Ron’s side of the room, and Harry looked around, amazed to see that Ron had merely rolled onto his stomach and hid his head under his pillow to block out the noise. Honestly, he’d often joked that Ron would sleep through the apocalypse.
Hermione smiled. She was formulating a plan.
“She’s just saying hello, aren’t you, Treacle?” soothed Harry.
“Fine,” agreed Harry, rolling his eyes at Malfoy’s antics.
“Because you don’t have to do this. You don’t owe me anything.”
In the end, Harry managed to coax Draco into having a bath. While Draco washed, Harry set about making some soup and sandwiches for him, along with two pots of tea. He knew Draco wasn’t warming up to the ginger tea but wanted some on offer if he changed his mind. Once the tray was ready, he carefully carried it up to Draco’s bedroom and set it on the desk and waited for Draco to finish up in the bathroom.
As they both chuckled into their breakfasts, large flakes of snow began to fall outside.
"They're sexy, so deal with it." Pansy's tone brooked no argument, and Hermione sighed, knowing it was futile to argue.
"Now? You have work." Neville's eyes widened in alarm at her eagerness.
“For the love of the founders! Can you just back off?” Draco didn’t remember sitting up, or where the sudden burst of energy had come from, but it didn’t seem to matter. He felt hot and prickly, as if his magic was scorching him from the inside out.
“You okay, mate?”
“Forgive me if I’m not jumping up and down with enthusiasm!” Draco felt Harry’s words as if he had been slapped, the sarcastic words mocking his pride. If that was how Harry wanted to be about it, then fine.
to Draco. He hadn’t had a chance to read it yet, what with all the time he’d been spending working with Severus, and Harry had seemed determined to rectify that immediately.
"I can't—" Harry gasped suddenly, lurching out of her arms and retreating to a safe distance a few feet away. "You win! I just can't do this!"
He found himself halting in the kitchen doorway, leaning comfortably against the door jamb, as he watched Draco aggressively shove the broken shards into the bin.
And because I fucking love you too, you idiot.
Draco dutifully lifted the specified book from the shelf and began to flip through it for the section on healing. He pulled parchment, a quill, and some ink from his bag and began to take notes, pausing every now and then to ask Severus a question. Before long, Draco had a sheaf of notes on bases, stabilizers, healing properties, optimal temperatures, cauldron types — anything which Severus thought may be of use was written down.
Harry groaned and turned to see Malfoy striding towards him from across the courtyard. Even from this distance, Harry could see his eyes glowing with outrage and the utter fury in each step Malfoy took.
He closed his eyes for a moment and took a grounding breath, certain that he could smell ash, sweat and something that was inherently Potter. In all honesty, Draco wasn’t sure he could cope with the inevitable trip into his nightmares on top of the reunion. At least, not when he was this sober anyway.
“That’s a duck teddy…something you’re trying to tell me, Malfoy? You have a duck fetish or something?” Draco carefully scanned Neville’s face, determined to seek out any hints of mockery, but all he could see was confusion and slight amusement.
"Me too," agreed Hermione, finally coming to a stop directly in front of Harry. "I really want this to happen. I've been thinking of nothing else all night."
"She's right, Granger." Blaise gave her a quick once over as Pansy manhandled her out of her blouse and nodded. "That's good, but you should hike your skirt up a few inches too. Give him a bit more leg."
“What are you doing,” whispers Harry, unable to hold the silence much longer.
Harry smiled and shook hands with yet another person he didn’t recognise. He nodded and hummed in all the right places, moving from couple to well-meaning couple, assuring them that he was, indeed, thrilled to be there, that the reunion was an inspired idea, and that everyone was very welcome for whatever it was they wanted to thank him for.
With a last look at the Draco shaped lump on the bed, Harry stepped out of the room and closed the door quietly behind him.
Salazar, he was exhausted. It was a pity that he couldn’t just get on with it and die now, that way he wouldn’t need to listen to Potter’s screeching. A sudden tugging at his blankets caused him to open his eyes to find his mother straightening the bedclothes with quick swipes of her hands.
“Hey! I wasn’t stalking!”
“I don’t get it,” Draco frowned as he examined Harry, checking his pupils and laying a hand on his forehead to check for fever. “The antidote should be working by now.”
"Sorry, Nev. We'll try to keep it in the bedroom," promised Harry, his mouth turned in a wry, sheepish grin. He stood up and pulled Draco off to his bedroom, no doubt to pick up where they'd left off.
Draco nodded and took one of the seats at the front of the classroom. He raised his eyes and saw that Severus was waiting rather impatiently, his oil-painted foot tapping.
Harry knocked lightly on the spare bedroom door and stepped inside, closely followed by Kreacher carrying a breakfast tray for Draco.
“Well, obviously,” agreed Draco with slight exasperation, “but getting yourself so worked up you spontaneously combust is hardly going to make this a resounding success, now is it?”
“As nice as it is to listen to the three of you bicker like an old married thrupple—”
"Relax? That's easy for you to say!" Harry scoffed, determined that Draco understood exactly what Harry was up against. "She tried to do a sexy dance for me!"
The heavy tank suddenly felt much lighter as Draco swam deeper down in the reef, much to his immense relief. Harry was just slightly ahead of him, the swish of his flippers and the bubbles from his mouth piece leaving a clear trail for him to follow.
“Magical repair, that will cope with the sal ammoniac…Essence of Dittany? It’s strong, versatile, pH neutral, and facilitates magical healing.
“You know, I would really feel better if you would have some water just now; you’re looking a bit—”
“Just leave, will you? If I have to stay here, then I shouldn’t be forced to look at your stupid face.”
“Circe, a Weasley has just agreed with me of their own free will.” Pansy heaved a sigh, her pretty hair flicking left to right as she shook her head in wonder. “If there was ever a sign the end was nigh and we were all doomed, that was it."
“See! That just proves my point. Why shouldn’t you get to have something more? Why shouldn’t I? It shouldn’t have to be with someone who hates us, who’s only doing it because they must.”
The walk back to their room seemed unusually long, the corridors exceptionally vacant. Draco had gone to see Madam Pomfrey when he left Severus’ rooms. He knew the potion had worked, but it made sense to have her give him a thorough check-up to make sure. The matron had been delighted at his discovery and had assured him that his core was completely regenerated. She’d even lauded his creative efforts and insisted that he submit the potion for trial immediately. ‘
“I’m missing an ingredient and I’m struggling to figure out what.” Draco leaned further into Harry’s ministrations, biting his lip in pleasure. “It’ll come to me.”
“Well, when you put it like that, how could one refuse?”
Draco finally threw his hands up in the air and approached the sofa. He pulled out his wand. "
“Oh Draco, you look terrible! When did you last sleep? Are you even eating?” He stood still as Pansy fussed over him, peering into his face and eyeing him critically. Even Blaise, who was usually unflappable, looked concerned. Not that Draco cared. What did it matter if he ate, anyway?
In his excitement, the remote chime of an incoming Floo-call barely registered in Draco's mind.
“Wait…” Hermione’s entire face shone with curiosity, “you said you made a list of reasons Malfoy could be looking after ducklings. What on earth could you have possibly thought he was up to? Charming them huge and teaching them to spout pure-blood slurs at unsuspecting Muggles?”
He began counting under his breath as she bustled around, emptying the jug and filling it with her wand. “Thank you, Mother. You should sit down though; you look tired.”
Yes, there’s someone I like. Love, actually. They have no idea, and I think they’d die of shock if I ever told them about it. And then everyone else I know would likely die of shock right after them. They could all form an orderly queue to faint one after the other. And I know I was banging on about not being into blonds, but actually, this person has gorgeous blond hair. They’re also used to the finer things in life, and I’m not sure they would ever want to slum it down to my level. Pity, since I think we’d be good together if we got the chance.
“The room?” Weasley asked doubtfully. “It can’t do that, can it? It’s the Room of Requirement. It’s meant to give you what you want, not hold you captive.”
“You can’t; I’ve warded it in case you get any bright ideas like making a sheet ladder.” He’d meant it to lighten the mood, but if he was honest, it wasn't far from what Draco would likely do if given a chance.
Harry sighed and rubbed his eyes tiredly. He didn’t know what he could do to make Draco more comfortable. Behind him, a floorboard creaked, and Harry knew Draco had sought him out.
Suddenly, Harry found himself with a faceful of bushy hair as Hermione held him in a vice-like hug.
have a ridiculous need to state the obvious. The floor is cold. Salazar! Why don’t you tell me something I don’t know?”
“What, Potter?” Malfoy’s resigned sigh almost made Harry feel sorry for him, but he knew better.
Hermione watched with bated breath as Harry finally turned to face Draco, both men with ridiculously sappy looks on their faces.
"Well, so would you if you had to deal with the idiots that have been turning up at the library lately." Draco rested his head on Harry's shoulder and took a steadying breath before continuing. "Teenagers should be locked up. They're so bloody disrespectful!"
“Right, that’s it. If we’re determined to stand about arguing, then we can at least do it inside the bloody room.” Neville began waving his arms in an attempt to shepherd them all through the opened door. “There’s no need to draw any unwanted attention. The last thing we need is for one of the portraits to rat us out to McGonagall.”
“Too late for that.” Harry’s voice was cold and flat and Draco found himself wishing for the fire he so often saw in the man. “You need to leave, Ginny. Now.”
, thought Harry absently.
“Semen? Uncle Sev, please!” He had thought the urine discussion had been bad, but that was before his godfather began talking about Harry’s— How would that conversation even go? The thought of strolling up to Harry, handing him a beaker and asking for a deposit was ludicrous. “Look, can we just agree to rule out anything you wouldn’t personally be comfortable collecting yourself? Thanks ever so.”
“Tell me about it!” groaned Draco in disbelief. “A graded trip from Edinburgh to Paris using three different modes of Muggle transportation? There’s no way I’m doing it!”
“Fuck you!” Harry growled and, instead of pushing Draco away, pulled him closer and roughly fastened his warm lips over Draco’s. The kiss was bruising, punishing, sending an electric jolt through Draco’s body straight to his cock, causing him to mouth soundless curses of pleasure. As if he were waiting for it, Harry seized Draco’s bottom lip between his teeth and bit down hard. The taste of copper trickled onto Draco’s tongue from where Harry’s teeth pierced his flesh, sending bolts of fury-fuelled lust throughout his body.
“Here, mate, it can’t be that bad.”
Neville tried to make sense of everything he was seeing, but it was just too much. He needed to talk to Pansy and Hermione. "Who else knows?"
“Ron, I swear to Merlin…”
“There you go again, all action and no forethought.” Draco’s words held little scorn and too much affection. “Seriously, one would think you were a blushing virgin, forming attachments the second someone gets anywhere near your knickers.”
Dear Draco,
Harry shook his head as if trying to shake away flies and began to pace, his bare chest heaving with each laboured breath.
Slow, he reminded himself, as his fingers itched to wind their way into Harry’s hair. They were going to take it slow. Slow was kissing, and so he tilted his head more to the side and opened his mouth a little more. Harry, who apparently had the same idea, slid his tongue across Draco’s lips, drawing a low groan from Draco as he felt it enter his mouth and curl around his own. The lust from earlier was bubbling away on a slow boil just underneath his skin and, unable to stop himself, he climbed to straddle Harry’s lap, the fluffy blanket still clinging to his shoulders, his knees bracketing Harry’s thighs as he hovered just above the visible bulge in Harry’s bottoms. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist under the blanket, causing Draco to shiver and gasp as warm fingers ghosted the pale skin on his back.
“Nope, the door was already open when I got here. I think the room’s broken.”
“Oh really? Then why?”
It was a fact that his roommate had just gotten back from a shag-fest in Edinburgh when everyone else thought he'd been away at an Auror training in Wales. It was also a fact that this same roommate was currently working on spreading the gel from a plant on his own rash in his bedroom, a rash he'd received by shagging in some naturalistic setting.
“It is.” Harry’s assurance of the severity of the situation made Ron’s eyes widen dramatically. Harry would normally have found it funny.
“Would you come with me to Hogsmeade at the weekend?”
“Erm, my room, the Great Hall, down at the Black Lake, around Hagrid’s—”
Unable to help himself, Harry turned back to Malfoy, who was standing stiffly, his fists shaking where they were clenched at his sides. He took in Malfoy’s now grey skin and how his eyes were shining with unshed tears, and he found himself wondering how someone could look vulnerable and murderous at the same time.
“Don’t tell me what’s good for me, Potter. I’ll be the judge of that.”
I’m going to wait for you to wake up.
“I’ve tried everything I know. For some reason, the room’s keeping us here.”
“I don’t want your help, Potter, and I certainly don’t want a bloody bath. Get it through your head.” Draco rubbed his hands over his face and took several deep, harsh breaths. “Fine,” he snapped after a few minutes, “you win. I’ll stay stuck in here against my will. Happy?”
Really, the depths of the man’s whoring seems to be taking on a whole new level.”
Harry smiled at the palpable relief in Draco’s voice at having a clear plan. It was amazing how order always seemed to calm him. Shaking his head in amusement, he turned back to the boys.  “So, I guess communication should be—”
“Agreed.”
“Get fucked. You’ve both shown your faces, well done. Now you can fuck off back to wherever you came from and leave me alone.”
What in Godric’s name is Personal Magic?”
"A while, but honestly, it's
“So all this, partnering in class, studying together, smiling and saying hi, it was out of pity?”
Harry’s mouth dropped open in shock — a sentiment apparently shared by his husband. The boys were gone. Their chairs were empty. Their plates were gone, along with a large portion of the pancakes, the syrup, and the orange juice. The book was also suspiciously missing.
“You expect me to believe you came up here to chat with your dead mate who may or may not be a ghost? You must think I’m really stupid.”
“No offence, ‘Mione, but if I don’t mellow out soon, then none of us will get out of here because I’ll have killed everyone with my bare hands.” Harry was practically vibrating with the stress of the situation and Draco couldn’t help but agree that perhaps a drink would be a good thing after all.
“Fuck off, Draco,” mumbled Blaise, but the smile on his face told Draco everything he needed to know.
“They said it needed to happen soon or the bonding would fail.”
For some reason, as they both fuss and care for the little birds, Draco thinks that once they get back to his room, there won’t be much talking after all.
Oh, you’re stirring.
Harry stared at the letter for a moment, unsure just how he was supposed to react to such utter rot. Eventually, once the silence had reached new levels of tension, Ron put down his notes and came over to sit next to him.
The girl smiled eagerly, and Pansy beamed, turning to leave the cafe. She hoped the girl approached him before he even left. It'd serve him right.
His arrival had been a blur. One moment he was getting into the school carriages, staring almost aggressively at his feet so he wouldn’t need to see the skeletal black horses pulling the guests towards the castle. He nodded each time there was a break in the conversation, agreeing with whatever Pansy was babbling about. Agreeing with her was usually the best way to go, and he doubted he could have forced any meaningful contributions to the conversation if he’d tried. The clenching around his chest was the tightest it had ever been, and his mouth was dry with the effort of managing to breathe in and out.
“Before the war, I never felt like I belonged anywhere.” Harry explained, his voice low. “It wasn’t until afterwards that I finally felt like I could find a place that was mine simply because of myself and not what I represented. That’s why the birds are flying towards the flock; they’re going home.”
“That’s great, but do you have to go right away?”
You’re smiling with your eyes still closed, and I feel my heart melting.
The coq au vin was really lovely, though. So kudos to you! I knew French was a good suggestion for dinner.
"This is a nice wine; where'd you get it?" As soon as the words were out of his mouth, he cursed himself. He was meant to be flirting, not planning next week's grocery list.
“Do you think everyone’s still here? How much time has passed, do you think?”
“He went to Hogsmeade with Weasley and Granger, I suggest you come back another time.”
,” she clarified, nodding at Harry.
“Okay…you want me to tell you something you don’t know? When I was being sorted, the hat wanted to put me in Slytherin.”
“Don’t worry, Weasley. Potter was hardly my first choice of partner either.”
“What’s happened?” Hermione immediately got up and pulled him towards the bed, peering worriedly into his face.
“Yeah, I know, but it’s not the worst thing, is it?” asked Ron with a careless shrug.
“It’s nothing. I’m fine.” He could hear his voice laced with strain and tried to smile at Harry, wincing when it caused Harry to look back at him pained. “Honestly, I’m just tired. I’m going to grab a quick shower, okay?”
had lost the coveted spot on the winner's plaque. Frankly, Draco wasn't surprised. What with Hermione acting possessed and his phone going off every two minutes, he was just happy they hadn't come in last. As if in response to Draco's thoughts, his mobile began ringing and vibrating on the table, drawing everyone's attention.
Harry turned to see Draco standing, his clothes clutched to his bare chest in a wrinkled bundle.
“Merlin, I’ve wanted to do that for the longest time.” Draco’s heart leaps at Harry’s words, his face flushing with lust as he begins to feel giddy with disbelief.
“You think I’m doing this because, what, you think I’m trying to pay my way? My vaults are hardly empty, Potter.”
Draco was feeling especially optimistic. He had help, notes, and a good idea of where to start. He was certain that he was not only going to get full marks for his project, but that he would live to see his graduation.
He wrinkled his eyebrows as though trying to figure her out, but then he just smiled and shrugged. "No problem. I'll see you back at the flat for dinner."
“You will all stand here and explain yourselves immediately, or so help me, I’ll cut you all off at the bar!”
Ducklings! Malfoy was messing around with a pile of very cold, very soggy, yellow ducklings. He’d been watching Malfoy for the last half hour and all he’d done was put the ducklings in a box and start messing around with wire and grass and whatnot. There didn’t seem to be a mother at all, which was worrying, and Harry found himself hoping that Malfoy hadn’t done anything untoward to her. Unable to stand the cold any longer, Harry heaved himself to his feet and made his way back to the common room. He had a lot of thinking to do and an apparent puzzle to solve.
“Mate, that’s a bit much, even for Malfoy.”
"Indeed," Draco commented, his eyebrows high on his forehead. "So, I take it you sorted it out?"
I would invite you to my humble abode, but it’s really tiny. Possibly too small to contain your Gryffindorish enthusiasm and exuberance. Last week, Pansy came for an elegant soirée of cheese toasties and boxed wine and we had to sit on the bed, because there’s literally no space.
"So," began Draco, after the waitress had brought their cups and Pansy had been sitting staring at him for at least a minute, "you wanted to talk to me about something?"
Blaise let out a thoughtful hum, and Neville groaned.
Draco
“Draco—”
“It’s been twenty minutes, Harry. And where are the books?”
Who on Godric’s green Earth had thought it was a good idea to invite Malfoy to this thing anyway? It was bad enough that they saw each other from time to time and awkward as arse if truth be told. Harry was so sick of seeing that haughty face pale and those cold eyes droop as if steeped in guilt. He didn’t want to remember Malfoy refusing to turn him in at the Manor, surrendering his wand to Harry. The truth was Harry was one more awkward meeting away from obliviating himself of the whole mess.
“Longbottom! I swear to Merlin that—”
And if they did, well, Harry would simply let Pansy deal with them.
He took a long sip of his coffee and was pondering whether he wanted to have toast and jam or not, when the post owls arrived. Draco wasn’t expecting anything from his mother this morning, but he still found himself looking up to see if he could spot Socrates amongst the other owls. He was so focused in his search that he didn’t notice the barn owl until it landed right on his plate, rendering his toast inedible.
He nodded and pushed a folder her way. It was why she put up with him. He was annoying as all hell, but he did good work. And, well, he was one of her best friends. "I'm hungry. What are we doing for lunch?"
Ten minutes later and Draco found himself feeling as if he were going to succumb to tears. He’d already done everything on the list and nothing was working! He’d made them safe, warm, fed them, watered them, and provided a place to sleep — what more was there in life?
“Mr Potter, your word?”
potions stuff.”
As suddenly as the heat arose, it disappeared just as quickly. Draco’s hand had never felt so cold, nor had he ever felt so still inside his own body. Unnaturally still, as if his entire being was mourning the loss of its counterpart. Of Harry. Draco felt his fingers clench tighter around Harry’s hand, as if desperate to prolong the moment of what would surely be their last physical contact for as long as possible.
“I will if you go now.” Promises Draco.
He looked at his mother and marvelled, not for the first time, just how much of a manipulative shrew she could be. Even in his ire, he couldn’t help but be impressed by her tenacity.
He looked around the hall, his eyes darting up and over the walls and faces and lights—Merlin, the lights. His mouth was the driest it had ever been and his head was thumping, and he knew, just
“I got dressed and ate something,” Draco informed him in a quiet voice. “Can I be left alone now?”
Draco had no words, none whatsoever, and that was a first. Apparently, nothing he could say or do would prevent them from telling Potter. He’d felt as though he were finally at peace on the Great Hall floor. Why couldn’t he have died then? But no, he needed to suffer through Potter telling him to fuck off and die without bothering him first. He couldn’t help but wonder if Potter would wish he had left Draco to die in the Room of Requirement after all, just to avoid the inconvenience of being Draco’s core mate. Soulmate. Whatever people wanted to call it. If Draco were being honest with himself, it would have been easier for everyone if he had.
"Not something specific, no. I just realised that we haven't had a proper heart-to-heart in a couple of weeks, and I thought it would be nice to take some time to catch up."
“You know, I hate to agree with her, but Parkinson’s right, Luna.”
“Blaise?” Pansy looked distressed as Blaise strode from the room without looking back. Draco wished wholeheartedly that she would do the same. “How can you talk to him like that? You’ve always been there for your family and friends, no matter what. What’s happened to you?”
“And when will that be exactly,” demanded Draco, his patience with the entire situation finally vanishing.
When she only nodded and gasped at him, Harry felt his concern morph into mild alarm.
He turned to Draco, who was opening and closing his mouth soundlessly at the sight, and suddenly he was laughing. Loud, belly aching, rumbling laughter. Infectious, so much so that in mere seconds Draco had joined him, their laughs echoing off the kitchen tiles. After a few moments, or possibly hours, they managed to rein themselves in, grinning maniacally at each other and wiping tears from their flushed cheeks.
Seamus threw the rope at Draco, who caught it automatically. The rope was heavy and thick, and it was indeed woven into an impossible knot. It was quite attractive actually, and Draco could see why someone would use it to symbolise their love for one another.
“You just want his leftovers, more like.”
“Mr Potter, he is pregnant with
At least an hour had passed, and Draco had to admit he was starting to feel slightly merry. His face was warm and his body felt more relaxed than it had been in days. The room had been growing steadily warmer, another inexplicable clue he supposed, and the majority of the males in the room had shucked their dress robes, their undershirts sticking to their skin with perspiration. Seamus had actually gone one step further and was sitting bare-chested as he passed the whisky around the group. Draco was the only one who still had his dress shirt on, the sleeves still covering his arms.
“Malfoy? You talk too much.”
“Sorry, I just need a break.”
The bonding night and the immediate aftermath.
“You practically stalked him all through Sixth Year—”
“Surely proper preparation is more important—”
Draco found himself meeting her earnest gaze and realised she really was trying her best to get them out. Yes, she was damned annoying about it, but her genuine need to help was clear from the sincerity in her brown eyes. It was this, more than anything else, that prompted Draco to be more forthcoming about his needs when calling the room.
“You’re nothing but a filthy, fucking hypocrite, Potter. Whatever. Keep the fucking room for all I care. I’m out of here.”
“Aye, and I’m the tooth fairy,” snarked Theo, piping up for time.
Draco watched as Harry leaned into him and allowed him to press their lips together. It was a stupid idea, the worst, and utterly doomed, but fuck if Draco could find it within him to care at that moment. He tilted his face, allowing Harry better access and moaned as he felt his tongue meet tongue. At that moment, every possible objection ceased to exist.
Harry took in the frantic look in his grey eyes. “What’s happened?”
The cries were growing in volume, if that was possible. The pitch was now in the high whistle range. It was a possibility that, very soon, only bats would be able to hear them, and wouldn’t that be a bloody blessing! It took everything in his body to resist cowering in the corner of the enclosure with his hands pressed firmly over his ears, but in all honesty, he knew that just wouldn’t solve anything. He peered into the box and squinted at the ducklings. They looked exhausted and upset, and boy did he know the feeling! They looked like they needed to be hugged or something, but how could he do that without bloody touching them! The damned book advised to initially handle them as little as possible.
"So, everyone knows except Ron," Harry said. He ran his finger across Draco's nipple and gave it a little pinch. Draco groaned and tried to adjust himself, but there wasn't much room where they lay together naked on Harry's sofa. "I think I'll talk to him this weekend, let him know I'm seeing someone and that it's a man. We'll give him a few weeks to get used to that idea, and then we'll tell him, yeah?"
“More than being safe?” challenged Draco, his eyebrows high on his forehead.
“They’re beautiful, aren’t they?” breathed Harry, his eyes roaming over the mixture of golden, tan, and red scales that covered the babies in varying patterns.
"Seriously, Nev! She's being weird and touching me and
Draco could see the corner of the portrait’s mouth quirk at the old endearment Draco had called him in life. He swung his bag over his shoulder and strode out of the room. He had a few minutes to get to Transfiguration, and McGonagall wasn’t one to accept tardiness at the best of times.
“Maybe it’s not to do with traditional bonds,” mused Luna, her head tilted to one side in thought. “Marriage isn’t the only kind of bond, you know. Maybe it’s to do with one of those?”
Draco
Once their plates were clean, Draco walked back over to the bed and climbed under the covers, curling up onto his side.
“He’s up to something!”
“Perspective? Really?”
“I’d love to, Malfoy, believe me. But for some twisted reason, we’re partners.”
Hermione dutifully froze as Pansy painted her mouth a rich red. Then, Pansy began to rummage through a pile of shoes, finally locating a pair of impossibly high heels. "Right, put those on and then let us look at you."
body, and I’ll do whatever I want. If I want a hangover potion, then I’ll fucking have one. If I want to get pissed and shag a different guy every night of the week, then that’s my prerogative. Now, let. Me. Go. Or I swear, I’ll strangle you with my bare hands.”
“Feeling unwell, Mr Malfoy?” called McGonagall sharply. Of course, she would have noticed. She noticed everything! Feeling his body relax as the pain began to ebb, he hoisted an innocent smile onto his face.
Once back downstairs, Harry filled a glass of whisky and slumped down into his favourite armchair. A quick glance at the mantle clock revealed it was still only 11.30 pm. Harry couldn’t believe it had only been a few hours since he’d had tea with Narcissa. He took a deep sip of his whisky, relishing the feeling of the alcohol burning away the deep throbbing fatigue that was weighing down his body. It was late, but he knew Narcissa would still be awake, anxiously awaiting news of her son. Gathering his last bit of energy, Harry conjured his stag Patronus and sent it with a message, letting Narcissa know that Draco was safe with him at Grimmauld place and he would contact her again in the morning once he’d spoken to Draco. As the stag cantered off through the wall and away to Wiltshire, Harry took another long sip of his drink and leaned back in his chair, scrunching his eyes tightly shut. He gave his head a light shake and let out a dark chuckle, to think he thought it was a mind fuck when he discovered Pettigrew was still alive. Unfortunately, he wasn’t sure the next morning would be much better. Harry placed his drink on the end table with a final sigh and closed his eyes, finally allowing sleep to claim him.
“Oi Malfoy,” called Seamus heartily, “how come you’re not sitting? You got piles or something?” If the level of rambunctious laughter was any indicator, everyone at the table seemed to find this hilarious. Draco did his best to ignore them all, taking large sips of his coffee even though it was burning a painful path down his throat.
“If you won’t help yourself, then I’ll go talk to Potter, tell him what a state you’re in. Maybe he’ll come back to you.”
"I love you so fucking much, Draco," sighed Harry, wrapping his arms around Draco's waist.
The morning found Draco sitting on the window seat, his eyes heavy from lack of sleep. Harry had worked him pretty hard the night before, wringing two orgasms from his tired body before falling into a boneless sleep. Draco had lain next to him, laden with jealousy. By all rights, he should be snoring in just-fucked bliss, but he was terrified to close his eyes and miss a single moment of his time with Harry. He was just one step away from finalising the potion, that ever-elusive final ingredient, and then Harry would be off. Free.
Blaise raised one eyebrow. "You are one scary witch."
“No, you’re just a guy who’s making bad choices, and I’m trying to help. Look, why not have a bath and try to relax? I’ve had Kreacher bring over some of your clothes. You’ll find them in the dresser and wardrobe.” As an afterthought, he waved his hand to stop the taps running, aware that the bath must be close to full by now.
“Not at all, Headmistress. Just some Pepper-Up. I slept with the window open last night and seem to have a slight sniffle, is all.”
“Did I do something—”
“Draco, is there something with which I can assist you?”
’ Draco was certain he’d never seen the matron so energetic and enthusiastic before. He’d almost recommended she take a calming draught.
Automatically, Harry retook his seat and reached out for Draco’s hand, rubbing his thumb gently over the pulse point at Draco’s wrist.
But you should definitely do something about your secret love. The rest of the world can form an orderly queue and fuck off. It’s your life and you’ve sacrificed enough of it for the greater good. It’s time to do whatever the hell you please, even if it means shocking everyone. And I wouldn’t worry too much about “slumming it down”. Your house was cleaner than I expected. Yes, you could have at least put away the pile of clean clothes, instead of dumping them on the bed, but I doubt you were expecting us to end up sleeping together. Maybe when you invite that bloke over, ask Kreacher to help you tidy up first.
“Harry, come on! Either do it properly or I swear I’ll tell Molly you didn’t eat those pasties she sent over last week.”
After another moment or two of reflection, he confirmed his attendance that evening and sent the haughty owl on its way. Thoroughly intrigued, Harry reached for his coffee and tried to put the letter out of his mind. He had other things to worry about before then, like work.
"No, but he did bump into me on the stairs this morning."
you tell me that I — what was it? — “can’t possibly forgive” you this time? I will do whatever the fuck I like, thank you very much, whether you think it defies all logic or not!
Deep In The Blue
I miss you too; you have no idea how much. Remember that night we both got pissed and couldn’t sleep? I swear, wanking has never been so hot as it was that night. Not that I ever think of it. I don’t know why I even brought it up. Nevermind.
“Well,” began Hermione briskly, “romantic dramas aside, we think we’ve figured out what the room’s been trying to tell us.”
“So, Draco was just supposed to roll over and die?”
"What's wrong," he asked, hoisting what he hoped was an innocent expression onto his face. "Do you not want to do this? If you want to back out, I won't hold it against you."
“You never do, do you, Potter?” demanded Pansy, her eyes blazing with anger. “Do you have any idea what the fuck you’ve just done?” She moved past Harry, bumping him hard with her shoulder as she passed. “You guys talk to him. I don’t even want to look at his stupid face.”
“I love you, Harry. Not sexy love, but
“I don’t think we need to worry about that, considering what we just walked in on.”
Harry pulled his charms essay closer and tried to force himself to focus, but the library was much too quiet, and his heart was far too heavy. He really wouldn’t be surprised if he ended up flunking every class over this mess.
He thought she would shout at him or order him as only a mother could. He never considered she would simply shrink in front of him. His mother, who had always stood so tall no matter what, seemed to crumble into herself, her eyes closing in what could only be defeat.
“Draco—”
“Harry James Potter! I don’t know how, but you need to fix this. Don’t you know what Malfoy’s been going through lately?”
“Here, let me try,” offered Hermione, face wet from tears at hearing Malfoy’s rant.
“You know she’s got a formidable Reducto, old man. Best not risk it.”
“Urine,” declared Severus, pointedly ignoring Draco’s horrified expression. “It’s sometimes used in healing potions and has the benefit of being resistant to dissipation.”
The sombre atmosphere in the kitchen was palpable as Harry sat next to Draco at the breakfast table. Waiting. There was nothing worse than knowing something was about to happen and being forced to await that fate, like the condemned man about to face the noose. Even the twinkling of the Christmas lights wasn't enough to lighten the mood. He needed to do something, anything — all this sitting around was driving him mental. He surveyed the breakfast laid out on the table, taking in the platters heaped with pancakes, bacon and eggs, toast, and bagels. Syrups, jams, tea, coffee, and orange juice, all sat proudly on the table in their respective pots.
be in for it."
“I do hope I’m not interrupting your snooping.”
"Ha!" crowed Hermione, her face flushed with her success.
My Potion Master apprenticeship is going well, but Orion is a bit too forward sometimes. He has been hinting at the fact that I look fit and I’m single and that no one else would be interested in a Death Eater. His comments are making me slightly uncomfortable, but I’ll survive. Pansy says he just wants to shag me. I supposed I should be grateful that he offered me a job and a flat just above the lab, in spite of my not-so-spotless background. Beggars can't be choosers, as Orion likes to remind me.
“Because you’re the only one I’ve ever let fuck me, Scarhead.”
"Of course. Why wouldn't I be?"
“You want to fuck, Malfoy?” asked Harry, feeling suddenly predatory. He moved in close enough for their breath to mingle and placed his hands on Draco’s hips. “Well, if it’s a fuck you want,” Harry suddenly spun Draco around and pushed him forwards, so he was bent against the mantle, his arse sticking out tantalisingly. “then a fuck is what you’ll get.”
"Silencio!" The spell hit her before she even registered the wand. When had Neville become so fast? He grabbed her and Blaise and pulled them into the corner, throwing up a Privacy Charm before releasing her from his spell.
“Sorry, mate. I’d better get this one home.”
Harry looked at each of his friends with impatience. Couldn’t they see that he didn’t have time for this? Malfoy already had a head start, although Harry had a fair idea where he might be headed.
Salazar, you look absolutely gorgeous, all naked and soft next to me. Your hand is reaching for me, pulling me closer like the possessive little lion that you are.
“You’re mental," declared Harry, a beatific grin spreading across his face, "and so am I. I think It’s a brilliant idea.”
Neville and Blaise were both openly laughing at her now. "Ages," Neville finally answered. "And now you guys know too, which is great, so they can stop sneaking around and we can just all talk about it!"
“Hey, watch the goods,” he admonished snootily, although the effect was ruined by the chattering of his teeth.
put a bit of a damper on the holiday. As he fixed the last clips of the air tank together, he became aware of Draco's clipped tones and turned to see his partner cursing the air blue at the poor assistant who drew the short straw in helping him into his wetsuit.
to do this. It’s important to me.
“Well? What are you waiting for, an engraved invitation? Get that horny miscreant out of my room this instant, or I swear I’ll—”
Minutes later, they both stumbled into Harry’s room, red faced and gasping for breath.
demanded Harry, finally catching up with what was going on. "Who's
“You’re not so bad, you know, Draco,” informed Harry, linking his fingers with Malfoy’s, “when you’re being decent, that is.”
Pansy reacted much like a raging bull that had a red flag dangling in front of its face. Before Draco could process the situation, Pansy had stepped around him, pulling her wand out of her sleeve as she went. Ginny had also drawn her wand and both women were aiming at the other. As quick as a flash, Blaise stepped in between the two women, pushing Ginny’s wand down towards her side, and Draco grabbed Pansy around the waist as she thrashed and bucked, desperate to get to her quarry.
Over the course of the next week, Harry attempts to make things right. Any time he sees someone bothering Malfoy — Draco — he steps in. He has a word with the rest of his year one by one, telling them in no uncertain terms that Malfoy is officially off-limits, and that anyone who messes with him would essentially also be messing with Harry. It seems to do the trick and, as far as Harry knows, no one has said or done anything remotely mean to Draco the entire week.
“Don’t worry about it too much, Kreacher,” assured Harry gently. “He’ll feel better after he has the breakfast you brought him.”
Harry went to share an eye-roll with Ron, only to find him looking at him funny.
At Draco's soundless gasping and gaping, Harry grinned and continued to explain. "We both need a holiday. It's been two years since we had a proper break. And so," he declared, pulling some printed pages out of his pocket, "I booked us a last-minute holiday to Malta — diving at Qawra Reef, to be exact!"
"It's ten! Ten, Potter!"
“Let me see that for a second,” he demanded, pushing Harry’s foot off his lap and tugging the magazine out of Harry’s loose grip. His eyes flew over the words, growing wider with each passing second.
Harry nodded his understanding, and the elf vanished with a loud crack. He took a moment to gather his courage, pushed the door open, and stepped inside.
“Wait a minute,” Draco scrunched his eyebrows, mentally running through the options, “there’s no point in talking about prep if you haven’t established consent.”
“So, once we’re back at the party, would you like to dance with me?”
He offered Draco a weak smile and exited the room, leaving Draco feeling more alone than he had in a long time.
“Just fucking do it already, you fucking tw- oomph.”
“Come and sit down. It’s best to just get this over with, don’t you think?” He was aiming for calm and hoped the look on his face was more encouraging than it was weird.
"Ouch," Harry complained.
With that, Hagrid stomped off back towards his cabin, leaving Draco to stare after him in desperation.
The entire group seemed to groan as one, all of them were more than used to Harry’s Malfoy fixation by this point.
“Poor you. Wasn’t it awful being paired with
Somewhere around dawn, Draco had finally got out of bed and sat at the window, looking out at the sun rising over the damp grounds. Finally, Harry began to stir, and Draco pushed himself off the window seat and climbed back in beside him. Harry did so much for him, the least he could do was wake him up properly.
"Well, in that case," she drawled, pushing herself off the couch and stalking slowly towards where Harry stood as if petrified, "maybe we should skip the massage and just go straight to the bedroom after all?"
Draco felt frozen to the spot with misery. He tried to catch Harry’s gaze, but the Gryffindor looked right through him as if he were made of air.
“Reason be damned. It’s all well and good being reasonable, but passion is what drives us. And no one else but us has to accept it anyway.”
“But— but I don’t know anything about raising ducklings! What am I supposed to do?”
Granger sank back on her heels and slid her wand back into her sleeve, her shoulders dropping.
“Fuck off,” Potter said, smiling. “I’m roasting too, and if you’re going to strip off a bit, then I suppose I could too.”
"How so?"
Jokes apart, send my regards to Granger and Crookshanks (don’t bother with Weasley). I can’t believe you let a cat destroy your teabags. Honestly, Potter? You defeated a Dark Lord and capitulated to a kitten? I can only imagine what the
“About what? You haven’t actually asked me anything yet.”
Neville halted, and his gaze was intense, reminding Draco that this was the man who stood up to Voldemort and beheaded the man's snake. It was easy to forget sometimes, but now… "To be fair," Neville said, his voice dry, "it's your own fault for not being able to keep it in your pants. Anyone else would try to be as discreet as possible, but not you two. You've got to send pervy notes to each other by owl and shag in the workplace. You've only yourselves to blame!"
“Now, I must impress upon you both that there are restrictions and negative aspects of this spell. It’s still awaiting full approval, so not all side effects may yet be known. When your core twin is revealed, they may not be in a position to help you. For example, they may be deceased, sick themselves, or unwilling to participate in the healing process. Lastly, there is a chance that this spell may not work. In the trials, there was a ninety-five percent rate of a successful cast, with five percent of the patients yielding no results at all.
Every step he took brought another introduction, another well-wisher, another grateful fan. If only he’d brought his cloak as he’d originally planned, but Hermione refused to entertain the idea. It hadn’t seemed worth it to argue. Just when he thought he couldn’t take it anymore, McGonagall had parted the crowd like a tartan-clad Moses, telling everyone to let him have some refreshments before he suffocated. He’d honestly never felt like kissing anyone so much in his life. As far as he was concerned, she was
Finally, Draco gulped down the last dregs of his coffee and made his way out of the hall, determined to fit in a visit with the ducklings before class started. As the other eighth years called out duck puns at his back, he found himself shaking with rage. This really was all he needed. He should never have come back in the first place.
"Forget how they found out. I'm more interested in why they're messing with us," demanded Harry.
— a gay bar that was infamous for one night stands and bathroom fumbles. He’d already checked out three other bars in search of Draco and had had no luck so far. Merlin, he had to find the idiot before he did some permanent damage to himself and the...well, that was something they were going to have to discuss later on.
As he lay on the bed, the tingles of magic ghosting over his skin as the Healer performed his spells, he couldn’t help but marvel at the kindness the man was showing him, at the gentle touch of his magic. A tear escaped, and another, and another, burning trails of self-pity down his cheeks and into the soft fabric of the pillow underneath his head. He didn’t deserve anything good.
Draco was gasping now, great heaving sobs that shook his whole body as he continued to attack Harry, but the blows were losing their aggression. Finally, they stopped altogether, as Draco succumbed to his tears. His eyes closed, and Harry managed to catch Draco as his body went limp with sadness. Carefully, he wrapped an arm around Draco’s shoulders and hooked the other under Draco’s knees, and carried him over to the bed. He sat down, balancing Draco upon his knee, and wrapped the blanket tightly around Draco’s shoulders as they shook with the force of his sobs.
“Hospital wing with Neville. The idiot was experimenting with cross-pollinating Venus flytraps and Venomous Tentacula. Seriously, he was lucky Harry was running late on his morning jog, or who knows what would have happened to the great buffoon.

He was just finishing his breakfast of coffee and toast, Greg sitting sullenly spearing sausages to his left, when he felt the usual dull ache in his chest shift to something sharper. He’d been warned that it would progress quickly, with him likely being bedridden by Christmas. So far, he’d been able to manage the pain without any potions, the throb akin to bad heartburn. However, this new, sharp jabbing inside his chest was something else. It needled and stabbed in short bursts as he breathed, a thin sheen of sweat already forming on his upper lip. He’d taken to carrying around a dose of Pain-Relief potion just in case a moment like this occurred, and he grudgingly found himself pulling the little bottle out from inside his robes and quickly drank the contents.
Severus didn’t need to vocalise that Draco was right — the ghost of a smile lifting the corner of his mouth and the slight sheen of pride in his eyes was more than enough for Draco. Quickly, he pulled his notes closer and began to scribble furiously, pausing now and then only to look up dosages and preparation of volatile ingredients in the ancient-looking reference book next to him. He was close to solving it; he just
“See you soon, and try not to work too hard!”
Harry, you said that I’m selling myself short and I should ask the bloke I’m in love with to go out with me, but I can’t. I simply can’t. I would lose so much. I would lose a precious friend and the best person in my life and I simply cannot do that. And I know you are going to say that I’m a coward, but this is not about being brave. I’d like to think that I’ve become a more sensible person than I was a few years ago, and I want to cherish the few important things in my life. So this is me, being considerate and reasonable. I won’t tell him about my feelings, because that’s the sensible thing to do, and I don’t want him to hate me.
He surveyed the nearly empty room and sighed, thinking of how busy the Gryffindor common room was likely to be. In all fairness, Harry couldn’t blame the eighth years. He’d spent a lot of his time in his room as well. It was either that or get up close and personal with people he wouldn’t usually need to get close and personal with. He dumped his stuff onto the arm of one of the large armchairs near the fire and flopped down, grateful for the heat chasing away the gooseflesh from his wind-chilled skin.
may not need to breathe anymore, but I sure do!”
I came on your stairs, for Merlin’s sake…We didn’t even make it to the bedroom.
At first, Draco wasn’t sure if Potter had heard him — he certainly gave no evidence of it — but after a long moment, he raised his gaze to look Draco in the eye. Even then, Draco wasn’t sure he was actually going to say anything. Eventually, in a broken, scratchy voice, he began to talk.
“I’m not letting you do this, Draco. You’re not going through all that hassle of saving yourself only to fade away pining over Potter. He’s miserable too, you know. Granger said he’s been in a foul temper since Sunday.
“Ginny, you need to stop before you say something you can’t take back.”
“What did you give him?”
He saw Narcissa roll her eyes ever so slightly and couldn’t help but feel indignant. It was a valid question as far as he was concerned. If guys could go around getting knocked up, then there would be loads of them waddling about Diagon Alley moaning about the lack of weird ice cream flavours.
“Draco, the Healer is coming. Try to stay awake, my darling.” Salazar, his mother’s voice was laced with fear and worry and something else unidentifiable. It made him want to sink down into the dark and hide from whatever had her so upset. It made him want to lunge out of the fog and wrap his arms around her and vow to protect her no matter what. As it was, he could do nothing except lie there, blinking his eyes painfully, the light pounding at his head, his mother’s face fading in and out of focus with each pass of his lids over dry eyes.
"Well, it's meant to hold a mini, rechargeable core for basic household spells to help Squibs with day-to-day stuff. Except, after three or so spells, the core would overheat and send random sparks shooting out the end."
“Found sommat? Found wha’?”
That morning while getting dressed, he’d noticed his magic was beginning to lose its stability too. He’d been trying to cast an Anti-Crease Charm on his robes and had ended up having to ask Blaise to do it instead, claiming he was too tired to do it himself. Not that him being tired was a lie — his sleep pattern had dwindled to practically nothing. He was lucky if he managed three undisturbed hours at night, often waking up shaking violently and drenched in sweat.
Harry quickly snatched his wand from his bedside table, slid it into his back pocket, and stepped out into the corridor, locking the door behind him.
Malfoy was only a few yards away from Harry now, and Harry could feel the cool brick of the wall press into his back, alerting him to the lack of retreat. He found himself wondering if Ron would intervene if Malfoy hit him, which he was surely gearing up to do.
"Say, Hermione-love, do you have plans for later?" If possible, Hermione seemed to pale even more at Harry's words, especially when they got huskier as he continued. "Maybe you could come by for a drink and we could talk, you know, just the two of us?"
“He tried to kill me.” Harry heard his argument fall flat in the face of Malfoy’s wrath.
Neville gave a sigh that positively reeked of frustration. Draco would feel bad, except Neville could have prepared them for whatever this was and hadn't.
“Mr Potter!” Madam Pomfrey’s sudden yell almost caused Draco to jump out of his pyjamas. “If you insist on behaving like a bad-tempered, overgrown baboon, then I will have no choice but to sedate you! Now, you will remember your manners and behave in this hospital wing with proper decorum!”
Friday at 6 is a done deal. I’m happy to go for tea or dinner, but if you’re up for it, you could come to mine? I’m still at Grimmauld, and the wards are still set to let you in. We could have something to eat and watch a movie? I would cook, of course. There’s no way I’m letting you near the kitchen after the chickpea disaster when you decided to make your own hummus. Seriously, I still have nightmares about it!
"You've taken off...you've changed," blustered Harry, much to Hermione's delight.
Behind him, the door opened and thudded closed, signalling the arrival of Potter — Harry. They were bonded, surely that put them on a first-name basis? He turned around and stared at Harry, the way his silver robes hung from his sloped shoulders as he leaned against the closed door. Draco found himself meeting Harry’s stare, noting that he looked about as happy with the current situation as he himself was. They found themselves holding the melancholic look, breaking it only to blink heavy lids over wet eyes. The silence stretched on between them like a gaping chasm. They both knew what came next once it was breached.
Hermione gave a little huff. She hated it when people knew things before her. "Does Pansy know? Ron can't possibly or he'd have lost his mind already."
Draco 2, Harry 0.
“I’m not apologising! And I wasn’t being horrible, either.”
"A lovely hotel in Edinburgh. And I can't explain the trousers because I don't kiss and tell."
Please…
“Right.” Harry was nodding as he spoke, as if trying to lend his words some authority. “Right, I’m just going to get out of these robes. Into my pyjamas, I mean. Not naked…I mean, I know we’ll need to eventually…not that I’ve thought about it…” The more he spoke, the more panicked the look in Harry’s eyes became. Honestly, Draco was feeling the same, and it was this sense of kindred that made him want to put the other man at ease.
Harry looked at where Malfoy’s hands were tugging at his arms, trying to force him to help find his missing pet. Yes, Malfoy had been an arse about the whole thing, but he could see it was coming from a place of love, misguided as it was.
“You’re wanting to go into Healing after graduation?”
Harry starts to notice things. How Draco nibbles on his bottom lip when chopping and measuring in Potions. How graceful his wand movements are in Charms and Transfiguration. Somehow, Harry finds himself simply trying to copy Draco rather than bothering with the professors’ instructions. He notices that Draco has tea with Hagrid in his hut twice a week for about half an hour at a time. They talk about the ducklings’ progress and Draco genuinely seems to enjoy the meetings, as short as they are.
“You know that we all need to do a project for Potions? I’ve been using my core sickness for mine. Before you were told, I was looking for a cure so I could bypass bonding with my core mate.” Draco did his best not to fidget, determined to appear calm. “Well, after the Christmas holidays, I kept working on it, rather than starting from scratch on something else.” He looked Harry fully in the eye, determined to see it through. “Harry, it worked. I found a cure.”
Draco was lying on his side on top of the bed. He was still in the same clothes he’d arrived in and had clearly not washed in any way. His cheeks and eyes were blotched and red from crying. The rawness of the red only served to make the rest of his skin look much more pale than usual, verging on drawn and peaky. His whole body was quivering, letting Harry know he was awake even though his eyes were closed. His arms, though, were what shocked Harry the most.
“Definitely,” answered Harry. “There’s nothing else I’d rather be doing.”
“Hey,” smiled Blaise, showing a flash of his perfect white teeth. “Where’s Potter?”
“You’d think you’d be done by now, what with the amount of time you’re putting into it.”
“Shove off, Blaise. Don’t you have a trussed up Weasley to try and deflower?”
“How do you feel, Draco?”
“Yeah, Seamus had a pool going on whether you’d be crushed or not.” Dean grinned as he slung a casual arm around Harry’s shoulders.
He cocked his head and listened, his stomach beginning to churn at the low, pleasure-filled moans and breathy declarations. The noises suddenly grew in volume and frequency, giving Neville no doubt as to what they were up to. He leapt to his feet and fumbled for his coat, but just as he was thrusting his feet into his trainers, Harry's yells of appreciation for Draco's size reached an ear-splitting volume. Like a rat out of a trap, Neville grabbed his keys and wand and Disapparated.
“N—no, it’s just a lot. Just let me adjust.” Harry nodded mutely, beads of sweat forming on his forehead at the effort of holding still. After a long moment, Draco clenched his muscles around Harry’s cock, and began to lift himself up and down Harry’s shaft, moving slowly at first, until it was no longer enough.
Vindication blazed through his body, burning away any fatigue from the chase. Malfoy hadn’t noticed him yet and Harry found himself taking advantage, slowly creeping forwards inch by inch.
"Well, ah—" croaked Harry, fighting to keep his equilibrium. Images of Hermione pouring oil over her breasts flashed before his eyes, and he panicked. "That sounds very nice. I'll just pop into the bathroom and get some massage oil, then."
"As much as it may be difficult for you to grasp, but I
“I need to fix this.”
“Do what?”
“You bes’ lead the way.”
Minutes later, or maybe hours, Draco returned to the bedroom and stopped in front of the mirror, his towel slung loosely around his hips, the reflection of his heat-blemished skin stark against the white of the Sectumsempra scars on his chest. All he wanted to do was get into something comfortable and hammer through the mountain of homework that was beginning to accumulate. He grabbed some matching grey pyjamas from his trunk at the bottom of his bed, and then froze. There was something on his bed. Something large and fluffy and obscenely yellow.
“Truth, Potter?” spat Draco. “You wouldn’t know the truth if it slapped you upside your stupid scarred head.”
“You know what? Weasley was right. We should get this over with.” Draco quickly reached out for Harry, his hands gripping Harry’s face with bruising force, bringing them close enough for their heated breaths to mingle.
"Shhhh, it's alright," Blaise reasoned, rubbing small circles at the bottom of her back. "I bet Harry is freaking out way more than you are. Believe me, you look hot, and he hasn't been interested in a woman in ages. You're totally intimidating him."
“What’re you doing with that?” asked Ron, preferring whatever Harry was up to rather than his Charms homework.
He finished rinsing his hair and began to wash his body, the citrus scent of Harry’s favourite soap mixing intoxicatingly with the apple scent of Draco’s shampoo. He was rapidly falling for Harry, that much was obvious, enough to do the right thing and let him go. As he watched the last of the soap suds wash down the drain, Draco decided he would redouble his efforts on his cure and set Harry free.
“Where have you checked so far?”
The room narrowed down, the dark edges honing in closer and closer. As the last bit of light faded out, he found himself wishing he hadn’t been so hard on his mother — she meant well.
In the end, curiosity won out and he found himself pulling a nondescript folded piece of parchment out from its envelope. He unfolded the parchment and froze, the parchment dropping onto his plate, his stomach swooping with dread as his eyes read the messy scrawl over and over again.
Draco barely fought back a groan at the idea of his mother interfering once again. What the hell had she said to Potter? Not that Potter rightly gave a rats arse about ex-Death Eaters like himself. Draco didn’t bother to look up at the sound of spike heels fading as his mother clipped out of the infirmary. He looked over at Potter and noticed his face was blotchy, as if he had been crying, or had been slapped on both cheeks. Personally, Draco hoped it was the latter.
The day had passed by quickly, with Harry attending classes and having dinner in Hagrid’s hut, that it was nearly curfew when he finally made it back to his room. He was worried about having left Treacle alone for so long, but Ron had promised to keep an eye on her for him. If anything had changed for better or worse, Ron would have told him right away.
“What, and you think
“Wait! Just hold your horses.”
"So, you're okay with this?" Draco asked, pulling his lips from Harry's to look at Neville with cautious eyes and a hesitant voice.
“Can we stop the theatrical wand-waving and get back to the task at hand?”
"Harry, just calm down, mate." Neville tried to pry himself out of Harry's clutching fingers.
Draco found himself nodding in assurance, indignation rising within him. Nosy old bat; what business was it of hers to question what potions he did or did not take? He quickly swallowed the rest of his coffee and left the table, Greg grabbing a last sausage from the plate as he followed. It was almost time for Potions class anyway.
"Harry's acting a bit strange, isn't he?" He kept his voice casual. "I'll just go and check if he's all right." Without waiting for an answer, he stalked off in pursuit of Harry.
He tapped the finished paper crane with his wand and watched in satisfaction as it flew across the room and landed in front of Malfoy. He couldn’t see if the git had opened it or not, and he waited for several tense minutes for a reply. Just when he was about to give up hope, the bird flapped down in front of him, stilling its wings at his touch.
The air inside Severus’ room was becoming unbreathable. Perhaps it had been a mistake to experiment with an acid base and unicorn horn, mused Draco, as he vanished as much of the acrid smoke as possible with his wand.
“Well, it’s about time.” Pansy’s amused drawl was like a bucket of ice water and Draco jerked away from Harry, his face hot with kissing and humiliation. It wasn’t just Pansy, it was the entire group, each wearing varying expressions of smugness. “I was wondering when you guys were going to come up for air. We think we might have solved it.”
thought Draco bitterly. The only person with kind words for him these days was his mother. “Ah, nice to meet you, Mr Malfoy.” Pain shot across Draco’s head as he tried to wrinkle his forehead at the realisation the man
“Oh really? Let me see,” mocked Ron, “you talk about Malfoy all the time—”
Before Harry could process the situation, Draco whipped his wand out of his sleeve and stunned him, taking care to cast a Cushioning Charm as he fell so he wouldn’t get hurt. Once he was sure Harry was safe for the moment, he let the rage he’d been holding back take root. He pushed his feet into his shoes without bothering with socks and threw a travelling cloak over his joggers and t-shirt, taking off at a run towards the Great Hall, determined to find Pansy before she could do anything else to make it worse.
“Honestly, Potter,” sighed Draco, his frustration evaporating in the rising temperature. “I’m not up to anything. I’m just too hot and I wanted a bit of privacy to take some layers off, if that’s okay with you, of course.”
As if by magnetic pull, Draco leaned into Harry, his head tilting to compensate for the slight height advantage he had. Harry didn’t move, neither away nor closer, but Draco couldn’t help but notice how the green orbs kept roving over his mouth.
We really hope you enjoyed this story!
The absolute worst thing, worse than any rumours or the glares that Malfoy kept sending his way whenever their paths crossed, was the way Treacle was behaving. She barely slept, barely ate, and never wanted to play or leave her tank. She just floated listlessly, letting the water currents push her around the water.
“There will be several cars, each one with a Muggle-born witch or wizard who will be your driving instructor. You are all required to adjust your mirrors and observe safety, start the car, drive forwards for one hundred yards, turn, drive back to where you started, and stop. Anyone not observing safety measures, being insulting, or generally interrupting class, will be sent directly to Headmistress McGonagall for punishment.”
Not that I’m complaining. By the time we made it to the bed, you were a whimpering mess and all I had to do to make you fall apart was put my hands on you and lick my way up your legs, nipping the soft skin of your thighs, gently suckling on the head of your cock. You taste so lovely, Harry. I could spend my days mapping your skin with my mouth – and I intend to.
“You know what, Potter? You’re on. But don’t wear those trainers. And comb your hair for once. And bring your galleons because Malfoys are not cheap dates.”
"Sorry, Nev, it's just...opened the letter...he never told me...and now…"
“Ducklings. They’re abandoned and I thought you would know what to do with them?”
If I can’t have you, then I don’t want anyone else.
Where Draco ends up in the hospital wing and Harry finds out he's Draco's core-mate.
Your last letter… just...
“What, like it wants them to shag or something?” asked Seamus, his voice hitching with inebriation. “Fat chance of—”
And I suppose I deserve it.
“I’ve got it safe for now, don’t worry.”
I can't say that I miss your messiness and your dirty clothes piled on the floor, but I got used to having you around and now the house seems so quiet and empty. The nights are too long, especially when I have to face them
"You could have just asked me to get up," Neville said with a scowl, scooting himself into a sitting position.
“Yes, I understand.” How could he not? The man had taken ridiculously patient measures to explain his illness. Even a bumbling Weasley could grasp his meaning by now. Longbottom, however, may have needed another round of illustrated flashcards.
"What did you see?" he asked, his eyes narrowed and a little wild.
"Honestly, Draco," Hermione agreed, taking one of the armchairs and pulling a book out of her pocket. "Or you could have just taken one of the other seats."
“But?” prompted Harry, nerves plain across his face.
“It’s not like they’ll end up pregnant, is it?”
“Excuse me,” demanded Malfoy, “what are you all doing here? You can’t all have been following me!”
“It’s not pretentious,” Malfoy argued, raising his chin in defiance. “It’s a strong, magical name.”
He slid a little closer, appearing oblivious to her rising discomfort. However, before Draco could begin to enjoy Hermione's discomfort, his mobile rang with yet another unidentified number. He fought back a grin and answered, ready to play his part to perfection.
“Had your eye on one of your fellow Death Eaters, did you?” Her words made something inside him snap, and before he knew it, he was stepping into her space, his eyes boring into hers as he towered over her.
“I’m sorry, I should have knocked. It’s not my room anymore…but I need to talk to you. I miss you. I know I shouldn’t, but I do. I liked living with you, loved having you around. Miss your drama and tantrums. I miss your complaining and the scathing comments you make about my clothes and hair. I even miss reading stupid Potions articles to you.”
Draco watched for Hermione's reaction as Harry practically ran to the men's room. She looked triumphant, and she was grinning at Blaise. Draco pushed himself out of his chair and turned to his friends, none of them appearing overly surprised at Harry's escape. They were up to something.
Draco stood in the middle of the room feeling adrift. He kept his eyes fixed on the floor, unable to look Harry in the eye. It
He stood there for a long moment, breathing through his anger, and then forced himself to step the rest of the way into the room, closing the door behind him and securing it with a strong locking charm. The room was mercifully empty, Longbottom was perhaps visiting his girlfriend along the corridor. Draco leaned heavily against the door, his eyes fixed ahead of him. He stood there for several long moments, trying to find the wherewithal to deal with this latest development.
Eventually, after what seemed like several months, the buzzing had receded entirely, and Harry was able to blink his eyes back into focus. Narcissa was peering at him in concern as a house-elf was spooning sugar into his cup of tea.
Draco whipped his head around at the mention of his name and was presented with the nauseating sight of the girl Weasley hanging all over Potter. The way she said his name, as if he was less than shite on her shoe, made his blood thunder in his ears.
Harry made his way towards Ron’s room, whipping off the invisibility cloak as he went. He gave the door a cursory knock and barged in, unsurprised and unbothered when Ron and Hermione flew apart from each other at his entrance.
“Where are my shoes? You know what, never mind my shoes. Where’s my wand?”
“Well, you have to admit having a stuffed duck doesn’t do much for the Death Eater image!” Seamus looked like the Kneazle that had got the cream as everyone laughed and agreed with his statement and Draco wanted nothing more than to hex the stupid big smirk off of his smug face.
"Oh, just sit down, you big lummox, and I'll order you some tea." She signalled the waitress to bring their drinks over, waiting as Draco got his coat off and situated himself comfortably.
It won’t be easy, and we’ll likely argue about 80% of the time, so you need to decide if you can handle it or not.
Ginny stood for a moment, her mouth hanging open in shock, before turning sharply on her heel and leaving, her red hair billowing dangerously behind her.
"Look, I know this is awkward as arse," said Draco softly, "but we can't let them win. You go out there and do whatever it is you need to do to make her crack, and I promise I'll make it worth your while."
The way you kissed me and whispered that you love me…
Harry felt his eyes widen in horror as he took in Malfoy’s bed hair, the lean muscle of his arms folded across the chest of his tight black t-shirt, his pale bare feet sticking out of the bottom of his blue pyjama bottoms.
“Of course, I fucking love you!”
"Why? Do you plan on breaking out the moves?" he found himself grinning as he put on an Amy Winehouse CD belonging to Neville. Hermione, as a rule, never danced unless it was formal dancing at a special occasion.
Twelve minutes past one. Draco was late, and Pansy found herself getting irate.
They all sat for a moment, as if waiting for a momentous sign they were free.
Draco looked up from his notes as Harry breezed into the room humming something unidentifiable, carrying a large bundle of sandwiches and a jug of pumpkin juice which he placed at the edge of the workstation.
“Must you always be this difficult?”
“I’m getting them some juice—”
“Fine!” screamed Draco, and he slammed his foot as hard as he could on the left pedal. The car lurched and shuddered to a stop as the brakes screamed in protest. The air was filled with the smell of burning rubber. “Happy? We’ve fucking stopped! Oh!” Draco found himself sitting in utter surprise at the realisation he had managed to complete the circuit, the car currently stopped directly where they had started. “See!” he demanded triumphantly, “I did it! Better and faster than you!”
On the subject of Baz, I refuse to own an owl who is so easily swayed by Slytherin charm. Therefore, you are now Bartholemew’s new owner. (Don’t blame me for his name; he came with it. Why do you think I shortened it?) It’s actually perfect timing for Baz’s true colours to come out since I’ve recently adopted a new one. I found Calliope injured the other day and I’ve been looking after her. She’s a lot nicer than Baz and seems really happy to stay, so congratulations! You’ve just got yourself a mean owl. Enjoy!
Quickly, he went into the en-suite and turned the taps on full, adding a generous amount of bubble bath to the water. From the smell of things, Draco would definitely be needing a long bath. Leaving the tub to fill, Harry went back into the bedroom to find Draco sitting up and grumbling.
He couldn’t stand it! Hell, he couldn’t even think! No wonder their mother had opted to be eaten! Remembering the book Hagrid had given him, he lunged for it and quickly opened the cover to the introduction, reading aloud.
“Hey, Treacle,” he said, dipping his hand into the water to tickle his fingers along the seahorse’s bumpy belly. “You fancy going down to visit Hagrid?”
"Why didn't you tell us?" Draco demanded, irritated.
“What’s your problem?”
Their kisses grew more frantic — with tongues and teeth — making both of their bodies hard with desire. Unable to fight the need any longer, Draco pushed his hands into Harry’s hair, using the leverage to tug Harry’s head back so he could kiss his way along the now exposed jawline, relishing in the burn of slight stubble rubbing against his sensitive skin. The need to mark Harry began to rise again, and he found himself pulling Harry’s t-shirt off, unable to stop from running his hands all over Harry’s chest. Draco scraped his nails across pebbled nipples, making Harry growl and arch up to capture Draco’s mouth in a bruising kiss. Draco returned the kiss with fervour, sucking on Harry’s tongue obscenely as Harry began to run his hands over the globes of Draco’s arse cheeks.
“I just want this to go well. I figured since they made it to this age and it never came up that we'd gotten away with it. I’ve never had to do this before, you know.”
“What about what’s good for the baby, then?” challenged Harry, suddenly fed up with the whole thing.
Draco tried to keep his hands steady as he tipped three level scoops of powdered Moonstone into the cauldron. The sudden and sporadic tremors in his hands were a relatively new development and caused no small amount of trouble when he was trying to work on his cure. In all honesty, he put a lot of effort into not dwelling on his ailment, finding it best to bury himself in homework and his Potions project.
“Not Potter — Harry. Always just Harry. I want to try again, see if we could work out together properly.”
"Do you like it?" she asked, licking her lips lasciviously. "It made sense since you're going to massage me, and I was feeling just so hot from being around you."
Clothes began to drop to the floor as they ripped t-shirts off and tugged open trousers. All too quickly, they were naked and on top of the bed. They grunted
Ron quickly summoned his bottle of Firewhisky and three glasses, pouring each of them a generous measure, ignoring Hermione’s disapproving scowl as he pressed a glass into her hand.
“Shit!” hissed Harry suddenly. Draco stared at him in surprise as Harry swiped his hands roughly through his hair in obvious frustration. “I don’t fucking want to do this!” Draco narrowed his eyes as he processed that, determined not to let the anger sparking in his chest take hold.
Feeling like he seriously should have left with Ron and Hermione, Harry turned to face his old nemesis and held his gaze. After a moment, he held his hand out, an offering. Draco looked at Harry’s outstretched palm and then back up to his eyes, nibbling his bottom lip as he pondered what to do. After what felt like the longest few seconds of Harry’s life, Draco smiled and placed his hand in Harry’s grasp. There was a moment where they both just stood, hands joined, staring, and then Harry turned and stalked towards the Floo, tugging Draco along behind him, deaf to the protests of his prior admirers.
