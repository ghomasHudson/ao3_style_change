“Well, ok, I know you may not feel the same…” A hysterical laugh broke through Draco’s self-depreciation and his head snapped up to see Harry facing the ground, tugging on his hair on frustration.
The wizard at reception smiled brightly, not looking the slightest bit annoyed. Harry straightened up, feeling flustered. He wasn’t comfortable with this kind of public display of affection, especially now as he was supposed to pretend to be something he already was. Draco, however, ever the air of know-how and confidence, took out a sheet of paper with their booking confirmation, but still kept his arm around Harry’s waist.
He sips the hot espresso carefully, grimacing at the bitter taste of it, and Jane laughs again. “I hope it’s strong enough!”
, and the way his hands run through your hair feels entirely too good to stop. His mouth searches for yours again, kissing you deeply, fanning the embers further until they’re a roaring fire inside you. But you don’t care that they might consume you, you’d welcome the wrath of the heavens if it means you’ll get to lie like this with Harry.
Suddenly a cold wind sweeps across your face, you look up at the sky as the first drops of rain start to fall, and then there’s a deafening crash as lightning strikes.
“Obviously,” Draco drawled, but he sounded far more friendly than he had during their school years. “What brings you here, Nevi—?”
Draco snickers. “Well, they were too restraining, I couldn’t spread my legs enough to get into the right position, so I spelled them off while you were busy concentrating on breathing and they broke in the process.”
“Oh, yeah, sure. That sounds lovely,” he muttered, looking down at his plate to avoid having to meet Draco’s eyes or see the knowing looks Ebba and Saga were giving each other.
“I… I took it from the kitchen,” he says, blushing lightly, looking ashamed. “Before I left. I know it’s wrong to —”
Draco came to stand beside him, arms crossed over his chest. It was a double bed, which meant they could well fit together but there would have to be… some proximity, Harry thought, panicking slightly. What if Draco saw his morning erection? What if he accidentally tried to do things to Draco in his sleep? What if
Thomas’ voice snapped Draco back to reality. All the others were staring at him, except for Potter, who was studiously examining the hem of his trousers. “Sorry, what?”
“So sorry about that, my fiancé and I—,” he said with a quick glance at Harry, “Well, I don’t think I need to excuse myself for not being able to keep my hands off him,” he added with a not so subtle wink.
Harry hated everything about Draco in that moment. Every atom in that man’s body was worthless to Harry as far as this investigation went. How could one stand back with the evidence that they had and just let it happen again?
“Now?” Harry asks, giving his cock a tentative stroke and hissing at the realisation that he’s getting dangerously close already. “Can you — oh
This is it, he thinks as Pansy helps him get up. His verdict is here. For some reason he feels strangely calm. He shakes off Pansy’s attempt to support him as he walks into the office. He’s not
“Thank you, really,” she says, hoisting the baby she’s holding higher up on her hip. “Although, I must ask… Forgive me for being frank, but as a thank you, could I perhaps introduce you to my husband’s niece? She’s old enough for marriage and she cooks well. She could really be useful to you, Mr Malfoy.”
Draco is quiet for so long that Harry starts to suspect that he didn’t hear the question, but then he sighs. “I didn’t ask you to stop because… Because I didn’t want you to. I wanted to…” he clears his throat awkwardly. “I wanted… to
you’d have someone fuck you before, and that you just wanted to wait before I did it because… well because you—”
“You wish,” Harry muttered, and it wasn’t until he heard Malfoy’s low chuckle that he realised that was the exact reaction he’d had the last time Malfoy had asked him that.
“Oh yeah? Well, we’ll see about that, now won’t we?” Draco says, hoisting Harry up by the hips so that he’s on all fours.
“Oh, sorry!” Ebba said, laughing. “I forgot to mention you need to keep one hand on top of it. And not go too quickly.”
“But— But—” It’s so strange that those knickers could have this effect on him, Harry can’t even voice how the loss of them makes him feel so bereft.
But it’s difficult keeping the lines between sex and love unblurred when Draco always manages to give Harry exactly what he didn’t even know himself that he needed. It’s getting so hard to tell himself that it’s not love when Draco is the first person Harry thinks about when he wakes up in the mornings, and the last person he wants to talk to before he goes to sleep at night. And it keeps getting increasingly difficult to convince himself it’s not love when all he wants is to keep Draco close, feel his heartbeat underneath his palm, kiss him soft and slow in the morning before he goes to work. But this is what Draco has agreed to, this is all he wants from Harry, and if Harry wants to keep this, he needs to keep his mouth shut and keep Luna and her oddities out of his head.
Harry gives her a grateful smile, but then he has to squeeze his eyes shut at the sound of the coffee grinder. Merlin, he doesn’t even know why he didn’t just skip the café and go straight home. He knows perfectly well how to make his own damn coffee. But then he opens his eyes and sees Draco looking at him, eyes sparkling, and there’s that swooping sensation again in his stomach. He doesn’t know why, but suddenly he’s unable to meet Draco’s gaze, so instead he turns his head towards the counter where Luna is also regarding him, which gives him an eerie feeling, so he returns to Draco. Draco has started talking animatedly with Ginny about brooms and the proper care for them, but Harry knows that Draco’s focus is still entirely on him, can feel it in his body. It’s a dizzying thought.
“Mmm, thanks for the reminder, Sheila,” Malfoy said, and Harry noticed that he received an even filthier look from her. “Would you mind helping me out with the stretching, Potter?” Malfoy continued, turning to Harry. “Make sure I get all the
“I’m sorry if I got a little carried away, it’s just… I find it hard to control myself because you always make it feel so good.” Shit, that wasn’t revealing too much, was it?
“Guuuuh,” Harry groans and throws his head back. “Hey Jane, could you make me something extremely strong, please? Like, on a level that it could kill a horse or something. But legal.”
“Right. I’ll… I guess I’ll be going then.” Potter turns the door handle, and gives Draco a sad smile. “See you around, Draco.”
Malfoy leaned back, looking Harry up and down with a smirk that seemed more assessing now, more on guard.
Harry scrambled up, confused by Neville’s statement, but didn’t have time to ask what he meant by that, because Draco made an impatient noise, crossing his arms across his chest. “So, what
But one look at Draco made Harry realise that he needed to take the initiative now. He leaned closer, murmuring into Draco’s ear. “This thing that you want, does it include a pining fool who can’t take his eyes off you even when you’re behaving like a prick and complaining about how people celebrate the summer solstice?”
“Yes please, Professor Potter,” Draco said, feeling his stomach rumble at the prospect of a Hogwarts’ dinner, “but first I want to see that hole you blew in the wall first.”
Malfoy followed his actions with his gaze, his eyes lighting up. “Right,” he said slowly, with an ominous sweetness to his voice. “I guess you’re right. I’ll make sure to, ah, dress more properly in the future. Wouldn’t want you to get an aneurysm upon seeing my naked chest,” he continued, and Harry realised he’d been staring. Shit. He hastily looked down to his book again, pretending to read.
“Mr Potter,” Goodwin says without actually looking at Harry, but her sharp tone makes him perk up immediately, “would you be so kind as to get ahold of one of the nurses and have them bring Draco something to eat? I believe the kitchens are closed by now, but you seem to be able to get your way around here.” She looks up and her eyes twinkle with suppressed mirth, but Harry obviously misses that because he blushes like an embarrassed school boy.
“Draco,” he whispers, his mouth just between you shoulder blades, the words a caress against your skin. “Draco I’m — I’m going to —” and you feel his thrusts becoming quicker, more frantic, more erratic until he pushes himself deep inside once, twice, three times. Then, with a groan spilling from his lips, you feel him throbbing inside you, the sensation of it overwhelming, and you’re following him in this whirlwind of heat, a silent scream of bliss tearing out of you as you follow him over the edge. Completely spent, you both collapse on the hard surface underneath you.
“Right, as lovely as this has been, I’m afraid I have other things to do,” Draco says and rises from his chair. He sweeps one hand through his hair and Harry has to swallow.
The next day, Harry was downstairs in the kitchen, blissfully alone. He’d spent the remainder of the previous day avoiding Malfoy, something that proved to be virtually impossible since the git showed up everywhere Harry went. Whether Harry was in the living room or the kitchen or out on the patio, Malfoy seemed to know where he was and set on accompanying him there to bug the ever living shit out of Harry. If Harry didn’t know any better, he’d suspect Malfoy had a Marauder’s Map for this house. But today, he’d woken up early and snuck downstairs to eat breakfast in solitude before the others came down.
You pull him closer again, taking it slower this time when you kiss him. He sighs, melting into you, and you start backing towards the bed, pulling him with you.
“I’m glad,” he murmurs, closer now, his breath tickling your ear, and you bite your lip to keep in another gasp threatening to escape out of you. Then, he leans in closer, the tip of his nose pressed just behind your ear, his lips brushing the tendons of your neck, and you feel your body respond immediately, every sensation running through you, collecting below your midriff.
suggestion they take off their shoes while inside the house, to “feel more comfortable”. What an utterly
Sounds of irregular movements in the water broke the silence and made him aware that someone was approaching him. He held his breath but refused to turn around, mostly because he didn’t know how to school his face, depending on who it was. A part of him wished that it was Pansy, because his pent up frustration demanded a let out, and he was itching to give her a proper scolding, telling her what a fucking bitch she was to treat her supposedly best friend like this.
“So, do you think you can do that?” Potter said gently, and Draco nodded, biting his lip. Potter smiled and held out the knife, his fingers brushing Draco’s as he handed it over, and Draco had to fight a gasp at the touch. He didn’t dare look up into Potter’s eyes for fear of exposing himself further, but it didn’t matter, because a voice from the door startled them both.
Harry snorted, glancing at all the people around them who were standing in a circle around a great pole that looked like someone tried to draw the deathly hallows but messed up. It looked more like a triangle on a stick with a circle at each end, covered in greenery, and Harry had to admit it looked a bit like a giant penis had been stuck in the ground. To top it all off, everyone present was repeatedly kicking thin air in front of them in time with the violin and accordion music.
He cups Draco’s head, looking into his shining laughing eyes, and that’s really all the answer he needs, but he can’t help but ask anyway.
You can barely breathe for fear of saying the wrong thing, of pushing him away further, of breaking whatever is still left between you.
“Oh Draco,” he says when he’s finally all the way in, his voice thick with emotion and want. He slides a hand up along your back, then down again to your hip, holding on to you, caressing you. “Can I?”
His hands are numb after the effort of holding himself upright, but despite his fumbling fingers he manages to open the door eventually. Pansy is outside, her face ashen, eyes wide as she stares at him in horror.
Harry leans forward, trying to read upside down. “The Hanahaki Disease?” He’s never heard of it before, but Hermione nods sagely at him, starting to read aloud from the book.
Okay, so where to start? I guess I could say something about my day. But I guess that’s the problem, isn’t it? Every day looks the same. The only change lately is that I started a fitness challenge yesterday with Ron. We’re doing ten push ups, ten squats and ten crunches a day for a week, and then we’ll increase it with ten more every week. So far it’s agony (not to mention extremely boring) and my muscles are aching, but it’s fine, it’s going to get better.
It took a lot of will power for Draco not to say something. Instead, he cast a Disillusionment charm around the two of them before unlocking the door and pulling Harry in with him. Draco ignored the shout that came from the couple and dodged a thrown remote that hit Harry.
“I think we are,” Draco says, giddiness making his voice lighter, more high pitched than usual. He turns his head and his free shoulder to be able to kiss Harry properly, but after a moment he grimaces and turns back. “Ugh, I’m getting a stiff neck.”
wrong. And since he’s never been good at leaving things well enough alone, he needs to find out what it is. He tries to sound casual, but both Ron and Hermione pause in their tasks and turn to him, frowning.
Draco shot back. Looking around the room and thinking about how best to approach this, Draco spotted the fire alarm at the left of the doorway. He shot a Stinging Hex at it.
“Look at you, Harry. So eager. So ready for me,” Draco says as he in quick succession adds a second and then a third finger.
“I know you will,” Harry says, licking his lips. “And also, I— I want to see you. I want to look at you while you fuck me.”
Fuck I’m so horny. Even before this quarantine I was having a bit of a dry spell with women, but it’s like now that I know it’s impossible to get any action, the horniness is getting even worse. I’ve even started to touch myself without noticing. Not touch myself as in
Because as much as he wanted to, and as much as it hurt him, Draco was unable to look away. It had been difficult enough before Ginny came, to keep himself from staring at Potter’s half naked body every damn day, but now, it was like he couldn’t tear his eyes away from the happy couple that he wished he could swap places with one half of. Instead, he started to avoid spending time with the others, only speaking to Pansy on the rare occasions when she wasn’t surrounded by Gryffindors. So he was quite surprised one evening when Ginny suddenly appeared on the doorstep of his and Potter’s room, asking him to come down and join the party they’d just decided to have.
“Something wrong?” Draco asks, and if Harry didn’t know any better he’d think Draco sounds hopeful. “Did you change your mind?”
I’m thinking about learning to play the guitar instead, I’ve always wanted to know how to do that. Maybe it’ll help me attract girls once we’re out of this mess. I mean, sure, I have girls trailing after me all the time, but it’s getting old that they just want to get into my pants because of the whole Defeated the Dark Lord seven years ago. It’d be a nice change if they wanted to get into my pants for my awesome guitar playing skills.
At this point, she’d rather go back to her crowded terrarium and listen to old Medusa wax poetic about her life in Mozambique before she was captured (always pretending to forget that if she’d stayed away from being caught, neither of them would be in this mess to begin with).
“No!” Draco turned back and grabbed Harry by the shoulders. “Not like this. Never like this. Bloody hell, Harry, I can’t do this anymore.” Draco stepped back and glanced sideways.
Draco turned the bottle over in his hands, looking at the pearlescent liquid inside. “So that’s why you’ve been absent these past few weeks.”
!” Harry says when Draco uses his tongue to add pressure, making the pendulum inside him swing back to impatient.
and it would’ve felt just as good. I don’t know how else to explain it, I just know that it felt better than when Hermione has done the same spells on me, and everyone knows how great she is with her spellwork. But when Draco stroked my hand I swear I felt the burn subside even more.
“Well, I guess I’ll be sleeping on the couch now,” Draco said when the initial excitement had died down, and even he could hear the resentment in his voice.
It’s probably a sign of how weak Draco is at this point, but he motions for Pansy and Healer Goodwin to leave, which they do. But even if Pansy is leaving quietly, it doesn’t keep her from giving Potter the filthiest glare Draco has ever seen her use. It’s impressive Potter doesn’t crumble to the floor right then, but then he did defeat the Dark Lord after all.
“Which part? The one where I said he’d be rotting away in Azkaban? I meant that with my whole being.”
I’d had to have done something wrong or stupid for wanting to make his favourite food (not entirely wrong though). So, I told him. I told him how I’ve noticed that I’ve wanted to kiss him for quite some time now, and how I’m pretty positive that I’m not as straight as I thought I was, and that I can’t stop thinking about him because I’m most probably definitely in love with him.
Then, Draco’s motions turn shorter, faster, more irregular, and Harry knows he’s close. He has to look up at him, it’s such a beautiful thing to see Draco come. Because in every sense of the word, Draco is cutting and sharp, precise like a surgeon’s knife. One well chosen line and a perfectly arched eyebrow have made people at various social events crumble, and have had Harry almost offering his condolences for the loss of their dignity. And here, in private, with just the two of them, Draco is equally as deliberate, measured, every move designed to take Harry higher and higher, something that Harry loves. He loves all the ways Draco knows how to touch him to make him go crazy with want, loves how Draco seems to intuitively know what Harry needs, and when he doesn’t know he asks. But he also loves when Draco loses that control, loses himself in giving and taking pleasure, loves when his pupils go wide with lust, when his movements become erratic and he gives in to instinct.
“Cough up flower petals?” Hermione asks, and Rose takes the opportunity of her lack of attention to grab the bib and throw it on the floor.
Harry shakes his head, laughing at them. His stomach is full of butterflies and he wants to rush out after Draco, but he needs to wait for a bit first, to not raise any suspicions. As exciting as this thing they have is, he’s getting tired of it, tired of sneaking around, of hiding what they’re doing, especially from Ron and Hermione. But he’s also not entirely sure
“No, nothing’s wrong,” Malfoy said, taking a swig from his water bottle. “Is that… Is that what you’re wearing?”
“Well, I’ll take that as a sign of your approval. I’m very much relieved, but now I must get ready for my date,” he said, turning towards his room and strutting off.
The fire is already crackling merrily, and Harry is standing in front of it, dragging his tunic over his head and hanging it up on the only available chair in the room. You forget how to breathe. You’ve never seen anything as beautiful as Harry’s body, golden as it’s illuminated by the dancing flames, naked except for the stockings and shoes, which he quickly strips off as well, and your hands remember the sensation of having his skin under your fingertips, how warm and welcoming it felt, and how you never wanted to let him go.
“Fuck, Draco, I’m—” Harry says, tugging Draco’s hair again to to keep him in place while still giving him a moment’s warning, even though he knows Draco enjoys having him come in his mouth.
Harry shook his head and smiled sweetly. “No, no, not at all!” he said, and was pleased to see that this seemed to throw Malfoy off a bit.
“Well, I’m sure this must’ve happened before, and I’m sure there are some records of someone managing to get unstuck. I’ll do my best to look it up,” Pansy says, her tone clipped and leaving no room for argument. “Weasley, you’ll tell all of this to Granger and help her with the research as well. Blaise, you—Well you can make sure these love birds are fed and watered.”
Draco nods darkly. “No surprises there, really, was there? I mean, I’d never be so foolish as to lead myself to believe that the Chosen One would actually want something serious with… with me.”
He gives you a shaky smile, bringing your lips together once more, making your heart beat violently in your chest.
”, and Harry drinks them all in, tries to focus on cataloguing Draco’s movements, the muscles of his back working underneath Harry’s hands as he’s moving inside Harry, his hair falling into Harry’s face, the warm smoothness of his chest against Harry’s, the weight of his body trapping Harry’s cock between them, rubbing it torturously. The air is hot and heavy, the sounds of Draco’s grunts along with the slapping of skin on skin so arousing, and Harry has never felt this good with anyone else, never had this complete trust with anyone, never felt this loved by anyone, even if they haven’t yet got to that point yet where they use that word.
“It’s easy enough to mix them up when they’re dried, but they look quite different when they’re still growing. If you’re unsure, you can always smell them. Here.” You take a pinch of each spice, rubbing them between your fingers. “Rosemary is more woody, she likes to take charge,” you say as you lift your hand to his face for him to sniff, “while thyme is more gentle, lighter, playing in the background,” you continue, lifting your other hand.
“Okay, but are you telling me that if I want to keep fucking you—” Harry says without acknowledging Draco’s words. He’s actually been thinking about it a lot the past few weeks, how much he enjoys being with Draco. Even though they haven’t been together that long they just…
This is what they fought for, he thinks as he looks at Ron and Blaise, arms slung around each other’s shoulders, tears of mirth in their eyes at the joke Blaise just told Ron about their boss and one of their particularly brown nosed coworkers. This is how it was always meant to be, friendships formed over house borders, as well as bloodlines.
it was unwise to get drunk with him. That red-headed buffoon act is a great cover to trick people into trusting him with—”
“Well, as much as I hate to suggest it, I guess the obvious solution is for the two of you to get married,” Ron says.
“Mmm.” You kiss him lightly on his fingertips, still with your eyes closed. You don’t want to wake up, don’t want to return to reality.
As he watched Draco dig into them, Harry was rather proud he didn’t have to say anything to Draco regarding the matter. With a pointed glance from the charcuterie board and rapidly disappearing oyster spread to his partner, he was happy to say he’d reduced Draco to near-Hogwarts-levels of frustration.
Harry looks up at him, sniffling. Even with his eyes red rimmed and his face blotchy he’s breathtakingly beautiful.
He’s not sure she means anything more with that statement. Potter and he weren’t always cautious about where they hooked up when they still used to, but there was also nothing very official about their agreement. No one has asked anything about them or hinted at knowing anything about them though, so he’s always assumed they were lucky enough to pass unnoticed. Which probably says more about their friends’ idiocy than his and Potter’s discretion.
Until you hear footsteps behind you, and you both break apart quickly. You grab the nearest item you can find - a rake - and Harry takes the watering pot and goes to fill it up. When Brother Matthew rounds the corner you’re both well apart from each other, but you feel like anyone looking at you could tell what just happened, could tell by the way you keep glancing over at where Harry’s standing, with butterflies and maggots filling your stomach.
When Harry shoved Draco so forcefully that he lost his balance, she heaved a deep sigh and turned so she wouldn’t have to see the retaliation she knew would come. Usually she would stand on the porch until everyone was out of sight, but this time she went into the house to pour herself a very stiff drink. No one else in the history of mankind had deserved it more than she.
The next day you ask the Prior for permission to go out and collect some hazel for the other monks to bind wicker baskets with, and could you take Harry with you for help? You don’t dare look at Harry to see his reaction, afraid that one of you will let something show, but the Prior doesn’t seem to suspect anything. He wishes you good luck and tells you both to take enough food with you to last the day.
“Now, try not to get into an even more mess than this,” Pansy tells them with a stern face before flouncing out with a still protesting Blaise in tow.
He turns to you, wrapping and unwrapping a stem of grass around his fingers. “I don’t… I don’t regret what we did either.”
“Thank you so much, Mr Malfoy, I do hope it will help. We barely get any sleep now what with the screams.”
You have trouble falling asleep, and when you finally do, you have dreams of him. He’s standing a bit away from you and every time you try to reach him he disappears further and further away.
It takes several seconds for Harry to realise that she’s talking to him, he’s entirely too busy falling into a black hole, and has to shake his head to clear it. “Um, no. No, I just heard someone mention it. In my shop. The other day.”
There was a murmur of disappointment, and then one girl piped up, “But what if we only wanted to know what our families and friends are getting us for Christmas?”
“Yeah, it was,” Draco said, nuzzling into the crook of Harry’s neck. Suddenly he started giggling, his breath tickling Harry.
“Well, whenever you’re feeling better I kind of wanted to return the favour.” He hasn’t decided yet if he wants to suck Draco off too or if he’d rather rim him, he enjoys both activities in equal measure, but he can let Draco decide what he’d prefer. He tries to lean in closer one more time to kiss Draco, but Draco recoils, scrambling up from his kneeling position.
“I… What do you want to know?” you say, ignoring how your name spilling from his lips so casually makes your stomach flip.
As they went through the half lift, the chaturanga and the upward dog, Harry made sure to do every movement as precisely and deliberately  as he could, focusing on stretching his body, breathing loudly with small grunts, and was very pleased that his choice of clothing showed his muscles off. He was also pleased to hear that Malfoy seemed to have trouble with his breathing.
. I mean I’m happy for Draco, of course I am, he deserves to be with someone, and if that someone is as awesome as Astoria, even better.
Potter had apparently also had enough of the pounding music and the throng of sweaty people, and was now casually sauntering up to Draco. Draco’s stomach did a funny swooping motion, and even though he wanted to play it cool, he had to look away.
"Fine, give me my jeans back before you break them." Draco said and I know he didn't mean to say it, but it still upset me. I took them off and threw them at him when he was bending down to pick something off the floor.
"Draco can you help me?" I asked, lifting up my hair so he could zip me up. He walked over and tried to zip me up but couldn't so I decided I might as well go through my entire closet seeing what fit me and what didn't. To say least, by the time we were done there was a large pile by the wall and I was furious.
"You can't just leave and stay away for two whole days without telling anyone. This isn't some kind of place where you can just run around like a child. I thought you were better than this, but I guess not. I will be expecting you in the morning for training." With that he got up and left, leaving with a thick layer of guilt over my heart. I know he was hurt by the things I said and that he cares about me. It was wrong just to up and leave without a word, but I just couldn't stand the thought of someone trying to control me and train me all over again, I just want to be free. I walked up to my room and took a shower, but all I could do was cry, he cared about me and I just threw it away. That night all I could do was lie in bed and think about all the times he had helped me, he saved me from a life of being a slave to a world I was forced into and I just threw it right back into his face. I was a truly evil person.
"I didn't say that, I was just making sure. Look at me Harley," he said, lifting my head up to look him in the eyes, "this is going to be very difficult, but don't think I love you any less because of it." He said, it was the first time he ever said he loved me and it was like a huge weight off my shoulders.
"I know Harry." We continued to talk about mundane things over dinner, but I made plans in my head to go out tomorrow while I was off and get owl things.
"This is where you've been for the past year? New York City? While the entire wizarding world crumbled? We all thought you were dead!" My furrowed in confusion, it sounded like he cared about that last part.
Good god, being pregnant felt like I was on my period constantly! I was so emotional all the time, like one day I broke a glass and started crying for no reason. One of the worst thing was the morning sickness. One day about two weeks into finding out that I was pregnant it struck without warning and not only during the morning, no,but mostly whenever I smell something that makes me even the slightest bit nauseous. We went to the doctor, but she said she couldn't me with the symptoms which made me depressed for the rest of the day, this was hell. Loki and I stopped training almost all together because of my constant state of drowsiness, I'm pretty sure I sleep almost sixteen hours a day. Today I woke up around noon and made lunch for everyone after throwing up as always, this was just my normal routine now. I studied from my book, but stopped after about an hour, we need groceries and Loki had to go back Asgard and Draco didn't know what to get. I walked in the room and saw that Draco was lying on the bed reading, I picked up my pants that had been sitting on the floor of our bedroom for almost a week and put them on, or at least tried to. They stopped at my butt, which did not help, somehow I wiggled them up to my waist and tried to button them, but they wouldn't go! I looked over to see Draco watching me struggle and I just collapsed on the bed, I wouldn't have thought I would start showing this early.
"I know, but I do! They hurt so bad and I like being a B cup, it's nice comes with almost no pain." I walked over and sat back down on the bed and massaging my chest for some sort of relief. I walked into the bathroom to look at myself in the mirror. My stomach was now fully rounded and was more than twice the size it had been to start with.
"Because I can't find it. Are you sure you used one last night?" I asked, suddenly getting very nervous.
"I did and I loved them! I couldn't believe how good you are, and it's nice to see that you don't have any paint on your face today." We laughed a bit and talked about art concepts and some of my pieces and she even put me in contact with an art dealer. This calmed me down a bit, but when I got home I still need two scotches and a make out session before I was ready. Draco and I had gone out two nights before and got a tree along with some lights and ornaments, but not to much. We even got presents for everybody and wrapped them up, putting them underneath the tree like a traditional muggle. Sirius came first, putting his presents under the tree along with ours and I put on some old Christmas vinyl I had bought for the occasion.
"How long have I been gone?' Loki asked, looking me up and down, Asgardian time is different than Earth's. To Loki it may have only been a couple days, but to us it was almost two months.
"Could they come over to my flat for Christmas? I could have a tree and everything, I think it would be fun." Sirius's face lit up once more making me chuckle slightly.
"Well, looks who's talking! You just turned forty one! If anyones practically in the grave, it's you."
"That's a great idea Harry, we could get presents and everything!" Sirius then started rambling about everything we needed and I finished my food before checking my watch.
"She went through her magical inheritance, it changes your body structure sometimes and can give you extra parts."
"Well, you haven't seen me in seven years, I was bound to grow up sometime." I laughed a bit, walking around them and into the living room. "You guys can put your presents under the tree." I said, gesturing to the good sized tree we had set up a day or so ago. Draco was lying in the hammock, rocking back and forth as he stared at the ceiling, he really liked doing that.
"Hey! You have to admit I don't look like it, I'm a silver fox without the grey hair." Sirius said with a flourish making us both laugh harder.
"This is all good and everything, but just wondering, are you two… possibly… on any kind of drugs." Sirius asked, trying to sound casual.
"Okay." I said and went into the room he was pointing at and took a shower scrubbing every inch of my body, I wonder if he knew that highs usually last for at least two hours? Well, at least I didn't smell like weed anymore. Washing my wings was the hardest part, they were huge and I had to clean them slowly and with care. Right before I got out I got the little stub of my joint and made a water bong in the bathtub, restarting my high with ferocity. I was drying off and got an idea, I concentrated as much as I could with a full still going strong and when I looked back up, my wings were gone and there were just two long scars on my back. For about five minutes I called them back and put them away, once I was confident they wouldn't just pop out, I walked out in nothing but a towel. The clothes were on the now clean bed and I was happy to see it was a pair of sweatpants, undergarments, and a dark green v neck shirt. Somehow, they fit perfectly, which was nice and once I was done the man appeared once more.
"Please, he was your savior and now look where we are! Terrified of the dark lord with no hope, you condemned our hope and now we're all going to die! Also, he would never marry your sister, didn't you see how he looked at her, it wasn't with lust but a sisterly love. Would you have married her Weasley?" Ron snapped at that, whipping out his wand and firing off a spell. I don't know what came over me, but I dropped my things and tackled Malfoy, narrowly missing the spell.
"What do you mean extra parts? Is she like a guy and a girl." One of the other guys said, I remember seeing him on TV one time. With an easy I never knew I had, I charmed the shirt so it wouldn't break and took out my wings.
"I-I'm pregnant." I said, never looking up from my bed, I couldn't bare to see the disappointment in his eyes.
When I got back I had set up everything for Hedwig, placing her cage on top of my dresser and her perch on my nightstand closest to the window. I was in the middle of eating a sandwich I had made myself when there was a tapping at the window.
"Yes sir." I was quickly hooked up with a nice one bedroom room and hurried up there, all I wanted was a shower.
"How about I make something?" I asked, after almost fourteen while years of cooking for the Dursleys, I could practically work at a five star restaurant in London.
"Oh, no I'm just a bit shocked by the fact that we we're going to have twins, that's all." He said, I glared at him until he decided to look at me.
When I woke up I got ready and went downstairs to open up and start prep for the day. Once we were all up and ready for the day with pastries in the case, I went upstairs to wake up Draco.
"But I still can't fit into my jeans." I said, looking up from the pillow into Draco's smirking face, god, I hated him when he smirked like that.
"No, I'm not. I never was. That's why I'm here, I'm hiding." I was shocked, but I still pulled a joint out of my pocket and held it out to him.
"What?" Draco and Sirius said at the same time which made them both look up at each other and start laughing.
"I should've thought about your past before yelling, I know you don't like it when people yell at you, I'm sorry, I was just concerned about you. I didn't like it when you ran away, I thought you were never going to come back and so I waited for you every night to come home. When you told me you were staying with a guy I thought of the worst before thinking about you. I'm just happy you're not pregnant or something like that. I know if you were to stay with someone they wouldn't be dangerous or anything." Loki said and by this point I was actually crying, I couldn't believe that anyone other than Draco cared about me, it was nice not be a pawn. Loki's arms wrapped around me as I cried into his chest, there was nothing romantic about this, though it may look like it, Loki was like a father to me and I was like a daughter to him. We stayed like this until I had calmed down and then we went upstairs to watch a movie until I had to go and open up the bakery. It was truly an eventful day, I told Loki however, that if I was going to stay the night again, I would call him or text him so he doesn't think I've been kidnapped or something.
‘Don’t you dare, Potter!’ he warned him. ‘This is a silken shirt and it will be ruined beyond repair if it gets in hot water.’
‘I know,’ she said, ‘I shouldn’t have made that comment earlier, but I don’t understand why you just won’t give it back to Malfoy.’
Harry was wide-eyed in astonishment. Although there where certain muscles that felt a little uncomfortable, the ones in his neck were not amongst them.
Author's Notes: Transferring another FF story. This one was written in 2010, and it broke all my personal records at that time; longest, fastest written and smuttiest. It had the most chapters, most reviews and alerts and it's still my favourite story. Never anticipated that I'd be able to write more than a drabble in English.
'No, that wasn't exactly what we did, as far as I recall, but right now I'm very interested what that second candy was supposed to do.' Draco observed Potter carefully. The Gryffindor tensed and looked everywhere but at him. 'Did it make you horny? Was it a lust potion or something, Potter?' he demanded. Potter shook his head while he flushed with embarrassment.
Harry tried to press his lips together but Malfoy was too close and the wing was still working and his traitorous mouth opened again. 'Yes.'
When he kissed him again he felt moisture on his cheek. It seemed that the uncertainty about how Draco would react, was getting to the boy after all those days.
‘Come on, let’s have a look then,’ Malfoy said, and for the second time that day he offered his hand. Harry took a steadying breath and let his eyes wander over Malfoy’s impeccable outfit for a second. It would be very satisfying to mess it up, but maybe it wasn’t a very smart idea; the two of them in a hot tub. His monster begged to differ, but he ignored it. Malfoy, however, seemed to agree.
Draco considered the eight year boys from Ravenclaw. Michael Corner: had taken up with the Weasley girl again, after she and Potter apparently had broken up. Terry Boot: too skinny to fit the description. Anthony Goldstein: was muscular enough, but his hair was too short. Stephen Cornfoot: he could fit, Draco guessed, but they've always gotten along well, and this boy thought Draco would hexed him if he knew who he was.
There were two more doors, one on his left side, suggesting another room, and one right in front of him, which stood open and gave him a glimpse of the outdoors.
The idea made his skin crawl. The thought of losing those wonderful moments he'd replayed over and over in his head. The moments in which he had felt cherished, loved, even worshipped. From the very start he'd instinctively trusted the boy. Even when the potential candidates had been brought down to only Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors, he hadn't backed out.
But it wasn't worry that was responsible for the lack of salvia in his mouth or the Flobberworm party in his stomach. It was anticipation. He knew he should do something. He should yell, question, or better yet, hex this person.
Draco gasped. Involuntary he lifted his hands and his fingers groped about until they found the heavy fabric of a robe as if to anchor himself. Just when he considered kissing back, the wet lips left his and pressed little, teasing kisses, on the corner of his mouth, over his jawbone, and up to his ear.
Suddenly he remembered the way she had looked sometimes when they’d discussed the issue. Like she knew something about him even he himself didn’t.
‘Oh hush, Potter,’ Malfoy said. He grabbed Harry’s arm and pulled him towards that … thing. ‘You come here asking questions about my massages and my clients, but when I’m about to put my hands on you, you act like a prim Hufflepuff girl.’
He scowled, knowing she was right, but not wanting her to read a word from this letter, if it really was Potter's.
The sound of his first name still echoed in his ear as those skilful hands continued the massage of his shoulders. It rendered him speechless. Harry? Mighty Morgana, what was going on here?
Green eyes, filled with defeat, looked up. 'It was supposed to make me feel honourable.' The only part still shaking were his hands that lay on the jeans covered knees.
Even better, Harry decided, after Malfoy had drawn Harry’s body towards his. The feel of Malfoy's erection pressing against his own was simply amazing, even –
Hysterical laughter almost escaped him. That wasn't something to worry about? Knowing that the same person who assaulted him yesterday stood before him?

Unfortunately, Seamus had heard him and teased: 'Still thinking about your hot date, Harry?' While Ginny burst into tears, Harry escaped the Great Hall before he would answer the Irish boy. 'Potter! Need some distraction again?'
In the window behind the Slytherin, Harry saw his face; a horrifying blue face! While his eyes almost dropped out of his blue head, Malfoy's hand cupped the bulge in his trousers and said huskily: 'It seems you'll need more distraction.'
'You're acting weird again, Potter.' Malfoy didn't move, though, and Harry didn't seem to be able to take his eyes off the fine, blond hairs he saw up close. Just in time he managed to keep his hand from reaching out and touching.
He hugged her briefly and went on with classes. From time to time he felt Granger's eyes upon him. It was obviously that she knew, at least some things.
Hermione watched how Harry's eyes grew wide with horror, after he'd put some kind of candy in his mouth. He looked as if he was ready to bold. She wanted to ask him what was wrong but what came out of her mouth instead was: 'Harry, you're the bravest person I've ever met. If you want me to do your homework for you just ask me!'
The voices surrounding him vanished as though they were a great distance away. Ron’s freckles faded, and the faces of Neville and Seamus blurred together with other ones until his friends where nothing more than a group of faceless people.
He wanted to ask what the hell was happening and who the fuck this person thought he was, thinking they could touch Draco like that. Because, even though it wasn't the attack he'd been expecting ever since he came back to Hogwarts as an eight year student, it was still very unsettling. He hadn't experienced a lot of gentle touches over the last few years. He shuddered unintentionally when he remembered the times he almost hadn't been able to escape the greedy claws of Greyback.
'Potter,' a familiar voice drawled. Malfoy had stepped out of the shadows and stood right before him. Harry tried not to look at the Slytherin's chin or mouth, but the alternative were those silver-grey eyes that watched him intensely. But Harry noticed there was a lack of the usual malice.

'Hey, Harry!' Ginny smiled and tossed her hair over her shoulder. 'Wanna go to the lake this afternoon and have some fun?'
All of a sudden he felt a wave of magic and he yelped when he felt almost all of his clothes slither off his body, leaving him standing in nothing but a pair of black pants.
Their tongues were sliding against each other for what felt like hours and then Harry managed to say: ‘Bed.’
Malfoy sighed in desperation: ‘I meant your clothes, Potter, not the chair.’ He took his wand and cast the spell himself, on Harry, and on the chair.
Malfoy was standing between his legs, and his face was so close Harry could feel his breath on his face, and those silver-grey eyes just looked at him as he put pressure on Harry’s muscles … It was almost the same as his fantasy last night, and it was too much. Some voice in his head screamed that he should end this. Unfortunately, all his thoughts were lost in the pleasurable haze that was the caressing of Malfoy's hands over his chest. He was getting more and more aroused and to his utmost horror a tiny moan left his lips.
‘Just kidding, Potter. Relax, I know what I’m doing,’ Malfoy said, and then he put his hands on Harry for real. They were warm against his cool skin and started treating his neck muscles. It didn’t take long before he did , indeed, relax. He tried to forget that it was Malfoy who gave him a massage, but didn’t succeed, so instead he just put up with it.

He was an eight year, but not a Slytherin. He was bold, yet gentle and romantic. He was honourable, he hadn't taken advantage of him or the situations, and he laughed easily. He ignored the fact that those traits sounded suspiciously Gryffindorish.
'I – I need – ' Even though he never finished his sentence the boy knew exactly what it was he needed. He increased the speed of his mouth.
He decided to wait and see what would happen. He was certain the boy wouldn't force him to do something he didn't like, and to be honest he enjoyed their encounters immensely and was already looking forwards to the next day.
Draco's breath hitched from the erotic gesture. His hands came up and buried themselves in that shock of wild dark hair, which felt so much softer than he'd have thought.
'I knew they'd tasted like heaven on your skin,' he said simply before he kissed him deeply. The taste of chocolate invaded his senses and it reminded him of …
His monster growled and Harry had the sudden urge to jinx those strangers into jelly. Unfortunately his lower body was in disagreement with the creature in his chest. The thought of Malfoy’s long, pale fingers on firm buttocks had caught the attention of his cock, which seemed to be very interested.
When he felt a mouth on his throat his eyes squeezed shut and his head fell back. Unconsciously he let out a low moan, The boy was licking and sucking tenderly, and was surely leaving a mark as he worked his way around the skin. Draco's breath hitched and he moaned again, his hands grabbing for support. His world reduced to just this boy who was leaving another mark, and a third.

Hermione had told him that it was just sixth year all over again, but Harry disagreed. This time he didn't think Malfoy had evil plans and he certainly didn't follow the Slytherin everywhere to see what he was up to, he'd said.
‘So … you thought I would try to save your mother, didn’t you? Or maybe save you from working at a beauty salon?’ Harry asked with a hint of curiosity coloring his voice.

So, it had to be a Slytherin. He just started contemplating the seventh and eighth year Slytherin boys, when he heard something rustle softly nearby.
It was tempting, but Harry managed to control himself. He let Malfoy help him out of the hot tub. Soaking wet he looked at Malfoy, who watched him with vigilance but smirked nonetheless.
The bird left right after Harry took the small parcel from his leg. Despite what had happened after the first candy, Harry was a bit curious. He unfolded the parchment and read:
He stepped up to the front door and knocked. When the door opened, he automatically looked downwards, but to his surprise, he didn’t see the big, hairy feet of an house-elf, but a pair of expensive leather shoes and some neat, black trousers.
'Hufflepuff!' he scolded himself for lacking his usual self-confidence. But his arrogance was merely a sham these days and he knew it. He also knew how people looked at him in these post-war times.
He closed his eyes, not able to meet hers, and wondered, not for the first time, why people thought Pansy was dense. He should have confided in her a week ago, maybe they'd have figured it out sooner. But a voice in the back of his head told him that he probably would have hexed Potter and then he wouldn't have gotten this chance to get to know him.
A cat from a fourth year's  boy was playing with some tinsel. Silver and green Christmas decorations still adorned the room. It reminded Draco of the beautiful antique ornaments his mother used to decorate the living room of the Manor. He tried to swallow the lump in his throat. The Manor,
The high-pitched squeals coming closer from the girls dormitory drew his attention back to the present. Afraid Pansy and Daphne would bother him next; he decided to escape to the empty class room already. Maybe he could take a nap again.
'Do you favour crowds or solitude?' Draco asked his next question. He found himself getting caught up more with wanting to understand this person then trying to solve the riddle of his hidden identity. The boy laughed softly. The sound of it still didn't ring a bell.
That night as he wanked, he imagined it was Harry's hand that squeezed his cock. When he spread the moisture coming from the slit over the head, he imagined it being Harry's tongue. He thought about how Harry had done just that the day before, how he probably had looked at him from between Draco's thighs, his hair the usual mess, his glasses awry, and those vivid green eyes looking at him with passion, while he screamed his name.
The thought of Malfoy and kissing at the same time wasn't nearly as disturbing as it should be, and wasn't that scary by itself?
Draco shook his head and rolled his eyes at that last statement. 'Gryffindors!' he said. He didn't bother asking Potter why he hadn't gone to the Gryffindor tower but decided that this was an opportunity he couldn't pass.
'Hey!' Malfoy responded with an indignant look, but his eyes sparkled. Harry felt something stir in his stomach. Something similar to the first time he saw Hogwarts as an eleven year old. Excitement, a little anxiety, but also the certainty that his live would never be the same from now on.
When Harry didn’t move immediately, Malfoy rolled his eyes and said: ‘Come, I can’t look to see whether you’ve hurt yourself if you won’t sit down.’
Harry let himself fall on the couch, too exhausted to climb the stairs yet, and too intoxicated to Apparate without the risk of splinching himself. ‘I shouldn’t have taken those Firewhiskeys Seamus kept offering,’ he grumbled to the empty room.
‘But …’ he started, ‘… but how did you know Dean would go with her?’ But then he remembered the girl has lost all her relatives in the war during a Death Eater raid. ‘Oh.’ He berated himself for asking and tried to retain his composure. Malfoy was still watching him.
Once again Draco was left standing in the sudden light when the darkness was lifted. This time however he felt a spark of hope that the other would find him again. Leaning back against the books, he gently touched his throat and smiled.
'He what?' exclaimed Pansy astonished. Draco scowled at her because Madam Pince looked up from the tome on her desk with an irritable expression.
He would never tell a soul – not even Pansy – but in hardly a week the boy, Pot – Harry, had captured his heart.
Apparently Malfoy found something, because the next moment he stepped closer so their bodies touched, and crashed their mouths together. Malfoy. Was. Kissing. Him!
‘Well, well, isn’t this a surprise,’ a familiar voice drawled. Harry’s head snapped up and a sharp ache shot through his neck again. His vision blurred for a moment and when he opened his eyes Draco Malfoy was standing before him, looking obviously amused, and maybe a bit curious.
Draco turned towards him. He didn’t seem insulted, like Harry would’ve expected, but he smiled a little. His mouth was swollen and Harry wanted nothing more than to kiss him again. Draco must have sensed it, because his eyes turned a molten silver again. He leaned in and softly pressed his mouth against Harry's lips. But before Harry could deepen the kiss, Draco leaned back and said: ‘No, I don’t. I’ve never invited anyone in here.’
But Draco was having none of that, 'Yes, I'm sure!' he exclaimed. 'I'm as sure as I'm ever going to get. I don't care any more, even if you'd turn out to be Harry Bloody Potter himself, so kiss me.'

They would all tell him to ignore the Gryffindor for the remainder of the year and to forget all about the last ten days. Maybe the would want to Obliviate him to get rid of those memories.
The gentle massaging of his scalp reminded him of Malfoy’s work and his eyes strayed over to the area that was hidden behind the curtain.
When Pansy leaned in, in a very obvious way, he clasped the letter in his hand and gave the owl a piece of toast.
As soon as they got through the door, Harry crashed their bodies together, shoving Malfoy's hips against the door. His mouth hurriedly closed over Malfoy’s.
Draco nearly panicked until the boy leaned in and whispered against the curve of his throat, 'Trust me.'
Honourable. That sounded a lot better. Like a Gryffindor trait actually. He remembered hearing the Sorting Hat about chivalry amongst bravery and boldness. So, like the true Gryffindor he was, he put the red candy in his mouth and went to the bathroom. The other boys were waking up when he re-entered.
‘You’re still trying to save the world, right? Or at least the people you think, need rescuing. That’s actually what I was counting on.’
Even though he'd considered him as an option, he hadn't really believed it could be a possibility. The discovery was overwhelming. He had so many thoughts, so many questions, but instead of expressing them, he did just what he was told and let go.

'Open your mouth,' he told Draco next. After a slight indecision Draco did as he was told. He felt something cold and hard, and automatically closed his lips around a spoon. He moaned when he tasted his favourite ice cream flavour; delicious creamy chocolate ice cream with chopped Maraschino Cherries.
, Draco told himself, while the lips pressed a bit harder against him. However, that action got delayed when he heard that humming noise again. The scent of their mingled breaths flooded his senses and he felt dizzy for a moment. He startled when the lips suddenly left his, the hands fell away, and he heard feet shuffling backwards. Something rustled in the empty corridor and a voice, a bit hoarse, whispered, '
All, with the exception of Hermione who watched the girls with slight exasperation and rolled her eyes.
His tone of voice was slightly inquiring as if he wasn't sure about Draco's reaction. Nonetheless his hands started roaming.
When an unfamiliar owl dropped a little package just beside Harry's plate, the nagging and joking started again. Harry felt so relieved that George hadn't sent his own owl this time, that he just smiled while Seamus said something about a secret admirer. The seventh year girls close by heaved a sigh and told each other how romantic that would be. Only Ginny scowled and stabbed viciously at her scrambled eggs. Harry sighed and focused on the letter that had been tied to the package.
The rose was placed next to his fingers and then he felt another one stroking his throat. When the rose petals touched the three bruises lightly, Draco whimpered. It felt like he was being worshipped, by one rose after another. A fourth, a fifth, a sixth … the sweet flowers surrounded him everywhere.
Malfoy pointed towards the only door Harry hadn’t entered, and they started shuffling in that direction, all the while kissing and touching each other.
Suddenly he was startled by a tapping noise at the window. Recognizing the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes' owl, he hurried out of bed before the other boys would wake up. After all, it was a Saturday.
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
After Harry'd almost fled the Great Hall – really there was no other word – she'd asked Seamus and Dean what had happened. Other than some teasing about Harry having a date, they didn't have a clue.
'What if he hadn't been alone? What if it is only a trick to get you to trust him? He could hex you next time!'
‘Ah, the Chosen One has a taste for contrasts,’ Malfoy said. ‘Surprising, Potter, I would’ve pegged you for a raspberries kind of guy.’ He levitated a respectable wedge of the white chocolate cheesecake onto a saucer and handed it over to Harry. After he had handed out the tea he sat down with his own cake. The chocolate cheesecake too, Harry noticed.

He squeaked when he was suddenly pushed down on the bed. Sprawled on the cool, untidy sheets, his vision still gone, he waited for the other to join him.
But for some unknown reason he didn't. Didn't hex, didn't move, didn't speak a single word. He just waited, and held his breath.
'That wouldn't help, now would it?' Then, more sincerely, Harry added: 'But maybe I could hold you until you stopped shivering and I could kiss you without my tongue being bitten off?'
He was an enigma, a puzzle, in Draco's opinion, and he really wanted to put some pieces together. So, what did he know about the boy?
Malfoy arched an eyebrow and that reminded Harry about his fantasy last night again and … Fuck! He felt his cheeks heat up and wanted nothing more than to get the hell out of this place.
At the end of a long corridor Malfoy opened a door and gestured for Harry to enter. Since he was already in the proverbial snake pit Harry thought ‘why not?’ and stepped inside. Whatever he’d been expecting, this wasn’t it. The room was divided by a wall to wall curtain, which hid the right side of the room. On the left side was a nice sitting area with a fireplace. Instead of lavender, the room was decorated in different shades of creams and ivory. It looked elegant, yet cosy.
He tried to grab the boy and whirled around with waving arms. The thought that he must look ridicules only fuelled his anger.
Draco slipped one hand into the soft hair of the boy as the other started exploring his body, with his tongue. When he felt the boy slither down his body, Draco dropped his hand. His bellybutton was being tongue and there seemed to be a direct connection to his cock, which twitched in anticipation.
The faceless people who went for a massage from Malfoy everyday. The thought was clawing at his insides like a wild animal trying to break out of his cage; after all this time his chest monster had woken up again.
'That's a lot of roses,' he pointed out, wondered is he'd been mistaken about the significance of the numbers.
Draco wondered if the wine would help against the tremors. Because he certainly hadn't required the wine for any other purpose, had he? He took his wand and pulled the cork out. No time for proper airating, he thought, as he filled both glasses to the rim. Although his body temperature was high enough as it was, thanks to the fire, he could use some Dutch courage, he decided. After all, he was already acting more and more out of character and didn't even know what Potter was going to tell him about the candy.

'Oh Harry,' some fifth year girl said and she looked ready to faint, 'you should be on the cover of Witch Weekly every week.'
And why was Harry playing along? As Ron would say: ‘Well, you did your best, mate. You offered him his wand and he refused. Nothing more to it, right?’ And even Hermione wouldn’t understand why he hadn’t left already. But they didn’t have that bloody chest monster, did they? There was also that embarrassing event last night, and even though he totally blamed the Firewhiskey, he doubted that Ron had done the same thing. Or Hermione. He shuddered and felt something claw on the inside. It was clearly a mistake to have headed down that train of thought.
Harry put up his hands in mock surrender and decided to remain silent. At least until he’d finished the cake.
The first Moodwing Harry tested was called 'The Wing that makes you feel blue'. The second one: 'The Wing that makes you feel honourable'.
The first time it happens, what’s most surprising to Harry is that it hasn’t before. Somehow it feels so natural, as if this is what they should’ve done all along instead of fighting each other all the time.
Forty-five excruciating minutes later, when Draco was practically begging Harry to either fuck him or let him come, the quill began recording movement outside their room. They were too wrapped up in each other to notice and Draco’s scream echoed through the hall when Harry finally pushed in, reducing their interaction to solely moans and curses.
'Harry!' Hermione sounded displeased. Ginny said nothing but gave him a hurt look and left Gryffindor Tower. Hermione sighed before she went after her. To avoid looking at both girls he never took his eyes from his breakfast. What by Merlin's beard had come over him? He'd want to upset Ginny. And wasn't he supposed to be extra honourable today of all days? Hurting her feelings like that wasn't very chivalrous, he thought.
'Chocolate Frogs,' he exclaimed breathless. The boy chuckled but didn't answer. Instead he started to remove every trace of the candy from Draco's body.

The feeling that someone was watching him, should have alarmed him; but instead, all Draco felt when he opened his eyes and found that it was pitch-black was relieve. He tried to keep his breathing even while he waited, but the other came nearer and asked softly, 'Did you have a good rest?'
He pushed Harry onto one of the leather covered cushions the device seemed to be made of and pressed gently between Harry’s shoulder blades, until Harry was half laying with his face downwards, staring at the floor through a cushioned ring. He didn’t know what was more disturbing; the way Malfoy talked or his hands touching Harry’s naked skin.
They stared at each other in silence. The tension increased until suddenly the kettle started to whistle. Harry turned around as if he was bitten by something. Draco, however, noticed that his hands were shaking slightly when he poured a cup of tea for each of them. Harry handed him a cup and sat down across Draco. He hadn't put sugar or milk on the table, but Draco wasn't surprised when his tea was exactly like he preferred it.
He took his wand, casted a cleaning charm on himself, and pulled his pants and trousers back up. He wanted to grind his teeth, but that didn’t sit well with his neck. With a sigh, he went to the kitchen.
The boy chuckled, but Draco was too busy chewing the chunks of sinfully rich dark chocolate to respond. He wondered how in name of Merlin's lacy garters the other knew he simply loved this frozen dessert.
'Don't worry, Potter. I'm not going to harm you. I won't even try warming you up. Just want some answers about that candy,' he said flatly and continued to drag the other along.
His fingers tightened in Potter's hair as the Gryffindor murmured against his lips: 'I've wanted to do this for days. Wanted to touch you the way you touched me.'
'Oi, Malfoy! Watch were you're going,' Antony Goldstein complained. Instead of picking a fight, Draco just glared at him and hurried along.
Malfoy went to stand behind him and took Harry’s head surprisingly gently in his hands, before Harry heard him say: ‘Has no one ever told you, size really doesn’t matter?’
'Out of a misguided feeling of responsibility or just Gryffindor foolishness you ate candy from Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes?' he asked rhetorically. Potter glared but Draco lifted his eyebrow and smirked.
'There's only one,' he said apologetically and just to be safe, he put the wing in his mouth only to realise that he had no idea what the effect would be this time.
Harry could almost hear a blond eyebrow crawl upwards. ‘No, yes, well, of course not,’ he denied half-heartedly. ‘I just think you ought to watch out for people who might have an ulterior motive for wanting a massage. Some might even have bad intentions.’
With a little help the boy managed to pull his arms from the sleeves. He was startled however by the next spell.
"The Twelve Days of Christmas" is an English Christmas carol. The song, published in England in 1780 without music as a chant or rhyme, is thought to be French in origin.
A sweet, yet spicy, scent rose to his nose and he inhaled deeply. The fragrance wafted into his nostrils, pleasing him. It reminded him at the few times he'd sneaked to the kitchen in the Manor when the house-elves had been baking cookies. Cinnamon, he thought. Or maybe ginger spice. And cloves? He leaned against the back of the sofa and sighed softly. It was comforting; both the smell and sitting hand in hand in a dark class room.
But then he remembered the things the boy seemed to know about last year, about him, and the way it almost looked as if he was … wooing him through the Christmas song. If he were to be honest with himself, he'd have to admit that he could maybe fall for that boy. So, would he let the chance that it was one of those three ruin the best thing that happened in a long time?
Author's Notes: Transferring another FF story. This one was written in 2010, and it broke all my personal records at that time; longest, fastest written and smuttiest. It had the most chapters, most reviews and alerts and it's still my favourite story. Never anticipated that I'd be able to write more than a drabble in English.
He waited patiently until the boy guided them to the sofa. To his surprise the boy straddled his lap before he kissed him.
‘WHAT?’ Harry blushed when he realized that not only had he drawn the attention of all of his friends, but most of the other customers as well. ‘But … how … why?’
'You seem to trust him, which is rare, so it can't be a Slytherin. He blinded you before kissing you, and left you in the dark about his identity for more than a week, so he is obviously afraid you might not like him, or would even hex him,' she pondered out loud. 'Seeing as you keep it a secret from me, it must be either something embarrassing like a Hufflepuff or something revolutionary like a …' Before she finished her sentence his eyes betrayed him as they glanced over to the Gryffindor table. Potter wasn't seated at his usual spot between Granger and Weasel.
Harry, however, couldn't explain it to them. He didn't want Hermione to start analysing this obsession he'd gotten. And he certainly didn't want to see the look on Ron's face if he told him that he was fascinated by the little white blond hairs he'd seen on Malfoy's once-smooth chin all of a sudden during the Quidditch match last week.
'You'll probably don't believe me when I tell you that I know you very well. In fact I think there aren't many people at Hogwarts who know you the way I do.' The voice sounded calm, yet convincing. Draco wanted to snort but found himself listening intensely when the boy continued. 'I know you didn't want to do those things last year. I know you didn't have much choice with Voldemort holding your family hostage.' Draco's mouth fell open in shock. 'You weren't a killer even though you've made some pretty bad choices. And I think you've paid for most of them. We're probably more alike than you think, although that thought would shock you if you knew my identity.' He sounded sad but went on, 'Most of all, I think everybody deserves a second chance. I watched you, Draco, these last months and I've seen the changes in you, whether you'll admit it or not.' He squeezed his hand again. 'Little by little you won me over without even knowing it. And then one day I saw you flying and the sun gave you a golden halo and I thought you were the most beautiful person I've ever seen.'
‘Are you really working as a masseur in a beauty salon? A Muggle salon?’ He blurted out, and immediately cursed his thoughts for sending him this way. Malfoy looked at him for a moment, a smile ghosted his lips.
'What?' Draco exclaimed, 'Everyone? In all of Hogwarts? Where did you get it? Did you have it all these years while you went to school?' He didn't know if he felt jealous or a little nervous at the thought of being … well, stalked was the right word, wasn't it?
The words kept echoing through Draco's head all morning. After lunch he escaped his fellow Slytherins and went to same class room as yesterday, expecting to be alone for a few hours. To his surprise his vision disappeared the moment he entered. He staggered but was caught by two strong arms.
The sound of the cupboard doors reminded him of the spare hangover potion he kept in his kitchen. Just for occasions like this.
, Draco thought with a stifled moan, when the boy swiped his tongue roughly over the pale pink nub of a nipple. He thumbed the wet surface while licking the other as Draco's hands clenched around the ropes. He suddenly stopped and Draco wanted to scream and curse the boy but the other merely moved over to his legs and started nibbling on his thighs. But it wasn't before long that he moved back and kissed Draco again.
Draco tried to keep his expression blank, but his heart jumped up at the thought of a next time. 'Don't you think he would've hexed me the first time if he'd wanted to?' he asked scowling. 'But if it sets your mind at ease, I'll ask for his intentions the next time he kisses me.'
The boy chuckled lowly. 'Did you like it?' The question turned into a moan, when Draco buried his hands in soft hair and pulled his head back. Draco's nose bumped into a firm chin and he nibbled on it before he leaned in to lick a trail to the boy's collarbone. The hiss it elicited sent awave of energy surging through him. Franticly he began to tug at clothes, cursing the darkness, that prevented him to find the buttons any faster.
'You almost got me, Harry.' When he went down to the common room, Harry was still a bit bewildered. What the hell possessed him to tell them that? Seamus would tease him relentlessly and Ron would kill him if he knew what happened. Or at least throw up.
I can't believe this little story already got so many hits and kudos after just four days! I really appreciate it.
'So you got one experimental candy each day for the last four days. Never at the same time. You don't know when and you only know what they do or for how long when Weasley explains it in a letter.' He ticked off every fact on his fingers while he paced in front of the fire. 'Am I right, so far?'
His stomach protested. Maybe he should've gone to diner with Pansy. However, the thought of celebrating Christmas in the Great Hall amongst Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs wasn't appealing in any given year. Now, with the visible reminders of the war still on every wall, it was enough to lose his appetite completely, just like it had yesterday.
'Potter!' he prompted. 'Tell me what's wrong?' For a brief moment Draco worried that Potter hadn't been a willing participant until he recalled Potter kissing him and moaning and trusting against him. 'Tell me! I'm not moving. Not until you explain.'
Originally beta'd by the lovely spicykittins and Myriam. Any remaining mistakes - from the post-beta fiddling – are mine :)
'No, wait, Draco! You don't understand,' the boy sounded slightly desperate, 'I just didn't want it to end so soon. You're so hot and I've wanted this for so long. Kiss you, hold you, touch you!'
He startled when Ginny and Parvati exclaimed: ‘You’ve got to be kidding! She lost twenty pounds? Which modelling agency?’
Draco remembered how he'd kissed him and had rubbed against him and how guilty he had looked before he'd fled. So the Gryffindor really had been a willing participant, he thought hopefully. But why … he'd even told Draco … Oh Zalazar! Potter had told him, Draco Malfoy, a Slytherin, his nemesis for years, that he was a virgin! And, he'd pleaded not to ask him questions!
The weird thing was that the things, the beings, seemed to slow down, one by one. Almost as if they were frozen, Which was odd considering how hot his body was.
She rolled her eyes. 'Of course not! Go somewhere and read it. We have a free period after the first class, right? We'll talk about it in the common room then.'
The Gryffindor replied with an defensive look upon his face: 'Have to … helped them start … now with Fred gone … and George's been so … and now's he's finally created … had to help.'
Harry wondered why Malfoy wouldn't spell the facial hair away. Was he afraid it would become more abundant and coarser, vain git that he was? Or did he deliberately let it grow? But why? He tried to imagine the Slytherin with a stylish goatee, which would undoubtedly call attention to his lips.
He did what he promised. Draco never saw the b – no, Harry during the rest of the day. He talked to Pansy, who surprisingly told him, just for once, to go for it. Not for the family name, or out of fear, but because he seemed to want it.
Hermione pondered about Harry's strange behaviour yesterday. Not only had he insulted Ginny in a way that seemed more fitting for Ron (even though she liked to think she had a good influence on her boyfriend's manners these days), he had also acted very unusual during breakfast. The way he kept his eyes on his plate like it was a new Divination method and didn't look at anyone.
Draco had to bite his tongue to not tell Potter how he only had eyes for him. He curled his hands into fists, pressing his nails into his palms and tried to focus on the pain rather than Potter’s proximity and sudden interest in him.
Draco snorted at Kingsley and he returned an amused grin. “I cannot fathom how you ended up Minister of Magic, especially with your dislike of politics.”
Harry’s unceremoniously pushed down onto his stomach, grunting a bit as his chest hits the mattress and the air is temporarily knocked out of him.
“Thank you for briefing me, Auror Potter, Unspeakable  Malfoy. This was definitely not what I expected when I woke up this morning, and I think I could have done without the shagging part.”
The room fell quiet and it took a few seconds for Ron’s words to process in Harry’s brain. He snapped his eyes up, looking sharply at Ron, whose ears had gone bright red.
A few months into their partnership, Harry had discovered that Draco was fascinated by Muggle things. Harry especially remembered when Draco had found a corkscrew and Harry had had to save him before he took anyone’s eye out. Now Draco’s whole body had perked up in his eagerness to try this potato peeler thing himself, he was almost dancing on the spot. Or well, by Draco standards that was, anyone other than Harry would probably think that Draco was about to have a seizure by the way he was trembling.
“The only reason I’m not sending you off is because you’ve served our community well, Brother Draco, and also because I don’t have any proof of this alleged subversion. So far, you only have the Lord himself to answer to, and His forgiveness to seek. But rest assured, if I so much as get a whiff of any unseemly behaviour, the punishment will be severe. Have I made myself understood?”
You almost run into a thick tree branch, and you duck to avoid it, but it makes you lose your balance. With a yell you fling your arm out to stay upright, drop the torch in the motion, and watch as it flies in a wide arch, landing with a faint sizzling sound in a puddle.
Dinner is pleasant, it really is. Harry finds himself being able to forget Draco and his own broken heart for a few brief moments, but those thoughts keep coming back to him every time. So after he walks Cho back to her hotel and they say goodbye, and after she gives him a shy smile from under her fringe, he can’t do anything more than kiss her on the cheek, thank her for a lovely evening and say how nice it was to see her again. It wouldn’t be fair to her to lead her on, he thinks when he notices her disappointment. He’s still too hung up on Draco, and even if it wouldn’t lead to anything, and even if it wouldn’t be like cheating, it feels wrong to kiss her.
It was only a few weeks ago that Draco introduced him to rimming, but Harry’s been obsessed ever since. The first time they did it, all he could think was “holy shit, Malfoy is kissing my arse!” but soon he’d lost himself in the sensation of Draco’s warm tongue against that sensitive spot, until all it took was for Draco to stroke his cock in a few lazy pulls and Harry came all over himself. And now he’s taking every opportunity available to bury his face between Draco’s glorious arse cheeks or have Draco eat him out. Harry knows he’s not as good as Draco, yet, but he’s planning on getting there.
You stay quiet, not knowing what to say. You get the feeling that this was some sort of divine intervention, like the last time you ended up in this place. But surely, it must be your own wishful thinking?
Draco looks up at him from across the table with an amused quirk of his mouth, and Harry’s stomach does a little flip. Ginny, who’s sitting in the seat next to Harry’s, pokes him. “Wasn’t it so you could provide your ex-girlfriend with a first class custom-made broom?”
I don’t know what I did wrong but the sourdough bread didn’t come out as nice as I’d thought it would. It was too flat. Draco said it tasted alright though and said that we could try slicing it up thinly and dry it in the oven to make some sort of crackers. And I guess what happened next was a very strange consequence of him trying to make me feel better, but somehow we ended up giving each other hand jobs again.
I was horny and you were away at some charity event or whatever. And she was there. It didn’t mean anything.”
It’s almost violent, the way you kiss him. When you finally let go, you’re not holding back. You catch his bottom lip between your teeth and you grab his hair, running your fingers through the damp strands, angling his head so you can go deeper. He moans, and he seizes you around the waist, pressing your bodies flush together, and you feel what you haven’t dared to see: that he’s already hard, and now his erection slides against yours, making you gasp, making you feel like you’re falling through the skies for eternity.
When Draco comes to, he’s in a hospital bed, between starched sheets and with several monitoring charms beeping around him. It’s easier to breathe, and he’s thankful that the pain has subsided somewhat. Pansy gasps when she notices that he’s awake, and tears slide down her face, clearly following the tracks of ones previously shed.
, but I’ve been sort of… stroking a hand over my stomach or on my neck when I’m bored, or when my brain is occupied.
“Okay, the potion I made should counteract anything they give you.” Draco shuffled through his bag and pulled out a portion of violet liquid. “Drink this.”
“Harry! Are you—” Then Draco began to feel it too, slightly dizzy and his vision blurred. Harry slumped to the floor and Draco kneeled to hold him, “Harry! Harry! Wake up!”
instead of this person that doesn’t want him back. But he knows that that’s something he’ll have to wonder about his whole life, what could’ve been, what he could’ve had, if only. So he forces himself to stay quiet.
“What are the two of you on about?” Harry said, growing more and more irritated. “How did you not see
Harry smiled sweetly and nodded, “Only for you, darling,” and pushed himself close against the man, kissing him.
But it’s not love, not really, Harry has to remind himself when suddenly Luna’s words appear unbidden in his head. It’s not
Draco gasps and makes a whining noise, pushing himself as far in as he can go, and then Harry feels it, feels the pulsating twitching of Draco’s cock deep inside him, feels every vibration along his length. The sensation is entirely new to him, because he knows what an ejaculation feels like in his hand, or on his skin, or between his buttocks, but it’s so much more intense to feel it
Ron’s eyes went wide and he gave Pansy, who was staring at him with a thunderous expression, a panicked look. “Uh…” said Ron, then cleared his throat several times while shrinking into the sofa. “Er… huh… ummm, non-spatter cauldron?”
You nod again, too focused on the irresistible pleasure filling your entire body to be able to speak.
could’ve offered first.” She bumped Potter with her shoulder, laughing at him when he lost his balance.
You’re out in the garden, pretending to weed the crops, but really you’re staring unseeing before you, letting your hands work of their own will. You’re trying to find comfort in the feel of the earth against your skin, the softness of the plants you’re pulling up, like you used to before all of this. It will be better with time, you tell yourself. You just need to let the passing of time take care of your hurt and your guilt and your loss.
In some cases it’s possible to do a procedure where the roots are removed, but it’s highly risky and many patients refuse to go through with it since it more often than not makes the patient forget about the object of their affections. There is also a risk of relapse, and in those cases a new operation is impossible.
Harry’s eyes were wide as he stared at Draco, who began to squirm as the silence lengthened between them again. He looked down at his hands, fingers twisting each other tightly making his skin turn red with the pressure.
“Well, I can neither confirm nor deny that I’ve been confiscating betting pools among the students on when you idiots are going to hook up for months now,” Neville said with a wink, and then he was off, leaving Draco and Harry spluttering.
You stand up so abruptly you almost lose your balance again, because you can’t listen anymore. You can’t stand to hear anymore of this, this
After having had a quick breakfast of what is left of your provisions, you start the hike back to the monastery. You’re walking in silence, your head still spinning with what happened the night before.
Initially, after that first time Draco coughed up a flower, he’s fine. He keeps going to work, he keeps meeting up with his friends and going out to parties, and he and Potter keep hooking up occasionally. He’s even able to explain away that event as some sort of weird bodily malfunction, and soon, on the few occasions he thinks about it, it becomes a funny thing that happened once, his little
feel the same as he. A quickening of his pulse, a shallowness to his breath, a shift in his muscles on the insides of his thighs.
Draco cut himself off, because Harry, who had started to get dressed, had lost his balance while trying to put his underwear on and fallen with a loud thud and a grunt of pain.
Harry knows what that rose is a sign for. Knows that Draco knows what those underwear do to Harry. Knows that they’re, if not the only reason, at least a strong contributor to Harry and Draco finally getting together two months ago. Knows that Draco only uses them for special occasions, which has been at least twice a week since they got together.
“I think Mr Stems is referring to the Muggle word meaning psychiatrist, your Muggle equivalent, Mr Malfoy,” Harry supplied beside him, just as the peacock in Draco’s mental image swung its enormous tail against the manor roof.
“You’re doing so good, Harry, just look at you,” Draco murmurs, his breath ghosting over Harry’s sensitive skin.
“It’s only this way with you.” Harry ditches the plan to take things slow and swiftly works Draco’s trousers open to yank them down. Draco seems to be on the same wavelength because he doesn’t object, he even lifts his hips to help Harry in his task. “I’ve even had a wank today already.”
“I don’t mind,” Potter said with a shrug before bringing his hand up to run through his hair, a gesture so familiar to Draco he’d be able to spot it in the dark. Draco had to avert his gaze to avoid staring at the way Potter’s shirt rode up to expose his treasure trail. “I can take the couch though if you’re that uncomfortable.”
Harry shook his head. “It’s just… would you have believed, six months ago when you were livid about me leaving my “bodily residues” in the bathroom, that we would end up like this?”
Since many of the students were away for the Easter holidays, he and Draco had been with Neville to The Three Broomsticks, intending to have a quick drink of Rosmerta’s mulled mead, but had ended up staying for hours, talking and laughing together. Somewhere on the way back, after dropping Neville off by the greenhouses, they had started talking about Quidditch, and like with everything else, they couldn’t agree on anything, especially not which team was the best. But unlike when they went to school, nowadays these fights felt more… friendly. Like bickering.
, and everyone loved her insight and knowledge on how to best reach your goals. They praised her ability to encourage you to push your body to its limits and beyond, with mental training as well as physical. She had the best record of all the running coaches available in Britain, and that was saying something. But this? Having to endure the sight of two rivals who were behaving like this was some sort of elaborate, aggressive, extended foreplay? She didn’t know how much more she could take of this idiocy.
You walk in the direction that should take you to the Hermit’s hut. You don’t know why, but something about it feels like it’s the place to start. If nothing else, it’s safe from animals, and you can stay the rest of the night there and continue searching for Harry tomorrow.
Pansy had promised, and had been thrilled, had kissed him all over his face so he got lipstick smeared on his cheeks and his nose.
While you clean the cuts and put fresh wrappings on them you tell him about your father, and how he decided two years ago that you should come here to study. You tell him about how you ended up enjoying being out in the gardens instead. You tell him how you started learning about the plants and their medical purposes, and he listens with rapt attention, sucking on his lower lip to keep from flinching when you pour essence of St John’s wort onto his wounds.
You’re still incapable of forming words, so instead you crash your lips together again, his tongue slipping inside your mouth. He moans loudly, his hips bucking frantically and then you feel it, the length of him twitching, his release spilling over his hand and onto your stomach, and this sensation is entirely new to you, it’s shocking and it’s glorious and you want it to last forever, his hand on you, around you. It’s so much smoother now, and there’s less friction now between you and him and it’s better than what can be strictly allowed, and you cry out helplessly as ecstasy fills every part of your body and you come against him, his name spilling from your lips.
He notices that Draco has started undulating his hips in small movements against Harry’s thighs, and his voice is breathy when he says “Turn around.”
“I’m… fine,” he says, the words sounding slurred even to his own ears, and he knows he looks anything but.
“Fine? You just had a meltdown and nearly blew our cover. I wouldn’t say you’re fine,” Draco said, his feelings creeping over the barrier between work and the latent desire he possessed to see Harry taken care of, “And I what if I want to comfort you?” He pressed a hand to Harry’s shoulder and gave him a slight nudge. “You look like shit.”
Walking through the pristine white walls of the hotel had given them a sense of stability. Had they not been chasing down a possible murder suspect, having the exact same set up underground would have normally given the same vibe. But the longer the two of them walked, expecting the end every second—given they were going down an incredibly long hallway—the more unnerving it got.
Harry accepted the gift that Ron handed to him with a smile and a “Happy birthday, mate.” He tore the wrappings off to reveal a set of Wizards Chess. At Harry’s puzzled expression Ron explained. “Well, since you lost your old set I thought I’d give you a new one so we can play again!”
look at me like that. I understand that the mental exertion was more than you can handle at the moment.”
“Pretty sure I already rubbed off on you anyway,” Harry laughed, easily dodging the pillow Draco threw at him. “What.”
The tracking spells only lasted so long, so if Draco had to place the blame on someone it would be the Ministry—but that was another conversation entirely.
Gently, patiently, Draco moves the tiniest bit out to be able to go further in, his hands never stilling in their task to stroke Harry’s thighs to remind him to breathe and to relax. Finally, after what seems like ages, he’s bottoming out, his pubic hairs coarse against Harry’s sensitive skin, and Harry suddenly has the wild thought that if someone had told him, five years ago, that he’d let Draco do this, that he’d
Neville snorted, and Draco rolled his eyes before summoning another dressing gown. This one was black, and it was more comfortable than anything Harry had ever worn in his entire life: he let out a surprised gasp as he slipped it on and the sleeve glided along his arm, and then quickly tried to hide it by clearing his throat. He glanced at Draco, who was watching him with his mouth opened and his eyes slightly widened. He was probably appalled by the way the dressing gown was a little too tight for Harry: it strained across his back and he had to hold it together at the front to keep it closed.
Harry’s not even sure if he’s the one that’s done the watching, he thinks as he takes a sip from his pint of beer, or if it’s Malfoy that has constantly managed to throw himself in the line of Harry’s sight. Either way, it feels magnetic, the constant pull towards him. Only this time, unlike the rest of the night, Harry doesn’t look away, but keeps his gaze, silently daring Malfoy to make a move.
Harry flips her off, but she just snickers at him. “I think you forgot something by the way,” she says, pointing to the counter where Luna is sitting on one of the stools, dangling her feet and chatting away with Jane the barista.
Draco felt sick. The legilimency from their session must have worked after all. That meant...what they’d done was...God...It wasn’t Harry that had wanted him at all. He was such a fool. He’d taken advantage of Harry when he wasn’t in his right mind. He was no better than Alex and his cousin.
I finally summoned up the courage to talk to Draco. I managed to corner him in the kitchen when he was getting lunch, and I flat out asked him what’s wrong. He said nothing’s wrong, which is so not true. I told him that I may be oblivious, but that I’ve noticed that he’s avoiding me and acting strangely. So after some pressure he said he didn’t know why, but he’s feeling nervous around me now. I asked him if it was because of the sex thing, but he said he didn’t think so, because he liked it (I mean, he must be as desperately horny as me during the quarantine so that’s probably why he likes it).
We started watching One Tree Hill. It’s pretty good, there are some hot girls in it. Which isn’t really helping with the horniness, but oh well.
“Well… “ Healer Goodwill glances at Pansy, who nods for her to continue. “It took us some time to revive you after… You were almost gone there, for a while. We had to clear your airways and we’ve given you a potion to help your breathing and oxygen intake.”
. Always on guard, never at peace. You feel yourself slipping, you don’t know what’s right or wrong anymore, you only know that if you keep this up, it will end in disaster.
“Can I?” Potter motions for Draco’s hand lying on his stomach, and when Draco nods he takes it to put between his own hands. They’re warm and a bit calloused from all the work on the brooms, and the contact makes Draco relax back into his pillows again. He’s had those hands all over his body, he thinks, they’ve caressed his back and his thighs, they’ve been wrapped around his cock and opened him up on multiple occasions, but none of it has ever made him feel this vulnerable. This naked.
“Bad news, I’m afraid, Malfoy, they said it was — What are you doing?! Are you going through my stuff?!”
You shake your head. “You,” you whisper. “I want you. I miss you.” The words spill from your lips unplanned, but when you hear them, you know that’s the truth. You could go on beside him, continue being his friend, not doing all the things you want to, if you could only be near him, if he would only talk to you again.
Harry laughed again, and then he caught Draco’s bottom lip between his own. “Yeah you’re right,” he said before kissing Draco again. “Pansy can fucking wait.”
Harry’s never been good with break ups. Even if his first meaningful one, with Ginny, had been amicable enough once they realised they’d grown apart after the war, it had still been straining for him because of all the initial awkwardness. Not to mention all the thoughts about how he’d imagined they could have been, and mourning for what they’d had. And even if this thing with Draco can’t strictly count as a break up, since it wasn’t even a relationship to begin with, it still hurts, and as the days pass Harry realises that maybe he’s come to think of it as one.
Draco huffed. “Yes, he says like he’s not already made me wear this ridiculously warm outfit, and he isn’t now expecting me to run around a giant phallus singing about a virgin riding a carousel.”
“Why, thanks so much for noticing, I’ve started a new skincare routine and I think it’s working wonders. What’s with the funeral flowers anyway?” he says, nodding towards the vase.
“Maybe they’re getting room service,” Draco said. His arm was thrown over Harry’s shoulders and felt as heavy as lead. Even if the heat around them was begging for personal space and his arm felt as heavy as lead, Harry couldn’t help but move closer. “Some couples truly just want to fuck and stay hidden away from the world on their honeymoons.”
When Draco came downstairs after a quick shower to get the sweat and suncream off, the  party was already in full swing in the living room. He immediately noticed Pansy standing huddled together with Luna, Ginny and Granger, and they all kept glancing at him, lowering their voices when he approached them, and then quickly scattered. He desperately tried to catch Pansy’s eye, which she clearly avoided, instead giving him an apologetic smile before she went to sit down on the floor in front of the couch. Luna sat down behind her, bracketing Pansy between her legs, and started to braid her hair. Pansy smiled, closed her eyes and leaned into Luna’s touch. Draco wasn’t comfortable enough to try and ask any of the other girls what was going on, but he was dead sure that there was some sort of scheme being planned without him being informed about it.
“I’d say,” Ebba snickered with a sideways glance at Draco, and now Harry was the one blushing. “I was just wondering if you’d like to accompany Draco and me for a late night walk while Saga cleans up, and I can tell you about the superstitions regarding the midsummer night.”
Neville nodded. “Yes, please. I’m really worried, I haven’t seen him since I let him out for his pre-breakfast pecking, and that was hours ago.”
She grabs her bag and heads for the door, because she’s never been good with feelings or weakness either, has she? She’s just turned the handle when Draco decides to tell her.
Healer Goodwin just inclines her head once, curtly, and turns to leave, but stops in front of the door since someone is blocking it. “I’m sorry, visiting hours are over.”
'The only thing I'll tell you for free, is that I'm a boy and not a Slytherin, but you knew that already, didn't you?'
The Slytherin stuck his chin in the air in a mock-offended manner and Harry's eyes immediately strayed off again.
‘Oh no, Potter. You can’t just leave like that, without telling me everything about the latest gossip about me and my working environment.’ Malfoy snapped his fingers and an old house-elf in a tablecloth appeared in an instant. While Harry tried to unravel Malfoy words – Did that mean he really worked at a beauty salon? – Malfoy gave the elf orders to serve tea in the drawing room.
Harry pondered over the Weasley's Wizard Wheezes' candy he just ate. He didn't actually feel as depressed as he should, but if even Malfoy found he was looking down, then that first Moodwing he took obviously worked.
Draco was trying to determine which Ravenclaw the familiar voice matched when suddenly he smelled the sweet scent of flowers. He sniffed and asked curiously: 'Did you bring roses?'
When he heard Dean and Neville laughing about some joke, the near catastrophe in the dormitory came to mind. Why hadn't he been able to keep his mouth shut? Or at least told them a lie.
Wayne Hopkins dated one of the Patil twins. He didn't know about Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Ernie Macmillan could fit the bill. And Draco had often wanted to hex him. He groaned; Potter, Macmillan, or Finch-Fletchley? He'd rather throw himself off of the Astronomy Tower!
As he rounded a corner he almost fell over someone who was huddled up against the stone wall. A face was lifted and green eyes stared defensively at him.
Leaning on one hand he pressed his lips to Draco's jawbone. Potter touched the faint stubble with the tip of his tongue.
Ever since Potter had rescued him from the fire and later, when he'd saved him and his mother from Azkaban, he had been having these mixed feelings. Resentment, gratitude, shame, attraction. So when Potter finally opened his eyes, looking ready to bolt, Draco suddenly was afraid he'd miss this one and probably only chance. He let his other hand slide upwards to take a hold of Potter's chin. He angled it a little and leaned in. Those big, green eyes did unexpected funny things with his stomach. Suddenly hesitant, he slowly pressed his lips on Potter's and started to trace the lower lip with his tongue. Potter took a shaky breath. His cock started to react again underneath Draco's hand. Rubbing and squeezing soon wasn't enough and he let his arm slip around Potter's waist and pulled him flush against him while he pushed his right leg between Potter's.
It’s so unfair, Harry thinks while Draco needs to pause to cough up new flowers and Harry helps him vanish the mess. The attacks are coming at shorter intervals now, and it’s so unfair that it’s not him that Draco loves, that they’re both stuck here, both heart broken from unrequited love. And even though they’re being so open with each other right now, Harry has to fight the desperate urge to ask Draco if he could’ve done something different, something to make Draco love
Potter tosses on his shirt and gesticulates over his body, as if he’s a child who wants to show he was able to dress himself. “There, all done! You’ll be rid of me now.” His somewhat weary expression turns smug when Draco looks him up and down appreciatively. “See you later?”
I know Draco misses his mum, and I miss my friends of course, but at least I owl them often and set up appointments to go for walks with them when I get too lonesome. It’s a relief that we at least are allowed to be outside to exercise for an hour every day, or I think I would’ve lost my mind entirely. Sure, it feels a bit iffy with the magical track that makes sure you’re apparated home when the hour is up, but I guess some things you just have to put up with. Especially when some people aren’t following the guidelines and try to expand their time spent outside. As if nobody else wants to do that as well.
“But today I’m not going to bore you with the different herbs and spices in their dried state, it’s time to transfer the seedlings I planted in March into the garden,” you say, showing him the tiny green buds sticking up from the soil in the pots.
“Although I have to say, I doubt either of you need to find out who you’ll marry,” Ebba said slyly and hopped down from the rock they were all sitting on. “I’m getting back inside to help Saga take care of the dishes. I’ll see you later!”
Draco wasn’t sure if it was an advantage that he hadn’t had much to drink yet: it made him more alert to what was happening, and possibly prepared for what was to come, but it also made him less relaxed. Potter looked just as uncomfortable where he sat opposite Draco, which made no sense since he was sitting next to his beautiful girlfriend. A girlfriend he was apparently very happy with, even though he’d once tried to—
Draco turned towards Harry to find that he was dizzyingly close to him. He finally looked at Harry to see the earnestness in his eyes. “You could… try it again? See what happens this time?”
“What—?” Harry starts, but Draco props himself up on the bed, reaching out for Harry to take his hand.
Malfoy’s gaze turned harder, more calculating, and Harry suddenly felt like he was becoming the underdog.
“Oh. Well, it’s such a shame, a nice young man like you, living alone with only your friend for company.” She glances out the open door into the garden, where Harry is working, singing quietly to himself.
Out of the corner of your eye you see Matthew nod. “I’ve been hearing — You’ve been calling his name in your sleep since he left.”
“Well. Just so we’re clear in what we’re doing here,” Draco says as he enjoys the view of Potter pulling up his boxers and trousers, the muscles of his back moving deliciously as he does so. Some days he feels like he can never get enough of watching Potter, and he gets the idea that maybe another shag right now wouldn’t go amiss.
Usually it happens on one of their nights out with their friends, with alcohol swirling through their minds, making them eager and reckless, making Draco impatient and rough as he fucks Harry quickly on the couch in his flat or against the sink in one of the loos, barely having time or the presence of mind to put up a silencing charm. But tonight, they have time, and Draco is obviously in an exploring mood. It shows in the way he takes his time to map out Harry’s chest and abdomen with a skilled tongue. It shows when he moves on to Harry’s arse and cock, taking Harry to the edge of delirium with how much he wants this, needs this. And when Draco finally pushes inside him, after nearly having taken him apart, it only takes a few well aimed thrusts for Harry to lose it completely and come, hot and needy and gloriously content, while Draco murmurs soft encouragement into his ear.
Harry crouched down to lift the bedspread and, sure enough, there was what looked like the entire contents of their kitchen cupboard: mucky and dusty plates, cups, and glasses, all spread out. It looked like a dining table after a particularly heavy feast.
don’t know how to act around him. He’s started to come out of his room more, and even if he doesn't really seek me out, now we’re spending more time together again. I’m so afraid I’ll blurt out something really stupid and to avoid that I keep entirely quiet. I know he notices because I’ve seen him glancing at me more and more, looking like he’s trying to read my mind.
He approaches the bed and grabs the visitor’s chair to sit down, the legs of it scraping the floor with an ear-splitting sound as he moves it closer to the bed, and Draco flinches.
“Gibbering curse, Gingivitis, no, H, H is here, let’s see…” she mutters to herself, setting the book down at a safe distance from her daughter’s arms. “Hive-conjuring, Heartburn, here! The Hanahaki Disease!” she says triumphantly, tapping her index finger on the page.
A whimper escapes Harry before he’s able to rein it in, and Draco lets out a self satisfied huff, his breath hot against Harry’s neck as he presses himself even closer, grinding his hips slightly. Harry’s fingers are trembling as he starts unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, the pale skin warm and soft underneath the luxurious fabric. Draco doesn’t do anything to aid him, he just keeps running his hands slowly up and down Harry’s back, sliding them under the waistline of his trousers to squeeze his arse again, making Harry moan embarrassingly loudly. Draco chuckles before pulling Harry’s earlobe into his mouth, and suddenly it’s all too much: the warmth of Draco’s body, his crotch coming into contact with Harry’s, the alluring scent of him filling Harry’s nostrils. All it takes is for Draco’s tongue to tickle the shell of Harry’s ear, and without being able to help it, having been at the edge for so long, Harry comes in his pants like a bloody teenager.
“Well, that’s obvious, isn’t it?” Dean Thomas said. “We have four rooms, and it only makes sense that Seamus and I take one, Ron and Hermione are together in one, and that the lovebirds — sorry, I mean Luna and Pansy, share one.”
Finally, after a month of hiding from the world, Pansy unceremoniously shows up at his workplace and orders him to come over for tea, and now he’s sitting in her living room, stiff as a board, absentmindedly curling his hand into a fist and then opening it up again. His joints have started to feel less flexible lately and from what he’s gathered it’s because roots are spreading through his veins. It’s annoying how they hinder his movements, which makes him even less successful in casting spells since he can’t perform the correct wand gestures. As much as he detests it, he’s had to do some research, mostly to try and find some alleviation, but he’s also been morbidly curious about what’s to come. That was, of course, until he found out what really
He stills, his hands on your waist going stiff, before he pushes you to the side. When you look at him, he keeps his gaze firmly on the water running past you, drawing his knees up to his chin.
Someone was stirring beside him and he froze, turning his head. Draco was sprawled out on the bed, his eyes closed in sleep. Harry bit his lip as his gaze travelled over Draco’s pale skin, from his shoulder, down the curve of his spine to the twin dimples just above his arse, regrettably covered by the sheets.
Potter’s eyes widened and his mouth rounded into a perfectly shaped O. “Whoa. That’s— That was a lot.”
The days go by in a frantic mess, a tornado of desire, of guilt, of Harry’s body so close to yours, of getting to know each intimate part of him. Of a thousand prayers at night to make it stop, of stolen moments in the greenhouse, the library, the different store rooms. Your breath in Harry’s ear begging him to
He hasn’t even mentioned Harry’s name, and yet your body responds immediately. You gulp for air, feeling like you haven’t breathed for a long time, like you’ve forgotten how to. “I do,” you choke out, fighting back the tears that threaten to spill on your cheeks.
Just then, the instructor greeted them all, and Harry took the opportunity, while Malfoy’s attention was on her, to quickly strip off his own sweatpants and shrink them down to hide them under one corner of his yoga mat. When Malfoy turned to Harry again, he looked like he was choking on his own saliva, but he quickly tried to hide it by pretending to cough.
He lifts his head, and the sight that meets him when he looks into the mirror is nothing short of a nightmare. There are large dark circles under his eyes, blood trickles from his lips and his skin seems grey and washed out. He looks a fright. Worse than in sixth year, and that was really a low point in his appearance as well as life in general.
Harry squeezes his eyes shut. “Yes,” he answers, mortified beyond belief, but Draco exhales shakily, pressing himself closer to Harry, his hands resuming their task of running along his back.
“Is it?” Draco says, even though he’s fully aware of it. It feels strange but nice to call Harry by his first name, rounder and softer than the “Potter” he usually still spits out like it’s a kernel or seed he wants to get rid of. “Well I guess it’s never too late to try new things.”
And it’s the truth, he realises. No one can control their feelings, he of all people should know that, or he wouldn’t be in this mess.
He nods gratefully. He dearly hopes that his mother will make it in time before he draws his last breath, but at least he has Pansy here, and that’s comforting enough.
Draco has his book club with Astoria right now and he asked me to stay in my room so I wouldn’t be in the way. I don’t know what he thinks I’ll do, ruin their intellectual conversation by talking about sports?
“Oh, do forgive me, Potter, but if you looked around you and noticed anything else outside of that big head of yours, you’d see that it is, in fact, fairly crowded here.”
Draco doesn’t answer, but his jaw is working silently as he’s staring at Harry, and it looks like he’s reluctantly admitting defeat. Tentatively, Harry starts to nose around Draco’s groin, inhaling the scent of him and kissing the tender skin on the inside of his thighs.
Harry leaned forward, running as fast as he could to catch up with Malfoy, and to his immense satisfaction he reached the top of the hill a mere foot before the git. He only had time to flash Malfoy a smug grin before Ms Allen blew her whistle and he had to turn around to go downhill, Malfoy pressed to his side. The next round, Harry initially thought that he could let Malfoy win this time, but when he saw Malfoy’s arse flexing as he ran, Harry had to run past him again, because it was too damn distracting. The third time, his muscles started to ache slightly from the lactic acid, but he wasn’t about let Malfoy win even one damn round.
“Thanks Blaise!” Harry turned the package in his hands. “Hmmm, it feels like a book. Pretty sure it’s a book.” He unwrapped it. “And it’s a book! It’s— oh.”
Harry blinked and Draco stood still, an odd, agonising yearning pounding against his chest. He wanted to reach out and hold Harry, to comfort him, to make sure he knew that Draco would never let anyone do to him what was being done to the poor victims at the retreat. But it went so much deeper than that for Harry.
You don’t tell him that you’re not sure you’re thankful for that, because you’re not. His presence has woken something in you that you’re afraid to let loose completely. You’re feeling more alive than you have in years, but with that feeling comes the crushing sin, tainting everything. His smile falters, and he seems to guess what your silence means.
“If I remember correctly, you told me we were going to Sweden to study the way they traditionally celebrate summer solstice, for our research into solstice magic.”
“You know where I want your hands,” Harry answers and then finally gets the door lock to click open.
want Astoria. I just know that every time Draco talks about her, or with her, I get super irritated and want to change the subject so as not to be reminded about how awesome she is.
You chuckle again, shaking your head, then you sit down beside him, taking his hand. “And may I ask what your name is, pilgrim?”
