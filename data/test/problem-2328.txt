"The fame thing isn't really real, you know? And don't forget–" Harry licked his lips nervously. "I'm also just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her." He said, his red rimmed eyes adding to the effect.
Harry rolled his eyes, refusing to warrant the response with a reply.
"I already have both," Harry said as he waved the suggestion away. "You'll have to tell me why you don't want to go to l'Intimiste."
Harry was leaden as he fell onto his dining chair. He had lost more than six years—no, he had lost six years and five months, and even when Draco was by his side, his future was slipping by. No wonder Draco had been uncompromising about his request. Draco had been thinking about his family, and his child, while Harry had been thinking about himself.
13 August 1955
Draco stumbled as he landed at the Leaky Cauldron. Scanning the place, he quickly spotted Harry and Ron at a corner, Harry listening distractedly, eyes flitting about the door of the pub and Ron, who was gesturing wildly.
While his future depended on his grades, there was only so much that it could help when the Malfoy name was so utterly ruined. The truth was that the broom had come to be synonymous with his failure in the Room of Requirements and the culmination of his loss of control. His mind healer had told him to view it as an escape, as a source of freedom, but Draco simply couldn’t relinquish the firm comfort of the ground.
"You can't expect to master it in thirty minutes. You need to continue practicing after class."
"Hermione's a week ahead of you for charms," he pointed out helpfully as he read Malfoy's to-do list in his organiser.
notebook and redo his essay. Harry had to resubmit his application to Morten on his behalf post haste. "Harry, do you have my black notebook with you?"

Harry shook his head with a wry laugh. Draco watched him closely, unsure of what Harry now thought about him.
Draco
"I just, erm–" his eyes settled above Malfoy's shoulder instead, "I was just wondering if you were going to erm, follow your dad's instructions and marry a Pureblood witch." Harry said haltingly. He peeked at Malfoy when the other boy huffed in laughter.
He squinted at the squiggles behind his ear. "It says
"Malfoy, you don't want to give us a white Christmas?" He called out from across the room, nearly falling over in laughter when Malfoy only scowled harder at him. He was slightly tipsy already from the alcohol Seamus had purchased from the collected funds, and everything was hilarious to him.
Harry dropped the mirror in his hand with a groan. Knowing his luck, that scenario was more likely than a mundane meeting at a post office.
” he repeated in disbelief, his head tilted upwards in recollection. “I just thought that you were too busy to reply. The accident was all over the papers but I didn’t know that it was so serious.”
whenever he brought up Malfoy, but it was downright mean whenever they started to shut him up before he could even begin. It had to be said that while Harry was always talking about Malfoy, the regarding topics were a lot more varied than what Hermione  and Ron presented them to be.
"Well, that's conflating antagonism and awe with stunted emotions!" He complained as he reached for the trifle himself.
Breath laboured, Draco pressed his forehead against the door of his cupboard, steadying his breath with his softening cock in hand. Merlin, the interaction with Potter had really done him in. Draco couldn't remember the last time his orgasm had been so quick and violent. Registering the absurdity of his situation, Draco waved his come away before casting his day-old clothes to his hamper.
Draco froze, not believing his ears. Composing himself, he turned around to watch Potter running towards him. "Potter," he addressed coolly, hating himself for instinctively lamenting Potter's fresh bun. He preferred it when Potter tucked his loose fringe behind his ear.
"It's a weird gift, isn't it? Though I guess that it seems pretty well made," Harry commented as he pretended to feel the fabric of the socks. "Are you going to wear it?" He asked nervously as he watched Malfoy read the note he had written. Why was Malfoy frowning at it?
Draco felt himself flush at the comment, instead occupying himself by pushing both boxes towards Potter. "Stop being so self sacrificial, Potter, honestly. No one's asking you to save the wizarding world again." He rolled his eyes in disapproval. "Also, the more sweets you have in your life, the less insufferable you'll be. Salazar if you turn into Finch-Fletchley."
"Potter, fuck!" Malfoy scolded as he pressed a hand over his heart. "Where's your manners, you can't just barge in here and–" he lowered his voice into a sharp whisper when Harry shushed him. "–scare people like this! Didn't your mother–" Malfoy paused, flushing with embarrassment.
“No! No, I was just wondering. About what you’ll get up to,” Harry clarified, appalled at how terribly awkward he was being. Watching Draco climbing into his bed was doing his head in.
Malfoy’s shoulders loosened, the wariness in his eyes giving way to amusement as he leaned forward. “That’s what you said last year too,” he said, his smile lopsided as he looked at Harry closely.
Shrugging when Malfoy didn't react, Harry returned to his book, trying to make himself look busy as he thought about Ron and Hermione's arrival, and the presents he had ordered for Malfoy.
Yes the bottle is not non-tamperable.
"At The Quiet? Yeah, recently,"
"They are, indeed," he replied, his heart clenching at the pride on Luna's face.
Draco combed his fingers through his hair in frustration and self-loathing. "Let's walk back together," he offered amicably instead. "You can find your words slowly," he said, waiting for Potter to agree before beginning to walk.
Dear Malfoy
"So, my place or yours tonight?"
Potter's eyes continued to jump about uneasily.
"Sexy," he finished as he finally nuzzled against the fattened cock, pressing a kiss to the underside of it as he sank to his knees, trailing to the leaking tip with his tongue before sucking the engorged head wetly. Conjuring lube wandlessly (having constant sex with a wizard really changed things), Draco reached to fondle Harry's balls, relishing in the breathless moans escaping from his lover.
He pulled his classroom door open gingerly. The coast was clear. He peered around the corner before tapping the bricks hurriedly, throwing himself in, flying down the stairs, and back to his rooms.
5. Smiles adoringly at you while you lecture
"No, you stop it!" Potter yelled as he broke his right hand free from Draco's grasp to jab at his abdomen instead.
I asked Hermione about my clothes and she agreed that they were a little bit tight. I usually get the same size because I'm not very good at shopping. I might have gained muscles without noticing.
Draco grabbed his wrist. “No direct spellwork,” he said sharply, rolling his eyes at the look of embarrassment he received. “Umbrella.” He demonstrated with a flick of his wand as he dropped Harry’s hand belatedly, quickly attempting the similar thunderstorm spell to recover himself. The misery he felt from the rain soaking through his clothes helped clear his mind of his body’s treacherous response to physical contact with Harry.
Calling back the entire team of house elves sent away to the Malfoy properties worldwide for their own safety, Draco had tried to remake the house to the best of his abilities while penning lengthy letters of apology to his schoolmates. However sincere his words were, they were as ineffectual as his efforts in rehabilitating the Manor.
Leaving Hogwarts worried, Draco wondered if Harry would turn up for the interhouse gathering at Three Broomsticks in the evening. He was disappointed that he would only be able to apologise for not being there for Harry's match an entire day later.
"Have you checked it?" Malfoy demanded as he sent a series of spells to the present, ones more complicated than Hermione's.
Malfoy peered at the receipt in shock. "How is this three galleons?" He hummed in gratitude when Harry handed it to him. "Oh–" he said in intrigue when he noticed the note on the top right corner, "it's a reprint of the purchase receipt, which only costs a nominal sum. It's ingenious, really. Ravenclaw? No, definitely Slytherin. But who?" He mumbled to himself as he raised the paper against the light with a frown.
"I might not be able to get into St Mungo's programme,
"Harry could do with a partner so the Prophet doesn't lose their minds. They'll crank up the gossip, and then the letters will come," Hermione looked heavily at Draco as if the Prophet's shoddy reporting was his fault.
"Of course you wouldn't," Harry beamed at Draco.
"Potter!" Draco scrambled like floppy haired for brunette film star's hotel.
Perhaps readers could consider minding their own business instead of reading about strangers' lives over their breakfast.
Harry
"I know. I just—the letters hurt, and I sought them out because they hurt. And for the other nasty ones, I treated them like a case, you know? Why would they get so angry? Why did they get angrier, to what extents would they hurt people? I knew that it was dangerous, but by then—" he trailed off.
"Harry, I'm going to Nox the room if you don't come to bed right now!" Draco threatened emptily as he fell onto his pillows with a huff. It was ridiculous that even after three months of nagging, Harry still refused to buy in to the idea of sleeping in the nude to
"Okay, goodnight darling!" Harry called out from the walk-in wardrobe while the cupboard continued to whirl. His friends had gifted him the set of magical wardrobes when he first moved in, in a jibe at Draco's decision to live in a Muggle neighbourhood regardless of the limits on expansion charms. The furniture had multiple compartments, and Draco would have to spin its knob to access his other clothes. While Draco had appreciated his gift deeply, the configurations seemed to stump his significant other.
"A little bit darker, please," Teddy said as he coloured his own hair for visual reference.
"And I was really shocked, because I've never, you know, bisexual stuff, and then I realised that I've actually liked you for a long while. And I was really afraid because you know, bisexual stuff? And you know, you're you. As in–" he rushed to explain frantically. "We've been friends for a bit now, and I know that you want to redeem the Malfoy name, and you want to do it right, and the lies about you using me gets to you and it made me upset because I'm so selfish and I want you so much, and I would want you even if it made you unhappy about the news, and I just got very sad," Potter said as he wiped the tears in his eyes.
"Wait. Here's good," Draco announced when the distance seemed close to what his mother typically preferred when they visited. Looking around, he reached into his blazer with a Muggle coin in hand while subtly transfiguring it into a picnic mat. Pretending to pull it out of his garment, Draco tried his best to ignore how close Potter was standing.
The muscle in Malfoy's cheek jumped in amusement as he waved his satchel away. Harry smiled to himself. The years of Malfoy-watching had been unbelievably handy as he tried to decipher the gestures of a waifish Malfoy. He wondered if he could ever make Malfoy happier, or at least, comfortable around him.
Harry craned his neck to read the signboard. “Serendipity?” he said incredulously. With his wallet almost emptied, he had suggested a quick break before continuing their shopping trip, and Teddy had led him to the end of Horizontal Alley. Even the name of the recommended shop was pretentious.
Harry set the water down with a sigh. “We’re still on this topic?”
“Draco and you?” Ron questioned, released a sharp bark of laughter when he realised the implied meaning. “I did not need to know that!”
"Handy spell. I'll have to learn that one one day."
Slicing a bit with his fork, he moaned at the first bite. "So good,
"Alright, I'll trade you for the planning and booking then," Draco offered brightly as he leaned forward in challenge. The Magical Borders Restriction Authority was notorious for their bureaucracy and it was always a pain to apply for personal portkeys. He had always handed off the process for their trips to Andromeda due to the Malfoy family's records from the second war. Honestly, it really was unnecessarily cruel, but he simply couldn't pass up an opportunity to mess with Potter.
Harry grinned shamelessly as he watched Malfoy head for his own bed. He had managed to negotiate for twice weekly Potions lessons during lunch, and their day had ended with a dinner and Harry's first remedial lesson.
Draco returned his attention to his table when the server returned with his crème brûlée and nothing for Mr "sweets are for kids". Thanking the server, Draco felt his mood recover as he marvelled the plate before him.
"Well, don't get snippy when you’re the one with communication issues," Draco shot back as he crossed his arms. "What do you want me for, Potter," he asked curtly, his posh accent in full force.
Even though it was clear that Robards was skeptical of WEEP's efficacy, Draco was grateful that the man had assigned Harry as his counterpart. The clout Harry yielded had been helpful in getting people to talk to him. Beginning with the poor layout of the office, Draco's report had continued with the induction of new Aurors on the administrative aspects, the unwieldy forms, and the filing process of reports. Despite having sat in the Aurors for more than a week, Draco was still finding areas of improvement—or WEEPables, as Fawley liked to call it—daily.
"Alright," Harry laughed, smiling when he noticed Malfoy looking at him in the dim illumination of the moon. Harry went to sleep contented, giddy with amusement and gratitude towards Malfoy.
In the chilly air, he was suddenly aware of the possibilities available even though he was going to act on them. The night had been exciting enough, but just the feeling of it was heady.
Draco shifted in his seat, discomforted by the progress of Potter's rant. He had anticipated an over the top apology from Potter, but he had clearly underestimated the influence of Potter's Hufflepuff earnestness. Nonetheless, with the grand gesture done, the reconciliation completed, Potter's inane apology suffered through, it was now time for the resumption of normal relations.
"It's not too bad though," Hermione suddenly said quietly.
"Bloody hell, Hermione," Ron laughed, eyes watering as he tried to clear the morsel that had went into the wrong tube. Harry grinned at his friends, thankful for the ridiculousness in their lives.
"Oh, now you're the expert in efficiency," Draco teased. He had finally turned in his two-and-a-half page report (exceeding the limit of two pages, Fawley had hemmed and hawed during its approval) after a fortnight of auditing. He had been thoroughly congratulated by his friends, and was already feeling vaguely tipsy.
"Whatever you're having would be fine."
"Are you in trouble?" Harry moved sharply in his seat, the sudden movement of his hand tearing the flimsy page of his Muggle motorcycling hobby magazine.
Draco flinched suddenly as he came to another realisation. What if Potter noticed the physical similarities between his neighbor and himself, and he accurately traced Draco's sexual preference? Draco was distinctly familiar with the doggedness and uncanny intuition of Potter. The fool could be more persistent than a kneazle with a feather when he set his mind to it, and he would always somehow uncover the truth.
It was much later when they apparated to Parc du Champ de Mars with their desserts to go. Between petty squabbles, stories about Teddy and their respective careers, dinner had been an unintentionally drawn out affair. When Draco had finally noted the time, he had suggested they skip desserts to visit the Eiffel Tower. Remembering that they had arranged to return in November with Teddy and Family during the off season of Quidditch, Harry had suggested to postpone the visit. Feeling guilty, Draco had proposed to visit the lawn before the Eiffel Tower to watch the light show in compensation.
The girls looked immediately devastated at the thought of upsetting their saviour. "We just wanted to cheer him up!" Vinegar girl suddenly burst out in defence.
"Bloody hell. This really is just like sixth year!" Harry exclaimed as he threw his hands up.
Harry chuckled at the image of an irate Malfoy. "How does he still have the time to be mad about my existence?" Harry sighed as he returned to look at the television.
. anyhow, I also resolve to play more with young Teddy throughout the year, and lastly, to expand my social circle." He continued resolutely, ignoring the anger expressed against the injustice on his behalf.
"It's sexier if you don't. I'll spend the whole night thinking about how deviant you are. Deviant and sexy! Emphasis on the sexy!" Harry quickly backtracked when Draco's mouth fell open in disbelief.
"Thanks. You could do your hair, too. Keep it down or something," Draco said, eyeing Harry's fringe that had escaped his messy low bun. He returned the mirror back to a roll of parchment.
He wasn't only afraid of being on display before the whole school, but also feared the review of his character. The Sorting Hat would be able to see through his engineered defences and weigh his upbringing against the changes he had tried to embark since the trials.
"Feelings!" Draco scoffed while Ron said in affrontment, "
"Potter, I'll be coming for you if you even breathe wrong around Draco," Pansy threatened.
Draco watched as the surprise on his mother's face slowly shifted to thoughtfulness.
Harry shrugged. "There's a whole menu of French food to choose from. Happy can't have cooked a whole cookbook on the single day that I wasn't around."
By contrast, the Chinese God of Love and Marriage, Yuexia Laoren, or Yuelao, is a wise old man from the Tang Dynasty. He is usually depicted with a book and a cloth bag for his red strings. Because the older generation is less receptive to change, our folding manual has stayed the same since the Tang Dynasty, made with thin yellow paper.
"Any drinks?" Draco asked, focusing intensely on the slip of paper before him.
“I think so. Maybe they were embarrassed about this. I mean it’s a little weird. Who cares about someone else’s sleep?” He shrugged as he flicked the note out of his hand carelessly.
Goyle beamed at him. “You better not forget about Serendipity again, Harry.”
Many things to do tonight; please prepare accordingly. Have also taken the liberty to inform Bainbridge & Daughters that we'll be going down tomorrow. They will be preparing their assessment and recommendation for your public image.
"Erm," Potter's index finger darted between Draco and the door belonging to Draco's Muggle one night stand before scratching his sideburns where a short curl had escaped his messy topknot. Potter continued to gape uselessly at him.
Genuine and sincere
Harry grinned at Malfoy as he nodded hastily, smile widening at the dirty look that he received.
"Of course. As long as you don't cheat in any way or form."
"How many presents are you buying?"
- Travel overseas more (switched to curse breaking)
Harry groaned loudly, "A date!
Nonetheless, Draco had prepared accordingly. He produced his list, before clearing his throat lightly. "Firstly, to maintain my top in class ranking for Potions, History of Magic, and Transfiguration until I graduate," he recited, grinning as he looked straight at Hermione.
My mind-healer says that I should hang out with you more often because I am happier and more excited. I'll be bringing Teddy to Thorpe Park on Sunday and it has the fastest Muggle rollercoaster in the UK. It is an amusement park where Muggles visit to scare themselves and get their adrenaline going. Would you like to join us? Teddy is incredibly excited and I would be very happy if you could join us. I'll apologise in advance for it being a Sunday. Unlike you, we're both layabouts :(
Harry hummed from his lazy sprawl on his bed. "Maybe it's a love letter. About your hair. Maybe," he mumbled as he tucked a hand under the warmth of his comforter. Had he been less sleepy, he would have seen Draco gaping at him, face flushed pink with pleasure. But alas, it was past the usual time that they slept, and Harry’s vision was already fuzzy from fatigue. His bed smelled minty, and it was so soft. He could melt in it, maybe. Harry pulled his legs up in foetal position.
"Indeed," Harry agreed as he thought about what he had been subjected to the day before, "let's go."
Potter gaped at him. "Oh. Alright. Thank you."
"No, you cannot," Teddy said curtly. Stepping backwards to inspect the tree with a solemn nod, he picked up a length of tinsel on the floor.
"Secondly, to also beat Harry in a Seeker's Match before I graduate," he stated, rolling his eyes at Harry's incredulous scoff.
"I'll need a life-saving boyfriend like you in future," he joked, making a sharp noise in his throat when he saw his present.
!" It suddenly proclaimed, and Draco quickly scrambled to his feet in shock.
"Well, obviously they wouldn't be when you're bloody staring," he said impatiently. "Come on, there's still the café that I got the rainbow cakes from."
Harry shook his head adamantly as he shrunk the boxes to a more manageable size. “Seven cakes only. I haven't been obsessed for twenty years,” he said.
Draco didn't know how to respond without embarrassing himself. He had been so caught up with his concepts of propriety and worried about his image, and these concerns had spilled over while he tried to fulfill his quota. He had wanted to do it right, to bind people who were "compatible" in the eyes of society, but didn't the old adage go that love was blind?
"You can make Harry pay for everything!" Ginny suggested. Draco looked at her blandly. He was a
“This is so good,” Harry said with a sigh, looking at Goyle in a new light. “The contrasting textures and the balance of flavours,” he shook his head appreciatively.
"And for agreeing to teach me Potions," he tacked on as he turned around to face Malfoy's bed.
Harry persisted stubbornly. "Just wondering. You seemed a bit worried when you got your name."
“You’re not. There’s always new memories to be made,” Malfoy said with heavy reluctance. He looked away as he removed his hand.
"Yes, your exchange present," Malfoy huffed.
8. Do not accept gifts in any forms
Luna hummed in consideration, her fingers entwined between Ginny's. "It's a good present, Harry."
Potter engaged Draco's lips in another quick, soft kiss as he tucked Draco's fringe behind his ear. They continued to stare at each other, smiles on their faces as they caught their breaths.
Dinner was a solemn affair, though Teddy was entirely unbothered while his cousin glared at his godfather. It was only the next day that Draco would forgive Harry for teaching Teddy how to expend his energy through his Metamorphmagus abilities.
"I feel like I spent my time mediating between Ron and Hermione, and thinking about surviving when I was in Gryffindor," Potter suddenly commented.
The afternoon was the beginning of a relationship, twelve years late.
"Don't you Slytherins do more exciting stuff back in your common room? Hatching plots or whatever?"
“Bloody hell, Malfoy!” Harry yelled, trying to look up the counterspell as he ran.
Draco rolled his eyes at how dumb and hopeful Potter looked with his gift in his hands. "Are you ever going to open it?" Draco asked fell into the space beside the Chosen One.
Draco nodded, pushing his damp fringe backwards as he dabbed the beads of sweat at his hairline. "I finally got some pink pearls," he explained, decanting a serving to a vial. The last few trials with Harry had been short of disappointments, and his looks had not been enhanced at all.
5. Praise Draco
A smile spread across Harry's face slowly. "Why should I when I have you?"
"Fine, Andy, gardening, Teddy metamorphmagus..." the Chosen One leaned over he glanced through Draco's letter. “There's nothing much that your mom needs to do to impress Teddy, you know?" Potter tapped at Draco's last sentence. "He's still a wee baby with diapers and too much drool."
Without being in perpetual mortal peril, Harry had found himself better able to appreciate Hogwarts in its training for him to be better wizard. It was something he had never considered previously, more invested in knowledge that would ensure his survivability. Most importantly, he had also enjoyed the opportunities to mingle with his classmates, learning with and
"I'm getting better at coordination, aren't I?" Harry said, his chest puffed out with pride.
favourite shop—which explained Malfoy’s unplanned presence in Horizontal Alley. But the sudden combination of the apron, and their apparent familiarity was too much for him. Why didn’t his past self think about this and follow Serendipity on
5. think about what to do in life
(See the end of the chapter for
"Alright," Draco acquiesced with amusement as he waved the lights off. Pressing himself close, he regulated his breath with Harry's. The warm, strong weight of his lover in his arms left him with an indescribable contentment. Their relationship in the past three months between their first kiss in Paris and now had been hectic, to put it lightly. He was glad that they had made it through the media fury, conflicting schedules and most importantly, incredulous and insufferable friends. Harry had shared about wanting to know him better after hearing stories from Hermione (was Hermione matchmaking when she mentioned him to Harry and vice versa? Was he reading too much into it?), and he had talked about his growing attraction to Draco through their interactions in his usual disarming honesty that left Draco uncomfortable, embarrassed but unquantifiably happy.
Draco pressed the bottom half of their bodies close, their legs tangling together. A helpless noise between a moan and a sigh fell from Draco's lips when he accidentally rubbed their cocks against each other.
Harry's brows shot up in greeting as Draco stepped out of the Floo.
Harry ducked his head in embarrassment at Draco's impatient scoff.
"Ronald," Hermione warned without looking up from the study notes she was making for the next month's Transfiguration curriculum.
"I can't imagine Ron and Hermione shagging under the same roof as Mother," Draco said darkly as they continued to walk again.
“Are we doing this again?” He whispered when his shirt was pushed up. He shifted as it was pulled off, moaning when Draco pressed soft kisses against his neck while his hands continued to run across the planes of his back. He cock was throbbing, and it felt so good. Harry rutted against Draco lightly, breathless at the familiar sensation of the hard press of Malfoy's length against him.
"Didn't you tell him not to have so many cookies?" Draco crossed his arms as he turned to look at Harry with a frown.
“It’s always nice to be validated,” Draco commented casually as he reached for a cup of chocolate mousse, “what did Ron give you?”
Harry blinked at him in surprise. A smile spread across his face when Draco glared at him challengingly, as if daring him to argue.
“Erm, are you going to cut your hair over the holidays?” Harry asked nervously when he noticed Draco’s fringe falling across his face.
Harry rubbed the salve into his left leg as Narcissa huffed in amusement at the protagonist on screen. Harry bit the insides of his lips as he worked at the knot up his left calf. After injuries from chases during his Auror days, his Achilles tendon had never been quite the same. Following the recent explosion, the Healers had insisted on "natural healing" to force his sinews to stitch themselves back slowly. Mostly unassisted apart from diluted potions, it was a treatment
"Would you really? You've turned into a proper pacifist these days, honestly." Blaise smirked as he ambled in. "Making the world better, reading about prehistoric Potters, staring adoringly at Potter..." he trailed off, wriggling his brows as he settled on the opposite row of seats.
"Yeah, sure. Anything that you're having," Potter replied quickly, dropping his menu loudly before giving Draco an apologetic look for the apparently unintentional gesture.
"Proper developments to the organs harvesting case. Want to join?" Ron asked Draco as he read the note over Harry's shoulder. He has trailed along on a case once to follow through the entire process.
Harry keened at the unexpected curling pleasure that shot through him when Draco brushed his hand across his concealed soulmark. "Did you feel that?" He questioned as he grabbed Draco's wrist.
"Let's go together," Harry said when the gift emanated a green glow of safety. Summoning his toiletries quickly, he pretended to miss the flush on Malfoy's cheeks.
"Oi, watch it, will you?" Harry yelled as he flailed around to avoid being groped.
, Harry tripped over his feet to get moving.
The Prophet has always treated the media-shy Saviour of the Wizarding World as a spectacle for quick galleons, and to be considered for an interview spoke of the Junior Auror's desperation. As a friend, I was glad to see him. As a reporter, I was ashamed.
Harry
“I’ll kill you if you dump me,” Draco said non-sequitur, breaking the silence as he rubbed Harry’s soulmark forcefully.
“Okay,” Draco whispered as his eyes swept across Harry’s face and rested for a moment on Harry’s lips.
"Are you okay?" Potter asked.
That's what they're contractually bound to say!" He threw up his hand in frustration. "Oh I'm so curious, it's killing me. All this privacy business," he shook his head in frustration.
An amused smile crossed her lips as she lifted his leg to tip him onto his back once more. "Draco never forgets," she laughed at Harry's incredulous expression. "Apparently the Prophet misses you, and he had complains about that."
"I'm going for a shower," Draco said as he dumped their clothes into their hamper. "I need to look good while committing murder," he mumbled, items in hand as he headed for the door. "Are you coming?"
, right?" Draco asked, his face determinedly blank.
"Apparently not, unless you're the one jingling it," Zabini commented, taking advantage of Malfoy's affrontment to tug at the strings violently. The both of them collapsed into a tussle as Malfoy lunged for Zabini.
Potter winced when he noticed that they were using last names once more.
Draco rolled his eyes as he pulled his hand away. “Save it Potter. You’re a saviour past his prime,” he said as he reached for the mashed potatoes. “Imagine not being able to memorise Golpalott’s Three Laws.”
Neither catching up with his notes-making for Transfiguration nor studying for Potions appealed to him. Biting the inside of his mouth, he slumped in his chair as he peeked at Malfoy who was frowning while reading a book about Ancient Runes. He returned to inspect his list. He couldn't start Potions without Malfoy's help, but he was also too hungry to sit through a month's worth of notes-making without food in his belly.
"Lunch will be served in an hour. You can have a rest and wash up in your room. I'll call you when it's ready."
When Draco finally pulled away after his emotional outburst, his nose was red. He sulked as Harry wiped the vestiges of his emotional outburst away. "Why didn't you tell me?" he asked petulantly as he crossed his arms.
Harry hopped off the stool with a grin. Draco pulled him out of the laboratory.
be tampered with, and is non-replicable. Filch has a validator to determine its authenticity, so
. He wanted to be timid, to be small and unknown. He didn't want to be injured.
“He doesn’t know, Weasley. Only I do.”
The manual printed on unnaturally white paper appeared beside his pillow in the eighth year dormitory on an unusually cold morning. Set atop it was a hemp bag that clinked brightly when Draco jostled it.
"Malfoy, Jesus! You scared me, fuck!" Potter swore as he inspected their surroundings, quickly concealing his wand.
Harry felt faint as a blush crept over Draco’s cheeks. It was a combination of multiple factors–Draco in the Christmas pyjamas he had got him, his unexpected shyness, the appreciation of his gift, the woodsy notes of Draco’s toiletries; his presence up close. His heart was racing, and his stomach was fluttering.
Draco had been grateful for their presence when he had settled into Hampstead. It had taken him a while to orient himself and assimilate into Muggle culture, but he had eventually managed.
Draco combed his fringe back in frustration. If only he wasn't so desperate to see Potter's dick, he thought moodily as he selected the blandest outfit to go under his healer robes, in reflection of the clusterfuck of the day. If only he wasn't so turned on by calendar Potter. He then wouldn't have found himself in the house of Potter's neighbour, successfully avoiding being exposed by Potter for having this
charm.
"Merlin, I'm a proper Gryffindor, alright? I would never!"
"Look, nobody's talking in there," Harry insisted as he pointed at the two people sitting on the benches.
Dear Harry
"No wonder Hermione was so insistent on putting that full frontal photograph for that edition. She probably knew that you were the one purchasing it." Draco hummed in agreement. It was unfortunate that his life was now populated by numerous Gryffindors with no sense of privacy. How did Hermione manage to not bring it up to him? Draco refused to think about everything that he might have missed.
“Been a long while. I thought that you had found a new patisserie,” he said jokingly as Teddy set a tray laden with tiny, colourful pastries on the table.
Draco rolled his eyes as he took it in his. "Pleasure doing business with you."
"Is this a Wheeze?" Potter asked as he scrutinised the velvet box before casting a series of detection spells on it with a frown.

"Well, I mean, I could have been," Potter insisted stubbornly.
"Like I said,
Malfoy was smirking as he walked towards him. "Hogwarts too, huh?" He said in lieu of a greeting.
"Oh, the seat is taken?" Harry asked as he pretended to look around.
"Fine. I'll know about it soon anyway." He waved for Draco to continue packing. "Save some of that sixth year sentiments for later, will you? Hate sex would be fun."
"What do your potions do?" he demanded.
Expected outcome: Harry explains why + why he likes coffee
- Quidditch overseas??
"No, Charlotte, I am unable to do so. Though I'm sure that practising on your own would be more effective than having me around." Harry had not used his sarcasm as much as he did before he had started teaching. He had learnt to identify and discourage any of the students' crushes only after two months into his post, and by then, most of the students were already too stubborn to pick up the thinly veiled hints.
"Go wash the equipment, Potter," Malfoy ordered impatiently. "You're an absolute nightmare today," he complained.
"Apparently hair ties disappear all the time," he laughed as he gestured at the mass of accessories on his bed. "They obviously don't know how fastidious I am."
“I’m not—” Harry exhaled heavily, “I just want to talk about it. It’s hard to talk back and forth over email, or get you to talk to me at all. You’d either fob me off to some intern or avoid me.” He felt vindicated by the flash of guilt on Malfoy’s face.
"Draco," Goyle called, nodding at Parkinson, "stop flirting. You're being tasked."
," Ron gasped, red in the face as he tried to work through his coughs, pumpkin juice entering the wrong pipe when he had laughed at Hermione's rant. "Save us again," he managed in between tight coughs, more occupied with making fun of Harry than saving his own life.
Teddy raised an amused brow at him as he held the door open for a young couple. “It’s your favourite shop, I promise.”
"I would thank you, but did you really have to bring it up again?"
“Please,” Draco begged as he thrust his swollen cock against Harry’s hip. Harry took mercy on him as he enveloped Draco’s cock with his slick hand. The warm and familiar wetness broke Draco from his fog, and he began to thrust furiously. He pressed his face against Harry’s shoulder as he circled his arm around Harry’s neck.
Draco rolled his sleeves higher along his arm, sighing when he felt Potter's eyes following his movement. "Yes, I know that the colour doesn't favour me," he rolled his eyes. "It's like wrapping myself up with thirty Hufflepuff ties at once, but it’s the mandatory attire for the sharing session, you know?" He pulled Worry's latest forest green jumper on. "I try to avoid wearing the shirt as much as possible for the sake of my complexion, and everyone's well being" he continued, dabbing on his cologne in the mirror while Harry stood unmoving.
“Not about winning? I’ll remind you that next week,” Draco said, laughing when Harry flicked a cushion at him wandlessly. Wouldn’t the Wizarding world be impressed by how hypocritical their Saviour was? Just last week Harry had been complaining about losing the Seeker’s game to Ginevra, while this week he was positively gloating about his victory in typical Harry-esque fashion.
Hermione made a sharp noise of disapproval, immediately bursting into laughter when a ball of paper collided sharply against Harry's forehead. He bared his teeth threateningly reflexively at Malfoy who was already leaving the Hall his friends.
- Narcissa (????????)
Harry
Apart from the small smile on Parkinson's face, she seemed almost disinterested as she basked in the attention of everyone. In contrast, Malfoy was completely wound up as he twisted his fingers repeatedly. It was evidence of the Slytherins' insanity, Harry thought privately. To fear that your friend would betray your confidence for entertainment.
In a typical fashion, Hermione had swiftly disappeared with Weasley to places Draco didn't want to think about; to engage in activities Draco definitely did not want to know about. It was most unfortunate that Draco did though, due to a fifth year prefect who had approached him with a haunted look one day. He had yelled at the boy, who had replied with equal ferocity that it was a shared burden.
"The post-war wizarding community has been marked by an avant-garde movement though. Generally, it's an overcompensation for our run in with fascism, but for the younger generation it's more than just a gesture." Blaise wiggled his brows suggestively at Draco. "McG would totally screw tradition to give the kids the interhouse unity they want."
Accompanying it was a note assuring him that she felt him capable of achieving in any area he desired. Even though Bellatrix had squeezed all of his tears out of him during the war, Draco had found himself crying once more. After all, there were few things that Draco believed he deserved after the war, having brought Death Eaters to Hogwarts, and having been complicit in his inaction throughout. There were days where he would be in conflict with himself – he didn't deserve the kind words nor forgiveness, yet he desired so desperately to redeem himself and be a better person for all the times he didn't, and couldn't.
"Draco, you're not an it," Harry said breathlessly, his eyes dancing with mirth. He exclaimed when Draco jabbed him sharply in the abdomen.
"It is!" Harry insisted. "I'm an absolute creep and there's no salvaging this."
"Of course I can. I'm Harry Potter," Harry said wryly as he leaned in for another kiss. "Read the papers when I'm gone," he said casually with a jaunty wave.
He bit his upper lip under Hermione's challenging gaze, as if daring him to remind them the nature of their relationship.
His grunts became shorter as he felt his body tighten, bordering ecstasy. With a final rub of his engorged head, he groaned as white spurts shot from his cock. Catching some of the slick, he unfastened Harry’s trousers quickly to take Harry’s member. Huffing in amusement when Harry stumbled, Draco stepped closer and continued his punishing pace. In moments, Harry came with a broken sob.
"Come on now, off you go," Professor Sprout ushered them into the dorm brightly as Draco sighed deeply for the second time.

Draco tiptoed towards the infamous alcove, his heart beating at a dizzying pace at the glee and excitement of besting his friend. He was in luck to have taken the long route back to the common room, laughing to himself when he heard the couple’s groans.
Harry James Potter is seated behind a table, dressed in a muggle tuxedo suit, bow tie at his neck. He waves his wand and a floating sign appears, reading "Kissing Booth, 10 galleons per kiss". He runs a hand through his hair with an obvious air of awkwardness as he shifts in his seat.

Draco nodded solemnly at him, his eyes red from the tears. "
"You're just being cruel now," Potter complained as he pressed his fingers against his closed eyes.
Draco only smirked at his companion. Potter would have a seizure hanging out with his friends. "You're the one who's barking though. Don't you have a not-so-friendly match tomorrow with Paris Pride? Does Waters know that you've snuck out?"
“Will you lay beside me?” Draco asked quietly.
"Potter, look. When Diggory shot to the pinnacle of fame, his fan club took advantage of the poor layout of Hufflepuff's entrance to grope his arse whenever he was crawling in or out. There was subsequently a whole talk about consent and respect, that you evidently somehow managed to miss. I've been making you go in before me because I've been concerned about your arse. It'll do you well to keep a look out for your fans, alright? A little self-preservation goes a long way when I'm not around."
Draco scarcely looked at his reflection, not bothering with his hair or cologne. With the help of his potion, he would look the best that he would ever manage in the eyes of his beholder anyway. Downing the latest potion confidently, Draco flooed to the foyer before apparating to the gates, headed for his favourite club from what seemed like a lifetime ago.

“Did you manage to win?”
"My hand's a bit occupied right now," he gestured to where their hands were linked.
Peeking into the pouch, he pulled the piece of parchment out, feeling faint when he reached the end of the note.
For Draco, it was humiliating to be on his hands and legs again after the war. Making his people kneel and grovel had been a major aspect of the Dark Lord's regime, and being in that position made him feel ashamed and vulnerable.
"There's um, a full frontal for November in this edition." Harry said as he gestured Draco towards him. Draco moved slowly towards the other man, head ringing from the dissonance of standing at the spot where he used to wank, with the object of his fantasy.
"Reciprocity and all," Harry waved Malfoy's disapproval away. "Also, don't pretend that you aren't interested."
Harry made himself comfortable as he lay on his side to watch the television while Narcissa continued to knead his calf. They laughed together when the protagonist made another sarcastic remark.
"Bloody let me go," Pansy yelled, twisting out of Ron's grip and drawing her wand on him.
"Thank you Draco. Your first resolution wasn't very realistic, but I acknowledge the effort." Hermione said, her lips threatening to burst into a smile when she finished.

"Do yourself a favour and Obliviate yourself after, would you?" He asked as he shrugged on his black woollen coat. "Do you need me to return your books?" He asked when Harry made a soft, unintelligible sound.
, for Merlin's sake. He had intergenerational wealth spanning half a millennium.
Luna sighed to herself. "I wonder about it all the time," she mumbled as they fell asleep in the shade of the tree.
Disrupted by an Order fuelled by the righteous fury of a bunch of slighted Gryffindors, the revenge-bent Ministry had folded, and his trial had concluded swiftly by the end of May. Draco had returned alone to a Manor left in shambles by the Dark Lord's henchmen.
A mug with "Mr Harry Potter" sits on the marble surface, steam rising from within. Harry James Potter lifts his own non-descript mug to his curled lips, smile spreading wider when the vapour condenses against the lenses of his spectacles.
"Is it really there?" Harry yelled as he tried to peer over Malfoy. "It is!" He gasped, yelping when Malfoy grabbed him by the back of his collar.

"Fuck, Harry, fuck," Draco babbled, his voice breathy and thin as he stiffened. Harry's choked over a helpless sob as he followed, warm cum exploding in his hand. Harry shifted away, looking at Draco as he tried to catch his breath.
Draco felt his cock harden as the photograph replayed, his eyes focusing on different parts of the picture each time. He desperately fought the urge to reach between his legs to stroke himself.
Harry James Potter is seated at the counter of a dimly lit bar, dressed in a dark green blazer with nothing underneath. His hair is tucked behind his ears. His slim and shapely finger is trailing the rim of a sweating bottle of stout while he looks into the distance, seemingly lost in thoughts, a faint smile resting on his face.

in his awful inky quill chicken scratch. He trailed his finger across it gently, immediately grabbing Draco when he almost fell over.
It was unlike any kiss that either of them had had, the bone-deep rush of magic rushing through their bodies as if released from a dam where it had been waiting so long for. Harry felt the recognition of their soulbond in his magical core, the magic desperate and hungry to bond with Draco. He moaned, rutting into Draco when Draco cupped his face, the pad of his thumb pressing into his mark. Draco's lips were soft and gentle even while his tongue was hungry and feverish.

"Are you going to tutor us after class?"
"You know, Teddy used to return from your Black holidays chattering about the sights, and Andie would bring exotic souvenirs back and I would wonder how it was. I think that I might have been a little jealous, to be honest? I've always wanted to bring Teddy overseas, too, but you know, me and directions," he shrugged carelessly. "I'm just really happy to be invited. Does this make me an honorary Black now?" Potter continued, as if forgetting that he was Lord Black with the passing of his godfather. Knowing Potter, he probably was unaware, or cared so little about it that he had forgotten about it entirely.
When Potter mimed chattering at him while making a face at Finch-Fletchley's back, Draco suddenly realised how terrible the entire date would look to Potter. Firstly, Finch-Fletchley was dark haired, completely unsuited to Draco's intentions of throwing Potter's scent off. Secondly, he was on a date with Finch-Fletchley, who was undoubtedly an insufferable twit.
"There it is!" Harry exclaimed as he pushed the door to their room open.
"You could have stayed in a hotel," Draco's shoulders loosened even though he continued to hold his hands in an akimbo.
"You'll be covered positively in the papers," Hermione said in an attempt to convince him.
Malfoy blinked at him. "Alright, that's decent," he scribbled on his book with a flourish before leaning back to review the list. "That's acceptable," he shut the book proudly.
"Do I look prettier already? More captivating? The effects are supposed to be instantaneous," Draco said after he had collected his thoughts. He pushed Harry further from him.
"You don't have to answer this as it counts as another question," Lisa said. Harry looked at the Ravenclaw thankfully.
Even though the funds raised from the calendars would go to Hermione's innumerable causes, the purchase of the calendar had brought what felt like the weight of society's suffering upon himself. He would wake to the call of Potter's lewd picture, smirking as he read Tonden Thunderous' scandalous book,
"A lot of dough, not many. You can't count dough," Draco corrected, while Harry said, "And you only had one cookie?"
resolutions next!" Draco said brightly with a clap of his hands as everyone laughed.
Thus, after reviewing your application, we have decided that we will not offer you an interview. We wish you the best in your future endeavours.
Harry shook his head in dark amusement at the easy picking when he heard the intruder walking into the heavy brass stand for fireplace tools. His brows raised when the wards triggered once more and a second voice could be heard scolding their companion.
Draco stewed for a few moments before sniffing unhappily. "Fine, I'm sorry for taking advantage of the opportunity to pinch your butt without consent. I'm sorry for my poor conduct and I promise to always respect your autonomy henceforth."
"Yes, even with Bainbridge & Daughters."
"Would you and Narcissa like to come to the Weasley's gathering? It'll be quite a bit, with the kids and all, but Andy and Teddy will be there. I mean, Ron wanted to invite you too, and Mrs Weasley wants you there, but I mean, if you want to, you know?" Potter mumbled, gesturing lazily as he leaned against Draco with his eyes closed.
Harry was disarmed by the honesty. He had realised quickly that Draco had the tendency to push everyone to show their hand while never revealing his, avoiding discussions about his emotions as much as possible.
“That's not an injury. That's an inconvenience,” Teddy said loudly.
Draco was biting his lips as he looked at him. He suddenly leaned in to press his lips against Harry's. "You're cute," he said evenly with a small smile when he pulled away.

“Potter, etiquette,” Draco exclaimed, gesturing to himself, scowling when the strong gust of wind from Harry made him shiver. Quickly drying himself, he conjured a weak tornado, mindful of the book as he sent the wind towards Harry.
"Goodnight," Harry mumbled as he nuzzled against his pillow. His lids were heavy, and his mind was foggy. He sunk deeper into sleep as a hand pat him softly on the head.

Remember to fulfill your quota in December!
Regardless, concerning the nature of your manual, it is (seemingly) flimsy and whimsical due to your culture’s depiction of the God of Love. Since the Hellenistic period, Cupid has been portrayed as playful, mischievous, and flighty. As a result, the manual is accordingly depicted as careless and lazy, like the work of a young boy more occupied with his other interests.
"A map of Hogwarts," Harry said truthfully, folding it away as Malfoy watched his hands with deep intrigue.
by Pansy Parkinson
"This Friday" Harry said, chin propped on his hand.
The war had taught him many things, of which that his inheritance was never infallible. He would not make the same mistake twice and ruin the friendship that he had come to treasure. Resolving to do the least to satisfy the compulsion of the arrow, processed the words on his tongue carefully before he spoke. “Anything’s good. You can cook your favourite dishes too.”
" he insisted between tears, shaking his head against the curve of Narcissa's neck as he clutched onto the soft linen of her dress.
"Potter?" Malfoy called when he appeared at the common room. He stopped in his tracks at circle of misery before him. "What happened?" He ran forward, dropping to his knees as he took Harry's hand in his.
“Chin up, youngin’. The night’s still young!” Titus the Timid called out from his painting, long lost his apprehensiveness from too many drinks.
"What does that mean? Are you going to work at Hogwarts as a faculty member? What about the Aurors? This isn’t an offer letter, Potter." Draco asked in rapid fire, his face pink from agitation.
Malfoy stared straight at him for a long moment, as if trying to employ Legilimency on him. Harry smiled guilelessly as he repeated his message as loud as possible in his head.
Rounding the four poster bed, Harry reached to pull Draco's glasses off guiltily, pausing when he noticed the bump at Draco's abdomen. The button of Draco's suit had come undone, and Draco had a belly.
Also, it must be said that I no longer relish insulting you. I have matured from our schooldays. Please do not hold my behaviour from our last meeting as a reference of my current character. I lost control of myself and for that, I am deeply ashamed.
Harry could only shrug in reply. Trying to find himself through work would have been better than trying to find his soulmate through work. It was the largest mistake in his life—that he had been searching for his soulmate instead of himself. He wondered if the regret was obvious, that he had nothing to show unlike Malfoy's easy confidence and casual effusiveness. Malfoy had cast away the burdens of the past, whereas his own had weighed him down for the longest time.
It felt like it had been ages since Draco had sat on his bed, staring at
"A bit. I mean, you can sort of tell, and it fits, you know?" Ron said as he stopped outside his own room.
"Harry, this is ridiculous. It's supposed to be a favour, not a binding document!"
"Sixth sense, Potter. After all, I'm your biggest fan," he joked, gesturing for Potter to enter the door before him.
“What happened?” he asked softly, coughing at the tickle when the Healer helped to moisten his throat with a spell. Draco thanked him.
He had always been a thoughtful gifter, and he wanted to do something more this year.
Harry nodded as he gaped at the change. The shops had got louder—if it was even possible, and the shopfront for the Weasley’s Wizarding Wonders had tripled in size. A rival line of phones from across the pond had set up opposite them.
Harry felt his shoulders slump, recognising a lost cause when he saw one. Malfoy had withdrawn into his shell and there was no way Harry could draw him out, short of starting a fight.
- Luna
Harry was appalled by the insinuation. "What? Merlin, no! I was surprised but no!"
"Are you sure that you want the dragon to be white?" Draco asked his cousin, desperate to put off talking to Potter as much as possible, afraid that he would burst into flames at prolonged conversation. Potter was simply too much, and Draco worried about his mortality.
"Of course," Luna replied easily. "To start afresh, to do good work."
"Do you see why he annoyed me so much previously? He just manages to be so into himself without even trying!" Draco exclaimed while Potter looked at him, hurt.
They fell asleep that night in each other’s embrace, cautiously excited for the days to come.
Harry huffed as he returned the offending present into his drawer. Why did his partner have to give him lube? He would have a
"I'll write to you," he told Greg as they gave each other a quick one armed hug. "Pansy," he nodded, the air between them heavy with unsaid words. Just as he made to leave with his coat on, Pansy pulled him in for a hug. "Tread carefully but take the chance when it arises," she whispered before pulling back. He mulled over her words as he pecked her on the cheek.
"I wagered on the Underground," Greg said when they emerged on the other side.
“You haven’t had lunch?” Harry asked, taking a seat as he waved Malfoy’s offer of a spoon away.
"Has the Lake frozen over properly?" He asked as he returned the paper to Draco. Privately, he had checked with Hermione and gotten an affirmative.
Unlike Hermione, Draco had not been successful in his endeavours–which only confirmed Harry's prior opinions of his capacity for evil. Pansy was entirely unmoved while Draco ranted, blind to his violent gestures. There seemed to be an unspoken 'nobody talks about the Slytherins' party' as most of the Eight Years slumped over their breakfast, miserable and half awake. Harry counted himself lucky, having vomited before he passed out.
. Regardless of the awful humor, it was plain to everyone that Draco was interested in giving back to Hogwarts. Which was just as well—Hermione had nothing but praise for Hogwarts' Potions education the last round of drinks at the pub that Draco managed to attend. Sometimes he wished that Draco had a bit more time to spare. He really enjoyed the camaraderie that they had built up.
"Harry wouldn't," Ginny said.

"Not any more so," Harry said carefully. His eyes were thick with guilt and sympathy.
Draco rolled his eyes in fond annoyance, his heart warm from the return of their familiar camaraderie. "He wasn't
"I did, but it was still harrowing," Harry pouted for maximum effect.
“Hey,” Harry greeted, pausing momentarily as he looked at the small space between Draco and Smith. It didn’t seem to matter to him though, dropping into the seat with a careless shrug while Draco scooted towards the armrest. Harry apologized to Smith with his usual sincerity for the squeeze.
Harry sipped his wine, watching as candlelight contoured Draco's high cheekbones. The warm glow was dancing across Draco form as he gestured while talking about the shenanigans the Slytherins had got up to in their last trip to a ski resort.
" He mimicked in a high falsetto.
Draco shifted in his seat at the F word. "Not baring your soul, are you? Be careful, I might go running for
"Or Apparition," Blaise supplemented.
, if you will. A desire to prove yourself, a–" it suddenly broke off with a chuckle.
"State your business, Potter."
"I had a great time there," Harry said as he bumped his shoulder against Draco's in an attempt to comfort. The arrangements for The Quiet had been bound by robust nondisclosure agreements between the proprietor and the lodger.
"We were with Malfoy when we walked into an ambush. Seven students tried to attack him. This is not the first time, and they have also have been bullying other Slytherins," Hermione stated as the Headmistress' eyes swept back and forth between her students in anguish.
"Well, probably not an expert. But you always talk about inefficiencies, and after seeing you at work, I think that
"You're so sleazy," Draco rolled his eyes in fond amusement as he returned to his essays. "Don't you have any marking to be done?" He poked Harry with his red biro.
In all honesty, Draco spent the entirety of January considering whether to throw out the blasted Potter calendar before he had come to the inevitable fact that he could never part with it. There was no cure to the insatiable hunger, and Draco was resigned to salivate with the rest of the wizarding world over Potter's semi-nude form every month, foreseeable year and all of eternity.
Teddy froze at the reminder. "We're having pasketti," he said to himself as he smacked himself on the forehead.
his words, but it was the closest that anyone had come to it.
, the topic has never arisen, and I thought that you were aware!"
"No. It'll make me look washed out."
"Hermione says that you shouldn't get up," Ron said as he handed Harry's spectacles over.
Harry shrugged as he fell across the sofa. Draco's seventh year double Potions typically ended early and he always felt guilty keeping Draco waiting. Also, with Draco's schedule, Harry felt like he didn't see him often enough. Draco had shared once that he had joined Hogwarts above his full-time job due to the desire to reform the curriculum so that it would encourage discovery instead of merely precise brewing, and that he had continued
Frowning as he examined the layers of the wards, he wondered about the owner's seeming paranoia and the haphazardness of the newer additions. Unlike the original foundations, it was brusque and inelegant. If he shifted the ward just so to—"welcome, Mr. Potter."
“We’re not–” he broke off as he glanced furtively at Draco. “We haven’t talked about it yet,” he glared at Ron to convey his annoyance. They had been over this multiple times, and Ron’s clumsy meddling was only making things harder for him. He could already feel Draco's nervousness rolling off in waves.
Draco
"No, Potter. Wait," Malfoy sobered quickly as he caught him by the arm. "Sorry, I just thought that you were thinking too highly of me."
"Do you need help reaching Narnia?" Draco asked he stretched languorously on his bed, feeling the release in his muscles. "The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe," he laughed, frowning when his dressing room was silent.
“Yes,” Draco said as he held up the paper. “
Harry swallowed. He registered the gravity of the situation, but he was unable to decipher what he had missed.
"Finding yourself through work?" Malfoy tilted his head as he looked at him in commiseration.
"Alright, Harry. You don't have to worry about formalities around me. I'm not going to judge you, or go running for anyone over the things that you do. You're a young boy looking for a bit of a break. Go do whatever you want, go see whatever you like. I'll always be available for meals or to prepare food you require for your journeys," she said levelly she met his eyes.
Draco frowned at Harry, who was swaying in his seat while laughing. He swapped his drink with Harry disapprovingly. "Potter, you're getting morose again," he said as he nudged his water towards Harry.
to him the day after he gone Christmas shopping with Potter, and Draco had been upset about the unfavourable coverage before Harry had appeared, ranting about the lady at the video rental shop. Draco had quickly forgotten about his strop as they settled, watching The Matrix.

"Do you want to go to bed," he asked as he waited for Draco to work through his confusion. "It's ten past six right now."
Draco looked around their table in scandalised shock. "Potter, people would think that—" he ran his fingers through his hair, frazzled. "Merlin's pants, Potter. You're lucky that we're in Muggle Paris. The Prophet would have a field day. Imagine having to explain the headline to Weasley." He shuddered involuntarily at the image of Weasley turning as red as his hair in agitation.
"Payback for sixth year," Draco joked wryly, his smirk widening at the look of disbelief on the other man's face.
2. visit a lavender field
Draco narrowed his eyes at Potter, watching him squirm with flushed cheeks. "Maybe it's a pureblood thing," Draco said slowly before deciding to let it go when Potter burst into laughter while agreeing.
“I’m glad to be sitting here too,” Hermione said as she wiped the tears in her eyes away fiercely. Harry smiled at her in agreement.
"Of course it is," Draco recovered quickly, rolling his eyes as he forked another bit for himself. "I ordered it after all."
"Take your poncy products—new bottles for when you stay over."
“Oh, but that’s your fault,” Draco smirked at him as they wrestled to keep his hand away from his face.
"Well I don't see the difference!" Malfoy said vehemently as he threw his hands in the air. "Your arse is literally out!"
"Don't look at me," Hermione shrugged when Harry turned to her pleadingly.

Harry trudged over. He removed his boots and Scourgified himself before climbing into the bed.
"Potter, you can sacrifice your life just to reach the Arc, but it wouldn't do to bring me along." He finally grinned as he smoothed the French linen of his shirt.
"We should start penalising people. We'd be rich," Harry grinned as he played with the ring of water on the table.
Draco felt a tear slide down his temple before his vision went black. Finally, an instance where Harry Potter couldn't save him.
Hermione (and Ronald Weasley)
"Of course. Ron doesn't hang out with just anyone, you know?"
- Auror mission overseas (too close to home according to Hermione)
Draco's eyes bulged at the second revelation of the night. Harry was revealing everything tonight, and Draco was wrong-footed. He had never mentioned his side project to Harry.
Draco looked down at his clothes in confusion. "I threw this on for breakfast, Potter."
"There's always time for that later," Harry beamed at Draco for the opportunity at all.
"Yes, I did. I'm glad that you guys are finally together. I thought that I should wait, but you'd probably appreciate it." She extended a hand at Draco, nodding for him to take it. He slipped his hand into hers quizzically.
“Yeah, but Harry’s too polite to tell all of them to shove off,” Ginny said. She waved for Neville to finish his drink.
13. Force him if he doesn’t!!!! :(
"Wait!"
“Is there anything else that I should know?” Harry asked as he pointed his chin at Hermione.
me! Do you know how long I spent finding that present for you?" Harry felt his heart aching as he remembered how Draco had insulted his gift yesterday just because he wanted Harry to what, cry for him?
Potter had lost the sallow, ill-fed look from being a fugitive, yet he had somehow managed to retain the cheekbones. Potter had also grown his hair out, and it was presently touching the collar of his button down. It was a strange look on the boy he had long considered his enemy. With the long lashes framing his bright green eyes and the strange tenderness of the way his hair was tucked behind his ears, Potter actually looked conventionally attractive in the Muggle media sort of way. It was a revelation that Draco didn't quite know how to deal with. He squeezed Pansy's arm lightly for reassurance.
Harry hummed as he waved goodbye. It sometimes felt like Greg was coddling his feelings, which was a weird thought to have, because it was completely unnecessary.
"Well, we can sit with the Slytherins tomorrow," Hermione said. "Nott did a really good presentation during Arithmancy today," she explained with a raised brow when both of her friends stared at her in shock.
Harry shrugged as he set down his bag. He had gotten a second-last secret exchange gift out of desperation, hoping that it would convince Draco of his sincerity when he inevitably ended up angry.
Draco swiped the shampoo suds from his eyes in frustration. If only he had made a better impression on Potter today. Mind wandering to the memory of Potter's muscular thighs and his still-knobbly knees, Draco felt his consternation fade a little, a soft moan reverberating in the shower chamber as he worked his cock once more, albeit slower this time.
They rounded the corner. "Protego!" He shouted, jinxes bouncing off his shield as he pulled Malfoy backwards.
Ron looked around quickly before bending close again. “The thing! The thing we did!” He elaborated in exasperation when Harry only continued to stare at him blankly.

Draco sat on the floor, laughing as he watched Harry try to get Teddy to space the Christmas ornaments out.
"I appreciate your kindness," Draco said stiffly with clear dismissal.
year in the row, as if he doesn’t have students trailing after you. Manage your own hoard, please."
Draco made a strangled noise when Harry trailed a line of hot kisses upwards, nuzzling into his neck before biting it and immediately soothing the hurt with his tongue. Harry’s hand slipped under his shirt, pushing it upwards as he ran his hands across Draco’s back.
' when he had laughed it off previously. But needs must, and he was running late. "Harry, you can do it, alright?" Draco repeated seriously as he looked into Harry’s eyes, waiting until he received a confirmation from his friend.
"Please pardon Potter's insanity," Malfoy excused when their friends looked at Harry in concern.
Harry snorted at the understatement. Harry had never heard of a revealing as violent as his own. Ron's soulmark had set in through a week long itch, the skin on his knee giving way to reveal the first words a younger Hermione had spoken to him on the Hogwarts train.
"No," Parkinson replied immediately.
The left lens was unrecoverable. He would have to send an order to Paris for another customised crystal and wait for its delivery before he could open any more exuberant fanmail. His life would be so boring in the meantime. Draco leaned backwards before storing the packages away.
"Well, the amounts of maturity we possess between the two of us would definitely impress everyone." He shrugged before quickly switching topics. "To be honest, I wouldn't have believed that we could manage half a day without maiming each other too seriously."
Portkey Arrivals, Hangzhou, China
Trailing his fingers across the rough finishing of the Hogwarts walls, Harry walked down the corridors as the magic in the castle glided along with him. Its eagerness was contagious, and he complied in amusement whenever it alerted him of the new additions to the castle. He was appraising a (relatively) new wall lamp when the magic suddenly began to tremble in excitement.
Stopping by the toilets, Draco had looked at himself in the mirror, to marvel at the Head Boy badge on his chest. Years ago, the immature boy he used to be would have been dizzy with the power entrusted to him. Now, as he rubbed at the tension between his temples, Draco wondered how his incarcerated father would react to the sight of him now. Would he be proud of Draco's Head Boy status, or be more affected that his heir was now in Hufflepuff? Shaking his head, Draco cast the question out of his mind before running towards the dungeons, worried about his tardiness for double Potions.
two sets of robes. You'll definitely need to attend the Ministry Ball, and having robes to change around would make it
“Sorry,” Harry said, reaching over to hold the book. “Your turn now. I’ll just—”
Weasley broke out into sniggers, before Hermione and Potter followed. Incredulous, Draco frowned at them in disapproval.
Draco swiped the letter off the table and tucked it into his robes before the Patronus even disappeared. He rushed through the halls, down the staircase, and across the Atrium. Throwing the Floo powder into the fireplace, he disappeared in a whirl.
Leisure
"Of course that's given."
"Who else might you want to avoid on a date night," he mumbled as he rubbed his chin. "—been working with the Aurors... shouldn't have any new enemies..."
Ron looked between Luna and Pansy before making a noise of realization. "Don't make a habit out of it," he warned Harry, who only shrugged. Harry had been taken by the party kit and had immediately mailed his purchase to George for consideration. Draco had only refused to agree with its creativity due to the childish jokes in it. Any party would be ruined if guests could only squeak or hiccup randomly.
"Draco!"
Draco
Between wrapping the present with Hermione, plotting to become Malfoy's Potions partner, wondering when he could request for his Potions coaching and waiting for Malfoy's return, Harry had spent the entire day thinking about his roommate. He was disappointed when Malfoy only shrugged as he hung up his robes.
"Can't believe that you lost my cousin, Potter," Draco said as they stepped out of the hospital for lunch while Teddy visibly vibrated at the excitement of visiting a Muggle eatery, having gotten over the disappointment of not visiting Uncle George at Diagon Alley.
“Oh,” Draco said quietly as he worried at his lips. Harry kept his newest gift away in his drawer, huffing in amusement at the row of them. He met Draco’s eyes to laugh at it, only to be taken aback by the conflict in them.
Similarly, it was easy to see why there was a discrimination against the Hufflepuffs when accessing the common room necessitated crawling. It was inconceivable that one would be required to grovel multiple times a day in school, and with prolonged exposure, he wrote, it would have negative consequences on a person's psyche.
"No," Draco disagreed as he widened the space between Harry's thumb and index finger. "You're Harry Potter. You can't be a teeny tiny WEEP."
Potter, I worry for your date. They seem too nice to die like this. But honestly, being enemies when you were both in school? That would mean that you guys have been a part of each others' lives (for better or worse) for more than twenty years. If you're at the stage of going on dates, I don't think that it'll go too badly. I happen to think that you're perfectly sincere in a bumbly, endearing sort of manner and that can be quite charming. They'd be silly to not enjoy the date tomorrow!
"Congratulations on passing your interview. Welcome to the Love Division of the Department of Mysteries," she announced, her smile crooked with pride and glee.
Harry was empirically attractive, his hair thick and wavy, eyes bright and intelligent, his skin a healthy olive, his single dimple deep and generous, his chin as strong as his sense of justice. But even when Harry was content on his lap, he was never Draco’s to love. Harry belonged to the brave and the worthy, not the condemned, greedy, and timid.
"Aren't you familiar with our schedule? What are the chances of Draco Malfoy being an Archer?" Potter mused as he stared him down, mischief in his eyes. "I remember your fervent support of the Tornadoes."
"Alright! Harry will be sharing his
"Well, that's a stretch. I don't think that you're perfect," Harry said skeptically. "You're a proper embarrassment, honestly."
Harry nodded as they walked back to the Great Hall. "There was a misunderstanding," he said, smirking at Draco over Luna's head. Draco flushed at how obtuse he had been.
François Gérard (b. 1770)
Pansy shrugged coolly. "Nothing. I was just passing by when I saw Granger by her lonesome. I was keeping her company until you returned."
Harry searched the extendable shopping bag from Hermione, nervous from the expectant looks he was receiving. He brightened when his hand connected with the pot behind Teddy’s new owl cage, above the packs of soil.
two of us.
Regardless of the guilt that Draco felt, the sight of Potter sneaking forlorn looks at him constantly, too stubborn to end his self-imposed misery, amused him slightly. Potter looking like a miserable puppy left Draco wondering how he had even considered the boy's similarity to Jesus.
Cheeks flushing, Harry ignored the quickening of his heart as he shoved his hand into the hat. Malfoy seemed to be in a better mood today, Harry thought as he tried to flick away the slip of paper that clung stubbornly to his hand. He wondered if Malfoy would turn in early. His nightmares had reduced recently, hadn't they?
Draco pretended to appraise Harry, sweeping his eyes over Harry's face, then his form, muscled from the weekly Auror trainings. "Maybe," he said noncommittally. It was criminal that Harry's skin was flawless even with his dismal skincare regimen and extended exposure under the sun. "I'll apply for a refund if you don't age well."
"Well Potter, your very mature friend sounds like he has a good head on his shoulders. But I'm sure that he was only pretending to push you out, which makes you a smelly liar." Draco smirked as he held Potter's eyes defiantly.
Harry sifted through the stack of rigged mail with his wand. "You've been shopping? It smells like Bubotuber pus."
His ability to plod along had been his strength when he was younger, but it was now his burden. While he could continue as it was, it would make him unhappy. However, he didn’t know where to begin if he wanted to make changes. What if he regained his memories and hated the new life that he had made for himself?
“Well, I see where you’re coming from with the campaign, but—” he broke off as he watched Malfoy eye the rest of the cakes in the box wistfully as if considering whether to have another. “Do you want to go for lunch? We can talk over lunch. I’ll buy.”
"Potions genius and more," Nott remarked quietly. Harry felt his cheeks flush as Malfoy's hand jerked while flipping his textbook.
am in fact
After nights of haunting the halls along with the spectres of the war, Draco was relieved when his mother expressed an interest in moving to one of their properties on the continent. Disregarding the option to follow, he has decided to remain in England regardless of the open disdain he received – to go into self-exile was too cowardly, even for him. In the days he had spent in confinement awaiting his trial, Draco had made up his mind to find the person he was – beyond the duties of his lineage, and beyond the teachings of his father. He had sworn to redeem the Malfoy name as his family had done multiple times before, only that he would do it
"What! No way!" Malfoy said as he shoved his hands under Harry greedily.
Hermione Granger, Junior Officer, Department of Magical Law Enforcement, has proposed a law to improve privacy for individuals. Individuals and corporations whose actions have inconvenienced others can be fined up to five thousand galleons and/or be sent to Azkaban for three years. Harry Potter welcomed the proposal.

"He's worried about his gift exchange partner and his last gift," Ron said.
conversation?"
When he finally poured the second batch of tea into the cups he had set out, it suddenly struck him that it could be his tester’s fault. Setting his teapot down carefully, Draco rushed towards his dressing room for a change of clothes. He tried to manage his expectations, but it was impossible—he had only started using pearl powder as a catalyst a month ago when his arrangement with Harry had started, and if it wasn’t his catalyst, then it was obviously his tester. Harry was the anomalous case every magical theorist speculated about in their essay conclusion—he had bloody lived through two AKs through sheer pig-headedness, and instead of being wary, Draco had so merrily taken up the offer for him to be his tester.
"Okay. I want a copy before we meet." Harry extended a hand for him to shake.
, you've never mentioned it before!" Potter was verging on shrill now.
"Potter, you bloody fuck–Expelliarmus!" Malfoy caught the package easily. "Merlin's pants!" Exasperation gave way to shock when he saw the familiar label on the bottles.
Harry grinned when Malfoy slapped Blaise's hand as he reached over to pull the strings attached to the bells on his jumper.
"No, I think she means Professor
"Like I've said, you were obsessed–" Ron broke off with an appreciative moan at the strawberry trifle, "–with Cedric and Malfoy!"
Between the lack of a dessert, Malfoy's rapid fire quizzing and his insistence that Harry showered first, Harry felt like he had truly deserved the entire thing to himself. Nonetheless, because Harry had a kind heart, he had decided to share it with Malfoy while impatiently waiting for him to unwrap his own present.
Eternally grateful and an entire vault poorer
Harry stared blankly at the new carpet and the bright yellow curtains that Draco had purchased and installed in the dining room. Surely there was more to Harry Potter than throwing himself on the frontline.
“So you’ll score better than her now?” Harry asked as he peered at him with faux innocence, his lips threatening to split with mirth.
"Shut up!" Draco snapped, heedless of the attention that they were receiving.
Draco rolled his eyes when he met Potter's once more. "So what would you be doing, Potter? Running DMLE from inside with Hermione?"
Draco gasped. “You’re getting something for me?” he said with exaggerated gratitude.
"I get it, you know? But I must say, Potter, unlike everyone else, I was not surprised when I heard that you would be settling down. It gets tiring after a while," Malfoy's smile was crooked.
"Are you sure?" Harry asked as he tried to linger and peer into the shop. "That's not my experience with them."
After bidding his mother goodbye, Draco took up residence in one of their London properties with Worry and Sneezy. Having raised him, the elves had been adequately disgruntled at being banished from the Manor during the war, and the idea of leaving Draco alone once more had not sat well.
Potter grinned at him as he finally opened the box. "Oh." He gaped at the cufflinks, speechless.
"These are new!" He pulled it off and tried to charm the stain off. Pansy crossed her arm, watching him flail about with a distinct air of unconcern.
Closing his eyes, Draco leaned in to press his lips against Harry's.
"Were Cho and Weasley your beards?" Parkinson pressed.
Harry felt wrong-footed at the unadulterated joy on Malfoy’s face. He was sure that he had never seen Malfoy so open before. “Erm, of course. It’s a bribe,” he said honestly, laughing when Malfoy suddenly pulled out a fork from a drawer and helped himself immediately.
"Malfoy, no. Wait," he pleaded. He held onto Malfoy's bony wrist only to be flung off violently as Malfoy continued to pack. The both of them paused when the door to the dungeon opened. Harry felt his heart speed up at the sight of the Slytherins.
, it's DADA, and

Draco shook his head in disapproval. "Teddy takes after you," he said as he walked out of the kitchen.
It simply did whatever the fuck it wanted (in Pansy's words), and the rest would be settled with the magic of love. The arrows delivered the courage to push people onto the path of happiness and the rest depended on the individual themselves to follow the call of their heart.
He had moved towards Harry when he saw panic flit across his friend's face, his eyes darting around before landing on girl Weasley. Draco was confused as he watched Harry seemingly plead with girl Weasley.
The grin he received was disproportionate to the statement he made. Draco's frown deepened into a scowl at not being taken seriously.
"Harry, help," Teddy complained as he hit Draco with his Hufflepuff tinsel.
Draco jumped when he heard a peal of laughter followed by a thump a few rows away. Aware of how suspicious he looked, he returned the notes into the box.
"We won't be going to the amusement park. It'll be too late." He should have known better than to spend time anticipating Draco's replies when he was so fond of curveballs. "No one goes to the amusement park at night," he explained exasperatedly when Draco continued to search his eyes for deceit.
Draco pushed him back gently, and Harry finally extracted himself, his heart a frenzied beat while the bond vibrated between them like a ready spell.
"Where are you taking me to?" Draco asked shyly as he placed his hands beside Harry's gently.
Draco sighed noisily as the fight left his body. "You're really my Achilles heel. Let's go in, shall we?"
junior WEEP then." Draco leaned towards Harry in amusement. "Can't have you be a junior with me."
Harry focused on his amusement as he tried to ignore the tightness in his stomach when he peeked at Malfoy–who was already doing the same. Harry quickly looked away when he received a raised brow.
“Stop it,” Draco complained as he pushed him away.
Draco smiled thinly as he waved his wand in a fanciful upwards spiral at his potion.
Even though they would have a ridiculous number of arguments throughout the span of their lives, Harry would always look back to their first solstice together fondly; and it had all begun with an anonymous gift exchange.
Pansy left before any of them could reply. Draco watched Hermione look at Pansy's retreating figure. "You don't have to respond to her. Pansy gets these ideas sometimes and no one can stop her. Ignore her if she pesters you."
Joining the queue for stamps, Draco refused to chicken out. Firstly, his mother would be disappointed. So would Headmistress McGonagall and Professor Vector, who had helped with his application. Secondly, he really
"Then perhaps you shouldn't be prodding it with your wand," Draco advised as he walked towards his dressing room for a change of clothes.

Draco smiled to himself as his heart squeezed in the depths of affection he had for the man. He often worried about the future they would have together, but maybe, it would be just like his extra-extra-extra-extra-extra-large calendar—he would take it one month at a time, and always wait excitedly for the next.
"Well, you'll have me around to maintain your coat anyway," Draco replied, immediately wincing at his carelessness at implying that they had to be sexually exclusive to one another. They had only agreed to be discrete, not exclusive, and he was already flouting the month-old agreement. His face burned as he desperately busied himself with looking for a pair of briefs to wear to preserve whatever was left of his dignity.
“A dark slashing curse?” He looked at Harry in alarm.
made Draco sympathise enough not to rat to Andromeda. Emphasis on the almost because Draco was mean as fuck.
The sky had only begun to lighten when Draco snapped to sudden consciousness on a Muggle's bed for the second time in the month. Removing the pale arm on him carefully, he mentally catalogued the crustiness in his nether regions. With his friends' preference for Muggle bars post-war and his unfortunate horniness since the start of the year, Draco had come to be familiar with the sensation of dried come in the morning.
Harry made a face as he served Draco a helping of sausages. “I’ll work on it over the holidays. I promise,” he emphasised when Draco only looked at him sceptically.
Greg nodded slowly while he shut the lid on one of the boxes. “Twenty cakes since first year.”
"Fine," Draco finally sniffed as he dusted the front of his poncey waistcoat. Even his casual wardrobe screamed old money.
"You've been glaring. What did she do?"
Draco had lost track of time when Potter suddenly pulled back, pupils blown, hair wild from Draco's fingers. Draco mirrored the dopey smile on Potter's swollen lips. Arm still thrown over Draco's waist, Potter slid off him to lie on the mat.

Potter, I grew up with Pansy, and Pansy was making Blaise jealous so she asked me to the Yule Ball.
Draco rolled his eyes and he flicked his own wand—it was an argument that they had had multiple times. Harry would always be swept away by a note and miss the rest, including any relevant updates to the initial note. With the majority of the Aurors' cases being pressed for time, the indiscriminate amount of memos that piled up was an efficiency gap that magnified itself in the Auror department.
He had spent breakfast feigning a headache as he mulled over Lucius' last words to Malfoy. Not only did it imply that Lucius was unrepentant, he was also misguided to attribute the Death Eaters' loss entirely to his son. Surely a regiment whose success hinged upon a single lackey would be doomed to fail. Besides, Voldemort really should have placed more weight on the backing from Harry's friends and the sheer amount of dumb luck he had.
“Show him, show him,” he insisted when Harry only stood by Malfoy’s table, an awkward smile pasted onto his face, his eyes darting back and forth—from Malfoy’s glittering eyes, the unbridled amusement, the half-eaten yellow tart, Malfoy’s slim fingers as he held onto Teddy’s embrace—while he tried his best to not be obvious about it all.
“Yes,” Harry replied as he looked around the small table, marvelling at the friends past-Harry had made in the six years.
Draco seemed to consider his words before filling two glasses with water. Floating it to the polished coffee table, he walked slowly towards Harry.
Potter hummed in agreement. "I love it when my very mature friend pushes me into the road just to end an argument."
“Yes, show me, Harry,” Draco said in amusement, his smile strangely showing no malice. Had they progressed onto first names? Weren’t they supposed to be professional at work?
"Pansy—" he called out as he walked towards the table. Pansy and Hermione sprang apart.
The Healer glanced at Harry quickly before turning back to look at him. “Cowherd performed a dark slashing curse on your neck. Mr. Potter helped to reverse the darkness and cast some recovery spells before you arrived in St. Mungo’s. Cowherd has been apprehended and will be charged. You might feel a bit of itchiness on your neck while it recovers, but everything should be fine in a while. The scars will fade with more applications of dittany.”
“Erm, none for me, thanks. It’s a big day and I want to-” he waved his hand at his head in general. “Sober and all.”
"And deprive people of the excitement?" Hermione said as she handed the Marauders' Map to Harry with a tilt of her head in the direction back to their dormitories. "Let's go."
Malfoy only rolled his eyes in response.
“The bribery is working,” he pointed to the box of cakes. “So what do you want, Ha—Potter?”
," he broke off as he started to pace about the room while mumbling under his breath. He made a beeline for Harry's old wrappers before laughing in a sharp huff.
"Neither was the second, if you asked me," Harry said.
Do you think that I'll be posting something to Hogwarts?" He asked as he continued to scrutinise his mark, just to be sure. "How can something this normal be red marked?"
"Are you going to open a shop?" Granger asked Pansy while Draco turned to look Potter straight in the eye, cheering internally when the other immediately looked away. Determined to get even, Draco disregarded his polite upbringing as he continued to scrutinise the other.
"To Draco!" Blaise cheered, raising his glass in a toast.
Dear Draco,
"Honestly, another person who doesn't think that galleons fall from your arse? They're automatically a friend of mine," Malfoy said as he gathered his toiletries.
"Is that where—oh-" Harry paused on the steps when the wards sang to him. "Oh," he said in understanding as he pet them with his magic.
"Draco," he whispered as he shook him lightly on his bare shoulder. "Draco," he repeated with more force, smiling nervously when the boy hummed at him with bleary eyes.
"My Father alluded that I led to his loss, and reminded me to marry a Pureblood girl–" Malfoy said flatly as if he was nothing of great concern "–regardless of my sexual proclivities."
“A new phone?” Teddy’s eyes widened as he smiled hopefully at him.
Draco
"I'm sorry," Malfoy said as he fastened his satchel close. "It just came out and I didn't mean it." He fiddled with the fabric corner of his reference book, "and also, the times before this. It was mean, and I'm sorry."
"Maybe it's on my arse," Draco retorted as he put his hand into a sleeve.
Draco huffed in amusement. He reached to help take the clothes over, raising a brow questioningly when Harry moved it out of his reach.
"A contract is merely a document that spells out the obligations of the parties,
," Hermione mimicked in an exaggerated baritone as she flipped the page of her book. "To which I would reply–once again–that there is a lot to study if you wanted to, and then you would say that I wouldn't need to study so much if I had accepted a guaranteed spot at the Ministry." She set her fork down heavily as she looked into Harry's eyes.
Disarmed by the series of revelations, Harry was confused by how quickly the party had ended and he felt unmoored by the loss of Malfoy on his side.
They stumbled back to their dorm in lousy alliterations and giggles.
Teddy giggled when the both of them peppered kisses on the sides of his face. "Okay, no more. I need to decorate my tree," he said almost immediately as he pushed Draco's face away.
Harry froze at the door of the hospital wing when five pairs of eyes turned towards him the moment he stepped in. Pansy was in Malfoy's bed, an arm around his shoulder.
Draco sighed at his parchment in despair. He was now officially obsessing over having a warm wet hole to fuck. Pansy really brought out the worst in him.
The smile on his companion's face widened. "Asphyxiation play gone wrong?"
It was the first argument in their relationship.
Narcissa patted his leg in commiseration. Harry turned back to face the television, conscious that he was now a year older. He steadfastly refused to think about the letters the both of them had sent out for his new job. Settling in to watch the movie, they were heedless of the time.
Narcissa had written to Malfoy to request a nerve salve for her anonymous lodger, and it had helped his recovery immensely. Harry was no longer a stranger to benefitting from Malfoy's Potioneering skills. With a focus on critical conditions, Malfoy had developed
"Are pastels your thing?" He held a bundle of ribbons against Malfoy's head with a frown. He had written to request for a catalogue from the Hogsmeade shop Lavender and Parvati used to talk about all the time, finally understanding the appeal of the establishment when he learnt about the self-tying and anti-loosening charms in their hair accessories.
, isn’t it?” Malfoy asked speculatively.
21 August 2012
"Mate, it's the Diggory business from third year," Weasley explained, leaning in slightly as settled his hand on his girlfriend's thigh.
The camera glides over the vast selection of beautifully decorated sweet on display before replaying.
Malfoy shook his hand off. "Now you're just being an arse."
Harry snapped out of his giddiness when Draco suddenly slapped him at the side of his head.
Entering the class with an apology for Professor Slughorn, Draco instead found the man preoccupied with worshipping Potter at the front row. Looking across the class, he found Blaise smirking at him from the back as he set up his cauldron. Returning it out of habit as he made his way to Blaise, he caught Potter's eyes. For reasons unknown to him, Potter was looking at him pleadingly while Slughorn continued praising him for his intellect and bravery.
"Fine, Potter. Fine!" Malfoy slammed his hand onto the bench to swipe his own textbook off. "You act like you're so benevolent but you're no better than your cronies. You want my blood, right? Fine!" Malfoy shouted, fumbling with his ingredients as his hands trembled with fury.
Quickly grabbing Potter by the arm, Draco pretended to push Potter into the road, bursting into laughter at the flash of shock on Potter's face.
"Bloody hell, that fucking arsehole!" Harry swore when Malfoy swung his bag onto his shoulder as he stood without replying.
"It's okay. I just woke up anyway, we'll open it together tonight," Malfoy said in amusement, obviously taking pleasure in Harry's anxiety. "Thanks for sending it along though. I appreciate it."
"Problem?" Harry stopped rifling through his bag for a moment to raise a brow at his seatmate.
"I had to look for your
Draco now lived life on a day-to-day basis with nobody to satisfy. The freedom was immense, and he squandered it lavishly, better understanding the field of psychology, and Muggles.
"No, I saw her yesterday. Why?"
Harry laughed as he made a joke about how it would become his reward, not Draco’s. Silent, Draco couldn’t tell if it was himself who thought that Harry’s friendship on its own was a reward or the Draco under the influence of the arrow.
"Indeed. Keep your friends close, enemies closer." The corner of Mrs. Malfoy’s lips were lifted.
Draco pet the arm around him, his heart tender. Harry perked up when Ginevra finally returned her attention to Luna. Taking the opportunity, he reached over to dust the snow off Harry’s messy hair, the disappointment at the continued influence of the arrow immediately dissipating when he took in Harry’s bright eyes and wide smile, cheeks flushed from the cold. The sight of Harry's happiness still made his heart lift.
"It's fine," Hermione said as she returned to her notes. Her face was impossible to read.
"I'll allow it," Lisa said with a shrug. "It's already pretty late and this can be our last round. It's an ode to why we're all here anyway," she said, waving away the applause with an eye roll.
"Do you remember how we used to talk about what we'd want to do when we grow up?" Aunt Andromeda asked, her eyes bright. "Maybe it's time for your bakery."
Lifting the spoon, he cracked the caramelised sugar on top with relish. The desserts at L'intimiste were stellar, and since he had first chanced upon the restaurant with Hermione years ago, he had dragged her back multiple times just for their crème brûlée. Slicing his pudding carefully, Draco scooped a fragile piece up as Finch-Fletchley's dry conversation and the embarrassment of being caught in an awful date by Potter faded away.
Harry shook his head in sympathy. "Honestly, you've already tried your best. Just make sure that the last is really good. If they end up being an arse anyway, at least they'll feel guilty afterwards."
“It is. I don’t do incomplete work, Potter,” Draco said, immediately regretting how short he sounded when Harry’s frown deepened. What more did the arrow expect of him! He handed the book to Harry, taking the opportunity to brush their hands against each other's. “This isn’t the only book that I read. We’ll be prepared as long as you remember your spells.”
"Think about Hogsmeade, alright? You could save me from a full day of Draco's overbearing presence," she said, addressing the second half of her comment towards Draco, who only glared at her.
"It's not that bad," Hermione said that night after Harry explained his situation.
?" His soulmate's handwriting was a ridiculous, traditional cursive that only made everything worse.
“Well, I think that the solution’s clear, isn’t it? Draco, you should take Potter to the Ball. Save him from the world and himself.” Blaise placed his chin in his palm as he leaned in lazily.
“You’ll be on a liquid diet for a few more days until the tenderness fades. Do you have any other questions?”
Draco’s head shot up when he heard quick footsteps towards their direction. He stumbled forward. He had to divert them, bring them away from Pansy until he could speak to her privately. He would talk her down from her foolishness, he would help her to see the error of her ways, he would—“Hermione,” he greeted breathlessly, catching her immediately when they collided, his reflexes fast from the adrenaline, his heart nearly leaping out of his throat when his mind processed the gravity of meeting his friend.
"Yeah. Figured that we forgot more than we learnt in the war," Weasley commented, the carelessness of it taking Draco by surprise. He looked to Potter, only to find himself already under scrutiny.
," he emphasised as he looked at Malfoy while walking. "But I apologise for scaring you. And I accept your apologies." He grinned at Malfoy, knocking the side of his arm against him in amusement.
"No, you didn't. I haven't had French food at all." Harry's brows were twisted as he tried to remember the meals he had had with Draco.
Harry snapped to sudden consciousness on the dark wooden floor to the sight of Draco centimetres away from his face. He jerked backwards as he catalogued his surroundings perfunctorily. He was topless in the eighth year common room, his mouth was sour, and Draco was asleep beside him. There was a blanket thrown haphazardly over them.
The Prophet previously covered that Draco Malfoy was auditing the Aurors as part of his mind-numbingly boring job in the Ministry's Workplace Efficiency and Extraordinary Productivity (WEEP) department. According to sources, the heir to the Malfoy's fortunes has submitted his report on workplace improvements to the Head Auror, Gawain Robards, two weeks into his attachment. WEEP reports directly to the Minister for Magic.
Harry lifted himself off the doorframe to stand before him. “Let me,” he said, his voice rough as he placed his hands over Draco’s. Draco barely registered the callouses on Harry’s hands—his heart starting to rabbit at a frenzied pace, his legs weak from the developments. He dropped his hands.
"All clean," Harry announced as he dropped his bag onto his bed, gesturing for Malfoy to open the present.
Mr Dearborn smiled at the young boy. "And now you have the same, don't you? Draco spent two weeks saving me," he said, turning to address Potter.
Privately, Harry worried if his tirade would only set Draco further from Pansy's favour. It had been evident yesterday that Pansy had been similarly gunning for Draco as she did him, and they were supposedly friends. Harry watched as Pansy suddenly slapped the table and started gesturing at Draco's face–oh crap–the Slytherins were grinning at him. He quickly shoveled more eggs into his mouth just for something to do. Should he sleep with his wand in hand if tonight in case Pansy came to slit his throat? He peeked at the happenings, unsurprised to see Draco cowering as Pansy began to list off her fingers while the Slytherins nodded in agreement. Draco seemed contrite as he worried at his lips, and Harry felt a wave of sympathy for him.
"Because it's you," Narcissa replied evenly, "he'll always have time to think about you."
"Yeah," Harry replied quickly as he desperately tried to keep his expressions in check. He stared at Hermione in amazement, amused when she refused to meet his eyes even while she continued supervising the name-drawing.
"Blaise, can I be Malfoy's Potions partner? I need help and Malfoy's the best," he rushed out as the Slytherins froze at the doorway, taking in the tension with guarded expressions.
"No, no. I'm just curious," Potter defended quickly. "I was wondering if you were going to be reading again, or whether you would be going out, since you look dressed for it, you know?" Potter was clearly flustered as he went to drag his hand through his hair before stopping when he remembered that he had his hair up in a messy bun.
Malfoy looked stricken.
! My robes are old but can we not get new ones? :( I want them to regret inviting me. :(
Anyway, it really doesn't matter. I'm just glad that you
"No way," Draco said in disbelief while Hermione's frown returned.
"Get them together," Hermione instructed when it was obvious that they had subdued all of the perpetrators. Harry was surprised to see a Ravenclaw prefect on the ground as they lined the seven students up. He gathered the fallen wands.
He had shaped the cookies and iced them to look like Malfoy's friends and Hermione, Ron and himself, and it had turned out so well that even Hermione had cooed over them.
"So you like it?" Harry teased as he reached over to loop an arm around Draco's waist, tilting his head at Draco's leaking erection.
“Yes, well,” Harry said awkwardly. The expression on Malfoy’s face was indecipherable, he looked concerned, a little bit angry and strangely, devastated? It felt like he was intruding in something personal—Malfoy was obviously thinking about the Harry that he knew, but the person in front of Malfoy right now was
wasn't that hard. Honestly, I initially thought that you guys would only rig it once, until you started being so dramatic about the reveals. I mean, worrying what they'll think when they find out that you were their partner?"
Maybe we could visit her when you return? Ron thinks that she's going crazy.
(A three months old Teddy is lying on his back, his chubby limbs flailing as Harry tries to change his diaper. Harry's spectacles are falling off his nose as he bends over Teddy. Teddy kicks his chunky little foot into Harry's throat and Harry's frown dissolves, his eyes crinkling as a smile spreads across his face.)
Which reminded Harry—"I'm sorry about the-" he waved his hand weakly as he mimed burrowing underground. It was incredibly rude to scope someone's wards without permission, but it was so hard to resist. "Occupational hazard," he said as he combed his hair backwards sheepishly.
Thanks for the styling offer, but I've already gotten Hermione's help. Was worried that you'd tell my date what I'll be wearing. xxxxxxxxx
"You guys really are Gryffindors, aren't you? Incessant and so terribly earnest," Pansy smiled wolfishly as she licked her lips. "Let's go somewhere private," she said, her tone dripping with seduction as she pulled Hermione and Ron along.
; we should—"
"That's reasonable," Harry said quickly, ashamed that he had requested for Malfoy's cookies, yet also deeply pleased and embarrassed that Malfoy seemed to really enjoy them. "I'm sorry for being so weird about it," he said, waving Malfoy off when he started to interrupt.
"They probably figured that the proper letterheads would bypass the wards," Draco said as he laced his fingers between Harry's, intent on cataloguing the feeling of Harry around him—the muscled torso against his back, the warm arm around him. Memories of these few months would help him through whenever Harry called their arrangement off. He could not imagine experiencing such casual intimacy with anybody else.
Harry James Potter closes his eyes slowly as he takes a deep breath. When he opens them, a relaxed and lopsided smile spreads across his lips. He raises his brows in challenge at the viewer.
"Haven't had enough of bossing me around?"
“The Gryffindor rides the Hippogriff, the Slytherin kills the Hippogriff, and the Hufflepuff
“Oh finally,” Ron exclaimed excitedly, withdrawing the hand he had around Hermione when the food appeared.
- - - - -
"Oh, right. They're a laugh," Harry agreed. "Do you think that you'll get anything today?" He asked, jogging a bit to catch up with Malfoy.
Potter coloured as he burrowed into his scarf. Draco reached over to help obscure Potter's face, tucking the top of Potter's scarf into the top of Potter's spectacles.
Pulling his jumper off, Malfoy's reluctance to open the gift finally struck him.
"Bugger off," Potter groused as he inspected the Potter crest on the cufflinks closely. "How did you get this?"
3. Cologne
He traced the familiar print of François Gérard's painting of "Cupid and Psyche" on its cover, marvelling at how smooth the paper felt. Was this Muggle paper? He wondered if Harry would know—the slight amusement evaporated when he flipped open the flimsy pieces of paper and read the short introduction.
- - - - -
? Oh, you think that you're so funny." Harry said, his voice getting nearer as he followed him.
"I'll work hard! And I'll study!" Harry tacked on quickly when Zabini merely raised a cool brow at him. "Please," he said, not above begging to make Malfoy spend time with him.
"For old time's sake, why not?" He replied, acutely aware that it was the first time Malfoy had ever joked with him. Harry was worried that he would scare Malfoy away with a wrong word.
- Meet more people overseas!!!!!!!
"Yes, I—" he stopped himself. He had never imagined that he would ever speak so plainly about his feelings. For the longest time, he had lost himself in his plots to convince Harry that he was worthy of his time and love, only to convey his affection through his hands, his tongue, and his body. He had entered the arrangement with his eyes open as a contractor of professional services, and there was no space for his feelings. His flights of fancy were a disgrace, but it was worse to trigger the termination for convenience clause in their contract. "The letters reminded me that I was unworthy of your time, that our relationship is a contractual agreement. I forget that all this is fake so often, and I would think about seeing you next all the time, about our home and how many children we could have, and I would think about it when I was with you, when you were gone, and the letters helped me to remember that it's not my future nor my present reality."
He would just peek around the tapestry before continuing on his merry way, just enough to tease Pansy about them. It would surely be someone embarrassing, or Pansy would have—he froze at his friend’s breathy moan of her lover’s name, his outstretched hand trembling when a voice responded. It was worse than anyone his mind could ever imagine.
Headmistress McGonagall was unrelenting and entirely unmoved by his strop. Even to ensure his physical well-being, making him Head Boy was an extreme measure. It was downright barking, when she had disregarded his tattered reputation and unhelpfully advised him to condense the schedule for his individual apology sessions with his schoolmates. The carelessness of her 'wisdom' was appalling – with a list of close to eighty schoolmates he planned to apologise to in person, and eight classmates scheduled for meeting in the first week, it was already stretching on sincerity. He could hardly be expediting anything!
"Stones!" He greeted his fellow prefect coolly as he combed his fringe back, quickly thinking of a reasonable explanation before the boy ran off, likely to embellish on and share what he had seen. He grimaced as Potter continued jabbing him in the small of his back with the end of his broom. He backed towards his friend in warning.
"Alright Weasley. I'll drop you an owl for that appointment. You wouldn't know what hit you when you put custom dress robes on," Pansy promised the redhead as she patted Draco lightly in acknowledgement. "Off you pop, darlings," she dismissed the Gryffindors after she had gotten her share of smirking at the awestruck Golden Trio. "Gotta send the boyfriend off properly." She tilted her chin in Blaise's direction, waving them off jauntily as the trio said their sincere Gryffindor goodbyes to them.
Harry placed a hand on his thigh in warning. "I've said that it's fine. Draco's doing me a favour, and I trust him."
"A splash of milk and three sugars. Was I wrong?" Mrs. Malfoy said as she squeezed a bit of lemon in hers.
"Oh. Is Ron going to be there?" Draco joked, nervous whenever Potter mentioned spending time together over on Fridays and the weekend. He had volunteering sessions arranged on the days they were allowed to leave the school, and he would always make weak excuses or change the topic abruptly whenever Potter tried to include him for gatherings.
Pansy hummed in agreement as she slipped her arm into his waiting one. They waved goodbye to their friends, and Draco looked heavily at Harry, hoping that he would understand.
"No, the resonance!" He said impatiently as he tried to think about his first words with Draco.
"Badly," Malfoy replied with an eye roll. "Pansy’s bent on maximum debauchery, and all I want to do is sleep," he sighed as he squeezed Harry's consoling hand on his knee.
act." She kept pace with Draco's long strides easily.

“And finally, the best for the last!” Teddy exclaimed as he skipped towards a dark grey shop in glee.
“It’s okay, it’s okay” he repeated, petting Draco’s hair when the boy continued to blubber into the curve of his neck. Harry’s mind was spinning over the developments that had led to this point. Had the note in his present set Draco off? Or was it Harry’s overdone present? Did Draco suddenly think about what Pansy had made them do during the party?
"It'll be fun to see the Malfoys among the redheads," Potter laughed, folding his arms as he settled more comfortably. Draco wondered idly when he had become a pillow, but did not have the heart to jostle Potter, who looked to be in need of a good rest. "Maybe we could catch a movie if you're available. Since we're both in London."
"So if I'm the deviant one, you're the sexy one?"
- - - - -
"Isn't Parkinson coming down again today?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes as he pushed a crumb on his bottom lip into his mouth. “It’s only just after eleven, Potter.”
"Much better than sitting idly in your hotel?" Draco asked blandly as he stepped around a couple that were kissing noisily with fervent moans.
Harry really couldn't believe the gall of Ron.
Harry nearly keeled over in shock when Malfoy laughed—a deep, genuine laughter with crinkly eyes and all—as he leaned backwards into Teddy’s embrace.
Person does not recognise Harry Potter!!!!!!
"It's
Harry's eyes darted to the Muggle oven in the corner. "Oh, alright, thanks, Mrs. Malfoy."
"If it's even covered positively."
"Happy Birthday, Harry," she smiled at him as she squeezed his calf gently. "May the year be filled with health, purpose, love and lightness."
Draco couldn't help but think that the present universe was actually more bizarre than the others.
, I am interested in fashion, and I also require more than just looking at models to get my jollies." He rolled his eyes at Potter's prudish embarrassment. "
"You, go sit with Potter so Blaise can't touch you. You, sit on your bloody hands because you're a fucking wanker. Bloody start already before I blackout from this stupidity," she kicked her friends lightly with her foot as she helped herself to Firewhiskey straight from the bottle.
"Maybe a book? Or something regarding Potions?" Hermione suggested when she noticed Harry's mounting anxiety. "Does he need anything else?"
Harry placed a hand on Malfoy's shoulder to hold him steady, overcome by ridiculousness as Malfoy alternated between peeking at the happenings and hiding his face in Harry's knee all the while giggling to himself.
“It hurt so bad during the reveal,” Draco said as he looped his hand around Harry’s neck. “I fell over and broke my nose, and I thought
Harry burst into laughter as he shook his fist. "That's the end of Harry Potter."
Draco's eyes widened, clutching desperately onto Potter's windbreaker when he nearly stumbled onto the busy road from the push. Straightening up with a deep sigh, he smoothed his hair back into place while Potter looked on silently in guilt.
Draco gaped at her in shock.
There is a flash of skin before the picture replays.
Harry slapped his thigh in laughter when Brocklehurst gamely got onto her knees and crawled towards Padma who was seating two seats away from her. Padma was blushing as she reached for Brocklehurst's hand.
"Ah, now it's just like your hair too!" Potter beamed as he handed the crayon over to his ecstatic godson.
" He flailed in frustration.
Despite the casualness, Draco Malfoy, who is also friends with the rest of the Golden Trio, their gang of insipid Gryffindors and the occasional spunky Ravenclaw, looked unconcerned, smiling as he listened to Harry Potter. They each had a full English breakfast.
- - - - -
“Oh, look! Blaise is calling me. Goodbye!” Ron announced, picking up his plate as he scampered away immediately to avoid Harry's ire.
Draco nodded in agreement. "You were always great at being insufferable even at school. Here," he offered a bite of his dessert to Harry.
"Are you done, Harry?" She asked.
"No way!" Harry exclaimed as he tried his best to not fall onto Ron. Inebriated, Malfoy was not only chatty and more dramatic, but also terribly floppy.
The camera pans across a minimalist looking café, the lighting warm and the patterned yellow cushions on the benches inviting. A pair of hands are icing a round pink pastry with bunny ears. The steady hands draw a set of chocolate eyes and a soft curling mouth, before moving to the next.
"Well, Ron isn't as helpless as you," Draco defended before stealing a kiss that quickly deepened. Afterwards he would lament that he hadn't properly recorded their first kiss as a couple mentally, and Harry would disagree about their timeline, but it was still chaste for the short moment.
Draco poured hot water onto the teapot from the enchanted kettle before lifting the now-warm lid. He filled the teapot with water. His hands were steady as he then drained the pot evenly onto the filter and the pitcher.
"Of course!" Teddy replied as he continued to scribble studiously with his white crayon on the Muggle book with its bleached papers. "This is a Draco dragon so it has white scales, like your hair."
could be a junior expert," Harry said with a pleased smile.
8. Say that I had a good time
"Not sure if I'm the best company, honestly," Potter joked with a soft smile, as he removed his shoes clumsily. "I only know Draco the Malfoy and nothing else," he raised his brows at Draco significantly as he set the dessert boxes down. Pressing his knees onto the mat, a wide smile with too much teeth suddenly settled across Potter's face as he crawled towards Draco with a strange glint in his eyes.
“Merlin, it’s ridiculous,” Draco swore under his breath as he replaced the vial in Harry’s hand impatiently with a concentrated bath concoction that boasted calming and muscle relaxing properties.
"If this is one of your games, this isn't the time," he said while Hermione tried to hold him back. She quickly cast a Muffliato around them as she dispersed the crowd around them.
- - - - -
Harry tried his best react normally when Malfoy unwrapped the present–a pair of blue socks with cartoon Harry Potter faces over them.
"That's good. You did well, Draco," Luna said, squeezing his arm right at the harness that had held the arrow he used on Pansy. "I thought that I would have to interfere again after you dissuaded Pansy yesterday."
Potter was seemingly startled by his vehemence. "No! No! Why would you think that?" He defended as he gestured wildly. "I do, but you just seem so happy whenever you have dessert, so I wanted to leave more for you." Potter trailed off into a mumble.
Harry looked up to complain to Hermione about the paper when he finally registered the grave expression on his friend's face. He watched in confusion as Hermione frowned, her eyes widening as she pointed her jaw at the hat slightly.
Harry
"Treats are at the fireplace where you came in," Harry tilted his head when the owl started to look about.
"No, the groping thing."
"En garde!" Draco returned as he wielded his broom like an éppée, using his dusty fencing skills on Potter. Feinting before he moved in for an attack, Draco froze when a loud cough sounded from behind him.
Draco pretended to consider, "eternal glory and a peck on the cheek."
"I really wouldn't know," he replied as he looked away quickly, eyes darting to Granger before settling onto Draco once more.
Harry huffed. "Ta, Malfoy. You ruined my fun anyway. But you really should see the sort of post I get back home," he made a face at the memory of it. "Why can't everyone be like you?" He bumped his shoulder against Malfoy's in amusement, laughing when Malfoy pushed him away exasperatedly.
"Good job," Hermione announced blandly, eyes never leaving her tome of a book.
Anyhow, Christmas with the Weasleys had been similarly enjoyable. Molly and Arthur had been hospitable, and his mother had enjoyed the expanded adult company. In true rule number five fashion, Draco had thanked Harry for the tall stack of Muggle behavioural economics and university psychology textbooks without reading too much to the thoughtfulness of the gift. The haul that Draco received had been amazing, albeit more dominated by books than in past years. He had also gotten a
Hermione beamed at him while Weasley watched on with wry amusement as he combed through Hermione's bushy hair with his fingers.
“One for each year of obsession,” Greg muttered under his breath as he set the boxes up on the counter.
"You'll probably be able to beat me in the next match though," Harry interrupted as they passed a suit of armour. Draco looked at him in surprise. Had his skills really improved?
Potions that afternoon had been good. Malfoy had not let him handle the brewing, but he had been reasonable–almost
He needed to do something quickly to end the thrall of the arrow without jeopardizing the friendship with Harry that he had come to value so much.
Draco sniffed distastefully when he noticed the stack of letters on the table. The populace had warmed to his favourable media coverage ever since Blaise had begun dating Ginny, but to be exploring a non-platonic relationship with their Saviour was too much for them. With his attachment to the Aurors, hateful correspondence had been directed away from the Ministry and to the Manor. When it became clear that their letters were unsent due to the wards, the more spiteful individuals had commandeered letterheads and owls from their workplaces. The grievances were ceaseless, and Draco could not stop himself from opening them.
“I’ll take any available time,” he said earnestly, "I was serious about Muggle London too."
"No worries, Parkinson. Just hoping for his Potions genius," Harry said casually as he returned to his bag, wondering if he should pass Malfoy the apple from last week.
"Even with Bainbridge & Daughters?" he asked.
"You're horrid, Malfoy."
"Erm, do you want it?" He asked quietly. Malfoy jumped as if he had just remembered his presence.
"Perhaps Miss Hopkins could help?" He looked at the more level-headed student of the two. "Alright, I'll see both of you next week. Hurry along now," he said when he received a small nod from the second year student. Warding his drawers, he tapped on the table as they whispered furiously to each other while heading to the door. Mentally screaming for them to move faster, he combed his hair back and straightened his collar for want of something to do—it was improper to be seen running out scarcely after the girls had left. Bouncing on the balls of his feet, he imagined them turning round the corner, passing the tapestry hiding the flight of stairs that would bring him back to his quarters.
"What's it?" He asked, nervous when Malfoy continued to shuffle around the box with a frown.
Draco's jaw fell apart incredulously. "I'd quite rather choke you, thank you very much!" His neck started to flush as he looked at the tables around them in scandalised shock. .
Draco raised an eyebrow in confusion. "Obviously? How does this have to do with–have you just realised-are you upset at being bisexual?" He asked, completely lost. "Potter, you can't - bisexuals aren't actually promiscuous or greedy you know," he explained hotly.
Walking back to their dorms after a sumptuous weekend breakfast at the Great Hall, Potter bumped his shoulder against Draco's while recounting the Quidditch match he had caught on the Wireless the day before.
"Erm," he said, trying to free his hand.
It was probably of note that kisses from one Harry Potter could distract Draco Malfoy from his dessert(s).
Harry moaned incoherently as he pressed his eyes closed. He wished that they would stop arguing. Also, Malfoy liked his apples peeled, quartered, and cored. Anyone would know this if they spent just a little bit of time on Malfoy.
Harry hummed in agreement as he savoured the sweetness of his own gift. He had sat through similar rants with Hermione to know what was expected of him.
“That’s a nice problem to have,” he said, and it was, regardless of the anxiety and the planning that had begun in November as he watched his peers catalog their hobbies and personalities.

"Why not?"
Draco complied, staring straight at him in nothing but his briefs and an unbuttoned shirt. It was a bizarre conversation and experience, but he had come to expect nothing less from Harry.
3. buy presents for
I apologise for doubting, that was rude of me. Please don't apologise about my clothes anymore. I think we can both agree that you have more than compensated by agreeing to take me on a shopping trip, for a full day, no less!
, you don't flip flip flip through Blaise's magazines, and
Harry nodded quickly. Draco had confided previously that his mother was being shunned by her previous circle of high-society wives and she was taking the rejection poorly, working obsessively to salvage the ruined Manor. He knew that Draco was eager to spend time with her, but Harry couldn’t control his desire to see him over the long break.
"I’ll save it for our second date then," Harry smiled brightly as he opened his mouth for Draco’s fork..
Amidst the comfortable silence that fell upon them, Draco twisted his fingers as he warred with the urge to poke Harry in the face. Harry looked too peaceful lying on his lap, and the urge to tease a frown was strong. If it were Blaise on his lap, Draco would already have pinched his nose, and they would have ended up in a tussle while Vincent, Greg, and Pansy looked on judgmentally.
"Hi," Harry said as he dropped into the chair opposite Malfoy in the library.
Afterwards, Harry would wonder if he had fallen apart in Narcissa's arms due to the general deprivation of maternal love in his life. Sure, he had been saved by his mother's love and sacrifice, but there were many moments where he would have selfishly trade it all for her physical presence instead, to hell with all of the wizarding community.
"I'll do it," Harry interjected.
There was nothing to do when Harry wasn't around. He would turn in early tonight. He had to reorganize the Auror archives tomorrow, and it would take his sanity and then some to complete.
"Yeah, she's been busy with fittings for the entire school, but I don't have to meet her every day, you know?" Draco replied with a frown, confused by the direction of their conversation.
Draco stared at the offering in shock. "This is the first and last time, okay?" He warned as he took the gifts from her. Thanking him profusely, they quickly disappeared, leaving Draco to himself as he inspected the Parisian chocolates with grudging approval. Plucky Gryffindors with a good taste were as rare as invisibility cloaks.
Reaching for the Muggle tissues that he kept on his bedside table, Harry dabbed at the tears gently while Draco curled up on his bed. Vanishing the snot away as he cleaned Draco’s face, he squeezed Draco’s hands in consolation.
Falling to his chair, he felt his eyes sting. He glared desperately at the letter as he tried to control himself. It was hopeless. Conjuring a quick Patronus, he sent it off to Harry, requesting for his company if possible. He needed to be held; he needed to talk to someone. The letter offered no platitudes on guidance or reapplication. It taunted him mercilessly when his pride needed to be coddled for a few moments more.
"Cissa, are you baking again?" His aunt exclaimed from his right. His mother nodded, a look of shy pleasure coming over her features.
Draco exhaled in amusement. "Wouldn't it be a shame if you didn't come up top in the revised Documentation, Forms, and Filing course?"
Draco scoffed. "I've forgotten that dating a Gryffindor has addled your brains." He looked around the table helplessly for support, only to find none. "Harry, your friends have lost their minds."
Draco's brows met his hairline as he looked at Ginny in disbelief. He was stunned to see similar thoughtful looks around the table. "Blaise, you're the only other Slytherin here. Tell them that it's stupid, please."
"Well, you have me now, does it count?" Harry asked as he settled his hand on Draco's waist, an earnest expression on his face.

“I'll probably need a little more than that since we'll be missing three lessons," Harry suggested hopefully. This way he would definitely be able to see Draco even if he didn't want to visit the Burrow.
"Stop molesting my wards already," Draco complained as he unlocked his door.
Harry frowned at the comment. “I hate it when people tell me that,” he said sullenly as they fell into step. “I’m trying very hard to be the Harry that they want but it’s never enough. It’s like this Harry doesn’t matter, you know?”
"I like it," he said stupidly, immediately wincing at the amusement he received. "I mean, you look good."
"I'm one of a kind, Potter," he said as he threw his hair over his shoulder, amusement twinkling in his eyes. "But really, I grew up with Harry Potter stories and I wanted to be your friend so badly until I realised that you were an entitled piece of shit that had everything going his way. It's lonely being the only Potter's ego exterminator or something."
Thank you for spending Friday with me. I enjoyed the tour of your nonprofit and I see why and how you guys are defining the medical and Potion world. Enclosed is a picture of the medical journals of your papers since you refuse to believe me. I have also used
"Save those excuses for Gandie," Draco smirked before holding Teddy's hand as they crossed the road. As he did previously, Potter held onto Teddy's other hand.
With the week’s lessons being tied to the Winter Solstice, the Great Hall had been dressed up with mismatched decorations from its occupants. Wonky stars, uneven candles and wrinkly snowflakes floated above the tables while holly berries and sprigs of varying freshness lined the perimeter of the room.
Ron beamed at them shamelessly–after living in a tent together for months on end, they had lost the concept of ‘sensitive topics’ entirely. Ron would tell Harry later–to Harry’s agreement–that he had gifted the lubes and the magazines out of practicality.
"This is so bad for my skin. And my mouth tastes like kneazle piss," Draco whispered as they stepped around their classmates. He summoned their clothes, sighing when Harry's shirt shot out from behind the couch.
Ron held a hand up in his direction. "Everybody knows that you and Luna are just friends. Maybe that's why the letters keep coming."
He had yet to resume his usual workload, but the job of past-Harry was what he had always desired. His Auror team was competent and close knit, their strong bonds forged from tough cases. However, Harry had thought that he would have had a lover by thirty. He understood that his work was consuming, but surely there was somebody he could share his life with? What if another six years passed? Would he still be alone in his cavernous house when Teddy finished school, when Ron and Hermione had their second child?
Ron made a frustrated noise as he let Pansy go. "We're just having a bit of a chat. Can't we have a bit of privacy?"
Draco startled in guilt at the look of concern on Potter's face, realising that he had withdrawn into himself, ruining any conversation that they were having. "Yes, I'm alright. Just realised how small the tart was. How do you find your mille crêpe?" He enquired politely, having recommended it to Potter.
"Are you all returning to Hogwarts?" Potter asked, gesturing at the Slytherins before returning to look at Draco.
Harry had been chatting with Greg when the email from Malfoy came in with an insistent buzz. He hadn’t even been the one to configure it for Malfoy specifically—past-Harry had apparently taken his communications job so seriously that Malfoy had a special buzz for himself. He scanned the reply quickly. It was terribly brief and business-like, but it was the first direct correspondence he had from Malfoy since the fundraiser.
"Not a single strand out of place, Malfoy," Ron said as he sorted his notes according to urgency.
"Bunch of traitors," Ron replied, downing his firewhiskey with a careful swallow. "George wanted to acquire the shop beside Scrivenshaft's in time for Christmas, but the seller was being difficult."
"I was thinking the same thing, but the weight of history is against that hypothesis," Granger suddenly replied from behind them.
"Yeah, definitely." Potter agreed as they continued to walk closer to the Eiffel Tower.
present
Harry tested his own present for spells, frowning when it came clean. There was no reason that he should be getting another gift when his partner had otherwise come across as fairly normal, if not in the possession of a twisted sense of humour.

“And then it became an antiques shop, before it ended up as a hat shop,” Teddy said as he pulled him along.
"I think that it looks great," he said as he winked at an incredulous Harry.
Draco was changing into his ghastly yellow volunteering shirt when he heard someone entering their dorm. Emerging from the shirt as he smoothed the length down his torso, he raised an eyebrow at his wide eyed friend at the doorway.
of the arrow to ask Harry on a date. Harry grinned at him conspiratorially as the suggestion sunk in, and the thrill and pleasure that coursed through him almost made Draco stagger. The stretch of his skin eased by a fraction, and Draco was immensely grateful despite how slight it was. It was impossible to trick the magic on him when they both knew that it didn’t count as a date.
- Post letters during start of Hogwarts term (with worried parents)
1. Dress nicely (Hermione)
"If you nothing," Malfoy replied as he vanished the parchment paper Harry had used as a wrapper. He sent the note away to a drawer in his bedside table before pulling the corner of his comforter, already preparing to turn in.
"You'll bloody get yourself killed one day," Malfoy grumbled as he gestured for Harry to go ahead when the tests came clean.
"Your first Harry Potter themed merchandise," he joked as he gestured Malfoy to throw the present over. He had purchased the socks on a whim while flipping a discarded catalogue in the library. Knowing Malfoy's picky tastes, the quality of the wool had been a great relief.
Draco selected an empty cabin a few doors down from the hubbub. Frosting the glass before pulling down the blinds, he silenced the exterior for extra measure as he sat down. So far so good. Draco pinched the bridge of his nose as he sunk into the cabin seats. Due to the trio, he had yet to be harassed, which had been a possibility that he had never considered entirely. Trust Pansy and her social manoeuvres. Sighing to himself, Draco unshrunk his bag and took out his reading material and packed lunch.
Draco woke to a feeling of ache throughout his body. Despite the disorientation, the sharp smell of disinfectant spells and scratchy sheets told him where he was. He groaned softly as he moved his legs, jerking when he suddenly remembered the incident that had sent him to St. Mungo’s. His hand flew to his neck.
Enclosed is a book on the Gods of Love in different cultures worldwide. Even though we are disciples of the same master, our manuals and tools are contextualized according to our branches. You can guess the tools of the trade of our family across the cultures. I hope that it will be an interesting read for you.
"Mind my delicate sensibilities, Potter. I hope that you didn't speak to Mother like this."
"Merlin, you're paranoid. It's nothing, honestly. I just had French cuisine this week, and I didn't want a repeat."
Harry blinked at the obvious bitterness in Draco's tone. Perhaps he had really been more blind than he had thought. Did Draco encourage him to follow up on the networks he had made during events to spark a mentorship fervour? Everything had really been in front of him, simply waiting for him to see properly.
"Been waiting forever, Draco," Greg greeted the moment he neared, pulling Draco into a crushing hug. Draco basked in the moment desperately, relishing in the solid presence of his friend.
Draco only hummed as he shook his present, “do you want to go first? No, maybe I should,” he said.
Draco Apparated to the Hogwarts gates ten before two in the morning, slightly tipsy from the drinks the younger volunteers had gone for after dinner. It was the latest that he had ever returned, and he was thankful for the Headmistress' lenient curfew.
"Erm, some people are terribly short sighted," Potter said slowly, unsure of how to defuse the situation. He broke off entirely when the peck Hermione left on Weasley's cheek dissolved into an all-out pecking session.
"Blaise, tell Malfoy that it hurts," Ginny complained when Blaise reached to pet her leg.
Potter nodded. "I couldn't sleep much, and I suddenly woke and–" he looked at Draco before quickly looking away. "I'm gay," Potter blurted out. "Gay, bisexual. I'm bisexual," he corrected himself.
Harry only laughed. He leaned in to press a kiss on Draco's lips. When pulled back, his dimple was deep in his cheek as he beamed at him.
The letter was short. He read it twice over before focusing on the reason of their rejection. What did "lacking in its conclusion" mean? Which essay lacked in its conclusion? Had his application not been strong enough? He had submitted his year's worth of Thought evaluation, and the three newly created Potions where he had worked to influence the mental process of its drinker, or of the people around them. He had scored through libraries of research on Brain, Thought and Love, weaved in Muggle philosophy and scientific research for a holistic review. How could it not be enough?
“And ruin your meal?”
Draco jumped as a hand touched his shoulder. "Potter!" Draco greeted in shock, noting the mirth and intensity on the man's face as he felt his body reflexively clench in excitement.
"Malfoy!" Potter yelped, scuttling to the end of the tunnel, scrambling to his feet when he entered the common room. His hair was messier than usual after an extra Potions classes with Draco, after a long day of school.
"Oh," Draco said quietly as his cheeks pinked. "I'm free on Friday then."
"Thursday or Friday, you mean. There's only two days left in the week."
"Poor Potter," Draco finally exhaled in laughter, stepping forward to tuck a loose curl behind Harry's left ear.
“Well, you can’t say such things without offering me a chance to check. If you're not going to show me your arse, at least turn around, will you?”
2. Splitting up into groups and identity is important
Malfoy continued to chuckle as he combed his long fringe backwards. Harry's stomach twisted in hurt at Malfoy's callous response.
“It’s fine,” Harry pushed a frustrated hand into his hair. “I didn’t really mean it—”
Harry's desperation to impress Malfoy with his good behaviour helped him to focus and complete his Charms essay in a sitting. Setting his textbook aside, he checked the item off the to-do list Hermione had made for him. He combed his hair back in frustration as he despaired over the remaining items.
"Well, if you didn't have to be so embarrassing you wouldn't be in this predicament. You can consider releasing me, or using your left hand," Draco raised an unimpressed brow.
"Erm, so I was a little concerned about how you were doing, and they wanted me to talk to you, but I didn't know how to start, so they rigged it. So that I could do something for you. But I didn't know! I was confused when it happened!" He defended as he raised his both hands reflexively in innocence.
"Since we're already here, we could pack a set of clothes and your WEEPing robes? Or I could swing back before meeting you here if you would rather your house."
"Going for a jog?" Draco asked, as casually as he would about a patient's well-being. He hummed pleasantly as Potter replied with a confused throaty noise that made him sound like a cornered crup.
Harry snorted to himself at Hermione's gall in making herself one of the judges.
Draco hummed in understanding. His cousin had talked about her plans to visit the Kalimantan rainforest during the year end break, and perhaps there was no one better than her who could understand his desire for the unfamiliar.
“Well, why should I ask for a second date when the first isn’t good? If you want me to ask for a second date, you’d better make sure that everything goes well," he titled his head as he looked at Harry challengingly.
"Thank you very much!" The quieter of the two girls replied as she pulled her friend away.
“I wouldn’t,” Harry said earnestly as he looked at Teddy in commiseration. He also smiled at Malfoy who was looking at him. “I’ll be back every day if I can help it. I’m glad that I stopped by.”
"I woke up today, and you were sleeping in your bed without drawing the curtains, and you didn't have your shirt on." Potter's face was red as he continued, seemingly unable to stop himself now that he had finally begun. "And I stood there watching you, wanting to touch and hold you so badly, I thought that my heart would explode from my chest. I got really afraid of myself. I don't want to lose what we have, but I want so much more, so I decided to not talk to you until I could stop myself, but not talking to you is worse, and I'm sorry," Potter finished lamely, wiping his tears before walking away by himself.
10. Run off
Draco had returned from Training and Assessment at GOSH to find Sneezy excitedly hopping about with a Hogwarts letter in hand.
“Draco!” Harry called out, running to hide behind him in laughter, leading Ginevra’s snowstorm to both of them. Draco waved the spell off in fond amusement, threatening her with a rain cloud and smirking when she gestured rudely at him.
Please find enclosed a draft of the contract from my lawyer. A draft has been similarly shared with Bainbridge & Daughters.
He felt nervous about the possibilities before him. Deciding to settle down was the first step. When he could no longer hide, he had to work through his loneliness, his jealousy and the discontent. The mind-healer Narcissa referred had challenged him to stop waiting for his soulmate, and to find himself beyond them. There were so many things that he could do instead of searching, or waiting to be found.
"When the answer became obvious, I realised that Ron had probably rigged it twice for you to draw my name, which was why you had your hand in the hat for so long. Everything finally came together," he waved his fingers proudly with a smirk.
"It's okay to not know what you're doing. It's perfectly normal," she repeated when Harry started to cry harder at the empathy and consideration that he was receiving. It was an emptiness and frustration that he had never let himself explore properly before.
Draco moved his quill back and forth under his chin,
"Well, are we? You were withholding a second date, so I can’t speak about the coupling bit just yet."
Draco gaped at the solid performance before rolling his eyes as held Harry's hand up in his. "I already love you, Harry. I just didn't think that I deserved you," Draco said softly as he felt Harry squeeze his hand as they continued to walk once more.
“And I know that it was creepy of me to watch you open your gift while pretending that I didn’t know anything, but I
Draco tried to reign in the smile threatening to spread across his lips. He deeply enjoyed the nights spent together, when all of their friends were gone and he had all of Harry’s attention to himself. Whenever Harry sat with him in the quiet of their common room, it made him feel
"He already does that for me." He gestured for Blaise and Neville to give their best shot.
"Oh. You look like you're going out."
"I'll come over then. You can brew while I work on my reports."
"Broad? Erm, sure."
"You wish."
"Granger's horribly indecisive, did you know? It took her close to an hour to choose one present, and Weasley's a complete pushover, standing around even while complaining. Bloody Gryffindors, honestly. They're both so enthusiastic that it's almost pitiful."
"Well, Harry doesn't," Ginny said.
Draco huffed in amusement as he poured the failed potion into a flask for storage. Stowing it away in his stasis chamber, he was smiling regardless of the disappointment at Harry's earnestness. “Shall we go? I’ll reward you for that comment.” Having Harry around made it hard for him to wallow in his misery. Even though the research process was lonely and frustrating—he would have entertainment during his long hours of brewing, and Harry always encouraged him to push his boundaries.
- - - - -
"Yes, by Blaise!" Malfoy hissed, fists clenched. His eyes were bright with anger.
"Bold of you to presume that I’ll ask for a next date."
"Urgh," Teddy groaned as he pressed his face into Draco's robes to clean his face.
Harry stared at him. He looked at the handkerchief, before returning to look at Draco. "Oh, you bloody—" he complained, before the laughter overtook him. The both of them laughed together, their respective gifts crumpled and forgotten on their laps.
Draco yelped as Potter forcefully dragged him towards the Arc de Triomphe, heedless of the frowning pedestrians.
people?".
I can’t share my manual with you. Our manuals and tools are only visible to ourselves and our team, and you will come to learn that it cannot be passed around, duplicated, or copied.
"Mm?"
Draco glared at Pansy from across the table, desperately trying to catch Pansy’s eyes while she leaned into Hermione’s space, heedless of Draco's warning to avoid both of them entirely. How could she be so shameless? Pansy had always been uninhibited in her whims, but did she not understand the gravity of the situation? He pushed his mulled mead aside as he made to stand, pausing when Harry’s arm suddenly looped around his.
Draco narrowed his eyes at him before turning back to his work with a huff.
Harry twisted his fingers.
"No, that's you apparently," Malfoy replied smoothly with a grin.
Draco felt his heart break as he looked at the pained slope of Harry’s strong shoulders, the tears that he had caused, that he could not wipe away. He had no good explanation to provide. He had been careless and selfish, and how could he explain that he needed the letters to hurt himself? His eyes warmed as he also began to tear up quietly. The space between the bed and the window of the tiny hospital room was their uncommunicated feelings towards one another. Too consumed by the guilt of having hurt the other, they were too helpless to console each other.
"Well, firstly there was the chocolate frog card that you were looking for. It seemed too convenient that Harry would get something that made you so excited. Secondly, it was how Harry’s partner knew how to circumvent the gift exchange spells with the annual subscription. I was initially convinced that it was a Slytherin, but none of us–” he smirked at Harry, “care that much about Harry that much. Well except for me,” he corrected when Harry made a noise of protest.
"Just sort it," Draco said as he nodded at Harry's wand on the table.
“You’re lying to yourself and it’s not healthy,” Greg said smoothly, his face devoid of judgement as he stepped aside for his employee. “Say hello to Draco, would you? I haven’t seen him for a while too.”
from Molly, which had been nice, but unfortunately incomparable to Worry's. It was however not due to any fault in Molly's character, or the gift. It was simply impossible to outclass Worry, who loved working with cashmere wool.
"Well, it's different! I'll always have time for you, but it's not the same for them. They're
"Honestly, why would Harry Potter care so much about what a random person thinks? Well, because he values the person's opinion deeply. But everybody who mattered loves him anyway, so he doesn't have to worry. So then, who does he care about deeply, but isn't impressed by him?" He gestured at himself airily, smirking when Harry gaped at him for the flawless deduction.
"Shush!" She scolded as she pulled the partitions around Malfoy's bed close. "Also, no visits allowed before seven thirty," she reminded as she led him out of the infirmary by the arm.
Pansy laughed hollowly, shaking her head in pity, her smile thin. "Don't come crawling for me when it's too late," Pansy said before swirling her Slytherin green cloak around her as she left.
"Well, so are you," Potter returned as he helped himself to bangers and mash.
"Hermione, you're scaring Harry," Ron interrupted as he tried to wave the bowls away only for Hermione to slap his hand violently.
"Definitely not," Pansy insisted, pulling Draco along as they walked towards Platform Nine and 3/4. "You wouldn't be betting on that if you actually knew Draco properly."
"I'd like a folder for my forms. Name it
, arguing with Hermione yesterday night had left him feeling too lousy to remember to lock the Floo behind him.
"All ideas from me usually are," Draco declared proudly, laughing when Potter nodded in agreement.
"I am happy," Harry insisted. "It took me long enough to understand what you've always been saying, that there was more to Harry Potter than risking my life. I want to be there for you when you need me," he said as he reached out to hold Draco's hand in his.
- - - - -
Draco jumped, hurriedly hiding the remaining letters when Harry approached the table with an expression of distaste. "What smell?" he asked.
. Gratitude towards a Malfoy was not out of place in the post-war landscape.
Harry felt his heart lurch, his eyes immediately heating up as he watched the note flutter onto the floor. He was ashamed of his presumptuousness.
"Dear Potter, thank you bla bla, bla bla bla, meet the rest of the faculty, what the fuck," he crumpled the letter in his hand as he struggled to sit up. "Potter, she doesn't mean Professor
Dear Draco Lucius Malfoy
7. quit curse breaking (???)
like nothing had happened. Draco had been agonising in bed about Potter's nosiness, when Weasley had suddenly stormed in, face redder than his hair.
"Expelliarmus! Petrificius totalus!" Ron yelled as he brutally stunned multiple students mercilessly while Hermione sent jelly leg jinxes at the students attempting to escape.
Suddenly feeling a pair of eyes on himself, Draco looked up, going faint at the sight of Potter smirking at him, Hermione chattering away on his right as they made their way to their assigned table. Regardless of the discomfort Draco felt at being the source of Potter's amusement, he could not deny that his ex-nemesis was a sight to behold.
"Well, you can't make friends through
I’ll be seeing my date later in Grimmauld at six fifty!!
Draco blinked in shock at the swift turn of matters. Everything had happened so quickly, and it was barely half-past twelve—how was it appropriate to be doing whatever they were doing at this time?
"No, no! I'll do it," Potter exclaimed, shooting up from his dejected slouch.
Headmistress
He laid in bed, staring at the clock as he watched the digits creep closer to seven thirteen. The sky was slowly lightening—Sirius had bragged about reaching St. Mungos with Remus on his flying motorcycle in the cover of the night while his mother was in labour, and Harry suddenly wished that he hadn't pushed Ron and Hermione away—it would have been nice to have somebody wait with him like Sirius had promised. He gripped his comforter tightly as the solitude he had previously requested slowly gave way to loneliness. It would get better though. He would find his soulmate and he wouldn't be alone anymore. Harry wiped his eyes fiercely as he glared at the clock impatiently.
Draco felt his face heat up at the vulnerable question. Pushing Harry away with a hand on his silly face, he huffed at the laughter he received. "Desist with the mush! Please abide by the established ban, Potter!" He shoved his partner's shoulder when the mocking persisted.
Pushing the shop's glass door open, Draco suddenly fretted. "Are you okay with Chinese?" He asked quickly, suddenly remembering to enquire about Potter's preference. "It's authentic and they even pull their noodles fresh," he explained hurriedly at the hesitation on Potter's face. Healer Zhou had brought them to the shop during their trainee days and Draco had come to crave their beef noodles from time to time. After both his mother and Andromeda agreed that it tasted like the noodles their great grandfather had served, they would often drop by as a family.
I had to put Hermione's research into a table because tables are the nerdiest. Please look at it. 😫
Thanking the maître d'hôtel as they took their seats, Draco watched carefully as Potter reached for the menu without any beat of hesitation. He had been surprised when Potter had asked about his favourite restaurant in Paris, and subsequently insisted that they visit.
Thanking the lady, Draco was awashed with an incredible sense of relief as he left the hall. He should have just done it earlier! With another item finally off his self-improvement list, even the weather felt better. Draco felt his mood lift significantly as he walked towards the bus stop. Hiking his bag idly, Draco’s steps were light and unhurried.
Harry smiled as he felt the warm line of Malfoy against his side. The seating was cramped and he still felt a little cold; but amidst the cacophony of people talking over each other and the uncomfortable press of shrunken gifts against his arse, he was overcome with the joy of having survived the war to revel in the company of friends–both old and new.
"You'll never let it rest, would you?" Draco said as he added the powdered ginger root carefully. "You'll regret choosing something so silly if you do win. Do you want to change your wager?"
Draco found it puzzling to see Potter so conscious about being polite to him, especially when it was a logical statement. "Well, that's true," Draco began, hoping to bolster Potter a bit. "Mother has been getting the elves to introduce a bit more Chinese fare in their repertoire but it's slow going. Honestly, noodles, broth and stir-fry are completely beyond them." He laughed at the memory of the elves' collective horror when they had brought back Chinese condiments such as soy sauce and sesame oil.
“Speak for yourself,” Malfoy rearranged the plates so that the shiny chocolate-coated pastry shaped like a dome was in front of him. “You don’t even treat
"Of course it would. You bloody created
Panic began to crawl over Draco's skin. Should he dismiss Finch-Fletchley immediately to escape Potter's humiliating sympathy? Or should he gesture something rude at Potter? While Draco had been deliberating his next move, Hermione seemed to notice that she had lost her friend's attention, and she turned around with a look of annoyance. Great, now two of the Golden Trio was pitying him. Oh joy, it was now officially three out of three. Draco couldn't remember when he had last been so fortunate.
"But honestly, if it's any comfort, can you imagine having the '
"No, they have to be together!" Teddy insisted, stomping his foot as he pushed Harry's hand away from the rainbow Teddy blob on the tree. Draco had purchased the Wheezes' customisable figurines ornament set, and Teddy had spent the Saturday morning drawing pictures of everyone that he could think of. After Draco had charmed the drawings into tiny ornaments, Harry had discretely carved the individual names of the Weasleys on the otherwise indistinguishable red haired figurines.
"Just only one. I didn't have a lot," Teddy said seriously as he wiped his hand on Draco's lapel. Worry made a noise at the statement, ears flopping as he shook his head at them violently.
I have never been more grateful that Harry Potter saved us all so that we could all live to see this day—Our Wizarding Hero on the Best Dressed List! With obvious influences from his friend and date of the night, Harry Potter is similarly dressed in tailoring genius Winthralls, making a bold statement with dark green velvet and delicate embroidery. Call your bookmakers, can we expect more?
- Mrs. and Mr. Weasley
Draco suddenly thought about his hair. How had it looked to Potter? Draco ran to his dressing table, stricken by the ghastly reflection that greeted him. At least he had seemed to make an impression, he consoled himself desperately, cheered by the memory of Potter unable to comprehend his presence. Fuck, was he now in possession of the knowledge of Potter's personal address? Trust Potter to live in a Muggle neighbourhood. Draco rolled his eyes at the predictability of Gryffindors, completely ignoring the fact that he too was also currently living in one.
"Hermione asked if you had a red to go along with the lasagna from Molly," Harry said, leaning against the door of the dressing room.
Growing up, the tome of Roman classics had been one of his favourite books in the Manor Library and he remembered the story of Cupid and Psyche in the second half of the book. These were surely reminiscent of Cupid's arrows. He knew that the truth was often concealed in stories, events before a writing system passed down through narration, picking up embellishments as it transmitted from one generation to another. After all, didn’t the Muggles think that Merlin was a myth? However, for
"Well, you've only arrived just, haven't you?"
Draco laughed at the nature of their bet. "I took the bus. There was a direct service from my house."
It was just as well that Neville and him were held as references for integrity–because it surely did not apply to Hermione, who had been appointed as Head Girl.
Draco smiled at Potter's enthusiasm, raising a brow when the man fumbled, pausing with palpable hesitation. "I guess that it's sort of like this? Chinese food and the Blacks, sort of." Potter shrugged, his shoulders caving in as he bit his lips.
Malfoy huffed in amusement. "You really should date this boy. He'd piss on you any day."
," he shook his head in amazement, pausing when he noticed Harry staring at him. "Aren't you going to eat your dessert?"
Draco felt his face flame from Potter's unflinching honesty. They were both fully clothed, hands above each other's clothes, but Draco had never experienced such deep intimacy with any of his other lovers—inclusive of the Muggle he had seen throughout the first year of Healer school. He pressed his face into Potter's chest in embarrassment, unable to fathom how he had ended up in Potter's arms, yet too timid to question it in case it disappeared before his eyes.
"How about Defense?"
"Draco, the, erm, calendar," Harry said as he pointed weakly into the cupboard.
4. Encourage them to practice
"Will you be staying in Hogwarts over the holidays?" Draco asked, drawing from the list of questions that he had prepared.
“I’ll buy you a new broom, one that’s better than mine so that you’ll have a handicap when—” he yelped, grabbing Draco when he pretended to stand. He was laughing as he settled back down. “You wouldn’t be too busy for Quidditch after NEWTs, I’m sure.”
Draco had gone white from the responsibility thrust upon him. Upset, he had confronted the Headmistress to relinquish the title after their dismissal. He was not blind to the lack of confidence the student body had in him, nor unaware of the atrocities he had endorsed in his seventh year. To entrust him the role was simply unthinkable.
"Teddy, that's atrocious!" he complained as he pushed the boy away to inspect the damage.
"Would Sneezy and Worry like to follow me to Hogwarts?" Draco asked thickly when he reached the end of the letter, scaring a bit when Worry materialised behind Sneezy, eyes shiny with unshed tears.
"I'll negotiate for a better time," Malfoy said when he noticed Harry's raised brow. Harry laughed in comprehension. His sleep schedule had improved significantly since rooming with Malfoy who would be asleep by ten thirty, and awake at seven thirty.
Arithmancy and Ancient Runes?" Weasley interrupted Draco's discussion with Hermione about their latest assignment.
but Professor
counted and had definitely
"Yeah, sent the whole batch off to Baringstone. Don't know how they think of using their company's stationery to send me mails. It's proper crazy," Harry said as he pulled the covers over himself.
Harry gathered everything quickly, heading for the basins. He needed some space from Malfoy, even though he couldn't stop thinking about him.
"The next time you're doing something questionable like this, you should think about whether I would strangle you when I find out about it. I can't keep giving in just because you're a brat," Harry said seriously when he pulled away.
"It really is," Draco shook his head as he unwound his scarf. "It does get a bit lonely sometimes," he said as he gave Harry a dirty look.
Draco opened the lids to inspect the contents. "This is yours, Potter," he turned around, box in hand to offer Potter when he noticed the man staring contemplatively at his arse, bottom lip between his teeth. Draco's eyes widened in shock, a confused noise escaping his throat. His brain refused to process the situation before him.
The room was heavy with tension. There was scarcely a ring of green in Harry’s eyes as he worked on the buttons slowly. Draco could smell the sandalwood in Harry’s cologne as his arms twitched limply at his sides. He wanted to put them around Harry, but the suddenness and the strength of the urge was confusing.
“Of course. Nobody compares,” Harry said sincerely. There was a literal lemon lookalike atop a tart, complete with the bumpy texture, and on another, a fresh flower was surrounded by berries. Goyle’s creations were a work of art, and Harry’s mouth was already watering at the sight of the selection.
Harry shook his head as he finished his glass of milk. "I'll fetch it for you? You should get some rest. I'll have a shower before I return. You can dry my hair if you're still awake."
"Erm," his eyes jumped from Neville to Lisa Turpin, who was one of Hermione's favourite prefects. He leaned forward to check on Hermione, slumping when Hermione only shook her head helplessly. "Erm, I'm gay, so," he peeked at his roommate guiltily, worried that Malfoy would be disapproving or worse, disgusted. He knew that the wizarding community was accepting of homosexuality, but it was viewed as an inconvenience to Purebloods in their obsession of lineages. He was thankful that Malfoy's expression didn't seem to change.
"No!" The Weasley siblings yelled. Ron looked to Hermione for assistance.
visit the amusement park again."

Photograph caption: Teddy's second stink bomb for the birthday boy. Happy Eighteenth Birthday Harry!
Harry nodded eagerly in agreement. He wouldn’t be able to focus on his own gift if he didn’t stop worrying about Draco’s reaction. He bit his lips while Draco peeled his gift open in his excruciatingly slow speed.
Harry stared at him in disbelief.
Following the noise, Draco skidded around the corner, sighing in exasperation when he saw his little cousin. "Teddy! Inside voice!" Draco scolded, his frown quickly smoothing when his cousin barreled into him in excitement. Picking the boy up easily with a sigh, he combed Teddy's platinum blond fringe backwards lightly as he connected the dots for Teddy's presence in the hospital.
Teddy broke out into a smile as he dropped his menu onto the table with a clatter. "No, I'll get tomato egg noodles!"
Draco set his fork down as he folded his arms in disapproval. "Oh really? Pray tell, Potter, whatever of Finch-Fletchley is nice? Is it his job where he makes money making money for people? Or the sports car that would allow him to partake in the dreadful congestion in London?"
As they trudged along, Draco began to feel guiltier for snapping at Potter. The other looked so frustrated and afraid that even Draco's cold Slytherin heart twinged. Potter kept beginning to say something before chickening out almost immediately.
"You should learn to care for your hair," Draco said quietly, following Harry's overgrown fringe and tucking it behind his ear. His hand slid to the nape of Harry's neck.
"Alright, goodnight," Harry said, sighing when the door shut coldly in his face. Combing his fringe backwards in frustration, he looked at the dimly lit corridor before him.
"I'm a growing boy, Harry. Were you a growing boy?"
"Mr Dearborn, I'm glad that you appreciate the care that St Mungo's has provided during your stay. Should you feel any discomfort or issues with your vision, do return to our emergency care unit for immediate follow up. Otherwise, your documents are in order and I don't hope to see you again," Draco joked as he looked at the man's arm with a wry shake of his head, surprised by the frown that he received instead from his usually chatty patient.
Let's go to Grimmauld after Andromeda's.
"Yes, thank you," Malfoy replied finally. Harry nodded, realising that maybe he shouldn't have come to visit Malfoy so early–but he had spent the entire night worrying and it had only felt right to check on Malfoy first thing in the morning.
Within an hour, the most junior staff of WEEP had been assigned to the Aurors—Draco had been pulled out from his work in Magical Intellectual Property and thrown into Robards’ office, where the man had warned Draco about obstructing and delaying justice.
Harry tapped his jaw as he waited impatiently for his students to leave. His practical class had accidentally overrun and he was now late for his weekly dinner appointment with Draco. Taking only the graduating Potions class, Draco was at Hogwarts thrice a week for a few hours each time, and Wednesday was the only day that their schedules coincided.
Harry quickly released the spells on the both of them. There were simply some things that they didn't need to hear or see.
Harry felt himself flush. He had referenced the train incident in sixth year where Malfoy had stepped on his face in the note. Did Malfoy's comment imply that he appreciated the humour?
Draco pressed their lips together in lieu of a reply, a soft moan escaping his throat when they met clumsily. Harry went slow, moving his lips deliberately as he savoured every moment. Opening his lips slightly, he sucked on Draco's bottom lip, sighing when Draco slid his tongue into his mouth. Harry's skin was buzzing from the simple pleasure, and his mind went blank as he surrendered himself to Draco. They kissed for what seemed like minutes before Draco pulled back, lips swollen and breath heavy.
Pansy acquiesced with a smile. "Then Potter's overreacting to some minor news. Did Granger–"
Draco felt his cock harden in his pants as Potter pushed him down onto the mat. The ache spread across his body when Potter pressed his own hardness against him, their kiss speeding up in hunger.
Draco drew back in confusion. “Shouldn’t Gryffindors have some sort of loyalty towards Weasley’s Wheezes?”
Potter huffed before opening his book for the ingredient list. They worked together fine, Potter preparing the ingredients obediently according to their textbook while Draco brewed.
As Draco watched Potter leave, he felt his heart ache at the resigned slope of Potter's shoulders. It should have been his dream come true, he thought, Potter returning his affections, but things were unfortunately not binary now. Had it been three years ago with a less snotty Draco who pined after Potter as much as he did now, it would have been so much easier. There were now so many unfortunate circumstances between them.
Malfoy's scowled at him. "Yes, but Granger is a beast, and I have embraced that."
Harry laughed, looking pointedly at Draco's hand. "I really did, didn't I?" He Scourgified them wandlessly.
"To the new French restaurant in Diagon," Harry felt his heart skip at the pleasant surprise that crossed Draco's features. Knowing Draco's picky standards, he had asked Hermione to visit to corroborate the reviews from the Prophet.
"Don't you worry that you might lose yourself?" He asked suddenly as the wind blew past, rattling the leaves and caressing his face. "Or that they would move on while you were finding yourself?"
Harry jerked at the sharp kick to his ankle. Sitting back onto the bench, he turned to glare at Ron.
Harry nodded as he corroborated the presence he could feel in the third floor. He should really start in the identification wards so that he didn't end up killing someone.
, you're taking the younger students so you can be the fun teacher. Which, I mean," he made a show of running his gaze from Harry's untameable hair, to the green button down, dark slacks and Muggle shoes before shaking his head in disapproval.

"Erm, yes, of course," Harry said hurriedly. "Alcohol?" He offered, smiling widely when Malfoy narrowed his eyes at him but accepted it nonetheless.
good, but it was just a bit
"No!" He yelled, tossing the magazine onto Harry as he shot up quickly. Malfoy's eyes were dark with arousal, the greys of his eyes completely consumed by his pupils when he looked away.
He walked towards the bed, shifting his weight between his feet, hoping that the Slytherins would start talking again and ignore his presence.
Draco threw open his cupboard doors the moment he apparated into his walk-in wardrobe. Unzipping his jeans hurriedly, he moaned at the pull of the rough fabric against his already hard cock. Concentration shot, he struggled to conjure lubricant onto his shaky hand.
Draco's brows raised in amusement. He had been recommending the public relations company he had on retainer for the longest time but to no avail. Apparently, all it took was to force his hand. "My remuneration is above the retainer fee," he clarified. Both Ginny and Ron sputtered in the background.
(read: befriending Potter on the Hogwarts train).
"Oh, can't you be serious for a moment?" Potter frowned as he sat upright, his eyes narrowed in disapproval. "You're always so evasive about every single thing, and I thought that you were getting better! I was saying that I enjoy your company, and I like that you've started to open up. I like us sitting here, talking about nothing." He looked straight at Draco, his green eyes bright with sincerity. Draco swallowed in nervousness. "In fact, I'd quite like you to come with me to meet Greg with Blaise this weekend. It'll be a nice gathering with the Slytherins," he offered calmly.
Draco returned his attention to the one-sided conversation his insufferable blind date was having with himself. "—differentiation of bond price with respect to the interest rate.  Because the bond price is always the same, the differentiation is always zero, which is the best investment anyone with any ounce of sense can make!"
27 December 2002, 16:00
"Of course," Draco agreed. He shook his head exasperatedly as he turned away from the mirror. Pushing the towel away, he dried Harry's hair with a gentle spell before reaching for the bottle of Sleakeazy's. Harry hummed contentedly when Draco tugged lightly on his hair while working the product in.
"Merlin, I still have a gift?" Draco asked in confusion when he opened the door. “You have one too,” he continued with a frown, “aren’t the reveals tomorrow? Why do I still get a gift?”
Please also find enclosed photographs from our records. Your father and Sirius were the most agonising students I have ever had the fortune to teach. Happy birthday, Harry. I look forward to seeing you soon.
"I'd be lonely in my own table and I don't know anyone else here." His friends had already left for Hogsmeade, and Harry had decided to beg off. He already had his next few gifts for Malfoy, and the thought of Michael Corner staring at him again challengingly while snogging Ginny made him uncomfortable.
Harry James Potter is sitting nude atop a white marble counter with a Slytherin scarf wrapped around his neck. There is a present beautifully wrapped in a foil of Appleby Arrows' pale blue on his lap. A thin silver ribbon completes it.
Emerging from the door on his hands and knees, Draco made to stand as gracefully as he could. Entering and exiting the Hufflepuff common room hadn't gotten any easier, which Abbott had agreed during Draco’s Apology Session last month. It was perhaps a character building thing, he had speculated. To inculcate that it was near impossible to get things your way. The blonde girl had simply laughed and returned that he had been thinking too much.
