That Wednesday, when Hermione wanted to stop by the library to get a specific book for Binns' about two opposing centaur clans causing a riot (
me." Severus hissed, shoving the man off him. "She was already gone when I returned." He sneered sourly, smoothing out his robes. "Which is why I am here. Rather than wasting time looking for someone to blame, you could be on your way to the Ministry now. Before the Dark Lord and his Death Eaters get to her."
. The fact that she had found herself in a similar situation when she first woke up today wasn't lost on her. It was all so frustrating. First she had thought, she had finally everything under control and now… how had it all escalated that quickly? She didn't even understand what was going on any more.
"Of course. I understand," Hermione said in an understanding tone, "but… you know… hypothetically speaking, if there was something else on your mind that you wanted to talk about, but you weren't sure who to turn to... you could
She'd gotten the paper from Draco. Shortly before the exams. Only the thought of him filled her with a mix of regret and longing that made her heart ache.
"What you waiting for, Rock'n Roll Queen?" Myron Wagtail asks me. It must be my outfit. But I do prefer the title W
stupid or dangerous." With that, she fetched a little bundle out of her bag that smelled absolutely heavenly.
"No." She answered simply. She sighed. She wasn't going to lie to him. Too much. She doubted he would have believed her in the first place.
As she lay there on her back with her eyes closed, she sensed movement from the left. And not a second later a heavy weight settled on her stomach. What the-? Haley opened her eyes only to see that Malfoy was using her as a pillow. What the hell was he thinking?
Draco nodded, glancing down at the drawing of lilies that looked as though they were about to lift off the parchment and come alive. "I understand."
Then she turned to him, as if he was the one who was to blame for her disappointment. There was so much anguish in her eyes. A short painful ache went through his heart. It was almost unbearable to see her like this. He wanted to comfort her somehow. But how?
"He did well not giving you a sibling. Imagine, if there was another one of you… Ugh, one is more than enough."
"Stop grinning. It doesn't mean anything." He drawled. Haley hadn't even realized she was grinning. But this was a good sign. It had to be.
"I see you've made the most of last night." The woman commented, pointedly eyeing the space where Haley had been lying only moments before.
Snape wasn't in his office. Or if he was, he didn't answer. Well, that sucked. What was he supposed to do now? Look for him inside the whole castle? There had to be something else he could do… The one time he really needed Luna's help and she was off to –
"How'd you get this?" Haley almost screeched, holding the pick closer to her eyes to see if it was a fake. "That's Myron Wagtail's special pick! The one he composed his major hits with! 'Do The Hippogriff', 'Magic Works', 'Owl Me Maybe'…" How in Merlin's name did he get a hold of that? Some people said it was made of elder wood.
"The headmaster has ways to protect your mother," Snape interrupted him. "Should you choose… the unexpected path." He turned around in his seat and opened a drawer behind him. When he turned back he had a plain white envelope in his hand. "Neither path will be easy. But be aware that once you have made your choice, it cannot be undone."
"It'll be alright," Lily soothed, rubbing her arm gently. And right then, over her mum's shoulder, Haley saw it all stop.
"I… I…" Haley stammered. She'd totally forgotten. In dedicating her whole afternoon to patch things up with Draco, she'd not only skipped her evening classes but also forgotten about quidditch.
The Occlumency session that night didn't start out as a disaster. Haley was determined to keep her cool and not show that she was upset in any way. She tried to think of anything that did not relate to Draco, focusing on good memories instead, like getting her Hogwarts letter or finding out, she could leave the Dursleys and live at Hogwarts instead…
It was the truth but he couldn't exactly say that without completely giving away how deeply he cared. What he said instead was, "I don't really like those. They're much too sweet for my taste. You can have them."
"Just open it," he urged impatiently. So, she did him the favour. And was hit with an explosion of smells. Vanilla. Cinnamon. Almonds. Chocolate. Inside the box was a chocolate dragon the size of her hand. Its wings were spread out as if it was flying and somehow it reminded her a bit of that Horntail she'd fought in fourth year.
"Well… you saw my dreams…" He replied slowly. "You said you'd found out about my feelings. Wasn't that why you kissed me?"
"Alright, who wants cake?" Mum exclaimed, picking up a knife and cutting the cake into uneven pieces.
"Come on. I'm not trying to turn you into a cat two times in a row. That would be much too predictable." She grabbed a chocolate chip muffin with cherries, bit off a chocolatey chunk and offered it to the boy.
Wasn't that obvious? It was on the forefront of his mind constantly. Did he really need to explain it to her?
"That you're trying to get back your magic," her voice sounded muffled from the other side of the wooden door. "Does that mean you lost it? I didn't know that was possible." The girl opened the door slightly to peek curiously at him. How was she this fearless?
"You got the 'beauty' part right," she replied cheekily, to assure him she was all right. "How long did I sleep?"
"I guess by 'being foolish' you mean telling the truth?" Haley chuckled darkly, remembering the lines that were etched into the skin of her right hand.
He scowled, narrowing his eyes at her. Then he shuffled around on the coat-blanket, turning his back to her.
"I'm taking that as a compliment," he drawled lazily. There was an amused grin on his face. "Shame, though. This might have looked better in your hair."
Haley had missed him. She had missed that boy so much and she'd been able to see him every day. But it hadn't been like this. She'd been so scared of losing him. And she almost had. Because of an interview.
he hissed in irritation. That was why she had been so eager to stand guard outside. She'd stolen the golem. How was he going to get it back now? She was probably long gone.
Hermione nodded and scooted closer to Haley. "What happened?" She asked quietly, laying a comforting hand on her back.
"So… I got this from the kitchens." He gestured toward a small basket at his feet. "Let's have lunch outside today."
"Who has the last laugh, now, Malfoy?" She asked him, not caring about her squeaky voice any longer.
Haley sighed. At least that meant, Draco's magic wasn't purposefully hurting Neville. Right? It was like… when you were trying to fit into a pair of jeans that was several sizes too small. It was bound to tear and eventually break. Or like blowing too much air into a balloon until it burst because it was simply too small for all that air.
Unsurprisingly, she was the only one in the owlery. In record time, Haley penned a short urgent letter, found Hedwig and sent her off to Godric's Hollow. If there was anyone who could help her with this, it was her mum.
He was right of course. She wouldn't be able to keep her secret forever. One day, she would have no choice but to tell her friends the truth.
I glance down at my arm and am met with a drawing of an owl and a kangaroo. They both look adorable.
"Thank you, Simon. I'm going to miss you!" She exclaimed, as she pulled him into a bone-crushing hug.
"For a whole week you've been following him around and then? You just stopped all together. What did you even want from him in the first place?"
Haley ignored her pulsing heartbeat and gave a short nod in the man's general direction. Then she spun around and fled down the hallway. All the way up to her tower she wondered, when she had started running away instead of fighting. Maybe it was because she knew. She knew that this was a fight she couldn't win. Or at least she didn't know how she was supposed to win it.
"As I said, back in fifth year, there was a boy at Hogwarts who would always harass me and bother me and – well he was constantly up in my face, announcing he was there. You'd have to be a troll to miss his presence. It really drove me nuts!"
He followed her eyes. "Oh. That was me, wasn't it?" His voice sounded proud. And a little sheepish. "I don't know any. The house elves always clean at home."
"Almost there," he replied, as he lead them toward the path leading away from the grounds and toward Hogsmeade. Where was he taking them?
As always he wasn’t giving himself enough credit. She had seen how well he could sketch plants. He had to stop comparing himself to others. They had talked about this a thousand times. She shot him a pointed look.
Is this Malfoy's subconsciousness talking? What a weird thought. Maybe now is the moment to disguise myself somewhat. After all, I don't know how much of this Malfoy actually perceives. I imagine myself with a big, dark hood, that completely covers my face. It turns dark in front of me. There, that wasn't too hard. But now I can't see anything myself. I imagine a little window that allows me to see through the hood without other people seeing my face. Did it work? I can see fine now. I reach for the fabric in front of my face. I can still touch it. I guess it must have worked then.
"What was it you wanted to tell me earlier?" He asked, placing his hands on her waist and pulling her closer. How could she tell him now, after all that? After preparing such an amazing date and giving her such a meaningful gift? She couldn't ruin it all like this. She'd tell him another time. Tomorrow. It would be the first thing on her list tomorrow. Maybe until then, she could also think of a way to explain it to him gently. So, he could understand. So, he wouldn't hate her.
A favour? What was that supposed to mean? Haley stared at the door that had fallen closed behind Malfoy. Her breathing had quickened considerably and she was desperately trying to calm down.
"She was a muggleborn," she told him almost in a challenging way. Like she was testing him. Testing his reaction. Well, Draco wasn't stupid.
It's the one with the two big, black doors, that looks like the entrance to a castle. I stop to inspect it more carefully. On the right door there is a heavy knocker that looks like it's a snake made of silver. The snake's eyes seem to be glistening emeralds. Is this the door I've been looking for?
With drooping eyes Haley trudged down the hall. Was that a bench to her right? She didn't know if she'd be able to make it all the way up to the tower. But after a little break… she'd surely be able to go on.
He seriously felt like a fool. Was he imagining things or was it just a ghost playing tricks on him?
We sit down on the bed that is closest to us. She's not going to try and talk me out of my plan, is she? After all it was
Potter was marching up to him now, stopping only when she was right in front of him. There was a fire in her eyes that glinted dangerously.
note. The note that she had received before the Third Task. She had taken to carrying it around in one of her pockets wherever she went. Back at Privet Drive she had finally gotten around to comparing the writing with that other note, she'd received. The one that was signed
Draco tore at his hair with a growl of frustration and let his head sink to the table in defeat. "Why does this have to be so hard?" In a whisper he added, "She's just a girl, for Slytherin's sake."
"I know, I know, let's go downstairs now, shall we? You probably won't be able to sleep, if you miss dessert." As she pulled her brother out of her room and down the stairs, she thought that she wouldn't even mind Simon's complaining if it meant she didn't have to go back to Hogwarts.
"He smiled at me," she continued with a glint in her eyes, "He has a really cute smile. There is a dimple on his right cheek." Hermione whispered fondly. Haley smiled at her friend. She got the feeling Hermione had been wanting to share those memories with her for some time.
The last day before break. Tomorrow he was going home. What was he going to tell mother? He still hadn't made his choice… He wanted nothing more than to talk to Haley about it. Ask her what she thought. Wanted her to tell him to stay by her side. That she needed him. The choice would be much easier then.
Hedwig ignores me. I think I like her much more as an owl. She opens the door, causing the little bell above it to chime and pulls me into Simon's dream.
She grinned mysteriously. "Secrets are meant to be kept." She sent him a pointed look. Let him make of that what he wanted to. "Or are they?"
." A second later the cup magically mended itself, looking as good as new. Then it began to glow and exploded into bright flames.
He glanced over to the left where Haley was sitting a few rows in front of him. She wasn't writing any more. It looked, as if she'd fallen asleep. In the middle of an exam! She probably hadn't gotten enough sleep the last week. Just like him. Like all of the fifth-years probably. Maybe he could steal one of Snape's ambrosia draughts for her. They made you feel as if you were born anew–
Something glistened below his eye. Like a tiny translucent gobstone. Haley wanted to reach out and wipe the tear drop away.
"Do you think I'd still be here if I could walk away from you that easily?" Draco asked, sounding half impatient, half amused. Then he lightly knocked his forehead against hers. It hurt a tiny bit. He wasn't waiting for an answer, was he?
The girl was watching him, like she was waiting for an answer. Well, he hoped she was good at waiting because he certainly didn't feel up for this nonsense tonight. Or possibly ever.
With a groan Draco got up from the couch and marched over toward the door leading out of the VIP lounge. He opened the door, not even grabbing his coat, wondering where he was supposed to look first, when he came face to face with the exact girl, he had been worrying about.
There you have the reunion! I hope you like it :) I know it's been ages... sorry. I struggled a bit with the end of the chapter actually. But I think it turned out okay... And I've been feeling super uninspired lately, so I don't even have the next chapter pre-written. (Which is unusual for me.) Well... let me know what you think. I hope all of you are safe! I'll answer all of your reviews soon. They mean the world to me!
“Fine.” I demonstratively look the other way. He takes his time, the movement of the quill on my skin making me wonder if he’s drawing something instead of writing it.
"So, you're saying you haven't done this dream walking thing for at least two weeks?" It was obvious, he was trying to keep calm. "Right?"
She followed his gaze. Why was Ron looking at the handkerchief? There was a stitched design in one corner of it. She hadn't spotted it in the dark. But now she saw something that looked suspiciously like an
How was it that a couple of words or her smiling face made him feel like there was a bloody inferno burning through him? Or like he was lighter than a feather, with nothing to ground him and no safety net beneath.
," I whisper, thinking up some stupid incantation and imagining green streaks to colour the boy's hair.
But she wasn't going to let him win. Not this time. Not when she had already got that far. He wanted a proof? She was
"So, about the rumours that you're going out with a Slytherin now, do you want us to take care of them?" Colin asked from her right.
"It is just tea," the man explained. There was an amused lilt to his voice. "I would like to tell you a story, Draco."
"You don't have to explain!" He spat. "I get it. He fooled you somehow. I just don't understand… that you
From the looks of it, it didn't seem like Snape was going to easily give up his reasons for coming. It obviously had something to do with the golem. Did he want to try activating a golem of his own? But then… he had all the instructions right there written out clearly. If Draco had been able to follow them, the potion professor should be able to do the same without a problem. Unless… the purpose of this new potion he was working on was something different.
As much as he seemed to be trying, Draco couldn't stop grinning. "You sound like a house elf!" He snorted, trying not to laugh. "Are you okay?"
"Stop, right there!" Hermione exclaimed, causing Haley's heart to stop. Slowly she turned to look at her friend… who kept sleeping peacefully.
mention that blasted name ever again," he concludes, fixing me with a sharp glare. There's a storm of emotions raging behind his grey eyes. I get the feeling that there might be more to the story.
"Maybe," Hermione whispered non-committally. The hopeful tint of her smile made Haley almost ignore the sting of guilt she felt toward Ron.
. He wasn't perfect. Far from it. But Haley wasn't perfect either. All she knew was that being with him made her feel happier than she had felt in a long time. If ever. And that was what she wanted to show him.
like you. There aren't a lot of people who've managed to do that. You're incredible." He repeated earnestly. "Anyone who can't see that is an idiot."
"Merlin, kill me now!" She wailed, wondering what had possessed her. What had she been thinking? She remembered not thinking much at all. And being immeasurably tired. That had to be it. She had not been in her right mind because of the sleep deprivation. And then Malfoy had challenged her. Asked her to prove… prove that he had a crush on her. And then she'd just…
"Really?" I have to ask. I don't feel like having my hand electrified or anything once I touch the door knob.
.There was movement behind the shelf opposite his. Long, flowing blond locks. It was the girl from the other night! The Ravenclaw that had helped get him out of the helmet. When had she arrived? She was watching him; shaking her head slightly.
Haley sneezed. Violently. She didn't know where she was. Everything was dark and she felt terrified. Her heart was thudding in her chest like she'd just run to the forbidden forest and back. Draco. Where was he? Where –
did you push me away? Why did you say you don't need me?" His eyes were soft like molten silver and his voice sounded like breaking glass. She'd never meant to hurt him like this.
"I didn't know students could purchase these tables. Don't you think they belong to Hogwarts? But then again, who does Hogwarts belong to? You don't think Dumbledore owns it, do you?"
"Sweet tune," says Myron and nods approvingly, "I didn't get your name…?" He adds in a questioning tone.
"I know you're on the team now but that doesn't give you an excuse to slack off on school work," Hermione chided.
"While you're at it, you might as well disguise yourself properly. Why don't you try to make yourself look like another person?"
"Ow." She hissed, glaring at the bird but it had already flown off into the night, leaving her alone with the whirlwind that was her emotions.
It wasn't as if she had time for something like that. Getting up, she readied herself to continue running down the next hall, when she recognised the person, she had run into.
"I'm going to break every single bone in his body," he muttered darkly, hugging the girl even more tightly.
"That's stupid," interjected Ron. Haley silently agreed. If anyone had reason to blame themselves for what…
, she reassured herself, as she pulled the blankets up around her and calmed her mind so she could fall asleep.
"Let him go," she told her. "He'll cool off. You know how he is. He needs time." The girl had placed one hand on her friend's shoulder, keeping her form going after the boy.
"Of course," Haley encouraged her. "And Angelina knows it, too. She's seen you catch that snitch, the other day." The same day she had threatened to kick Haley off the team, actually…
"What are you-?" There was a wand in his face and before he could reach for his own wand the girl had whispered, "
"Okay." She took his hand, which felt familiar and warm in his own and maybe it didn't matter. What mattered was that she was here with him now. The future could wait for another day or two.
Haley shook her head. For some reason she thought he would have dismissed them just as easily as Hermione was now. And Haley hadn't been ready to bury that hope.
for real. Because there was a part of her inside her that opposed to all of this. Her sneaking into his dreams and stealing his deepest secrets from underneath his nose without him even knowing or being able to defend himself. That was why she had been hesitating. Even after everything he had done to her. She didn't want to sink this low. If she was going to find out about his secret, shouldn't he be aware of it at least? Shouldn't he get the chance to stop her?
"So… your sighing tells us, you might be in need of a fun and exciting distraction." A familiar voice said, and a second later one of the twins, appeared next to the fireplace, which she had been watching absently.
"You're still not done with packing? James, always delayed that until the last possible second as well," he commented fondly.
"Fine, might as well tell you the tragic story." He sighed dramatically, running a hand through his stringy hair. "It's not pretty… think you can stomach it?"
"Are you scared?" He asked, while pushing dark locks out of her eyes. She shook her head violently. There was no reason to be scared. He was just messing with her. There was no way she wouldn't have noticed that Malfoy was a vampire. Haley ignored her heart that was madly beating in her chest. Did Malfoy actually feel it?
"I met a girl once who worried herself to her death." She sighed, floating through one of the sinks. "Not at all spectacular, I know. Who're you worried about?"
Hey everyone! So, finally, there's a confrontation! And a... resolve :D I bet you didn't expect that, did you? Let me just tell you, we're moving into the next arc now and there's still a lot more to tell. In case you were wondering. Glumbumbles are an actual thing. I found them in Phantastic beasts (book) and found them quite interesting. And what did you think about the Neville/Malfoy scene? Any suspicions or ideas? As always leave me your thoughts and thanks for reading :)
The chapter title is inspired by "Don't you" by Darren Criss. (I used to be a huge fan and this song is so fluffy and sweet :))
"You heard her!" Draco burst in return, still angry it seemed. "She'll tell everyone! I won't let her!"
"Don't worry, Luna already filled us in," Hermione said, with a reassuring half-smile, as she picked up her quill again and pulled the scroll away from Ron's curious eyes.
"I'm going to go in first," she whispered, "You should wait a few minutes before following me. If I don't come back it means the air should be clear."
The girl had dirty blond hair that fell down to her waist and round blue eyes that were directed straight at him.
Haley glanced at her friend guiltily. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have taken it out on you." She apologized only too readily, noting that Hermione hadn't asked
"It's nothing." he grunted, shaking off her hand that made his arm prickle uncomfortably. Compared to everything else that was a complete mess at the moment it really was nothing.
"Which is why," I pause, it's really hard to stay serious and not full out laugh at him, "Why I've come up with a suitable task to make up for your behaviour which is far from commendable."
There was no questioning it. The letter paper was glowing. And a second later, two inky blue words appeared on it.
Haley should have anticipated something like this. Of course, he was going to ask her on another date. She wasn't exactly an expert on dating. But as far as she could judge their date had gone surprisingly well. They had laughed and argued and held hands and even kissed… She felt heat rush to her face at that particular memory.
"By the way, I took one last week. You know the one with the witch in the broom closet. Do you actually enjoy these? I found it awfully tacky. What were these people thinking – Zabini, where are you – are you blushing?" Malfoy asks in a mocking tone. I'm on my feet, half-way toward the door that hopefully leads out of this dream. No way am I going to stay here and talk about these
When he glanced back to the professor, it seemed like the man was looking right into his head. It made Draco feel incredibly vulnerable. All of this did. He should never have told him any of this.
"Hey! What are you-?" She began to ask but she got distracted by the head of hair that had fallen into her lap where only seconds before the book had been. She threw her hands up in surprise at the sight of the boy who was so calmly resting his head on her legs. Spread out on his back he grinned up at her lazily like this was something he did every day.
He knew he was being unfair. But in that moment there were more important matters than worrying about the feelings of Luna Lovegood. Surely she would understand.
"Well, I'm sorry if I thought-" She fired back but then she noticed something about his eyes. They weren't red, were they?
He turned, facing her. There was something careful about his expression. Like he was trying not to show any emotions.
He rubbed the back of his neck. “No, I meant… I wanted to ask… is it – is it true? That you’re… going out with Malfoy?”
' She didn't know if she was crazy or not. But she did know, that she didn't want her best friend and her boyfriend to get into a fight that involved wands or possibly fists. Who would she root for?
"You can stop with the pretence now. Nobody's watching." Haley said, not backing down. She didn't understand why he was still keeping up his pointless act. They were alone, weren't they? There was no reason for him to still act that way. Unless… But no. Any second now, he would tell her she'd been right. Maybe he was simply afraid, she was still mad or something.
." He was shuddering in disgust. But beneath that, it was obvious that a part of him didn't worry about the Hufflepuff part too much.
Draco grinned. Let him think his petty plan had failed. But then the last three sentences vanished all of a sudden. What the-?
I stole the chapter title from a song from Thumbelina, which I loved like nothing else in the world as a child. It gives me all the nostalgic feels!
"But – this is is ridiculous! You're – I mean – you're the one who asked me out! You can't just do that and not think about the consequences–"
He shrugged. "Lucky guess." Haley watched him sceptically. She was almost certain there was more to it.
"Weren't you planning on doing some stalking?" Mum asks. I follow her through the door just as she is about to enter her own dream door.
Hermione went down to breakfast without her. Clearly she was still cross with Haley. At least she found Ron waiting for her in the common room.
I'm still taking in my surroundings. Does this tree house exist in reality? Or is it merely a product of the Slytherin's imagination? It's a really nice tree house. With light wood and a ceiling that's made of glass.
"No, there is no problem at all, sir," Malfoy said calmly after he had got up. As she let Neville help her up, Haley saw, that Professor Snape was eyeing the Slytherin suspiciously.
, walk away and laugh at him? No, that was too cruel. Although it would certainly be more fun than the first option. Maybe she would find something fitting between overeager and cruel.
Haley didn't reply. She didn't care about the stupid insect. Nothing around her seemed to make sense any more. First, the thing with Malfoy and now Neville was keeping secrets from her? What were the odds that this was all some crazy dream and she was going to wake up any moment?
That was so not true. "You should see my brother eat." She replied, still chewing. "Watching him makes you wonder if there's actually a hole in his stomach. It's like he does nothing but eat all day. But… I guess it makes him happy so… that's what counts, right?" She shrugged. "Aren't you going to eat? It's kinda creepy if you're just watching me…"
Of all the things I expected to walk into, it's definitely not the town I grew up in. Godric's Hollow. Or even more specific, the playground close to the woods where Simon and I used to play. Well, and all the other children from Godric's Hollow. And there in front of the climbing frame I see… myself. But I'm at least five years younger. The younger version of me is kneeling on the ground next to a collection of shiny gobstones. A younger version of Draco stands in front of her and glances down at her with crossed arms. I will myself into being small again like when I turned myself into a little fairy. I'm going to watch them for now.
I nod, narrowing my eyes at him. "Why?" I ask. "Are you interested in her or something? Or do you simply enjoy being a jerk." It's weird talking about myself in the third person.
"There you are! What were you doing in there?" Pansy asked. She still looked a bit ragged from the hexes earlier. He probably didn't look better.
To be fair, she had a surprisingly high rate of actually catching the snitch. To say, the girl knew how to use her strengths to her advantage was an understatement. Most of the time, she closely observed the other Seekers and once they caught sight of the winged gold ball, she chased behind them, in attempt to be the first to reach it. Thanks to her godfather making sure, she always had the latest racing broom she never had trouble catching the snitch first. It was almost too easy. It was even easier when they played against Hufflepuff or Slytherin, because then she could also use her natural charm to distract the male Seekers. It worked especially well with the third-year who was currently replacing Malfoy. Sadly, the same couldn't be said about Cho Chang, who was the Seeker for Ravenclaw.
After I've been watching him flying for a while, sitting sideways on my broomstick, he flies back to me, coming to a halt in the air in front of me.
"Don't worry. I'm fine." He said with a smile that looked like it was more forced than genuine. She noticed that he hadn't told her where the burns were from.
Oh. She hadn't even thought about it… But then… Hedwig had come into one of Draco's dreams that one time so… if it was possible for owls… it should be possible for him as well.
Wasn't it obvious? But then Draco realised that he had never actually told her how he felt about her. Not in words anyway. He didn't even know for sure what it was he felt. It was definitely more than a fleeting crush. A mere crush wouldn't have been that persistent, right? Just sitting here together with her in the autumn sun made him feel all tingly inside. Made a thrill of excitement run through his body. But what did it even mean? And how was he going to relay those feelings in the right way? He cleared his throat nervously and started to play around with his empty teacup. It was easier to find the words when he wasn't looking at Potter.
He decided it wasn't too bad. He had acted on his feelings and now he got to hug her. Draco tightened his grip on Potter just because he could. He smiled contentedly into her shoulder. Her scent was all around him. It was something sweet and warm and – yes, he could get used to this.
"Draco," Pansy whispered from behind him. He turned around, noticing that everyone was in their seats again. The girl grinned amusedly and nodded to the front, forming the word '
Haley tried to catch his eyes but Draco was gazing out of the window behind him. "She knows?" She asked quietly.
"Don't be too disappointed if you don't find anything useful." Having said that, he sank into the couch lazily and closed his eyes. Hadn't he slept enough?
"Very funny!" She thundered. She was the one being attacked by an aggressive tree and he had nothing better to do but ask for help? Was that another of his pranks?
And sure enough it seemed as though Malfoy and the orange cat had become the best of friends in merely seconds.
His lips were still gentle but something was different about the way he kissed her. The hesitancy from before was mostly gone now. It felt more confident somehow. The fingers of his right hand were interlaced with her own and he angled his head to the side so he was able to reach her lips better. It was strange how little it bothered her that her glasses were sort of piercing the side of her face or that her hair tie was pressed against the back of her head in an uncomfortable way.
So, he insulted her. He was a pro at that after all. It seemed only logical. Halfway through his tirade of insults, something distracted him. Little droplets of water were idly dripping from the tips of Potter's hair down her forehead and along her neck in the back. Watching the drops make their way over Potter's skin was kind of hypnotizing… what did he want to say? He couldn't focus anymore! There was only the water drops, that were chasing one another through Potter's short, dark – even darker from being wet – hair, that really shouldn't be this distracting!
Haley meets lots of people on the Hogwarts Express. There are also chocolate frog cards. And a much anticipated meeting.
Draco sat in his huge back garden – which was more of a park, really – and once more re-read the letter he had received earlier that day. He wasn't sure why. What exactly he was looking for.
Haley sighed in relief. At least he didn't ask her questions she couldn't answer. "Well, then…" She reached for the door, when –
"Hey Potter!" Called a voice from behind Haley, Hermione and Ron, who were on their way to Defence Against the Dark Arts.
It was probably charmed in some way. The only thing that was still left was the magical umbrella that wasn't an umbrella. Haley frowned. She still didn't really understand how it worked.
"Um…" Haley said hesitantly. "Is everything-?" Hermione finally looked at her, stopping Haley from continuing to ask her question. There was something hard in her friend's gaze. As if she had erected a wall between her and everything else. Including Haley.
Draco scoffed. "I think I have a good reason to be." He sat down opposite Luna again, scrunching up his brows.
There was a noise. Somebody was moving toward their corner. Quickly, he grabbed a random book from the shelf behind him, opened it and pretended to read intently.
Luna smiled at that. "Of course," she answered cheerfully. The girl's honest enthusiasm made it hard for Haley not to trust her. And she really didn't have a reason to doubt her. She was a member of her defence group after all. And she was friends with Ginny. And she was one of the few people that believed her story about Voldemort's return. It was highly unlikely that it was all an evil ploy to... well to what? Sabotage her? Harm her? Gain her trust and then betray her? The more she thought about it the more ridiculous it sounded in her head.
," she whispered, quietly as not to wake anyone. Haley heard a soft thud from somewhere close. She repeated the incantation, hearing the thud again. It came from Hermione's bed. Haley tip-toed over toward the bed and quietly drew aside the curtain. Her friend was sound asleep. She held her breath carefully surveying the scene. The noise had sounded like something was knocking against wood. Wood… The drawer!
"For your little problem," she drawled, wiggling her brows suggestively. Oh, the influence of her dad and godfather's lewd humour seemed to finally show its effects.
While Hermione was busy reading the Daily Prophet, Ginny was lazing in the grass, solving the crossword puzzle, and asking them for clues every few minutes.
"Oh. Guess, that's good enough then." He replied, surprised she'd answered so readily, not even asking questions.
"Leave it to my brother. He knows what he's doing," said the little girl beside her with a shy smile.
." She felt so relieved that for a second she forgot her wounded heart. Then she rushed forward and hugged him. Her lost and found best friend. It felt so good to have him back.
Also, she wanted to change. She had this beautiful light turquoise blouse that looked amazing with a nice pair of jeans. The combination perfectly showed off the curves she had and hid the ones she didn't have.
"Did you know that?" She asked, watching him closely and wondering how he might react. His hair looked funny. The way it was sticking up from his head now.
The realisation made Draco's face fall. "Right. Quidditch." He chuckled humourlessly. "That's important. You have to be there, of course." He encouraged her. But his voice sounded strangely hollow.
As it turned out there was still a vast amount of sandwiches left so everyone got to keep their lifes.
"I'm taking it back then. Get yourself another fool who'll play your house elf." She replied, making to get up.
Haley looked up then, finally, and she wasn't sure if it was the eyes that were alight with something other than bitterness or the soft smile that was a tad mischievous even now, but somehow she found herself in a fierce – and not tearful at all – embrace. She wasn't really a person that ranted, but in this moment, she spilled out all her worries. Starting with the return of Voldemort and seeing Cedric die and ending with how frustrated she had felt all summer when she had been stuck at Privet Drive and nobody had given her any information. It felt good to get all of this off her chest and after a while she felt calm enough to pull away.
With him facing away from her, Haley found her fingers combing through the blond strands of hair almost on their own accord. Malfoy's eyes had closed and he was humming softly. He seemed so content. Next thing she knew he was going to start purring like a cat. Haley shook her head, over the absurdity and grinned softly. From this angle his features were kind of blurred. She could easily pretend that he was just… someone. Someone she could let herself enjoy being with. Not her enemy. It was almost too easy. She wondered if that was why Malfoy kept his eyes closed. Did he imagine she was just some… faceless girl? Was he pretending all of the animosity between the two of them had never existed in the first place? As she ran her hands through his hair she noticed that it was just about long enough to be pulled into a small ponytail. She grinned at that.
All he'd asked for was a simple answer. An uncomplicated cluster of words that would have assured him.
Show me? Is there a CD player hiding beneath his pillows? But the boy only sends me a boyish little smile and gets up from his bed. A moment later the scenery changes completely. The beds are gone and we find ourselves in a huge meadow.
"You know," he began in a soft voice, barely above a whisper, "Evil… and good…" He lowered his eyes to the blanket. "The bad guys never call themselves the bad guys. Most of the time they are convinced they're doing the right thing."
For a split second I catch a glimpse of Malfoy's eyes up close. They seem unguarded and the expression in them completely honest. His eyes remind me of something…
He seemed weirdly clumsy lately, like he wasn't able to control his magic properly any more. In Defence Against the Dark Arts, too, he accidentally set their boggart on fire, frightening it so much that no one could continue fighting against it. It was hilarious. And loosened up the tension surrounding the pre-exam a bit. But sadly it wasn't enough to get Haley's mind off her worries.
"I could… you know…" Hesitantly, she fetched her wand from her pocket. But Draco only shook his head.
"Are you… laughing at me?" The boy inquired, still glaring at her. Haley just shrugged, trying to stop herself from laughing. But that was easier thought than done.
I pinch his cheek. It's a reflex. My little brother has ruined me. "You never know. You might be surprised." I feel like I'm going to regret these words.
"No, not that." He hesitated for a moment, seeming slightly sheepish. "The house cup is not the only thing worth winning." He muttered, a soft smile pulling up one corner of his mouth. He looked so content in that moment. Laid-back and… gentle almost. Not nasty at all.
"Oh, did you think you could charm me with sweet words?" She huffed. Then she added. "Well, it worked. Which one do you want? I think I'm going to go with chocolate. Bandy said he got the most popular flavours."
He recognized a few of the faces now. Black, Lupin, Pettigrew… Potter. Haley's father. The arrogance was practically oozing from him. But there was something insecure about him as well. Whenever he glanced over to the girls.
He settled for glaring. "Could you try to keep your voice down? I'd rather not have people find out about this matter by accident."
When Draco realized what that very likely meant, his heart sank, bereft of all energy. But he didn't show her that. He couldn't. So, he faked a smile and declared triumphantly,
The dreams were the worst kind of torture. She felt like she was on the verge of going mad. What was real? What was not? How was she supposed to know? What was she supposed to do?
Haley stopped in her tracks. In the dark, surrounded by thick leaves Draco was sitting in a heap of green pillows, smirking at her. She looked around, making sure they were alone, before allowing herself to smile at him. It looked as though they'd had the same idea. He patted the space next to him. Haley sank into the sea of pillows. Where had they all come from?
"So, it's up to Neville, then?" Haley asked. "If he doesn't want to give it back… Draco… has to stay this way?"
I'm not sure what it is that makes me hesitate. It's okay now. I'm allowed to go through that door. I should just… I look back over my shoulder. Next to my own door there is mum's.
skip a beat, every time Ron smiled at her with his blue eyes lit up and those freckles all over his face. Well, nowadays he smiled at someone else more often. How much even the thought pained her. Stupid heart. How foolish it was.
"Extra lessons? With Snape?" He said it so loudly, Haley wouldn't have been surprised if everyone in the corridor heard him. There was a flash of blond hair at the end of the hall. No, actually, two flashes.
Haley's eyes widened. She had almost forgotten that there was another side to this story. She lowered her eyes to the ground, unable to meet his boring gaze.
Oh. Fred and George. Was he after them? Because of whatever diversion they had caused? That didn't sound good at all.
"Finally. You're more stubborn than a mule. I thought you'd never get it together." Hermione piped up, shaking her head impatiently.
"That." The Slytherin reached for the quill that lay on top of her finished essay and held it in front of his face curiously.
Neville's eyes were fixed on the tree trunk. "Let's deal with this first." He answered absently, prying the little honey jar out of her hand.
She wished there was someone she could talk to. Someone who wouldn’t judge her. Someone who didn’t think she was a terrible person. But there was no one left to confide in. Was she really as bad as everyone thought?
"Actually…" I say in embarrassment. "I've been thinking… well, the castle could use some colour, don't you think? The grey stone walls… the gloomy hallways… they're depressing, honestly. I'd love to add some colour here and there." Now, I'm the one who sounds wistful.
He chuckles. "Okay I made that up. I thought about it, though." Am I imagining this, or does he look slightly older now?
I hesitantly reach for the door (no electric shocks!) and pull it open. Well that was easy. Simon is too trusting for his own good. But for now I'm glad I can get in so easily.
"Don't know, but we should definitely take a sample for later." His twin brother replied with an unnaturally high giggle.
"You were right." She admitted with a sigh. "It was about Malfoy." It felt so embarrassing to admit it out loud! Her cheeks were burning up, too! "Just the thought that he's been thinking about me like that all this time makes me sick! That's why I've been so tetchy this morning."
Her friend looked at her like she wasn't quite sure whether to put up with her petulant behaviour or whether to call her out on it.
"Who's pretending?" He frowned. She was mocking him. Honestly, he shouldn't be attracted by that. But he was. He was drawn to Haley Potter no matter what she did.
She really should have seen it coming. All day the castle had been too quiet. Almost suspiciously so. Malfoy hadn't even sent a glare at her for the way she had called him a
"It's fine," she replied, placing her hand on his arm. "I understand. And I'm not mad at you for not listening to what I told you earlier."
"I'm here." She whispered back, pressing herself closer against his body, taking in his familiar scent, mixed with coffee and sweat. It could've smelled unpleasant but in that moment, she really couldn't care less. "I can share my magic with you. I've got enough for both of us."
Haley couldn’t believe this. All this time… She shook her head, trying to wrap her mind around this. It was a lot to take in.
"No, we didn't break up – we–" I stop myself, needing a moment to make sense of the chaotic mess that is our conversation. "You want me to come visit… and bring Draco along… so we can try out your new potion experiment?"
She did have a point there. It didn't make sense. Unless Malfoy was toying with her. Unless… he was serious about her?
"I…" she whispered quietly, after a moment. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have brought you here. It's my fault you got your hopes crushed."
Turning back to the frozen figures in the middle of the room, Malfoy glanced at Snape's hand once more and raised a questioning eyebrow. The potion master let go of her arm at once, seemingly remembering where they were.
"Well I," she thought about it for a moment, "I just do. I have to." She added quietly. If she couldn't trust Dumbledore… she didn't even want to think about what that would mean.
"You can open it," he grumbled impatiently. "It's not dangerous or toxic or anything." He didn't mean to be this grouchy but he was so anxious to see whether she liked the present.
Haley felt the sudden urge to touch him, to somehow check that this was really happening. She reached for his hand and carefully ran the fingers of her other hand across each of his own. His skin was really soft. She'd never really noticed that before. She hadn't taken the time to.
She opened her eyes slightly to see what was going on around her. Hermione and Ron were standing next to the portrait hole while Neville was picking up some books close to her armchair.
"What if it's just-" she bit her lips, wondering how to phrase it best. "You know, that thing you have… the saving-people thing."
Severus sighed. This morning he certainly had not thought he would end up fighting about a puppet with Sirius Black. "See?" He pulled out Draco's golem notes and the flask with his potion he had confiscated earlier. "It all belongs to a student."
Snape who was standing at the back of the room in front of a shelf, pointed toward the seat on the other side of his desk.
"No, I – well – actually it's…" he sputtered, looking to the side. "Shut up, Potter," he grumbled when she started giggling.
"Not physically! You're never open with me. You don't trust me. You're not even trying! You can't even tell me one tiny detail about your life without trying to change the subject!"
He blinked down at her in surprise, his elbows resting left and right from her face. Then the smirk was back again.
"He always furrows his brows like this." She chuckled, scrunching up her eyebrows. "He's got this huge moustache that always wobbles up and down when he gets mad." She finished with another laugh that sounded slightly sad.
The forcefulness with which she clung to him made Draco wonder what else the weasel had said to her. In which other way he had hurt her. The thought that not too long ago he had done the same to Haley on a regular basis made him even angrier.
…" he repeated impatiently, "Once you're done with the recording you press the button again and seal the memory with a password." He seemed really excited for some reason.
Was this all she had to say? Didn't she know who she was talking to? Well, he might as well leave like he'd wanted to. But maybe he could steal a final glance at Potter – who he had not been watching – just to ease his mind. She was wearing her hair over her left shoulder, making her long neck stand out for everyone to see. A lock of hair kept falling into her eyes, which she pulled back behind her ear every few minutes or so. It was really distracting. He had to suppress the urge to walk up to her and take care of the lock himse–
Another noise on the corridor. So quiet that she'd almost missed it. Haley hurriedly turned away from the class room and looked up and down the corridor warily.
"Ah." He said, watching Luna fill another mould with chocolate. How many was she going to make? And all of them were for her friends? How many friends did she have?
A second later Malfoy's head appears above the deck. He pulls himself up on it and joins me, taking in his tree house like it's some kind of treasure. He grins at me, then opens the wooden door and goes inside.
I gape at him speechlessly. How on earth does he remember this so well? And then, as if there had been magic in his voice I see my shirt and jeans turn into the dress robes I wore that night. And my long auburn hair flows across my shoulder in an artfully messed up braid that's adorned with little snowdrops.
"Well… we'll save you a seat," Ron informed her and continued his march to the Great Hall. He was such a caring friend. Hermione rolled her eyes over his behaviour.
I hesitantly sit on the edge of the bed. "I…" My voice is too high! I need to make it sound deeper. I clear my throat. "So…" That's better. "why are you not supposed to leave your room?" I ask, going in straight for the kill.
Haley had not the slightest idea what was happening around her. It was a good thing Hermione had done most of the talking. They were currently sitting around a big table inside the Hog's Head (the world's most shabby pub of all time) planning how to go about their new Anti-Umbridge-Alliance.
sick. She was so focused on wondering about Malfoy's whereabouts that she almost didn't notice that Neville made all the chairs in class float when it was his turn showing the Levitation Charm. And he made the students sitting in the chairs float
I glare at him. It would be wrong to throw the cat at him… Even if it's technically not a real cat. I sigh, roll onto my stomach and bury my face in the fluffy pillow. "Ugh, I don't even know why I'm dating him." Suddenly the bed starts to shake. "Simon, what?"
. Still, she was determined to figure it all out... Somehow. She needed to understand what this thing between the Slytherin and her meant. Whether it was worth the risk of ruining her friendship with Hermione and Ron over. She would tell them then. As soon as she had made sense of it all.
During the lesson she didn't dare question him about it because Malfoy was hovering around their table every now and then. There was no doubt he was looking for an opportunity to mess up her potion. She couldn't let her cauldron out of her sight for more than a few seconds, she had to keep an eye on Malfoy and on top of that she had to make sure not to mess up her potion herself.
"What… do you think?" he asked, sounding unusually shy. Haley's gaze wandered down to the pendant. Then her fingers followed, touching the small figure cautiously.
"No, it's fine. Let's do it today," Haley agreed. She was actually kind of looking forward to their first real meeting. And like Hermione said it was important that they learned to defend themselves. Still, she somehow had to let Malfoy know that she couldn't meet him tonight. Then she saw it. A blond head of hair emerging from one of the other green houses. Luna Lovegood.
"You should have remembered before going around bloody kissing other people behind her back! Does she know you're cheating on her?"
"I should really go now." She said defiantly. "But thank you for… you know… this." She didn't know how to put it into words properly. But she knew that Ron wasn't someone who easily talked about feelings.
"Thanks Hermi-" Haley started to say as she turned around to see if her friend was still around somewhere. But Hermione was nowhere to be found.
"Hold this, dear," Madame Pomfrey said, unscrewing the cap and handing it to Haley. "By the way… has there been any… change… concerning your state?" The woman asked, filling the spoon with a light blue liquid.
that? Why would I tell you I'm worried sick about – I just–" He buried his face in his hands. "This is so hard – just waiting – wondering if something happened – I should have gone with her!"
"Stop that." He frowned, his gaze focusing on her now. "What's… wrong with you? You're usually not this…" he trailed off, a soft pink blush dusting his cheeks. "Well, not like this."
Oh! Potter had jumped up from her seat and walked to the Ravenclaw table, as well. Was this the moment he'd been waiting for? The suspension was growing ever so slowly.
I sigh, "Sorry, mum," I place my bottle on top of the little table near the window and take a seat opposite her.
"To be expected?" Haley hissed, placing a soft pillow behind Draco's head and protectively wrapping an arm around him. "How about a small heads up next time? When will he wake up?"
"I am sure you are aware that your father was on a mission for the Dark Lord before he received his prison sentence?"
Haley shook her head. "No," she whispered as soon as she had calmed down from the shock of her friend's sudden appearance.
His motto? What could that be? Then something rings at the back of my mind. There were a couple of words inscribed to the back of his special pick… Could it be…?
"You know," he pressed, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively. "Besides snogging…what did you two get up to?"
Malfoy. He was back. Sitting at the Slytherin table and enjoying his breakfast like nothing was wrong. Like he hadn't missed three days of school for no good reason at all.
?" She was imagining flames burning him and leaving nothing but ashes. If this was what he was usually like with magic, she didn't know if she actually preferred him without it.
"What a relief that I don't have a crooked nose or a froggy mouth," Haley said sarcastically, when he pulled away.
"Honestly, I don't give a shit about the game! I'm only playing because it means so much to my dad!" Haley exploded. It felt incredibly liberating.
And then finally – now that it wasn't spinning any more – she could make out the writing inscribed to it. Two letters:
Malfoy made her face glow like a rising sun. Malfoy made her feel incredible in a way she couldn't even put into words. She was talking about
"You have to help me!" Haley stormed toward her friend, grabbing her arms. "How do I find him? I can't find my map and he's been missing all day! What if he's hurt or lost or hungry or-"
"What?" I grumble moodily. I'm desperately trying to come up with a plan to turn this around and squeeze some more secrets out of him.
Lying on a blanket underneath a magic umbrella that recorded memories together with bloody Draco Malfoy who had fallen asleep on top of her. What a crazy picture this painted.
So, instead of wasting her breath on hollow phrases, she tightly wrapped her arm around his middle and rested her head on his chest.
"What do you mean you helped me through all the tasks…?" What was he on about? Had she missed something?
The Slytherin smirked in the most annoying way. "I could be wrong but I thought that was your name," he drawled smugly.
"Nonsense," her mother, Lily Potter admonished, "I know for a fact that you love Hogwarts. Why would you want to stay here with your boring old parents when you could learn how to brew the
"I'm sorry for doing that to you." He looked up at her then, eyes brimming with sincerity and something like… remorse.
Lily nodded contentedly. "All right. Shall we go down and try the potion then?" Her sudden suggestion seemed to startle everyone sitting around the table.
He forced his mouth into a mocking smirk that probably looked more like a grimace and quickly sat down again, willing the exam to be over. Each second ticking by seemed to last an eternity. Then Tofty returned. Without her. What was wrong with her? What had happened? Was she sick? Hurt? Was it merely the stress?
He thought he'd never find another opportunity to speak to her before the summer break. But that evening, after the end-of-year feast, he saw her wandering off toward the two oak doors, away from her house mates, who were returning to their tower. Where was she going? This was his chance!
happened to you?" The brunette asked astounded, taking a proper look at her. "If I didn't know any better I would say…"
," Malfoy whispered with an amused grin. Haley rolled her eyes over his childishness. For a moment it seemed as if there was something else he wanted to say but he stayed silent.
Lovegood seemed to contemplate him. Then she smiled softly. "I understand. They are probably filled with love and affection."
"Look, I don't think you're spying on me or anything. But I can't just… you know…" She finished lamely, waving around with her hands vaguely in an attempt to make him understand what she couldn't properly put into words.
"Isn't that Luna?" Ron asked, obviously having spotted the girl as well, "We can go over and tell her about the meeting!"
Haley snorted. But she let him help her up. And when they left the sad doomy class room behind, she didn't let go of his hand.
I barely register the song continuing on without either of us as the boy dances his way over to me. He stops in front of me and does another one of his ridiculous moves, making me chuckle more. My head bounces to the beat and my body has started to move along with the music almost against my own will.
Haley's face fell. Again she was filled with the intense urge to run back to him. The way he'd cried into her pyjama shirt last night. The way he'd clung to her.
"Choose the path that is expected of you and hope that either the Dark Lord has mercy or that you are strong enough to survive whatever he has planned."
She wished there was something, anything, she could say to make him feel better. But there was nothing. She couldn't even begin to comprehend what it had to be like, losing your magic and along with it all hope to ever get it back again. It was impossible to imagine.
The boy and the elf turn around simultaneously. It's a sight so bizarre it seems unfair I'm the only one witnessing it. Malfoy gets up and grins at me. If my sudden appearance surprises him, he doesn't show it. "It's as good as done. You want to come and have a look at it?" He sounds kind of proud.
But my fall doesn't last long. Before I can count to five, Draco appears below me and catches me, lowering me onto his broom in front of him.
Before he could ask any more questions, she sprinted over to the couch and hugged him like a storm spirit had possessed her. "No. It hasn't even started."
"Are you cold?" The voice of Draco Malfoy asked lowly from her right. She had almost forgotten he was there. They had been sitting there on the edge of the Astronomy tower, looking out across the school grounds below them for a while. It seemed surreal that she could sit there next to the Slytherin and appreciate the silence of the peaceful night.
not to, and instead – well, instead he followed Potter to the library. The way she had watched the Ravenclaw table. You would think, she wanted to sit over there with the know-it-alls! As far as Draco knew, Potter did
"But sometimes," he interrupted her, "I'm doing my best to ignore it because there are things that are more important." He whispered that last part. Was he talking about her? He was so close that she could feel his breath on her face. Was he going to kiss her? She glanced at his lips briefly, realising that she wanted him to kiss her. She looked back into his eyes that were shining silvery and with a hint of blue. They seemed so steady, so sure like he exactly knew what it was that he wanted. But she still didn't know what it was that
It doesn’t take this long this time around. He bites his lips nervously, as he lets go and shows me what he’s drawn. There are two words dancing on my skin now. The first is
"W-What?" She blinked, only now realizing that she was breathing heavily and her hands were clenched to fists.
"Watch someone dream? I've never heard of that before… Is that what you did? How you know all of these things about me? You spied on me? While I was sleeping?" He visibly became angrier with every question he asked.
Almost as if he had heard her thoughts Malfoy re-opened his eyes making her hand that had moved on its own stop in mid-air. It fell to the blanket near Malfoy's head but judging from his raised eyebrow he had already seen it and made the connection. Feeling suddenly exposed, Haley cleared her throat awkwardly and looked away. She was acutely aware of how furiously her heart was beating. Could he hear it, too?
Oh. He probably wanted to shower. If he'd spent all that time in the abandoned class room, he probably hadn't showered in days. It made her feel really bad for him.
. They were all here, caught in a memory, caught in the bloom of youth. Haley wanted to cry. How much she wished she could talk to them. Or reach out her hand to touch and make sure it was real. Only it wasn't real. It was only a memory. Snape's memory. The man himself was walking a few ways behind her and the marauders, his nose stuck in a stack of notes. How strange it was to see them all so young.
"You still haven't reached 4000 yet," a hippogriff informs me as I start to scramble to my feet. What do I do? What do I do? Hermione! I jump over toward my friend's bed and throw the bed curtains open. The scream dies in my throat as I spot the hippogriff that is sleeping in Hermione's bed instead of her.
"Thanks Ron," she whispered, lunging forward to give him a quick hug. Maybe he didn't say a lot but when you needed a friend you could always count on him.
The note didn't say anything more than that. He wanted to meet her… At the green houses. That was a good sign, right? He was giving her a chance to explain… She had to go. At once, Haley jumped to her feet and left a confused Hermione behind.
"Fire away, then, Rita," she said serenely, as the older woman picked up her Quick-Quotes Quill and smoothed out a blank roll of parchment on the table.
For a moment, he looked as if he was going to argue but Haley pressed her fingers to his mouth to stop him. "Don't fight me on this. You're stuck with me now."
I take another step toward him, fixing him with a fiery glare. "How dare you stand here and comfort her when it's your fault that she's hurt in the first place?"
No wonder she had been confused when Draco wasn't giving her a chance to understand him. He hadn't even been able to properly confess his feelings to her. And then it happened seemingly all on its own. All of the walls he had so carefully constructed were crumbling down around him and suddenly there was nothing but
This was too much. Haley leaped between the two and forced him to look at her. "That's enough. You're scaring her. She's only a child."
The corridor feels lonely without her cheerfulness. But it doesn't matter much since I'm not planning on staying here for very long.
"I didn't say that. You can do what you want but… an insincere apology… that's just a waste of time." She hadn't meant to sound this bitter toward the end.
Emily's eyes widened and she pulled at the door again but the boy was faster. He pulled the door open completely and was about to reach into the cabinet, when the potato sack lifted off the ground and slammed into him, taking him off his feet.
He drew his own wand just as quickly, thinking of a fitting hex but before he could decide on one that was nasty enough, the door to the kitchen opened.
With a satisfied smirk, Baz moved his white rook across the field, kicking Simon's black knight out of the way. "Rookie Mistake," he taunted smugly.
Hello! I haven't posted in ages but here is an update! Finally. What did you think of the chapter? I was going to keep this fairly light and happy but I'm afraid there will be some angst soon... It won't be too heavy though :D
"Look," Lupin started. "I wouldn't like you to judge your father on what you saw there, Haley. He was only fifteen–"
What the-? Do I remind him of an owl or a kangaroo? I honestly don’t know what to think of this. So, I cluck my tongue impatiently and reach for the quill and his arm.
"Oh look, there's another one." Luna noted, placing a second metal owl in front of him. "Did you want to use it?"
Another tear rolled silently down her face. Sirius seemed to follow it with his eyes, until it finally dropped to the carpet, leaving a tiny dark stain. She lifted her hand to touch his arm but he pulled away from her. Was that it? Did he believe it now? She tried to brace herself for the judgement that was bound to come.
"And?" It's probably the most stupid thing I could have asked. But there is this weird electric tension in the air that makes me almost doubt that this is a dream. It feels too real. Too intimate. The dark night… the fireflies… the music… the dancing…
"You could have told me though," Haley said, leaning forward a bit. And then she did two things. One thing she herself wasn't expecting and the other thing, she had been wanting to do for a long time. She slipped from the bench to the ground until she was situated in front of Malfoy. Kneeling as well. Then she reached for his shoulder and let her hand rest on top of it softly.
Haley reached for his hand and gently uncurled his fingers one by one. She didn't know what to say. How to find words that would comfort him.
"It's not a problem," he said with a smile. "Just tell me when your done. I'll tell the others, too."
"Oh, thank Merlin!" Haley gasped in relief. She had spotted her essay almost all the way to the end of the table. But nonetheless, there it was.
"Is it not?" Snape questioned. "That is exactly what I asked old Regulus. And he gave me an interesting answer."
"Not bad, Potter," Malfoy said and grinned at her amusedly, "Come here, I'll show you how it works." He held out his hand in invitation and the sun made his eyes shine mirthfully. She noticed that his fake glasses were gone and his hair was starting to turn blond again.
"I think I have an idea," he says instead, surprising me. "Follow me." He gets up from the bed, grabs my hand and pulls me toward the door.
Haley nodded. "Yes, I'm sorry about that. And thank you," she said, stifling a yawn. She was glad Hermione believed she had been behaving so strangely just because of her tiredness and nothing else. She didn't know whether she could tell her about what she had seen in Malfoy's dream even if she wanted to.
He thought it had been progress. But after the night on the Astronomy tower Haley seemed even less like herself than before.
her, obviously," he drawled, glancing at the girl briefly, curious about her reaction to that. He wasn't hoping she would say something like
"I… " She swallowed nervously. "Next time! I–I'll tell you next time, after we're done with the exams."
"Well, that's a serious accusation," I say, leaning down slightly so that I can look into Malfoy's eyes more directly, "Can you prove it?"
A few moments later she found herself climbing up the stairs toward the owlery. It was less crowded than during the day. Most of the owls were probably out hunting. Between hunting and delivering letters, when did they even find time to sleep?
funny, Potter. You think the whole bloody world kneels at your feet just because you have that atrocious scar on your face. Well, wake up, Potter," he raised an eyebrow scornfully, "You're just an average, little girl with no parents and lots of imagination that people used to feel pity for. And now… now that's over, too."
I stop in the air, too surprised to do anything but watch him fly away from me. I wish I could see his face. His shoulders are shaking and I wonder if he's crying or laughing.
"He's coming!" Someone whispered and then his vision was filled with an orange fur ball that was trying to rip his robes to shreds.
"Wait – what?" Haley asked, but her friend had already pulled her back in the direction they had come from.
And three, if she found out what he was hiding and could actually prove it, she had him. He would never dare to harass her again. A grin spread slowly across her face. It seemed like she had to go visit the dream corridor again tonight.
Haley had been so lost in her own thoughts that she hadn't paid attention to where she was going. She was standing in the middle of the stair case that lead up to their tower with her shoe stuck inside one of the trick steps. Ron had caught her arm, so that she wouldn't fall.
"I want to fix it myself." He almost growled. "If I can't even do that…" He shook his head, balling his hand to a fist.
"Hey, don't put that on my puzzle," Ginny grumbled, picking up the paper that Hermione had discarded so carelessly. Her gaze fell on Ron and she rolled her eyes. "You're drooling," she said derisively.
How much she had missed the burrow, she only realized when she returned to the inviting and homey house two weeks into the summer holidays.
She was right. He'd heard it, too. He would recognize her voice everywhere. Potter was talking to someone. And it sounded like she was really close.
"You look like you just found out someone hid your pet snake at the bottom of the Great Lake," she joked, trying for humour.
"Fine," she found herself saying with a sigh, although there were a thousand voices in her head screaming that she needed to take him to the hospital wing. But the vehemence with which he was putting up a fight moved her. She had the feeling it had really hurt his pride what had happened tonight and for once she didn't want to embarrass him further. She wanted to see him smile again. She also didn't want to deny him this little wish after what he had gone through tonight.
Her head had travelled into the kitchen of Number twelve, Grimmauld Place. Instead of Sirius it was Lupin who greeted her. But after a moment him and Sirius were kneeling on the ground in front of her.
For another indefinable while, Haley lost herself in his touch, his scent, the taste of his lips until –
"Hm." She said glancing over to the window thoughtfully. "Still. I think it's best if you give him time. It's almost curfew anyway."
"Are you sure you can afford that?" An invisible voice asked. Ron and Haley looked around in surprise. A head of curly, hazel hair appeared from behind a huge mountain of wobbly wool hats.
"Yes, basically." He grinned. "And you know, so he won't tell mum about our latest invention for Weasley's Wizard Wheezes."
Draco froze. She hadn't noticed him yet. He could still turn around and go. She'd never even realize he had been there. Or he could stay… it wasn't as if he could avoid her forever. Go or stay? He didn't know which was the right thing to do. He didn't know–
Without much motivation he continued with his afternoon pastime: mindlessly throwing pebbles at the peacocks. When he was younger he used to enjoy this game much more. Watching them scurry away in surprise and then come closer to see if he had thrown something edible. Which he did, every now and then. But the peacocks never knew when of course. He used to find it incredibly amusing. But somehow… it wasn't the same. This silly game didn't make him feel anything. Least of all, joy or pleasure.
was with her now. They were talking about something but Draco couldn't hear what it was. He had to get closer. Before he could get up from his seat, though, he saw a group of students enter the library.
"Don't be stupid, Potter," said Malfoy and she knew without turning around that he was rolling his eyes. She grinned. Then there was a hand on her wrist, pulling her back and turning her around.
Carefully, she removed the rest of the letter paper from underneath the bird and carried it over to her desk, turning on the lamp. Her movements felt sluggish as if she was sleep-walking. She sat down in her desk chair and smoothed down the paper, carefully inspecting it for tears or holes.
coming from behind her. Frowning in confusion she turned around only to see a small white cat sitting where the Slytherin had been before. The cat was glaring at her, fixing its grey confused eyes on her. It seemed like she knew now what kind of effect George's toffee had. She only wished the boy would have told her. Or given her a hint as to how the effect could be reversed. Malfoy, the cat, looked at her accusingly, his tail swinging back and forth like a whip.
Potter looking up at him with those grass green eyes, framed by delicate lashes and with her pink lips in a pout was his undoing. All this time he had been longing to see her again. The memory of her face slowly fading day by day. Now his mind had gone blank and he didn't understand why he was doing anything but kissing her. He slowly leant down without having decided to do so and didn't even try to fight the irresistible pull of her lips. He felt like a butterfly that was drawn to the sweet nectar of a beautiful spring flower.
"But you didn't know that. You didn't think. And one day when you're not so lucky this is going to get you killed!"
Almost. She had been about to exit the train when somebody came up behind her and pushed her right out of the train. She landed on the platform on her hands and knees, getting bruises all over them.
He frowned, opening his mouth to argue. Then he looked around the big dark Charms class room sceptically. He wasn't afraid of the dark, was he?
Right. Purposefully, I make my way over to mum's mint green door. How do I open it again? Get the key from the cauldron while avoiding the flames. Check. Then push it into the lock and unlock the door. Check. And… I'm in.
Instead of continuing to ponder the matter, the girl focused her attention on the sandwiches. They were delicious. She ate one sandwich after another, realizing that the last meal she’d had had been lunch the day before.
The moment, she arrived in the owlery, she realised that she didn't even bring a quill or something to write on. How intelligent of her. But fortunately, it didn't take her long to spot a lost pen in one of the corners, almost hidden by old feathers and dust. Seemed like someone had forgotten it. She picked it up, trying not to wonder where the dark stains stemmed from and scanned the place for a piece of paper. There was none. Her eyes wandered to the book in her hand. She could rip out one of the pages or… Beneath the letter was another piece of paper. There were strange symbols all over it but the backside was blank. It didn't seem like someone would miss it. She started to fill the blank page with sentences that reflected how furious and betrayed she felt.
Draco had reached the Transfigurations class rooms, when a familiar voice made him stop. Wasn't that Weasley? He could ask him! Surely, he knew where Haley was or what had happened-
"What? I'm fine. I don't need to go to the hospital wing." He protested. Did she really need to embarrass him further?
The sight made her feel incredibly guilty although technically she hadn't even touched the instrument.
"And obviously doesn't approve." Draco scoffed, fishing another letter out of his bag. This one was fresh from that morning.
"What choice do I have but to give up?" Draco interrupted. "Besides, she's the one who gave up first!
Hermione sighed. "There's never going to be 'the right moment'! Just get it over with. If he really cares about you, he'll understand and forgive you."
Draco wanted to protest, but Granger shook her head barely noticeably. She seemed to have a plan. He glanced over at Haley who surprisingly didn't show any indication of an emotion.
The confusion had to be evident on her face because Malfoy sighed, running a hand across his face. "What I'm trying to say is, I'm s-" He broke off mid-word, clamping his mouth shut. He looked at her, calculating. It seemed as if he was searching her face for something. Then he cleared his throat and looked away. "I'm done wasting my time playing childish games with you. Here." He took something out of his shoulder bag and handed it to her. "I have no use for this any longer."
He sighed heavily. "Anyway, I won't go after him," he muttered. "And I also… won't tell anyone… about this."
At night the dreams returned. Not every night, though. They seemed to become fewer and fewer. She almost looked forward to them. Because the dreams brought Sirius back to her. But the moment she woke up, they took him away again. It was like a bittersweet ritual she repeated every other night. The dreams weren't even pleasant in any way. Like before, she saw Sirius being captured inside a glass prison every time. Never being able to escape.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Come on, it could have been worse." This had been harmless compared to being turned into a cat or falling off a broomstick.
, Draco asked himself, when his eyes landed on the two people in the centre of the room. His first impulse upon seeing his professor's hand curled around Haley's arm was to rip it away and pull the girl to his side. But he stopped himself in the last moment. The potion master would know right away that something was wrong. To think he had only come here because he had heard of Potter's extra lessons and hadn't been able to keep the curiosity at bay. And now he had walked into this – whatever
"I'm so in love with you." He whispered, a part of him wanting her to hear it and another part hoping she wouldn't. But she had to know it already anyway. He felt like his love was painfully obvious in everything he did. Shining through every glance, every word, every touch.
"I don't know how much you've thought about it but – I don't understand how you could just stop." He hated the look she was giving him. It was filled with disappointment and the kind of resignation that you feel for someone you kind of already expected to let you down. It made him incredibly angry.
Neville chuckled softly. "I'm sorry about the things I said that day… I shouldn't have doubted you."
"Come on," he whines. His tone makes me chuckle because he might look fifteen now but he still behaves like a child.
Draco gasped, instinctively raising his hand, reaching out to her… but something stopped him from actually touching her. "Haley," he whispered instead, her name the only thing he could think of to say.
"Imagine there is a door… and if you step through that door you can watch someone dream. Even talk to them while they're dreaming." She was sure she wasn't explaining it right. Her mum was so much better at this.
"I – I didn't…" Emily quietened, chewing on her lips harder. "I only took it because it's one of the Marauder's legendary treasures and… because I was annoyed at you for not taking the training seriously!"
So, she started with telling her what her mum had told her, about the dream corridor, shared dreams and revelations.
"Just a note book, I think," Haley muttered and tried to slip it into her school bag quickly. It never reached her school bag. Instead it slipped from her hands and landed on the ground, opened on the first page.
This was better than flying. In fact, Draco felt like he was floating somewhere above the clouds. It was ridiculous. But it was real. As real as the girl he was finally holding in his arms.
"Well, lately, I guess. There's that one ballad, the master keeps listening to all night, you see. From one of our ballad albums. It used to be the hit two years ago-" Myron claps his hands in front of his mouth like he had said something he hadn't wanted to say.
Something clouded over in the Ravenclaw's eyes. She smiled softly, almost pityingly at the boy, before turning to Haley. "When is the next meeting going to be?" She asked, her tone light.
Haley agreed. She found it a bit disconcerting that she could still taste Malfoy's lips on her mouth.
Malfoy stares at me, frowning. Then he grins. "I always thought you played quidditch like a Slytherin."
?" She heard Hermione asking and turned around. Hermione was holding onto Ron's arm who was following them as well.
"Granted your wish," I say with a smirk. "All that's left now is some eye-liner and you're ready for the next Weird Sisters concert."
"I don't understand," Haley said helplessly. This was all too much. The sudden onslaught of emotions was threatening to overwhelm her again. She couldn't explain why she was so shocked. Maybe because it was different to desperately hope for something, all the while doubting herself and her sanity, and then suddenly having her assumption confirmed. It wasn't easy to digest.
"It's nothing, I just -" Images flashed before her eyes. Cold grey, eyes. Merciless laughter. Long blond hair behind a black mask.
In that exact moment Ron emerged from the greenhouse, his arms full of lemons. "Is that enough?" He asked glancing from Luna to Haley and back.
He wasn't in the Owlery. Or the Infirmary. Maybe, she really should have asked Pansy Parkinson. Where could he be? Why was no one else worried about him? Haley sank to her knees up in her tower, sifting through the contents of her trunk once more. And where in Merlin's name had her map gone? It wasn't in her drawer either. There were only her hairbrush and… the gobstone.
"Yes, luckily for you, your class mate was clever enough to inform me of your incredibly reckless endeavour."
"Do you fancy me, Potter?" He said it in such a cruel and mocking way that Haley felt sick to her stomach. She was clenching her fist so hard, that the note inside it would have been crushed to tiny little pieces, if it had been something other than a piece of paper.
"Just you wait," she whispered angrily. She was going to show him what she was capable of. It was time to fight back.
"I don't know. I didn't read it." Her matter-of-fact way of saying that baffled him slightly. She had probably not even considered reading it. Were all non-Slytherins like that? Probably not.
I sigh. This reminds me of something else. Another dream. Right. Hedwig did the same thing to me. Which makes me remember how scared
"Shush. We've worried enough for a decade. We should do something fun now." She looked at his red, shadowed eyes that screamed SLEEP DEPRIVED. "Feel like taking a nap?"
Potter's eyes widened considerably. Did the mere thought of telling someone about their date seem this absurd to her?
Draco's eyes widened. What was Potter doing, biting her lips? Was she trying to flirt with Conners or something? When he saw her slightly furrowed eyebrows, he calmed down a little. She was probably only
Peculiar were the fruits hanging between the twigs and leaves. They were red with yellow stripes and shaped like little spirals.
Then an idea strikes me. A broomstick! I'm sure I could fly with a broomstick. As soon as the idea crosses my mind a broom the size of a toothpick appears on the ground next to me. Merlin, I'm so
It seemed like she was done waiting for an answer. Or maybe she hadn't been waiting in the first place?
"Haley, look." Neville whispered insistently. She followed his gaze toward a small grey insect that was sitting between the tree roots and staring at them out of its big black eyes. "The glumbumble," he whispered excitedly.
"And then your eyes light up like they're made of fire," he continued. "It's as if they're ready to scorch anyone who dares to look at them the wrong way. Even the air around you gets electrified and your hair seems like its aflame. Actually, it's like you turn into your own personal fire storm. It's beautiful. More than that. Breathtaking."
she thought to herself but she bit her lips before the words could slip out. He would probably contradict her anyway.
"Have you started packing yet? You know you won't have much time tomorrow, before we're leaving." Lily said for the fifth time that day.
He felt the sudden urge to apologize. But for what? For his father? For himself? For enjoying putting others down? For everything that made things complicated between them?
. My fingers slip once or twice but Myron Wagtail doesn't seem to notice. Or maybe he notices and still lets me in. I can't be sure. He gives me a wink. Whatever that's supposed to mean.
"Whatever," Parkinson said arrogantly, taking a bowl of worms back to her own bowtruckle, Millicent Bulstrode in tow.
Potter bit her lips, frowning slightly. "I knew it was a stupid idea," she mumbled, before reaching for the box and taking it away from him. He wanted to protest but he still hadn't found his voice. Fortunately, the girl only removed something blue from below the biscuits as it seemed, and gave the present back to him, placing the blue thing on top of the biscuits.
"Who?" I ask in return, enjoying the company of my little brother. As long as he's not trying to get both of us killed.
"You've always enjoyed that far too much," Lily whispered, while she continued to massage her scalp.
"I know. It's okay. I won't tell her." Young Haley combs her fingers through his hair and smiles warmly at him.
" She cried in horror, while another head appeared behind her, making it look as if she now had a different head. A boy's head.
"Er… her godfather sent it," he whispered, feeling stupidly scared for a moment just because he was talking about the famous mass murderer. He had to remind himself that he wasn't actually a mass murderer. And that he wasn't going to come kill him just because he mentioned him in a conversation. But still. Old habits died hard.
"I think you'd have noticed if I was a vampire," the boy mumbled, still chuckling slightly. "Honestly Potter, just because my hands are a little cold? Did you pay attention during Defence Against the Dark Arts at all?"
The boy watches me for a long moment. Then he snorts, looking away. "All right. I'll tell you a secret," he agrees. Wonderful. This is going better than I imagined! "But in return for that…" he looks back at me, a smirk splitting his face in two. "I get a kiss."
a mean voice added in his mind. Before he could let this rile him up, something made him stop. Protection…
after all waiting for Hermione and Ron. Who else? There was no one else for her to wait for. No one. Not even-
,' Hermione had said, when Haley had told her about her worries. Which was true, of course. Still, Haley had a bad feeling about Sirius staying at Grimmauld Place and closing himself off from the world. Therefore she made sure to talk to him before they had to leave for school.
After a while I see something familiar. It's a brightly coloured door with a huge package next to it that's blinking wildly and has the word
Malfoy caught her wrist swiftly, pulling her close until their noses were almost touching. There was that scent again. It was different today though. They hadn't been in the woods. A mix of lavender and mint and the faint trace of sweat. It made her feel slightly dazed. She wondered if kissing him now would feel different than it had yesterday because she felt more awake now. There was a soft – barely there – brush of skin against hers. It sent a rush of pleasure up her spine, making the short hairs on the back of her neck stand up. Then it was gone. She opened her eyes, glancing at the boy who was watching her hesitantly.
"Our tree house!" He exclaims gleefully, gesturing upwards. I follow his gaze into the treetops. Wait. Something that I could swear hasn't been there a second ago is looming above us. It's hard to tell how far away it is.
!" She cried, on her knees. Fingers buried in her hair. Tears were welling up in her eyes. She looked up at the ceiling, trying to keep them from spilling over.
I gently take the quill from his hand and start to write two words on his skin. When I’m done I put the quill down.
There weren't many students in the halls. Either everyone was still in the Great Hall for dinner or… it was already over and they had all gone to their common rooms.
"Your dreams?" She asked breathlessly. "But you never… You dreamed of confessing your lo– your feelings to me?" She would have remembered that.
I hum non-commitally but don't say anything else. If I just pretend long enough that there is nothing to say, she might leave the matter alone. For a few seconds it seems like my strategy is working but then the world suddenly turns upside-down. My arms tighten around Hedwig's neck, purely on reflex, which is the only thing that keeps me from falling into nothingness again.
He had been mad at her at first. And angry. And hurt. Of course he had been. But reading her letters and finding out about her godfather's survival that no one had even bothered to tell her about – and letting her uselessly suffer instead – had washed away the last traces of anger. Or had rather directed his anger elsewhere. Now he only wanted to hold her and never let go again. Even if the person he had to fight was Haley herself. Although he really hoped it wouldn't come to that.
"Most likely. Nobody knows for sure." Professor Snape answered, taking a sip of tea. "After that incident, he has never been seen again. And the other wizard… he never used magic again to this day."
"So..." he began, studying his fingernails absently. His fingers were paler than usual. They were as cold as icicles. He really should have worn something warmer. "you don't want to know what's on my list?"
Haley. She had her back turned to them and was bending over slightly to pick up a book. So, that's where the noise had come from.
"Well, I don't like people following me around and spying on me." She didn't know why she couldn't just let this go. Maybe it was because everything else the Slytherin had said was so difficult to make sense of.
Haley bit her lips dejectedly. She hated feeling like a failure. Like the Hat really did something wrong, putting her into Gryffindor. What would her dad think of her now? Before she could sink deeper into the circle of self-doubting, someone cleared their throat loudly. Malfoy turned around in alarm, looking straight at her hooded face.
The boy shrugged. "It's just lore, isn't it? I wasn't planning on using it anyway. Although, I could use some protection, I guess."
"Ten points from Gryffindor. And should I catch the two of you after curfew again, I will personally reduce fifty points from both of your houses." There was a warning in his voice, that seemed to imply something else. Something dangerous. She wanted to know what Malfoy thought about this. But with Snape present, she didn't dare to ask him.
Mum waves her hand at me in a dismissive way. "Technicalities. Didn't you say you had things to attend to?"
"It's nothi-" Draco started to say with the beginning of a smile, that froze on his face before he could finish. "What did you call me just now?"
"Humans," she mumbles, before fixing me with an inquisitive look. "Have you found what you've been looking for?" She asks, looking like an ordinary curious little child.
She had to stop herself from saying 'Yes, I have. Don't you remember? When you serenaded me in your dream?' Maybe it was that easy. Maybe this was the moment where she was meant to tell him about the dreams. Maybe –
"Do you want to know a secret?" Haley heard his voice close to her ear. Then his fingers slowly crawled toward her waist. She shook her head but didn't fight his arms wrapping around her.
She shook her head. It had been a few weeks after her and Neville's break-up. She had been moping around and avoiding people until Simon had dragged her outside to try that new amazing place where they had the best scones ever. She hadn't been able to resist his pleading face. They had run around London all day, looking for the highly praised place, only to find it closed in the end. And because Simon didn't function without a proper amount of food in his stomach, they had opted for the next best place. Where they had been served the best ramen ever. The dish had tasted so amazing that it had made her forget about her broken heart for the first time in weeks. She had found that the world wasn't as bleak as it had seemed before and even genuinely smiled. And from that day on, ramen had become her comfort food of sorts.
Draco shuddered. There was a dark glint in her eyes that made him wonder why she hadn't been put into Slytherin.
Before she could make up her mind though her wand landed on the ground, rolling slowly out of her reach. Damn. Malfoy had opened his eyes and was holding her now empty hand in a tight grip.
The girl was right. Haley had almost looked like she was about to faint. It had been so hard not to run to her side and make sure she was okay.
"And if nothing else works… do you remember that spell we found with the little yellow birds? I've been itching to try it out on someone." She grinned cheekily.
"Oh, not much," the boy answered casually. "Just the bit about… Haley dating a certain Slytherin. So nothing new." He flopped down onto the couch lazily.
"Oh," she said, feeling a heavy weight in her stomach. She hadn't given him a reply yet and it was almost one week after they had talked.
"What was that?" He asked, eyeing something behind her warily. Before she could turn around or wonder what that strange squeaking sound might belong to, Draco was already rushing past her to check.
"Of course," Haley made sure to convey that she really meant what she said, "Good luck with your assignments!"
"He's lying," I tell him. "It's far too early for the letters. And you're not supposed to know spells before coming to school."
"She's Ron Weasley's sister," Lovegood clarified, taking a biscuit from her box. "Do you want to try one?"
He caught her hand to stop her from pinching his poor skin any further. "Why don't you go and see for yourself?"
Haley couldn't find her breath. "Sirius!" She cried, asking – no ordering her godfather to stop hiding behind that stupid veil and come back to her. How could he scare her like that? How could he – make her wait and –
But she couldn't even find the tree house. The birch trees were there. But no sign of a house up in the branches or a ladder leading toward it.
Hello folks! Ramen is like one of my favourite foods ever. Could you tell? Oh my, so much is happening in the chapter! What do you think?
Haley sighed. Couldn't Ron have kept that to himself? Now Hermione probably thought she was completely losing it.
Haley sighed but finally tore her eyes away and glanced at the crup in front of her instead. The last thing she wanted was to get caught by Umbridge. There probably was a reasonable explanation for this. Maybe Luna hadn't got around to giving him the note yet. It wasn't even noon! There was still plenty of time until tonight. She had to be a bit more patient. Maybe the Greengrass girl had only explained something to him. Something about crups. That was why he seemed so engrossed in her words…
She couldn't decide it on her own. It was time to get some advise. With renewed determination Haley crawled out of her bed and went over to Hermione's. She peeked through the curtains to see if her friend was still awake.
"Go on ahead, I'll be just a minute," she found herself telling her friends, before turning to the Slytherin expectantly. The boy turned around and without another word started walking down the hallway. Before her friends had the chance to talk her out of it, she followed him.
Ron sighed. "If you say so," he muttered. They had reached the end of the stairs now. "Look at that git," Ron continued distastefully, "The way he prances about the hall, you might think he owns the place."
"Be quiet!" He cried, getting to his feet. Away from her. "You had no right! How dare you sneak into someone's head – How – I – Not even father – I –" He buried his hands in his hair, tugging at it violently. He looked so utterly pained. It broke something inside her.
Honestly, it was just a little bit of rain. Nothing to be scared of. Haley was more worried what she was going to do about her friends' questions.
He snorted. "Am I a girl? Why would I like such a cheesy song?" He muttered, crossing his arms and looking away. Were his cheeks turning red?
Haley crossed her arms in front of her chest. Pouting. "Like I'm some failed experiment." She mumbled quietly. "Just help me fix this."
"Partly. But at some point I realized… that it didn't matter that you didn't remember. We could always make new memories." He smiled. But there was a sad tinge to it. "But again… I was too late." He chuckled darkly. "You were already with… with… with…
She chuckled in amusement. Then she snaked her arms around his neck and pecked his lips softly – effectively silencing him. "I want to," Haley whispered, against his mouth, pressing another kiss onto it. "I want to go on a date with you… on Valentines Day."
"What do you need an umbrella for? It doesn't look like it's going to rain any time soon," Haley said. The weather was actually rather nice. It was warm enough to take off her jacket. Underneath she was wearing a light blue, long-sleeved shirt.
And luckily there was a small opening between two shelves that he was able to squeeze through. Another step to the left and he was mostly hidden from the view of anyone who was possibly coming to his and Lovegood's corner. And just in time it seemed.
Hermione's sleeping form was resting peacefully under her covers. Haley smiled at the sight. At least there was one person who didn't seem to be troubled by strange dreams.
And now her whole house probably hated her. Awesome. After she had finished her shower, the only person left in the changing room was Ron. It was hard to tell who of them felt worse. Ron had let his fair share of quaffles through the goal hoops. He probably felt just as bad as her. Wordlessly, the two friends stepped outside, where they were greeted by Hermione and Luna.
His words conjured up a much too vivid image of Malfoy's dream in front of her inner eye. She almost shuddered at the memory of the Slytherin screaming
Everyone turned to the girl. And that's when Haley noticed four things. One, Ron and Ginny respectively had drawn their wands and were threateningly pointing them at Malfoy. Two, Hermione had stood from her seat as well, her mouth was hanging open, as if she had been about to say something nasty. Three, Neville was gripping a plant that kind of looked like a cactus and was pointing something thin and sharp at it. And four, maybe the most curious of them all, Malfoy had staggered back in surprise after hearing Luna speak and was silently forming the word
"I'm s– I'm s-so- I'm sorry for doing all these things to you!" He yelled that last sentence, as if the intensity somehow made the words come easier.
"Luna!" She greeted her loudly. "Did you get him the message? What does he say? Will he come tonight?" She sounded too eager but she didn't care at this point.
One second more and he would have cursed Umbridge out of her office. He felt slightly disappointed he'd lost that chance. What was Granger talking about anyway? A secret weapon? For Dumbledore? That couldn't be true, could it? And now her and Haley were going to show it to Umbridge? Draco didn't want to let Haley go anywhere alone with that crazy woman. Even if Granger was with them.
"What do you think you're – you – you can't just–" Great. Now she couldn't even form a coherent sentence anymore.
Lily raised an eyebrow, which made Haley almost think, she was going to protest. But to her surprise, her mother nodded. "Fine." She said. And winked at her…?
His head felt as if there were a million tiny little fire flies flying around inside of it, making him dizzy. And wasn't he floating? No, his feet were definitely still on the ground. A quick look confirmed that. As he looked up again, he noticed that Haley wasn't laughing anymore. She was still smiling though.
A second later the book was snatched out of her hands and carelessly dropped to the floor. "Hey, what are you-?" Haley started to complain.
Sitting on his bed in the middle of the night, he glanced over to his desk. A million times, he'd pulled out the letter paper and picked up the quill, ready to pour everything that weighed on his heart onto the paper. But every single time, he ended up dropping the quill and discarding the plan. There was no one he could ask. Not if he didn't want his letter to be intercepted.
"I'm sure you had your reasons," she purred, trailing her fingers down his arm slowly. He shuddered visibly in response. The words were ridiculous, of course. He had been making her life hell for more than a year! But the words came to her like she was acting in a play and the prompter had whispered the lines into her ear. Lines that fit her new character and would put her fellow actor at ease.
"Oh. Such a surprise, seeing you here." Malfoy greeted her. He was leaning against the wall next to the entrance. What was he doing here?
"Leave her alone, Malfoy," Neville said calmly. His voice might have been calm but there was something threatening in his gaze. The Slytherin sneered at him angrily, which uncomfortably reminded Haley of the unsettling dream.
"Yes." He admitted reluctantly. "It can happen." It usually didn't happen though. He hated being cold. But he had been so eager to meet her that he had barely remembered pulling on his cloak. It wasn't something he planned to tell her.
Once he was satisfied with his work, he wandered over to the table and sat down in a chair next to Haley, from which he was able to watch the little potato cupboard without potatoes.
“Why?” I ask but comply anyway. He pulls my hand across the table toward him and slowly runs his fingers over my palm.
. That was the title of the thick volume Draco slapped onto the library table in front of Luna Lovegood.
or something), Haley spontaneously decided to join her. Not because she hoped to find a certain Slytherin in the back of the library. That would be foolish. She only went there because there was this book she wanted to check out about advanced potion brewing. Because she loved nothing more than potions, obviously. Well, Hermione had only sent her a knowing glance, when she started making her excuses and told her she'd wait for her in front of the library.
But the damage was already done. Her exhilaration from lunch break that had filled her with lightness and joy was gone. Like a candle blown out by the wind. Taking away all the warmth and leaving her cold.
." She raised her chin defiantly. "I'm returning this to you because without it, I can't walk into your dreams."
"You didn't know?" Lovegood asked, "I've seen the Lion Princess maybe half an hour ago, she was sitting somewhere in the front part of the library."
It was hard for Draco to actually derive meaning from the words Conners was saying, since hus ears were still filled with cotton wool. But he was still able to
After sleeping normally for two nights in a row, she felt refreshed and light. Her mum would be proud. It seemed things were looking up. But there was still the problem with Malfoy. He had her prank book now. So she couldn't use it against him any more. Even if she somehow got it back, he probably knew all about the different pranks and also how to reverse them by now. The way it seemed, she couldn't get at him in the real world. So, maybe there was really no other way but to… come at him in his dreams. What other options did she have? She would simply have to try harder.
Then the world went dark. And his face was covered by something heavy and soft. He reached for the cloth that was covering his face and pulled it off him. It was Haley's cloak. Draco wouldn't complain if the earth decided to swallow him up right this moment.
Draco squinted his eyes at her. Why did he spend his precious time with the Ravenclaw again? He looked away in annoyance. He sighed again. He would sigh until the world got better all on its own. Whenever that would be.
For a moment Malfoy didn't say a word. He just looked at her in wonder. Almost like he wasn't understanding what she had been saying. Haley didn't dare blink. She was too anxious for the Slytherin's reaction. And when had her heart started to beat so fast? Maybe it had something to do with the way Malfoy's lips were slightly parted or how his eyes were virtually shining.
Back to the reason I'm here. Mum. I desperately need to see her. I just know that once I see her friendly face everything will be better. I won't feel as if there was an open wound in my chest any more.
He scowled. "So? That doesn't mean you stole it. I'd never let a Gryffindor steal something from me. Maybe I…" He looked away with a sneer. "let you have it."
Haley nodded, reaching for one of the sandwiches and taking a huge bite. She hadn't eaten anything all day and supper had been over by the time they had reached the Great Hall.
"My dad has always been the most cheerful and lively person I knew. He would always laugh and tell the most amazing stories and play with me all day," she continued explaining. "But… when my mum died… it was as if someone had turned off the light. He stopped laughing. Or telling me stories. Some days he even forgot to eat. It was… as if I had lost both of my parents."
The girl removed her glassed and closed her eyes, trying to think about nothing in particular. As she sank into the realms of sleep, her fingers subconsciously brushed across her wrist where the gobstone used to rest. The gobstone that was now lying forgotten inside her drawer.
"No way! You met him? When?" Haley was in full fangirl mode now. She turned it over to inspect the other side. There it was again.
"I wish you could," The girl answered. There was so much she wanted to tell her friend. But she couldn't bring herself to talk about everything that was warring inside her. Friendship was strange. Only a second ago they had been at each others throats and now… all seemed well again. Maybe that was the key. Friendship.
"Really." Haley reached out her hand and helped the other girl up. "With this, there's no way, we'll lose."
The boy crossed his arms and looked to the side. Scowling. Did her presence make him as uncomfortable as it made her? Once more, she wondered what it was that Haley saw in him.
"Perhaps there was more to him," he mused. "Perhaps they got to know each other better and…" He lifted an eyebrow. "She realized… that your father was a decent guy after all."
"If you say so," he drawled, grinning smugly. It was less annoying somehow. His grin. It seemed almost… cheerful. But… no. That wasn't right.
"My mother always said," she continued, "that people who say mean things to others often have a problem with themselves." She looked up at him finally, raising one eyebrow.
For a moment it was so quiet that even Malfoy's frantic breathing seemed too loud although he was standing a few steps away from her. She listened as it got calmer and finally he even relaxed his hands. All this time Malfoy had looked to the ground in concentration. Now he looked up at her and what he did next, was something that Haley would never have imagined to witness.
She snorted. It was sweet how he was trying to cheer her up. But why was he cheering her up in the first place?
"Give me the prophecy, Potter!" Just when Lucius Malfoy made another attempt to get the prophecy, the doors burst open and five figures stormed into the room. Sirius! And Lupin, Tonks, Kingsley and Moody! Maybe there was hope yet. It was so good to see her godfather alive after all the hours she had thought he was in mortal danger.
"Haley, stop dreaming. It's time for lunch." Hermione grabbed her arm and pulled her in the direction of the Great Hall. As far as she knew they didn't have any other classes together with the Slytherins that day. Perhaps she should just let it go and try to focus on her remaining classes. There was still time to observe Malfoy tomorrow.
Before Fred had a chance to reply, Sirius hopped down the stairs, singing "Oh, Christmas Tree" in a surprisingly festive tone. He sauntered past the open door and stuck his head into the room, wishing, "Merry Christmas!" Nobody returned the greeting. That seemed to make Haley's godfather notice the atmosphere inside the room.
"Well… not anymore," he muttered gleefully, storing the book under his arm. He had a feeling the clumsy Gryffindor would miss the book sourly. With a smirk, Draco strutted out of the library. He couldn't help it, being mean was so much fun.
"No… no, no, no, no, no – this isn't me!" She yelled at the mirror, snapping it shut forcefully. The skin on her face was completely green as well. She looked at her reflection again and began rubbing the green skin furiously. It was no use. She spat on the seam of her sleeve and rubbed it over her arm. The skin stayed green.
Haley had the urge to do the exact opposite of her words but it was obvious how much effort it took the other girl to even admit she was worried. To seek her out first. Coming from Hermione, this was almost as good as a heartfelt apology. And Haley was tired of fighting anyway. So, she swallowed down her pride and scooted over to the side.
"If everything goes according to plan? That doesn't sound very convincing! Are you going to let our team down again? I won't let you! I'll – I'll tell everyone what I heard! I'll tell them all about
Snape sighed and gently pushed the little black sugar bowl over to him. "Surely, you remember… what we talked about at the beginning of the year… when I… heard about your… how do I put it… romantic escapades."
"Damn it," he cursed running a hand through his hair, but he couldn't even do that because of the helmet! Growing more frustrated by the moment, Draco tried to pull the helmet off his head.
"Thank you, Draco," she said quietly, beaming at him. Her face was an expression of giddiness and joy. His heart fluttered softly. Did she feel like that because of him? He cleared his throat.
With a last amused chuckle Hermione's face vanished once more and Haley heard her lying down in her own bed.
"I wasn't toying around with her." He lifted his chin defiantly. What did it matter now? He couldn't deny it anyway. He might as well get the story straight. Perhaps he could erase his memory later. How did that spell go again? "I
"I don't know…" Luna shrugged, glancing out at the moon. "I don't think I'm the right person to judge that."
Hello everyone! Thank you a lot for reading and commenting and leaving me kudos :) (Btw am I the only one who always thinks of 'Shinichi Kudo' when I read the word kudos'?) I had no idea how students get back to Hogwarts after winter break. Is it by train? Well, that's what I went with anyway. If you're following my other fics you probably know this already but I'll write it again here. I'm starting my thesis fairly soon so I don't know how often I get to update. I'll try not to make you wait too long and I would love to hear your thoughts! Also feel free to share ideas for dreams that would be fun.
"Oh." Angelina replied, as if Haley's reaction surprised her. "So, you remembered that we have quidditch practice every Tuesday?"
"We're not going to – I mean – why must you be such a – ugh!" Haley sputtered, feeling her face heat up.
." The boy spat disdainfully. How had the professor even got the idea that there was something between him and Potter? The girl hadn't told him, had she? Or worse, he hadn't forced her to tell him by torturing her or something like this? He couldn't think straight. All he knew was he had to protect his secret. He had to protect
The stupid broom didn't fit under her invisibility cloak. What was Malfoy planning anyway? Did he want to play quidditch? At night? As she stumbled through the dimly lit common room she thought that it was a good thing everyone had already gone to bed.
"What… what you said earlier," she started. "I have to know. Is it… really true?" She had to ask again, although she knew they would never joke about something so serious. "Is Sirius still alive?"
"Well I haven't!" Haley groaned, pulling her hand free. "I mean, didn't you find it strange that they were following me, if they were supposed to know about us?" she hissed in exasperation.
" he said mockingly. "has shared an idea or two with me. Of course," he added. "I would first need to know… what you can offer in return."
Draco sighed dramatically. "I'll make you another one then. An ugly one. So you can actually get a taste of my masterpiece." How was he that sweet, damn it!
This admission was the most painful. But she still wasn't done telling him how she felt, so she took a deep breath and added, "So, what I'm saying is I hope… I really hope you can give me another chance."
"He's even later than us." Hermione remarked. "Probably a new way to sabotage Hagrid." She followed him with her eyes. "Now, that I think about it… he's been unusually quiet lately, hasn't he? Not that I'm complaining."
She watched him absently sink his fingers into the grass, as she thought about his words another time. It kind of made sense. But…
"Strange, it says so all over the notice in our common room," she replied, grinning mockingly. She saw right through him. As always.
"Hoping that… I hadn't been wrong about you. That-" She stopped herself. While she'd been talking Malfoy had slowly raised his head until he was finally meeting her eyes. There it was again. Hope. What was it he was hoping for? Regardless of the answer it was that urgency that made her heart stop. That made her throw caution to the wind and tell him exactly what had been on her mind. What she had been afraid to say in case all of this was nothing more than a joke. It was now or never.
Just as she was done and turned to the owls in order to search for her trusted feathery friend, she realised something else. She couldn't use Hedwig. Not with Umbrigde snooping around. Why hadn't she thought of that sooner? Now she had to go all the way back to her common room and hope that George was there. So she could ask him to relay her message. And if he wasn't? Well, then she would have to take a long look at the Marauder's Map.
Haley blinked. Her heart had just skipped a beat! Why did he have to say these kinds of things? And why did he have to say them in such a way that almost seemed like he was
"But Haley," Hermione placed her arms on the table, staring at her friend even more intensely. "Do you even have an idea what you're doing? You might be seriously harming him!" She whispered this, so no one at the table besides them was able to overhear.
I reach down to pat Simon's bronze locks, when I notice that the boy's hair is blond. It's Draco. Simon's gone.
I position the fingers of my left hand on the strings and play the notes of the chorus. It's the part where it goes
"I mean it," she added quietly. "There are so many undiscovered creatures out there. Just waiting to be found." Her voice had become an excited whisper. "I want to see all of them!"
"How brave of you." He drawled mockingly. "Sending your golden knight away to face the big bad Slytherin all alone."
As she made her way over to them she noticed that they were the only people left in the common room.
." Hermione said arrogantly. Luna narrowed her eyes, opening her mouth to protest. Ron was quicker though.
"Still, that doesn't give you the right to tamper with his memories!" Hermione seemed to be in full morality mode. It really was a good thing she hadn't told her what she had
There was another noise behind her then and she could swear that there was someone watching her. Furiously she turned around again. But the corridor was empty.
He's right of course. But until now I thought nobody had noticed… I sigh. "To be honest, I've never really felt like a true Gryffindor." I pull my legs up and wrap my arms around my knees. I've never told anyone about this. Why am I telling Malfoy? "I'm not especially brave or heroic or actively looking for adventures that might grant me eternal glory. I'm just a normal girl," I whisper the last part, burying my face in my arms.
Then, as if she was about to do something as unpleasant as collecting bubotuber pus, Hermione gave a deep sigh before looking into her eyes. "I'm worried about you, too." She admitted grudgingly. "And I'd appreciate it if you stopped snapping at me all the time."
While Malfoy sputters, "I – you weren't supposed – It's not – I didn't want–" I take in the picture in front of me.
Before dinner Haley went up to the room she shared with Ginny and Hermione and jotted down a few lines on a piece of paper. She folded it up, scribbled the name
Draco wasn't completely heartless. If she was only there to quietly do her homework he had no reason to chase her away. Right? They would be even then. She had helped him that night, when he'd been stuck in the knight's helmet and now he would simply return the favour.
Haley shook her head, slowly. Seemingly taken aback at the sudden proximity. Draco noticed her licking her lips and it took all of his self-control not to grab her face and press his own against them. He leaned backwards, creating a safe distance between them again. He had a point to make here. He couldn't let himself get distracted. There was a flicker of surprise flashing across the girl's face. Or perhaps it was disappointment. Draco told himself it was disappointment. Back to the point, Draco!
"Um… what I meant to say is… I didn't want to just watch uselessly anymore. And I was certainly not going to sit around while you went on a date with that dull Hufflepuff."
When she stepped through the portrait hole after tickling the painted pear, Haley had all the nerve to turn around again and skip supper after all.
"What's that?" He asked all of a sudden, holding up a tiny doll, made out of clay. It had a blank face and was no bigger than her hand.
She cleared her throat and turned around, a fiery blush dusting her cheeks. She had no right to look this cute.
"Well, what have you been painting, then?" I ask walking over to his side. The moment he realizes what I'm intending to do, he plasters himself against the wall.
"And?" Hedwig presses, gripping my arm and searching my face. I can't really escape her eyes since she's shorter than me.
"It's not about knowing." Mum shakes her head, a secretive smile on her lips. "Try feeling for once." She smooths down my braid and kisses the top of my head gently.
"STOP!" I shout because I can't watch any more of this. My scream is accompanied by loud thunder. Did I cause that? Malfoy and my own face look at me in surprise. Looks like they've finally noticed me.
Picking up her Magnificent Marauder's Map just in case, she tip-toed out of the dorm. She didn't really have a goal in mind. Somehow, it felt like she was sleep walking. Her mind was foggy and unfocused. Maybe she was still dreaming.
Had it really been worth it? What if it hadn't been Sirius in her dreams? What if it was all just wishful thinking?
Everything looks brighter in the light of day. Haley assumed that was something Mrs Weasley would say. Funnily enough she found that it was true. Everything might not be magically okay but it didn't look as scary anymore. Of course life at 12 Grimmauld Place wasn't exactly rainbows and sunshine to begin with but it was better than being cut off from the magical world completely.
"Amazing," I breathe, looking at my reflection from all sides. If this isn't going to intimidate Malfoy, I don't know what else will.
Haley heard the disappointment in her voice. She hated disappointing her. Hermione let go of her hands and turned to draw open the curtains, surrounding Haley's bed. Before she could draw them open completely Haley reflexively reached out a hand to stop her. It hadn't even been a conscious action.
"Yeah," Ron confirmed, following the girl without glancing back. Haley wondered if he was that eager because he was hungry or because he was still mad at her.
It's here! The end of the pining is near. Which means there's space for fluff now. But don't get too excited Haley still needs to decide who she's going to go to Hogsmeade with!
" Maybe I tell him because it's a dream and there's a high chance he won't remember this anyway. "I mean, Ravenclaw would have been okay, I guess. But as soon as the Hat suggested Slytherin, I panicked. I mentally screamed at the Hat to put me anywhere but Slytherin. And just like that I ended up in Gryffindor." It feels good to be able to finally talk about this. Even if Malfoy is the one listening.
"I'll think about it," she said, and hadn't she said those exact words not too long ago? To someone else?
, Haley thought. It was a good thing, she was able to recognise Malfoy's writing by now. She had meant to tell him that she had Quidditch training on Wednesday but she hadn't been able to think of a way that was discreet enough. After Angelina had cancelled their training she had thought for a short moment that she would be able to make it after all. But looking at the way Hermione was reasoning there really was nothing she could do or say.
"All this time I thought…" She whispered quietly. "Everyone always said they were g-good people. But my dad, he – my dad–" She stopped, hesitating to say what was at the front of her mind. "How could he be so
"Right! I should-" then she remembered about their meeting tonight, "Oh, I almost forgot. We're having our first meeting tonight!"
“I –” Haley started angrily. But then she realized something. She stopped, looking at her friend suspiciously. “What did you just say? Returning his feelings?” She narrowed her eyes at him. He made it sound as if Malfoy’s crush had been public knowledge. “Did you know he had feelings for me?”
"How so?" No matter how hard she tried, she simply couldn't see them work out. "It doesn't make sense."
"Hey – you can't just – wait!" Pansy screeched, following him uninvitedly. "What are you planning? I can help."
Before she could ponder the thought any more, she grabbed a pillow and threw it at the general direction of the door. "For Merlin's sake, knock, Simon! I'm pretty sure I taught you how to do that!"
"No, stay," she said, taking hold of his arm. Suddenly, she needed to know. "You're… You're not going to tell anyone, right?"
Hermione nodded. Malfoy had been a git as always and following that… Haley had been obsessed with finding out why he was suddenly ignoring her.
"So…there's a Hogsmeade trip coming up next weekend. I thought you might like – I mean -" He stopped when he saw the unimpressed expression on her face.
"We still can." Haley breathed, feeling slightly lightheaded. A few sweet words and she already felt like jelly. She wondered if she had a similar effect on him.
"I–" She was starting to get frustrated. "Well, you're not the most trustworthy person either." She hissed, reaching into her pocket and fetching the gobstone.
"That went well, don't you think?" Hermione asked, as she stored her list inside her bag, "It's still fairly early. Shall we go to The Three Broomsticks?"
She turned around and made her way back toward the observation deck. Malfoy was already waiting for her. There was a frown on his face and his arms were crossed in front of his chest.
"About what?" Draco asked, before mentally slapping himself. Damn it, he had acknowledged her. Now she probably thought he
The door closes behind me and I'm inside a room I have seen once before. The room is big and a giant bed is located in the middle. There are two huge windows on the adjoining wall. And lots of Weird Sisters posters on the wall opposite from it. It must be Draco's bedroom at home.
"Up here," the voice says and I try not to snort, as I realise that Myron Wagtail, the lead singer of the
What did you think of the chapter? I know, I'm evil because I'm keeping our two main characters apart for so long... But it'll be all the better once they actually get their acts together!
"Come on, guys," she called out to her friends, turning around and momentarily walking on backwards. They really were slow today. "If we're fast, we can eat outside-" That's when she tripped.
For some unfathomable reason Potter was holding onto Connors arm. Draco frowned. He wanted to pull her hand away. Then she almost shouted something at the Ravenclaw that sounded like a sentence jumbled into one word:
I nod in answer, but she still doesn't let go of my arm. "If you touch that you'll get an electric shock."
"You know… hypothetically speaking," she whispered, "if somebody asked you on a date… what would you do?"
Then I remember parts of my conversation with mum earlier that night. Something about visiting each other…
He gulped, taking a deep breath to try and calm his pounding heart. What was he doing? Perhaps he should just keep his mouth shout. Perhaps it was better to wait. But what was he waiting for?
deserve to be called either friendly or fun and you see, there are only few instances in which I would mistake a
Haley frowned. Hadn't Draco said something similar? A flash of guilt filled her at the reminder of the boy. She should have kept quiet. Knowing Hermione, it wouldn't take long until she counted two and two together.
Haley yawned. Her eyes were drooping again. Now that all the excitement was somewhat over, her body had decided to remind her, that she was incredibly tired.
"But… I've never really played… not a real game… I – what if I mess up?" Emily asked in a small voice.
"Even now… you're still defending him. Although, he was trying to take away your magic." It didn't make sense. Why was he behaving like that?
He stared at her, dead in the eye. "I don't know. Maybe." Then he shook his head violently, pain distorting his features once more. "No. I wouldn't wish this hell on anyone!" With an angry sob he threw his coffee cup against the wall closest to him.
"Why are you in such a hurry?" The Slytherin questioned confusedly, "We don't have to be back for another two hours."
"Yes… That." She coughed awkwardly. "I still think it's wrong to play with somebody's feelings," she continued almost challengingly. "But I could have said it differently."
Honestly, she felt a bit bad about letting Malfoy suffer in the cold. And then also telling him she had done it intentionally. Maybe she had crossed a line there. There was a frown around his mouth as he looked up into the sky. But what could she say to make it disappear? Did she even want it to disappear? Before she could try to come up with an answer to either of these questions her hand had reached out toward him almost on its own accord. The boy seemed slightly startled by her touch but even so, he didn't hesitate to turn his hand over and take hold of her own. His eagerness made Haley chuckle softly. It was kind of cute how he seemed to refuse to look at her.
Then she glanced out of the window, curious as to what had stolen his attention. Quidditch. There were a couple of students out on the pitch, flying freely in the evening air.
"Fine," Haley spat, getting up from the table, "I might as well start packing then. In case I don't survive the rest of the term, don't blame
Draco glanced over toward the used cups with a scoff. Perhaps he regretted drinking all that coffee now. Then he shook his head. "Even if that was true… what does it matter now? Nothing matters any more." He narrowed his eyes at the gobstone and the dark leather band it was attached to in Haley's hand as if it had personally offended him. "It doesn't change a thing. It doesn't give me back my magic or–" He broke off, his voice catching on the word
Lily rolled her eyes. "Simon, if you can't behave like the mature boy, I know you're hiding somewhere under that tough demeanour, I'll have to send you to your room. Do you think you can handle it?"
"I'd like to see you try to stop me," the Slytherin drawled with an arrogant sneer that Haley hadn't seen in a long time. She sighed. Was that really necessary? The blond winked at her, before letting go of her hand and strutting past Ron.
Luna shook her head. "He's my friend, yes." She replied softly. "But you're my friend, too, Haley. I wanted to comfort you."
"Haley – are you sure there isn't another reason you're in such a good mood?" Asked Hermione in a careful voice.
She might have as well sent a howler. It felt as if he was being yelled at. Sirius chuckled. Ah, she definitely got her temper from her mother. He sighed. Teenagers really were a handful. Was she actually serious? She would never speak a word with him again? She couldn't mean it, right? But what if she did? He grimaced. Writing these letters had been such a fun pastime. Did he really have to go back to his boring routine of slinking through the halls and riling up that miserable house elf? He turned the paper around in case he might find a solution there. Maybe it was all just a prank after all. Maybe she –
"Sorry, I totally forgot the time while–" Haley broke off, realising who else was sitting at her friend's table. Luna Lovegood and… Rita Skeeter?
"Now I only need to figure out what to do about Ron." Haley muttered seemingly to herself. Right. There was still Ron. Hot-headed, impulsive, irrational Ron. But he was a loyal friend. And fiercely protective. Hermione had always liked that about him.
"You forget that I have known you since you were a tiny fledgling. I can tell when something bothers you."
. He remembered a different girl with green eyes. Her face was framed by long red hair and she was smiling. Always smiling. Until she wasn't any more. How ironic. Of all the people, he might be the one person who understood best that it was only too easy to be enthralled by these lovely emerald eyes. He witnessed something bloom on the boy's face like the first flowers opening their petals in spring. Had he realised the truth behind his words only now?
Haley snorted. Then she scooted closer, propping up on her elbow. With her cheek resting on her palm she watched him silently.
Hello angst my old friend, it's you again... Right. I'm not sure if this chapter or the previous one is more angsty... well. There's a bit of fluff in here as well. And some humour :) Anyway, sorry for taking so long to update. It's like I've got no time to write at all :/ (master theses and everything...) Well, let me know your thoughts :)
She had to tell him. She had to tell her boyfriend that she had just publicly named his father as a Death Eater.
He didn't believe her. All the worrying and her own godfather thought her biggest secret was no more than a silly joke?
Mrs Weasley taking one glance at her and promptly warming up some soup for her made her feel warm and welcome. Hermione was visiting as well. But since her and the other Weasley children were still asleep – Haley had arrived shortly after midnight – she was going to see them all the following day. After the meal, Mrs Weasley lead her up to the room she was going to share with Hermione. It was the old room of the twins that they didn't need at the moment.
"You sound like Percy," she chuckled, "And what are you going to say, when we come across a teacher? Will you tell them that you were just escorting me back to Gryffindor Tower?"
They'd never hugged before. Not like this. Not when it didn't involve kissing. Somehow it seemed more intimate. Meaningful. Like something that belonged into a dream…
"If you're going to hate me, fine! Do it! But I can't deal with this any longer! This – this – I don't even know – whatever the hell this is!" Malfoy was just sitting there, quietly taking in her words. Why wasn't he saying anything? Why wasn't he defending himself? Why was he just sitting there?
"Malfoy did it," Haley realised. Really, it was so obvious. "He was here, I think, before I fell asleep. I thought it was a dream first but… He must have hexed me then."
"I did notice actually. I also noticed something else. Usually, people don't seem too fond of the idea of having their secrets exposed. Am I wrong?" The way his expression hardened was incredibly satisfying.
"It is, a bit," she replied, leaning back in the seat, next to his bed. He glared at her. Then he yawned. It totally destroyed the effect. Haley kept grinning.
"No, he isn't," he protested with a frown. "And why would you think my favourite singer was the password?"
The difference was that in a dream she could tell Draco whatever she wanted because it wouldn’t make a difference in the end. He wouldn’t remember. And even if he did, he wouldn’t consider the information important. There would be no consequences. In reality every action had consequences. Everything was a thousand times more complicated than in the dream world. Telling him would mean letting him in. Opening herself up and allowing him to see her weaknesses. She would give him the chance to hurt her.
"I still think we should tell Professor McGonnagall about your dad's book. She could make sure Malfoy has to give it back to you." Hermione advised, while spreading pumpkin jam across her slice of toast.
"Um… you should try one," the girl suggested, picking up one of the biscuits, that was shaped like a cat with a painted on smiley face and whiskers, and breaking it into two halves. "See, they're not poisoned," she said with a nervous undertone, as she bit into one half of the biscuit, offering him the other.
But then… if anything happened to her… if she was hurt, tortured or worse… and he did nothing to stop it…
The boy pulled back after another moment, before ducking down to steal a kiss, as if he had been dying to for at least a week.
He's right. The tree house is right there only a few more rungs away. How curious. I reach for the last plank, and pull myself up, onto the wooden deck that slightly juts out at the end of the ladder.
Hesitantly, Haley looked up once more, looking for answers or signs of lies in his eyes. But he wasn't giving anything away.
was. After one pointed glance at Snape's hand, the professor let go of the Gryffindor and told her to return to her dormitory. When the girl made for the door, Draco wanted to follow her but it seemed like Snape had different plans. Potter had seemed shaken up about something. What had Snape done to her?
Right. Maybe I should take off my glasses. I take them off and store them inside the pocket of my Slytherin robes.
"What is it?" She asked curiously. Then her gaze fell on the other bowl of ice cream. It had a pink tinge and was sprinkled with little strawberry pieces. Oh. She got it now.
His face was so close now. And he was leaning even farther into her personal space. Surely he wouldn't–? He wasn't going to–? Haley saw Malfoy's gaze flicker to her lips briefly.
"Er… Haley?" Well, hugging wasn't exactly the boy's speciality. He seemed unsure what to do with his arms. Haley chuckled and hugged him tighter.
hadn't she given it to him sooner? He squinted his eyes at her, suddenly suspicious. "So, you knew I was cold the whole time and you happily watched me suffer?"
Upsetting. That was quite the understatement. "They… they can't just… do that… can they?" What if the dementors hurt him? What if they drove his father mad?
"That curious, are we?" He asked smugly. Haley rolled her eyes in annoyance. Couldn't he simply get on with it?
“What?” I sigh in annoyance. “Am I going to die tomorrow?” I’ve already been through this with Trelawney.
Ron shook his head, like he was trying to get rid of a thought. "Anyway. How was your trip to Sweden? Did you manage to catch your Snorkack?" He asked curiously. He only sounded a little bit mocking.
"I think it's more than that though," Hermione persisted, "you seem… restless. Like you're expecting something to… I don't know – attack you?"
"There you guys are!" A voice interrupted her, followed by a freckled face that squeezed in between the two girls. "Hagrid sent me to look for you. Says the forest is dangerous. And he's right! I mean, why would you voluntarily stroll around here alone?" Ron looked from Haley to Hermione questioningly. Neither girl answered.
Draco couldn't help but snort because of her choice of words. Well, she was right. He wasn't that kind of person. He rarely did anything without knowing where he would end up or what he could gain from a situation. Usually he avoided uncomfortable or dangerous situations before he even got involved in them. This wasn't him at all. So, why was he treading on such an uncertain path when he had no idea where it would lead him in the end?
There was a folded up note next to one of her books. Her heart began to beat faster in anticipation. Was it from him? She looked around the hall but no one was taking much notice of her. The only person who was sending her a worried glance was Hermione, who'd just stepped into the hall. Had she seen the exchange? It didn't matter. She'd explain later. Now, she needed to know what the note said. She almost ripped it up out of anticipation.
"Haley, is that you?" My mum's voice asks, while the steam clouds are starting to drift away. I can see her now. And the figure beside her is… Professor Snape?
The following day he found himself looking through the year books in the library. He really needed to spend less time in that place.
The boy pouted. Lovegood took one of his gloves – or more correctly mittens – and inspected it closely.
How beautiful he thought she was. How much he liked seeing her smile. Or how the sound of her laughter made him want to sing. Although he didn't remember the last time he had sung. Or the seemingly simplest of them all: That he cared about her far too much and that this fact frightened him more than anything else. Maybe she would understand without him having to actually say it out loud. Maybe she would hear the words in his kiss.
"So you're saying," Draco urged in frustration. Why couldn't she speak in certain terms? He had to fight the urge to shake her until the answer tumbled out of her.
Instead of replying, Haley reached into her robes and pulled out her necklace. The one with the fairy charm. The one he had given to her.
And before he had time to wonder why her smile seemed the smallest bit sad, Haley had wrapped her arms around him and kissed him. And since he was more than just a little bit crazy about her, too, the taste of her lips made him forget anything that didn't involve kissing her back.
They continued along the path leading them toward a low wooden fence, that had a sign saying "Editor of the Quibbler" nailed to it. It looked like they had found the right house. Just as Ron was opening the gate, a girl with long blonde hair came bouncing toward them from behind the house.
Hermione, sitting on the edge of Haley's bed, crossed her arms and clucked her tongue disapprovingly. "Right. We all know how much you're drawn to
Without giving him a chance to kiss her hand a second time, she pulled it away from his grasp, ignoring the disappointment on his face. She looked away.
Hastily, she stuffed it into the shoulder bag she had brought, all the while feeling Malfoy's eyes following her movements. He was clearly curious about it. But for some reason he was hesitant to ask. She wondered how much she should tell him.
a saint. Although I still don't agree with that." She shook her head, a stubborn line, scrunching up her eyebrows. "I just don't get – my mum…" She paused, narrowing her eyes. "She obviously didn't like him.
Haley sighed. How could someone be this careless with their wand? She drew her own and pointed it at the castle. "
"The present. All of it. You hate it, don't you? I knew it was silly," she mumbled, trying not to let it affect her too much.
The boy grimaced. Her behaviour bothered him less than it should have. "Why do I even bother talking to you?"
"You are not taking this seriously enough! If I have to see another one of those dreadful memories, I will send you straight to the headmaster!"
The spell was lifted and Haley dropped to her bed. She crawled to her feet and lunged at Draco, poking one finger into his chest. "You think this is funny? You absolute
"Have you spotted any glumbumbles yet?" Neville asked, as they were traipsing along the pumpkin field.
"Back in fifth year," Lily started her story. She reached out toward Haley's hair and parted it into three equal sections.
"Right..." Draco stated. He was quickly learning that it was safer not to ask. He bit his lip, considering whether he should...
That night she dreamed again. But something was different. There she saw Sirius inside his hourglass prison, fighting to get out. But somehow his presence seemed weaker. Like his strength was waning. Like his time was slowly but surely… running out.
"All of my concerts?" He seemed to like the sound of that. Then his brows furrowed. "Even if I can't make any spells work? Even if people call me a… squib? You'll still stay by my side?" His voice dripped with bitterness.
Draco thought feeling his face harden in annoyance. He really wasn't keen on finding out what the second point was about, but the smug grin on Potter's face told him he wouldn't like it any more than the
They didn't have any classes with the Slytherins that day, so Haley soon forgot about one of her worries. Until dinner rolled around, and she spotted Malfoy in the Entrance Hall again. This time he was alone. She tried to ignore him, expecting him to do the same just like he had earlier that day.
On the way down to the dungeons, she whispered the most important details into his ear. "So, the thing is… we've been trying to get Draco's magic back and so far it hasn't worked. But over breakfast we had the idea that maybe you… maybe you can help him."
But no. She couldn't think like that. She needed to keep up the wall that kept everyone out. Numbness was the path she'd chosen…
"A friend," she said with a gentle smile. "A special one." She sprinkled some white chocolate flakes all over her piece of art and carefully carried it over to the end of the table where a chocolate rose, a gingerbread man and a dragon where already waiting.
"Do you think sleeping will make you pretty?" Asked a voice quietly. "You know, beauty sleep doesn't work for anyone."
Neville knelt down in front of the tree and unscrewed the lid from the jar. He didn't look at her. He seemed completely focused on the task of placing the jar down between the tufts of grass and attracting the little insect.
"Fine!" He called irritatedly. "Go! Break all of your promises! You're nothing but a liar! See what I care!"
"It's not like we're in a war." Haley rolled her eyes. "Do people actually still care about this whole bloodline rubbish?" She clucked her tongue. "They don't mind as long as I'm happy, I guess."
"Why not?" Potter questioned again, "I'd convince him. I know I could." Her eyes, steely with determination were a stark contrast to the fact that she had practically said she didn't trust him only minutes before. This was ridiculous.
"Shit." Simon cursed. Then he hurried out of his room with the face of someone who was about to die. Baz got up to follow him, amusement written all over his face.
Haley didn't know. It was a sobering realisation. "I'll go right up to take a nap. Would you tell McGonnagall that I'm not feeling well?" There was a flash of blond hair, slipping out of the hall. She got up quickly.
Haley grinned. "All righty, then. Let's go!" Impulsively, she grabbed his hand and pulled him in the direction of the tree house.
it? Where – there, it was. With trembling fingers she snapped open the mirror and held it up in front of her face… with her eyes closed. Ever so slowly she opened one eye and then the second.
The Slytherin snorted. "How very funny, Potter," he scoffed, "I know how rare these are. I bet, you got it from Dumbledore or… perhaps you stole it." He raised an eyebrow at her, silently challenging her to deny it.
A pale hand pushed a cup of coffee in front of her. She gulped it down, glad that it wasn't hot any more.
Potter's voice in his head. Clear like a memory. But it wasn't a memory. It was an echo of the way she was thinking. Planted into his mind. Where it had no right to be and put foreign thoughts into his head. Why should he listen to it? Why should he even bother–
Haley felt her insides squeeze together uncomfortably. She didn't know what to do. What to say. She wanted to apologize, to explain. But the words seemed like they were stuck in her throat, unable to move past her lips. Draco didn't say anything either. Which made her feel even more anxious. They both seemed to be waiting for something without knowing what it was. But nothing happened. Even the bright red plant on the table in front of them seemed to wait, its violet petals spread out invitingly, distracting from the hole in its middle that was filled with a sirupy liquid meant to attract its prey.
Friendly fun. Of course. During one dream they actually went to that concert she had missed out on. Weird Sisters concert. Of course. Malfoy had caught the sweaty shirt of Myron Wagtail, which the lead singer had thrown into the crowd. He had clutched it to his chest so tightly that Haley hadn't even tried to persuade him to give it to her.
"Flashes of it," he answered curtly, raising his wand. "Well, it wasn't too bad for your first attempt. You managed to stop me eventually, though you wasted time and energy waving your arms around. You must remain focused. Repel me with your brain and you will not need to resort to your wand."
"You're right! What a tragedy that would be!" She remarked sarcastically. It was so easy to make fun of him in this playful way. It seemed almost natural. Effortless. And she liked it much better than the hurtful insults and jabs that had been their form of communication before. Malfoy on the other hand didn't seem to share her amusement if the dark look he was shooting her was any indication. It hadn't been too much, had it?
Haley smiled politely, while elbowing Simon and whispering, "Lower your voice, next time, will you?" Louder she asked, "Did you forget something, professor?"
She couldn't help it. Seeing Malfoy always awakened the – very mature – urge in her to mess with him. Which was why she had carefully stepped in his footprints in the snow so he wouldn't see that she was coming. Well, it had been funnier in her imagination. Now, they were back in Hogsmeade and an annoyed scowl darkened the Slytherin's face. Haley slid off her Invisibility Cloak.
Then why had she told him? Perhaps she had wanted to let him in for once. Only to see what it might be like. And even if it was just for a day.
How long will I have to wait? It's hard to tell time when you're asleep. It feels like ten minutes have passed, so I decide to check if mum is still outside.
I barely stifle a laugh. To be honest, I actually like the Weird Sisters but this guy is seriously bonkers! He somewhat reminds me of that portrait of Sir Cadogan.
, she'd convinced herself. But maybe it had been more. Maybe he'd been telling her something entirely different all along. Even Snape had seen it right away. That was why he had sent her away…
"All right, it may have also tried to put me in Slytherin for half a second but… who cares about details?"
"I sneaked it from Snape," Draco explained patiently, taking a seat. "It's the most scandalous one I could find. It just screams
The cat hissed at her, baring its fangs. Was that Cat for 'You're right. I'm sorry'? She doubted it. She had thought extra lessons with Snape would be something to worry about. Now, the Gryffindor had a much bigger problem.
"Lily Evans." Nothing changed in his face when he said the name. But there was a slight lilt to his voice that usually wasn't there.
Malfoy pulls away. Does he sense that I am on the verge of a mental breakdown? His eyes still hold that soft expression as they wander across my face. I open my mouth in an attempt to tell him to stop, to leave me alone but I can't find my voice. This is so frustrating. The little smile on his face irritates me. There is no reason to smile! I want to tell him that, too. I want to tell him to get his bloody hands off me and –
"Er… that's mine," the kid said, quickly pushing the snitch back into her pocket. Huh? Wasn't that the Creevey girl? Her reflexes weren't bad.
"That's funny. Clearly you're the one who's lying," he insinuated, as he reached her hand and covered it with his own. She noticed that it wasn't as cold as it had been before. It was probably due to the 'tea accident'.
Then something in the hall seemed to alarm him. "Someone's coming. Hide!" He hissed, quickly closing the door behind him and storming into the room. For a split second he stood in the middle of the room, desperately looking for a hiding place, before realizing that there was none.
"Actually, I think this is mine." Severus argued, thinking that it probably had fallen out of his pocket earlier when he had drawn his wand.
What was he saying? And why? Surely it was too cruel to taunt Potter after what she had just gone through? But what else was Draco supposed to do? He couldn't openly say something nice or comforting. Even if he wanted to.
Hermione frowned, pointedly glancing at Haley's plate where two slices of toast were sitting. Untouched.
"She's the reason you're helping me, isn't it?" Draco interrupted him. "She's the reason you haven't told anyone about Haley and me. She was Haley's mother."
Except for… the notes. There were all kinds of notes on almost every single page. Thoughts on how to brew the potions. Ideas how to improve them. But she didn't see any spells…
