Harry definitely wasn’t sorting out whatever potion he had been brewing, but Draco wasn’t going to pry. The other boy had been spending the vast majority of the past month doing piles upon piles of paperwork for Gringotts, something about needing to circumvent his magical guardian for ease of movement. Harry hadn’t been very keen on sharing more than that, and Draco had already gotten a good idea of just what he was doing, so he had left it be. Besides, Harry seemed to want Draco to focus on ‘sorting through his emotions’, whatever that was supposed to mean, instead of bothering with the legality surrounding his new… familial issue, so he had left it be and focused on… well, he didn’t really know what to focus on. He certainly hadn’t been focusing on his emotions though, that much felt obvious.
Perenelle stepped forward again, looking seconds away from pulling him down into another warm hug, before heavy footfalls made the three of them turn towards the narrow stairwell. Draco clambered down into their line of sight, his trunks in hand as he muttered obscenities under his breath. Harry smiled lightly, the worries of the past several months easing away as the shorter boy sided up besides him with a tired grin.
It wasn’t until they were halfway to the great hall that her curiosity seemed to have gotten the better of her, and only as Harry started to turn down the wrong hall, the trunk still suspiciously in one hand.
Harry stood there silently for a moment, watching as his soulmate disappeared into the fire, before he glanced back over his shoulder.
After all, you can't exactly get caught up in something if you aren’t around it when it happens.
Very suddenly, there was a sudden, near-invisible shift in Harry Potter. Barty stumbled again, reaching out to the side to grasp Perenelle’s hand as Harry Potter smiled, just barely. Barty watched, with horror and awe and glee, as those vibrant green eyes were suddenly overtaken by red.
“That had been my belief as well. Now though… ah, I suppose you must be finding your seats. It was wonderful talking to you, Harry.” Replied Krum, who gave Harry one last handshake before falling away into the crowd again, gone for the time being. Draco rolled his eyes at the man’s retreating back, before pulling Harry along towards a different path, causing the taller, clumsier boy to stumble slightly as his long legs got locked around each other.
“Harry Potter! Happy birthday!” She shouted, sprinting around her sister and Perenelle to quickly come to his side, jumping with glee as he smiled.
Harry doesn't dream anymore.
Harry took a sharp breath inwards, slowly exhaling through grit teeth. It was
If Draco didn’t want to go to Beauxbatons, then Durmstrang would be the next place to turn for help and shelter from the danger of a second wizarding war.
It had been ages since he had used the little trunk apartment—a little over a year, he figured. And even then, he had only used it to hold that strange crystal skull that the old woman had given him the previous summer. Not that the strange object had been much use to him in the end, considering that it had broken into pieces at some point during the school year. He didn’t know how it had happened exactly, but when he had gone back down into the apartment the week prior, he had found the remnants of the skull lying there on the étagère. The thing had been mostly useless to him beyond being an odd sort of decoration, so it hardly mattered to him how or when it had shattered.
Draco’s sudden voice made him jolt up from his slump, blearily blinking the half-asleep daze out of his eyes as he looked back to the shorter boy’s face. Draco’s expression was practically glacial, his hands working diligently to set the letter aside and pick up a paper and quill.
A chair scraping made him glance up from his palms, and again did his gaze draw towards the ice and storm that was held in the eyes of the diadem horcrux. The man smiled at him in understanding as he settled back into his seat, having shifted slightly forward to pick up a biscuit from the table. “I hope you understand, Tom, why I was so cautious to submit to your consciousnesses authority.”
“I… who are you?” He questioned instead, finding difficulty in keeping his attention on one thing at a time. The shop around them was utterly jam-packed with everything he could think of, from chairs to knives to strange, glowing orbs to what looked like a dog collar with spikes going around the inside of it. It was all just far too much all at once.
“Are you in there, Tommy? I know you aaarreeeee~! Tom is being so mean, locking you away, won’t you let Marvolo fix that for you? Hmmmmmm~? He’ll help you out of there, I’m sure of it! And then we can be brothers for real! Brothers brothers a-hahahaaa~!”
sentient either.
“It just doesn’t make any
He sighed, closing his eyes with frustration as indignation made itself home in his mind. That was the worst thing Tom could have possibly said. “I am when those ‘personal happenings’ are affecting me.”
“I thought you-oh you little, I thought you were-!”
but you disobey me to my face? I would have thought you befriending the Malfoy heir would fix that rotten mouth of yours, but perhaps any positive influences he had were overshadowed by that girl’s efforts to ruin you. I never should have agreed to this-this
He dodged her arm as she reached out to whack him, moving swiftly along as her affronted gasp met his ears. He laughed, feeling the last of his concern wash away as she reached up and, standing on the tips of her toes, pinched his cheek tightly, muttering something indistinct in what sounded like Russian, or maybe it was just nonsense. She did seem to enjoy speaking nonsense on occasion.
They both stood still for several moments, Harry with his hands splayed across the table and his shoulders hunched, mind working into overdrive to try and figure out a solution to what he had been told. Nicolas merely stared off into the middle distance, thinking of memories that had long since faded from the minds of society.
“Well,” he began, hand coming up to the highest rung of the ladder he could reach. “I suppose we’ll have to open up the position.”
Grunting, he got a hand onto one of his bookshelves, following it towards the west wall where the booming noise had originated. He felt his eyelids strain at the ferocity that he had them shut, the pounding in his skull overtaking any need for sight that he had felt privy to in the minutes prior. It wasn’t nearly long enough until he ran out of bookshelf to hold onto, and found himself stuck between forcing his eyes open or standing there and waiting for the pain to pass. Begrudgingly, he used the shelf to steady himself and slowly lowered to the floor, returning his now free hand to his ear and clutching both through pained grunts.
“Non-magical human blood.”
skinny person. It was extremely odd to see him so… filled out.
Turning a corner, Nicolas stopped dead at the sight of horrendously colored robes, the gaudiness of which feeling particularly familiar in a particularly unpleasant way. They were a bright purple in hue, with a vaguely maroon-like coloring as trim. He grimaced, considering if he should just turn tail and run.
“Let me out right this
“Well, that should hold for a month or two. Maybe even longer if he stops trying to break through.” The both seemed to find that concept particularly unrealistic, and Harry shook his head with a laugh while leading the rather pained older man over to a couch.
Speedy French swam through the air around him as Perenelle and Fleur enthusiastically discussed what Draco assured him was mostly just potions-related academic study. Draco himself was sitting beside him on the couch still, making a point to slurp his tea obnoxiously in Gabrielle’s direction, the girl taking every instance possible to make rude faces and gestures in his direction as well. Harry watched it all distantly, feeling utterly separate from the chatter, and not only because of the language barrier that had been put up. He just felt… far away. He felt as if he were watching the party from the window. An outsider looking in.
“You were born mad, you know that Potter?” He shot back noncommittally, hiding the bite to his tone as he shoved the biscuit into his mouth and began to chew. Harry snorted a laugh, leaning back in his chair as Perenelle jolted forwards, her eyes curious and hands idle.
“Woah! Bloody hell-Luna are you alright?”
She turned to him again, a small pouch of purple silk in one hand as she sent a knowing, pointed wink his way. “And if that boy was destined to die in May and not October, then that’s what I had to make happen. You understand that, don’t you Luv?”
Neither of his companions had said so much as a word. How long had it been since he had started his explanation? Minutes? Hours? Time seemed to have blurred together as he had become so focused on his memories and reliving all that had happened, but the sun outside seemed much higher in the sky than it had been when he sat down that morning, so it had to have been far longer than he thought. Harry swallowed the lump in his throat, rubbing away the crystalizing tears with equally cold fingers. He felt so, so cold; it was a cold beyond what he needed, a cold beyond what he wanted.
Draco felt his cheeks warm again, the familiar thrumming of his heart picking up through the ring pressed into his cheek and making his chest ache.
Harry hadn’t really known what to make of that, but he had agreed to try regardless.
Harry tried to steady himself, grinning in a way he hoped was at least somewhat believable, as he forced his shoulders to go slack and for his body to relax. “It comes and goes.”
Tom slowly sat back in his seat, rubbing a hand down his face in thought. “This is why you have refused me for so long. You don’t want to give yourself away for his benefit.”
Malfoy’s wishes be damned.
“My Lord?”
“Are you mad, Potter? I don’t want some random madman anywhere near me-”
new things, if they weren’t an issue last night.” She remarked, almost teasingly. Harry smiled softly, letting his head fall forwards again so he could level an exasperated look at her.
“Gone and had a fit, did you?” He questioned casually, watching carefully as Harry’s shoulders tensed, the boy turning to half-heartedly glare in his vague direction. Draco nodded idly at the silent response, before sliding up as close as he could manage to the other boy, casually picking his book back up again as he did. He turned it back to the page he had been reading, sparing Harry’s taught shoulders one more concerned glance before focusing back onto the text in front of him.
He glanced over to Perenelle, who had turned around to look at him, Nicolas’ retreating back facing her’s as he walked back to the house. She had a strange look on her face, a very faraway one as she watched the red stone glimmer and shine.
“I…” He gulped thickly, glancing between the three people furiously as the woman finally finished resetting his joints and stood back, her face falling back into the dark of night once again.
“Luna?”
“If you make the wrong choice, we very well might be destroyed for it.”
“What? That I was what?”
The third and final office is housed within the bowels of Malfoy Manor itself, and sports a wide variety of tomes, artifacts, and ancient family treasures that are under so many stasis charms that one would find themselves pressed to find a brand-new product on the shelves of a brand-new store that looked half as… well, new. The esteemed Lord Malfoy takes great pride in the office at his home, especially considering that it is the one he uses most often and spends the most time in. Those of his less-esteemed colleagues from less-esteemed businesses are equally familiar with the office, and during the height of the war, many of his subordinates also got extremely familiar with the pattern of the carpet underfoot, especially when their blood and various other bodily fluids were spilt onto it.
They came to the clearing they had first appeared in, and Perenelle quickly turned to the both of them, unclasping her bracelet in one smooth motion. Draco made a confused noise as she held one end out to them, her amused face barely visible in the low light.
Unless the muggles stared at his scar as well.
Growing pains and an empty stomach.
“Well…” He began, not hesitating to follow as she turned and continued deeper into the woods. “There tends to be a bit of an after-party. I haven’t heard of anyone skipping out on it before. And… well, we don’t exactly have a way to get back to France at the moment, do we?”
This chapter is dedicated to one of you who shall go nameless, but to that person: you know who you are.
“I won't fail you.”
“Perenelle… good morning.” He murmured, watching silently as she weaved around him and continued down the hall.
Harry wheezed a laugh, doubling over as he seemed to almost gasp for air—not that the bastard needed it. Draco rolled his eyes, pushing Harry roughly in the shoulder as he continued to seemingly gasp for breath, tears gathering in the corners of his eyes. Draco took a moment to admire the wide smile on his soulmate’s face, before quickly getting sick of the mockery and pointedly rolled his eyes.
Harry snorted, fiddling with the nearest throw pillow while Tom tiredly unbuttoned the top button of his dress shirt. “That would just about do it I reckon. So do you think he would be much of a threat if he did have a body? Just considering how many memories he has.”
Theo went pink for a reason that he wasn’t completely sure of, and made a vaguely disgusted noise. “Hardly, and don’t call her that-”
Sucking in a breath of air—more out of habit than necessity—Harry sighed, forcing his shoulders to relax as he took a step away from the door. Taking out his frustrations on Barty Crouch would get neither of them anywhere, at least not anywhere helpful. Besides, he was angry enough about how the World Cup had ended, he didn’t need even more reason to wring the poor bastard’s neck.
way by his grandfather, let alone
“Tooommmyyyyyy~! Let me out of these chains, Tommy! Don’t let mean ol’ Tom boss you around anymore, alright Luv?”
Harry righted himself, ignoring the ache in his back and tightness in his chest as he smiled at the pair. “Thank you—both of you—for all you’ve done for me. I will be sure to stop by whenever I can.”
“The last name I wish to honor, and one you all have likely heard much of over the past several months, is Ginevra Weasley. She, as you all are well aware of by now, was tragically attacked and killed by a werewolf, who had come to this school with the expectation that he would be far away from all students during the nights of the full moon.” The headmaster paused then, his soul flickering with something akin to… excitement? Luna blinked, taken aback by the odd emotion as the old man returned to his speech. “The werewolf was captured immediately, though he soon escaped and is currently evading capture by the auror task forces deployed to detain him. If you or any of your friends and family members have any knowledge of Remus Lupin’s whereabouts, please submit a sighting report to the DMLE posthaste. Now, let us all spare these lost friends several seconds of silence in their memory.”
Nicolas seemed to age before his eyes, the man taking a moment to mutter something in French before standing once again to walk across the room and take the stone out of its confines. Harry watched him as he came closer until they were standing a few feet apart, and the old man then placed the stone onto the table right where the sun was streaming through the adjacent window. Sunlight struck the red stone instantly, and in a burst of color the entire workshop was awash with red light. Harry looked down at his arms and body curiously, his hands and clothes bleached out in red due to the overwhelming crimson color. It felt… itchy.
Theo blinked. Then a second time. Then a third, before the old crone standing in the doorway raised an amused, if slightly annoyed, eyebrow at him.
There was a pause, infinite and inconceivable. Harry closed his eyes, exhausted and starving.
Theo watched his grandfather realize the meaning behind his words, and watched further as his arm raised a second time-this time as a fist. Theo felt as the fury and hatred turned to a gentle calm, and as soon as it happened he could feel the stone beneath his feet as it seemed to answer his subconscious question.
Alright people, I know that this is suuuuper late, so I have been making an effort to get back onto schedule and get us caught up chapter-wise. So, over the next three days, I will be updating daily, before momentarily returning to once a week before my schedule evens out and I am able to do bi-weekly updates again (it's been so long but I'm gonna do it!!). I hope to really get the ball moving again, especially now that I have officially planned out the entire story and have a good idea as to how the entire story will end! I'm super excited to share years 4-7 with all of you, and am super excited to start getting back on it!
Theo stumbled out of the fireplace with a yelp, attempting to get his feet underneath him before very unceremoniously tripping over himself and falling to the floor in a heap. He was still for a moment, contemplating if he was experiencing karma or simply bad luck, before he let out a sharp hiss of pain as his trunk came flying out of the fireplace behind him and landed onto his back with a thump. For a moment, he let the chilled stone underneath his left cheek cool the stinging sensation that was still present there, before a large hand landed on his upper back and he opened both eyes to find himself staring at a man that looked exactly how he expected a middle aged male version of Luna might look like.
Writer's block is hard, lmao. I stg I was just... staring at this document on my computer for hours on end, trying to remember how writing works hhhhhhh FUCK.
He stopped stiff, turning to glare at the lobelia plant on his right. The purple flowers swayed in the wind, swishing smoothly through the air as if they were not an omen of his impending doom. Nicolas groaned, rubbing a hand down his face before yanking the crumpled letter that had brought him here in the first place out of his pocket.
Harry leaned onto the large desk, crossing his arms as he watched Nicolas with narrowed eyes. “Yes, that particular question had been on my mind ever since we started this little demonstration.”
He paid the noise no mind, not stopping in stride as the woman’s voice finally registered to him. She was counting down, numbers of seconds ticking by without pause as pained and horrified noises disrupted the idyllic atmosphere of the forest.
“Nicolas isn’t here at the moment I’m afraid, though you will meet him in a few hours, I’m sure. And, please, you can just call me Perenelle, Lady Flamell was my mother-in-law. Do try to drink up dear, warm drinks always help with floo sickness.” She pressed gently, stirring a spoonful of honey into the tea before practically forcing it into his hands. He took it with a quiet ‘thank you’, not quite sure what to do with himself besides drink the offering and wait the queasiness out. It was quiet for some time as he sipped from the cup, his aggressive nausea slowly fading away as he did. During those sparse moments of silence, he took the time to look around and observe the room he was in, curious about what the Flamel residence might look like.
There was a murmured hush, and within seconds the entire great hall had gone startlingly silent. Luna stilled, eyes skating over to Harry despite her gentle thoughts against it. His soul was darting about more erratically than usual, as if waiting impatiently for something. Luna couldn’t help but feel that he was thinking of something completely different from the three student deaths the year before.
“Luna would tell me.”
life, just like that. No matter that his soul and mind were much older; the man didn’t know that and seemed perfectly fine with throwing Draco’s entire livelihood his way regardless. Was this new Voldemort truly so horrifying that the Malfoys were turning tail and running to hide behind him?
“Has he ever said who he is or isn’t? Perhaps if you listened to him, he might just tell you.”
The older man looked at him carefully, an emotion that Theo thought might be regret apparent in his shadowed face. “Then why do you insist on this? There are so many other places for you to spend your time. I admit that this old manor is doing your development no good, but those
“Well,” she started, brushing the feeling of scratchy lichen off of her knee as she did. “It just seems that you aren’t taking a moment to think about who Harry is, why he would do something, and for what reason he would do it. You’ve known him since your first year after all, you must understand that he always has good reasonings for things. He is very logical after all, he isn’t one for acts of unnecessary violence.”
Tom hummed, waving off Locket’s concerns as he fixed the doorknob back into place. “I don’t know, Locket. I think some meditative stillness would do you some good. The cup is always so good at sitting still, why don’t you try acting more like it?”
“Oh, what a delight! It's been a while since the gods gave me a name, you know. The last time was a year ago, actually. Almost exactly a year ago. This handsome young boy-I would tell you his name, but client confidentiality is very important to me-had a rancorous demon kicking around inside, and needed an equalizer to keep him steady. Poor lad looked all out of balance, so I sent him on his way without charging him a single knut. I do hope he managed to keep that thing under control, or at least didn’t have to use the equalizer that often. It does horrible things to the complexion, you know. Now, how are you, Theodore Nott? You look of better sorts than he did.” She prattled on, her hand still gripping his wrist as she led him over to a counter, on which sat countless strange artifacts and random stones, all laid out haphazardly and seemingly without cause.

And so, he told them. He told them everything he could. He started with his original timeline, of how it had gone and who they had lost, of how the Flamels themselves hadn’t lived long enough for their paths to cross his own. He spoke of how he reunited the Hallows accidentally, and walked to his death in the Forbidden Forest at the age of seventeen. He retold his conversation with Death, and of the few moments where he met Fate, and of his rebirth. He gave quiet recounts of his early years, of learning under a madman who lived in his head, and of how that madman slowly grew into someone less mad as time went on. He spoke of soulmates, and of creature inheritances, and of how both converged onto him on his 13th birthday, a twisted mess of presents he never asked for that were gifted to him by cruel gods that wanted hidden things from him in return. He spoke of the full extent of Albus Dumbledore’s manipulations, and of the ancient magics that had been used to bind away his emotions and make him compliant in the first timeline. With shaking hands, he recounted the sins of Ginevra Weasley, and how he enacted cruel revenge against her a mere two months prior. He whispered, with a shaking voice, how his heart had stopped that day, and how it had been giving out months prior to that, and how his body froze the air around it no matter how hot the day was, and how only his soulmate seemed to warm him anymore. He whispered of the agony, and of the joy, and of the pain, and how, through it all, he had crawled with bloodied hands towards a happier future, until he had no blood left in his veins for him to bleed, and his heart shuttered to one last painful stop, and how his lungs caved in and all that was left was bloodied fur and sharp claws. He spoke of sunken eyes and icy hands, and of the beautiful, scorching embrace that his soulmate wrapped around him when it all became too much to bear. He spoke about the agony of being apart, and of the ice in his empty veins, and of the daunting years of conflict that seemed to stretch infinitely on before and behind him. He spoke of how it felt like too much, and how it had always felt like too much, and how he sometimes wished that everything would just stop, and he could just forget all of it, even for just the smallest of moments.
Harry and Draco reconnect, the bond between them sparkling and sizzling brilliantly as fire and ice finally collide.
“Do you have everything, Draco? Are you sure you’ve packed enough pants?”
Daphne’s mouth opened and closed like a fish. Blaise didn’t know if he should feel concerned for her worldview or ecstatic that she was even capable of being shocked silent. This was a
Luna felt her eyes itching. She was supposed to be seeing something now, but
Despite his thoughts swirling around Luna’s letter, time still passed on for Harry, and before long he was waking up on the morning of his fourteenth birthday, feeling entirely underwhelmed with the whole thing. After the mess that was his thirteenth, Harry didn’t know how he felt about having an actual party like normal, or even celebrating in the first place. Sure, it wouldn’t
He hadn’t quite known what to say to that, but had made an effort to keep the conversation onto common ground. Despite his efforts however, both of his companions seemed insistent on asking random, inconsequential things about the Flamel household. He could only assume that, having been a part of the French magical community for so long, that the pair had garnered a reputation not dissimilar to celebrities, or-from the peculiar looks Fleur was giving him-meer folk legends.
“Oh, mais sa cicatrice Gabrielle, n'est-elle pas étrange?” Shuffling his feet for a moment, Harry peered around questioningly, before returning his attentions to Sirius and trying to block out any ghossiping that might be happening in a language he didn’t understand.
Draco just stared at him, before an unbelievably sharp smile cracked across his face as well. Harry stiffened slightly, watching as Draco shook his head before taking the plate of biscuits and cup of tea as it was handed to him by the ever-attentive Perenelle. He didn’t look like he believed a single word Harry was saying.
the house was. It seemed that every available space was taken up with something interesting or noteworthy, and what little space remained housed almost everything else, be it stacks of newspapers, editorials, empty inkwells, or jars of glitter. It seems like every inch of the house absolutely
How. How! How was that even possible? It seemed that each potential situation he considered only led to the conclusion that it was an impossible crime. The only situation that made even the slightest amount of sense was if Lupin had indeed escaped his warded room and killed the girl, but Albus had been the one to free the man early that morning, there was no way that he was the killer!
Harry took the minister’s hand, shaking it firmly before taking the other’s and giving it the same treatment, smiling down at the pair of them kindly. “A pleasure to meet you as well, Minister. Who is this?”
“It’s very dear to me, though not particularly useful.” She remarked quietly, reaching out for it as he offered it to her. She took the red gem between her fingertips and pulled slightly, a gentle smile on her face as he let go and, watching with a separated sort of fascination, spun it between her fingers.
He laughed lightly, absentmindedly patting Gabrielle’s head as he did. “No, my godfather actually lives lives up by the coast, but I’m staying with the Flamels for the summer-”
did he say to you, Harry?” Draco hissed, his fingers digging deep, biting pale crescents into Harry’s hand as his lengthening nails sank into Harry’s skin. Harry shut his mouth with a click, suddenly without words as Draco looked at him with
“I want to go talk to him Fleur! Can we please?”
This is a shorter but very important chapter, since it not only has the first Pansy POV (lets go lesbians!) but reveals the plot that will be following Theo through over the next few years!
“You’re afraid of Harry.”
“Of course, we found that the stone would slowly start to chip away as it was used, so every two centuries or so we would… well, the death toll didn’t need to be nearly as high, just a few hundred people here and there.” Harry bit down tighter onto the inside of his cheek, thinking of Draco and how he was
Sighing, Pansy ignored the log and just took off her shoes and socks, wading across the shallow creek instead of risking it with the partially rotting piece of wood. “Honestly, if he wasn’t the heir I would write to Zabini and ask how best to prank him into a magical coma.”
It didn’t really matter. In the end, Marvolo was never going to be Harry's largest threat. His attention was, for that moment, turned elsewhere.
The realization came to him suddenly, too suddenly. Scrambling up to his feet, he broke out into a half-sprint half-shuffle down the hall, cursing all the while as he fought to go as fast as he could while making sure he didn’t whack his head on the low ceiling.
“Yes, it is the amount of blood in ten thousand full grown men, to be precise.” Harry felt his fingers clench around the table as Nicolas watched him. He had known there would be a price-there always was after all. But ten thousand muggle men… it was so much. It was
And then, once Tom Riddle was dead and decaying, Hadrian Potter would fall.
different from his lords. They were younger. More… uncontained. Animalistic.
“They are certainly welcome to ask, of course.”
There was another, slightly longer pause, in which Luna was certain Theo was attempting to figure out the great puzzle that he envisioned her to be. He took a deep breath, and she followed his lead for a moment before deciding against it, and instead looked out to the tiny little pond and the single rock on the other side of the bank. For summer the grass was very green. She would have thought that with the heat wave that had come in not a few days prior all the grass would start to dry up and die, but perhaps the little pond had just enough water in it to keep the nearby grass watered.
Perenelle: "Perfect! Let's see what you can do!"
Even then he had been entangled in Lily Potter’s wish to keep her son safe. He had not even considered that such wards would do well to injure or perhaps even kill the child, too focused on trying to find a way to take them down. And once he did, his efforts immediately turned to protecting the child’s mind from outside interference through the mental shields of occlumency and sprawling fortifications of a mindscape.
“Or not go mad.”
“Then what about muggles, who have no magic? What about people with soul mates?”
“And how would you know that, Hadrian?”
The troubling occurrences in such an office aside, Lord Lucius Malfoy was rather proud of all three of his offices, though in regards to the second he held a far more smug sort of pride, one of a man who was in an extremely satisfying marriage with an extremely capable and… flexible woman. However, one thing that he had overlooked about the last of his offices, was the fact of lineage that it carries. You see, dear reader, Lucius Malfoy is not the first Malfoy lord to take up that exact office as his own, and it indeed has a bit of a lineage issue behind it. The Lord Malfoy before Lucius, that being his father Abraxas, also took up the office as his own, and his father before him and on and on until you go so far back that Malfoy Manor hadn’t even been built yet.
“You had
“-but, hey, if you’re not completely certain we can't have children, we might as well try and-”
“You had your chance, Potter. Don’t test my emotional integrity.”
He winced, remembering how he had been acting during that entire conversation with Mr. Lovegood. He needed to figure himself out soon, or his attitude would come back to bite him when he went back to Hogwarts and the people weren’t as understanding as the Lovegoods were.
Draco’s eyes didn’t hold the same heavy look of incomprehensible panic as before, but he could still see the uncertainty, the pain.
He glanced back at the simmering brooch, a sense of slight possession falling over him as he quickly tucked it away safely into his deep pockets before reaching out to Harry’s letter and yanking the blasted thing out of the envelope. Grumbling on about stupid inheritances and pretty gems, he took a deep breath to sooth himself before beginning to read.
“You…” He stopped, unsure what to say.
The thing cackled, its neck making three separate and distinct popping noises as it twisted its head around to face him fully in an utterly horrific, owl-like motion. Tom stumbled back half a step, repulsed. Locket’s grin widened, erring on the side of unnatural as its thin skin stretched across its unnaturally large skull.
“Bloody hell… that's brilliant.” Tracey’s voice pulled her away from the thought, and Pansy glanced up to watch as the other girl ran ahead towards where the treeline stopped and they were suddenly in open fields of the greenest grass she had ever seen. It had just rained the day before-a delightful summer shower that had brought with it a great deal of humidity and bugs.
Goodbye I am gone
She refused to ruin it.
“Yes…” he whispered, tentatively letting go of his arm as the woman took charge of caring for it. She shook her head mournfully, extinguishing the light of her wand before beginning to mutter some language he didn’t recognize under her breath. Barty let himself relax slightly, the pain subsiding as a cold, numb feeling washed over his arm and any sensation on that half of his body started to slowly creep away.
The Malfoy estate was sprawling, to say the least. It had miles upon miles of glorious hills and fields of plenty, and on those fields and hills were massive oak trees that housed all manner of magical flora and fauna. Draco had never been particularly attached to the grounds, as his fair skin and tendency to burn up in the sun had made him favor the indoors or the heavily warded quidditch pitch throughout his childhood. His love of potions that he developed sometime after his ninth birthday certainly squashed any remaining hope of him ever necking it out in the woods, though his parents never seemed to complain.
And, considering the strange feelings her letter gave him, it certainly seemed like she was begging him to figure it out.
“You promised not to keep things from me anymore, Harry.” He whispered quietly, voice losing every hard edge it had held mere seconds before. Harry felt his stomach drop to his toes, head whipping up to find Draco’s eyes pinned onto his own. “You promised me that you would be honest, and for the most part you have been, but I feel like you’re falling back on those old habits of keeping things from me for the sake of…
he could manage it. Right? He had been planning to give the Black lordship to Draco anyway, since Sirius clearly didn’t want it and he didn’t have any use for it besides the title and galleons in the vault. He could write to Griphook and get the paperwork sorted before the new year without much difficulty. He could manage it. He could do it. Draco would be okay. He would be angry and upset and separate from his cowardly,
Theo stood rooted in place, watching the man across from him warily as the memory of the summer prior forced its way from where he had pushed it down and away. He hadn’t considered the prophecy at all after that day, trying to keep the memory out of his mind as he went about the issues with his left eye. It hadn’t been purposefully of course, but more out of a subconscious sense of self-preservation.
“The… whot? No.” He muttered, his tone making it sound like the obvious answer. Blaise stuttered to a halt, genuinely shocked silent by the response.
With that, he let the door go, causing Albus to rush to grab hold of it as he turned and strode down the hall, ignoring the calls after him as he turned a corner and returned to the unnervingly empty halls of Beauxbatons in the summertime.
Nicolas tisked, patting him once on the shoulder before pulling away. “Regardless of that, you are welcome here at any time you find yourself needing a roof over your head. We would never turn you away.”
I do. See? It’s
“One!”
He stood very still for a moment, before shaking his head. “It sounded like you were out here with me for a moment there, I…”
“Oh my.” Perenelle’s voice made him glance in her direction, and he watched as she held the velvet-covered, tastled program of the event up to her eyes. “There’s going to be a display of the team’s mascots before the game begins. What are the teams playing? Bulgaria and Ireland?”
easy to just… just leave it all behind. To just leave Hogwarts behind. He didn’t want to face those familiar, aching halls again, with that oppressive air and the cruel eyes on him every second of his life. He didn’t want to face the bloodied future that seemed so sure and unyielding as it stood stern on the horizon. He didn’t want to face
he was. They, unlike anyone from the past, or the present, understood the aches of immortality, even more than he currently did, and knowing that there was someone who not only experienced it as well but had experienced it for that much longer, made him feel… like a child. And it had been so,
His grandfather cut him off, suddenly storming forward and gripping Theo’s shoulder in a painfully tight grip. “That entire family is a
parents, but okay.
He was not Voldemort, and he was not Voldemort’s consciousness. He was a horcrux that had willingly absorbed the aggressive, invasive soul, because it was in his instinct to do so.
He felt the tug of a hand held in his own, non-existent in anyplace but his own shattered mind. Marvolo followed the tug, pushing his way through a large door as he came upon it. The shadows seemed to hug to his sides as he did, whispering pleasantries with the voices of happy children. None of the voices were hungry, or wearing ill-fitting clothes; they existed separate from himself, living and loving and being loved in the way that children were supposed to be.
Nearing the familiar door of his usual compartment, Harry sighed with relief, pulling it open to usher Draco inside with a hard look towards the only other person in the hall—some random Ravenclaw who was watching them oddly. She audibly yelped, face erupting into an embarrassed red before she quickly turned away and scrambled into one of the compartments. Harry blinked at the reaction, not having expected it, before brushing it off and stepping into the safety of the compartment. Perhaps she was just a tad flighty.

“So what do you think happens when someone dies? To their soul, I mean.”
did that happen?”
Tom Riddle! Do you hear me, you murderer? Let. Me.
“My sister wants to apprentice under Madame Perenelle, you know? It was all she talked about in the days before today.” She whispered to him, conspiratorially leaning into his shoulder as she mumbled the ‘secret’ in his ear. Harry made an ‘ah’ noise, nodding along with her words.
“Pardon?”
“You must be-oh, just about fourteen, yes? What year of Hogwarts is that?”
Clearly, there was something very wrong here, and she didn’t have a single clue on how to go about figuring it out. It was just all
“Master?”
Blaise stood there for a moment, trying to process the sudden onslaught of supposedly old information, before his eyes trailed over to Harry’s retreating back, where his burn scar was peaking out of the edge of his collar. The connection snapped into place, and Blaise very nearly yelled in frustration.
Tom sighed, leaning back in the cushions as Harry took the love seat across from him. “I think it was mostly my fault, if I’m completely honest. I haven’t a clue how he managed to get a body, but only when I tried to reach through the hole in the wall to figure out what was beyond he seemed to realize I was there.”
Harry rolled his eyes, “so he’s absolutely mad, is what you mean.”
He sighed, the familiar action bringing him some semblance of comfort as Perenelle shook her head. “Whatever you think might work is good enough for me, Hadrian. Anything to help you settle your mind.”
“Oh don’t tell me you two are still fighting, Harry? Whatever the argument is about, it's completely ridiculous.”
been the right thing to ask, as Draco jolted up with a start, eyes wide and furious as Harry’s own eyes creaked open, his gaze icy as he leveled a silent glare in Blaise's direction. Blaise blinked, momentarily taken aback before he groaned with exhaustion.
Perhaps she was responsible for Nicolas waking up early that morning. She seemed like the only one who would be sadistic enough to force him into this kind of… scenario.
“Wasn’t me this time, Dray.” The looming figure muttered in reply, the man’s voice betraying nothing of the anger Barty could see in his eyes. But, perhaps finding pity in him, those eyes, no matter how truthful, seemed the slightest bit merciful, and without any warning, the wand under his chin abruptly vanished, the hand holding his hair quickly letting go as well as the man stepped back. Barty fell forward, catching himself with his one good arm just before his head hit the muddy earth below him.
“Yes, master.”
“I don’t fully understand it myself.” Stall. He needed to stall. “If you give me time, I might be able to explain how it happened, but I can’t confirm that you’ll… well, I-”
It seemed almost cruel then, to force that kind of experience onto those hypothetical children of his.
The compartment was silent for a moment, before Daphne surged forward.
louder as you were in the thick of it on the ground.
“What.”
“I’m Hadrian Potter, but you can call me Harry, and this is my… this is Draco.”
he should be able to do it again.
Perhaps he should be allowed to grow too attached to them, if only for selfishness’s sake.
He couldn’t ignore it as it sat there in a closed room just
Barty watched his fingers as they rested on his thighs, his thighs resting on the wooden seat underneath him. Nothing moved, not even a twitch, just as it had been for hours upon days upon years upon a decade. He tried to reach out, tried grasping for some semblance of bodily autonomy with strained effort, but nothing changed. Nothing ever did. His fingers did not twitch, or shift from where they had been sitting for five hours now, nor would they ever. His legs had gone numb, feet even more so, and there was a wretched crick in his neck that refused to go away. If he could move, even for one moment, maybe he would be able to give himself some manner of relief, but relief would never come. He would never move without his father deciding that he would, and would not get to choose what he would do once his father did indeed allow his body movement.
His screams of pain turned slowly into hair-raising cackles as the pain abidated and was replaced with
The next chapter will be a bit lighter than this one, though it will, as always, have some dark themes (it wouldn't be my story if it didn't, lol).
The worst thing was that Daphne knew bringing it up wouldn’t end well. At least, that's what she believed. She remembered Blaise’s mental instability from early third year, and was concerned that he would lash out if she tried to get him to open up about what Loki was up to. She knew he would never hurt her, but she didn’t want to disrupt the heavenly peace that was surrounding them like a bubble. Hell, even after the catastrophe that ended their third year, as well as the apparent fallout between Harry and Theo, the two of them had remained unchanged and only slightly shaken. She had even let go of whatever Tracey was hiding in an effort to keep her peace, and had looked the other way as Harry acted unnervingly suspicious for the rest of the school year. She simply didn’t want to get involved if it meant disrupting their happiness.
A glass beaker filled with a dark and opaque substance fizzed, the glass cracking as the liquid inside swirled. Nicolas picked it up with a pair of tongs before pouring it out into the container. The molten metal cracked and creaked upon contact.
He forgot about the soot, forgot about his parents, and with a mangled sob Draco threw his arms over Harry’s shoulders, practically
Harry shook his head, setting the now quite cold tea onto the table and firmly turning away from it, forcing his mind away from the scattered remnants of what was sure to become his life and onto something more stable, more assured than the uncertainty he was feeling. Draco’s familiar voice was booming through the tiny kitchen, after all, punctuated occasionally by his perfectly obnoxious laugh. Harry closed his eyes again, settling his head back onto the back of his chair as he listened to the noise, forcing his mind to go blank and to forget everything that was haunting him, at least for the rest of breakfast. He could worry about Luna, and Theo, and Draco’s disownment, and the millions of other deliriously aggravating issues he would have to navigate once the day was up. For now, just for his birthday, he would ignore the lot of it.
"Bien sûr. You there, Harry Potter?"
Harry hummed, turning back to look at her curiously. Her expression caught him off guard, something about it seeming distinctly somber as she took the watering can from him with nimble fingers.
(See the end of the chapter for
and it only got worse as the seconds dragged on. He had gotten a letter from Sirius asking if he would like to meet up and hit the town at some point that week, and despite the start to his alchemy lessons, Harry hadn’t managed to find it in himself to decline. Perhaps it was a younger part of himself that agreed, one that was still sore from the man’s death in the last timeline. Or perhaps he just wanted to get away from thoughts of ten thousand men and the speed at which he had resolved to kill them.
self.
She noticed rather quickly that, much like the way Hermione Granger walked—though the girl didn’t seem to be present; Luna passingly wondered if she really had been shipped off to France—the man hobbled along on a limp. She decided very suddenly that he had to have a missing leg, but… but he couldn’t!
"Oui, en effet.”
do, besides attempt to obliviate the both of them. But considering the pair’s skill, and the fact that he had just barely managed to dodge their attacks that morning with his already inhuman reflexes, it was unlikely that he could obviate the both of them before getting cursed into the next century. Why had they even gone to fire-based spells in the first place? Had they thought he had turned into an inferni or something?
“No no, I meant about potions.”
Just as he was considering the potential for a second course after the broth, his father finally spoke. “The World Cup is based in Ireland this year, I thought he might… enjoy being taken to it.”
to be a plan to separate the two, to give his lord his own body once again. Should he ask? Or should he stay silent? Barty fidgeted, uncertain and terribly curious.
The man’s eyes were an icy blue, and completely unlike the hateful red of his future or murky grey of his past. They were a scholar’s eyes, ones that were filled with a greed not for bloodshed, but for knowledge. The blue of his eyes was so bright and pale that one would find them more comparable to snow than the sky.
“Oh piss
you’ve done something. Just say it. I won’t get mad.” He breathed out, gripping onto the thin wool of his tank top as he half-staggered through the claustrophobic walkway.
“Harry-wait, it could be dangerous to-”
“Excuse me?”
Tom? Tommy dearest, are you listening?”
Luna stopped, breathing heavily as she stared down at a blank piece of parchment, quill poised in hand as she slowly sank into her chair.
He made a face, adjusting himself before pulling the two letters out of his jumper’s pocket. Though, considering how things had left off on the last day of school, Draco found it unlikely that Theo would be very chummy or all that inclined towards teasing. He didn’t know if that was a good or bad thing.
“Yes mother.”
“Hm…”
“Blast blast blast! Blast it all! I’ve been had.”
“Wot…?” He mumbled, rubbing his eyes as the scritching of quill against parchment began, immediately drowning out the crickets chirping outside. Draco didn’t even look up, his face stony as his eyes worked across the parchment in tune with his movements.
“My friend Luna and Draco’s father.”
The voice was unfamiliar, but it’s magic was most certainly
"Harry Potter? Eh bien oui, je suppose que ça pourrait l'être."
agitated as poor Rèmy chattered incessantly about the gardens. Nicolas didn’t want to tell the man off for being so unnecessarily annoying, as he wasn’t the main source of Nicolas’ general agitation, and he was clearly quite bored with the lack of people mucking about during the summer months, but it felt like insult to injury that he would have to sit there and tolerate an empty conversation at a time like this.
Harry Potter wasn’t a monster quite yet, and Draco Malfoy proved that. Or, he at least had to prove it
“I can't believe you did that, Harry.”
Draco rolled his eyes, waving his hand around at the room of people. “These are politicians, Harry, they’re not exactly used to people who naturally command attention. Fudge is a coward as well, so that entire altercation was doomed from the start. A hare would frighten him, let alone you and that smile of yours.”
The relief on her face almost made him feel deserving of the effort.
Much,
“Yeah, madly in love with you.”
He thought passingly, grinning slightly as he leaned over the small, pathetic creature.
well-regarded connections and had a wide array of important people at his beck and call, so any of those few who had either forgotten or were not privy to the knowledge of his death were more than happy to discuss the matter with his esteemed, pleasant, and charismatic son.
“Yes, this is-have I said that it is wonderful to meet you, Mister Potter? Yes, it really is wonderful, I would love to set a time for us to meet more professionally, have you considered politics at all, Mister Potter? I’m sure you have. Might I ask, I hope I haven’t gone and gotten my dates mixed up, you are fourteen, are you not? Yes, well you seem to have grown beyond my expectatio-”
Came the quick reply, echoing as normal through his mind again. Harry rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand, shaking his head side to side as if he could dislodge the voice from inside his ears. What was happening to him?
She waved her hand around flippiantly, a habit he could acknowledge was her own personal way of waving off concerns. “Mortal men and their denseness, you’ve fallen victim to it too you know. It seems that no one under three hundred ever understands that, so I suppose I can't fault you for it. Don’t worry Hadrian, I’m sure with age you’ll gain wisdom.”
“Do you feel closer to me than your own soulmate, Harry?”
Tom nodded warily, not trusting himself to say something intelligent if he were to open his mouth. The blue-eyed man always seemed to have that kind of effect on him.
“Do you ever wonder what dying might be like?”
He was jolted from the thought as a particular memory was shoved to the forefront of his subconscious, as he physically jolted out of his meditation, his frozen eyelids being forced open with a crack.
“He’s up to something. See?” She whispered, pointing her finger towards Harry as the tall boy swung his trunk around and onto the roof of the carriage. “Who have you seen lugging their trunks off the train besides a few confused first years?”
The bastard seemed to know this too, since he smiled in a very smug way before continuing on with his lecture. “As we have found through the separation of our own soul and of Hadrian’s…
Fleur : "Eh bien... Je crois que je suis assez avancée, mais-"
better conversation than anything he could have hoped for!
Draco took a shaky breath, setting the pen down slowly as he ran a hand through his hair. Harry watched the movement from the corner of his eye, grabbing tightly to Draco’s shirt as the pale hand reached down and started to card through Harry’s own, ever unmanageable mane.
Draco shifted in place suddenly, and the sacred moment of impossibility was yanked to a grinding halt, and Harry found himself rooted back into reality once more. A cruel, unjust, wretched reality where his soulmate was about to be disowned because somehow, against everything he knew, a soul shard of Voldemort’s had somehow wrangled its way back into a body. Someone had given the bastard life, and now the most important person to him was going to suffer for it.
that she was being forcibly reminded of those old dreams again. How long had it been since she dreamed those dreams? Two years now, she thought.
Sighing, Theo thanked the ditzy man and turned away, deciding he would go ahead and ask Luna what she thought before making any decisions. He almost got out of the kitchen before stopping short, quickly spinning around to address the man.
He groaned, and fell back into his seat with a thud, watching as the Bulgarian team slowly made their way into the top box. Draco seemed to be calming down somewhat, but his eyes still held that gleeful tint to them as Krum rounded the bend, sporting two black eyes and a lower face drenched in blood, his nose slightly offset in two distinct places.
The man’s smile only broadened, eyes still trained firmly onto Theo’s. “Well? Please, enlighten me of what it entails, dear Favorite of our messenger.”
He swallowed thickly, the feeling of unfamiliar magic itching at his skin making him feel as though he needed to scratch. In a sudden, inexplicable action, Harry swiftly moved forward and pushed the stone out of the sun’s reach, making the feeling recede as the room fell back into its normal colors. They stood there in silence for a moment, before Harry silently shook his head.
But then, as if nothing had even happened, Harry pulled away, and the crackling tapered off into nothingness. Draco sat there for a moment, blinking blankly at the vague outline of Harry’s collarbone under his shirt, before he lunged forward and whacked the taller boy in the side of the head.
“Yes, sir.” Crouch nodded wobbly, looking rather faint as Harry stepped away, already turning to leave. “And… and what do we do if there is already someone taking Moody’s place?”
She shifted in place, picking at a loose hangnail as the noise around her steadily climbed and Harry continued to not appear. Where was he? He had replied to her letter—rather stiffly, but he had replied—so surely he was still doing well, right? But Draco was feeling anxious, had something happened? Had Harry decided to stay in France? Did he not want to be friends anymore? Did he think that the letter she wrote was too strange and didn’t want any part in it? Did he-?
letter. Tom bit his lip, thinking furiously about what to do. If Marvolo was to find out about Lucius’ true reasons for disowning Draco, then the entire point of doing it would be lost and the entire Malfoy family would be lost as well, or simply get a very large and very bloody target painted on their backs. Maybe things would be fine if the Locket figured just enough to know that Draco was getting disowned, sure, since the reason behind it could be inferred and not initially damning, but it was a very thin rope that Tom would have to walk in order to insinuate such a thing. But if Harry went on spewing his thoughts out into the aether, letting every little shard of Tom’s insane, monstrous soul know exactly what was going on, then every last one of the Malfoys, including his son’s soulmate, would be destined to a very painful death very quickly.
He wanted to skin Lucius Malfoy from scalp to toes.
“Before we begin with the feast,” the headmaster began, eyes losing their merriment as the professors around him bowed their heads in sorrow. “—I would like for us all to spare several moments of silence for those among us who lost their lives last school year.”
He found himself whispering, nearly pleading, as his shoulders shook and ice formed where his tears attempted to escape. Bitter, and freezing. It was strange to get everything off his chest, just to verbalize everything that had happened and attempt to digest it all in one go. It was almost freeing, but...
Harry Potter had accepted his lord. How, he didn’t know, but he had.
She was sitting much as he remembered, with her feet curled up on the seat and her spindly fingers covering her eyes. He studied her for a moment, before his gaze fell onto the seat next to her. He had found it odd from the beginning, but even after finding out everything the idea still sounded ridiculous. Why would Crouch Sr. do something so incredibly risky?
“Bloody… fuck you, Potter.” He muttered, pushing the hand away as he blearily looked up from his knees, nausea slowly dissipating. “How are you not… hurling up your guts right now.”
“You’re going to have to try an
He was quite wary to attempt any magic past the simple basics, as anything more than that had the potential to alert the ministry to his happenings, which was hardly a good thing. So, a levitation charm had been the thing to employ, and while the effectiveness of his wandless magic was a tad lacking despite his future self’s mastery of it, Marvolo had been certain the second that the rock had come in contact with the man’s head, he had been in the very least concussed. And, when a clear cracking sound was heard, and the caretaker fell like a sack of bricks onto the muddy ground, he felt confident that the man had died.
He took a breath, taking the cloth off his face for a moment to flip it over to the other side. “Everything that I have been told has already come and gone in some way or another.”
His finger twitched.
“That wasn’t there before.” He muttered, shifting his balance to the other foot as he studied the door with narrowed eyes. He was positive that it hadn’t been there before. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, it had appeared while he hadn’t been looking.
The older woman waved them both off with a laugh, gently tugging the stone out of Harry’s grip as she did. He gave it up wearily, his eyes following her every movement as if she was seconds away from smashing the thing under her shoe.
"Hm... non, tu es bien trop petit pour qu'il soit intéressé par toi." Replied Gabrielle, in an almost matter-of-fact tone. Draco’s eye twitched, and he immediately grabbed Harry’s one free hand in a vice grip. Harry, however, merely leaned back into the couch cushions quietly, closing his eyes with rising frustration as the conversation fell further away from his influence. If they were going to talk with him, quite literally, right between them, then the least they could do was speak in a language he understood.
He took a shuddering breath, blinking away the freezing ice in his eyes as his free hand was taken, and pressed between to warm ones. The hands seemed to subconsciously recoil at first, the freezing temperatures being either a shock or a surprise, before holding firm, and tightening around his own.
it sometimes.
“That's quite alright-yes quite alright… who are you?” Xenophilius turned away before Theo could speak, walking off to the other side of the room as he muttered something unintelligible under his breath. Theo let out a pained groan and sat up, rubbing his cheek while wincing. His grandfather had always been in good condition for a man of his age, but his strength had been surprising despite that.
“They’re just quills, mate.”
“You can't just walk up to a famous quidditch star and strike up a conversation!”
“Oh dear, you’re right. Where does it hurt, sir?” She questioned him gently, poking and prodding at different parts of his arm with skilled, nimble fingers. “Side-along portkeying is a horrible idea, you know. Have you dislocated anything?”
Draco knew the second he woke up that there was something deeply wrong with Harry.
Hello again! Whew, it's been a while, but I'm back again with a particularly long chapter for you all. Cheers!
He blinked open his eyes, gaze trained on the vague expanse of the sitting room ceiling. Harry let out a disgruntled noise of confusion, Draco’s pale face coming into view as he leaned his head forwards, rubbing the sleep from his eyes as the other boy placed a tall glass of water in front of him. Blearily, he took it, sipping at the cool liquid as Draco settled into the seat across from him, elegantly crossing his arms over his chest before leveling a calm-yet-annoyed look in his direction.
She could ignore it for the summer, because they both deserved to keep this bubble of paradise for as long as possible.
Perenelle shook her head ever so slightly, as if she was trying not to move. “There are no pros of soulmates, in the end. All that they allot is a deeper understanding of another person, and force a potentially unwilling pair into a union that will always end in the deaths of both people. It is a cruel existence-”
“Barty Crouch…” he mumbled, observing the trunk for a tense second longer. He didn’t know if what he was having the man do was a good idea, but it would certainly make the school year work out in his favor. He hadn’t really thought up much of a plan besides ‘help Draco’ for that year, besides laying low after the Ginny Weasley drama, but Crouch had offered him a fascinating new possibility.
He had no idea what had caused the resounding noise, but it had to be something that one of the horcruxes had done, especially considering that the doors to them were on the west wall where the noise had originated. He could easily cross out the diadem and cup as potential culprits, as both had been the last of his horcruxes besides Harry and were either too bitter or too passive to want to destroy or hurt him in any way. Despite being created at almost the same time, the passive magics prevalent in both Slytherin’s locket and Hufflepuff’s cup that he had not been able to get rid of had deeply influenced both shards of his soul in very different ways. The cup was far more inclined towards empathy, something that had made it considerably depressed over the past decades, especially considering all that he had done in his life. The locket was much different, and had seemingly lost its mind, to say the very least. He wouldn’t put this past the locket in any respect, but already had a sneaking suspicion that neither were at fault.
He took a slow breath, trusting in the strange woman as she started to relocate his fingers’ digits one by one, nimbly resetting them with the skill of someone very used to doing so. He idly wondered if she was a healer as he watched her work in the low light, still pointedly keeping his head down as he heard more than saw his lord slowly stand, the man’s eyes turning from him to glance towards the third person, the boy, who’s own gaze still bore into the side of Barty’s head. His lord said something quiet—so quiet that it was indistinguishable to his sharp ears—to the boy, and immediately Barty felt the inspecting eyes leave him.
and I’m already sick of it.”
to be covered in something, including the floor, ceiling, and walls. He was honestly shocked that the kitchen seemed to be exempt from this rule, with the floor and its creaky boards being almost completely spotless. The shelves and counters however, were much the same as the rest of the house.
“Are you sure? He seems awfully… well…” Draco started, being unable to finish his sentence as Harry grabbed him around the wrist and started tugging him towards the man. “Harry-blimey, you aren’t really going to bother the poor bloke, are you-?”
“I need a few moments, Theodore.”
Harry froze stiff, rooted in place as Tom’s voice echoed through the catacomb. He tried to control himself, indenting crescents into the palms of his hands as he stood there, seething and afraid and
Blaise rolled his eyes, patting Theo on the shoulder with a whispered ‘whatever it takes to get out of here sooner, mate’ before he disappeared back into the stacks of stationary, leaving Theo to ponder without a second word.
He held up both hands in assent, stepping away from her bed as he did. She watched his magic churn with curiosity and concern as he cautiously left the room, a feeling dread pooling in her stomach as he did. She had seen the woman a few times of course, distantly, and had been surprised that she could not see the woman’s core at all. Those times had always been from a distance of course, and sometimes the woman had whispered her thing in the dead of night, but Luna had never been
“And as I have said many times before, just because you had
Shuffling his feet again, he focused on the sound of scraping metal underfoot as he grabbed the cauldron and lifted it off the fire, turning away to slowly, cautiously, carry it over to the open window. Setting it down on the stable surface of the windowsill, as if it were a pie, he stood back to watch over it for another moment, observing as most of the smog started filtering out of the window and into the outside air, likely making that side of the house particularly unpleasant to be in the general vicinity of. For a moment, Harry watched the wisteria vine creeping up the side of the window’s edge as it began to wither, before he turned away and headed for the door, waving his hand around his face in one last, woefully ineffective effort to see more clearly in the remarkably poorly ventilated room.
As I said last chapter, I want to get caught back up on the chapters I hadn't been able to post in the past three weeks, so I'll be updating daily until we reach chapter 10, and then we will be returning to weekly chapters until I get a summer job and my schedule is more certain.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Won’t Harry still be in France on the third?” Luna finally questioned, seeming flippant about the whole thing. Theo worked his jaw for a moment, before finally nodding.
(Don't ask me how I drew each individual freckle on Fate, I literally just used a shitty special effects brush that is supposed to be used to mimic charcoal or something, just really lightly so only dots showed up. The larger dots were hand-drawn sure but that took like three mins max. Remember kids, digital art is already annoying enough, the only way to get something good out of it is by bullshiting your way through the entire process and hoping something mediocre comes out of it.)
“Not to worry, children. There has been an age limit imposed on the Tournament. Only those of age are capable of putting their names in, so only those who are most capable of succeeding will be selected.”
“And what is the right path, horcrux? Is it death and destruction? Knowledge and power? If consciousness is subjective, then the right path is as well.”
“No offense,” he started, causing the both of them to look his way. “-but why the hell would you make a priceless artifact like that into a portkey?”
He read through the letter a second time, only glancing over the nonsensical ramblings about Harry and his escapades as his eyes zeroed in on the invitation to go shopping for supplies. It was incredibly unlikely that Harry and Draco would be there, just considering where they would be at the time Blaise was planning on leaving. August third was a little over a week away as well, which was plenty of time to make plans with the others and see how Luna thought of the whole thing.
“What are you doing here, Locket.” He supplied it instead, shifting around to lean his back against the circular door that was now keeping Harry’s secrets safe. The locket horcrux was by far the most unpredictable of the lot; a thought only confirmed by the day’s escapades, which had involved a near-constant fight between the two of them, which involved no small amount of blood being spilled on either side. Tom looked down at his arms, wincing at the deep, bloodied scratch and bite marks that had been left there by the locket each time it had managed to get close enough. The two of them hardly got on, especially now that the entire ordeal between him and Marvolo was picking up, since Locket was very clearly on the insane man’s side. This though… this felt more like a fight between archenemies rather than two disagreeing factions of the same soul.
“Hadrian, I have done unspeakable things through history, and all for very selfish reasons. You, a mere child in my eyes, have lived so sacrificially that every step you take is for another person.” Nicolas’ voice was quiet, just barely above a whisper. Harry took a shuddering breath, trying to feel the air come into his lungs in the hopes that something would happen, that he might feel blood pumping through his veins or any sort of warmth that was not burning up behind his eyes. “Why do you wish to create a philosopher’s stone, dear boy? Immortality is already your own, and clearly is not very appealing for you. It must be for your other half, yes? Child, even in your cruelty hides kindness, so much so that you would kill thousands without remorse, just to keep your lover’s heart beating. That is not an action of evil, but of love, no matter how deeply sorrowful it might be.”
“Tom? Come on now, Tom, you know I didn’t mean to call you a murderer, right? And Tommy… and I’m sure Tommy is fine with being a part of you, you know? Don’t… don’t put me back in with these things on-”
With the urge to scream only growing more impossible to ignore, and the agonizing seconds dragging on, he couldn’t help but try to reach out for
“Oh how curious! You must be 'ere with your family then, yes? I certainly wouldn’t 'ave been allowed into another country at your age.”
Harry bit his lip to keep from laughing, failing rather miserably as Perenelle made a particularly unpleasant face. Dissolving into muffled snickering, he set the cup back down again and slapped his hands over his eyes, his snickers quickly turning into full-blown laughter as he slowly lost all sense. His shoulders began to shake as he continued to laugh, and Harry slowly lost sense of the laugher as he reached up towards his hairline and grabbed fistfuls of his hair, curling in on himself as the laughter continued. Harry couldn’t stop it. He didn’t know if he wanted to. It felt so good to just…
Marvolo waited for a moment, cautious to move forward unless he was certain that the Aurors had not been alerted to his minor display of magic. He had no idea how much the trace had developed since his time, but if the scope of it had grown at all from how it had been when he was living at the orphanage, then there was a slim possibility that, if there was a magical child in the town below, the trace might have caught his little trick. When no one came, and the only sound he could hear was the wind and falling rocks from the cliffside, he dubbed it safe and moved on.
“Yes father.”
“You’re going mad, Harry?” He questioned, trying desperately to mask his confusion and mild panic with boredom as he awkwardly stretched across the chair. He shifted in place slightly, still studying every slight movement from Harry as the other boy seemed to slowly relax, settling further back in his chair as his shoulders fell.
“Eh bien... Je crois que je suis assez avancée, mais-"
Tom stared at the locked door, shut and sealed with a sharp finality as Harry’s nerves were finally expended. The locked door, which forced their minds apart so that nothing from his could bypass into Harry’s and no information from Harry’s could bypass into his own.
Yes, he had been born of a quick, split-second decision. There was no other way for him to live but that. He had to emulate his own creation, and the crazed, bloodied actions that had led to it. That was what the gods wanted from him, and all other methods of existence were clearly defective and wasted on lesser men.
Tom sighed with relief, his forehead thunking silently against the cold iron as he rested his entire weight against it, feeling utterly expended. He had tried to shut the door on his own, truly he had, but it was quite difficult to manage when one was as preoccupied as he had been. He could have been able to manage it early on in the day if it had not been for all the magic he had been using just to keep himself alive, but after hours of fighting there had been absolutely no hope of closing it himself. It had, quite frankly, been a feat in itself for him to have managed to speak with Harry at all, considering what all had happened, and even more remarkable that he had managed to keep his voice so level while nearly getting mauled.
forget that-”
He wanted to study his lord’s new body. He wanted to ask the man how his soul had come to reside inside of Harry Potter. Surely the boy’s consciousness still had to be in there as well. His lord surely wouldn’t have bothered going to the Quidditch World Cup if not, but if that was the case, then what could be done about it? There
Harry teetered for a moment, before the statement caught up with him and he blinked, mouth opening to request further clarification before Nicolas reached forward and uncorked another vial of blood.
Tom took a cautious step forward, bracing himself on one side of where the door had been to peer down into the blackness that was the connection. There was no difference between the empty space below or in front of him. There was no floor or ceiling or walls in sight. He stepped away, not wanting to fall in and see if there ended up being a floor after all, or if he would just fall forever through empty blackness.
It didn’t mean that the locket’s reasoning had any basis in reality though. He was himself alone, and while he had gained the abilities and memories of Thomas, Tommy, and Voldemort, that did not mean that he was hiding their consciousness away inside of himself.
“Harry.”
He narrowed his eyes, finding himself torn between annoyed and grateful that the situation wasn’t in the real world, or they would likely have a few issues.
His soulmate leveled him with a disapproving glare, before turning away and letting go of his hand as they finally reached the top box. Harry reached around and rested a hand on his shoulder instead, instinctively crowding closer as they stepped inside and a few nearby eyes turned to look at them curiously. Harry scanned the room, ignoring all the other eyes as Draco guided them over to their reserved seats.
Harry closed his eyes tightly, resisting the urge to say something particularly crass as Tom’s words taunted him.
Noxious fumes permeated the air, seeping into his clothes as his fingers worked in tandem with several of the ticking devices scattered around his workplace. Nicolas sat in the corner of the room closest to the opened window, some sort of enchanted cloth covering his nose and mouth as he muttered incomprehensibly under his breath, a quill scratching across a piece of parchment sat propped up on the sill. Harry shuffled his feet, the soles of his boots scraping across the flaking metal that had built up there after decades of not being swept away as he fought the urge to close his eyes. The fumes rising up around him took on a green, insidious tint, and Nicolas cursed, scooting closer to the window and as his breathing shallowed.
much.
“Oh come now, Draconis. The poor man is still injured. The basement is secure, he won’t get out.” The woman supplied, her voice appearing suddenly to his left as she delicately grasped his arm. “And Hadrian, please, stop dragging him along like that. He isn’t a dog.”
Letting out a long breath, Theo forced himself to straighten his spine and continue walking, twisting through the comically nonsensical-if familiar-passages on his path towards the nearest fireplace. He wouldn’t let Harry’s sins bother him over what was supposed to be a vacation, and he would be attempting to spend every second he could at Luna’s house doing anything
Blaise seemed to really love Greengrass manor.
He felt his stomach drop, the memory of Harry hissing the words
“Being shallow.”
Draco shook his head, staring up at him with a familiar mix of affection and annoyance. Harry couldn’t help but smile at the expression.
“Of course.”
The room fell into silence. Oppressive, mind-melting silence. Harry sat back down on the couch, staring at the floor as the silence bore down on him, and as Draco slowly padded over to his side and sat down beside him, their arms and legs brushing and Draco’s head just barely resting on his shoulder. The silence seemed to soften the sharpness slightly, and Harry sighed softly, reaching over to grasp Draco’s hand. He squeezed it tightly, almost smiling as Draco squeezed back in return.
Harry screeched, his voice layering on top of several others and distorting beyond repair as he ripped his hand away from his face, glaring at the man with all the hatred he could muster. Crouch yelped, pressing himself further backwards into the sharp stone wall in an effort to disappear into the cracks between each brick. Harry seethed for a moment, glaring down at the object of his abject fury, before hissing out another curse and turning sharply towards the wall behind him, taking out his anger on the old stone instead of Crouch’s face as inescapable thoughts of
“The fight…?”
Nicolas nodded, turning from his notes to level a stern look at Harry. “Remember this, Hadrian. Never try to correct for the unknown. Instead, expect the impossible and branch off from there. If I have learned anything, it is that the universe has a very funny way of making things happen, regardless of if you want them to or not. If it has happened once, more than likely it will happen again.”
“He was created before you, Locket.”
It was a brooch. Or, more specifically, it was an incredibly beautiful, and obnoxiously expensive, brooch. It was likely pure silver, and was carved into an extremely ornate feather, which itself was embedded with small diamonds that covered the entire surface. The feather itself was carved so that it curved dramatically around the middle, creating the illusion of movement through the entire piece. For several moments, all Draco could do was turn it around and around and watch it glitter beautifully, his eyes blown wide and an invisible, primal force inside of him keping all of his attention on the glittering mass of diamonds and light. When he finally decided to tear his eyes away from it, he was overcome with a sense of dull confusion that overplayed the awe. Since when has he become so obsessive with jewelry of all things? Sure, he wore his fair share of rings and he still had in the matching earring that he and Harry had, but he had never been inclined to blatantly stare at something reflecting light so obsessively. Was this his inheritance growing stronger? Was that also why he had developed a need to climb around in trees all of the sudden?
Harry didn’t dream anymore.
“Of course, because you were certainly brewing that potion. Tell me, dear, how much of it did you actually make?”
Sun shone through the open window, hitting the wall behind her bed and glancing off the pieces of smooth glass in the wind chimes, causing subtle refractions of colored light that danced around the room. Luna nuzzled deeper into her duvet, pulling the covers over her eyes in a lazy attempt to block out the light.
“Oh, the first century or two was filled with all sorts of existential nonsense like that. But once I hit three hundred, those sorts of thoughts seemed counterproductive.” Her eyes looked to a place far away, watching the approaching sun as her mind did the same, though centuries into the past. “I just started focusing on the act of living, I think, instead of the thought of dying. It had taken all that time for me to realize that dying just was never in the cards for me. Funnily enough, I don’t think Nicolas has quite realized that quite yet; he’s ever the mortal man, I suppose.”
Just as he said it, Harry had to fight back a grimace. It was a stupid excuse to have come up with. Sure, Draco liked quidditch and other things like it, but Krum was hardly indicative of an entire sport. Of course, the man was a seeker just as Draco was, but that hardly mattered in the end since Harry had taken control of the conversation pretty quickly.
Never.
Nicolas nodded along to his wife’s words, but otherwise stayed silent, as if he was trying to figure out the mystery through his own deduction. Harry pursed his lips, slouching further into his seat as the walls seemed to cave in on him. He tapped the side of his mug, wondering if they would give him enough time to come up with something believable before forcing an answer out of him.
Whirling around, his eyes wide, Harry stopped short as his gaze landed on Perenelle standing there behind him, her arms overflowing with folded towels and an amused look on her face.
Draco sobbed, the fire burning bright blue as his wings flew outwards, reacting and trying to propel him up into the sky. Harry grit his teeth, centering himself as he tightened his grip to force them both to stay on the ground. He wouldn’t let Draco fly away from him to deal with the heartache alone, not after everything that had happened that day, and the weeks and months before that.
“I’m fine. Once that happens, I’ll change my name officially and move into the Black family’s ancestral home. I believe it’s somewhere along the borough of Islington, but specifics are shoddy at best. I’m sure the bank has its exact address, so it won't be difficult to find and move into over the summer after fourth year.”
Taking a deep breath, Tom slowly peeled his hands away from his ears, the ringing slowly becoming less prevalent as time passed. Cracking open an eye, he blinked through the pain before forcing the other one open. There was rubble strewn around him, as if a wall had been blown inwards from the outside. He frowned, looking down at the floor as he pulled his hands fully away from his ears. There was only the dull ringing that he could make out, the only discernible noise coming from his own mind. Raising his hands up into the air in front of his face, Tom couldn’t help but frown deeply in concern at the splotches of blood on his hands. Reaching up with a finger, he whipped it gently against the tender flesh of his ear, pulling it away to see glistening red there as well.
The train of thought ground to a screeching halt as he stared, eyes wide, at the now unassuming iron door, realizing that if there really had been an attempt to revive Voldemort, doing it when Harry Potter was far away was the safest way to go about it. The boy was destined to kill him after all, it was best to cover your bases before attempting a resurrection ritual.
“Nick, I need to go talk to Perenelle about the Quidditch World Cup tomorrow, do you mind if I leave? I don’t think you still need me here.”
seemed to be pointed enough for him to understand that it had clearly been written in by higher forces.
Harry watched blankly as the Veela took the field, the roars of adoring fans echoing through the amphitheater. He observed as they started to dance, watching the display with idle curiosity and nothing more. If anything, he was feeling compelled to look
Tom was unsettled by him.
Draco took a long, deep breath, before nodding, leaning into Harry’s chest and laying his ear right below the boy’s collar. Nothing. No heartbeat, no steady breathing. It was just Harry. Harry being his genius, beautiful,
Nicolas contemplated the thought, nodding along as he straightened in his chair. “Well, despite that, I think he is a remarkable child, and a delight to teach. I do hope you are kind to him over the course of the tournament, Olympe. It feels like that is all it takes sometimes, to be kind.”
“Twelve galleons for the pouch and that rock, Luv. And tell Harry Potter that I hope his afterlife is going well.”
It was the easiest thing to do, as he was unknowledgeable in how his ‘dark mark’ functioned, and needed to learn more about it from a source more refutable than the Failure. He could certainly go to the families that he had already had followers in after graduating Hogwarts, but that prospect was risky considering how long it had been since that time. He had no clue who might be still sympathetic of the cause or who had cowardly turned their back.
It was a whisper, so quiet that he almost wanted to pretend he hadn’t heard it.
Right there, proudly displayed for all to see, was the Malfoy coat of arms. Harry quirked his brow, unease wavering as confusion swiftly took its place. Had Narcissa written to him? His name on the back didn’t seem to be in her handwriting though, and she always took great care to sign her name as well, so it felt unlikely. Of course, it also couldn’t be from Draco, since he wasn’t the type to send letters without his name and address either, and it seemed unnecessary for him to write him a letter at all, considering that they were living in the same house. Harry stood there for a moment, his still-waking mind sluggishly turning over each Malfoy that he knew of, before his eyes widened slightly and he clumsily ripped the envelope open and pulled the letter out, his curiosity piqued.
He didn’t
He set the now empty tea cup back onto the table, slowly sitting up as the nausea fully passed and his head cleared. Harry caught his eye from across the couch and smiled, a look that completely took him aback once he got his first good look at his soulmate, for the very first time in nearly three months.
He couldn’t say no. He shouldn’t say no. Every reason he could possibly come up with before was pointless now. Saying no would do irreversible harm, not good.
said, Tommy. Well, I want everything to be about
Harry. She needed to speak with Harry.
He nodded diligently, shaking the man’s hand a second time before opening his mouth, intent on getting out of the conversation as quickly as he could manage. He didn’t have to do anything in the end, however, as there was a sudden slam, and everyone in the room turned to watch as Ludo Bagman charged into the room, piling rolled-up parchment and other random do-dads up into some poor secretary’s arms as she trailed behind him.
“-that sounds about right, I had always thought that Durmstrang would be an opposite of Hogwarts, instead of being balanced like Beauxbatons.” Harry’s voice broke him from the thought, his feet moving on their own as he started getting pulled along towards the stadium, Krum falling in foot beside Harry, nodding along and smiling as if they had been friends for years. Draco grumbled, and tightened his hold on Harry’s hand.
“Good morning, Lady Flamel.”
It had admittedly taken quite a bit of begging and whining from her, but Tracey had been welcomed in eventually and submitted to a rather terse conversation with Pansy’s parents before they were both left to their own devices. It was all too likely that for the extent of the visit, the both of them would be practically ignored by her parents. As it was, neither of the girls had seen that as much of an issue, as that meant they would be free to do practically anything that they wished while everyone else in the house ignored them. However, a few very uncomfortable words in passing from her eldest brother had all but destroyed the mood, the two had unanimously decided that it would be best if they kept well enough away from the manor for the weekend.
mess to clean up.” He bit back, eyes disobediently leaving the wall and skating over towards the inconspicuous iron door to his left. Harry glared at the thrice-damned thing, not caring in the slightest that the man hidden behind said door might very well be able to hear him and his perceivably one-sided conversation.
How Fate Intended reached the 4000 kudos milestone yesterday night, which just completely blew me away. I want to thank each and every one of you for the support you've given me, in both this story and with Earthly Heavens. I never would have expected to have gotten this far when I first started out writing, and I am positive that without every single one of you being there, reading and reacting and loving this story, and then going the extra mile and giving your unyielding support in me and my nonsense, then all of this would not have grown into what it is today. So, thank you, thank you so SO much!
“P-pardon?”
It was clear what the blue-eyed man wished to convey.
“True alchemy is far more spiritual than what the typical modern alchemist likes to believe. Those of the modern age consider it a purely scientific practice, wherein one piece of copper metal can be changed and altered from its original form into something grander through tricks of neutrons and ions and its very base compounds. They believe that the only way to change something is to combine it with another to make something new. However, this concept is infantile at best, and foolhardy at worst. One cannot go for long simply combining and reforming base metals before they simply cannot be formed into anything different. Through that method, it is impossible to turn lead into gold, and it is impossible to halt the process of life in living subjects.”
The sun rose steadily into the air, and Harry blinked its rays out of his eyes as he took the final sip of his tea, draining the glass. Mornings like this one reminded him of a time he couldn’t quite remember, or maybe just of a vague feeling that he had been trying to chase for a long time. For some reason, he had the mental picture of white feathers and pink lips occupying every space that the sunrise didn’t fill. Perhaps he wanted July to pass just a little bit faster, if only for his birthday to come a little sooner. Perhaps he missed Draco more than he was letting himself admit.
two weeks. Or maybe even more than that! He could be getting a new carpet in a quidditch team’s colors, and would be able to see the blurry shades in the background during the daytime. Now
Nicolas willed his feet to start walking again, shortening the distance between them in a few quick strides. Not taking his eyes off of Albus’ face, he walked past the man and to the large door behind him, rapping against it thrice, and sat back to listen to the punctual echoes off the hard wood that the knocks had made.
alchemy?” If Fleur’s eyebrows could get any higher, they would be up at her hairline. He nodded slowly, watching as she gaped for a moment before shaking her head. “He 'as never done such a thing before, you must be quite a remarkable person, Harry.”
Draco sucked in a breath, slowly shutting the book with shaking hands. Ten percent. It seemed like such a small amount when he thought about it in his head, but the concept of it as it was laid out in the book… it felt like a cataclysmically large amount. He knew, then, that the fact he had gotten a creature inheritance at all was not only expected, but a practical guarantee. Of course, the fact of him having an inheritance at all had not been inherently a shock. Considering the past two years, he thought that it was rather obvious. What was a shock, was the idea that the Veela blood in his family would
“Harry-Harry Potter, is it? Wonderful, absolutely wonderful to meet you. This is the-yes, this is Harry Potter… the boy-who-lived? You know of him, I’m sure.” The minister tripped through his words, reaching for Harry’s outstretched hand as he stood to greet both of the men. “Yes, I-um… it’s a pleasure to meet you officially, Mister Potter. This… this is-”
But if it
“Not at all. You seem like you have been holding in many things for a very long time, and are beginning to let them out. You’ve been carrying with you so much, and whatever has happened now is clearly the last straw.” She replied instantly, the sound of her voice reverberating through his skull with the dull finality of truth. Harry grabbed ahold of the words, gripping onto them as if they were his saving grace. That’s right, he just had too much on his plate, and learning something so upsetting about someone he cared so deeply about was just forcing his body to react in tune with his mind. It was a reflex, nothing more. Luna’s letter aside, the last school year had ended in catastrophe, and he was still trying to figure out what had happened with himself and his wendigo, and how the two consciousness had merged into one. Perhaps the wendigo’s fury, its elevated emotions and agitated state of being had melded back into him along with everything else, and was making him like this? Harry held tight to the thought, trying to force the logical explanation into being as Perenelle started to rub soothing circles into his back.
Draco’s disapproving voice jolted him from the thought, and he turned around to look at his soulmate, an eyebrow quirked upwards in confusion. “Did what? You like quidditch and other things like it, so didn’t you enjoy meeting him?”
Barty strained himself to try and hear more, but could not discern if his father had merely stopped talking or was speaking too quietly for him to gather anything.
Harry also stood, taking one last glance at the gold before straightening to his full height and stretching his shoulders. The past week had gone by well enough, though his chest had been aching horribly for the past five days or so and his sleep was suffering greatly from the strain on the soul bond. He was loath to consider what might happen in a month's time, so instead kept his attention focused onto his studies with both Nicolas and Perenelle. The Lady Flamel had taken to lecturing on potions whenever he was free from Nicolas’ clutches, so he had been effectively blocking out the aches and lack of sleep well enough, though he constantly found himself worrying about how Draco was fairing.
Theo shook the thought from his head, ignoring the returning ache in his chest as he reached forward and firmly grasped the pristine handle of the door. Still, nothing particularly brazen occurred, so while wincing slightly at the thought of anything dire happening, he slowly turned the knob and pulled the door out towards him.
“Shall we be off then?” She questioned cheerily, getting a quick nod from him as Draco didn’t stop walking, continuing forward on a warpath as he continued to drag Harry along behind him. Harry wanted to ask if he was alright, or if he had done something wrong to make Draco upset in the first place, but forced the idea away. Draco had been feeling understandably wound up for the past month, and Harry was hardly going to go out of his way to agitate him for no reason.
“Oh no please, I’m almost finished. Is there something you need? I don’t think it's quite time for brunch yet, though I don’t have a clock.” She slowly sat up on her knees in a sort of half-shuffle, making an effort not to get her glittery fingers and arms onto the floor. He watched her for a moment, slightly exasperated, before deciding that she must be doing just fine, if she was acting just as Luna-esque as always.
Harry regarded the ‘empty’ seat for a moment longer, before turning away.
“It has nothing to do with you, Locket.” He replied sharply, eyes skating over the barely human creature and towards the partially destroyed library all around him. It would take a long time to clean up the mess, even if Harry helped. On his own… Tom sighed, running a bloodied hand down his face and no doubt smearing all manner of bodily fluids across his cheeks. It would take ages to clean everything up on his own, and there was no telling how long it would take for Harry to open the door again.
“What?”
do you do it.”
for a reason that Draco didn’t know. A reason that he wasn’t being told.
have you always been this despicable, or did you decide to let go of human decency when you first bowed down to Voldem-”
new consciousness, it is simple enough to realize that the different sides of our own soul’s full consciousness have been personified in each horcrux.” The man leaned back in his seat, eyes still trained onto Tom, who shifted uncomfortably. “Marvolo, as he is a consciousness bred from a time in which our soul was very angry and cruel, has of course embodied a consciousness that is malicious and blood-thirsty. I was created when our soul greatly desired knowledge in every form, so that is the drive that I embody. Any time before or after my creation is unnecessary for my personal consciousness, which is why I do not hold the maliciousness of Marvolo, the insanity of Slytherin’s locket, or the paternal drive that you yourself have embodied for over a decade. Each consciousness has been created from the same soul, but that one soul has changed so much over the years and had so many different goals that each consciousness varies wildly in motivations, character, and principles. Even for you, who was created in a very odd situation and was imbued with the desires of outside forces, embody the wishes of those forces as well as our own soul’s to the letter. Even though you do not embody the desires of our soul at the time of your creation, you still were created with the desires that you were, so that makes you a piece of the whole.”
Regardless of how much Blaise knew about Harry’s home life, or how the tall boy had gotten wrapped up in so many strange occurrences, or how he had a still unknown creature inheritance that he was still avidly keeping secret, Harry was never going to
Purple erupted across his vision, the floor giving way to light as he spun through space. Draco tensed his body, tightening his hold on the trunks as the force threatened to rip them both away from him. The intensity of the international floo seemed to be
Luna opened her eyes, brilliant colors of light and magic erupting all around her. She sighed, a faint smile painted across her lips as she looked down to the blank piece of parchment, and with a steady hand, dipped her quill into the inkwell.
The week before his birthday went on that way, with the days as uniform as they were leisurely. Each day started with him waking early, eating breakfast with Perenelle and eventually Draco, until the three of them would then wander down to the potions laboratory for a few hours. Around lunch Nicolas would find him and drag him away for the rest of the day, and then all four of them would reconvene for dinner, chatting about what they had done and what they had learned. After that, everyone would go in various directions, with Harry and Draco tending to stay in the parlor and talk until they either had nothing left to talk about or didn’t feel the need. Sometime after that they would both be tired enough to call it a day, and would depart to bed, only to start it all over again the next day.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well just because you're used to it doesn’t mean he can go around being so disgusting! He called you-”
“Not to the gods.” Said the old crone, making Theo go mute as her tone sent off warning bells ringing through his head. “Death is the one who calls the shots for who dies and who lives after all, and he’s not one to let someone die earlier than their time.”
“Did-oh Merlin-did you
“To be frank, I’m not completely sure I’ll stop anytime soon.” It seemed like he was doomed to back pain and, as he had found upon entering a shop earlier that day, crouching down to get inside low-hanging door frames. It was pure luck on his part that the door frames at the relatively new Flamel residence were exactly seven foot in height, and the ceiling well above that, so he had no trouble traversing through it, but he was finding that the older and therefore smaller shops did not give him nearly as much wiggle room.
“I can’t believe I'm being subjected to this.” Draco hissed, slinking further into his chair as the Veela continued to dance and the people around them got more and more rankerious. Harry laughed, watching as Fudge leaned over the guard rail, one of his arms waving wildly as the Veelas finished their show. There was a deafening applause as they left the stadium, and Harry pat Draco on the shoulder companionably as the Leprechauns swiftly took the field.
“Of course.” Harry smiled wide, his back very nearly breaking as he leaned down as far as he could, grin growing wider as Perenelle leaned up and, as she gave him a playful little pat on the cheek, kissed him sweetly on the forehead. “I might be able to come around for Yule too, if you would care to have me.”
He had noticed it over his last week of third year, and had decided firmly that he would worry about the apparent lack of dreams at a later date. It was hardly much of an issue in the grand scheme of things after all. At the moment, Harry was aware that he was asleep. At least, he was aware that his body had stopped moving and that it was getting cold to the point of his skin gaining ice crystals on it as the water particles in the air came in contact with him and his natural body temperature slowly froze them onto his skin. Harry was aware of all of it, but knew that he was supposed to be sleeping right now, so he didn’t open his eyes. He was unsure if this even counted as sleeping, or if it was some sort of self inflicted suspended animation that was brought on by his creature inheritance. He could only hypothesize how it worked, but could assume that during summer months, wendigo probably went into a hibernation of some kind to avoid the warmer weather that he now knew was incredibly unpleasant for him to live in, if the-logistically, quite mild-French summer heat was any indication. He mentally hummed, contemplating the thought with disjointed curiosity. He wasn’t nearly as concerned about the lack of dreams as he was with the lack of unconsciousness, knowing that while it was plausible-if moderately uncommon-for perfectly normal people to not be able to dream, his specific breed of ‘sleep’ seemed far more magical than was typically safe.
Her fingers left his cheek, and as he turned to water the next plant, she rested her hand on his upper arm.
“What have you done, Riddle? I
Listen, just... bully me. It's okay, I promise. I was gone without warning for like... three weeks, you have every right to bully me.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek in an effort not to hold the phial of blood any closer to his nose, pointedly handing it back to the man as soon as he was willing to take it while making a ‘ah’ noise.
Harry rolled his eyes, ignoring Tom’s scathing reply as he gazed around the workshop. It was a large, square room with tables and bookshelves blocking every wall, parchment thrown about the place as the smell of something burning permeated every crack and crevice. Half of the bookshelves didn’t even have books on them, instead being decorated with a wide array of beakers, various bars of different metals and substances, and other miscellaneous glass containers holding mostly either the opaque black liquid or the water-like substance. Nothing looked organized in the least, though the furnace inset in the far wall was impeccable and clean, a stark difference against the chaotic backdrop of the room.
He paid attention as Harry seemed to regress slowly into himself as the morning dragged on, and he paid attention as he became a mere echo of himself by the time Nicolas came down around mid-day. He paid attention as his soulmate, usually so impassible and indistinct, seemed to sag under an invisible weight, his mask of indifference momentarily
Fleur: "Well... I personally believe I am quite advanced, but-"
“How much younger?”
Draco, if for no one else.
the cogs turning behind Harry’s eyes.
made everyone around her jump, and all eyes turned to the main doors as they swung open and shut with a dull thud. Luna blinked, watching as a young soul—perhaps somewhere around two decades old—hobbled into the hall. The soul was excited, sprightly even, though its movements—its body’s physical movements, that is—felt far different from the soul’s movements. The stark contrast was so blatant and unnatural in fact, that she got an unpleasant shiver up her spine. The body and soul did not feel to be in sync. At least, that was the best way she could describe the shambling crawl and how acutely wrong it felt with the sprightly, excited ball of energy that was the man’s soul.
He thought sluggishly, eyes unfocused as he craned his neck backward, focusing on the intricately carved ceiling above him. Maybe there was some sort of creature inheritance-related thing going on with him. But, technically speaking, he had had his first transformation earlier than his birthday, so maybe it was some other reason that he was feeling so out of sorts.
She had gazed at him familially, or perhaps even grandmotherly, in a way that he had never been addressed, and Harry was unsure just how he felt about it. Warm, of course, and strangely comforted, but terribly confused and just a little bit scared.
In that shadowed darkness of night, free from the binds of his blood and breathing the hot summer air of late August, Barty Crouch smiled. He smiled so wide that he thought his cheeks were going to split in two. He smiled so wide that his jaw ached, groaning against the pressure as he fought down a crazed, glorious laugh. Immortal! After years of conquest, of anguish, of pain, his lord had truly become immortal.
It was eating her alive.
Due to an increase in masochism on my part, not only will I grace you with close-ups of these seven, but I also drew both Fate & Death as well as the Wendigo & Veela.
“Draco, are you alright? You sound a tad delirious.”
He pat her large hand comfortingly, before standing, an empty wine glass in one hand. “Think nothing of it, my dear. By the way, I do apologize for not inviting you to celebrate my birthday. Me and Perenelle were scrambling to prepare our house for a summer guest, so there really wasn’t much of a celebration to begin with.”
She stopped dead, breathing erratically as Theo’s form was fully realized by her. Honey, warm and melting, no eyes or green or hair. Luna took a deep breath, slowly calming as she fell away from the nightmare-from the vision.
Tom’s voice boomed through his head louder than his own thoughts, nearly drowning out Draco’s own much quieter one. Tom sounded angry, or maybe… scared? Harry grit his teeth, forcing the thoughts and his father away.
Barty hissed a groan, the ear-splitting sensation only growing stronger as the crowd screamed all at once, bombarding his eardrums with tortious noise until it was all he could focus on. His ears rang, the agony tripling by the second as blurry forms of people flew past his vision, disrupted only by the people around him, crowding up and towards him. There was so much. Too much. He couldn’t
Riddle Manor was very different to how he remembered it being on his one and only trip to the place. The once white outer bricks were now stained a deep charcoal color, and had what appeared to be various accounts of muggle vandalism all across the town-facing walls. The years of disuse had not been kind to the once stunning estate, and Marvolo couldn’t help but gleefully contemplate what his disgraced father might think of that particular fact. It was, after all, his death that had made Marvolo into a horcrux, so perhaps the bitter irony that he was now here, with the intent of using the home as a base of operations until a more suitable estate was found, was slowly dawning on the dead man, wherever he may be.
“I be buying the tickets, master, if you wish.”
Theo didn’t think that his future was at all how his grandfather thought it would be.
Sorry for this being a day late, I got a stomach bug over the weekend so my updating schedule was pushed back a day.
Harry paused his observations of the gold to look at Nicolas quizzically, before shrugging to himself and gingerly setting the petri dish back onto the table. “Well, thank you for the demonstration. If I may ask, however, I’m quite curious about the nature of that black liquid. What exactly is it?”
As soon as the headmaster had settled down into his chair for the minutes of silence that were expected to come, a sudden
Teenagers stifled by their environment at home will always make an effort to rebel against their guardians.
“What misplaced emotions would I possibly-don’t answer that.” He groaned, stopping just long enough to vigorously rub at his cheeks. Why was his face so bloody cold? The summer heat was bearing down on the house relentlessly, and the rest of his body was practically sweltering. Hell, he had dressed impressively light that morning, wearing only a thin button up shirt and trousers. Was there a draft somewhere?
“What the hell?”
The Lovegood residence was built in the shape of a rook, though it hadn’t been planned to look that way. Yes, strangely enough the home had initially meant to be a bishop, but an unknown ancestor who Luna had decided to name Ophelia Elara Belinda Jane Lovegood the third had found herself perturbed with the idea of being so intertwined with the concept of religion that she insisted they change it to a rook. The story went that she then proclaimed that ‘The Rookery’ sounded far more pleasant than ‘The Bishopric’, which everyone in the family could contend with easily enough.
Perenelle tilted her head, quizzical, as she removed one of her legs from underneath her in order to throw it over the arm of her wicker chair. The movement caught his eye, so blasé and without a care. He felt a lump in his throat for a reason he couldn’t discern, an envy that had no reason to exist. Harry wondered if he would ever experience life in the way that she did.
Harry glanced at the étagère that he had kept it on, which now sported nothing but the remnants of the skull that he had yet to clean up. It had split evenly down the middle, as if someone had cut it cleanly with a knife, and was now sitting quite pleasantly on the shelf like… well, like any normal ball of crystal would. He felt no magic from it anymore, and even the peculiar purple silk that had housed it had gone still. He supposed the enchantments making the silk life-like had been severed when the skull had cracked. Such a pity, really, it had been some glorious rune work.
Barty sat, eagerly waiting for his father’s reply as his body finished off the chicken broth. If he was taken to the World Cup, would he be able to feel the sun on his face, even from under the invisibility cloak? The thought sent another wave of excitement through him.
Harry let his tight smile fall as the two started to go down a rabbit hole of ingredients and brewing times, a familiar feeling of dread creeping subtly up from his chest. This was going to be much harder than he had thought. Sure, just saying that he would tell Draco about his father’s letter once a good opportunity presented itself was simple enough, but putting the thought into practice? It was already grating on his frayed nerves.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco scrambled forward, cursing slightly as his and Harry’s fingers both fumbled around the thin chain. He got a grip on it just as Perenelle hit one, and he felt the tell-tale feel of something hooking onto his navel before the even more distinct feeling of being ripped forward and through space made him close his eyes, resisting the urge to breathe in or even move as his body was thrown hundreds of miles across the ocean and back to Britain. He felt the unpleasant sensation of being stretched, tugged along faster than his body was supposed to handle as magic merrily kept all of his organs and body parts exactly where they were supposed to be, if only just.
“Oh, everyone needs help lad, you just need help in an avenue that only
“Are you done?”
She had never felt so cold then in that moment.
Harry blinked, before squinting at the man in confusion. “Sorry?”
“Two…”
“Barty enjoyed quidditch while in school, yes?” Barty focused back onto his father’s voice as he was forced to walk to the dining hall, listening in wait for Winky’s reply. Why was his father asking about his interests? Barty felt excitement scream though his agonized body, horribly curious and deliriously entertained.
There was a pause, “you had a good reason for killing her, didn’t you?”
“Explain? You want me to
Harry.
They stared at each other for a moment, quietly, before there was a flicker of something in Harry’s eye, and the tall boy abruptly threw his head back, his laughter booming through the room. Draco realized only a second after, and groaned, burrowing his head in both hands as the echo of near-hysterical laughter bounced around his ears.
“Oh. Oh, yeah, alright.”
Tom shambled to his feet, gazing around the large room for a moment longer before his eyes drifted back to the locket once again. It smiled at him again, bloodied and wretched. Tom grimaced, before shaking the fatigue from his eyes and pushing off the door one with a groan, his hand coming up to apply pressure to a particularly large cut running across his stomach. No matter how long it took to clean up the mess of his mind, it might take even longer if he had to heal himself of his injuries first.
“Oh don’t
It was quiet for a moment, contemplative, before Tom sighed.
“He can do what he wants, Greengrass, and your uppity little-”
They walked through the circular doorway, the taste of something vaguely spicey in the air assaulting his senses immediately upon entrance. He squinted, feeling some sort of tingling sensation in his nose, eyes, and ears as Tom coughed. “What in Merlin's name is that?”
“Right… well, yeah… okay.”
Or, more specifically, when death gods decide to meddle in things that no one but Fate herself would ever dare to meddle in, and bring one extremely unsavory-nigh
“And you, Perenelle?”
He had heard…
“I can help with that.”
“Hadrian James Potter for the love of Merlin, what did my father write to you about?”
“Fascinating. Would it be impossible then, to turn a living thing into a non-living thing?” He reached for the petri dish and held it aloft in his hand, feeling the weight of the gold in his palm as Nicolas removed his massive protective goggles with a curious hum.
The now nameless horcrux snarled, “that pathetic man is not alive in any respect. I am the true Voldemort.”
His father’s face was stony, and utterly indesirable.
His shoulders began to shake.
“I begin and end with you, Dray.”
“And you may be...?”
“Well, I suppose you’ve gone and been adopted now, haven’t you.” He started, unsure how to break the silence. Harry cracked a smile, his bright green eyes finally turning to pin Draco under their gaze. His breath hitched, completely against his own personal wishes, and Draco cursed any god that ever existed for a moment as he was swallowed up by that blasted
“No matter what your body and mind may think to say about you Hadrian, you are human. You are not an impenetrable fortress designed to withstand all forces, you are made of breakable bone and tearable flesh and blo-well, bone and flesh.” He snorted, shaking his head at the absurdity of his life as Perenelle let out a sigh of self-defeat. “My point is that Hadrian, you have every right to be upset, or angry, or frustrated. I have the feeling that you expect much higher things from yourself than you should, and I dearly hope you come to understand that expecting to be capable of things that simply cannot be done at the stage of life that you are living in, is not a kind way to treat yourself.”
“You know, Nicolas asked the exact same thing. To be honest, I’m more worried that nothing is going to happen, and I’ll end up being high-strung for the entire thing for no reason.” He replied quietly, moving from the spider lilies as she guided him away. “Draco is going through something very difficult right now, and I don’t want to make it worse needlessly. I want him to have fun tomorrow.”
“I’d rather you leave at least an hour before someone’s banging on your door with their wand glowing green, Dray.” Harry muttered into the boy’s shoulder, eyes trained on the messy scrawl of his soulmate’s penmanship across the ravaged parchment.
Her voice was light, in that same indistinguishable accent that she always spoke in. He thought that he might have heard a bit of Swati mixed in that morning, though he could never really tell. Harry hummed, noncommittal, before taking a slow sip of his tea. It was lemon tea today, he had found himself wanting citrus.
Barty froze, steadying himself as the voices all around him once again dimmed, and his eyes zeroed in on a tall, imposing figure. Black hair, white shirt, tall and lithe stature. Dominant and forceful. Restrained danger held taught within a thin casing of flesh. A couple of people followed behind the man, their faces unfocused and blurry in his peripherals as Barty stared at the imposing figure slowly walking away from him.
“It’s hard to tell, ever since you two merged. Tell me, when
“Ah, Nicolas, thank the gods zat you are here.” She sighed, before downing the glass and setting it firmly on her desk. “Please tell me zat Dumbly-dorr is not outside. That man arrived hours earlier than agreed, wishing to converse in the wee hours of the morning.”
“Luna shouldn’t want to see Her.”
He questioned himself, mind running rampant with possibilities. Albus was hardly one to threaten anyone, at least not directly, but he did have a general tendency to try and ‘persuade’ people to do favors for him when it was not in the least beneficial for them to do so. Nicolas himself had fallen into a similar trap many times, and he was certain that Albus still had several of the rare tomes that he had begged out of the Flamel library over the years, some of which being the last remaining of their kind, written directly for Nicolas’ use from trusted intellectuals and dear friends over the past several centuries.
“Aren’t you already mad,
This however… this was completely different.
Eventually though, and much to the relief of Harry, they made it to the ground and began walking along through the rows of tents, the two boys now following after Perenelle, who had taken the lead.
Narcissa, seeming to have just a bit more sense in her than her husband, pushed the arm away with a giggle, before wrapping a finger around his collar and leading him further away from the door and towards their personal wing. Lucius followed dutifully behind, attempting to take a sip of his drink as he did. Sadly, being piss drunk and thoroughly preoccupied with admiring his wife’s lovely arse, poor Lucius missed the mark a tad bit and spilt the bubbly drink all over his face and expensive three-piece suit. He cursed, before immediately forgetting that it had happened at all as Narcissa giggled in a delightfully erotic way.
Harry shook his head as Draco snorted again, watching blankly as the two chatting women entered with a sullen-looking Gabrielle following quickly behind them. Draco slowly raised up into a sitting position, his foot sliding from Harry’s lap as he scooted down to sit beside him, their shoulders brushing against each other as Gabrielle caught sight of him and her entire demeanor flipped on its head.
