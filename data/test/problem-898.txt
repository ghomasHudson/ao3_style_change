Blaise slowly sits up properly and eyes the two of them warily. “Yes,” he says, “it is. I can sleep. But it’s only an extra hour of sleep.” He pauses for a moment, “Wait! It’s only Thursday?!”
“We’ll start now. Just the basics,” Pansy declares and steps up. “Hari, can you give us some music?”
“It’s a wix town, Hari,” Draco sighs, “people come from all over to shop here. There’s not exactly a lot of places for wix to shop at, anyway.”
“What book did you find that in?” Draco asks, sounding bewildered. Hari blushes, honor and pride swelling in his chest that she would name the owl something from his culture.
The group eats while simultaneously complaining about the mistreatment of their children. After eating, they create plans for the new dormitory arrangements and draft the letter that would be included in letters to scions.
Dumbledore takes his seat once more and the steward’s staff taps against the ground. The sound of metal on marble rings through the Wizengamot room. Once the ringing fades, there is complete silence and the steward speaks.
“Either way,” Pansy jumps in, cutting Hermione off, “the perp will lose a fair amount of public respect once revealed and that will help the victim.”
Professor McGonagall finishes making the speech about the changes the school will be facing this new year as Hari takes his seat next to Draco. With Daphne on his other side, he instantly feels more secure.
“It appears sound to me,” Hari says thoughtfully, “the evidence presented cannot be disputed. After all, multiple healers who did not previously have contact with each other agree on the injuries listed. I’m curious to see where they’ll go with this and who they’ll be pressing charges against.” If you have the power to make people consider your case with a single statement, why not use it?
“You’ll withdraw them,” Hari says in an angry monotone, “or I’ll have you up on charges so fast you can’t even say the word ‘Dementor’.”
“I’m sure you’ve all noticed Mrs. Andromeda Tonks,” Hari gestures to the new teacher. “She will be teaching the new Wizarding Culture class. There will be a tiered program to ensure that each grade level currently attending receives the class. This will take three years, after which, she will be teaching a government and politics class.”
“I wouldn’t claw you,” Hari straightens his robes, “not intentionally. But instincts are a thing and emotions are dampened in animagus form. So don’t bank on it. Beau very well might claw you if you don’t let him down. And really, wrap my paws and cuddle me more? Beau would just bite you, dummy.” Hari pushes Draco’s shoulder gently and takes his seat next to him.
“We’ve got some time before dinner,” Blaise announces, setting down his cup. “Shall we go ruin our meal with copious amounts of ice cream?” His grin is cheeky and they all immediately jump up.
They spend some time discussing the wisdom of teaching Divination versus not and, in the end, elect to remove it from the curriculum. Students who had already taken the class would be allowed to finish the track through their seventh year, which means that Hari’s year is the first it will not be an option. On the other hand, classes that should have been offered are added, including Latin as mandatory for all years, Beasts for second and third years, and Healing, Wandlore, Dueling, and Advanced Spellcasting as electives for year three and up. They agree that as the classes had just been discussed and chosen, candidates would be presented and chosen at the next meeting.
“Right this way,” he replies and leads them to a booth. Around it is a discreet silencing charm, preventing those outside the bubble from hearing their conversation. There’s only a small extended patch for their server to step in to hear their order.
“Please do,” Daphne pleads, “I don’t like flooing. It gets my robes dirty and makes me slightly nauseous.”
Her voice is drab and droning and it kind of makes Hari want to cut his ears off. The bill contains several factual inaccuracies. Lucius has arranged a series of comments to be made by different allies, culminating with Hari.
I want to thank deeparah for providing the name I'm using here. I love it so much more than the one I'd initially picked.
“Sorry, I just didn’t think there was anything you could do…” Hari casts a quick cushioning charm at her shoes.
“Well, there’s all the Potter properties,” Draco takes in Hari’s nervous movements, “or we could go to one from a different House.”
“Quite right, Mr. Potter,” Professor McGonagall nods, smiling supportively despite the incorrect honorific.
“Yeah, well, there’s people out there who don’t,” Hari mutters, Dumbledore flashing through his mind.
“I hereby claim the title Lord Hari James Potter, Duke of Slytherin, by Right of Conquest. So mote it be.” There’s whispering this time, people wondering how he could possibly have inherited both, but the magic accepts him, so they have no way of arguing.
“The motion is carried,” Hari completes. Everyone takes their seats and Dumbledore sets his hands on either side of his podium, barring anyone from being able to see it.
“Alright then,” Professor Snape picks him up, “perhaps he can help me teach.” He settles Beau on his shoulder and crosses to his blackboard. With a swish of his wand, the chalk begins to write.
“Ah,” Lady Longbottom smiles almost fondly, “I do recall your mother saying the same about hers.” Hari’s heart practically stutters at that. He’s only ever been told stories about his father, except by Professor Snape, who shared memories like gold: rarely and with reverence.
“I’d come closer to mock you better,” Hari says conversationally, “but I imagine the stench coming off you would render me unable to smell ever again. Is it true you turn into a rat? Well, they say your animagus form speaks to who you are as a person, so I guess it makes sense. Only a rat could turn on its family like you did.” Hari turns his nose up, glaring at Pettigrew. “And you imagined I would just cave? Be so emotional over seeing you again that I’d forgive you? You cost me my parents! I’ll never forgive that!”
Hari reaches the exact center of the room and turns on his heels to face the Wizengamot instead of Dumbledore. He looks up at them, at the faces awash with awe. Nerves are the only thing keeping him together. He wants to look to Draco, but he’d have to turn his head. His eyes seek out Blaise instead and the boy gives him a subtle, but encouraging nod.
Hari frowns, “I’m not sure that’s a great idea.” When the elf goes to protest, Hari holds up a hand, “I don’t mean that in the sense that I don’t think you can manage it. You are certainly more than capable. But I’d rather have that set up as an emergency system. If every student knows how to summon you, they’ll be calling all the time. And while it doesn’t sound like a bad thing that they’d be able to, it could end up being a detriment to their learning.”
“Mother, Hari and I are going to spend the night at his Manor,” Draco looks pleadingly at Narcissa, “is that alright?”
“I hereby vow to bring honor to my seats and Houses in my time serving on this esteemed body, as Lord Hari James Potter, Lord of House Potter, Baron of House Peverell and of House Black, Earl of Gryffindor, Duke of Slytherin, Heir Hogwarts, and Count of House Gaunt. This vow I shall keep, so mote it be.” The seats of each House he has claimed glow, then the layout of the entire room warps. He moves his eyes from Blaise to the location where the Potter seat will come to rest. It had taken quite a while for them to figure out how the magic would shift the room. It came down to some heavy estimations.
A chime rolls through the Ministry and the group sighs. Hari eyes flicker longingly to the dessert table.
“Divination is a class you either are born to or aren’t,” Hari says simply, “your talents would be better suited assisting other true Seers, rather than languishing in a classroom where the students cannot understand you.” Merlin, he hopes he’s getting this one right. He doesn’t even know her. Or anything about Seers.
“Then, I’m happy for you.” Remus gestures to a door, “this is where the conductor is.” He guides Hari through.
Since so many people wanted to see the schedule, I've posted it on tumblr. It's fully explained on there.
“They knew you would stop rather than hit them,” Remus tells him, “so they blocked the tracks. Next time, just keep going.”
“If I leave you lot here, you won’t destroy my house, will you?” Sirius gives the small group a once-over. Draco freezes with two biscuits stuffed into his mouth, looking up guiltily. Sirius starts to laugh and soon enough, they all are. Except for Draco, who starts choking. After clearing that up, Sirius, Hari, and Hermione floo to the Granger House.
“You should have your own owl, too,” Hari muses, “and I think I have more port-key jewelry in my vaults. I’ll have to get you a few of those. Especially for Grimmauld Place, since Sirius is going to be my guardian.”
“My life has no meaning!” Draco pokes at the tip of the spear as if testing it’s sharpness. Hari sighs.
“I’m the current Headmaster,” Hari snarls, “and I’m not pleased.” The wizard pales and starts the train. They shoot forward and, sure enough, the Dementors part to let them pass.
“Not yet,” Hari says and kneels down to Critter’s level. “I would love to, but I’ve still got to go to school for most of the year. But I can promise I’ll visit more often.”
They go back and forth on the wisdom of keeping students over the summer, then put it to a vote. In the end, the three year tiered program wins.
“Lord Potter,” the eighth person that day bows to him. They’ve been in Diagon Alley for about ten minutes. Thankfully, not everyone feels the need to bow, but enough do that it is slightly uncomfortable. Or wholly uncomfortable. Okay, it’s wholly uncomfortable.
His sitting room is decorated much like the one at home, all dark woods and vibrant cobalt. The study room is simple, with a stand for his class books and a desk to work at in the same woods as the other furniture. The desk is large and nice, with indents for his inkpot and quills, and a cushioned seat. His bathroom is soothing grays with accents of blue. His bedroom, however, is the nicest of all. It is a deep navy with tapestries and furs strewn around to bring warmth. Fur blankets cover the bed and the pillows pile up half-way down it.
“To block only sound coming from the Wizengamot and the gallery.” There’s mutterings of dissent among the Lords and Ladies, so Master Tomeaxe says, “I do this in order to ensure the mental and emotional security of a victim of extreme circumstances.” While not particularly pleased, the Wizengamot seems to accept this answer and they wait for Master Tomeaxe to call Hari.
“It was,” Hari sighs, leaning his head into the crook of Draco’s neck. “But I was mostly irritated I couldn’t see all of you.” Hari pouts, “why do you and Pansy have to be on the left?”
“Well, I could have left the seats empty,” Hari admits, “but there’s someone who is very politically powerful who was attempting to use me as a puppet. I chose to claim my seats in order to see to their downfall personally.”
“But I like you better than both of those,” Draco says and the words strike home. “Granted, I would take anyone in our group over chocolate or cats any day, but I’d choose you over chocolate or cats for a lifetime.”
“When two women want to have a child, one woman provides an egg from which genetic material is removed. It is then placed within the egg in the uterus of the other woman and they have a child that way. For men, it’s almost the same process.
“We will adjourn for one hour. The doors will seal at one thirty,” Dumbledore calls and taps his wand at the top of the podium. Hari rises and briskly makes his way out of the room through the back entrance closest to his seat. He’s certain there are others around him hoping to speak to him but—oh, there’s Draco.
“Indicate?” Hari nods. “Make eye contact and maybe tilt your head as if you’d like to speak. Turn your body—especially your feet—towards the dance floor and bend your arms to waist level. If he’s reading your body language at all, he’ll understand. That’s how I stand when I want to dance and he’s always understood me.” Daphne doesn’t mention that it’s a rather typical pose, but there’s no need.
“We can have children with both our DNA,” Hari gasps, eyes wide. “And we don’t need a surrogate mother?”
“To start? He’s unnecessary,” Hari replies bluntly. “He frightens students, takes pride in terrifying them with talk of corporeal punishment before detentions, and overall hates children.”
“Right, get them both to think they’re sneaking off to give the other couple ‘alone time’, but there’s more to this—there always is with you.”
“You can,” Draco grins at her, “and you’re high enough in your House’s ranking to be allowed in for sealed cases, even.”
he reminds himself and ignores the little voice that reminds him he still has much to learn, as well.
“Lord Potter, you seem to have put a lot of thought into this,” Professor McGonagall smiles at him. “Your ideas are sound and I am most certainly pleased with the new teaching arrangements.” If only because it offers more free time.
“If you believe yourselves strong enough to punish one of your own appropriately for these crimes, then by all means, vote down my request,” Master Tomeaxe says casually, “but I sincerely doubt you will be able to place your dear Chief Warlock Dumbledore into Azkaban where he belongs.”
Madam Bones passes out the files of paperwork for next session’s agenda immediately after being elected, rather than make them wait until after dinner. She dismisses them, stating that the day had been one of upheaval and they would get back on track in the next session.
“Can you snap, Hari?” Draco turns to Hari. Hari mimics the snap Draco had done, but Draco shakes his head. “It’s a little faster.” He demonstrates again and this time, Hari manages to do it. “That’s how Critter wants you to call for him.”
Hari gives in and scribbles down a ‘cream’. The walls for her entrance hall were definitely pale, at the very least.
“If a student isn’t a scion but has indicated it on their letter, you will know as soon as the scions see their dormitory,” Hari assures her, “they won’t let someone get away with lying about a title. That approaches line theft pretty narrowly.”
Draco lets him turn around, then, the sneaky brat he is, he scoops Hari into a koala carry and stalks through the house to the dining room.
“And let them know not to worry about money,” Hari adds as she starts to dart off. She gives him an odd look, but nods and carries on.
“Eat!” Blaise orders, “and we will gossip about what the heck happened in there. That was so beautiful!”
There’s a prickle of magic in the air and then he can hear even more—creatures. There’s creatures in the room. Ajay lets out a happy snarl and crouches low, slinking through the undergrowth. Off a little ways, close to the door where Draco and the others (
The speech doesn’t take its full allotted time, but then someone else steps up to fill the empty space. Apparently, the Wizengamot is picky about timing. In the end, they approve more money to be spent to support the study of cars. Hari finds it somewhat pointless given the advanced forms of travel wix have, but he can see why it would be beneficial for them to understand muggle technology, so he approves it.
“You got it,” Hari agrees and sneaks a little peck on the lips from Draco. He hurries off to the Headmaster’s office, calling out the new password—Cobra. He’s going with snake breeds as his theme, though he feels like it’s not very creative.
Well, you guys almost didn't get a chapter today. Purely because I wasn't paying attention to the time and forgot to post. *facepalm*
“Actually, yes,” Hari picks up a stack of paper and passes it around. It has the new class schedules laid out. “We designed the new schedules to allow for the new mandatory classes, as well as give students the opportunity to take more electives. This, however, does not add to your workday,” Hari promises, “in fact, it will likely lessen it.” Because there’s more classes per day, the classes themselves are shorter. The teachers, however, still have the same number of classes to teach.
Okay, I've been so excited to post this chapter and the next, you all have no idea. Oh, my gosh. Ahh. Screaming and cuteness. So here's what's in store: school shopping and the Fall Ball. And I'm freaking hard over the Fall Ball. I'll just say, 'you're welcome' in advance.
“Sorry,” Draco laughs. “Come on,” he holds a hand out to Hari, “let’s go.” To Draco, the chat feels long overdue, but to Hari, who’s only just becoming aware of the depths of his feelings for Draco, it seems almost rushed. He sets his hand in Draco’s and lets the taller boy lead him into the library.
“It’s not usually easy to catch unless you talk frequently with that person,” Draco explains, “so, Professor Flitwick probably only ever sees her in passing. He might think she’s slightly odd, but we’re wix. Odd is kind of expected. Plus, she wouldn’t be putting what we discussed with her into her essays.”
“Or give him sweets and things like that,” Daphne’s lips curl, “let him catch you watching him a few times. Smile at him just because he’s looking at you. That kind of thing.”
“There you are, Beau,” Blaise leans down and scoops him up without hesitation. He carries Hari to the R.O.R without pausing, even as Beau pleads sadly to be let down. “Oh, hush.” He releases Beau into the R.O.R only after the door has closed and vanished. Everyone except Pansy and Hermione are there.
Hari turns to look at Trelawney, “I apologize, Professor Trelawney, but you will not be receiving new students in the Divination course. Any students who took your class last year will be able to continue until they graduate, which is four more years. We have several more classes we are looking to add to the curriculum in the coming years. Should you fit the qualifications for any of them, you will be the first considered for the position.” He offers her a shallow bow and has to look away when she starts to sniffle.
“A few of the questions I asked happen to be on that test,” Draco says, “She answered as a Seer would. That doesn’t mean she is, but it makes it more likely. At the very least, she should be tested.”
Hari trots along through the common room, begging treats and pets off the Slytherins under Draco’s (un)subtle watchful eye.
“Good,” Hari nods, “I will begin finding you new homes as soon as possible. Critter, I’d appreciate if you’d slow down breeding them until there is a more manageable population.”
“Dray, I gotta get up,” Hari shoves at Draco’s shoulder for the fifth time that morning. Hari sighs and decides it’s time to pull out the big curses, “I have a meeting with the Hogwarts staff today. Do you want me to fire Filch or no?”
“That’s fine,” Hari promises. “I just want to ask which kneazles are alright with being sold and which aren’t.” He looks around at the nervous cat-like creatures around him. “I’d like to see that you get taken to homes where you can receive love and attention. I can’t offer you that here. Those of you who are willing to leave Potter Manor to live with another wix, please stay. Those of you who aren’t, you may go.”
After studying, they’re sure to walk Luna all the way back to Ravenclaw Tower before moving back towards Gryffindor Tower.
“I did,” Hari points to the order form, “I went with basic ones that I’d be able to wear for a variety of occasions.”
They head down to the floo room, waiting for Hermione to arrive. When she does, she stumbles across the floo and Hari catches her before she can fall.
“Of course, of course,” Minister Fudge grins, but it doesn’t meet his eyes. Thankfully, Hari is saved by the bell—literally.
“There you are!” Draco stomps over when Hari steps out of the floo. “You didn’t even bother to tell me you weren’t coming back! I had to find out from Father!”
Draco’s hands slide to Hari’s waist and pull him over to straddle Draco’s lap. He settles into the cradle of Draco’s crossed legs willingly. Closer than before, Hari sighs and relaxes, letting Draco lead the kiss and himself to just enjoy. He feels a soft rumble echo in his chest and realizes he’s purring.
“Lead the way,” Hari waves towards one of the staircases. Critter scurries down it and walks to one of the rooms—the last in the hall.
“Oh, I want to do them all,” Hermione sighs somewhat dreamily, “I just hope there’s enough time in the day.”
They end up kissing for somewhere around fifteen minutes before the sound of footsteps outside makes them pull apart. Best to make sure they don’t get caught, at the very least. They make their way back to the R.O.R, where the group laughs at them as they walk in. Blaise makes sure to cat call, as well. Hari snarls at him. He’s loving this ‘ability to make animalistic noises while human’ thing and making the best of it.
“Merlin, I hope so,” Hari sighs. “If it’s much longer than that, tell your father to come rescue me.”
When Madam Pomfrey comes up, she details every injury Hari had received and revealed that most of them could not be repaired. He tunes most of her testimony out.
“That’s a pretty good chunk,” Daphne assures him. “Although it would have been better to see it in the forties.”
“There is,” Draco confirms, “but the person in question cannot know they’re being tested. It’s a series of questions and the tester observes their reactions and responses. There’s more to it than that, but I don’t know the ins and outs of it; no one does.”
“They’re going together,” Hari assures him, “they understand that Hogsmeade weekends are our only chances for dates.”
“It’s actually interesting you hadn’t heard. Since claiming my titles, I am Heir Hogwarts,” Hari smiles innocently at her, “as such, I can take over the duties of Headmaster as ours seems… indisposed.”
“It’s at the Department of Magical Transportation,” Lucius says, “you can send an owl for it, or a house elf.”
Draco laughs, “let’s go eat. We’ll talk over lunch. Father wanted me to ask, would you rather go with the Lords or with us?”
“I’m glad,” Hari says with a bright smile and he settles back into Draco’s arms. “What will you name him?”
“He is,” Hari nods, “and I presumed you would prefer him removed. You are certain you don’t mind having to do the extra work this will entail?”
“Well, there’s the places people normally go to, like Zonko’s and The Three Broomsticks and such,” Draco smirks, “and then there’s the places we’ll go.”
“Sounds good to me,” Daphne agrees. They hurry down the steps to the dungeon and knock calmly at his tapestry.
“Understandable,” Draco nods. “You were still planning on staying at your Manor for the night, though?”
“Ugh,” Hermione groans when they land, stumbling. Hari’s grip on her hand is the only thing that keeps her from falling over.
Recalling what he had read in the Charter, he calls out, “Potter Family Suite,” and holds up his wand, lighting the tip with a Lumos. Technically, Professor Snape could show him to his Suite, but it is simply easier to call for it with his magic. It’s a few tapestries down from Professor Snape’s quarters. Hari makes his way there and reaches out. Magic is the only way to find the door—that, or being Head of House or Mediwitch. Hari will have to add his friends to the wards wrapped around the suite.
“Do something cool again today. You’re dressed for it,” Blaise orders. “You look like a warrior.” Hari rolls his eyes with a fond grin and hurries off to his seat.
“It makes sense to me,” Pansy declares, “if she won’t take our side, at least we know she won’t take theirs.”
They arrive at Mr. Lazwell’s still ribbing each other and the old man looks on amused. Hermione suddenly freezes as she looks around the store. She tugs on the sleeve of Hari’s robe.
Ajay chuffs and butts his head against Draco’s hip. Ajay is more than ready. He prances slightly on his toes in anticipation. Draco opens the door and reveals the room has been transformed.
“That’s not—“ Draco pauses, then turns to Hari. “Hang on, the robes we joked about looking like battle robes?”
Yes, I could re-read it and try to pick up where I left off, but I've tried that and it isn't working.
“And you shouldn’t,” Professor Snape sweeps into the room. “The new Headmaster designed the schedule to take both professors and students into consideration.”
“Let’s,” Hari agrees. Daphne passes over her gift. It’s a bracer designed to look almost exactly like Hari’s wand holster.
“I need a piece that can be worn at essentially all times,” Hari explains, “it’s going to be a port-key.”
“Is Master Hari liking his room?” Critter eyes him nervously, “Critter changed it for Master Hari. Master Hari is being more like Lady Lily than Lord James.”
“Critter is being happy to help! Critter is also being happy that Master Hari is coming tomorrow. Will Master Hari be wanting lunch or dinner?”
“I want to date you, Hari,” Draco tells him. “I want us to go to Diagon together and Hogsmeade. I want to buy you little things just because I can and I want to and I want to cuddle with you all the time, even in public, and have no one ready to rebuke me.” Draco smirks a little self-deprecatingly. “And I want those girls who think they can have you to back off. I want to not be feeling crazy when I want to yank their arms off you. I want to be allowed to push them off you without anyone looking at me crazy. And I want to not feel jealous of every little thing someone else does around you. I want you.”
Pansy starts, “Due tomorrow: an eight inch essay for Professor McGonagall on the transformative properties of wood, chapter six of Beasts, translating that paragraph on page 127 for Latin, and reading chapter four for Herbology. For electives, it’s the work problems at the end of chapter three in Runes and reviewing chapter eight for Muggle Studies. No homework for Dueling and Spells.”
“Why choose to dance with me? If you asked Blaise, no one would question it, he’s danced with almost everyone in here. If you asked Theo, no one would dare go against him in his own Manor. So why me?”
“Alright, see you then,” Hermione agrees. Draco holds out his hand and announces the key-word for his port-key.
“None of you know how to perform it, so it can’t be me. I have to cast the spell,” Sirius scans over the group, “not someone obvious, so I’d say Hermione.”
They eat with idle chatter about their days, although the details of Hari’s meetings are left out by Lucius’ design. Not that it matters. As soon as they get up to their joined rooms, Draco rounds on Hari.
“Rash?” Hari feels his anger start to swell, but keeps his voice in the same monotone, eyes and posture steady and confident. “Do I look like I’m being rash to you? Rash was thinking it a good idea to send Dementors to a school. There’s children here, not criminals. You will remove them, or I will remove you from the general populace,
“I know,” Professor Snape sighs, “but it has created arguments and it would be best if someone of the hierarchy was there to lay it out plainly.” There’s a pause, “you’ve done well today. Is that what you’re like in court?” He glances down at Hari, interested.
“That,” Draco beams, but still sounds a little bitter, “and because she’s been researching and studying his culture for him.”
“And Lord Potter could afford to purchase a new outfit for all of you every day from my shop and still be one of the richest wix in Europe,” Mr. Lazwell declares. Then, he drops into a smooth bow.
“You’re lucky I got your measurements from Mr. Lazwell or we’d be in that store far longer than two hours,” she snaps. Hari sighs, but lets it go. “Come on, ‘Mia, let’s go get you some pretty robes.” She tosses the slip with Hari’s measurements at him and drags Hermione off. Daphne shoots him an apologetic glance, but races off after them.
“I call for the doors to be sealed and this session of the Wizengamot on the third of August to begin,” Dumbledore intones and the doors close. His eyes scan the waiting witnesses and goblins in the gallery. Madam Pomfrey, Professor Snape, Professor McGonagall, Healer Ripclaw, Bill Weasley, Griphook, and several goblins he doesn’t recognize. “The first piece on our agenda is an inquiry from the goblins. I call Goblin Solicitor Tomeaxe to the floor.”
“She was walking around yesterday without shoes and said ‘nargles’ took them, then explained nargles can be people. She also said most people call her ‘Loony’.”
“It probably gets old living as a rat,” Pansy sneers. “And disgusting.” They all shudder at the idea of the things he’d probably had to do as a rat to survive.
“I’ll come tell them with you,” Hari offers. “They’re collecting you from the Leakey—or do you have your floo connected?”
“After we get back tonight,” Hari nods sharply. “I want every, single Knut they’ve made off selling my name.”
“Oh, no, I don’t have to worry about that,” Hari smiles at her, “perks of being a Lord. Although, they still tried to discourage me from using it too much. I say who cares. It’s not like I know advanced spells, anyway.”
“How about this,” Pansy starts, “we almost never see the two of you apart. One of us can go over there and talk to him, see how the conversation goes, see if we can feel him out.”
“She was talking about something called nargles,” Hari adds, “she said they create bad thoughts, that they can be people or habits and patterns of thought. She said Professor Snape has an infestation.”
“The room is perfect, Critter,” Hari grins, “I love it.” Hari stands back up, “why don’t we go take a peek in my study.”
“Tonks!” Shacklebot calls, shoving Pettigrew into the shop. “Let’s wrap this up. Lord Potter, we’ll send notice when we can if we need your testimony.”
“You look incredible,” Hari says simply. Words, for whatever reason, seem to not be working at the moment.
“I would love that,” Hari practically breathes, “I’ll send you an owl, sometime, and we can have tea.”
Hari snorts and looks at Hermione, “got a CD player?” Hermione gestures to the side table and Hari skims through her CD collection until he finds one that suits their needs. In a moment, a soothing, slow waltz is playing. Pansy starts to step forward, but Blaise makes it there first.  With all of them helping, they manage to get Hermione successfully through a full dance.
“Like this morning wasn’t bad enough?” Pansy whines, “Aside from you breaking up the monotony, that was the dullest morning yet. Mostly because of who was speaking.”
“My spot is this way,” Hari says and turns, heading up one flight of stairs. He leads Draco the long way, circling the balcony. One of the windows curves out of the wall on this floor, creating almost a small room. It even has curtains on it. Additionally, portions of the window are solid panes stained glass, in each color of the rainbow, making it incredibly beautiful. When they get there, Critter’s treats for them are already sitting on a low tray in the center of the massive seat.
“Alright,” he looks around at the crups, “Critter can you send off the ones over fifteen?” When the smaller grouping is left, Hari announces, “many of you will be going to new homes. I want to check that you are alright with this.” There’s some barking, but in general, they don’t seem upset. “Good. I will strive to find the most loving of homes for all of you.”
“Good choice,” Blaise comes back over from wandering through the fabrics, “Mother made the mistake once of only having bright colors on hand and had to have something pre-made sent to the Villa for an event.” He shudders, “it was hideous, but we altered it enough that no one could tell for one night.”
Professor McGonagall makes eye contact and flicks her gaze to the windows. Hari nods, letting her know that Fudge has been handled. The relief she feels is visible, even from this distance.
“I’m positive,” Daphne promises, “Now, as for liking boys, it is an entirely muggle mindset to disapprove of it. Love is love and it isn’t like we don’t have magic to see to reproduction.”
“He should be right this way.” The taller man leans in slightly, “if you behave as if you are speaking to me, the others will not ambush you.”
Draco follows his gaze and cringes, “you’d think they’d at least have the decency to stop now that you’re in our world.”
Hari lets a beat pass once the new seat has shone for everyone to see, then starts towards it. Up the stairs on the left of the center column, away from the Ministry and surrounded by Nobility. It may have made waves it he’d chosen to walk up the right side, but this way is traditional for a new Lord and he’s not sure he likes the looks on the faces of the wix in the smallest section.
“Lucius, Narcissa, you both look wonderful,” Hari tells them, smiling sweetly. Narcissa offers a small smile of her own in thanks while Lucius replies in turn. Hari takes in Draco’s sleek charcoal robes embroidered in silver. He looks incredible, but for some reason, Hari cannot get the words out of his mouth. He glances around instead.
“Exactly,” Hari spins his cup in his hands. “So, I wanted to make her a space in my Manor before taking her there. Kind of show her I’ve already accepted her in.”
He leaps onto the starting platform and, coiling his muscles, he takes off. The course pushes his balance and coordination primarily, speed not as much a concern in this form. If he were Beau, he would be leaping as quickly as he could, the platforms trying to throw him off if he didn’t move fast enough. But tigers are known for creeping, for ambushing, so instead it shrinks and forces him to adapt to rougher angles and bad footing. He leaps around for nearly an hour before the door opens and Professor Snape peeks in.
“Just to let you know that we’re going to go visit another property today,” Hari says, “so we’re going to leave now that we’ve finished lunch.”
“Good,” Hari replies, smiling as he takes another bite, “the Wizengamot sessions have been going well and I adapted the Hogwarts curriculum to be what the Founders originally intended. It’s a work in progress, but it’s progress. Oh, and I’m dating Draco.” He says the last bit with a little fear in his voice, but Remus just smiles over his shoulder at Hari.
“Right, who did you end up suggesting?” Blaise asks. “We’re not allowed to nominate anyone and we don’t get to vote on anything, so no one’s telling us anything.”
There’s a long silence in the chamber before someone calls out, “we cannot just allow you to take a wix without knowing who you are requesting to arrest. You already stated they are in this room. Should we not be allowed to punish our own?”
“Well,” Professor Snape leans against a table, “the free hours and established mealtimes definitely help.”
Her testimony is brief and her voice wavers a few times, but her face is stiff and she manages not to shed a single tear.
It’s the day of nominations for the new Chief Warlock. Hari dresses primarily in black, with only muted red robes and a succinite, or dark amber, tie and pocket square to set it apart. Amber is the House stone of the House of Bones and Hari thought it would be appropriate to represent his pick. The red, while most would assume is to represent House of Gryffindor, is actually the same shade Aurors wear, as a nod to her position as Head of the DMLE.
“Just bring me,” Draco decides, “every time. That’ll solve everything.” Hari laughs a little at this. Draco starts to run his fingers through Hari’s hair. The movement is repetitive and soothing, like being petted as Beau or Ajay. A soft rumble rolls through Hari’s chest and Draco freezes for a moment.
“Hari!” Draco shrieks when Hari walks in the door. Hari winces at the sudden noise, but takes the hug without complaint. “I got you the best birthday present ever.”
“Hence, we went shopping.” Hari smiles, “don’t worry, I’ll try to pick out things that won’t stand out. If it means making a new port-key, then so be it.”
“Everyone ready?” Blaise asks. When he gets a sea of nods, he tells them to pass. The essays slide two people over to be edited for spelling and grammar and blatant, obvious errors. Although, with the way they work, errors don’t happen too often. In five minutes, the parchments are being passed back, corrected and neat.
Hari nods at this. Slytherin, he knows from experience, can be a pretty judgmental place. He wouldn’t want to be the one that judgment is directed at. Thankfully, Hari is a Lord. That alone protects him from any and all judgment the other students could pile on him.
“No,” Hari shakes his head and Draco wraps him up from behind. “He just tried to talk to me. I didn’t give him a chance to try anything before petrifying him.”
“You plan to do all your work as a Lord here, don’t you?” Draco’s voice is teasing, but there’s a hint of sadness to it.
“Yeah, yeah, laugh all you want,” Draco rolls his eyes. His fingers thread through Hari’s and they lean into each other. Hari allows himself to relax and enjoy the moment.
“Maybe not all of them,” Hari giggles and winks, “you’re the chef around here, after all. And an incredibly good one, at that.” Critter positively beams at that.
Hari’s classes last until seven thirty that evening—he almost wishes he’d simply set dinner to run late enough that a mandatory dinnertime wasn’t necessary, just so that day would end a little sooner. But, it is nice getting that break between classes and getting to run around as Beau for a few minutes.
The meeting has wrapped up with this and so Hari makes his way down to the Entrance Hall and port-keys to Potter Manor, then floos to Malfoy Manor.
“Okay, because Luna has this really interesting way of seeing the world and I just thought it hit a little too close to the truth,” Hari says quickly.
“Draco practically thinks you hung the moon,” Daphne interrupts. “If you asked him to, he’d find a way to buy you all the stars in the sky.”
“Critter will be back with afternoon tea,” Critter confirms and vanishes, coming back only minutes later with piping hot tea and biscuits.
Hari stands and straightens his robes, looking at Lord Macmillan out of the corner of his eye, “I think that everyone in here is human and just as capable of evil as the people not in this room.”
“Lord Potter,” she bows in a sweeping gesture, “I am delighted to finally meet you. I have heard many good things about you.” Blaise turns a little pink at this, but his mother carries on, “from both my son and Lord Malfoy.”
“Let’s get something to eat,” Sirius suggests. “We can do the other Potter properties later.” At the end of the night, Draco is protecting Potter Manor, Daphne has Potter Cottage, Blaise has the Potter Minor Manor, and Pansy is keeping Lion’s Den, one of Hari’s Gryffindor properties that hasn’t fallen into disrepair.
“Good,” Hari nods shortly, “I can’t wait.” Hari enters the Common Room, where some of the older years are already wondering aloud if the cute kitten from last year will be back. He smirks up at Draco.
“One day, you will,” Draco assures him. “It doesn’t have to be today. But I wanted you to know. You seemed so scared, every time you thought of this conversation, and I never want you to be scared.” Draco pours both of them mugs of hot chocolate and presses one into Hari’s hands. Hari smiles slightly at him and watches Draco practically melt; his whole mask has been dismantled. He wants Hari to see everything.
“Eight,” Pansy corrects, “Us four, Theo, Millicent, Crabbe, and Goyle. And we had two tutors, plus Lady Malfoy for etiquette.”
“Well, I’m off.” They all wave to him, still chowing down on the delicious treats. Hari rolls his eyes at them and hurries off.
“How is it still so clean?” Daphne whispers. “I don’t think anyone’s lived here in several hundred years.”
“Thirty years,” Critter tells him. Hari takes this to be an average and skims his eyes over the ones watching him warily.
“Right,” Hermione nods and stands, scooping up her shoes. “Thank you, Lady Malfoy. I’ll see you at the train, Hari, Draco.” She steps to the middle of the floor and traces a finger along one of her bracelets. “The Grange.” With that, she’s gone.
“There’ll be time,” Daphne says, writing down the last steps in their plan, “there’s not too much to do today. Let’s get started. Draco, read off the notes.”
“Absolutely hectic,” Hari replies. They smirk at each other and continue on their ways, Hari, to his seat, and Blaise back to his mother’s side.
“I’ve done it to almost every teacher I can,” Hari defends, “if I have a free hour during their class time, I sneak in to watch. You’re doing spectacularly, by the way. Even outside this room, I hear wonderful things about you and your teaching. Primarily for the older years, but even the firsties say you’re not as bad as they’d been told to expect.”
Hari’s thoughts wander as he gets ready for bed. Luna Lovegood… sure, their names are somewhat well known, especially Hari’s, but Hermione’s isn’t. And how Luna knew that will be interesting to find out, Hari’s sure.
“It seems to me that Miss Umbridge has gotten her information out of works intended to be taken as fiction, rather than bothering to consult any scientific literature. In fact, it was well known before the mass introduction of muggleborns into wix society that werewolves are perfectly safe human beings at all times other than the night of the full moon, at which point, they should lock themselves away or, in this advanced day and age, take the Wolfsbane Potion.
“Oh, Merlin,” Draco crinkles his nose, “I remember that. I always got grouped with Crabbe and Goyle and they are so
He pats Draco’s arm, “let me up, Dray.” Draco lets go and Hari practically throws himself into Hermione’s arms, stealing her up into a bone-crushing hug.
“Spells,” Draco replies, “It was rumored Salazar Slytherin didn’t own house elves and had instead warded all his possessions against getting dirty.”
“Well, of course I did not make this up!” She gasps as if horribly offended. It’s not difficult to see that she’s actually just angry at being called out. “That book is old knowledge and has since been proven false. Why, just look at the statistics.”
“Sorry to call you away from your preparations,” Hari apologizes and takes a seat in front of them, “but there’s a few things I wanted to talk to you about.”
Draco’s smile could light the entire world. He brings his hand up to gently cradle Hari’s jaw in one hand, after slipping Hari’s glasses off and setting them aside, with the other hand pressing along Hari’s shoulder blade.
“May I join you at the room without a door tomorrow? I should like to have a look inside,” she tells them.
Daphne and Pansy are already holding a booklet and chattering about styles. As Hermione comes out, they’re instructing Mr. Lazwell on what styles and colors to use.
“That’s positively devious,” Draco praises and Hari’s heart swells. Maybe it’s not the best situation, but he’ll handle it, and by the time he’s done, Fudge’ll wish he hadn’t ever had the idea of sending Dementors to Hogwarts.
“Right,” Hermione agrees, “they know you’re the most likely candidate, but because of your age and status as a fellow student, you can’t possibly be Headmaster.”
The final rounds of voting that day go the way Hari had anticipated: Lucius traps the moderate blood-purists into voting for Madam Bones by voting up an extremist. With Hari, the Ministry, and the majority of the Wizengamot moderates voting for her, Madam Bones wins by a landslide.
Hari laughs, “I felt the same way at first, but they both have their uses. Come on,” he leads her towards the apparition point, “Narcissa should be over here.” A few too many people bow as they pass for the walk to be comfortable, but they find Narcissa quickly.
“There will be a Fall Festival Ball before we return to school,” Theo tells them, “My family is hosting this year and we will be sending invitations soon. Shall I tell my father to include Miss Granger on yours?”
“I’m pretty certain she’s a distant cousin of mine,” Draco says, tilting his head to study her retreating form. “I’ll have to go through the genealogy books later, just to check.” Hari nods. They start walking back to the dungeons.
“Oh, nargles got those, too,” Luna reveals calmly. Hari glances at Hermione, who shakes her head slightly, indicating she’d never heard of them. “They don’t like me very much. I’ve yet to see a crumple-horned snorkack yet and I’ve heard they’re kind and I’m sure they’ll like me.”
Finally, they settle in to discuss how formal address and treatment should occur in Hogwarts. It almost turns into a screaming match, but Hari manages to find the middle ground just in the nick of time.
“I’m jealous,” Draco huffs, then holds his arms out. “I know today was hard for you.” Hari lets himself be pulled onto Draco’s lap and cuddled.
“And Hari’s wearing a freaking snake,” Blaise teases. Sure enough, Galeru is draped around Hari’s neck.
“As long as you’re not calling him frivolously, you should be fine.” Hari assures her, “if you miss dinner and don’t want to go hungry, want a book specifically from the Potter library, wake up in the middle of the night and need a drink, or things like that.”
“I understand,” Draco smiles. “Go, be the badass Lord you are. Then come back and promise to show me the memory in a Pensieve later.”
“Technically, but I don’t know if she really feels like she is. I’ll do my best to acclimate her,” Hari promises, “but I know it was hard for me adjusting to the fact that I have all this stuff. What made it easiest for me was that I had to accept it to keep myself and everyone else safe.”
But he comes right back, pressing just a little harder and teasing Hari’s lips with his tongue. Hari parts willingly, allowing Draco’s flavor to flow into him.
“The children’s rooms be having a bedroom, bathroom, sitting area, and play room. The extra family rooms be having a bedroom, bathroom, sitting area, and study.”
Pansy rolls her eyes, “there’s no rule against it. It’s more of a ‘I don’t want everyone to think my child is spoiled’ thing. Even though we are all definitely spoiled and everyone knows it. So, if you summon him, do it out of sight of other students.”
“I almost grabbed the earrings,” Draco admits, “but then remembered you don’t have your ears pierced. So I snagged this instead.”
“Are there any surprises we should be ready for this afternoon?” Blaise teases before they split up.
Hari thinks for a few turns before answering, “it’s you.” He knows he’s blushing, but can’t offer a better answer than that. Draco searches his face intently and Hari struggles not to look away from the piercing gaze.
“Snap is appropriate way to call,” Critter tells him. “Especially with guests.” Hari glances to Draco.
“What?” Hari looks at her confused. “We’ll use all of it. Besides, do you really want to wander Diagon Alley in muggle clothes all the time? We come here a lot.”
Dumbledore’s voice is shaking as he says, “All those in favor of granting the Goblins’ application.” There’s a pause, and his voice comes back stronger. “All those in favor of denying the Goblins’ application.” Another pause, this one longer. “The application has been denied.” His voice sounds cheerful and Master Tomeaxe nods to Hari.
“If you messed up my hair, I will hate you for real,” Draco warns, raising a hand to finger the bangs just touching his eyebrow.
“Makes sense to me,” Draco says and settles into one of the desks that have appeared. The Room has designed a study area for them in a little circle, with all the desks touching corner to corner and facing each other.
“Look at the up side,” Draco mutters, still reading the article, “we have Latin first and you can get away with sleeping.”
“Oh,” she looks incredibly pleased and surprised at the question, “you want to know my name?” Hari studies her, concerned by this statement. “I’m Luna Lovegood,” she bows politely, “it’s good to meet you.”
Hari laughs and takes a bite of food, “honestly,” he says after swallowing, “the whole werewolf thing was planned.”
“If you’ll excuse me,” Hari slips into the chambers and down to his seat. Within a minute, Minister Fudge is at the podium calling for the doors to be sealed.
“I want to make some changes to how things work around here, but I wanted your input first,” Hari says. “The first is that I’d like to remove Argus Filch from the grounds.” He’s not surprised by it, but the elves perk up. “Is that something you would be alright with me doing?”
“Books next,” Blaise decides. Hari checks his list—he’ll be taking Healing, Dueling, Wandlore, Advanced Spellcasting, Arithmancy, and Runes, although he might end up dropping Arithmancy. He never really was one for math.
The Minister rises, “Apologies, Chief Warlock, but I question the wisdom of allowing a thirteen year old child to sit on our esteemed body.”
The Ministry members take up the whole of the right side. Noble houses are in the first row. The next several rows are Ancient and Noble Houses. The fifth and sixth rows are Most Ancient and Noble Houses. There is a small section of eight seats in the center of the sixth row, slightly separated, where the Founding Houses are. At the very top is a secluded area with only four chairs which look more like thrones. They are for the dead lines of Merlin and Arthur.
Lady Zabini sighs, “Miss Umbridge, this is getting tiring. Lord Potter just stated that Fenrir Greyback is a known outlier. Arguing that he is not an outlier based on statistics that include him is foolhardy.”
“As the only other member of his House, you’ll be expected to go to events with him,” Daphne says. “Usually, Houses have dozens of members, so no one has to go to too many events. But the burden falls solely on you and Mr. Black right now.”
“When will you be announcing your intent to try, uh, Oldie Moldie?” Pansy asks and the group blinks at her. “We haven’t given him a subtle nickname yet! And you knew who I was talking about.”
“Very well,” Lord Flint agrees. “We shall put it to a vote.” They take a moment to read over the paperwork Hari has presented, along with Andromeda’s proposed curriculum and plans. The vote passes the class and the hiring of Andromeda Tonks.
“Great,” Hari grins, “The last thing I’d like is permission to create a station in each common room where students can get snacks while studying or at night.”
Much of the room had been reduced to rubble, however, and amongst the destruction stood two figures. The closest of the two was Dumbledore. His hair and beard had been singed, and acrid smoke curled out from beneath his torn robes, but he stood tall and unbent before his enemy.
The journey to the Infirmary didn't take long, and Iana spent most of it in a kind of jumpy silence which Harry had no idea how to break. He tried a little bit of small talk to get her mind off whatever it was that was worrying her so much but in the face of monosyllabic answers he was forced to give up.
"Come here and let me take a look at you," Lily said, beckoning him closer still. She held him still by his shoulders, and seemed to take in everything. "Fiendfyre is a very dangerous spell. How did you manage to extinguish it?" she asked.
When Harry held up the heavy book under his arm by way of explanation, she just looked more suspicious. "There
"Have you heard of something called 'Horcruxes'?" he asked her one afternoon after McGonagall had finally let them escape. The Library was quiet, and the chances of them being overheard were pretty close to zero unless they raised their voices.
"Eww." Ron's face crinkled up in disgust. "No. I'm just saying she looks a right fright first thing. I reckon it's some of that— what was it again? The muggle thing with the micclescopes?"
"No way," he replied. He walked up to stand shoulder to shoulder with her. "We're in this together."
"I'm fine," said Harry. Maybe he wasn't even lying. It was a strange thing, but it seemed Dumbledore's death, and everything that had surrounded it hadn't struck him at quite the same level as finding out about the prophecy, or Voldemort's return.
He hadn't been able to get anything from his parents either, with them both quickly changing the subject, or giving him some minor chore to do in lieu of giving him answers. Sirius had looked pained about the whole thing the few times he'd visited, but even he hadn't said anything.
"Perhaps." Voldemort tapped his wand to his thin, almost non-existent lips. "But you have tried to defy me once already this evening. Remind me, will you, how that served you?"
"Now, it is getting very late indeed, and we have yet to discuss the matters which prompted me to ask for your time."
"Hmm, what?" Harry asked, trying to play it off as nothing important. Neville clearly wasn't buying, though.
With one hand, Harry took Dumbledore's, while he held tight to his father's with the other. A moment later all five of them disappeared in a pillar of flame.
Suddenly, a thought occurred to him. "Hang on, maybe the ghosts can help. Some of them are pretty old right?" He looked around, and found that the Ravenclaw house ghost had stopped and was floating on air.
A little of Iana's nervousness seemed to have receded, but she still didn't look altogether at ease. "Thank you, Mrs. Potter."
"He used a lot of that influence to tie a lot of the old suspected Death Eaters to him personally," James continued. "Claimed they'd all been under Imperius like him, and kept them out of Azkaban. The Minister was well in his pocket, and a lot of the Department Heads too. He got his allies appointed to Hogwarts. Even got some of the classes changed to conform more to his own…
A new, all too familiar voice chose that moment to add to the conversation. "Perhaps if you had stayed in the class, you wouldn't still be such a lamentable excuse for a wizard?"
to pursue it that the first part of it was brought about. If we can keep him from realising that the one in the prophecy is not Iana Malfoy, then it may be that you will never need to concern yourself."
"I think I might have an idea," Lily admitted. Her expression was halfway between a scowl and open wonder. "That impossible, pigheaded, arrogant, brilliant man."
"It's not about the length of the years," said Seamus, grinning. "It's about the"—suddenly he realised that Harry's mum was still present—"um… Maturity?"
He probably had it coming. After all, he'd barely spoken to her at all since Halloween and it was probably only the presence of his friends that had held her back from telling him exactly what she thought about it all. He knew she'd almost certainly guessed some of what happened. She could be frustratingly sharp at times, and combined with her sisterly instinct for knowing exactly how to cause Harry the maximum annoyance, it meant she was rarely far off the mark.
The upshot was that only Dean was heading home, as he always did at Easter. Being born near the beginning of April, his birthday usually fell during the holidays, and his mother was an absolute stickler for him being home for his birthday.
Even as he spoke, a couple of other Elves set about a new task, and ingredients started flying around their heads in dizzying patterns. Harry tore his gaze away from an egg that had only missed his face by a few inches, and tried to reclaim the conversation.
"My arse," said a new voice. All three of them looked up to find Seamus lugging his own trunk into the compartment. "You don't lock yourself in your room for a month when everything is fine."
"You know you don't need to tell me if you don't want to," said Harry. The way she shifted told him it was bothering her, not telling him, but he also didn't want her to feel like it wasn't her choice.
"No!" Iana slammed the book down on the table hard enough that one of the other tomes, a similarly weighty one on the magical flora of the Saharan meadows, fell off and onto the floor. "It is
Despite the illusion of normality, however, deep down Harry knew that it couldn't possibly stay that way. Perhaps that had something to do with what happened on one rainy Thursday in October.
"That's how you survived?" he asked, glad to be moving away from any more personal topics. "What kind of protection?"
If only Colin's camera had survived the first few weeks of his first year. Harry remembered how excited he'd been to finally meet
The last to enter, much to Stump's displeasure, was Iana Malfoy. Unusually, she was unaccompanied by either her two pet gargoyles, or the gaggle of tagalong girls who could usually be found in her vicinity.
It was no secret that Lucius Malfoy's influence had seen Dumbledore increasingly marginalised. Harry had even heard his parents talking about what might happen if he was actually ousted from Hogwarts. "When, then?"
"Sure," said Ron easily. "I'll send them a letter tomorrow. Neville would have to give me what for if I broke curfew to send it now."
"Stop bloody following me around like a lost puppy, Potter!" she hissed, far closer to his face than he'd really prefer. It wasn't a big alcove. "It's making me jumpy!"
"If it's all very well with you, I'd rather not be the reason they end up getting wrapped up in all this," said Harry.
Effie withdrew the shoe which had probably left a reasonable indentation on Dean's shin. "It's Effie," she said with a menacing glare.
Draco met up with Harry in the hall on their way to Kingsley and Harry shoved a lidded Styrofoam bowl of soup into his hands. The heat of it felt good on his skin. They continued down the hall, but a few paces before they reached Kingsley's office, Draco paused abruptly. Harry looked over his shoulder at him.
“I uh ...” he sighed. “Alright. I’ll go. But please... let me know if you need anything. I’ll be just outside the door.” Draco lingered for a moment, his brow furrowing as more harsh coughs took over Harry’s body. He walked hesitantly out of the room, shutting the door behind him.
Potter unconsciously licked his finger to get a better grip on the page he was turning, a Draco realized that he'd been staring again. Potter looked so engrossed in the paperwork, Draco was sure that Potter wouldn't notice if he closed his eyes for a moment. Resting his head on a propped up elbow and listening to the familiar calming sound of Potter's quill, Draco nodded off.
It was as if the universe itself heard his plea. The words barely left his mouth when the heard the clamor of people running down the hall. “Harry! Malfoy?” Draco recognized Ron Weasley's voice.
About an hour later, he was ushering Teddy back into a freshly made bed. It took a while, but he was finally able to lower the boy’s fever with the cool water. After offering Teddy a sip of juice and tucking him back in bed, Harry decided that crawling in with him for a moment wouldn’t hurt. He laid there for a few moments, listening to Teddy’s breathing even out, and for a moment he felt himself drifting as well. That is until he felt his wards shift and heard a knock at the front door.
‘Oh Harry,’ Draco thought, ‘you are just the absolute best.’ He was constantly grateful for his husband. It was moments like this that reminded him how glad he was that he and Harry had grown up to realize that their childhood feuding had more to do with attraction than hatred. He and Harry had gotten together after the war when they had both been named best men at Pansy and Ginny’s wedding. Harry suggested that they make a pact to put aside their differences during the wedding planning process, and Draco took him up on it.
“I did what!” Harry sat up, clearly shocked. Unfortunately for him, he sat up far too quickly for someone who had been laying in a hospital bed for days. He immediately got dizzy and held a hand to his head to stabilize himself.
“Of course!” Harry grabbed his wand and touched it to the rim of a goblet from Draco's bag, filling it quickly. He waited patiently for Draco to pull himself up to a sitting position, which seemed to take a lot out of him, and then held the glass to his lips. Draco took a few sips before settling back down on their makeshift bed.
This, of course, irked Draco to his very core. Anyone who had the slightest bit of potions knowledge would know that freshly brewed potions don’t floo well. They get shaken up too much and it makes them less effective, but having to walk 6 blocks to the nearest apparition point was a major inconvenience for Draco’s customers. For months now Draco had been applying to get an apparition point put into his shop, but he still hadn’t heard back from the ministry. Hermione had assured him that the delay in response had nothing to do with his last name, but he still wasn’t sure.
“Of course, Har.” Draco said, squinting at him. Was it his imagination or was his husband looking a bit peaky? “Did you take the echinacea potion yet?”
He really wanted to try and keep his mother from getting exposed. Pansy was off traveling with Ginny and the Harpies, Blaise was already helping him over at the apothecary. Draco doubted that Ron or Hermione would be available. They would probably both be at work at the ministry, but Draco was getting desperate. Harry’s fever was reading in at 103.6, so it was worth a try. Placing Scorpius back in his crib, Draco paced back into the bedroom, glancing at Harry who was shivering despite the heat his body was generating.
“No, no we just agreed that it would be better to both stay home with the kids, in case anyone gets any worse. Fleur’s kids had this last week and she was warning us that it comes on rather quickly.”
They ate in silence for a while, occasionally hearing some coughing coming from Teddy’s bedroom upstairs. Harry was really not interested in eating anything. His stomach had settled for the time being, and he could only pray it would stay that way. No, his problem at the moment was the tickle in his throat, which was growing more persistent with each bite. He took a sip of wine, willing it to go away. He felt the wine burn down his throat as he swallowed, leaving him no choice but to give in.
Following the war, the Daily Prophet wrote an exclusive on all that Lucius Malfoy had done to his family. Draco had sold the story to them himself. All he had wanted was for him and his mother to have a fair chance at life after his father was finally behind bars. It had taken months of Auror questioning under veritaserum for Draco and his mother to finally be acquitted. They were both ordered to seek out Mind Healers after that, which Draco did, but it took even longer for him to realize the implications the curse had on his health. The specialist at St. Mungo's assured him that with proper food and exercise, his immune system would eventually recover. She'd advised adopting a low-stress lifestyle, but at that point, he was too far in Auror training to turn back. Draco wanted so badly to prove to the public that he could play the hero just as well as anyone who'd fought for the Light side in the war. He was sick and tired of being seen as the villain, or as the victim. And when he and Harry had defied all expectations and had actually become friends, Draco knew he'd never be able to quit his job. Not as long as Harry was his partner.
“Is that so?” Draco asked taking a few steps closer to Harry. Suddenly Harry felt a tickle in his throat. He turned abruptly back the stove, swallowing hard.
“Is there any possibility that either you or Mr. Potter frequented The Rainy Bell Tavern in London within the last two weeks?”
“You still look tired.” Draco noticed. “Why don’t you go finish your nap in our bed? I will stay with Teddy”.
“Patient B is still clocking in at a temperature of 39.8 though. He's burning through the fever-reducing potion.”
Business at his store always picked up around this time of year, but it seemed that more people were catching the flu this year than Draco remembered in flu seasons past. Mothers had been steadily coming in and out all week, buying Pepperup potion and other potions for their sick children at home. Draco was glad to help them, of course. But on a damp, dreary November day like today, he wanted nothing more than to go home, curl up with his family, and enjoy a nice warm cup of tea.
Draco reached out and squeezed the back of Harry's hand hard to ground him. “Well, Toto, I don't think we're in Britain anymore,” Draco smiled sheepishly, hoping the muggle film reference would diffuse some of his partner's anxiety. It didn't seem to help.
“Papa, don’t get up,” Teddy yelled, but Harry’s brain processed this request too late. He wrenched himself out of bed, wobbling to the fireplace. His muscles ached, but he had to get the boys warm. He had be useful.
His cousin Dudley had become ill earlier in the week and had been carelessly spreading his germs around the house. He had spent his every waking moment that week complaining about his ailments. Aunt Petunia sent Uncle Vernon out several times to buy cough syrup, and popsicles and presents to make their son feel better. She’d made him chicken soup and let him watch all the television he wanted.
“Classic,” Draco scowled at him, “still putting everyone before yourself, even as we’re sat the bloody hospital.” Now that the worst of it was over for Harry, Draco could feel his frustration bubbling up to the surface.
Draco frowned. Harry got sick so fast, which made Draco anxious. If it weren't for him and his useless immune system, Harry wouldn't have even gotten sick like this in the first place. He was angry at himself, at his body. He was angry at Harry's good for nothing relatives.
Harry had only a moment to process what Teddy said before he was doubled over, getting sick in the bin next to the bed.
Draco realized dejectedly that he should have taken his conversation with his mother more seriously. Sighing gently, he looked at his oldest son’s glassy eyes. “Everyone’s going be fine, we all just need some rest.”
It was Hermione's voice this time, and she suddenly appeared on the other side of the bars, along with Ron and a team of 4 other Aurors. Pansy was there as well, and Draco had no doubt she used her status as an unspeakable to persuade them to let her come on the rescue mission.
“Here!” He yelled back. “Weasley, we're here!” His yelling caused a coughing fit of his own, and Harry climbed away from him to give him room to catch his breath.
“Teddy was sick, and you were working. And then your mother came by and handed off Scorpius after he started showing symptoms.”
“Hey. Papa told me you weren’t feeling well.” Teddy just blinked sleepily up at him, so Draco continued. “I need you to take a couple sips of water. Can you do that for me?”
As expected, soon enough both men felt the tell-tale curling heat at the base of their spines, getting closer and closer to toppling over that edge. "Draco pl-please, god I'm so close, please let me come," Harry begged, burying his face into the material of the sofa cushions.
Luckily, a bit of normality waltzed back into Draco's life as the door slid open. Blaise and Pansy scanned the compartment, small smiles on both of their faces.
"Really? I feel quite peachy," Draco replied, earning himself a half-assed slap against his ribs. Out of the many things that Harry had learnt about his boyfriend, or at least committed to memory about him, this was the thing that truly pissed him off.
Draco let out a proper laugh at that, even leaning forward to rest his forehead against Harry's shoulder, who was now laughing as well. "Okay, so maybe I shouldn't have said it quite like that, but the point still stands. If you're stressed or riled up, you could always take it out on me. I don't mind."
It wasn't long before Draco was sliding his fingers out of Harry and reaching for the lube. knowing that his husband liked the sting of being slightly unprepared. He undid his neatly pressed trousers, the power imbalance of him being fully dressed whilst Harry was naked only just hitting him, and finally released his strained erection from his tight pants. Both men groaned as Draco pushed himself into his husband, not taking a break until his trousers brushed against Harry's bare arse.
Softly, Harry lowered his head to kiss along the material covering Draco's length, pulling even more gasps from the taller.
"Not currently, no. I have to return some books to the library and mail a letter to mother, but I suppose that can wait. What's up?" Draco replied, a small frown settling between his eyebrows.
"You love it, though," Harry replied, momentarily pausing his game (of trying to do what, Draco wasn't quite sure) to plant a soft kiss against Draco's cheek. The blonde only huffed, turning back towards the window so that nobody could see the smile on his face.
Everyone asked Harry why he came back, usually when he was running late to something, but he could never quite give them a proper answer. He wasn't even sure he knew, himself. Ron had gone straight into auror training and Hermione had gotten into Cambridge (obviously), so it wasn't to follow his friends. They had rooms apart from the rest of their house, and weren't allowed in the common room until the New Year, so it wasn't because he missed being around people. Ginny had broken up with him during the summer, so it wasn't because of her. There were so many memories and too much hurt between the castle walls, but he wasn't quite sure he felt
Draco's thoughts stuttered as he felt his boyfriend wrap his lips around his length, looking up at him through his lashes, ridiculous smirk tugging at his lips. He swirled his tongue around the tip, lapping back and forth over his slit, hands splayed across his thighs to keep him still.
It really wasn't that big of a thing, at least not to anyone else, and it wasn't the actual words that had Harry's mind racing. It was the fact that he couldn't quite imagine himself saying them back.
Embarrassingly, at least to Draco, it only took a few seconds of feeling himself hit the back of Harry's throat as the boy swirled his tongue around his length, before he was releasing into his mouth, fingers curling even tighter in his hair.
Harry pushed open the right door, not bothering to kick it shut before wrapping his arms around Draco from behind, peppering kisses along the side of his neck. The blonde sighed, tracing his fingers over Harry's hands on his stomach.
Once he was sure they were gone, Harry flung the door open, head whipping to the opposite direction that they had turned. "Draco, it's all good," he whispered, smiling as he watched the blonde come out from his hiding place. He immediately received a slap on his forearm, letting his boyfriend in and slamming the door, again.
Harry only nodded, right hand wrapped around his quill just a bit too tightly. He let out a squeak as he felt the toy suddenly pick up a light rhythm, sending immediate shockwaves up his spine as he bit back a whine.
"Can't believe you've been here," Harry muttered, cutting himself off as he placed a kiss under the blonde's jawline. "All of five minutes." Another kiss, to his neck, Harry now working to unbutton Draco's trousers. "And I already wanna fucking ruin you," he whispered, finally managing to pull his trousers trousers down to his thighs.
"You wanker. You said they'd be gone by three! It's nearly four, my legs hurt from crouching in that corner."
"Fuck me, didn't realise there was a sign on the door that said queers only," Zabini exclaimed, smiling at his own joke.
Harry frowned gently at the emptiness, watching Draco as he helped him straighten out his clothes. "Where'd it go?" Draco couldn't help but laugh, spinning Harry's chair again and leaning against his desk.
Whatever was playing behind Draco's eyes suddenly darkened, the blonde straightening his back and rolling his shoulders.
He didn't get to voice his concern, though, as Harry had soon attached his lips to his own. Coming to the conclusion that maybe their separate days had had a more
It had all started last night. They were laid in bed together basking in the general afterglow of sex, Draco massaging the marks on Harry's wrists and whispering sweet words against his hair, when the words had just tumbled out of Harry's mouth. He'd thought that he'd just been thinking about it, but Draco's face had told him that he'd actually said them out loud.
"Good," was his boyfriend's response, who only dropped his head and continued with his work. However, his free hand under the table must've been holding his wand because, suddenly, the vibrations inside Harry increased at least three levels.
Harry gasped, finally letting go of the heat in his stomach as he came in hot spurts against his stomach and crumpled robes. Draco finally let go of his balls and lifted himself from the floor, standing between Harry's thighs and looking down at him. He looked positively fucked out, eyes blown wide and chest rapidly rising and falling. Occasionally, his body jolted and pulled a whimper of oversensitivity from him, reminding Draco that he still had the toy inside him, and that it was on.
grateful for your generosity, what brought this on?" He asked, after a few seconds of just enjoying the closeness.
Draco only smiled and nodded, taking Harry's hand in his own. "Good. I'm going to sleep, wake me up when we're at Kings Cross."
To his disappointment, Draco pulled away and released his grip on his chin, letting his head fall forward. He eyed his watch and nodded, bending until his lips were in line with Harry's ear.
Said male only held up his hands, catching his husband's stern glare, as he walked over to the window, cracking it just enough to exhale through. Harry smiled, softly, settling next to Remus on the sofa.
Draco laughed softly, although not quite happily, and took Harry's hands off of his arms, cradling them softly in his own and placing a soft kiss on each of his palms. "Hmm, what could I do instead?"
He simply nodded, running one of his thumbs over the smooth skin of the boy's cheek, pushing his glasses back up to the bridge of his nose. Softly, he placed a kiss against Harry's lips, lingering for just a moment, before pulling back an inch.
"Oh, love, shit, I'm sorry. I completely forgot I said I was staying tonight, I ended up having a really fucking stressful day and before I knew it I was walking home. Did I wake you up?" Draco whispered, smiling as Harry crossed the room and stepped into his space.
When he'd finally set foot back in the castle, everything had felt weird. Don't get it twisted, it had felt weird on the train, but he'd sat with Ginny and they'd chatted like they usually did. He'd sat at the Gryffindor table, watched the sorting ceremony, indulged in too much food. There was an odd air of normality, to the whole situation.
There seemed to be a moment of silence, followed by a reluctant sigh, before there was a soft knock against Harry's door.
The other three males couldn't help but agree, watching as Harry quickly pulled out four tumblers and a bottle of firewhiskey, that his guardians thought they'd hidden well, and carried them over to the table.
Harry had known, since he was fourteen, that he was interested in both sexes. That had been 100% confirmed the first time Cedric spoke to him, the younger boy barely being able to have a complete conversation with him without imagining kissing his face off. It probably took him another year to realise that, maybe (definitely), his schoolboy
Everything was so calm around the group that it was odd to remember the reason they were all in this situation, but nobody seemed to be complaining. Harry was just quietly enjoying himself, absentmindedly sipping his beer as he felt the comfort of drowsiness creeping through his body, fully settling into his position against his boyfriend's shoulder. Remus was sat slightly slumped over, legs resting over his husband's lap, and seemed to also be enjoying himself, even though he was probably just past tipsy. Sirius and Draco, who seemed to be equal levels of
them. Maybe that was what he needed to do, just definitely in a different way to how he showed his friends that he loved them.
After kicking them under his own bed, and dropping his robes onto his mattress, Draco soon returned to Harry, curling up into his side more comfortably. He stared up at him, liking the faint sense of a smile that played on his lips.
Sirius continued laughing as he got up and stumbled towards his jacket, swaying slightly, to pull out his box of cigarettes. He quickly re-joined the little party, plopping next to his husband on the floor and slotting a cigarette between his teeth.
Draco pounced at that, capturing Harry's lips with his own as he slid another finger into him, swallowing his husband's moans as he scissored the two digits inside of him. "If you're sure, love," he whispered, pulling away slightly and using his free hand to bend Harry further over the back of the sofa.
the war, but they'd only increased since his father's trial. Add on the whispers and the mothers pulling their children just
As Harry lowered his head even more, not stopping until his nose was flush with the blonde's groin, Draco couldn't suppress the honest-to-god moan that left his lips.
"Watch the time. I want you to come as soon as it hits the hour and not a moment before, understood?"
It was fine at first. Harry was able to continue working, becoming used to the soft vibrations against his skin, as his cock fully hardened. For the first time that morning, he'd been able to look at the clock and notice that a chunk of time had actually passed.
When he let his eyes scan over the boy's face, and the rest of the room, he came to the conclusion that he must've slept with his glasses on. He soon also realised that he'd fallen asleep fully clothed, staring down at himself to see his t-shirt rumpled and riding up his stomach. He let out another groan, running his hands over his face as Draco ran his own hands up his arms, chuckling quietly.
"Is this really how we're starting sex?" Harry rolled his eyes and nodded, urging Draco to talk about his day. Once he realised that his husband was being serious, Draco relaxed into Harry's touch and started talking about his day. "Everything just felt so out of control. Half of my Gryffindors were hungover this morning, some of my first years made their cauldrons explode and then I ended up in the bloody commemoration hallway, by accident. They still all have a lot of things to say about my decisions," he sighed, letting go of everything that had been on his mind all day.
to process his boyfriend's words, the blonde was turning on his heels and closing the door behind him. He hurried down the stairs, flushing slightly as the eyes of the Gryffindor common room followed him to the portrait hole, but he was used to it by now.
As much as Draco wanted to complain about his new friends, he just really couldn't. The war definitely taught him to listen more, to think before forming an opinion, and to not do things just because they made other people happy. Them returning had also, undoubtedly, increased the level of inter-house communication, something McGonagall commented on constantly.
These noises, however, seemed to have a downfall. Specifically, for this moment. Harry was so caught up in the irregular whimpers falling from his boyfriend's lips, that he didn't hear the faint sound of a door clicking open and shut.
"Babe, it's literally just gone seven. I'm not that old. You could join me for the movie I was just about to start, though, if you're really stressed." Draco nodded, non-committedly, and slid his robes off of his shoulders, toeing his shoes off and onto their rack by the door. He didn't feel like he could sit down yet. There was so much
He quickly switched his drink to the hand that was wrapped around Harry's shoulders, inhaling again before dropping his left hand to rest against his own thigh.
Harry went to mutter a smart response when he stopped himself at the sound of hurried feet, a door slamming shut, and someone vomiting into a toilet.
It came out as more of a whisper than he wanted, but he could tell by Remus' face that Sirius had heard him, the brunette giving him a soft smile and nod, murmuring something about him getting Harry to bed.
They slid into two of the kitchen table chairs, both being immediately handed steaming mugs of coffee, Harry being able to smell the cinnamon that had been stirred into his. He sent a grateful smile to the adult sat across from him, for once relishing in the fact that Remus had had to deal with one too many of his hangovers, knowing what fixed him almost instantly.
"Harry, come on, unlock the door. Let's talk, just talking. I'll even lock Sirius outside if you want me to," Remus called through the door, presumably leaning his side against it.
They spent the next few hours getting far too drunk for their own good, giggles constantly filling the room around them as they all processed what Sirius had just said.
"Okay, fuck, okay. Let's not jump to conclusions, I don't know what he saw," Harry rambled, mainly to himself, pacing in front of his door and frantically tugging his hands through his hair. Draco was hurriedly tucking himself back into his jeans, trying to get his breathing back to normal.
Harry only nodded, obviously finding his own feet much more interesting than this conversation, as he let his eyes drop.
Draco simply scoffed at Harry's begging, twirling his wand between his fingers in an oddly menacing motion. "What do you want, Harry? You promised me you could last an hour. It's only been." He checked the slim watch around his wrist. "Forty-seven minutes."
"Pass one here," Draco exclaimed, locking eyes with his cousin, who only smirked and nodded, throwing the packet into his lap. The blonde slotted one between his teeth and lit it, in the same way Sirius always did, with a snap of his fingers.
"Hey," Harry whispered, squeezing his knee, gently. "You're thinking too much. I don't know what about, but you're doing too much of it, relax. It's Christmas!"
He was cut off with another one of his boyfriend's soft kisses, who only shook his head as he traced his thumb across Harry's tanned cheek. The boy nuzzled into the feeling, letting his eyes close as he prepared for the inevitable disappointment that was to follow.
Draco threw him an equally dopey smile as he worked carefully to release his wrists, stopping to place a soft kiss against the pale skin that covered his veins. "Thank you, love, I feel a lot better now," he whispered, wrapping himself around Harry. His husband smiled against his shirt, sighing at the feeling of Draco placing a kiss against his hair.
Harry felt like he was staring at the sun when he opened his eyes, even though he'd only managed to prise his lids open less than half a centimetre. He could make out, with surprising clarity, Draco in front of him, sleepy smile across his face.
If you'd have brought up this situation to Draco six months ago, he probably would've punched you square in the jaw, but now it simply brought a reluctant smile to his face. Harry was tucked next to him, one hand on his knee and the other throwing Bertie Botts at Seamus, who was passed out against Dean's shoulder. Ginny and Luna were sat closer to the door, talking animatedly about nothing in particular.
Draco's grip on his hips tightened and his pace quickened, something that Harry didn't think was possible, before he managed a response. "You're going to wait for me to come inside you, and then it's your turn. Understand?"
He ran the last few metres of the corridor, coming to a halt in front of the boy, who seemed to have also stopped as he noticed his boyfriend. "Hello, darling," Draco whispered, snaking an arm around Harry's waist and placing a soft kiss against his cheek.
Harry twisted his head, the slight contortion of his back making Draco's finger brush his prostate, and locked eyes with the blonde.
Draco hummed in soft agreement, wrapping his arms around Harry's waist and pulling him flush against his body. "I can get on board with that idea. What did you have in mind?"
Draco simply nodded, ducking his head again. He didn't take Harry in his mouth this time, oh no. Instead, one of his hands came up to roll his balls between his fingers as Draco kissed all along Harry's thighs, sucking deep purple bruises against the skin.
All he got was a hum in response, Harry continuing to kiss down Draco's neck, sucking a small bruise onto the skin where his neck met his shoulder. Draco shuddered, his breathing picking up, before twisting in his boyfriend's arms, pulling him into a desperate kiss. Harry's kisses were gorgeous, switching from sweet to bruising in an instant, and sometimes Draco felt like he could survive on them, alone.
