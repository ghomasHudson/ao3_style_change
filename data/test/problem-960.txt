“It was wise of you to both keep it hidden and activate it when you did so. Any longer and you would have been past the point of being able to be healed.”
Harry and Sirius cried out together.
“What?” Harry echoed weakly. Draco turned to Harry and his eyes began to shine even brighter.
“I see,” Severus said, not seeing at all. “What efforts have been made to find the boy?”
“You still haven’t chosen a colour yet, Dad.”
“Dumbledore isn’t abusing me!”
“Six people have breached the gate and are on their way here. They are too close now for me to raise the Malfoy wards,” Lucius informed the room as he rose from the table. “Narcissa inform the Dark Lord what is happing then Ward yourself and the children in the ritual room. You should be able to cast some dark spells to help without being detected.”
“Please Professor, can he stay, please? Just for the night?” Harry asked shakily.
“Don’t worry about it, we’ll chalk this one up as a learning mistake. Merlin knows I fucking made a gallon of them when I first started to live with your dad. Your Granddad had to pull me aside and have a talk. Cause just like you Pup, I came from a fucked-up family and I didn’t know what was normal. I’m going to return the favour, although I’m afraid I ain’t half as good as your Granddad was. I’m sorry you’re stuck with my bollocks up head to guide you but there is fucking nothing we can do to change things. Despite how much I fucking wish there was.”
Of course, had they captured the actual moment Lucius reunited with Narcissa, they would have been in for a surprise. There was no well breed housewife embracing her husband with the hint of tears in her eyes there. Instead, it had been an all but feral creature who had been driven out of her mind with worry. After snarling everyone out of the room Narcissa had dived on him desperate to re-establish her claim and convince herself that he was really here back in her arms.
“You all know that the Triwizard tournament ended on a tragic note. The ministry and probably even your parents would not want me to tell you the truth of what happened. But I believe that you are all old enough to know. Last night the two Hogwarts champions were stolen away at the moment of their victory. Cedric was senselessly murdered and Harry was forced to participate in a Dark ritual that brought Voldemort back to life.”
Harry felt the slap of ice-cold rejection. This was something that was so hard for him to do, and he had gathered up his shaky courage, pushing himself to work through it. Only to have it backfire on him majorly. His breath came out in pants and his body trembled. Shock was protecting him from the negative emotions, but it was a flimsy wall that would hold up for long. He had once again fucked thing up. Here was more proof that he couldn’t do anything right. He had been trying to make Sirius feel better, but going by the horrified expression he had made things so much worse. The hot prickling sensation of tears began to build and Harry scrambled from the bed, not want Sirius to see his blubbering away.
Tom knew it would shock the public of just how many children Dumbledore had sent back to their abusers. He had a feeling it would be more than just him, Severus and Harry.
“What age do you have to be before you can um drink Firewhiskey?” Harry asked.
Voldemort stepped up to him and reached out. Harry threw himself against the bonds but they held firm and all he had managed to do was reinjure himself. Closing his eyes bracing himself for unimaginable pain Harry prepared to join his parents. His eyes popped open again when he felt cool fingers touch his hand. He looked down to see Voldemort had circled his wrist with his fingers, thumb reaching all the way to the second knuckle. Shame burst through him at the proof of how scrawny he was. Voldemort let go and stepped back regarding him with introspection.
Harry paused, he had both Sirius talk and Severus’ multiple lectures running through his head but even with them he couldn’t see how he could get out of this. The threat of Vernon was an all the real one that could be applied at any time.
“Close your eyes,” Draco said. Harry did and a moment later he felt Draco running his hand through his hair. That sensation along with the warmth of Draco pressed up against his back made Harry relax completely. His brain stopped screaming at him and everything went blissfully quiet.
“Hmm?”
Harry managed to avoid them for over an hour but then his luck ran out. One of Dudley's gang spotted him and the chase was on. Now if had just been Dudley then Harry would have been able to outrun him with no issues, but Dudley had gotten the bright idea to have some people in his gang whose sole purpose was to run whoever Dudley decide to terrorize to ground. Harry while he was fast didn’t have much stamina due to his poor eating habits.
“I murder them and many other parents and committed multiple crimes and atrocities. I will not excuse my action or try and wiggle out of accepting responsibility. I was running a war and I can assure you that both sides committed terrible sins”
“That was extremely well-done Draco, I had not thought of a tent myself. I’m sure this will help Harry immensely.”
“My loyalty to the Light is no more,” Severus told him exhaustedly. “They are nothing but hypocrites and liars. They allow children to be sent back to their abusers and they worship the Potters, who are nothing more than a bully and a rapist.”
Harry would normally come out about an hour later and Severus would spend the next few hours hand feeding his son. Whose attention span was worse than a gnat’s every gust of breeze or slightest movement from an insect distracted Harry. It had surprised Severus how patience he was as he would gently coax Harry to continue to eat.
“Unfortunately, all tracking charms we had on him are no longer working. I can say with confidence that he is still alive, but beyond that, I can only guess.” Dumbledore frown and stroke his beard as he thought. “It is imperative for the War effort that we get Harry back alive as soon as possible.”
So it wasn’t the amount, and Harry admitted to himself, that by the time came for his next little bowl of food his stomach was empty and ready for it. But his mind was struggling with it. Which would result in Harry even though he was feeling a bit hungry refusing to eat the food. He had gotten away with it for the first two days before Narcissa had caught on. She, in turn, had said something to Draco who had stopped allowing Harry to not eat and instead had spent the whole of yesterday figuring out different ways to coaxed Harry into eating. Harry had a feeling that Draco was going to be the same today.
Severus paced agitated around the office Tom had claimed for his own.
“You can’t just ask him that!” Hermione said. “It doesn’t work that way, if he has it he could not realise it or they might have condition him to not tell us.”
“What’s that?”
By the time he walked out of the office, Severus’ lips were throbbing with the amount of attention they had received and his hair was completely mused. He walked absentminded back to his room and collapsed on his bed. His worry for Harry had not gone away, but now he had something pleasant to dwell on before he fell asleep.
Harry woke up with tears drying on his face. He hated being here it was a horrible prison without people calling it that. The only benefit was that he got to spend so much time with Sirius. His beloved Godfather, who completely understood and feel the same way about this house. They were both prisoners’ here. But Sirius had done what he could to make it better for Harry. He had stridden into the room Harry was sharing with Ron and gathered all of Harry's things, then frostily informed a previously whinging Ron that Harry would share with him. This way, as they both had nightmares, they would disturb no one else precious beauty sleep. Ron had made a half-hearted apology, but as he had just been complaining about that exact thing, Harry tuned him out and followed his godfather. The two of them continually sort out each other company.
He was the Hero of the wizarding world. The boy-who-lived. He couldn’t afford to be weak. Hero’s didn’t hide under blankets. They didn’t curl up and cry when things didn’t go their way. He needed to stop this feeling sorry for himself this instant. Harry told himself to straighten up and stop sniffling.
Dumbledore pushed open the doors and strode to Harry’s bedside when Madam Pomfrey tried to say he wasn’t ready for visitors Dumbledore brushed her off
But Harry couldn’t force his limbs to move all he managed was a slight rocking motion. He hurled more insults and demands at himself but nothing he said made any difference.
Afterwards, He scurried to the bathroom gulped down as much water as he could then went to the toilet. Dudley locked him back in afterwards but that suited Harry just fine.
Once he got close enough, he could hear Harry snarling wordlessly with Sirius' bass rumble joining in. Draco drew to a stop in front of Harry. He could see his mate’s eyes were still clouded with sleep and whatever nightmare forced him out here. Even more alarming was the sight of Harry's magic starting to manifest, wisps of blackness were curling off Harry's shoulders and hair, but as Draco watch the whips were getting longer and thicker. He knew he needed to snap Harry out of his current mindset. Something that was not easily done as most common methods tended to trigger Harry and bring on the onset of full Obscurus quicker rather than stopping it.
“If the Dark Lord was really back, someone here would have known about it. I think you’re full of shite old man.”
Instead, it seemed it was his other luck in play, the sort that allowed a clueless First-year walk away unharmed from an encounter with a mountain troll. Voldemort had told him to raise his occlumency shields then with a supportive hand on his shoulder had informed him that Harry was his son. They couldn’t be more closely connected if they tried.
“Shhh, it's alright, you did really well,” Draco replied equally soft. He put his empty plate onto the bedside table then whispered. “Scoot forward.” Harry did as asked and Draco climbing in behind him. He then guided Harry back so that he was resting against Draco's chest. His wings were opened and spread out either side of them.
“Did you know her before you guys went to Hogwarts?”
He could hear Sirius whimpering quietly next to him, rolling over he studied Sirius face. It was mostly slack with sleep, but there was still a frown line over his eyes and his mouth flickered into a grimace now and then. Harry felt sadness swirl within him. He loved his Godfather and wanted to help make him feel a little better. But he still didn’t have that good a grasp on what would work. He inched closer, thinking that maybe some sort of touch. Draco and Severus had been working on convincing him that touch from a loved one can be extremely nice. And the few hugs and the times Sirius wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulders seemed to back this claim.
Their favourite spot to hide was on top of the roof. No one thought to look for them here. Why would they only crazy people would hang out on a snow-covered pitched roof in all weather. But then everyone seemed to forget that both Sirius and Harry had been accused of being crazy on multiple occasions. The roof wasn’t as bad as people would think. Sirius put warming charms on their clothes and had a totally cool sticking spell that let their shoes cling to the roof, and yet they could still walk around. And neither one of them had any issues with height. Sometimes Harry would straddle the root cap and lean into the chilly wind blowing in his face. He would pretend that he was on his broom and flying through a snow stormed quidditch game. Sirius had thrown his head back laughing delighted when Harry explained what he was doing. He then copied Harry facing him, and the two of them pretended they were flying on the opposite team. They would throw their torso wildly from one side to another, trying to dodge their opponent's attack. Now and then one or the other would throw themselves too hard and they would begin to slide down the side of the roof. Thankfully Sirius’ shoe sticking spell worked great, and they never fell over three feet or so.
Harry squirmed “Um yes?”
When Dumbledore proclaimed Voldemort was alive once more, he was telling a lie. There was no Voldemort, not anymore, just Tom Riddle. Who finally become wise enough to accept his name and his heritage. Both the glorious and the mundane. He would do what he originally set out to do, change the ministry for the betterment of all magical kinds.
Dumbledore shook his head gravely and raised his hand to placate the crowd. “I’m afraid there has been a terrible misunderstanding.” But the crowd was muttering sourly to each other, not listening to him. The mood become ugly and Dumbledore was no fool. He could sense the crowd turning on him. He went to apparate away which would have been a sensible choice had this pub not had an anti apparation charm as part of its warding. As it was, this act snapped the crowds restrain, and they pelted him with spellfire, some of which were restraining others to disable and stop him from fleeing.
Glasses were raised and the cry of ‘Friendship’ and ‘Cedric’ echoed around.
“He is in his own world. I noticed he is interacting with his surrounding a lot better than he has been when he is not currently present.”
“I’m not abused, I don’t know why you think I am.”
“You’re still holding my hand?” He stupidly said.
“Both my despicable behaviour towards your person while you were a student under my care and my hubris leading me to see your father in your stead. Such failure led me to miss the signs of your abuse which left you to suffer for longer.”
“Yes, Severus?”
“Pawn? Surely that’s not correct.” Minerva said.
Whilst waiting for his son, Severus would end up gathering potion ingredients. He was surprised to find such a wide variety growing here. Severus had only been here for ten minutes when the tent flap opened and Harry stumbled out. Severus turned to him, concerned with this sudden change in routine.
Draco now knew enough that Harry had to eat his entire bowl of food. And only once he was done would he be allowed to eat sweets. Which in Harry case meant fruit. Even so, Draco was careful to only offer him a small amount. He didn’t want to overload Harry’s stomach and ruin all the good work they had just done. Unlike other teenagers, Harry could not afford to fill up on junk food and not eat his normal meal. Draco for the first time in his life was restricting his diet to keep Harry company. This would be the first summer where he did not spend days on random occasions gorge himself on products from Honey dukes and even after the anti-nausea potion not having any room left for his dinner.
Caved stomach
Dudley grabbed Harry’s hair and pulled him over to where he was waiting. His pants were already dropped, and he had been stroking himself while he watched. He forced Harry onto him. They had only just gotten started when Vernon, who had come home early, burst through the door.
“It was a pleasure having you work as our colleague and I hope life outside of Hogwarts treats you well.” Severus stood as the rest of them got up and allowed each of them to embrace him. He stiffly patted their backs and was pleased that none of them drew it out. As he was exiting the door Minerva called out.
“Are you staying for dinner, Blaise?” Draco asked once he reached Harry, running his hands through Harry’s hair.
His mother had then said that as Harry wasn’t interested in sexual activity neither was Draco. She had then held his hand and said there was a chance that Harry might never be interested. Draco struggled to understand her concern. He knew logically that had he been told this a few days ago he would have been devastated at the thought of not ever feeling sexual arousal again. But that was before Harry become his mate. He couldn’t explain it, the words just would come to him to properly describe how having Harry in his life and the gift of Harry’s submission was worth so much more than sex. It was such a non-issue with him now that he would be completely fine for Harry and him to carry on the way they were for the rest of their lives.
It was interesting watching the two of them together, Blaise thought a couple of hours later. He had fooled around with Draco for a short time last year but had found him to be far too intense for his taste. What Draco wanted out of a relationship and what Blaise wanted were two completely different things. Using the skills, he had learnt from his mother Blaise broke off the relationship in such a way that they got to keep their friendship.
“You may, I may choose not to answer but I won’t lie nor will I mislead you with half-truths.”
“I’ve got you, Harry, I won’t let you go.”
Harry let out a happy sigh. He could feel his mind beginning to wander again and didn’t stop it. Severus and Narcissa as a Dark healer said it was both completely normal and acceptable for his mind to be fully present one moment then off with the pixies the next. The more he healed, the less it would happen. Severus had also told him there was only one other documented Obscurial that survived to return to a human, they didn’t know if Harry’s mind would recover completely or if he would spend the of his life with his mind occasional going elsewhere. They just didn’t know one way or the other. But they planned to take it one day at a time not worry about the future. Since both Severus and Draco had assured him it didn’t make one ounce of a difference to them, Harry was content to let it go.
“Given the information, we have on hand, do you really think the memory is not going to be traumatic?” He asked gently. Severus flushed slightly and looked away. Tom allowed him to gather his composer and went back to his paperwork. A short time later Severus stood and stiffy asked
“You’re mine.” He purred out happily.
“I have time now if you so desire otherwise, I can schedule it in for another day?” He said.
“What happened?”
Harry managed to nod his head and with an angry huff Vernon turned and lumbered back to his bedroom closing and locking Harry door on the way. Harry’s whole face felt swollen and it hurt to move his jaw. Dully Harry sat still waiting for the sun to rise, the pain would keep him awake which meant that Vernon would not de disturbed for the rest of the night.
“I promise you, Severus, I have not and will not forget about Harry. The second Lucius is safe in my protection, I will rain fire down on the Order like they have never seen and bring your son back to you.”
“Can I ask you some questions?” Harry abruptly blurted out.
“That will be why it suits you then.”
“Thank you.”
“Oh, thank fucking Merlin,” Sirius gave a tremendous sigh and collapsed on the bed. Harry braced himself, trying to quickly prepare for when Sirius asked him who it belonged to. He wouldn’t give up Draco’s name. Not because he didn’t trust Sirius, but because no one could betray a secret that they didn’t know. That was another useful thing he had learnt from Tom. But to his bewilderment, Sirius neither asked him any more question nor brought up the subject again. He wasn’t ignoring the whole thing, for whenever they were alone, he would give the torc a firm tap so Harry could feel the metal vibrate around his throat. The sensation filled him with comfort and reassurance that he was wanted and mated to Draco. Harry absolutely loved that feeling, but he couldn’t get the right angle and strength to produce it himself. Sirius just never spoke about it again.
“I cannot stay here for another moment listing to the two of you billing and cooing” came a grumpy voice.
“His family,” Severus said deadpan.
The information didn’t really register. Severus had looked over both results and confirmed they said the same thing that Harry was biological his. Then Narcissa had entered with the healing web still in its frame. They had hung it over the bed Harry was on, then got everything in place. The next lot of actions happened rapidly as there was no a second to waste. Voldemort dropped the Stasis spell, Narcissa instantly put Harry into a healing sleep and linked the web to him. Then Severus began to sing. There were no words involved just cascading notes. He was relieved to find out the knowledge that he would instinctively know which note to sing next was indeed correct. While he sang both the Dark Lord and Narcissa cast healing spell after healing spell. With each spell part of the web would shrivel up turn black and fall off as it transferred the healing into Harry using the magic Severus was singing.
Severus watched the breakfast crowd with mild interest, making sure his scowl didn’t shift from his face. When Hogwarts had restarted, it had been an awkward opening feast. Between the ministry toad, no boy hero, and the number of students not re-enrolling had been higher than estimated. All four houses had lost a quarter of their students. Severus knew that Minerva and Albus had expected some loss, but there had been a lot of parents who hadn’t bothered to inform the school of their decision. He had never been more thankful that he wasn’t in a higher position of power as the two of them had been in constant meetings.
“Yes! Yes,” Severus said fervently, not caring what Tom was asking so long as he continued to touch him. Tom gave him a wicked grin then bent and opening his mouth swallowed him down to the root in one continues motion. Severus’ entire body jerked, and he came instantly. Vision whitening out from the power of his orgasm.
Sirius saw where Harry was looking and after staring at the bandage, he turned to Harry, raising an eyebrow in question. Harry half shrugged, acknowledging his handiwork. The other eyebrow rose as Sirius wondered what he had done. Harry bit his lip for a second then relented and bared his teeth, snapping them closed on the air before smoothing out his expression once again. Sirius instantly turned his head away, but Harry could feel his body shaking with suppressed laughter as Sirius pulled him in for a quick hug. Harry ducked his head to hide his pleased grin. There whole silent communication had only taken a few seconds so nobody caught it.
Severus said nothing for a long moment, then he nodded.
“Yeah, I’m cool. I don’t care if other people want to walk around without clothes just so long as they don’t make me do the same.”
“Say your goodbyes now.”
Harry also treated the gown to the poke test, then grabbed. What followed would have Severus laughing at the comedy of errors had it been under any other situation. Harry took a bite out of it then realised it wasn’t for eating. It took him a bit to feel just how warm it was, but once he did, he was in a mad scramble to dress himself. Sirius was attempting to help but only making things twice as hard as he stood on bits of the gown and pulled other sections with his muzzle. Eventually, the pair of them got there, the clothing making him look years younger. He tugged on Sirius trying to get him to fit under the gown but as the Grimm was the same height as him it was not a straightforward task. Not helped because Sirius didn’t want to let Severus out of his sights for a second. Eventually, the poor mutt crouched down on his belly and crawled in between Harry’s legs. The gown was big enough that it covered Sirius completely once he was curled around Harry’s feet. Still not wanting to give up on his protection, Sirius stuck his muzzle out between the buttons at Harry’s knee height and rumbled threateningly.
“Would you look at this?” He said to Draco, reaching to run his hand over Draco’s chest. A stinging hex hit his fingers before he could make contact.
I’m sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry” he chanted brokenly.
At first, Tom couldn’t hear what was being said as the conversation started quietly, but everyone could see the other person frequently shaking their head as Dumbledore spoke. Dumbledore got more and more frustrated with every head shake and gestured wildly. Eventually, his voice rose enough that Tom could hear it from a couple of tables over.
The tears were still sliding down his face, one after another with no sign of stopping. Harry stumbled over to the window and watched the sunrise with a dazed and hopeless expression. Only seven more days. He tried to console himself, but the prospects of going back to Hogwarts did not fill him with joy for the first time. Going back would mean he was still separated from his mate and would be surrounded by the Light lackies. Harry felt his upper lip twitch in a sneer, even with the tears still falling. He hated the Light! They were a bunch of hypocrites and liars. Even the prospects of being finally able to see Severus was tainted. It was Harry's fault Severus was hurt. Harry didn’t deserve to have such a quietly noble and amazing talent person as Severus as his Father.
“In what way?”
Harry didn’t want to sit through another day of this, he planned to use the skills Tom had been teaching him. He grabbed Draco by the hand, dragged him over to where Narcissa was sitting. Pushing Draco down, he got him to sit by her feet. He then plonked himself into Draco’s lap, who automatically wrapped his hands around Harry. Harry then lay his head on Narcissa knee. His actions had been so precise and quick that it had startled both the Malfoy’s and neither had their hackles raised yet.
“Um, right. Ok?” Harry replied confused and Tom swept away before the Gryffindor could gather his wits and refuse.
Harry beamed, puffing up his chest, so proud to be acknowledged as Severus’ son. The sight was funny, but no one laughed. This was far too precious to be ruined with laughter. Even friendly laughter.
Narcissa had been able to reassure him that he hadn’t caused irreversible damage. But an important lesson had been learned. Eros wanted to do what was best for their mates and that sometimes meant saying no. Because he had come into his inheritance so young Narcissa was reaching out to other Eros to build Draco a safety net of guides and teachers to help Draco come into his own and to learn which instincts to listen to and which had to be controlled.
This wasn’t anything like before, Severus had been right! Harry continued trying to do whatever he could to get more happy sighs from his Godfather.
Woodenly Harry got to his feet and walked over to the door. He opened it and obediently followed the Headmaster back to the kitchen.
“No, I meant I don’t want all these people to see me naked!”
“Come now Harry,” Voldemort scolded mildly. “Don’t take me for a fool, I could give the most convincing allocution that has ever been heard and you would still doubt me and not believe a word I said, how could you not? You are tied up and held at my mercy.”
Vernon let out a wordless bellow of rage and grabbed Harry by the hair on his crown, lifting him into the air. Harrys feet flailed around wildly. Both his hands grabbing hold of Vernon’s wrist, trying to take some pressure off his scalp.
“Um, alright. What are you doing here professor?”
Severus concluded that he should move away from the person topics for the moment until he had, had a chance to research and practice them. He would stick to the facts whilst remaining honest. Nothing would work quicker to break down any trust he gained then to lie to the boy. He could attribute this as true from his childhood.
“Severus, I was just looking for you, I was wondering...... oh another one?”
“Intriguing, come let's discuss this in more details in my office.”
Since it was constantly causing Harry headaches trying to sort this out, he decided to just split the Dark Lord into two. The evil lunatic who terrorised the Wizarding world and killed his parents (Except Severus was still very much alive. No, think about that later) and who Harry had battled against in first and second year was Voldemort. The man who rescued, healed and now talked to Harry daily was Tom. A completely different guy from the first. One that Harry could ask any question to and he would get an answer for it. And the answers were not what Harry wanted to hear, but the truth.
“I, … I didn’t know women could hurt men like that. I thought it was something that only men did.”
Harry never wanted to put his godfather in that position, so he made sure he went outdoors for Sirius as often as he could. Ever since he had become an Obscurial, he had sensed Sirius emotions, and he knew it was the same in reverse. Poor Sirius had to deal with the whole gauntly of messy human feeling whereas Harry only had to deal with the much more simplistic animal range. It was this that made Harry unconcerned about Sirius while everyone was pulling long faces around him. He could feel that Sirius was happy exploring in both his Grimm or smoke form, enjoying his unbound freedom for the first time in his life. As far as Sirius was concerned it didn’t get better than this. No obligations or expectations to tie him down, and no prisons of stone or house to keep him from roaming. Topped off with the unconditional love from his godson. The soul of Sirius couldn’t ask for more than that.
Harry looked at the Go board considering. He still lost every game, but he could tell he was improving. He no longer made quick rash moved but took his time to think about it. Something that Tom also did. Harry spent the time waiting for his opponent to make a move, either thinking about the answer he had just received or coming up with additional questions to ask. There was one that wasn’t urgent, but it had been bugging Harry for a while now.
“Pretend what Harry?” She inquired.
Draco growled. “He is mine. Mine to look after, mine to love, mine to treasure.”
There were a million colours here, everything boxy and square. There were so many buttons that Draco was sure he would never remember what they all did. He swallowed, clenching his hands into fists and back out again.
The next day he spent a while staring out the front window at the street beyond his house. He hadn’t ventured out there yet, and really he didn’t want to all that much. He hadn’t been there since he got apparated a few streets over earlier this week, and the concept frightened him a little. Sure, he was fine here, in his own house, where he could control everything and wish for magic all he wanted. But out there? Where magic was unacceptable, and there was to be not so much of a sniff of it otherwise the ministry would come breathe down his neck until he died.
Maybe he would wear them again someday, but today wasn’t it. Pulling out more clothes, he sorted through the jumpers. So many of them were ones he didn’t recognise – possibly new ones that his mum had bought. She was always so thoughtful like that.
When he woke up, he felt better rested than he had done in a while. Yawning, he stretched out, and winced only a little at the various aches and pains he had picked up in the last few days. He had become accustomed to being able to magic away any pain he had – or just pester Madam Pomfrey into curing his pains if he didn’t know the spells – and it had been a tough break to realise that he would simply have to wait for them all to go away.
(Why were muggles so obsessed with having so many buttons and things control their devices? Did they have no other way to do so?)
Maybe they would notice. Muggles were very sneaky, after all.
But he was hungry enough that he knew he had to try it. There was no time to sit and cook a three course meal, as much as he might have wanted to do so. There was only the need for food right now.
The watering can he had was a smidge rusty, but that was okay. He had found it the day before in the shade of the shed, and had promptly chased out the spiders that had made it their home, before requisitioning it for his own use. The spiders would just have to find somewhere else to live. (The fact that only a few years before going near any spiders would have been enough to have him screaming made him laugh. He had been long since forced to get used to them.)
So then who was it? Who would be sat in their garden in the dark, in the middle of the night? It made no sense, and Draco began to worry. Had someone broken in? It would be strange, but not impossible, and if they could get into the Dursley’s garden they could get into his…
Two women stared at him. Then the one on the right smiled at him, recognition coming to her eyes. “You must be Draco!” She exclaimed, waving the drink she held in one hand. “Welcome!”
Initially he had no idea where he was. This wasn’t his bedroom at the manor, it wasn’t the Slytherin boys’ dorms, and it wasn’t the cell he had slept in at the ministry.
No, it was clearly much better to keep to his house and his garden. He was safe there.
Putting everything back inside the first trunk, Draco got things back to the tidy way they were before. Then he pulled the second trunk closer, and hoped that it would hold the things he needed.
(Did muggles just stay cold in the winter? Was that what they did? Truly, Draco had no idea how anyone was supposed to survive without warming charms built into the fabric of the building.)
“Great!” Alison sounded genuinely happy at the idea of Draco joining them. Draco couldn’t possibly imagine why that was.
From his vantage point Draco was able to see not only his own garden, but the gardens of his immediate neighbours. The one to the right was wild, overgrown. It very clearly hadnt been taken care of in a very long time. Draco preened a little, looking at the difference between his own well-manicured lawn. Sure, he had only been here for a few days, and the lawn wasn’t something that he had actually contributed to, but he could still be proud of it.
Technically he could always go out there now. Make it less scary. It was bright – the sunlight was directly illuminating the houses on the other side of the street, and the road itself – and it was quiet too, very few cars (which, Draco still didn’t quite understand those things – he’d seen them around before, but they still made no sense. How did they operate without magic?), and Draco couldn’t ask for much more out of a day.
It looked just the same as it had done last night. Slightly dreary, entirely second hand, with the only good quality items being his own trunks of his things.
This seemed to be the packet which was the one that the grease was coming from. Gingerly, Draco took out one of the thin things inside, and took a bite. It – crunched.
Walking into the kitchen again with trepidation, Draco pulled open one of the other cupboards that he hadn’t had the time to properly explore the night before. Instead of there being cooking utensils, there were boxes and cans and packets of all kinds of foods. (Maybe if he had discovered this cupboard last night he wouldn’t have been reduced to eating the sausages. It was a thought that he didn’t want to poke too deeply into.)
So Draco simply chose to walk away. He had hoped that listening in on their conversation might illuminate their characters, or at least be interesting to listen to, but it wasn’t. Petunia Dursley was too shrill, and Dudley Dursley was less interesting than a sack of potatoes.
Draco began to tune out the conversation, realising that the interesting part had passed. Humming and nodding in the right places, Draco’s eyes wandered around the room as he wondered how much longer he should stay here.
Having relieved himself, Draco turned to his other priorities. He hadn’t showered in several days – he hadn’t been allowed to shower much while at the ministry, and the last time had been two days before he came here.
“Who are they?” He asked, turning back to Alison.
It had only been an hour or so ago that Draco had been out there, sure that he wouldn’t want to get dirty and do any gardening.
wearing a suit (even he could admit that they made one’s figure look excellent), but that didn’t mean that they didn’t pale in comparison to the elegance of dress robes.
This occupied the rest of Draco’s morning. It was difficult to actually focus on it, but Draco was certain that if he spent long enough trying to read it, he would eventually succeed.
Maybe he should look this stuff up. If he was going to live here for a while, he might need to know more about these mysterious sports.
Draco sighed, resting his hands on the counter tops. What was he going to do now?
Their son seemed neutral, compared to his parents. He looked around the room with no expression, and Draco found himself hoping. If he was no longer the only young person in the room, maybe this could be an opportunity to make a friend?
“It’s very interesting,” Alison remarked, drinking more of her wine. “You should let my husband take a look at it sometime. He’s a watchmaker, you know, I’m sure he’d be happy to look at it for you.”
“What’s your name?” The woman still seemed awfully cheery for someone who couldn’t read that Draco wanted to be left alone. He shuffled his feet, wishing that the awkwardness of this would leave him alone and he could just get back to wallowing. “Mine’s Alison.”
Then Draco caught himself. Making friends with a muggle? He must be going mad.
But his parents had made sure to enforce the importance of good manners here, too. And if there was one thing that Draco wanted, it was to not be the weird one in the neighbourhood. He had had enough of that kind of gossipy environment while he was at Hogwarts, he didn’t need to start it again here.
Quickly, Draco closed the door before she could turn back and say anything more to him. There was nothing he wanted less than to be harassed by middle aged muggles in his time here.
He turned around. Dumbledore was still stood there. He sort of looked expectant, like he expected Draco to invite him in to look around.
He bounced a little on the mattress. It squeaked. Draco groaned a little, and stood up. Tried to put the bed out of his mind.
From the stairs, Draco could see the outline of a figure standing right outside the door. Whoever it was hadn’t gone away.
Draco stared at a pack of sausages in his hand. He could eat all of these by himself if he wanted. There was nobody to stop him. nobody but him would know he had even done it. There would be no repercussions.
“And just because they said yes to drinking with you yesterday doesn’t mean they have to drink with you today get it? You can’t go you drank with me before so you have to drink with me now. It just fucking doesn’t work like that.” Sirius looked at him firmly and Harry meekly nodded his head.
“Thanks, Kiddo, ok so I’ve covered the whole family don’t so sex stuff, now onto the more complicated shite. Figuring out when it’s ok to do sex stuff with others.” Sirius ran a hand through his hair as he gave it some thought.
Harry buried his head in her knees for a moment before peeking out whispering.
Severus sat back straight and still as stone keeping a bedside vigil. Dark eyes surveyed the skeletal chest as it shakily rose and fell. In truth, Severus was relieved for the opportunity to not move and gather his energy and magic. The last twenty-four hours had been overflowing with frantic movements and emotional blows. After a month of not finding even the faintest hint about the Dark Lord, he was awoken to his Mark summoning him to Voldemort's side.
On the flip side, Snape was the only adult who ever apologised to him. He had also been looking after him without a single murmur of complaint. He hadn’t tried to keep Harry away from Draco when he found out they were mates. Something that he could see Mrs Weasley or Dumbledore doing. He had asked for then listened and believed Harry’s point of view. Something that again no other adult had ever done.
Cackles madly as absolutely everything becomes covered in glitter.
“Danger” Harry snarled. Draco gripped his hand, eyes wide.
“No,” Draco replied instantly. “It is something anybody who has finger or toenails can do.”
Severus bowed his head obediently, waiting for Tom to get up and move away. Instead, he felt the comb running through his hair again.
“Well, the time has come to have that talk.”
Hindsight is one of the clearest forms of vison he could now point out multiple points where Harry had shown signs and yet it seemed no one was paying attention to the boy. It was not in any way soothing to know that he was not the only one to miss them. But the role of Boy-Who-Lived shone so brightly that it seemed not on bothered to look beneath to see Harry as himself. That Voldemort his prophesied emery was the first to notice said a lot about the state of the wizarding world and those who live in it.
Severus was about to depart back to the moors when Draco ran up to him. Severus out of kindness didn’t mention the red-rimmed eyes or blotchy patches on Draco's pale cheeks.
“I’m already prepped, my Lord.”
“Are you under the impression that the Mate is the weaker one of the pair? That the Eros does all the thinking for both of them and the Mate is nothing more than an empty head companion?”
“Great,” Sirius peeled the shirt the rest of the way off and stood in front of Harry, arms wide in a ta-da motion. Harry peered, fascinated. He stopped after a second to check Sirius face to see if he minded but he was grinning amused and gestured back to his torso. It was covered in blue and black marks and symbols.
“Good. Here is where things can get bollocks up easily. Sometimes people say yes but they don’t mean yes.”
Harry slowly walked across Lucius office to the seat by the window. He found himself tired all the time which Snape had explained was a sign his body was healing which was a good thing. It took a lot of energy to do so which put Harry in the position of falling asleep constantly and being far too tired to do anything more strenuous then small walks.
Severus had reeled back in shock. This could not be! He was incredulous that what he was seeing was real. But all questions of how the Dark Lord had gotten hold of him or why the saviour of the wizarding world was in such a state had to be put on hold. Potter’s life was hanging in the balance and until they could stabilise him nothing else mattered.
Tom nodded privately surprised, he was curious and wanted to know what happened but he thought for sure Severus would go to the old fool Dumbledore.
Harry lay on the floor limbs splayed looking up at his white ceiling. He was doing his best to stay cool, as this summer was unnaturally hot. He was extremely glad he had the foresight to tell Hedwig to fly free for the summer. He had left her at Hogwarts knowing she could come and go as she pleased. Hagrid had promised to keep an eye on her for Harry and he knew his beloved owl was in good hands.
But Harry had been throwing his normal spot on predictions out the window right from the time he was one year old and he wasn’t stopping now.
“Alright, you do know that it is going to require a Legilimens to look through your memories?”
Harry tapped incessantly against his torc.
“Yes, I knew and was childhood friends with your mother. We remained friends right up till the end of our Fifth year. Details of which shall not be discussed today.” Severus quickly added as he saw Harry’s mouth begin to open. Once he was sure the child wouldn’t speak he glanced down before continuing.
“If we could bring back the teacher assistant, at least one per subject that would be grand.”
“What on earth is that?” Mrs Weasley asked. Harry could see the majority of the people looked confused.
A leaf sat in the palm of one of his hands and half-delirious he shredded it. Not a moment later he felt a hooking sensation behind his navel and the smallest bedroom of 4 Privet drive disappeared in a swirl of colour.
“Harry, I need you to tell me what happened.” He commanded.
“Really?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“PUP!”
“You came out here to be close to Sirius you had a bad dream, and it was triggering your Obsurial side. I’m out here to help my mate and remind him who he is.”
“The combination of somewhere safe and surround by only those who love him is providing with Harry the best opportunity to heal from the damage his Obsciual form caused,” Narcissa said with calm, certainly her Dark healer knowledge coming in handy. She was leading Lucius into the room. He had a short gold chain running from one wrist band to the other. It was only a couple of links long, effectively stopping Lucius from being able to use either hand for anything. She sat down on the other armchair and removing her wand, she made a giant cushion appear at her feet.
He stayed like that for hours getting just enough air that he didn’t black out but not much more. This was a living torment as Harry constantly fought to breathe. Trying to stay balanced on the knives edge was slowly driving him mad. But the knowledge that if he stopped, he would suffocate pushed him on.
She nodded and left.
“I can teach you the basics and we could play while we chat. It gives our hands something to do so they are not lying idle.”
“All the teachers were spread out to thin. Trying to wear too many hats at once, there was a lot that slipped through the gaps.” Severus said
Dumbledore let out a weary sigh then turned to the other adults.
“None of that now. You are going to stay muzzled until I say otherwise.” pulling out the sash from his dressing gown Vernon tied his hands savagely tight. Once he was done, he pushed Harry who stumbled, overbalanced and unable to throw his hands out fell onto his chest. His head hitting the floor a second later narrowly missing the edge of his bed. He broke his nose and could feel the blood gushing out of it.
“But even if you or any kid actual said yes, it doesn’t count. You don’t offer firewhiskey to kids, cause they’re too young to drink it.”
“No,” Harry blurted out. “No, I won’t go back there. I won’t!”
I'm posting this a day early in rewards to all those awesome people who commented.
“Mr Potter,” Dumbledore snapped. “That kind of behaviour is unacceptable, I had thought you would be the bigger person here and not hold the fact that your relatives are muggles against them. I am severely disappointed to see this is not true.”
Lucius would walk away from this a Hero. The public would be clamming to give Lucius an Order of Merlin first-class medal. He would be held up as an example to others of what they should strive for. The Malfoy name would be more powerful and desired than before. Then when Tom slowly leaked the love story between Draco and Harry, well, they wouldn’t be able to do wrong in the public’s eye.
And that, that was a real struggle. Harry was used to eating once every day or so. To suddenly find himself being offered food so many times in a single day was extremely off-putting. It wasn’t the amount of food. Narcissa had been the one to say how much Harry got and she was spot on. By the time he finished the little bowl, his stomach felt comfortable full. And that in its self was something Harry hadn’t know he could feel. Either his stomach was empty or Harry had gored himself and it was very uncomfortable it almost felt like it was going to tear apart. On those occasions, Harry would end up vomiting all the food back up. He always felt guilty for wasting good food. Yet relieved that it was no longer inside of him. As he had gotten older, he had stopped goring himself at the opening feast. Instead, he would squirrel away bits of food and slowly increase the amount he ate over the school year.
“We shall have to try and figure out what Voldemort's trick is. What trap he is laying. And we will have to increase our vigilance.”
Severus had been thoroughly enjoying being the recipient of Tom’s kisses and had for some time now wished that his Lord would take it further and bed him. He knew Tom was interested in progressing as he had felt the proof pressed against him hot and hard on many occasions. He had been wondering what was holding his Lord back and had to curse himself for a fool once he took the time to come out of his lovesick haze and looking back over their interactions realised Tom had never even kissed him until Severus initiated the first one. Which meant that Tom had been waiting for Severus.
“One of the failures of society is its belief that a woman cannot rape a man. This is in fact incorrect. Women can and do rape men far more often than what we expect.”
Harry shook his head again. Making himself comfortable Severus began singing the saga that his mother had taught him about the Viking called Ragnar. It didn’t take long for colour to slowly creep back into the boy’s cheeks as he became captivated in the story. he was so enthralled that when it came time for his next meal he absentmindedly ate the whole bowl without having to be coaxed to finish it for the first time since he got here.
Pauses as the sound of the readers angry voice's getting closer. Looks around again, spies a couple of fluffy cushions. Grabs them up opens to door and throws the cushions into the crowd. SLAMS door closed and runs for the bolt hole before the confused murmur coming through the door changes back to angry.
“My family doesn’t like magic, which means they don’t like me much, so they don’t always feed me as much as I would like. That doesn’t mean I'm abused!”
“What’s wrong?” Narcissa asked.
“Lets us raise a glass, to friendship and Cedric.”
Narcissa strode pinched lipped over to Lucius and grabbing his shoulders she barked out a horse word in Enochian. Lucius wrist bands flashed for a second before returning to normal. She then gave him a quick kiss before walking away with a straight back holding her pose. Draco was not even close to as graceful. He scrambled to Harry, uttered the same word, lighting up his torc before pulling Harry into a tight hug. He then shot off after his mother.
“Don’t be sorry, not unless you didn’t mean it. Or were doing it as payment”
“Hey,” He snapped. “What spell did you cast? No one noticed this at all, not even Dumbledore.”
He then informed them that from what he knew Cughtagh could heal anything, but those who were half or a quarter had to have connection in order to be able to heal. The closer the ties the better the healing would go. Such valuable obscure knowledge showed that the rumours of the Dark Lord being extremely intelligent were not baseless.
Harry opened his mouth to say, cast a spell, but paused. Dumbledore was one of the smartest people alive, and there was a room filled with fully trained people. If there was some other way someone would have said it.
Harry looked down at the book he had been reading. It was a generalisation of what having a mate meant. Unfortunately, it was written centuries ago and Harry was struggling with the archaic langue. Having never been much of a reader he looked around the office instead. While his body was constantly tired currently his mind was not. And reading didn’t appeal to him at all at the moment.
“MINE!”
“I know the board is going to insist that each member of staff is not allowed to have more than one role. The only exception will be the Heads of House,” Severus added. The other three looked pleased with this news and added it to the parchment. Once they had run out of ideas for improvements for the moment Minerva looked across to Severus who had been quiet and not offering his input.
His serpent opened the door and gave him a brief bow. Tom had asked both him and the Malfoy’s not to bother with the subjugation but understood that it would take time for his loyal followers to comply. He had done far too good a job of training them in the first place. Like all things he had done while under the influence of his Horcruxes it made a lot of mess for him to come back and fix.
“Back with me?” Tom asked tenderly, Severus nodded, suddenly overcome with shyness. Tom smiled and brushed tiny kisses over his face.
Exhale.
And yet here was Harry. Severus observed his son breathing slowly. It was an exquisite form of torture to be made to watch a child you never knew you had as they lay recovering in a healing bed. And yet Severus would not want to be anywhere else. As painful as this was, he knew it would be so much worse to be parted from the boy’s side and not know whether he continued to draw in breaths. Or if his chest stilled and his heart cease to move and Severus wasn’t on hand to give him life once more. Severus roughly told himself to snap out of it. Focus on the now, Harry was safely tucked into bed and He was permitted to kept bedside vigil over his son.
Readers before they start reading: "Wow this chapter is twice as long compared to the others"
“For crying out loud what now?”
“Sirius”
Harry didn’t move.
“Yes, my lor... yes Tom.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Robe me Wormtail,” Came a cold high voice.
“I want you to do what you want to do, without having to consider others’ expectations.”
Harry’s legs cut out, and he fell back into his seat. His stomach rolling as his inner fears were proven right. Here was a room full of adults fighting for justice and protecting the innocent, and the only one kicking up a fuss was Sirius. Who was yelling at Dumbledore, saying he won’t allow it and offering Harry protection. But Sirius was still recovering from the actions of the dementors, Harry had heard multiple members whisper about Sirius crazy behaviour.
“Yeah, Mate, it must have been terrible,” Ron said, coming up and standing beside Hermione.
“You're a faggot so you can suck my dick, you’ll like that.”
They managed to catch him pretty quickly. They pulled him over to a tall fence so they were out of sight then the two boys held him in place until the rest of the gang arrived where they took great pleasure in taunting him and pushing him to the ground. Depending on the day Harry would occasionally get kicked but the heat worked in his favour. They couldn’t be bothered to expend that much energy.
Maybe this was a sign that he was beginning to heal from the past year.
He had his breakfast, and spent the morning in contemplation about his magic. If he could find a way to channel some of his natural magic into a form that he could control, then he would have a chance of escaping this place, and getting back to where he belonged.
There ended up not being very much to find – although there was a small cache of muggle books in one of the other bedrooms, and Draco had flicked through them for a laugh. Most of it involved a lot of things that Draco didn’t understand, and he only really gave them passing glances before putting them aside. For some reason they all seemed to be focussed on romance, something that Draco couldn’t understand. He hadn’t so much as touched any fictional books since he was a child. Why would adults be reading about fictional events? And why would they care about the romance between characters who didn’t even exist?
His lunch was as bland and boring as the breakfast had been, only sandwiches. For this one, though, he stood at the window and watched his garden. the plants he had put in there were looking good, even without any charms to encourage growth. Herbology had never been Draco’s strongest subject, but after years of being subjected to professor sprout’s awful lectures and even worse fashion sense, he thought he had retained at least a little of the information.
Sighing, he went upstairs. There were blankets there, at least. And if there were blankets, he could huddle under them until he became warm again, and could get to sleep.
Turning away from the window, Draco noticed the letter poking out from under his bed. It was stark white in the dark, standing out from the floor and calling Draco’s attention to it.
Draco looked up. He couldn’t see it very well, but he could see the figure of someone in the garden a little way away from him. they were wearing clothes that looked very distressed, and flapped around in the breeze like they were far too big for them. Is that what muggles wore these days? Draco pulled a face. What terrible taste this person had. He wouldn’t want to be caught dead with someone who dressed like that.
The room did go right back to how it was before, but that was okay. That woman stood up, talked to her friends briefly, and walked over to Draco, bringing someone else with her. Draco stood there and waited to be talked to.
“What are you planning to do now that you’re here?” One of them asked him.
“I wanted to be like my father,” he said thoughtlessly. A moment later he realised what he had said – surely this was the thing that was going to make her more curious? He watched her carefully, waiting for her to ask, and trying to think of what muggle jobs there were that he could possibly say his father did.
Draco wondered if there were any gardening tools in the house. He had never used any himself, of course, but he had seen the gardeners use them several times – how difficult could it be to copy whatever it was they did?
Some part of Draco stopped paying attention as he began to shovel them into his mouth. There was no part of his brain that wanted to acknowledge that he was doing this, nor why he was doing it.
Shit.
Draco held out his palm over the pan again. This time there was definite heat coming off of it, a sure sign that it was actually working. Okay. That was weird – why would it take so long to warm up? Why was that convenient for muggles? It didn’t make much sense.
By the time he had done that, and eaten his breakfast, Draco felt bored.
He ended up with a mental list of:
But she was his only source of contact for the wizarding world. He thumbed the parchment. If he chose not to reply, he would be cutting himself off completely.
Carol smiled even wider. “Oh, that’s so sweet!” She patted his cheek.
And then, like a fool, he looked out of the kitchen window at the garden.
And so he said, “I’d love to come.” The words stung as they came out. He couldn’t take them back, though.
Things felt a lot less worrying than they had done last night. The frenzy that had existed while Draco ate the sausages, and had driven him to strange lengths, was completely gone. All that was left was the shame that came with being complacent with the muggles way of living.
Excellent. “Sure,” Draco replied, following her through the room to the table.
Shit.
Awkwardly, Draco walked round and perched on the edge of one of the unoccupied chairs on the edge of the room.
But the sausages were cooking now. Draco could deal with that, if it meant that he got food. Working out the ‘how’s and well as the ‘why’s could wait for after Draco had eaten. And besides – arguably it wasn’t important so long as it all worked. So long as Draco could eat.
Grabbing the sunhat which was sat on top of his trunk, he headed downstairs.
“Yes, whatever you want,” a voice said on the other side of the fence.
“You too,” he said, doing his best to keep to the politeness that he was brought up to have. “I hope I’m not too late?”
Turning and walking out of the room, he jogged down the stairs. His trunks were still at the bottom, and he picked up the first one. And – he staggered. His trunk was heavier than he remembered it being, and his arms strained a little as he hefted it to a point resting against his chest where it felt balanced.
But at least this was a parting thing – he didn’t have to worry about interacting with her any more than this. Her hand felt… well, normal, but Draco knew that didn’t mean anything. She was still a muggle, and if Draco had his wand he would have been cursing her with all his might.
Should he savour these books? Leave them until he was so thirsty for knowledge that he would go batty if he didn’t read about magic? Or should he read them now, while he still had the brain power to do so? No doubt staying so long in a muggle neighbourhood would be enough to remove his brain from his body entirely, and make him nothing more than a sad husk. No doubt that was what the ministry expected him to do.
They were words which Draco had done his best to live by for the past ten years, ever since his mother decided that he was too old to be dressing like he didn’t care.
Alison’s face did a strange thing as she seemed to process Draco’s name. “That’s certainly an unusual name,” she said. “Draco. Well, it was very nice to meet you Draco.” She held a hand out, and Draco realised with horror that she expected him to shake it.
It was a list which Draco internally despaired of. Cereal was something he was familiar with from Hogwarts – the mudbloods had eaten it liberally, while Draco preferred the more traditional full English. He would never have stooped so low as to eat the muggle food in full view of other purebloods… but maybe it was time to let himself do what he needed to in order to survive.
But he still couldn’t say no. Maybe a year ago he might have risked it, and impulsively given into the urge to tell the woman to fuck off, that he didn’t want to associate himself with muggles. But he didn’t have the mental energy to do that to any other person – and despite how annoying she was, Draco didn’t think that she was doing it to be cruel to him.
‘A guide to muggle life’
“I know,” Alison said, sounding a little like she hadn’t actually heard what Draco said. “Isn’t it awful? This is the first gathering they’ve come to this year. We only invite them because it would be rude not to.”
He walked inside fully. Immediately he was waved over by the woman he hadn’t known the name of earlier – and well, there was no need to not go over.
But maybe his mum had packed things and they’d been removed. Why they would have been when the books weren’t Draco didn’t know, but it was a possibility.
Draco found himself resisting, so many times, the urge to reach for his wand. If only he could use a cooking charm, or even just summon some fire, then he could cook the sausages in any way he wanted.
He needed to shower. There was no question about it.
Going back downstairs and bringing one book with him, Draco settled into the sofa he had slept on last night. It was slightly too comfortable, but he also didn’t fancy sitting at the dining room table to read. Draco needed some decadence in his life, and if a second hand sofa was going to be it then he would settle for it. The book needed reading.
Holding onto the trowel, Draco headed back through the house, this time to the front door, for something he had noticed when he moved in the other day. There were several plants in pots in the front. Draco had no idea who had put them there, but they were his now, and he thought they would do better in the ground in the back garden.
Before Draco had time to backtrack, to realise that maybe this was a bad idea after all, she was opening the door. “I’ve got another one for you,” she announced to the room. As Draco watched, ten or so men turned around to look at them. There was one of those… those things that muggles spent so much of their time glued to on the other end of the room. Unlike the one in Draco’s house, it was glowing, and showing some sort of picture? Draco could only assume that it was like the moving pictures he was familiar with, because what else could it be? “He’s the new one, from across the street.”
Slowly, he pulled them out of the fridge. Richmond sausages. They were slightly cold, a part of the charm inside the cold box, he thought.
Right. He wasn’t there, though.
Feeling cleaner, Draco pressed the buttons until the water shut off. Stepping out of the tub (and trying not to slip), he picked up a towel that had been left at the side of it, and dried himself off.
The man had a permanent sneer on his face, even as he talked to the people around him. None of them seemed to notice. But it reminded Draco very much of his own father – of the way he thought himself mighty superior to everyone around him, even when talking to people who should have been his peers.
Maybe that could wait for now. Draco walked down the short corridor. At the end of it was what he supposed was meant to be a kitchen, small and without any house elves.
There was little else to do, though. He had talked to everyone that he had come here to talk to, and all of them were currently talking to other people. Was there any need for him to stay?
Draco could give up all of his luxuries. He could. But this? He picked at a loose thread on the mattress. It was very clearly not a new mattress. It was barely usable.
With hands that shook (from lack of sleep, of course), Draco opened the letter. It read:
He scanned over the letter again. He was fully awake now, and now that he was, he found himself full of questions.
Draco wasn’t sure he believed that. the words Alison was saying didn’t match up with the way people were talking to them. If Draco hadn’t been told any of this, he would have believed that they were all the best of friends. There was no sign of any hostility in any of the people the Dursleys were talking to.
“I’ve just finished with school,” he said carefully.
The only thing that happened was a light turned on at the bottom of the metal that covered all of this. Draco had no idea what the source of the light was.
“That’s fascinating,” he murmured, wondering what it would be like to live next to these people. “And you still invite them to these things?”
Going straight for the bathroom, Draco found himself consoled by the familiarity of the bathrooms. Clearly the muggles had some things right, and that was having the same type of bathrooms that wizards did. Draco knew that there had to be some difference in how they operated, since there couldn’t be magic involved, but he didn’t know what that might be.
Draco had bigger things to think about right now.
Draco had no idea what ‘Rugby’ was. Context said it must be another sport? But it was hard to tell.
Frenzied, and desperate to get clean, Draco pressed every button – and was then showered in freezing water. Gasping, he twisted the temperature dial until it was facing full red. Would that do the trick?
Draco’s whole being shuddered with every step.
This was a lifeline. This was a way to stay connected to his heritage. It was a way to get back at the ministry, for thinking they could get the better of a Malfoy.
But he had no wand. He couldn’t change his mattress at all. And he realised, with sudden clarity, that if he complained about the mattress, he would only be accused of being spoiled again. It would only make him seem like someone who needed all of the fancy things, all of the time.
There was no sign of anything other than the few plants which dotted the perimeter of the garden – aside from the glimpse of metal down the side of the house. That was a potential hoard of tools, right?
The kitchen seemed to hold the same people as before, when he poked his head in. So he decided to explore a little, to see where everyone else was.
“Oh, that’s nice,” Carol said. She sipped her wine. “And what are you going to do now?”
Wrapping himself in the towel, he walked through to his… bedroom.
He opened the door. The first thing that he saw was a hallway, painted a pale magnolia colour. It was ugly as hell, and there were generic framed pictures of flowers hung on the walls. Had the last owner been a middle aged woman? It definitely seemed that way.
The other woman she had been talking to smiled and said, “Alison, I’ll talk to you later.”
Draco smiled too. “Nice to meet you,” he said. Weird – he knew this woman’s name now, and fully couldn’t remember the name of the woman who had spoken to him before.
He knelt down at the edge of the garden, placing the pot to one side for now.
There was little to look at in the rest of the room. One dresser stood on the other wall, made of a light wood that Draco didn’t recognise. As he walked closer to it, he began to see how it was scratched up. Not too much, but enough that he could see the dents in the top, and the rounding out of the corners that spoke to it being brushed against many times.
The strange man was still there in the other garden when Draco stood up. It was much harder for Draco to see what was going on now, and he had to admit, he wasn’t all that interested. These muggles were uninteresting enough that he didn’t care to know any more about them. And there seemed to be nothing exceptional about these ones.
Absently, he pulled out his watch to look at the time. The stars pointed to it being about half nine – a full hour before he could justify saying that he needed to go to bed.
With the only possible option for the cooking device being the black circles on top of where the strange glass cupboard was, Draco hesitated before doing anything with it. There were four bits of metal to one side of it, which Draco could only assume was meant to control it.
“What? No, not in rugby. In football.” The man scowled at him. “Answer the question properly.”
Wondering what was wrong with him that he was seriously considering taking this as a hobby, Draco immediately went back inside. There was no telling what sorts of nonsense he might get up to if he indulged himself in this ridiculous notion of making the garden look nice himself. He must – there must be a way to get the ministry to do it for him. Surely they couldn’t expect him to care for a whole house and garden himself? That would be far too difficult.
The one piece of normality were the two trunks tucked against the wall just inside the door. He recognised them immediately – of course he did, they both bore the Malfoy crest proudly on the lids – and knew that everything he was being allowed to have was tucked away inside them. If he had had the chance to pack them himself he would have known what was actually inside them, but as it was he had to make do with knowing that his mum had had a hand in packing.
How had he –
Draco stared at the number plate on the house in front of him. “You’re sure about this?” He asked.
He would need to find something in here to eat. he picked up various packages, and put them back down, rummaging as he never would at home for something to eat. It was odd, he thought – he never really had much choice in what he ate. At home he simply ate what the house elves brought him – not hard to do, since his parents had brought him up eating proper food, and there was nothing to dislike about it. And then at Hogwarts it was mostly much of the same, with a small amount more of variation. Sure, there would be a variety of dishes served at dinner, but he would still be limited to what was served that night. And there was nothing worse than telling your guest that their food wasn’t good enough, and that it should be made up differently. Draco had better manners than that.
Focussing more on the food than on his chair, Draco gingerly pulled open one of the packets. Oh – this one was chocolate. Draco didn’t recognise the branding, but he recognised what chocolate was. Eating some of it, he was happy to find that it was familiar and tasted good. As usual with chocolate, it helped to calm him down – to make him feel better about all this. Tension and stress that Draco didn’t even know he had been carrying flowed out of him, and it made it almost easier to deal with.
Realising that he had dug himself into too deep a hole, Draco knew that he would have no choice but to touch the muggle. It took all the upper class breeding in him to act like this didn’t pain him one bit, and he shook her hand with all the control he had.
(Because who knew how long that would be? Draco didn’t want to spend years interacting with muggles.)
Draco knocked on the door in front of him. It proclaimed it to be the right door, but Draco wasn’t sure he believed it. Had he come to the wrong house? He couldn’t remember whether the letter said this house or another, and it was too late for him to go check.
Putting the letter down on the living room table, where he was sure to remember it, Draco got on with his day.
And… if he didn’t know this had been written by a muggle, then maybe he would have though it charming.
(To the best of his knowledge he wouldn’t need to worry about getting a muggle job – he hadn’t really understood most of the conversation, but when the ministry sent him here it very much sounded like they were going to pay for everything for him, because of work laws? Draco wasn’t sure what laws there could be that would stop him from being able to work, but maybe it was for the best. Draco probably wouldn’t be very good at any muggle jobs, anyway.)
“Oh – um, Wasps?” Draco said. He enjoyed playing quidditch, but he wasn’t so hot on knowing any of the professional teams. The Wimborne Wasps was usually the go-to team he said he supported when he asked, and it usually made people happy enough. They were usually mid-league, so it wasn’t like they were the canons, or the harpies, or –
Draco patted the coat pocket where he was sure he had put them. “Yep.”
He walked slightly closer to where Draco was, clearly not having seen Draco there, and Draco tried to get a better look at him. Even with him being closer, however, the gap between the boards still wasn’t enough to give Draco a good view of him any better. All Draco got was the flashes of his clothes, tanned skin and dark hair.
“Yes, I’m sure diddy will do excellently at university. I have every expectation that each university will make him an offer. Just look at him, how could they say no?” Mrs Dursley cooed, and pinched Dudley’s cheeks. Draco winced in sympathy.
Maybe it was down to the natural magic in him. He knew that it was possible for plans to soak some of that up, even when they weren’t magical plants, and it helped them to stabilise… something inside of them. Draco hadn’t been paying attention when professor sprout talked about that.
He went round, and watered each of the plants in turn. It was too sunny outside for him to think that he could get away with just waiting for it to rain – the summers down here in the south were harsh, that much he knew from being at home.
But overall there was very little that he didn’t already know about. The other rooms were very empty, and it made Draco sad to look at. It didn’t take long for him to leave them alone, and closing the doors felt good.
It didn’t take him long to get ready. Getting ready for fancy parties was sort of Draco’s forte – you could argue it had been what he was brought up to do.
“In… rugby?” Draco said, voice faint.
Instinctively he went for his wand, to transfigure his bed into one which would be better to sleep on.
Squinting at them, it didn’t take Draco very long to realise that he had no idea what any of these were. The cupboard must have been stocked by a mudblood, because Draco didn’t recognise any of the products in it. It was… surprisingly frustrating to look at.
He sighed. Maybe the universe was right. The letter wasn’t the best way to get back into the wizarding world – and Pansy wasn’t the best person to talk to.
He picked up the one that was closest to him. a trowel, still with mud on. He considered it carefully. This would do for what he wanted to do, right?
“Thank you,” he said. “Oh – and for the record, yes, I am enjoying the party. It’s very… interesting.”
Draco realised that he hadn’t eaten since he left the headquarters – hadn’t eaten since breakfast. Briefly, he considered just not eating. It would be worth it, for not having to eat muggle food today.
Draco forced a smile. “Thank you,” he said quietly. It wouldn’t do to accidentally make any of them think that he was happy to be here. If he did that, they might invite him to more of these things.
There were little pictures by each dial that Draco thought related to each of the rings. The number of rings and the number of dials matched up and it made sense to think that they were meant to go together.
“Wait – I forgot!”
Watering the plants took only a few minutes, but Draco stayed out in the garden for a bit longer. It was so peaceful out here – only the sounds of birds, and the far-away conversations of people in their own gardens. It wasn’t the grounds from back home, but it was nice enough.
That was okay – it only made it easier for him to hear himself think over the sound of other people’s voices. He leaned against the counter, and tried to make himself comfortable.
He wrinkled his nose as the flavour from it coated his tongue. It wasn’t all that pleasant – too fake, too strong for Draco to like it. Pushing the rest of the packet away, Draco decided that he couldn’t possibly eat any more of it, not today.
It had taken this long for Draco to twig that he had a garden attached to the house. He stared at the door which was in the kitchen, which clearly led out to something behind the house. There was a window in the kitchen, and a window in the dining room, both of which looked out onto the space behind the house. Last night it had been dark outside, and he had not even thought to explore beyond the bounds of the house since he was more worried about food and worrying about how much he hated the place.
Another inconvenience, damnit. Draco growled to himself as he stood up and went on another hunt around the kitchen. His own house, and he didn’t know where anything was. what sort of life was that?
He then spent a while trying to access his magic again. This time it felt like he was maybe actually getting there. He couldn’t be sure, but he thought at one point that there was a spark, some sort of movement there that felt a lot like magic.
“It’s nice to meet you all,” Draco said stiffly. Some of the men looked like they were dressed up for the occasion going on outside, but others really didn’t. Draco knew what casual muggle clothes looked like – he had spent enough time around mudbloods at school to know that – and everything that those men were wearing screamed a lack of effort.
“That’s good,” Alison exclaimed, “I knew I did the right thing by telling you to come.”
There were still – Draco counted them – five cupboards to look through, plus a big white rectangle, which Draco couldn’t help but feel looked like it was one small push away from falling over on top of him. It certainly didn’t look like something that one would store their food inside.
But he couldn’t stay around looking at himself in the mirror all night. He picked up his keys, and set off for the house that he only sort of was sure he knew the location of.
When Draco had been told that to begin with, he had assumed that this meant that they assumed he had grown up in luxury, and needed the best of everything all the time. Which, was true, but only because the things that Draco had were superior to anything that they had. Certainly superior to anything that the muggles had.
Walking inside, trying not to let himself be too affected by the wine he had had earlier, he went into the living room. The folder on the floor caught his eye. It had sat there for days, and Draco had been avoiding thinking about it this entire time.
He shook his head. “Wow,” he said. “That’s some story.” He couldn’t say outright that he didn’t believe it. But it was very much implied.
And so did the next day.
Draco missed her.
All of them were books of magic. Two of them were simply textbooks from his seventh year which he had never got around to reading, and the other four were other instructional books. They would be likely to keep him occupied for long enough, even though he couldn’t practice at all due to the lack of a wand.
By the time he was done with that, and had found a way to while away his evening (the fact that he wasn’t sure what it was that he had actually
Reaching out, he gingerly picked up the folder. It was heavier than he had expected, and he had to lift it with both hands in order to actually get the damn thing onto his lap.
He cracked the first one. The familiar smell of old parchment and dried ink hit him like a wave of home, and he couldn’t help but smile.
The least concession that Draco could give them was that the house was fully furnished, just like the Wizenagamot had promised it would be. Draco was genuinely surprised by this – he had been expecting to get the bare minimum of a few chairs downstairs, and a mattress at least, but not much more.
Then he laughed, out loud, the first time he’d laughed in the entire time he’d been here. What muggles were going to see this? It wasn’t like he was going to be talking to any of them, so he didn’t have to worry about anything like that. no, the muggles would be safe from his cold box.
When there was a particularly exciting bit (which Draco only took the cues for when the men in the room began to lean forward and make excited sounds) Draco slipped out the back.
What was he going to do for food?
When it began to feel like too much, when the words were dancing off the page, he stood up from the sofa he had been sat on, and he stretched his legs out. How was he so cramped from only a few hours sitting? He had practically been trained in it since birth.
But it looked so bare. So… unbearable. The more he looked at it, the more Draco wished that it looked better. The garden you had reflected on how much you were willing to do in order to keep it tidy. And since Draco didn’t have the means of getting anyone else to do it for him currently…
Draco swallowed. She was a muggle – but she was nice. Maybe this was some sort of weird anomaly? “Hello,” he said stiffly. “It’s – it’s nice to meet you.” He practically had to choke the words out.
And he knew the only thing he could do here was to open them up, and get his clothes out as best as he could.
The only question that did remain: how to use it?
If he wasn’t up by a certain time, would his neighbours notice? His parents always had at home, and Hogwarts had provided its own schedule.
Pulling open the second trunk, Draco was greeted by a pile of his underwear. He felt himself redden slightly, at the idea of a ministry member having to go through these and looking at his pants.
Once he was done with eating, Draco… didn’t know what to do with himself. What did muggles do with themselves all day?
The light got lower and lower as Draco sat there. The large window that looked out onto the street showed the light slowly getting darker and darker, and Draco watched it lightly, without thinking too hard about it.
here. Why hadn’t the ministry allowed him to bring more of his things here? It just wasn’t fair that he was being expected to stay here without anything to do. Did they think that he was going to find some muggle hobbies or something?
There were various other instruments that Draco could only assume were for cooking in a drawer next to all this. Draco nervously prodded at the sausages with one of them, and they rolled over in the pan. Draco knew very little about cooking, but he did know that meat had to be cooked all the way through in order to eat it. With no magic, Draco didn’t want to think what getting sick from your food would be like.
But it didn’t look like the person was doing anything nefarious. Draco shrugged, and figured it was none of his business. Whoever it was had nothing to do with him, and likely it wouldn’t come round to affect him.
Once it began to feel like the sun was getting too much, and with no way to cast a sun-protection spell on his pale skin, Draco headed inside.
There were three people – an older couple, probably the same age as the rest of the guests here, and a young man, whom Draco would only assume was their son.
But he was still hungry, and the only thing he’d eaten was the chocolate. He couldn’t possibly be full just from that, he needed something more to fill him up properly.
Standing up carefully, and ignoring the slightly greasy and uncomfortable way his clothes uncrumpled off of his body, Draco made his way out of the living room, and went upstairs.
No, he wouldn’t need to think about that. The muggles would just have to deal with the very normal and rational way that Draco was going to live his life here.
Draco shrugged. “I’m not sure,” he said, hoping that being vague would mean she wouldn’t push him any more.
But it was late now, and despite his wakefulness, he needed to sleep. If he was to continue his routine of trying to live his best muggle life, he would need to be awake enough.
Draco swallowed, and brought out the hefty set of keys. He didn’t know what half of them were meant for, but what he did know was that the big silver one was meant for the front door of the house – the one in front of him.
Wasn’t that a rather personal question for her to be asking of a complete stranger? Draco didn’t know that he liked the idea of answering any of what she’d said. But then, if this was what muggles were like – and the mudbloods he knew certainly hadn’t made him think that any of them had any manners – then maybe he would simply have to get used to having his entire private life being dug into.
