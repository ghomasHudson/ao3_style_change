Draco was high on the knowledge that he was effecting Harry in such a way. He got to two fingers and looked up to catch Josh’s eyes, “Another, go a head and play with him a little more. Don’t make it too easy.”
. It was like… Little French cobble street, tea and toast and icing staining the corner of Draco’s mouth, and all that bright happy normalcy. But they were stepping into this claustrophobic alleyway, hidden away in the middle of all that sunlight, dark and gritty and
“Salazar, I bet I can make you come just like this. Won’t even undo your trousers, bet you’re dying, cock stuck behind your zip. So desperate.
Draco thrusted harder. He didn’t hear the door opening again, but he felt the bed dip at both corners near the headboard. Before he could untangle himself, he felt someone pull him roughly back into Nate’s chest. His own nipples were given a rough twist, more painful than what he’d done to Harry, causing him to moan and arch his back.
It was part of his and Nates dynamic that Draco rarely got rewarded. He liked it that way, asked for it back when they were still getting to know each other. He didn’t want to be given things easy, he didn’t want to be spoiled (he got enough of that when he was younger, it didn’t do him any favours). He wanted to work to a standard and be held accountable. He wanted to be hurt in all the ways he loved. He wanted to be cherished in the way that shows through discipline, rather than allowance.
Harry feels like he’s a hair’s pressure away from coming. Has never jumped so fast so many times between absolute indolence and tension.
Harry blushed, couldn’t help it when asked to admit what had so easily taken down his defences. “He promised to spank me later.” He said so with an embarrassed and defensive shake of his head, exasperated by himself.
It wasn’t that Harry wanted to be immune to Draco, or indifferent to him. But it’d be nice if he could decide for himself when to say no and when to give in.
“Wider” he says. And Harry does, back sinking into the brick. With one last suck, Draco leans back. The air that suddenly fills the space he’s left is cold but not dousing. And then it’s like Harry’s having flash backs to that Sunday so many weeks ago. Except this time he gets to
One such ritual was his weekly Sunday lunch to a little French wizarding village somewhere north of Paris, where he would eat the same salad and ratatouille dish at the same little French restaurant, walk the same little cobble-stone path to the same little French bakery where he
Draco usually tried to leave something out, like certain actions during the war that he regretted, or how he didn’t trust his father anymore. His crush on Potter. At first it was only because sharing really wasn’t his strong suit. Then it was because of the punishment that followed after his secret keeping, and the increasingly creative ways Nate would come up with to get the information out of him.
Draco pulls Harry down the stairs still in his stocking (not an issue for him) and in one of Josh’s t-shirts and pair of pants. He’s still stick with sex but doesn’t really care. Draco pushes Harry through the door of the kitchen (which Harry had to direct him to) and drapes his arms over Harry’s shoulders from behind.
Draco’s issues concerning the whole affair. But once the reminder of Potter and the war stopped sending him in a spiral, Nate never
Harry shook his head, Josh had fucked him enough times in the mornings for him to know he’d still be loose from the night before. It’ be a stretch, but it’s be an enjoyable one.
maybe… I’m really thirsty today. And it’s a bit chilly, so an extra cup of tea after lunch wouldn’t be uncalled for…”
“No. Can’t.” Harry shook his head like it was fogging up, Draco could relate. “Don’t really know him enough to anymore.”
But it was different now. Now Draco could recognize and direct that feeling. Could answer Harry’s desire (not for conflict any longer, but something else entirely) with his own.
He never really was a rule follower. Has always been driven by something more obscure and more fundamental than that.
“Harry? Seriously, are you ok? I didn’t mean to make you uncomfortable, didn’t think… we had dorm-mates for seven years, and- Harry?”
Harry was accidentally immersed, distracted by the cut Draco’s figure against the darkened brick, the almost invisible line of piss protruding from his form and splattering against the wall.
Draco brings him back with a gentle pinch over his chin, thumb and crooked forefinger of his right hadn’t (not the one still holding his cock, (

Josh nudged his side, but didn’t break Harry’s focus completely. “You never answered my question. Do you need to be punished?”
Also he wanted to watch as Harry almost fell asleep in his post-orgasmic haze while getting fucked forcefully by Josh.
Draco, quick as those whips he loves so much, places a hand over Harry’s mouth and under his nose and Harry thinks he could get out if he wanted to but doesn’t. They’re shrouded in shadows and so close no one could see anything even if they were standing right beside them and silently, invisibly, they watch two women pass beyond the sun-lit opening of the alley, completely unnoticed.

, one of the first times they’d gone out since moving back to London. Nate had told Draco he was speaking with someone he’d met that night about a group scene (he
“I’m sorry. I didn’t know. I wouldn’t have… If I did.” Draco (thank Merlin) wasn’t staring at his dick anymore. The confusion was gone, leaving behind something that looked like sympathy and understanding and clearly Draco knew something Harry didn’t because he still had no idea. He felt a hand close gently on his wrist, “Hey, it’s ok. OK?”
And Harry’s mind screeches to a halt once again. His eyes open from when they’d closed form the kiss. Draco’s biting his lip, suppressing a smile, successfully, but Harry can see it at the corners of his mouth and the glint in his eyes. He want’s to ask but stops when Draco’s eyes flick down.
He’s thinking about Draco’s prick soft and unassuming, now open to his line of sight, hanging out over the opening in his flies (no pants, typical) and under the shirt, tucked in, tails like open curtains tucked into his loose trousers. He’s thinking about the same posture Draco took last time, is taking now, loose and relaxed and almost blissful, with an undercurrent of anticipatory tension. Feet shoulder width apart, shoulders stiff, neck long and head tilted slightly back, hips jutted forward.
To get under his skin and prove he was the only one who could effect him so much. To be absolutely singular in his ability to get a rise out of Harry fucking Potter.
, but it felt like it. Draco’s stomach dropped out through the floor, his heart and lungs stopped all at once, and all the blood drained from his face. His vision tunnelled and darkened and his mind went completely blank.
The Dom’s did their aftercare bit, and they fell asleep like that, Harry and Draco, tucked in together, thoroughly fucked, a little bruised up in Draco’s case, and spunk dripping out of their arses and drying on their stomachs.
He really is so fucking grateful Draco’s so much taller than him. This kind of activity benefits so much from the improved angle.
He jumps, pulling his head away from Draco’s lips and hitting it rather roughly on the brick. “What-.”
Loved this dynamic they’d built together, he revealed in it and how well they knew each other. And all the way’s Josh was able to turn him on effortlessly.
Harry didn’t know what else to do, so he nodded, and tried to let go of some of the stiffness in his limbs. Then he took a breath and let Draco lead him home with another “ok.”
Draco asks again if he wants it, tells him to repeat his safeword, pulls Harry in slowly, with plenty opportunity to change his mind. He snogs Harry as he pushes him once again into the brick wall. Draco undoes his flies while Harry undoes his coat, and they snog a little more.
And then there were lips on his. Soft and sweet and plump and breathless only for a moment before Harry open his mouth with his own and slipped his tongue in deep. Draco let himself be taken for a second, savoured Harry’s wanting, plunging mouth, before giving back as much as he could. This wasn’t a Dom he was kissing, he didn’t have to submit, he didn’t want to. This was
Harry Potter walked into the room not five seconds later (he must have been waiting just around the corner, close enough to hear everything that was being said). His hands clasped behind his back, head bowed down, more submissive than Draco had ever seen him. He barely resembled the wild and willful boy from school.
Draco apparently to be cautious anyway, Harry discovered, when he slid two fingers into Harry. The soreness and sensitivity caused him to moan and clench around the fingers, hips moving more purposefully. And, ok, Draco wasn’t being
That’s when he realized exactly what was happening. Two Dom’s were leaning lazily against the headboard, hands resting over their tented trousers. And their eyes were trained on him. Every last trace of their attention was focused on every minuscule thing Draco did. He suddenly felt very much under evaluation. And what did they want from him? Something to do with the expensive bottle of lube sitting innocently on the bed.
many things at this point. Maybe the fact that Draco’s technically just broken the law in front of an auror, or how he’d
His lack of confidence kept him from moving after the order was given, so Josh reached for his aching prick, applied the condom and lube, and slid it between Draco’s cheeks himself. When the head caught on the rim, he gasped and Josh pushed him forwards by his hip so he slid right in.
And his mouth opens like sex, forehead wrinkled like pleasure, throat moves like a moan that never makes it to the surface.
The other man also took a seat in the opposite chair and nodded to Draco in acquiesce while looking at Nate. Nate nodded his go ahead and the other man addressed Draco directly.
Harry seemed dazed but took the hint all the same. He positioned himself on the (very large) bed, right in the centre on his knees. Having all three pairs of eyes on him made Harry shy again, but at Josh’s nod, he began moving his hips in slow sensuous figure eights.
Harry groaned and pressed his hips into the mattress in a thoughtless thrust. But the Doms weren’t here, theoretically, they could do whatever they wanted.
“Slow.” He says, pulling at Harry’s collar and Harry still doesn’t understand. Only recognizes the echo of what Draco had reassured him earlier about
Draco sighed and stretched a little, looking around the room in pleasant memory, “yeah.” His voice was breathier than before.
He looms. And Harry clutches at his arms while Draco gets everything in place. His flies are undone, his pants pulled down just past the root of his cock, hard and restricted, and then Draco’s is in there with his. Warm and soft and familiar and so,
allowed himself to indulge. More and more all the time. He always took a moment to savour it: the first bite of chocolate pastry or french truffle, the first slide of wine down his throat, of whiskey on his tongue, the first slide of his cock up Harry’s arse, the first stark sting of the whip, the first brutal impact of the paddle, the first languid slide of tongue.
They listen as the women’s voices fade, and then Draco’s kissing him again, and Harry doesn’t feel so cold anymore. His throat’ll be mottled before they’re done. The dizziness doesn’t go. All army can feel is the wall he’s sinking into, the body sinking into him.
Harry’s quivering with anticipation, but isn’t sinking into confusion or panic or submission the way he did the last two times.
And then the break, the hiss and splash and drip. The push as Draco rocked back onto his heels, the release at the back of his neck before his head swung first back then forward, and the lessening tension, shoulders to feet, while he settled into the rush.
thighs. And plump arse which was now getting squeezed in Draco’s hands. He dipped his thumbs into Harry’s crack (
“I want you to tell me. What you love about being a sub, what Josh does to you that makes you feel like you’ll never get enough. I want you to put it into words and say it out loud.
give out then. But only for a second, not enough to force him down, he bounces back and leans harder in to the bricks.
Harry gave a shrug and closed his eyes, sinking down into the mattress, determined to enjoy having a hand on his cock while he answered the question. “Josh got me into the scene, but our dynamic clicked almost right away. It was all a little inevitable, if I’m honest. I hate all the fame and attention and expectations of being
Draco was close again, right in front of him, concern on his face, mixed with confusion and hesitation and… fuck. Harry was still thinking about the puddle behind him. What was wrong with him?
As Draco opened his eyes he saw that Harry had come as well, his semen splattered between them. He was disappointed he’d missed it but the feeling didn’t quiet penetrate the haziness that came after a really good scene.
A moment passed where nothing happened, Draco looked up expecting to see Nate looking directly at him, instead he was looking at Josh, then turned to where Harry must have been… and what was that puff of air on his arse? Then Nate nodded and lowered his gaze to meet Draco’s.
“Don’t worry, I got you.” He reached out and took Harry’s hard cock into his hand, still slick with lube, and gave it a few slow pulls.
When Harry turned, Draco could see the dimples in his back beneath the hem of his shirt. His knickers (
The stream slows. Draco steps closer and it ends. Theres a puddle under their feet and Harry almost can’t think about it without his legs giving out, which…
Harry had let himself be pulled in without thought, not understanding why Draco had made the detour. They were just deep enough in to go unnoticed by a passerby when Draco let go of his wrist, still monologging about fringe or fabric cuts or something Harry couldn’t follow.
“Jesus.” He doesn’t use muggle swears often, knows they give him away. Can’t help it at the moment though.
They could have been at it for hours, completely lost in one another, forgetting entirely about their Doms watching, when Harry’s hands began wrapping themselves in Draco hair. One traveling down his neck and chest. Inching it’s way down Draco’s stomach to the hem of his pants. Draco moaned in encouragement.
Five days into the whole weirdness of it, Draco was being led through the floo after dinner at Nate’s on a Saturday, and he figured everything was about to come out into the open.
Harry’s arms weren’t tied, and his hands were clutching at the arm rests, but Draco saw them twitch, as if he wanted to cover himself. He also saw him shiver when Josh rubbed his thumb over the skin above Harry’s knickers in small circles and whisper something in his ear.
Once faced with a table full of brunch, and two amused looking Doms, Draco announces to the room at large, “We’re hungry.”
Harry swallows obediently, “You’re a shit” he says drily. Draco laughs. “You’d make a good Dom though.”
“Are you alright?” He spoke quietly enough that Draco knew the other’s couldn’t hear, the care and kindness in his voice was rare in a scene. Draco opened his mouth but remembered he hadn’t been given permission to speak. “You can speak babe, the scene hasn’t started yet.”
Draco’s dick is still out. Not as soft as it had been, but still held loose in Draco’s left hand and still… Wet.
him.” Draco almost couldn’t catch that, but when he did his breath caught. Josh’s hand was on Harry’s thigh now, rubbing over the lace.
Harry reached a hand out towards the bedside table, and summoned the lube he knew was in there, wandlessly and wordlessly. He tossed it back to Draco, face buried in the pillow.
Harry’s shyness was back, he looked down and hunched his shoulders as he opened his thighs to Josh’s prodding. The Dom’s hand slid upwards until his thumb and forefinger framed Harry’s tenting erection, like he was showcasing it. Draco moaned (not against the rules, he was awful at keeping them stifled, Nate couldn’t keep up with all the punishments) and Harry blushed in response, tucking his head into Josh’s neck.
While Harry wished Ron could have had a better attitude about the whole thing, the dinner went about as well as he could realistically have hoped.
He summoned his patronus to deliver the message. The brilliant white stag had the good grace--and a bit of cheek--to bow regally to Draco, who looked somewhat taken aback to be that close to the imposing construct. It turned its ghostly eyes to Harry, awaiting his instruction. "Tell Hermione: I'm safe. Shagging Malfoy. Neither one of us is dosed (I checked). Send help if you haven't heard from me by Tuesday."
Draco nearly howled at the idea of having to get up at such an ungodly hour... Until the last option. He considered it, shrugging eventually.
"Why don't you tell me more about your mum, for starters?" he prompted. "I didn't realize it was such good news, even though you'd said so. Honestly, it didn't sound that great to me."
What felt like an eternity later, they stood on the enormous home's front doorstep. Malfoy reached for the ornate handle, then hesitated.
Draco blinked as he was given the request. To say it was a surprise would be an understatement. Who knew Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived and Saviour of the Wizarding World, had a bit of kink to him? He considered it quite seriously for a few moments, but eventually--he grinned.
The feeling of sliding in and out of that tight, searing heat, locking gazes with Draco's deep, swirling grey, rubbing his palms over jutting hip bones... It was all so much better than he'd ever imagined. His health didn't seem more important than this.
And just like that, there went his libido--not the first time Hermione'd had that effect on him--and in its place bloomed guilt and shame. Always a fun combination after sex. Bloody buggering hell. Why hadn't he run the ruddy spells before doing anything with Draco? He'd known his behaviour was way out of character. This whole fucking masquerade was a terrible idea from the start. Hadn't he been saying that all along? People do bloody idiotic things when they feel anonymous. He was no exception, apparently.
7 is fine. I don't get off work until 6 so that will be perfect. Should I bring some leathers, food, anything at all, or just me?
It became increasingly difficult to stay quiet the longer Potter puttered about his living space. He began to worry the man would miss him entirely and go out into the castle for the remainder of the day, leaving him trapped and helpless in a place he really ought not to be. He was working through contingency plans when a surprised voice interrupted his thoughts.
Nevertheless, she blew him a kiss and sauntered to the weight bench, chestnut brown ponytail bobbing behind her. After selecting the lightest set of dumbbells, she caught Harry's eyes in the mirror and gave him a saucy wink. He snorted. George Weasley in a sports bra, she was.
Draco arched his back as it was touched and chuckled as his hips stuttered slightly from surprise. It was unexpected to be conducting a conversation while having sex, but of course that was
He came up short in his steps, halting suddenly and ducking behind a wall, hoping against hope he hadn't been spotted. Or heard.
Draco swallowed as he stared into Harry's unwavering eyes. He forced a laugh and shook his head a little.
, he choose not to say. "I left it in its box under my bed and hobbled around using the walls and furniture for support, too stubborn to do otherwise."
"Come here and make yourself useful," he instructed, holding the spatula out to Draco. "You just need to keep the food moving so it doesn't stick or burn. You can stand there looking pretty while you do it."
There was another bloody Devil's Snare near the wall that separated the table from the main garden. He torched it from a safe distance.
It was unrealistic to think that she could translate enough to begin developing an antidote that evening so the ask was not unreasonable. But still, it made him uneasy. Not that he doubted Granger's word.
Draco stood and shed his robes. What he wore underneath was a significant improvement in Harry's opinion. The shirt and slacks were somewhat reminiscent of their Hogwarts days but the colors had always suited him. The waistcoat, however, distinguished the outfit as that of a man rather than a boy. It emphasized Draco's long lines and slim waist and lent an air of sophistication to the ensemble. Harry wanted to pop the buttons open right then and there.
I still can't believe you left the bloody country to avoid me. I had hoped we would be able to talk about what happened between us like adults but seeing how well this conversation is going, I'm thinking that was overly optimistic on my part.
Draco wrapped the arm squeezing Harry's hip around his neck and into his thick forest of hair. He gripped it like a lifeline without tugging on it to avoid hurting Harry. His hips meanwhile thrust back onto the Auror's cock and then forward into the tight hand that held him.
He willed himself to relax and let Draco explore. There was no other way to find out for certain whether he liked it or not. One hand rubbed his back comfortingly while the other stroked and pressed light circles between his cheeks. Once Harry stopped freaking out about it, he determined that the sensation was decidedly not bad. It still felt odd to have his arsehole fondled, but it was also surprisingly sensitive in a way he felt low in his belly and sparking through his prick.
He sighed dejectedly and returned his attention to Ron, missing the fact Draco had glanced over his shoulder at him a moment before.
I am not allowed to work with any potentially dangerous ingredients, which is nearly all of them. Even such basic ones as frog's eyes are off-limits because they are poisonous (or can be depending on the species). Not to mention they took my wand and I am forbidden from casting spells with a replacement. It turns out house arrest really isn't much fun at all.
... Better than I imagined it would be... But if we continue my very heart-felt speech from before will have been a waste of breath. I doubt I'd let us leave the bedroom long enough for either of us to work, much less form a relationship."
Draco shook his head and planted an elbow into the table, despite the manners so thoroughly bred into him that screamed against such action. His cheek fell into his palm as his other arm remained in his lap.
Draco preened like it was a compliment. "One of a great many reasons you love me," he replied smartly.
"I do not like having my issues thrown in my face, my good news dismissed, my sexy time ruined, being treated like an annoying youth over curly things, and I certainly do
, but the denial left him with a barely supressed squeak (replaced with a shocked gasp) when his neck was played with again. And knowing Harry he would exploit that weakness whenever he could.
Which was irrational, he knew. Even with his perfect knowledge of the steps to brew the volatile potion and the process of reversal, it would probably be a full twenty-four hours before he had a working antidote if he were the one executing the task. Reason dictated he give Granger at least twice as long. And that wasn't accounting for translation time.
Before anyone could snap at the red-head, especially Harry, Draco planted a hand on his lover's shoulder and replied, "You are well deserved of such a jab, and perhaps you're right. But this dinner isn't about the past... It's about creating something better for the future. You don't have to like me, but at leat save the insults for when we aren't about to sit down for dinner, please."
"You should at least consider having some of mine. You're going to need your strength if we're to keep up the ambitious level of shagging you have planned," he smirked, then added, "
Never the less, he squeezed his insides and lifted himself a few inches into the air before falling back down in a slow, fluid motion.
Harry wiped the ketchup off his face without comment. Draco was saying something important and he looked so sad Harry's heart twisted in sympathy (and he felt like even more of a heel for his careless comment about Zabini).
He caught his rebellious eyes trying to wander over Malfoy's... unusual... outfit and coughed into his fist to cover it.
Draco shook with silent laughter and grinned as he stared down at Harry. He leaned forward to peck his lips before dipping lower to whisper in his ear.
"Good," he replied with a half-smile and a nod, stepping back a pace to give Malfoy room to breathe. "I'm going to hold you to that. And it's
Draco pulled most of the way out and thrust deeply once more, rocking Harry's whole body with the force of it. They groaned in unison. Beneath the hot sting was a blooming pleasure Harry knew would only intensify with time. He focused on that, on the feeling of his body stretching, opening to accommodate Draco's cock. That sensation was his favourite part of sex and the reason he bottomed more often than not; there was nothing else quite like it.
"The table is covered in food, so we will have to eat on the terrace. I haven't used it in years but I thought it would be nice since we didn't get to enjoy the Garden Room much. The balcony terrace itself isn't much, but I have let the backyard grow insane."
Harry quickly did up his trousers and extricated himself from Draco, turning to stand protectively in front of him. He kept a modest hand over his rapidly deflating erection. Molly ushered Ginny out of the room, Arthur frowned thoughtfully, and Andromeda covered Teddy's eyes. George shouted. Neville blushed. Dean and Seamus cackled. Luna smiled dreamily (saying something like, 'How nice') and Hermione appointed herself the spokesperson for the group.
Harry wasn't particularly close himself, but he got a good deal closer watching Draco take his cock in hand and wank as urgently as he was being fucked. It was the sexiest bloody thing he'd ever seen.
And I may own one or five pensieve memories of individuals who polyjuiced as the two of us for such sex industry things. I must say, it only proves how much we belong together--which is certainly not the product of a potion, my darling, cuddly, fluffy haired Gryffy-wyffy!
"So you figured out my little secret, eh? Just don't tell my father. At least not without me present. I want to be there when he has a heart attack over it."
His eyes flicked over the mess--which looked as though someone had cast a large expulso at Draco's wardrobe and desk--and took in the general decor.
He then offered his arm to Luna and the two walked out into the warm night together. Luna blew a final kiss over her shoulder (making her pickle earrings sparkle in the light) before shutting the door with an audible click. It seemed unusually loud in the silence that followed.
helpful today," he drawled, drawing each word out until it was practically a moan. "I'd like to show my appreciation. What's say we recreate your afternoon wank fantasy?"
Malfoy sprawled on the sofa like he was seriously considering a nap. The potion must be working, then. (It was a good one. Brewed by Hermione herself. She kept her boys well stocked in emergency supplies that could easily be picked up at the first aid station, but then they'd have to actually go to the first aid station and fill out paper work and make do with an inferior draught and that just wouldn't do.) Malfoy didn't even bother opening his eyes to answer.
Spluttering and disoriented, Harry stumbled out of his sleeping bag and drew his wand on an unseen assailant.
Forget the damn Seeker! Godrick. I shouldn't be allowed near a quill when I'm doped up on potions. Let's just pretend I didn't say anything about him at all, yeah?
Draco moaned softly as his mouth was dominated. He kicked his chair away from the table, somehow without breaking the kiss, leaving enough room in the seat for two. His hands curled into Potter's front pockets and pulled him sideways and forward until he had lap full of Auror. Both arms encircled the man and his kisses became more demanding, in case Potter was dumb enough to attempt escape. The curry was spicy and tingled along the thin skin of his lips. Potter, on the other hand, was a wonderful contrast--sweet like jasmine tea.
Draco's hands went to Harry's hips and held them down onto the couch firmly as his mouth wrapped around the head. He sucked, nipped, and licked at the sensitive foreskin as if it were a delicious lolly.
Potter pinched him on the shoulder but snuggled in harder as soon as it was done. Who knew the Saviour of the Wizarding World was such a Hufflepuff after sex?
He eyed the taller man surreptitiously as they made slow progress toward the appointment desk. With a limp that bad, a cane wouldn't be remiss, but he was not ready to broach the subject. Malfoy already bore more than a passing resemblance to his father--with his hair grown out and hanging loose about his ears, knocked free as it was by his exertions. At least Narcissa's graceful features lent him an air of elegance the senior Malfoy had never possessed. Always pretty, Malfoy had grown into a strikingly handsome man, time and trials etching character into a face that had once been unblemished porcelain. In spite of his infirmity, he carried himself with dignity and poise. What Harry once would have called arrogance, he now knew was something far more nuanced: that complex, compelling Pureblood pride that had enabled Malfoy to survive the unimaginable horrors he'd suffered at the hands of Riddle and his cronies.
were of the same persuasion. (And no, that excuse may be true but it is never particularly persuasive. Not in my experience, anyway.)
the potion. Merlin. Please tell me who your dealer was so I can have them shut down. Godrick knows the world doesn't need more Potter Polyjuice.
Draco accepted the glass as he set the binoculars aside. He wouldn't need them if it was a musical show (magical theaters often had great visuals to accompany music, and he supposed that muggles hadn't thought of such a concept yet.) He traded the flute into his left hand after giving Harry's glass a small tap, his now free right hand slipping casually onto Harry's thigh and squeezing.
Pansy, being a dear friend--and more than a little infatuated with me--was willing to assist me in maintaining the ruse as long as I wished.
When they stood a pace apart, he stopped to look Potter over, tutting as he did so. "I suppose this is what I get for inviting you over directly from work," he opined, neglecting to mention the man cut a mouthwatering figure in his leather jacket and snug-fitting denims. "Though would it kill you to wear something serviceable beneath your robes?"
Harry slid his hands from his pockets and hung them loosely by his sides. He tried his best to keep his stance and gaze relaxed as he watched what he could of Draco's ministrations and those long, elegant fingers curled around his zip.
Draco rubbed his face with one gloved hand. Eventually, he turned back toward Harry with a regretful smile.
Draco had turned back to stare among the party goers as he spoke; upon the word "forced" he seemed to lose his smile in favor of a grimace. Though, with a small pique if satisfaction, he did note a small number of curious on-lookers. Some turned away at being noticed while others just held their chins higher.
All things considered, Harry was in a rather fine mood when he arrived at the office, and the day continued looking bright...excepting an awkward 'don't ask, don't tell' moment at the outset when Ron had wondered what put that dopey smile on his face. They got past it.
"Barmy. You're absolutely bloody barmy," he proclaimed, twining his arms round Draco's middle. His tone was affectionate when he said it. "Of course you're trouble," he grinned. "You always have been. But I knew that going in. You think a little crazy is enough to scare me away when literal attempts on my life weren't?"
Before seating himself, Harry took a moment to look around the house. It was a sleek, modern, stylish bi-level. Quite unlike the interior of the Manor except in the exorbitant price-tags he assumed the furnishings had come with. There was a large black bookcase along one wall, filled to the brim with an assortment of thick, old tomes that would probably make Hermione drool. There was also a set of books on the mantle that looked to be new. He couldn't discern anything more about them from that distance but he'd try to get a peek at them later. He believed that a person's taste in literature said a lot about them (and tried not to apply that principle too strictly to himself when it came to his own choices of late).
"Yet, you don't mind flaunting it," Draco said with nothing less than absolute approval. He didn't bother to help with removing his own shirt, but Harry's? He grabbed Harry's T-shirt around the collar and ripped it open with another self-satisfied smirk.
"What do you mean my handholding qualities are terrible?" he demanded, affronted, as they walked along the street. "I held your hand the whole time before we got our food, even when Mike pulled a face."
The elf adjusted the knot of his pillowcase-cum-tunic from where it had slipped off one bony shoulder and glowered, the frightful expression incongruous with his tiny stature.
"Rather like being caught with your trousers down, isn't it?" Potter retorted archly, one raised eyebrow matching his tone.
Harry's face fell into the space between Draco's shoulder blades where he huffed hot breath and took in the scent of Draco's sweat mixed with some sort of (most likely expensive) cologne. He bit into the man's shoulder and closed his eyes tight to hold his orgasm at bay.
When a young, dark-haired man approached a moment later, the brilliant smile Malfoy flashed transformed his face completely. Harry's stomach swooped just as a bystander of that smile. When he recognized the man, however, the bottom of his stomach dropped out entirely.
one. Being a man whose teenage years revolved around destiny and fate, I am sure you'll run into that person one way or another. It might just take a while longer than you'd prefer. As for me, I had an engagement contract. Still do, technically, but considering both my actions and those of my father, the family is now (understandably) hesitant. I wouldn't have wanted to marry their daughter--a complete stranger--anyway. We are waiting to see what the verdict on that is once my house arrest is over, but I am hoping to buy them out. Which I can only do if one of our families violates the contract (by settling down with someone else, for example). It is a mess.
"This is going to sound really awful," he said regretfully, releasing Draco's back and preparing himself for a slap or hex, "but can I ask you a couple questions first? Somewhere more private, maybe?"
When he was sure Potter's attention was focused elsewhere, Draco pulled a strip of chicken free with his claws and attempted a dainty nibble. It wasn't long before he decided that table manners were more trouble than they were worth and dug in with both paws, chewing noisily (because there was simply no other way to do it).
Blearily Harry blinked up at the person-shaped silhouette looming above him as he fumbled for his glasses, the sun almost directly overhead.
He was about to find out. Minutes after the last letter was sent the floo turned green and expelled Draco into the downstairs living room. Despite their conversation, his last letter hadn't been... Entirely truthful. He was still wary of germs and the idea of kissing his sick partner was something he might have an issue with.
"Some night," he declared inanely, for want of anything better to say, as he flopped onto the sofa beside Draco (who scoffed in response). "How does that expression about 'best laid plans' go?" he asked. It was rhetorical.
We've all done things we're not proud of--some of us more than others, sure--but if we can't move forward and put the past behind us, then what are you even doing here? I mean, isn't that the point?
If Draco hadn't already known he was utterly and irrevocably gay, that sight would have settled it for him--there could be no going back to women after something like that. He was exceedingly grateful that Potter was making enough noise to cover up the eager trills and purrs he couldn't seem to smother. Damn potion. He would need to consider this experience when crafting the warning label.
While I am able to have (almost) anyone I want, I haven't actually done so. You and Pansy make me sound like a shameless rake. I am more discerning than that.
He sat back with his own glass, sampling the rich red Draco ordered for them. It was earthy with a hint of berry, not too sweet. He liked it.
He idly wondered at what point he should worry if all his best sex happened to take place with a bloke...
Needless to say, Draco bought every copy he could (all of them) and bribed the paper to keep their mouths shut and not print anymore. Both to save Potter from more humiliation and to keep those details to himself as much as possible.
"I believe it is time for me to take my leave, Malfoy," he said as the dance came to an end. "Fun as this has been," he added sardonically, releasing his unusual dance partner and bowing with his forearm braced across his stomach, according to the custom.
"I can't wait to try the chocolate next," Draco murmured as he swallowed. "Delectable idea to order both! Glad I thought of it."
Draco was so grateful he could cry. ...Possibly. He wasn't sure that ferrets had tear ducts. Regardless, he leapt off the sofa before he could think better of it and twined himself around Potter's legs in thanks.
Harry snorted. "Something special, hm?" He twined a bit of Draco's hair around a (clean) finger and tugged playfully. "And how should I position myself for this 'something special'?"
He probably shouldn't have been as pleased by it as he was. Regardless, Harry felt a little thrill that Malfoy wanted his help badly enough to admit he had been an unpleasant arse for much of the past hour.
"Could it have something to do with you punching Blaise Zabini last night? Or the several kissing, arm crossing, hand holding, or cuddle walking pictures? You're all over the paper--front page news," Ron spoke in a tone between angry and amused. Angry because he felt like this was somehow Malfoy's fault (bad influence, that one) and amused at the idea of uppity Zabini having his egotistical face smashed in.
"I'm glad," Draco kissed his cheek, his temple, and then his neck. Each time his lips rained down was slow and had an added suckle. "I finished my next book. Would you like to read it before it's even published? I kept a copy of it just for your perusal."
"Oh, I'm being completely serious. Why do you think I haven't bothered to tuck myself away? Or you, for that matter," Draco spoke casually as he shuffled about until both their flaccid pricks were laying side by side in their laps. He snuggled in nice and close after pulling Harry out from under him, which caused their pricks to be squished between their torsos. He hugged Harry's neck tight and pecked at his lips while deliberately rubbing their hips together.
Draco came out with just 15 minutes remaining before their reservation, wearing a set of light-weight pale blue robes. He ran a hand through his hair to smooth it one last time, quickly shutting his bedroom door before descending the short staircase.
He'd never been with someone who got him so excited with words alone. But then, Draco'd been doing that for the last year without either of them realizing it with his books.
Having his desire satisfied left him feeling energized and needy for more (versus Harry's post-orgasm languor, which apparently left him tired and lazy). He was already licking his way into the Auror's partly open mouth.
At least the desk is clean now, which I do appreciate. I've been meaning to do that for a year. I usually clean it during Spring but I was caught up with work.
Harry chuckled at the name calling. He wouldn't change it for a thing. It was so Draco--his sweet and sour Slytherin Prince.
"Trying to help yourself to some dessert, more like," Harry quipped, inferring that the terror had--not for the first time--used the cupboard shelves as steps to reach the off-limits treat. Said shelves were currently a jumble of splinters and cockeyed boards hanging past the gaping wooden door.
"We will speak more later," the eldest Weasley said with finality, rising with difficulty from the chair. He seemed to have aged five years in the span of the conversation. "I am going to take Molly and Ginny home and see if I can't talk some sense into my children." He shook Harry's hand in farewell, adding, "I expect you at family dinner next Sunday." He looked thoughtfully at Draco next. "I don't think it would be advisable to bring a guest then, but perhaps the dinner after that."
He took a large swallow of whiskey and let the burn clear his mind. He was only thinking about Malfoy because of the case. That was it. His brain just got confused, is all.
Draco winced. It shouldn’t fucking affect him. It shouldn’t, so why did it hurt? He clenched his fists to the side, and exhaled unevenly as he asked, “Why?”
He was growing a lot more frustrated than he had been. Harry hadn’t used even one of the pet names since yesterday. Not a single pet name. “Are you mad at me, Potter? If you are, I’m sorry –
“Yeah, I figured that out as well.” Harry said, sighing softly. It was radiating magic. Yet, it wasn’t familiar to him. He couldn’t quite understand it. He wanted to know more. Yet, he knew that he couldn’t get out of here. “You shouldn’t be here, Malfoy.”
Harry turned to the blond with a faint smile and he recalled the fairy-tale he had read in the night, when he was six out of the book of fairy-tales in the cupboard and started to recite it. “
He was on a severed Island with Draco Malfoy. Death would’ve been a fantastic option. Not that Lucius had asked. He had been rather intent on sending Harry to Otryazan, and signing up for his own death in the process.
Draco gaped at him. He would certainly remember if he let Harry Potter into the Slytherin common room. He arched an eyebrow at the brunet. “I didn’t.”
“You own a Firebolt,” Malfoy retorted, yet it wasn’t laced with venom. It was a banter. A small, light-hearted banter. Perhaps an unbelievable headline for the prophet. “If you didn’t, it would’ve been fair.”
“Yes,” He said with a brief smirk, yet it was enough to cause a flicker of irritation within Draco. “it appears we’ve deterred from the actual conversation – no, retort-fest – and reached to the conclusion that you’re a bore.”
He dismissed his thoughts. He didn’t want to stress over the questions he didn’t have answers to. And the truth about his father’s actions would be terrifying. He would never be ready for the truth. Never.
“Okay, truce,” Malfoy said, with a short laugh. It caused another fucking flutter, and a flicker of warmth with a small smile grazing his lips. “It was amusing to disrupt the Quidditch match.”
It was certainly a strange week. He was on an Island, with Draco Malfoy. A severed Island. He didn’t have a wand, and the simplest wandless spells were draining him and he couldn’t even get started on the crepes or the recent events. It was sort of an odd dream.
Ever the noble chosen one, who didn’t even waver while draping the cloak over Draco and it was certainly a cause for concern. “
“I’m glad we cleared it out,” Draco said underling the words with a glare and placed the cup on the counter, fidgeting with it. “now, what’s is that thing?”
“I want it,” Draco whispered with the venom laced in the voice, eyes fixed on the artifact, the corner of the mouth curling into a sneer. His fingers flexed. “only for a minute –”
“For the record,” Malfoy said, underlining the words with a warning glare, but it failed to hold the intended effect on him. “it was supposed to be a sarcastic statement and not a compliment.”
Draco cracked a small, brief smile. Perhaps, he could forgive Harry Potter. Once. It might cause trouble. Yet, he could risk it. Once. “Right, what high praise out of your mouth.”
He practiced a bit of wandless magic. A simple levitation charm on the teacups and the novel. It was sort of complex with objects that weren’t Steve the seashell. He couldn’t direct the magic. It was almost chaotic.
Panic engulfed his mind; his heart hammered in his chest so hard it could have shaken the whole place. All rational thoughts were drowned out by his pitiful, rasping breaths and his vision began to blur. The anxiety battled ferociously, waxing and waning in intensity, threatening to overpower him one moment, and reducing the next as his knees dropped to the ground. He never remembered being so cold.
Harry chuckled, as Malfoy turned an interesting shade of crimson. Maybe it wouldn’t hurt to be around Draco Malfoy for a while.
With a faint chuckle, Harry opened the front door. It created a soft creaking sound. The candlelight added a warm glow to the living room. Draco flicked his wand to the grate, igniting it. “Can you quit cursing in French?”
“You’re supposed to be indebted – oh wait, you could cover your debts if you quit failing at teaching to produce a corporeal Patronus, Potter.” Malfoy said, yet the brunet didn’t react to it. “I – what?”
“Right,” He secured it with a soft nod. It was fair. “for what it’s worth,” Draco refused to even glance at Harry while he said, “I shouldn’t’ve touched the artefact without an idea of what it was.”
"Honestly, love, you should've seen the look on his face; poor bloke was shitting bricks." Gasped out by Harry between wheezes and Draco was laughing along just as hard. His wheezes simmered down to giggles while watching Draco, having the ability to make his angel laugh uncontrollably without any inhibitions would still be one of Harry's proudest achievements.
’ and focused on the slow twinkle of the stars. He was sort of astounded that the brunet figured out what the night sky is the reminder of, considering he was quite oblivious.
“No, I wanted to inherit the Malfoy fortune.” Draco murmured with a small shrug, fidgeting with the sleeve of the white sweater.  “write a book, perhaps or –” He had a familiar impish glint in the eyes, which wasn’t a good sign. “or start a
Harry snorted, and gave a slight shake to his head. He wasn’t wrong. Yet, as reluctant as he was to tell him he had to. He couldn’t risk Malfoy invading his head. He had secrets. Besides, it was too dark in there – His years with the Dursleys, and the deaths he had to witness.
If he was the night sky, and the stars were the ones around him, he didn’t want to hold the weight of those stars. He didn’t have everlasting stars in the sky – It wasn’t the silver, small speckles he feared.
Christmas had approached quickly and they had hardly had any time for themselves with both of them working endlessly. They were currently strolling through Muggle London, their fingers intertwined. Snow had started falling the moment they stepped outside, adding to the Christmas spirit.
"Pansy –" Draco warned and directed a sharp glare towards her, which she returned with a similar intensity. "can you not –”
He couldn't confess that he wanted to. Or that it wasn't for tonight. Yet, he couldn't find the words. Perhaps, it was purely platonic and he didn't want to screw it up. Not now.
“Fucking fantastic.” He received a pointed glare in response to the cursing, which was sort of fair, considering Malfoy wasn’t swearing for once. “I can swear if I want to, considering I’m refraining from the retorts.”
He had perfected the levitation charm and it felt fantastic. He was content with the little progress. Hermione would’ve been insanely proud. And Ron would’ve been Ron about it.
“I can toast a bread without burning it, Potter.” Malfoy said while folding another crepe, placing it on a plate and drizzling it with a bit of chocolate syrup. “Plus, I want you to be confused.”
It was Steve The Seashell – the one he had levitated countless times and he was certain that Steve was directing curses or pleading the brunet to quit with the levitation. “Ste – erm – the red one?”
Draco scoffed, muttering a few curses in French which was an incentive to rile him up or to earn a reaction out of Potter, yet the brunet was only shaking his head in wry amusement. “so, now the curses don’t affect you?”
“No, Malfoy.” Malfoy visibly flinched at the loud, harsh voice. “when did you ever provide one reason – only one fucking reason – to trust you?”
” Potter said with an uncertain edge to his voice, carding his fingers through the jet-black hair to tame it. A vain effort. “I – I want to focus on the complex ones.”
“Sure, we were.” He said in a slow, sarcastic drawl. “Now, why don’t you continue to figure out how to return to the shire and defeat the wicked witch of the west, Frodo?”
“I’m sorry Draco. I’m still new to this. I’m ready and willing to learn. Don’t give up on me. I need this. I want to please you. Let’s play this out for the rest of the weekend. For real. No breaking the scene. Just show me your true Dom self for two full days, and I’ll prove to you how good of a submissive I can be.”
He felt a little more like himself and thought of everything Harry said, no longer knowing if he should hex the man or hug him, for getting him his job back. He was torn. If he tortured him into madness, he would never be an auror again.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Astoria stood like a statue at her spot at the table. Her eyes were glued to her plate. Draco walked over to her, staring at her face, but she didn’t look up. When he got close enough to touch her, he lifted her chin towards him to see her eyes. They were very watery. As he watched, a single tear trickled down her left cheek.
He cursed himself as he gathered his case files, preparing to floo into the ministry. On top of losing everyone he cared about, work was going to be absolutely dreadful. Being around Harry was sure to be intolerable.
Astoria began to cry. Tears were always his weak spot. It used to shred his heart watching his father, often, bring his mother to tears.
Draco pulled away after a moment and rolled his eyes. He put his boxer briefs on and got out of bed, turning his back to Harry, to hide a smile. He could get used to waking up like this.
Draco opens his eyes and Harry almost blows at the lust he sees inside them. Lust and something else. The room starts shaking, Harry’s accidental magic. It’s Harry’s turn to close his eyes, but Draco keeps making these low “uh, uh, uh” sounds that are driving him to the edge. He’s gripping Harry’s forearms tightly. “Uh” every time Harry hits his prostate, and Harry drives into him harder, faster, until Draco is writhing through his orgasm. Cum oozes out of his pink cock down the sides of his rigid shaft.
After he picked up lunch, he was standing in a long line to pay, daydreaming of last night’s intense lovemaking, when he was suddenly followed in line, by none other than Blaise Zabini.
Harry seemed to enjoy this and lay back on his hands, accidentally brushing Draco’s shoulder this time. Draco bristled as he felt another tingle.
Of his delicious white knuckles gripping his chair arms as he blows into his mouth— and can’t help needing to suck him again.
Today, he feels nearly sick over the thing he can’t do for him, over his lingering issues with Blaise. Over the reassurances he can never seem to give him. His cold exterior and brooding nature are warring on him. He’s worried Harry is going to get tired of this. When he leaves, he’ll have a gaping hole to patch up, and he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to. Thing is, he doesn’t care anymore.
There were gasps and murmurs all around them. This happened in front of the majority of the Ministry of magic employees, as almost everyone was in the atrium for lunch.
Harry leads him carefully into the bedroom—where they’ve been sleeping the last two nights with Harry angled away so he won’t “tempt them” with his cock. As if Draco’s not hard as granite, too.
Sighing miserably, Draco pulls him up on his knees so that Harry’s straddling him and hugs him. He’s trembling and Draco feels wretched inside. He needs to take care of this any way he can.
Draco stood up quickly, staring down, disdainfully, at Harry’s kneeling figure. Finally, words came to him.
After lunch, they chatted on the couch. Harry told him about his disturbing childhood and Draco’s heart broke. It was hard to believe that the confident brutish man before him was once a neglected, underfed, and under-loved child who was forced to sleep in a cupboard. It made his heart expand for him, even more.
“Yes. I’ve been thinking, I have a lot of connections in the BDSM world, I can get you together with the right kind of Dom.” Blaise raises his eyebrows.
Draco rolled his eyes, but it was too dark for Harry to see. Even if that weren't the case, he was too busy unbuckling Malfoy’s trousers, and pulling them down, along with his boxer briefs, to notice.
“Not to mention the fact that we’re both still married. The media would go into a frenzy if they ever caught wind of this, which they undoubtedly will. You are followed everywhere you go by cameras and fans. The newspapers would crucify me, and my family would pay the price. This thing between us is just an impossibility, for so many reasons. I hope you can understand that.”
Draco pulled him over his knees by his arms, tipping him over to arrange him so that his ass was presented high in the air, with Harry’s head down by the floor, his feet off the ground, so he could get no leverage to push himself up. He pinned Harry left arm between their bodies and grabbed his right wrist twisting it up behind him and holding it at the small of his back.
“Hey. Don’t give me that look. I’m not ‘with’ Potter. Don’t be silly. Why don’t we get together next Wednesday after drinks at the club?”
When he was finished preparing him, he jumped to sit on top of him, straddling his lower back, facing towards his ass. It was raised and spread open completely, cum licking the rim. He squeezed it in his hands, rubbing his left over cum all around the rim and dipping into his hole. His spit on his hole, mixing the spit with his cum and continued to dip inside with his fingers. It was warm and wet. Draco groaned and slapped his ass hard, rocking on top of him. His cock was painfully hard again, but this needed to be done.
“Okay…think you’ve had enough. You smell like the three broomsticks,” He pulled Draco up into his arms like he weighed nothing. The bottle swung lamely from his hand, and Draco dropped it. No matter, Neech would take care of it.
“She knows about us. She knew it was me in the papers. She also knows about Blaise. I think she’s stealing money from me, to support her lover.”
Harry backed up so that his bare ass lay against Draco’s soft cock. Draco was beyond depressed by his mopey thoughts this evening. Nothing could make him rise to the occasion, but he tried to sooth Harry, as best he could.
Draco looks at Harry, taking in his worried, vulnerable expression. It takes a minute to understand what it means through his alcohol addled brain, then it dawns on him.
“Nothing for me, thanks.” And there’s a long stretch of silence. It’s terribly awkward, and Draco wonders what she’s doing in his home. Just when he’s about to ask, she speaks.
It’s the weekend and there’s suppose to be a full moon tonight. It makes him think of Harry, like everything else does.
When he moved his chair back to get up to wash his hands, Harry grasped his hand on the table to stop him.
It’s not as if it was his very first time. Blaise had tried in the past, but he joked that he liked making Draco do all the work. That had been ten years ago. It was practically a virgin hole, once more.
Draco dips his head under this time, desperate for the silence of an underwater world. He stays there a long time, holding his breath. He wonders if he could drown himself to put himself out of this misery. Harry’s preoccupation with Blaise is like a dark cloud over his head. Suddenly, a memory of Blaise floats to the surface from long ago. After a full minute, Harry pulls him up from the water roughly.
Draco just stared at him blankly, with a flat expression. The man stood up and walked to the bathroom that was not far away. He rose his eyebrows suggestively at Draco and walked through, letting the door close softly behind his perfectly round ass. Putting down his paper, Draco took this private moment to grasp his hair, pulling painfully. He was being tempted, yet again.
“I’m thinking about the awful thing I’ll have to do if David isn’t enough. I’ll have to hurt him, Harry.”
Draco saw him savoring the flavor like it was treacle tart and almost came right then. He flipped Draco around so that he lay flat on his stomach and quickly climbed atop, lying flush with his back.
Draco’s hands were shaking. He couldn’t bring himself to read the article, but he didn’t need to. The picture said it all. It took up most of the page. Him and this Jacob fellow were posing together outside of the posh restaurant,
“Oh Draco, Oh Draco!” and then he felt Harry cumming, squeezing his cock and pushing him over the edge as well.
“I thought about how we used to hold our breath underwater to see how long we could kiss without air. Do you remember?”
Draco feels like he’s being stretched apart…torn to pieces. There’s a part of him that fucking loves him. His stupid heart swells up and bleeds for him because he’s stupid, and he’s Harry, and being near Harry makes him dumb. Another part of him that has more sense knows being here with him is not healthy.
Harry suddenly started to panic, internally. Blaise was right. Draco thought their sex was boring, vanilla and ‘lovely.’ He would soon tire of it. He needed him to think their sex was dirty, raucous, and desperate.
Though Draco allowed himself to be the bottom for Harry, and Harry alone, he would never, ever be his submissive.
He jumped off the bed to stand behind him and breached his entrance slowly, sliding all the way in and paused. He stroked his beautiful pert ass cheeks, now blanched an angry red from his harsh slaps, in an attempt to sooth him. He caressed his wide open thighs, his hands catching on rope.  After leaning forward slowly, to kiss his back lovingly, he abruptly stood up and began ramming into him, hard and fast, without mercy.
Blaise never got tired of the image as Draco’s cock was the most beautiful thing that he had ever seen, thick, sizable,
“Feel free, Astoria. In return, I’ll be forced to tell the aurors that you’ve been embezzling money from me, for five years, to sustain your lover’s gambling addiction. You’ll be thrown into Azkaban.”
He kicks his legs apart to get in deep and starts fucking him languidly, slipping his hands under Harry’s chest and over his shoulders, leaning his cheek against Harry’s back. His warmth is like a tonic for his sad soul.
“That’s good,” Draco whispered, stroking into him and then back out, the friction and heat exactly what he needed.
Draco had lost control last night and was plagued with guilt. Harry was asking for it, but he should have just walked out of that house, any way he could, before allowing this to happen.
They say their vows up on the yacht’s deck late the following night, with no one listening but the ocean waves. They go to sleep wrapped in each other’s arms and wake up the same way to a golden morning.
Draco hesitates for just a second before wrapping his arms around him. His back muscles tremble, cool, and thick against his chest.
“Yes there were times, I'm sure you knew. When I bit off more than I could chew. But through it all when there was doubt. I ate it up and spit it out. I faced it all and I stood tall. And did it My Way.”
He remembered it all, with a pang of regret. It got Draco off to make him fall apart under his hand. It made him feel powerful, in control, like nothing else ever could. After fifteen years of play, he knew exactly which buttons to push and how. He could make Blaise cum just by his words alone. He had made it too good for him to give up his claim.
After a few minutes, he was painfully hard. This was not good. He needed to be in control of his desire to properly punish Blaise.
Harry’s kneeling on the floor in from of him. Their eyes catch and hold, and he thinks…he looks sad. Or maybe somber. What he
When he arrived at the club, Blaise had not arrived yet. This angered him. Blaise was never late. He knew Draco hated waiting, but wait he did, until fifteen minutes later, when Blaise deigned to show up.
“Forget what I said. I apologize. I would just like for things to continue as they are. Please, darling? For Scorpius.”
“I don’t really know. I managed to stun all the wolves in one go. It must have hit you too. I called in more aurors to help. They should be here any minute.”
Draco considered him, in his sorry state. He remembered the abuse he suffered at the hands of that vicious Dom and was afraid he would go back to a similar situation. No matter what Blaise had done to him, he didn’t deserve that. He needed this. Draco would deliver his punishment and be on his way. He clutched his arm and apparated both of them to Blaise’s manor, just to be safe. He couldn’t risk Harry walking in on them.
He stormed into his room, one hand in his hair, trying to pull it out. He dressed in his robe, filled a glass with firewhiskey and went out onto the balcony, slamming the French doors behind him. It seemed like it was Harry’s goal in life to drive him stark raving mad. He felt like a raw nerve, frazzled and helpless. Edging into madness on lack sleep, lack of power, and a shattered sense of self. He felt worthless, filled with shame and remorse over his part in the war, thanks to Harry’s reminder.
Blaise’s fingers were daringly caressing his lower abdomen softly now, underneath his shirt. He moved closer behind Draco who could now feel his fully erect cock against his backside.
Draco stared at her and remained silent. He was dumbstruck by how many details she knew about his life and at the volume of her voice. He didn’t know it could get that high.
Draco casually began to undress, pretending not to notice the distress of his poor Harry. Tonight, it was he who wore a leather harness under his clothes. This was a more intricate one that left his cock free and crisscrossed all over his body, including his legs. The black paired erotically against his pale skin, and part of it went around his neck as well. Harry gasped when he was completed disrobed. He was already fully erect.
He kissed and sucked at his entrance, with abandon. That secret spot was so sensitive, full of nerve endings, and every single one fired with pure pleasure. His cock began to harden to full mast under Harry’s ministrations, especially when he began thrusting his fingers inside, opting to prepare him the manual way, instead of using magic. He pushed down on his prostate and lapped the rim with his tongue, moaning throughout, almost triggering Draco’s orgasm.
‘Lovely,’ Draco thought. The man couldn’t even be bothered to wear a shirt, insufferable, pompous, prick that he was.
As Harry regains his strength, he makes several changes. The first of which is bringing his kids over while Draco is there. Scorpius comes to Grimmauld Place as well, and they spend many evenings together, laughing, talking, playing exploding snap. Sometimes they come over in the afternoon, and the entire family flies together in a home game of quidditch. It reminds him how wonderful a father Draco is; he’s so good with them, and Scorpius dotes on him more than ever. Scorpius, James, Lily, and Albus get alone swimmingly. The kids are over almost every night, and Harry doesn’t know what’s been holding him back from doing this sooner. Fear, maybe, that Draco would leave him. But that’s completely gone now.
He floo’d directly to Blaise’s after work, without calling first. It had been a little over a month since the last time he was here. It was a far cry from the four times a week that had been occuring before this.
Draco realized how insufficient an explanation that really was. It sounded pathetic coming out of his mouth.
Warm relief gets him grinning as he strides to the bed to find Harry on his back with his cock out, pointing to the ceiling. His body is bathed in a silver sheen from the moonlight streaming in.
He slapped his face to snap out of it. He still felt drunk, but he knew the alcohol had to be out of system by now.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows, remembering that the ‘something’ that suddenly made him so understanding about Blaise’s rash act, was unforgettable sex with Harry.
“You belong to me whether you’re wearing my collar or not,” Draco said, sweeping his boy into a ferocious hug, unable to withstand the sight of Harry’s distress any longer.
He ended up finishing his entire plate and could have gone for seconds but did not want to give Harry the satisfaction.
He took the steps two at a time to get to his room. He hurried inside the bathroom and locked the door quickly, warding it with extra locking charms so that Harry wouldn’t be able to come in.
sometimes his cock feels monstrous inside, but oh, so good. He relishes the initial sting and the feeling of fullness. This is the only way he feels complete, and he can't believe he hasn't been insisting Draco top him all along. He begins pounding his ass mercilessly. No warm up. The rickety desk shakes underneath him. Harry tries hard to hold back his gasps and moans but he can’t. He’s gripping the edge of his desk for dear life, his cheek scraping against the wood with each of Draco’s punishing thrusts. He feels assaulted and he’s loving ever single filthy moment of it. As he tries to reach down to stroke his cock, Draco angles his cock directly on his prostate and a jet of precum spills forward.
Blaise sat back in his chair, contemplative, attempting to hide a sly smile. But he couldn't hide his movie-star smile if he tried. His perfect teeth glittered in the dim light of the club, and Draco immediately knew he made a grave mistake. He just showed his cards. Blaise will be even less inclined to break the contract now. His control was slipping because he hardly slept at night.
Then there was another kiss, on his neck and a “Sorry, I’m told I can be a selfish lover” into his ear.
Laying there, staring at a naked, willing and gorgeous man, in the same bed.” Harry played it up a little, fluttering his eye-lashes a little, and looking up at Draco through them. “And you haven’t even touched me yet.”
was the boy Draco knew. Not submissive and passive and dainty, but fiery and filled with passion and determination. He looked at Draco like he was daring him to deny it. And Draco felt the same energy rise in himself in return, the same willful desire to be contrary for the sake of it. The same old need to
Draco was lax, drowning in sensation, getting fucked open by Nate’s larger than average penis, feeling full and hot with the friction of it. Harry grounded him and reigned him in by his wrists. And it was a bit of a mind fuck to be Dommed through a sub by his Dom. Thinking about it made him revel in it. And being forced to stare at Harry through a good fucking that
He can still smell Draco, all down the wall, itching behind the shallow and sensitive curves of his knees, wet under their feet, clinging to the head of his hard and red prick. He’s chocking on his own saliva. His cock might be going numb.
“Remember to safeword if you need to.” Draco nodded. Nate sat back in his chair looking pleased, “I think Harry needs to tell us bit about what he thinks of all this.”
as disappointing as Harry might have expected)). Harry opens his eyes, and Draco is looming again. Leaning in a kissing him just as deep and desperate as earlier. His tongue feels foreign and improper after what had just happened. What still is.
With excitement thrumming through his heart, Draco jumped across the bed to push Harry sideways onto his back. From there he could press his hands to Harry’s chest, slide them indulgently down his torso and grip his hips, feasting on the visual or Harry Potter’s prick, there for the taking. Then he glided his fingers down his thighs and caught the knickers around his knees. He slipped them off Harry’s feet and, while staring directly into Harry’s eyes, raised them to his face a took a whiff, moaning at the smell of B.O. and pre-come.
Harry follows and almost loses strength in his neck from the slight tilt forward. Recovery’s going to take the rest of the day at this rate.
). But Draco knew he didn’t have permission to speak yet, besides, his inquiry must be as obvious as the panic he’s stamping down.
They weren’t thinking this through, everyone in the place must be wondering how he was slick enough, why Draco could get away with fucking him without a condom (as magic rendered STI’s harmless).
Draco leaned down, but Harry didn’t open his mouth obediently when Draco pressed his fingers to it the way he suspected he would for Josh. So Draco leaned down further and bit at his nipple, made sure not to be gentle about it. As expected, Harry let out a surprised shout and Draco used the opportunity to stuff the knickers in. In the next moment something landed with a thump next to the hand holding Draco up.
“Would you feel this?” Suddenly the warm breath was gone from his ear, and the bed shifted. The thumb on his arse wasn’t pushing anymore, but pulling so he was spread and exposed. A tongue pressed itself where the thumb had been, hot and heavy and… temporary. Harry moaned from the lick and moaned again when it was gone, replaced with a waft of cool air, right over the now damp skin of his arsehole. Draco was blowing on him… playing with him.
gets the view of the front and not just the back. Unrestricted to dark silhouettes and gaps in imagination
But Harry saw something calculating in his eyes every time they turned towards each other to begin the double-apparition back, Draco’s hands on his arms and gazes locked. Grey eyes sparked and smouldered with some kind of understanding Harry himself didn’t possess.
, and then remembers it’s not that kind. Draco has evolved from rutting against Harry’s stomach to wanking off on his shirt. He’s still going, but only just barely, when Harry realizes what the movement over his abdomen is. Is awake enough to be annoyed about the splatter on his shirt just before it happens.
He can’t. All he’s thinking about is the hot-cold-wet-dry-hard-soft sensations absolutely steeping him. He’s dizzy with it. Can fucking smell the thing.
He could see Draco tip his head back, the stillness of his chest as he held his breath for a moment, the tension in his shoulders, his hips jutted forward, his calves under his loose, fitted trousers. Harry could have told anyone that Draco was a bit of a hedonist. Enjoyed the things he allowed himself to indulge in immensely.
There was a sofa and two dark-brown leather chairs angled towards each other on either side of the fireplace. Nate led Draco over to one after he and the other man (Dom?) finished greeting each other. Nate took a seat and Draco kneeled. His wrists were already tied behind his back, albeit a touch looser then was the norm with them, so Draco could move around and his wrists weren’t in danger of chaffing. But having them in place kept him in the submissive mindset.
, or whatever bullshit their calling it now. With Josh, everything’s easy. I’m treated like something small and fragile and special, and not something big and important and immortal. I think I’m not noteworthy with him, and I feel more valuable because of it.” Harry was getting close again, voice deepening. Draco’s hand slid up and down his prick, twisting at the head and squeezing at the sensitive parts. “Also, I love it.” He laughed a little, realizing he’d repeated back to Draco what Draco had said.
He almost missed the signal Nate sent their way when a particularly nervous sub was finishing up with Draco’s arse under the harsh hand of his Dominatrix. But he did see it, and the next thing he knew, Josh was nudging him to standing and across the room. His arse was sensitive after being stretched open for so long, it twinged with every step. His cock hadn’t had a chance to go down either, not with the constant view of Draco’s arse getting filled by various bodies.
Ok, Harry could do three. One: “He… he makes me all these clothes and dresses me up, but not because I like it so much, though I— I do. He does it to show me off and… and because I’m his, and he can do what he want’s with me.” Harry felt Draco shift and opened his eyes to see he’d ducked down so he was eye level with Harry’s prick.
The implication made Draco whip his eyes over to his Dom, he was smirking, that’s never a good sign. Draco pictured himself laying down as Harry had, so Harry could do to him what Draco and done to Harry. But it didn’t feel right. His self control wasn’t as good as Harry’s, he could tell that obviously just watching the other man. He opened his mouth, but closed it again in hesitation. The scene had obviously begun a while ago, was he still allowed to speak?
“Downstairs, making breakfast, they left just as I was waking up. Nate always makes me breakfast the morning after.”
“It’s just that the wall is so cold and hard and unreceptive. I thought I might appreciate somewhere a little warmer to… let go.”
Harry groaned, his arse tightening around where Josh’s prick was snug inside it. Josh mirrored his moan and whispered “I love when you massage my cock.” as he mouthed his way down Harry’s neck.
Harry, you should have seen your face. Never seen you so lost in it. So consumed. So desperate. You looked a second away from falling to your knees and begging.” Harry feels a tongue, hot and wet, slide up his throat to his ear. Then teeth biting, harder than a nip, on the lobe. Harry might be moaning, he’s not sure. There’s static in his ears. “You don’t have to beg though. Not ever. No need. I’ll give it to you. Whenever, whatever. I don’t mind. I love it.
It really is so very warm. Like bath water, or a perfect cuppa. And it’s cooling quickly and the shock of temperature change only serves to rile him more and it must show because Draco moans. The vibrations sinking into his hair and scalp and skull and Harry would kiss him so good if he could just gain control over his body.
When Harry began blatantly humping the mattress a minute later Draco got a stern, “stop”. Draco sat up to lift his hands and allow Harry to turn over. When he caught the other Harry’'s eyes, he sucked on his own fingers. He was having a great time watching Harry blush when Nate said “Switch”.
Draco shifts from breathing into his neck to kiss into his mouth and mutters “We’re doing that again” with an assurance he hasn’t quite earned. And Harry glances at the bright end of the alley and remembers their in public with a start. Draco finally manages to put himself away and begins his slightly pompous routine of clean up. Steps back as he says “Let’s get you home, I’m not nearly as good at aftercare as the Doms are.”
Draco’s right hand has migrated to the nape of his neck and his nails scratch at the sensitive skin catch on the hair follicles. Harry can feel him breathing.
Draco was dressed in his trademark leather trousers (and nothing else), Harry in his typical lace knickers and one of his sheer, unbuttoned shirts. Draco had spent an hour before departure shaving his legs (the muggle way because he knew how much it worked harry up).
Draco’s eyes were trained on the other man, legs pressed together as he sat diagonally on Josh’s lap to face Draco almost directly. Harry was looking directly into Josh’s eyes, and Draco could recognize nervousness in his straight back and scrunched eyebrows, surprised and relieved he could still read him.
in this house and didn’t want whatever they were planning, they’d all get cursed out by sentient magic anyway. He knew that mutual assured destruction had been established: if one of them went to the press, so would the other.
It’s just… he’d been so unprepared, so taken by surprise, by the scene unfolding, helplessly, in front of him, and the tangled, unidentifiable feelings filling him in response. He was rooted to the ground, frozen and shocked and all-around
Had he spoken? It felt like he’d spoken. He had no more time to figure it out because Draco had jumped right back into forced-dressing and suddenly the day felt normal again. Why did the silence feel comfortable again? It hadn’t been… a minute ago. It didn’t matter. It
“Everyone here is watching. They can’t wait to see how much you’ll take, and who will fuck you. they all want a peek at this slutty little hole of yours.” He hooked his fingers and pulled, then went back to thrusting and scissoring. “They can’t believe how good you look, all dressed up in lace just for them. Silently begging to be used up and tasted. They’re gagging for you, Harry.” He slipped in a third finger. “They know how much of a pathetic whore you are for it. They can tell just looking at you.” Four fingers now. “They know that you’ll do anything for your Dom… For me.”
Josh paused in his introduction, apparently waiting to see if Draco would say anything, ask who this other man was who wanted Draco (
) and he knew his shyness was obvious to on-lookers, he always got this way when he was put on display: quiet, self-conscious and really, really hard.
The Dom’s finished up shortly, Josh summoned the duvet and they all tucked in for the night without moving from where they were. Nate undid Draco’s cuffs but Harry never let go of his hands.
Draco smirked, he’d been avoiding Harry’s prostate, now he went right for it. Harry jumped. And then went very still as he moaned, long and loud, and Draco kept up a directed massage, slipping in a third finger.
spent half of every evening with his head in the floo), which wasn’t uncommon in and of itself. Draco enjoyed getting blindly passed around, and Nate enjoyed watching him get blindly passed around. And there was always a bit of planning and excessive communication that went into setting group scenes up (laying down the groundwork and negotiating the rules), and Draco wasn’t always privy to the details. He trusted Nate to reside within the boundaries of their contract.
His mouth is dry. He hasn’t taken an even breath in twenty minutes and his fly is ready to break. He feels like he’s about to fall over. His hand is on Draco’s shoulder. He does’t know when he put it there.
The happiness and bliss left over from last night was reigniting by the smarting in his arse and leaked back into him, inspiring a blissful chuckle. “Fuck.” His voice was deep and rough: evidence of the night before.
Harry smirked from spot beside him, picked up Draco’s hand and placed it on his own crotch, squeezing their hands together over his stiff cock. (
Harry hadn’t moved yet from his lounging and sleep-relevant position, he was tucked up with a pillow, relaxed and ruffled. Josh kept the house warm because of how much time Harry spent there without any clothes on, and he barely felt it when Draco plucked the sheet off his body and then off the bed. Someone no doubt threw off the the duvet in the night, it would have been ridiculous, sharing body heat from all four of them.
They’d met in France three years ago, both with English heritage and plans to move back to London in a few years.
Harry doesn’t know when he comes. Is so blown away by the orgasm that he looses track of when or why or how it began, doesn’t remember the rush or the pleasure, just the unspeakable relief and satisfaction. The way his bones seem to settle as the serotonin seeps into his veins. Can’t tell if it’s moments or minutes later when he registers the wet around his prick, stuffed into his jeans, and thinks
And then come and again and finally they still. Skin damp with piss and sweat and seamen. The doms come by. Harry recognizes sinking into a bath and falling asleep between two strong. reliable bodies and doesn’t wake for hours afterward.
But no. They were supposed to be dancing for their Dom’s. Draco hadn’t been told to finger him, and Harry hadn’t been given permission to get fingered. He had no doubt that Josh and Nate were watching closely, no matter how engaged in cocktails and conversation they seemed. And he had no doubt that they would retaliate, exactly when and as harshly as they deemed appropriate.
Relieved that their ability to know one another so well translated into group play, Draco nodded. Nate fetched them from his pocket, unshrinking them, then kneed his way to where Draco was still hovering over Harry.
“Harry…” The name foreign and familiar all at once. He searched his face, hand squeezing absent-mindedly. “How long have you been in the scene?”
Harry Potter walked into the room like a fucking sex dream in shear black stockings that reached his upper things and ended in several inches of lace studded in small, dark green pearls and jewels. They must have been stretchy or lined with rubber, or attached with a stocking spell because they clung to his legs without anything else holding them up. (
Harry let out a small groan and turned his head to face away from those piercing, intense (stunning) eyes. He was laying on his stomach like usual, and shifting in an aborted attempt to ignore whoever was in his bed caused the sore and stretching sensation in his arse make itself known.
, and his head tilts back more. What little tension had remained in his body moves to his hips which twitch forward.
On this Sunday, warm and welcoming, Draco drags Harry to France and Harry watches him drink two lemonades and two cups of tea and this time he thinks he knows better what’s going.
He also learned about Draco’s fondness for tradition, something Harry admittedly had no real appreciation for. But he didn’t mind humouring Draco whenever he dragged Harry along.
“So… If I were to do something like…” Quick as anything, Draco’s thumb had wiggled into Harry’s crack and pressed against his hole. “Would you feel that?” Harry was shaking a little with the was Draco was teasing him, the way he’d leaned in to whisper directly into his ear, the way his tone was full of enjoyment and mocking. He was sweating with it.
Draco’s knuckles are already brushing across Harry’s stomach through his coat (Harry undoes it, wanting the extra layer between them gone). And by the time it’s open and forgotten, Draco’s sucking bruises into his throat and Harry looks down but can’t get a glimpse.
Harry pulled him through the corridor, up the stairs and through the first door on the left, quick and excited. Once the door was closed he said “They’ll give us a few minutes before they join us. I asked for that. So that before we really got into the scene we could have a chance to talk. Get on the same page.”
But Harry still watched the darkened alcove every time they passed it. Couldn’t stop himself, couldn’t turn away until it was already out of sight.
And the other half of that fundamental obscurity is pulling him into that alley right along with Draco. Sun and grit.
And he was strict about secrets, and knowing his sub as well as possible. Draco doesn’t communicate well, so Nate would set tasks for him in the early days. He’d ask him to write about a subject (his parents, the war, Hogwarts, so on), put down everything he could, and Nate would study the passages afterward.
Not even in Draco’s wildest, most indulgent fantasies, did he ever imagine what happened next. And there had been some exceptional ones.
Right out East and South and France and Salad and Two Glasses Of Water and Two Cups Of Tea and (Maybe Josh spoke to Draco after he spoke to Harry) and Little Cobble Stree-
Harry could remember it from last night, picture it in his head, long and thin and pale, and now forcing its way into Harry’s arse.
Draco felt lightheaded with the heady balance between having Harry spread out beneath him for his own use and being under the microscopic observation of the Doms. He had no idea where his control ended or began, and he was swimming in it.
The mixing sensation clashed from different directions and overwhelmed, and as Harry snuck a finger in, Draco let go. He relaxed into the mattress and succumbed to the feeling, allowing it all to wash over him. He twitched as Harry thrust his tongue particularly deep or twisted his fingers, there were two of them now but Draco couldn’t remember that happening. And all the while, Nate watched and corrected him.
Josh gestured Harry over to him without Harry looking up or acknowledging Draco once. As he got settled Nate slipped off his seat to crouch beside Draco, hand still on his shoulder.
Harry was hopeful enough to believe Draco hadn’t noticed, but not stupid enough to. Yet the blonde never watched Harry watch the alley, never turned obviously towards him ,or away from him, when they approached it, never paused in his walk, his speech or his gestures.
There was no finesse, no purposeful angling of the hips or hesitancy. It wasn’t gracious or deliberate or even particularly well delivered. It was the most raw fucking Harry had ever experienced. Even Josh couldn’t help but spare a thought or two for Harry in his most unforgiving moods. And because of all this, it didn’t last particularly long.
Draco’s whole world shrank in the anticipation, dragging the moment out and heightening the rush. Harry had been watching
Bur Draco only got two good thrusts in, leaving Harry disoriented, stumbling and moaning in the middle of the floor, hazy with it, before Nate was there. The large Dom pulled them apart and Harry watched helpless and suddenly alone, his arsehole open and his thighs dripping, as Draco was dragged across the room.
Harry’s eyes had dropped closed as he sunk into the feeling of being touched, shivers skating across his naked skin. He nodded. “Is it sensitive?” He nodded again.
“We know you two better than that Harry, and don’t forget how closely we watch you two, even when it doesn’t seem like it. We know he instigated that little performance, in fact, we expected him to.” Of course it was all a set up. “Unless you want to be punished? You did let him fuck you, after all.” Josh nibbled at Harry’s ear in play retribution “You’re shameless. Needy. And so desperate for it. Aren’t you?”
Josh was mouthing at his neck again, paying no mind to what Harry was saying. Harry’s whole body was quaking with Josh’s assertive thrusts.
But Harry was looking into his eyes again. And this time he was only inches away. And Draco could count seven different shades of green, could taste his breath and smell whatever product was in his hair.
He could read the question in the Harry’s eyes as he leaned in a little further, muscles shifting against Draco’s legs, arms wrapping around his neck.
Could feel his thighs spread over Draco’s own. He ached so much to touch them he pulled at the ties around his wrists without meaning to.
He does up his coat. And they walk the short way to the apparition point, piss on their shoes, and Harry with two loads of semen seeping into his clothes.
He wondered what they’d come up with, and if it could, in anyway, live up to the last twenty-four hours.
Harry shuddered and his resolve crumbled like sand, his eyes rolling back into his head as he moaned. Visions of being fucked by Draco here and now, of getting spanked for it later, were running through his head and blocking out any other thoughts. He loved it. He loved it. He wanted it. Wanted to be used and taken up and pushed around. Before he even made the conscious decision to do so, he was whispering the incantation, and lube was dripping down his thighs.
Quick as anything, it was over. Like time had slowed with the hiss and splatter of public urination and then caught up with itself. Draco’s flies were tightened, his clothes pulled to their correct positions and his body turned back towards Harry, already forgetting the wet, dripping stain he’d left on the wall behind him.
spelled out on the skin of his throat) and rutted for a couple extra seconds as he came. Harry only realized he wasn’t wearing a condom as he arse was filled with a warm, sticky splash of come. Another groan, another thrust, and Josh stilled completely, and lifted his head with one final suck.
. He turned his head into the pillow beneath him, unconsciously trying to shield himself from the pleasure. He shook and his ass clenched around Nate’s dick, increasing the intensity while he shot a load right across onto Harry’s stomach. His hands were shaking, wrists jerking in Harry’s grasp, but the other man held fast.
And then warm. So warm, Harry doesn’t realize it’s wet for a second. And then it is. And by then it’s already made it’s way most of the way down his leg. And then the other one too. And then it’s spreading up to his hips and back to his arse and prick is just soaked. Harry can feel the rivulets, and then he can hear them two. Almost silent splashing on the pavement beneath him, the wall behind him, his legs and jeans and the small dark, warm paces between them.
know: He knew how to trust the Doms, he could do that. After so many years, it was second nature to him. He knew that if Harry Potter
In hindsight it was rather obvious. But maybe that’s why Harry reacted so strongly: suddenly overcome with nervousness bordering on panic, not knowing what to expect, not comfortable with their public (semi-public?) positioning and suddenly distracted by all those long-established associations. All of which was triggered by Draco
Harry smiled at that, “Josh too.” They shared a smile, both seemingly thinking about good their Doms are. Then something occurred to Harry (not at all inspired by the sensitivity in his arse or his hard on). “So how long have you been laying here staring at me then?”
He gave the wrinkled skin another pet then got to work on slicking up. Making sure to be diligent under the eyes of the Doms. He took his time spreading Harry’s arse, and wetting his rim with his index finger and slipping it in just an inch.
It’s better. Being able to focus on the way Draco’s just as tense with anticipation without breaking the kiss. Noticing the light filtering into the alley and the colour of Draco’s coat. Wondering what exactly it is Draco has planned.
Draco tried to think, honest he did, but he knew a lot of people in Hogwarts and couldn’t remember almost any of them. Let alone who’s most likely to show up in a BDSM club, and lust after him for fie years. Besides, he’s been out of country since the war, the war he fought on the wrong side of, the whole thing was completely unwarranted.
It was as stern as Draco had heard Josh’s voice yet, which itself made arousal tighten in his chest. (Though Nate never called him by his name during a scene, only ‘boy’.) Immediately Harry let go of Draco and clasped his hands behind his own back. He leaned back and put an inch of space between their bodies. It was suddenly obvious how loud their kissing and moaning had been in the now quiet room with only their obnoxious panting to be heard.
“Oh.” That was different. Draco’s voice breathy and deep and quiet, his gaze on Harry, no… On Harry, but lower, eyelids drooping, mouth open, and tongue in his cheek.
And then Harry Potter was in his lap. Draco was sure he’d have laughed at his own face, eyes wide, mouth hanging open. There was no way this was real. No way this was actually happen. No way he was
“Ok. Ok. It’s alright.” Draco watched as Josh smoothed his palms down Harry’s arms and spoke to him softly, let him lean back and comfort him. Draco didn’t crave that brand of attention as a sub, but he was pleased to see someone treat Harry like he was precious. Nobody ever did when they were younger, everyone just through him to the fire.
Draco took a step back. He didn’t let go of Harry’s shoulders. The street was empty. “I’ll check in yeah?” His voice was getting breathy. He stepped back. “If there’s anything you don’t want, tell me.” His eyes weren’t stone anymore. He stepped back. “If there’s something you
He lifted his eyes to Draco’s face, now turned towards him, but couldn’t loosen any other part of his body still mentally stuck on the stream, the hiss, that continued in his peripheral.
Harry was sweating again, so close. Draco’s hand was squeezing hard and rubbing rough as he mouthed at his prick. “Sometimes he acts like I don’t have a cock at all, other times he edges me all day, on and off. Once I didn’t have an orgasm for a whole week. I was hazy the entire time.”
cautious, because he pulled his fingers back out again almost immediately and replaced it with his cock.
from tail bone to the nape of his neck. Draco jumped, head dropping back in a loud and shameless moan as a shiver worked its way through him violently.
His back hits the brick wall when Draco gently pushes him into it. The cold is already seeping in, but the panic is gone. And when he looks up into hot grey eyes all he feels himself projecting is the same heat, the same knowing, the same
like they should be against the rules but aren’t and some things he knows shouldn’t be but they are and either of those can feel good or bad and nobody
He’s hard again by the time they get home to the Dom’s on the couch, and cuddles and praises and Draco re-telling the story in really extremely explicit detail and Harry hiding his face in Josh’s shoulder. He comes two more times before a shower and bed. And he doesn’t have the mental energy to think about what next time might be like.
With that out of the way, all his focus moved to the boy in Josh’s lap. The only questions he had left concerned him, but he didn’t know if he could ask.
last week after my sub recognized you, don’t worry” he noticed Draco’s alarm “he wants to protect your identity as much as he wants you to protect his… He also wanted to play. With you. Specifically. He was a schoolmate of yours at Hogwarts, and to be honest, has wanted this for a long time.”
Harry used to be able to dance for Josh for hours, now he doubted he’d last five more minutes without breaking a rule, or just… keening over.
“Draco?!” The other man kept talking, apparently adjusting his pants (he was still getting used to muggle clothing) where Harry couldn’t quite see. Looking around the alley he began to ask “What are you-”
Harry watched as two more men had their way with Draco, distracted by the way Draco hadn’t argued or denied a moment of his punishment. Josh was tucked up inside him as he conversed with the other Doms and Harry watched Doms and subs alike fuck Draco across the room, moaning loud enough for Harry to hear.
Because Draco has never been one for self-control and tends to fall on the indulgent side of hedonism, it isn’t surprising when he continues the grind forward. Descending on Harry, reattaching his mouth to his throat, curling his arm around Harry’s neck to pillow his head when harry leans back once more. Draco’s leg slips between his, and Harry tries to focus on what colour his piss might turn the expensive leather of his loafers but is distracted by the hand tight on his hip and the desperate satisfaction of Draco’s hips pushing hard into his stomach, thigh wedged into his cock. The rhythm he starts up is slow and forceful and
he’s close. head tilted down beside Harry’s so their both looking at his cock, hair brushing Harry’s ear, voice quiet and rough and breathy, mouth just pressed to his cheek. “Can I clean off on you?” His head presses warm to Harrys temple.
, he was hot, rubbing Draco off, a slave to the other man’s movement’s and will. He caught himself pushing his ass back and tilting his hips, not to get Draco to move, but so he might better show off for whoever was watching.
He leaned back against Josh, head tipping back in submission, “why aren’t I getting punished?” he asked quietly to Josh, “ I acted just as rashly as Draco did.” He didn’t take his eyes off Draco, though.
’-clothes-and-out-the-door. Draco fulfilled his Sunday ritual half past eleven, but stopped before entering the forced-dressing phase. Instead, he smoothly transitioned from goading-into-compliance to sitting down closely (warm-heavy-tight thigh pressed slightly on top of one of Harry’s) and placing a hand on Harry’s forearm before meeting his eyes. Draco didn’t wear ‘serious’ or ‘’compassionate’ very often, but when he did… well. He wore it well but that’s beside the point.
Harry learned about Draco’s kinks and fetishes and what made him shiver and moan, sure. But he also learned that, while officially unemployed, the former Slytherin had a knack for law, a passion for politics, a talent for finances and the keenest business sense Harry had ever encountered. You wouldn’t know he was jobless for how busy he kept his schedule: daily trips to the Ministry, various conferences and lunches and meetings, numerous investments he had to ‘check up on’ and other high-society functions that went right over Harry’s head.
Harry wondered if they’d get punished for this later; unsupervised sex. But then, if they would be, they probably shouldn’t have left Harry and Draco alone in the states they’d been in.
And then he was rolling onto his side, head on a pillow and facing Harry, who laid beside him. His lips were red and swollen, his face was messy with lube a saliva, making Draco want to reach out and clean him up. With his tongue. Draco leaned in, stretching his neck, he could feel the heads of their cocks bumping into one another and thought he might be able to reach down with his bound hands. Their mouths were centimetres apart when Nate pulled him back roughly by the hair. “No touching. Harry, be a good boy and hold his wrists still, but no other contact than that. Understand?” He pulled again at Draco’s hair and Draco groaned but nodded.
They got fucked like that, lying close enough to touch but not being allowed to, staring into one another’s eyes, body’s rocking from their Dom’s punishing pace. Harry’s mouth probably still tasted like Draco’s arse, and his eyes were blown to match his swollen lips, his cock jutting out like a hazard. He was flushed and sweaty and Draco drank in the look of him, dragging his eyes down Harry’s body, consuming every detail. Harry was quieter then he was, but pleasure and submission was written all over this face and posture, his teeth were clenched in an effort to keep his moans in.
Harry is reaching for his wand when Draco stops him with a smirk. “Do up your coat” he says. And Harry hears ‘
But the eyes he met when he opened his own weren’t the warm brown of his Dom’s the morning after a scene; they were slate grey and glowing with… something.
Gently, he clasped Draco’s wrists together, then, decidedly less gently, he pushed him down onto his stomach so he was facing the Doms. He felt Harry untangle their legs and take position as Draco had. Nate took his seat back, stretching Draco’s arms out in front go him to hold them down himself.
matched the stockings lace and green trimmings and did nothing to hide his erection. His shirt was black and cropped and shear as well and showed off his road shoulders, muscled torso and arms. He wasn’t wearing his glasses and his hair was artfully messed up like someone had been pulling at it.
focusing on the way his cock was tingling in anticipation and pushed Harry over onto his stomach (because he can) and straddling his thighs. His
Draco’s mouth watered as he took the other boy in. He could feel his own cock straining against his pants. It wasn’t until Nate pulled on his hair that he noticed he’d been quietly whining, the first sound he’s made since they’d arrived.
“Y-yeah, sure.” The light was reflecting on Potter’s tan skin and gave it a bronze glow and it was kind of – beautiful.
He was overcome by an intense throbbing in his head as he closed his eyes. Wandless magic was taxing, and he was tempted to stop practicing altogether. Yet, he couldn’t. He couldn’t stop. Not now.
It wasn’t detailed. Yet, he was certain that it would work. He wanted a fucking victory, even if it would be short-lived. One fucking victory over Draco Malfoy. It was the six years of animosity and the desire to have a win. He didn’t care about Malfoy. He wasn’t worried or stressing over the unrequited notes. Or so he said.
He wanted to brush Potter away, but give in simultaneously. He couldn’t ground himself, and the contact was weighing him down to reality, until he brushed it away.
"The point," An uneven breath stuttered out of his mouth, while he reconsidered the words, "Is that our fight, right now, isn't about how I said you were the one person I didn't want to be with," He winced at the words. "It's your self-preservation tendencies on how I said I won't stay in Otryazan for over a year.”
Malfoy let out a low snort, and directed a glare at him. It didn’t work. Harry laughed. Malfoy smiled. And it caused a tiny flutter in his chest. He ignored it.
He shifted in place with a low grunt. It must’ve impacted his head – one confession wasn’t worth forgetting six years of animosity. Yet, unprompted, in a soft voice, Harry whispered, “Wanted to?”
He heard a soft turn of the doorknob, and the bedroom door creaked open. He opened his eyes, staring at the cup with a smirk playing on his lips. Right on cue.
“Isn’t it?” Harry said, his voice strained at the edges. “I’m stranded on a severed Island with you, and I can’t find a fucking way out. We’re struck with each other and I want to be clued in about you or it’ll bite me in the arse.”
Draco internally scoffed at that. He remembered Harry’s face inside that pensive when he let his dominant side out, with Blaise. Harry was horrified and disgusted. He could barely speak afterwards, shell shocked as he was. Harry was not suited for that kind of treatment. He wasn’t broken, sick, and twisted enough to enter the BDSM world. He was good, honest, and brave. Draco could never chain him up and whip him. The whole thing was absurd, and he would never even consider it.
Draco looked away. He was not going to pretend to be incredulous over her bold statement. He knew exactly what that meant. Astoria knew what his favorite ‘position’ was—underneath another man.
He had to control his desire, however, for now. He reached for his big, square wooden hair-brush. It wasn’t as big as he would like, but it would do the job. The conjured one would hurt too much. They had to start small.
“…but it just happened, and I’m so sorry. This just started between us, and we never had the exclusive talk. I wasn’t thinking, and it didn’t mean anything. You have to believe me when I tell you that you’re all I want. Blaise is threatening to tell the press the truth, and I just didn’t want him so upset. I promise that it will never happen again.”
Harry moved forward to kiss him, sensually, and grope his body. He pushed his boxers down and Draco’s cock flopped out. It was completely soft, but he quickly stroked it to hardness.
The divorce would hit the papers any day, and Draco needed to tell him first, before he jumped to the wrong conclusions. He was dreading it, but it needed to be done. Blaise seemed so far away, now. Draco may have been confused before, especially considering his own reaction to his nuptial news, but that was before spending every day this week, in Harry’s arms.
Draco is tempted to ask details but holds himself back. It’s just the sick curiosity of his Dom acting up. And besides, this is wonderful news.
Harry startled, looking around, and people were staring, but Draco appeared unconcerned. He looked back at him and realized Draco hadn’t even broken eye contact. A spike of adrenaline coursed through his body and he grabbed Draco around the neck and kissed him for all he was worth. They never kissed in public before, even if they were in a muggle place. That was a hard rule.
He knows he’ll do anything for Draco. Anything he ever asks, no matter what it is. It’s like…he just can’t
“Go easy on me, baby. I’m so close to filling you up, already.” Harry kissed the back of his neck to distract himself, giving Draco time to adjust.
After a few moments of quiet rage, Draco took his glass paperweight and threw it at the closed door with enough force that it shattered into several pieces. It did little to calm his anger and he quickly muttered a
Harry was carefully avoiding him, instead. He stayed true to his word and didn’t let their personal life interfere in their work life. They still went out on cases together, but Harry treated him with total indifference. He would no longer glance at him with those sparkling green eyes, full of longing, when they were alone. He hardly looked at him. He treated him with polite evasiveness, exactly like he would any other coworker.
Standing abruptly, he turned his back to her, hiding his face. He, then, remembered something that would be a perfect way to conceal his angst. Walking towards the entrance, he went into the mudroom to retrieve something from his coat pocket. He returned with a long black velvet box that he slid on the table towards Astoria.
His love was the thing that made him feel weak, all along. Harry broke the kiss and leaned against the wall, sticking his ass out.
Taking up most of the front page was a moving picture of him and Harry in the alley behind the Ministry on Saturday night.
your voice is so sexy. I could listen to your sex voice for the rest of my life. Tell me you want me.”
It’s fine. It would all be fine. This was just break-up sex. It happened with all relationships. It was just the natural progression to seal the end. Maybe this could be good thing. If Harry was appeased, then perhaps he would not interfere with Shacklebolt granting him the transfer to the DMLE in Paris.
People run when they can’t bear it. When the energy inside is so great, there’s no way not to be demolished by the force of it. You have to move.
Harry flipped them so Draco lay flat on his stomach. He licked every part of Draco he could reach, with his cock still submerged. Draco was trembling, at this point. He felt he had overdosed on sexual sensation. He was incredibly sensitive to each of Harry's licks, and shivered involuntarily, in spasms. His nerves had shorted out.
After a few moments just lying on top of him, he released Blaise from his chokehold and moved his hand from his mouth.
fuck my throat until I’m crying. I want you to spank me and slap me. I want you to call me your property, your boy, your…whore, your slave. I want you to tie me down so I can’t move and fuck me to your heart’s desire.”
He should have fucked him when he had the chance, instead of having an existential crisis, but he could not help it. Harry always brought out severe emotion in him, the kind he thought he never had. It had been almost two weeks since he’d been inside him. He resented the fact that Harry always made him feel desperate, in some way. Either desperate to get away or desperate to fuck him. It made him feel incredibly weak and vulnerable, as usual.
Ordinarily that would have earned him at least a reproof, if not a swat, but Draco merely walked faster, opening the outer door and leading Harry onto the deserted sidewalk.
“Blaise, I didn’t divorce Astoria to be with Potter. Are you mad? She was stealing money from my accounts to sustain a secret lover. I’m not even with him, anymore.”
Draco couldn’t believe that Blaise was comforting him, when he was the one lying in a hospital bed. He really didn’t deserve the man. He looked up at him, smiling with that movie-star grin. They had restored his perfect teeth.
Draco could have never anticipated how much this hurt him, because he never truly believed Blaise would abandon him.
When he arrived home, his erection had subsided. Everything would be fine. He would go home early tomorrow and settle into Harry’s warm embrace. He would forget all about this and everything would return to normal.
He pushed with his fingers, massaged the right spot, and watched as Harry began to cum, with his cock ring on. Some orders he had no issues with at all, apparently.
Draco wishes he could wandlessly gag him, but he’s not as powerful as Harry, who’s hard and ignoring his own cock. He reaches around him to stroke it, but his hand is smacked away.
Draco measured his success by the length of Harry’s frustrated moans. It seemed to go on and on, until Harry was forced to gasp for air. His resistance was wearing steadily. Draco finally let up for a moment.
for fifteen years. It was this broody, sulking demigod that could bring you to your knees with the raise of an eyebrow. Blaise would never let go of him. His magnetism is undeniable. Harry had only experienced it for a few days; what would fifteen years do to a man?
He supposed he could make an exception, just this once. Harry was asking for it. Besides, he could easily heal him, if things got out of hand.
They both worked to dismantle the forcefield, eventually getting it down. The man inside was deranged and unwashed, but not a very good wizard. He may be good at charms, but he was easy to disarm. He was merely holding the children for ransom. He was taken into custody. Thankfully, the children were unharmed and eventually returned to their parents.
Draco smiled at him from inside the office. Harry heeded his request. The show was back on. He tried to put disdain in his voice before replying,
He stared down at Blaise’s perfectly sculpted back, now collecting sweat, moved his eyes lower, watching his dick slide slowly in and out of Blaise’s beautiful hole with languid pleasure.
He should not have punched him. He was, after all, his boss, but the prat deserved it. Clearly, he though he could take whatever and whomever he wanted at any given time.
Draco opens the door to show him a cozy bedroom with a lush Gryffindor red comforter and an in-suite bathroom. There was a small couch and a desk inside. It was rather simple for Malfoy Manor, more suited to Harry’s tastes. He walks on to the opposite end of the corridor to the bedroom.
His look almost made Draco forget he was in a relationship. It was a desperate, pleading gaze. Draco knew what it meant. He wanted to be fucked by Draco and fully expected it to happen, as the submissive was extremely handsome with a slight muscular build. Most of the observers eventually became participants, if they liked what they saw. The chained man looked a lot like Harry with black wavy hair and light eyes, though his frame was much smaller, the way a perfect submissive should be. The man did not break eye contact with Draco for several minutes, while he recuperated. Draco wanted to stroke his cock through his trousers at his gaze. He knew he could pull his dick out and wank, as most behind him had been doing, but he felt it was undignified to do so. He would wait until he returned home. He maintained a calm, politely disinterested expression, as he looked back at him, and sipped his drink, daintily. It only spurred the tabled man on. He licked his lips obscenely at Draco.
As they walk up the stairs, Draco peaks at the mirror to see if Harry is listening. He is, mostly, but the mirror distracts him and he looks over, connecting with Draco’s eyes. He’s shocked to be caught and quickly looks down again.
“Okay, pet. Stopped. Breathe for me, Harry. I’m listening.” He was lubing his hard cock as he spoke, his cock twitching hard as he thought about sinking into Harry’s sweet ass.
Harry drags him upstairs, not letting go of his wrist until Draco’s on his back on the bed. Sensing his need for total control, Draco allows it, wants it even. Harry strips him of his boxers and shirt. He's up on his arms above him, rubbing his thick cock against Draco’s.
Throwing Harry over the desk face first,  he pushes him to lie fat on his belly, naked ass high and exposed. He hears the tell tale clank of Draco’s buckle being undone.
He knew he would regret this, but he couldn't help feeling safe. Potter's arms were like a tonic for his frazzled mind.
Harry swallowed with fear and arousal; he wanted to feel those gloved hands on his body, sliding over his skin, bending him over, spanking him…At the same time he was terrified that Draco was going to take him out in public at the end of a leash and they’d be photographed.
Draco’s heart broke a little more now. Had Blaise come at him with a shred of the anger he saw in his office earlier that day, he would have hexed the man into oblivion, on the spot, casting him out of his life forever.
Blaise had returned to his normal impassive self. They still had lunch every day at work, either in his office or in the atrium. He hadn’t come onto Draco since that morning in his office, and Draco began to miss his presence in his bed, again. It had been a constant in his life, for so many years.
Draco stood up and opened his pants, easing his erection out. It was such a relief that he sighed. Harry’s eyes were fixed on his tumescent organ.
He wasn’t upset about the engagement, itself. There were smaller pictures of a proposal party, held in their honor. 200 guests were in attendance, and Draco wasn’t one of them. His eyes prickled when he remembered that they always talked about Draco being his best man, since they were children at Hogwarts.
“Not really. Blaise is the only man I’ve ever been with, and he prefers to bottom,” not bothering to mention that the first part of this was no longer true.
Draco was forbidden from speaking about it, and now felt so badly for Harry, that he didn’t want to burden him any further.
Harry stepped out of his grasp angrily and moved to exit the shower. Draco stopped him before he could leave and pushed him gently against the wall, holding him by his bicep. Harry could have easily broken his hold. He was much stronger than him but allowed himself to be manhandled. Draco leaned close to speak softly into his ear. Harry shivered.
It was evening. Draco was pacing the floor of Blaise’s parlor with a half-empty bottle of firewhiskey swinging in his hand, his only dinner. He had managed to reach his goal of getting completely zonked, but it didn’t calm him down, the way it usually did.
Harry continued to grunt and thrust behind him for a few more minutes, until he finally groaned loudly and released his cum deep inside Draco. He shoved him forward hard enough, with his orgasm, that the couch moved forward two feet, clear across the floor.
He was fully dressed as he looked down at Blaise, naked but for the pajama bottoms sagging sadly around his ankles. He was still bound, gagged, and bent over, his ass stained red.
“I was just telling Blaise that I support him with Jacob. I was assuring him that our friendship would remain unchanged, when you walked up.”
knows he loves this treatment. He keeps the anger out of his voice and uses his commanding drawl to let him know that the game is on.
Blaise narrowed his eyes. Undoubtedly, if one spots so much as a nose hair, from an ex-lover or a current lover, they would know exactly who it is.
Draco chuckled and released him, setting him down on the ground. He gave Astoria a soft kiss on her cheek and asked her to stay for breakfast, but she politely declined. She had work to do, setting up her new house, not far from the manor. Draco made her promise to owl him if she needed anything.
Draco is on his back on the marble floor, his eyes blinking quickly at the ceiling, his mouth opening and closing. His arm is bent behind him weirdly. Harry hears shouting, but he’s so focused on Draco he can’t even process. Blood start soaking through his shirt in random gashes and he has a horrible flashback of that night in the bathroom.
When he informed Astoria over dinner, he expected her to be excited to be able to take a personal day to go to the salon to do her hair or get a manicure, without feeling guilty over leaving Scorpius in the hands of the house elves. Astoria looked very worried over the news of his personal day but didn’t question him.
“How are you going to keep him happy, exactly? By shoving his dick in your mouth?” He asked angrily.
He felt a hand stroking his arm, startling him out of his reverie. Draco placed a soft kiss on the back of his shoulder. He could feel Draco’s hardness behind him, but he ignored it. Draco pulled him to lie flat on his back and Harry, too sad to resist, allowed it, but he kept his head turned away. Draco’s hand stroked his stomach and dipped lower to grasp his completely flaccid cock. He stroked it for a while, but it refused to rise to the occasion. Dipping his head underneath the green silk comforter, he began to suck.
“And now,” Draco said, his husky voice drawling out the words slowly and deliberately, “I’m going to take your trousers down and put you over my knee and give you a real ass warming. Obviously you need a good spanking, and you’re due one, my pet. Have you anything to say to that?”
“Please what, pet?” Draco demanded, putting the little thrill he got at the word “Master” aside until later. Later he’d savor it. For now, he’d
“There’s nothing wrong with marrying a woman to make a family Blaise! You can be whoever you want in private. What we do in private should be no one’s business.”
Like you just wrecked my shit.” Draco can’t breathe. It’s so sudden. The room spins around him. Draco sees him realize.
He banished Harry from his mind as he dressed in his best for drinks at The Wizarding Country Club. He wanted Blaise begging for him. He took in his reflection. Under his open robes, he wore too-tight charcoal trousers, that displayed his package when he sat down, and a fitted light grey v-neck sweater. The sweater was thin and clung to his lithe, perfect body. It made his eyes appear brighter. He looked taller than usual because his clothes were so fitted. He took extra time on his white-blonde hair, which was mostly slicked back, but still looked soft enough to be manipulated. He let one piece fall around his face in a haphazard way, as if he took no time at all to style it. He was satisfied with his appearance.
Harry tried his best to hide his disappointment, but he was always pants at masking his emotions. Draco smiled at his reaction. It was a good sign. It made his cock twitch to see Harry so desperate to submit. To be his. It renewed his energy.
“They’re transferring him home tomorrow morning. Every time he loses sight of you, his heart rate goes up and he panics. When you left to get tea yesterday, he asked for you every minute. I don’t want to tell you what to do, but…”
Draco stayed silent and sipped his firewhiskey. Harry was staring at him, trying to discern his thoughts, but Draco, unlike Harry, played it close to the vest. He was not an easy read. He was starting to become unnerved under Harry’s gaze and picked up a case file on the coffee table to do some work. Harry used his wand to duplicate it and did the same.
Draco starts to stroke him. “That’s why I didn’t go to Paris. To make your head so cloudy you can’t think of anything but me.”
“How long is that going to take? You're making last night into more than what it was. I was playing up the sounds, for your benefit. You haven’t cum inside me since those nights in Turkey. That was months ago. I need it. Please, I need to feel you filling me up.”  He begged.
They rutted against each other, hard. Groping each other everywhere, they kissed with pure emotion, but they remained fully clothed. Draco felt mad with lust as their erections pressed against each other through their pants. Neither bothered to remove each other’s clothes. He wondered if they could both cum like this. Their grinding together was an unnaturally pleasant sensation.
It’s not really true. He does ample research on his assistant around the ministry, and she seems like a fine person. If he was with her, then that would be good. She could keep him from being lonely, take care of him. The dead look in his eyes has haunted him since the day he left his office.
“I’ve thought about what you said. If you kept Blaise a secret for this long, then why can’t we? I have my own flat, seperate from Ginny and the kids, in the muggle part of London. No one knows me there. I promise, even if the worst were to happen, I would make sure your job would never be compromised. I would vouch for you…
He’s vaguely aware of a soft hand stroking his back, and he comes to with the realization that he’s drooling all over Draco’s chest. Waving his hand to dry it off, he hears Draco let out a soft laugh.
Harry’s head was turning left and right, a look of rapture on his face, as he tried, desperately, to stave off his orgasm. His proclamation coupled with the view, triggered Draco’s own orgasm and white cum shot out of his cock to land on Harry’s belly. It was always a heady thing to watch Harry surrender to Draco, out of pure lust, despite his best efforts.
“Best leather galleons could buy. I had your initials embroidered on the inside. I thought the red would go better with your coloring.”
Harry drops his gaze away from Draco’s face and Draco takes his hand. “Let’s go upstairs so you can blow me like you promised.”
That night, it was planned that Harry would be sleeping over at Malfoy Manor as he’d been away from him all weekend. They had a very quiet dinner and went upstairs for bed.
It didn’t mean anything though. Of course, it was on his mind; it had just happened this morning. He would forget all about it in a few days...maybe a few months, the most.
Blaise was horrified. His stunt with Jacob was having the opposite effect than what he intended. His worst fear was being realized. He had pushed Draco away with his heavy proclamations. What was he thinking, telling him he loved him, demanding that he leave his wife for him? He had felt emboldened with his coming out. He wanted to scream every truth he held inside from the highest mountain top, for all to hear.
Draco’s never been so hard in his entire life. He shifts him on his back to work their cocks together, until they’re both rock-hard and groaning. Then he fills him with lube. He rubs his tip against his hole and works his way in slowly, watching his face for pain. But he looks rapt. He’s breathing deep and steady. When Draco pushes deep into him, he raises his legs over his shoulders.
His whole life was constantly under a microscope that scanned for errors. Everyone was waiting, with baited breath, to crucify him for the smallest mistake. Shacklebolt fired him, at the drop of hat, for something that was, in no way, his fault. Harry got off scotch-free.
The following Monday at work, Harry is a complete wreck. Draco removed the collar this morning and he’s felt disoriented ever since. It didn’t help that the the minute the collar left his neck, Draco
This was all Harry’s fault. It had to be. Draco didn’t believe in coincidences. He believed that Blaise was getting married as payback for Harry. He knew it was a pompous, ridiculous notion, but he’d known Blaise all his life. He was convinced one caused the other.
Draco moaned and leaned forward to kiss Harry but he kept his head turned away. He seemed to pay no mind and kissed his neck, instead, as he fucked himself slowly onto his cock, languidly and lovingly. Harry could hardly stand it. This was not what Draco really wanted. He was pretending like it was the best feeling in the world, when it should have been Harry fucking himself on Draco’s cock, instead. His leaning over meant that Harry’s cock was not fully engulfed to the base. Harry could last for hours in this position, with him fucking himself slowly onto it. He had before, and this seemed to be Draco’s intention because he kept his pace slow. He refused to do that now.
Draco vowed to put new wards up. In the meantime, his ex was still kneeling on the ground before him. He did not know what to do with him. His instinct was to punish him, but that usually led to sex. He had no right to punish him, regardless, but he couldn’t just let him go, either.
“Hi, I’m Jacob. Heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you,” he shook Draco’s hand enthusiastically, with more force than necessary.
Their morning ritual felt familiar, like something they did together, ever day. Draco found himself comfortable with that fact. It didn’t bother him as much as he thought it would, and he walked Harry to the floo afterwards in an unconscionably good mood, parting with a soft kiss.
When Draco returned to the ministry, it was at Shacklebolt’s emergency summons. He was still boiling with rage, but he had a horrible sense of foreboding. He was being summoned by the Minister himself, Potter’s old mate from the war. This was going to end badly.
“Really? I summoned Pippy to make sure she was taking care of you. I wanted her to cook you your favorites, but she said you weren’t there.”
“Well, at least, I know ‘he’ will always be happy with me.” He grabbed his now, softening cock, and gave him a kiss that weakened his knees.
He’s already arranged to meet him and insisted on private time between the two of them, so Blaise sends Pansy on a spa vacation for the weekend, insisting she take his house elf to wait on her. His eyes practically glow when Draco asks for “private time.” It was their secret code.
"Holy shit," he exclaimed on a breath when it was through (many seconds later). "Are you all right?"
). He found he rather liked it, but, being mistrustful by nature, he was not best pleased by her request.
As pretty as the Victorian carvings in the old wood were, the table was nothing compared to the plant-life surrounding it. Everything--from Hawaiian Hibiscus to lavender and lilacs--was in bloom and left the space smelling fresh and sweet.
Harry was hooked, even though he felt kind of bad for Edward, trying desperately and nobly to ignore Stephen's increasingly risqué attempts to break through his moral and professional boundaries. ...It kind of rang a bell.
Draco thought as he noticed how quickly (and almost enthusiastically) he had gained Potter's attentions. Perhaps he was just being hopeful? As Head Auror it was his job to be polite and attentive at functions such as these, was it not?
He peered closely at Malfoy, conveying as much seriousness as he could muster in his expression. "I hope you have enough respect for the work I do not to blab about it to the press," he said (the statement half-plea, half-threat).
"Sorry if I smell like a peasant or whatever. I had to apparate five times in pursuit of a suspect and then chase him on foot through a muggle neighborhood. Didn't have time to shower."
"Why don't we wank them together, hm? Just press your cock up against mine and see how long we last when we're both squeezing at the same time."
He squirmed his way out of his robes and twisted his over-long spine to inspect himself and was met with a sight that chilled his blood--
Harry adjusted the hang of his sport coat, crossed his ankle over his knee, and looked around the living space with fresh eyes. He'd been there a couple of times in the last month to pick up Draco for a date but he generally wasn't invited in. He wasn't sure why; the house was perfectly nice--organized and well appointed. But for whatever reason Draco never seemed quite at ease with him being there.
"Not tonight, though... The first time for Blaise had him hurting into the next day. I'm going to need pain potions if you're hoping to have more fun some time soon."
Draco snorted at the exclamation. Harry really did love his sour tarts, but there was a little excitement, despite himself, that burst in Draco's stomach. But whatever laughter or excitement he had left him for immediate, engulfing shock. The blonde stared at his lover as if he were a new species of peacock until his face eventually burst with a bright grin. He threw himself so hard into the Auror they both fell backwards onto the floor.
Draco rolled his eyes. "You are not. That would have gone to press the moment you submitted your forms. Imbecile."
Harry knew what Draco needed. He straightened up, widened his knees slightly, and angled Draco's pelvis with a hand on each hip until he was battering his prostate with every thrust. (He knew he was on target because Draco loosed a keening wail, his body going taught beneath him.) It wasn't long before Draco was climaxing, the brilliant spasming of the muscles in his arse wringing Harry's orgasm from him, as well.
"I do believe I am traumatized now," he breathed with a bright smile. "I'll have nightmares for weeks, I'm certain..."
Harry's mouth went suddenly dry and his stomach did a little flip as his eyes traveled over the man's lean, angular form. With great effort, he pried his gaze from Malfoy's (pale, smooth, delectable) torso and met his taunting smirk.
While he liked the woman, Janine was a shameless flirt who spent far more time sticking her freckled nose into other people's business than focussing on her own healing.
He'd have to tell Draco about all of it tomorrow he thought as he crawled into bed. His stomach sank. He'd been looking forward to another date but there was no way Draco would be in the mood after news like that. Maybe someday he would learn his lesson about rushing headlong into things without first assessing the consequences.
Draco rubbed one hand up and down his arm as uncertainty gripped at him. He nodded slowly a few times instead of answering verbally, as he was not entirely sure his voice wouldn't shake. Sensing that Harry was finally calming down, at least enough to be approached, Draco carefully made his way over and pulled his boyfriend into a gentle hug. He was too tall to encase his lover's waist, so instead he went to squeeze his neck, lay his cheek against Harry's, and close his eyes.
He wasn't so keen on the handholding, but given the couple of days Draco had had and the fact he was venturing rather far outside of his comfort zone for Harry, he swallowed his displeasure and focused on the positives--the weather was nice, Draco's mood was surprisingly good, and he was about to eat his weight in chips. There might even be shagging in his future. Plenty of things to be happy about.
He bumped Draco out of the way with his hip and reached into the bag to pull out his cheeseburger--he did not need a plate or silverware for this meal. He tore away the paper and took a huge bite, heedless of fulfilling every last one of Draco's criticisms about his uncivilized eating habits.
without permission, you wanker. Need I remind you of all the food of mine you've eaten or the time you took my wand to do dishes? You can't expect it not to go both ways!
Exhaling through his nose, he continued, "Sorry to disappoint you, Gladys. I'm actually working on an attempted murder case, as I mentioned before, and I need that list of names to try to identify the suspect. I'm meeting with the victim tomorrow afternoon so I need all the time I can get between now and then to focus on the case."
Harry made short work of his denims, avoiding eye contact as he pushed them down to his ankles. Curiosity quickly got the better of him, however. It had been some time since he’d let someone see his injury by the light of day. And even then, it hadn’t been on ruddy display. Within the span of a heartbeat he was overcome with the need to see Malfoy’s reaction. Would it be disgust? Revulsion?
He snuck out of bed--his efforts at stealth wasted on Draco (who slept like the dead)--and went about his morning routine, content to let the man rest as long as he wanted after the night they'd had.
I have no idea what she put in it and I can't get a hold of her now. There may be some special Granger meddling involved... That or she knows I'll yell at her.
"I'll take the draught. A little now and the rest after... If I have too much now I may not be so clear-headed. Those things always make me feel kind of high."
"Nnn... Shit. If I weren't in such a hurry to have your cock inside me I'd let you properly prep me. I hate spelling myself open."
"Hey. Draco," Potter called, worry evident in his voice. He crouched down next to him until they were at eye level. "Are you sad or sick? I can't tell. Do I need to take you to Poppy?"
Draco was just coming out of the loo when Harry reached it. He looked fine, but one can never be too sure.
"The rest were mostly inspired by dreams or fantasies I concocted during lazy days where I had nothing else to do but wank."
He eyed the purpling mark on Draco's shoulder with pride. "That was fully intentional," he replied, "although I feel passionately about it, as well." He gave Draco his best lopsided grin and a smacking kiss on the side of his face before pulling back to speak.
big a deal to get angry about? Everything was in a jumble so he shut his eyes a moment and forced it all into little compartments (his hand tensing as he did so.) Whatever it was it didn't require analysis now.
But Draco feels the truth of his words. For whatever reason, Harry can’t wall him out, not for all his faults or mistakes. He doesn’t know if he’s not able to or if he chooses not to. But Harry’s open to him—open
Harry tries to lift his head as they carry him into a curtained space and shift him from stretcher to bed. He starts coughing. Really coughing. His bare chest and shoulders glisten with sweat. Healers flood in. Several stand around his bed frowning and talking. He’s shaking badly again, clenching his teeth as he winces. The healers do a diagnostic on him and he seems to shrink into the pillow. His eyes lift open. He looks around.
Draco reached out and slowly unbuttoned his top button and slid the zipper down, relishing the little hiss of metal. The pants fell to Harry’s knees, allowing his cock to rise even higher, confined only by his plaid boxers.
‘You’re hurt,” Draco says softly, his face etched with worry. There’s a nasty looking gash over his right eyebrow. He must have hit the wood very hard.
He couldn’t move back his head even if he wanted to as Draco crowded him against the door. His eyes began to water as Draco picked up the pace, the back of his head banging lightly against the door, but he hardly minded.
The sex of three or four times a week from when Harry was a top seem like a distant memory. The minute Harry went down on his knees and called him “Master,”
“Turn towards the bed. Put your hands straight out, flat on the duvet. Push away from it and spread your legs slightly. This is called the ‘Grace’ position.”
“No. Have you lost your marbles? Of course I’m not fucking bloody Harry Potter! This isn’t about Potter. Forget him. Listen to me. I’ve been thinking about this for a while and I need you and I to take a break from our arrangement.”
“Harry, I want you. Only you. You have no idea how happy I am being with you. I never dared to even hope for you because you were like a dream. You’re loyal, honest, and brave. You’re the savior, for Merlin’s sake. You’re far too good for me.”
After weeks of denying him sex, Draco was even more livid that he chose this moment to engage, after that stunt with junior Auror Smith. He was not Harry’s sub. It was not up to him to deny him for all this time, then suddenly decide to fuck him again.
“MASTER!” He shouted, “I have to cum, please God, let me cum! This is all you, you did this to me. I have no control, never did, don’t want it! Please, please please!”
