The clawmarks rake across his pectorals, wrapping around his right side, under his arm. He was told the wampus cat missed most of his vital organs, excepting a bit of his spleen, but that its claws broke a few ribs on their way through; fortunately he was out like a light while they were re-growing his bones. If he’d had to choke down Skele-Gro it might’ve actually broken him.
at the same time—but his eyes are sort of rolling back in his head and he does, actually, want to be destroyed.
. “I’m missing something, aren’t I?” she asks. “Who’s Rebecca Roslyn? She wasn’t at school with us, was she?”
Long pianist’s fingers trace over his ribs, the lines where rougher, older skin meets baby-smooth new. Harry’s chest hair looks like a disaster area, but Draco doesn’t seem to notice. His mouth twists in a tense, complicated frown.
When he was only a couple of feet away from the other boy, he couldn’t resist it anymore. The temptation was too much, and he lunged forward, claiming Draco’s lips for his own.
Draco gave him a withering look. “I just gave you a blow job, and you’re surprised that I like you? What? Do you not, then?” The last part seemed rather pointed, there might have even been a flash of hurt across his face.
Draco’s fingers made deft work of Harry’s belt, swiftly unbuckling and unbuttoning. He slid the trousers and underwear down, allowing the hard cock beneath to spring free. He loosened his own pants as well and shirked them off, so he was only in his underwear, before returning his attention to Harry.
“Fuck!” Harry’s voice came out as a low growl. He almost bucked his hips up again, but Draco’s hands quickly came to rest on his hips, holding them down before he had the chance to.
Harry was about to greet the two, when Luna suddenly held up what looked like a perfume bottle and sprayed both Harry and Hermione, with...something.
“She’s hoping to do a bit of matchmaking, see,” Ginny continued. “Spray as many people at Hogwarts as possible and hopefully pair up a few soulmates along the way.”
“What’re you—” Harry’s question was cut off by his own moan, as Draco returned his mouth to Harry’s cock, slowly taking in as much of its length as he could. And then he felt Draco’s finger pressing against his entrance, rubbing against the sensitive nerve endings there and then slowly sliding in. It was a strange sensation, but not unpleasant, he supposed. And then the finger curled a little, rubbing around inside until it pressed against something inside him that made Harry cry out in pleasure. “Fuck! What?”
However, despite his brain’s protests, Harry couldn’t stop himself taking another step forward, toward that intoxicating scent. He breathed it in deeply, letting the odour fill his lungs, overloading his senses. It was as if it held some power over him, almost as if he were being physically pulled toward it. And the more he breathed it, the more he felt drawn to it, wanting to wrap himself up in it, be surrounded by it, lose himself in it.
And perhaps the feeling might be mutual. Despite Draco’s tense posture, seemingly trying to hold himself back as well, he had also taken a tiny step toward Harry.
“Yeah, she was gonna do that. But I thought it seemed more fun this way,” Ginny shrugged, still grinning. “You should’ve seen your faces.”
Mustering up every ounce of self-control he possessed, he managed to push Draco away. “Come with me,” Harry muttered, then grabbed the boy’s hand and began dragging him along. Surprisingly, or perhaps unsurprisingly, he met no resistance from Draco, who followed along obediently all the way to the Room of Requirement. Passing students gave them some odd looks along the way. But Harry didn’t have it in him to care right now.
Draco stopped kissing and lifted himself up, looking down at Harry. “Do you really want to have this conversation right now?” he asked, cocking his eyebrow. Draco moved his hand to Harry’s clearly bulging crotch and gave it a small squeeze, emphasising his point. “Or would you rather deal with this first?” Harry couldn’t help bucking his hips up into the other boy’s touch with a slight groan.
Harry shot a glare at him. “You know, given that I’ve had my cock in your mouth, I think we should probably be on first name terms.”
“Yup, it’s nifty stuff,” said Ginny. “When you wear it, it won’t smell of anything to most people, but to your true soulmate, and them alone, it will smell absolutely irresistible. Luna here concocted it herself. Absolute genius.”
Draco continued to rub his finger against that sweet spot, eliciting a low moan from Harry. He tried to buck his hips again, but Draco’s other hand was still holding him down firmly. And then the soft warmth of Draco’s mouth was engulfing him again, as his finger continued to press and rub at his prostate.
He continued on toward the library; Ron and Hermione could catch up whenever they were ready. However, as he rounded a corner, he was hit with the most incredible smell. Thoughts of Luna’s unique perfume flooded his mind. Ginny had said she was trying to spray as many people as possible, right? What if there was someone else around who had also been hit with the perfume, and he was about to come face to face with his soulmate? Was this soulmate thing actually real? He had to admit, whatever it was really did smell incredible. He could hardly describe it. There were elements he recognised, treacle tart and the woody sort of smell of a broomstick handle. There was a sweet scent as well, vanilla perhaps, and some other familiar smell that he couldn’t quite place. But then there was something else beneath the other scents, flowing through them all, melding them all into one, something deeper, more intense, that he didn’t recognise at all.
Harry continued on with Hermione, until they turned a corner and almost bumped right into Ginny and Luna, who seemed to have been in some deep conversation.
As he looked back at Draco again, there was a strange expression on the other boy’s face, as if he’d just seen a ghost. And Harry was hit with a sudden thought. No. Surely not? It couldn’t be.
“I would’ve thought that was obvious, Potter,” Draco drawled, pausing only momentarily to speak before continuing his path of kisses.
If he really wanted to, Harry figured he could probably overcome the strange effects the perfume seemed to be having on him. Just turn around and run. And yet...he didn’t.
Perfume? Harry sniffed at himself. “Err, it doesn’t smell of anything,” he responded quizzically, wondering if this was some kind of strange joke.
Another student, or perhaps even a really nice smelling bunch of flowers? There was nothing though, unless the smell was somehow coming from the stone walls or floor, which seemed unlikely.
He could feel himself inching closer with every passing second. There was a part of him that wanted to stop, to run away, to forget about this bizarre revelation he was having. However, that impossibly intoxicating scent flooded his lungs, with every breath he took, overcoming him more and more with every passing second.
Harry moaned over and over. That feeling as Draco rubbed against the sensitive spot inside him, he’d never tried doing something like that before, but damn it was good. “Fuck, fuck, fuck. God, I’m close. Draco I’m gonna—”
“We shouldn’t be disturbed n—” Harry began, as he closed the door behind them. Draco cut him off, shoving Harry up against the door and pressing their lips together once more.
“Yeah, of course,” Harry replied, sitting up and looking around the room. He probably should locate his wand and get himself cleaned up. Then he turned back to look at Draco. “But, if we’re taking things slowly...we can still make out and stuff right?”
It was at that moment that Ron finally caught up. His face was flushed and he seemed out of breath. “Hey guys—” he began to say, but then froze, staring at Hermione. “‘Mione, did you put on perfume?”
Draco let out a squeal of protest, before giving in to his own urges and kissing back with full force. He grabbed at Harry’s robes, pushing Harry up against the wall, pressing against him harder.
Not that surprising? How could it be not that surprising? Harry gaped. “Wait! Wait, do you like me?”
Looking Draco up and down, Harry supposed he couldn’t deny that he was rather attractive...well, errr...for a bloke anyway. Beautiful blond hair that almost glowed when the sun hit it, distinct features, smooth soft-looking lips, just asking to be ravaged with kisses… He was beginning to wonder why he hadn’t noticed it before? In fact, upon closer inspection, Draco Malfoy was not only attractive but totally impossibly bloody goddamn fucking sexy.
No, no, no! What was he thinking? Draco Malfoy wasn’t sexy, he was detestable. And Harry was straight anyway. Totally and utterly straight...but wow how had he never noticed how piercing Draco’s eyes were, such a beautiful silver-grey that one could lose themself in for hours. Or perhaps he had noticed all this before but had just chosen to bury it deep down and pretend it didn’t exist. Until this seductive perfume had wrenched all of those thoughts and feelings back out into the open.
“Well that’s because you aren’t your own soulmate, of course,” Ginny said grinning, as she draped her arm around Luna’s shoulders. “And I suppose that means Hermione, Luna, and myself also aren’t, given that we have it on too.”
However, every time Harry thought he might be getting close, the pace changed, or Draco paused to do something different. Keeping him close but never close enough. Occasionally, he would pause at the tip, using his hand to pull the foreskin back, so he could lick the sensitive spot on the underside of the head. Which felt amazing, he had to admit. But it just wasn’t quite enough.
“Mmm, you like that, then?” His eyes were shut tight, but he could hear the smirk in Draco’s voice. Smarmy bastard.
It was a totally ordinary Saturday at Hogwarts. The type that the professors seemed far too eager to spoil with homework. There were many things Harry would rather spend his weekend doing, but given the sixty-inch potions essay he was somehow supposed to complete by Monday, he was going to have to follow Hermione’s advice and spend the day studying in the library with her and Ron.
“Oh, umm, I didn’t mean anything bad,” Ron quickly added. “It’s a good smell!” Clearly he was worried he might have offended Hermione.
Harry looked around for the source. It seemed there was only one other person in the corridor, standing right in front of him, just a few metres away. But it couldn’t be. Could it? Draco Malfoy? Harry glanced around again. He was desperate to find any other potential source of the smell. Anyone or anything that hadn’t been his sworn enemy since First Year.
Draco grinned again and took his own fingers into his mouth, giving them a generous coating of saliva.
Well, whatever the case, aggressively making out in the corridor wasn’t much better. Harry had a strong feeling he should get them somewhere private before he lost all coherent thought again.
And then Draco’s hands were sliding up his torso, stopping to undo the clasps of his robes and pushing the fabric off of his shoulders. Harry relaxed his arms for a moment, letting the robe drop to the floor to pool around his ankles before making swift work of Draco’s robe and tie.
Draco took that as his cue and plunged his head down around Harry’s cock, engulfing as much of its length as would fit in his mouth without making him gag, and used his hand to encircle the rest. Slowly he began to move up and down. It felt so warm and wet. It was like nothing Harry had ever experienced before, given that his only prior experience consisted of his own hand. This was so much better, so much more intense. Harry didn’t think he’d last long if Draco kept this up.
Mustering up as much Gryffindor courage as he could, Harry took a few steps toward the other boy. He had to ask. “Umm, did Luna happen to spray you? With some kind of magical soulmate perfume?”
“You could try asking people first, before randomly spraying them with an unknown substance,” Harry narrowed his eyes at Ginny.
“As much as I’d love to stay, I think I’ll just leave you guys to explain it to him,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I really do need to get on with that potions essay, so I’ll see you guys in a bit.” Then he walked off. After a few moments, he couldn’t help chuckling to himself, when he heard Ron’s voice behind him cry out, “It’s what?”
“Oh,” was all Harry managed in response, with a near-identical horrified expression. So Draco was his… No, he couldn’t even finish that thought. Maybe this was all just some kind of sick prank. Ginny had a wicked sense of humour, after all, perhaps she set all this up somehow. Maybe? What if the joke was that the perfume actually smelt good to the person you...liked the least? Ginny might find that funny. He couldn’t really see Luna being interested in a prank like that, though. And then he remembered Ron and Hermione. There was no way Hermione was the person Ron liked the least. In fact, quite the opposite. Which only left one possibility…Ron and Hermione must be in on it too.
his little mouth as Harry draws nearer, the bubbling, green water shifting to blue, and he swims up excitedly to nibble at Harry’s finger as it breaks through the water’s surface.
Harry inputs, tearing his gaze away from Draco’s face for a moment to survey the scene before him. Artemis and Apollo have apparently both released the squeaky toy that is now rolling between them. Helios looks on at Apollo’s excited pawing and at Artemis’ calculated nudging, and Harry can see the wonder behind her pink-red eyes.
The flitterbloom that Harry saw earlier is now engaged in one of the oddest wrestling matches he’s ever witnessed, and Harry knows it’s coming before it happens.
There is one common factor in all the occurrences of wonky magic that has happened to him over the past few days, and he thinks that Poppy’s question at this point is merely a formality. She has pieced it together as well, maybe even sooner than Harry has. Still, Harry does not care to admit to the assumption in her eyes when the common factor is sitting beside him, leg wrapped up in his jelly thi— er, tentacle.
Alcohol-flushed skin colors even more under Harry’s heated gaze. The dusting of color along Draco’s cheeks is striking, and Harry’s fingers are itching to find out whether the dark pink will turn to red underneath his touch.
“I said, the food smells good,” Harry answers as he gives their temperamental cat one last scratch and gets to his feet before Artemis decides to plop on his lap and demand more. She rights herself and brushes against his leg before sauntering off ahead of him.
“Harry?” Draco probes, eyes following Helios as she twists around the legs of their kitchen table one after the other.
Need for his hands aside, he’s also quite content to stay put. So far he’s been clever (lucky and alert) enough not to get thrown out, and he has no active desire to break that streak. Harry thinks it’s best not to test Draco’s patience too much with his tendency to explore and touch and examine.
“Harry?” Draco prods, his tempting mouth turning down slightly, making the lower lip plumper and, yes,
“Harry!” Draco rubs at the spot, glaring at Harry through the corner of his eyes, but makes no move to step away from the circle of Harry’s arms.
The staircases are kind to them, and even Harry’s temperamental one seems to have grasped that neither of them are in a playful mood, nor in the correct headspace to avoid vanishing steps or broken appendages.
spoil him too much?” Harry counters, trapping Draco’s foot between his own. “Who was it who bought him that squeaky toy the other day? Remind me again how much it cost?”
to understand that I won't be like him. If you understand, then somehow I'll feel better about it. Like I'm not going against my father's teachings for no reason."
“Doesn’t matter who knows me, if the Prophet’s going to just tell people who I am anyway!” Harry yelled. Mrs. Finnigan didn’t know a damn thing-
"It's because they dilute our history! The come in with their muggle customs and technology and use magic with them in ways that go against how we've lived for hundreds of years! The people that support them support the loss of our culture!"
"Did they say they were going to do anything about it?" Harry asked in disbelief, and Draco shook his head gravely.
Harry went back and forth between the table and the countertops, carefully balancing dishes of various breakfast foods enough to sate an army and placing them along the long table.
"You never know." Draco said. "Mind you, the Blacks were a hardcore Pureblood-supremacist family. They must have burnt Sirius out the tree because he wasn't like them. It basically disownment." He reached out to run his fingers across Regulus's face, staring at it with an indiscernible look on his face. "I think this one's dead, though."
“Oh…” Pansy said, seemingly at a loss for words. He didn’t bother to confirm whether she was suspicious of his sudden departure, instead throwing her a quick smile over his shoulder as he hurried out the Library (not going unnoticed by Madam Pince, whose glare he felt in the back of his neck as he stepped out the doors).
“Mum saw the articles about you and she...” Seamus trailed off, biting his words frustratedly. He sighed, as if trying to calm himself down, but his tone was still accusative when he spoke again. “Look...what did happen that night when...you know, when...with Cedric Diggory and all?”
Neither of them are all the way hard yet, but Draco’s hard enough to nestle his cock past Harry’s rim. Harry rocks gently, feeling Draco come to full hardness inside of him, growing and growing until he’s nestled right up against that spot inside Harry that lights up the base of his skull.
His eyes are bright with tears. He sniffs, pulling a handkerchief out of his pocket to wipe his nose, then says, “Alright. Let’s get this over with, then.”
but some tabloid in Ireland that he’d never heard of; running into Cho Chang at twenty, asking her out only to have her let him down very gently in front of a woman he took a moment too long to realize was her wife; how he’d sobbed the first time he woke up alone in a foreign hospital, arm twisted round the wrong way and missing half its skin and everyone he knew safely back in London, none the wiser.
Harry has to remind himself more than once as they make their way out through the crowded halls of the Ministry to keep his hands to himself—it’s a near thing, every time they pass a maintenance closet, because he wants more than anything right now to get his hands under Draco’s clothes. It’s not even a sex thing, he doesn’t think—he’s just suddenly starving for Draco’s skin, hungry to have as much of him as he can have, greedy about it. He wants to be alone with him, to have him all to himself. He doesn’t even want other people to look at him, really, especially not people he knows are friends with fucking Choudhury, especially not
Staggering, a tangle of bare feet, the bed is suddenly much too far so Harry presses Draco down into the stately leather smoking chair by the window and climbs into his lap, murmuring a loosening charm Ginny taught him as he does. “Harry,” Draco says, breathless, an expression on his face like he’s staring up at fireworks, witnessing a miracle, but he doesn’t have a chance to say anything else before Harry sinks onto him.
His fingers move inside Harry again, just slightly. Harry wants to swear at him for something—the overstimulation, the smug look on his face, the crime of being so good in bed and also
and the velvet bag comes floating out of the pocket of his robes, folded neatly over the arm of the smoking chair. Harry catches the bag and holds it tight in one hand. He feels like a bit of an idiot, with his hair all sticking up and pillow creases on his face, wearing only a pair of Draco’s pants, but he still goes forward into the study.
Draco murmurs a charm against Harry’s left ass cheek—a cleaning charm, Harry can feel it tingling inside him—and then it’s all he can do to hold onto the bookshelf and not to fall over entirely, because Draco’s
Shivering, nauseous, he makes himself a cup of tea, takes a blanket off the bed, and goes up onto the roof.
on fire, thankfully, but Ginny has invited herself and Hermione to tea, which considering the massive Malfoy-bestowed hickey Harry’s got on his chest might turn out to be rather the same thing.
Eventually Draco notices him and stops, holding the empty sack as the gnomes go screeching back to their holes. “You weren’t at work!” he calls up to Harry.
. Yeah, sure, alright. Pull the other one,” leaning back in his chair, huffing. “You had me going there for a second. You and Malfoy.
Across an impossible Grecian courtyard, sunset red and liquid overhead, into a darker, quieter corridor, seaside breeze balmy and gentle on their skin, and Harry can’t take it anymore—he steers them sideways into a wall, takes Draco’s face in his hands, and kisses him.
Harry stops halfway to the door. He wonders if Draco’s been using their Occlumency sessions to plant commands in his head like a Soviet sleeper agent in old Muggle movies, or if he’s just gone mad, that one word can affect him like that. Can arrest him so thoroughly, like a palm pressed to his throat.
Draco pauses with the sweater in his hands, staring down at Harry’s bare torso. The worst of the wounds have healed, of course—they wouldn’t have let him walk out of St. Mungo’s if they hadn’t—but the fresh pink skin he spent the better part of the day regrowing has left a clear map of where they were.
“That’s marvelous,” Harry says, brain finally catching up with the conversation. “That’s, I mean—” he stands, pulling Hermione into a hug, “congratulations, guys, really.”
A month, by some incredible stroke of good luck that must’ve been looking for someone else when it hit Harry, turns out to be not so much a month as three weeks. Granted, Harry still spends those weeks slithering miserably through the rainforests of Guatemala, thinking about the words
Harry meets his eyes—which are, unfortunately, devastating, commanding eyes. He can feel Zabini watching them like the cat that’s got the cream, and he’s disproportionately aware of how much of his cock is on display in that kimono, but Malfoy raises his eyebrows (
“Are you ever?” Malfoy sniped, but it was quiet, there was no heart behind it. He stood, shuffled his papers, waved them into his bag with a murmured charm. “I think that’s enough for today,” he said. “I’ll see you tomorrow,” and walked out.
, and take Harry into bed and let Harry lie awake tracing his scars, kissing each one, like he did between the first orgasm and the rest of the night that he can’t remember, and—
“Duty calls, I suppose,” Draco says dryly. He’s sitting at the head of the table, legs crossed, long thin feet outfitted in plush house slippers, reading the
“I thought we were pretending that didn’t happen,” Malfoy snaps. He sighs, dropping his pince-nez down on its chain so he can rub his eyes, then says with less vitriol, “I would’ve guessed you’d take that memory out.”
Harry sits down and helps himself to several ornate pastries. “What part of ‘my flat burned down’ did you not understand? It's alright, I’ve got an extra pair of trousers at work, and I can borrow something from Ron—”
Eventually they reach the last of the thirteen vials and find themselves back in the training room at the DMLE, groggy, their minds full. Draco might’ve had a point, before, about doing this at the Manor; it’s strange to suddenly find themselves back in the real world, disorienting.
did what he wants him to do, which is pin him to the bookshelf and stuff him so full of cock he can’t move. But whatever version of him knew how to say that in actual human language is long gone, and what’s left is only a thing that wants Draco. A thing that lets out a pathetic, desperate sort of whine, nonverbal.
Any other case, he’d take his frustration out on the work, but Kingsley had asked expressly for him not to do that thing he did in Romania—id est, not to lose his top entirely at all the waiting and wrap the whole thing up himself. Apparently cutting off the Guatemalan contingent of this ring will send all their people in England running underground, and while Harry knows that makes sense, he’d really rather storm their headquarters wands-blazing than spend all this time slinking about in Animagus form, gossipping with boa constrictors.
Harry falls asleep like that, one arm pinned against his chest and the other thrown over Draco’s side, totally boneless. The Futortentia has long since faded from his system.
battering around the inside of his ribcage like a bludger has left him with no capacity for the correct emotions.
“Ah,” Draco says, peering over Harry’s shoulder to watch his growing erection lift the hem of his sweater. “Fortunately, my stamina is unmatched in the city of London.”
memory anymore. It was introduced to her mind as a foreign element, as something new—something that had happened to someone else, maybe.”
) and Harry doesn’t see how he can insist Malfoy leave with him without seeming like a childish prig, so instead he grits out, “Fine.”
Harry’s still rubbing one side of his bum when Draco re-emerges from his room, hair neat and top all buttoned, shirtsleeves rolled back down without a crease in sight. The pink around his eyes has lightened enough that they’re almost unnoticeable, and Harry’s sure that by the time they arrive at Neville’s quarters, there will be no proof left of Draco having ever worn his brightly-colored goggles. It’s a bit disappointing, but Harry consoles himself with the fact that the full moon is approaching, and that means he has plenty of opportunities to see Draco’s glorious, post-brewing disheveled self.
the mess away) that Harry’s realized how Draco’s grown quiet. Harry has also realized that in the process of grooming Draco’s hair, he’s managed to shuffle closer and now, he finds that he can’t move away. Can’t or doesn’t want to, he hasn’t decided yet.
Harry tried to keep a frown off his face. It’s not like he didn’t appreciate it when Draco bought him things, because he did. Appreciate it, that is. But he didn’t need an expensive green sweater— not when he had a perfectly fine one upstairs. “Draco...”
“Mmm—” Draco can’t even find it in himself to keep up the scowl. Not when Harry’s fingers are weaving magic against his temples, against his forehead, diluting the pain— the steady, rhythmic motions making it something more bearable. “Good.”
makes its way out of the fridge, Draco’s eyes widen in horror before he hurriedly bins the thing and casts an air-freshening charm to boot. The scent hits Harry’s nose like a tickling charm and he scrunches his nose before, unable to reign the blasted thing in, he sneezes.
He feels Draco lean against him, and he lets go of Draco's hand only to wrap his arms around Draco’s waist. “When will it get better?” Draco asked, his voice rough and slightly cracking.
There’s a bark and a clatter, and a blur of a pup slides across the floor, stopping just a few inches from Harry’s shoes, all four of his little legs spread out as he blinks wide, excited eyes at his other owner.
Draco’s breath fans over his lips. A warm hand ghosts over his own. Harry's eyes widen and his heart beats wildly against his chest. Harry doesn’t know what’s happening (not really, he thinks he
He’s so close, and he knows once he allows himself to tip over there’s most certainly no going back for him.
He reins in a whimper at the loss of Draco’s touch. He raises himself on his elbows, breath coming in small bursts and chest tight. Deft fingers unbutton his jeans and pull his zip down. He lifts his hips off the bed as Draco tugs, pulling off his jeans, shortly followed by his pants. Harry shivers as his cock bobs free and is hit with cool air.
“That’s cashmere, in a shade of green that’s particularly difficult to find,” the amused and partially exasperated voice said, and the sound of it made Harry’s aggravation melt just a little, “And you are defiling it with your clutching. Give it here.”
Harry didn’t know what he expected when he stepped foot into the large entrance hall. Maybe he expected drapes of black cloth, or a pavilion of flowers lining up the walls, maybe he expected house-elves scrambling back and forth trying to fix whatever needed fixing before other guests arrived. Because he knew other guests
Eyes that belonged to a different face that held a playful smirk and its own roguish beauty. Eyes that once shone with love for Harry, love that could have rivaled his mother and father’s.
“Me neither,” Harry pauses, feeling the day’s exhaustion slowly creep up on him, making his eyes feel heavy. “I really hope you didn’t plan on kicking me out because I don’t think my legs want to cooperate.”
Draco’s not going to budge. He settles on, “I do not drool. And the floor in my room is much more comfortable.”
. Something behind Harry clatters and he most definitely refuses to look. “Whoever said Flitterblooms are harmless is sorely mistaken.”
And, really, he’s quite fond of his hands, which he still needs for the stack of essays he’s yet to grade. He’d never been thrilled at the prospect of writing essays when he was still a student, and that hadn’t changed when he joined the Auror Corps. Now, his almost two years of teaching has made him realize that if there’s anything he hates more than writing essays, it’s having to grade them.
Minerva’s lips twitch as she peers at them from her place at the center of the staff table, and as his colleagues continue to discuss his apparently wretched impulse control, not for the first time, Harry wonders just how his life has come to this.
Draco’s eyes are burning as they flick back up to Harry’s face. He doesn’t know what expression is on his face at that moment, but Draco’s gaze softens and Harry releases the breath he doesn’t even know he’s holding. More silky strands fall over Draco’s shoulder as he dips his head and starts pressing open-mouthed kisses over Harry’s chest. His collarbones. The ridges of his ribs. The planes of his stomach. The dark trail of hair disappearing into his pants. The straining outline of his cock against his jeans.
“I…” Harry’s hands are trembling, his body is warming up like a gush of fiendfyre has just set it alight. He really hopes he doesn’t set anything on fire. The back of his neck tingles. Sure, steady fingers thread against his. A warm forehead against his.
Draco nibbles lightly on the slope of Harry’s neck, and Harry leans against him. “Not here, I don’t.”
It’s odd how his Friday nights have morphed into this, but he’s comfortable and almost content, even if there’s a strange plant that’s been miserably failing to knot his shoelaces together for the past minute or so.
He knocks back his Firewhisky and relishes the warm burn at the back of his throat. At this point, he can’t quite remember how much he’s had—not when Neville keeps plying him with glass after glass—but Harry’s warm and loose-limbed and relaxed and he’s not complaining when another cold glass is thrust into his hands.
“Here.” Draco looks to his side and regrets it immediately when his vision swims. He feels like he’s taken a bludger to the head, which is probably a bit dramatic because Draco doesn’t
He feels the shiver of magic running through his head and when he raises his hand to check, he breathes a sigh of relief when he feels that the unruly mess was indeed his own hair, and not a bundle of moving, squiggly things.
Harry’s breath hitches. He squirms in his place underneath Draco trying to push nearer. Wanting more friction. He draws Draco close until their chests and mouths and stomachs are flush against each other, making the air around them a current of heat and a ripple of static. “Gods— Draco— I want— I can’t—”
“Lav, catch.” Another foil-wrapped chocolate sails across the room, and Lavender flashes Neville a grateful smile as she catches it.
of glass tears Harry’s gaze away from their snake-guest, and Draco looks so thoroughly displeased that Harry finds it difficult to stop his mouth from twitching. “You are being rather rude, you know.”
Harry’s ears perk at the tirade of colorful words coming from where he thinks is the kitchen and a spot of curiosity starts to trickle in and thaw his limbs. When the noises continue and are now accompanied by overly-dramatic gagging (only interrupted by the occasional incantations of household spells), the urge to see what’s causing all the ruckus in his kitchen has grown from a low buzz of interest to almost irresistible curiosity.
There’s a soft sigh against his mouth as they break for a needed breath, and Harry chases Draco’s lips with a displeased grunt.
and Harry lurches, hands scrambling on Draco’s back with a sob. “Although you’ll never get me out of my clothes at this rate.”
Artemis looks at him, all wide eyes and pudgy muzzle, both haughty and pleased with herself, and merely stretches—the long, white, fluffy line of her body bright against the dark wooden floor. She’s a piece of work, really, and a stark contrast to the little ball of energy that is Apollo, who’s still barking and running circles excitedly around her. She’s looking at him with an air of displeasure—short, stump of a tail twitching once to show offense at the riot he’s creating around the both of them.
This close, Harry still has a clear view of Draco’s chest. There’s a thin strip of skin that’s lighter than the rest, and it ribbons down from the right side of Draco’s chest to just above his belly button. Harry knew it’d be there, learned its existence from Draco’s drunken tirades months ago, but it’s still the first time he’s seen it, and the boiling guilt mixes with the molten desire in his veins, and Harry suddenly doesn’t know what to do with himself.
“Pass me the powdered ones on your left,” Draco instructs as he slips his work goggles and gloves in place. “Don’t spill anything, and no touching.”
Draco can see the way Harry rolls his eyes at him before he retrieves the soup bowl and settles on the floor, cross-legged, just by Draco’s head. “Well, I’m glad being sick hasn’t robbed you of your pleasant personality.”
Harry does not even remember why he accepted Minerva’s invitation to come back to Hogwarts earlier than planned, if not only to get a head start on lesson plans and to gather his wits about him in preparation for the coming term.
Draco looks at him, and his face is doing something Harry doesn’t even know how to describe. Harry likes to call it his thinking face but Draco disagrees. Not that that’s anything new. Draco waves his wand and the
“Must you?” Juicy fluids leak out while she cuts up her bloody steak and Harry watches with little fascination.
Draco’s looking up at him from his spot on Harry’s abdomen, his face is a bit blurry but Harry can still make out the spots of pink dusting over his face, and the blooming red marks on the side of his neck. His hair is a blob of white-blond on his head, probably dishevelled from where Harry’s fingers have been running through it earlier.
Their erections rub as their bodies are pulled flush together. Draco’s body jerks and his low groan sends ripples of want crashing over Harry.
Light explodes from behind his closed lids like the orb underneath the moonlight glowing bright. He trembles from the force of his orgasm, fingers clenching on Draco’s arms, as stripes of pearly white lace with Draco’s own cum on his stomach. Draco’s finger keeps moving inside him, brushing against his prostate over and over as Draco milks his cock for every last drop, and Harry just about sobs as wave after wave of pleasure seizes control of every fiber of his body.
, look at you.” He pinches Harry’s nipple—hard, merciless—at the same time that he fucks into him, making Harry swear. “You were made for me.”
Harry laughs, ebullient, because Draco is wrestling him out of his brand new Gap pajama trousers like they’re a particularly frightening squid wrapped around his legs. “If I thought he’d listen, I’d have told him ages ago. But a month is how long the investigation took, so it had to be a month. That’s the job.”
Harry’s rough fingers skating over pale skin, faint silver scars. Malfoy humming beneath him like a panther.
“Yes, Harry,” Hermione says, squeezing his shoulder, “our guest room’s always open. Well—I suppose we’ll have to turn it into a nursery eventually. But until then.”
Draco’s hands run over his back, over his shoulders to hold his head gently, thumbs stroking the shells of his ears. “Harry,” he says, between kisses, “just a bit further, darling, come along—” and then he darts out from beneath Harry’s next attack,
He can’t make out what he’s saying, since he’s speaking at a normal volume, but he knows the cadence, the tone. Before his mind can catch up, his body acts on instinct, leaving his blanket by the edge of the roof to race back into the stairwell, down one narrow creaking flight—and when he rounds the corner to the second, he freezes.
Harry’s saved from having to answer—better late than never—by Justin Finch-Fletchley sticking his head around the corner from Kingsley’s office to shout, “Oi, Potter! Get in here!”
Harry takes it. They lean forward again, and in the next moment they’re standing outside on the Manor lawn. It’s spring, the air light and fragrant, flowers in full bloom. A Draco who looks to be no older than four or five—baby fat on his face, cheeks ruddy, in herringbone shorts and green knee-high socks—is trying to get a broom off the ground. As they stand watching in silence, he very nearly succeeds. He gets a good six feet into the air before he starts wobbling; Harry lurches forward as if to catch him, but his Draco grabs his arm and holds him back.
He was right, as it turned out. Having Malfoy teach him was good incentive, but unfortunately Harry hadn’t gotten much better at Occlumency since Snape had tried to teach him at Hogwarts, so mostly he spent his sessions shouting at Malfoy and casting wandless, wordless hexes when he lost control of himself.
, Harry means to say, but words have started not-quite-working even more than usual, and his spine feels deliciously melty and hot. He barely manages to stagger back against the wall before he goes oozing to the ground.
Ron reaches out and catches her hand. Harry feels it abruptly, like a kick in the gut. They’re going to be parents. His two best friends—they’ve already done this one thing to set themselves apart from him, already gotten married and moved in and made him the third wheel, which on bad days he resents them for even though he knows he shouldn’t, and now…
Harry wrestles down the starving monster of grief inside of him, and nods. “Okay,” he says. “Let’s do it. I’m ready to do it.”
He knew, in some dark and removed corner of his mind, where cobwebs were growing and he rarely went, that Malfoy wasn’t taking him back to the Manor only for a cooling poultice—that somehow in the course of shouting at him and chasing him out of memories of quidditch and nightmares, Hagrid and the Weasleys, somehow by stepping in front of a Stinging Hex like a total idiot, Harry had managed to admit, subconsciously and without words, that there was not one single part of Malfoy's body he did not want to put his mouth all over.
Harry sits on a cold stone bench and tries to imagine what it would’ve been like to grow up here. Tiny, officious Draco, as he was in first year, mimicking his father’s disdainful sneer, tearing down empty hallways with no legions to command, no cronies to order about. The parties that might’ve been held out on this porch, this lawn, the ambient roar of laughter and conversation, maybe some music, champagne glasses floating themselves about and games of wizard’s croquet—surely the sort of company the Malfoys kept would play something as pretentious as croquet—shooting ebullient bursts of gold and pink sparks into the night sky.
“What? What was that?” Harry asked, a little confused. It surely couldn’t be anything harmful, unless his friends had been possessed by some evil-doer. But still, why was she spraying them with anything?
The three of them had just set off from the common room when Ron suddenly stopped in his tracks. “Shit, I think I left something.” He looked in his bag. “Yeah, I’ll have to pop back.”
Harry vaguely hears Neville offering to have him stay the night if he’s too pissed to make it back to his room, but he’s too busy wallowing to supply an answer.
. He gives himself a light squeeze and with his free hand he Summons the bottle of lube in his bedside table drawer, and tips a generous amount over the reddened head of his cock.
—and Harry knows the reasons because Draco told him all about it. He told him all about it months ago, once it was evident that Draco’s attempts at shooing Harry away only resulted in him planting himself in Draco’s workroom even more frequently. There’s a reason for every step and every instrument required in making this potion—well,
falls from his lips when he starts to feel more sticky than satisfied, and once the tingling sensation of the cleaning charm leaves him feeling less disgusting than a few seconds ago, he allows the heady state of well-being to consume him and chase all his doubts and uncertainties away, just for tonight.
Nonetheless, he tried to stifle the gnawing worry and panic that was brewing in the back of his mind. He called out, tentatively, “I’m home!”
His brow furrows in an echo of the small crease of concentration on Draco’s brow, and Harry tugs at himself the way he wants to smooth that little crease away. Slow and firm and sensuous.
He sucks on Draco’s bottom lip, earning himself a whimper, and Harry continues ravaging Draco’s mouth with his own. Their tongues roll together and it’s a battle of dominance as they lick into each other’s mouths—hands flying over shoulders and chests and arses, tugging and pulling
Draco raises a hand, and Harry’s mouth snaps shut. He watches the same long, pale fingers drag through white-blond hair. Harry can feel the weariness seep out of Draco in waves as exhaustion softens the hard lines and sharp angles of his face. Heat pools with a surprising rush in his belly. “Not tonight, Harry.”
Harry thinks he really could do without the very apparent blush on his cheeks, but the sound of his given name rolling off Draco’s tongue
Harry peered inside and ignored the sudden lump in his throat. Draco’s back was to him, facing the large portrait that now hung beside Lucius Malfoy’s, but even from this distance Harry could see the tight lines on his shoulders, the too stiff upright posture.
“Please, don’t,” Draco said, sounding almost pained, “You don’t know what it feels like to lose a mother.”
It’s a whirlwind of chaos as his kitchen rights itself. And in the middle of all this chaos is Draco Malfoy.
Harry whipped around at the sound of dragging footsteps, only to be greeted by an old, graying house elf. Kreacher bowed deeply, nose almost touching the floor, “Welcome, master.”
Harry stiffens. His leg starts to bounce almost rhythmically. “Mornings are always better when you’re here.”
“How is it that you always win, Headmistress?” Lavender sounds petulant, but she’s looking at Minerva with interest, as if she’s about to divulge the secrets of the universe.
It’s of little to no surprise when Harry learned first-hand that Neville’s rooms are filled with strange, unusual plant life. Accepting the Herbology post has only encouraged his friend’s enthusiasm for horticulture, and though sometimes Harry’s concerned about his questionable rearing practices, he’s happy that Neville’s managed to settle into his own, not-so-little niche. Having shared a dorm with him for seven years, Harry hardly blinks now when he discovers that the strange plant that’s been trying to knot his laces together turns out to be a thin, brightly colored, vine-y thing. It’s finally given up and is now wobbling past him, only to plop itself in front of Lavender Brown’s feet.
The last thing that Harry’s aware of is the gentle press of Draco’s lips against his shoulder before he lets himself get whisked away to dreams of pink and blue and purple and bright, glowing moons.
“I wasn’t sure whether you’d want to see me after…” Harry shrugs. “I thought you might want some space but—” Harry gestures from the glowing mustard pot to the bright moon.
“Oh,” Draco sounds and looks surprised to see Harry there. Funny, because if anyone here is supposed to be surprised, Harry reckons it should probably be him.  “Hello.”
as Harry’s fingers scratches and pets, obviously pleased with the affection he’s lavishing on her, and Harry’s irritation sizzles into nothing.
And with one look at that intense expression on his face, Harry knows that Draco is remembering that same night, three years ago.
Harry learned that it’s best to tune Lavender and Neville out whenever they start broaching these sorts of topics. It’s easy not to focus on their discussion anyway. Beside him, Draco’s pouring himself some fancy elf-made wine that Neville’s procured especially for him, and even if that doesn’t involve the brisk, measured motions of his dicing and crushing and stirring, Harry’s eyes  still follow the slow roll of Draco’s wrist, noting it’s strong, sharp lines.
dish, but it’s one of the few things he’s now comfortable with cooking. Once Draco got the correct proportion of spices down, he  immediately claimed the dish as his own. Even if it was Harry’s recipe to begin with. Not that Harry minded—he was too busy being pleased and insanely proud and stuffed with spoonfuls of spicy goodness.
a voice that sounds remarkably like Draco chides in his head—until it’s ready to be put in the potion.
“As long as master’s being in the wizard hole, Kreacher thinks,” the house-elf said, bowing deeply again.
Draco, on the other hand, the tit, doesn’t even look remotely concerned. Not even when Neville blatantly stares at the angry-looking lovebites on his neck.
“I still say he’s gotten tangled up in his brewing again.” A small green tendril of plant life dangles precariously from the hair on Neville’s temple as he turns to face them. Harry wonders if all Herbology professors always have some sort of greenery dangling from their hair. “You know he usually passes by the greenhouses to collect the roots himself, but I got an owl this morning asking for some.”
The striped red-white-yellow scales are still somewhat cold despite having been wrapped around Draco’s frame, but Harry doesn’t mind much. At least, the cool scales are the
“Freeing another house elf,” Harry snorts, and Draco swears he can feel Harry's exasperated glare all the way over here. “What do you think? I doubt you’d eaten yet and you need to drink medicine.”
Harry doesn’t know many snakes who can sound as exasperated as the one currently sliding from his shoulder to his lap.
“But—” Harry draws back, but Draco keeps his mouth firmly attached to Harry’s skin as it burns a path down his jaw, his neck, tongue dipping into his collarbone. “—we should talk—”
“Huh.” Draco’s face is thoughtful as he chews on his inner cheek. “You know I can’t remember what it
arrive, Draco would not have it any other way. It was only a matter of when they would start arriving.
The scars move like an undulating wave as Lavender quips an eyebrow. Harry is so used to it by now that he doesn’t need to remind himself not to stare anymore. “Please, I could see you making eyes at your roast potatoes as soon as I entered the Great Hall.”
“What the fuck is this?” Harry half-groaned, half-yelled— one hand on the banister, another clutching a dark green sweater with a price tag that suggested how the galleons, in his opinion, could have fed three small families.
Harry’s hand splays against Draco’s chest—he can feel Draco’s heart beating, strong and quick against his palm—and Draco’s body comes alive underneath his touch. There’s a hand sliding into place on Harry’s shoulder and Harry’s distantly aware of the way Draco’s hand tenses and relaxes, almost as if it can’t decide whether to pull Harry closer or push him off. Harry’s fingers fist into Draco’s shirt, wanting to keep him in place, but then Draco’s hand gives a firm push, and Harry obliges albeit reluctantly.
Draco must be uncomfortable enough as it is. Even without the knowledge of him playing a part in Harry’s spell mishaps.
Despite his lighter tone, the hesitation is clear on Draco’s face, and it somehow eases the rumbling worry that’s been racing through Harry’s mind for the past few minutes.
“Have you seen the state it’s in? It would be a more acceptable lump of cheese than it would be as a sweater.”
Harry takes a moment to close his eyes and breathe. The delicious scent of curry swims in the air and the familiar scene unravels behind Harry’s closed lids. “Draco.”
Harry eyes the brightly-coloured reptile—she looks quite content just draped around him like this, and he knows how this snake captured Draco’s attention, of course he does. It’s like Poseidon and Apollo and Artemis all over again. Still, he wonders just how many more animals Draco will be bringing home and just when Harry will be able to finally put his foot down.
“What is she saying?” Draco mutters, a steady, warm weight against Harry’s chest, a stark contrast to the cool, winding movement of their snake.
Harry peels off his robe and throws it carelessly over the couch—it’s already messy, anyway, and he’ll clean up later, he swears. There are more urgent matters to attend to, if Draco’s cooking, singing self is any indication, and most of the time it is. He’s almost at the hallway when heavy thuds race toward him, and Harry grins, bracing himself for impact.
“That’s thrice now,” Harry mutters as he enters the doorway, “You know, if I keep being stood up, I’m going to start thinking that you really don’t want me around...”
Draco pretends he doesn’t hear that. He wants to lift his head and look at what Harry’s doing in there, but his head is heavy and his body has decided to become useless and jelly-like. “What exactly are you doing in there?”
Neville clears his throat, and the look he’s giving Harry is both kind and uncertain, if not a little amused. “If you’re suddenly the kissy kind of drunk, Harry, please, er, don’t.”
“You have things growing out of your head that are worse than your hair, which is quite a remarkable feat even for you,” he says, in an afterthought, “And your legs are useless, slimy, lumps of jelly.”
to check the time, the delight dissipates and is replaced with something bordering distress because: “We’re going to be late. Merlin, Potter, what use is your poking around my workroom if you can’t even alert me as to the time?”
Harry thinks he looks just as, if not more, wrecked. At least, he feels like he is. Broken apart by the thoroughness of Draco’s mouth and hands and fingers.
One by one, each tentacle wraps around its wrestling partner, and in one quick motion, the daring flitterbloom tugs. Its neighbor is unearthed from its pot which hits the edge of a table with a resounding
He imagines Draco’s bright grey eyes on him, watching him like he does when he explores Draco’s workroom, following his every movement, and Harry thinks that whatever spare blood is left in his body rushes to his aching cock. He sees Draco’s piercing eyes behind his closed lids, focused solely on him as Harry pleasures himself, sees Draco crawl over Harry’s supine form that’s already covered in a thin sheen of sweat. Mind-Draco is all sharp angles and measured movements, and he knocks Harry’s hand away, replaces it with his own, insistent in taking Harry apart by his own hand.
Lavender laughs, wickedly amused, when the vine-y thing attempts to climb atop Neville’s head but ends up pulling out a few hairs in the process. Harry is cheered when her smile stretches so wide that it manages to almost clear the ever-present shadows cast by the scars that mar her pretty face. She needs to smile more. They
There’s a stream of coughing at his side as Neville chokes on his drink. Lavender waves her fork at him, bloody steak speared and all, and Harry’s just thankful that his lunch remains fluid-free despite the abundance of liquid sources coming from either side of him. “You do
He felt Draco’s hands came up to cover his, and Harry allows himself to support Draco’s weight as he leans back against Harry’ chest. “Well, that’s a horribly pleasant thought,” Draco said.
And when Harry's eyes flickered open, he saw that the earlier distress had gone. Draco was looking at him-- a smile on his lips, all warm gray eyes filled with that something that he could never name but made his stomach leap and gave his chest pleasant bouts of warmth-- and he knew.
The silence is heavy and uncertain as they make their way up to Harry’s room, and even though Harry’s sure he can walk a straight line without assistance—he thinks he can even do star jumps without falling into a heap of tangled limbs at this point, having been shocked near as sober by the mess he’s managed to get himself into—he still lets Draco hold him up. The physical proximity does nothing to bridge the careful distance that Draco’s enforced since he pushed Harry off, but Draco’s not running for the hills and he’s letting Harry nudge in close, and that’s something, at least.
“Do you still have a stock of Hangover Potion? Because I will not take kindly to you banging down my door on a Saturday morning just because of a bloody headache.”
Harry tries not to roll his eyes and quip some remark about Draco’s ability of stating the obvious and unnecessary.
But Malfoy Manor looked the same as it always did. Save for the telling silence that echoed through the halls as Tippy escorted him to the West Wing, where she has informed him that— “
He knows what’s happened, of course. Knows it by the way his chest seems tighter, by the way his arms and legs are stiffer, by the way his vision is still a bit blurry even with his glasses on, by the way his body is giving little shivers that echo the earlier trembling that shook him from the tiny corners of his mind to the little nerves of his toes.
Considering how much Draco’s been to Harry’s own quarters, Harry can’t help but find it curious how he’s only ever been inside Draco’s room less than a handful of times before, and only to deposit Draco into his bed after he’s gone and gotten himself pissed as fuck. It’s never left him with much time to survey the interior but now that he’s given free reign to snoop around, he finds that he can’t focus on anything else but Draco.
Draco bristles. Honestly, is he not the Healer here? He’s perfectly capable of taking care of himself, thanks. “Really, Harry, I’m perfectly fine.” He shrugs out from under Harry’s hands and starts toward the kitchen. He wobbles. The room spins around him. And Harry is suddenly gripping him, hands bracing around his waist.
He especially likes it when it’s Draco who’s doing the brewing. Not that he’s watched anyone else brew potions recently it’s just—there’s something about the steady way Draco handles the ingredients, the fluid motion of his wrist when he stirs, the intense look on his face, his lips pursed and his brow furrowed, as he dices with impressive precision, the elegant twist of fingers when he brings in some vapors for a whiff…
They pass by a ghost or two who watch them with thinly veiled interest. Not for the first time, Harry wonders just how many pissed professors the Hogwarts ghosts have witnessed stumbling through corridors throughout their existence. Surely he and his friends haven’t been the only ones who snuck a drink or two.
Harry eyes his companion. He notes the faint crease on his forehead, and the way his lips are set in a thin line. Harry sighs, practically hearing the admonishing tone seep through that disapproving expression. “Just spit it out, Draco.”
He already spies some new sprigs lined up in their clear glass containers, sitting on the second shelf, and there’s some pink and honey-tinted liquid corked in an expensive-looking vial on the top shelf that Harry’s sure wasn’t there the other day. He’s curious enough to want to inspect it more closely, except Draco’s still preparing his ingredients, and Draco doesn’t appreciate Harry poking about when he’s trying to concentrate. Harry learned that the hard way and he thinks neither of them wants a repeat of that unfortunate night.
“Yes, Harry,” Draco answers, just a bit petulant, and finally turns around to look at him. “I brought home a big great deadly snake just for the thrill of having to brew multiple anti-venom potions because I’ve nothing else to do all day.”
“I’m revisiting that particular decision,” says Draco matter-of-factly. He takes off his cloak and sends it flying to a far corner of the room. The dark pink shirt reminds Harry of how Draco’s skin looked in the Greenhouse, and his trousers move like a second skin as Draco strides across the room and spells the flame inside the light orb. “If I’m just going to get dirty again, getting cleaned up now would be counterproductive, don’t you agree?”
Harry has the remarkable urge to slam his head down on his roast potatoes, but before his plan can come to fruition, a stern, yet amused voice sounds from beside Filius. “Five Galleons that Harry caves before the day ends.”
Despite all that, she finally makes her way beside Harry’s feet and regards him with curiosity from her place on the floor, tasting the air around him. Seemingly satisfied with what she finds, she moves up Harry’s leg, twisting her way around him to rest at his shoulders.
Harry snorts, eyebrows raised. “Sure it was.” Something smooth and soft brushes against Harry’s leg, and he spies Artemis’ white coat as she settles near the foot of Draco’s chair, curling contentedly by his side.
Turning, he burrows his face into his soft, comfortable pillow and finally falls into a dreamless sleep.
It was only then that Harry looked at the portrait of the woman in front of him. It echoed the woman he remembered in the forest eight years ago— beautiful, harsh aristocratic features, eyes that flashed with grim determination. But he knew her better now, knew the kindness that made the cold color soften, knew the love that could make her entire face glow. And he couldn’t help but feel a twinge of sorrow as he looked into those stormy eyes and remembered a different set of eyes.
Draco pauses with a sigh and throws Harry such an unimpressed look that he barely refrains from holding back a snigger. “I did not say that. I am also not going to stroke your ego.”
Harry’s fingers slide from his temple down to the sides of his neck, and stretches along Draco’s shoulders, pushing and loosening knots that Draco doesn’t even know he has. Harry’s thumbs circle just below his nape and presses just
It’s not like Harry isn’t used to Draco’s extended trips by now, and he knows that they’re a necessary and unavoidable part of his job, but that doesn’t mean he’ll ever get used to missing the sodding prat and wishing he’s there beside Harry and cuddling him to death—breathing against Harry’s neck, head slotted neatly in that little crook of shoulder and jaw as if the spot was carved especially for him, arms and legs thrown over Harry as if to make up for his tendency to hog the blankets.
Harry wets his lips. He sees the way Draco’s eyes catch the movement. Bright grey eyes chase the flick of Harry’s tongue on his lower lip and Harry watches as Draco visibly gulps.
They start a steady rhythm of undulating hips, and Harry’s cock throbs as it rubs against the fabric of his pants and the outline of Draco’s prick.
He watched as Draco closed his eyes, and he saw how the stiff set of his shoulders melted away, how the blank, detached expression crumbled into a sorrow so deep that it pained Harry to look further. Suddenly, there were no words that could be said. Harry held out his hand in silent offering.
It’s maddening, Harry thinks, the sheer amount of control that Draco has even when he’s not brewing anything.
“’M fine,” Harry mutters, before Draco can even open his mouth to inquire. Or reprimand. Harry can never tell when Draco’s looking at him like that. “Relax.”
Draco narrows his eyes but says nothing. He merely tightens his hold around Harry’s waist and then proceeds to half-dragging him through the open doors of the hospital wing.
Mind-Draco teases him with strokes of fingers underneath the glans, alternates quick tugs with slow, downward strokes.
Harry eyes him warily, only a bit ruffled by the pale pink-red eyes that survey him from their place round Draco’s shoulders. It’s quite a sight, really, Artemis and Apollo and Draco and… well,
