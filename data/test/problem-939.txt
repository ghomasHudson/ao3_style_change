,’ he thought, looking at the blond woman.  ‘
“It’s alright, Soror,” her brother said quietly, smiling mirthlessly.  “I would have said the same thing in her place.  Still…don’t forget yourself as well, Saira.  I won’t go easy on you if I have to remind you why I’m in charge.”  He stared at her with his winter-like eyes until she looked down.
Jordan asked quietly, “What’s that?”
“Trust me,” Draco smirked, “you’re producing a similar reaction.”
Marylin turned around and scowled heavily at him, her hands clenching.
“I don’t trust them,” the Malfoy heir said again, his mouth tightening and ice burning in his eyes. His godfather sighed and in an uncharacteristic gesture, laid a sympathetic hand on the young man’s shoulder.
’ Jordan realized.  He only saw that choker a couple of times but he had often seen his cousin rub something on his neck whenever he was stressed or contemplating something.  It was one of the two pieces of jewelry he wore.  The other was the Opacre Pendent, which held his Jewel.  Both pieces were worn under his shirt and hardly visible, which hid the sign that he was a Head. Unlike other Heads, his cousin didn’t wear things that proclaimed his title.  He didn’t need to, not with the presence he had.
“I hope he isn’t asking you to teach again!” she sniffed.  “After all this nonsense this year, we hardly need you -”
that vampire is a pureblood. However, even then, they would not be able to use the power of the jewel at its maximum potential if they had been pureblood.
“Don’t touch him!” Lest hissed, body tall and stiff with teeth bared, and Qye remembered a Christmas so long ago with that same pose that he laughed at and he screamed again, lunging for the treacherous vampire once more.
,’ he thought numbly.  ‘
“Then again…” he said softly, his dark sapphire eyes gleaming. The next instant, in half a blink, he snapped his arm back and hurled the acorn into the hidden branches of the tree.
Voldemort continued to chuckle as he turned to a dispassionate Dazain, gesturing to Harry who’s face continued to wear the strange, unfocused expression.  “As you see, our worlds share such similar weaknesses, placing their faith in something truly quite pathetic - ”
…and was surprised to find his hand still in the gentle but firm grip of the vampire.
He raised the vial to his lips and paused for a moment.  His mind was pulsing again and he furrowed his brow slightly.  Shaking his head, he tipped the vial back and swallowed the citrus-tasting potion.
“All the more reason to try, Harry!” she said brightly, finally plopping him down on the chair and looming ominously with the silver eyeliner.  “You’re sure to get people to notice you and if you’ll just let me add a little more, I know you’ll have a ton of dates in no time to - ”
'. All that had done was make Lest move more than any other duel, seemingly able to tell when and where the next attack was coming. As the ropes started to fall from the last spell, having completely missed their target, they stopped midway and flew towards Dean. Professor Opacre had to spend the next five minutes explaining what went wrong and other helpful hints while she struggled with the complicated knots.
“Harry,” the elderly figure said gently. “Harry, calm yourself. You are safe now.”
He tore open his curtains in time to see Harry hurl a tray of potion vials at his headboard, shattering on impact and falling to join the mess of items on the barely slept in bed.  Books lay scattered on the bed, on the floor, the trunk at the foot of the bed wide open as Harry reached in for another object to throw.  One of the curtains hung loosely from a bedpost as if someone had tried to tear it off and the Firebolt was tossed carelessly aside.
A thousand things of what he could do flashed through his mind and he sighed regretfully. ‘
“They are to monitor their well-being,” she said.  “I recommended daily sessions to start off with but I anticipate fading those to every other day and then weekly eventually if I see progress.  I also recommended myself, as I am already familiar with the case and bound by the secrecy spell, but if you would like another individual, I can provide solid and confidential references.”
Qye said, startled and worried, broken free from shock.
He spluttered for a moment, incoherently and vehemently denying anything and everything.  Unfortunately, he was unable to come up with a sensible response when an angry voice came from behind him.
“And I would have found and killed you,” Remus added.  “Then taken him for myself.”  This time it was Sirius that threw him a wounded look, to which Remus shrugged lightly.
:: Qye said softly.  ::
He knew she was trying to help, really he did.  But he just didn’t want to talk.  He didn’t think that there were even
“A dark spell, Poppy,” Dumbledore said grimly, from where he stood next to a pale McGonagall, recently returned from securing that the rest of the students who were injured in the attack so that they were unable to intrude in the private room they had set up.
Weasley gazed at him, a thoughtful look in his eyes. Qye tilted his head, making himself wear a curious smile. After a moment, a grin appeared on the redhead’s face, bemused but a grin nevertheless. Laughing slightly, Weasley clapped him on the shoulder again and Qye forced himself not to flinch.
There would most likely be a bruise but -
“Why you’re so tired,” Ron said irritably, crossing his arms across his chest.  “You went to bed at the same time I did, Hermione made sure of that.”  He narrowed his eyes suddenly.  “Unless you got up in the middle of the night.”
small part of him - actually kind of. . .missed. . .the interaction between them.
As he stepped though the green flames back into his own fireplace, Remus looked up, his face paling.
Hagrid had explained to the class that Harry was not delusional and petting thin air but was rather petting a certain type of winged horse, called a Threstral.  The black horse was invisible to anyone except those who had seen death with their own eyes.  He explained that they were employed here at Hogwarts to pull the carriages so that in case of any attack, they would have the element of surprise to the attackers.
He glanced at her and she looked worriedly at the look in his eyes.
She froze for a second.  “Lest?” she breathed, heart skipping beats.  He glanced at her, still with that look in his eyes before he swept past her to the room he occupied.  He paused at the doorway, his hand gripping the frame.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right,” she said as she turned the page and crossed her leg over one knee.  “Well, unfortunately, you’re not getting off that easy.  Let’s go back to this subconscious potion…”
“Harry’s too good of a child,” she sniffed. “Draco might be telling him things but I doubt he’ll be set against you by his words alone. From what I’ve seen, Harry doesn’t care much for rumors or reputations.” She was silent and then continued in a quiet voice. “I never wondered why. Suppose it kind of makes sense now…”
Shaking his head from the first meal he had in months, he recalled what happened next with a slight smirk. Pomfrey had picked up the tray with a satisfied smile and Qye had watched her magic it away. She then prodded and tested him for an hour or two, to Qye’s annoyance, trying to find the reason to his (Harry’s) speedy recovery. Finding nothing, she huffed and temporarily gave up, to Qye’s relief. She went away but kept her eye on him so much that he was confined to the damn bed. It wasn’t until after lunch – a meal he ate with just as much relish as breakfast – that he found his chance. After finishing his meal, she sternly told him to lie in bed and rest – to which he responded innocently and meekly – and then returned to her office. He had waited a full minute after hearing her office door close, then jumped out of bed, hastily changed into Harry’s clothes lying at the end of the bed, and fled the Infirmary with a victorious smile.
She stopped a foot away and her violet eyes stared hard at the top drawer, the one which contained cards from various vampire businesses, the take out menus from friendly eateries and the false bottom with the one object she had put away last year at the request of the Pater Nosferatu and his sister.
“I…I’ve just been tired lately,” the other boy mumbled.  “With school and stuff.  I just need a bit more sleep, that’s all.”  Ron shook his head wearily, feeling the hurt rise a bit more.  That wasn’t all.  There was more and Harry wasn’t telling.
-------
This conversation was not right. Without reason, his panic started to lift slightly. Why were they talking about this? As if he didn’t have enough to worry about with Qye being silent and his hazy memory and now this. They had seemed fine with him before and now…
Ron's head whirled around but Harry didn't even wait for Professor Opacre's acknowledgement, beginning to push his way through the crowd. The redhead still somehow managed to catch the sleeve of his room and he glanced back at the irate redhead.
“I don’t think I’m ready to be…dignified…with a ‘Mister’ quite yet,” Lest said stiffly. He growled suddenly. “For Hélène’s sake, do I look
he thought, annoyed at himself. ‘
Qye said quietly.  Harry started, having forgotten about the other boy.  Before he could say anything, Draco continued.
:: Qye whispered teasingly – smirking at him.  His blush deepened slightly as he recalled what had happened yesterday.  He dropped his eyes down to the ground, recalling the feeling of the other boy’s hands against his own…
The nurse inhaled sharply and Lest stirred as she took a step forward.  “Albus, did he…was it - ”
“Not with vampires, no,” Snape said coolly, turning away from the angry vampire and walking back to his desk.  Professor Opacre’s eyebrow twitched slightly.
He tried to not delve into it, tried to tell himself he had enough to think about and good things were good things that shouldn’t be broken.  He wanted to believe that maybe life was leveling off to a state of normalcy.
Harry muttered, the exhaustion of the day catching up to him.
Qye muttered, confusion and alarm growing.
He blinked at his captured hand, confused.  Glancing up, he found the vampire studying him with a detached look upon his face.  He licked his dry lips and grew more uncomfortable when the dark blue eyes focused on them.
“Apology accepted,” the Opacre replied coolly. His dark blue eyes flickered. “I…I apologize for making you fall out of the tree.” Myn squeaked, her eyes turning into saucer-sizes.
She looked at him and then, slowly, hopefully, began to smile back.
"He'd better be okay or Mother will cry when she's seen what I've done to you," a feminine voice hissed a little further off. His head buzzed and he looked over his shoulder.
Harry began, confused.
Harry watched nervously as his Head of House quietly closed the door to Dumbledore’s office.  She hadn’t said a single word from the Great Hall to the Headmaster’s office and before she had left, she had placed comforting hand on his shoulder and squeezed.  Then she had left quickly, her eyes still strangely bright.  To say the least, he was highly worried.
“…report when he…”
:: Harry asked, surprised and worried by the sudden silence.  ::
“Alright, that tells us you’re not immortal,” Blaise continued.  He raised an eyebrow and said, “But that doesn’t tell us how old you are.”
Harry frowned. Wait. He shifted around, absently arranging Hermione's tense hold so he could see better and...he blinked. Ron wasn't looking at Lest's eyes. It took a few more glances between the two of them but he confirmed it. Lest's eyes were trying to capture Ron's but Ron's always seemed firmly fixated on some other part of the vampire's face, even as he moved from one foot to the other.
Qye knew that no matter how hard he tried to act like Harry, he wouldn’t be able to pull it off completely. And since he knew next to nothing about Harry’s personal past, he knew he wouldn’t be able to say anything if they brought something like that up. And that would certainly cause more than a few raised eyebrows, something Qye did not need.
Malfoy steadily met his gaze.  “And like I told you, that’s between me and him.”
“They’re ready for you now,” Smethwyck said gently, holding the door open.  He tilted his head, his brow creasing as he caught sight of Harry.  “Is he - ”
“Harry,” she said softly, “I’m sorry about what I said.  I spoke without thinking and I should have realized why you could see them.  I was just so caught up in the moment that I didn’t realize - ”
“Malfoy’s Galleons are just good as anyone else’s,” Fred said cheerfully as he popped up behind Zabini, making the Slytherin jump.
“This is the same one you had in your mind a few months ago, isn’t he?” Dazain said absently, his gaze searching Harry’s as the teenager uncomfortably shifted.  “The one who slipped me?”
Ron’s eyes narrowed more.  “What was that?”
– breathed and his frustration spiked up another notch.
:: Qye said.  Harry couldn’t agree more.
Harry had no interest in asking Lest.
“I suppose I just don’t want to question it too much,” Draco shrugged, dropping one of his hands on the post.  “And I wouldn’t exactly say it’s been easy.”
They caught up to Hermione and Harry grinned as he heard Ron and Hermione began to bicker, catching “No House pride” and “More to life than fighting.” Stretching his arms slightly, he glanced to the side and watched Dean try to comfort a still gloomy Seamus while Neville looked caught between being sympathetic and panicking himself.
Harry said uncertainly.
“Yes, well,” Snape continued, his lips curling into an unpleasant smile.  “Until that happy day comes, I have to continue to deal with you all.  And I have decided – and at Dumbledore’s request as well – that in order to try and make some of you not make me look an incompetent teacher in the O.W.L. exams, I will decide where you all sit.”  He picked up his parchment.  “In other words, seating chart.”
“How are you okay with that?” he hissed at Remus, alternating his glare between his friend, between Lest, between Dumbledore himself because the vampire was still here.
“Did you have a nice trip?” she questioned, moving back after he hugged her back.  She looped her arm through his, leading him to the carriage waiting outside the station.
:: Harry replied.  He felt a bit of worry well up in him.  Qye was acting odd.  ::
Qye muttered in the back of Harry’s mind, seeming to come back to himself. The presence of Professor Opacre seemed to soothe him and Harry could feel him begin to relax.
“You should think a little highly of yourselves, I suppose,” drawled another, sauntering closer as Malfoy’s shield dissipated.  “Mere children making such nuisances of themselves.”  He saw him glance over at Sprout, leaning heavily on Neville and still trying to hold onto her wand.  “How proud you must be of them.”
He certainly didn’t expect Draco’s eyes to darken and his jaw clench.
! how could they take a breath in his
“I don’t agree with this,” he hissed and she nodded, unsurprised.
Harry leaned against the bed, crossing his arms and looking down at the floor.  Qye had a point.  He doubted anyone, not even Ron or Hermione, would believe him if he told them he had a voice in his head that he had conversations with.  Maybe Dumbledore…but he didn’t want to take the chance.
Everything had gone…odd. Woken up with a fever. Went through an upsetting conversation with Ron and Hermione. Was reminded how grateful he was to have friends like them and comforted by their presence. Received…unsettling…news about new encounters with Lest and the consequences he would face from people. Uncomfortably found out that he was missing an entire day’s worth of memories which made him rather uneasy. Having to deal that he was stuck in the Infirmary for the entire weekend.
Maybe he should take a vacation.  An early retirement even.  The things happening right now, this hadn’t been what he had been elected for, he was only the Minister of Magic not some -
Remus didn’t bother asking if Harry was okay anymore, gritting his teeth as he caught yet another scent of blood in the corridor, coming from a young man standing vigilant by a doorway around a corner. The vampire sharply watched Remus pass but said nothing as the Headmaster opened the door.
,’ she thought firmly to herself.  ‘
Lest said nothing and Marylin probed a bit more. “Do you believe what he said? What Dumbledore said about Harry?”
“What about legibility?” she questioned as she opened the folder.  “I had to have Abbie tell me you actually wrote ‘help me’ and not go to hell or something.  Honestly, I’ve seen first years with better handwriting.”
A blush crawled onto the green-eyed boy’s face as he rolled his eyes and resumed his trek to breakfast, inwardly (very) thankful that no one had noticed his moment of silliness. “So I guess the joke wasn’t funny?”
“Never had a need before you came,” she mumbled and he shot her a dirty and unamused look. Refraining from rolling her eyes, she turned a stern look to the two uneasy Gryffindors. “Now, is there a reason why you two are rushing through the corridors without looking where you are going?”
“Yes,” Sirius said as Remus echoed him quickly, their voices overlapping.
“Open to suggestions here,” Blaise Zabini muttered as he cast a shimmering spell across the corridor and forcing the vampires back again.  The first vampires that had crossed it had immediately lost their focus and began attacking their comrades before they had shaken out of it a few minutes later.  They had since been wary every time he cast it and it gave them all a brief moment of rest as they sent injured and exhausted back to the defended group and regained their strength.  His face was strained and he swayed on his feet.  “I think I’ve only got one or two more of Mother’s dazzlers before I’m done.  And unless Granger’s managed to dig her way through that wall, I think we’re truly and well fucked here.”
he whispered.
he sighed.
“I do have to say though,” Hermione said as they stood up to head back, “I’m surprised how better you’ve gotten at studying.”
one to wake you up like
:: Qye said slowly.
The fangs were bared.
Ron opened his mouth - probably to tell him it could - but he didn't wait. He pulled his sleeve away and dodged through his curious classmates to the front, wand sliding into his hand. Professor Opacre was beaming at him from the front of the room but he only spared her a glance before he took the spot everyone else had taken, hand tight on his wand. He raised his green eyes as the female vampire thanked him profusely, barely hearing her.
A sharp crack echoed in the room.
“Somebody get Professor Dumbledore!”
"Of course," he said, unpleasantly smiling, "perhaps some of your memories are suitably embarrassing.  I wouldn't want to traumatize any of you.  Only one of you will take the potion at the end of the class.  The potion will take the entire period.  Well?  What are you waiting for?  Begin!"
Lying on top of the books had been a ring with emeralds and sapphires.  The ring had looked extremely expensive and he wondered who would have just left it in the compartment.  He had looked at it often and for some reason, Professor Opacre kept popping into his mind.  The ring looked like something that would suit her and he idly thought that if she wasn't evil and bent on killing on him, he might leave it on her desk for her birthday if he couldn't find the original owner.
to avoid the flare of fire from Ron's wand. He heard his classmates exclaim - not even bothering to hide their excitement - at finally seeing
Something slammed into his mind.
She sighed and leaned back in her chair.  ‘
Taking a deep breath, she called out the first name on the list.  “Lavender Brown,” she said, lifting her head, idly playing with her quill.
At Hogwarts, in the Infirmary, the monitoring spells steadily flickered.
Harry glanced back down at his half-done essay and grimaced.
He nervously waited for the rest of the class to leave so he could ask Professor Opacre for “help”.  He had told Ron and Hermione it was a question for the O.W.L.s and shrugged off Hermione’s hurt offer of help, reassuring her that he knew she could and promising to review it with her.  Ron gave him a long look before dragging Hermione away, coaxing her with a promise that if Harry didn’t join them in ten minutes they’d be back.
Sirius drank the rest of his Firewhiskey and returned to the plans.  He went through all this, the hiding, the cold, for a godson he barely saw but loved more than his own life.  He jotted another possible location for a Death Eater gathering and hoped James and Lily understood he did it all so he could one day be with Harry.
Qye muttered and didn't elaborate when Harry made a curious sound. The rest of the class was again silent but this time Harry could hear a few coughs that sounded too much like cover ups. A few Slytherins weren't even bothering to hide their smirks.
“Harry likes Draco very much,” she mumbled.
“Listen, why don’t we get out of here?” Harry said quickly, turning around so they couldn’t see his face.  He had been preparing two weeks for when everyone came back but he still wasn’t sure if he was controlling his face properly.  “I’ve been waiting for you two for about half an hour and I’m freezing.  Why don’t we go to the Tower?”
His mind was like newly spun glass, fragile and getting even more so with every second that was an eternity.  He shivered in the arms of someone, hardly aware of his physical state.  His mind, so fragile, something on the other side of the glass, he could almost see it.  It was trying to break free, trying to get out, escape and take part of him and his mind quivered, the spider threads holding it together quivering to keep it. . .
Harry flushed.
Harry rubbed his head, glancing down the passage that led out.
“He also said Dazain, Severus,” Dumbledore said sternly, looking warningly at the man glaring coldly at the DADA teacher. “And I know of the bad blood history between the Opacres and Dazains so I’m not concerned with any duplicity.” Snape’s lip curled but he refrained from saying any more. The two Opacres stayed silent as well but a flicker of surprise went through their eyes at the extent of Dumbledore’s knowledge of them and the Dazains.
Why was he even answering?  Why was he keeping up this charade that the voice was anyone other than himself?
“It’s a temporary effect, after which the memory dissipates and returns to its owner unless it’s stored in a preservative container such as a pensieve,” Hermione explained.  Harry glanced up, frowning slightly.  She gave him a look back.  “It should be more than enough time for you to look them over and help you find whatever you’re looking for.  And of course we’ll be there with you - ”
“Oh, sweet Merlin,” Seamus repeated again, the stunned look still on his face.  “It was
Silently groaning with agony, he forced the primitive feelings rising in him away.  Taking a deep breath to calm – and cool – himself, he looked at him, unable to hide the gentle look in his dark blue eyes.
Qye scoffed and pulled out another book, looking down at it.  “We turn sixteen in July.”
“I’m fine,” he muttered, his eyes falling down to where Malfoy’s hand rested on top of his own.  He swallowed, feeling his blush deepen.  Malfoy continued to look at him, a few locks of his blond hair falling into his face.
“Lest?” Harry blurted out, blinking rapidly as his hand dropped away from his wand.  His heartbeat started to settle from where it had begun to pound furiously against his chest.
“Are you?”
He frowned a bit more, some unease creeping into him.  ::
“That’s up for debate if you don’t hold the rest back,” Draco said coolly, tilting his head over to where the rest of their Slytherin housemates lounged by the bar area, eyeing their group.  Harry saw Pansy Parkinson scowling, surrounded by her friends, before the crowd moved again and blocked their view.
“That’s good to hear, Harry.  I don’t want one of my best students lost.”  Harry blushed even more while Ron sniggered.  The vampire turned on him next and added lightly, “That counts for you too, Mr. Weasley and Ms. Granger.  You three are among my top students and I won’t have any of you bailing out on me by getting injured.”
“Where do you think?” Ron managed to snap back as he shook him off, adrenaline coursing through him.  He saw Hermione and his sister pulled back into the group of students as Sinistra put down another beast.  He met Hermione’s worried eyes and saw her glance over to Malfoy next to him.  “Probably right in the thick of this, as always.”
Harry took a deep breath and spat at Voldemort.
Draco glanced at him.  “Venators,” he said.  He rolled his shoulders and looked back over at the Shrieking Shack.  “They’re an association of…well.  For legal and practical reasons, hunters aren’t exactly sanctioned by any government vampires reside in.  The wizarding world and vampires long ago made an unspoken agreement to stay out of each other’s way.  It was basically understood that if they were ever to enter a conflict, the damage would be devastating.  So Venators are the ones outside of the law to call should a vampire ever turn rogue.  For obvious reasons, the vampires don’t take too kindly of others interfering with what they perceive to be their own affairs but…” He shrugged.  “If they can’t handle it, the Venators are there to make sure no one else gets hurt.”
Sirius said nothing, breathing in deep and glaring hard, sharp pricks of pain growing in his hands as he fought the urge to leap for the vampire.
Another nod.
Lest took a deep breath and closed his eyes.  “I know.”
“Mr. Potter’s magic needs a stabilization charm,” Pomfrey said stiffly, holding Harry by the other arm and gently steering him closer to the Healer.  “And the other one didn’t want to stay behind.”
"Now then," Professor Opacre said, clapping her hands together and smiling at the huddled group, some taking Neville's example and shrinking back so as to avoid being seen, "who wants to be first?"
“Now,” Dumbledore said quietly, blue eyes still twinkling.  “I think you are all quite wondering who your new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is going to be.  In an effort to unite all the magical creatures and people, we have an ambassador who will be staying with us this year.  I would like all of you to show her the same respect and courtesy that you would should any member of this staff and anyone who does not will be dealt with that according.”  He turned to his right and the hooded figure stood up, lifting pale hands to push down the hood.
Marylin carefully looked at her brother as she straightened her Gemmae and the scarf tied around her waist, her brief happiness fading.  “Yes…I think it’s with Draco, too, though he wouldn’t say anything.”
He frowned as he stood up, discarding the trash and cleaning his materials.  Qye was sounding odd again.  His voice was almost…mechanical.  As if he was just responding automatically without thinking about it.  Considering the turbulent the feelings he was giving off were, his emotionless voice alarmed Harry greatly.
“It’s true,” Jacob piped up and Jordan groaned, wanting to hit his idiot twin.  Jacob didn’t seem to notice his warning look and continued, grinning slightly.  “Those Dazains are good and whipped, cousin.  No sweat.”
“What does that mean to you?” Wainscott asked patiently.
Harry tried to crane his head over the crowd as Hermione continued to pull him.
The worry faded slightly from Hermione, replaced with a disapproving frown.  Ron just grinned, albeit a bit weakly.  He grinned back, turning his back on them and leaving the Great Hall at the same moment a tawny owl dropped the latest Daily Prophet on Hermione’s lap.  He was already halfway down the hall when his bushy-haired friend managed to make a sound about the heading on the front page of the Prophet.
,’ he thought, inwardly smiling slightly.  ‘
“What do you mean, Verna?” he asked silky and Jordan shivered.  He had almost forgotten about his cousin’s silky voice.  The last time he used that tone of voice had been when he had killed the assassin of the last Head of the European vampires.  He had been one of the unfortunate ones to be there when the Opacre group had caught the assassin.  He shivered again and felt his twin grasp his hand under the table reassuringly.  Jacob hadn’t been at the…execution…but he had heard enough from Jordan’s nightmares to get a vague idea of it.  Jordan gratefully squeezed his twin’s hand.
“I’m okay,” he said aloud, a calm look on his face and still faking a smile. “And I just left the Infirmary - ”
Remus exhaled shakily, rubbing his eyes.  “She said she was going to continue it tomorrow.  She wouldn’t – I mean, it’s not done yet.”
Harry froze, staring at Madam Pomfrey, as the words meaning hit him.  “But…but it was a different color then it was supposed to be,” he said, shocked.  “It had to be wrong.”
His hand stilled on top of the drawer next to his bed as he heard the voice in his head.  Sighing quietly, he grabbed his glasses and shoved them on.  ‘
“What in Hélène’s name are you doing sitting in the dark?” she muttered as she stood next to him, peering at him in the dim light.  “Thank you for waiting for me by the way, I didn’t need your help cleaning up at all, it’s not like - ”
Cool emerald eyes clashed with interested cobalt eyes, Lest raising an eyebrow as Harry gave him a steady look.
“I’m not the only one who thinks Ron’s being weirdly civil though, right?” he asked finally.
“Leon Hastai,” he said quietly, his bull voice rumbling softly.  “Representative of the Hastai family of vampires from Europe, which is the head of the middle-caste class.  Head of the Hastai family of vampires, along with my wife Margaret who could not attend because of her fever.”  He sent an apologetic look to the Head of the Opacres but Jordan’s cousin just waved his hand, indifferent.  “Loyal to the Opacre family of vampires and on the side of the Opacres,” he finished and sat down.
A familiar burst of bright light flashed up and the vampire hissed as her blade hit the sunlight shield, wincing and rocking back as Neville pulled the teacher back, fumbling to conjure more vines.
:: Harry said slowly.  Hadn’t Snape mentioned something about memories and the subconscious?  ::
:: Qye laughed.  Harry shook his head, still baffled by the younger boy’s bright mood.
“Harry…Potter?” she asked softly, raising her eyes again to the boy.  The green eyes narrowed slightly, looking a bit more wary, and she noticed that Hermione Granger and a red-haired boy she did not have name for lean a bit protectively towards him.  She raised an eyebrow but said nothing.  She merely continued to look at Harry for a bit longer.  The boy just met her eyes evenly, still calm and serene and wary and there was that surge again.  She tapped her finger on her podium a few times then shook her head and returned her attention to the roll sheet.  Murmurs began to rise in the classroom but she quickly killed them when she resumed taking attendance.
“I said I don’t care,” Harry said, his voice darkening as he slowly started to walk past them, still holding Draco’s wand with his other hand.  “Nothing gave you the right to do that.”  He saw Lest’s eyes darken.  “Try anything like that again and truce or not, leader of vampires or not, nothing will help you by the time I’m done with you.  Clear?”
-------
“Easier than it could’ve been,” Harry said carefully, looking away from the blond and back at the Shrieking Shack.  “If you recall, the last time you talked about this I left you oozing on the train.”
The horror behind his shock sprung forward and his fumbling hands dropped his cloak.
.:: He felt Qye roll his eyes.
Turning around, he looked down the shadowed hallway.  Slowly, his feet walked down the corridor as if having a mind of their own.  They led him down the hallway, slowly and hesitantly.  Then they stopped.
“Of all the people, Draco…” Snape muttered and blond shrugged. Snape sighed and turned away, briskly walking out of the Infirmary. “Well, come on. It’s almost curfew and I have to go mutilate some brilliant pieces of work by some first-year Hufflepuffs.”
-----
when Qye had said it had been five years.
“How unfortunate for you,” Harry muttered, picking up his quill from where he dropped it.  Turning his eyes back to the amused ones of the Slytherin, he frowned.  “Why did you do that anyway?”
“Maybe I’m just tired of waiting,” Qye snapped, stalking back to his bed and dropping down on it.  “Maybe I just want to prove - ”
Harry’s eyes narrowed thoughtfully as Professor Opacre set about mussing his hair with liquid from the bottle.
Harry was quiet, then demanded incredulously
“Letters?” he said, turning his eyes away from the gifts and blinking up at her.  Her smile faded.
Harry had turned his face to the floor while the Headmaster spoke and the numbness had grown.  ‘
A flash of puzzlement flew through the diamond-sapphire eyes and Harry glanced towards their hands.  The blue eyes followed his and surprise and faint embarrassment filled them as they caught sight of the entwined hands.
Hermione also came up and tried to make Harry talk but Ron had shaken his head at her.  Harry was grateful that Ron had figured out that he didn’t want to talk about it but Hermione hadn’t looked too pleased as she closed her mouth.  She didn’t stop her mothering though, even though she couldn’t make him talk.  His bushy-haired friend forced him to go to dinner despite his lack of appetite.
Sirius looked back at the teenagers, ignoring Dumbledore as he nodded at Wainscott and made his way out, reluctant as they took faltering steps to the door.
“Really? I suppose I better change my breakfast meal then, cereal and toast seem to only hold the secrets of the galaxy.”
In his head ran a myriad of thoughts, the looks of the students and staff, the judging press in the papers, the strangers delving into another part of his life that in another person wouldn’t matter at all.  The expectations of who he was and who he should be with and exactly who Draco Malfoy was and the disappointment and -
Dazain was staring straight at him.

The twelfth book had it.
putting in the shredded leaves of ivy!  Put it before and your entire potion will blow up, probably taking your hand along with it!  Were you even reading the instructions?!"
:: Qye replied warily.  ::
In his hand, the Daily Prophet hung loosely with its wild speculations about the end of the term attack still on its front page, right next to the continued silence from the Ministry about the whereabouts of the Boy Who Lived.  The Prophet had run a piece earlier in the week, when one of their reporters – thankfully not Rita Skeeter, as Hermione held her warning high over the unregistered Animagus – had gone to the orphanage the Ministry had designated and did not find him for their questions.  There were questions and whispers as to why Harry Potter never made it and where was he now that You Know Who and his vampires were a threat to their world.  There had been rumors that he had engaged the Dark Lord during the attack but there was no word from Dumbledore or any of the other staff, who instead commented about how the Hogwarts defenses held during the assault and how the alliance represented with the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher had come to their aide.
Something was going on with Harry.
“What was that all about?” Ron’s voice asked behind Harry, making him whirl around to see his best friend frowning after the back of the Slytherin.
------
Professor Opacre tilted her head. "No."
Marylin squeezed her nails into the palms of her hand, breathing shallowly as Lest turned so still next to her.
Lest growled out something in a different language and Professor Opacre rolled her eyes, clearly unimpressed as she went around organizing her things and flicking through attendance.
A heartbeat passed.
Harry batted him away, rolling his eyes as he climbed out of the bed.  “I’m not invalid, knock it off.”
,’ he thought, whimpering and curling into himself, curling into a ball, wanting to block everything out, wanting to push everything away, protect himself, get away, get away…
“As pathetic as a supposedly strong wizard afraid of an infant?” Harry suddenly said in a vicious voice.
“I told him you don’t matter,” Harry whispered, voice carrying through the tense air.  “And you don’t.  Not anymore.  Nothing you say or do is ever going to matter to us again.”
Qye opened his eyes and narrowed them. The name was ringing a strong warning bell in his mind but he didn’t know why. It had something to do with the Opacres though. He frowned.
Hermione didn’t say anything but softly put her hand on his shoulder.
Hermione and Ron wasted no time, their exhausted bodies cornering Harry.  It was a testament to how worried Hermione was that she didn’t even talk about how she did or whether she should’ve studied something more but rather focused her eyes immediately on Harry as soon as they all met up after their Charms practical.
against us.”
Snape’s mouth twisted.  “Potter continues to have the worst luck at the end of the school year.”
“Ms. Nilsson is offering support with the things the Healer cannot understand,” Marylin broke in, trying so hard to broker peace and Sirius wanted none of it.
“Fine!” Saira shouted, throwing her hands up in the air.  “Let’s join these damn wizards already.  But the minute they start to want to tag us and treat us like servants, I’ll be among the first to say ‘I told you so’ and fight for myself.”
That was also interpreted as no.) Did he remember falling on top of Lest and arguing with him on the way back to the castle? Merlin, no and he was

“Yes, Professor Opacre?” Padma asked curiously.  Marylin grinned at them, a little sparkle fluttering around inside her.
“I’m sure everything will be okay. I mean, Professor Opacre is always nice.
“Clearly,” the stout woman said shortly, lifting her wand.  “Despite all your attempts, all of Hogwarts’ students are still alive and protected.  While there is breath left in us, we will fight for them.”
Draco took that final step closer and Harry inhaled sharply as he felt the other teenager place a careful hand on his hip, his warm fingers on the edge of his shirt, almost touching his skin.  His heart beat rapidly and he tilted his head back slightly to look into Draco’s steady gaze.  He couldn’t help but lick his lips lightly, watching as Draco’s eyes flickered down momentarily before focusing on his eyes.
Lest emotionlessly repeated, “Date?”
“Sunlight shield, asshole,” Draco said hoarsely, as he unevenly climbed to his feet.  He raised his wand again, meeting Lest’s glare with his own sneer.  “Let’s see how - ”
“Indeed. Which is quite surprising, given the state you were brought in.” Qye shrugged, turning his eyes to his plate.
:: the soft voice persisted but the black-haired boy merely made a sound of protest, burrowing deeper into the warm bed.
:: he replied, surprised.  The ache was beginning to fade away in his eyes and he tentatively opened them further, blinking slightly to ease the pressure in them.  Everything was still blurred and it felt odd looking at things but the unpleasant feeling was beginning to go away.
Lest stepped forward but stopped as the vampire squeezed Harry’s throat, smirking as he looked at Dazain who attentively watched, eyes flicking occasionally to Lest.  Lest froze and bared his teeth, trembling with restrained wrath.
:: the voice said dryly.  ::
“Because you need to learn to shut up,” he muttered back, ignoring the scowl his twin sent him.  Instead, he leaned forward and looked at his cousin who was looking at Marylin.  “Cousin?”  They both turned to look at him, expressions extremely neutral.  He met their blank expressions evenly and asked quietly, “What are we going to do?”
“Will you stop staring at me?” mumbled Harry later at lunch. “I’m not going to keel over, you know.”
Qye offered, taking a brief moment to peer through his eyes.
Harry said silently, grateful for the smart witch’s idea to startle the two groups before a row could start.
The last thing he saw before his fever claimed him was Draco Malfoy’s soft, silver eyes looking concernedly into his own and his last thought was wishing he could comfort him in his warm arms.
,’ he wondered as he laid his folded arms on his knees, carefully balanced on his heels and evenly meeting the teenager’s assessing eyes.
-------
The unnamed person stepped in through the doorway and silently closed the door behind them.  Vernon staggered to his feet, fear beginning to rise in him.  He could hear his son whimpering behind him and felt Petunia grasp at his arm fearfully.
Harry jolted before bowing his face towards her, shaking.
Harry looked up from his treacle tart.  Her hair was messier than usual, a stray strand cutting across her tired face but her eyes unwavering.  She met his gaze evenly and when he glanced over at Ron, he found that same level stare looking back at him.
“Harry,” she said gently, “I know you said you needed time to think things through.  That you were still figuring things out.  But you have to know that Ron and I would never cast you aside, not for anything.”
“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, looking disbelieving at him.  “Don’t tell me you believe him?”  Ron looked at her indignantly and Harry smiled faintly
“Oh, don’t be so melodramatic,” Hermione snapped.  Ron glared at her
Most of the common room was empty except for a couple of first years drooping at one of the tables, most likely trying to get a head start for the impending exams.  The rest of Gryffindor was undoubtedly either sleeping off the night before or out for a late breakfast.
:: Qye flatly said as Harry went into another coughing fit.
------
Snape called roll quickly and as soon as he was done, he smiled maliciously and drew out another piece of parchment.  Harry immediately got a sinking feeling in his stomach.
“How do you think it’s going?” Marylin murmured as she looked down at her long since grown cold tea.
People gasped, some crying out and others leaning as far away as they could from the Head Table as possible.  Across him, Harry heard Ron curse “Bloody hell!” and Neville squeaked while Hermione just stared wide-eyed.  Harry just looked on quietly, mistrust in the new DADA teacher already growing.
In the Infirmary, the figure of Harry Potter lay on the bed, silent all night. The few times the nurse checked on him, he lay motionless. But when she was not there, his body trembled and his eyes flickered rapidly under his eyelids. By the time the sun began to gently rouse its head, the black-haired teenager lay completely still. The eyes fluttered as the first beam of sunlight crept into the room.
“You’re going to talk to us alone?” Harry asked warily before Qye could say anything.  Qye tensed.
Qye whispered as Harry picked up his bag.
Harry let out a short breath and gave her a hesitant smile as he followed her lead.  “Thanks, I appreciate it.”  He ducked his head and awkwardly rubbed the back of his neck.  “I know it’s a strange request - ”
“What the hell are you talking about?” he bellowed, glaring at the hooded man thought backing away slightly.  “What warning?!  Who
“I’m sure the Minister is getting right on that,” Harry said, rolling his eyes.  He grinned as Hermione dug her elbow into Ron’s side, making him let out a soft ‘
Vernon scowled at the figure on his doorway, irritated by the interruption.  “Who the hell are you and what the hell do you want?” he snapped, already beginning to close the door.
’  She sighed and closed her eyes.
Harry flinched.
Sirius took a step closer to Snape, his worry overwhelming his anger.  “Snape, what the hell - ”
are but - ”
“I thought that was Mind-Healer’s job,” Qye exhaled, closing his eyes and gripping the comforter beneath his hands as he slowly started to count back from ten.  Once he finished, he opened his eyes to see Smethwyck pocketing his wand and pulling out his notebook, writing down his notes while Harry curled on his side, draping his arm over his face.  Qye watched his fingers curl in his hair, his own fingers slowly letting going of the comforter.  “You know, the Mind-Healer you said would evaluate us and hasn’t shown up yet.”
Harry took a breath.  “Now what?”
“Oh, ha ha,” Seamus snorted sarcastically. “What do you know, Malfoy? Then again, Slytherins know a lot about sucking, don’t you?”
Qye felt his eyes widening as his anger was interrupted by memories of a kind smile and honey sweet fruit.
The leg hovered and Harry could hear the buzz of his classmates increase but it was all in a second because like Professor Opacre said, things had to happen fast, duels happened fast, like a flash of green light and lost lives. The leg shot towards the vampire's head and Harry had a flash of a club knocking out a troll and it felt fitting to end this with a move Ron had used. It only took a second, the leg levitating up and shooting towards Lest's head with a flick of Harry's wand -
He breathed.
Jordan’s cousin nodded.  “Very well, I’ll send the reply tonight.  If the Dazains do join Voldemort, we’ll be there to meet them with our own surprise.”  He stood up and Leon suddenly spoke up.
’  After Seamus and Blaise’s questions, along with her joking manner, the class had relaxed and began firing questions at her rapidly.  One of the students that had asked the most questions had been Hermione Granger and Marylin mentally made a note of her since she was quite above average and well…the questions she asked simply couldn’t be answered.
“I wanted to ask you a question, Qye,” he said slowly, looking back and forth between them in growing confusion.  The heavy pit in his stomach grew with the awful question frozen behind his lips.  “I just - ”
“Like I said - ” Malfoy began.
She spritzed one more time before lowering the bottle and finally meeting his gaze.  He felt a twinge as he saw the trace of melancholy in her blue eyes.
"Does that mean he outranks you?" Dean asked curiously, barely remembering to raise his hand halfway through his question. When Professor Opacre turned confused eyes towards him, he elaborated. "I mean, is a rose quartz stronger than a tiger eye?"
:: Qye nodded, still looking through Harry’s eyes.  ::
In the back of his mind, untouched by the fever, he found comfort beyond that of the cooling charm as he rested with the other, two nestled perfectly together, wordless. A soft, gentle touch from a sleeping source, exhausted like him. Sharing sleep. Pain. Comfort.
“Prat,” Qye mumbled and Sirius’ heart ached, taken back to similar times he had with James.
He wasn’t conscious of rolling over, breathing heavily as he stumbled in the blankets that lay atop him, tangled in his legs as he fell out of the bed, knees banging on the carpet, arm outstretched, his hand reaching and –
“I didn’t realize you and Malfoy were on such terms,” Lest said, tilting his head as his jaw clenched slightly.
::  The person went silent suddenly and he grew slightly worried at the pause.  Before he could say anything though, the voice continued.
Ron tapped the wood a few more times before taking a deep breath and exhaling.  “Probably.  He stayed after on Friday to ask her something.”
Then he sighed and put down his quill, already knowing Hermione’s fretful face before he looked up.  “I don’t know else we can do, ‘Mione.  You gave him that thought sorter idea and he hasn’t said anything else about it.”  He shrugged and leaned back, folding his arms.  “Short of dousing him with Veritaserum and sitting on him, what are we going to do?  And don’t think I haven’t thought of it.”
“Hello, Professor,” they chorused together and she grinned, her fangs showing for a moment.
Next chapter: "Truth Revealed” – Now what?
Qye said nothing more but he could feel the other’s puzzlement.
He felt the other one roll their eyes, obviously unaware of his shock and horror.  In a slightly irritated voice, they repeated, ::
reaching for an ingredient.
Thank you.
Harry seemed to be in a state of stasis, almost coma-like. Qye winced as he found Harry to still have a high fever, radiating exhaustion that only an extremely ill person had. Calling his name repeatedly seemed to have no effect and Qye sighed, crossing his legs and propping his elbows on his knees, resting his head on his hands.
“Do you agree, Saira?” his cousin asked quietly, voice cold as winter.  Saira sighed and nodded grudgingly.  It was quiet once more and then an absent voice called from next to the fire.
“You haven’t answered my question, Malfoy,” Harry mumbled as he stared at the bubbling liquid, which was slowly turning green.  “Why do you care if I’m angry at you or not?”
Lest took a step forward, his face closed off.  “Nilsson stays, Smethwyck.  She -”
’ he thought bitterly, looking at the moving picture of the ruined wizarding mall.  ‘
'," Harry said automatically because it was just like last year, wasn't it, being pelted with objects by Ron and Hermione in training for the Maze. He didn't even think about it, green eyes glancing only momentarily as the trinkets hit his invisible shield and rebounded, because it was instinct and there were a million other things that were instinct too.
“Wait,” the black-haired man whispered and he saw Harry shift his head, green eyes glancing at him before looking away.  “Wait, I - ”
“Thank you, Mother,” Harry muttered as he picked up his fork and began to push around his food. She didn’t smile as she poured them pumpkin juice. He glared at the calmly eating Ron. “Thanks for the support.” Ron shrugged.
“Hi hi?”
Harry narrowed his eyes slightly, still keeping his eyes on his potion. ::
he heard Qye mutter just as he watched the man crash into the ground, sprawled and still.
“More of a claim than you,” Lest replied smoothly and Sirius narrowed his eyes.  Lest turned his gaze to his sister who sighed and met Sirius’ eyes reluctantly.
Ron blinked and looked up to see Harry standing by the door, his Firebolt slung over his shoulder and his eyebrow raised.
:: it hissed.
Qye dropped his eyes and turned away. “I’ll go back,” he said quietly, his eyes gazing at the lake. “But after dinner, alright? Kind of want to enjoy my freedom while I can.” He glanced back, a lopsided grin on his face.
Qye asked.
, and ricocheted into the vampire’s face, a loud thud as the woman crumpled to the floor.
Harry trembled, feeling everyone’s gazes on him as he stood close to Draco – he dimly realized he was calling him Draco now – his hands on the Slytherin’s and his back to the frosty vampire.
“I wasn’t asking about your future plans,” said Wainscott as he pulled one of the books out and flipped it over to read the back.  “But you do bring up an interesting point.  How old are you?”
He ignored it as they walked through the castle doors.  As they rounded a hallway, he saw Sirius waiting for them and Remus recognized the pale blond hair just further down the corridor.
The vampire woman opened her mouth, closed it, sighed and hung her head.  “Them,” she repeated morosely, her blue eyes looking forwards apprehensively.  Remus was suddenly struck by how young she looked.
," he said calmly and he saw Lest's eyes narrow. No one must have used this spell, a first-year spell quickly learned and forgotten, so innocent. He couldn't see what Harry was thinking so he couldn't know what the spell did, as the broken off leg from the desk Harry had blasted hovered up.
The scene began to fade, began to be replaced with the picture of glided tables and sparkling chandeliers once more, the complete opposite of the place he had just been. He saw people standing, frantic, over him and found the scream coming from his own mouth begin to raise in volume once more.
“Get the boy,” Dazain said, his voice ringing through the clearing.
Smethwyck snorted and Qye exchanged a quick annoyed look with Harry as the Healer guided them up and ushered them to the door.
“Remember to thank Mr. Malfoy next time you see him, Mr. Potter,” she said, her lips twitching slightly.  He stared at her and she coughed, raising a hand to her mouth.  “He was the one who carried you up here after you fainted and he visited you at least twice while you were unconscious.  I think the least you can do is thank him.”
“Mr. Potter,” she began, looking slightly hesitant, “You’ve been unconscious for almost a week.  Mr. Weasley and Ms. Granger have already left for the holidays.  They came and visited you while they were still here but they had to leave.”  Her kind blue eyes looked down in sympathetic sadness at him and he drew his eyes away from her, unwilling to see any form of pity.
He sighed as he watched her open and firmly close the door behind her, briefly catching sight of the guard that was always present, this time the quiet young man with a short spear strapped to his back.
“You would be you.”
He didn’t say anything for a moment and Harry felt frustration flare in the other boy.  ::
“No vampires,” Harry rasped, looking around Qye’s shoulder.  She stopped at the expression on his clammy face, the brittle yet resolute look in his eyes.  Qye felt an odd tingle run across his skin, goosebumps rising up as something charged the air around them, and he kept his warning glare on the vampire even as he saw the other adults stiffen as if sensing something else.
Marylin blinked.  “What?”
The fifth made mentions of it but no more than the supplemental text.  Harry put it aside as a possible source for later if they found nothing else.
He blinked as he watched Hermione glance up and down the street, scattered with a few mingling Hogwarts students and Hogsmeade residents before dragging him a little further down to one of the gardens closer to Gladrags.  He furrowed his brow as he watched her pull out her wand and wave it with a quick privacy spell before whirling around on him.
Harry wordlessly shook his head, dropping Draco’s hand and moving away from the Slytherin.  He dropped down into the chair, avoiding the eyes of everyone, feeling the feeling of being isolated once again.
“I think we’re just concerned in general,” Remus responded cautiously as Sirius tried to take in as much detail as possible, his eyes trailing over the way the pajamas hung loosely on them, the pinched corners at Qye’s mouth and shadowed bags under Harry’s eyes.  “You have to know we care.”
Harry said wearily.
volunteering to fight
Qye said, voice firming.
“Anyway,” Hermione said, her voice higher than usual taking Harry from his thoughts and focusing back on her to see a full out blush covering her face, “Malfoy must have meant that…well, not yet, I don’t have anyone to go with.”
’ He bit his lip and unconsciously clenched his hand around the soft blanket. ‘
,’ he thought to himself as he caught up to Ron who was snapping at Fred and George.
“Fuck normal,” he quietly echoed as dusk slowly settled outside.
Harry hissed.
“You know,” Ron interrupted suddenly, causing the two women to look at him but unable to draw the attention of the silent male. “Maybe he’s right. About Harry leaving before we got here. We should go, really. I mean, he’s sick and all and Pomfrey’s ready to blow a gasket and Mum will have my head if I didn’t make him take care of himself and we really should be going and – ”
-----
The letter was the first from her brother since the winter break.
like that.”
Lest whispered as he stared darkly out the window, seemingly more to himself than to her, "I'd rather have him hate me than love him."
:: He stopped.  Qye had obviously lived there before him and since he had just said he was ten and was shocked by finding out that he was living there now…was this boy a ghost?
Ron winced as its teeth tore through his clothes, scratching his skin and sending it into a further frenzy as it touched his blood.  He gasped and kicked and blocked with one arm, fingers scrabbling for his knocked aside wand.  He heard Sinistra shouting spells and saw more beasts come down the corridor.
Sighing, he ran a hand through his hair as he walked over to the loose floorboard.  Kneeling down, he lifted it up and looked down into it.  Like he had guessed, he didn’t leave anything behind.  Frowning, he replaced the floorboard.  Why had he come back if he hadn’t left anything?  Letting out a frustrated breath, he turned and quickly left the room without a backwards glance.
Harry looked back at him, studying green eyes like his, the stubbornness that matched his own will, looked into those eyes and saw that for all his certainty and determination, even with all his knowledge and experience beyond his years –
came Qye’s sleepy thought. :
Qye suddenly broke in, voice heavily laced with irritation. Before Harry could ask, the duel, quite suddenly, finished.
“With my own magical signature,” Wainscott confirmed, holding onto her notebook.  “Anything else has been redacted so that it can only be inferred by the presently assigned team.”
She took a deep breath and forced herself to relax.  ‘
It was only the next day that Marylin realized that her brother had erased Qye’s face from her mind.
,’ Qye thought desperately, angrily, pushing harder, trying to look past the regret and agony in Lest’s fucking stupid blue eyes, his hands shaking and gripping the handmade stake tighter.  ‘
“I don’t get it…is he wearing his Cloak?” he muttered to himself. Marylin tilted her head.
She flicked her wand, a copy of the report and its recommendation neatly conjured in front of each of the adults in the room.
“Are you picking something up?” Smethwyck asked carefully, meeting his eyes with a hint of curiosity.  Qye’s mouth twisted slightly.
,’ she said, smiling slightly as she looked at her chatting with her two friends, Ron and Harry.  Her smile faded and she looked thoughtfully at the green-eyed boy who was smiling slightly at his friend’s enthusiastic attitude.
Jordan mentally groaned and fervently prayed that Mom and Dad wouldn’t find out about this while hoping that Jacob would keep his fat mouth shut.
He turned his head slightly to watch her walk quickly over to a trunk.  He saw her lift a hand and quickly brush at her face before she looked through it.
"Yes, but you missed the point," Professor Opacre stated easily. "One was aimed to confuse the mind and the other to essentially shut it down. Now, from what you've learned this year, I would've thought you would've already known vampires have great strength with their minds." She raised an eyebrow. "Telekinesis, telepathy, ring any bells?"
He struggled against the pressure, thinking the man had pinned them against the wall with a bar or something.  Then he stilled, his eyes widening and terror completely replacing his anger.
:: the voice said sardonically.  Qye was silent then said quietly, ::
But he had gotten over that quickly.  Partly because he had never been close to his relatives so he could not find any reason to keep mourning their tragic fates for so long.  Partly because of the worry he saw in Ron and Hermione, seeing them looking at him sadly and uncertainly.  As much as he was regretful of his relatives' deaths and Dudley's commitment, they were not as important as his friends, the people he considered his surrogate family.  He made himself get over his downcast mood quickly, unwilling to make them worry more than they already did.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up.
He blinked slowly, eyelids heavy and crusted and still so, so tired.
But now…after learning the things she did this break…she still liked Harry.
“You and Qye,” Sirius said determinedly, nodding, clearly not altogether comfortable but trying.
’ he thought a little defensively, twirling his quill in his hand.  ‘
The students who realized screaming and trying to run off was
“Yes, Ms. Granger?” she smiled, meeting the girl’s eyes.
Lucky.  Right.
:: Qye muttered.  ::
“Dean, help me,” Seamus stage-whispered.  “I have a midget after me.”  Harry glared at him before turning his attention back to his friends, idly wondering if he should break them up now.  Sometimes they tended to get very heated in their verbal spars and while he doubted they would hex each other, he didn’t want them shouting and bringing McGonagall or Snape to them and costing Gryffindor House some points before the school year began.
“Thank you,” he mumbled.
"The potion we're brewing today won't be as strong as those prescribed, seeing as most of you aren't ready to deal with your minds," Snape continued, smirking at the Gryffindors in the class and making the Slytherins smirk as well.  "The most the potion will allow you to do is skim the top of your subconscious and search through some memories you might have forgotten.
It pulsed bright, enveloped him in light so bright the vampires hissed and automatically stumbled back.
“Hermione,” he said through gritted teeth, counting backwards from ten mentally, “you’ve said that during the entire trip.  And I’ve repeatedly told you that I’m fine.  Now will you
The bell rang throughout the household of Number Four, Privet Drive.  Vernon Dursley scowled, looking away from the television next to wife.  His son, Dudley Dursley just continued to slurp on his ice cream while his piggy eyes were trained on the television show, home for the weekend after plowing down one of his classmates.
The former professor stiffened, reigning in a sigh as he recognized the voice, and turned to look at Olivia Perkins, the resident of Hogsmeade notorious for her grumbles of the Hogwarts trips, rising prices of local shops since 1968 and her snide “good riddance” attitude when he was outed as a werewolf.
“Harry,” Lest began and stopped again as red sparks emitted threateningly from Harry’s wand, his grasp tightening.
:: Qye chuckled.  The amusement from the younger boy faded quickly and in a slightly anxious voice, he said, ::
There was power, a strange sense of power, and it staggered her, notably pushed back Lest as he tried to get to Qye.
Qye mumbled and Harry's eyes widened.
Qye hissed in Harry’s mind as the air cleared and Harry narrowly stared at the male vampire in front of him, blocking him from the other who was now fending off three other vampires, kicks and punches and one armed with what looked a chain.
“No,” Black cut back, back straight and certainty solidifying in his eyes, staring down the face of the vampire’s anger. “I’m listening to them.  Maybe you should give it a try.”
“Why does she always pat me?” Harry said, trying to push away his blush.  Ron snickered.
“Lest!” she yelped and he raised a pale eyebrow at her.
::  He heard the voice take a breath – they were in his
He was about to ask who Lest was when he connected it.  Lest was Professor Opacre’s brother.  Qye knew Lest wasn’t trouble.  Therefore, Qye had to know Lest personally. The thought of sleep fled from his mind and he slowly opened his eyes.
Trying to corner Ron with explanations for the sudden change had been alarmingly difficult, with preparation for O.W.L.s and Quidditch and Ron somehow managing to change the topic every time Harry tried to bring up.  Trying to get Hermione into digging into Ron wasn’t an option, not with the way she eyed him like she still wanted to know his secrets and – getting closer to April – he still didn’t have any idea of what to do with Qye.  Flat out asking her about the change wasn’t useful either.
:: Harry finally shouted, green eyes burning. Qye's shock faltered the anger Harry had been receiving from him and he continued, angry and hurt and finally speaking his real problem with Qye's actions, more than the simple physical assumption of his body.
He closed his eyes as the other teenager bent his head slightly and brushed a kiss against his cheek.
In the next moment, he felt Harry abruptly go limp, his arms slipping free from Qye’s shoulders as he started to slide to the floor.
,’ Qye thought immediately, grimacing.
He trembled.  His only family was gone…
The room chilled.
He stopped as she sharply looked up, her gray eyes harsh and piercing.
“Oh come on,” Hermione snapped.  “Do you really think Dumbledore would hire someone who isn’t trustworthy?”
“Please come to the dance with me.”
donated to assist my type of vampire.  I assure all of you, I will
Opening his eyes slowly, Qye blinked as he found himself staring at what appeared to be a smooth pale expanse of skin. ‘
Ron snickered as he followed Harry out of the Gryffindor Tower and to the pitch.  On the inside, he was thinking.  ‘
“No,” Lest bit out and Marylin sighed as he pushed past her, moving quickly through the crowd and out the door before the girls could say anything.
“They tore him apart,” he whispered, his body trembling. “They just…Voldemort said something to someone…to not spoil them and to control them I think…the other person…”
“I just don’t see why we couldn’t have taken them to St. Mungo’s,” Fudge mumbled as he jammed the bowler hat back on his head.  “All this damn secrecy and…and this!  Once word gets out of what’s happened - ”
Harry started as Draco reached for one of his arms.  He started slightly as the blond slowly began to rub his hand up and down it, gently heating it.
Harry said carefully.
“Fucking right it won’t be,” Sirius rasped, finally reaching the end of his tether, wand or not.  He watched Lest slowly rise, the blue in his eyes darkening to almost black.   “You’re not getting anywhere near him again.”
Harry gritted his teeth as a flush started to work its way up his neck.  Trying to control it, Harry lifted his chin challengingly and raised an eyebrow at the blonde.  “To what?”
“What do you want, Qye?” she asked again softly.
“Am I supposed to answer you with my life goals or something?” he asked back, boredom carefully threaded in his voice as he walked past the bookshelves, eyeing them and wondering if he could pass the time just reading instead of answering.  “I’m just a kid, what do I know what I want to do with my life?”
"I'll do it."
And he flung the leg towards Harry.
Out of sight, Qye exuded a large amount of shock and hilarity.
Sirius was on some top-secret mission for Dumbledore - as usual - and any chance of getting a moment with him for the holidays was impossible.  So he was to be alone for the holidays.   Despite the fact that he knew he would be lonely, he saw this as a wonderful chance to read some more about this strange new character.  As he picked at his food, he absently wondered where 'Qye' was now. . .
Harry paused in taking a step out the door, his brow furrowing.  “Isn’t that a bit early?”
Lest stilled.
He took a deep breath and tried to calm himself. This vampire seemed to be a never-ending source of problems for him since the moment they'd met and his desire to see him bested grew more.
"I was talking about you falling from your high horse," his voice smirked and Harry inwardly sighed as the vampire's eyes widened and then grew considering, lips twitching in obvious amusement.
:: Harry mumbled.  ::
for her liking.  Immediately, the bushy-haired Gryffindor turned her annoyed attention on the redhead, who shot a grin to Harry.  Harry grinned back, silently expressing his gratitude.
He heard the sounds of fighting echoing through the grounds as the vampire stared at him and Harry caught his breath, brows furrowing when the vampire did nothing more.  He vaguely heard Qye mumbling something softly, repeatedly, as he straightened and looked uncertainly at the growing frown on the vampire’s face.
The vampire sighed as Remus carefully chose to say nothing and followed after his friend.  “No, I suppose not.”
Hermione looked over at him and her irritation was quickly replaced by sympathy as well.  “I’m sorry about that, Harry,” she said compassionately.  “Stuck with Malfoy for the entire year…I just hope he doesn’t ruin your learning too much.”
Hermione waved Ron away and frowned up at Harry, crossing her arms. “Look, if you’re going to make a joke about your health and well-being…”
It was true that the past DADA teachers hadn’t been the most honest of people.  All of them, in one way or another, had lied about themselves and had only been able to teach for a year.  There were rumors that the job was cursed and Harry dimly wondered if this new teacher would last the year.  The silence returned, just as uncomfortable, and lasted to the end of the feast.
so advanced and wired differently to work on these abilities, it'll be harder for such spells to effectively penetrate and work properly. Therefore, I'd advise against using such spells."
“I think we’re good,” he smiled slightly.
“Because he wants to see how I’ve been doing my work and he would like to learn more about wizards,” the vampire said evenly.  Her eyes narrowed slightly.  “While we’re on the matter of my brother, I feel compelled to tell you how you two should behave while he’s here.  I’ll be having a few words with him as well, as soon as he arrives,” she added, seeing Malfoy open his mouth angrily.  The blond closed it, his mouth tightening.
"Harry - " she began, still not reassured.  Fortunately, Ron cut in before she could question him more.
he chastised himself. ‘
Qye asked, frowning.
’ Harry thought incredulously as he watched her load up his plate with more food.  “Thank you, Mum,” he said sweetly.  Hermione just sniffed and took out a book.  He looked pleadingly at Ron but the redhead just smirked.
Marylin was brought back from her own thoughts by Lest’s quiet voice. Looking up, she saw him looking straight ahead, his cool face revealing nothing. Marylin nodded, lowering her eyes once more.
As her eyebrows rose, he hastily continued as he withdrew his hand, “I mean, not with
The figure’s arm shot out before the door could close anymore and, without an outward display of strength, pushed back at it.  Vernon shouted as the door flung open all the way, crashing against the wall.  The force against the door had sent him sprawling down the hallway and he could hear the cries of his family as they rushed out of the living room and into the hallway.
:: Harry thought, trying to think up an excuse for not reading
“Like she’ll let me go after one day,” Qye muttered under his breath.
close.
There was another blow coming, he felt it building up slowly, and his heart thudded fearfully as he felt that it would be the last, that it would shatter him, that it would take him away…
Chuckling quietly, Malfoy dropped his knee and moved closer.  “Yeah, it’s the last thing and then we can leave.”  He pushed forward another scrap of parchment.  “I’ve outlined what should be in your conclusion.  All you have to do is find the words for everything I’ve written.”
“Ron,” Hermione reprimanded but still looking at Harry with her narrowed, concerned eyes. “Harry, maybe you should just go to the Infirmary right now. I can pick up your assignments for the rest of your classes while you go and rest.”
“There was a family,” Draco said distantly, a far away look in his eyes.  “My parents had gone to school with the father, knew him as one of those who could’ve been in Slytherin if he just wanted a bit more.  They had a young girl, three or four.”  He swallowed.  “I heard my father talking with the Dark Lord.  The Dazains had gone at them.  A test, they said.  What remained…they couldn’t even determine who was who.  He ordered it covered up, to keep it quiet so that the others wouldn’t falter with the alliance with the Dazains.”
“Harry?”  Now Ron entered, raising an eyebrow at him when he kept silent, not touching the food.  His forehead furrowed and worry slightly entered his eyes.  “Mate, you okay?”
The vampire continued to look at him for a moment, face emotionless and eyes churning.  Then, without a word, he turned swiftly away and swept out of the classroom.
“Works for me,” Ron murmured and Professor Opacre grinned.  Hermione scowled lightly at the redhead while Harry merely smiled.
Lest Opacre whispered quietly, “I’m going to visit my in-laws.”
Finally,  “Zebie, Daniel!” became a Hufflepuff, and McGonagall took the Sorting Hat and stool away.  Dumbledore once again stood up, beaming at them.
and… I can’t even tell you what I was thinking when I told you to say yes.  All I can say is that when I saw that notice, I wanted you there with me.  So that I could be with you.  So.  Please come to the dance with me.”
“What do you mean?” Marylin frowned.  Lest raised an eyebrow.
“S…sorry?” she stammered, her brown eyes wide. Lest made a little noise in his throat.
,” Seamus chortled as he got his things for the shower.  The sandy-haired boy winked coyly at a still-puzzled Harry.  “Next time, keep it down or ask me for help, love.”  Snickering, Seamus left the room for the showers.
things.” He stared at her even more.
Lest’s face hardened.
“I already like the date I have!” Harry burst out, flinging his hands out as his panicked eyes watched the eyeliner move dangerously close.
“Shit,” he whispered, shaking as he uncurled his fist and wincing as he flexed it.  He hadn’t thought about it, reacted to the fangs immediately, but the battle had other vampires.
“Merlin, again!?”
The Gryffindors stayed silent in the corridor.  Ron was still fuming furiously but Hermione was murmuring calming words to him, slowly draining him of his anger.  The others moved around uncomfortably, some muttering darkly about the Slytherins. Harry continued to look down at the ground, feeling oddly calm though he knew he should have been feeling upset or embarrassed still.
The table rattled slightly.
“What is it?” Black asked, thrumming in place next to Lupin.
“Ah…Professor Opacre,” Hermione began, looking slightly uncertain, “When you tell us to ask us questions…do you mean as you questions about DADA this year?  Or questions about you being a…a…”
Lifting her head from the roll slowly, she met the eyes of the young black-haired boy.  She looked at him for a long moment, and then glanced back down at the roll sheet.
“What’s this all about?” Seamus wondered, as he propped himself on Dean’s shoulder and angled his head around to get a better view.
“Oh, you can’t trust Ron with these things, he generally always turns out wrong,” Hermione said cheerfully, still pulling at Marylin’s arm. “He’s so stubborn about every thing, he doesn’t take into consideration that Harry might have moved.”
.’  He dreamed of Mr. Diggory sobbing, Mrs. Diggory with tears in her eyes…Cho crying.
"Are you really this dull-witted?" Lest demanded.

“Don’t you mean eleven?”
“No idea why we teamed up with them in the first place,” growled another.
Harry?”  Sirius growled, standing up from his seat as Remus slowly stood as well, his frown darkening.  “What the hell is that suppose to mean?”
“It’s funny,” Malfoy hissed, “that you’re calling me that when everyone knows that you kissed your father’s ass more than anyone, including your mother.”
’ she thought, shocked to the core.  ‘
“Fine, just fine G – Hermione,” he caught himself. “Guess I just lost my temper.” He smiled weakly as she continued to stare at him, a slight suspicion in her eyes.
“You can fix this,” Lest interrupted, a cold and distant look emerging on his face and Qye shook, staring in incredulity and rising rage once more because of course,
Mentally sighing, he closed his eyes.
Then his eyes focused and he saw a tightness around those seemingly unaffected eyes.
“You’re half a person,” Lest said, his voice strained.  “She says you’re capable of critical thinking.  If you have any sense of rationality left, you know this is stupid.”
~~~~~~
:: he replied as he turned to look at Neville and Dean.  He blinked as he saw the both of them blushing furiously.  He raised an eyebrow and Neville blushed even more, hastily grabbing his own things for the shower and fleeing the room.  Blinking, he turned to Dean, utterly confused.
Marylin stared at her brother, chills running down her back from the smile and gleam.  ‘
Ron's eyes widened and he stumbled. In that second, a few lighter trinkets smacked against the side of his hand, causing it to reflexively loosen just as Lest gestured with his hand again.
"Well," she cleared her throat, forcing a smile on her face. "I suppose after that none of you wish to - "
pierced his robes, the force of it pushing him down as his Auror guards started yelling and then gurgling.
::They sighed then continued.  ::
Harry closed his eyes at the quiet answer.
“The Venators scoured the scene after the fact,” Draco growled.  “Traced the fire to an arsonist instead of the faulty wiring claimed in the report.  Interrogated the arsonist who told them she had been paid to cover the blood.  To hide the traces of another Opacre kill, in the name of winning a war.”
Harry took that as best as he could and broke his gaze to look at Draco, who stood watching him with his own icy expression.
:: Harry froze.  ::
“Do not assume a vampire cannot be dangerous without its fangs,” Verna murmured, examining her knitting.  Jordan saw his cousin’s cold blue eyes narrow.
::  A bit of hurt rose in him and he tried to bring it down.
Jonas watched the man slam his hands down on table and snarl at Opacre while Lupin seemed to have lost all words, his eyes glimmering strangely as he stared at the vampire.  He saw Opacre twist at the thing at his neck and his fingers twitch while his eyes flashed and his sister worriedly put her hand on him.  Finally, Jonas sighed and slipped away as Dumbledore’s voice turned sterner and grimmer with every vicious comment hurled, making his subtle retreat into the hallway.
:: he replied quietly, shuddering slightly.  ::
“He is,” Ron muttered. “But the moron escaped after lunch and now Pomfrey’s on the rampage.” He shook his head and said mournfully, “That boy has a lot to learn about women.”
“I will as soon as you say yes,” Draco answered smoothly.
There was a silence as he warily studied the Mind-Healer, reassessing his opinion that her connection with Smethwyck instead of her competence brought her to them.  He fought again the urge to reach out to Harry to get his opinion of her.
He sighed and opened his eyes half way, looking at the flames licking at the logs in the fireplace.  He guessed that was why they were worried.  When he talked, he hardly said anything about how he was feeling.  Hermione often asked him how he was and he always answered with a simple “Fine” before changing the subject.  Her annoyed and frustrated looks plagued him for the rest of the day.  He rolled his shoulders uncomfortably, remembering the hurt in her eyes when he brushed off the questions.
He wasn’t ten, he wasn’t fifteen going on sixteen, Merlin only knew what he was.  He knew so much and was capable of further still and Harry had no doubt that he’d adjust to living as the teenager he now was.  But he was still, in ways that mattered, very young.  And Harry felt a stirring in his heart, even as he nodded and broke their stare, looking out at the Black Lake while they waited for a decision.
Everyone else stood, staring and helpless.
Harry felt confusion for a moment. Then the relief that had begun fled as panic flared up as
“Just something Weasley and I talked about,” Malfoy answered, signaling for two butterbeers to a frazzled but obviously pleased with business Madam Rosmerta.  “Turns out we had some common ground.”
him was the way Lest drawled out mockingly helpful tips as each student's face showed how desperate they were trying not to think. Lest smirked at each student as they slumped away with their returned wands and Harry could feel his fingers twitch in annoyance each time, silently rooting for the following contestant, whether they'd be Gryffindor or Slytherin.
That didn’t matter much to him.  He would have been fine with everything if it were just those two.  But he was stuck with Malfoy,
:: Qye said dryly.
Sirius growled and half-rose to his feet before Remus sharply pulled him back down.  He shot his friend an angry look, angry on his behalf, angry at the vampire, angry that if he hadn’t been so reckless at the start he could have raised Harry and none of this would have happened in the first place.
Seamus plopped his hands down on their table, his eyes gleaming as Dean waved ruefully behind him.
“If you think,” Ron began, still stretched out on Harry’s bed as Harry came silently back from the showers the next morning, “that we’re going to let this go without an explanation, you’ve got another thing coming.”
Harry snapped and his anxiety slipped into his actions, turning his '
He didn’t notice Qye’s hidden relief. He also didn’t notice Ron’s narrowed blue eyes at Draco or Hermione’s thoughtful brown eyes on him.
Lest raised sleepy eyes to his sister.
From what he had read, he had concluded that 'Qye' was a boy when writing this, although an intelligent one at that.  He didn't know how old this 'Qye' was though.  There had been too much dust on the belongings to say that the books had just been placed there recently and too little to say they had been there for so long.  Maybe this 'Qye' had lived there before he had been born?  All of the things in the compartment most likely belonged to 'Qye' but he didn't understand how or why.  The books that wouldn't open. . .they were obviously magical.  Did that mean the boy was a wizard?  But Privet Drive was a Muggle neighborhood.  He didn't understand.
“Those were his years, not mine,” he muttered, pulling out another book.
’ he wondered, rubbing his eyes and groping for his glasses.  ‘
He said lowly in the small space between them, “Talk to me after the O.W.L.s.”
:: Harry began, feeling his annoyance begin to rise with the person.  Then it fell quickly, shock and fear overtaking it.
“What do you mean?” he asked confusedly, his uneasiness forgotten as he looked curiously into the blue eyes.  The ice in them faded slightly as a bit of amusement flashed through the sapphire eyes.
From the quiet of his mind, Qye - voice fiery - spoke.
Yeah, there’s going to be little downtime in this story.
:: Harry thought back, hugging his friend back before letting go.
“I think this is it!” she said excitedly, almost skipping over to him.  “This will most definitely work tonight!”
Libby shifted her eyes to Black, who stared at her, still clutching at his report.
“Harry?” a quiet voice asked behind him.  He turned around.
:: Qye muttered in a tense, distracted voice.  The younger boy sighed.  ::
His mind imploded.  Everything rushed in, swirling into the middle, spiraling, spiraling to the blackness in the middle.  It pulled him in like a whirlpool, dragging his mind into the middle. . .
The Pater Nosferatu had a signal.  More importantly, Myn Opacre had called.
“The Ministry felt that someone with my…affliction…wouldn’t be suited to care for an infant.  They were worried of the dangers I might have presented once a month, which I can understand.”
In the same style that had fallen Ron, the trinkets from Professor Opacre's desk zoomed towards him.
Marylin sighed and leaned back in her chair, closing her eyes and rubbing her temples.  The Ravenclaw seventh years’ essays were spread out around her desk and she still had about half left to go.  But she had to take a break or she would go
“This is Libby Wainscott,” Smethwyck introduced the brown-haired woman at his side with her faint smile and piercing gaze.  “She’s my colleague at St. Mungo’s and a long-time friend since before our days at Hogwarts.  As you both know, she will be conducting the evaluation.”
He saw vampires dodging and punching, swirling around swiftly, one with a sword that blocked strikes and a woman sliding between groups and leaving bodies crumpled on the floor.
“How are you?” he asked, his eyes flicking between them, mouth opening and closing, wanting to say more but not having the words.
“There’s….something we need to talk about,” she said reluctantly, wishing this had all gone differently.  She wearily watched as Dumbledore looked at them thoughtfully, McGonagall suspiciously and Snape with carefully narrowed eyes.
He was quiet for a moment and then glanced over at her.  “Sort of,” he said slowly.  “There’s still…a few other things.”
Marylin looked up from cleaning up the last of the makeup materials to see Lest leaning against the doorframe staring at her.
“Although,” he added, shakily, walking backward towards High Street as he slowly let go of Draco’s hand, “I am very curious to know how you’ll explain this to Ron.”  He turned to the street, very conscious of Draco gradually joining him.  “Might be a short date.”
“I was asking if you felt like you were missing out on anything.”
,” Leon said, shaking his head in disbelief.  “They can’t be that desperate, can they?”
The next moment, Seamus and Neville were there, helping him as Harry fought wildly, putting themselves between him and the destruction.
He stood staring at it.
Harry’s eyes fluttered shut and he leaned against the relief of his burning forehead. He sighed quietly, forgetting the tension of the past week between the two.
Rage burned through him as he raised his Gemmus and struck at the mind of the Head of the Dazains.
“The Dazains,” Harry said, blinking as he remembered the name.
“I’m sorry,” Draco said.  Harry looked up at his silver eyes, soft and aching.  “I can’t apologize for my ambition because I do want things, will always want things.  But I’m sorry it took something horrible to happen for me to realize that there are ways I won’t go to achieve it, that it is not the kind of person I want to be.  And I’m sorry it happened to you.”
He gathered his courage and threw back the contents of the vial.
He murmured and he heard another groan from Draco, its sound luring him closer to the blond.
Ron had come up after classes had finished.  His redheaded friend didn’t say anything when he saw Harry staring up at the ceiling nor did he ask why Dumbledore had called him.  Harry bitterly guessed that the Daily Prophet had already gotten wind about his relatives’ death.
“There’s nothing wrong with Mr. Potter’s mentality nor has there ever been,” Dumbledore said calmly. “His…affliction…is not his fault.” He paused and cast a serious look towards the two vampires. “You looked naturally grim on hearing the name Dazain but unsurprised. Perhaps we should go to my office to discuss these matters further.”
Qye said quietly.
Dean shrugged, carefully not looking at the vampire.  “I don’t know,” he replied just as quietly, pushing around his mashed potatoes thoughtfully.  “Could be…I mean, I know Lupin was nice and all but he wasn’t a blood-sucking monster.”
Harry stared as the Head Nurse disappeared. A shine from the bedside table caught his eye and he weakly raised himself up on the pillows. He hesitantly reached for the twinkling light and he sighed in relief as he grasped the familiar feel of his glasses. Pulling them on, he winced at the sudden sharpening of everything before making himself comfortable on the bed to patiently wait for the nurse while casting suffering looks at the sunlight.
reared back as Ron’s fingers faintly touched his wand and he knew he wouldn’t reach it in time.
“Do you ever think of anything else besides food?” Hermione asked, annoyed.  Harry noticed that she didn’t object to them going there though.
:: Harry sighed, finishing copying down the instructions.  They were both silent for a moment as Harry quietly got his ingredients.  As he slowly began to cut them up, he said quietly, ::
"Anyway," she continued, smiling, "I'm sure you've all noticed my darling baby brother standing behind me giving me looks of death. He'll actually be helping us with said one-of-a-kind event."
“No, no,” Marylin continued hastily, also rising with placating hands as Lest remained seated, his fingers flexing while his eyes sharply observed the two.  “I said we wouldn’t, that’s not our intention at all.  Please, we all want what’s best for him, I assure you.”
His mouth opened and closed repeatedly as he stared dumbstruck at the other boy, unable to form any kind of response.  His stupor was broken by a low laugh from behind him.  Still stunned, Harry turned around to find the Slytherin smirking at him, his pale eyes shining with amusement as a few strands of white-blond hair fell into his face.  The black-haired boy felt heat slowly begin to creep up onto his face.
Harry didn’t say anything in reply and Qye blew out a breath, dropping his arms.  He eyed the wall between the beds and scowled as another piece of advice from the Healer crossed his mind.
His only hope was that Harry remained safe inside.
:: Qye mused.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked at the same time Ron demanded, “What are you free for?”
Qye glanced up at the man.  “Is it bad for my health?”
Then, very hesitantly, quiet little chuckles began to float in the room.
:: Harry thought, looking blankly at the school nurse as she ran her wand over him.  ::
But the objects that had interested him the most, besides the journal, had been the ring and necklace.
“That’s what you said about this one,” Harry said weakly as she tugged at the brown jacket she had pushed him into.  He batted her hands away and took a step back, yelping, as she reached for the gray slacks.  “No, no, we agreed I would do this!”  He vaguely thought he should be protesting more, surely there were provisions in the school rule for teachers treating their students like dress up dolls or something similar.
Harry said, warm as he felt Draco’s fingers twine slightly with his.
“Do you have a better idea?” Marylin asked sarcastically.  Leon sighed and lowered his eyes, shaking his head.   “Then we stick with this.  If you do come up with a better one, share it with us.  I know this plan is almost impossible - ”
Qye looked at Harry, who was looking around at the adults.
Opacre bared his fangs, blue eyes flaring.  “We just went over this, you - ”
In his head, he heard the soft sounds of someone hurting.
Qye’s lips twitched and he threw a pillow at the other bed.
Professor Opacre waved her hand again, still smiling widely.  “Oh, there will be no need for that, I have everything.”
Qye said, startled.
Unfortunately, Pomfrey snorted and began walking out of the room. “You’re not leaving until I figure out why you’ve recovered so soon. For all I know, the moment you walk out, you’ll be hit with the fever and be stubborn again and not return until you’re an inch from death. Better start getting comfortable, Mr. Potter.”
The female vampire's eyebrows shot up, understanding sweeping her face. "Oh," she chuckled, finally dropping her arm back to her side. "No, nothing like that. How to explain this..."
“I don’t see them that way,” she stated clearly.  “And neither does Qye nor Harry.  My responsibility is the stability and well-being of the mind of my patients.  And right now, forcing an identity on either one of them – particularly one that neither is open to – would be more harmful than what is currently happening to them right now.”
“This is why you should take a page out of our notes, little sister,” Fred began.
“How long are we supposed to have these medical reviews?” asked Harry.
:: Harry thought, staring blankly into the darkened room.  ::
Harry fought back a grin as he looked up at the intensely interested Seamus.  Draco turned to the dance floor, interrupted in the conversation they had been having about the Thestral from their project before the Gryffindors joined them.  Ron sighed across the table where he had been dodging Hermione’s persistent questions about his deal with Draco while also awkwardly trying to compliment her.
“I was wrong,” the redhead interrupted her and Marylin watched as he shot the brunette a look. “Besides, you know Harry. He’s always doing
“Yes, the war among vampires,” he said, laughing mirthlessly, his eyes cold.  “It’s convenient that Professor Opacre has failed to tell us anything about it.  It’s also convenient the vampires decided to send an ambassador right after their war ended, don’t you think?”
That voice whispering worriedly at him, fretting concern, the voice he had been talking to and bickering with all these months, thinking it was someone else, thinking he could help –
A pale eyebrow raised and Ron gritted his teeth as his eyes focused in the dark and found Malfoy leaning against a wall. A wall that he just happened to have to go by to get back to the Gryffindor Common Room with the snacks from the kitchens. Harry's 'victory' was being bragged to every one who had dueled Lest since no one seemed to have been able to beat him. And since Ron had been the closest after him, with Fred and George trailing behind him, a celebration was taking place. He, in effort to calm himself and
“He’s only trying to help,” Qye heard Harry quietly say from the other bed while he glared at the door, clenching and unclenching his fingers in the fabric.
:: the voice said in a slightly sick voice.  ::
He took a stumbling step forward, his breath trapped in his throat.
“I’m going back to Hogwarts as I said,” Harry said, studying the lights and hoping Ron and Hermione wouldn’t ask any questions later.  “I’m asking you, again, to give me some space.  And if you can’t, then I think we know how this is going to go.”
"Well, I see these practices have been useful," Professor Opacre said cheerfully as she dusted off a trembling Daphne Greengrass and sent her to the back. Her blue eyes glanced at the clock on her desk and she sighed. "It looks like we only have time for a few more duels, maybe one really good one." She turned back to them and winked. "I expect these final duels to go well since I assume all of you have at least learned a few things, yes?"
“Really?” Ron asked sarcastically, looking at Hermione in slight annoyance.  “Well, gee, I hadn’t noticed.  I always thought it was spring when we came back.”
Voldemort chuckled.  “Is this the best of your so-called courage now?”  A mocking smile came upon his thin lips.  “If the wizarding world could only see their beloved savior as he stands in fear of true power - ”
“Are you tired of me already?” he said, twirling the quill in his hand absently.
Qye said.
All those times Qye had easily slipped into control of his body.
Jonas made it to the side of the chair before he saw the tension in the adolescent’s shoulders, the way they quivered beneath the standard issued pajamas Poppy briskly changed them into each day.
How was he supposed to sleep knowing he accidentally made a date with Draco Malfoy?
Lest wasn’t looking at him. Lest was looking at a fifteen year old wizarding boy, staring at him with a strange look on his face. Lest didn’t see him…didn’t see his young best friend…didn’t see…
“I decide what’s best for him.”
Ron and Hermione stayed on through the Easter holidays and Harry struggled to find time to look more into vampires.  Even just reading Qye’s journal was difficult as most nights he was falling asleep the minute he got into bed.
“Don’t bother the students!” barked Snape, turning away from Professor Opacre and back to the students.  His eyes narrowed at them and he snapped, “What are you all gawking at?  You’re here to work, not to be the fools you are!  You should be approaching your last three ingredients by now!”  The students hastily resumed working as Snape stalked through the rows, growling at the Gryffindors.
.::  He was silent again then sighed.  ::
“Harry - ” the black haired man – ‘
“Welcome!” Dumbledore beamed at everyone.  The hall immediately became silent.  “I apologize for the wait but some matters had to be taken care of and now that they are, let us proceed with the Sorting.”
:: Qye muttered.  ::
He yanked open the door and snarled at the figure standing on his doorstep.  The figure had a black jacket and jeans on, the hood of his dark jacket pulled up so he couldn’t see the other’s face.  ‘
“The sessions you recommended,” Lupin said quietly, closing the repot and setting it aside.  He glanced to Black, who was looking down at his own copy, blank-faced.
Barely half a year ago, he would have never given any of his assignments over to the other boy and now here he was, taking advice from the Slytherin, trusting his word at least on this.  Looking at the blond, Harry mused about how much their rivalry seemed to have lessened since the beginning of the year.  Was Malfoy still his rival?
“May I interrupt?” came Myn’s faint, strangled voice from behind them. Both of them blinked, the annoyance vanishing from their eyes.
"Well, the first spells she did were aimed for the mind, did you notice?" she asked and a few murmurs ran through the crowd.
“The same like the rest of us?” Dean suggested and smiled when the sandy-haired boy scowled at him. “Look, she’s never given us anything that we can’t do so how can this be any worse?”
Professor Opacre carelessly waved a hand, smiling widely as she rocked on her heels.  “Oh, don’t worry about that, better safe than in a rush, right?” she said cheerfully.
“Who are you?” Vernon shouted, his voice trembling with fear.
“Wait!” The vampires turned, surprised, to him and he grabbed the bag lying at the end of the bed. Shifting through its contents, he picked out two red lollipops.
"Oh, calm down," he chuckled softly.  "I promise I'll do some studying."
Professor Opacre smiled at them both.  “Thank you,” she said quietly, inclining her head to them.  “I appreciate it.”  Malfoy just snorted but Harry grinned at her.  She smiled a bit more before turning around.
:: Qye had said quietly and firmly.  ::
Blinking again, Harry turned his head to the side and focused tired, fever-bright eyes on the blurred form of Madam Pomfrey.
he heard Qye whisper.
Although, he inwardly sighed as she crouched and fiddled with the straps on his boots, he really wished it hadn’t been with him.
Distantly, he heard the screams and shouts of confusion from the students as they pressed back from the entrance, huddled in masses while the teachers tried to reach in front of them.  Another beast dashed forward and Lest caught it in his grasp, his arm wrapping around its body as it tried to struggle free.
Qye said quietly.
He would be mostly alone in the Gryffindor Tower this year.  Hermione would be spending the holidays with her family in Holland and Ron was to go with his family to Romania to spend time with Charlie, the second eldest Weasley boy.  The Weasleys had invited - practically pleaded -him to come with them but he politely declined.  As much as he loved the redheaded family and saw them as his surrogate family, he wasn't actually part of their family.  He didn't want to impose on their family vacation and he finally managed to reassure them that he would be fine for the holidays by himself.
“We…we…um…we…”
“Yesterday, your temperature was abnormally high when I last checked it, Mr. Potter,” she said slowly, looking at Qye thoughtfully. “I was sure you would be in here at least a week. But if my spell is correct, then your health is…well, your health is perfect. As if you have had no fever at all.”
Harry stared for a long while at his hand on the doorknob, at the possibilities that awaited beyond it.
and trying not to notice how Qye and Hermione seemed to have a lot of similarities.  He was saved from thinking something up when the school nurse came out of her office.
:: he murmured back.  Just before he fell asleep, he thought he felt a gentle brush along his mind but the thought disappeared as consciousness did as well.
“You obviously need to know Professor Snape better,” Professor Opacre smiled sweetly back. “Everyone knows he doesn’t pay heed to those rules so why should I?”
Marylin sighed again and opened her eyes, looking down at the letter.  Her suspicion of Harry being Qye was flawed now.  She had heard, at the end of October, of the death of his relatives.  And when Lest had told her he had gone to see them and had gotten angry with them…it seemed to almost prove that Harry was indeed her little Qye.
:: Qye asked worriedly, his voice trembling. Harry shivered and he heard the distressed boy call his name again and again. It was so much, pushing down on him and he shook with it all and –
“Thanks, Professor,” the Gryffindor Chaser said.  Marylin couldn’t help but wince as the girl straightened herself and looked boldly right at Lest.  “I was wondering if maybe - ”
“Huh,” Qye blinked and considered something.  He chewed on his lip as he thought about it while Harry howled in his head.  Since he woke up, he had been reaching for Harry, for the familiarity of his mind to anchor him and didn’t think to stop while everything occurred.  “I wonder…”
Dublin and Antwerp, Zurich and Rotterdam, Cologne and Oslo.
Lest’s fear spiked.
Except this time, the contestant didn't fall. Ron must've seen the gesture because he shifted his feet, catching the push with his left foot behind him and balancing himself with his right foot in front. His wand hand did jerk forward, as if his wand wanted to fly out, but Ron's grip seemed tight and he only jerked forward a bit.
“You know the first thing I’m going to do as soon as I graduate?” Ron muttered Monday morning as he rubbed his tired eyes.  The sun was shining, the birds were singing and there was a Potions quiz first thing in the morning.
Hermione fidgeted.  “Maybe we should talk to Draco?” she said delicately.  “See if Harry would be more amenable?”
"Are you mad?" the Slytherin boy snapped, glaring at him while holding his wrist tightly.  "You put the root
“You’ll come to us when it gets too much though, right?” Ron frowned, looking at him. Harry nodded and Ron sighed. “Well, guess there’s much to do but wait then.” He made a sour expression. “I hate waiting.”
.’  She shook her head and sighed.  ‘
His eyes widened and he stumbled back, his hands flying up to grasp his throbbing head.  The pulsing had grown, stronger and louder and harder, so hard his mind reeled back from it.  It felt like someone had punched him in the mind and he gasped.  He could vaguely hear murmurs in the classroom but the pulse had grown and -
Harry muttered as he washed his hands roughly.
yourself if you do so."
“Come on, mate,” Ron said, glaring at the back of the Slytherin.  “We have Herbology next and that’s on the other side of the school.”
Harry closed his eyes and gently nudged that other presence, with little hope and disheartened.
“He’s family,” Sirius snarled, raising his wand, red sparks shooting out.  “I don’t know who the hell you think
“Hélène,” he heard someone breathe out and he looked to the doorway to see Nilsson standing shocked.  He straightened up and opened his mouth but she was gone before he could call out her name.
“How much longer are you going to stay?”
“I daresay you’ll hardly notice my presence,” he dryly said to the woman, trying to edge around her.  “The Headmaster just asked me to stop by - ”
Draco flew back and crashed on his back several feet away, coughing painfully.
She snorted and nodded to the back of the room.  “No, he decided to go terrify some of your classmates.  Lest – my brother – calls it
His free hand punched the door and Harry opened his eyes to stare at his bleeding knuckles.

:: the voice replied simply.  Harry growled slightly and he heard the voice chuckle quietly in his head.
Qye was silent.  Then he laughed softly, the laughter tinged with fond remembrance.  ::
Harry tried to send a sense of reassurance to the other boy but Qye wouldn’t have any of it.
As the black-haired teenager turned red under the startled looks and Hermione began to lecture him on his language and he stutteringly refused to reveal why he did so, he didn’t notice the look Ron was giving the faraway retreating back of the Slytherin.
The room fell silent again and he felt a slight shift next to him as he figured Remus must have turned to check on him.  He probably remembered the last time he heard Sirius laugh like that, in the Shrieking Shack, ready to kill a traitor.
“I think it’s bloody well established that Dumbledore has officially gone off the deep end,” Ron growled, glaring at their new schedules.
– to reveal her brother leaning casually against the doorpost.
Harry smiled slightly, eyes still closed.  Ever since they had returned from vacation, Ron and Hermione had been mothering him constantly, making sure he ate right and got a decent amount of sleep.  He had often seen them share worried looks when they thought he wasn’t looking and he wondered why they worried.  It wasn’t as if he was acting strange…at least, he didn’t think so.  True, he didn’t talk as much anymore to them – or to anyone for that matter – but he didn’t think that would matter.  He still spent the same amount of time with them, he just…didn’t talk.
,’ he thought again, except this time it was in instinctive recognition as he looked upon another body he knew so well because now he remembered, Qye remembered he had messy black hair Aunt Petunia tried to shave off and green eyes that needed glasses except he could see just fine now and knobbly knees and elbows from never being fed enough.
His pale lips curved into a humorless smile.  Well, his eyes weren’t the only thing that showed how pissed off he was.
She stopped as he slowly turned his head to look at her from where he had been looking out the window.
“That doesn’t change anything.”
"Some think that from these stones, that changed their strength from the Moon to blood, were the first vampires, the
“Is he okay, what’s happening to him?!”
“You’re both doing better than I was expecting,” Smethwyck said, folding his arms.  “But you’ll have to forgive me if I err on the side of caution when my patients wake unexpectedly.  Especially knowing what I know now about what you did.”
Qye asked curiously.
He took a deep breath and stood up.
Harry pointed out to the other boy.
-----
Qye said slyly and Harry wished not for the last time that the other boy was out of his head with his own body if only for a moment so that Harry could hit him for the smirk he felt.
Qye heard voices.
“Oh, hurry up, I’m starving,” Ron grumbled, looking longfully at the empty plates.  Harry shook his head as Hermione began to admonish Ron in a reprimanding whisper.  Ron shot him an agonized look but he merely shrugged, looking at the Sorting.  He didn’t catch the worried look exchanged between Ron and Hermione.
Thoughts of Harry smiling hesitantly at her, letting her pat his head, asking her for help to a date he was obviously excited for whirled through her mind, alongside the memories of Lest fiercely fighting through the war, his youthful smirks giving way to cold expressions, growing harsh and bitter under the expectations of leadership, trying to get back to his best friend.
“Hey, Harry,” she laughed, her eyes twinkling.  “Having problems training your boy?  I can give you a few pointers if you’d like.”  She laughed again when Malfoy snarled.
she trembled.  ‘
“What do you want Qye?”
:: he asked curiously.
“Where is he?” Malfoy said lowly as he roughly pulled the redhead up.
“My favorite student isn’t slacking off now, is he?” an amused voice said in front of him.  Jerking up and dropping his hands, Harry snapped his eyes to the front of his table to blink at a grinning Professor Opacre.
?  Do you figure I could get away with getting Fred or George to slip me some Firewhiskey to burn that memory away?”
idiot.”
“You don’t look fine Harry,” she responded promptly, peering at him.
Ron’s eyes widened in horror and he blasted a fire spell, blocked by one of the other vampires as the woman darted for his friend.  Seamus and Dean’s spells were likewise blocked by the vampires charging forward, Malfoy’s sunlight shield was intercepted by a beast and the woman raised her blade above Neville, petrified and staring, pale and wide eyed.
Seeing the nurse’s face begin to redden, Harry hastily cut in. “It doesn’t really matter.” Everyone turned to look at him and he shifted awkwardly on the bed. “I mean, it’s only one day and nothing really important happened that day, right?” Lest’s face flashed for an instant, causing Harry to pause for a moment before continuing. “Maybe it was the sickness that did that to me and messed with my brain while I seemed cured on the outside. And then it stopped and came back as a physical thing. But since I’m cured now, I don’t think it’ll happen again. If it’s not doing me any harm then I see no reason to worry so much about it.”
’ Harry thought and he heard Qye laugh softly as he continued to flip through his memories.
“Carus Noctivagus,” Verna suddenly said.  Jordan blinked and looked at the Elder.  She was looking at his cousin, an amused expression in her eyes.  “Is that not right, child?”
“Don’t you have anything better to do then dig for gossip?” she sniffed.
:: the person said and Harry shivered as he felt that physical-into-mental feeling in his head, telling him that they raised an eyebrow.  ::
Something glinted in the reflection of his glasses and his green eyes blinked as he saw his wand, lying on the floor in front of him.
:: - scowled at him and jerked his head to Harry’s bubbling potion. “Did you forget something?”
“Again,” said Jonas patiently, watching as Dumbledore carefully polished his glasses with a cloth from his robes, “as I told you before when we administered it two days ago, there has been no effects.”  They had administered the potion, with its power to awaken a person from a magically-induced sleep, when none of their other treatments showed any reaction in the sleeping pair.  And like everything else, it had done nothing except cause suspicious looks from the other staff on the case.
"Harry!"
“Wanna go down with a fight,” Jacob grinned.  “I would’ve done the same thing if I were in their place.”  He rubbed his hands together, an eager light in his eyes.  “Fighting wizards…now that’s going to be something…”
The room was dark and the hour was a little past one.  She had stayed at the Three Broomsticks long enough to make sure every student made it back to Hogwarts and helped Madam Rosmerta clean up.  The owner had been more than happy with the business the dance had brought and had assured Marylin of her support on the Hogsmeade council.  By the time every chair was put up and every glass put away, Marylin was longingly thinking of her warm bed.  Of course that was the time she noticed Lest hadn’t been waiting around for her.
.::  There was a silence again and Harry blinked his eyes, raising a hand to scrub away a couple tears of pain.  Then he jerked slightly as some of the pressure in his eyes faded.
There was no witty quip from Lest as he straightened from where he had hastily moved to avoid the fire. He raised his hand in what was becoming a familiar move to shove contestants down and snatch their wand.
“Snuffles, wait!” Remus called out exasperatedly, struggling with the pair of duffel bags.
Just as Harry rethought his decision to stay, Professor Opacre’s cheery voice came towards him.  “What’s up, Harry?”
Movement happened in the corner of his eye and Harry turned his head in time to see a beast lunge, its terrible features snarling at him.
Harry stopped stirring, staring at the faintly amused vampire.  Inside his head, Qye chuckled softly.
…:: he thought irritably to himself, taking a deep breath, his eyes still closed.
She hesitated before she finally bit her lip and reluctantly nodded.  “Alright.  Just this once,” she warned, giving him a narrowed look.
“Must have been a real
On top of the clothes had lain a couple of books with their pages yellowed.  They weren't handwritten like the journal and looked something akin to textbooks.  He had tried opening them but the books were tightly shut and no matter how hard he tried to pull the pages apart, they remained stuck as if glued together.  It had puzzled him since they appeared to have no locks and he had looked at the covers but there was only strange writing on it.  He had eventually given up on trying to open them, putting them under the mattress, bundling them up in the clothes.  He knew he probably should have turned them in but he just wanted to keep them a bit longer to study them.
:: Harry asked, furrowing his brow.
Qye trembled.
Qye swallowed painfully, squeezing his hand around Harry’s own tight grasp.
“As I was saying,” Smethwyck sighed and moved closer to them, his wand in hand as he gently waved it over Harry.  “I had mentioned my colleague - ”
“All my life, my father told me about the glory that awaited us should he ever return.  I never thought about exactly what he would do,” Draco whispered, a touch of bewilderment in his voice.  “My father kept saying things would be better, that purebloods would take the place they needed.  That trusting Muggles and the world outside of magic would bring nothing but ruin to our people.  And what does he do instead?”
Once or twice, he had seen Hermione open her mouth, obviously wanting to make him talk about how he felt about the fate of the Dursleys but, thankfully, Ron had just shaken his head at her and she went silent.  Harry absently wondered what was going on between them, what with all this silent communication and understanding among them.  He wondered if it meant that they would realize their feelings soon.  He hoped it did because he doubted he could take much more of their bickering.
thankful he didn’t. Did he remember grabbing and clinging on to Lest in the middle of his second fainting fit? Someone kill him now, Voldemort, where are you?
“I said - ” Harry began and stopped as Draco growled.
"Now, does anyone care to share why exactly Hermione lost?" Professor Opacre asked finally, after the Gryffindors hurriedly finished their congratulations. There was a silent response, even from the Slytherins, as Hermione frowned in their midst. Professor Opacre chuckled and grinned at them. "Okay, I see your point."
“HARRY!”
“I guess it kind of is the place to see around here,” Harry said, shifting on his feet.  His brows furrowed as Lest stopped right in front of him, still looking at him with that strange look in his eyes.  “Lest?”
:: he hissed at the other boy, trying to push away the blush.  ::
Dark green eyes moved back to him and he deliberately made sure they could see Jonas putting away his wand.
Next chapter: "New Normal"
His skin had more color.
“That,” the vampire man said tightly, dark brown eyes staring menacingly as Harry choked and tried to pry the hand off his throat, “was unwise.”
The kiss was warm and inviting, dazing him with each breath they took.  Harry lost track of when his eyes had closed, trying to ground himself with the taste of butterbeer still lingering on Draco’s lips.
He could hear his son whimpering and his wife sobbing hysterically but all he could do was stare in horror at the figure.  There was something terribly familiar about this situation…
The dog in front of him growled and Remus broke away from his regretful thoughts, frowning down at his friend.  He nudged him with his knee as they caught up to him, returning the dog’s baleful glower with a stern frown.
Beside him, Harry felt Malfoy stiffen.  Inside him, Harry felt Qye freeze.

and screamed…”
,’ she thought absently.  Then she frowned.  Harry was in Gryffindor.  And although he was apt at spells, he was in no ways at all like his studious friend.  She sighed and placed her elbows on her desk, rubbing her temples.
The dog pawed at the ground, impatiently watching as Remus worked to secure the other bag that had loosened during the exit
“Too late!” laughed one of the vampires as he danced around a Stinging Hex and kicked Ron in the back, sending him sprawling.  “Is this the best magic can offer?” he taunted as he sent another kick, straight into the teenager’s ribs and forcing a cry of pain.
“You will not touch these students,” Professor Sinistra said coldly, raising her own tall frame to match the vampire.
Harry wiped away all traces of his smile and nudged the sulking blond’s shoulder with his own.  “Sorry, continue.”
This caused the teenagers to wince, his sister to nod thoughtfully and Pomfrey…
The black clad man looked at him for a moment, the pale face half-shadowed.  Then slowly, the pale red lips curved into a sadistic smile.
-----
“Oh, you know, he just wanted to bug me again,” he said, shrugging and shoving his hands in his pockets.  “It’s his role in life, remember?”  Ron growled slightly and continued to glare at the corner as if it were Malfoy himself.  Harry smiled slightly, then turned to look at Hermione.
:: he shouted, shivering as the sensation continued.
read more like fantasy coated in speculation in order to sell.
The spell hit one of the castle windows, shattering onto the vampires and wizards dueling.  Remnants of the spell bounced back.
“Really, I’m fine,” Harry said, catching the redhead’s headshake.  Ron looked him in the eye and he blinked.  Something seemed to have flashed in Harry’s eyes, something that looked to be behind the emotions, both fake and real.  Something that didn’t seem to belong to Harry.  He frowned.
Qye looked over, his jaw clenching as he saw Lest looking away from him, his dark blue eyes meeting Harry’s own while the others looked uncertainly between them.  He saw Sirius frowning, glancing at Harry, looking at Qye again and Qye looked down quickly, gripping onto Harry’s shoulder.
“What happened?” he asked.  Even to his own ears, his voice sounded odd.  He dully wondered if he should be feeling anything but this strange numbness.
“Like I said?” Hermione finally squeaked.  “Ron…you…”
“What?” he hissed slightly as he turned back to his potion, stirring it counter-clockwise.  He heard Malfoy sigh.
Qye hardly spoke about anything except to urge him to take another look at the library, swearing that they could fix this.
“Ron!” Hermione said, overcoming her own stunned silence, blinking rapidly as she turned to the redhead.  “Besides your obvious language, I thought you were beginning to understand the need for maturity!  You - ”
:: the voice said slowly.  ::
“Any update, Healer Smethwyck?” the nervous Minister asked as his fingers clenched and unclenched on his hat.  “Has he…I mean, the recovery is proceeding, yes?”
The blonde-haired woman waited until she was sure the two out of earshot before rounding on the Headmaster.
“He’ll be fine, Draco.”
He caught Draco looking at him sideways as he coughed and he paused in cleaning. He chewed his lip for a moment, and then on impulse, grabbed the other boy’s hand, giving it a small squeeze. “Thanks for worrying,” he said softly, giving him a small smile.
Swallowing, Harry nodded hesitantly.  The vampire just continued to stare at him emotionlessly and Harry began to feel uneasy, suddenly uncomfortable with the nosferatu.  He dropped his eyes and reached for the next ingredient…
!" Ron snapped out the minute Professor Opacre's hand dropped.
Harry dropped his elbows to the table again, raising his hands to rub at his temples while he closed his eyes.  He was going to have a headache later on, he was sure of it.
Something fell to the floor,
hands.
“You’re on your own, mate,” Ron joked.
The man from before stepped in between them and Qye narrowed his eyes as he helped Harry carefully sit down, trembling and holding onto the bedpost for support.
Qye said as he looked from behind Harry’s eyes.
“First he hires a vampire for a professor and now this!” Ron raged, scowling darkly at their schedules.  “It’s like he’s planning to kill us!”
“Dumbledore mentioned in his letter that there was a vacant teaching position at Hogwarts,” he said coolly.  “Defense Against the Dark Arts.  He said that no one seemed to want to take the job and if I knew anyone, he would be more than happy to take them on.  He obviously wants me to suggest a vampire for the job, I suppose his way of ‘helping’ fight against the ‘injustices’ done against us.”
Harry’s brow furrowed as he continued to keep his eyes closed.  ::
The Head of the Opacres and European vampires said nothing.  He merely raised his right hand to touch something around his neck.
look on her face even when she walked up to him and gave him a huge hug, which he weakly returned.
He hadn’t heard any screaming or seen any stray curses so he was hoping that Draco and Ron had managed to keep to just insults.  That or one of them had been incredibly stealthy in knocking the other unconscious or immobile.
Qye suddenly yelled, making Harry squeeze his eyes shut and cover his ears uselessly.
Qye said idly.
“The Dark Lord wasn’t lying about tying the portkeys with the beasts,” hummed the man as he twisted the spiked wristbands.
“I just haven’t been getting a lot of sleep lately, that’s all,” he murmured, picking at the food on his plate.  “It was bound to catch up to me eventually.”  He slowly lifted a forkful of vegetables and ate them, their taste nonexistent to him.
The two Gryffindors silently followed their Head but not without taking a last worried look at the room where their best friend lay unconscious.
He blinked again.
“Someone has to watch out for you if you won’t,” he grumbled.  “You’ve got the bloody survival instincts of a puffskein in a kneazle pen.”
“Harry,” Hermione said gently and he looked at her softened, worried face. “Harry, you really have to eat something. You’re sick as it is.” Harry opened his mouth but another voice spoke behind them.
A sudden thought came to him and he narrowed his eyes thoughtfully.
.::  As he stepped into his sneakers, another thought came to him.
Draco’s eyes shot open as well and Harry swallowed hard at the sight of his flushed cheeks and red lips, the glazed and heated look still in his silver eyes.  He wavered, disoriented, body instantly wanting to go back to that feverish haziness.
“Back would indicate they were ever there in the first place, Soror,” Lest said in a bored voice.
.  And not just because you think he’s a jerk, is it?”
“Fight fire with fire,” Jordan suddenly said, eyes widening.  He blushed when everyone turned to look at him and sunk in his seat.  He coughed and looked timidly at his cousin.  “That’s what you mean to do, isn’t it?  Use this alliance with Dumbledore to fight against Voldemort if the Dazains do join him.”
One voice in particular stood out.
Harry thought as he stared out the window of the Infirmary as the late afternoon sunlight glittered on the lake.
“But periods end,” a boy she recalled as being Theodore Nott scowled.  “How do we know that animal blood may stop ‘sustaining’ you during one of our lessons and you decide to take a few liters out of us?”
“I’m tired,” he said simply, looking back down at the floor, his foot nudging a discarded book.
Beneath the bottle of Firewhiskey, the summons letter to the trial of Peter Pettigrew waited.
“Ron, leave him alone,” he heard Hermione scold the redhead.  In a gentler tone of voice, she asked him, “Are you okay, Harry?”
:: he muttered at the other as he thought about what to do.
Harry restrained a smile as Qye blew a raspberry.
Inside his head, Jonas was quietly making his apologies to all the patients he had put on hold and the Healers he had transferred some to so that he could take on the case.  He had a feeling he wasn’t returning to St. Mungo’s for the foreseeable future.
It impacted against nothing ten feet in front of the students and fell to the floor, out cold from the force of Marylin’s shield.
Opening his eyes, he stared dully at the wall opposite of the bed, worry coursing through him. The other boy was still there, still in the back of his mind. He could feel him, feel that familiar close-by presence that always radiated from his mind. But…he was distant. Not distant as he was away, separated from him, but distant in consciousness. The only word that he could apply to what his state of being felt like was sleep.
to him?!”
:: Qye responded promptly and Harry blinked.
Both blue eyes snapped to the entrance.
“I asked for a moment, Draco,” Harry said softly, staring straight ahead, his steps slowing.  Draco stopped and looked furiously at him.  “I just wanted a moment to think about what you said and what the next step would be.  I had no clue he was there or what he was going to do or why.  I’m going to assume you didn’t either so I don’t know why you didn’t give me that moment.”
Harry thought, terrified as he struggled against them. There were so many and as he began to resist, they seemed to constrict, growing even more determined to not let him go and his fear grew as that terror brushed against his mind. ‘
Qye looked straight at Harry.
“I don’t trust them, Severus,” Draco said quietly, his tall, lithe form tense. “I don’t trust them around him. Dumbledore trusts and listens to you so why aren’t you doing something - anything for Salazar’s sake - against them?” He shot a half-accusing look at his godfather, who scowled lightly.
He snorted mirthlessly.
He felt the tears streaming down his face as he stared down at his hand, white knuckled around the door handle.
“How old are you?” the brown-haired boy asked, raising an eyebrow.
"Ah, but he's got his ever-loving immortal to keep him going, don't you know?" Seamus interrupted, smirking from his place at the table. Harry could feel the scorching heat of Hermione's glare to his right and a few other Gryffindors added their own (low-volume) catcalls. His face reddened and he didn't know whether to ignore it or deny it fervently, sure either one would prolong his embarrassment.
“Where were you?” Qye threw out, accusation plain in his eyes.
"We're going to be late for Potions," she said in an annoyed voice.  "As I have been trying to tell you for the last five minutes."  The irritation left and she looked at him worriedly.  "Are you alright, Harry?"
“But, I remember everything else,” Harry said, head pounding with confusion and the remnants of the sickness. “I remember getting sick four days ago and collapsing in the Great Hall after…” Here he shivered as he faintly recalled the vision and the split in his head. “After my fit,” he finished. “I remember everything that happened up to that point and I remember waking up yesterday with the fever. And you said I was out the entire day the day before that. So that day before that is the only thing I can’t really remember.”
He could see his hand reaching for the door knob, felt the chill of the bathroom but for all his want he could not move a step forward, could not lift his hand any further.
“Listen, Harry,” the sandy-haired boy said uncomfortably, his eyes not meeting Harry’s cool ones.  “I’m sorry about that.  I…I guess I kind of overreacted there.”  Seamus looked timidly up, forcing a weak grin.  Raising a hand towards Harry, he continued, “You know I was just – ”
Harry looked confusedly at the others, especially when he noticed the embarrassment in their faces.
He was waiting in the corridor, most likely for Professor Opacre, leaning against the wall with a distant look in his eyes.  As soon as most of the other students cleared the corridor, the vampire glanced over at the doorway and met his green eyes.
Ron, glaring down at his History of Magic notes which had more doodles than anything, said distractedly, “What else is new?”
The pictures were missing from the walls.  The rugs, the vases, the carpet – which Harry had heard had been heavily streaked with blood - were all gone.  One of the Aurors of his escort had muttered how he didn’t want to go into the house again after seeing the carpet, not noticing Harry had been standing behind him.  The other Auror had nudged the muttering Auror, jerking her head to him staring.  The Auror stopped muttering and had flushed, looking away from him.  Harry hadn’t said anything.
’ he thought indignantly.  ‘
:: he muttered to the other boy.  ::
Harry stared and slowly nodded.  “Okay…well, then.  I’ll…see you tomorrow at four.”  He ducked his head in embarrassment.  “Thanks again, I know this is probably really strange.”
“You know,” grumbled Ron as he climbed down from the Divination classroom, “I don’t know who’s battier – Trelawney or Dumbledore.”
“Why do you have guides for the N.E.W.T.s?” Ron asked incredulously, momentarily distracted.  “We’re barely taking the O.W.L.s!”
“Come on, then,” he muttered, brushing her off and beginning to stalk down the corridor.  “We wouldn’t want to miss anything, would we?”
After he had made a quick trip to the bathroom to retch out his final nerves and wash his face into a semblance of calmness, he had returned to the sight of Sirius Black stumbling out of Potter’s room, his face white and eyes wild, while a brown-haired man Jonas took to be Remus Lupin unsteadily led him back to the main room of the wing they had adopted as their more permanent residence for Potter’s treatment.
he whispered.
Harry could feel the struggle and he shuddered because it was so much worse now, knowing that feeling was just a small part of him locked away and –
“Always pleasant, Weasley,” Malfoy smiled tightly as the new butterbeers arrived while he and Harry sat down.  Ron’s scowl deepened as Malfoy sat right across from him.  “Although I fail to see exactly what I did to offend.  Is it the lack of lace I have?  I realize we’re at an event but even I didn’t see - ”
The redhead glowered at her, viciously stabbing a piece of sausage.  “The greasy git would deserve it,” he growled, taking a fierce bite out of the piece of meat on his fork.  “Honestly!” he said suddenly, throwing down his fork and glaring at it.  “Who the hell gives a
Fudge was a moron.  Simple and clear.  The foolish Minister continued to act as if everything was perfectly under control even though it wasn’t, reassuring the tense and worried magical community that there was nothing to be afraid about.  He had added a few more wards and guards, passed some curfew acts, and had given a bit more power to Dumbledore but other than that...nothing.  The idiot acted as if the threat of Voldemort was nothing!
His hands clenched slightly, once again reaching out for that other part in his mind that represented the other boy in his head. And he sighed when he once again felt that flicker and unconscious rejection. Still, that refusal was better than the lack of reaction he had yesterday.
“Custom and protocol dictate that if a minor is elected to be a Carus Noctivagus, said minor's parents or guardians must give consent so that the vampire’s family can make legal arrangements for their well-being,” Marylin explained carefully.  She gestured to the papers on the table, carefully arranged as if ready for debate.  “Since his parents were dead and the Dursleys didn’t seem to care, Lest didn't consider them real guardians and, well…we worked around that.  To make sure no one could question that Lest had rights to protecting and providing for him.”
Lest stiffened.
They had no clue what was going on but whatever it was, they were going to be there for Harry.
He finally gave up as Harry just wrapped himself in his blankets even more.  Throwing his hands up in the air, he shouted, “Fine!  I give up!”
“Are…are you alright?” Hermione asked hesitantly when he fell in beside her.
:: the other boy said quietly.  ::
"Lest, stop antagonizing," Professor Opacre scolded as she waved a hand at her brother. She moved back behind her desk and raised her hand. Lest merely smiled coolly as Ron tightened his hand on his wand.
“Harry!” Qye cried, shock pushing away his anger and whirled around to see Harry on his knees, swaying.  He awkwardly wrapped an arm around Harry’s middle, effortlessly hoisting him up on wobbly legs.
“What do you want from us?” Harry cut in before Qye could say anything.
“With what?  That he’s an idiot?  Kind of common knowledge,” Draco had smirked.  Harry had scowled, sure that the blond had done something, but before he had a chance to cut into the Slytherin, a familiar voice spoke.
“I’ve nothing to say to you,” Malfoy interrupted flatly and Remus watched as Marylin took a deep breath, smile fading away.
Harry scowled and turned his face away from his smirking rival, who resumed his way to the Slytherin Table where he promptly sat down.  ‘
The person froze as he threw himself at them, wrapping his arms around them, shaking and choking with pain, landing in someone’s lap. The voices stopped, there was quiet, peaceful quiet, and his cries and whimpers echoed loudly as the blows came again and again.
Harry looked at her and then gently touched the hand holding the bottle.
,’ he raged silently, glaring furiously down at the vampire’s face, whose eyes were closed. ‘
A vampire woman smirked and lifted her blade again at the older woman.
he also said to Qye, who quietly watched Professor’s Opacre smile through his eyes.
Two figures suddenly came around the corner they were passing, both crashing into her brother. Lest stumbled into Marylin, causing her to yelp and stagger, barely managing to stop her fall. Lest’s war-trained reflexes kicked in immediately, shoving the two figures away with one hand, reaching for his Gemmus with the other, teeth bared. Marylin automatically took her stance next to him, her own hand flying to her Gemmae –
“The Headmaster would like to speak with you, Potter,” she said in a tight voice.  Harry’s brow furrowed slightly.  It almost sounded like she was…pained?  Her eyes appeared to be a bit too bright as well.  Apprehension began to bubble up in him.
"Another factor is how well a vampire increases harmonization during Maturation. By harmonization, I mean increasing resonation so that a jewel is practically a part of the vampire. I can't explain the process very well, mostly due to limitations set by kind as to how much I can. All I can say is some vampires do it well and others...fail, through their own personal faults or perhaps outside forces. Whatever a pureblood comes out by the time they finish Maturation, however, will be the final result."
“So we are in agreement,” Wainscott said, unruffled, raising her wand and waving it lightly.  Qye glanced over as he heard Sirius hiss, saw the man staring angrily at the Mind-Healer, rubbing at his throat.  “Forgive me, Mr. Black, I felt it best to let that argument run its course.”  She raised a hand, stalling his argument.  “We can discuss it later but for now, let me make sure Qye and Harry understand the full recommendation.”
“Losing any part of my memory is disturbing, yeah,” he shrugged uncomfortably and was it just him or did Lest just shift uneasily? “Maybe the fever did it and I was delirious so I can’t remember anything?”
“But nothing, Saira,” Leon rumbled, looking at her with his serious brown eyes out of a pale face.  “You know as well as I that the boy is pretty much right about the Dazain faction being defeated.”
“Who are you?” asked Dazain softly, gaze fascinated.  “Who is in there?”
Harry tilted his head, hiding the thrill at the thought of next time.  “What?” he said slyly, a small smirk playing at his lips.  “The black robes and dragonhide gloves don’t do it for you?”
returned doubt the safety of this castle because of the tragic incident last June.”  Harry heard a sniffle that suspiciously sounded from the Ravenclaw table but he did not turn to it, instead firmly focusing on Dumbledore and his words.  “However,” the Headmaster said quietly, still smiling, “I assure you that we are quite safe here.  I’m very much aware of the danger in the world and over the summer I have had our wards strengthened to protect each and every one of you.  I give you all my word that you are safer here than you possibly know.  You will not need to fear Voldemort so long as I am here.”
The blush faded away slowly and the black-haired boy blinked up at the vampire.  Harry studied the vampire thoughtfully for a moment.  Feeling an encouraging nudge from Qye, he nodded tentatively, reassured.
He idly drummed his fingers on the table.  One good thing about the huge workload was that he hardly dreamed anymore.  Of course, the exhaustion didn’t stop the dark thoughts plaguing him while he was awake.  Thoughts like why Voldemort had only made two major attacks since his return and where would he strike again.  Thoughts like how much danger were his friends in now that the Dark Lord had come again.  Thoughts like what would he do when he faced his parents’ murderer again.
,’ Jonas sighed inwardly, beyond irritated and tired because he knew what argument was coming and there were frankly more concerning matters he'd rather be spending time on, such as the two young men he left Poppy with, who at least was making an attempt to handle the unusual situation with her usual brisk professionalism.   “Who the hell said you get to make a decision on his treatment?”
"That's right, how well we resonate." Seeing their still confused faces, she continued. "Here, to give you a little more background, let me explain how our jewels are given to us.
.’  He sighed and grabbed his quill.  ‘
“’Patience is a virtue,’” Harry quoted and grinned at the glare he received for his quip. “You know, I hoped you two would visit to alleviate my boredom but this wasn’t exactly the visit I expected.”
Marylin rolled her eyes. They walked in silence, Lest looking at the paintings with a diffident look and Marylin looking down at the ground. Biting her lip, she glanced at her younger brother.
,’ he thought darkly.
They both looked up when Hermione suddenly shoved aside her Transfiguration text and pulled out a guide, swiftly flipping through it.
“I think this is a little more than gossip,” Zabini said dryly at the same time as Seamus grinned widely and answered with a cheerful, “Nope!”
“I just…” Harry sighed and gazed at that the shack and the barren land surrounding it, mindful of the careful manner the blond was holding himself.  “I guess I’m just surprised by how easy this is going.  It almost feels too easy.”  He toyed with one of the loose panels of the fence.  “You can’t tell me you don’t feel the same way.”
Harry urged silently, eyes focused on the moving vampire.
As they reached the door, Draco suddenly called out his name.  Harry turned around warily, Ron glaring furiously at the cool blond, Hermione still looking thoughtful.
“You do too,” Harry responded, smiling back at her.  He glanced between her and Ron and a little smirk came upon his face.  “Any particular reason?”
A sudden motion brought him back from his thoughts – and drove the Libidates away again – and he looked down to see
“Hey, can we go to the kitchens?” Ron asked suddenly.  “We can get something warm there.”
He blinked.  A small girl – no, a teenager? – stood in front of him, cracking her knuckles as she shifted her feet.  Her black hair was done in a short ponytail and he noticed an armband high on her bicep as she lifted her fists up.
The bushy-haired girl shook her head, quickly taking out a thick book and hiding her face behind it.  Harry blinked at the hidden girl as they rounded the corner to the Potions classroom.  He turned his face away from her and back to the other boys as he heard Seamus and Ron erupt into laughter.
Harry froze.
“As some of you may have noticed, Professor Marylin Opacre is an emissary for the vampires,” Dumbledore said calmly, obviously ignoring the horror in the room.  “She is a guest and will be one of your professors for the year.  You will show her respect and listen to what she has to say.”  He smiled at the stunned group of students.  “I think it best for all of you to remember me saying that all of you are in the safest place possible, and that includes safety from your professors.  Professor Opacre is here to teach you, not harm, so do not hasten to rash actions.  And the Ministry has approved her being here,” he added as students begin to whisper, “so do give your new DADA teacher a chance.”  He smiled brightly at them.  “Now, let feast begin,” he ended cheerfully and clapped his hands, causing the golden plates to fill.  The blond vampire sat down as soon as he did and immediately began talking to him quietly.
“What does that mean?” Qye said, voice hoarse.  He cleared his throat, dropping his arms and straightening up.  “Does that mean you think we’re just going to, what?  Change our minds one day?  Say ‘oh, you know what, you’re right, we actually do want to get mixed up altogether, lose everything about us and becomes gods knows what’ - ”
He felt Qye randomly flicking through his memories, distracted and restless.
The beast’s legs twitched but did nothing more, torn from its torso.
Both teenagers lay silent, still with  magic flickering unseen around them.
Sirius idly scratched his chin, trying to work out what to say.  “Something I thought about those first few years.  Before the dementors really…well, there were still a few Black properties I could have raised you at if I got out.  Probably best I didn’t, I found out many got raided and sold by the Ministry after my imprisonment.”
"A tip: the minute you think of your attack, do it and do it fast. It's the only way to win and if you ever face a vampire seriously...well, winning means living."
Draco stood back warily, eyeing the path and Harry.
“If your refer to immortal as being unable to die,” she said dryly, “then you’ll have to look elsewhere.  While it is harder to kill one of the undead like myself, it is not impossible.  I won’t tell you how to kill one, however,” she said, her eyes twinkling slightly, “Since I plan on finishing out the year here.  I would like to get my paycheck for this and go for a long trip of shopping.”  There was more laughter at this and she saw a few roll their eyes in good fun.  She inwardly rejoiced.
The bundle froze.
“Is it Voldemort?” Hermione asked quietly.  “The O.W.L.s?”  She paused briefly.  “Draco?”’
He looked at the blond from the corner of his eye.
.::  He felt a sense of surprise and curiosity from the other and he furrowed his brow more.
Make him Qye?
Qye noted and Harry noticed he was still just giving off stammers. Professor Opacre's eyes had started to crinkle in concern so he bit his lip and stared back at her, not sure what to do next.
He had come back from the Dursleys' home with many things.  A sadness and bitterness followed him everywhere for about a week after going back to the house he had been raised and lived in.  He had sadly wished that he and the Dursleys could have mended some things, bridging the gulf of hatred between them.  But they were dead now and that separation between them would always be there.  He had laid in his bed a couple of sleepless nights, staring bitterly at the canopy of his four-poster bed, thinking about how that mend would never come because the Dursleys had been so close minded, so stubborn, so
All vampires froze.
“Sorry, Mother,” Harry muttered, taking a bite out of his toast.  Ron sniggered and Hermione shot him and Harry dirty looks.
Qye mumbled, mind obviously somewhere else.

“He’s sleeping now,” Madam Pomfrey said quietly as she walked out of the room where Harry lay unconscious.
From an archway from the school, Marylin saw Draco Malfoy step forward, bloodied and panting, wand raised as the one who shot the spell, his face pale but hand steady.
