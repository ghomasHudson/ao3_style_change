So, she went digging like she said she was going to. Here's the good news, simply telling Sharon what happened to her son did put her at peace enough that she's ready to go when her time comes. She never got married again nor had any other children, so it'll be nice for her to get to the other side and be with her son once again.
Saturday at 8:48 AM
"Eeek! Harry Potter!" The timid young man squeaked when he spotted you, clearly not expecting someone so famous to just casually walk up to a group he was part of.
I moaned, "Oh Gods, now there are two of you!"
As much as you do need extra help while you're pregnant, magical help while you're limiting your own magic, insistence on sleeping and eating enough, emotional support to keep your stress down, I forget that the way you own me, the way you care for me, is for you almost as much as it's for me. You need to own and possess me the same way I need to be owned and possessed by you. I always forget, because I need my submission for my own emotional needs, that the reason we work so well as Dom and sub, is because you crave it the same way.
I may cast some muffling charms on my ears, because I definitely want to go with them while they experience all the new rides, but I am a bit worried about how much shrieking they're going to do.
I guess Oliver is still speaking to you so I'm sure the two of you are having a delightful reunion. Enjoy. I have zero interest in playing "welcome the conquering hero" with someone who's done what you did. You took a fucking unbreakable vow? To not so much as send an email saying you were alright. To not speak to or be allowed messages from your loved ones while you were gone.
Erm... don't answer that. I'm certain I know they'd not be best pleased in the slightest. Damn it.
Carried by Colm
"Eh? Qu'est-ce que tu voudrais manger, ma petite?" I asked because Oliver only has translation earbuds, not some sort of device to translate speaking (as I haven't ever been able to invent such a thing, despite trying).
But I've gotten off track. Where I was going with this is that say I split my entire vault and all my businesses up amongst the kids when I feel it's time to retire, leaving me/us with a comfortable amount of money but nowhere NEAR what we currently have. That still leaves your ENTIRE fortune to care for us in our old age AND help the kids out as necessary. All in all, a rather nice retirement plan, haha.
Two, yeah, mm, that's lovely.
Elena volunteered to take charge of the others until Saoirse and Rhys returned from their own sightseeing. I think Leah and Pippa actually returned first and were recruited to her cause, but in any case, I was alone in our room, waiting for you to come back.
I'm only awake now because Viona needed her just after midnight feeding, and I'm crawling back into bed right now to let her drink her bottle while laying between us. Muffy has orders to change her (again) if needed and to let me sleep until her next feeding. And even then, I might just summon a bottle, shove it in her mouth, and go right back to sleep.
"You're all bloody rich kids! What can YOU possibly have to talk to a Mind Healer about?" She sneered in a tone I used to use all the time at her age.
Thankfully we only had to wait out the storm for about an hour and a half and managed to get ourselves home around two in the morning. We dragged a sleepy Shtara, Zaire, and Jaz to their rooms and let the house elves levitate the sleeping trio to theirs. It was certainly no surprise that I was the first and only one up this morning to get breakfast ready. I was a bit surprised to see both Eris and Orion had brought friends home for the weekend. I know we gave them permission, but they hadn't told me they were.
Thursday April 15th
"No, you probably dreamt it accurately," Pansy assured me with a grin. She reached into Blaise's trousers, shook her hand vigorously a few times, and pulled out something that looked like an elephant's trunk.
My Foggy Love,
"Oh! Romeo! Heh, so that's his name..."
We won't ever have to worry about war touching Jaz, or abuse touching Zaire. We can just exist in a bubble inside the Manor wards. It will be wonderful. I see no drawbacks. It's a plan! Meet you at home!
I scoffed, amused despite the fact that it wasn't helpful to the situation in the slightest. "Harry DID hate me, but my situation has NOTHING to do with yours, so the same actions don't apply here."
This time, I actually feel traumatized. I feel like this was even worse than the first time. Part of the reason is that I was touched a LOT without my genuine consent. Part of it is because the lust potion did it's job so well that I am legitimately confused about all the times I cried out things like: "Yes! Fuck me harder!" But the biggest thing that is traumatizing me is that I am now seriously wondering if something is fundamentally wrong with me.
I raised a brow in intrigue. "You mean that thing I mentioned a few times?"
Harry
You harrumphed and gave me a glare that was intended to be fierce but what actually so adorable that I couldn't help but kiss you again.
You caress my cheek so tenderly as we embrace under the dark night sky, our eyes close, our lips meet, and our hearts beat in time with the rhythm of the universe,
She took a nice long sip and sighed in pleasure. "That's lovely! Right so, I know enough about magic to know that *true* psychic abilities are rare. That said, I also know that you must have at least a touch because of your dreams - once upon a time ago."
You two kept playing with your boys for a little bit longer, but this was Nev's first Sounding attempt and we've yet to fully figure out the timing for coming and Sounding, so the two of you slowly removed the Sounds before we'd actually come. I felt like I'd run a marathon as opposed to sitting still and letting you do all the work.
Anyway, after telling Sharon what I saw in my vision, Hannah used some free time to visit the house that Liam's dad and step mom lived in with him. Side note, Hannah could really benefit from that public floo system I want to build, and yes, I adore that you associate it with the Tardis ^_^
Then I picked up a ring that you most definitely recognized, Harry. Oliver recognized it too, and tilted his head to look at me in confusion. I grabbed his hand and slipped the ring on his right ring finger.
Oh! My portkey is here. I love you forever. Hopefully I am not dying. Don't worry, if I am dying I will come back and see you before I die. Don't let Sirius kill you, and try not to kill him either while I'm not there to run interference.
I KNEW in my heart that they had purposefully messed with my Ollie. I knew it hadn't been a mere mistake that they gave you a contraceptive and knew it couldn't have been a coincidence that contraceptive also included poison. Whether they intended to outright kill you, keep you sick, or just keep you from conceiving, they violated your trust. They violated your marriage. They corrupted your future. And it seems as though they were hoping to destroy your spirit.
I remember the first Christmas I ever woke up to gifts that were for me, it's amazing to finally feel at least a little normal. We won't be there this morning when they open all of their gifts, and it wouldn't be fair to ask them to wait just because we wanted to be there for the opening, so I asked the staff if they could take a million pictures. I did at least get to see them all open their pajamas last night, and when we go over later I am sure we will have twenty-one little giggling faces trying to climb over each other to be the first to show off their loot. I'm so glad we went a little overboard with the gifts this year.
Again, Saturday bedtime was spent waking with the babies a few times. A few more than the night before, but nothing two Daddies couldn’t handle!
Draco
So, I had a bit of an epiphany today. I think I'm going to do what you suggested and go through full Auror training. NOT because I want to be any sort of Auror. NOPE! I cannot even imagine being bound to such a thankless job with such terrible hours!
Forever young. (Forever young)
No matter where we go on holiday, no matter the location, even if we end up on one of those holidays where not a single thing goes wrong ... is there anything better than knowing we're on our way home? Knowing that when I lay my head down tonight it will be in our own bed on my own pillow. That we'll read the kids bedtime stories in their own beds. Be able to stroll through the gardens if we're not too tired after we get all the littles to sleep.
P.S. It's NOT that I don't trust her to be professional, it's that she SAW me being all blubbery!
My beloved husbands,
P.S. I wasn't going to stick my nose in where it wasn't asked for, but since you did specifically tell me the story about Shayla I decided that was close enough to asking for it. I have a plan. It may or may not work, you know I support a woman's right to choose, but I have a way to overcome most of her concerns.
"He can't make you do that. At worst, he'd keep the baby himself. But he's a child too - unless he's a Seventh Year - he's not going to risk his future by raising a baby while still in Hogwarts," I stated.
Iss gunna be me. hang on. smy turn.
You laughed a deep belly laugh. "Morning Draco. Afternoon, whatever. Wrong River. And Viona."
Well the point of Occlumency is to choose or create specific memories to project while someone else is trying to use Legilimency on you, so yes, we could definitely practice on each other and you'd be able to focus on whichever memories you wanted me to see, and I could do the same for you. The only real problem is that a strong Legilimens could break through the Occlumency and take a good look around without permission. I'm not truly worried that you'd be able to do so since my Occlumency was strong enough to resist even my Aunt and the Dark Lord, I just thought that it would be intimate to completely open my mind and let you in, but then I remembered all those secrets I have and decided that it wouldn't be a good idea after all, but if you want to share specific memories, we can do that rather easily.
"Oh? Did you want to dance with Harry? Or Oliver?"
I will be honest and admit that I felt rather angry that you took my sunshine statement in a completely different direction than I intended it. I probably even growled at that part. But then, strangely, I couldn't help but be happy that you love me enough to be jealous.
Draco
I took my hubby to the doctor today, and when we got home, I sat down and wondered if I had posted yet, then I saw that my computer hadn't even been touched, so that answered that, lol :-)
Today, it seems a person had entered the Ministry at around noon or so - at a point when the Ministry was very busy - passed through security check in, and basically found a nice empty office to wait in until after everyone else had left. Mostly.
Several people offered to give me a blowjob, and since I'd cast a denial spell on myself, I let them. However, I didn't want to just get off and be done for the night, so I warned them about the denial spell and told them not to be disappointed that they couldn't get me off.
Gavin Mitchell Malfoy
Always and Forever Yours,
Hermione was rather soft and vulnerable looking as she smiled. "We all know NOW that he was meant for Kisa, but that doesn't mean that he never had any thoughts or feelings of his own. He was nearing his 30s when she finally was of age and able to bond with him, and for all of those years, he was searching for her without knowing it. So, when he finally realized that he'd fallen in love with us, and we were able to admit that we'd fallen pretty hard for him too, it was a REALLY momentous occasion. I don't think a single one of us thought it would actually last beyond the honeymoon phase, but we were all committed to making it work as much as possible..."
Oh Merlin Draco, they just brought our baby in for me to see her. She's so tiny. I knew how much she weighed, I knew she would be little, but nothing prepared me for how delicate she really is. I guess her lungs are doing well, she's eating quite a bit for how young she is, but she's having a bit of trouble regulating her temperature. They had me take my shirt off so I could share my body heat with her (you know how much of a furnace I am) and now we're both wrapped up in some warm blankets.
Shite! I've got to go! Ollie is trying to introduce peanut butter and bananas to our children! To our CHILDREN!!!
Side note: we need a new nickname for the trouble trio plus Atreyu. We already have a quartet so I don't want to do that. But I'm having trouble (haha, trouble) coming up with a good name for these four naughty little ones. Something about them being a foursome? Quads? The feisty foursome? The Calamity Quads? Some amalgamation of their names or initials? Clap? Atrephilum?
True blue baby I love you,
I can only assume that we BOTH orgasmed so hard that we passed out because we woke up still snuggled up in our playroom bed. It was early morning - the time of day I NEVER want to see, but Muffy and her children had handled all night feedings until our darling little demon realized that neither of us was in bed and threw an unholy strop.
And what do you mean a tiny bit not?!?!
He sat glaring at me. He was still straddling me and his hands were resting on my bare chest. Abruptly, he picked his hands up off me and crossed his arms over his chest. "God fucking damn it! WHY do I have to find the ONE fucking bloke in all of creation that DOESN'T want to shag me into the bed?!?! You know what? I'm done with this, if you're really not going to touch me, then please get the fuck out of my flat!"
My dearest Harry,
P.S. Just in case you were wondering, I left the kids in my fortified bag until the Viper himself decided that the Aurors had indeed taken every last intruder into custody and it was relatively safe for them to come out. I feel bad for them, missing all the dancing, but at least they were able to have cake, hahaha.
I would never ask you to do something dangerous while you were wearing any of the babies! We're having a meet and greet, not a triathlon! The sports we're going to have available is a little bit of football, and some Frisbees or hula hoops; muggle "sports" like that. They'll be more at risk of being overwhelmed by all of the little ones trying to pet their heads and give them kisses than to get knocked by a stray Frisbee. The almost twins are well loved by our Unity Kids.
So, I'm making a vow to you right now: I will do whatever it takes to keep myself in a healthy frame of mind. I will stop wallowing in self pity every time it seems like the walls are closing in on me and I can't breathe - and instead, I will take a literal breather and get my shit back together so that I can be more devoted to you in every way. Oh sure, we may have an elf to take care of every single one of our children, but that doesn't mean that we can just abandon them, and I feel like that's what I've been doing.
(See the end of the chapter for
A few minutes later.
But back to my point. After feeding the girls and going through our morning routine - side note, I know you know this, but whenever I have any of the kids with me, I always bring them to the bathroom when I go and give them a chance to go as well, and because of this, Viona stands while she pees. Well, Eris seems to think this is what she's supposed to do as well and is highly frustrated that she's only able to stand for a little bit and is highly wobbly while she does it. It makes it hard to go, I imagine, and I have to conjure a handle bar that she can hold onto, but I seriously have to wonder if maybe she should go to the bathroom with Elena from now on to make sure that she learns how to sit while she goes.
So of course, I spent the entire bloody day stuck in between Blaise and Kisa, trying my best not to murder them both for demanding that I choose sides in the love war between them. You know, when I first read your email suggesting that we trap them together, I thought that was rather Slytherin in its sheer brilliance, but otherwise something that I would never do to my Aunt because I like living. After about four hours, it was looking like the only option left!
Ok, it’s not sunny. We are showing up here during the rainy season. But oh well because it is still bright through the rain, the rain makes everything smell fresh and alive, and the colors will seem even more vibrant when the sun comes out after the rain.
I love you and our little water bubbles.
The thing is that I had almost NO expectation that any vision I got from her father's possessions actually COULD clear his friend. After all, even if it showed them spending time together for years, there's no way to prove WHEN the time happened compared to when the murders happened. Not unless they literally sat next to a calendar and clock that accurately gave an exact time and date for the visits. Even so, I was curious enough about what I might see that I wanted to give it a go.
November 19, 2004
As I was watching the three of them play for a few moments, the boy's father came over to me, and in rather good british/english, said: "I recognize you from the television interview this morning."
I've also told you that I was able to lock away all the 'good' emotions so that I could focus on the bad in order to actually torture people, well, now you know more about what those bad feelings were. It might actually make more sense to you how I became so cold and numb. I couldn't really stand those emotions either, so I locked them up too.
The exact same will hold true for Oliver. He will be an equal in our marriage with his own vault and I will more than likely set up a half dozen businesses in his name. In the event he divorces us - the number of years is irrelevant - he will still own his vault and his businesses. His kids will still own the vaults we set up in their names. And probably some businesses - I am me, after all.
Anyway, that's the Nora/Nana story. But I had one other thing I wanted to discuss. But probably not over email.
Oh, what in the world is wrong with me? I must still be a little overtired and out of it. I can just come wake you both up. With my mouth. Yeah, wake up my husbands!
First, I just had two quick things to say:
"Shanghai Noon, Shanghai Knights, Around the World in 80 Days, possibly Rush Hour 1 and 2 - if we're all still awake."
Draco
My Dragon,
"Well, I PLAN to use the opportunity to make a general statement of well wishes to the public on behalf of the Ministry and also promise to continue doing my best to be a good Minister. Those are both important messages that the public needs to hear, but REALLY I'm going to be putting myself out there as bait to lure out the assassin."
Ok I can't just keep sitting in my office. I am finally caught up on paperwork, there's nothing to schedule past tomorrow's adoptive movie night, and my thoughts are starting to creep back up! Tonight's the night! I will see you soon! But for now I think I am going to go start a giant game of tag in the garden and tucker myself out!
Adorable little monsters.
My Amazing Husband,
Surprisingly, you tore your lips from mine, place a finger to them, and: "Shh! Shut up and watch the show! Or, you know, join in if you like. Anything but interrupt us!"
And then teach magical dueling to the teenagers that were interested in learning. One of the things I love about this Unity House, is that each child has a unique and slightly different way of using their magic. Most of them are actually taught wandless magic, but those that do use things like wands actually use a variety of tools. Such as staves. One girl has a war fan as her 'wand,' and one boy has a glove made from cloth that had been woven with strands of hair from every member of his family.
I figured if the people are that interested in reading about my life, maybe I should tell it. So, I've actually been writing my story. I'm not sure if it's any good, it's probably rubbish, but maybe some publisher can set me up with a good editor and they can take my gibberish and make it work? I'm not sure why I hid it from you. I was a bit embarrassed when I started writing, oh, probably when we were in Canada I think, and then it just kept spiraling. Eventually I had written three or four entire novels and not told you. By that point I was hysterical about whether it would upset you if I told you I'd been hiding it from you, so I hid it still.
Tuesday October 6th
"Haz, we both needed to remind ourselves we were alive, we both had an itch to scratch, but even if I were willing to date my alternate universe godson, I think he and I are definitely much too fucked up to accomplish anything but a terribly dysfunctional relationship."
- Should they successfully have children, Alric has agreed that he understands that their children will be her heirs in the event of her death before him. (Same for him if the situation happens in reverse.)
Fine, apparently we just don’t email each other anymore. Or talk. Or do anything. I miss you, I miss Viona, I miss my bed, I miss sleeping.
Wonderful you couldn't help but wake up. You held me as I told you everything I could remember about all of the dreams. Then you slipped out of bed and got me another - stronger - sleeping potion before saying you needed to do something and leaving the room. So, I decided to purge my thoughts in an email to you before taking the potion.
And Oliver, my love, I am so bloody happy for you and us! I think I'm going to make an international floo call when I'm done here just so I can kiss you a bit. Or a lot!
We stayed inside to snog while you took Lumimyrsky out for about the billionth time today. But I think we're going to come join you for a walk with our fuzzy little "Snowstorm."
I will probably be back tonight - unless I am tired enough to fall asleep on the couch in my office when I'm done with the raid. In which case, I'll more than likely get all my paperwork done tomorrow before coming home. Please give me until tomorrow - if I actually stay the night - and then come in and shout at me for... whatever you need to shout at me for - I can think of so many things at this point, sigh...
Judging by the sound of your cry, she was right. Also, it looked like more ejaculate than normal. You must have really liked it. Now I sort of wish I'd asked for a go, but there was already a long queue waiting to go next, so I decided to forego that for the moment. Maybe I'll order you to do that to me in the safety of our playroom.
He looked over at Hermione, who also looked surprised. Which means that I knew at least one thing about you that not even your best friends knew. I'm so happy you share things with me. That said, I know it's not like you were keeping it a secret from them. It probably simply never came up in conversation. Still, I'm rather pleased. And more than a little smug. Alright, I acted a bit like a cocky bastard after that, but can you blame me?
After he was gone, I picked up Wojtek and sat on the cushy chair Muffy conjured for me. "Did I say class was over?! Get back to work!"
We missed you obviously, but we really did have a lovely day. We played on the beach, we read stories, we sang silly songs, and just spent some quality time with our tiniest. We’d get a glimpse or two of you at the other end of the beach. And I’ll admit I snuck away a time or two when I realized you were surfing. You know how hot I find it when you’re all wet and showing off.
"I must admit, I thought about that, but I don't think it's possible. Especially NOT for restricted files. That takes something else. I currently think that someone somehow obtained the security credentials from one of the Archive Witch's assistants, and used the credentials to visit the Archive after hours. The good news is that THAT would be recorded in some magical log somewhere, so we can potentially figure out WHEN it happened. The bad news is that we don't know how long ago this may have happened, and so, it could take some time to sort through all after hours visits - or find the only one if it happens to be more than a few months ago - to find out WHEN it happened, and from there, see if we can find any sort of security logs showing who was actually in the Ministry at the time."
He flinched a bit when I brought the bottle towards her, and in the sternest voice I have ever heard out of such a small person (and I am VIONA's Dad!) he said, "No hurt her!" I was so startled that I just handed him the bottle. So gently, he brought it to her mouth and held it for her while she drank.
The only problem I can see is that Mahafsoun is going to need a very intricate, erm… style... In order to not cover the gorgeous details. Funnily enough, she came to me for an objective opinion on the various styles she wants to try, and the current decision is to try them all and take pictures to decide which one looks the best.
P.S. I do think the "WARNING! SHAGGING IN PROGRESS! DO NOT DISTURB ON PAIN OF NASTY HEXES!" sign was a bit of overkill
Any way the wind blows,
Frustratedly Yours,
The drumming and dancing was just that at first, but as the sun set, Hagrid came over with enough wood to start a large bonfire and keep it fueled until around midnight. We taught a few circle dances around the fire. Every half hour or so, the five of us teaching the class would demonstrate a different dance that various groups around the world might perform during a harvest ritual. I took frequents breaks from the dancing to get drinks of both water and milk - only having had a total of one glass of wine spread out throughout the entire day. During my breaks, I'd join the drumming.
But, I look like a mum! I want to look like a man. Nothing against women but I’m not one. I just. I’m so short and I want to look masculine! Except when I want to look feminine. I’m so confused. You don’t want me to keep my hair long because you secretly wish you’d married a woman after all and this is your next best option right?
"That sounds fun too," she hummed in thought, probably now planning out treating her husbands and wife to the next Torture Garden party. This made her unconsciously start squirming on my lap again, which pulled another groan from me. I kissed her because I was going to tell her goodbye, but she mistook the kiss for me starting something light and playful, and returned the kiss hungrily.
There's a place I know if you're looking for a show, where they go hardcore and there's glitter on the floor, and they turn me on when they take it off, everybody take it off!
I have never met a single person who didn’t meet Shtara and fall instantly for her. She has one of those personalities that someone puts people immediately at ease. That make them feel loved and welcomed and heard. She has an intensity when she talks to you, making you feel as though that moment with you is her number one priority.
And I'm sure he'd be happy to be financially independent and not rely on our generosity. He and his children are welcome to stay with us forever if they'd like, but also, it would be better for my own mental health if we didn't live in the same house. He's really growing on me, I swear. I wasn't just blowing smoke when I told everyone during the family meeting that he and his children are our family, but I don't need to live with everyone in my extended family either!
"Hermione, do you really think I would want to get rid of you? Or that I am that calculating? I knew they were looking to open up a Traditions since they tried to get me to head it up." At that point 'Mione looked like she was going to argue but I quickly pushed on, "My family needs this year to regroup emotionally, there is no way I was going to take it, I didn't even let them get to the point of making me an offer." That's when I started the giggling, "and it's not like I am in any way responsible for Traditions here! I told them that all I did was come up with the idea and hire you as Headmistress."
We survived! We've had Hazel and Pearl's wedding and come out alive on the other side! No Draco, you are not the worst Dad ever. Our sweet girl was in fine form and pushed us all to our limits. Thankfully that is over and we will never have to plan another wedding for or with her! There will be some stress in the upcoming weeks, I'm sure, while their new home is being built, but we will be in Iran and thankfully will miss the entirety of that process.
Della Andromeda Malfoy
Harry is *not* allowed to cut his hair!
And honestly Draco, even if that's what you were going for, am I really the person who is going to think less of you for wanting to be petted and told you're a good boy? Do you think less of me for wanting to be so good for you?
I shook my head. "Not upset at all. It may sound insane to someone who prefers a fully committed and monogamous relationship, but Harry and I have always been willing to explore every aspect of our kinks, and one of mine happens to be seeing him with others. I can't explain it, but seeing him in the throes of passion, and having the space to simply WATCH every tiny flicker of emotion on his face, it drives me wild with passion! It's..."
You may hate being woken up but I think our date last night with massages, yummy food, and beach shagging followed by falling asleep to the sunrise over our idyllic beach was enough good to have you feeling pretty wonderful when you awoke. Not to mention our children are gorgeous and wonderful. Anyone would be lucky to wake up to their faces. Although the creepy hovering and leering was probably not quite as wonderful as I'm making it sound!
Harry
P.P.S. Do NOT read previous P.S. as me saying yes to more babies. We're all full at the Inn!
Harry! I just had a brilliant idea! Okay, so you know how wands work, right? They're made up of magical ingredients that have properties that are useful in spellwork. They *are* a magical object that in the hands of the witch or wizard they choose, can do pretty much anything there's a spell for. *BUT* what if there was a *different* sort of wand - hell! It doesn't have to be a wand! Remember how Portkeys can be anything?
"Alright," Tiger agreed with a sigh that suggested he didn't believe for a second that it would take his mind off everything, but that wasn't actually the part that I had in mind.
I took a deep breath and sighed. "It's not that. I'm not traumatized by the conception. I *am* a little appalled that I wouldn't even begin to know which customer is the father, but I don't feel like I can't raise that baby. I... I just REALLY don't want to be having any more babies at all. I figured if I aborted them *all* you would be upset and potentially forever mad at me for getting rid of a child of YOURS."
Life is a mystery, everyone must stand alone, I hear you call my name, and it feels like... home,
But best of all was when I decided it was time to let you have your well deserved orgasm and milked it from you before untying you and carrying you to bed. You were already passed out, snuggled into my arms like a sleeping child. I know you always say that you are tiny like a child, but I don't feel that way. I simply feel that you are a short but otherwise well built man. That said, I do love being able to manhandle you and carry you around as needed.
But moving on since most of that will depend on future events.
"I thought you said we were going to go say goodbye and leave. NOW who's taking forever?!"
Well anyway, I'm sure you can guess by now what the potion was that Miles took. Being a Hufflepuff, Miles wasn't quite sure how to refuse the dare, and was extremely relieved when seemingly nothing happened except that he felt a bit queasy for a while.
The holding off on starting a new business will also apply to me, aside from that meeting with Kingsley that Pippa managed to snag an appointment for on Monday. Afternoon.
Saturday March 24, 2018
"And I have a degenerative disease. I think you probably already knew this as you were the one who noticed something wrong and urged me to go to the doctor."
Zaire spills the news.
Tuesday October 9th
Anyway, back to what I was saying, our gorgeous new baby - at only four months old - is such a joy and clearly so very happy to be alive that she doesn't want to sleep and waste a moment, haha. Every night when I wake up to feed her (and the weird thing as that she doesn't cry, so I have NO IDEA how I know to wake up), she spends a good two hours just staring at me, even after she's drank her bottle. She holds my finger in her tiny hand and blows bubbles and 'sings' in her own infant way. I feel blessed just to hold her!
You nodded and practically vaulted yourself onto the bed. I decided to take that as a good sign. As you were scrambling across the covers I vanished what little you were wearing, which wasn't much since you had just been belly dancing.
Once again, this song wasn't the best one to dance to, but I was able to stroke myself rather suggestively from time to time, and I think that the audience liked the song a WHOLE lot more than the owner, hahahahaha!
I was completely unwilling to wake either of you, as much as I want to talk with you and see those quicksilver and molten chocolate eyes I've missed so much, I'm sure the both of you are in dire need of good sleep too. So, as soon as I awoke, I shot one of those bloody uncomfortable bladder spells at myself, sat up as best I could without moving either of you very far from your perch (you're heads are now resting in my lap instead of my chest), and summoned my tablet so I could write to you.
I love the idea of our children having house elf children as friends! What I don't understand is how a child can grow up with a house elf as a playmate and then go on to mistreat house elves! I know OUR children won't, but it's not like it's an uncommon occurrence.
But as I was saying, because she wants this to be an event between the three 'local' magic communities, she needs a person with keen business acumen to pitch the idea to the Russians - as they will likely be harder to persuade - and if they get on board, I should be home in plenty of time to celebrate Valentine's day with you two before heading off to France to persuade their Magi-Government.
Hermione led me to a fairly big meeting consisting of all the department heads. She kept a hold on Nicolas as she conducted the meeting, Morgana sat on her lap and scribbled happily on some parchment. She was even happy enough to hum/sing to herself as she worked.
Tuesday at 11:13 PM
Here I am, sitting behind the desk in the Head Auror's office, thinking over my options. Last night was so wonderful in that - after I got out of the shower - you were both able to get me out of my head long enough for me to fall asleep and have a good night. But when I woke up - at the bloody crack of dawn, probably mere minutes after Harry slipped out of bed for his morning run - I had a distinct feeling of panic that the whole bloody world would fall apart if I didn't get my arse into the office as soon as possible.
"Why is mumdad underwater with his head in your lap?" Siri added.
The thing is, she's had a crush on a particular girl for almost her entire life. She's had other random crushes since then, Natalie being one of them, but there's always been that one unattainable perfect girl for our Hazel. She never told me who it was, and I just assumed it was someone at school but it was too important to Hazel and she didn't want to mess it up by telling me.
My love!

In non-chronological order; Zaire and I did come up with a good course outline for the African Tribal dance class. Yes, we're going to branch out to other cultures since it could potentially get a little monotonous doing just the same few dances after a while. Elena loves the entire thing and is planning to personally speak to the parents of any student interested in taking the class to explain the cultural differences the students will be learning and why they are important to learn.
"With how poorly the babies are doing, and how stressed Draco's body is doing, I fully believe that the best chance for all of them is to move both of the smaller ones over to Harry. At this point, his magic is still at full strength, and he's in perfect health. I really feel that it will be best all around if we move the two smallest to him and give them a chance to recover and thrive before they are too big to fit inside him and we have to either find ANOTHER home for one of them, or deliver early," Rowe said, as close to rambling as I've ever heard her.
Draco's feeling just a tiny bit better.
At the same time, I looked through my notebook of ideas and realized that we wanted a parchment that could store a vast amount of books for easy carrying. Well, this proved to be a bit more difficult, but I adore a good challenge, so I tried a few different things until I had something... workable, I suppose. The problem is that without some super complex magic, it *can't* add and delete things at will (and honestly, computers *can* do that, so this would be a bit redundant), BUT I can load up as much as I want in the initial spell casting, and that will be easily accessible to the user.
Harry receives an interesting email .
The not playing at all for years was the fact that I think finally calmed him down. Knowing that because we made our relationship a priority while overcoming a rough time in our marriage, we made the decision to keep sex within our relationship, and were completely content and still in love throughout the entire time. I think he was terrified that if he told us NOT playing was a requirement for him (at least at first), that we'd stop loving him or stop wanting to be with him.
So, I was holding Arietty and looking through all the photos Julia brought over with you, and suddenly, I started feeling like I was in a room in which the walls were closing in on me. I could see that woman I killed as if she was lying on the floor at my feet. I couldn't quite breathe and I didn't know what to do.
Wednesday October 21st
That would be an easy, 100% answer if Hoogervorst wasn't going to spend years in Azkaban (seriously, I guess the altered polyjuice was one of his nicer black market potions he was selling!). But it's my life, so why would it be easy? My choices are, make his father his full father, both he and Gorman are going to be stripped of their rights, and Harrison stays at Unity until he's adopted by someone else. Or, we make him fully "mine" and he comes home with us. I want there to be an easy or right answer. How the hell do we make this decision?
(See the end of the chapter for
Ooh! Timer just went off, looks like quiet time is over. Time for me to get to know my new Kids.
Over in the corner, my Auror friend and his wife were in a sandwich with Derek where she was in the middle, looking rather amazed. Yes, things were moving along nicely now.
Oh Merlin, he wasn't talking about my defeat of Voldemort, our daughter managed to find Unity Royalty at that party!
Yeah, I started freaking out. I couldn't help it. Logically I KNEW it was just the Viper, but, erm… viscerally, I could only see Nagini eating poor Charity Burbage. I started trying to scramble away and was shouting something like:
Not fucking likely. I may not think I'm worthy of the pure love given to me, I may spend most of my days wondering at my luck in these two men thinking I'm worth being married to, but I sure as hell aren't going to give it up any time soon.
"Remember when I asked and you agreed - or did I actually challenge you? Hmm, either way, you gave me permission to set up a line of men that *you* would give blow jobs to and then without being able to see anything, tell me which one was me. So that's what we're doing. I have here with me all our friends - well, mostly. Pansy and Ivan are in Russia. We're going to form a line and you have to give each of us a blowjob that lasts at least five minutes - or until he shoots his load down your throat; whichever happens first. When you've finished blowing *everyone* then you have to tell me which one was me."
Apparently for months, possibly a full year, definitely since Ollie got pregnant with Serenity, Ron has had a terrible case of baby fever. Aleksei as their youngest is only a little over two years old, you would think the baby fever wouldn't be so bad. But I think the fact that he knows both Hermione and Kisa have said "never again" have made him realize they'll never have another baby.
Kids! Yes, inexplicable child drawn art is... erm, fascinating... You sound like you want to be a stay at home mother (father, whatever) with an enormous amount of kids. Thankfully, you're also directing that rather alarming urge toward taking care of orphans. I applaud the initiative, and have to wonder how you'd look holding a baby. Wait, I have to stop thinking about that, I don't have time for -nevermind!
Most days I am completely thankful for magic, it's amazing, but during the toilet fiasco I was definitely wishing accidental magic from toddlers who don't want to potty train was not real! I'm a little worried about when our brilliant but stubborn Viona gets to be old enough to potty train.
Saturday September 10th
Even in our darkest moments, I have never been unsure of my unending love for you. It sounds like I will probably have to spend the next century telling you over and over again that you will never lose me. Never. I'm all in. We have weathered bigger problems than this, I believe in us. And if you don't believe in my love enough, that's fine I'll believe enough for both of us.
I nudged her in the rib with my elbow. "You only think that's practically lazy because you run an entire school on top of teaching individual classes and probably work *80* hours a week."
I was a bit rankled by this point, and was mentally gearing up to go give them all a steaming pile of hell, but a quiet voice stopped me from moving.
"Oh..." I hummed, trying to remember. You're probably right.
Those taste like pecan and fig pasties...
I scoffed at him without even turning away from the mirror. "Of course! Nothing but the best for me!"
And then you came home, perfectly safe, and rumpled. Looking so handsome, but not looking like mine. And after all of that you still tried to evade talking with me. You tried to sleep on it so you could come up with some story that would be partial truths to keep me from being mad. Not to save me pain, but to save yourself from my anger. You rambled through an email, trying to distract me from wanting to know what happened to my husband. I think my favorite part was where, even if only for a moment, you contemplated letting me take all of our children away so you wouldn't have to tell me what had happened.
Girly smirked at me. "You are always such a hardarse with us, and we've seen a couple of your daughters come in and wipe the floor with us, so I think we all assumed that you must be a complete bastard to your kids, but you're really a big ol' softie at heart, aren't you?"
Delphini Lestrange Riddle Potter
Wednesday September 9th
The only real negative to the entire day was how Atreyu almost didn't get the one thing for his party that he wanted. After games and cake and food and gifts we were all sitting around groaning and loosening our belt buckles, but I could tell he was antsy for something. I called him over and asked him "So what did you think of your birthday party little buddy?"
Greg Goyle and Millicent Bulstrode
Oh Amsterdam!
She squinted at me again. "I thought you said you were married to that bloke, which would imply that you're gay. Why the hell do you want to take ME???"
Not really no one there, Ollie and all the babies and littles were home, but sound asleep. I may not have gotten hugs hello, kisses, and squealing babies, but I did get to see my beautiful family, soft in sleep, all cuddled up together!
Because of Nora's love of all things Madeline and Parisian in general, we've been planning for an elaborate party highlighting those two things. We created a faux Parisian street, complete with fully functioning patisserie. Zaire had even planned out an entire 'menu' for this faux bakery. Greg had even made a huge (but smaller than the real thing obviously) recreation of the Eiffel Tower. We had already made little hat party favors, and Grandma Molly hadn't officially started the cake but she had created the blueprint design for it.
"Good morning," I returned with a smile.
I suppose I don't need to go on and on and recite every single word from one of my patented Harry Lectures, but the gist of the talk was, "I like you without all of the sexy stuff, other people will too, you just have to give them the chance to see the rest of you."
You'd think I had woken up in the middle of the night because I'm feeling well rested and finally have a bit of energy. Nope, I feel so awful that my body literally won't let me fall asleep even though I'm exhausted. So, I've been trying to distract myself since I've been awake. When you were here earlier, I obviously hadn't read your most recent email, so I didn't think to ask about Kisa or Hermione's babies. And I certainly wasn't going to message you at five to ask you. So I took the chance that at 8:00, Hermione would be awake with her newborn anyway and messaged her to see if she was up for a Magi-Skype session.
Who am I trying to kid? You ate his breakfast creations this morning; thrilled it is! He decided to do an altered version of french toast. Stuffed French Toast. But what were we going to stuff it with? That was going to be tailored to each individual person. We had a lot of cheesecake stuffed french toast options; strawberry cheesecake, blueberry cheesecake, cherry cheesecake. Some with a cinnamon oatmeal mixture, coconut cream, Nutella, apple pie filling, we even did a peanut butter and jelly stuffed french toast for our little Caelum who has decided PBJ variations are the only thing he's willing to eat right now.
Birthday April 9, 2000
FUCK! Now I'm horny again! And you're STILL nowhere to be found! You must be hiding in our closet.
"The rest of us are going to go in with our wands drawn, stunning EVERYONE we can to end the situation as quickly as possible. Stunning spells only unless you absolutely HAVE to cast something stronger out of self defense or defense of others," I ordered, probably unnecessarily since this was more or less the standard operating procedure.
You kissed me and even your breathing seemed calmer. "I love you too. I promise, I'll call Rowe and return to your side without doing anything stupid."
The Viper laughed – literally threw his head back, held his sides, and bellowed laughter so hard that he quickly had tears pouring from his eyes. “That's. How. I. Felt!”
Orion chuckled and gave me a hug. "I dunno, you seem to be doing much better than you did when River was my age. Back then, you freaked out about EVERYTHING."
"It's not, it's just alarming to us as parents because we think you're too young to have those sorts of feelings, but clearly, you're not." I harrumphed a laugh. "But no matter WHAT you think, you are definitely TOO YOUNG to help her raise her baby as a co-parent. Be the baby's fun uncle if you want, but that's it."
"She was just a scared baby..." Hannah murmured.
"ALL MY FRENS ARE HE-THENS TAKE IT SLOW, WAIT FOR THEM TO AX YOU WHO YA KNOW!"
I kissed you tenderly. "I'll be in the command tent for the most part - using all the Magi-Tech I've created over the years to ensure that everything runs as smoothly as possible."
The Halloween party at Unity house was adorable. A bunch of kids in highly creative costumes is strangely my cup of tea. Or perhaps not so strangely, hahaha!
Harry
I waited to go to his rooms until around noon, he has long nights and wants to sleep in when all he’s doing is running the bar, the nights he performs he sleeps in even longer, add his uncomfortable conversation with Farrah and I’m sure he needed a lot of extra rest.
My strength,
Hold me now, it's hard for me to say I'm sorry - After all that we've been through, I will make it up to you, I promise to,
Now I am sitting in the sun room, quite sad that I can't be sunning myself in the garden, but I suppose this beautiful room, full of plants and calm colors, and the morning light streaming in the huge windows will have to do. Viona and Della are playing quite sweetly, so I decided to settle in and write you back finally after your miniature novels from the last few days!
"ANOTHER waistcoat???"
We also all had a good laugh about the ironic timing of their letter which was sent BEFORE the prophet photo and yet we received after the fact.
He was biting his lip again. Slowly, he nodded in agreement. "Alright..." It still took him a moment to gather up his courage - and down his drink - before he stood up and marched over to her.
Harry
And while I have utmost faith in our Draco coming back to us, even if he never regains his memories I am crafty enough that I will just make him fall in love with us all over again. Oliver, you and I managed to make him fall in love with us once, we can do it again!
Draco
We've been so busy shopping for Christmas that it's been WEEKS since I last had a chance to email you. Thankfully, we have absolutely NOTHING planned for tomorrow, and so, we'll get to just stay at home and snuggle up together as a married trio. And play with the littles. They're in the best stage ever! They're old enough to want to play things like tag and hide and seek, but still small enough that they take naps to give us a break.
Harry
BUT the good news is that he was doing a fire dance, and the only reason that he didn't just strip off completely was because they make more money on Fridays if they resist the temptation to show nudity on the other days. Which he actually told me during Viona's Hen Party.
Draco
All of that was more or less normal, as was the fact that we sipped on smoothies as the day progressed. Eventually, Elena relaxed enough that she no longer seemed like a bow ready to shoot an arrow. THAT'S when River started in on her.
I think the reason I give in to Viona while you're able to know when her demands are ridiculous, and why I'm able to keep a hold of some of Elena's more outrageous demands while you buy her entire music stores worth of instruments, is because of which of us is whose main caregiver. I spend more time with Elena, I spend breakfast with her, I drop her off at school, I pick her up from school, and before she came to our house I was with her at Unity most days. So I know her little quirks and I know when she legitimately wants or needs something versus when she's trying to manipulate the situation to get what she wants. She's quite brilliant and knows how to get what she wants! Whereas with Viona, you are with her every day, you know what she's capable of. I think she's just a pure innocent little baby who is too tiny to know what she's doing. While you realize she's a teeny tiny Slytherin, who is barely a year old, basically potty trained, can count to at least four, and knows exactly how to work her naïve Mumda!
The surgeon laughed. "Wouldn't help, you'd need the ability to DO magic in order to use it!"
Harry snorted a laugh. “No! Although, apparently Other Draco is the genius behind a magic muggle hybrid tech business. He is the one who developed the Magimobile over the years. Plus he owns or invests in so many OTHER businesses around the world, that he literally offered to just GIVE me one so I could support myself and my kids if I wanted. When we were all in Hawaii recently, he came across a Macadamia farm he wanted to invest in, and then agreed to let Orion market and sell them under the brand name of Orion's Belt. Meanwhile, Viona – who is basically Other Draco's right hand when it comes to running and keeping tabs on all his businesses (in addition to Pippa) – Eris and Hazel got a bit irate because they felt he was being sexist and discriminating against them. So he gave them the thumbs up to start up their own business too. A fashion label.”
"No! LEMME GO! I hafta make 'im see!"
"Well, it was rather boring, for the most part. There was a lot of waiting involved," I explained. "We gathered in the incident room around 4 AM in order to gear up and go over the plan, but then - once we'd Apparated to the designated point and got into position - we had to wait a few hours for the leaders of the ring to arrive and everything to be *just right.* I actually had to drink some of your vile coffee to stay awake while we waited."
If you die on me, I will murder you!
Let me try that again. I'm so sorry to have sent a confusing email that more than likely alarmed you. The important part is that I am NOT hurt in any way.
She busted out the entire song, but I thought my heart would just break when she practically sobbed out, "I'm burning the memories, burning the letters, that might have redeeeeeemed you. You FORFEIT all rights to my heart! You forfeit the place in our bed, You'll SLEEP in your office instead. With only the memories of when you were Miiiiinnnneeee! I hope that you .... burrrrrrnnnnn!"
"Last I heard, she was making plans to be in the girls' dorm finalizing costumes."
I have most definitely been enjoying our time as a couple, our time with the kids, our dancing or running times, and certainly enjoying our visits to the playroom. Again, I know I'm not where I need to be, but I am already feeling so much better than I was even just a few days ago.
Today was rather rough. You were there, so I feel a little bad for bringing it up again, but I wanted to clear my mind, and so here goes:
And I want to thank you, for giving me the best day of my life, oh just to be with you, is the best day of my life,
I adjusted the wrap so that he could see her face, and she was giving him a look that I'd swear was suspicious - if babies could have such looks at a week of age.
Brock tried to pull me in his arms. "Maybe we should just go to bed and sleep on it."
August 26, 2002
-	Godparents Kisa and Sebastian
Insta-Owl from Kisa:
Ave Maria, please will you keep me from the misery, madness, and fools who rule this evil world,
Happy Halloween everyone! ^_^
"I knew you'd be needed," you whispered in my ear before kissing me.
"The lunatic is slightly taller than average, medium build, with blond hair and blue eyes. Desperate is a bit taller but also huskier. He has brunet hair and light brown eyes and is panting rather heavily from trying to run away as he casts shields. They're... in a random field with nothing that seems like identifying marks. Desperate grabs anything he can to chuck at lunatic, and lunatic occasionally catches desperate, causing a brutal scuffle that is clearly NOT trained in any sort of combat skill. Lunatic grabs desperate's hair and punches him in the temple, and desperate has managed to grab hold of a large rock and bash it over lunatic's head - and now he's running again.
Yeah, that's what I am going to do. See you before you read this probably.
Well, you and Viona were tuckered out after the movie and went right to sleep, but Elena had a bit of homework to do, so I've been writing while she's been working. But she's packing up now, so I am going to read her a story and tuck her in, then I will be in bed.
"I'm happy with that!" I agreed.
"Actually, I was wondering if you'd come see me when I play?" Jules asked. "And also, I'm probably going to need a Portkey after dinner tonight. I want to go drop off my presents for my parents so that I can be HERE on Christmas."
There will be a trigger warning on the next chapter.
Well...
Neville let out a long-suffering sigh, and then nodded. "Actually, I'd like that too. I always feel like a bit of a freak when we... do the things we like to do."
I'm still sort of hoping for Reina Del Dragón. Reina for short? Or Sagittarius Aquarius? Daffodil Libra? Gabby?
Sigh... I suppose that another part of the underlying problem is that it is almost impossible for me to explain what it is I want and need in a way that you can both understand without it just sounding like: "I want and need this because I am a selfish bastard and was also raised to believe that I am entitled by my very birth to always have every single thing I want."
I'm sorry I'm being so needy. I just miss you so much. I know we've been separated many times over the years but it's been a while and I've been very spoiled with having you home all the time. I probably get this way every time we have babies getting closer to a year or so old. When they're infants you are so adamant about never leaving them for a single moment. Sometimes to the point where I feel as though I need to beg just to get a dinner alone with you. Not that I am complaining, it's important for me that we're both hands on and present in their lives. But I get used to you being within arms' reach for all those months of pregnancies and then infancy and when you start branching out I want to throw a tantrum.
Oh, Muffy just popped in to tell me that she's using one of the other owls to send that care package you made up for Viona of homemade biscuits and little squares of dark chocolate with caramel, pecans, and sea salt (Viona's favorite) that you magically stamped with hearts encircling her nickname.
"Yeah," he confirmed with a soft smile and another kiss. "And the two of you were ALWAYS patient and willing to keep things at my comfort level. Can you IMAGINE what a difference that could make to someone who knows they are different but hasn't figured out why yet? To have a safe place to go to learn and people who can be trusted to push their limits without breaking them? It's... empowering..."
That’s when we apparated to the Shard. We got there a bit early and decided to reserve two rooms for the night. Either way we were going to stay seeing as we weren’t allowed to pick up our children tomorrow anyway. And you thought it would be a nice gesture to Neville and Charlie to have a separate room ready for them. This way they could have as much fun as they wanted, not have to worry about apparating home drunk, and not feel pressured into doing anything with us as if we had done a suite of rooms.
"But you don't think that's what happened?" I stated more than asked.
You just left for your meeting. And then you're going straight from the meeting to your class. It sucks, Wednesdays are hard enough missing you in the evening and at Movie Night but then you had to schedule business for today too? Boo!
"So, if that's true, then why do you say that you're not gay?" I wondered.
You're really going to make me do this, aren't you? You bastard!
OK so I love and adore you. I love you more than anything else in the world. You are my life. I am trying to figure out how to word this next thing without it coming out wrong.
Harry,
For what it's worth, I may not have learned about her piano skills yet, but I HAVE talked to her. I've genuinely wanted to get to know her interests, and guess what? She loves to dance. And sing. And as shallow as it might sound, but she also has a passion for makeup. And vampires, but hey, we can't ALL be normal.
Now that I've dropped her back off to her dads and sibling, I decided to swing over to Cafe Exquis and come home bearing gifts for the wedding crew. I may have been willing to skip one day of panic, but I'm not heartless!
The scene changed again. Now Necklace looked about a decade or so older than he had been in the last scene. He was looking at himself in a mirror and had a sad aura to an otherwise calm demeanor. After a few minutes, he left the room and walked several blocks - or maybe even kilometers, it's hard to tell since the vision sped up at that point until he arrived at his destination.
P.P.P.P.S. Really do whatever you want, I won't be mad, but I will be exceedingly turned off by the whole thing.
"Better not take any longer than two weeks, because at that point, I expect you to give up and come home," Robards commanded sternly.
"So work less hours," I suggested. "I'm not saying quit, simply sort through all of your cases and prioritize them. Unless a case is BOTH important AND makes you happy or fulfills you in some way, let it go until you've had the baby and are ready to work more hours again. And even then, I bet you'll have a healthier concept of the cases you should be working and the ones you should pass along to others. In fact, you're a Malfoy. Why in the bloody hell haven't you hired a fuckload of employees to ensure that all the cases you want worked get worked, just not necessarily by you?"
You hurt your son, you hurt your daughter, you hurt and worried your husbands, all for what? Because some adult toddlers decided to play power games? There wasn't a single other person who could be counted on to help support Kisa in her ability to take care of her own organization? Well then she's not that great of a fucking leader is she?
Instead I'm going to focus on the fun aspects of our magical quarantine! Live in paradise forever as our solution to keeping well away from highly magical areas? Yes please!
Actually, can you make it a trip with three? I think Ollie could use a day of distraction. Don't worry, I already read the lay of the land with Jaz, subtly bringing up Ollie's lack of classes this afternoon. She immediately brightened and asked if he was going to join in her birthday celebration. I said I wasn't sure and she got that mischief look on her face and signed "I can talk him into it." So don't worry about making her feel badly by not having it be "just" the two of you.
Tuesday August 31st
So, er, heh heh... well, erm... You see... What happened was... well... I never actually was on probation. Part of the agreement when all charges were dropped was that I had to see a mind healer for at least three visits. Which I did. I'm not really one to tell personal things to complete strangers, so I never truly made use of her in the way intended and stopped seeing her the first moment I could. That said, she *did* suggest that I try writing to everyone I've ever wronged and apologize. I dismissed the advice at first, but then I sort of dwelt on it. So, I made up an acceptable excuse for why I *had* to send out apologies. Layering on all of my best defenses, I *braved* the potential humiliation from the back of my closet.
But now I'm awake for a night feeding. It's my turn so I'm leaving you to sleep. Persephone was fussing quite loudly, so I took her into the sitting room of our suite and am currently rocking her in front of the fire as she nurses herself back to sleep. And typing this one handed.
Draco glared at him lightly. “Well I don't.”
"And?" I asked, a bit confused as to where he was going with this.
Viona is having a lovely day playing at Unity House and Luna said not to worry a bit about her and to just go.
That tank tour thing was unexpectedly fascinating. I really thought we'd be better off staying in our cabin and just snuggling up in bed, but nope! SO worth it!
As I said, pure heaven!
Mmm... sassy Harry...
Harry
Friday July 7th
And it's probably a good thing he's so hands on because Lainie's three loves have their hands full with her. She's spent the entire day resting on the sofa. Why you ask? Because the last few days she's been telling them she's taking a nap and then apparating to the site of Unity Spain and working instead. She's been pushing herself and when they caught her and dragged her to her Healer, she was instructed to take it easy. Then the Healer told Ethan, Rose, and Rodrigo to watch her like a hawk and insist she not lift a finger unless it's to cuddle her new baby.
Harry
Harry threatens Robards, and Draco has a movie marathon with a couple of his boys.
Bones: "Bringing life and warmth with it,"
-Haz: "No, Eris would be in Slytherin. She and I are a team, I will most definitely be Slytherin, she'll go there too."
Of course in that case, we could actually use it for Unity France staff in the future if or when they decide to move on to Spain or anywhere else our little world traveler decides to drag them off to!
I had taken all of the early risers with me to get a feel for the layout and hopefully show the big girls how to get to our tent if we were separated, and while wandering we came across the Greenpeace stage where they were starting the day out with yoga. Lainie and Kisa wanted to join in, and I did what I could with the babies strapped to me. But as yoga was finishing, they announced that the next thing scheduled on that stage was the Kids' Dance Music Workshop. So we hustled back to the tent so they could change out of their sweaty yoga clothes and see if you and Viona were ready to join us for the day.
"Oh! There you are! I was looking for you. Want me to take her?" I asked as if I had no idea that he was about to hand her off to Muffy anyway.
Hi all! I just wanted to point out that this chapter STARTS with Draco's email because this was written during the week that Chrissie went on vacation. The plan was for me to keep writing emails while she was gone, but aside from the first day or so, she managed to send tiny replies. After she came back, she wrote two in a row to fix the ordering, but for the next week of posts, it'll be backwards, lol ^_^
But you seemed more like this was my pet project. Like how I act when you take on a new pet, I will care for them and I'm glad you're spreading out your care and love, but I certainly wouldn't have adopted Amala or Wojtek for myself. And I don't want US to take on parenting for a child where I'm the only one who feels like his parent. We have always been a team. Even when one of our children comes to us because they are biologically connected to only one of us, or when we meet a child where one of us falls hard and fast but the other didn't feel it immediately, we've always done this TOGETHER.
As I understand it, you're staying home with the boys. Or perhaps taking them shopping too. In any case, I have Jaz and you have Zaire, but I'd be willing to switch if you need me to. Love you!
So, I decided to keep up the blood potions. So far all of my symptoms have been around for three or four days, and besides the dehydration, they've been more or less annoying as opposed to dangerous. Last night the sweating and the peeing seem to have disappeared and today's symptom is again just annoying so that's left me pretty hopeful. I can't stop crying. And not emotionally where I can't stop crying because I'm sad, my eyes are literally leaking. Super weird and annoying, but definitely something I can handle.
Why move here when Greece is a lovely place to live? Was it simply a better job offer? Family in the country? The lovely weather? (I nearly split a gut over that thought!)
I know you already know what happened, but I thought you might like a little backstory as to how everything came about.
"Ok, that's it! You already told him that, he raced out to panic and hide from Narcissa. Haz, you look weird, sorry but you do. Della, you're never this forgetful. Harry, I thought you got a new tattoo but now it's gone, is it hiding? What is happening!?!" If he had any hair, I am sure Kingsley would have been yanking it out.
Love of my life,
My naughty Harry and Oliver,
*A few minutes pass as Draco succumbs to his tears*
My Dragon!
She said she had two appointments scheduled today, but that she'd be more than happy to come over after - so in roughly two hours. I'm telling Pippa to come get me about a half hour before she arrives so that I can get proper dressed (but not fully dressed UP like I would if we were going somewhere), but until then, I'm going to be in the crystal room destroying things.
"Aww! She's so cute!" The same younger sister purred. The rest of the family wanted to shake your hand. Donna apologized but explained that she'd sat us with her family because she thought we'd be more comfortable sitting with people who'd be happy to talk to us rather than with people who had been told the worst things about you while you were growing up.
Hi Loves, sorry I'm not going to be home before bed. Erma's having a bit of a crisis and I'm going to stay here talking to her until she works through it. I may actually spend the night. Don't worry, I have Rita with me and am still attending to all her needs, and I'll also take Serenity if she won't go to sleep for either of you - just have Dibly bring her to me here. Or you could put a dab of 'lotion' on her, haha. Forever, Draco
I have no idea how to fix this. Seriously, I feel as though I haven't slept in days, all I do is sit awake, stare at his (and yours) beautiful face, and try to figure out a solution. Right now my only idea is to bash him over the head in the hopes of knocking loose whatever got knocked in the first place! And while my frustration level kind of wants to hit something over the head with a frying pan, I think adding trauma to his already traumatized brain might be counterproductive.
Orion held up a finger to basically tell her to shut up and wait for him to think for a moment. He still looked ready to hex her, and since he is OUR son, he was probably fighting a bit of a rage halo of his own. After a few deep breaths, he responded.
It's a chinchilla!
I laughed and hugged them both. "I wasn't saying I expect it for free, just that I find it supremely unfair that HE gets to throw you a massive party, and ***I*** have to pay for it. He should chip in part of the expenses as your wedding present."
I can barely function on my own. I mean, all day my back and my belly have been achy. Then when Dibly apparated us here I think I pulled something because now my back and my belly hurt even more. My panic is making me light headed. I should probably have Healer Rowe look me over in case I hurt myself.
"Um, no, I just got here, you saw me walk through the doors. Feeling alright there mate?" The Viper might make me want to strangle him for shagging my Godfather and kissing my Husband, but he's not a bad actor.
"I didn't mean it! You KNOW how big a deal kisses are to me, I wouldn't have done it if I'd known!" You assured him, and this seemed to pacify him as he softened and kissed you.
I held up my hands to attract both your attentions. "So, these are the ground rules/expectations. *I* can get the beating I want, Viper can brutalize me to his heart's content, Harry will stop things when they reach the point he just can't take it anymore, and then they'll probably give me an excellent show of Viper topping Harry. Meanwhile, Oliver and his other self will be on the bed exploring all the things they want to try. If at any point, any single one of us wants to put a stop to things, we ALL agree to abide by it and stop, yeah?"
Bianca Evangeline Weasley
"I love Parker and Cassie with all of my heart. But adoption wasn't our first choice. Edmond and I tried to have biological children first; as you know now, his parents were really pushing for biological heirs." I felt the usual rush of anger whenever his former in-laws come up but kept quiet so he would keep talking. "He never blamed me, even when the dementia took his personality, but I blamed myself. Perhaps I wasn't powerful enough magically, maybe I spent too many years with a broom between my legs and I had damaged my bollocks. Was it because of all those fad diets I put myself through to stay in top quidditch condition?
I also want to do whatever fun thing you were going to have us do! Seriously! Tell me tell me tell me!!
Here's how it happened as best I can remember:
Both Harrys turned to look at him in confusion.
"Did you try apologizing?" Gavin and Eliza asked.
First though, I noticed our stash of milk was looking a little low, so I decided to pump a bit before I left - so that's what I've been doing; pumping and typing. But I'm just about done, so expect this email notification and a crack announcing my arrival to happen pretty much simultaneously.
I think that there might have been a massacre if Draco hadn't intervened. After all, Vanessa all on her own, well, you know. Add in two other witches and a wizard and it wouldn't have been a fair fight at all. That said, Draco, well... he's not exactly a calm man when it comes to his kids needing to defend themselves from genuine danger. So, he, erm... went on a bit of a rampage.
P.S. Ok, sure, we have been married for ten years, but it's not like we lived here those entire ten years! It's a massive estate, don't you tease me about the practically invisible hunting lodge!
See you soon,
"You're just happy that whatever this is, it's NOT being brought to you!" I accused her in amusement.
Love,
As usual, Viona was the best looking baby in the world. She was passed around quite a bit as everyone wanted to read her shirt and then nod over how true it was. Because it's *so* true!
I decided to let him think I believed him.
That's when you just so happened to pop back outside a moment. "Bloody hell, Draco! These stuffed mushrooms are to DIE for! Whattaya think? Should I ask for the recipe?"
But that isn't the case for my Draco. I really thought hard about what kind of date to give my Draco on our special day. We've had so many special days over the years. Do I go big and posh and fancy for my spoiled prat of a husband? Do I just ignore the idea of a date at all and drag him to the playroom for sexy shenanigans? While I might enjoy that in theory, I wanted to do something special, remind my Draco that even nineteen years later, I do choose him again and again every day. We've had a lot of big dates, huge international anniversary trips, and SO many filthy fantasy fulfillment.
The rest of the raid was rather uneventful. What took longer than expected was that the entire operation was massive and it took a lot of time to get through. A few suspects needed the loo, discovered the raid, and tried to escape, but were caught before they could get to the nearest exit. I'm sure they were dismayed to find that they couldn't just Apparate out, but that's the first ward that goes up. The higher up criminals were clustered in the innermost room of the entire operation, and they had security measures in place that made the raid interesting for a few of the team for a couple of minutes, but aside from some few minor injuries, no one was hurt.
I know it'll probably be a pain in the arse, but... worth it? If it help us figure this out, then yes, definitely worth it. And while we're doing this, I have permanent night watch, yeah?
We got to the cottage a bit before lunch yesterday. It was this
"No, sorry," I murmured, looking around the room to see if I could see her husband. He was reclining on the bed, apparently watching the telly and drinking a beer.
The Princess did call me and apologize, so thank you for talking to her. I can tell myself a million times that I know why she was so hurtful, but I am still a person and my feelings were hurt. I didn't feel like I needed the apology until I had it.
That's when I brought up the fact that as wizards, we get to be twice as safe because we can utilize the Muggle safety measures while adding our own spells and safety charms. Our Princess, our darling Vivi, teeny tiny first child love of my life, says loud enough for me to hear but *under her breath* "Yeah, unless you learn how to take your Dad's charms off."
You shrieked, and then moaned when you realized our guest knew just what you liked. Once you had a moment to realize I'd invited a guest to our anniversary shag, a guest who was completely silent and you couldn't quite turn well enough to see who it was, you whined into my ear. "Ungh, Harry, this is amazing and you know I … oh fuck yes … love playtime, but … Merlin that's the spot yes!! … on our anniversary?"
I love how open to kink YOU are!! I am being 100% honest when I say that if we never did anything kinkier than the most vanilla sex ever, I would be fulfilled and happy just having you. But! Being able to experiment and add so many different layers to our sex life has been perfection for me.
"Right! Hooooooo HAA! So, as I was saying, I need your advice on what I should do. Should I have the Wizengamot reschedule the vote for a later date when I'm more confident? Should I rewrite the law so that it's clearer and easier to understand?! SHOULD I COLOR CODE THE LAW?!?!"
After that, I decided to write this email, and now I'm going to use the international floo to bring me and the littles back to Spain for the night,
Tuesday January 9th
"The very same," I confirmed with a grin.
With love and trust,
I'll admit that the entire barbecued pig has been FABULOUS!!!
Oh wait, I had a very close relationship with my hand, and you've met my two rubber friends.
Love you,
"Ugh, that is one of the things my wife and I fought about when she was pregnant with our daughter. She had to be put on bed rest and I wanted to do everything for her, and to an extent, she needed me to, but then it also drove her mad."
He was extremely flustered and couldn't apologize fast enough.
As always, our boys can't stay mad at each other for too long.
I just can't help but think it's hilarious that she's so particular about being the center of attention. She's in a massive family! She is one of twenty-four kids. She has just turned two years old and she already has eleven nieces and nephews with another on the way.
Sunday September 20th
I sighed. "I feel so tired all of a sudden..."
"Merlin! You have no idea what this is doing to me!" Oliver gasped out in a ragged and sensually husky feminine voice.
"Yeah, but try not to worry, he and Cordelia made an agreement not to do anything until marriage," Zwei added with a smirk. "Bloody morons!"
As we ate, we chatted about this and that. He wanted to hear more about my vision and didn't quite believe I was serious about having the ability until I mentioned to him that it was part of the reason I originally wanted to be part of the Aurors - as a sort of consultant that ended up being the Chief of Raids. After our mouthwatering dessert of cherry cheesecake, Oliver pulled me close and wrapped one arm around me even as he rested his head on my shoulder, making me lean my head against his as we continued to talk about some of the raids I'd conducted over the years.
Friday at 4:36 PM
Dear Harry and Oliver,
Harry, wasn't Oliver simply adorable this evening? I know he's met Shtara, and I know he knows that she's starring in a play and even more likely to burst into song at the drop of a hat than the rest of us, but somehow, he just hadn't... put all of those pieces together in his mind.
I know you wanted to leave 'Operation: get Neville's Long cock in Harry's Bottom" for a night that wouldn't upstage Pansy's announcement, but I had the perfect opportunity in front of me. I hope I was subtle enough not to anger Pansy's hormones. "Nev, swinging, sharing, or playing isn't right for every relationship, but there is nothing that would ever happen during these playtimes that would change how heart stoppingly in love with Draco I am, I am able to separate physical pleasure from feelings of friendship with our playmates, and nothing Draco could do would make me feel as though I didn't own 100% of his heart." I left it there because I knew pushing it any further would most likely anger or frustrate you, Nev, and Pansy, but I hope I gave him something to think about before you continue with your next attempt.
If you come home and check your email before looking for me - and I'm not in bed waiting for you - you can find me in the bathtub. It'll be the perfect temperature if you care to join me. And I'll be edging so that I'm still very ready for you no matter how long you take. Perhaps, if you time it right, you'll catch me at the perfect time for a quick release to calm us both down before we retire to our bed and hold each other.
And there are markets, and an archaeological site, and museums, and beaches, and a CASTLE! It's so warm that I definitely want to try and stick to outdoor sightseeing. There's too much sunshine to stay indoors for long!
Oh and Ollie, I am including you in that previous statement. I don't think I'd have survived these past months without you being willing to wake up in the middle of the night to help with the babies. Even if you didn't change a single nappy (and you have changed a lot) and even if you never sang or rocked a baby to sleep (we all know you will be rocking Gabe to sleep until he goes to Hogwarts!) it's just been nice having an adult to talk with while I'm up feeding a set of almost triplets.
Harry Potter’s – The Viper
You most definitely are NOT the best Seeker ever! The only reason you won most of the matches against me is that I was too busy looking at YOU to notice the bloody snitch. Had I ever put my head in the game where it was suppose to be, I would have definitely kicked your arse across the pitch AND castle grounds!
And on the other side of Gemini is my Oliver. Gorgeous in sleep. And cuddled up as close to Gemini as Draco is to Evangeline. Merlin Ollie, I can't get over how beautiful you are wrapped around our grandchild. And I know it's logical that we wait a bit longer, we have weddings and trips and end of term responsibilities, but I ache with how badly I want to see you wrapped around OUR child. Sometime soon, on a night like tonight when I can't sleep because I am too full of love, my view will be you and Draco with our child cuddled in between you.
My Dragon,
"Ah. Alright, I believe that you're not a threat, but the question remains: what in the bloody hell am I supposed to do with you?" I asked myself more than him.
I didn't really pay attention to what my parents, Della, and Sebastian ate. Possibly the best part was the fabulous sunset we could see through the window. The sun over the Mediterranean is often described as a magical sight, but as a wizard, I'm more inclined to think of it as beautifully mundane.
Ha! Just kidding! I'm going to the playroom. I'll be kneeling, naked and ready for you whenever you're done Master. Hopefully see you soon!
Do you mind if I tell Kingsley about all of the theories you came up with? Maybe the aurors will have dealt with a similar enough case that maybe it will trigger a memory?
Viper snorted. "MY Draco tries to deny that there's any bad left in him. He'll submit to light impact play when I need him to - when he's bloody home - but he WON'T let me beat him up."
You'd actually reached another orgasm by this point too and needed to pant and recover. Luna probably had more than a few orgasms by that point - being a woman, she doesn't have a refractory period and is actually used to having as many as she likes because they come so easy for her. Even so, she was nice and sleepy, and so, when you and I drifted off to sleep - the demon exhausting me as much as ever - she was content to curl up with us and sleep too.
Thursday December 3, 2009
Monday was a bit stressful because we (you and me, not Viona) went to see Healer Rowe. You were concerned about the severity of my brain fog, but personally, I was concerned that they seemed to be fighting in there almost constantly, and while wearing a belly brace can help ease the ever increasing aching - that is slowly driving me mad - it seems like THEY hate it and kick all the harder.
ANYWAY, as I was saying before you so rudely interrupted Luly, we should go back in time and tell 1992 Lucius Malfoy that some day his only son was going to get knocked up by the ruddy savior. Do you think you'd have a heart attack?
You should really plan accordingly for having a lunatic share your bathroom!
He looked at me with those narrowed eyes. I could tell he was thinking that I was there to rail on him for snogging again. "You here to yell at me again?"
I am definitely still missing you Dragon, but having Ori here on his birthday and having the breathtaking Gemini here to smooch all over helps ease the heartache just a little.
"Ladies," she purred with a grin at the three out of four that hadn't left yet. "I see you're all wearing comfortable shoes, which is fine if that's what you ALWAYS wear. But IF you EVER wear heels, you should really spar in them. They actually give you quite the advantage when kicking a bastard in his eye!" She lifted a foot so that everyone could see her lethal looking stilettos.
Class proceeded smoothly. Everyone is making good progress and since I am only on week four out of 16, I'm not being too terribly hard on them yet. Also, with me encouraging the old students to teach the new ones, they are all doing quite well since it gives the old ones confidence in their skills, and the new ones don't have me punching them on a daily basis.
P.S. If I find there's not enough room for me in our bed, then why wouldn't I just cast an enlarging charm on the bed??? I mean I can still lay on you if you want, but I should solve the problem first, right?
Outside of yesterday's screaming fit I had a few things I would like to say now that I am calm.
Knowing better, I only put any real effort into my bottoms. Thus, when I walked onto the track to pick up my students (the Ministry expert assured me that the new students were already making progress on their run, and that the prior students *might* be ready to go up in time if I needed them too. Unfortunately, I'd already pushed them back an hour so that they could grab a bite to eat before running for an hour before class, and so, as tempting as that was, no.), we all looked at my shirt to find:
I am sorry I wasn't awake when you came home last night. I'm mostly sorry that I wasn't awake to see and talk to you in person. I'm a little disappointed that it now feels as though it's been days since I've seen you last because of my all night library fest. But I'm the most sorry for me that I wasn't awake to have you give me a rousing spanking, letting me fly right out of my head for a bit.
Did Viona start having her period without me knowing it? I would SWEAR she was channeling Pansy on her rag today. I mean she's only 10 going on 11, so it's probably not likely, BUT did she??? I was more than a little afraid that I was not going to survive today!
Monday July 26th
You laughed. "We definitely have help financially supporting the Unity Houses, but as for the travel, part of not having to worry about money is Draco's portion of the Malfoy fortune, and part of it is the fact that Draco's a GENIUS at investing money in businesses! He took a little bit of my money and started a few businesses I mentioned I thought were good ideas, and now I probably *could* afford to travel the world on my own Knut and never have to worry about money."
Brain bleach!
My better half,
So Muffy is bringing them to you right now, you'll probably already know they're there by the time you read this. I've scanned everyone else in the house, everyone else is all clear. I promise you, the almost twins are completely healthy. And updates on their weights, they are right on track compared to their birth weights, Orion is 8.6 kg (19lbs), and our dainty little cherub Eris is 6.1 kg (13.5lbs). She's basically two-thirds of him. He's a monster!
My love,
Again, the girl looked confused. "Why would I want to talk to my dad? And how would YOU know what he's like???"
"Greengrass," Robards stated, looking like he was wondering why this was important.
Dear Harry and Draco,
And then we have bubbles...
However, the point of my classes is to develop a respect for Muggles, an understanding of the ingenuity and resourcefulness it takes to live without magic, and the ability to blend into the Muggle world for short or even potentially long periods of time. But those aren't things that are particularly easy to test in some sort of standardized testing. Realistically, it doesn't matter if they can memorize historical dates or list the top ten telly programs of the last decade.
"What's this, Chief? Are we organizing a raid on a convent or something where men aren't allowed?"
P.P.S. Greg got a rather large order through his shop, so he might be scarce for a while.
I had fun, and I think you had fun too. Every few dances, we'd take a moment to steal a kiss from one another and get a drink. Hermione helped on that front by making sure that a house elf was practically glued to our sides with a never ending water glass for each of us on a tray. They were charmed to look like tall flutes of champagne, so people probably thought we were either very good at handling our alcohol, or amazingly coordinated despite our near certain tipsiness, haha!
"Fine, I could actually use some biscuits, since I now have an empty stomach and am a bit peckish."
Our River smirked at him. "I have two happily married dads. Do you really think I'd be shocked to hear that girls just don't do it for you?"
Saturday March 13th
Yesterday was so much fun. I took nearly three full hours to get ready, everything from my hair, nails, and moisturizer to my perfectly tailored clothes. Since the play was showing in muggle London, I wore trousers with a charm to hide my ever growing bump.
Buwahaha! After receiving Harry's plea for help, I ordered Muffy to prepare a half dozen cups of the best and most caffeinated coffee that Harry loves. I figured that if they were put in stasis, there might be enough to last throughout the day. That said, I made sure that one of the mugs was a beautifully decorated treasure that said: World's Best Dressed Bride.
"You think they're shagging him?" Girly asked curiously, looking happy to have something else to think about for a moment.
Tonight's shaping up to be a rather lazy one. We've all agreed to sit under the stars and just be together as we take turns holding Nicolas and singing to the littles. The Feisty ones will probably run around playing some game or other, but they'll be with us as well. Even Zaire and Jaz - who have been half working since we arrived - have decided to do nothing important tonight but hang out with the family.
Don't you worry your beautiful head Draco, we've got the homefront covered while you go run for Minister! Morgana has finally accepted Ollie into her very small list of people she loves, Gabe likes him more than either of us, and Dylan's such an easygoing baby that I sometimes forget there are three of them.
I think the apology article was quite well written, which of course meant that I didn't even need to read who the author was before knowing it wasn't Skeeter! Hopefully that quick apology will keep those hateful words from becoming a circulating rumor.
Our kids are bloody brilliant! How did we get so blessed?!
… Wait...
"And...….. What do you want in return?" The boys asked me skeptically. One actually and unconsciously rubbed his bum and vaguely nodded as if thinking he would do it in exchange for something like this.
Anyway, we're about to head out on our morning walking tour. We're coming back to have lunch at that restaurant across the street from the hotel. We should be there around 12:30 if either of you (Ollie) are awake by then and want to join us. I know it's a long shot but I'm very hopeful that you'll BOTH be awake by then so you can join us for the afternoon's festivities. We will be going to the Louvre while we're here, I can't in good conscience bring these children here and NOT introduce them to the greatest museum of all time! But this afternoon we are doing a completely different type of museum, The Musee des Arts Forains. It's all entertainment based. I'm looking forward to it, it's new to me as well.
For now, this Tournament is rather fun. Ask me about it again closer to the date when Hermione has me working around the clock and I brew into Hurricane Draco. I probably won't love it so much at that point, ha.
Not ONLY does my bump look bigger than the Manor, but it's ALSO lumpy and bumpy! It's frankly ugly and I dislike it. I shudder when I think about how much BIGGER it's going to get!!! But that said, even though my magic is holding steady - on the low side of normal, but better than my previous pregnancies. Aside from Zwei - he's basically been my star pregnancy, a singleton with no real problems.
Oh never mind, she's wide awake and ready to party again. And huh, it seems that Eris, Hazel, and Pearl have decided to have midnight snacks and hot chocolate. In the library. I'm going to bring Jasmine to join their little party and see if there're any of those biscuits you baked yesterday left.
I've decided that I'm going to say it and practice saying it over and over - whether other people can hear me or not. I suppose I'll need to be able to do it for our wedding anyway, but here goes...
P.S. You could always come with me, so long as you have nothing important at Unity House and agree to a interesting color scheme/stimulating pattern.
In any case, you entered the room just after everyone else had left to find Elena, Ethan, and me standing there after putting everything away.
"NOW you know what it's like to just be minding one's own business and learn things best unknown!" Orion heckled me, even going so far as to poke me in the side with his elbow. "Such as that time we popped back home real quick only to find you looking way way WAY too bloody hot in leather trousers and pirate earrings of all things, talking about how you and dad were hosting a play party. That was like above and beyond in the category of things I didn't really need to know!"
Draco
Draco
Love you,
Meanwhile, Blaise can wear a Karada Harness made out of red rope, handcuffs, and a pair of red and/or black wings - a visual inside joke, hahaha. Luna can wear...
First of all, Zaire getting up crazy early to help his Grandma Molly in the kitchens, cooking enough food to feed our small army? Yeah, so surprising .... how did you not know this? Z will take any opportunity to spend time with Molly, she's his favorite (shh, don't tell the other Grandmothers). And if cooking is on the table he always wants in. Putting cooking together with his Grandma brought the likelihood of him involving himself up to a ninety-nine point nine percent chance.
Sigh...
Well now, weren't you eager?
"Alright, but only on the condition that Flora Apparates you to the meeting place, and then you have to promise to Insta-owl her the moment your date is over so that she can go get you," I decided.
So, I’m out spending time with my little Pipsqueak who I’ll miss over the next few weeks until we go back to pick her and Bandar up.
Harry,
So, when I read you asking if I wanted to play, and then you went on to say I probably wasn't ready, it made me realize that I wasn't ready but libido-ily speaking … to heck with you, libido-ily is totally a word … I wasn't super against it. Then I started to think of ways that we could play without triggering my possessive streak. The last thing I would want would be to invite our friends over for sexy times and then my accidental magic starts sending out stinging hexes to anyone who so much as looks at you!
Kissing you for being the best husband in the world, I released Luna and ordered her to lay face down on the bed - because this seemed like it would be rather awkward for two pregnant men if we tried it on the X or even the various cushions. We both gave you as much time as you needed to climb into bed and contemplate if you really wanted to do this and how exactly you were going to go about it. With a nod (agreeing with the thoughts in your head?), you settled yourself to rim her a bit more and work her open with your fingers.
Anyway, with you off sobbing in the loo, or possibly already back home so that you could sob into one of your new pillows, I looked around again to make sure that the rest of our brood was still together and ready to leave the moment the train was out of sight. I wasn't super worried about another incident in which Fran Gorman kidnapped the wrong child (especially because she's firmly back in Azkaban) because each child that wasn't going to Hogwarts this year had their elf with them as a sort of unofficial bodyguard. No way in hell were we going to risk anything happening with so many of our children out in public at a time and place where we were EXPECTED to be out in public, and thus, a good time to pull shenanigans if someone wanted to.
I hate sitting and feeling useless in the hospital while I worry over the health and safety of a loved one. I feel powerless. I want to help, but as I am not a healer what help would I really be? I would just be in the way if I tried to muscle my way into the action. And in a muggle hospital no less!
Sunday January 17th
I'm so thrilled that Lainie had such a good trip with Kisa. I was worried over nothing, Grandmama kept her happy, healthy, safe, and alive. Those were my goals. For my own sanity it's definitely a good thing that she brought her insta-owl with her to Kamchatka. I may have been able to let her go for that long, but that much time without any contact would have made me an absolute panicking mess. Good thing the insta-owls allowed me to stay calm, cool, and collected.
He passed out the moment we were finished, but I rested on top of him, happy to wait for my shaft to finish deflating before attempting to move. That said, I think I probably took a mini nap. The next thing I knew, I was a little uncomfortable and rolled over onto my back - both me and Oliver still half off the bed, which wasn't exactly comfortable at the moment either.
So, when we closed in on the last possible room she could be in, we were all understandably excited. Not only was it the last place to look, but the light from the baggie of hair was pointing directly at it.
Monday at 3:12 PM
P.P.P.S. Were you as surprised as I was to see Wojtek? He's fully grown now, but I've been so busy with other things, that I haven't really paid attention to him. He's fully grown and MASSIVE, but still thinks he's a lapdog! I had to cast a strengthening spell on my lap to support him when he came over to sit on me and maul me with affection on the plane!
Most Gorgeous Man in the World,
I stopped smiling completely. Looking him in the eyes, I decided to tell him the complete truth - rather than avoid it, because I would never lie about something like this. "If I was really simply a generous person, would I donate such a large amount of money? No. I would give a more reasonable amount and help THEM raise the rest. I donated an amount that I desperately hoped would ease my conscious, but it didn't. I still have to live with the fact that I indirectly murdered Farrah. There's nothing I can ever truly do to make up for that."
Oh Oliver!
Anyway, moving on, you're still not back with my breakfast, which means that you're probably making me something extremely delicious. But my stomach is growling and I'm not sure I'd care if I was eating Hagrid's rock cakes. I'm going to have to figure out where the kitchen is at this rate.
They went on to postulate that his daughter may have even known and taken steps to throw them off the trail by murdering the last victim and pouring concrete over the pit. That said, they can date the last body pretty accurately, and so, were able to verify the daughter's alibi and clear her as a suspect.
Today in class, wanting another day of distraction, I had them do a bit more work on the internet and subsequently their emails. I had them sign up for certain websites, showing how risky giving out information can be on the internet. The assignment had me opening up my own secondary email and saw I had a massively full inbox. Oops.
I'm in a much better mood, but I am feeling a little embarrassed about my last email, but you took it pretty well, and so I'll try not to dwell on it. I didn't email first thing in the morning because I was a bit hung over and my number one goal was to get home as soon as I could before I humiliated myself any further. So, I spent an hour or so taking muggle transportation to the nearest Portkey office, and then Portkeying to the office in London - did you know they don't like to do custom destinations unless there's a good reason for it? Apparently being a Malfoy and wanting to get home as soon as possible does *not* qualify as a good reason. Baffling, I know.
Whatever she was going to say next was cut short as my father kissed her. The same sort of kiss I give you that makes all the Kids groan in disgust. Apparently I am still a kid.
Love,
I love you,
"Ah, anyway, so. As I see it, the problem at hand - first and foremost - is making sure you five have a place to stay until and while we figure things out. What do you say, Harry, my love? Shall I order the elves to prepare a suite in the Manor?"
"Are you saying your mind is nice and tidy?" Oliver asked with an amused smile.
Love of My Life,
Viona and I are at Unity House, she is playing with the kids. I've been scrubbing it top to bottom ... the muggle way.  If you need a little more space we can stay here tonight. It's not a huge space because we obviously wanted the space for the kids to be the priority, but there is an overnight room for when I or a second caregiver need to stay overnight.
I am not upset you were wrestling with Draco and he knocked his head.
Draco
So that's that. Sebastian is definitely Gina Mitchell's other son. It's lucky for us that when she showed up, she was so focused on getting what she wanted from my father that she didn't notice Sebastian in the room. Also, if she gave him up at birth, she may not know what he currently looks like, and may actually assume that he is still in Unity House with the other kids rescued at the same time. I don't think she's put enough thought into the fact that you actually help children find homes, and so, not all of the children are there anymore.
You're my passionate love. You're my soulmate. But you're also my best friend. And if you can't be a lunatic with your best friend then who can you be a lunatic with?
Sunday at 1:24 PM
So, when I saw the toll Farrah was taking on Orion, I convinced myself that something needed to be done. That I was PROTECTING our son and his baby by eliminating a threat to their health and happiness. So I made a potion that I ordered Orion's house elf to give to Farrah that sped up her pregnancy by making the baby grow at an accelerated rate.
We laid our calm and observant son on the altar, I anointed him with oils from his own chalice, and you said "May the Gods keep this child pure and perfect, leaving all negatives far beyond his world. May you always have good fortune, may you always have good health, may you always be joyful with love in your heart. You are known to the Gods and to us as Orion Draco Malfoy. This is your name and it is powerful. Bear your name with honor and may the Gods bless you on this and every day. I honor you Orion Draco."
I managed to shift everyone in their sleep without waking anyone so that I currently have your head in my lap so I can run my hand through your hair as I type. The littles and River are on the side bed, so if I feel like molesting you when I'm done with this email, I can without worrying about waking any of them.
Grinning, I continued. "To that end, I was really hoping that you'd allow me to see your mission statement, your policies and procedures, and actually, your business plan - if it's not confidential. I personally want to see if you have plans to handle all contingencies, and if so, what they are. As for my partner here, he's actually working on a DIFFERENT business with me, and I think it would do him some good to read over these things so he can think about contingency plans for our business as he moves forward."
He seemed to try reading my face, maybe to see if I was sincere and I think I passed, "Are you sure Harry? I know I looked weird and not exactly the epitome of masculinity."
There is no reply until some time between 2 and 3AM. Then Harry receives an email from Draco's account (sent via Draco's Magitablet). ***
Oh yes! You. Naked. ...
"Ew???" Our River asked in confusion.
"Alright," you murmured, summoning the potions for me to drink. "I don't care WHAT else is going on, I'll make you go on bed rest if I have to! I'll call in Healer Rowe to make it an order if that's what it takes to get you to listen!"
My Dearest Love,
Draco
But you eventually remembered which is the important thing I suppose. And you remembered last night ... while we were all relaxing after a good but long day, Ollie and I cuddling the babies ... and you writing the email ... then we talked before actually going to sleep ... then you mentioned you'd written the email ... that you said had nothing in it that couldn't wait for tomorrow (today) when I asked if we should read it before we went to sleep ...
"Zwei? The sooner I go find your brother, the sooner we'll get started," I pointed out.
I'll give you about an hour or so to read this, deal with your emotions, and then Ollie and I will come find you to talk.
He bit his lip in thought. "You know... I grew up in the 70s. It WASN'T the 60s with it's big push for free love, but still, it was riding the wave. Even so, it wasn't anywhere NEAR as open and accepting as this time seems to be. Hell! We went on a cruise in which EVERYONE seemed to be on the pull, and NO ONE seemed to find this odd."
Your very worried husbands,
But, our fame isn't out of the equation, and the Prophet does exist, and people rarely are able to keep their mouth shut. So where does this leave us? If you just want to think about these things as a fantasy and as dirty talk to keep me at peak frustration then obviously that is ok for me. But it seems like this pulls itself out of fantasy for you and into something you truly desire. I suppose we could polyjuice or something along those lines, but I don't think it would feel right. And we'd also only have an hour to play.
PHEW! She's sleeping in the bassinet with her brothers under the watchful eye of my mother.
Your husband, and your fiance
Saturday July 28th
But speaking of the Prophet and the rest of the media, we've actually been INNUNDATED by requests to broadcast the show. The WWN wants to play all the songs as one solid radio show a couple of times, and then play the songs individually as they like - paying us Royalties, of course. I'm going to go ahead and approve that as I assume anything that brings in added revenue for Unity House is okay in your book.
Mmmmm.…...
Hunting in general is very different than hunting with an owl. I personally do not have the spear and bow skills necessary to successfully take down a large wild animal. Neither does Zaire - much to his chagrin as he was teased mercilessly for being a terrible shot. Guess who killed the wildebeest?
"That sounds brilliant," she agreed, obviously trying to sound cheerful.
He sighed in defeat. "Alright. I'll keep my hands to myself, I promise."
I waited a moment for you, Harry, to stop attempting to gulp down the entire mug of coffee in one swallow, and then cast a breath freshening spell on you so that I could demand a possessive kiss free from the taste of that vile drink. I then did the same to Oliver.
When I ran out of stuff to do I went to bother ... I mean see if I could help out Poppy or Minnie. Minnie shoo'ed me away, told me she had more important things to do than entertain a bored Gryffindor. But Poppy had an errand for me to run. I guess the potions professor wanted to negotiate an additional fee for stocking the hospital wing with healing potions. (Side note: Poppy does NOT like him!) and both she and Minnie agree that it was too late to find an adequate potions professor this close to the beginning of term, so they're paying the staff at St. Mungo's to brew the necessary potions for the school. I was asked to head over to St. Mungo's to pick up what they've gotten ready.
By this point, we'd reached our room in our suite and the two of us tenderly tucked you into bed to sleep off the alcohol. Oliver climbed into bed with you and held you like he would rather deflect a bombarda with his bare hands than let you go any time soon. I was running my hands through your hair again.
The dragon flew off to deliver his message, and to our relief, Oliver came flying down in about a minute, even as the students simply came to a more reasonable height and continued on without him.
Harry
My Adorable Love,
"So do I. Now kindly remove your hands from me before MY Harry thinks something bad is going on and goes into rampage mode," I advised, tilting my head so that my chin pointed in your direction.
The interviewer interrupted at that point, "You're saying none of Harry Potter's children would end up in Gryffindor? I find that hard to believe."
But since my brother has ALWAYS been an utter weirdo (and I mean this in a good way), everyone else is basically taking this decision in stride. The only voice of minor dissension is Della, who still thinks that our brother having ANY sort of relationship with her doppelgänger is a bit incestuous. She's not entirely wrong, but since there is no actual romance or sex involved, it's really no one's business what they want to call each other.
Hair? Mahafsoun has some? I hadn't noticed. Put your mind at ease, there's nothing to worry about.
My Draco,
"I will," I promised, a little dismayed that he had reverted to calling me Mr. Malfoy, but decided that he was simply still trying to process what was happening.
Ugh, I hate this. And I threw a bit of a tantrum earlier today. Don't worry, it wasn't magical. Even if I weren't keeping a tight leash on my magical outbursts, I wouldn't have really had enough magic at my disposal to cause myself any damage anyway. So I had a classic toddler temper tantrum. I was brought a lovely pot of peppermint tea earlier. I was irritable and tired and this bloody padding on my arse is bothering me. So I was quite rude to the nice man who brought it to me. I told him to bugger off with his damn tea. And instead of buggering off, he said, "Healer Rowe thinks a spot of tea would be quite good for you."
I played along, "Sure honey! But I've just missed you so much, kisses first?"
But... as for the specific details - such as when we do this (and I think we should time it so that the new baby is born in July or August, which at this point, would have to be next year since a baby theoretically conceived tomorrow night would be born in October) and how...
When I learned this, I asked how he managed to be the biggest and burliest man of all when he was, erm… not fully a man. He was not offended - having his whole life to accept this about himself - and told me that it's actually a well known phenomenon that if men have their testicles removed at certain ages, different things typically happen to them. If it happens prepuberty, they remain small and effeminate their whole lives and are often prized as singers and the like. However, if it happens after puberty - or toward the end - the body apparently tries to compensate for the loss of testosterone by producing higher quantities of the Androgynous sex hormones, which often leads to a sort of plumping up of their bodies, sometimes including their muscles.
Just before leaving, Viper popped into the room. You and he had talked and agreed that he would come with to have a paternity test spell done.
"Yeah," Oberon admitted. "And I kept to myself as much as possible so that I wouldn't form a crush on anyone. Even just having a best friend was dangerous, because it meant letting that person get to know me well enough to suspect the truth."
P.S. Ah! I almost forgot! As long as our house is ready by then, well be leaving two weeks from today. That will give us a few days to get settled before I start working on Monday 12 February.
At that point, I felt utterly exhausted and didn't have the energy to even TALK, so Ginger helped me over to a hastily transfigured sofa and set me in it so that I could rest. From there, I could hear Robards order Roche to go ahead and process Braun for the murder of Imogen Hughes. Half a breath later, he was asking the women in the room if they wanted to join him on a little field trip.
After giving me an honestly impressive eye roll, she signed everything. Giving me a kiss on the cheek for luck and extracting a promise that I'd bring Nora by for a movie night very soon.
Tangled up in each other as we drift off from well sated lethargy is still my favorite thing to do. Except that I woke up after only an hour - which gave me time to write this and help the elves feed the twins. So now they're back in bed with us, as is Viona. Tag! You get the next feeding, haha!
This isn't quite Rage Halo... It's something else. Something perhaps far more dangerous. I'm worried that you're - I dunno- hurt or something, and then I'm worried that Harry's about to rush off and murder everyone in his path until he finds you. What am I supposed to do? Help him? Stop him? Stay home and watch the kids???
I did NOT do anything in the loo! Well, not anything more than what you saw on the dance floor. In fact, we never even made it into the loo. We were standing in that long arse line, once more snogging and grinding together. The more we did so, the more I felt uneasy.
She rolled her eyes. "You ALWAYS have something important to do on Saturday nights!"
I smiled at him. "By all means, love, carry on."
Thankfully, we'd reached our climax and were simply kissing and caressing each other in a quest to see if we were going to go again. Thus all she really interrupted was the possibility of a third round.
Draco Lucius Malfoy!
You finally passed out as the sun was rising. But I needed to get my thoughts out before I let sleep take me. It's your actual birthday today. Neither of us are going anywhere. You are going to sleep in as late as you'd like. And tonight we are going to have a picnic dinner just the six of us, and then snuggle in for a movie. If you'd like to do something else, let me know and I can change plans. But I thought you might enjoy something small with your family after last night's big to-do.
On her second birthday, the differences were still there but the size difference seemed even more obvious. She was walking and talking. But by her second birthday not much of it was particularly comprehensible. Whereas Cael was practically speaking in full sentences and Lissa wasn't too far behind him. But our Seph had stopped saying much at all. Luckily, she grew up in a signing family and could at least communicate with us. And shortly after that second birthday, we found out she needed a procedure, similar to muggle ear tubes, because she wasn't hearing properly.
"Have fun, my loves," I said and signed. "Did anything good happen this morning while shooting?"
Harry
I covered your mouth before you could say: "That's not my name."
My gorgeous men,
Our poor babies. When we went to pick up the children Friday night, our big girls clung to me. Then Lainie pulled back like she didn't want to push herself on someone who didn't know her. I didn't let her go, and pulled her back to me saying, "Lainie-girl, you don't have to be scared of hugging me." Well that was enough for her to know that her dad was back and she almost knocked me over with the force of her throwing herself back into my arms.
Then we went to bed and snuggled for a bit before you fell asleep. I held you for a long time, not able to get to sleep. I meant what I said. I'd rather have the smallest part of you than none of you at all.
She rolled her eyes at me. "Of course, but then it looks like I messed up and had to fix it mid dance."
Grampy Lulu, a sucker as big as my Ollie as far as I'm concerned, kept the playhouse but told Nora he'd build her a little grotto/lagoon for her to play at being a mermaid.
He's so sneaky.
Dudley still looked a little confused, but *also* trying to accept this. He frowned. "The hard part for me to wrap my head around is that when I was an arse to you about calling out for Cedric in your sleep, calling you gay, you got mad and nearly cast a nasty spell on me. So, if I was right, why did you get so mad?"
Ahahahahaha! Katja ordered you to take a relaxing bath! She gave you a potion to promote relaxation and sent you to lay in our nice warm tub. She thinks you won't be able to have any fun at all in Egypt if you're this stressed out, and I agree just a tiny bit.
Then as I stood there in shock and trying to decide what I'm supposed to do as his father - stop him? Go away? Ground him? Take a moment to ensure that he remembers all the protection spells?
I sighed and focused on her by using a hint of magic to clean her hair so that I could comb my fingers through it and enjoy the texture. "Harry finds the little ones. Aside from Zaire and Jaz - which we actually found together and realized were ours within about a day or two of thinking about it - Harry has been the one to find ALL of the little ones. I tend to find the bigger ones. Harry finds the little ones and falls in love with them at first sight, and then agonizes over the fact that we already have SO many kids that we really shouldn't adopt any more, but when I find the big kids and fall in love with them at first sight, he tends to get upset with me. But I told him so very long ago that I have to put a wall around my heart to stop from wanting to love, help, and adopt them all. The PROBLEM is that just being with Harry has completely shattered that wall. So now, I see kids like Mahafsoun and Jules, or this girl here, and all I want to do is bring them home and take care of them."
You stared at your hands in your lap. "I'm actually very worried about your baby. What if it turns out to have magic and the Dursleys can't love it?"
Now I'm wishing you had sat next to me days ago and dictated our adventures because I'm afraid I am going to not do half of the things we did justice.
My heart is fit to burst with you,
So wait,
You stopped looking at me in concern as we both looked back at her.
As you melted into the cushions, you pulled me up to you and gave me an emotional kiss. "Do you feel better now? Have we met all your needs?"
Hmm... that seems to have calmed me down a bit. Hopefully I'll be able to go back to bed, pull your arms around me, and finish sleeping. Love you and looking forward to having breakfast/lunch with everyone when I wake up.
So, to start over. Our Darling Harry, go on and have fun but not TOO much fun and please stick to our rules and not have to beg for our forgiveness later.
Please let me know if there are any updates on her condition. I’m obviously at Unity every day, but I can definitely come home and be with her and you when her time comes.
I rubbed my forehead and did my best to calm down. "Listen, I'm sorry if I'm coming off as an arsehole at the moment, but I have no way to verify if you are telling the truth. As a father, I HAVE to protect my son, which means that I have to insist that you both get dressed and say goodbye to each other."
It's so sweet to me how well Jaz and Zaire get along, especially considering their difference in disposition. Jaz seems to adore anyone and everyone, she's open and expressive. While Zaire, most likely due to his earliest days, is reserved and prefers quieter settings and either one on one or small group interactions. As I said previously, getting pictures of our two newest was my priority for this portrait session. but I wasn't certain what order would make Zaire open up best and not get overwhelmed. Should we take the group pictures first so he doesn't feel so spotlighted? Or do we do his individuals first so he's not thrown into a group setting right away?
So, a series of discreet orders were issued and a couple of Aurors in costume were able to interest those students in some cool magic, which means that they were led away and taken into custody. They have been questioned and their parents have been brought in to talk about the very serious situation.
Ugh, bed rest. Normally, I might like having an excuse to stay in bed all day, but the reality of it is nearly the worst fate I can imagine. Lucky for me that the fact that I am so low on magic means that I am so exhausted that I sleep most of the time. I sleep, wake up long enough to get something to eat and down a power restoration potion, go to the loo, and then go back to sleep.
She was giving me an utterly suspicious look, even after the scanner confirmed that I was Tiger. "I brought a few people in Polyjuice with me because I've had assassination attempts against me and I wanted to be safe, thus I just proved that I'm the real me to you so that when I say this next part, you can't accuse me of being some random person Polyjuiced as me."
I'm so SORRY! I got a bit... mental. I think you were probably right, some combination of hormones and pregnancy chemicals - plus my history of mental instability during extreme stress - I really was going a bit insane. I know now how VERY bad all of my suggestions were, but at the time, they really did seem perfectly reasonable.
Age 13
I honestly don't know if this was just a matter of people being excited because it's the first one and the rest of the events will probably taper off. Perhaps it's just a really cool idea, I mean who doesn't love a safari. Maybe a mixture of both? But either way, turnout exceeded expectations. Seriously, did you see the look of panic in Pippa's eyes when she saw how many people were waiting to enter the train? She ended up being able to expand the train cars so everyone was able to go. But how big does something have to be when PIPPA didn't anticipate it? She takes everything we throw at her with barely a blink, but she was surprised by how many people arrived. Yikes.
Anyway, technically it wasn't a secret. It was a thing I knew that you didn't. If you had asked me about it, I would have answered. And when you DID ask me about it, I did the Malfoy thing: got what I wanted out of the deal (a delicious torture session) before coming clean.
It's been such a long week I am ready for the weekend. I plan on not getting out of my pajamas the entire time. Although for during the day I do mean actual pajama bottoms and not just my usual sleepwear of nude, or the occasional times I go to sleep in a pair of pants.
Friday November 13th
Tuesday April 16, 2019
"Provided the mother was visited by the father at some point before the egg was laid," Luna pointed out with a serene smile. "Otherwise it contains everything it needs except for the actual spark of life.
Oh my sweet Love,
Cassie is so strong! She's raising Brett as a single mom and already back to work. I'm just so proud of her!
We ignored him. I gestured toward your office. "Lead the way." So you did. And that boy was right, hahaha!
And a celebration was most definitely in the works for today. My little boy has been helping with all of his siblings’ birthday breakfasts, so I knew that while I usually did pancakes, he would be most excited by crepes. To be fair, he really just uses the crepes as a vehicle to force as many berries into himself as possible. What kind of berries you ask? Any of them. He is an equal opportunity berry monster. My favorite for him to eat would be raspberries because he makes the most adorable little sour faces between bites.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I think that's why I like being one of Hermione's Advisers so much. She assigns me the fun stuff. Like when we hosted the Triwizard Tournament. She had me go to the Russian and French Ministries and persuade them to join in, and I did. I felt such a sense of accomplishment at that."
"G'night," I returned with a respectful nod. That was when I returned to our room and slipped into bed with you, happy to have your arms around me.
You know, I actually find this a bit supremely unfair. ***I*** was always stuck taking final exams each year on my birthday. Never would have granted me special permission to take them early - no matter HOW much money my father threw at them! HRMPH!
"She died in a car accident," Vanessa informed us, and when we asked her name, learned that she was called Lisa Campbell, Thus Vanessa's last name is Campbell.
Other things came up too, but Yesenia and I agreed that for the immediate future, I should take the time that I'm going to be on tour with you to just think things over and see what makes the most sense after I've given everything a lot of thought.
Draco inadvertently confuses Harry, lol :-)
That's what reminded me about River and then reminded me about Australia. Yikes! We were leaving in fourteen hours and I hadn't done a thing! And that's when I remembered I hadn't told Sirius about our trip. I just assumed he would come with like he did for Unity Africa, but I didn't know that for sure. So I made my way to his room.
April 15, 1998
Worriedly,
How cute is that? Viona just climbed in my lap, I told her I was writing to her Daddy and she wanted to try. She stuck out her little pointer finger and I directed her little baby hands to all the right keys. Adorable, writing to her Daddy by letting me help her peck at the keyboard just like you!
"Alright..." Oliver murmured, still not understanding where I was going with this.
Oh! We're doing The Sandlot this week. I think during the summer when the big Kids are out of school, I'm going to do more movies that are aimed at the older ages. There's another movie I've thought about, but it has some foul language. It's The Adventures of Huck Finn. It deals with slavery and morality and how just because something is "the way things are and the way they always will be" doesn't make them right. But because of the topic, it has some racial language. Maybe we can watch it at home when we get back from the festival? Give it a screening before introducing it to Unity? If it doesn't work, I think we're going to do a quite older film, The Parent Trap.
I held out my hand. "Come with me a few minutes."
My sneaky tease,
I'm sure Amala will be just fine with her. She's good with Remus and Romulus. I know, it's different when dealing with a puppy versus a set of older, fully grown dogs, but she's always been good with anyone you've let her know was family. We just need to introduce them well and she will probably just think she's gotten another baby. Remus and Romulus will love her. And my Venus will make sure she stays on tabletops or at least high enough not to be reached by a hyperactive pup.
It started off well enough. I danced a sleeping Rita all over the house as I just generally enjoyed dancing. When I felt she was definitely not going to have anymore nightmares, I lay her back down and actually went to sleep. I actually crossed you, Harry my love, as you had apparently just shagged Oliver into oblivion and then got up and got ready for your day. So, you gave me a kiss goodnight that was at the same time, a kiss good morning for you.
"I don't WANT to know it!" She cried out softly. "I just want to ignore it until Summer Hols! I can go home and have it and put it up for adoption!"
And yes, it has a pool.
You slammed into me harder and faster. "I'm almost there my Harry, then I'll let you. You've been so good for me, for us. You deserve it." Right before I felt you stiffen up and start unloading inside of me, I felt the ring open up. I came. And came. And just kept cumming for what felt like forever. I fell backwards, letting you hold me up.
"Ah, so that's where things went different in this world," Other Harry murmured, biting his lip in thought. He then tilted his head and frowned at me oddly. "Leading me to somehow have kids with *Malfoy* - a LOT of kids!"
I can't wait to meet Saoirse and Rhys. She sounds fantastic. And even though we are only really hiring her to teach Miles and Lainie, and River if we're there long enough, I suppose, since he would be starting at Traditions in September -- Or I guess she could teach him anyway. Who cares about actual age, if he's interested in learning, I say we let him know the option is available. What was I saying? Oh yeah, it's nice to know that even though she's technically being hired to teach two, maybe three, children, as a mother of eight, she's not going to get scared off by living around our tiny circus. I will just go out on a limb here and ask: is she stern enough to command a tiny army, while actually being kind and patient? Just guessing she is, based on my own history of strong women who raised many children.
He pouted. "Why must you ALWAYS take HOURS to shag? Why can't you just shove me up against the wall and ram into me so hard I pass out?" His hands were urging my shaft to do just that.
And again with the unfortunate situations, I left you in bed to check on the animals and by the time I got back you had already headed back into the Ministry. I am assuming to do your paperwork from the raid. I swear to you Draco, if you are actually doing something dangerous I might redo my original patronus telling you to find somewhere else to sleep tonight.
Your Harry
So, what's more entertaining than myself, Blaise, Ron, and any other Wizards we can convince, doing a full Drag Show? Obviously we will force Miles into choreographing the entire thing. And in case you were wondering, you will be headlining.
"Ah," he stated in understanding.
"THAT ONE is MINE!!! How dare you punish him without my permission?! AND how DARE you do so in a way that I cannot stop when *I* feel he's had enough?!"
First of all, I am so glad we have an answer to what was happening. I mean I definitely wish you hadn't been hexed. Obviously I am going to find and murder the person who dared mess with what's MINE!
Wait, perhaps I might just let you take the kids and go, at least that way, I'll live through this. Actually, no I won't, because I'd die of a broken heart. Fuck!
"Hmm..." you hummed suspiciously.
She thinks she might just know what the murderer looks for in his victims now. What their actual connection is. Low self esteem in their looks leading to a willingness to be 'made perfect.' Not that there is any such thing, but it makes sense.
Draco reads an upsetting article in the Daily Prophet and needs a bit of alone time.
THEN the toy dog found six OTHER spots in which bodies were apparently buried. So now Hannah wasn't sure what to do. The boy could be in any one of them, and honestly, she wasn't quite sure that the dog was still doing its job rather than just playing around because the job was done. That said, the owners of the house thought it would be an interesting story to tell their neighbors and friends - even if all the holes turned out to be empty - so they gave permission for all seven spots to be dug up.
Thursday May 11th
We've known those boys for all of their four and a half years, even going to Tiger's Universe to attend their births, but it still shocks me to see how, as far as looks go, they may as well be part of our brood. Those identical little monsters are just Orion in miniature form. Minus the bookishness and adding a complete unwillingness to sit still. This must be what identical twins feel when their twin has a child. "But, but, but, that's MY face!"
Harry
I love you. I value your opinion above anyone else's, and it hurts me to hear you speak so lowly of me. Is it really such a bad thing that I am so terrified of losing you that I act out? That my love for you is so big that I can't contain it when I'm afraid for you?
Scorpius Potter-Malfoy
Since I was trying to hard to not worry and overthink about the Dean situation, or on you and the babies in general, I tried focusing all my efforts into really paying attention to my fans at the signings. So of course, what I did was really listen when they said their name and then eventually think about if I would like it as a baby name. Because I'm a lunatic.
"Ooooo! And cliff diving?" Persephone asked eagerly.
Ooo that man is on my list, and ooo that man I wanna kiss, my only sin is I can't win, ooo I wanna love that man,
This made us all chuckle. You beckoned to him with the hand that wasn't currently bracing against the headboard. "You can come join us if you want, Ollie."
Hermione specifically feels like you should have grabbed her, but understands that absconding with the current Minister for Magic might not have been the best idea. Which is why she and Ron both assume that you would have popped in, said: "'Mione, sorry I can't bring you with us, but I have need of Ron for a super secret mission and will have him back as soon as possible, even though it might take weeks."
And now I'm craving juice! Good thing we have a wide variety of fresh juices here. I think I'll go grab a glass to drink while I'm checking on Amala again. I'm so grateful that I have our support staff with us (currently just me as you have gone home for a bit for something that definitely CANNOT be serious or I'll have to punish you!), as Saoirse and Rhys are more than capable of watching our kids for me while I nurse a cranky cat back to health.
"Harry, help Blaise undress, and take your time, I want to enjoy the show," I commanded.
HOW DARE YESENIA SUGGEST THAT I NEED TO GO TO SLEEP?!?! HOW DARE SHE IMPLY THAT I'M OVERLY TIRED?!?! I'M OF HALF A MIND TO FIRE HER!!! WHINGING THAT SHE HAS KIDS AT HOME WHO NEED HER MORE THAN I DO!!!
As I understand it, you had been chatting with the Viper and Tiger over tea in the sunroom, so when Jaz (who must have woken up a bit early for her, as she usually stays in bed a couple of hours after you and Zaire get up, but not as long as me), anyway, when she started getting tired, you decided to put her down for a nap. This meant that you carried her into our suite and nursed her to sleep in the sitting area while you continued chat with the Viper and Tiger.
Maybe one tonight and one tomorrow night.
Gods I can not get enough of you!
Love you to the ends of the universe,
P.S. I have already sent a piece to the Daily Prophet that they are legally obligated to publish.
But ... Eri and Ori, were our first set of "twins" and they were only twins because they were biologically our children born on the same day. But they were carried by separate bearers. So ... not twins. And while we often lumped Haz in as the third of that set of babies and often treated them as though they were the same age, Eri and Ori are over a month older than Haz.
So, uh, the sorting went wonderfully, our girl obviously sorted Slytherin if she hasn't already sent a message telling you so. The hat didn't even fully touch her head before it was shouting out its decision.
I shrugged, not interested in him in the slightest. Slipping your hand in the crook of my sleeve, you smiled and bade me to: "Lead on, my love. I'd follow you through hell and back if you fancied it."
The ceremony was lovely. Their vows to each other made me cry (shocker!) And their sweet tributes to their mothers who died so early and couldn't be here on their special day was so sweet. When they lit candles and asked their mothers to watch over them? Well I am certain there wasn't a dry eye there.
My Lunatic,
"Fuck... NEVER in my life did I imagine that I'd be kissing that bratty Seeker from the Slytherin Team!"
Oh, you can't answer? Long and drawn out it is!
(See the end of the chapter for
Warning: there's a bit of het near the end.
My dearest love,
Ooh just heard the floo! I’m going to go see how my two favorite boys’ day went!
Lunch was a quick but tasty plate brought over by Zaire himself - who was wearing a visitor's badge that said: 'rescue mission - bring dad lunch.' He had enough to - surprise surprise - feed the whole department and set up a bit of a buffet. He also stuck around for a bit to answer all questions and describe in detail how he made each thing.
The older a MAN gets, the longer the back part of his iBeshu gets, so mine is to my knees (whereas Zaire is wearing the shortest version) as I am still an active man and could participate in fights and battles if I wanted. Also, as a married man, I wear a headband. My father, being past the warrior phase in life, would wear an iBeshu down to his ankles.
Before you panic, Lainie completely understands why you're missing this and has no idea you seem to have forgotten the date. I just explained to her that Ori and Dad were at St. Mungo's with Farrah who's in labor and she immediately told me not to worry at all. She just reminded me to make sure to pensieve print out some pictures for you and Orion to look at later.
"GIRLS!" I exclaimed, lowering my hands in a gesture meant to calm them down. "He's sufficiently chastised. There's NO need to get darling Grandmama involved! MERLIN! You're like your dad! He always wants to jump to most permanent solution to a minor problem too! Need I remind you that I'm WORKING for the MINISTRY and cannot be involved in any shady disappearances?!"
I'm not going to cave without a little proof you know I did something.
"Thank you, Harry love."
You moaned/hummed a response before giving me another kiss. "Have fun."
I promise I will not forget about our early workout date on Monday. But... can you not take Viona? I know she's an almost eerily good judge of character, but she's my baby. If I thought I could get away with it I would ask you not to go either. I know you can handle yourself, but the thought of you in potential danger makes me absolutely sick to my stomach. If something terrible goes down I want to know that you will only be focusing on saving your own skin and not splitting your focus between keeping you AND Viona safe. And let's just be honest with ourselves, you wouldn't split it particularly evenly (not that I'd blame you), you'd throw yourself in front of an AK for her.
After that, I had a chance to freely listen in as they planned a bit ahead to prepare for their upcoming child. All in all, it was a lovely bit of time spent with my son and his... Family, I suppose.
My sweet Zaire though, he misses his big brothers something fierce. I am pretty sure he's already counting down the days before he can join them at Hogwarts and convince the sorting hat to send him to Gryffindor with them. His best friend Jaz is probably the only thing keeping him from stowing away in their luggage every time they head back to the castle. That and the fact that you tell my Hogwarts Stowaway story so often that he's afraid he'll have to stand up in front of the entire student body and answer embarrassing questions if he ever did something like that.
My Sweet, Silly, Snob,
I took some advice for your email, and we basked in the sun while the babies napped and the "big" kids played in the Villa's pool. I love swimming in the sea so much, but if we were going to be lazy, it seemed a better plan to have them swimming in something a bit more contained. We had another wonderfully cooked meal at the Villa with the family and we headed off to our evening activities.
The band itself played music - sort of general orchestral music - during the parade. However, after our float made it to the finish and was pulled aside to watch all the others, the last two blocks were designated the zone the band focused on, and so, as each float passed through that zone, the music was changed to reflect whatever the theme of that float was.
That's the only silver lining in this whole mess. After grieving their son for so many years, Jacob's parents not only have closure, but they have a grandson who they can get to know and bond with. He's newly married and expecting his first child, so they'll have great-grandchildren they can adore and spoil.
Just a few things .... erm, uh, I never told you not to leave the Manor. That sounds like a warning. I didn't give you any warnings! Go wherever you want! I just think this time of year the Manor is so lovely! It's most definitely a better place to be than the stuffy old ministry to see Hermione or any of the AURORS. And erm, in the summer do you really think a forest is the best place to be? There are ... mosquitos! And your skin is so sensitive Draco. Plus, erm, malaria. You can't contract malaria when you're pregnant Ollie!
Oh Merlin's wrinkled and hairy arse, Harry! SO MUCH could go wrong! Are we *sure* we can trust her upbringing to *anyone*???
That's what upsets me about you constantly throwing yourself in danger. You ALWAYS say yes and I ALWAYS have to let you go or I'm a controlling monster.
Harry's tour begins.
Good evening,
Eeeek! Viper and Tiger are having a baby! And getting married! And they're in love! I'm so excited for them! I can't even imagine how hard it's going to be to figure out the technical details though. They live in different universes! But I know for a fact that they will make some gorgeous babies. And the Tiger is smooooooooth; "Are you admitting you love me?" "HOW COULD I NOT?" So sweet and romantic. Not quite as smooth, sweet, and romantic as MY man, but I suppose he's a good second choice.
Shortly after that, we brought our newest daughter home and put her in therapy.
I know it was the day after Halloween, but I decided to show the greatest Halloween movie of all time; Hocus Pocus. Wasn't it amazing? I know I know, the portrayal of witches in muggle movies is quite terrible. They get nothing right. It's insulting to wizard kind. But I can't help it, it's so funny. And the song Sarah Sanderson sings to lure the children? It's so beautiful. I think you should learn to sing it, I would let you take me away into a land of enchantment!
Draco
"Oh?" Oliver asked curiously.
Sorry, I mean, "spend time with the children." Yeah, I'm onto you Malfoy.
He shook his head. "I honestly have no idea why, but whenever I see your cousin, my mind goes utterly blank."
Right now I am just playing, so whenever you wake up, read this, and send Muffy to get Viona, I will do my rounds and come right home to spend some time with my family. I'm thinking a picnic lunch in bed? I have already made us a basket of finger foods like I did for our first date. I will pamper you, and feed you any weird mixture of foods you can think to put together.
When she eventually fell on her little padded booty, she turned to us and we gave her the cheering happy reaction she was looking for. She walked herself back to the bed where I picked her up and put her in your lap. You heaped tons of praise on her, she preened like she knew just how deserving of praise she is. She's certainly a Malfoy, preening like a peacock! She's going to be so spoiled, I saw you and her big brothers just going gooey eyed over her proud little face. Good thing my stern self will be there to make sure she's humble.

**Trigger Warning** Witness account of a potential abduction
Charlie chuckled. "I remember that. Sort of. I had to ask a couple of friends of mine to pick Norberta up when she got too big for Hagrid to keep and fly her to Romania. She was one of the few dragons that actually seemed relatively friendly to humans. Not like you could keep her as a pet and fly on her back friendly, but maybe you wouldn't be burned to a crisp and eaten within the first five minutes of meeting her friendly. I once considered getting a tattoo of her on my arm, but opted for a Chinese Fireball instead."
"Those would probably work," you admitted with a shrug. "But we used Gillyweed."
Even as I watched you, I had one eye on the dance floor. One woman in particular was dancing all on her own, and even though she was clearly close to being bladdered, she was dancing better than anyone else there. I was definitely interested in dancing with her at some point - maybe after a discretely cast sobering charm.

They find out for certain who the father of Baby C is.
All right, maybe that's not so surprising. It doesn't seem to take much to get the Kids to sing. I just remember a *lot* of students back in Hogwarts who'd rather choke on their bacon sandwiches than sing. *Especially* where anyone could hear them. I used to find it a lot of fun, actually, to sneak up on timid kids who didn't realize I could hear them singing to themselves, and then have Greg and Vince help me make fun of them.
Aren't you so excited about the birth of our upcoming .... child? Can you even handle how ready you are to dress them in little .... clothes? Can you believe our current ratio of boys to girls is going to .... be different?
You know, I was angry for you when your student accused you of sexual harassment. You are flirty and ridiculous, but only ever with people who are one hundred percent willing and able to consent. With the exception of doing things with me while I sleep, but that has been explicitly consented to prior to it ever taking place, so that doesn't count. In all our years together there have been many people who think we are over the top with our PDA. And, to be fair, they're not wrong. But sexual harassment is a completely baseless accusation.
Then it was time for the dancing. I gather that's when you propositioned Dean and Seamus. Also, apparently the Viper and Tiger overheard you and wanted to get in on the action. You even explained what exactly we planned to do and all parties agreed.
"Oi, keep your nose out of it, mutt!" I called back to you.
Love always,
Eighteen years my love. The eighteen best years of my life.
We're going to go completely magic-free ... except for the fact that our bodies are magical ... and our magi-mobiles. That way you and the other kids can still get ahold of us. Plus I'm super excited for Skype sessions where your Dragon Flu symptoms are broadcasted to our mobiles!
Maybe I should message Ron and see if 'Mione needs anything.
Harry
He chuckled. "So... when can we go to that club?"
You were right about Dylan's skin being paler than it might end up. Just in the few days since his birth, his skin has already gotten a bit darker. Even if we wanted to lie to him, or if Dean never wanted to be honest about his paternity, it would be hard to hide Dylan's other biological father. I think he looks so much like Dean. It's a good thing Dean's such a handsome bloke huh? But Dylan's eyes are pretty darn light, they're actually lighter than Gabriel's, so I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up with your beautiful smoky eye color.
Love you,
Molly Weasley II
As opposed to Iran's demographics, or at least the areas Jaz's family lives, which are a little less magic-happy.
"It's where you belong," Viona and Eris joined in.
"It may not be standard at the onset of menstruation, but I have daughters, so I can tell you that they do have things inserted in them at times during basic exams. They probably don't even think to question this," I explained.
"I volunteer to go help out in the kitchen!" You cried out happily. "I can even bake a batch or two of your favorite biscuits while I'm at it!"
He was stroking his chin in thought. "So... is there any other reason that you might have confused how young you were?"
I promise to you both right now, I will never make such a huge medical decision on my own ever again. If I ever feel like I need to make some sort of change I will only ever do that under the careful eye of one of our trusted medical team.
I probably lit up at that. "Normally, under ANY other circumstances, I'd just agree and get to work on that with you, but we have a bit of a situation here that prevents me from agreeing without discussing it with my husband - yes Harry Potter now MALFOY, and also our husband Oliver Wood."
