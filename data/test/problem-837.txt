Severus flicked his wand to a wall of books and a yelp sounded as a hidden door flew open to reveal a narrow staircase and a weasley man. Wormtail wrung his hands, one of which was covered in a gleaming silver glove. Severus sneered at him, and called for some elf-wine before dismissing the other man.
Soon ‘It Was Written’ came to an end and Draco dressed it in it’s sleeve before putting on a mixtape he made. He hoped Eir liked it - he was still struggling with the technology.
Draco almost fell out of the open window, his heart jack-hammering against his chest as he dropped the half-finished cigarette. “Fuck, fuck, fuck.” He muttered under his breath, not wanting to see who it was that had caught his doing something so distinctly Muggle-ish.
God, it was like his mind was truly trying its hardest to make it seem as though everything was against him. It was as if all rational thought had been pushed aside. It was becoming increasingly difficult for Draco to breathe.
Salazar, he just hated the way she was looking at him, like he was some sort of pitiful creature that needed saving.
Draco liked Niamh’s various silver rings that lined the tips of her ears, so he asked for one of those. When Niamh asked which earring he wanted, Draco pointed to a simple, small gold hoop at the back of a cabinet. Niamh reached inside for the earring, and then cleaned his ears with an antiseptic wipe. Draco prepared for the pain ahead.
Draco stepped towards Borgin lifting his left sleeve, his Bite exposed. Greyback’s name rolled off his tongue. Borgin’s eyes widened in shock as he stuttered apologies, suddenly very keen to help. He regretted it almost immediately, but he needed the extra edge.
Maybe it was just his upcoming transformation that was making Draco feel so on edge - or his tickling suspicion that someone was watching him -  but he was getting sick of Borgin’s half-hearted excuses and desperately wanted to leave.
Harry rocked back on his feet and took a long look at him before disappearing. Draco followed his ghastly scent out of the train and towards the school. When they rounded the corner, Professor Flitwick was waiting with a quill and clipboard. He raised one eyebrow before smoothing his expression.
Potter didn’t, his mouth twisting unpleasantly, "There's something different about you this year, Malfoy, and I'm sure I know why. I've been watching you, you're always lurking about, acting suspicious."
The trek up to the Owlery was obscenely long — and involved far too many stairs. Draco made his way up to the tall tower in less than ten minutes, his breath coming out in short, shallow pants and his heart pounding in his temples.
Potter looked at Draco as if he had just spoken in Mermish. Draco, horrified, felt his cheeks getting hot.
The muggle clothes he had collected over the summer had been rescued by Polky and stored in the elves' kitchen yesterday. So he lay in bed glassy eyed, dressed in a robe. It itched.
Niamh brushed his hair and dried it with a hair dryer - something Draco had never used before. She sat behind him and Draco felt especially warm and comfortable, like a cat. Eir grinned at them from the sofa.
Draco kept his head down and ignored the vicious looks he and his mother were receiving - the nasty comments muttered under other wizards’ breaths as they pushed through the throng. Everyone knew about Lucius’ arrest, and they all had something to say about Draco’s appearance. Draco was sure they all believed he had received the Dark Mark — sold his soul to a diabolical cause.
“You don’t know this song? It’s ‘With A Little Help From My Friends’ by The Beatles! It’s a fucking classic, man!”
“You were taking your time with your hand up someone else’s shirt though, weren’t you?” Greg cackled.
N.E.W.Ts were starting and schedules were due tomorrow. As well as his first official day of attempting to assassinate Dumbledore. Draco breathed in through his nose and sighed into the bed before getting up and unpacking his trunk. The walkman and cassettes were quickly stored in his designated sock drawer, as well as his eyeliner and mascara. He hid the rest of his muggle items and grabbed his wash stuff. A hot shower was needed.
Blaise agreed through a mouth full of ice cream and brownie, and Draco grinned in return. Pansy rolled her eyes and bit down on a smile as she took another spoonful of custard-coated crumble. “So, how long do we think Snape’s gonna last as the Dark Arts teacher?” She asked. “I mean, the others have only ever lasted a year. If that.”
Sorry its taken sooooo long to upload! Life's really just got in the way, I went to India and began my last year of school (the IB is killing me) whilst my lovely co-creator was looking for a place to live in London and began her second year of uni! Plus, it turns out we both HATE writing conflict... Anyways, hope you enjoyed the angst-filled chapter that this was ;)))
Draco stood for a moment in the alley - the full moon was coming up and his anxiety was at its peak. Everything felt onerous: he needed to get this job done, visit Eir and Niamh, do some pre-reading for his NEWTs and figure out how to murder one of the most powerful wizards of all time…
On Friday Draco was escorted to the elves’ kitchen and hastily shoved into muggle clothes before being apparated into the Glass Onion. The almighty crack caused Eir and Niamh to jump before bewilderment at the sudden appearance of the slumped figure took over. Draco had lost all care for the Wizarding World over the last week and had decided to minimize his walking by apparating directly into the store. He couldn’t care less if Muggles found out about magic. Muggles had never hurt him.
The song at the beginning of the chapter is I Can't Go To Sleep by Wu-Tang Clan. Would recommend that you listen to it w headphones - chilling.
was a smart way to go about it. Draco didn’t need to be told that him on his lonesome in a class of Gryfindors was a bad idea, but he loved Potions, so it was worth it.
He waited alone outside the classroom, leaning against the wall as he watched the rest of his classmates arrive. The Gryffindors ignored his brooding and waited in chattering groups closer to the door. Draco’s fellow Slytherins stood apart from their red-and-gold clad peers, but no one went beyond acknowledging his presence.
Draco’s entire body seized up and he crashed to the floor screaming. He had never felt such pain before. His transformation, in comparison, was like a pin prick. Narcissa was yelling at his father but he couldn’t hear. It could have been seconds or hours until the pain stopped. His body shook like a leaf.
Draco wasn’t paying attention as he turned a corner and ran straight into someone, causing him to get a faceful of armpit. And, consequently, a whiff of some truly awful BO.
Pansy snapped out of her reverie to look down at her hand, which was covered in the sticky sweetness of melted strawberry and peanut butter ice cream. “Eugh, Salazar. How did this happen?”
Slowly easing the teen into a sitting position, he edged the fleece over his head and supported his weight with his arms. He then lifted the boy to his feet, and was grateful to see the fleece had preserved his modesty until his knobbly knees. A few shaky steps and they were in the van and off to the GP’s house with four pints of milk and a medical emergency.
Draco awoke in the comfort of his mahogany bed at Yarrow Manor. He couldn’t remember the previous night, it was like he had a mild case of amnesia. It’d been like this the last time too. He could just about summon fragments of memories, remember only the scents of the forest and the coppery taste of warm blood.
Inside the van, the were drums sounding and the choir was screeching at full volume, when John noticed a gory, dislocated arm swing over the wall a few yards in front of his van. Throwing his tea in the air, swearing profusely as the scalding liquid seeped into his workmen’s jeans, he gripped the steering wheel with both hands and promptly veered off the road into the ditch.
” Harry allowed the S’s to hiss out of his mouth in a way he knew Dragana loved. Dragana felt her cheeks start to warm and felt Harry’s body shake as he chuckled.
“Of course not, Professor,” Harry and Draco said in unison and Professor McGonagall’s face broke into a wide grin.
“Sod off,” Dragana muttered, but she wasn’t irritated in the slightest. Now that she was certain of the
Draco frowned and Susan flushed and glanced quickly between him and Harry, not keeping eye contact for more than a couple of seconds.
Harry didn’t move, nor speak, as if considering Draco’s final words. Then he took another step forward, back to the House of Black, and shut the door firmly.
Harry and Draco spend Christmas by the fire in the Room of Requirement the first year they're working at Hogwarts as professors. Things get steamy ;) (Don't worry, there will be a part two of this coming soon!) (Rated: M/Explicit)
“Well, every choice you make will lead to so-called good and bad outcomes. And what you learn from each of those outcomes is going to help you make more choices for the future which will lead to even more choices!” Draco noticed Harry staring at him. The former Gryffindor still did that sometimes, and Draco liked to tease that he was just as disarming to Harry as he was at Hogwarts. He glared at Harry lovingly, puckering his lips at the same time and the slightly shorter man lifted his head to kiss Draco.
It's Day 22 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry! It's the beginnings of a super fluffy wonderful date in Hogsmeade <3 xo I promise, one day soon we will have more of this date!
“So…what are you up to?” Draco asked. He remembered his scheme, sure. But he had to lead up to it; it was only logical.
“We are honored that you have chosen to spend Christmas with Dragana and me as we celebrate many new transitions and traditions in our lives together. We moved in together six months ago, and at first, I must admit, it was a little tough—”
“I KNOW YOU KNOW I’M HERE, HARRY!” He shouted at the muggle dwellings, Number 12 still hidden behind the wards that
“A beautiful sight… we’re happy tonight…walking in a winter wonderland!” Harry took his husband’s hand and spun him around, their kids giggling at their sides.
, Ginny thought bitterly, but she bit her tongue again. If they were going to have this conversation, and if they were going to have this conversation on Christmas Eve, it was going to be done as tactfully as possible. Ginny hoped.
“Not Hufflepuffs?” Malfoy asked, and Harry noticed his deep slate grey eyes were twinkling with curiosity.
“Yes, please,” Harry said with a broad yet shaky grin. “I am looking to purchase two sets of Wixmas Crackers from you but—er—for one of them I’d like to…customize it?”
Draco turned to Harry and grinned, shaking his head. Harry was always showing off with that fancy trick of his. But risking it around muggles didn’t always thrill Draco in the same way it did Harry.
Harry clutched Draco close to him as the other man’s grunts and moans filled the Room and he came inside Harry.
Draco renewed his laughter, and Harry joined him, shaking his head in disbelief. “A Malfoy, really? In public, like this?” Harry’s tone was light and playful.
“You’re right, but honestly… I can’t believe that wixen aren’t researching that and developing technology-friendly enchantments yet!” Hermione said, throwing her hands in the air in exasperation.
He couldn’t believe it had taken them so long to do something that felt so natural, as if their very magic had been crying out for each other for years and now they had finally connected. Draco licked Harry’s upper lip ever so softly, encouraging the other man to open up. Their tongues brushed against each other for the first time, and it was like coming home. No home Draco had ever known. It was like a million tiny things were finally coming into place and it was clear now, that they were meant to be together.
The two of them had just started their prospective teaching jobs at Hogwarts—Harry in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Draco in Potions. After the war, Harry had been inspired to keep teaching others as opposed to being out on the frontlines like he’d had to be his whole life. Last Autumn, Harry had encouraged his new boyfriend to consider applying for the other open vacancy at Hogwarts—Potions. It was perfect for him, and the former Slytherin only needed a little convincing. Harry knew that Draco had the potential to be a fantastic teacher. Draco
As much as he wanted to tell Draco to shut up and stop teasing… Harry had to admit it turned him on.
“No,” Ginny repeated firmly, finally starting to wrap her thoughts and feelings around what Harry was truly confessing to her.
’s security under Harry’s charms, she pulled her hair loose from her ponytail, her long silver-blonde hair rushing past her shoulders and landing in delicate curls. “Nearly ready.”
and Dragana was not convinced that this was the smartest idea her reckless Gryffindor had ever had. Granted, Harry'd had way worse.
Ginny blinked. It hadn’t been she who had spoken. It was Harry. He was still looking at the tree, the Christmas lights reflecting in his glasses.
“Let’s keep reading, I’m sure the answers are in here somewhere…” Draco flipped the pages carefully but quickly, obviously scanning the pages and not reading them in full.
Harry turned to the first page of full text and read aloud: “‘This journal belongs to Rowena Ravenclaw, one of four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Inside this journal I shall document the process of establishing the first great school for all magical folk living in Britannia, Caledonia, and Hibernia. It is my hope that one day this journal will be found and the true story behind this glorious Wizarding historical event can be revealed.’”
It’s Day 11 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry, and I continue to be surprised by the shenanigans these two keep getting into! The inspiration for this fic was of course the lovely Traditional Prompt Number 11 (the Hogwarts clock tower encapsulated in ice, surrounded by snow) but also this new Scandenavian tradition I learned about today called “Broom Hiding.” From my grandmother’s digital advent calendar. Let me tell you, she would not be pleased with what her gift has inspired, but I am SO EXCITED to share this with y’all. Enjoy!
Harry said nothing, but swept Draco’s blond hair back with his free hand. It had grown exceptionally long in the last months, as Draco had no desire to cut it, enjoying the longer style.
“Anyway, the portraits seem to be a major clue here. In the last couple weeks, I’ve seen dozens of portraits change.”
“Yes, for Merlin’s sake let’s go!” Harry placed his hand in the other man’s and gently turned on his heel, apparating himself and his lover to "Harrodz," a wizarding department store that closely resembled the muggle "Harrods."
been forced to tutor him during their 8th year together, and Harry had even qualified for the Auror exam (even though he later decided not to take it).
Harry mumbled something under his breath, but shuffled over to his Draco and leaned in to kiss his lips.
reverberating off the stone walls and making Malfoy jump. “Oh, for fuck’s sake, Malfoy! Wasn’t it obvious I didn’t want the attention? I never wanted to do any of that bullshit.”
“You think it’s a good thing then that those Gryffinpuffs’ new common room has randomly appeared in the dungeons then?”
Harry cleared his throat so as to give the guests a chance to hide their own laughter with hacks and coughs at carefully curated interludes.
Harry felt tears burn behind his eyes, threatening to fall. He clasped his hand over his mouth and turned away, attempting to hide his face from them all. Harry tried to even his breath and ride through the wave of grief.
Draco had always meant to keep up with him. Send an owl at Yule or something…but he never did. And then, eventually, it was too late. He’d missed his window, and Harry obviously hadn’t seemed interested in kindling any sort of friendship following the trial or
“Apparently. Installing plumbing seems to be the only renovation Hogwarts has had in the past 1000 years. It’s almost like a breath of fresh air that things are finally moving around a little bit, even if we’re not sure why.”
Harry heard the pink-haired wix working the kiosk say: “Happens all the time! Look here—” They took out their wand, made some flourishing swishes and flicks and said, “Schurnulus!” Bright purple strands of magic wound their way around the garment to find the chocolate splashes. It started to glow and hum as the light from the magic banished the chocolate stains, leaving a  fresh lilac scent, wafting off in small puffs of leftover magical energy. Harry thought it looked rather like a muggle iron had just released a bunch of steam over the garment.
Harry scoffed. “Prat.” But there wasn’t any malice behind the word, and Malfoy continued as if Harry hadn’t said anything.
(Picture of the next two pages describing the "Broom Hiding" tradition: Some Scandinavian traditions encourage early preparation for Christmas; the hiding of all cleaning implements is a symbolic act to remind families to rest from work and enjoy the holiday. Alternatively, some versions fo the stories actively suggest placing the brooms outside--so that a passing witch might make use of it to clean up. All non-Scandinavians, however, should bear in mind that Scandinavians love to tell stories so as to confuse gullible foreigners.)
"Our song is the way you laugh. Embarrassed at first, not sure if you should take up any space and then finally letting go and allowing your voice to ring like a beautiful melody. Our song is…the first time we kissed. I should’ve kissed you so much sooner, but this kiss…it was so special, Dray. Like our magic was finally coming together, like it had been calling out to do since we met in Madam Malkin’s all those years ago. Our song is those little breathy moans you made then and still make now every time we kiss. You ssentimental
Harry rearranged to straddle himself over Draco’s bottom half, briefly making contact through his clothes with Draco’s ever-growing bulge under his briefs. His lover jumped at the unexpected touch, but Harry let himself splay his hands across the gorgeous chest in front of him.
Draco rolled his eyes. “You’re not telling me you’ve put a first-year level locking spell on this thing.” He pulled out his wand and murmured, “Alohomora.” The box clicked.
“Would you like to…join us?” Harry invited him, and the Snitches returned to Draco’s stomach in full force.
“Anyways, anyways!” Harry said, and his slightly elevated voice encouraged their guests to quiet down. “Dragana and I are truly embarking on a life together, and…like stories…life is full of unexpected twists and turns.”
“Honestly, it’s done wonders for me—smoking pot I mean, not being in public,” Draco clarified, and Harry’s laughter rang in his ears again. It was one of the most amazing sounds Draco had ever heard.
Summary: Draco has a second surprise for Harry, one that he hasn’t yet mentioned. A grave mistake that he soon realizes as the Adventmarkt am Karlsplatz draws to a close on Christmas Eve.
And then Harry found his eyes glancing down towards Draco’s lips and back again. When Draco did the same, Harry closed the distance between them and kissed him.
Dragana shook her head in disbelief at the situation—then realized what she was doing in response to Harry’s proposal and stopped mid-shake. “I can’t believe you fucking did this.
Harry is feeling down that his friend Draco can’t make it to the Silver Stag’s Yule Ball. But from the moment the beautiful Dragana walks over to him, he’s enraptured by her confidence and radiant beauty and he soon forgets there’s anyone else at all..
A couple guests let out a chuckle and then Harry continued. “You are the most determined and cunning person I have ever met. But you’re also incredibly brave and honest. You are inquisitive. Patient. Loyal. Trustworthy. And kind. You are more than that pompous Slytherin prat you were at Hogwarts. You are…soooooo complex—”
But Draco wasn’t really listening. In fact, he seemed to be contemplating something, and finally he spoke again. “I guess, if you think about it, it’s kind of like Hogwarts is doing those First-Years a favor, messing with them like that. And honestly, I kind of enjoy the fact that the layout of Hogwarts is changing, and the portraits, too. After the Battle, I welcome the change, you know what I mean? Like...we can get away from all that and actually move on.”
Draco couldn’t help but let out a laugh, partly from nerves, but partly at the absurdity of Potter’s threat.
Draco chuckled. “A Malfoy would never. Actually, I have to confess that you chose the gift I was planning on giving you last.”
“Augh!” Ron groaned. “My brain can’t take any more. One Hermione was enough, now I’ve also got Draco to contend with.”
Harry shook his head. “I figured they were probably just some bookish wix that discovered something important, or
They enjoyed a moment of stillness of Midnight, connecting with the Elements around them, and released their New Moon intentions into the darkness.
“Oh, Harry, please,” Draco begged, “My dearest love, I don’t know if my ears can take it!” Draco teased Harry.
Ginny leant back against one of the two early Christmas presents she’d received from her mom: a pillow with fancy script and the words: “Wake me up when winter ends.” The second pillow was on the other side of the sofa and simply said: “Brrrrrrrrrrrr.” Ginny remembered her mother gifting her the pillows on the Solstice. Mum had hinted that she’d done some tricky charmwork on the thread as she’d sewn so the pillows would give off a soft magical pulse of calm.
“Well, for instance, mealtimes have been pushed later and later since the beginning of term. And when a plate is empty, it takes ages to refill, if it does at all.”
So. First of all, yes, this fic was indeed inspired by One Direction's "Tell me a Lie" if that wasn't painfully clear to some of you bahahahaha. And yes, I was listening to the song on repeat as I wrote this piece LOL. And yes, this is Day 5 of the 25 Days of Draco and Harry and it is written from……….. Ginny Weasley's point of view.
Harry lifted his head from Draco’s chest and noticed the blond was smiling down at him. Harry returned the grin and brought his lips up to meet Draco’s. Draco moaned into his kiss, parting his lips to let Harry in.
Harry’s grin turned slightly evil. Playfully evil. He remembered June 5th of this year quite well. He had tied Draco up with some magical ropes and gagged him with his old Gryffindor tie. What a brilliant idea, Harry thought mischievously, and wasn’t surprised at all when a nicely folded tie appeared on the blanket in front of them. Draco groaned, feeling outnumbered.
Draco trusted him. Harry was smart enough to know he wouldn’t take them all the way to the Room of Requirement for anything that wasn’t meant to be just for the two of them to see.
magic was particularly strong during the Advent season. As a child, she used to feel her natural, untrained magic sizzling whenever the temperature finally dropped for good and winter had arrived. Even now, as she listened to the fire crackling in the fireplace, she inhaled the scent of freshly baked gingerbread cookies on the plate next to her, and took in the magnificence of Mum's first homegrown tree. It was clear to Ginny that her magic was in a heightened state this evening, boosted by all the magic of the festive season.
Yes, the Weasleys had always allowed him to crash during the holidays ever since he became friends with Ron—and he loved them dearly for it. But now that Harry finally had Draco—yes, finally—he was ready to start his own traditions. Draco already had some fond memories and traditions to draw on for inspiration, but this was something Harry realized he had lacked during the most formative years of his life, until he left for Hogwarts.
“What are you going to wish for, my love?” Harry asked Draco while readjusting Scorpius’ hat as it was threatening to slip over his eyes.
To top it off, there were two accessories: a black pointed witch’s hat and an ankle length cape that tied with a simple but elegant velvet ribbon around the neck.
Harry sensed Draco's grin widening as the image was passed to him. He continued to add to the scene, adding the memory of the scent of Evergreen pine...
Their own boys were now eight years old and had been casting the spell with the support of their dads for the past two years now, but they were optimistic they’d be able to hold their own power this year.
Dragana jumped in. “Well, with a house that hadn’t been redecorated since the 80s, I really had my work cut out for me.”
Finally, Draco whispered, “Could you please get these off me, love? They’re starting to dig in uncomfortable places, and I need to rest.”
But he was pulled out of his musings about the evils of capitalism by the child exclaiming happily and ecstatically pointing at the jumper, which was good as new. The pink-haired wix grinned, obviously pleased at having sparked so much joy in the child. They were now gazing at the garment in astonishment, telling their parents to come look.
Under the table, Draco placed his hand on Harry’s leg and every nerve in Harry’s body fixated on the sensation. He knew no one else could see the gesture. What was Draco doing? Harry forced himself to look at Draco, and the sympathy emitting from the other man warmed Harry from the inside out.
Real talk: I had a very personal, emotional, spiritual experience while writing this chapter. I guess I had some trauma there I didn’t know I was going to dive into today, and I’m so glad I had the opportunity to do so. More smut will come later in the month (supposedly, lol! I sure hope so, but we will see what’s in the cards hahaha ^^)
, the patron saint this church was built to commemorate who was revered as a healer for plague sufferers.”
“There’s got to be information in here about the castle itself, and her role in making Hogwarts... well, Hogwarts—Aha! Here it is.” Hermione placed the book in the center of the table and they all bent their heads around to read along with her.
“It was fucking brilliant,” Draco said, kissing Harry in the center of his chest, then meeting his eyes.
Suddenly, Harry’s cock was surrounded by the hot wetness of Draco’s mouth—and it was the most intense pleasure Harry had ever felt. He felt his legs start to give out from under him, and tangled his fingers in Draco’s hair once again to steady himself.
Draco had to laugh at himself—grateful he was at a place in his life now that he didn’t have to die in embarrassment but could enjoy this little blunder. Not very Slytherin-like, he had to admit. Draco rolled his eyes at himself.

Yes. While you were taking your sweet time touring the portrait gallery, I realized that Gryffindor’s had just completely vanished.”
“Fuck proper timing,” Harry mumbled. Draco wasn’t sure he’d heard correctly, so he asked the other wix to repeat himself. “I said FUCK proper timing. When has the timing ever been right for us?”
Draco nodded. “You don’t have to be sorry. I’m just… wigged out by this whole thing, to be honest. Of course, I’ve always known there are true Seers out there, but I’ve always put it to the back of my mind. It just all seems...so unnatural. When someone knows something they’re not ‘supposed’ to know. Like they’re breaking the laws of the universe of something.”
Having never done this before, Draco feigned nonchalance as, with trembling fingers, he attempted to strike the match. Watching a few more of Draco’s attempts, Eir took the matches and lit the cigarette for him.
For the first time since he was eleven, Draco was nervous for his return to Hogwarts. He splashed his face with cold water and ran a bath. The usual thrum of excitement that normally accompanied the end of summer was well and truly dead this time. All that was left were butterflies raging in Draco’s stomach. He sighed in relief as he climbed into the steaming tub.
Hope you guys are coping well at the moment! We are fine and apologise for our less-than-satisfactory uploading "schedule".
It was a while until Blaise finally made their return, at which point there was much commotion as Blaise made repeated failed attempts to close the door before toppling backwards into Vincent, the door sliding close with ease. Draco furrowed his brows at the sight of something streak through the air above them, and suppressed a groan as his nose picked up a familiar scent.
He felt like death incarnate as his head throbbed along to the pounding of his heart and his hair clung to his sweaty forehead.
“Maybe.” Draco felt awful, what kind of a shitty person was he? Merlin, he just wanted to crawl into bed and hide under the covers for eternity. Because of fucking course it would be so simple for Lovegood, she was there at the Ministry in June, she was a
Also, we haven't mentioned it in a while but we have a playlist that you can listen to! Its called 'i never sleep cos sleep is the cousin to death' (original, we know), use the url below!
“Oh, she died when I was little.” Draco looked over at Luna, her face strangely serene. “I’m sorry.”
His breaths were coming out in short, shallow pants. He clutched at his chest. Draco barely registered Luna laying him down across the seats, her soft voice muting the all-encompassing pain. Draco thought he was dying.
Narcissa took in the black, wavy hair and smudged eyeliner. Her pristine boy was visibly not so, and after all the trouble she had gone to to ensure his survival in the year ahead, she was rather miffed.
Eir leaned over and spiked Draco’s hair up, and they dissolved into fits of laughter. Niamh ran out of the room and returned with Eir’s beaten up instant camera, and captured the two laughing in the bathtub. As Eir smudged the dye onto his face, Niamh took another photo of the three of them. The next half an hour resulted in a dozen photos and a filthy tub.
“You’ve got to make the most of Sunday Lunch, Parkinson.” Draco raised his hands in surrender. “I don’t make the rules.”
The summer has come to an end, and as Draco prepares for his return to Hogwarts, he's faces a grave new reality.
Draco was mute, and shook his head. He’d already said too much. Lucius began to pace in circles, drawing them further into the library. In the light of the room, Draco was able to take in more of his father’s appearance. Draco could see that his father’s hair was slick due to a lack of care, as it hung lank and flat around his sunken face. Lucius’ eyes were dull and his cheeks had hollowed out slightly, giving him a sickly appearance.
Draco found he was still on high alert from the night before, his senses sharp and clear. The faint, lingering smell of his mother’s perfume told him that she had only just recently left him. The sheets beside him felt warm from someone else’s body heat - she had been watching him.
A clatter of books behind him made Draco jump and whip around his seat, wand raised. Almost forgetting, he hastily ripped off his headphones.
“If you are imagining I can persuade the Dark Lord to change his mind, I am afraid there is no hope, none at all.”
The trees thinned as they made their way up the hillside. From this position, Draco could see the stars, all the constellations. Sirius burned brightly against the velvety black.
Draco nodded. Never having had a job before, too demeaning for a Malfoy, he decided that this suited this new chapter of his life.
Draco knew how his friends would react if he told them the truth about what had happened over the summer, and the anxiety hung like a rain cloud at the back of his mind. They couldn’t ever find out, it would be detrimental to Draco’s whole future if anyone actually did. And, if he was correct about his suspicions of Snape being a Legilimens, then he needed to learn how to defend himself. For present and future use. Maybe he should send a letter home, get some help from his mother over the half term? Yes, he would send his mother a letter after they finish their tea.
Narcissa learnt quickly when she was a teen that any contradiction to the Dark Lord’s beliefs quickly shut up Bellatrix. Now she was a gaping fish trying to get words out. It was an improvement. She tried to carry on walking, it was nearing the time of the meeting, but Bella’s hold on her arm was vice like.
“He’s still asleep? Greg get your arse out now, we’re going to miss breakfast and getting our timetables.”
Draco listened to his friends whine about the Gryffindors for a little while longer, his heart not completely in it when he offered up his own insulting remarks. But thankfully, he was spared continuing the conversation as the food soon disappeared, and they stood up to leave.
The bickering and sulking had continued until the trolley witch came around, and they were all sated with pumpkin pasties. The conversation drifted back to holiday stories and speculations about the upcoming N.E.W.T classes they’d be starting that year. No one mentioned the return of Voldemort.
Draco felt attacked, as if Luna were trying to undermine him. Because, if he were honest, he didn’t think he would’ve helped if it were the other way round.
“Sorry - that was a weird thing to say.” Draco offered a weak smile. “I just, um, well - I’m going back to school in a few days, and I just wanted to come and say goodbye. And, I…” He trailed off, wringing his hands.
“Hello Draco, I hope you’re feeling better.” Draco turned around to find himself face to face with Luna Lovegood. Draco groaned, painfully aware of his friends staring.
Horrified, he locked the doors and revved the engine to escape the shrubbery, when he found his eyes locked with a rather red pair of teenage ones. The boy had landed in the ferns below and was yelling a series of strange obscenities before panting and lying still. John was frozen in his seat with shock, watching the boy’s shallow breaths condense in the morning air.
It stung Draco to hear the slurs and hateful verses in the music he enjoyed, as they frequently used queerness as the punchline. He’d never really thought about his sexuality, over the years he’d learned to suppress his wandering emotions, and before meeting Eir, the shame of his lycanthropy had pushed those conflicting feelings to the back of his mind.
stuff going on, he was meant to keep topping his classes. Draco was an ambitious student, but the pressure of the task at hand was almost too much to bear, and he worried about the attention failing classes would garner.
“Who are you, and what have you done to the biggest twat of all time, Draco Malfoy?” Potter stared him down from the luggage rack. Draco’s heart beat wildly in his chest — his hair, piercings and use of Eir’s language were pretty fucking huge signals to his change in character. The idea of ‘keeping a low profile’ in the coming year now seemed pretty laughable.
The topic of homosexuality and the AIDS epidemic had been of great interest to Draco, and Eir was more than willing to discuss it. The intersection of music, drugs and sexuality was a convenient crossroad that they would often find themselves at. Eir had plenty of stories about his time hopping from couch to couch, in multiple rehab centres and A and E, a number of them about AIDS sufferers and their life advice. Eir told him that people become very wise when they know they’re going to die, a beautiful side effect he thought. Draco asked about a cure and Eir laughed and said there wasn’t, and that recently a pill came out that was being used to increase the life expectancy, but it had terrible effects. In the wizarding world, muggle afflictions weren’t an issue, a spell or potion had you sorted, no side effects, no epidemics.
The door of the Glass Onion swung open and sent the wind chimes into song as Draco shuffled into the shop. Over the last few weeks he had learnt how to use the till, muggle money and the record player as well as what a junkie was and how very similar it was to his furry little problem.
With immense effort, Draco heaved his aching body upright. He swayed slightly as blood rushed to his head, momentarily blurring his vision. In the bath, Draco breathed in the calming scent of lavender, revelling in the way the bath oils softened and soothed his skin. He waited until the water turned cold, and his fingers turned to prunes before getting out.
Draco wasn’t completely proud of his initial reaction. He had listened to Blaise and tried to be supportive, but it had —selfishly— hurt and pissed him off to know that after years of friendship, Blaise hadn’t actually talked to him about what they’d been going through. By second year, Blaise knew everything about Draco, so it didn’t feel fair.
Sighing, Draco looked out at the rest of the classroom, watching dust particles float suspended in patches of afternoon sunlight. His eyes wandered over to the Gryffindor students as they whispered amongst each other, heads bowed in case Snape might look up from his desk.
“You gonna hex me, or are you just gonna glare at me until I disappear?” Potter smirked, dimples forming in his brown skin. Draco’s neck prickled, uncomfortably hot.
Draco watched as Gryffindors and Slytherins filled the rows of desks, each house keeping to themselves. Insults were hurled back and forth from Gryffindors and Slytherins alike. Draco groaned inwardly, already willing time to move faster. When Snape declared that it was a theory lesson, and that they should get their books out, Draco felt ready to spontaneously combust.
“Well, what do you all think?” He didn’t even try to hide his anxiety — they would see through it anyway.
, I don’t need your help! I don’t know what happened, but it wasn’t serious and it probably won’t happen again, so yeah. Thanks but just leave me alone, okay?”
Narcissa spilt a little wine on herself as she set her glass down and gripped Severus' hands between her own. She bowed her head to their hands and kissed them.
Eir pulled out his match box of papers and dried out tobacco, and placed a filter in his ear. Draco was aware that Eir was unsure about how to answer, as he waited about two fags before he finally did.
So Draco is finally at school! From the frying pan and into the fire. Sorry it took a  w h i l e  to upload, this is a true slow-burn. Thank you for sticking with us and we hope you enjoy this chapter! :)))
Draco felt uneasy stepping into Yarrow Manor that evening. The fresh piercing was now a dull ache at the side of his head and he was contemplating getting a tattoo next week. After they had left the parlour that evening, Niamh, Eir and Draco had then spent too much time and money in the pub. Draco’s head had been pleasantly swimming.
Now, the house closed in around him with it’s pervasive, clammy claws. He was lucky to have Niamh and Eir. Draco pressed himself up against the cold glass, eyes trained on the illuminated garden of kelp below him.
Draco’s heart was beating wildly in his chest. He didn’t want to face his father, didn’t want to learn what his parents had been bickering about. Narcissa looked stunned by her son’s presence, and Draco was sure he looked like a deer caught in the headlights.
From the corner of his vision, Draco could see Potter dithering about beside his desk, torn between escaping to the other side of the classroom and keeping himself in Sluggy’s good books.
But despite this, he just couldn’t bring himself to talk about everything that had happened, because saying it out loud made it real. “Not really.”
“You should’ve gotten one of them letters Draco — that Slughorn’ll see.” Greg nodded, his face grave.
Draco flinched. He still felt sensitive to any and all attacks on his senses, and Niamh’s boom of a shout resembled a dragon’s cry.
“My idiot radar’s going off, I see Potter on the horizon.” Millicent Bulstrode indicated behind Draco.
Draco had thought that this time might have been easier; seen as he had survived the first. But this was worse, much worse. He felt immobilised by the fever-like feeling, he was restless, ravenous.
A couple of days after his transformation, Draco felt infinitely better. Polky had agreed to apparate him to the Glass Onion, and he now stood just off the main road, trying to build up the courage to cross over to the music shop. It had been almost a week since he last saw Eir, and Draco was sure that Eir would think that he’d ‘gone off the rails’ again.
“Fucking hell, Luna.” Potter muttered beside Draco as he moved to climb into the carriage. Draco waited a moment longer before following.
Eir was locking up the store and putting the last few vinyls back in order after Draco and him raided his personal favourites. His mind kept wandering to the kid, sharp and brittle, and undoubtedly a junkie in his mind. Back in Finland when he was a teen, Eir had known plenty friends getting hooked on rocks and silver spoon highs. They were rebelling against winter and the long, long nights they faced. When he came to England he went to Liverpool - cocaine capital - and saw the same escapism, this time driven by class. In Britain, it’s always about class. Draco, Eir decided, wasn’t a privileged ninny or from an estate, but he also wasn’t part of the middle order. The lad was suitably something else, undeniably beaten and frightened.
“What do you mean?” Draco tried to keep his voice level as he swung his legs around to see the intruder.
Narcissa had talked him through various tactics to get what he needed, and so Draco was conscious not to show any sort of anxiety or repulsion when Borgin appeared from the backroom.
Eir knelt in front of him and placed a hand on his shoulder, “Draco, I think you have been on a bad bender. We can get you some help. How ‘bout that?”
Eir had gotten them their tea from the local chippy, made more earl grey than Draco could have and they had worked through most of the Beatles’ discography. Draco had to agree, the Beatles were the best band in history and that - privately - muggle music was better than anything the wizarding world could ever produce.
Once clean, Draco practiced the Muggle makeup and stowed it in his travel cloak. He heard his mother come to his bedroom door and he anticipated her reaction to his new look. Last night, Polky had stealthily deposited him in his room as to avoid Narcissa, alas, there was no avoiding the inevitable. As Eir stated, Narcissa was going to be pissed.
“Let go, Bella!” snarled Narcissa. But Bellatrix wasn’t going to let go anytime soon, and so Narcissa raised her wand.
In the bathroom Draco started the shower and sat under it’s stream. When researching werewolves over the summer, he also began learning about Muggle theories about animals. Surprisingly, he had found it very useful. Him, Eir and Niamh had watched documentaries together about the natural world. They would smoke and then snuggle up on the couch and gaze at the wildlife on the screen. It was following a programme about hippos — a terrifying non-magical animal — that he learnt about the deep-dive instinct. Draco found that running water was especially calming for his affliction.
Draco was just tired of all the stupid school drama and feuds, the ‘rivalry’ he had concocted between himself and Potter. As if he was even on the same playing field. No one would care about him after all was said and done. He’d just be painted as the prejudiced, murderous supremacist. Not to mention a crazed, blood-thirsty werewolf. Draco was most definitely destined for a lifetime in Azkaban, just wishing for a Dementor to go too far, to end his suffering.
Draco cringed at his loud and rambunctious tone. For fucks sake, he sounded like an 80s muggle teen in a John Hughes film. Pansy stared at him but didn't say anything. Draco brushed his hair back and tucked it behind his ear. In a few weeks he would need to dye it again.
A couple gasps escaped people’s mouths as Snape bristled, his bat-like robe seemed to puff out. Pansy whispered in Draco’s ear, “Someone’s gotten too big for their boots.”, and Draco rolled his eyes.
Time seemed to stop for a moment as Lucius reached the doorframe to see his son dressed entirely in muggle fashion. Draco felt asphyxiated as his father looked him up and down. Lucius’ left eye twitched, his lip curling up in a show of disgust.
Draco opened his mouth to protest, but was cut off by Slughorn hobbling into the classroom, effectively stifling the chatter as he made his way to his desk.
After, Draco sulked off to the owlery and climbed over the battlements onto the roof. Behind a spire, he sat down and lit his cig with the end of his wand. From his bag he pulled out his Walkman and headphones. ‘Rumours’ by Fleetwood Mac filled his head and he relaxed.
“So where’ve you been? I had to handle a drunk Niamh by myself on Saturday.” Eir laughed and ducked away from Niamh’s swatting hand.
Niamh collected the photos and split them into three piles, before hauling Eir out of the tub and rinsing Draco’s hair. As he watched the dye wash away, Draco desperately tried to imprint this moment in his mind forever. It was going to be fourteen weeks of hell before he was going to see them again. He missed Pansy and Blaise, Draco had forgotten how much he needed them before seeing them again in Diagon Alley, but Eir and Niamh were an oasis away from the Wizarding World and the upcoming war.
“He’s still here, living and breathing.” Draco raised his hand in mock salute. Potter had the nerve to chuckle. Merlin, what was happening? Whatever it was, he needed to reel it in.
Draco inhaled a breath before his lungs ceased up and he coughed violently for several moments. Bemused, Eir watched him before saying; “Remember to breathe mate, you won’t get your fix if you don’t.”
An awkward shuffle commenced as Draco attempted to move his weighty limbs around Eir and not smear the shower curtain with hair dye. Niamh then proceeded to dye his eyebrows and laugh at his now overly expressive brows.
Draco sulked alone a little longer until Pansy showed up, and they could head into the classroom. Pansy wittered on about her Herbology lesson as they sat at their usual desk in the back corner of the room. Draco was only half listening— he’d been glad to drop Herbology at the end of their fifth year and found it about as interesting as Professor Binns.
Draco had taken many knocks to his confidence over the past months, but this was just the cherry on the cake. He was the best Potions student in their entire year — had been since they were eleven — and so this rejection, on top of every other awful thing that had happened, was a hard pill to swallow.
“What is it now, Potter? Come to tell me you’ve finally worked out my big secret and you’re going to leak it to The Daily Prophet?”
Niamh made a move to grab his arm, to check for needle marks he supposed, but Draco flinched back anyways. All she would find was more gashes and a weird rash from a nettle patch he fell in. Alas, the pain and shame was the same, and the guarded look he gave her silenced any further chastising.
Draco woke himself up by his screaming. Sweating and shaking and spluttering, he frantically turned on his bedside lamp and watched the shadows leave the room.
A week before Hogwarts was due to start, Draco found himself sliding into Knockturn Alley. His business was secret, as were most things now. The complexity of the task his father left him was beginning to show its colours. And by Merlin was it a complicated affair.
In his haste to get away, he forgot all about their game of Hide and Seek until he saw Vince approaching him from further down the corridor.
Draco nodded in response before heading towards the carriages. Potter, of course, stopped to chat to the insufferable professor.
The summer had been a truly difficult time for Narcissa. With his recent transformation, Draco had become much more distant, and seemed to retreat into himself. Narcissa’s heart hurt seeing him fall into such a deep depression, and for him to lose his sense of identity. No longer was he her proud, self-assured son - he had been permanently and fundamentally changed.
The familiar echoing allegretto vivace of heels instinctively straightened Draco’s spine and had him cast his eyes down at the marble floor. Narcissa entered the hall and put the jar beside her son on the table before telling him to apply it every three hours to his abrasions. A pervasive, heavy silence filled the air between them as Draco slipped off the table and stood beside his mother.
Draco felt as if he was drowning outside in Kielder Water when his mother hissed that word. Murder. In a way he wasn’t surprised. He was sure his father had killed someone before and he knew his parents has used the
Narcissa had known, of course, everything that had been going on with Lucius, and the moving of the Dark Lord’s headquarters to the Malfoy Manor. It was with great shame that she never stepped in to stop Lucius from hurting her Draco. Sometimes, Lucius reminded Narcissa of her father.
Eir had chosen this particular record, Illmatic, as it had helped him to define himself after relapsing two years prior. He was under the impression that Draco was himself, going through the same struggle of addiction, and felt that this was important for him to share.
Draco felt bitter at that comment, but rolled his eyes and muttered “Rest assured, the feeling’s mutual.”
The record started spinning, and a hypnotic bassline sounded. By now, Draco recognised Lennon’s voice as he started singing.
“Oh, okay.” Lovegood looked relatively unfazed as she turned away from Draco and towards the rest of the Ravenclaws. Draco sighed in relief.
His mother sounded distressed. “You can’t do this, Lucius… we’ve been punished enough… no redemption…”
Narcissa had always fought back when Lucius was being unreasonable. They balanced each other that way. But recently, she had somehow managed to let Lucius spiral out of control. And over the past weeks, it seemed as though there was no bargaining with him; no way to communicate anymore.
A couple months ago this would’ve worried Draco  — he’d been raised to expect respect and amiability from his peers. However, as the weeks passed, he was seeing more and more classmates distancing themselves from him, watching him with a humiliating mixture of fear and pity. Ever since his father had been incarcerated, and the true extent of the Malfoy’s alliance with the Dark Lord had consequently been revealed, Draco’s classmates had avoided him like the plague.  It was better in the safety of the Slytherin dungeons, but people weren’t keen to be seen with Draco in the rest of the castle. Only his closest friends stuck by him.
Soon they were at the house, she knocked on the door as Bellatrix caught up. For a moment, the smell of the polluted river was all she thought about, but then the faint sounds of movement behind the door caught her attention. It opened a crack and some beady eyes examined her. Narcissa threw back her hood and her long, white blonde hair spoke for her.
When it was time to close up shop, Eir presented him with a homemade mix-tape. He explained that it was some homework for Draco to study, which he felt honoured to do.
“My father is what happened. And- and I apparated.” Draco felt ridiculous, it was just over a week since his father had used the curse on him, and he still felt dizzy and fatigued. Plus, now Eir and Niamh were looking at him like he’d grown a second head.
Narcissa hurried along the bank side path and slipped through a rusty gate to walk between the Muggle dwellings. Bellatrix followed her while constantly protesting about the task at hand: Narcissa ignored her. Their cloaks whipped around them as a gust of wind tunnelled down the alley way. The sisters darted between orange patches of light and deep shadows. Bellatrix finally caught up and implored that he was not trustworthy. Narcissa turned around spat:
Potter scoffed, stumbling over a desk leg as he reached Draco. “Shut up, Malfoy. I know you’re hiding something and I’ll find out what it is.”
“This man seems to have no concept of class — does he know who I am?” Draco inwardly cringed at his tone, but he had committed to it, so he was going to really lay it on thick, just for Potter, even if he could sense that his friends knew something was afoot.
“Panic attacks can be very serious, you know.” Luna fixed Draco with a firm look, her eyes kind. She didn’t quite seem to be getting the message.
“I can’t, I’m not of age. I can only do magic at school.” Draco was aware he was losing his audience, and reached into his pocket, “But I can show you my wand.”
The Sgt. Pepper’s album and it parts were strewn across his counter after Draco’s swift strange departure. The woman, most likely his guardian or social worker, had been strikingly beautiful with sharp cheekbones and thin brows. Eir thought about her and shook his head, there was no compassion between the woman and lad. He grabbed the lyric sheet and a pen clattered on to the floor from between the folds of the paper. Unfolding the sheet, Eir saw that ‘Good Morning Good Morning’ has been underlined from the tracklist and ‘9 am’ written beside it. Several other lines had been marked like ‘It's wonderful to be here’, ‘I admit it's getting better’ and ‘I've got nothing to say but it's OK’. Eir smiled.
Tags/Warnings: Confident Draco Malfoy living his best life, medicinal and recreational marijuana use, years-long pining coming to fruition, so much love and fluff, Draco helped Harry during the Battle of Hogwarts (throwing Harry his wand, etc.)
“How long have you been…well, I’m just assuming you’re… you know… something.” Ron’s ears turned red. “Sorry if that was insensitive. I’m not meaning to
“Draco, you’re starting to scare me a little now.” Without thinking, Harry placed a hand on Draco’s knee. When he realized what he’d done, Harry surprised himself by letting his hand be. “Please,” he said again. “Tell me. Why did you have the sudden need to rush to the dungeons?”
. What you’ve been through. The experiences you’ve had that brought you to the realization that the House system didn’t serve you, or me, or anyone. But particularly us.”
“Okay, so where was I?” Dragana shook her hair loose from where it had gotten caught under her collar, tossing it over her shoulders again, the silver-blonde an intensive highlight to the deep blue of the sapphires.
Draco burst out laughing and hastily spluttered, “I’m sor—I’m sorry, Harry. I was just—” a fit of giggles overtook Draco and Harry glared at him. “I was—I was just kidding! You—you touched my stomach, I swear.”
“Well, it’s pretty well-documented that the founders were all staunch traditionalists,” Draco explained. “I can imagine they would have retorted with an argument along the lines of ‘what’s tried and true will get us through.’”
Draco came first, thanking Harry in gasps as he came, Harry carefully judging his partner's pleasure and pain, alternating between lighter and harder pressure.  A second or so after Draco's cum filled him up and started dripping back down over his own cock, Harry came with a guttural moan.
The bird’s song started up again, and Draco turned towards the sound, searching for the creature in the frozen tree.
She realized Harry was present with her. Ready for anything she wanted to say or didn’t want to say. She said it. “Why?”
Ginny tried to relax into his arms, but she couldn’t help noticing that…he really didn’t smell like himself. She stiffened, and Harry, sensing her shift in comfort, released her, and placed his hands in hers.
That did it. Blood rushed to Harry’s cock which twitched with arousal. His cheeks blazing, Harry thought,
“She didn’t want to leave Hogwarts undefended, so she cast the enchantments in a way that they would remain dormant until Hogwarts deemed itself ready for change.”
Draco continued, “In her prophetic dream, she saw that this would only foster animosity between magical folk.  She knew that this would lead to an increase in Pureblood supremacy. What’s astounding is she predicted the rise of Lord Voldemort and the final battle here at Hogwarts. Ravenclaw believed that it all stemmed from the founders’ decision to divide young wixen into different Houses.”
Dragana narrowed her piercing grey eyes at him. “You just said your Christmas crackers would be better than mine, ‘no if’s, and’s, or but’s.’ Sure sounds like you want to take the reins, Santa!”
Harry took a deep breath and exhaled slowly, trying to release any tension. As he did so, Draco pressed one finger inside him, and Harry gasped at the sensation. He’d touched himself there before but hadn’t yet trusted himself to go much further.
He extricated himself from Draco and stood up, shakily. He threw the Invisibility Cloak over the two of them and led Draco out of the Trophy Room and upstairs to the Seventh Floor.
“Anyways,” Draco interrupted, kissing his lover on the cheek. “You might as well make a choice, Albus. Because you don’t know where any of these choices will lead you, but you do know you can learn from any one of them! And learning—”
When all the other founders dug their feet in and stopped Ravenclaw from implementing them? And why now, after Hogwarts has been around for 1000 years?”
But Draco was already halfway up the first flight of stairs, running for the Room of Requirement, praying to Merlin he would not slip again—who knew what might happen if he took a tumble on the Hogwarts staircase.
She was radiant in her long royal blue sweetheart gown. The strapless bodice sparkled with crystals in an intricate and stunning beaded design, transitioning into a full tulle skirt, beads trickling down it.
Harry blinked and, as casually as possible, readjusted his position to turn towards Ron, forcing Draco to remove his hand.
He dove in. “I was watching you, laughing there with your friends in the snow, and—” Draco trailed off and took a deep breath, regaining the courage to complete his thought. “And you looked beautiful.” A thought occurred to him. “You still look beautiful, now, of course!” Feeling he was absolutely done for, Draco continued digging himself a bigger hole, “Not just now! I mean in general you do, too, I just meant…specifically just now you looked—”
Harry laughed. “It’s good for you, Ron. Using your brain, I mean.” Under the table, he felt a light kick to his shin and when he looked at Ron he was grinning.
Harry glanced down and noticed his lover’s eyes were closed and his breathing was calm and rhythmic. Not wanting to disturb his peaceful slumber, Harry leant down to give his lover the softest of kisses in the middle of his forehead.
Day 20 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry and WOW. Who knew? Who knew?! Jesse McCartney. He knew. But I sure didn't xD
As Draco nodded at Ron, Harry noticed Draco’s eyes seemed a little reluctant to hold eye contact but kept steady enough to confirm with Ron that Draco had heard him and appreciated his candor. Susan and Luna each gave Ron a small smile. “Thank you, Ron,” Luna said, “for being so open and trusting us.”
Draco saw Harry lift his chin, a sign he recognized as the other man asking to be kissed, and Draco happily obliged. The two stood there, huddled warm, snowflakes from the First Snowfall landing and melting on their eyelashes, Scorpius and Albus Severus throwing snowballs and shrieking joyously, having gone and gotten themselves distracted from their hunt for firewood. But there was no rush. They had time. Oh, yes. They had all the time in the world.
It was only after the War that he was able to actually start dealing with the trauma of his childhood. And now he's expected to be a grown-up: a grown-up wizard who grew up in a muggle family who hated him and all he was. An adult, who'd had to raise himself, who never had an actual parent in the house to teach him how to live, how to be a… well, just a person.
When McGonagall was done reading, she lowered the journal back to the desk and let out a long exhale. She instantly noticed the two of them holding hands and her lips curled in a small smile. “Looks like Ravenclaw was a powerful Seer.”
“So eager…” Harry took his time observing Draco’s beautiful physique. Draco had always been slightly pale, a beautiful contrast to Harry’s darker complexion. The former Slytherin was lean, but fit, having turned his entire attention towards his mental and physical well-being after the war. His abs and, let’s be honest, most of his body were mouthwatering. His biceps…his thighs…his arse, which was currently hidden under those tight briefs… Harry knew he’d be seeing it very soon. But first…
Harry’s cheeks burned and he cleared his throat. “Er, if you turn to the last pages, Professor. You can read it for yourself.”
“You know,” Dragana said, “I’ve heard every wixen song that’s been released since 1970. And you know I’ve got a pretty good grasp of muggle music by now as well.”
“S-i-r-i-u-s—ly,” Harry said. “Molly still cannot believe that I have stolen Christmas from her, but she has no idea how magnificent and magical the first Potter-Malfoy Christmas party is going to be.”
Harry frowned. “Draco, it has nothing to do with being ‘smart enough,’ and you know that. It has to do with who
Harry’s heart hammered in his chest, but it took only a few seconds for Draco to pull himself together again and adjust his expression into his signature smirk. “Oh,
Draco did. He squeezed Harry’s hands and the two locked eyes as Harry tried to guide them both into breathing deeply in unison.
Harry found the spot where Draco’s finger was pointing at and read aloud. “'Extensive research has revealed that Ravenclaw most likely had a private journal where she collected her rejected floor plans and crafted innovative architectural enchantments that would have allowed the castle to adapt and change with the modern times. Such a journal has never been found, however, and it has most likely been lost to history.’ Woah!”
“'Although all founders were heavily involved in the architectural planning of the castle and its grounds, Ravenclaw was the brilliant mastermind behind the magical architecture. It is common knowledge that she crafted the ever-changing floor plan of Hogwarts. It is less well-known, however, that it is rumored she wished for the castle to remain ever in flux—occasionally restructuring itself to better fit the needs of the staff and students, adapting with the modern times. Given that it is highly well-documented that the rest of the Hogwarts founders believed in the power and strength of tradition, it can be assumed that the majority of Ravenclaw’s numerous architectural plans were dismissed as “too radical” or “unnecessarily problematic.”
Draco sighed and folded his arms across his chest. “I will. It’s just… I’m worried you won’t believe me.”
“It’s perfect!” Scorpius said and Albus Severus quickly nodded several times, his signature grin back in place.
She wrapped herself in a fluffy blanket which her mother had helped her knit at the beginning of December. It had a Quaffle and three gold hoops knitted with the softest fabric Ginny had ever felt. It helped, of course, that her mother was quite gifted at domestic charms and had shown her a couple of family tricks. Ginny pressed her fingers lightly to the Quaffle, perfectly imperfect in her first ever knitted piece. She felt a sense of calm in her next breath as she concentrated only on the fibers softly tickling her fingertips.
Draco’s life was brilliant. His love for himself was so much purer than it had been in his school-age years and even in the year after the war. Now, he was bursting with love and ready to give some of it to someone else…and he was sure he knew who that someone else was, as he looked at Harry’s bouncy, wild black hair and lightning bolt scar making their way towards him across the ice. He was an angel. Draco laughed at the cheesy thought—but it was true. Harry smiled when he saw Draco laughing and the two finally reached each other, approximately two feet of ice still between them. Draco had walked onto the rink in his trainers, he’d been drawn in as if by some magnetic force surrounding the other man. When he met Harry’s eye, the former Gryffindor raised his eyebrows. “You are fucking high, right now, aren’t you?” he asked, amusement colouring his words.
“I’m glad to hear it,” Draco said and continued to finger Harry, who was continuously letting out moans of pleasure—sometimes low and guttural, and at other times high-pitched and needy.
The wix’s jaw dropped again, equally surprised at the breaking of tradition. They hadn’t discussed exchanging personal Christmas Crackers—Dragana had probably suspected they would just choose any which were left after the guests had chosen.
“I am.” Draco nodded. He took a deep breath, and his hands shook a little as they still presented the Nutcracker and the ring. “Harry James Potter…” He began, and at those three words, Harry felt the tears start to fall from his own eyes.
“I’ll stay. All night. And if in the morning your answer is still no…then I’ll leave. I’ll never darken your doorstep again.
When Harry didn’t respond, Draco continued. “I just want you to…consider that…Harry, she doesn’t even know you! Who was with you through all the turmoil at Hogwarts? At Malfoy Manor? Of course, your best mates, but I’m talking about ME. I was there. You always came to me and I willingly welcomed you into my arms, my life. My
Draco gave a low growl of approval and pressed his lips to Harry’s neck again, sucking and nibbling. Harry knew he would have a pretty obvious mark there later, but what Draco was doing felt so good he couldn’t bring himself to care about the potential consequences.
The wix’s eyes sparkled like their bedazzled spectacles. “Oh, I see! May I ask for whom the cracker will be, Mr. Potter? A family member…a friend…a lover, perhaps?”
Finally, he grabbed his wand and muttered a lubrication spell into his hand. A cool, clear liquid, sparkling with a bit of magic protectant appeared there and Harry wrapped this hand around his lover’s erection.
WHAT HAPPENEND? You migtht be asking. I honestly don't know. I’m asking myself the same thing. But I've had this idea swirling in my head and I really wanted to write this story.
“Dragana,” Harry said, and their guests laughed at his testy tone. “I love you. Now trust me. Take the Cracker.”
Harry had reached the end of the page, which was also the very end of the journal. Both he and Draco were silent, but the words Harry had read were still ringing loudly in their ears.
“Born ready.” Draco was on the edge of his seat, his eyes lit up like a child on Christmas morning—or Hermione when she’s gotten her hands on a particularly thick textbook.
it this time. To help us understand Ravenclaw and Hogwarts more.  I have a feeling it would really help us solve this myst—”
”  In that moment, Harry felt the seedlings of trust, which had started to bloom during his work on the trial, take root in him, and he brought his hand out to grasp Malfoy’s.
Draco raised an eyebrow. “I must admit, I did not know that.” He sounded extremely interested in this information and had eagerly leaned forward as Susan had spoken. Harry found Draco’s inquisitiveness… sexy as hell.
“Famous Harry Potter doesn’t do publicity stunts? What about second year, when you were glued to Gilderoy Lockhart? Or the Triwizard tournament and that interview you gave with Rita Skeeter? Or all those radio and newspaper interviews after the War? You must have told your story a thousand times. You just couldn’t get enough of the glory, could you?”
Harry packed the journal and the biography securely in his school bag, threw the Invisibility Cloak over the two of them and made to leave the room. Before he could take a step, however, Draco took his hand and pulled Harry against him.
Harry shook his head, trying to keep his annoyed expression, but his mouth betrayed him as it curved into a smile.

“I love you, Harry,” Draco said, parting from him only an inch before kissing Harry’s forehead, directly on top of the scar which hadn’t irritated him since Dumbledore’s downfall.
Everyone was on high alert, and it seemed like every other house thought that all Slytherins were murderous supremacists. Which was just ridiculous, and Draco worried for the first years and the abuse they’d receive. Of course, there was some sort of truth in the rumours — obviously, Draco’s own family were heavily involved — but they were children, for Merlin’s sake, and he highly doubted that anyone in the younger years were very clued up on the inner workings of the Dark Lord’s plans.
Draco shook himself, forcing a smile. “It’s fine, I’ll get over it.” He knew it was a lie, and sensed that Eir knew too.
“Oh, I think you do. I bet it was some poor Muggle, some innocent person you couldn’t bear to look at for more than two seconds because you don’t share the same blood.”
“Psh, that man worships the ground you walk on, you could blow up the classroom and he’d praise you.”
In the bath he sunk beneath the bubbles and held his breath until his lungs burned and his ear canals were swamped. It was warm, hushed and soothing like a mother’s womb. Afterwards he dressed in his muggle clothes and went to the kitchen, rubber soles creeping along the dark halls. Since being bitten, the elves had become an unusual source of comfort and remorse. The creatures had often been the victims of the Malfoy’s cruelty, lesser beings lucky enough to be serving a pure household. Dirty rodents that Lucius used to teach Draco the importance of hierarchy, tradition and punishment. Now he was on their level, perhaps lower, and it wasn’t lost on the elves. They didn’t trust each other, but Draco didn’t hurt them or taunt them anymore. So in return, the elves allowed him into the kitchen to hide and eat.
Narcissa lifted her chin and looked at the portraits above the long, mahogany table, “Your father and I weren’t sure you would survive the first transformation.”. Draco stood still and mute, eyes firmly fixed on his leather, muggle shoes with yellow stitching. She took a deep breath and continued, “But you did.”. Draco nodded and lifted his head and gaze to look at Narcissa’s locket resting between her clavicles - a silver family heirloom. It burned his nostrils.
Crackling filled the space between them as the needle reached the centre of the record and side A of ‘It Was Written’ stopped turning. Eir got up, flipped the record and repositioned the needle. The intro to ‘Black Girl Lost’ started playing.
A tawny school owl landed near his mug, depositing an envelope. Draco fed it a bit of hash brown before reaching for the envelope as the owl flew off.
By now, they’d both finished their cigarettes, and Draco felt pleasantly placated. “It’d be good to have someone to talk to, to be honest.” Draco mumbled. Eir nodded his head towards the door, and they headed back inside.
It was Monday and Draco was lying in bed trying his hardest not to think about his upcoming Defence Against the Dark Arts and Potions lessons with the Gryffindors that afternoon.
The two felt like they had come to an agreement. Draco looked at the clock and realised he needed to go, if he were to meet Polky on time. Eir sent him on his way with a reminder to come in tomorrow.
Later that night, he heard her sobbing in his parent’s room. Draco sat down outside the door and cried too.
In the words of Ricky Baker: shit is getting real. We hope you liked that, and we're just really proud of ourselves cos it didn't take us AGES to upload this time!
Draco curled up in a foetal position, his arms hugging his folded legs, knees knocking his wobbling chin. His red eyes welling up, but the tears wouldn’t come. He stared vacantly at his dark room. The house was only illuminated by fat, beeswax candles that dripped onto their brass holders.
Draco contemplated the offer. Since the Dark Lord had cursed his family, Draco and Narcissa had been at the summer house to figure out the new ‘normal’. Draco knew his father just couldn’t look at him.
They were breathing heavily. Sweat dripped down his father’s face and Draco grew more and more clammy as his body flushed hot and cold. Lucius’ nails dug into his skin, and his own broke crescents into his palms.
At this, Niamh and Eir stepped forward to inspect the hawthorn wand, and all of a sudden, Draco felt distinctly odd. Because despite carrying his wand around all summer, Draco hadn’t even felt the urge to use it.
A few days passed silently, and the self assurance that Draco had acquired over the summer was thoroughly destroyed. Lucius never visited him, and Narcissa had disappeared to see her sister in London. Polky had taken up the task of feeding and bathing Draco in his vegatative state with much enthusiasm. The house elf was careful to avoid loud noises and discussions of the news, and instead enchanted the radio to play soft muggle music stations. Draco wept at any mention of back to school sales.
Draco registered something cool and damp on his forehead, and opened his bleary eyes to see his mother standing above him. Draco wanted to thank her, to hug her, to scream at her complacency. He wasn’t sure if he ever did do those things.
As Draco stepped into the shadows, he felt a sharp pain in his chest - yesterday, his mother had sat him down and told him that father was in jail. Azkaban. He had felt a guilty sense of relief when the news came - he knew his mother felt the same, even if she wouldn’t admit it.
Draco broke out of his reverie and involuntarily blushed as Snape suddenly barked out that it was the end of the lesson— and something about his life being infinitely worse due to the existence of this particular class and the ignorant students it supplied.
Hesitantly, she began to explain. Narcissa was careful with what words she used, legilimency was a great fear of hers. Memories can come back to bite with ease in times of war.
Potter’s gaze cast about, as if standing in Draco’s presence physically pained him. "Merlin, I can't believe I almost forgot how infuriating you are. Always acting so superior.”
“Get up, Goyle!” Draco waited a beat, his hands on his hips. “Merlin — you’re fucking useless you know.”
Eir and Niamh weren’t completely convinced, Draco knew that. But perhaps Christmas break would provide another opportunity to convince them. If he wasn’t dead.
He ratched through his drawers, pulling a cig out from a matchbox and sticking it between his teeth and another behind his ear.
ARGH its been fucking ages since we uploaded! But now we're at home in quarantine and can write without any school work (final exams have been cancelled!) or distractions. We hope everyone's okay at the moment - look after yourselves!
“Blowing smoke rings. It’s very difficult, my father prides himself on being able to do it.” Luna leaned in conspiringly, “But I’d say that he’s actually not as good as you.”
Narcissa carefully pinched her right hand pinky between her left hand forefinger and thumb. Draco had found it comforting as a child. Her baby boy. She let out a dry sob, interrupting Severus and Bellatrix. They stopped momentarily before starting again. Narcissa cradled her head in her hands.
But we have a playlist that you can listen to! Its called 'i never sleep cos sleep is the cousin to death' (original, we know), use the url below!
Draco swore and finally put his werewolf strength to good use as he shoved Blaise off the bed in a singular, swift movement. They were both shocked for a moment— he had never been particularly strong— but he smirked in satisfaction when Blaise yelped as they hit the rug.
Lucius was largely at fault, she admitted that, but no one else was to know that. Their honour was slipping. Honour was their only meaningful asset besides money, and it made her very uncomfortable. Severus and Bella were still arguing, but she could sense Severus was winning. He was extremely good with words, which Narcissa appreciated.
Fortunately, Potter looked about as uncomfortable as Draco was angry. “Sir— it really wasn’t like that.”
Lucius spun on his heel, his robes swirling around him. He resembled a merman for a split second, slick hair bursting forth from a black sea.
The whole day was spent managing the shop and listening to the greatest tunes from the last three or so decades. Eir usually blared out his music as a sort of advertising strategy for any passersby, but today there was intent and purpose. He was educating his padawan.
However, the last fortnight had changed his life so suddenly, so thoroughly, he was reflecting for first time in his life. His past actions filled him with an overwhelming sense of shame, and now silence was more agreeable, at least until he understood this new Draco.
Narcissa lost all composure again. Bella would never understand, she wasn’t a mother, she barely functioned as a sister. Bella was wholly devoted to the Dark Lord. Nothing could ever compare.
Everything Potter did was ridiculous, in Draco’s opinion. Potter took himself so seriously, at all times. Draco would’ve found it hilarious if it wasn’t so damn infuriating. Potter was always prancing about like he was in the middle of solving some mystery, or fighting some kind of battle, or saving some damsel in distress. It was exhausting to watch. And Draco intensely resented the whole act.
Potions was seemingly off to a good start. Draco stood at a slight distance from the other Sixth Year Slytherins, listening to their banter. He caught Theodore Nott stealing glances at him every now and then, causing his neck to prickle hotly. Draco liked Theo— he was genuine, didn’t care much for gossip, and seemed less interested in the Dark Lord’s ongoings than the rest of the pureblooded Slytherins. And, Draco had to admit, he was fairly easy on the eyes. He flushed as Theo sent another searching glance his way.
Severus smoothly sat down in the armchair opposite them and crossed his legs, resting his hands on his knees.
It shouldn’t really bother him, Draco supposed — why should he care about what anyone thought of him? But everytime he caught eyes with someone gawking at him in the corridor, he couldn’t help but think that maybe Potter had said something.
Bellatrix sent a curse into the bushes and went to check what was in it. A dead fox. Typical, thought Narcissa, and carried on down the hill. She was aware of Bella following her, and of her disapproval of this meeting, but she was desperate. Bellatrix was good muscle, and honestly, allowed Narcissa to suss out what would be accepted by the other Death Eaters.
They sat in silence for a while, the cold setting in on the otherwise warm evening. Draco considered Luna for a moment before speaking.
Narcissa broke down fully and slumped onto the floor. Severus swiftly grasped her upper arms and guided her back onto the sofa. He took her abandoned glass and refilled it, gently wrapping her fingers round and motioning for her to drink. Narcissa finished the glass and Severus topped it up again.
Draco didn’t really know what to say, he was partly confused, but mostly felt a surge of affection for the strange muggle beside him.
The Glass Onion had become a sort of safe haven for Draco. It was where he had first been introduced to The Beatles, Nas, Fleetwood Mac, T. Rex and Queen. It was where he’d gotten his first job, and his first real friend. The till still scared him every time it pinged open, but now he only flinched. He spent his wages on band t-shirts, cassettes, jeans and recently, his very own Walkman.
“Curating and sharing music is like sharing a little bit of myself. Music just speaks to me, I feel like I'm understood. I enjoy art and knocking stuff about, but listening - truly listening - to meaningful music is a high like none other.”
With an astonished Bellatrix Bonding them, Severus Vowed to watch over and protect Draco. Narcissa left feeling ill, but very much relieved. Her son was going to be protected.
Draco was more than ready, and let his head rest on the tub edge behind him. Niamh massaged his head with the dye until every hair was coated.
The full moon passed without too much issue, and Draco was feeling much better by Saturday. Polky had agreed to a final trip to Newcastleton before Draco’s return to Hogwarts the next day.
They still had over an hour before they arrived at Hogwarts, and Draco couldn’t help but smirk at the idiocy of his rival — what was Potter trying to achieve? Wouldn’t someone come looking for him, eventually? Unless The Weasle and Granger were in on it too — bloody typical.
Draco tried to hide the hurt he felt when Blaise stood to leave for whatever the cursed luncheon was about, and swallowed his pride as he wished them good luck as they left the compartment. Greg gave Draco a sympathetic look.
By Saturday, a sense of relief descended upon the castle. Which was fair, as the first week back at Hogwarts had been fucking shambles in Draco’s not-so-humble opinion.
At this time of the year, Draco and his friends liked going on walks throughout the grounds to soak up the last of the summer sun. In their second year, Pansy had found a secluded beach area behind the castle where they spent many hours jumping in and out of the freezing water or lying starfish-like on the bank.
Borgin and Burkes was the Wizard equivalent of a Muggle taxidermy come antique oddity store. It had a strange, deeply unsettling atmosphere that left many vowing never to return. But the more savoury types always came back.
Draco smirked at Potter’s unimpressed look. “One day, I’ll figure you out and then you won’t be feeling so smug, Malfoy.”
The room wasn’t lit any better than the street, but it had a surprising amount of character. Books lined the walls and an abused lounge set was highlighted by the precariously hung candelabra. Severus gestured towards the sofa and Narcissa removed her cloak before she perched on the lumpy settee. Bellatrix stonily moved to stand behind her, without taking off her cloak.
“You see now Draco,” Lucius grabbed his shoulders and pressed their foreheads together, “You are uniquely able to m-murder him. You can restore the Dark Lord’s faith in us.”
Vincent was in the middle of a particularly hilarious recount of his disastrous family trip to Malta when a small third year girl timidly entered the compartment to give Blaise an invitation to something called the Slug Club.
Part of the reason why we've taken so long to upload this chapter is due to the transphobic comments made by J.K. recently. For a while, we didn't feel comfortable about continuing with this story, as other people have fully removed the Harry Potter series from their lives, and we definitely DO NOT support her views at all. Our fic is obviously not canon-compliant, and as queer writers we will/do include lots of queer representation. So, fuck J.K.!
Niamh slammed three pint glasses down on the bar, “Right, here you go, I’ve just spent the last of my pay on drinks for you ungrateful twats.”
However, he always felt slightly uncomfortable around some of the locals, as his accent spoke of years of private education and his aristocratic background. He'd been called a fairy too many times now, so he tried to keep a low profile. Eir would always laugh when it happened, whispering to him that they all idolised Freddie Mercury and Boy George without a clue. It didn’t help Draco with the awkwardness, but internally the tightness in his chest loosened.
. I was feeling a bit shit on the ride to school, and now Loony Lovegood’s absolutely convinced herself that
Blaise raised their eyebrows in disbelief. “So what, you just couldn’t be bothered to reply to us, to send just one owl, all summer?”
The three discussed the issue at hand, regularly interrupted by Narcissa’s sobbing. The tiny room wasn't very well ventilated, so the windows slowly steamed up. As the temperature climbed, so did Narcissa’s hysteria. The trio ultimately clarified that Draco’s life was of no value to the Dark Lord, and that Dumbledore needed to die by the end of the year.
“Eir, why do you like music so much? I mean, you said that it helped a lot when you were recovering. But why not drawing, boxing, or writing?”
Eir and Niamh were looking up at him with soft expressions, and Draco sensed that they were unsure of how to process what he’d just said. A beat passed before Eir stood up, arms wide as he crossed the room to engulf Draco in a tight hug. Niamh followed suit and shuffled along to hug their legs from the floor - Draco laughed, a sob caught in his throat.
Needless to say that Potions was a massive disappointment as Slughorn was completely enamored with Potter despite him not having any supplies. What made it sting even more was Potter somehow had become a potions whiz over the summer and bested him and Hermione at the first task the professor had set — a miracle! Draco was furious by the end of the lesson. He had wanted to win so badly, not just because he knew he could — potions afterall, was his best subject — but because a spot of Felix Felicis would be very helpful when trying to murder the likes of Dumbledore.
They stopped as they turned to go - Pansy stood staring at the side of Draco’s head. He raised a self-conscious hand to his ear, realising what she was looking at.
Draco remained hyper aware of Potter’s presence throughout the rest of their journey, his bad smell hung like a dense cloud in the hot carriage. And so, irritated, Draco kept up his bratty act until they arrived at Hogwarts station. He dawdled long enough when getting his luggage together that eventually Pansy, fuming, herded the rest of the gang off the train with an audible; “Fuck it, he’s in one of his moods.”
“What about everyone else! What about the questions? And the other Death Eaters Draco? They are already questioning our loyalty!”
Niamh understood how he felt, even if he couldn’t tell her the whole truth. She’d had a scarring childhood, and also felt abandoned by her family. It comforted him to have someone who listened to and shared his struggles.
The day passed by with very few customers and many pots of tea, the lack of tourists indicating the end of summer. The door was open as it was still warm outside, a constant chorus of crickets matched the gentle jazz being played on the hifi set.
A smirk found its way onto Draco’s face, “Oh you know, just here and there.” He shrugged non-commitantly, trying to keep up a playful pretense. Pansy swore under her breath and shared a Look with Blaise.
Draco felt his heart squeeze in affection for Niamh as she bickered with Eir - they’d become quite close over the past weeks. Just a few days prior, she’d seen some of Draco’s scars on his arms, and showed him her own. In a moment of uncharacteristic vulnerability, Draco spent the rest of the afternoon talking with Niamh about their families. Draco had found it strange, that he felt comfortable talking about his parents and the cold, oppressiveness of his upbringing with Niamh.
Breakfast was six eggy crumpets drenched in golden syrup, alongside a large mug of rooibos tea and sliced peaches. Draco smiled appreciatively - the house elves seemed to know that he needed comfort food. He crawled into bed after another fag, and fell asleep.
But alas! Things actually could get worse, and Draco’s heart sank as a lofty voice made itself known behind him.
“Music is my greatest pleasure. Drugs pale in comparison to the bass guitar on ‘Another One Bites The Dust’. I don’t need faith, a woman or smack when I have music.”
Niamh excitedly put the hair dryer down and went to the plastic bag. She flashed an eyeliner pencil and some mascara at them both.
“Oh come off it, Potter.” Draco huffed and moved to grab his bags whilst Potter performed some only mildly oafish maneuvers to get down from the luggage rack. Harry looked at Draco as if he were some sort of unintelligible philosophical conundrum — Draco had to look away, hastily gathering his things. He couldn’t let anything jeopardise his mission, and it felt as though Potter was looking straight through him.
Draco felt the absurd urge to laugh, watching Potter floundering about like a deer caught in the headlights. Slughorn continued to pile on the praise as Harry sputtered through half-formed explanations. Granger and The Weasle looked as though they’d just witnessed Snape tap-dancing. Draco grinned in his seat, delighted.
Draco lowered his wand as he registered that his attackers were in fact two sheepish Hufflepuff students that looked to be in their fourth year.
Peeling back the covers, he eased himself out of the creaking bed. A pile of muggle clothes were left on a chair and he hurriedly put them on. He then made his way towards the closed window and saw that he was on the ground floor, so he pushed open the window and left the clinic.
It suddenly occurred to Draco that he'd never even considered what line of work he'd want to go into. The wealth of the Malfoy family would be enough to support him, he supposed, but he didn’t like the idea of having no purpose, and the thought of living off his father's money left a bad taste in his mouth.
There was a moment of silence before Niamh and Eir broke out into fits of laughter. Draco’s heart plummeted - they didn't believe him. But, Draco supposed, if he hadn’t grown up with magic, then maybe he’d be laughing too.
As much as Draco was dreading Potions alone, Defence Against the Dark Arts was a close runner up for Worst Class. It was another Slytherin-Gryffindor group with no other than the Golden Trio themselves and the absolute ignoramus Harry Potter. But, Snape was teaching this year, so Draco was comforted by the promise of favouritism and the humiliation of Gryffindors.
Lucius laughed like that villian muggles watch. Draco felt like Bruce in front of a desperately wild man.
“Only people who have seen someone die can see them.” Draco’s pace quickened. “They’re Thestrals.” Luna patted Potter’s hand.
Draco watched the lazy ascent of the moon in the darkening sky with sickening dread, and longed for the past in which he'd witnessed this exact scene with amazement.
“Yeah sure! Eir do you have a needle I could borrow? And some ice? Actually, let’s go to mine, I can borrow some proper stuff from Pete.”
As Draco was settling into the rhythm of the work, someone was tapping their foot against the floor and he struggled to concentrate as the minutes ticked by.
He started crying again, but this time his face didn’t scrunch up like a pug, his tears slid from lush lashes and his breathing leveled. Gradually, Draco slid down and hugged his pillow, humming all the while.
Draco straightened up to come face to face with none other than The Chosen One himself, Potter. Jesus, could he catch a break? It was like the whole word had been against him that evening. Draco wanted to say something — anything — but it was as if he’d lost the ability to form words. His head felt like it was shrinking, and his chest was painfully tight.
Bella was the same during their teens. The subtle changes and then all of a sudden being so distant, intense. The only thing that they could ever talk about was the war, and now they couldn’t even agree on that.
The kitchen was a hot, humid and sticky room in the basement area of the manor. Terracotta tiles seemed to sweat on the walls next to the huge ovens and smoking pits. The ‘kitchen’ was more than that, a whole underworld of production and order. At the far end of the hall, a massive iron clock was welded into the wall and the pendulum swung unforgivingly, the heartbeat of the house.
"Well, if you're going to be like that, I don't think we could ever get along. You obviously have zero taste."
The late Sunday lunch was something that could end all wars, Draco thought. All hostilities or arguments were forgotten over the course of the roast dinner. The meat was never dry, the gravy was never in short supply, the Yorkshire puddings were never burnt, and the rich cauliflower cheese was an absolute miracle to behold. And this year, to his delight, Draco was able to consume more than twice the amount he usually did due to his werewolf metabolism and appetite. So, after two full plates of roast, he treated himself to two helpings of sticky toffee pudding with extra butterscotch sauce and vanilla ice cream.
“Certainly, Narcissa. I shall make the Unbreakable Vow. Perhaps your sister will consent to being our Bonder.”
Polky’s buggy eyes were wide and scrutinising him, along with most other elves within earshot. Malfoys don’t thank people most of the time, let alone elves. Draco quickly left as suspicion started to settle on some faces.
Niamh had been showing Draco a new piercing she had gotten, and he enquired about the process of getting one. Piercings weren’t popular in the Wizarding world, people favoring long pendants and hats as accessories. However, Muggle fashion was interesting and diverse, Punks and American Emo youth were particularly interesting. They inspired a sense of civil disobedience that Draco loved and hadn’t been properly exposed to as a cultural phenomenon.
Draco still had no clue what Nas was rapping about half the time. The American muggle slang and culture was completely lost on him but he liked the way the beats and hooks sounded, often finding himself lost in the hypnotic flows. And the lyrics he did understand, he felt strangely connected to.
As his fingers became increasingly wrinkly, Draco hummed the tune to Octopus’s Garden. His reverie was broken when a loud knock came from the door, followed by Blaise’s voice.
The wizard looked appalled at Eir’s direct attitude for a moment, before answering that he indeed was not a local.
The terror dissipated from his tense shoulders and frustration set in. The bed sheets were damp and strewn around, letting the draft brush his moist skin, cooling him down from his feverish nightmare. Draco rabidly pummeled his pillow and cried his sorrow and anger into the mattress.
To hide his embarrassment and to seem more experienced, Draco narrowed his eyes in response, “I know.” He then attempted to take a drag without spluttering. This time, he found that breathing in after quelled his instinct to cough up his lungs. He started to feel more relaxed and light-headed as the nicotine rush set in. He hated to think of the consequences if any of his friends, his family,
Draco felt as though he were having an out of body experience as he settled himself in a seat opposite Potter and Lovegood. Pansy would be laughing at his misfortune when he reached Hogwarts.
Silent sobs racked through Draco’s body as he hugged his legs to his chest. It felt as though someone had ripped his heart right out, and wiped his mind blank. Flashes of his father’s twisted sneer plagued him.
Apart from the bed he was currently in, there was little to no furniture and the white door of his room was firmly shut.
After spending pretty much everyday with Eir, Draco had learnt that, despite his love for the rock and punk classics, Eir had a deep appreciation for Nas. Eir had once confided in Draco that Illmatic had helped him through recovering from his relapse two years prior.
The Sgt. Pepper’s album was in his hand, his fingers traced the faces and the flowers. Eir was pre rolling some fags, lining them up in a matchbox, before starting on some thin joints padded out with spare ‘baccy.
“Because I was once where you are now. I used to feel really fucking low, like, all the time. I was lonely, depressed, anxious all the time. I was doing nothing with my life, going nowhere, achieving nothing. I had no friends… I thought smack was the only way to escape it. To get out. Because when I was high, I had no cares. I felt fucking invincible… but I wasn’t. And I guess… I guess I just want to help you before you end up like me.”
After a few tears and much blinking, Niamh showed Draco how to lightly line his eyes and apply mascara. He looked like a completely different person, like someone who could go to a Muggle rock concert in Camden.
Draco woke up, face sore and mouth dry, to the sound of a house elf running his bath. The grandfather clock in the hallway sounded seven chimes, and the elf left on the seventh ring. His limbs were heavy, body molded into the bed and he decided to stay there for eternity. Several minutes passed, apathetic and dull. A pop let him know the elf was back, he opened his eyes and saw his muggle boots deposited in the centre of the room, polished and gleaming. The fleece and jeans from yesterday were also clean, waiting for him next to the shoes. Draco rolled over to escape the sight of them, but it was too late, the Beatles invaded his mind and Eir was beckoning him to the Glass Onion. Guilt and curiosity are amazing motivators.
Draco and Eir bond over Earl Grey, The Beatles and chips. Later on, Narcissa takes Draco back to their summer house.
“Potter! What a surprising and wonderful show of diplomacy!” Slughorn suddenly boomed from the front of the classroom.
In Shoulder of Mutton, Eir, Draco and a few others crowded around the far end of the pub's dingy bar. It was a Friday night, so everyone from the town and surrounding farmsteads had come in for a couple pints. It was a crowd that Draco loved, the novelty of being just one of the lads never wore off. But unlike them, the swoopy rush of alcohol quickly vanished due his new werewolf metabolism, earning him a reputation.
Once finished, Draco carefully scanned the room for a suitably unoccupied elf. He spotted one and considered his approach. He couldn’t very well go and demand something, that’s what his father would do, but he also didn’t know how to be polite to an elf. Do they have names? Customs? He knew not to give clothes - that would set them free - but what to do? He walked over to the elf and cleared his throat, the skinny creature swung round and nervously hopped foot to foot.
When they got back to their dorm, his bed looked so inviting, Draco wanted to cry. It had been a trying evening, and he did not need to think about his feelings, goddammit!
Eir looked at Draco earnestly, who to be frank wasn’t entirely sure what this muggle thought his issues were, but appreciated the sentiment. Usually pity or sympathy would be rebutted with a scathing comment, insult or retort, an instinct impressed upon him by his father.
?” Potter spat. Draco squirmed under his gaze. Another moment passed in tense silence. Potter let out a short, irritated exhale of breath. “Did you do it? Get a little thrill?” Draco felt incapable of breathing, his chest sore and tight.
”, and Potter’s head finally emerged from beneath his Invisibility Cloak. The effect was rather jarring — Potter’s unruly hair and sheepish flushed face seemingly floating above the seats.
Draco took the stairs two at a time, his pulse racing. Shame clouded his vision, his legs felt like lead, panic was beginning to take hold. He kept his head down as he stormed down the corridor, ignoring anyone he came across. A few jeered at his new look — but he had never been popular, so he was used to it.
Draco had tried a number of times to explain to Eir that he in fact did not choose to be in his situation, and that it was his father’s failings that was the cause of it all. But Eir never accepted his ‘excuses’ and told him that he had to learn to take responsibility for his mistakes. Sound advice if he was actually a junkie. But besides his growing dependence on cigarettes - entirely due to Eir’s own bad habit - he wasn’t even close.
But Draco also saw just how afraid Blaise had been to be honest. Blaise was, and always had been, Draco’s truest friend. Draco loved them dearly. He didn’t want to let them down.
Narcissa knew that she should have stayed at Yarrow Manor to watch over Draco, but this was much more important. Her hands shook as she waited to apparate to the top of Spinner’s End to meet her sister. However, there was no doubt in her mind that Draco was with his Muggle friends, and that Polky was taking good care of him.
had held onto him until his breathing evened out and his chest stopped burning, nor could he tell them that he was a fucking werewolf who—
Draco willed himself to move, to hide, to run; but his feet remained firmly in their place, rooted to the ground by some instinctual, paralysing fear. Narcissa’s eyes widened in panic as she took in Draco’s attire, and the ominous shuffle-clunk of Lucius’ booted feet and cane came closer to them.
“For Merlin’s sake Draco, we were worried! We sent so many owls to Malfoy Manor we thought someone would demand a restraining order!”
During their third year, Dementors patrolled school. Draco tried not to think about the conditions in Azkaban.
“Mer- God it is. It’s awful. The characters are so flat and have zero development. Also I didn’t understand what any of the characters were supposed to be doing at any moment in the film. Seriously, never.”
Draco spent the day caught in a haze of dread and frustration. There hadn’t been any pumpkin juice at breakfast, and it had been a downward spiral from then onwards. By the time he reached the first of his dreaded afternoon classes, Defence Against the Dark Arts, Draco was in a loathsome mood.
Harry eyed Draco as if he were some kind of alien. “What the fuck is up with you this year? Running about the place like you’ve got something to hide?” Harry squinted at him, “I’ll find out what it is, don’t you worry.”
The door jingled as Draco stepped into the shop. By now, it felt more like a home than the ancient walls of his family’s estates. But the familiar scent of hash and damp permeating from the upstairs apartment never failed to make Draco’s nose crease in faint disgust before he acclimatised.
A moment passed, and Draco was beginning to feel immensely stupid before he heard a barely audible “
Vincent and Greg were still relatively speechless, muttering protests in response to Pansy’s insult. Draco snorted, anxiety still weighing on his limbs like lead, and turned to board the train. He hadn’t spotted Potter yet, so all was well.
Draco thought about the Dark Lord and his followers. Besides their fear and hysteria, their eyes seemed soulless. He was always told that half bloods, dark creatures and muggles had no souls, but he knew he had one. And his was hurting, in need of nourishment.
“Yeah, I’m fine. It’s nothing.” Draco recoiled in shame at his clipped tone — she was just trying to help. But Merlin, he did not need her pity. “Look — I’m sorry if I was ever nasty to you, but I don’t need your sympathy. I’m doing just fine as it is.” What a fucking lie, wow. He stood up hastily, beyond ready to leave this disaster waiting to happen.
“I reckon he’s gonna last the year. He’s practically in a relationship with Dumbledore, so he’s got that going for him.” Blaise smirked into their mug of Horlicks.
Draco threw open Greg’s bed curtains and whacked his arse through the duvet. A yelp escaped the lad before he replied: “Merlin’s beard Draco!
Niamh took them all inside and showed them her drawings and equipment. Draco was fascinated to see the instruments, neon lights and crude remarks etched into the walls, but simultaneously beautiful art and complete free expression.
Draco groaned. “Why are you like this? And what makes you think that I was getting with someone on my way back from the Owlery?”
A conversation began to play out in her mind between versions of herself. She debated whether or not Severus could actually help. Was Bellatrix right for once?
Draco scoffed as Borgin bowed deeply in response before he turned to leave the shop, and he uttered a final, firm word of warning to the shop owner.
Draco turned back to his mother for a teary hug before muttering his goodbyes and getting embarrassed at the excessive amount of pet names and worries Narcissa expressed. She gave him a final squeeze before Draco, humiliated, roughly grabbed his trunk and headed towards his friends.
curse on multiple people over the last year. But the way his mother stressed ‘murder’, he knew this wasn’t just some alley cat witch.
“You’ve got to make the most of Sunday Lunch, Parkinson.” Draco raised his hands in surrender. “I don’t make the rules.”
In the past, Draco would find himself yearning for the freedom of practice that came with school, his fingers itching to reach for his wand, a spell on the tip of his tongue. But the past few weeks, he’d grabbed the wand out of habit, but with a new found hesitation. The weight of the power of magic was suddenly very real, and the implications of his honesty was starting to dawn on him.
Once in his room, Draco neatly folded his muggle clothes and pulled the leather boots off, piling it all neatly in a dark corner. He ran a bath and soaked his bruised body in lavender scented water, which quickly became murky. Clean and warm, he padded to his bed and fiddled with his wand, wishing he could use it. He wanted some flowers, or some turkish delights or whatever. Abruptly his chin trembled and his vision blurred. Ducking beneath his sheets and blankets, Draco’s face screwed up and he sobbed for the first time in years. Ugly hot tears ran down his face and he struggled to breathe. Softness, warmth and honeysuckle sweetness was all he wanted. All he needed. Ever.
“Ugh, don’t look at me like that— Monday’s are torture! This is completely valid.” Draco mumbled, face half covered by his duvet.
A number of miles away, Kielder Water lay still in the hazy sunset. Pine trees, towering above the horizon and browning in the summer heat, hugged the banks of the reservoir. Hues of pastel pink, purple and blue were mirrored in the water, the moon tucked the sun into bed behind the silhouetted peaks. Beneath the glassy surface, silver finned trout and carp circled the glowing kelp-coated towers of Yarrow Manor. Years of algae had stained the thick granite walls a dark shade of green, the Malfoy family crest barely visible above the huge, mahogany doors. Spectral yellow lights formed a perimeter between the manor and the blue-green gloom of the reservoir.
The usual hustle and bustle of the house elves had ceased, and the portraits lining the dim corridor wore smug expressions. As Draco made his way down the hallway, his ears pricked at the hissing of a hushed and heated conversation. A strip of yellow light escaped from the ajar library door.
The wizard looked at him and decided it was best not to ask how it was being played, afraid of the indignant tone. Eir wondered what kind of a person would’ve managed to escape Beatlemania and decided that the boy couldn’t leave his shop without some musical education.
Eir hesitated before replying. The truth was, he saw a lot of himself in Draco. He recognised the tell-tale signs of addiction, of depression and anxiety. He wished someone had stepped in for him earlier. And now, he wanted to help Draco before he reached the end point, because he was still struggling past it. Some mornings he couldn’t get out of bed. Some days he couldn’t eat, longing for the sweet relief of the drug-induced numbness of his body and muted emotions. Even after being clean for two whole years, those desires and urges never left him. He felt trapped.
Draco sighed and glanced up at the ceiling, wishing he could just disappear. He was becoming very irritated by the pitiful looks his friends were giving him.
Draco opened the door to find the others sitting in a circle in the centre of the room, sweets and puzzle pieces strewn across the floor.
and the panicked feeling in Draco’s chest loosened, he chuckled despite himself. Merlin, he had missed her — no one else could build Draco up and cut him down so effortlessly.
Eir joined Draco in the bathtub, their legs folded on top of each other. They munched on the crisps and shared a fag as Niamh got to work mixing the dye whilst wearing her Marigolds.
Draco eyed her for a moment— he had been more concerned about his inevitable boredom, not whether or not a Gryffindor had hurled some sort of abuse their way.
The next full moon was coming up soon, and Draco was becoming more snappy and irritable as his next Change drew closer. He was having trouble sleeping, haunted by the memories of the night he was Turned. His skin felt prickly all over, like a fever, his senses sharpened to an inhuman degree. It scared him, really, that he had so little control over himself.
A moment of silence followed. Draco realised that there was no way that he could pretend nothing had happened, and so decided that since Lovegood was relatively harmless, he would just go along with it. With caution.
Draco sighed and pulled his feet up, resting his chin on his knees. He had tried to act as though nothing was wrong, but nothing could change what had happened over summer, and nothing could ease the burden of Draco’s task.
Potter appeared round the corner and Draco turned his back to him, tucking the fag behind his ear. He didn’t need to cause any issues in this class, and avoiding
All of a sudden, the wizard heard a faint rumbling in the distance as the Armstrong’s family van truckled along the scarred country road. The wizard knew that this muggle was his greatest chance of getting home. So ass to the wind, he hauled his battered and blood splattered body towards the dry stone wall.
Narcissa turned and walked away swiftly, the striking of heel against stone resonated in the empty manor. A portrait hissed at Draco as he picked up the jar and exited the hall quietly after his mother, making his way to his room.
The voices became clearer, as Draco slowly approached the door. But even with his superior hearing, Draco could only catch fragments. “The Dark Lord… complete trust in him… a mission… been chosen… forgiveness...”
As Niamh pierced the needle through his cartilage, Draco found it wasn’t all bad. In comparison to the recent transformation he’d experienced, it really was nothing to fuss over, Draco reasoned.
Draco cursed under his breath before turning to sprint around the corner from his friend. “No you bloody well haven’t!” He yelled breathlessly, barking out a laugh as he ran past some bewildered looking first years.
But now that he was living and thriving in the muggle world, he found he had more time to consider how he may feel. Draco had never actually been with anyone, and he now wondered if he ever would. Because, he thought bitterly, who would ever want to be with a werewolf?
Blaise, bless them, cleared their throat, clearly thrown by Draco’s sudden change in attitude. “Erm, well. From what I could tell, he only invited influential people, or people who are just really good at Potions.” Draco flinched, Blaise’s eyes widened. “Not that you’re bad at Potions! I just doubt he would’ve wanted to invite the son of a convicted Death Eater…” Blaise cringed.
Draco headed towards the showers, successfully managed to secure a free stall, and sighed as the water slid lazily down his back. It was going to be a long day.
“Well whatever it is, it’s always better to talk about it than keep it to yourself. It’s better than getting into dodgy shit just ‘cause you can’t deal with it yourself. Trust me.”
“So, how come we can all see them?” Draco glanced at Luna, expectant. She seemed to consider her answer, and Draco started to feel anxious as Lovegood’s expression turned sorrowful.
“You’re embarrassing yourself, Potter.” Draco was honestly surprised that Potter was suddenly so bothered about him. For the past couple years they had pretty much reached a stalemate. Potter had stopped paying attention to Draco— he'd had much more important things to focus on than petty grudges— and Draco had enjoyed being able to do what he'd wanted. “Did you actually have something important to say?” Draco crossed his arms with what he hoped looked like nonchalance.
Slughorn paid Harry’s protests no mind, waving him off and muttering about his ‘humble nature’. Draco barely held back a groan. “Well, now that everyone’s partnered up for the term, we can get started.”
Draco started to feel anxious when they reached the piercing room. Glass cabinets lined the walls, filled with jewelled earrings and dull titanium studs. Draco turned to Niamh, who had just finished taking out and sterilising the piercing needles.
He was on his way to the Library to hide from Vince during a game of Hide and Seek. Pansy had turned her nose up at their childish antics when Blaise had suggested it, and Draco had only accepted to give him an excuse to hide away for the rest of the afternoon.
He panted and rubbed his face, pulling his eyelids and lips all directions. Unbeknownst to Draco, Narcissa’s hand was resting on his door, her feet silent without her heels. She knew he couldn’t cast a silencing spell and had been listening to his ordeal through the door. Lifting her hand from the door to her lips, she left to go to bed again. Draco sniffled and remade his cocoon in his bed, leaving the lamp on.
She made a fierce character, with her hair a mass of dark curls sitting atop her angular face and grey eyes. Tattoos decorated her arms, piercings ran up her ears, chunky rings on each of her fingers. She was short and slight in build, often wearing platformed boots to make herself seem taller. She frequently made jabs at Draco and Eir for being ‘giants’. Draco had to chuckle each time she did - if only she knew about real giants. But now her anger made her tower over him, his pep slowly decreasing until he felt like a wet lettuce.
Shit. Of course. Cedric. And Sirius. How could he have forgotten? Draco looked across at Potter’s pained expression. And now that Draco was really looking, he could see that Potter’s face was thinner and paler than usual, his nails bitten and his usual confidence dampened.
Draco obliged when Narcissa lifted his sweaty neck to pour water down his parched throat, and couldn’t protest when she began to spoon porridge into his mouth. Draco hadn’t realised just how hungry he had been until then, and savored the feeling of a full stomach. He wondered what time it was - it was always dark in Yarrow Manor.
Draco desperately wished his heart would stop pounding the way it was, so that he could try and put up more of a fight.
Draco cast his mind back to third year, with Lupin as their Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. He remembered, with a stab of shame, sniggering with the rest of the Slytherins about the scars on Lupin's face and his shabby robes. He'd looked down on him, never stopping to consider the torment and bravery of his former professor. Draco wondered if he'd meet that same fate. Would he have to spend the rest of his life struggling to find work, living in the shadow of his past?
Something dangerous flashed in Lucius’ eyes, and Draco suddenly felt very small. It would be the only time since becoming a werewolf that he felt innocent in the face of Darkness.
Lucius’ gaze was cold and calm, Draco swallowed reflexively and his hands were fidgeting with the frayed hem of his Fugees t-shirt.
Draco felt distinctly uncomfortable. He didn’t really know what to say — he hadn’t ever experienced losing someone he loved, so Draco doubted that anything he said could be of any help.
“I don’t know. Some sort of lunch with the new Potions master. Should have better food then Greg’s sweaty sandwiches.”
Draco’s hands had been shaking when picking at his dinner, and he wasn’t able to meet anyone’s gaze when his friends had asked what happened. Draco couldn’t bloody well tell them that
Draco rolled over in his bed, aiming to lie-in for as long as possible — this year’s time table was giving him much motivation to stay cocooned under the warm sheets. Beyond the drapes around his bed, he could hear his roommates shuffling about the room half-asleep.
Blaise waited a moment before clambering on top of Draco, effectively trapping him beneath the duvet. “Oh, for Merlin’s sake, Blaise. Stop, you—you— ” Draco broke off, laughing. He half-heartedly struggled before giving in, letting Blaise’s weight settle above him.
to help his Dumbledore task. Borgin and Burkes was highly likely to have something, but he needed to choose his words carefully. Or perhaps not. Draco spotted a necklace behind Borgin, it had a moth eaten label resting next to it on the dusty velvet: Do not Touch! Cursed. Has claimed the lives of nineteen Muggle owners to date.
Draco tried to push his wandering thoughts to the side, he didn’t want to dwell on why he felt the way he did towards Theo. Between past lectures from his father and the summer he’d had, Draco had decided to put any ideas of romance aside. No fooling around, no matter who it was.
“Me neither. It’s fucking crazy. Did your parents never play music in the car, or listen to the radio?”
Snape was slowly making his way towards their desk, his eyes trained on Draco whilst he discussed Inferi with the rest of the class. As he came closer, Draco felt as though there had been some kind of penetration of his mind — as if some growing vines were trying to wrap themselves around his thoughts. He tried to push against it, putting all his energy into trying to fight the invasive tentacles off until the pressure on his mind suddenly disappeared, and the Professor turned away to belittle Granger.
Draco’s heart beat wildly in his chest as he approached the small group — he had no idea how they would react, and Pansy had already been shocked enough by his piercing. This time, Vincent made a strangled sort of sound as his eyes landed upon Draco — he looked like a gasping fish as he flailed his arms about.
Draco’s heart pounded against his ribcage as the shop owner looked him up and down, a smug look upon his face. Draco understood that the greasy man was expecting an easy sell as he registered Draco’s youth. Draco titled his chin arrogantly in response, trying to give off the impression of self-assurance that only came from great wealth and privilege.
Draco pouted like a petulant child, “I will be needing you to exit my chambers now. You’ve hurt my feelings.” He nodded towards his curtains.
The Glass Onion was the only thing that pleasantly span round this head, despite some guilt churning in his stomach. Lucius wouldn’t kill Eir and Niamh now that he had gotten Draco to commit to the Dark Lord’s task. So the only angst he had was that he was missing shifts and worrying his friends.
Draco huffed and tried to get back to his work, but the classroom was too stuffy and the damp heat made him feel at once too present and too detached. Everything was in hyper-focus. His thoughts were muggy, sluggish and incomplete. His hands were clammy and Draco was beyond ready for the lesson to be over as he stared blankly at the book in front of him.
Since getting a job, Draco had spent a lot of his time curating a collection of muggle clothes that he was really very proud of. In particular, a beat up pair of Docs and skinny, black Levis that he bought at a thrift stall in the fortnightly farmers’ market. Eir and Niamh had donated some of their band t shirts to him, along with an assortment of fleeces and sweaters that had spent too much time at the bottom of cupboards. For once in his life, Draco’s ‘main’ wardrobe wasn’t new and tailored, although still mainly black. His clothes were soft and worn, frayed and baggy, and he loved them all. All the pouches of ‘baccy he was collecting for school were carefully wrapped in handkerchiefs and slid between neatly folded tees and jeans. A new scent of lavender, tobacco and old clung to his skin and clothes, complimenting his new found hobbies.
“Draco, I don’t —” Luna began, but Draco was already stepping through the door, his thoughts running a mile a minute, not hearing whatever it was that Luna had said.
“No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid little man, how would I look carrying that down the street? Just don’t sell it.”
“I was, at the start of summer, but then things were getting to be too much…” It hurt Draco, as he spun a vague tale of his summer, to know that if he were to speak the truth, his friends would turn against him. “... so, my mother and I left to stay in some old family manor in Scotland.”
The shuffling of books and papers soon filled the room as Snape finished up on his droning from behind his desk. It was a simple read through and answer questions kind of day, which although insanely boring, was simple enough to complete.
About a mile ahead, lying amongst the bracken a lone wizard, recently turned werewolf, was battling to stay conscious after a traumatic first transformation. Images of mossy trees and the torn ligaments of a deer’s left haunch flashed in his mind while the scent of iron, pine and new leaves jarred his senses. He jolted upright and tried to lift his arm, inducing white hot pain through his shivering body.
A week after the argument with his father, Draco wrote a letter to Eir and Niamh and explained that he was having family problems and would only be able to see them once more before Christmas. It was brief but the severity of the situation was aptly conveyed, as Draco soon had long replies that Polky delivered to him. Niamh demanded details and suggested he ran away to her place, where Eir simply stated Friday would work best and that he would organise some shifts for the Christmas break if he would like to return to the shop. There was no doubt in Draco’s mind that he was coming back, he needed to.
“Shut up Malfoy, I couldn’t get across the classroom without Slughorn seeing me.” Potter muttered, looking pathetically sulky.
The beginning of this chapter was fun to write - we love food. What's your favourite quarantine comfort food?
Draco was beginning to seriously regret his decision to have such a drastic makeover when he caught a glimpse of Hogwarts students ahead of him, and had to duck around a corner to catch his breath.
“And ... and now I am a werewolf!” he sobbed aloud. Unable to cast a silencing spell around his room, Draco emitted strangled sobs as he tried to stop bawling. Lungs tightened and his heart imploded, he choked and thought he was dying. He couldn’t breathe. He was having a heart attack. What if someone saw him like this? What if his father saw him like this? What if someone found out about the furry issue? Who would be friends with him? Who would love him? What if he killed someone? What if he turned someone? What if he he he … What if he hurt the village? Could he turn a muggle? It struck him that he was being uncharacteristically concerned about muggles but Eir had really left his mark. Gasping his lungs started working as his thoughts turned to Eir, the musky, muggle, music man. He was going back to the store. He had to. Rocking gently and wiping his tears away, Draco hummed ‘Yesterday’ to himself.
With a childish hex, Narcissa wretched her arm free and stormed ahead. Her arms hugged her body and she let out a silent sob. Quickly, she wiped her tears away and turned onto a cobbled street.
Draco sat down, silently fuming. How could he explain anything about his situation to Potter? It wasn’t as if he had much of a choice over what he did with his life. He couldn’t escape the Dark Lord— all his friends and family were Voldemort sympathisers— and there was no way that he’d be able to live a normal life with his lycanthropy.
“Dracoooooo!” Harry screamed as the waves of pleasure peaked and he came harder than he ever had before. He continued to moan, shiver, and shake as Draco pumped into him reaching his own climax.
Tags/Warning: No spoilers this time heehee, but nothing triggering and nothing you haven't already seen in this collection yet so far!
“Well, then...” Harry said. “I suppose you two would probably like to know what the hell’s going on.”
“Yeah… it was.” Harry puckered his lips, too weak to lift his head, and Draco smiled, leaning down to kiss him sweetly. Draco broke the kiss and placed his hand at the base of his cock.
Harry was grateful to hear Ron’s snores from the next bed over, grateful that no one would ever know that he was thinking about Draco Malfoy... in bed, his cheeks flaming, heart pounding, his cock hardening with every passing second.
Before Draco could prepare, Harry placed his lips over his right nipple. “Ahh!” Draco said, his body shocked by the sudden intrusion, but quickly growing excited. Draco was soon panting and mewling, a sound Harry lived for in these moments. He enjoyed teasing the former Slytherin so much—and to prove it, he gently released his teeth, which he’d been protecting with his lips and started to nibble softly around the now hard nipple. Draco’s breathing slowed and deepened as he concentrated on the mutual feeling of pain and pleasure that Harry was giving him. Finally, Harry licked the nipple sharply, causing a gasp to escape his partner.
Harry celebrates his new accomplishment with his loved ones--including the one person whose inspired him the most. In fact, this achievement is mutually theirs, and theirs alone--not just some fate that was thrust upon them. He and this person have had vastly different but shockingly similar journeys and they are both about to reap the benefits of their hard work.
Despite all the…horror of that year, they had connected every couple weeks: sharing passionate kisses and finally exploring each other’s body more intimately than either Draco or Harry had been willing to admit to their friends at the time. Ron, the rest of the Weasleys, Hermione, as well as Blaise were now all very informed about the seriousness of their relationship.
Draco frowned.  “I hope you’re not planning on skipping Potions to read that book. Your… Polyjuice potion was looking a little weak and could really use some attention—”
“Oh!” Luna said, eyes widening in surprise at the offer. “Sure, I will. The house elves were working incredibly hard, bustling about and preparing dinner. One house elf with two adorably mismatched socks and a tea cozy recognized Hermione and immediately burst into tears, the poor thing.”
, Harry thought. “But, Draco…” Harry picked up their conversation about the second surprise from earlier. “There’s just one problem with this second surprise of yours…”
“It’s…it’s…” Harry couldn’t find the air to finish his sentence, and simply laced his fingers in between Draco’s and squeezed, his eyes glued to his ring.
This is part 4 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry, but part 2 of the fic started on Day 2, so be sure to go back and read "I swear to Merlin this Room is ALWAYS On Your Side..." before this chapter if you wanna really... set the mood ;)
Harry did so, and the sight of Draco’s cock pressed deep inside him, Harry’s own cock hard against his stomach, was so erotic he let out a deep moan of pleasure. “This looks so hot,” he confessed.
Harry stood and walked towards the fireplace. He placed his hand on the mantle and felt the heat of the fire against his face, already burning with fury. Glancing up at his hand, he noticed the scars of the words
Day 8 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry! I am already in the process of fleshing out a very long fic with this trans/genderfluid Draco-- I don't know why I haven't done it before xD I hope you enjoyed!
“Potter...” There was no malice in the word this time, “I thought you... Fuck. I thought you trusted me.”
Century, Ravenclaw was considered the most brilliant wix of what would come to be known as Great Britain.  It is well-known that she devised the ever-changing floor plan of Hogwarts Castle. However, it is believed Ravenclaw had much more grandiose ideas in addition to the enchanted staircases. It is rumored that the other founders thought it important for Hogwarts to have a basic structure that remained unaltered, and therefore several of Ravenclaw’s plans for the castle were never implemented.’”
Harry considered this. “Well, I don’t think we can answer ‘why.’ But...I think we’re already doing it.”
Draco grinned eagerly and retrieved lube from the bedside table, thoughtfully placed there by the Room. Harry watched Draco squeeze some lube onto his fingers, and then Draco brought his hand to Harry’s backside. Harry felt a slick finger tease his opening and shuddered.
“Malfoy,” Hermione said, greeting him gently, but with caution. She then turned her attention back to Harry. “Have you been with Malfoy since you wolfed down your supper and took off
Draco exhaled loudly. “This is remarkable. We’re actually going to read the words of Ravenclaw herself and discover things about Hogwarts no one ever has.”
They stood there, feet buried in the snow that was growing ever-higher. Draco wasn’t sure if Harry was going to say anything else, so he took the plunge and recited the same words he’d been painstakingly rehearsing since May.
“Apologize.” Harry’s order rang out, loud and clear, and Draco did not hesitate. “I’m sorry, sir. I’m sorry for my impatience.” The words came out in a desperate rush.

“Fuck!” Draco swore, as he felt the pain in his wrists and knees. He was mostly covered by the Cloak, though he was sure his hands and feet were visible. The
“There seems to be another Hogwarts mystery afoot. And perhaps if we help each other, we’ll be able to crack it. What do you say?”
“And I’m sorry I never thanked you. I was...” Malfoy trailed off, and Harry felt the hand on his shoulder disappear, leaving a chill in its wake.
e laden with decorated Christmas cookies (including stockings, gingerbread men, and a Santa jumper) tea light candles, and different pies.)
Draco took the expletive as an invitation to quicken his pace, which caused Harry to cry out. “Yes!”
“Oy, Dragana, loosen up, will you? Ow!”  He patted at her white-knuckled hands clasped around his waist.
“Mm-mm.” Harry shook his head stubbornly, his body going rigid, rooting himself to the spot. Draco could sense though their bond that Harry’s heartbeat was accelerating, and his thoughts were gearing him closer towards spiraling.
McGonagall continued as if Draco had not spoken. “And, as Eighth Years, your priorities should be preparing for your N.E.W.T.s and planning for your future."
‘I see an absolutely devastating war raging across the land, and what’s worse, I can see that the final battle will be within the walls of this school. I see absolute destruction of our beloved Hogwarts.’”
“You’re right. I’ve been an absolute bastard. And I’ve fucked up majorly in so many ways. But… I’ve changed. Or at least, I’m trying to change. And I apologize for how I’ve treated you… Ron. And Hermione. It was inexcusable.”
Between sobs, Ginny got out her final words, “If he’s the reason you’re leaving me, Harry... If you’re really leaving me for Draco fucking Malfoy, just…please,” she begged him.  “
But then…why was Harry grinning? Why was he gesturing for his friends to look in Draco’s direction? Why were they all prodding him with encouraging looks on their faces? Why was Harry shushing him and turning bright Gryffindor scarlet? Why was he grinning at Draco slowly raising a hand to give a shy wave?
“And now, Harry dear...” Draco kissed Harry on the cheek. “I have another surprise for you.” They were walking up towards
“I saw you lower your wand. You wouldn’t have killed Dumbledore. And at Malfoy Manor... you knew it was me.”
Draco was so shocked, he slipped — the floor and his trainers were incredibly slick with melted snow. He fell forward, splaying his arms out to catch himself and protect the
“Well, fuck it, I’ve already mucked that up!” Draco said, and gave Harry’s hand the slightest of squeezes. “You look totally stunning. And, might I also add, even if it’s a little too much, you look a bit like an angel. There I said it! There’s no taking it back now,” he finished, slightly giddy.
As she read Ravenclaw’s introduction to the journal, Professor McGonagall gasped, clasping a hand to her mouth.
Harry remembered an old muggle saying: the eyes are the window to the soul. He wasn’t sure who’d said it, but in that moment, Harry knew they were right. In that moment, as he stood in the Room of Requirement with Malfoy, their eyes locked on one another, Harry felt he could read Malfoy like an open book. His apology was genuine, as was his gratitude. Harry took a deep breath and allowed a feeling of calm to wash over him. He was certain now that he’d done the right thing. Harry was sure he trusted Malfoy, and guilt began to gnaw at his stomach for how suspicious he’d been.
Susan nodded, and Harry noticed she looked almost completely relaxed now, certain she could trust all of them. “There is, yes. Perhaps—have any of you noticed anything strange at mealtimes lately?”
“But to think it’s been here for over 1000 years! It’s in pristine condition, too… it must have been under one hell of a stasis charm in there,” Draco said.
He had a plan. He was a Slytherin. He always had a plan. A scheme. He was going to tell him he looked beautiful, laughing in the snow. Yes, it was a strange way to start a conversation after not seeing each other for three years, but something told him it would be okay. Something inside him was urging him to just take the leap, and say at least some of the words he’d been keeping to himself since he was eleven years old. Some words he was sure to hold back….but Draco had been wanting to confess this since he’d first seen Harry in Madam Malkin’s that fateful day in Diagon Alley. The day he fell in love with the Boy-Who-Lived and was destined to pine after him from that moment on. All in secret—until now. Until this moment.
Harry looked deep into Draco’s eyes, trying to determine whether he trusted Draco was ready. Finally, he nodded and turned back to the journal.
“Harry!” Draco’s frustration was evident in every sound of Harry’s name dropping from the former Slytherin’s lips.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Draco Lucius Malfoy…would you do me the great honor and become my spouse, to chase, to hold, to cherish till death do us part?”
“I thought the name sounded familiar! I think my Aunt Amelia was friends with Rowan during school. I’ve saved as many photographs as I could from her house after...” Susan swallowed. “After… she died… You know, a couple years ago.”
Harry glanced up from the journal. Draco’s head was still on the table, his face buried in his arms. Harry reached out a hand to gently rub Draco’s back. As he did so, he continued:
It was a Christmas Nutcracker. This had to be the cheesiest thing he had ever been gifted—which surprised him, given Dobby’s portrait.
“It’s impolite to refuse tea when your host has offered it,” Draco said.  He sounded a lot like Hermione, as if he were reciting a page from a textbook all about proper etiquette and manners.
“I have to ask though,” Draco said, interlacing his fingers and resting them on the table. “Why is this information… relevant? Don’t get me wrong, I love learning about historical figures simply for the sake of learning—”
Harry swallowed. “She saw a Gryffindor and a Slytherin, two young wizards, united by their love for Hogwarts and each other, helping to mend the divisions caused by the House System by starting the reformation.”
Luna nodded and took Susan’s hand in hers. Harry couldn’t help but notice how soft Luna’s eyes were when Susan turned to her with a small smile of gratitude.
“Interesting,” Draco said after a moment of perusing. “Apparently Rowan attended Hogwarts in the 1970s. Not many non-binary wixen from that generation have come out; they might be the only one. They were a Hufflepuff. Intriguing, I didn’t expect that…”
Harry wasn’t sure what to make of this new information. This experience sounded unbelievable, but so did most things that had happened to Harry in his own life. Unable to figure out an appropriate response to Draco’s confession, Harry found himself stroking Draco’s knee with his thumb. He hoped the gesture, regardless of his inability to find words, was reassuring to Draco. Harry wasn’t going anywhere. He didn’t judge him, and, above everything, he trusted Draco.
"Very good. Or..." Harry conjured a little jingle bell and placed it in his lover's right hand, "drop this to stop."
Ginny was rearranging the presents under their enormous evergreen Christmas tree standing in their living room. Her mother had made sure that all her kids had access to proper trees this year—working with Neville Longbottom to cultivate her own magical Christmas tree farm for the family in a previously unused corner of the Burrow property.
This, Harry thought cynically, was probably the whole reason they set up this fancy, shmooz-y “eat and shop” system in the first place:
Harry brought his eyes back to meet Draco’s. In those never-ending pools of emerald, Draco couldn’t help but notice a glint of…sadness— or regret.
“It was hidden in the walls of the Room of Requirement,” Draco explained. “Must have been under a very powerful stasis spell.”
“I’m nearly ready, yes, my love. Please. Will you turn for me?” Harry bit his lip and spoke in his sweetest voice.
“Okay.” Draco said simply. He paused, and then said it again. “Okay.” He opened his chest and held his arms out in a receiving pose. “Do you want to come in?” Harry nodded and buried his face against Draco’s chest and hugged him close.
“Now, Harry, are you paying attention? Look.  Do you see the façade in the center, which leads to the porch?”
As Harry stepped under the cloak, his side pressing firmly to Draco’s, he tried, unsuccessfully to stop shaking.
Draco murmured, “Muffliato,” and turned to Harry. He was facing him full on, his body, mind, and magic acutely attuned and Harry settled into that unconditional support from his partner.
Draco Malfoy sat comfortably in front of the fireplace, his hair, now free and natural without any potions or painful spellwork. His blond locks fell slightly longer, as he’d let his hair grow out through the summer. A perfect juxtaposition to the Christmas tie around his eyes.
Harry took a shaky breath and kept reading: “‘Halfbloods, muggleborns and many other magical creatures will horrifically lose their lives.  These Dark witches and wizards will be consumed with a hatred so deeply rooted there will be no convincing them to stop the violence.
Draco had gone off on a tangent with his thoughts—that happened when he was high, but he had also gained so much progress it made those temporary dazed moments worth it. He’d been thinking how it was a totally random act of serendipity, seeing Potter there on the ice with Weasley and Granger. They were obviously enjoying themselves immensely, giggling like First Years in the Hogwarts courtyard during the first snowfall of the season.
Harry shivered, whether from the chilly evening breeze or Dragana’s serpent-like hissing in his ear he wasn’t sure.
That looked like it hurt. But Harry was already getting to his feet, ready to try again, so Draco threw open the door, slamming and bolting it shut behind him. Safe on the other side, Draco leaned against the door and slid to the floor, the
However, she was jarred by the sudden soft mechanical whirring of her and Harry’s family clock. The hand with Harry’s face on it had moved to “travel,” and Ginny knew he’d be arriving by Floo any moment.
“Come on… why would the Room have revealed this to us then, huh? Here, let me read the next part.” Draco brought the book slightly closer and turned the page. It was an intricately detailed sketch of the Hogwarts Castle—at least, one section of it. Draco checked the next few pages, and sure enough, the next several pages were similar sketches of other sections of the castle: Gryffindor Tower, Slytherin Common Room, Kitchens, Dungeons, the East Wing, and so on. Some of the sketches were moving, the walls of the rooms disappearing and rearranging themselves.
Harry finished wrapping the lights around Draco’s arms and torso in a gorgeous pattern. Harry rested his hands on Draco’s neck and relished in the realization that the former Slytherin was completely at his mercy. Except…
“Can you imagine what amazing magic is hidden in those pages?” Harry asked. “I’ve discovered many of the founders’ objects before, but—”
He came a short time later, long strings of cum landing all over his naked stomach and chest. Harry groaned in satisfaction at the release, then quickly glanced towards Ron—who was thankfully still fast asleep. Harry sighed and stroked himself until the very last bit of cum had dripped down his shaft and over his fist.
In fact, it felt as if her soul had splintered open, and there were miniscule cuts everywhere, inside and outside her body. Ginny felt her magic burst forth like a wave from the sea and crash over her. The sheer amount of magic and pain she felt coursing through her veins was intolerable and she began to cry.

Harry didn’t look back when he heard Malfoy’s chair scrape, followed by soft footfalls. He did jump slightly when he felt Malfoy’s hand on his shoulder, but he didn’t pull away.
Harry huffed and folded his arms indignantly. Everyone else laughed, and Draco leaned in to kiss Harry’s burning cheek.
…miracle. We always could have been. But you just wanted us to stay invisible. Like…” Draco swallowed. “It’s like you want us to be these shadows. And I just want you to realize—you have a choice. And you should choose me. And not her.”
“You’re beautiful,” Draco repeated. “It’s true. I saw you here, at the market—we were moving from place to place,
Harry felt his heart skip a beat but resolved to finally pluck up some of that Gryffindor courage he was famous for and turned his hand slowly around so their palms were touching. Then, one by one, Harry and Draco interlaced their fingers together.
“And that upgraded laser charm on my eyes from last time we were at St. Mungo’s has been doing absolute wonders for my nighttime flying. You had no idea we were going the wrong way for the first two minutes of our journey before I deftly maneuvered us back on track.”
Harry blinked and chastised himself for getting caught up in irrelevant details. He’d had enough of this.
“Professor Dumbledore always thought highly of you, Harry,” Professor McGonagall said, switching to his given name. “He trusted you implicitly and so do I. And Draco--” she met Draco’s eyes, “I thank you for your dedication to this school and the future of the magical world. I see what you’ve been through to be here today, and you are one of the most admirable wixen I have ever met.”
When Dray comes downstairs looking more delicious than the cookies Harry has just finished decorating, Dray must decide whether she’s willing to let go of all the hard work she’s put into this outfit…
Of course, neither Harry nor Ron owned the book themselves, but Malfoy’s looked just as worn as Hermione’s, which Ron was flipping through while Harry scanned the pages of the copy the Room had summoned for him.
Not trusting himself to speak, Harry readjusted the strap on his school bag (he’d brought the Ravenclaw biography with him, just in case) and closed the distance between them, reaching out to where he guessed Draco’s body to be and felt the velvety cloak and something solid beneath it.
The door clicked and the Room swung it’s door open, nice and slow, revealing Draco in all his glory.
“Looks like the author was a bit of a fangirl, doesn’t it?” Ron asked, chuckling. Harry was about to laugh at the adulatory title, but caught himself just as Hermione and Luna glared at Ron, who stopped mid-chuckle.
She grabbed the plastic bag from the kitchen and went into the bathroom, calling Draco to follow her. Niamh wrapped a manky towel round Draco’s shoulders and secured it with a hair bobble. After debating the pros and cons of dyeing his hair in the kitchen vs the bathroom, she shoved Draco into the bathtub. Draco folded his legs and leaned against the tub edge, feeling relaxed and a little excited.
Vince nodded, pointing his spoon at Draco. “Yup, and he’ll definitely be giving the Gryffindors hell this year too, which’ll be fun.”
Queen was blaring from the radio and Niamh was dancing. In contrast to the stiff balls he had attended as a kid, Muggle dancing was a lot freer. Or rather, Draco suspected, his parents had kept him separate from other influences. As Eir and Draco entered the kitchen, they joined in on Niamh’s boogieing. Draco had mastered the ‘step and sway’, as well as an assortment of limb flailing and jumping combinations.
His mother had put him to bed last night, and he felt pathetic. Draco’s head felt hollow, thoughts forming and unravelling at the same time. It was a strain to focus on anything. There was a weight on his chest that made it difficult to breathe. Draco was fever-hot and goosebumps ran up his arms.
going to plan, and while Draco didn’t attribute his success to the pot itself, it had helped him through the low points. Now, he was even able to do things high and sober and compare the experiences. It was easier for him to imagine a daily routine where he wasn’t high most of the time.  It was going to take a while, for certain, but he was transitioning from using pot to help him function day-to-day, to a creative tool in his potion-making.
“You… you’re welcome,” Harry finally said, his voice barely above a whisper. “I did believe I was doing the right thing when I defended you and your parents.” The guilt had risen, and Harry swallowed over a developing lump in his throat. He blinked and looked away, walking back to the table. Malfoy followed him, and the two sat down across from another once again.
“'Ravenclaw is rumored to have been particularly skilled in the art of Divination. According to legend, Rowena dreamt about a warty hog leading her to a cliff by the Great Lake.  It is upon that very spot that Hogwarts continues to stand today, educating students from across Great Britain and Ireland.
“I can’t believe you’re doing this, Potter!” Dragana said, anger flaring in her silver eyes. “It’s totally cheating.”
At hearing that, Harry scoffed and punched the same spot. Not too hard, but hard enough for Draco to stop laughing and scowl at him.
Again, the Room responded immediately to his request, propping him up with pillows and blankets, making this spot in front of the fireplace really the most lovely and comfortable place to spend the night. With Draco. His Draco. The Room dimmed the candlelight to prepare for sleep.
Malfoy’s Adam’s apple bobbed, and then he opened his mouth to continue. “I was embarrassed,” he confessed, and to Harry’s surprise, Malfoy’s pale cheeks went slightly pink. “But...that’s no excuse. I’m sorry. I should have thanked you. For everything you did for me. For my family. I know you fought to get their sentence down from life to fifty years, and for that I am eternally grateful.”
“DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY IF YOU DON’T OPEN THIS DOOR RIGHT THIS SECOND, I’M GOING STRAIGHT TO PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL!”
Day 16 of 25 Days of Draco and Harry! I'm so sorry to have left you with such a cliffhanger, but today was my first rough day while writing as I go through some personal things. Don't worry, I can promise the smut hinted at in today's chapter will come back before Christmas ;)
“Yeah, I agree with you,” Harry said. “I kind of wish some of Ravenclaw’s ideas for adapting with the times had been approved by the other founders.”
Harry, Ron, and Draco looked quizzically at Seventh-Year Luna Lovegood and fellow Eighth-Year Susan Bones.
Ginny looked at the tree again and recalled how particularly special this tree was to Ginny and her mother because it was the actual first one, as in, the first of the six Mum had chopped down. Ginny had to grin and let out a laugh. The mental image of her mother swinging an axe and hacking away at her Christmas trees was ridiculous. In fact, Mum had deftly taken her wan and with a masterful swipe had sliced the tree at the perfect height to encourage new magical growth.
“You’re absolutely beautiful,” Harry said when Dragana had completed her twirl, arms still outstretched.
“I’ll be right there,” Draco reassured him. He slid off the condom, tying it in a knot and placing it in the bin.
Harry was intrigued to hear Draco was just as aroused as he was simply from giving Harry pleasure and knowing Harry wanted him. He decided to beg some more, to see how much he could drive the other man wild. “Pleeeeease, Draco. Fuck, I need you to fill me with your thick cock. Pleeeassse fuck me, Draco!”
Harry sucked air through his teeth and felt mixed pleasure and discomfort as Draco pressed inside him.
On one page was Gryffindor Tower, and on the other was the Slytherin Common Room. Draco watched as the floorplans of the Slytherin Common Room faded out and reappeared completely differently. A quick glance to the opposite page showed that the Slytherin Common Room floor plan was now nearly identical to the Gryffindor Common Room. In the next second, the floorplan faded in and out again, lines in their original places.
“What does it say?” Harry said, reaching for the book. Draco allowed Harry to hold one end and read aloud, “‘I had another dream. I know it to be prophetic, just as I was certain my dream with the warthog would lead to us building Hogwarts on this very spot. I have had another glimpse into the future, this time hundreds of years from now. It’s difficult for me to reconcile.  I am almost afraid to write this, as if doing so will ensure the prophecy comes true.
Draco stood as frozen as the branches looming above him as Harry rapidly approached. And he did not look happy. But he didn’t look necessarily angry either.
I honestly cannot believe that Day 25 is over. I know it sounds a bit cheesy, but this 25 Day Advent Challenge has changed me signficantly. My entire approach to writing has been uprooted and shook around a bit, being replanted in a brand new garden. Three actually. A03. Tumblr. Discord. This is only the beginning. But this was such a wonderful experience.

As Harry felt Draco’s cock slide inside him, he tried to relax into it as he had Draco’s fingers. But this fullness was a much more uncomfortable sensation than the fingers and he had to squeeze his knees tight to Draco to stop him going further.
“And this year we decided to compete and see who could come up with the best Christmas crackers for you all—our loved ones.”
“Dragana. There are a million reasons why I love you. But I’ve come up with eight. Don’t ask me why eight, that’s just how the math worked out, alright?”
Trying to get the broom from the entry hall to the Room of Requirement without being spotted by teachers was going to be difficult.
Finally, Draco reached for the garment he’d been most excited to try. A magical and sexy black corset that had a charm on the ribbons to ensure you’ll look “just like the picture.” Draco gulped and felt his heart hammer in his chest as took the corset and placed it on his torso, connecting the hooks and eyes at the back.
“I should have known.” Malfoy shook his head and then his lips curled up in a smirk. “I guess old habits die hard, eh, Potter? You just can’t stop following me, can you?”
