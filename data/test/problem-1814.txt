“Draco, you’ve barely touched your tea,” Narcissa spoke aloud, bringing his thoughts back to the present.
After knocking on the door and being escorted to his mother’s parlour, as per the usual routine, he was surprised to see she was already there waiting for him.
Harry nodded in acknowledgment but didn’t say much. Instead, he took a large swig of whatever dark drink was in his hand, and Draco was slightly impressed by the giant gulp he took.
Standing outside, however, he realized quickly that as rain poured down onto his face and coat that he was not home at all, but instead at the Manor. The irony was enough to make Draco want to cry – of course his old wand took him to the one place he could never call home again, the place that was his home when he still wielded it.
Forty minutes and four shots of vodka later, Draco loosened up quite a bit. Pansy must have noticed Draco start to shut himself out, as she practically poured the shots down his throat. Even so, it was nice seeing her so happy and carefree. Nothing at all like the timid girl he remembered towards the end of their Hogwarts years.
Draco nodded once, allowing Potter to step forward and scan the area with his wand. When he gave them the all-clear signal, the others followed towards the well. Looking down, it seemed to be mysteriously covered by rocks. On the side of the well was a small, bronze plaque with no words visible.
Blaise sneered, “There’s very few things you would sell your freedom for, even fewer people. What did they offer you? Something you can’t refuse, I imagine.”
He couldn’t remember who it was that ordered more drinks for the table, but soon their intertwined groups had begun to dominate that area of the pub, as they had to put two tables together to fit everyone. Draco, feeling more drunk than usual, was quite talkative, and tried to make conversation with every person there. He also tried his best to avoid Harry in conversation, but it was hard to do when the man actively
“Draco,” Blaise’s voice called out from behind him. When Draco turned to face his intruder, he was surprised to find Blaise still wearing his pajamas as well, a Slytherin green pajama set that he’d clearly never gotten rid of from their school days.
After one too many drinks and a couple hours later, Draco, being the gentleman that he is, escorted Pansy to her flat. He had a slight buzz himself, but Pansy being Pansy drank far more than he did and he felt responsible for making sure she got home safe. It was the least he could do, after all she’d done for him in the years’ past, not to mention the handful of times she had to play the babysitter while he was inebriated.
Draco looked at him, bewildered. What could Potter possibly have that was his? He thought back to their night of drinking, desperately trying to come up with a clue as to what it could be. Did he leave something at the bar? He doubted it. Even if he had, Draco surely would have noticed if he was missing something.
Harry hesitated, not knowing if his answer would be helpful or not, “No, but I’ve just learned to deal with it.”
"Pansy Parkinson,” A familiar voice from the other room called out, causing Pansy to cackle quite manically, “would you mind explaining to me why I’m in your bedroom?”
The footsteps stopped directly outside of the stall. Small, audible breaths were heard outside of the stall door until a familiar voice eventually replied, “It’s not Blaise.”
Pansy grinned like a child and escorted herself out of his bedroom. After Draco showered and got dressed, he waltzed out with her to the café he always frequented on the weekends. That is, when he wasn’t burying himself under the pile of work he
The group shrugged until Draco spoke up, “There’s this Spanish tapas place that I like in Chelsea. They’ve got some great food and drinks.”
After recognizing that the people Blaise was talking to was none other than Harry’s Gryffindor crew, including the red-haired Weasley girl who he was most likely married or engaged to by now, Longbottom, and a couple of others Draco was too pissed drunk to recognize, he quickly excused himself to the bathroom. Luckily, everyone around him was too far gone to notice, but he still tried to be as discreet as possible, which is how he ended up having a mini meltdown in the bathroom.
to open said lock. Draco had never heard the incantation before. It made sense, however, that a stronger charm than
Draco looked around at his friends and felt his lips droop. Blaise and Justin were chatting about something work-related, while Millicent, Theodore and Pansy seemed to be laughing over some ludicrous story Pansy had told them.
Irma shook her head, “Wasn’t working here then. I was transferred to this branch after I moved from Paris three years ago. Heard about it though. Nasty business, that.”
Anthony must have noticed his change of mood when he placed his arm around Draco’s shoulder. This wouldn’t have been unusual if it was one of his Slytherin friends, but this was the first time he had actually talked to this man. The touch made him shiver, but he hid it well, or as well as his drunken self could. Perhaps, Draco thought, he wasn’t the only one feeling a bit drunk, “You alright, Malfoy?”
Potter ignored Draco’s comment when he spotted Blaise approaching them. When Blaise arrived, he shook his head in disappointment, “Nothing.”
Draco didn’t really know how to respond to that, so he opted for a brief, but friendly wave as he walked out the door. Before he exited the building however, he realized he desperately needed a moment to catch his breath. Finding a bench by the restrooms, he took a seat, placing the contract in his hand onto the seat next to him. Throughout the meeting, Draco’s nerves caused him to sweat profusely through his vest. He opted for black, as he normally did, and yet he could feel the sweat start to build up underneath his silky button-down and matching black vest. It almost made him want to take off his coat, but the Auror department was the last place he would ever dare to strip off his clothing.
Draco couldn’t believe what he was hearing. He thought, for a moment, that it was some sick joke played onto him by the universe. As he stared into her face waiting for her to show some sign of understanding, he realized that she was completely serious and there was no getting around the idea of marriage.
“Nonsense,” he shook his head, motioning his left hand to the chair that sat across from his desk, “please sit, we’ll be done in just a moment.”
Before long, they reached the entrance to the Ministry. Draco waved Blaise off before lingering a bit, staring at the building and the burning feeling in his gut – a feeling that was not unfamiliar to him, shouting that he did not belong. It bothered him at times, mostly when he felt guilty or shameful when thinking of the past. This time, as he stared at the building in distaste, he didn’t feel neither shameful nor guilty. Instead, he just felt lost.
Draco felt a lump forming in the back of his throat. His hands began to sweat and the hairs on the back of his neck began to rise. He never liked dealing with Time-Turners.
Draco stood frozen, disbelieving the words he heard. If what they’re saying is true, does this mean that his father is the Death Eater they’ve been searching for? Is this why he’s been invited onto the case?
He pointed to the red headed girl behind him, who was now conversing with her brother, “Ginny likes Muggle pubs. She forces us to go to a new one every week.”
Harry picked up the portrait in Draco’s hand, wiping the excess dust off with the sleeve of his overcoat. Wiping the frame, Harry smiled dimly. The sadness was there, it was undeniable in his eyes.
Draco said nothing, just opened and closed his mouth like a fish out of water. He didn’t know how to respond. How could he when he’s heard the words he never expected to hear, the very same that Draco had felt for so long but was too afraid to say himself?
“I understand,” Draco responded, feeling slightly resigned to his father’s imminent fate, “What do you require of me?”
Potter seemed just as uncomfortable as Malfoy when Irma swung her arm around his shoulders, “And of course, I heard about our superstar savior over here.”
It then became apparent to Draco that he had a decision to make. Either he refused and made a complete knobhead of himself, while maintaining his dignity, or he simply agreed and regretted it later. The thought of seeing Harry’s home was intimidating, to say the least. He had imagined perhaps a million times what the inside of it looked like – the décor, the architecture, all of it. He imagined a grand drawing room, where Harry entertained his loved ones. He imagined a garden with a beautiful greenhouse, and seating for when Harry had his morning tea. Worse, perhaps, was that he imagined a room full of Harry’s accomplishments - an in-house museum filled with dark artefacts he’s collected over the years. He certainly wouldn’t put it past him. Granted, in Draco’s profession, he definitely had somewhat of an impressive collection himself. Regardless, Draco never imagined himself standing inside of that very house, and yet, somehow, it was destined to happen.
Narcissa shut her eyes tightly, exhaling for a moment before sitting back down in her chaise as if the entire ordeal winded her.
Draco groaned at the loud roar, which only added to the pounding in his head. He shoved his head under the pillow and hoped that whoever his unexpected visitor was, they’d go away.
“Look at them,” Draco shook his head, chuckling at the display, “They’re like a wild pack of animals.”
Potter popped his head out into the hallway, raising an eyebrow in confusion as Draco tenderly grazed an old, dusted picture of Sirius and Regulus with his index. Walburga placed her hands on the shoulder of her children – the grimace in her face firmly staying in place, though her eyes wandered to her youngest with a sad expression. He was eighteen when he died, or so Draco was told as a boy. The Black brothers were once the pride and joy of this house, now both were gone. The house mourned their presence, and Draco could feel it. He felt it in the air – the way the wood inhaled and exhaled in sorrow.
Her eyes narrowed but she relented. Relaxing back in her chair, she sat there, saying nothing. It wasn’t an uncomfortable silence, but one that Draco found he actually didn’t mind. He preferred sitting there in silence than being chastised over things he could not control.
From the angle he stood at, Draco’s dark mark was visible enough for Anthony to see the head of the snake poking out from his rolled-up sleeves. Noticing this, Draco shyly rolled his sleeves down, embarrassed and ashamed at the look of surprise on Anthony’s face. He supposed he should have suspected a reaction like that from him. He was, of course, a part of Potter’s entourage.
“I need another drink,” Malfoy muttered, before screaming loud enough to cause Harry and the others to flinch, “WAITRESS! A COCKTAIL PLEASE.”
They entered the shady man’s room, which seemed to be an old prison cell, fashioned into a small living space, complete with magical artefacts of all kinds - many of which were illegal. Draco tried not to stare in awe at the man’s impressive collection, taking note of the staring glass eye. He wondered if it was the same one sold at Borgin and Burkes forever ago.
Potter looked surprised, almost as if he didn’t expect him to accept. Perhaps it was better that Draco went home and cuddled with Mittens until the memory of today wiped away with sleep. Although, even the thought of being alone made Draco feel worried about the direction in which his thoughts would go. Besides, he’d already accepted and there was no backing out now.
Harry rolled his eyes and Ginny scooted closer to him. Draco tried to ignore the tightening in his stomach at the sight of it.
As Blaise turned to walk back towards Draco’s fireplace, Draco felt the frustration inside him building. Before he thought it through, he felt the word ‘no’ escape past his lips.
It's finally here! This is probably one of my favorite chapters I've ever written because of how utterly humiliating and hilarious it is. There needs to be more drunk Draco making a fool of himself in fics, in my opinion lol
“This morning at approximately seven o’clock.” Robards responded, pushing his sleeves back as he continued, “Now, I’ve already sent a detachment to scout out the area where he was spotted. I want Malfoy, Potter and Zabini to be the first on the scene if we get a visual on him. Miss Dendron and Mr. Longbottom, I’ve arranged for you to meet with the local Aurors in the area and set up a place to conduct your tracking spells efficiently. Miss Dendron, I believe you are familiar with the object he’s using?”
It took a moment for Draco to adjust his eyes; He simply couldn’t believe what was happening. Of course, upon realizing there was no threat, he put his wand away immediately. Still, seeing all these people in his flat didn’t help him to feel at ease in the slightest.
“Is he still there?” Draco remembered his mother’s letter, stating that he was in Brussels the last time he wrote to her.
. Mostly in his thoughts and in his dreams, which consequently tended to turn into nightmares, was he able to distract himself as best as he could by occupying his time with something meaningless. But nearly every damn day, Draco would read his name somewhere in a headline in the Daily Prophet, or from word of mouth as he passed by other wizards in the area. It was as exhausting as it was tormenting.
Theodore, who seemed to have gained a bit of courage from the alcohol grabbed her by her waist to put her fully into his lap, “Well that depends, Pans. What’s in it for me?”
After having showered, he Floo’d right over to her flat to find that she was dreadfully underprepared for his visit.
Draco watched her walk away until his attention had shifted when Anthony’s hands started to roam from his shoulders to his lower back. Normally, he wouldn’t have complained, and possibly even taken it a step further, but since they were in front of Potter, Draco couldn’t help but feel a bit odd about it.
Was this all a dream? It certainly felt like it, but the awkwardness of the situation made it all too real. He huffed and turned to Pansy, “You are the worst friend ever.”
The issue had a portrait of Potter along with some other less-important Auror, as it read in big, bold letters,
“I have to admit,” Blaise whispered, “I wasn’t expecting to go gallivanting through any dangerous dungeons today.”
“You really should fix that if you don’t want guests accidentally witnessing something that may scar them,” He looked around her flat for a chair to sit in and was genuinely surprised. It was bigger than his, that was for sure, although it was fairly obvious that she had just moved in as unpacked boxes still littered the living room.
Robards face was as cold as ice as he spoke, furrowing his brows as he expressed disdain towards Draco’s father, “We need you on the case, nobody in our ranks has the knowledge you do on an artefact as powerful as this. If what we’ve found in our reports is true, Lucius may be trying to use it to bring the Dark Lord back.”
The group seemed in agreement and soon they all aparrated outside of the restaurant, away from the view of the street. Draco, suddenly realizing he still wore his robes, removed them and sent it through the portkey he used for when he forgot things at his office. Draco hadn’t noticed, but as soon as he smelled the freshly cooked food and spices in the air, he realized he desperately needed to eat something. He hadn’t all day due to his anxiety regarding Rotterdam.
Harry blinked, turning to face Draco, his face suddenly baring no emotion other than acknowledgment of the man standing in front of him, “Sorry, I forgot who I was talking to for a moment. Just follow me this way.”
“When Pansy reached out to us about throwing you a surprise party, I had a feeling you would react poorly,” Harry smirked, pressing his wire-framed glasses back up his nose.
Robards smiled at him then, a full smile that conveyed the satisfaction of adding a new hire onto the case, “Fantastic! Now I’ll just hand you these.”
“Well good,” Draco replied smugly, leaving Pansy on the dance floor with Anthony, as he sauntered over to the table.
“You know, you’re not as much of a prick as you were in school,” Anthony had said, and Draco definitely saw green in his eyes now, although he was pretty sure when he walked in, they were blue.
“I have.” Draco responded, handing him back the newly signed documents Robards had given to him previously, “I’ve decided it’s in my best interests to accept.”
“Attention everyone,” Robards cleared his throat before making his announcement. Several Aurors entered the room, leaving their offices as Robards spoke, doing nothing to level the anxiety in Draco’s mind, “I would like to introduce our new recruit, Draco Malfoy, who will be working on the case with us. Given his exemplary academic record and previous work with the Ministry, Draco will be acting as Lead Investigator and Keeper of Dark Artefacts. I expect each one of you to welcome Draco into this department with open arms and an open mind. If I catch word of any of you speaking ill of Mr. Malfoy during his time with us, you will be taken off of the case. That is all.”
“Mr. Malfoy,” A voice rang from across the hall, causing the blonde wizard to look up from the copy of the Daily Prophet that laid upon the waiting room table, “Follow me, please.”
Draco felt the anger rising in his voice, though he hated directing his anger towards his mother, the one person in the world that loved him for who he was.
on said objects. Working independently meant he hadn’t much of an office, resulting in him often working at home, but it suited him far better than staying at the Manor and feeding off of his family’s dwindling wealth.
Harry raised his hand to the sky to ask a question. The familiarity of it made Draco feel like he was back at Hogwarts, which was both a welcoming feeling and a disturbing one.
His eyes followed Blaise as he moved past a group of people congregating near the bar, in order to get the bartender’s attention, although Blaise must have recognized someone because, in that moment, he was chatting away with the patrons at the bar. Normally, Draco would have thought that Blaise was making casual conversation with the random strangers, but the way Blaise had reacted, almost enthusiastically, to seeing them meant he must have recognized them.
Blaise and Harry talked quietly enough so that he couldn’t hear what they were saying, until eventually Draco’s vision started to spot and the next thing he knew, he was leaning against a warm and firm body until that body disappeared and he recalled the familiar feeling of his silk sheets rubbing against his face. He buried himself into his pillows and within moments he had given into unconsciousness. He could’ve sworn though, as he faded into a deep sleep, he heard a voice speak softly into the abyss.
to light the way. Behind him, he could hear Blaise and Harry landing on the rocky ground and following his lead.
“Thanks for that, Pans,” Draco rubbed his face, still feeling slightly groggy, “but why are you here?”
Draco let out a slow breath, afraid that his beating hard would betray him by pounding loudly enough that the Head Auror would hear it.
“I, uh, polished it for you, before you came. I mean, I’ve had it a while, I just knew I would see you again at some point, so…” Harry stammered, running a hand through his untamed hair, his rounded glasses slowly sliding down his nose until he pushed them back up again. If Draco didn’t know any better, he would’ve said Harry was downright bashful. But sadly, he did know better.
“Theodore took her home.” Anthony said from behind him, allowing his beating heart to ease itself for a moment.
A moment of silence passed until Draco began to breathe deeply out through his mouth and in through his nose until his heart rate relaxed a bit.
“What type of services do you provide?” Potter raised a brow at the burly old man, noting how his red face became even redder at the question.
“I am,” Draco hesitated, “although, I don’t understand what the Head of the Auror department would want with me.”
“It’s alright, you know. I get them too.” Potter spoke softly, stepping aside so that Draco could exit the stall.
Draco thought back on all the times his father spent working on the Time-Turner in his home. He remembered for many months after the war, Lucius’s cries of frustration could be heard throughout the whole house when he couldn’t get the damned thing to work. Perhaps his “business” that kept him out of the country for so long was really him trying to find someone to fix it for him.
Draco thought to himself before making a timely escape down the stairs and onto the dimly lit street.
He felt Harry’s arm slide against his and a moment later they were standing in front of Harry’s home. Draco’s head pounded from the Apparation, but not enough to distract him from the burning feeling of Harry’s arm still gripping his. His grip tightened until they reached their destination and the look on Harry’s face made Draco come to the conclusion that he didn’t like Apparating much either. Their closeness became apparent to the both of them fairly soon after they arrived, as they both pulled apart immediately after. Draco, straightening his coat jacket, began to recognize the outside of his home.
Blaise opened his mouth to speak but Irma spoke first, “I imagine the two of you have quite a history then.”
Blaise had laughed as if it was the funniest insult he had ever heard. Had Draco been sober, he would have come up with a humiliating comeback to wipe that smug look off the Weasel’s face. Unfortunately, Ronald was not the only one who was incredibly plastered, as most people around him started laughing at the incredibly stupid insult. He found that he couldn’t contain his laughter either and bellowed alongside with Blaise, mostly for the fact that Zabini looked like he was about to rupture an artery from how hard he was laughing.
“And what about you?” She waggled her eyebrows at him, “Is there a witch that’s finally caught your eye?”
He shook silently until Potter placed a reluctant hand on his shoulder, “I want to help you, Draco.”
She looked shocked, but kept her mouth shut. The rest of the group just sat there, not saying a word.
“Isn’t that the truth,” Anthony clinked their glasses together at that, bringing Blaise and Justin’s attention back to them.
Potter, still sporting glasses but with slightly changed features and slightly different colored hair, handed Draco a flask of polyjuice as his disguise was starting to fade, “What should we be looking for?”
Draco felt tears start to form but he blinked them back before they had the chance to fall. He was so tired of wasting his tears and his breath.
That peaked his interest. Draco still stood by the exit, waiting to hear more before ultimately making his escape.
“Well what are we waiting for?” Potter stood up then, motioning for the others to follow as he made his way to the catacombs.
“I don’t need any information, Mr. Malfoy. None that you could give me that I don’t already know. I brought you here to hire you on for a case.”
Harry opened his mouth, but Ron, utterly sloshed, interrupted and spat at Draco, “What would you know about being an Auror, ferret?”
“Look, all I’m saying,” Blaise hesitated, as his voice softened to a barely audible murmur, “is to be careful, Draco.”
he was a better person than he was back then. He looked down at the rolled-up sleeves of his cream-colored shirt to find the Dark Mark visible for the world to see. Most days he didn’t notice it, but at that moment, it was all he could see. Letting his head hang, he took a deep breath and prepared for whatever would accompany him the moment he walked out of that bathroom.
“Yes,” he swallowed, hesitating before he spoke, “but I thought all of the Ministry’s Time-Turners were lost.”
Robards huffed, scratching at his chin, “I figured as much. Well, back to it, I suppose. I’ll see you tomorrow then, lad. Bright and early!”
“So you’ve got yourself a flat around here, yeah? I’m surprised you didn’t buy a wizarding home.” Draco sipped at the last of his drink, before wiping his mouth with a carefully folded napkin.
Dropping to his feet, he was surprised to find yet another entryway leading to something that looked like a dungeon of some sorts. He walked towards the darkening tunnels, using
you’ve finally figured it out,” Her loud, boisterous laugh caused a few Muggles to turn their heads around, but it didn’t stop Pansy from being as loud as ever.
Draco might have snickered, if he wasn’t taking a long, hard sip of his gin and tonic. Wiping his mouth with the napkin in front of him, he smirked, “’Lots changed since then.”
Draco stopped as he reached the door, noticing the powerful protection charms over it. Blaise was right, if this was the Curse-Breaker working with his father, he knew it was a possibility that his father was inside. He took a deep breath, feeling his heart pound against his ribcage before knocking against the wood.
The rest of their afternoon together was quite pleasant, as they steered the topic away from the horrors of the night before. Eventually, Pansy had to leave, and Draco had to go as well. As they parted ways, a promise of later engagements passed their lips, and for once, Draco felt excited about the aspect of seeing his old friends again.
Time-Turners were tricky and required extra careful use lest he got caught in the past or a continuous time loop. He couldn’t really use it per se without time-traveling and so he instead focused on the design of it, noting every detail about the Time-Turner itself to make sense of how Lucius might have broken it. But the unfortunate reality was that he wouldn’t really be able to understand the nature of the Time-Turner or the curse placed upon it until it was in his hands. He tried not to focus on that fact as he twirled the artefact between his fingers.
Draco could have died right there, utterly mortified by what he’d done. Part of him was still in disbelief that Potter was there at all, nonetheless somewhat
Robards nodded, decidedly amused at Draco’s bewildered expression, “Yes. I would need you to work alongside with my team on our current case. Normally, I wouldn’t require an outsider to work on such a highly-sensitive case, but due to the nature of the investigation, your assistance could be invaluable.”
Even so, being in their presence gave him a nervous feeling that even his pride couldn’t shake off. Perhaps it was the fact that his past wasn’t so completely erased that people around him would forget that the dark mark stood unabashedly against his skin. Or, even worse, perhaps it was knowing how close he was to the presence of Potter – that even being in the same building as him was enough to put Draco on edge. The only reassurance he had was the thought that Potter was a busy man; Draco doubted he would have the time to busy himself with mundane office work when he seemed to be out in the world, killing dark wizards, or throwing them in Azkaban. The thought was equally as disturbing to him as Potter actually
“You don’t seem to be enjoying yourself much, though,” Anthony pointed out, staring at Draco’s bare forearms as they leaned against the railing.
Draco laughed at his friends, seeing Pansy grind up on Blaise and Theodore all at once. Justin and Millicent seemed to be having a good time as well, as did the rest of the group. Even Ron’s goofy face as he danced with Granger almost made Draco want to smile. They all seemed so happy now. Not at all like the hollowed out, empty faces he had seen years ago.
At the end of Robards’ speech, he ushered Draco into a room with a glass door and an empty desk. It was one of the larger offices he’d seen with a separate door leading directly to the evidence room, or as the Auror’s liked to call it, the Dark room.
“I know I shouldn’t have waited so long,” Harry finally broke the silence with a soft mutter as he stared intently at Malfoy’s wand, “I just wasn’t ready to see you yet.”
With that, Weasley left the room, still refusing eye contact with Draco. It was probably for the best, Draco decided. He didn’t need to receive a scowl from the weasel this early in the morning, for it would surely ruin his day.
Draco knew this day would come, but he feared it regardless. His face grew pale and his hands became cold and clammy, “It’s a warning. He knows I’m here looking for him.”
“What’s that you’ve got?” He wasn’t necessarily curious but needed to say something just so that they wouldn’t sit there in silence, as they’ve done before.
Draco recognized the look on his face - pure, unsolicited lust - it was. He’d seen it one to many times while at school. Blaise has always been a dog, even as an adult.
Pansy sat across from him, staring unrelentingly with a snarky smile on her face, “So, Mittens, huh?”
Robards shook his head, “Not to our knowledge. As I was saying, we were unable to track his location past Belgium until Auror Weasley and his team got word of someone matching the target’s description in Rotterdam.”
"I wasn’t the one who named him,” Draco smiled slightly at the memory, “A floor down from my flat, there’s a Muggle family with a young daughter. When I found him, she called him that because of his white paws. The name sort of stuck. It’s the only name he responds to.”
Potter said nothing then, contributing to the group conversation had by the rest of them. Something about Quidditch team players and who was the better of the two. Draco found he couldn’t care less. Once upon a time, Draco would have jumped at the opportunity to discuss Quidditch with anyone, but it had been so many years and so much has happened since then that he lost interest over the years. What was once a happy memory of his childhood was corrupted by the war too. Sometimes, he wished he could go back to when Harry and him would chase after the snitch for hours. Brooms bumping into each other, hair flying in the wind, wild laughter echoing behind them and the exhilarating competition of childhood rivalries; things were happier then and a lot simpler too.
“Now then,” Robards exhaled sharply, using his wand to bring an enclosed case towards the examination table near Draco’s office door, “perhaps you can enlighten me on this particular artefact.”
“Where to, lads? And lady?” Blaise asked the group, humbly bowing his head to the sole female in the group. Draco wanted to roll his eyes at the sight, but avoided doing so in hopes that Blaise wouldn’t say something to embarrass him later on.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that. He felt his cheeks begin to flush as a sharp knock on the door brought his attention back to the reality of the situation.
He hated how frequently it happened, seemingly for no reason at all. He blamed it on the stressful day, but even that wasn’t an excuse for his behavior. Now the whole lot of them probably thought him a freak, or worse than whatever it was they already thought of him. Turning the faucet on, he splashed his face with cold water, hoping it would calm him. He couldn't stop hyperventilating, despite knowing he wasn’t in any imminent danger.
Draco was stuck admiring the foyer. Though it was covered in dust and cobwebs, it was a beautifully decorated home. Draco credited it to the last matron of the house and his great Aunt, Walburga Black. He had heard many unpleasant stories about the woman but had never met her himself. He supposed that was for the best; he doubted she would’ve been a fan of him. Despite that, It was a shame that her home had fallen into such disarray, though even he could not rest the blame on Potter – the ancestral Black home had been all but abandoned throughout his childhood.
"Now there is a bit of paperwork to be done, since you will be assisting my colleagues on the case, but since you’ve worked with the Ministry before, I’m sure it will be no problem for you. I’ll assign a small team to work under you, when the need arises in which your skills could be of use. Also, I’ll notify the other departments in case you need any aid from them as well. I may need you working out on the field alongside with the other Aurors, however, I don’t expect you to follow the same training protocols. While I can’t tell you the details of the case until after you’ve signed the contract, I must warn you that it may be dangerous. Do you have any questions?”
Draco waggled his eyebrows at Potter, not particularly meaning it in a suggestive way, but more to get a reaction out of the man.
Before Draco had the chance to say anything in response, Anthony closed the distance between them and planted a firm kiss on his lips. It was a warm, pleasant feeling, and yet Draco could not find the ability to allow himself to relax into it. His body remained stiff and cold, his lips unmoving and unresponsive as Anthony pressed his lips unto his.
“Draco?” Blaise placed a hand upon his shoulder. Quickly, Draco turned around to realize that Potter and the rest of the crew were waiting on him to give the orders, “Are you feeling alright?”
“Not only that, but now I'm to search for my father who may be trying to bring the Dark Lord back.” Draco sighed, still feeling numb to the fact that this was his life now and
He paused with his hand on the door handle, turning his head to look back at the blond-haired wizard.
“Do you not realize how amazing of an opportunity this is, Draco?” She asked, eyes lighting up with zeal, “Working for the Ministry, you’d be set for life! You can move out of your shitty flat-“
Harry sighed, “It’s not that, I just thought somehow with all this time passed, he would be...different.”
As he struggled to walk in a straight line out of the bathroom, he was surprised to find that Potter and his entourage had disappeared from where they originally were and instead merged with his group. Draco’s stomach churned, and he decided it was half from the alcohol sloshing around in his stomach, and half from the anxiety of having to face all those people.
There it was, in all its glory. 10 inches long, hawthorn wood – it was just as he remembered it. He had gotten a replacement in the years past, of course, but none felt as right nor as natural as that one did. Draco didn’t even realize the tremors racking his body until he tried to move and found he couldn’t without shaking uncontrollably. He was paralyzed, and in his shock, he found himself speechless as well. Harry refused to make eye contact, and Draco couldn’t find it in him to look at his longtime enemy either. Had Draco not been as stubborn as he was, he wouldn’t have fought the urge to shrink down into himself, like he normally would have.
She motioned between Harry and Draco who sat directly across from each other. Their eyes met and for a moment, Draco thought he saw a glint of hurt and sadness in them. He tried not to think about it as he looked directly down at his feet.
He paused suddenly, as Draco exited the evidence room and entered his office once more, “Tell me, Mr. Malfoy, do you keep in contact with your father?”
The sun had just barely set and from the streaks of pastels in the sky, Draco could see it would be another clear night. Frankly, they were starting to become rarer as the seasons began to change. The memory of the grey skies casting over the Manor earlier that day sat uneasily in his mind. He took a deep breath, letting the air fill his lungs for a precious few minutes before he heard the sliding of the glass door and footsteps coming from behind him. Exhaling sharply, he turned around to face the intruder of his peace. Draco half-expected it to be Harry but felt the unmistakable sense of disappointment to find it was, in fact, Anthony Goldstein who had joined him outside on the balcony.
However, it wasn’t enough for Draco to act with forethought. Grabbing his wand, which had now fallen beneath the dining room table upon opening the letter, he cast a quick
Despite being acquitted, most of his parents’ assets were frozen after the trial, and Draco realized, much sooner than his parents did, that they couldn’t live the Malfoy lifestyle any longer. Besides, fixing the Vanishing Cabinet during sixth year was one of the few things he quite enjoyed, despite the reasoning behind it. The impenetrable focus his job required allowed his mind to relax and his thoughts to disperse. It was one of the few times during the day in which he felt at peace.
On nights like this when Draco felt the liquid courage sloshing around in his stomach, he loved to take walks. Very seldom in his life was he ever allowed to leave the grounds of the Manor, even for midnight strolls like this. Living on his own, he took advantage of the freedom that came with being able to go anywhere he wanted and do anything he wanted. Walking the streets at night when no one but the other drunk, lonely souls roamed up and down the pavement soon became another one of his creature comforts. Sometimes, he’d roam for hours, basking in the mundaneness of the existence of Muggle life, until exhaustion brought him back home. He envied them sometimes – he had lived through a war that they will never learn about, never hear about, never know about. He watched as they walked their dogs and their children with nary a frown or complaint and wondered what it was about the simplicity of their lives that made them so content. Perhaps that’s why he too yearned for that contentment in moving to a Muggle neighborhood. Nevertheless, he tried and failed to understand their behavior often. Only on nights like this, when he witnessed an inebriated man falling over under a streetlight, or a homeless woman screeching to herself in an alleyway that he truly began to empathize with them. They may be different from him fundamentally, but their madness is the same. It was comforting to him to know that he wasn’t the only fucked up one in the universe, with or without magic being involved.
Though his office was large, there simply weren't enough seats for all of them. Draco decided to move into the Dark Room, hoping that it would provide enough space for everyone, as well as a private room to discuss their findings. Luckily, there was already a table with multiple chairs near the entrance of the room, just waiting for them to arrive.
Harry stood awkwardly in the corner, waiting for his co-worker to acknowledge him, “Malfoy, are you alright? You’ve been staring at your empty desk for over an hour now.”
Draco was still a bit shell-shocked and did not respond. Eventually though, the man stared up at him, studying him in a way that made him feel simultaneously guilty and sheepish, for Merlin knows what reason.
“Yes, it’s actually just down the block from here. I’m having a bit of trouble trying to set up a Floo address there, but hopefully it should be done soon,” She paused, “Perhaps you can come to visit me then.”
Draco cleared his throat and gave them a curt nod, trying his best to seem as unaffected by the unexpected presence as possible, “Potter, Weasley. What brings you here?”
Just looking at it left a sour taste in Draco’s mouth, but he chose to ignore it as he discarded the newspaper and moved towards the voice.
“Right, well if you were your father, where would you go?” Potter turned to Draco, eyes bright with inquiry.
“Ixion was the son of a king and he murdered his father-in-law. Zeus took pity on him and invited him to dine with the gods, but he grew lustful of Zeus’s wife, Hera. Zeus tricked him by creating a cloud in the shape of Hera and Ixion slept with it, and so Zeus condemned him to a fiery wheel, where he would fall and roll in the Underworld for all of eternity.”
Draco vividly remembered the day he set off on his own. He had been sitting and stewing in his room for months, feeling as if he would tear his own skin off if he had to listen to his father preach to him and his mother about how they were going to fix their soiled reputation. It hadn’t been long after their trial, in which Harry Potter testified in favor of the Malfoys being pardoned. Lucius had seen better days. He bore dark circles under his eyes and looked paler than usual. His long and elegant platinum hair was no longer kept cleanly, instead looking brittle and frazzled. He had always admired his father, but looking at him then, he was nothing more than a madman. His mother was no better, clinging to their old ways by planning soirees and engagement parties to set Draco up with some pure-blood girl he’d never even met.
A week had passed before Pansy had written to Draco, inviting him over. From his embarrassing, self-pitying display last week, he was surprised that she had written at all. Although he probably should not have been. She couldn’t have had many friends around besides himself, after being away for so long.
And with that, Pansy grabbed a handful of Draco’s platinum hair and forcefully pulled his head to hers and they met in a wet, obnoxious, and obscene kiss. She was stronger than she looked, as she led him through the motions of it. Had he not been completely, utterly, and hopelessly gay, he daresay he would have enjoyed it. Instead, when they finally pulled away for a breath, Draco had to fight not to gag, causing all the Slytherins to laugh, while everyone else stared at them in disbelief.
“Millicent, you look great! You lost so much weight,” Pansy practically gushed over the woman in front of her, who really did in fact, look quite beautiful.
Robards leaned back into his chair now, seemingly much more relaxed than that booming voice of his would lead you to believe. “The Ministry has contracted you for your work on more than one occasion, and I have to say I’m impressed. We could use your skills here, in our department.”
“Seriously, Draco,” Pansy rested her hand on his shoulder, feeling the warmth emanating from his body, “I think you should go for it.”
Lucius began to shake with fury, but Narcissa spoke to try and mediate the situation, “Draco, please be reasonable! You will learn to love her with time.”
He followed her, feeling the walls begin to shrink around him as the familiar black walls with paintings adorned of previous Malfoys and Blacks taunted him. He hated coming home.
Draco couldn’t remember the last time he stood so close to Potter. Thinking back, Draco remembered his arms gripping around Potter’s waist as they rode on his broom, away from the Fiendfyre threatening to kill them all. He can still remember the smell of ash all around him if he closed his eyes.
written on it. Eventually, he crumpled it up in his hands and threw it away as he walked out onto the streets.
“We just want to ask you a few questions,” Potter spoke up from behind him, though the vexed man stared only at Draco.
Draco placed the Time-Turner back into its enclosed clase, muttering the locking spell Robards taught him. When he stood, finally stretching out his legs, he replied to Blaise, “Thank Potter, he was the one who recommended you.”
“No, mother, I can’t. I...” He started, though his voice began to falter as he realized that this was it - his one defining moment, “I...like men.”
Potter nodded once and Draco left to go up the stairs. He searched and scoured through every exhibit he could find. Not long passed before Draco realized that there was nothing there and Lucius was gone. What was the point of him coming to this museum, of all places? It made no sense to him. It was clear Lucius had turned into a madman following the war, but even so, what was he to gain from this? What was he to gain by popping up in a Muggle art museum so far from home?
With that, the Head Auror left Draco in a tizzy, alone in his new office. He didn’t know how to feel. A part of him was excited at the prospect of having so much power in his position, yet the downside of it was the fact that his entire job was centered around the fact that he was expected to aid in the capture of his father. Had he just found out the news today, he might have fainted on his new employer. His rather embarrassing escapade after eavesdropping on Potter and his friends proved rather useful. At least this way, he had more time to let it settle. Now, his most difficult mission was not finding his father, nor the Time-Turner, but telling his mother the news.
What was left of Draco’s sober mind forced him to look at himself in the mirror. He was not the same idiotic teenager that he was when he knew Harry. He was a grown man, and one who worked hard for the life he had. He wasn’t a slave to his father’s name anymore, and he shouldn’t feel ashamed when he
His face crumpled in desperation – it was clear Weasley wanted nothing more than to return to the safety of the Ministry.
"You’re a former Death Eater,” the man stated simply, allowing Draco to give into the dread that filled his stomach, “Oh, no need to give me that look. I wouldn’t send you a letter of employment if I wanted you arrested.”
Potter walked alongside him until they reached the entrance of the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen. He raised an eyebrow at him, as if to ask if they should enter. Draco gave him a  curt nod before following the latter inside. Luckily, the Auror department had an extensive collection of polyjuice and other Muggle disguises so they didn’t stick out like sore thumbs while investigating, instead looking like regular policemen.
“Did you go to Hogwarts?” Draco asked, wanting to change the conversation to anything but Potter. Regardless of his reasons being jealousy and anger, Harry looked thankful.
Pansy jumped in her seat excitedly, clapping her hands together like a seal, “I’m so happy for you, Draco! This is really going to turn things around for you, you’ll see.”
Onlookers inside the restaurant followed the noise with their glances, directing their attention back to him. His heart couldn’t stop racing. He hastily made his way to the men’s room, taking a deep breath of relief when he realized he was finally alone. Now, he could panic in peace.
Pansy looked like she could melt from how adorable his story was. The truth of the matter was, it wasn’t a sweet story at all. When Draco found that cat, it was in the back of an alley of a Muggle bar, where Draco sat, drunk out of his mind, and having one of the worst meltdowns since the war ended. He had just moved out of the manor. He had just told his family the truth, and his father, the man who he looked up to his whole life, refused to speak to him. He remembered flashes of the war – his hands shook, just as they had when pointing his wand at Dumbledore. Every time he closed his eyes, he saw it. Then, he heard a soft purr as Mittens approached him. He was a runt, small and feeble, and it was clear that he was just a kitten, but nonetheless, he fearlessly approached Draco and soon enough, was able to snap him out of his flashback.
What does it mean?” Blaise craned his head over to Draco who narrowed his eyes at the magical lettering.
the Malfoy way. Even still, his father barely talked to him as it was, so nothing really changed much. Perhaps it was for the best, Draco thought, that their relationship could never go back to the way it was.
“Should we split up?” Potter asked when they reached an outdoor exhibit, showing out of place, misfigured statues of some sort. This modern art, Draco realized, he simply didn’t understand.
“I was also surprised to hear you advocated for me,” Blaise met Draco’s gaze, trying to change the subject from his father.
As scandalized as he was, he couldn’t help the small tug at the corner of his lips, giving into the slightest smile.
“Pansy! I’m so glad to see you,” Millicent practically ran over to the much shorter female, pulling her into a crushing hug.
Draco looked at the man, confused, until he realized he was staring at Potter again. His green eyes, which were far brighter than Draco remembered, bored into his, forcing him to answer a question he never even asked, and one that Draco fought hard to suppress.
“Our wealth is dwindling since father disappeared, mother. The Aurors have been tracking him and they believe he is in possession of a Time-Turner. I didn’t want it to be true, but it is. They spotted him in Belgium seeking a Curse-Breaker.”
“Like I said before,” Draco gave Blaise a pointed look to which the latter rolled his eyes, “coming here was pointless. My father is just trying to throw us off of his trail.”
Draco shrugged, feeling utterly drained by the events of the day. He regretted accepting Potter’s invitation at all. He should have known better than to force himself to be social when being social was the last thing he wanted to do.
Draco sobbed in her arms, for the first time perhaps ever. Years of trauma weighed heavily on his mind, and at that moment, he couldn’t be bothered to put up the front he always had. The thunder roared outside, but the Manor was quiet. The only noise that could be heard in that parlour were the silent sobs of Draco holding his mother, terrified of the moment he had to let go and face his problems head on. Violent images wracked his mind, as he rested his head on her shoulder.
“Now for the fun part,” Robards smiled back at him before leading him through the hallway that Draco entered from, “Follow me.”
The mood changed, and after that, neither of them could carry on the conversation. She knew better than to talk about him, knew how sensitive of a subject it was. Still, he couldn’t blame her. He even felt a bit of guilt seeing how quickly she tucked her tail between her legs, like a kicked puppy.
As he stepped into the Manor, he was unsurprised to feel the massive headache that often accompanied him on these visits. He tried not to think of the horrible memories threatening his sanity as he passed the hallowing hallways into his mother’s parlor, which seemed to be the only room in the house that the Dark Lord didn’t corrupt. That didn’t surprise him; his mother greatly prided herself in keeping this room to herself, as if it was her little secret getaway from the dreadful events this house had endured.
Potter shrugged, “Just barely. I picked up a book this morning after hearing about our new assignment.”
He refused to look at the ashen-haired man, despite him sitting within listening distance of the two conspiring Aurors. Draco just sat there, looking wildly uncomfortable as they discussed the capture of his father, a newfound discovery since his last excursion to the muggle bar where he overheard the Aurors’ plans.
off of a book that looked tattered and dusted over, though he wouldn’t have minded to sink his claws into it and take it home with him.
“Have you kept up with the others much?” She asked, and for a moment he was confused. Up until recently, he hadn’t kept up with much of anyone.
He danced with Anthony briefly and Pansy who just groped and rubbed and pushed herself against him. From the corner of his eye, he could see that Harry, Granger and Weasley had all taken their seats and seemed to be in deep conversation about something. It was obvious Harry wasn’t the dancing type, or simply wasn’t drunk enough for it. The trio turned to look at him every now and then, but Draco’s attention was elsewhere when he felt Pansy’s hands on his shoulders, as she turned the drunken man around to face her.
He chuckled, “I haven’t seen Blaise piss drunk in ages. I wonder if he still acts like a prat every time he drinks, or if he’s finally grown out of it.”
Lucius slammed his fist against the mahogany table, causing his mother’s porcelain tea set to shake from where it stood atop the surface. Draco felt his whole body seize, flinching at the noise. Narcissa sipped her tea as if all was normal and fine, not even blinking an eye at the sudden outburst.
The words rung through him like an echo, repeated over and over again. It was a question that he dared not answer, because he already knew why – despite everything he’s done to change everything about himself and his lifestyle, he knew that he would spend eternity paying for his sins. He would always pay the price for the actions of a terrified teenager who didn’t know any better.
i'm sorry it took me so long to upload this. I've had some serious health issues lately, but I'm in recovery and am feeling much better! Thank you to all who've stuck with me and this story this long. I appreciate it more than words can describe.
Draco, we thought you’d never figure it out. With all that stalking Potter, vying for his attention- “
A knock on his door threatened his peace, but he knew he had to answer it. Shrugging off his black overcoat, he opened the door to find Harry standing on the other side of it.
He shook his head, trying to be understanding, “I’m not doing it for the money. Besides, there’s something you should know.”
“Why here? At a Muggle art museum?” Potter wondered out loud, taking in some of the hyperrealistic art pieces around him.
“Yes, well…” He trailed off, not really knowing what to say at that. He saw Longbottom and Potter’s face and knew well that they were as uncomfortable as he was.
Harry stood in front of him, wearing a grey cotton button-down and jeans - nothing particularly special, but seeing him out of Auror robes, standing in the doorway of his bedroom was off-putting, to say the least. Draco could feel his mouth go dry and his palms begin to sweat when he realized Harry meant to enter the room- an unlikely situation that Draco never imagined to happen outside of his dreams.
She held his face in her hands, like only a mother would. It was then that Draco realized he couldn’t keep it together any longer. Hot, fat tears poured out of him, as the memory of Harry’s words pierced him deeper than any wound ever could. Perhaps he was right, and all those years Draco spent living paycheck to paycheck in his tiny broom closet of a flat, all those years of building a life for himself were all for nothing. He hadn’t changed. He was still the same. And worst of all, Harry saw right through him.
Weasley straightened his back upon seeing the former Death Eater. He said nothing to him while he remained in Robards’ office. Instead, he leaned over his boss’s desk to direct his attention to the stack of documents he laid out in front of him.
despite his colorful past, as Anthony tactfully put it. In school, Draco liked being the center of attention. He liked being the leader of a group, and he liked having people look up to him. Now? In the present? Draco couldn’t hate the attention more.
“I don’t,” His tone came out harsher than he intended, but it was a miracle in itself that he was able to form a sentence to begin with, “work for the Ministry. I work independently. The Ministry has contracted me for my work once or twice.”
It had been three days since he received the Head Auror’s offer of employment, though his thoughts remained in shambles. When Pansy surprised him with an unannounced visit that Saturday evening, he felt obliged to take her someplace nice to discuss the big news, mostly because she insisted after gossiping about it with Blaise. Instead, they found themselves at a Muggle pub down the road from Draco’s flat. It certainly wasn’t anything magnificent, but it was less crowded than the clubs and bars Pansy had suggested, which was good enough for him.
Robards looked pleased as he clasped his hands together, “Excellent. Now then! Onto a more important note.”
A few hours before the meeting with his newly appointed team, Draco made a discovery. Upon examining the Ministry’s Time-Turner, he realized that the one his father had in his possession was unique. Not only was it unique in the fact that it was a true Time-Turner, but it was one crafted by Lucius himself. He remembered seeing it once while examining Lucius’s study, days before he had left his family home. He remembered that it bore no inscription, though he always found it odd. Comparing it to the one in his hands currently, he realized why.
“This calls for a celebration,” Pansy grinned, holding her second martini up in the air as if she were about to give a toast, “I’ll plan everything, of course, but we really should plan it sooner than later.”
Draco shook his head fervently, “No parties, please. I don’t need to be called a traitor by everyone I’ve ever known, thank you very much.”
He grabbed his coat from the rack, shrugging it on before taking a few steps towards the door. Narcissa called his name, prompting him to crane his head around before exiting.
At that, Pansy blushed a bit, “Oh, it was no big deal. We’re adults, who says we can’t have some fun?”
wouldn’t be able to Apparate safely, nor use the Floo. It seemed his only option was to take the Tube.
Pansy had always been a sarcastic flirt and a tease, and besides Blaise, Theodore seemed to be the only person who could put her in her place from time to time. While Pansy fought to get out of Theodore’s lap, Justin went to grab more drinks for everyone.
Robards replied, “He was last spotted in Belgium, looking for a Curse-Breaker. It seems whatever he tried using it for backfired and the object is now cursed, or broken in some way.”
As always, feel free to comment your thoughts/feelings/questions about this chapter, and I will do my best to answer them! Have a great weekend everyone!
Pansy snickered, “I have many wonderful qualities, Malfoy. Unfortunate for you, merciful is not one of them.”
The bewilderment of the crowd matched the bewilderment Draco felt during that entire announcement. Some faces looked angry, others not so much. Longbottom was clearly not pleased, though Weasley maintained a coolness to his expression that made it seem like he couldn’t care less. However, none of the faces looked the least bit surprised upon seeing him. Rumors spread fast, Draco has come to realize, and since his first venture to the Auror department, people had already begun to figure out that Draco was soon to be employed there.
Not long after their groups integrated with one another, Pansy and Theodore made their way to the dance floor, despite the fact that there probably wasn’t a dance floor to begin with. From seeing how Pansy wrapped her entire body around the man, it was clear she likely wasn’t going home alone. After that, Justin led Lovegood and many others as they danced to a Muggle pop song that Draco had heard of once or twice from the shops nearby. Eventually, all that was left behind was Ginny, Harry, Anthony and Draco. Even Longbottom was too hammered to say no to dancing, and from the way he moved his body, Draco could tell he was just as drunk as he looked. Anthony, who Draco had barely talked to since Harry came by, put his arm around Draco’s shoulders once more.
“We have reason to believe another Time-Turner exists, a true Time-Turner, without the regulated Hour-Reversal Charm placed onto it.” Robards gave Draco a careful look, almost as if to examine his reactions very closely, “It is in your father's possession.”
“Oh my god,” Draco fell back into his bed, hoping that the smooshed pillow over his face would end his suffering and suffocate him.
Narcissa said nothing but when they met each other’s gaze, Draco felt an ache in his chest, an ache for all that was lost.
“Enough!” He screamed. The volume and pitch of his voice, now shredded with rage, was terrifying, “You WILL marry a pure-blooded girl, this is not up for discussion!”
She rolled her eyes at him again, but this time, with a playful smile at her lips, “Where’s your sense of adventure, Malfoy?”
Robards squinted at the scroll that stood on the pedestal next to it, struggling to read the inscription, “I believe that is the Scroll of Death. Once a name is written in black ink on the scroll, the person whose name is written dies within the hour.”
Draco knew she’d say that, still willfully blind to the fact that their name simply didn’t hold the same power it once did. The reality was that their assets were near frozen after the trial, especially after Lucius disappeared and the Aurors got word of his malicious plans.
“I have to say Pans, you’ve changed quite a bit,” Blaise looked the woman up and down, with a smirk on his face, “In fact, you look like even more of a slag than before.”
He fought that anger every time he saw Potter. He felt it knotting his insides, twisting and churning painfully, but he refused to give it life. As much as he wanted to yell and scream at the man standing in front of him, the anger died inside of him before it could begin to fester. Instead, he felt something cutting deeper, threatening to eat him alive – utter fucking misery.
Instead he casted a quick, wandless drying spell and stretched uncomfortably from where he was sitting. He just hoped in the few minutes he took to relax that nobody would recognize-
“Oh stop it. He was nothing but a gentleman the whole night.” The look on her face forced her to act casually, but Draco could see past it – the way her eyes lit up, and the way her cheeks bore the slightest pink tinge.
To their surprise, the latin words appeared instantly, with the same shimmery ink they had seen in Rotterdam.
Draco had just about had it listening to the same rubbish over and over again. He couldn’t care less about getting married, all he wanted was to stop feeling so empty all the damn time.
“My dear,” Narcissa stood abruptly as she took in his appearance and walked over to him, worry etched into her features, “What’s wrong? Has something happened?”
It was Pansy, of course, who poured them down his throat, one by one from Draco’s liquor cabinet - which was soon to be emptied by the rate things were going thus far. An hour or so had passed, and the anger he felt towards his longtime friend had dulled to the point of total apathy when he realized how much fun everyone else was having. His Slytherin friends mostly kept to themselves but were friendly enough to the others. Harry had found himself at the center of attention, as per usual, telling stories of his exploits on previous cases working under Robards. Blaise, Irma and Longbottom listened intently, chuckling at his gregarious attitude, and even Draco found it difficult to take his eyes off of the man as he told his tales in exaggerated detail. A part of him didn’t know if it was from the alcohol or from something else entirely. Perhaps it was a bit of both, but he was glad that the attention had finally shifted from awkward congratulations to adventurous tales. He wasn’t sure how much recognition he could possibly handle, given the circumstances.
He wasn’t entirely sure how he wanted to go about it. He imagined in his head that there would be some screaming and crying involved, but his mother was too sensible for that. She wasn’t like Draco - constantly struggling to deal with his emotions - no, she was more level-minded than anyone. Her strength was incredible, he only wished he could have inherited some of it rather than cowering in fear over his troubled past.
“Oh, that’s nothing,” Pansy squawked, donning the same pink flush Blaise was, “in fifth year, we played truth or dare in the Slytherin dorms, and I dared Blaise to kiss Millicent. I thought maybe he might have Apparated from how quickly he disappeared!”
“Draco,” Blaise eventually turned to share a quick embrace with him, “you look good. It’s been awhile.”
The lights were flickered on as soon as he entered and he suddenly recognized the faces of several people inside his flat. Blaise, Potter, Irma, and Longbottom sat at his dining table while Millicent, Theodore Nott, and a few other familiar faces packed themselves to the side of the door, bursting out a “Surprise!” as soon as he’d taken notice of them.
Soon enough, everyone had started to join in, even Harry himself couldn’t help the growing grin on his face. This was around the point Draco had realized, much later on, that his memory started to lapse and he started to lose all notion of sobriety.
He barely went to Diagon Alley as it was, but there were days when he could not deny that he needed to shop for supplies. Even so, the days he did go, he stuck to the shadows, lurking away from anyone who had the possibility of recognizing him. The whole thing was a bit childish, he could admit. Regardless, he didn’t want to risk getting jumped by self-righteous Potter fanatics who probably never even
Draco, unsure of how to answer her, opted for an awkward chuckle and a yes that sounded more like a question. Mittens, free from Draco’s grasp, came to Irma willingly and sat upon her lap, causing tears to well up in the drunk woman’s eyes. Draco took the opportunity to step out onto the balcony, hoping to get some fresh air, when Blaise, ever the lecher, replaced his seat and coyly placed an arm over Irma’s shoulders.
He felt a hand slap his back in merriment, to his right, he saw it was Blaise who winked at the shorter blonde wizard, “I’m happy for you both, really.”
The glass sliding door opened with a loud click, causing Draco and Anthony to abruptly pull away from each other, but not before Blaise, utterly wrecked, gasped, “What’s this? Malfoy and Goldstein snogging on the balcony? How romantic.”
After some time and several miles within the tunnels, they had passed through a particularly narrow passage, leading to a large entryway that must have been used as a barracks or storage room by the shape of it. The large, empty space left much to be desired, but Draco could see, in the distance, a well that stood in the center of it.
“Wait!” He started for the door, but Harry’s voice stopped him. “You’re leaving just like that? Without saying a word?”
Turning around, he saw a bewildered Harry Potter with his churlish red-headed companion by his side. The two looked exhausted, as if they had spent the entire morning either arresting criminals or killing them – which in all honesty, was quite likely.
He looked down at himself. He was wearing a white silk shirt, one of the nicest ones he owned, and black trousers, with a plain, but expensive, black robe over it. A reminder of the days in which he had wanted for nothing in the Manor. It wasn’t anything out of the ordinary.
He’d just started to get used to his presence, after working together for a number of weeks now. Day after day, he and the others would come through Draco’s office, strategizing and trying to find new leads regarding Lucius’s whereabouts since the trail had gone cold after their last excursion to Luxembourg. Most days, the pair were never alone, but as he stared into his green eyes, he was surprised to find himself pleased at the fact that it was him and not Blaise or Pansy, or some other uninvited guest trying to offer him comfort. Their relationship had gotten better for the most part; No more snarky side comments or otherwise unwillingness to play nice. Since the last time they were alone together in the bathroom of that restaurant, Draco realized that Harry was the last person to judge him for needing some time alone. In fact, he understood it all too well.
Draco fought hard not to scoff in front of his mother. His ‘business’ meant trying to rebuild the Malfoy name from the 6 foot grave it was dug under during the war, while staying as far away from Wizarding London as best as he could, lest the Aurors get a hint of whatever malicious plan he has yet to accomplish. From what it sounded like, he was trying to increase their influence elsewhere, if worse came to worst and staying at the Manor was no longer an option. Had Draco been the same person he was three years ago, this would have mattered a great deal to him, and he would likely have joined his father in his endeavors. The thought was now laughable to Draco in numerous ways.
Peering over his shoulder, Draco realized it was just the trio this time. A sigh of relief escaped his lungs. He didn’t need to have another Hogwarts reunion party if he were spotted this time around. Yet, the unfortunate reality of the situation was that if he were to get caught spying on the trio, he knew it would not end well for him, especially being that he was alone. He would have no explanation, other than to admit he was indeed spying on them.
“I forgot what it looked like,” Draco spoke softly, running the edge of his fingers along the edge of the wand.
Harry blinked at him, not really knowing what to say, and instead opted for another sip of his drink. Before long, Draco had joined the others, and eventually, so did Harry. For a short, ridiculous, drunken moment, they were all able to put aside their differences and just be human beings for once, and it felt
Draco found it difficult at times to control his anger. There were many instances in which his running thoughts became too present, too loud, and he had to fight the urge not to do or say something he regretted. Once, another lifetime ago, he wouldn’t have given a damn. He would have said and done anything to get a rise out of someone, especially Harry Potter. Years wasted on petty bullshit and superficial ideologies nearly killed him, and yet he was alive and others, much more deserving than him, were not. And for that, he would always wake up at night, screaming and trembling because of the nightmares that he lived through, forever plaguing his mind.
Harry snickered as well, stepping close enough to Draco that they stood shoulder-to-shoulder as they leaned against the sink wall, “And yet, sometimes I feel like you’re the only person I can relate to. You know what it’s like to walk into a room and have people whisper about you, half lies and half truths. You know how it feels to be reminded every damn day what we did or didn’t do.”
The man sputtered, causing Draco to instinctively throw a dirty look at Potter before reassuring the old man, “You don’t have to answer that. Thank you for your time, Sébastien. I just have one more question.”
A moment paused before a loud knock on the door of Draco’s office brought his attention back to the present. When he exited the Dark Room, he found Robards standing there, looking quite serious.
The rocks dug into themselves until they reached a solid bottom. Oddly enough, there was no water underneath the well, but a rather shallow puddle on the ground, and an empty space between, meaning there was another level below the catacombs that had been sealed by someone.
He didn’t know what to expect upon telling her. He thought maybe she’d be angry, appalled even. He wasn’t expecting her expression to remain unchanged, as if she’d already known.
Harry paid no mind and returned to his side, “You don’t have to apologize. I think if it were me, you’d do the same.”
Draco scowled at him as they walked to the opposite end of the Auror Department where their meeting was being held, “Shut it.”
Draco cleared his throat, taking a step back from the close approximation of Harry’s body, which had moved far too close for comfort. It wasn’t that he didn’t appreciate the history lesson, he just had no idea why he was there in the first place.
Harry seemed unconvinced, “Right...well, our shift is over. A few of us are getting drinks, would you like to join us?”
When Draco woke up the next morning, it wasn’t to the sound of chirping birds outside his window, or to Mittens purring at his bedside. When Draco had woken up the next morning, it was to the sound of the Floo in the living room.
“Come on, you’re missing the party! We’ve brought out the firewhiskey,” Pansy clapped her hands excitedly as she scurried off towards the kitchen where a handful of others were already drinking heavily.
At first, Draco was in denial. He just stood there, paralyzed as if someone cast Stupefy on him. Unable to move, or speak, he then began to feel anger. Anger at himself, but also at Potter, for thinking it was okay to just drop in his life out of the blue after all these years, when his life was
Draco felt as though he had no choice but to comply, despite knowing his proclivity towards alcohol was a bit...dangerous at times, if the memory of last time served correctly. Still, what else was there for him to do now that his safe space had been infiltrated by the likes of Pansy Parkinson herself? He and Harry exchanged a shrug before exiting the room together, knowing that whatever was to come now was certainly Pansy’s fault.
Draco let it slam behind him. The cold air of the outside hit him like a ton of bricks, and Draco suddenly couldn’t breathe. He tried and tried, but the more he gasped for air, the tighter his throat closed. Yet, he still walked on, refusing to look behind him as the House of Black transformed into a muggle building once more. Without a second thought, he whipped his newly returned wand and apparated home.
