Draco could hear the disappointment in her voice and though it hadn't been what he was trying to do he suddenly felt guilty. "I'm sorry," he mumbled though he did not move.
He fingered the signet ring he wore on his index finger thoughtfully. "Well there was the matter of the silencing charm..."
There were dozens of piles in the room, each of them grazed against the high ceiling which was dusty and covered in numerous cobwebs.
This took him aback. He hadn’t done anything but survive unfolding events. He smiled anyway. Ginny was good company and one of the few he’d missed speaking to once he stopped sleeping in Gryffindor Tower.
Draco strode towards the doors of the Room of Requirement which had been left ajar for some reason. Harry rushed to catch up with him.
Harry thought of telling them about his encounter with Malfoy in Hogsmeade but quickly dispelled the idea. They would read too much into it and he'd only been following Malfoy to find out what he was up to.
The door opened again and this time Draco was prepared for the flood of light. He didn’t look directly at it but instead, let it dance around his vision as his pupils adjusted.
Harry frowned and at that moment Haneul stepped out of the room with four wands in his left hand. Draco didn’t know how he knew which one was Harry’s but he tossed it at him.
Narcissa turned to Draco. Harry swallowed and turned to him as well. The expression on his face was blasé despite the tension Harry could feel. He lounged on the couch like he’d rather be anywhere else.
He shifted to his side so he could see Draco’s reaction better. There was a glimmer in his eyes now like there had been last night. It had sent him into a frenzy of lust yesterday. Draco had refused to escalate things but it still filled him now.
Draco watched him a moment, his face had the same look he’d seen this morning. He didn’t think Draco’s face had been built for uncertainty, why else would it look so strange on him?
He gripped the blond's arms then turned his body so that he was lying on his back. He prodded his cheek.
He nudged Harry’s head but he’d already gotten over his initial fear and only leaned into his touch. His fingers felt wonderful in his hair, war, soft and a little wet. Draco massaged his hair for a moment then pulled away as though he hadn't meant to indulge him.
He waited for Draco to say something. Draco only watched him with an unreadable expression. Harry didn’t wait to go around the bed. Draco had already taken several steps back now.
At that moment he couldn't help a laugh. It hovered just above his Adam's apple, bubbling on his lips, demanding to be set free. There was no happiness in it, merely a sort of resignation as though he was saying
Yet, of all of them, Blaise was the only one who didn’t give him a wide berth. Warrington and McNair had suggested cutting his hands off but had been too afraid to get any closer.
Malfoy set down the empty teacup and wiped crumbs off his lips with the back of his hand. It was an endearingly childish action. His stomach plummeted to his feet, however, at the seriousness in Dumbledore's eyes and the stiffness of Malfoy's posture.
Harry snapped his gaze towards him. Both he and his mother watched him with expectant expressions. Harry got over his shock at Draco’s use of his first name in the Manor fast. He tried to recall what they might have said to him.
Madam Pomfrey shot him an unforgiving look. "You will watch your tone young man or I will see to it that you are properly straightened out. And if I hear anymore vulgar language, I will ensure you freeze to death next time you end up here, am I clear?"
Merlin, if Harry could, he would break every bone in his body but he knew Draco would smile through it all, at least while he could see. That was what people who’d become numb to pain did, Harry knew the second he turned away, Draco would take that pain as his own, find a way to blame himself for it.
Upon closer inspection, it appeared he’d experienced a choking fit for a brief moment. Harry wasn’t sure why a request of his medical history would elicit such a reaction. But Draco was looking at his mother with a mortified expression.
People already cast him odd looks and the feeling in his gut, a sick feeling of wrongness, only intensified when he trudged to the nearest bench.
"Says who, Potter? In case you hadn't noticed, I could care less what you think." He swayed slightly strands of his too-long blonde hair falling over his shoulder. Harry had to quell the urge to reach out, he noticed an odd bulge in Malfoy's pockets.
Draco’s gaze shifted back to where Potter stood propped against the wall. The signs of his ravishing were still plain to see if one knew where to look. But they would be long gone once they left this room.
He reached for it again and doubled over with a cry of pain. He felt something warm trickle down his nose but grit his teeth and grabbed the railing. Kreacher was in the kitchen, several pots and pans laid out. Harry didn’t know if he was cleaning – there were no ingredients laid out – and he didn’t really care.
Panic came first, a desperate crawling sense of never being able to make his way back. He rationalised that away but it only left more room for recollections of his fight with Harry. He would get back, if only to apologise. That had been the purpose of coming clean after all, not just to clear his name but to apologise. If Harry still didn’t want to see him…
, they said. But Draco knew it would be hard in the ways that mattered, more so now that he’d met Harry.
Draco’s voice was heavy with exhaustion when he spoke but there was no mistaking his words. “I know… I know I’ve upset you... but will you please…”
Harry resisted the urge to cross his arms. That would make him look stupid. Neither Draco nor Alphard seemed to have a problem with him being shirtless. He had no problem either aside from being the only being half undressed.
Harry could no longer see them but he could picture Ron fuming and Hermione’s indignant stare. No, he needed to keep going, Hermione knew where he was going, she would catch up.
Lavender looked about to say something when the sound of chairs scraping against the floor filled the common room as Ron stood up and moved to the table where he and Harry had been attempting to get some study done only an hour ago at Hermione's behest. Dean bid the group goodnight before he climbed up the stairs to the dormitory while Seamus moved to the table nearest the fire to gather his books as well. The game was clearly over.
“Every Malfoy in this house and anyone they ever brought down here to get off with. Alphard too and perhaps Druella though she would never admit it.”
“Well, guess what?” Draco took a step closer, shortening the distance between them. “I do. You have a lot to answer for.”
The sound of galloping was now getting nearer and Draco was certain the dark figures he saw rushing through the forest were not mere figments of his imagination.
"I am not voyeuristic," said Harry crossing his arms even though a part of him had enjoyed watching Malfoy undress.
He slipped underneath the covers and barely registered the hand that brushed through his hair before he fell asleep.
Parkinson stared at his outstretched hand for long enough that Harry considered withdrawing it. He didn’t know why he played at civility with them. For Draco’s sake mostly but he didn’t care much for them, he doubted he ever would. She shook his head in the end and her lips quirked though her eyes remained steely. Harry supposed it was the most he would get from her.
Ron made as if to reach for Hermione's hand under the table but withdrew at the last moment and scratched his head. Hermione appeared conflicted as to whether or not she had noticed the action. Harry took it as his cue to leave, he was sure his friends had a few ideas on how they wanted to spend their Hogsmeade trip, he had noticed the burgeoning attraction between them since the Yule Ball and he wanted them to deal with it at their own pace.
Potter looked worse beside him. His wheezing would only worsen if he didn’t stop. But he flew like he did everything else. With the kind of relentless bravado you would expect from a Gryffindor.
Malfoy stared back as though this should be obvious to Harry by now. It wasn’t. And even if it should be, with the confusion clouding his mind at present Harry could hardly think straight.
Draco set a jar of flour and smaller jars of nuts, raisins, sugar and other white powders on the counter.
Harry told himself not to. Told himself that this could end badly. He pushed himself against Malfoy anyway. Desire swarmed in him dwarfing the rational part of his mind. He couldn’t have cared less about it.
"Think about it. Think about what Dumbledore said. We need to do something about this and ignoring it is clearly not the way to go about it."
“You’re still afraid, I can smell it.” Draco laughed. He couldn’t smell emotions but he knew Warrington would believe anything at this point. “Come back when you’re man enough and stop wasting my time.”
"She said to meet her on the Quidditch Pitch," the boy continued. "It's the headmaster sir... he's dying."
Draco only laughed. After a moment he said, “You’re not too bothered about what my father said, are you?”
This time the words were Draco’s and their presence felt stark against the murkiness of his thoughts.
The words came from a tall blonde man in sleek dark robes and a cigarette between his teeth. He resembled the Malfoys in build and appearance but his features were softer. There was the familiar wiriness Draco possessed but with more muscle on his frame.
Draco glared at him. He hated it when they asked questions because his mind would give the real answer – which he'd try very hard to ignore – whilst his lips fabricated some revolting lie. He couldn't help but feel they deserved more – better – than him. His lies. Merlin, he hated not feeling enough. He hated not knowing how to deal with feeling like he was worth no more than the dirt beneath their shoes.
Draco waited for Harry to look at him, aware of the seconds that ticked by. He needed to deal with this quickly, mother wouldn’t give them any more time. But he didn’t want to rush it. That would only make matters worse.
Harry nodded and they went back to the table. There was a torture to waiting and Draco would not endure it. In all honesty, Harry didn’t feel in the mood to either.
His fingers tightened against the stone railing, he didn’t know when he’d crossed the corridor but he forced himself to
Sharp claws raked through his skin and Draco screamed – a piercing feral cry that emanated from a place he’d never known existed in him. Pain seared white-hot beneath his skin, his arms thrashed wildly of their own accord dropping the wand he’d fought to acquire.
He walked to the car in no apparent rush but still keeping an eye on his surroundings. When he got to the car, the man opened the door for him but said nothing. A breeze tickled stray strands of his hair. Harry wondered if he was freezing underneath that suit.
His eyes roamed the rest of the room. A massive four-poster bed. High ceiling windows above a window seat. An ajar closet door and crammed bookshelf. Draco, he decided, had been misguided in preparing him for the mess that he would find. The first thing that had struck Harry was not the mess, it would never be.
He realised now that he was being stupid. Drakard was a professional and he worked for the Malfoys. No doubt he’d been sworn to secrecy regarding Draco’s sexuality long ago. He’d assumed the man would have a problem with it. He didn’t seem to, unless it interfered with his work. They likely paid him well enough to turn a blind eye otherwise.
Blaise opened his mouth to say something more but Draco left before he could. He probably pitied him for that faux pas and Draco had never felt so stupid in his life. He descended the stairs to Snape's classroom where he knew he would find the ex-Potions master.
Harry had come down early for breakfast and chosen the spot next to Hermione – not so he could glance inconspicuously at the Slytherin table every now and then because that was preposterous. This turned out to be something which Ron – despite ignoring Hermione for three weeks now – was not pleased with.
He answered the questions all the same. Yes, he and Harry had slept together since leaving the manor. Enough times for it not to be your business, Severus. No, they did not sleep with people other than each other.
Or rather, he had seemed to lucid for his mind to handle, an effect not dissimilar to the exam stimulants peddled to fourth years for their O.W.Ls. Yes, that was it, which meant he would have to assume that Nott had acquired this information and that it hadn’t been planted in his mind.
They had both survived and for the same reason he felt tears prickle at the corners of his eyes. Survival was not a pretty thing and it was not without its scars.
Draco stared at them with a vague sense of surprise. Had he made so many? He could only remember making two... Before he could contemplate it further, he was being led out of the toilet and back to the dormitory.
Nott sat in a bed near the corner and he watched them as they approached. Something in his face seemed to change when he saw Harry. Did he know something about where Draco was? Ginny went to his side and collapsed on a stool.
Malfoy didn’t respond for a while but Harry saw the crease in his brow and knew there was an answer there. He only had to get it. “It was nothing.”
That must have satisfied him because his eyes began to close seconds later. Draco patted his hair for a few more moments until his breathing slowed. Then he lifted himself off the bed and made his way to the toilet. He made quick work of relieving himself and was soon back in the warmth of the sheets.
The tightening in his chest only grew when students began to pour out of the Great Hall. He knew he had to move or McGonagall would have his head, quidditch match or no. So hefted his bag on his shoulder and made his way to class.
Cursing the pain in his side and how slowly he would heal on an empty stomach, Draco trudged after him.
Harry’s eyes flicked back to Draco’s. He’d taken his hand so many weeks ago when all this had been new and his hatred for Draco had been the only thing he clung to, the weapon he used to guard against his desires. It had been a truce then, a way to get by.
He walked past a gaggle of fourth years that looked like they were getting ready to prank people coming out of the Great Hall and followed at a discreet distance – several paces – behind Malfoy so that even if Malfoy turned Harry would look like he was just coincidentally going in the same direction.
Harry kept his eyes on Draco as he took off his belt and slid the trousers down his legs. Only when he stood naked except for his boxer briefs did Draco close the distance between them.
Harry glanced at him in the pale moonlight and couldn’t help the feeling that arose deep within him. He would do anything to keep Draco safe. He would do anything he could to make his life more bearable.
Draco’s eyes searched his, and though Harry was unable to tell what he was feeling without the bond, the thought of reaching for it again made him shiver.
Draco watched him move and Harry had a feeling he didn’t know he was doing it. Harry palmed his crotch and that earned him a groan. He shivered and stepped in closer, working his hand faster. Draco threw his head back with a moan and Harry licked and sucked his skin without thinking.
On the night before the match – after Harry had gotten Draco to agree to bottoming – he listened to him rattle off Ravenclaw’s strengths and weaknesses for the third time. It was the last thing he wanted to listen to but it was something Draco liked to do. He might even have made a good captain if he didn’t resent the position so much.
He reached for his quill and some parchment and penned a quick note. After that, it was not long before he sank into a fitful sleep.
Draco leaned into the touch against his better judgement. He could feel Potter staring at him. The next time their lips met, Draco thought he would collapse from the tenderness.
Malfoy's glare remained. Clearly he had expected Harry to rise to his words. Instead, he gave a nod. "We need to work out some ground rules."
The lesson had ended five minutes ago and Snape had made a great show of gathering the pieces of parchment bearing the essays he had assigned until he was sure everyone was out of the class.
“Muggles are very curious people. They have people over here doing restorations every other week. We can’t sell or change anything without informing them. It’s all very tedious business. I once broke a sixteenth-century vase just to see what they would do.”
Harry tried to clean away the splotches of tea that had landed on his clothes. “What?” he said again.
The Malfoys wouldn’t take his Hogwarts medical records. They probably wouldn’t be allowed to if they wanted to. Did other hospitals count or just St Mungo's?
Harry spun round to meet his gaze. “Of course I know the answer but that doesn’t mean I don’t want to hear.”
“Well,” Armand said loud enough for everyone to hear, “it appears he’s met a boy, though whether he’s nice or not...” Draco shot him a murderous look. Armand chuckled. “We’ll have to ascertain via alternative methods. Draco
He worked the buttons of his shirt down to the last one then reached for the cuffs at his wrist. He slid those into the pocket of his trousers and took off the shirt. His gaze flicked to Draco who still stood three feet away watching, his eyes were the only thing that gave away how much this aroused him. Well, his eyes and his cock.
It was not easy work partnering up with Malfoy and it was even harder ignoring him for he took it upon himself every time he could to say things such as "Really, Potter, can't you even stir properly?" or "Minced not diced, you blockhead" loud enough for everyone to hear.
“You know what you did,” he said glad for the momentary look of disorientation that crossed his face.
That seemed to be the only answer he needed. He stepped away and said, “I apologise for my actions.”
Harry circled the air for a fifth time before coming to a stop. Conditions were nothing like they had been in the friendly but he still hadn’t spotted the snitch. Malfoy hovered a few metres from him. His keen gaze followed the match more than a seeker should.
There was no discernible trace of emotion in his eyes and Harry wondered how much he truly felt, how much it hurt if it hurt at all. He started to tap into the bond on instinct but Draco shook his head so he relented.
What would Snape do anyway? After six years, Harry knew he’d seen the worst of it and if it wouldn’t land him in the infirmary or take away quidditch then he could endure it.
He rose and made his way to the study on the first floor. Harry watched Severus as though expecting him to follow but Severus avoided his gaze. Draco felt a spike of anger through the bond.
So, The Dark Lord had suggested the reinstatement of the Masque but would be unable to attend. Draco had warned them as much. They would need to keep up appearances. But at the time, Voldemort had taken up residence in the Manor indefinitely. He could understand why the idea of planning a Christmas Masque had been far from their minds.
"How have your studies been going, Harry?" the headmaster asked leaning forward on the desk bright blue eyes watching him astutely from behind his half-moon glasses.
Malfoy crossed his arms over his chest and looked at the shutters. "I had some urgent matters to discuss with Madam Pomfrey."
Harry was about to leave the question unanswered but if Draco had finished his meeting with Dumbledore then that would only draw him here.
“Aha,” Neville said moving to the edge of his bed. Harry was shocked to realise his eyes were on him and probably had been for some time from the look of it. “Who is it?”
Harry wrapped his arms around him and held him throughout the night. He prayed he knew what the hell he was doing.
He forced himself to break away from his mother. "Father," he said by way of greeting. The man regarded him with a cool gaze his expression betraying nothing.
"Is that so or are you just scared?" taunted Malfoy. His smile widened. "Maybe," he continued, "maybe I should just attack you when your back is turned, like a coward."
Draco knew he had shown his hand and there was no way to go back from it. His affection for Harry would be a currency Severus could trade with very little to stop him. Draco squared his jaw and forced himself to step back.
Harry didn’t know what he’d been expecting but certainly not for Draco to fuck him into the mattress, or for it to feel like the first time. And not for it to feel like something he’d been missing for far too long.
Draco told the story in sections, some Harry heard for the first time and others he left out. Harry suspected he wasn’t as unbothered by his transformations as he let on. He’d been growing accustomed to it but sometimes Harry caught the anger in his eyes and forced himself to stand his ground.
Ron retreated behind his bed hangings with a loud sigh and Harry felt he was able to breathe once more.
Though some of the Order members had stayed past supper, none every came after that – it was an unspoken rule of sorts, one that he and Draco needed if they were to have some semblance of privacy. Snape’s presence was more than irregular, it was calculated.
“I wasn’t sure how you like your sandwiches. I had Lino use the most common sandwich filling and spread.”
“Draco.” He pulled him close and hot tears mingled with the filth in Draco’s hair as he shook violently.
“It’s the memories that matter, Harry. We would be nothing if we could not remember. Memories are all we cling to and they are often all that remain when we can no longer hold on.”
Maybe all this was just a bad dream, maybe he would wake up in the morning and it would all have disappeared.
Draco rose at dawn as was his wont. Harry lay tangled in the sheets, in the thick of some dream, Draco guessed from the fisted bed covers in his hands.
He surveyed the length of Draco’s torso, visible from his half-unbuttoned shirt. He let himself bask in the waves of heat radiating off Draco. The want and the need that filled the space between them.
It had been tradition for them, even though they hadn’t accepted that Draco preferred men. It was something different to him and he struggled for words to show just how different it was.
Harry's gaze landed on a dark-haired boy who was leaning over... another boy. The boy beneath him had cherry hair striking enough in Hogwarts to catch Harry's attention. The two were kissing passionately, their bodies moving to a rhythm unknown to him. He was shocked that they were doing it so openly. Hadn't Ron told him homosexuality was taboo in the wizarding world? Or maybe they didn't care.
The days flew by like Quidditch players on their brooms and as the Friday before his shift approached, Draco Malfoy found himself increasingly missing classes, skipping meals and sleeping less. The latter may have been normal to the point that his body had become accustomed to it but some part of him knew he would need energy for the shift.
Harry grasped his arm. Draco could have shaken off the grip, instead, he tried not to seem impatient when he turned again.
She sat alone her silver and green robes stark against the hazy warmth of the afternoon sun. A quill rested between her fingers and a book on her laps. Several more were spread around her along with her emerald book bag.
She found him alone on the grounds one afternoon. It was a warm day for early spring but Harry was enjoying the sun and the occasional but quiet gurgling of the Black Lake. It was lunchtime and he knew that no one would bother him here for a while. Indeed, the grounds were empty of students as far as he could see.
He didn't dare let his thoughts wander on the matter. For all he knew it could be from a girl who was interested in him and not a certain blond whose winks made him flustered for no reason.
He'd entirely excluded most of the undesirable side effects like steaming ears and the eventual drowsiness that ensured the restorative ingredients in the potion could work properly.
McNair bent to his level, his leg still too weak to kneel or crouch. Would it heal if they got into another scuffle? Draco doubted it, he looked to be in a great deal of pain all things considered.
“And you are aware of which members of the family shall be visiting tomorrow? Who will be in attendance at the Masque?”
Harry scanned his mind for anything he could have seen on Wound-Cleaning potions. Even in if it had been in passing. He couldn’t recall anything. “I’m going to fail this assessment,” he muttered moving towards the work station.
Harry nudged his broom around the pitch one more time aware of Haneul not far behind. Halfway through the lap, he came to a halt and Harry turned to see why. The bludger rammed past his chest, the angle of his body the only thing preventing it from shattering his left shoulder.
. Somehow, the word sounded derogatory coming from Ron's mouth, as though he truly despised it and the people it described. Did he mean for it to sound that way? He realised now that he didn't really know Ron's opinion on sexuality and he was surprised it had never come up in the six years they had known each other.
Malfoy yanked his hand out of Harry's grip. "What?" It was not unkind but neither was it inviting. It was as if the Slytherin had lost the energy to continue fighting but couldn't exactly put up with him either.
Harry had already made his decision and when he took Draco in his mouth, he knew it was the right one. It seemed like an age since Harry had felt his body go rigid and then soften in his. He pulled away and licked the head as Draco had his. He swirled his tongue around it and sucked lightly.
Draco whispered, “Bow,” and Harry did, feeling awkward. Draco had done it numerous times now that he thought on it but it didn’t feel any less odd to him.
“It appears so,” he said glancing once at Harry. “Now what’s all this talk of full moons? I must hear it for myself.”
He was confident Pomfrey would discharge him by then. His shoulder injury hadn’t been bad, just painful. The bones would be mended by morning and Harry would be with him soon. He let the thought soothe him as he leaned against the wall.
Malfoy made a frustrated gesture. He threw his head back as though calling on some force of nature. The tone and volume of his voice bellied anguish beyond Harry’s understanding. Then he pulled his hand back and hurled Harry’s broom at him.
“I will not be bullied in Hogwarts and outside of it by professors who hate me for no other reason than my parent’s mistakes.”
"Draco," Pansy said motioning for him though she was sitting at the same place they always did and he was perfectly capable of locating it without assistance.
The Defence master eyed Draco for a moment before he stepped aside to let him pass. "That's Professor Snape to you," he said as he shut the door.
Harry had concluded fast enough that this was an Alphard-Draco thing. His current question was why this family felt the need to glorify five-minute meetings. Why couldn’t they just have conversations and be done with them?
Harry dodged another bludger and let out a curse as he soared higher to search for the snitch. They knew the drill, it was textbook gameplay. Keep all bludgers away from the cashers and the seeker. The crowd was on its feet now, louder than ever. An hour in and this was not turning into the swift victory anyone had anticipated.
Stone was getting on his nerves now. Draco didn’t want to have to suffer another second of his infuriating presence.
"As your godfather, I did take the initiative to assist in raising you properly. But I cannot ever recall agreeing to house calls at ungodly hours of the morning," he said surveying Draco with an unreadable expression.
He did not deign to respond to the statement but trusted Draco to follow behind him once he locked his office. It was dark when they left the office, almost eight o’clock. There was no one about as they made their way through one of the lesser traversed routes of the castle.
Harry remembered that wizard's duels were dangerous affairs and coupled with the fact that Malfoy probably knew more Dark Magic than he did, Harry knew he had to find a way to end this before things got out of hand.
"It doesn't matter," she said trying to avoid another argument between them. "Where did you disappear to anyway?"
His heart began to race and his instinct screamed for him to pull away. Draco held him fast, as though he could sense this. Harry’s mouth opened in a silent cry as teeth punctured his skin deeper and deeper…
what deepen our love for people. We turn them over and over in hour heads and smile, cry, laugh, learn. We feel and we learn to hold tighter and let go and remember.”
Harry should have listened to his body when he had the chance but that was in the past now and he was trying to forget. He only wished the rest of Hogwarts would shut up about it. The Gryffindors especially. He had never known them to be so... critical.
The letters… ink stains and cramped fingers… He’d been too wrapped up in his own world to realise it.
He'd been feeling restless towards Malfoy ever since the events in the Astronomy Tower and he wasn't sure meeting up with him regularly would make things better.
The innocence of the action drove Draco mad with need. That Potter could switch between the two in such a short amount of time aroused him. And the sight of him with his head bowed and his hair grazing the tips of Draco’s skin…
He was very aware of Malfoy beside him. He met Harry’s pace with ease though he knew they both concealed much.
“Her mother was always intent on a Malfoy alliance, you’d think we were fighting a war. Anyway, both Armand and I were too old and my parents already didn’t like Edward much. She settled instead for a relative of sorts, one with a distant connection. Heaven knows where she dug him up from but I can’t tell you how much she talked about our damned ancestry.”
Harry tilted his head back barely aware of Draco’s tight grip in his hair. He did nothing more than suck and lick at the spot though. No matter how much Harry pleaded.
He nudged Harry thighs apart and Harry spread them as far as he could. Draco coated his own cock in the lubricant. Harry watched breathing heavy, cock twitching in anticipation. Draco flashed him a grin and Harry watched him approach with bated breath.
Harry swatted his arm away and moved back to the desk where he picked up a quill and a square of parchment. He dipped his quill in the inkwell then scrolled something on the parchment. Harry watched him until he looked up with a sly smile and went back to writing.
He can’t blame them for that. He’s less likely to tell them about his troubles than he is to go to Snape with them these days.
Harry looked up in alarm. His mind had still been on Lucius Malfoy but Armand was looking at a different Malfoy when he spoke. Harry wondered if he knew Draco would hear them no matter how low they spoke.
He couldn't help but feel like there was something he didn't know. There was tension between him and Blaise for some reason. Of course there had always been tension between him and Blaise but it had never been like this. Usually it was an undercurrent, something both of them could sometimes poke at with few serious consequences.
Blaise's arms gripped his shoulders and moved his body so that Draco was sitting parallel to the toilet itself. Draco grinned as he leaned back, he could still feel it in his veins. His blood was singing, had he ever felt more alive than in this moment?
Harry panicked and did the one thing you were never supposed to do at a quidditch match. He stretched out his hand and opened his mouth to say the
"What?" Harry forced himself to say but it came out too fast and sounded fake so he forced himself to slow down, take a deep breath. "Why?"
At that, Hermione turned in her seat and said to Ron, "Ginny's not a child. She can take care of herself."
Harry and Draco set their shopping bags down. Lupin glanced at them but his expression didn’t change.
Zabini had been touchier than Harry would have liked. And if it hadn't been for the stupid drink Harry would have hit him. But whatever alcohol had been in the drink turned him into a thrill-seeking monster. It shamed him to admit all he’d wanted to do was move his body. He’d forgotten about everything else.
Severus loathed that Draco referred to him by his first name. It was common for Malfoys to refer to all adults in the family by their first name save for their parents. The need to refer to one’s elders by their family name was a sign of subjugation and fear, according to his father.
Draco clamped his mouth shut on his next question. Considering his aim had been to either get Nott to reveal information or snap and accidentally reveal information, all he could do now was wait.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t know, give me a tour, I suppose. I need to tell Alphard what a hell hole this place is in my next letter.”
Harry opened his mouth to say something but the look in Draco’s eyes stopped him. He knew why he was doing this. It was the same reason Harry had done what he did, he would die before he saw Draco like that again.
“Sparing you some serious trouble,” he said looking back in the direction they had come from. Narcissa’s voice wafted from beyond the corridor, Draco’s rising to meet it. “But if you would rather return to the fire…”
"I hope you are aware that you may speak to me, Draco," he said almost silently, in a rare moment of kindness. "In confidence. You can tell me anything."
Draco's blood froze in his veins when he heard a loud howl. His face was upturned in an instant. His gaze combed the cloudy sky for the moon which up until then had been lighting his path but had gone – for the most part – unnoticed.
His thoughts grew more muddled and even when he tried to pinch himself awake, he felt the dark close around him. The poison was slowing his thoughts and turning them to slush so he could not pick out Harry’s face from them.
"Myself, I prefer to count to ten in all the languages I know," he said as though disclosing a secret.
He wasn’t but he wouldn’t argue the point if Draco asked again, he wouldn’t win and all Harry wanted to do was rest. His limbs ached and his head felt like he’d used one too many bath potions.
Harry watched still, trying to keep his face neutral. The old man cleared his throat and tucked the embroidered handkerchief away.
He had only just escaped an inquisition at the manor and he had no intention of getting into his private life with Blaise at the moment.
Draco inclined his head in thanks and climbed the steps to the boys' dormitory fiddling with his collar the entire way. He threw open the door to find Blaise reclining on his bed with a piece of parchment and a pot of ink hovering on either side of him.
"That night of the party. I didn't see you after that time on the dance floor," she said shifting her gaze from the fire and looking at him.
Malfoy gave a guarded smile. “I received correspondence from my mother. She intimated that she would prefer that we carry on with certain Christmas traditions-”
"Shift..." he mumbled wrenching the shirt off his arms. He could feel Blaise's cool fingers peeling the material away from his skin and it soothed him a little. "Need..."
Ron wasn’t having as much luck with Zabini at the other end of the room. He was doing the writing. Zabini had taken to pointing out errors in the work every few seconds. Ron, it seemed, had not tired of looking up and glaring at him every few seconds. The others didn’t seem to be having too many problems. Though Harry did notice that Dean periodically met Seamus’ gaze from across the classroom.
The prospect of the shift occupied his mind much more than anything could. So much so that he didn't notice Pansy was speaking to him.
"Just because you got a perfect grade last time, Potter, doesn't mean you have to botch it for the rest of us."
The thought that he’d almost lost this still haunted him – enough that he could never be away from Harry for too long without serious anxiety. They were both working on it – on what would happen when they had to leave Number Twelve.
Harry’s sleepy eyes found his, then glanced around the room for a moment before coming back to Draco who tried for a smile. Harry returned the gesture a moment later and Draco forced himself to restrain the relief flooding through him.
"Oh, hey Harry," Ginny said coming through the portrait hole looking flushed. From the look of things, she hadn't been expecting to see anyone as she had greeted him with a startled gasp.
He resurfaced to take a deep breath of air before going as deep as he dared. His fingers closed around a blue plant. Its leaves slipped through his fingers as though it was covered in slime. Its blue venation cast an eerie light around it. Draco leaned closer to examine it wishing he could sniff it. Something floated past his ear and sunk to the depths below before he could make out exactly what it was.
Malfoy glared at him. "You may as well just read about it yourself. I'm sure Dumbledore won't deny his precious puppet anything."
How had Malfoy been allowed to stay in Hogwarts? Dumbledore obviously wouldn't kick him out but his father seemed like the sort to pull him out. He’d all but gotten Lupin fired after all.
How was he supposed to know what he felt when he couldn’t rein in his own emotions for ten minutes? It was so easy to think of things as like and dislike when there was a spectrum of emotions between those two and an even bigger spectrum between dislike and hatred.
This time it was bubbling on the surface, begging to break free. Draco tried to think back, tried to recall whether anything had happened. He remembered everything until how he got to the toilet last night. Everything else was a blur. There were snatches of memory here and there but nothing enough to satisfy his curiosity. Now that he thought about it, he wasn't sure how he ended up in his bed. He didn't think he could have gone back by himself. Had someone found him?
Even on his worse days, he seemed to radiate something, anger, irritation, impatience but this… there was nothing beneath his wan skin. Nothing beyond fatigue and sorrow and pain from the bond.
"What were you doing here?" insisted Harry because he was running out of time but the curiosity was eating him alive.
It should have hurt to say the words, to admit that he was wrong, but it felt like a burden was lifted off his shoulders. Maybe if he’d been less rash in the first place none of this would have happened.
Draco’s grip on his hands softened and Harry bridged the distance between them and pulled him into a hug.
Draco slammed his hands down on the table before he could stop himself. It left his palms stinging and forced him to grit out his next words.
It wasn’t as easy as he imagined even though the wood was old but after two tries and Haneul’s help, it gave.
Well then, should they leave him no choice, he would not hesitate to hex them to the seventh circle.
Lucius and Narcissa arrived a few minutes to nine o’clock and it wasn’t long before Lino appeared outside the door to summon them for supper. Harry and Draco descended the stairs hand in hand, Draco’s grip bruising.
“First of all, shut up.” Draco was so alarmed that he did just that. “Second, I’m not leaving here without you, get comfortable with that idea.”
Malfoy had clearly been under influence at the time. He hadn't known what he was saying or meant it. He had not been his right mind.
“Nothing can be done to reverse this Minerva, Severus. Lycanthropy is incurable as I am sure you’re both well aware."
He didn’t know what he was saying in truth. But a part of him didn’t want to believe Ron was capable of so much hatred over something so… mundane. He’d heard the words for himself and here he was still making a case for the best friend he’d known for 6 years.
Harry watched Draco for cues but he only heaved a long-suffering sigh and flung himself into the couch opposite parents. He stretched out his legs and waited.
Ron had sniggered, about to say something about this but the Divination professor had fixed him with a firm glare and he had kept silent.
Harry offered his arm to Drakard who had selected a syringe from the impressive array he carried in his leather case. The needle itself was thinker than anything Harry had ever seen and he watched it in trepidation.
Harry nodded. He’d never learned how to accept apologies from Draco and this was only the second he’d ever received.
He still doubted he would live here after school, doubted Draco would still want to either but it had felt good to show him a part of his life, distant as it was. The thoughts drifted as he sunk deeper into sleep.
He wandered to the kitchen and poured himself a glass of water. He hadn’t done much cooking in here but Draco had prepared small meals on his more difficult days. Harry had barely been able to eat then but he found he missed the meals more and more now.
Harry’s fingers bunched around the clothes in his hands. The eyes on him felt almost accusatory but he didn’t know if it was all in his head.
. Though... I don't think I'll stop. Unless you think you can make me." There it was, he winked again and Harry was suddenly a cauldron full of emotions.
His fingers clutched the cool railing as a wave of vertigo crashed into him. For a moment it felt like his grip was the only keeping him upright. He could have sworn he felt droplets of rain and icy pinpricks on his body. He hurled himself away from the railing and stumbled back with a gasp.
She had bags beneath her eyes which had been hastily painted over with some spell and her eyes were dropping. Strands of dark hair had escaped her hastily made bun and she kept yawning every two seconds.
He didn't know what made him say it. He knew Snape did it because there was nothing else he felt he could do for his godson but Draco's mind felt fuzzy and he'd thought for a second saying whatever came to it would the relieve the pressure.
He wondered, for the hundredth time, whether Draco was done with Dumbledore. What did they have to discuss that was taking so long?
that suffused the room with a warm glow, not rosy like the one downstairs but dim enough the shadows seemed to dance around him.
The pleasure at having shocked Ron was short-lived because there was distrust underneath it and shock too. Harry forced himself to take a deep breath and got to his feet.
A quick trip to the bathroom revealed Draco hadn’t hidden his bath potions away since the last time so Harry got to work on drawing a bath. Even so, he hadn’t learnt how to combine the potions and struggled to take his time. He scrubbed until his skin was raw but drained the tub long before half an hour was up.
Harry frowned but Draco grasped his hand and dragged him out of the dining room before he could protest.
"Fine," he said. They would need to return to get their swimming things anyway. "I hope your swimming has gotten better. For your sake," he added darkly before sauntering into the great hall.
"As you well know, young Mr. Malfoy here had an unfortunate encounter in the Forbidden Forest about a fortnight ago with a werewolf," he paused to let the information sink in but it seemed his parents had had time to compose themselves earlier.
Harry watched from behind an ageing oak tree as the blond raised his face to the moon, lips pulled into a smirk that did not look human at all. His eyes fluttered shut against the white light. He began to sway, rocking back and forth on his feet, his hips moving to a rhythm only he knew. Harry couldn’t help a gasp. There was nothing inherently sensual about the movements but the fact that Malfoy had dropped his guard enough to do this. That he of all people was doing this seemed to make it seem…
Draco didn’t respond but as he tracked the footsteps up the to the door, he thought he felt a glimmer of something inside him.
Draco’s finger massaged his forearm before he knew what he was doing. It took meeting Harry’s gaze for him to pause but Harry didn’t want him to stop. Everything around them had gone silent. He bowed his head until he could feel the smooth silk of Draco’s shirt beneath his skin. He took a deep breath.
She extracted it with a triumphant smirk. Harry swore beneath his breath. Hermione’s face fell when she unfolded it and found nothing on either side.
He swallowed and his moment of hesitation cost him. A flash of light filled the night and Draco swore as he ducked beneath it. He wouldn’t outpace Lupin for long, and he didn’t. The third spell caught him straight in the chest.
When Draco didn’t say anything, Harry glanced at the bedside even though he knew he wouldn’t be able to see it.
be sex. He’d ignored the sex bit because that would only open up the mating conversation. He didn’t have time to think about that now.
A part of him was still there but it needed to return to the forefront. He wasn’t sure how it would help, would the bond strengthen him physically? Would it hurt?
It had all began about the same time news of their relationship entered into the public domain. Draco never revealed what was contained in the letters and Harry could think of a few reasons why.
A hush fell over the room and if Harry had needed any further convincing that this was more than he’d bargained for, this was it.
His eyes jumped to the one at the end of the row. He pulled it off the rack with a silent prayer that they'd let him wear it. If only so he'd get this over with.
“I give it fifteen minutes before we’re discovered,” he said looking at the clock above the mantel. “It would have been more if Lysandra hadn’t derailed us.”
It wasn’t something he could explain. Or something he wanted to think about long enough to be able to explain
"Whatever," Murray said pulling another pipe from underneath the table and filling Harry's cup to the brim with the rich dark liquid.
Draco’s grin couldn’t be contained when he slipped back into bed. It only made Harry scowl harder but there was relief beneath that too.
Malfoy’s eyes fluttered and he coughed water as he sat up. Harry shared a look with Ron and they turned to go. "Where do you think you're going?" demanded Zabini, wand still trained on their figures.
“I’m saying I want it.” He thought it would be enough but the words hovered between them, Draco’s expression a mixture of disbelief and shock. Harry forced himself to go on despite the silence. “I give you my permission… to mark me.”
Draco leaned down and brought their lips together, the sheer force of the action reverberated through Harry's bones. His hands reached for Draco’s hair on instinct as he worked his mouth with a calculated skill that left Harry struggling for breath. Harry’s fingers dug into his scalp when he abandoned his lips in favour of his neck. He licked and sucked and nipped and Harry groaned over and over.
He came away from the mirror and stepped into the room. “You handled mother better than I expected.”
Stone was thrown back four feet but Draco did not leave it at that. He stalked toward him ignoring the shouts of the other players. He had suffered this poor excuse of a captain long enough. That he had the nerve to dare speak about his father... oh, it was a big mistake on his part.
But even before he saw the expression on Dean’s face, even before he shook his head, Harry knew it wasn’t true and a part of him wanted to turn around and leave. Nobody would stop him and what was the point anyway?
He took another bite of the apple and this time from Draco’s expression, he was sure he felt his arousal through the bond.
“You need to get over Draco, whatever you had is over. I don’t know whose fault it was but it’s over.” She turned to Draco. “You need to stop –” counting on her fingers “– keeping secrets and/or rubbing the fact that you and Potter are… involved in Blaise’s face. He’s still pining.”
His eyes moved from Lavender – who had something akin to a triumphant smile on her face – to Parvati – who was determinedly looking away and settled on Ginny.
“Harry Potter, meet Cygnus Black III of The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black and Druella Rosier Black of –”
A moment later she gathered her things and left the Great Hall. Harry tried to eat some more but couldn’t manage it and it wasn’t long before he too was gathering his things and leaving.
The first thing Harry noticed was the numerous dark welts on his skin. The sight of them made him pause at the doorway. Red and purple and green not to mention the layer of grime on his skin and the scent of sweat and blood in the air. His head was bowed and his breathing shallow.
“I do, alright? I do and I might not understand it as well as you do but I can’t…” He struggled to find words. “What kind of person lets the man they love ruin themselves like this?”
Draco had been only thirteen. Nott a few months older. Amidst the presence of dementors and hunt for Black, receiving advances from a dorm-mate had been the last thing on his mind. But that was not what shocked him most. No, he had been ill-prepared to feel as horrible as he did for turning Nott down.
He would not turn down Blaise’s aid even so. That would only land both he and Blaise in trouble with Pansy. And the lie would have been a waste. Better to indebt himself to Blaise now and hope to distract him when he came to collect.
It wasn't particularly creative but Harry was still stunned from the encounter. He could only watch as one by one the Slytherin team filed to the showers with linger glares. Only a blond seeker behind.
The fire roared behind them and Harry couldn’t help a yawn. Hermione had long since retired to the girls’ dormitories. Harry wished more than ever that Ron would abstain from asking questions like he usually did. It made things easier not to have to endure interrogation from both of them.
The thought that Potter had ventured into the pleasures of the flesh made Draco wonder just what Potter could do. Did he prefer the dominant position like he had in Draco’s dream? Or had that been his own fantasy? Draco preferred to top and he licked his lips unknowingly as Potter’s words from last night came back to him.
It wasn’t the pull but there was something about his voice without it that already made it hard to resist.
Harry was thankful because the darkness and whatever demon had possessed Draco convinced him to keep his eyes shut. He didn’t think his face could grow any warmer.
Harry was about to continue down this line of thought when Draco came to a stop before a large, unadorned door. He turned to Harry who thought he stopped a trace of nervousness in his expression.
Draco rolled his eyes and disappeared out of Harry’s line of sight. Harry hesitated at the doorway. He wanted to enter the room, he could already feel Draco’s presence from here. An urge to look around filled him at once and he took a step then another and another.
Draco looked up from arranging the stationery on the desk with a frown. He liked to take books with him everywhere he went and there was nothing he loved to do more than write in books, something Hermione would find appalling.
Harry’s breath caught. He knew this was a result of a week’s worth of forced abstinence and that Draco would not go easy on him and he didn’t want him to either. He’d missed this and he could already feel his cock stirring.
His voice was dangerously low when he said, “You really want me to fuck you here and now, don’t you?”
And Draco knew at once Harry reached into the bond where he’d been afraid to do so. He'd seen Draco's fears for what they were, seen him prepare to leave and still he asked him to stay.
Narcissa Malfoy clapped her hands twice. She was seated in an armchair in the Malfoy Manor drawing room dressed in elaborate lavender robes that brought out her deep brown eyes. Her pale blond hair was drawn back into an elegant bun and her face bore the faintest hint of carefully applied spell work.
"The sun," he said, "which stands for prison." He left out the part that said poverty because he didn't think Ron needed to be reminded of that. "I reckon someone's got it in their clutches."
Draco’s tightened his grip for one long moment but before Harry could even think to yank him off Ron, he stepped back. Ron doubled over coughing, tears in his eyes. His face was nearly as red as his hair and he shot Harry a murderous look.
McNair’s jaw was mended but he still couldn’t speak right. Draco willed it to bring him some measure of satisfaction, the same edge it had given him when it had taken three of them to hold him down, but there was nothing.
Even in the low light of the room, Malfoy's livid expression was plain as day and the fire in his eyes was something that Harry thought Zabini shouldn't be fuelling so whimsically.
Harry insisted on repairing the house while they were there and Draco had spent a week or so watching him take things apart and paint surfaces before he was ready to help. He let Harry do most of the work when he noticed that it brought him comfort, he seemed to like… fixing things. There was no better way to put it.
Harry waited long enough that he contemplated calling out again, this time with a shove for good measure when Draco turned to face him.
Draco glanced at him as though this was the least of their worries at the moment but answered anyway.
It took most of the day to brew the potion which thankfully occupied his time and thoughts leaving room for nothing else. When he stopped, it was only to creep back to the Slytherin dungeons where he devested himself and climbed into bed, his roommates none the wiser.
Dumbledore strode into the room from the teacher's entrance and the entire school seemed to release a sigh of relief. Harry resumed breathing, his fists unclenched beneath the table.
Draco shot him a look. “Of course not. I was trying to steal a book and you just happened to grab my attention for the past two hours.”
His voice didn't waver some vital wall of restraint in Draco broke. Harry saw it in the way the look in his eyes softened. He moved closer to Draco and smoothed back his tousled hair.
In any case, Harry didn’t need a reason to touch him but he didn’t look like he knew that yet. The back and forth made things more difficult. They were different people at Hogwarts but Draco was a different person here too.
What about him what? The threat of Voldemort had ceased taking precedence in his mind after he met Harry. He hadn't made any attempts to fix the Vanishing cabinet since he got back or thought about his other task. Where hatred and fear had once driven him to them, other emotions drew him back, more powerful than anything he’d ever felt.
Her concern only grew but he apologised again and promised to explain what was going on when he got back. Only this last statement convinced her to let him go and Harry dashed out of the shop before she could call him back.
There was a rustling sound behind him and he turned to see Draco slide into bed. His torso was unclothed but Harry didn’t know if the rest of him was naked.
But it wasn't someone else, Harry couldn’t imagine it being someone else and if Ron wouldn’t accept it then things would have to change. And with those thoughts, he drifted off to sleep.
McNair glanced at Blaise who nodded for him to step aside. Draco held his breath, unable to believe they would give up so fast. His heart began to sink when Blaise handed McNair his wand and took the cup from his hands.
They were in public most of the time. Merlin forbid the student body perceived anything resembling ‘neutrality’ between them. No one would ever stop talking. People talking about him was the last thing Harry wanted at the moment.
“And so, Mr Potter, when my son eventually succumbs to his unnatural desires, you will be there. I am aware of the kind of man you are, after all. I am, however, going to tell you that you can be there. Don’t look so alarmed, there’s a caveat. That’s better. Under no circumstances are you to dissuade my son from doing his duty.
“Earlier this morning Draco received messages from Pansy, Blaise, Nott and his family.” Hermione frowned at the interruption but he went on. “The ones from his family and Nott were regular but Pansy hadn’t spoken to him in a while and he fell out with Blaise after my last match.”
Was this going to become a daily occurrence? Malfoy had said unbonded mates felt the need to... touch each other. Was staring part of that too? Would Harry's head be so full of thoughts of Malfoy that he forgot everything else?
“Severus has informed me of your… efforts but rest assured you are not the only one playing this game.”
Harry watched them play for another half hour before he signalled for the team to land and gave them his observations. Fly higher and faster, he told them. Dodge better and pay more attention. When he asked Ginny if she could take a more defensive stance she merely shrugged and looked away. "Sure," was all he got.
Draco grinned into the rough kiss and Harry was only dimly aware of the fact that they were in a corridor.
“You won’t let him have his victory. It’s brilliant but not your style, I expected something… flashier.”
Harry already knew how he flew, he’d known it ever since Draco qualified for seeker years ago. He’d known it each time they flew and outflew each other on the pitch. He knew it now because it was in every fibre of his being.
Draco swallowed. He knew what Dumbledore was doing and neither his impending death nor the fact that the war needed to end justified it but Draco knew what he had to do. He knew that – he’d always known it.
"You know how Hermione is," said Harry who had already changed and was lounging on his bed in flannel pyjamas.
Less than halfway down the corridor stood Blaise in immaculate robes and his hair carefully combed and parted as always. The expression on his face was bland but he had his wand in hand and that was enough.
He shifted and Draco’s eyes flew open as he slid off Harry’s body. “What are you– ?” Harry had him beneath him before he could say anymore.
When he climbed down the stairs, he was surprised to see her seated opposite Lupin at the table. Both had steaming mugs of tea before them and looked up when he came into the dining room. Harry’s attention was on something else.
"Oh they most certainly will," Harry thought he heard the portrait say but he wasn't sure because the minute he swung aside to let them in his ears were assaulted with the sound of pounding music.
He knew where this was going and didn’t like it. Confusion marred Draco’s face as he looked between him and Lupin.
Harry made his way to where Malfoy stood and made to take out his book but a cool hand clamped over his wrist. Harry’s heart stopped and he looked up in alarm.
Harry swore and he willed himself to continue towards the Great Hall but he couldn’t and he was turning around and making his way back to the table before Ron started speaking.
Harry started to point this out but Malfoy had already raised his wand. He muttered something to the rustic wooden door. It swung open and he stepped in as though he'd done this before. Harry followed and heard Malfoy shut the door behind him with a resounding clink.
What was Zabini's issue with him? He'd been the one to offer him that stupid drink of his. He'd been the one encouraging him to dance. He'd been the one touching him. Harry felt it difficult to let the matter rest, even in his mind.
Harry didn't know why he was so upset but all he could think was that Ginny had been in the wrong place and nearly knocked him off his broom. None of the other players seemed to have noticed their exchange so he brushed it aside.
Had Dumbledore lost his marbles? Did he not know how werewolves were viewed in society? "Merlin, how the hell is this good? Do you know who my parents are? What they stand for? Do you think they will accept me when they see what I have become, this thing I have changed into?"
Draco laughed and saw the beginnings of a smile on Harry’s face. He was about to say something when the kettle whistled behind them and Harry turned to take it off the stove. Draco straightened and retrieved two chipped mugs from a cupboard overhead.
Draco who prided himself in personal space dismissed it as the effects of the alcohol, he never hesitated to tell anyone in so many words that boundaries had been crossed.
Lino had reappeared. He set the plate of biscuits and tray of tea on the coffee table before bowing once more.
He could feel the hatred rolling off Draco in waves. When the coughing didn't stop, he shook his head. He muttered something about the private sitting room and Armand and strode out of the room.
She squeezed his arm. “I still love you, Harry and you don’t need to hide anything if you want to talk to me.”
The only solution was to use one to go back in time and prevent the event from taking place. She hadn’t mentioned what kind of vessel could harness the power required to slow downtime. Harry doubted she knew. Hermione was nothing if not eager to share knowledge.
Somehow, he and Blaise couldn’t sort through whatever it was that was ripping a hole in their friendship. It grated on his last nerve to have to return to this over and over again. Fighting with Blaise was something from which he drew no enjoyment.
He understood the words he was reading but his brain refused to absorb their meaning no matter how many times he reread the passage. He'd drawn the bed hangings around him and cast a small
He watched as Katie Bell swung her bat and nearly hit Demelza who was flying past with the Quaffle in her sights.
And he was panting, on all fours, but still somewhat upright. Harry waited, the taste of blood from where he’d bit his tongue heavy in his mouth.
"But to actually suggest he's any good?" Ron whispered when she went over to check on Seamus and Dean. "Harry, it's complete rubbish!" Harry knew Ron would never agree with him on the subject. Malfoy may have been a vile human being but he was an expert flyer.
Harry pushed him back in a movement so abrupt that he blinked in confusion for several seconds. Harry yanked off the scarf and undid two more buttons on his shirt.
Draco leaned across the scattered dishes on the table and examined the mark once more. Harry titled his head to the right, giving him access. When he was done, he rearranged the scarf and pressed a kiss to Harry’s lips.
Draco appeared in the doorway a moment later, rid of his robes, pullover and tie. He’d rolled up his sleeves and untucked his shirt. His hair was held back and he glanced from Harry to the stove.
Draco pulled back with a grin. Harry could see even now that he leashed his desire. He didn’t want that.
Harry noticed that much like Draco, Armand seemed to draw confidence from his granduncle’s presence. For reasons he couldn’t explain, it set him at ease. It felt good to know Draco had relatives he could be free with.
“A few smaller newspapers, more colourful in their description than this one,” Lupin said taking the clipping back before Harry could read more. “All recalled with relative ease.”
Harry began at Draco’s neck. He worked the muscles there one by one until he heard them pop and Draco groaned in satisfaction. He moved down Draco’s spine, taking his time to smooth out any tension as he did. Draco moaned and squirmed beneath him. Harry fought not to bend low and kiss him whenever his arse brushed against his crotch.
Harry thought about the liquids he’d poured into the bath. So many vivid reds and deep purples, greens like the grass on the Malfoy fields and browns like warm caramel and blacks like the Great Lake. Whether or not they were aphrodisiacs mattered little considering their current situation.
His eyes remained shut for a moment and Harry relished the opportunity to watch him come to. Relished the privilege of watching him resume his mask of cold calculating reason.
He wanted to be the one that caught the bad guys, the one that made them pay. He wanted dark wizards and witches to hear his name and cower. His want seemed almost foolish now.
Harry willed himself to go to the room. He’d been so angry before and he wanted it back because he knew what to do with anger. This was different, this was a crack that splintered down the middle and shattered you.
He blinked and wished he hadn’t drank enough for the buzz to make his actions slow as he groped for his wand. “Who's there?”
He'd cracked it open and was smoking a cigarette with his eyes on the driveway below, Harry thought he could already voice. He raked his gaze over the clothing once more. He had no idea what would send which message and why would he?
Blaise had been there for him always and in so many ways. It was a debt he would never be able to repay... and something he didn't want to think about losing at the moment.
Ginny sat a few seats away, the only one who seemed her usual self. She regarded him with the same keen look she always did. Harry tried to ignore this as he served himself some eggs and toast. Mrs Weasley poured him some tea and asked him if he’d slept well.
They’d slept in the same bed and done more than sleeping together but Draco had always been a stickler for personal space. Maybe not with him or Lysandra but Harry hadn’t seen him do more than kiss signet rings and shake hands.
Something about it softened Harry’s heart and he turned on the cold water tap at low pressure. He sat there on the edge of the tub, memories flitting through his mind.
“About hidden passages and…” He turned to Hermione and saw that she was having the same realisation though probably for different reasons.
Harry had wanted to ask what the Bentley would look like. How he would know it was the Malfoy Bentley and not some other Bentley? But Draco had glossed over that detail so maybe the drivers would be able to identify him in some way.
He also didn’t need light to see it seemed but Harry wasn’t confident he would have made it through the forest without a
Malfoy's gaze slid to his own plate. He sliced a piece of his cake with the slow practised ease with which he seemed to do everything. And as if he knew Harry would still be looking, he looked up.
“Well, as you’ve so kindly pointed out, my fame and money are not in line with your grand ambition.”
Even as she said it, she knew it was far too late to prepare for as splendid a party as was custom. They would have to do with something a little less grandeur this year.
How fitting he thought as he grasped the handle, turned it and pushed the door aside. A heavy cloud of dust that elicited a coughing fit from him swirled around Draco for a long moment and left his eyes watering. It was a good long minute before he could look up to inspect the cabinet.
And then shown up on his doorstep months later and apparated him to Slughorn's residence on some sort of secret mission.
It wasn't very often these moments came to him but when they did, they came hard and fast. He would wake from a fitful sleep with a deep pit at the bottom of his stomach. A feeling that he was not complete, that a part of him was not there.
Harry relished the surprise on his face when he looked up to meet his gaze. It seemed the smell of parchment and ink and cedar always clung to him. It smelled comfortable, like something he would want to curl up in.
But even as he mounted his broom and soared through the air, Harry couldn't shake the feeling settling within him.
“He stood up for me when everyone else didn’t.” Ron spluttered some excuse but Harry ignored it. “Choices have consequences, Ron. Draco knew that as well as I did… as well as you did.”
Ron grudgingly acquiesced and Harry followed her out of the Great Hall. He was not, unfortunately fast enough and ended up staring at an empty corridor. He knew she would have gone to girls' washroom and decided maybe he should just give her a moment to cool off, she would come out when she was ready.
She threw her head back and laughed. "It's pretty simple. You just move to the music a bit. Like this..."
before running his fingers over the spot again. Potter’s only reaction was a shiver and Draco knew it had worked. He cast a
Harry’s surprise through the bond and the smile that tickled Draco’s hair soothed most of the worries away.
Ron was being childish about this. Harry didn’t want to do it any more than he would if he was in the same position. But he had to and he’d already said he would.
"First off, we were not getting it on," he said finally yanking his arm free and jabbing a finger at Malfoy. "And even if we were, it would be none of your bloody business."
She didn’t pause but just as he reached for the hem of her robes, something tugged him back and he went down with a grunt. He looked up to see Hermione slip into the room before the doors swung shut behind her.
Harry had a feeling it was more than the walls this time. Draco withdrew his finger a moment later and Harry could tell from the silence that all the attention in the room on them. He didn't let himself think on it too much.
Blaise’s mother liked to call it the modern-day aristocracy. Draco had refrained from telling her she wouldn't have met the criteria anyway. Their family did not come from old money.
Not that he was supposed to find out Severus was playing the spy but he’d always known the man played more games than even he could count.
Not still had a book in his hands but he was watching him over it with something like curiosity and apprehension.
Harry watched the exchange with the same avid interest as everyone else in the class. It was so rare that something came along to brighten Slughorn's long and dreary lessons. And if Slughorn couldn't put Malfoy in his place then Hermione would just have to do judging by the excited grins.
It was sometime later that afternoon that Draco was released from the Hospital Wing. Blossom had tried to engage him in conversation the entire time and only stopped when Draco had drawn the bed hangings, cast a silencing charm and turned on his side.
Blaise wouldn’t speak a word about what happened at the party – no one would. They would find out how Slytherins treated traitors if they did. It was a nasty and unpleasant affair that did not need to happen. But then again, many of them had been high out of their minds. Draco didn’t expect the accounts to be anywhere near the truth.
“He gets like that sometimes. They call him the Brooding One these days.” Draco bounced a leg on his knee. “Feel free to spread word of this.”
There would be no going back from this whether he’d made an enemy of Severus or no. There was too much hurt between them, too much distrust.
His eyes fluttered shut. His brain felt fuzzy and breathing felt a little harder than it had five minutes ago. But he recognised that voice. Recognised the resigned sigh that left the boy’s lips.
The Slytherin v Gryffindor match was coming up and this would be the moment to prove himself worthy. He felt the need to lead Gryffindor to victory. Not only as a matter of house pride but because he had a job to do and he wanted to do it well.
“Master and Mistress Malfoy request Master Malfoy and Master Potter’s presence in the private dining room.”
Afterwards, Lupin mentioned that he wanted a word with him before he left. Harry followed him to the porch without a word. Lupin didn’t stop there though, he stepped into the tall grass and walked a good twenty metres from the house.
It didn’t anymore, not so much. He shook his head and snuggled into the soiled sheets. He thought Draco planted a kiss on his forehead but he fell asleep too fast to be sure.
Either way, it was better this way. He didn't need his godfather breathing down his neck every second asking how he could help. If Snape had chosen to guide him in his task then that was on him. Draco couldn’t care less. He hadn't asked for help. He hadn't asked to be chosen.
The car stopped right before the entrance to the manor. Draco set his lips in a grim smile and got out of the car. Harry followed. When he moved to get his luggage, Draco shook his head and pulled him along to the massive double doors. A silver knocker rested on their polished surface. Engravings littered the precious metal. Harry stood too far to see what they were. He presumed they were the Malfoy crest and motto.
Harry didn't know and he was so tired of not knowing. He just wanted everything to go back to normal.
The blond didn't look at him, he didn't even appear to have heard him. Harry dug his heels into the ground and refused to move a step further from the Slytherin dungeons. At last, Malfoy turned but it was only to glare at him with the force of a thousand stunning spells. Harry didn’t dare move an inch. He didn’t think he could.
He hadn’t made back to Gryffindor Tower the morning after his night with Draco, though not for lack of his trying. Getting into the shower had been his first mistake even though it felt less and less like a mistake each time he felt Draco’s wet lips on his skin and his firm grip on him.
Harry's eyes narrowed in irritation. He was about ready to tackle Malfoy to the ground at this point. "Well then how do you expect me to know what the bloody hell you're talking about?"
“You two,” he said unable to keep the shock from his voice, “are going to speak to me about polite society?”
His arm still tingled and he wasn't sure he was completely sober but this wasn't about him. It was about Potter and he wasn't sure what he would do if Pomfrey didn't let him in soon.
Harry didn’t care who he could trace his lineage back to. Draco got the message as soon as Harry’s hands were around him, lips on his. Harry pushed him against the railing wishing badly that they hadn’t left Draco’s room in a hurry.
Harry paused on his way up the stairs. Breakfast had gone on as usual though Hermione had been absent. He’d dallied a little, realising just how much he would miss his friends over the ten-day break.
Draco woke sometime in the middle of the night. He blinked the sleep from his eyes and became aware of a pressure in his groin. He tried to shift but Harry’s right arm encircled his body in a vice-like grip. He tried to move again, this time with additional strength. He came free but Harry blinked and lifted his head.
He let his fingers roam the material of each jacket in case one of them called to him. Even the slightest bit of static would suffice. None did. Harry bit his lip as he rethought his strategy.
Overall, Draco thought he did alright on Snape's test though he could have sworn his godfather was going harder on him than was necessary.
“I’m going to apologise first, Harry. When you refused to offer up information I should have known… Instead, I pressed on and that was not my right.”
It hadn't been enough so Draco had knocked back three vials of the Pepper-Up potion because he needed to forget. But after two hours it began to wear off. He had drunk too much too fast and his body had metabolised it in kind.
“I’ve studied the family rules, mother. I’m not Armand. You’re not going to bully me into submission. The East Wing is the coldest and most neglected part of the manor. Harry will sleep in my room.”
They were slow and Harry could see the figure’s shadow dance across the walls. Whoever it was stumbled on the steps – something Harry was sure Filch could not do. His was an awkward run-hop sort of gait or a slight limp when he was walking.
Dobby tried, Draco would give him that. He really did, but in the end, he couldn’t lower his voice to save his life and when he did the sibilance of his words couldn’t be ignored.
Draco ran his teeth against the skin and then bit into it. Harry’s breath shuddered and Harry canted his hips. Draco matched his motions, his fingers curling around his arm.
Draco let him work, watching the deft movements of his hands as he strained tea into the two mugs and stirred in a little more sugar in Draco’s. The packets of long-life milk in the pantry were long past their expiry date so they made do with water. Draco preferred his tea strong anyway.
Four shots of Ogden’s Firewhiskey were nothing to sneeze that. The other brands were cheaper and weaker but he remembered Fred and George mentioning once that they’d passed out after three when they tried to drink their way into free drinks. They’d had no hope of making it to the fifth glass.
He motioned to Blaise who was still at the bank ankle-deep in water. "Are you going to stand there all day?"
Harry’s eyes flew open. The casualness with which Draco asked the question threw him off guard, but maybe that was the point.
session for two days without any mention of it, he’d begun to relax. Either no one had seen it or they had but couldn't remember. The entire room was inebriated when Malfoy had arrived so it would be no surprise.
Draco was like a lion, strike and he would strike back harder. Harry was not in the mood to argue again.
Harry had been having reservations about the plan since Draco told Hermione and Haneul to and the only reason he’d stayed was that he’d promised himself not to leave Draco behind again. He didn’t think he could actually be of use with whatever “complex spell work” Draco was going to do. So far all he’d done was keep an eye on McNair and Zabini, part of him wished they would try to escape.
He picked his way down the corridors while students milled about disinterested in him. He preferred it this way and unimpeded, it took him half as much time to get to the Slytherin dungeons. It only occurred to him then that he didn’t even know if Nott would be in the dungeons but he’d come all this way, he might as well try it.
Lucius Malfoy stood proud and regal with Narcissa’s arm around his. His long blond hair was even paler than Draco’s, almost silvery. It was brushed back but unbound. That explained the missing hair tie in Draco’s hair now. He’d had no qualms about putting it on hours ago.
Draco rose earlier than his fellow Slytherins the next morning and went through his ritual of making himself look presentable. On his way out of the bathroom, he bumped into Blaise who peered at Draco’s still sleep-addled face with dispassion.
He only wanted to needle the truth out of him and be done with it. He didn't want to wait. It would nag him the whole day. He wouldn't be able to focus on a damn thing.
Lino stepped back with caution. Harry did the exact opposite and wondered for a second if he’d lost his mind. Heat radiated off Draco in waves, he should step back.
He shook his head to clear the thoughts. Thoughts he shouldn't be having. He had been late and Ginny had decided that it was better to begin and... save time. Yeah, that was all. He was still the captain. It didn't mean anything.
Harry left out most of his personal moments with Draco and his broken friendship with Ron, it wasn’t what Lupin wanted to hear anyway. Draco had even less to say on the subject and only Snape’s arrival a few moments later distracted from the tension in the room.
Something in him wanted to reach for the bond but it’d hurt before and before that. Just thinking about it made him want to lock the door and turn away everything.
Harry laughed and refrained from reminding him that fixing this hell hole was one of the reasons he’d come here in the first place.
"That’s Malfoy to you," he snapped. "And if you intend to stand here and talk nonsense then I would rather you left."
"Really, is it my fault I'd rather read in the library as opposed to spending hours flying on a broom?"
Draco had wandered the entire Hospital Wing – thoroughly at that – and had failed to find another empty bed. He’d been forced to sleep in the bed adjacent to his.
Malfoy's gaze snapped to the ceiling. Had he let that out too? He needed some sort of filter or something.
“Dumbledore knew all along, it turns out.” He gives a mirthless smile. “I suppose it’s not as great a transgression in your eyes that he plans to orchestrate his own death anyway.”
He twisted it and leaned his head back a little. He savoured the flavour for a moment. Then his tongue darted out to clean away smears of cream cheese on his lips. It was all Harry could do to force himself to look away then. He could feel something flaring in his belly. He could feel the burn in his cheeks. He could feel the sting from where he had gripped his spoon to hard.
He raised a hand to stop her. "As much as it would save me a lot of trouble, I don't quite enjoy our meetings," he said with no hint of propriety.
Fur rippled on his skin as he stepped into the glow of the moonlight and let out a howl. He lifted a limb and swung it through the air in a high arc allowing himself to feel the power behind the action. Despite his earlier loath to feel anything but distaste for his new form, something tugged at him.
She glanced between them one more time and gave Harry a long look before heading back to the Great Hall.
“If that’s your list of questions," he said motioning to the parchment. “I suggest you get to it, it does look rather long.”
“Really, Alphard, you couldn’t wait until I was done?” Draco demanded in the sort of way Harry knew only Malfoys dared do of their elders.
Harry would have been surprised at this had not all the work stations on the other side of the room been occupied.
The driver took the turn. They branched onto a feeder road with much less traffic but worse tarmacking. Draco endured the portholes and bumps with as much grace as he could muster. He heaved a sigh of relief when he spotted the other car ahead of them.
The only reason he’d kept up at all was Harry’s appalling lack of training. But that was no longer the case and Draco was at a loss as to why people still viewed them as equals on the pitch.
“When did you learn to dance?” he asked and it must have been the alcohol because he didn’t recall the thinking through the question before he asked it.
“Don’t apologise. You loved him as much as I did. And he lives on through you. That is the greatest gift I could ask for.”
"Spare me your pathetic excuses," he said. "You've never had to bear anything in your life and you will carry this around and it will eat at you until there is nothing left."
He'd always imagined he'd be unable to see in Black Lake and had wondered how the Tri-Wizard champions had managed it but it was clearer than he would have guessed, like water with grey sediment. Several feet ahead he could see Pansy swimming through an arch and a thought suddenly struck him. Perhaps there were some useful plants for potions down here. It was unlikely and they may be poisonous but why not study them?
"You just don't see it, do you, Potter?" he yelled. "Your life is far too perfect for you to imagine that someone's somewhere in the world isn't."
"Late night dip, eh?" the man in the portrait said with a sly grin. "Your partner's already in there, have fun."
Blaise was buttoning his shirt and Malfoy caught a peek of bronze skin before he did up the remaining buttons. It did not go unnoticed. Oh how he loved these little games of theirs.
Zabini didn’t wait to grab Harry’s arm and try to lead him away. Harry yanked his arm away. Zabini may have spared him a lot of trouble but it didn't mean he trusted him.
This was all knew to Harry and understandably, he didn’t know Neville, Dean or Seamus were on his side, or that there were sides to pick in the first place. But then each time he thought he remembered the twisting feeling in his gut during their conversation in the shower all those months ago and something in him wilted.
Snape took position on Dumbledore’s left behind his chair half obscured despite the light streaming in from the windows. Malfoy had seated himself on Dumbledore’s right, opposite the wizened headmaster who spared him a brief but in-depth glance.
"Ah Mr. Potter, Mr. Weasley. I'm glad you decided to show up. Pick a book from the cabinet each and find yourselves working stations."
The question was so forward, so lacking in tact that Draco’s eyes widened then he sighed. It was both an easy and difficult question to answer and he was tempted to give his usual answer about endorphins but refrained from it, not just because he was muggle-born. But because a part of him already felt laid bare and this one more truth between them wouldn’t hurt anymore.
He was under no delusions that they both liked each other but liking wasn’t necessary when something far greater bound them together. Lupin had always said that if he’d had someone to guide him in his earlier years, things would have been different. Harry suspected he was taking on that role with Draco. Whether it had more to duty than anything else was irrelevant because from what he could tell Draco had accepted the help and still did.
Harry wanted to ask so much. Had they been male or female? What happened to them? Why did Lupin never spoke of them? Why was talking about them in the past tense now?
The air bit at his exposed skin and breathing became difficult the higher he went. But he could see the snitch ahead of him. It was at least two arm lengths away. If he could get closer… He swerved to the left when Malfoy attempted to shove into him.
Harry held his ground. There was no hesitation today, Malfoy moved with the ease and self-assurance Harry was accustomed to seeing from him. He might not have been looking but he could tell that Malfoy's gaze was trained unwaveringly on him.
Harry nodded, glad this hadn’t descended into a fight. He turned to make his way to the bathroom when Draco caught his wrist.
After all these years of keeping it together, how many times had he passed out in the washrooms? How many times had he stood before Dumbledore or his family or Severus and come out alright?
Draco aligned his cock with his entrance but didn’t push in. Harry tried to move closer but Draco held him down with considerable force, intent on teasing the orgasm out of him.
Unable to resist, he turned to look at Malfoy and found the blond watching him. He raised an eyebrow in question but all that went through Harry's mind was that they were less than five inches apart and he could smell the chocolate cake he'd had for dessert on his breath...
Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy hadn’t arrived yet, for all their talk of punctuality. If he’d learned anything it was that grand entrances were probably Malfoy tradition as well. Not demanded but encouraged, and to a certain degree, expected.
"He feels it, I know. He's my friend too Blaise," Pansy said settling on the floor her legs crossed so that she had to lean back slightly to look at him.
There had been little time to indulge but Draco had drawn their pleasure out until Harry began to threaten him.
He immediately knew from the shade of red Ron's expression had turned that this was not a question he was comfortable answering. He swallowed past a mouthful of mashed potatoes. "I said 'more or less gotten it down' and besides, Seamus wanted a rematch, I couldn't exactly say no."
"Come on, Draco. You know how he'd just love to kick you off the team," Pansy said loading more fruit onto her plate.
He knew from Draco that the Vanishing Cabinet would be used to let death eaters into the castle and from Nott that it would be done at midnight. Harry doubted the Slytherins had kidnapped him so he would do it.
Harry took off his clothes as Draco drew the bath. He didn’t bother unpacking his travelling case, there would be time to do that later. He simply fished out a light sweater and a pair of flannel pants. Then he padded the bathroom in nothing but his underwear.
Harry toyed with the idea of needling information out Ginny and figuring out how much she knew. But he wasn’t sure he would manage the task with the level of subtlety it required.
They found their way to a bright room with glass panelling each direction Harry glanced. The windows that stretched from the ceiling to the floor, gleaming in the later afternoon light. Beams of grooved concrete separated the glass panels.  Minimal furniture dotted the room, much like the foyer.
Ron shot him a pointed glance.  "Yeah, same thing I was saying before I realised I was talking to myself."
Harry was becoming less and less sure by the minute but he couldn’t afford to let that on. Something that was drowned out by the fact that Ron was speaking to him now.
He'd simply nodded because how else would he get the stubborn girl to leave him alone? And leave him alone she did but Draco did not miss the flash of concern in her eyes and that was what pained him most. She shouldn't care. He didn't need her to care. It would only make everything that much harder. But that was not his main concern now, he had Defense Against the Dark Arts with Snape in a few minutes and the man had owled him - he'd actually sent a letter - warning him not to miss his lesson, he would not be let off for it. Slytherins had the lesson with Gryffindors this year and knew for a fact the sanctimonious brats would take it upon themselves to make the lesson a long and tedious one.
He’d got him when his back was turned and now, he was fighting him in what was evidently an unfair fight. As much as he wanted to hex Malfoy to the moon, he couldn't get rid of the voice telling him that it wasn't right.
A rash, red and puss-filled and hot to the touch, sprouted on his arm. Draco swore as a prickling sensation travelled from his, down to his neck and the rest of the body. These would leave a mark if he scratched them, he knew it. And yet, the feeling of blunt nails on his skin was as soothing as cold water on a hot day.
They'd only overheard snippets while visiting Draco but he'd told them in one of his fits of rage that he'd been chosen to kill Dumbledore in order to prove his family's loyalty. To redeem them in The Dark Lord's eyes. Pansy had wanted to hug him, to cry for him because he was already so broken, she wasn't sure he could sustain further damage but she didn't dare, not then.
Although Gryffindor were not in the lead, they were only twenty points behind Slytherin and Harry believed they could win this if the Chasers upped their game. Or he found the snitch.
“Because you do not want me to see your anger or because you do not want me to find out what caused it?”
He’d gone a step further and declined to join them on breaks from the library work or to unwind in the common room after a day of classes. Ron spoke very little to him while Hermione asked too many questions. The familiarity of it both enraged him and filled him with an odd sense of nostalgia.
