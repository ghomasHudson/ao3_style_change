Finally, Harry found his voice and despite any reservations, said “Thanks, mate. I needed to hear that.”
Once the first tear broke free, the rest followed in an endless stream. Malfoy bent forward, hiding his face from Harry’s view. Although, he could still see as tears fell silently onto the sheets beneath him, hovering momentarily before continuing downward. An unsteady hand curled around his shoulder in a self-soothing gesture, tugging at the nightshirt which shifted to reveal the shape of a collarbone obstructed by a singular white scar that snaked downward, disappearing under the cloth, and Harry imagined it continued across most of his chest.
“Yes, it made quite a stir amongst the girls when they were found out,” Hermione affirmed matter-of-factly, “It didn’t help that they went about it so openly after the fact.”
“No time.” Harry yanked on her hand, pleading that she would magically understand.
“You alright, mate?” Ron asked, eyebrows furrowed, and the slightest look of alarm flashed through his eyes. He slowly moved further into the room, nearing the foot of Harry’s bed.
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed even further if that was possible and he jutted his chin upward in a condescending motion, regarding the plate as if were a pile of rubbish. Alongside his movements, Malfoy’s buttoned shirts shifted to reveal sharp collarbones that looked all too prominent against his already slender chest.
“Is this about your job for
However, if Harry had sought an escape from reality, his dreamscape offered no such opportunity. When he closed his eyes, he felt the wind brush lightly over his shoulders, trailing over his skin until it crept up to sing kindly in his ear. The song cultivated into a divine sound of harmonious voices singing out from beneath him overshadowed only by the sweeping orchestra of wind that had been gradually moved about quicker and with erratic movements that unsettled Harry. As the wind, now heavier with the humidity of a summer storm, began to push against him and fling his body about like it was nothing more than a piece of debris, Harry could hear the voices dissolve into bitter whispers beckoning to him. The voices were enigmatic, and Harry could not help but feel as if he knew the fluttering voices and if he could only move closer, he would be able to understand what they were trying to tell him. Then the voices became angry and the wind pushed firmly against his back, filling him with a primal fear. Harry was falling.
want to help.”
Falling.
“With me?” he scoffed.
“Er,” Harry concluded awkwardly, “I cursed Malfoy with a spell I’ve read about.”
“Oh, do speak up, boy,” said Pomfrey, raising her voice ever so slightly.
“Adalia Yaxley?” Hermione hummed quietly to herself, “I’m pretty sure she’s dating Pierra Beaumont.”
A moment passed. Malfoy looked down at his chest, which was still covered in a black tailored nightshirt. However, in that moment, it did not seem to matter, as Harry could see the white scars that dug into Malfoy’s skin regardless of the nightshirt; and, according to the expression on Malfoy’s face, this was the case for him as well. Then, Malfoy tore his gaze away, choosing to instead stare at his wand like it was something disgusting to behold.
“I don’t want to talk about it,” mumbled Harry and Hermione snickered gleefully beside him.
“Oh.”
Harry vaguely recalled the conversation between Malfoy and Moaning Myrtle. He had been too busy being shocked by the other boy’s tearstained face. The word ‘kill’ floated through his mind, but without the context, it held little value. Dropping his head so that Harry instead saw the water beneath his shoes ripple, clearly displeased by his movements. His eyes followed the ripples as they spread out away from him until they glossed over a familiar black and mud-brown Hawthorne wand.
“I don’t know, Harry,” Hermione pursed her lips so tightly that Professor McGonagall would be disgraced, “But you know him better than me.”
Harry flinched, and Dumbledore raised his blackened hand to silence Snape while keeping his gaze fic on the boy in front of him.
“Honestly, Ha—”
Harry felt a study blush slowly start to creep across his face, and he returned to his earlier and far more pleasant fantasies of existing anywhere but within the same plane of existence as Draco Malfoy. As Malfoy continued his harsh barks of laughter, Harry felt his chest grow tight as the blush slowly engulfed his entire face. Before he could say anything, however, Malfoy straightened himself with a wild look in his eyes, drew his arm back, and slammed his fist into Harry’s jaw. Caught off guard by the suddenness of everything, Harry fell backward, slamming his back into the metal bars of the hospital bed on his way down. A sharp pain shot through his back and Harry felt a new sense of irony with a fresh wave of pain. Malfoy stood towering above him, with laboured breaths that required his whole chest and glared down at him with a ferocity he had never quite seen before.
When I finished I went shopping and bought a new wardrobe. I also bought a new wand holster, and a other necessities. My holly wand didn't connect to me anymore because even when I threw the Elder Wand at the Battle of Hogwarts it just keeps coming back to me and I got tired trying to throw it so I decided to keep it. I really don't want people to see it as the Deathstick and I believe the wand understood me and changed forms. It is now a silver wand with a black tip.
“Let’s get the hell out of America, this place almost destroyed us. Let’s go back to Britain, I think your friends would be happy to see you.” Draco said as their tears stopped flowing. Harry nodded slightly and that night Harry casted an obliviated that made the Robertsons and the others that were related to Lexie to forget them. They wouldn’t be able to remember a thing about them, then the day after that their house was empty of any signs of them being there.
“Was- was it an ego thing?” Harry asks. “What is it? Was she better than me? Is she good in bed? What was it? I gave you everything that you wanted and desired, didn’t I?”
“I’m sorry, I ju-just…It just was…There was something in me that was missing and I think that a child would be able to fill that gap.” Harry dropped his gaze on his hands which was still bloody from when he shot that woman.
She turns back to Harry.
“Because you’re my husband and that means that you shouldn’t question my loyalty. Trust makes up the very foundation of our relationship. You are the love of my life and I would never do anything to risk or destroy that.”
“WHY THE FUCK SHOULD HE TAKE THE PROOF WHEN HE DOESN’T WANT THE DAMN PROOF?” Draco shouted.
“What the- Get your hands off of me! I am NOT your brother!” Draco yells causing Robbie to step away from Draco.
“I want to know if this is the truth or a web of lies.”
Harry huffs irritably and Lexie smiles.
“I am so glad that you are so direct. I want you to go upstairs, pack his suitcase, get his things and bring them down here.” Lexie says. “Since he belongs to me, I am here to move him out.”
While I was pregnant I was reminiscing my life after the war. First Neville's wedding with Blaise Zabini. The couple now has 2 lovely children. Next was Luna and Rolf's wedding. They had twins, Lysander and Lorcan. After them Dean and Seamus got married. Ginny remained single until she was 27 wherein she married an Italian man who was courting her for two years.
“I just want to let you know that I don’t blame your husband in all of this you know.” Robbie tells Harry. “I know that my wife has lost her way a bit, but I believe that I can still reach her. I want to give myself every possible chance of doing so, but you-” Robbie says as he turns to Draco. “She is capable of great deception.”
“Okay, but how?”
I looked at the Aurors and saw that they had pride in their faces because they were chosen to guard me. I am thanking Merlin that I didn't continue my plans on being an auror because it was just going to be a waste of time. Like I need to work for money now but even if I didn't have money I would not want to become an auror.
Lexie actually looks insulted by Harry’s words.
“Hmmm Prince Kale, if that is truly your name, what is your real reason of coming here?”, Lucius asked slowly.
He nods his head, approvingly as he walks towards Harry.
“Just three Mr. Potter.”
“I can’t listen to this anymore.” Harry says.
Draco sat down.
“How many drops would I need Griphook?”
Harry turned to Draco.
“Potter, what are you going to do?” He asks.
“Use your glasses and open your eyes and look at him for what he is! This man is cheating on you and he’s a liar too.”
“Father, I am already home what do you want now? Haven't you done enough? You already forced me to marry Astoria.”, Draco said while glaring at the fire.
“In that case, I’ll take their evidence before they leave. I mean, there can’t be any truth to their words, can there?”
“I will grab my gun and shot you with it!” Harry looked at his husband and knew that he didn’t really mean a gun as he can see his husband palming his wand that was hidden on his back pocket.
“Well then Lord Greengrass I am Prince Kale Saros Potter-Black, Prince Pendragon and Emrys, Duke of Le Fay, Winterios, Aquanius and Peverell, Earl of Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, Lord of Potter, Black, Yaxley, Rowle and Vane. Do you still have any problems?”, Lord Greengrass blanched and the crowd had mix emotions. Some were shocked, some were disappointed with Florian and some were angry because they understood who I am really.
“Lucius..”, this made Lucius gulp. “What gave you the right to force my boyfriend and soulmate to break up with me? You really are making me regret the decision of saving you from Azkaban. If I get my way right now, I'll throw you there right now just because of this. You almost gave my child a broken family and you should also know that even if they got married their first child would not become the Malfoy heir because magic knows my child exist. One more try Lucius and I'll personally send you to hell and torture you there.”, when I finished Lucius was paler than the sheets.
“Oh I don't know? Maybe that my dear mother wasn't a muggleborn as you all though her to be. She was apparently an orphaned pureblood heiress. Her true name was Lillian Rosette Valoria-Rowle.”, Draco and I laughed at their reactions. Lucius' mouth was hanging wide and looked at Draco.
“What is it Harry err Kale I mean, I got to be used to it now because that's your true name isn't it?”, Draco stammered.
“Are you deaf little bitch? You are nothing to him. Back off my man.” Harry took a step back.
“Har-Harry you know that I love you right? I think the swearing is bit too much.” Harry removed himself from the embrace and looked at Draco with cold eyes.
. I wiped my tears away and opened the Headmaster's letter.
I am finally happy because
“Beat who?” Draco demanded.
Harry sighs but it isn’t totally in relief.
Draco tries to snatch the evidence that Harry is shaking in his face, but Harry retracts the evidence, causing Draco to sigh.
“I'm pregnant, I found out earlier. Two months pregnant to be exact.”, and there goes Draco. He freaking fainted.
“I can have his babies while you can’t! You are the useless one here!” She snarled making Harry laugh, she was angered that Harry lacked any reaction other than laughing. This was the Harry that faced Voldemort and died more than once, he didn’t fear Death so why would a cheap whore fear him.
“Will these make you sorry?”
“This is my number.” Martha said as she handed him a business card, causing Harry to look at it. “Now don’t forget that my name is Martha, darling. You can call me whenever you are ready, darling.”
“Yes, you’re right. You are very right.” Harry says, and Draco smiles. “I can see how this can be truly upsetting.” Harry says as he motions towards the door for their guests.
When I took off my glamour it showed the slight bump in my stomach. It may have been only two months but male pregnancy advances faster because it only lasts 7 months. Draco touched my stomach and looked speechless. He then hugged me and pulled me into bed. This is the first night wherein we slept with a smile on our faces but first I really have to tear Lucius a new one.
“Look, babe, I tried to tell you-”
Tears started to flow from my eyes after I realized why he didn't want to marry me. Maybe for him I was just a quick fuck and no more than that. All those I love you's and promises are nothing but
“What?! You're the prince that father talked about earlier? My soulmate's a prince!”, Draco recovered from his shock and hugged me.
“I ask you, implore you, and beg of you to ask your husband to stop sleeping with my wife, Lexie.” Robbie said. “I love her and she belongs to me.”
He looks Martha up and down.
“I am now known as Prince Kale Saros Potter-Black, Prince Pendragon and Emrys, Duke of Le Fay, Winterios, Aquanius and Peverell, Earl of Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, Lord of Potter, Black, Yaxley, Rowle and Vane.”, I answered Kingsley in a bored tone.
Harry nods as Draco is giving Martha a death stare.
“We make a lovely couple, don’t you think?” She asks Harry as she kisses Draco on the lips.
Draco stood up and said, “Wrong?”
“SHUT UP!” Draco yells in Robbie’s face, through gritted teeth.
“Malfoy, I asked if you know her, didn’t I?”
“Harry?! You're the prince?!”, Kingsley said incredulously.
“Well Mr. Potter that is a very surprising result and I am also shocked that Mr. Malfoy is your soulmate because just yesterday the Malfoy engagement ring was cataloged as being used. Anyways here is a letter from Albus Dumbledore which he wrote before he passed away.”, Griphook said before handing over a letter. Draco's engaged? How could he do this to me?
She puts down her cigarette.
“What for?” Harry asked.
“Um, uh….” Draco gets out, now looking pale.
“Yes, I do.”
“Yes Vic, I am and now I have to save my Dragon before Lucius traps him in marriage. I am sorry if this visit is only quick but I just felt the need to say it to you all before The Daily Prophet knows about it.”, I said before waving goodbye and flooing to Kingsley's office.
“Thank you for coming to our engagement my Prince.”, Astoria tried to take my hand but I waved her hand away which meant that I wasn't interested at her. Lord Greengrass saw this and snapped at me angrily because he doesn't know who I am yet.
“I said- What did you say?”
She looks at Draco.
“I’m here to collect my man.”
All of the purebloods have either sworn allegiance with at least one of my houses so no one can refuse my orders inside the room. Lucius took a minute before realizing who I really am.
“Burn the evidence, babe.”
Robbie smiled at his mother’s words.
“Get out of my damn house!”
“It was one night of mistake!” Draco reasoned but Harry wasn’t having any of it as his Veritaserum interrogation said that it happened at least 5 times.
“You actually believe this? Pathetic. You poor unfortunate soul.” Martha says to Harry.
Harry was so shocked at what he had just heard that he took a step back.
Martha huffs and walks directly into Draco’s eyes and looks him dead in the eyes.
Harry comes back with a man around their and an older woman. They both stand in the center of the living room, with the guy clutching his bible and the lady holding her purse, while Draco looks at their visitors.
“Oh yeah right like I don't do that either and I am Lord of three houses. One on par with your family and two that is richer than yours but you don't see me lessen my time with you.”, I made sure to sound as angry as I could be. I shifted and turned my back on him.
“An intelligent man like you should know that looks have nothing to do with a man’s propensity to cheat.” Martha says.
Martha looks through her bag and pulls out a stack of pictures and a DVD and before she hands it over towards Harry-
“You lying bitch!” Draco yelled. “She’s lying about me, babe. It’s all lies. Stop telling lies about me!”
“If you think that you are all special because he fucked you, don’t think to highly of yourself. And this? Don’t even think that you can tell the police about this, I have connections that would make this whole scene turn against you, even with the necessary evidence you would still lose and be nothing.” Lexie snarled at him and looked at him dead in the eye before shouting.
“Ok, and?” Draco asks.
“I went to Gringotts earlier and found that I am not a half-blood. I am a pureblood Draco, my mother was an orphaned pureblood heiress.”, I answered gaining a shocked look on Draco.
We arrived at the Manor and told the aurors to just scatter around. I walked to the ballroom and saw people immediately looked at me.
“No uncertainty.” Draco says. “Just believe.”
“Are you really pregnant Kale?”, Draco asked with hope in his voice.
She pulls out the evidence and hands it to Harry.
“Leave. Just leave. Leave now.” Draco told her.
“My name is Robbie Robinson.” The guy says.
“Do like Bob Marley and go emancipate yourself from mental slavery!”
He stops and turns towards Harry before he gently takes Harry by the arm and takes a few steps away from the lady.
“Please, Lord, let whatever is in the dark come out into the light. Amen!”
“Yes you are. You’re just denying that you’re in denial.”
We woke up and took a bath together, well of course there was sex. After two orgasms each we finally went out of the bathroom. When we walked out I immediately went to the door to see any mails and I was right I received 11 invitations on Draco's so-called engagement.
“This is so great! I hope you don’t dance like this with other men who aren’t me.” Harry warns.
“HELP ME! THIS SA-SADISTIC FUCKER SHOT ME! PUT HIM IN PRI-PRISON THEN WE CAN BE FREE OF HIM!” Lexie shouted and Draco just looked at her without care before looking at his husband with a sad look in his eyes. He knew how his husband hated this side of himself, and it was his fault that his husband came to this side once more.
“I will not have this discussion with you. Please leave before I call the police.”
“Psycho?” Lexie repeated.
“Look, Preacher Man. Why should I deny being in denial when I never said that I was in denial? You are the one said that I was in denial, and don’t you deny it!” Harry snapped.
“Draco look! Your father sent me 11 invites and he doesn't know that this would go to the same person!”, I laughed while showing Draco who was now dressed and ready to go to Malfoy Manor where his so-called engagement party is being held at.
“Proof?” Draco asks. “Well show me this proof of yours.”
“I’m here to collect what belongs to me because you stole my man.”
“Those damn, annoying guttersnipes.” Draco says as he moves towards the mini-bar by the TV. “They couldn’t find some other couple to annoy?”
“I want to believe you, but-”
“Harry, Harry!” Draco says as he rushed to stand in between Harry and Martha.
Draco smiled, but it wasn’t a genuine smile at all.
“Oh Father I just found out about it yesterday and please don't ask about how I reacted.”, Draco answered.
“Sure, after I beat the shit out of you.” Lexie said.
Does everyone have things that they hide from me? I folded the letter and gave it back to Griphook who now holds a box with 14 rings. I wore all the rings and it merged to one ring making me Prince Kale Saros Potter-Black, Prince Pendragon and Emrys, Duke of Le Fay, Winterios, Aquanius and Peverell, Earl of Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin, Lord of Potter, Black, Yaxley, Rowle and Vane. I am only a prince because I haven't taken my crown publicly yet but when I do I'll become King Kale Saros Potter-Black-Pendragon-Emrys.
“Amen!” Robbie repeated and Draco stopped pacing.
“Harry you know I can't choose, I am really sorry. I love you and you know that.”, Draco said while still crying.
I went out of the restroom and saw Draco talking to floo.
“You know we’re not lying. Your lying husband is sleeping with my son’s wife in some cheap rundown hotel near downtown.” Martha tells him and Draco huffs in despair. “He can’t deny that.”
“Tell me what?”
“I rebuke you in the name of Jesus.” Martha yells after him. “I rebuke you!”
The lady takes off her glasses and walks towards Harry.
“I have my emancipation right here in my purse!” Martha retorts as she motions to her bag.
“Or what?”
“We’re here to talk to you.” Martha says to Draco.
“Wh-I- Lexie?”
“What inheritance are we talking about Griphook? And about your letters I haven't received even one of them except for this one.”, I answered. It was six years since the war ended and here I am at Gringotts with angry goblins asking me why I haven't answered any of their calls.
“…...so to you, I say that we are very, happily married.” Harry told them. “Does it look like we are having any marital problems?”
“Screw that.”
“Well then my Prince let me introduce my son to you.”, he led me towards Draco who was now looking bored.
He looked at the evidence that was in his hands as Martha looked through her purse.
“Then who are you?”
And with that, Draco left his husband and his mistress alone in the living room.
Draco doesn’t have it within him to respond.
“Ugh!” The woman says as she looks at Harry, and Harry turns to look at her. He almost turned away at her unflattering orange mini dress with her cheetah print coat, clutching a lit cigarette in her right hand and a tacky purse in the other. “Is that the bitch?”
“Yeah! The family you already destroyed by following that madman! Why can't you just let me do what I want now! All you think is about yourself!”, Draco answered back.
Draco sighed before replying, “You don't know how much Father wants me to take this seriously.”
“I am not denying that I am in denial.”
Harry stares at her as she takes another hit of her cigarette and walks away from him and sit on his couch.
“No.” A heartbroken Draco answered as he moved to hold Harry’s hand. “I promise that I’ll never leave you. I promise.”
“You stupid, stupid young man.” Martha says to him.
“I- I don’t know.” Harry said.
“This is lunacy. You’re turning my home into a circus.” Harry says.
“It’s only you, my prince.” Draco says as the doorbell starts to ring.
“Before you decimate me, maybe you should hear my side of the story.” Draco relents before he takes a few steps away from Harry.
“Now let's go back to my main reason of coming here. I want to take back the father of my child.”, I said which made the whole room gape again. Astoria on the other side was fuming and ranting on her father. Saying how Draco is supposed to be hers.
“Well, he’s my man now, and he belongs to me.” Lexie says as she steps in Harry’s face. “I am here to make him mine and take your place.”
“You are nothing to him, and now you will be nothing. Don’t worry you won’t die, you will only forget about us.” Harry obliviated Lexie and cleaned the blood on the floor, he made a portkey and activated it. He threw the portkey at her unconscious form, the portkey delivered her to who knows where as Harry was angrier than he ever was with Voldemort.
Draco and I were pretty happy for having 3 little baby boys. After a few months I worked on getting all the laws that Umbridge passed. 7 years after the war everything was progressing much better. A lot of classes were placed back at Hogwarts. Creatures have more rights now. We have re-established connections with the other countries. Years and years after the war the Wizarding World has advanced beautifully.
“So why don’t you ask him where he goes on Monday, Tuesday and Sunday nights?” Robbie asks Harry.
“Why don’t was ask him?” Robbie says to a scared Draco.
“Ooh, you didn’t say that to me last night when you went down on me.” She told him.
“Well I have found out something that I think I should really tell you now before it blows up in the Prophet.”, I answered scratching the back of neck. I explained everything to them and again for the second time of the day the Weasleys' jaws dropped and congratulated me. Ron and George started calling me Thy Prince so I sent a stinging hex at their feet.
“Well get the fuck out of our home!” He yells as he walks away from them.
“How dare you barge into my home and insult my intelligence and my husband? Look at him! I can’t imagine him looking at another woman, let alone sleeping with one!” Harry says.
“As a man, you should be ashamed of yourself for being a creep that’s creeping on the down low, messing with this poor child’s head. Shame on you!”
“Not if you don’t regret your actions.”
“I can’t believe that there are crazy people in our house accusing me of sleeping with a woman when I only have one person that I want to spend the rest of my life with.” Draco says to his husband before he turns back to their visitors. “Which one of you is Judas, huh? Crucifying us like-”
“Swear, or else.” Draco gulped and proceeded to swear. The bond of the Unbreakable Vow glowed between their hearts symbolizing that it was there.
“You’re going to be a king Unca' Harry?”, Victoire asked with a gleam in her eyes, I smiled down at her.
The doorbell rings again, and Draco is pissed at this point.
“Swear on it Draco Lucius Malfoy, or else. Swear that you wouldn’t dear cheat on me.” Harry coldly responded as he held his husband.
Draco walks back into the house and spots his husband on his knees with the woman bloodied.
“Perhaps he knows something, right?”
“Hey, hey!” Draco yells as Harry is taken aback at the woman who’s just entered his home, taking a hit from her cigarette. “Just keep your voice down!”
“Because there’s nothing to tell!” Draco yelled at her.
“Let’s put an end to this charade.” Harry says as he walks towards Martha. “Please give us the proof that you have now, or get out.”
Harry simply stares at the woman in shock as Draco tries to put his hands on him, but he steps away from Draco.
“I can’t take this anymore. Just get out. Get out! I know exactly where my husband can be found, and that is our business, not yours. I’m seriously over this, now before I call the police, please leave.”
Draco huffed.
I flooed at the Burrow and saw them all in the gardens having breakfast. I walked towards them silently but Hermione noticed me.
Martha sighs and takes her son by the arm.
“Draco, I am a royalty not just a mere lord. Your father would send me an invite and he wouldn't know it's me that he sent the invite to.”, I said to Draco while cupping his pale face.
“You’ll see him doing crass things like oral sex with another man’s wife. Fornication!”
“You’re right, honey. You’re right and I don’t know what I was thinking.” Harry says to Draco as he takes his hand. “I’m sorry, but I don’t need your proof. I trust my husband implicitly and he’s made me realize that. He wouldn’t be capable of cheating on me, especially with another man’s wife. This has obviously been a case of mistaken identity and I’d like you both to leave now.”
“N-no-not even an-an ounce.” Draco stuttered.
“Well if you truly have nothing to fear, the proof that we have here will prove that you are innocent and it shall set you free.” Robbie says.
“Apparently my mother was a orphaned pureblood heiress so that makes me a pureblood and that she was a direct line descendant for 7 houses.”, I answered.
“Do you know her?” Martha asks as Draco took several steps back.
Draco walks towards Harry and puts his arms around him, but Harry pushes him way.
“Yes.” Lexie says.
“True. Right is right after all.”
“And who’s the ex-husband? You are lying, my husband was with me the whole day. We were at a friend’s house so please pick a better lie and to say that he was there last night with you when we were in Vegas?” Harry asked.
“Do you really wanted a child that much that you resorted to cheating on me?” Harry looked at Draco with teary eyes.
“Well then there's my answer. Go out Draco. Out.”, I said with a stern voice.
“Come, my son. We came in peace and so we shall leave.” She tells Robbie.
“You know that it is needed Draco! Would you really destroy our family by marrying that half-blood?! He may have saved us but we don't owe him! We are Malfoys!”, I heard Lucius snarl.
“LEAVE!” Draco says as he steps in front of his husband and into Martha’s face.
“I-I- What are you, the police? Are you the damn police?!” Draco asks as he steps away from Harry and walks around the guy who’s still clutching his bible. “Where is your squad?”
An irritated Draco tries to put his hand on Harry, but his touch is quickly removed.
“You totally knew that he would invite you, Harry I must go now please be there and stop Father.”, Draco said before kissing me and waving goodbye when he entered the floo.
“Don’t worry about this, babe. I’ll handle this.” Draco says as he walks towards the door. Harry looks at the evidence and starts shaking again.
“Right! He’s my man, and there’s nothing to say to me at this point.” Harry said.
“What?!” A still shocked Harry repeats, she pulled the woman and threw her on the wall.
“In time, my dear, in time.” The lady responded as Draco talked towards her.
“I said that I don’t know her!” Draco yelled at him. “And with that, you can get the fuck out!”
“I stand here before God as my witness, Harry, that we have proof that this husband of yours has been fornicating with my wife.” Robbie says.
“Prince Kale Saros Pendragon-Emrys.” I said before I stood up straight.
“What brings you here Harry-erm Kale dear?”, Molly asked while trying to serve me a plate which I reluctantly refused because I am only staying for an hour.
It has been three weeks since I started vomiting. Oh Merlin, why did this happen now? I scanned my self with a scanning spell that I learned from reading a book in the Black Library. The scan came back positive. I am pregnant, with Draco's child. I gasped, why now? Why now that Draco's cheating on me? I silently sobbed because I know Draco's downstairs. I decided that I would keep it from him for now. If he doesn't stop his infidelity I would leave him.
“You don’t seem too happy to see me, then, but that is to be expected-”
The glares and insults had never really bothered him before. But after coming back, they got much worse. He’d been seen publicly displaying his loyalty to the Dark Lord and had aided in the murder of their Headmaster. Their glares and insults were well placed for once, in fact.
times and I'd hate to have to send another student to Madam Pomfrey's with Mr Longbottom."
“Luna, I really don’t think that’s a good idea-”
“What do you mean STOP IT???”
Malfoy looked as though he was at a loss of words for a moment, then collected himself.
He smiled to himself as he remembered that exact moment when Ron had whispered about her common sense in the library. It was so quiet, since they'd been perched at a table in an area of the library that wasn't heavily trafficked. So, naturally, Hermione's face immediately shot up from behind the latest edition of Hogwarts: A History as she heard Ron's less than polite remark. Her nose flared a tiny bit when she was mad, and that coupled with her crossed arms gave them the complete Angry Hermione Look.
Feeling thoroughly outwitted by a castle was a very sad experience, and it tied into feeling defeated by a plant. He could slay the Dark Lord but couldn't tame the vines or figure out where Ginny and Luna had gone. This was indeed a very, very sad experience. He whirled around at the sound of Ron yelling something behind him.
"Should we wake her?" Hermione inquired, sounding rather concerned for her friend, as the look on Ginny's face contorted into a half scowl-have sob.
which I
The corridor was chilly as Draco tiptoed after Theo. It looked like they were headed to the library, which was strange for Theo. There were plenty of other places he enjoyed hiding in when sleep didn’t come.
Luna nodded in agreement as the shaken pair righted themselves. She casted a quick Muffliato on them as they slipped under Harry's invisibility cloak, so they wouldn't be heard or seen; he was quite sure that it was hours past their curfew, and neither Luna nor himself had Head Boy or Head Girl curfew privileges.
“You have no choice now.”
"I TRUSTED YOU WITH ONE BLOODY SECRET you absolute KNOB HEAD," he screamed, "But you had to tell the whole BLOODY table! I didn't want anyone else to know! Anyone! But you couldn't keep your trap shut, COULD YOU!" Malfoy was going on and on like this, just hollering at a tall, very surprised looking Blaise Zabini.
god, that
“AggGGGGAAA!” He jumped back in surprise, trying to staunch the heavy flow of blood from the gashes. The crimson shone bright against the pallor of his skin in the silver moonlight and the pain was blinding.
His peers always thought he was into Astoria. Why did they always assume he liked every girl he met? It was the most out there assumption on the planet, considering nobody had ever caught him even
“You’re a fascinating person, you know that, right? Not a bad sort of fascinating, a brilliant sort of fascinating. And pretty amazing if you ask me.”
"I don't want her to know I'm getting in a duel with Malfoy later just because of some crap he said about her. I don't want to seem like an overprotective tosser, you know?" Harry nodded.
Originally, Ginny had been angry that Harry had followed them, but that was swept away by a towering tsunami of laughter at his extreme confusion regarding where they went. He really could act quite stupid sometimes. Toying absentmindedly with the butterbeer cork necklace strung delicately on her neck, her perky ears picked up the sounds of a rather dumbstruck and frustrated Ron yelling to...nothingness it seemed? Her curiosity took over, her feet automatically turning in the direction of where Ron sounded to be.
"Luna?" Came Harry's voice as he realized who had landed on top of him.
"Harry, I'm right behind you." Her voice startled him as he spun around to come face to face with her, wondering how long she'd been following him.
Harry had spoken to her earlier that evening, telling her she needed to confront Ron about his behavior of late, and ask him to explain what was going on. He knew, of course, but they’d kept her in the dark. Like usual.
She paused to look in every nook and cranny of the halls, searching whatever she came across. She passed by a tall window, the moonlight making the Hogwarts grounds glow silver far below. Ginny paused to watch how pretty the trees and plants were in the light, how the grass shimmered as it moved with the wind. She was watching the scenery for a couple moments, when suddenly a bit of movement caught her eye. Moonlight on messy black hair-
“Apologies, but- what do you mean?” Malfoy ended up squeaking out.
Not to mention how at the trial, his father had  attempted to drag his own family down with him, stating they joined Voldemort’s forces of their own free will. Absolute bullshite. They’d joined because he’d thrown them head first into it. And every time he’d seen his father since the trial, Lucius had made it clear he wished he’d never defected and let his son undergo whatever fate had planned. Which didn’t exactly make Draco feel entirely good inside, considering he was attempting to break free of his family’s practices and become an entirely different person.
“Of all the things in the world, you say that- what’s that supposed to mean?” Malfoy waved his arms in emphasis, then quickly went back to shielding his beet red face.
“Yup!”
“I said that maybe I don’t want to fix things. M-meaning with me and Ginny.”
This thought was rather disturbing and he let out a small snort of disbelief. Why in hell would he be jealous of Theo? What did Theo have that he didn’t? Immediately the answers to his thoughts bubbled up inside his head.
Harry barely had any time to register what was happening before Malfoy’s chapped lips were on his own. It was a very passionate kiss, and, though it was their third, it felt the most real. Harry felt his heart beating at a most unhealthy rate, and, when they broke away from each other, found himself longing for more.
GOD she hated EVERYTHING about that absolute SUPREME ARSEHOLE MALFOY. She hated his face, his smirk, his hair, his
"Oh, of course, I’m guessing that does happen sometimes, you know after they moved the Room of Requirement an all-"
Harry was so utterly confused. He followed Ginny and Luna for a good twenty minutes around the school under his invisibility cloak, and they had rounded this one corner, but when HE rounded it, they were completely gone. And there was nothing but a dead end there. He'd walked up to the empty stone wall in front of him, prodding every single stone in it with the tip of his wand, just to see if a passage would open up. But nothing happened.
“You’re rather good looking when you’re flustered.”
“Alrighty then. So I was staring at the cover of the book this morning and I was
Harry’s heart flip flopped in his chest a bit.
he thought, shutting off the replay right there, not wanting to relive any more of it. Now the whole DAMNED SCHOOL knew. Casting a quick Muffliato, Draco curled up on his bed and cried his eyes out, wanting nothing more than to stay in the safety of the ebony curtains, where there were no Potters, no Weasels, no Zabinis, nobody. Just him and the comfort of the quiet.
"Ah, Harry! It's quite good to see you, I've been waiting to be granted entry to this space for quite some time now."
But until he knew what exactly he was going to do with himself, Draco would let them believe whatever the hell they wanted.
which he would
He shook his head and thought,
"You might just have to what? Challenge me to a DUEL? Oh god I'm so FRIGHTENED I'm going to have to break my father out of Azkaban to protect me since the Oh Great and Powerful Mudblood Protector is going to positively kick my arse," Malfoy sneered.
“Hiding in the bushes for twenty minutes whilst
"Luna?" Harry called as he felt his way along one of the many walls of the room, trying to find her in the vast space.
His feelings were just a knot in his stomach. Not guilt, or anything like that. He reckoned it might be an identity crisis of sorts, and for good reason. Draco had no idea what he wanted. Not from his life, not from himself, not from anyone else. He’d just been living in a world where day in and day out, nothing changed.
don’t you think?”
His words only seemed to put Malfoy’s heart into more of a flutter.
I'll be seeing you around then, won't I." He'd been trying to come off as intimidating, but really, he sounded rather petty. To salvage what was left of his pride, he turned and marched down the aisle of the train without looking back. He could hear Weasley threatening him from behind his back, and what sounded to be an annoyed Granger telling him to just to "Leave Malfoy alone". Absolute bollocks; Granger had really lost the plot. That wasn't going to happen anytime soon now, was it. That filthy little mudblood thought she was so commanding and dignified, didn't she? He scoffed and stormed off the train.
came Hermione's response from across the table, "
Sorry this one took so long to post, I've got a lot on my plate lately. I hope you enjoy this chapter!
I will be back on February 3rd with a new chapter. Thank you for reading! I hope you've been enjoying this so far! I apologize for delaying the next chapter, but as much as I hate myself for making this decision, I really need this time off. Again, I'm really sorry for making you wait, but I'm not doing so hot. Thank you! See you next week!
"Hermione, I know this is just you acting out of this habit towards all the men in your life, but there's no need to wake up a bloke with such a face like that, you know, you look quite unattractive with that ugly scowl contorting your less than ugly features." This seemed to just make her more irritated than before.
It was impossible. That just wasn’t an option in her head.
He looked mildly confused at the fact that she wasn't freaking out after having fallen many feet from a good height through a wall into an unknown dark room where Harry happened to be trapped as well.
Glancing over at the Gryffindor table, for no reason whatsoever, he saw Weasel's eyes darting back and forth between the nosh in front of him and Granger, who was seated to his left, as if he was deciding which he would rather save in an emergency. Pathetic. His parents must've really put a spinner in the works when they had him, from the looks of his clearly misplaced affection. Granger lacked in both the looks and personality department, yet Weasel still fancied her. Absobloodylutely pathetic.
Draco had never confronted Theo about what he saw in the library. He just suppressed his anger towards the boy, and acted as if nothing happened.
Ginny sat staring at the crackling fireplace before her, the heat warming her cold limbs. The night was still young, but the chill still crept through the stone walls of the castle. She let out a long awaited exasperated sigh, sweeping a curtain of red hair out of her face.
mended things with Harry...they mostly just ignored their fights and kept going on with life, which Hermione thought was a very unhealthy friendship. But since when did they listen to her opinions?
"Alright so I'm guessing since you spent so much time getting in you know how to get out...?" He trailed off as she shook her head.
This chapter is much, much shorter than usual, and I apologize, but but the holiday season is always so busy for me. I've been spending my time making a crap ton of hats and bobbles like that. So I promise that I'll have another one up before xmas for sure. I hope you people are doing alright and that you like this chapter!
The bizarre encounter between Malfoy and Zabini never really left the back of Harry's head. Not that day, not that week, not even that month. He wasn't against who Malfoy was, he was just...really surprised. All of their years at Hogwarts, it'd been rumored that Malfoy was such a ladies man, always with a different girl. And Harry had, though he felt shame for it now, believed those rumors.
What in
"It's really just her that baffles me, honestly. You know, I used to think to myself about you, 'How could you dirty yourself like that, messing around with that mudblood? How do you feel not even a teaspoon of shame?' But it's not much of a shocker to me now that you're just so desperate you would settle for someone like her. I mean, look at you, really. You've probably hard a hard time with women your whole damned life."
This time, after the whirring, Luna was seated next to Neville, sometime after the battle, bruised and bleeding. The cold hard bench beneath her felt so real, the scratchiness of her sweater, coated in grime. The giddiness of the past filled her with fake emotion. Neville’s warm eyes on here, once sparking joy, gave her nothing but pangs of guilt. Yet, though she struggled against her body, she was stuck right there, next to him. So fakely happy in their bubble, yet mere meters away from the rows of bodies, the shells of people who had once spoken, breathed, and felt.
"Mr Potter," repeated Professor Sprout, "Do try and pay attention during my class. Now you really need to get your venomous tentacula under control, it has come dangerously close to snaring you
“Ahhhhhhhhh yes- that’s what we need to figure out. So there’s these little suspicious lines on the bottom of the spine, and they look sorta like a design-” Theodore hadn’t even finished speaking before Luna had snatched the book and began waving her wand about in the supposed pattern, chanting “
Doesn’t that sound super creepy? But totally appropriate for the kind of shite this book deals with. So I think if we say that and do some sort of wand motion the book might...open? I’m realizing it’s not a lot to go off of, sorr-”
"HARRY!”
Hi readers!
"Leave him alone, Malfoy," warned Potter, whose messy head popped up suddenly from behind Weasley. "In case you haven't noticed, you aren't really all that
The gormless tosser who got Dumbledore
Not really, at least. Not until he’d spent some time back at Hogwarts.
And, most of the time when she’d ask why he was looking rather vexed, he’d answer with something that had to do with dearest Ferret Faced Fucktard. “Oh
Again, I apologize for how long it took to post this chapter. I was without a computer for six days, so I couldn't post another chapter sooner. This one is a shorter one than last week, but I hope you enjoy!
"Oh for GOD'S SAKE, don't get your knickers in a twist," Blaise yelled back, "You should have TOLD ME NOT TO TELL ANYONE!" In a slightly gentler tone, he added, "Draco we don't care if you're gay or whatever, don't you understand that you're our friend and none of us give a shite?"
It is I, elusive_lagume. For the past month or so, I've been dealing with a lot of pressure, stress, and internal negativity coming from many different places and have been struggling with my mental health. Usually writing makes me feel a lot better, but it's difficult for me to churn out more than a sentence right now. My motivation this month has just completely dropped. I'll be back around March 9th, so about two weeks time. Thank you for reading and hopefully understanding. I am really really sorry.
A Malfoy never felt bad for his actions. Why should he be any different?
“POTTER! STOP IT-”
He had to laugh at how startlingly calm she was in a situation like this and was about to respond to her when he noticed small pinpricks of holes forming on the hard floor beneath them. The reddish, shallow spots of their mingled blood that dotted the floor drained into these holes, and then the holes were gone. They just vanished like that, in a quarter of a second.
"Ah, Ms. Luna Lovegood and Mr. Harry Potter. Fancy seeing you here."
do you know what he said regarding my socks?
Would you look at that...a sight Harry never, not once in his lifetime, thought he would ever see. He could have sworn he saw Malfoy watching them with what seemed to be jealousy. He stole another quick glance in Malfoy's general direction, to find (thankfully) that he had looked away and had turned his complete attention to snarling at that Parkinson girl. Harry almost felt bad for her, then completely revoked that thought. Even before the war, he'd never been friendly with her, and her stance in the fighting certainly didn't do any wonders with that.
“So I wrote them down- in much larger writing- on a piece of parchment and looked at them some more. It sounded like Latin when I read it to myself, but it wasn’t any Latin words I knew. So I found a book on Latin in the library-isn’t it so cool how the library has everything- so I was looking and reading and such and I realized they weren’t words at all. Well, they were words, just a bit mixed up. They were scrambled up words, like those games muggles play. Just in a much smaller font and harder to decipher. So after about two hours or so, I finally came up with a sentence that made sense and used all the letters from each of the words. ‘
“My behavior was most certainly not to be considered stalking!”
She bristled, ignoring his question.
"What the hell?" Harry wondered in fearful unease. The blood had completely disappeared from the ground. And at that exact moment, he heard a whisper of a familiar voice and felt the familiar tug under his navel as the world spun and transformed.
! Something was off about it! So I was really,
RONALD!!!
“Make sure he’s alright, Ginny, ok? And tell me what happens. You’d better or else I’ll come hunt you down in the dead of night and force it out of your throat.”
"It was the pies again, wasn't it?" she inquired in a knowing and kindly tone. Evidently it was possible for Ron to redden even further. He was looking more and more like a beet who had stayed in the sun for too long without a sun blocking charm at the thought that Hermione had both known he was dreaming about food and the exact type of food it was, too. A sudden curve in the direction of the Hogwarts Express caused Ron to roll onto the floor of their compartment with a yelp. Harry had also awoken at the sound of Hermione's shrill voice, it seemed, and proceeded to nearly cough up a lung from laughter as Ron reddened even further and pulled his tall, skinny frame back up onto the seat, nearly squashing his neatly organized array of pumpkin pasties, chocolate frogs, Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, and other candies and snacks, some of which seeming new to the usual menu of the train.
“I feel like this is the appropriate time to file a report of stalkery-”
I was looking at it, something felt rather peculiar, since it didn’t have an author or anything, or really much on the back cover of the book or the spine. But I could
With nothing but the sound of an occasional shuffling or snuffling and the bubbles outside their dorm windows that look straight into the lake, the quiet allowed him to hear his thoughts even louder. They filled the silence, overwhelming all else, akin to spilt ink on a blank piece of parchment.
"Hermione, that scowl you just shot Ron was enough to make the train stop."
Hi there! This chapter is a tad shorter than usual, apologies. I hope you enjoy it still!
“DIFFINDO!
"They moved it after the war, fearing the magical secrecy of the place would be good for secret dark magic practices and such. I overheard McGonagall mentioning it to Professor Slughorn, I really shouldn't have, but I did," she went on, "and I wasn't sure where it was, but I guess you found it then. Congratulations, Ron!"
But that train of thought was cut off by a sudden searing burst of pain is his right calf as the wall
“Hermione! Reading again, I see. What are your eyes feasting upon on this lovely evening?” Theo said in a sing-song voice as he approached from across the library aisle.
!” Then she’d have to fake shock, because
, at least I'm not busy drooling over other people's clothes while dreaming of mince meat pies." With that said, she tossed him a classic Angry Hermione look, and marched off to go read somewhere less Ronald inhabited. He really didn't blame her. Ron had been a real tosser for the last couple of weeks, and only Harry knew why. They had decided to keep it a secret from Hermione.
“Lumos.” The hallway lit up in a soft bluish glow, the dust whirling in little spirals around their feet with each step. Luna pressed her palm against a slightly ajar door, pushing it open with a loud screech of old hinges. The room behind it looked as though an elephant had stomped through it.
Draco thought with a pang in his gut.
“Oh shite-Theo-” Luna lurched forward towards the book, thinking that maybe,
That night, though, he wasn’t feeling much of anything. He wasn’t anxious, or depressed, or piqued at all. It wasn’t even a peaceful sort of nothing. It was just...unsettling. He had so many thoughts going through his head, and none of them registered with any actual definable emotions.
"What was that for, you nutter?" Harry questioned teasingly.
“Luna..are we in the Shrieking Shack?”
Ginny, who'd fallen asleep with her head on Harry's shoulder, mumbled a string of profanities in the midst of her slumber, and the attention was then turned from a still bright red Ron to his younger sister as she swatted her arms about.
“THEO-” She shrieked, shooting her hand out in a feeble attempt to grab him before he disappeared, instead grasping at thin air. Her insides twisted in a terrible way, the fear settling like a boulder in her stomach.
He smiled, leaning over to kiss Draco once more.
He didn’t know how long it would last though. Right now, he was going to watch his Muggle telly. The football had already started.
“Of course she's beautiful, she has my blood and will certainly have my wits to compensate for the eyes and hair, thank you,” Draco teased before they left to drop Jasmine at the Burrow.
“What are you talking about? Harry is with me because he wants to.”
He regretfully pulled on a robe, and made for the door. “I’m going to go back to my room, get a shower and look as respectful as I can while I’m doing it.” Harry opened the door, and in a moment he was gone.
“Harry... Harry put your fingers back in me... Please... Ah-ah! Fill me up! Ah! Harry~~!”
Harry did see Draco the next day. Between that day and their bonding, they lost count of their meetings.
They said their goodbyes, and Draco hugged her for long minutes before he let her hug Harry too. He was still feeling a bit guilty, but he really wanted to go to his honeymoon.
All he needed to do now was convince Draco that a trip to Brazil was a great idea.
“No, don’t worry about walking me to the door. I’ll get an Uber home. I’ll see you at work tomorrow.”
"Potter, report!" He said, loud enough that the other offices could listen, and he banged the door behind him. As soon as the door closed, Draco sighed. "I'm sorry. I'm angry. Just give me the damn report so they know I'm as bad with you as I am with them."
Then, they'd come back home and play a little, kissing each other and touching, as much as Draco would allow, sleep together and wake up the next day. They explored Museums, old churches, food parlours and even the Grand Canal. Those were incredible days, and, on the last day before they had to return to England after their honeymoon, Draco woke up to no bleeding at all.
Draco fed her and she drank eagerly, but now she was turning her head from Draco's chest, not latching anymore.
He stroked the jaw of his husband, and tilted his head forward, finding his lips for a slow, warm kiss. His slid his arms around Draco’s shoulders and pulled him close.
Harry was floating, but even in his excitement he could see that Draco lives in a beautiful building. Fine art filled the walls, everything classy and clean. Harry wondered what Draco would make of his cluttered suburban home, filled with Lyra’s art and dozens of her photos.
Draco’s kisses as they entered their hotel room were searing in their heat and intensity. Harry wasn’t slow to reciprocate, and he pulled his husband into an even deeper kiss, arms holding him tight.
cheese that was just amazing fried, sausages and eggs, and so many cakes and pudding. Also, loads of coffee and juice, but no tea. Absolutely no tea. It was almost outrageous, but there were delicious mango and passion fruit juice.
Harry could see that the phone call had completely shaken Draco. Hot red spots had risen in his white cheeks, and Harry could see he was anxiously grabbing his things with glassy eyes, not even really looking at what he was doing.
, Draco? You hated that dog... We don’t want to end up with something
noises in appreciation of the little puppy on the laptop.
“Draco, I can’t even
Harry sat down next to Draco and placed both hands on her bump. She was so incredibly beautiful, round and glowing, Harry though. Pregnancy was definitely suiting her.
But then Harry came and here he was, thinking about giving up everything to be with this alpha... and then he says he loves him?
“You are simultaneously the person who knows more about me, and the one who knows less about me. I have so much I'd only tell
He went to her page and clicked on 'follow', and scrolled down to see her pictures. The first one, though, broke his heart, although he knew he should be happy. Ginny, Zabini and Lyra were all touching Ginny's belly with happy faces, and Lyra was holding a plaque saying 'welcome to our family, baby!'. A lump was on Draco's throat, but he liked the photo and typed a 'congratulations' message.
Draco was trying to control his sobs by now, his eyes pouring tears like a waterfall.
“Those kind of fictions Draco? I have simply no idea what you mean. None at all. Nope, if I’m going to help you, you need to give me a few more pertinent
Draco breathed in deeply, relieved that Harry had gone so fast, but he was smiling. He never thought he'd feel this way about anyone, and here he was, dreaming about a man who left his bedroom. Looking around, Draco noticed that Potter had forgotten his clothes all around the floor, and moved to pick them up, shoving them in the bottom of his bag so no one would see them.
“Alright,” Harry agreed, his voice seemingly loud in the silence of Draco’s bedroom, with the only other sound their joint, heated breath. “But I’m going to work on you slowly. You feel so amazing, Draco.”
“So Potter, everybody in the company seems to think you’ve got very cosy with management surprisingly quickly. It must be good not to have to worry about putting the hours in on your accounts. Not if you’re servicing the boss in other ways... I’ve always imagined he’s needy and selfish in bed... No, don’t tell me, I need
It was his mother.
“Made you breakfast, darling,” Harry announced, opening the door with a flourish.
Draco was on pure bliss, her body soft and pliant on Harry's hands. She opened her eyes fully and thought about the question.
“Ummm... Look how you always make me. So hard for you, and full of come. What would you like me to do with this then?”
and making sure she felt safe and comfortable. He told her all about the wards on the house, and how nobody could see it, if they didn’t already know it was there. Jasmine couldn’t understand that, but Harry promised her it was
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked at Harry with such fury in his eyes, that it left no room for disagreement.
“No!” Harry looked at Draco, aghast.  “This, Draco, is you all over! You make everything into a catastrophe, love! Of course Jasmine loves you... She was fussy because
Pulling Draco to him, Harry kissed the top of his husband’s head. He loved his husband, and wanted to put his well-being over everything else.
"Harry... You can do
Draco gasped over his glass, looking up at her and trying to react. He was truly shocked. He blinked his eyes, breathing in before smiling while looking at the happiest couple in the world.
Draco certainly looked warm and comfortable in his green tunic. He’d put more effort into his presentation than Harry anyway, who’d shrugged on his leather jacket and the jeans with holes in them.
Draco followed him, his heart beating too fast. He loved that Harry prepared him from time to time, kissing his lips and his hair, touching his arms and waist. He couldn't help but shiver, though. He was nervous. It was the first time he would probably touch another man's cock. It was overwhelming in so many ways.
“When they get bigger Draco, they’ll be so full that they’ll leak all over both of us... I’ll wake up sticky and damp every morning because you’ll have leaked over both of us... But don’t worry, I’ll suck and drink from them ‘till you’re comfortable and I’ll give you lots of lovely orgasms too... Be patient love. Your body is changing and you look perfect”
Draco smiled as he saw the effect he had on his husband. Almost a year after their first time, he still could get Harry worked up just with his presence.
Draco got deep red on the cheeks, but his body tingled with pleasure when Harry touched him. His body reacted immediately, his cock perking up with interest.
Draco kept looking at Harry as if he had just been sorted into Ravenclaw, the book in his hands, but he wasn't really holding it. He was hard and he knew he was getting hotter down there, and it took him a couple of seconds to react. He put his book on the side table and stood up, chin up even if his height wasn't as nearly as threatening as Harry's.
Draco wasn't really interested in the comedy, but Harry's proximity and scent calmed him. He hid his face on Harry's neck and scented him, trying to have as much of Harry's scent as possible on him.
"Are you sure? You'd no longer be a Malfoy..."
“Let's go. I have her bag all sorted and she's still looking like a daughter of mine,” Draco teased.
Straddling his husband, Harry lavished kisses and bites all over Draco’s clavicle, ribs and the curve of his tummy. His husbands skin was satiny soft and warm under his touch, which made Harry’s heart beat twice as fast.
agreements with the Ollivanders. They pay almost half the price the other clients pay. Fortescue already knows that and keeps nagging me to lower prices, and you keep telling me not to do that, sir. I think we should cut half of their agreements."
? He didn’t want to be presumptuous...
“Harry, I'm on my nightdress, they'll see my nipples! And I'm all wet!” Draco cried, clinging to Harry's arms as they walked to the Flu.
“Thank you, my darling,” he murmured, cupping Draco’s face in his hands and kissing him softly, delicately. “Every day you make me happier than I could ever have dreamed... The happiest man on Earth.  And with this new baby our adventure is only just beginning.”
“Easily.” Harry smiled. Draco would be a pleasure to hold all night. So small and slight, Harry knew that he could easily cover him with just his body. Just their bodies, pressed together with nothing between them. The intimacy of the gesture took Harry’s breath away.
"LEAVE!" His father screamed at least, and Draco left, trying not to cry, trying not to think he was leaving his life behind. Trying to remember he wasn't actually alone, and that he wouldn't end up on the streets.
Harry stayed with Draco for as long as he could, but the Healers were starting to get a bit sniffy with his presence.
He was slowly getting used to the stretch, and as Harry moved little by little, he could feel sparks of pleasure, slowly taking his body.
“She’s famished; poor little Jasmine. No wonder she decided to make her entry so early. She wanted to make a grand entrance, a drama queen like her mum.” Harry smiled at the scene in front of him, his heart full of love.
Harry held him tight, enjoying the softness of his ripening cunt, the hardness of his cock and how ready, and full of want both were.
It hurt. But it made her whole body jerk in pleasure, her legs tremble and her nipples harden. A drop of moisture fell from her nipple, her hands grabbing Harry's shoulder and her nails biting into his skin.
Draco,
“My hips are a little marked, too... I like that it was you who did it. It doesn't hurt much, really. You are too careful with me. You know, Hermione once punched me in the nose and I've been attacked by that monstrous animal once and I'm mostly unscattered. I've only been mentally hurt by those things,” Draco, as ever the drama queen, pouted. “But you? Oh, I remember how pleasant was the sound of your nose breaking under my boots... poor little fragile Potter.” He laughed, just teasing, massaging Harry's legs with his hands.
before. And I don't want to taint it with our jobs. We should finish our breakfasts like the couple we are, then we'll bathe and get dressed, you'll sneak from the emergency door and I'll meet you at your house.
The night was long, too long, but Draco kept his smile on check. They ate and they talked and the Potters had promised to be the first ones to give their baby a gift. It wasn't a surprise when they asked them to be the babies godfathers, and they gladly accepted.
He stretched his hand so Lyra could shake it, an honest smile on his face.
Draco smiled sleepily with Harry's words, raising her hands to hold him.
Harry lay against Draco’s back, his heart racing a mile a minute; the breath tight in his chest and hardly even able to open his eyes. He’d never felt an orgasm so powerful before, and the aftershocks were still coursing through his veins.
“Well, my darling,” Harry smirked “if our baby is telling you that a burger is the thing to eat, I suggest we go full-muggle and go to Burger King. They have the most exquisite, gigantic thing called a Whopper, and I know what a size-queen you are. You should feel right at home with it.”
It was exactly what Draco wanted, what Draco
Drizzling soap over Draco’s small breasts, Harry concentrated on the moment. Running his fingers over Draco’s nipples, Harry delighted in the slippy foam and how wonderful they felt under his fingertips.
breed. For love and protection. Dogs grow, and I assure you, this one will grow to a good size indeed.”
. Don’t expect
Harry held Draco as close as he possibly could, and kissed a line down the side of his face. Even though it was just the two of them, Harry felt a little nervous; he was on the cusp of a whole new world.
Harry’s skin felt like it was too small for his body, and every cell of his body was burning. The thought flashed through his head that he might conceive with Draco that night, and the idea brought him such intense joy.
Every urge of Harry’s was to seize up Draco and carry him back to their room. But he respected his perspective, and if he wanted to stay a little while longer, he supposed that was okay. It felt lovely enough to wrap his arms around him, hold him tight and know that they were bonded forever.
“She told me I'd be a great mother... And I liked it. I liked to be called a mother. I don't want to be a father, Harry. I want to be a mother. But I'm a boy, right? That's... That's what my father told me. I'm a boy, right? I... I don't know what I am. I'm scared, because... Because sometimes... Right now, I mean... I want to be a girl, sometimes. I have all the parts, right? I'm so lost, Harry... I don't feel much like a boy right now. I feel sometimes. But not now. What... What is happening?”
“I want to touch you. Harry, I know I'm traditional, but I'm not a prude,” Draco started, raising his chin as if to try to prove his point, even if Harry towered over him. “I have needs and I desire you just like you desire me. I just want my first time to be meaningful and respective of tradition. It doesn't take the want away. I... I'd like to see you naked. Ironically, you've seen my chest but I've never seen your...” He eyed meaningfully Harry's crotch before looking back to his eyes. “Believe me, I
It was eight months after they married. Draco had just bathed himself and was combing his hair. He was so proud of the long locks, that now reached his arse.
"You're not so bad," Draco came back to Harry, before looking at Lyra again. "Yes, I am his boss, but I am more friend than boss, so that's more than okay. I haven't eaten well on my lunch today. What would you suggest me getting, Miss Lyra Lily? You're the expert here."
Harry didn’t reply. Instead, he dropped his school bag and locked the door with a
They were sitting in the middle of the living room, surrounded by his luggage, and she handed him the account with his money on a piece of paper.
Harry shook himself. Draco Malfoy was out of his league, and even if they had something, Mr. Malfoy senior would put the brakes on.
Draco looked at him with sleepy eyes and a smile on his lips. He never wanted to leave there, even if he felt sticky, and slick, with Harry's softening cock still inside him.
Of course, he was terribly excited to see Draco once more. The omega had wormed his way into Harry’s thoughts and dreams all night long. Every dream had been about the long, blond hair of the omega, and how it might feel for Harry to run his fingers through it whenever he wanted. Harry wondered also to how it might feel to share his evenings with Draco; the share the warmth of a bath or have long, lazy evenings reading and watching TV.
“You killed my mummy! You killed my mummy!” She screamed, and Draco could see nothing but Jasmine and Harry. Without thinking, she grabbed her baby from his arms, but sat beside him, hugging her tight. Jasmine still had her fist holding Harry's shirt, and she sobbed against Draco's shoulder.
cold...” Crowding Draco, Harry set to feasting on the dessert, enjoying every mouthful.
“No!” Jasmine now tried to tug her shoes off, and screamed when Draco took her hands off her foot. “Mama!”
Draco swore under his breath, not caring if Harry heard him or not. He had to give it to the dark haired man, he was a persistent courter. “Ugh, fine Potter. What do you want?” Draco glared at the wall as he spoke.
He walked to Harry again, grabbing his purse and locking the door.
. He knew that Draco was ready; that he’d be able to slide into that slick hole and love every moment.
“Come on, sweetheart. I know it’s frightening, but lots of babies get born every single day”
, I'm going to come again..." He whispered hurriedly, his orgasm pooling over his groin. "Oh, fuck...! How I wanted your come in me... I want you in me... fuck, fuck--Harry!"
"I barely touch myself, Harry. And I've never touched myself
After they had their breakfast, they sat on the settee so they could cuddle for a while. It was when Draco's phone rang.
He didn’t want to pressure his husband; just holding him, caressing him tonight was fine if Draco didn’t feel up to anything else.
Harry felt terrible. He should have realised that Draco would feel emotional towards the end of his heat. It was common to all omegas, but that didn’t lessen the emotional effect of those powerful hormones.
Finally, he drifted off into his work. Harry loved the new job and was genuinely fascinated by the clients and their issues. He could do a lot of good at Malfoy’s Corporation.
Harry's mouth was savage, and he couldn't help when he came,
He focussed instead on getting Jasmine into bed, reading her favourite tales of
It was completely different. Before their marriage, Draco would never feel confident enough to get in the shower with Harry and give him head. He'd have the thoughts, yes. The desire, lust even. But not the courage to go and do it. Now, he felt like he was being freed from his own boundaries, things that he imposed to himself. And more and more, he wanted it all. Maybe it was his hormones, but every time he remembered Harry's thick cock, he'd imagine it splitting him open, thrusting all the way in his tight cunt.
Draco and he kept themselves busy, and whilst they spent plenty of their time having some rather lovely shags anywhere and everywhere they could, they also took part in some less sexy pursuits.
to have? What kind of thoughts have been in your head since we talked?”
“Glad I have your attention Draco. I have been calling for weeks asking for you and yet somehow you are never in the store that you own. Can we please talk now?” Harry asked as he smiled into his phone.
Harry felt sad for Draco and himself then, sad that they couldn’t be lying there in the hope that Draco had become pregnant. Harry knew that even two days after his heat had started, Draco could still have conceived. His lover was in the prime form of his life, and pregnancy and birth were truly the greatest gifts an omega were given. They were what made an omega more precious than
As Draco observed his little family, he thought of how long he thought he wouldn't have that. That he didn't have a choice. For how long people wanted to say what was good, or proper, or adequate for him? His parents have wanted him to be a doll for so long, and other people in his life wanted him to be a hero. People wanted him to be the proper omega, and other people wanted him to be an advocate for omega's rights.
Harry held Draco by the shoulders, and helped him carefully into the bed. He lay down next to him, taking the smaller omega directly into the powerful hold of his arms. Harry kissed Draco’s soft, satiny lips and sighed with pleasure. Even though Harry
Harry looked down at the rather intimidating plant below and began to try to unwind it's death-tight grip from a few of his gloved fingers on his left hand, eventually having to use a severing charm on the ravenous vines. He groaned as another two wound their way around his other hand. After glancing up at Professor Sprout and seeing the rather disappointed look on her face as another two vines joined the few on his hand, he groaned again.
“T-the horrible part is- I don’t hate him! I don’t hate Harry at all! I want to hate him so, so, so much! But I can’t hate him!” Ginny sobbed into Hermione’s sweater, the tears mixing with ashes, spreading a sort of tear sludge over her face.
"Bloody hell!!! What in the name of Godric's hairy arse was THAT?!" Harry exclaimed as they collapsed in a previously determined safe corner.
To Ginny, Harry was almost everything. Him, her friends, her family. That was her whole world. She strived to protect them, to insure their well being, to be there for them when they needed her. Harry had to be dead from the neck up to not see that. To not see how she was
A special thanks to my Elderly Friend, Tailspin, for editing this for me! I couldn't have done it without your help, you crazybeanhead. *grins maniacally revealing sharp, bloody, vampiresque teeth* I hope you enjoyed this chapter! The next one will be up within the week. :D
Ginny jumped from the hallway in a sprint as soon as she reached the bottom of the stairs, climbing the hills of green in the night just as quickly.
with a girl, let alone
"Well,
I know my chapters have been shorter and not as good lately, and if you're wondering, it's because I've been super duper stressed out. I've been doing a lot of different things, and along with juggling my school work and mental health, I've realized that it's better to take time off than to keep pushing myself too hard. In summary, I'm calling a brief hiatus to take some time to regroup.
cAuSiNg tHis, yOu bluNDerIng-”
"Oh god
“He’ll never love him,” Ginny mumbled.
When the train finally jolted to a stop, Ginny awoke, jumping into an alert sitting position, a Spongify coming halfway out of her mouth, and then stopping as she realized where she was. This caused everyone to put on a amused expression, likely towards the fact that Ginny had been using a Spongify spell to seemingly protect herself, which, unless the objective was to soften something, would prove itself completely futile. When she saw everyone's puzzled faces, she shooed them with her hands, as if to say "OH for god's sake, just get your things and be on with it." Not wanting to further aggravate his grumpy sister, Ron, Harry, and Hermione immediately began rounding up their things, with Ronald pocketing half his snacks and shoveling the remaining amount into his mouth, ignoring the fact that this only reinforced Harry's earlier mock.
(See the end of the chapter for
On the left side of the room was a crumpled four poster bed, it’s once majestic wood posts left in crushed splinters beneath the cloth, a thick layer of dust blanketing the surface. The windows were curtained and broken, the boards over them old and rotting. Through a crack in the curtains, a sliver of moonlight lit up a damaged looking piano, each ivory key bright in the silver glow. A chair or sofa of sorts lay torn and tattered on the right side of the room, it’s once undoubtedly lavish fabric leaking bits of cushion feathers and foam, dirtied by the years. It smelled of the past, like a capsule in time. Like old fabric and wood after years without daylight.
"You aren't look so fine yourself Harry," Hermione struggled for an epic comeback and failed miserably. It was true, though, with Harry's overgrown locks, crooked glasses, and floody jeans, he was indeed looking a little worse for wear. Looking around the compartment, Ron saw that they all still looked pretty frazzled, even though the war had ended, and with a positive outcome, at least. But with the rings under each of their eyes, it was obvious that they were all a bit sleep deprived, most likely from the nightmares that promised to visit as soon as they shut their lids.
Always saving his arse. Always taking the time to say “Oh, Harry, by the way, how are you lately?” Every. Single. Day.
“Gin-” Hermione lightly poked her on the shoulder.
Luna towed her companion along, stepping daintily over the roots and bugs and such that littered the ground beneath her sneaker clad feet. She inhaled the cool scent of earth as they reached the stairs to the Shrieking Shack, the steps as dusty and dank as usual.
“POTTER-” But regardless, this was his own doing. Ignoring the blood and pain, Harry dove into the crevice just as Malfoy’s fingertips disappeared.
That didn’t go down well with his family, and it seemed that they were even more set on getting the two together after that encounter.
“I don’t know, Gin- I mean, I’ve been noticing him watching Harry and stuff, and earlier- after they...you know- he seemed really genuine-”
"What the hell was that? What the hell just happened? We need to ask, I don't know, maybe Hermione about this, this isn't right at all, damnit, not at all, not in any way, shape or form."
“Draco Malfoy? More like Draco Mouth-joy. Eh? Eh? Get it?”
Since that night, he’d been reading into his emotions, trying to find out why he’d been so livid at the sight of Theo and the Gryffindors. That anger was just there and undefinable, but it would flair up like crazy whenever he saw Potter or Lovegood around. He was lying in his bed again, and it was half past two in the morning. Really late or really early, depending on how you thought of it. Either way, he was still staring at his bed curtains like he’d done weeks prior.
He turned swiftly, and headed back to the Slytherin dorms, filled with an unidentifiable anger that burned inside him, boiling his blood, and lacing his vision with red.
Luna inhaled deeply, then immediately regretted it as her giant sneeze reverberated around the room. She turned to see Theodore silently taking in his surroundings, and she could practically hear the gears turning in his head.
“Yeah?”
"Ron, for god's sake, you were drooling all over my
couple than the Weasel and Granger? Evidently so. Potter draped a lazy arm over his girlfriend's shoulders and she turned and laughed at something he'd said, eye's shining. Godric's hairy arse. Their public displays of affection were completely unwelcome. Gag.
A sharp jab on his left shoulder brought him from his thoughts, and he looked down to see Ginny, the culprit, staring up at him expectantly.
here after everything you've done. So I suggest you move along before Ron fulfills his promise."
“Theodore! What brings you here?” Luna shivered at her own words from the past, internally quaking with anger and fear.
"DON'T FORGET TO MEET UP WITH HERMIONE LATER," Ron bellowed after him, and the yelled "I KNOW I KNOW" from Harry's general direction confirmed their later library meet up. Ron, now mostly alone, decided he'd go to the library early to study with Hermione. He could practically hear her teasing him in his head, "Who are you and what did you do with Ron? Studying in your free time? Pfft."
“I meant Malfo-”
I never thought I'd see the day," Malfoy's scoff came from behind him. Well this was fanbloodytastic. Now he had to deal with the Ferret. He spun around angrily, coming face to face, well actually more chin to forehead, with the blond. He took a step back on autopilot, not wanting to be so close.
Dinner was really nice. He could just eat and think and talk and eat and eat and mostly eat. He chewed his food happily, finishing all the remnants of his mashed potatoes and gravy. Yes. Dinner was really, really nice. He felt the bench shift beside him and looked to his left, where Hermione had begun gathering her bags and getting up, no doubt going to the library to read or research or whatever.
Malfoy turned even redder. It was sort of cute, in a weird, blonde tomato sort of way.
Please enjoy this weeks chapter! See you next week!
“Fine, fine-” Ginny broke away from Hermione and plopped herself on the ground in a rather unceremonious fashion, ignoring the bone bits and ashes beneath her.
This could also just have been word on the street, though it seemed far less likely. The reaction on Malfoy's face when Blaise yelled those crippling words was proof enough that it hadn't been a lie. Harry turned this over in his head, remembering that completely crushed look that he'd never seen on Malfoy before, who'd always been so careful to tuck away his emotions. He never showed them, and if emotion ever did seem show through, it was likely just a façade. So it had to have been the truth for him to react in such a strong way. Malfoy's gutted facial expression kept floating around in his mind, and he felt a pang of pity for him, until someone yelling "Mr Potter" in a very impatient voice jolted him out of his thoughts, and not for the first time that day. Good Godric. He really needed to pay more attention to the world around him.
He was abruptly jolted from his thoughts as he heard a shuffling coming from Theo’s side of the dorm. Peeking through his curtains, he saw the tall frame sneak out of the room, clearing the threshold in two long steps. Draco reckoned Theo hadn’t slept much either, and he had nothing better to do, so he cast a disillusionment charm on himself and followed Theo out.
“Theodore! That’s wonderful! I can’t believe I didn’t notice it sooner!” Luna hopped up to give him a quick hug, then bounced back to her previous position, feeling her face reddening.
This chapter is super short, and just a heads up, it was written in the past. Basically, background for this chapter is that one of his friends decided it would be a good idea to give Draco therapy advice, and told him to write a letter to himself explaining how he felt. Being the sassy boy that he is, he rejected the idea, then decided to write a letter later that night...but in secret.
"Where are we off to now?" Luna's voice startled him from his left as he realized they'd just been wandering on autopilot in the direction of the library.
I'm guessing Harry wants to LEAVE your DAMNED CLUTCHES! I've been sitting here for HOURS and-" the blood drained from his face. He looked as though he'd just witnessed Snape himself cartwheeling about with unicorns on a flowery field in mid May.
“Good evening, Potter.”
Not to mention his gayness, which he’d realized was a thing when he’d seen a very muscular shirtless man on the cover of a muggle magazine. How would they take that? Not well, he assumed. His parents had always pushed him to create an
“Oh, Salazar’s arse, stop, yes I was eavesdropping just a
"Maybe to the library, we're already heading in that direction, and we can look into this a tad to gather information on what just happened," he responded. His body felt worn out, but his brain was buzzing with curiosity, crossing out sleep from his list of options.
I warn you. This chapter was the product of my own pit of a soul bubbling over with rage. Enjoy!
Ever since Ron had seen Harry and Luna with Theodore, he’d been a complete bugger. He had an unhealthy prejudice against all Slytherins, and his immaturity caused far too many quarrels and hexes that could have easily been avoided in the first place. He’d gone absolutely mad when he realized that Hermione, too, had begun hanging around with Theodore. In fact, she even considered herself Theodore’s friend. His lively spirits, sassiness, and good humor always lightened the mood. And then Ron would come and drench it all in rotting sewer water.
Ginny got up from the table and motioned for Luna to follow her. They looked pretty dodgy, and if they wanted to sneak away from dinner, they could have at least tried to look like they had a purpose that wasn't mischief involved.
Usually Herbology was tolerable, but today he found that focus was just out of his grasp. The plant kept poking at him and grabbing his fingers. Fanbloodytastic. He found it utterly unnerving that a plant had so much power, then stole a look at Hermione, who was stationed directly to his left. She was having little to no issues taming her venomous tentacula, in fact, it almost looked like she was petting it...and was she cooing to it? This only confirmed Ron's suspicions that someone had nicked all of her common sense when she was distracted with a nose in a book.
“WHAT’VE YOU DONE WITH HIM? Give him back! I won’t stop till you’ve given him back- even if it means I have to go in there and face you on my own!”
Luna Lovegood had been abandoned in an empty hallway precisely two hours prior. She rarely felt embitterment towards situations like this, being such a patient and gentle person, but time was flying by and she had no clue how to get Harry from the clutches of the wall.
“Do you think we’re in the wrong? For getting mad like at Harry like that?”
Harry didn't think it was possible, but he was suddenly more baffled than before. "Ron. What the hell were you thinking? What happened and what are you going on about?"
" She tapped her finger impatiently on the wooden Gryffindor table, and it made a soft tap, the heavily bitten fingernails barely touching the table with each tap. Harry looked at her sheepishly, opening his mouth to ask her to repeat when a commotion behind caused his head to turn. He didn't NEED to look, of course, he could already quite accurately guess who the source of it was. But he glanced behind anyways, and what he saw and heard caught him off guard completely.
But Theodore never finished his sentence. Suddenly the sound of Luna’s chanting was covered by high pitched screaming, and their sight was blocked by a vast cloud of billowing ebony swirls, with what looked like faces stretching out of it. They sunk to the ground, hands flying desperately to their ears to block out the sound.
interest in Harry whatsoever- I’d bet everything I’ve got that he’s only doing this to mess with Harry’s heart,” Ginny growled from the floor.
He thought of bringing up Malfoy's argument with Zabini, but it seemed like that might only make matters worse, so instead he warned in a voice as loud as the library allowed, "Don't you dare call Hermione that name, just SOD OFF, you tosser. I would get the hell out of here if I were you, or I might just hav-" Malfoy interrupted him mid sentence.
“You looked like a real mess-” He started defensively, wand in hand.
"Fascinating," was all Luna said, speaking directly to the floor.
"Well you know what? I DO challenge you to a duel. I'll see you in an hour at the room of requirement, wanker. Bring a second," Ron confirmed, sounding much more cocky than he felt. His stomach twisted into a knot of dread.
” That name seemed so familiar. Luna felt as though she could almost compile a face to match the name, the person on the tips of her memory. She trained her eyes on the name, taking it in letter for letter, trying to jog some sort of recollection. But the echo of a face to pair with this name stayed locked behind bars in the back of her mind. Luna shook her head softly, and turned her attention back to Theo, who had just reached out to grasp the page between his fingertips. His hand had barely grazed the paper when his body swirled, getting sucked into the book-
"Mr. Weasley, do try to behave yourself this year. I'll be expecting the proper conduct display throughout this term, as you are envisioned to be a solid role model for the younger students. Make an effort to keep the noises of your
“...what?"
Harry looked up at the other boy, his heart doing somersaults and beating in his chest with the force of a sledgehammer being wielded by a mountain troll. Even in the dim light, he could see Malfoy’s face flushing a bit, even though the entire lower half of it was hidden by one hand as he turned a bit to hide it.
“We’ll get back at him, you know? We’ll get back at him good.” Hermione mumbled into her ear, still embracing her tightly after over fifteen minutes.
There was a loud splitting sound from below, and in a blur of brown and green, the ground between them tore, roots spiralling up through the crevice in uncontrollable spires, immediately wrapping around Malfoy’s wrists and ankles, pulling him down with immeasurable force.
Malfoy looked just as tense, his eyes unblinking as they stared at each other, only inches apart.
“That ferret will never love him. I doubt he even has
Weasley took a moment to register who exactly he had run into, and a scowl of his own played on his face as he hissed, "Ferret, you right foul git. Come back to Hogwarts, have you? Well if you know what's good for you, then stay away from me and my friends, for fear that we might hex you to hell and back on sight." After looking slightly contemplative for a split second he added, "Well actually, upon further thought, pop up whenever you like. I wouldn't mind watching you suffer
Then Harry did the biggest fuck up of all.
"I decided to come in here to see what it was like and discover that from the inside. After all, if I didn't find you, Ron would have had a cow. We'll eventually figure it out I suppose," came her airy response.
But when the actual truth came out, everyone thought it was fake. How strange these people were to believe the argument he’d had with Blaise was a hoax.
OK here's the latest chapter! So I'm very sorry that I skipped last week, it was a kind of rough week, and I had a lot of work (school and LIFE argh argh). But I'm back! Woohoo! I hope you enjoy this chapter!
it’s not like my
if she touched it, she could find Theodore- but the world stayed still as she planted her hand on the same page. She sucked in her breath, waiting for something to happen- anything at all- but for several seconds, nothing did. Then the whispers were back, surrounding her in the same cloud. This time, she didn’t back down, standing up tall despite her fearful quaking. The screams pierced her ears, but she screamed right back, voice filled with a boiling fury she had never shown before.
She got back up onto her feet before the shaking was over, desperate to make it to Harry.
“So, what’s the wand motion?” She asked quickly.
say his name. He’s already dead if I’ve got anything to do with it.” The pain in her chest doubled, twisting and turning like a snake. Disbelief still settled in her, her denial protecting her from the hurt. She simply couldn’t accept that she wasn’t chosen over that
Luna watched helplessly as her body turned, her mother now directly in front of her. How Pandora’s mouth opened to cast the spell, how she thrust her wand in front of her, the passion on her face so beautiful, so strong.
As he clipped at the evil being in front of him with severing charms, he decided he'd ask Hermione to ask Ron about The Incident after dinner, maybe over a mug of cocoa. The drink seemed to calm everyone down, and sometimes Ron could be so petty, so Hermione needed all the backup she could get. He'd go with her in case things went south. Harry huffed in frustration as another vine snagged at his shirt. It was going to be a long time until dinner.
“I heard your call with Lucius earlier. That's why I asked you who would you choose between the two of us.”, I replied with a small voice.
He smiled to himself, thinking that he gave a great line.
“If I know her,” Draco started as he walked away from Harry. “Or knew her, we wouldn’t be here. But I don’t know her…...by that name.”
“Let’s go Draco. Don't even bother with the ring in her hand I have 14 rings for us Draco.”, I told Draco who was eyeing the ring on Astoria's hands. We went to the floo and immediately went to Pendragon Castle. I had the castle cleaned and prepared for our arrival. It was as big as Hogwarts so we didn't have problems with space. It was the happiest I've ever been.
“Perfect strangers come into our home, with hard evidence and I find out that my husband is having an affair with another man’s wife! How on earth do you expect me to feel?”
“Whatever you have to say to him, it can wait.” Draco said.
“Who is it, my love?” Harry asks.
“This is all the evidence that you need.” She tells Harry, handing him the DVD and the pictures that she had with her.
“Now tell me are you something? If I were you, I would go back to your own husband.” Harry crouched in front of her and pushed the gun between her thighs, the mouth of the gun was in her panties. It touched her pussy, and without hesitation Harry shot the gun. Lexie’s cries rang through the room and Harry just looked at her without remorse, after all why would he feel remorse to the bitch that seduced his husband.
“Strange.” Martha said. “From what I see, your husband literally just lost all of his confidence and composure right on front of my eyes.”
“All I want is my wife back.” Robbie says to Draco causing Harry to look up from the card to their guests who were leaving. “Won’t you let her go please?”
“Well then My Prince shall we get your guards now so that you could attend the Malfoy's party now.”, I stood up and walked with Kingsley out of his office. I only took 4 guards because more than that is a tad bit overkill.
I didn't look at them but I heard their whispers. I didn't really minded them and walked towards Lucius. Lucius didn't notice me at first but when he saw me walking towards him he straightened his back thinking that I would really be treating him good.
“So then, it is true?” Harry asked.
“No Harry please, I love you and Father didn't force me to you.”, Draco answered with fear in his voice. I looked at him straight in the eyes.
Draco hugs Harry.
It’s Sunday afternoon, and Draco Malfoy is watching his husband Harry Potter how to dance to Reggae music after teaching him a few moves.
Draco is irritated at this lady’s actions.
“No-no. I don’t a divorce, I married you with the choice of following my father’s choice to marry a woman. I chose you once, I’ll choose you again. We don’t need that damned divorce, I love you with all of my being Harry James Potter so please stay.” Draco pleaded as he held Harry in a tight embrace.
I waked him up and laughed because he fainted.
“Because I can be!”
“Don’t be so surprised, darling. He belongs to me now.”
“Look, babe, why are these people still here, trying to destroy what we have?” He says as he walks towards Harry. “These people are spreading lies about me and trying to end us.”
“Yes or No, Malfoy.” Harry said in a dangerous voice.
“Then take the proof.” Robbie said.
“What do I don't understand Draco? That my boyfriend and soulmate doesn't want to marry me because his father said so and that he is engaged with some pureblood bitch?”, I shouted. Draco looked shocked.
“Will somebody tell me what’s going on here?!” An irritated Harry asked.
“Well Lucius I am here to finally take back what's mine who you've been forcing to this engagement. You're lucky that you are important to your son because if you weren't I would ban you from Britain, France, Bulgaria and Germany right now.”, I answered while I took Draco's hand which shocked most of the room.
“Ah, so you deny everything that you have done?”
“It’s okay, mommy.” Robbie says.
“But if you take their proof, then that means that you don’t love me.” Draco said as he gently grabbed Harry by the arm effectively stopping him in his tracks.
“You can’t scare us because Jesus is on our side!” Martha yells.
“I’m not in denial.”
“Oh, Heavenly Father, please bless us today as we meet in friendship and duty. And Lord, whatever dangerous endeavors those among us may take, let them never be without your sanctuary. For all we know in our hearts that even though we may walk through the valley of the shadow of death, you are with us, guiding and protecting us.” Martha says.
“I guess this means that you’re going to leave me?”
“Well at least I get to see what you look like.” She says looking Harry up and down with complete disgust. “You’re short and have blue eyes, so I guess I should say that you look good. He never mentioned that.”
Draco walks towards Harry.
“Babe, finish her off.” Lexie heard Draco and tried to scream for help.
“Why?” Harry asks.
“See how amazing it is when you can learn new things from yours truly? You can dance to the music when you find the right beat. Let’s dance some more and feel the music course through our souls.”
“Remember my love, it’s all in the hips.” He says as he puts his hands on Harry’s waist. “It’s especially useful when you move to the beat of the beats of the music.”
Harry stood up from the couch.
“You had oral sex with a woman, and that should only be with me.”
Martha shook her head, took her son by the arm and they finally left the house.
Harry shot Lexie’s stomach which made the bullet hit the woman’s womb. Lexie cried and shouted as she felt pain ring throughout her body.
“Oh, I am not surprised. I am just laughing at how stupid you are to think that my husband would stay with you, you are nothing than a cheap whore for him. So please continue your delusion.” Harry said as he stood in front of the woman
“Wrong.”, I replied.
“What are you-” Draco said in shock as Harry is now repulsed at both of them. He walks away as the lady takes another hit of her cigarette.
“Leave. Get out, right now.” Draco tells her as she and Robbie start to walk towards the door, but she stops and makes her way over to Harry.
“Yes or No?”
After 20 years, all of our children have settled down already. Altair married Lorcan while Alphard married Lysander. Atlan on the other hand married Teddy. Aurora married Hugo and Aquila got with Frederick Krum. Alaric married Floydd Finiggan-Thomas, Azazel married Damian Nott-Weasley and Aries married Xavier Domini Zabini-Longbottom.
“I believe Mr. Potter that someone was tampering with your mails so we shall require you to take an inheritance test.”, Griphook said before taking out a thick piece of parchment and a small knife.
“I can’t believe that they had the fucking nerve to come to our house and say all of that.” Draco mumbled while Harry was shaking. “So what are you going to do with that?” Draco asks carefully.
“Hmp. You didn’t say that last night when you were on top of me.” Lexie said with glee.
“Why are you on this high road?”
“Finally decided to come back?”, I scoffed.
“Kings!”, I called when I exited the floo. I casted Scourgifies to clean my robes of dust. Kingsley looked at me and his jaws dropped.
“What- That is- My husband wouldn’t be sleeping with your wife. He couldn’t!” Harry says as he walks towards Draco, who was simply frozen in his place. “He’d be crazy enough to do so because I’m not one to tolerate cheating in any capacity, and………...”
“I-I…it just hurts to know that you cheated on me. Please promise to never do that again.” Harry sobbed as he tried to let out the words that was on his mouth.
“Who are you to shout at me?”, I asked disinterested.
“That I’m the love of his life, and in the future, I’ll be his beautiful wife.” The lady says as she takes Draco by the arm.
Ron stabbed angrily at his chicken with a knife, turning it from perfect, crispy golden brown to a mushy vomitesque lump in a matter of seconds. He'd already been in a bad mood from his earlier Transfiguration excursion, where he was supposed to turn a common pebble into an earthworm, instead turning it into a mincemeat pie. He swore he had no idea how that happened...it just did.
The cloud seemed to almost
“Don’t call him that! And I’m not really that sure about what happened, honestly. One day in October I suppose he and Harry got in a fight and such, and he’s been in a childish mood ever since.”
"Harry, Ron, Ginny, if you need me I'll be in the library reading up on the properties and behaviors of the venomous tentacula. I heard Professor Sprout might give us some to practice on to gather the leaves for Potions. I want to be ready for anything, so I'm going to go research them in preparation for the future. If you care to join me after dinner, the company would be quite nice...after all, I'm not the only one who's going to have to deal with the plants and you know it will be rather benefi-"
He shifted his line of vision to the two people seated directly in front of the pair. Weaselette and Potter. Was it possible that there was an even more
“Excuse my confusion- but- if you could explain- what?”
. What had he gotten himself into.
But really, he knew that wasn’t true.
!” Harry bellowed, waving his wand this way and that, attempting to slice the vines. Triumph gushed through him as the vines began to retreat, heavily damaged. But then the cuts on the vines faded away, reappearing on his own limbs, the blood gushing from the cuts of his wand in his skin.
bit. Not that much. So I will ask you again. What’s the deal with Weasel?”
He said they were
“I’m going right now.” Ginny pulled herself off the cushy sofa of the Gryffindor common room, tugging on an extra sweater to go beneath her robes to keep out the chill. She shoved a beanie over her head, and slipped her stocking clad feet back into her ballet flats.
“If you really think that, maybe you should go find him. It’s been a little while since dinner and he still hasn’t shown up.”
Draco thought himself to be the most dimwitted and naive wizard in the history of time. Even more so than his muggle counterparts. This was all Draco could think of as he lay staring at the dimly lit curtains of his four poster bed. He groaned and rolled onto his stomach, burying his face in his dark emerald clad pillow, and recounted the events of that night against his will, his brain playing them over and over and over.
Draco was much too used to staring at the curtains of his bed. Whether the insomnia was from stress, or sadness, or anger (usually towards himself), he would always be forced to stare at the bed curtains.
The footstops grew closer, the thump on the floor loudening significantly. Harry's heart thudded in his chest with adrenaline, praying it wasn't Filch or worse...Malfoy. But as a lanky, chestnut brown haired figure came into view from behind the bookcase, Harry was momentarily relieved to see it wasn't either of the two dreaded candidates. But that relief dissolved as he saw the green and silver of a Slytherin tie beneath the robes.
There was a horrible whirring in her vision, and once the world was righted, her hands held themselves in front of her, much smaller than they used to be, her scars gone. Luna’s line of sight tilted itself upward- she recognized this.
It’s quite fascinating, really. What brings you here?”
A sickening sucking sound filled the air, the cloud completely disappearing into her chest. Luna felt her body move on its own, weakly pushing itself to its feet without her command. Her panicked thoughts pounded on the walls of her mind, pushing and prodding for an escape- before the voice came back, filling her skull.
you know, it was
Malfoy’s hands lingered gingerly on his face for a moment, warm against his skin.
to have such study habits as her. But she seemed perfectly content with learning, and he wondered often why she hadn't been a Ravenclaw.
“No- no, it’s not-” he backpedaled hurriedly.
“It’s much less...shrieky than I assumed. No shrieking at all, really. I remember how scared me and my friends used to be of this place. Draco would’ve ran to hell and back just to keep his arse out of here.”
Hermione put her hands on her hips. “No, I’m just pushing my emotions aside and looking at the facts. Maybe you should try it someday.”
"Wonder what they're doing running around like that?" Harry mused, "I think I might grab the cloak and follow them, see what they're up to. Don't tell them, Ron. Ginny will have my head if she knows." And with that, Harry was also gone.
Ron mumbled an mmhm of agreement as the latter of the two shook her head. "I've got...something with Luna," Ginny explained.
"I missed it, oh Merlin's hairy arse, oh shite, oh god I missed it," he repeated over and over, "I MISSED IT I MISSED IT THIS IS FANBLOODYTASTIC I am officially the Wanker of the Week." Before Luna could ask any questions, he had already risen from his spot on the floor, turned on his heel with a skidding noise, and was sprinting down the hallway to god knows where.
Luna grimaced and clutched the deep cut on her right forearm, whispering healing spells quickly to mend the gash in Harry's calf, then doing the same for herself. "Well," she began, "The wall threw knives at us. I suggest we don't touch it anymore. That seems the most logical thing to do."
“I don’t think you’re pushing him away.”
“RELASHIO!” The vines held tight on Malfoy’s frame, the descent into the earth quickening, Harry’s spells not making a dent in the fight.
“The last person I want help from is you! Do you have any idea what the hell you did? Tormented me for YEARS, then you just- you just do
“If I wasn’t wearing a trenchcoat, it doesn’t count.”
I hope you enjoy this chapter, it's definitely longer than the last! I've had a really rough past few weeks, so I might not post a chapter next week, and if I do, it'll be a few days late. I'm guilty of overworking myself and not sleeping (ooooops). Anyways, please enjoy this one, and next week there may or may not be one.
and then the utmost disconcerting one possible:
Some time later, Luna thought she had dozed off at the familiar sensation of falling out of sleep, jolting her to her senses. It took her several moments to realize she was actually falling through darkness, and gave out a small squeak of surprise as she collided with a soft, warm, lump that let out an "OergOfh" as she landed. The soft warm lump suddenly scrambled up with a frightened yelp and lit a bright lumos.
Luna and him regrouped in the third aisle from the entrance to quietly compare research. Both of them came up practically empty handed, save for a book Luna found with some old runes that seemed to have mentioned blood magic. They flopped down into the velvety push chairs surrounding one of the studying tables in the aisle to translate the runes, determined for answers. Some time late, they still sat in silence deciphering them, and all of a sudden Luna's head snapped up in a blur of blond. She cast a wordless disillusionment charm (since when could she do wordless magic?) and did the same with a muffliato.
The grass that so softly shifted in the breeze, the ashen clouds rolling above the horizon, the scattered wildflowers, the twigs and stalks poking up from the ground. The serene landscape. The smell of rain dancing around her nose, her patchwork dress, her yellow sweater. The earth beneath her, the sound of the wind in the brush...she’d been here before-
Enjoy hopefully!
"Perhaps he needs to will himself out of the room," she thought out loud, "maybe he needs to want it enough for it to let him go...akin to how you used to need to want it enough to let you in."
"THEY WHAT???" Ron rudely interrupted.
Suddenly the ground shook beneath her feet, throwing her off balance. She landed on her bottom with a thud, gripping onto a root to steady herself.
to none other than
"Oh wait, I should have known better than to jump to such
Okay so there's another slightly confusing time jump in this chapter, but if you think back to a previous chapter, this time jump will hopefully make sense. I labeled it, too. I hope it is understandable and I hope you enjoy it! :)
Looking down at the pile of chicken puree in front of him, he swore under his breath at the fact that he'd turned a rather good piece of chicken into rubbish. Ron thought about trying to transfigure it back to its original state, then thought better, fearing he might screw it up and have a chunk of RAW chicken, or even worse, a live chicken in front of him on his dish. So instead, he just started on his next piece of chicken, this time vowing not to turn violent against it for forces it could not control.
” That shut Hermione up.
Which directly translates into
He narrowed his eyes, the frown on his face deepening as he snarled, "Weasel. Fancy seeing you here."
Her gut twisted uncontrollably, the memory she’d squashed down only dragging her deeper into her prison.
“HARRY!”
Theo got to spend time with Potter.
to fix things with Ginny! You’re not saying you want to throw that whole thing with her away-”
Ron was the first out the door of their crowded compartment, only looking up from his snacks when he ran into the one and only person they'd all been planning on avoiding that year. Draco Malfoy.
In the Before Times, as Harry called them, the Gryffindors and Slytherins had a sort of unspoken, unwritten contract testifying their disliking and coldness for each other. He liked to believe that he was the exact opposite of the snooty buggers, wishing that he had a clean slate he could rub in their faces. But they had all done things in the war that no person, especially child, should ever have had to. Slytherins and Gryffindors in general were supposed to be polar opposites. But Harry remembered how close he'd been to being put into Slytherin himself. A shiver of utmost disgust ran down his spine like frost kissed spiders as he thought about how different things would have been.
Hi, so this one's a little longer than the last one. Hope you enjoy it. I promise that I'll go into more depth with the "funky death room" in the next chapter.
im baaaaaaack this chapter was not great apologies
and couldn’t be heard.
He’d never
"Alright then, Harry," Luna said with a soft smile, “Nothing like topping off the night with some light reading.” Harry couldn’t help but release a snort of amusement at her words. She was really something else.
“Well, I mean I’m not really giving him a chance to tell me. I’ve been too busy being mad.”
The earth sealed over the cracks, the grass covered the bare earth once again. Then everything was peaceful, with only the wind whispering softly, the conflict beneath raging on in a cage of roots and soil.
“We’ve been standing here for quite some time now.”
This is the second half of the previous chapter. I apologize, but I'll be unable to post a complete chapter before Christmas, so I hope this one satisfies for a few days. Happy Holidays, everyone! I hope you can still be happy this time of year, with everything that's going on. Anyways, here it is.
“Yeah,” Ginny rubbed her eyes tiredly, “Yeah, I do. I should be supporting him when he needs help, not pushing him further away.”
something into it, piercing his flesh and hurting like hell.
“And what about it?”
RONALD,
Harry froze in place, the shock and adrenaline rooting him to the spot, not even offering him the choice of movement.
With a loud grunt of displeasure, Draco swiftly packed up his things and forced himself out of his compartment, Theo right behind him. As soon as his crossed the threshold between the compartment and the hallway, he collided with something very tall, very orange, very freckled, and very angry.
He looked as though he were checking if he had Luna’s full attention. She nodded her head for him to continue.
Did she really think that he was interested in her? By the looks of how she was batting her stubby eyelashes, yes, it did seem that she had the completely outlandish idea that he fancied her. How did he even put up with her for that many years? Between her and the Weasel, he wasn't completely sure of how he hadn't just taken an Avada Kedavra to himself yet.
Before she could prod any further, he turned on his heel and walked away, humming a tune to himself as he disappeared into the books once more.
and whispering things like 'Come closer my pretties'. If I didn't already know your dream tendencies, I would have assumed you were just some trench coat clad pervert fantasizing about creeping after unsuspecting females." He felt his ears and cheeks immediately pigmenting to a signature Ronald Weasley beet red, embarrassed he'd been mumbling in his sleep, and about mince meat pies of all things. When Hermione saw this, though, her petrifying stare seemed to soften a bit, a teasing glint in her honey brown eyes.
"Ronald," she spoke in her signature whimsy, soft voice, "Why are you hitting the wall? That must be awfully painful, considering it's solid stone." He looked up at her in a pleading way like he hoped she was some goddess with all the answers to his questions.
that would be a powerful, godlike, very blond Malfoy and smack sense into the wizarding folk of the age, which wasn’t even possible at this point, not to mention the generations upon generations of hating on homosexuality. They would attempt to tie him down with an arranged marriage, probably with that Greengrass girl. They’d spoken once, and she’d made it clear that if they ever had to get married, she’d poison his morning tea out of spite. He’d told her that if was married to her, he’d willingly drink it.
“Really, Malfoy. What the hell are you doing peeping around the bushes, looking all shifty in the fog,
He loathed his choices, that went without questioning. He wanted to change. This road he’d taken was never his choice to begin with. He wouldn’t go so far and befriend any Gryffindors (he shuddered at the thought), but he knew he wanted people to know that he had changed. There were just so many obstacles in the way. Well, mostly just one big one:
for a moment- as if it were sizing her up. Then it
Draco sat down primly at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall, Pansy trailing behind him. She never did get over him, the damned plonker. She was really getting on his nerves lately, with all her
Hermione’s shot up from her book. “Now where exactly did you hear that? You weren’t eavesdropping, were you?” As his grin widened even more, she scolded, “Theodore Nott, I really did expect exemplary behavior from a prefect like yourself.”
The information started flowing in a frantic, crashing waterfall out of Ron's mouth. He was done explaining in a matter of minutes. Harry suggested that they tell Hermione where they were going, but Ron really didn't want to.
My hiatus is officially over, and, now that it is, I can see that it was almost futile as I did anything but relax. Oops. Anyways, thanks for waiting!
Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry.
“Come on, Theodore, just up these stairs,” She turned and smiled at Theodore, who was looking a bit worse for wear and frightened. He nodded quietly, and followed her up each step, the silence of their surroundings broken by the peskily squeaky stairs. The hallway was dim in the night, even more so than usual.
“My legs are eventually going to start seizing if I don’t move around a bit.”
He curled onto his side, relishing the comfort of the sheets wrapped around him, as he began to pick apart his anger. He knew that he wasn’t jealous of Lovegood or Potter...they might have had fame and they might have taken the right path with their lives, but he wasn’t jealous of them...no, it seemed he was jealous of Theo.
"LuNa! Get away from this wall!" He bellowed, just as he heard a small shriek coming from her direction, cutting through his words mid sentence. He bolted away to their previous position to the left away from that particular wall and grabbed Luna's arm mid sprint, dragging her along.
Draco,
Again, I'm sorry the chapters are taking so long to go up, I apologize for the amount of time between each. I've got a lot going on for me. I hope you enjoy this one!
Hello readers,
” Harry shouted over the wind, his voice climbing. He huffed his breaths in and out, Malfoy’s eyes on him still. Harry fought to control his emotions, which were bubbling up in massive waves, slamming him over and over.
Draco Malfoy had now turned his anger to another person at the table, but this time it was just complete, hot rage. He stood, his eyes brimming with fury induced tears.
Could Harry really be so blind and naive as to pretend those things never happened- while in the process, pushing away everyone who loved him except the fake ferret who didn’t?
Draco took a deep breath, willing himself not to orgasm immediately. He twisted his fingers into Harry’s hair, and when he looked down, Harry was staring back at him.
Draco tried not to moan so loud, but it was hard. His whole body was into that fantasy, lost in Harry's fingers brushing inside him. His cock was so hard that it was about to burst at any second, his entrance sensitive. His cunt was gushing clear liquid, his pleasure falling down and wetting over Harry's fingers and his arsehole, making everything even wetter.
need to eat again.  Ollivander’s limousine was waiting at the front of the hotel, and they were soon speeding towards the factory.
, Harry thought,
“I'll know when I get there, I guess. For now, let's just buy the last things... I feel tired and my feet hurt. I think I'm getting too fat,” Draco sighed, caressing her baby bump with affection.  “You'll have plenty opportunity to bond with our baby. I bet Jim will love you as much as I do, Harry. And I can't wait to see you hugging them and putting them to sleep... “
Harry swallowed, not really feeling very vocal. Indeed, he was feeling rather more
Draco,
“I want you Draco, want this... Look at you, wet and slick and so ready for me,” Harry stroked his wife’s sweet entrance, and fingered her small cock.
The public kisses were a surprise as well. Draco was publicly shy and reserved. Just who was this beautiful blond man who said they were married? Harry needed to know what was going on because he was starting to feel very naughty indeed...
Draco felt a pang on his heart, like Harry had grabbed it and squeezed it. He tried to focus on his food, but he wasn't in the mood anymore. He couldn't have a future with Harry, not if his parents could intervene.
He looked up at Harry, big, grey eyes waiting. He knew Harry has had other lovers before him, and it made him a little nervous. What if he wasn't good enough? What if Harry didn't like his body? What if he didn't like the way he was? Draco worried his bottom lip, trying not to listen to his worries.
They’d confirmed their pregnancy later on that week, and Harry had felt tears prick his eyes as he saw their
“Fuck, Harry... I want you to leave marks all over my chest. I want you to suck them until they're sore and red and I'll feel your mouth on me whenever I put a shirt on. I want them to bounce when you fuck me, and I want you to hold them tight as I ride you... Please, Harry... Please, please do it...”
“But I don't want to be a girl all the time. Sometimes I love being a boy and wearing your ugly jackets and boots. Do you think... You could switch? Maybe?  I don't want to ask a lot of you Harry... But... Can you treat me like a girl right now? Like I'm going to be a mummy and care for our baby?  I'll... I guess I'll tell you when I don't feel like a girl anymore. Can you do it?”
“Well, I used to think you were handsome at school. Maybe I should have told you earlier just how bloody fascinating you actually were”.
“I know you feel like you’ve lost everything, love,” he whispered into his lover’s skin, “but I swear... I promise. You’ll not lose me. You’re all that matters, now.”
As for Draco, he was an adult. If he wanted to have a full relationship, then Harry was quite prepared to provide. He typed a quick message back:
"Don't fool yourself, Potter. The alpha my parents want for me will probably be twenty, thirty years older than
The strawberries were delicious, and Harry was taken once again with how lucky he was, how much he truly loved his husband.
“We have no preparation time. And where is this place, you said? Up North? I've heard it is even hotter! And we won't even get close to the beach! Fucking 'Middle of the World' place. The World is round!
Harry knew that he’d be coming in only seconds too. Draco was the most arresting sight of his life; alluring and sensual. He wanted so much... More than he’d allowed himself ever to want before, the hope of a future between the two of them. A future filled with babies, laughter and happiness.
-x-x-
She didn't answer immediately, so Draco decided to go to sleep. He had a long day and he would have another one tomorrow. He didn't want to keep thinking about it.
“I want us to be as we are right now, Harry. Me, you, and Jim. But... I just feel different
, too powerful. If he didn’t leave soon, he wouldn’t leave at all. He didn’t want to be a regret.
Harry let himself into Draco’s apartment. The smell of the Thai takeout was strong, but he could see that Draco hadn’t unpacked any of the little packets.
He wrote a quick text to Draco as they sped towards his destination. “I’m on my way, love. Can’t wait to have you in my arms once more... It’s been too long. Run yourself a bath and get in to wait for me”.
"Harry, I... I don't know what to say... I just... I'm sorry, it's just that a lot of things are happening at the same time. I'd love anything, really. I'm happy just being with you. Let me think about it, okay? We'll... We'll talk about it soon and when I'm feeling capable of holding my tears we'll discuss it again."
“It is a baby, Draco. And it’s ours.... You wonderful, perfect body is being so clever and keeping our baby warm and safe. I honestly can’t believe it’s happened.”
Draco opened her eyes and a smile at the same time. She didn't know how happy it would make her to be called 'wife', how it would warm her up.
Draco smiled as he said it. He loved the fact Harry had been the one to ruin him.
"I was furious. Said pretty damn nasty things. Father ordered me to leave. Said I wasn't his son, that I was a failure. He... He gave the company to Nott in less than 24 hours. I'm out of job, out of money and out of home. That's... That's why I'm here... I hope you don't mind me staying... I..." Draco sobbed, holding his coffee mug for dear life. "I have nowhere else to go."
They didn't expect to see his baby bump or his wedding band on his ring finger though, nor Harry at his side.
Harry murmured the words into the soft, damp material of the knickers, his mouth all over his husband’s cock. Biting the soft material, he jerked his head downwards, pulling the knickers down to Draco’s knees.
“Well then get the hell on with it!”
“I’m saying that- I don’t know- yes that’s what I was trying to get across.”
Harry scrambled to grab on to the roots and Malfoy, trying desperately to pull them off the flailing boy as he was dragged down and down into the ground.
, you insufferable pillock, never ever call me that again.”
“Good lord, the kisses didn’t say it for me? Fine, fine- though it pains me greatly to admit this out loud, I have grown somewhat...attached to you? In a...romantic fashion…?”
As she came up to a rather familiar corner, the yelling got louder, and she realized that this was where the wall that Harry had been ever so fascinated with was located. It wasn't hard to believe that Ron had joined Harry in the madness of wall poking...they could be such a thick skulled pair at times.
conclusions. Of course you're here looking for your muggleborn girlfriend. I'll never understand why a person with her level of intelligence would stoop so low as to be with you. I mean, you're about as smart as, well, nothing, you have the temper of a badger with its coat on fire, and that hair really just doesn't suit you. I mean I would never take an interest in you, if I were her, it's just such a complete waste." Ron felt his face reddening at the Hermione comment. He was thoroughly pissed. But Malfoy didn't stop there.
