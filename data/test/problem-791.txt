With a sudden clarity, Harry recalled the conversation from the pub last night.
Their week in the Amazon had been truly phenomenal, Draco felt. He’d seen flowers in all shades of the rainbow, their petals used as beds for small, furry sprite-like beings that Victor called
“I don't know. Maybe it’s an omen?”
It seemed to be an eternity later that they finally reached the Pass. There were groups of muggle hikers milling about and waiting on their friends to catch up, and they cheered and applauded them as Harry and Draco finally reached the top of their ascent. Harry’s face - relieved, happy, and a little bit astounded - as he looked down on the valley to see a rainbow eking its way over Cusco in the distance, just about made Draco’s heart burst. The adrenaline of the challenging hike and the jubilant atmosphere had Draco grabbing Harry’s face and pulling him in for a bruising kiss.
"Are you ill? Terminally?"
Draco shifted closer, sliding his leg down Harry’s and turning his face to kiss the palm of Harry’s hand where it rested by his jaw. “That’s okay,” he mumbled, “I had an early night.
do you even manage to get yourself into these situations?”
“You know I lived in the south of France with Mother.” Harry nodded. “At first, I was only going to stay with her for a couple of months, to sort out the last bits of my probation – getting a job and such.”
Pansy dropped her head to Ginny’s shoulder. “Which club?”
“Shots anyone?” He asked compulsively, desperate to get away from the table for a few minutes. “I hear Tom’s got a new one that makes you breathe fire.”
He didn’t have his wand on him, so Harry rinsed the glasses by hand as his thoughts churned. It shouldn’t really have been a big deal; he could even, to some extent, understand why Draco would be reluctant to return to the wizarding world. The press would no doubt flare up when – if? – they ever made their relationship public. Harry still found himself overwhelmed by people who stared, who wanted autographs or a slice of his life in one way or another. It was, in fact, the very reason he’d found himself stumbling into Black’s Books, that rainy April day, when the pressure of the wizarding world’s scrutiny had become too much for him. So, yes, he could understand Draco’s concerns.
“So, don’t you think it’s weird that he hasn’t even owled him since their date?”
Hermione nodded. She reached up and tucked Pansy’s bob behind her ear. “I’ll be the one in…something fairly mundane, I imagine.”
this is why Hermione does the talking.” He ran a hand through his hair and grimaced, although Harry wasn’t sure if it was from the sweat or the conversation. “Basically, don’t feel like you can’t tell us you fancy him because you think we might get upset. He’s alright.”
“But they were
trying to ask you to marry me, terrified that you were going to say no and it might change how you feel about me and now you’re telling me you would have said yes?
"Ah. Sorry. I left my wand at home today. Wanted a bit of a break from wizard life."
Merlin, I thought I was going to have to fellate the utensils all night before you got the message.”
he owned last night when he and Harry had been spooned cosily in the small one-room tent they’d purchased from a wizard in Cusco).
“Draco?” Harry said softly, a little unsure. He’d never seen Draco look so- well,
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco smiled as he pinned the other boy down on the bed. “I like you too.”
, he told himself as they rounded the corner onto Grimmauld Place. His lungs were definitely on fire now, as they broke into a sprint towards Harry’s house, eating up the last few metres. They finally slowed to a stop on the pavement outside where Number Twelve was squeezing its way into existence, Harry bending over as he tried to catch his breath.
“So you’re going to get married
“Oh yeah,

been a while, hasn’t it?” Draco murmured as he placed one hand on Harry’s stomach, smirking slightly when the muscles jumped on contact.
Draco is made of moonlight tonight. He opens the door with messy silver hair and sleepy silver eyes and perfect silver skin and my heart trips over itself. I’ve never wanted anything as much as I want him, my Draco.
Draco jerked his head back and looked down at Basil, who’d stood up on his hind legs to lick a stripe across his chin. He meowed again, bunting his forehead to Draco’s cheek.

. I told her I was quite assuredly gay and that low-rent Legolas wasn’t really my aesthetic, and she hasn’t come back to the shop since.”)
“Scared, Malfoy?” he murmured, relishing the soft huff of laughter against his mouth.
Draco grinned. “So…? Got something to ask me?”
“You’re lucky she isn’t cooking you mushrooms,” he muttered lowly.
And Harry had sat there, a rigid smile on his face, feeling like a shite friend for being upset that Draco was on a date with, by all accounts, a decent bloke.
Besides, Harry thought, it

“A reminder.”
His face is like marble, so perfect and so smooth and so

for you to accidentally propose to me with the words

Draco let out a breath he didn’t know he’d been holding. “Giving me your blessing then?”
The Portkey Office at Puerto Maldonado was nothing more than a small wooden shack on the banks of the Tambopata river. The humidity, when they walked out of the boundary of the cooling charms, hit Draco like a wall. It was just after midday and the air was swollen with heat, resting heavy on his skin, which instantly achieved a sweaty, rosy gleam, and made every breath feel like treacle in his chest. It somehow even bloody
In the week before Draco’s birthday, Harry had Floo’d Ron and Hermione in a panic no less than three times.
Harry tried not to dwell too much on the way his stomach would flutter when Draco’s shoulder brushed his, or how nice it felt to have Draco throw an arm around him, clumsy and tipsy and shaking with laughter. He was so
“Didn’t you,
“Sounds like Flint alright,” Harry laughed. “Even if he is a dad now. Anyway, anyone for a drink? I reckon it’s my round.”
Later, when Harry lay tangled in Draco’s arms, he couldn’t help the grin that stretched his face and the way his heart felt full and content as it beat with wild abandon in his chest, sounding like a joyful mantra of
Draco watched in fascination as a deep flush stained Potter’s cheeks and he sat back up, picking at the bedsheets.
“I don’t want you to get married.”
Harry shuffled through the stack, surprised that Draco had kept all five of the letters he’d sent… and had written back?
“Yeah.” He smoothed down Draco’s hair, taking a moment to enjoy how his sharp, haughty beauty slackened in sleep.
Harry gave a soft snore. Draco laughed and tightened his arms around him.
"Don't play it down, Har. It was very romantic, Mione, like Notting Hill." Since Arthur had spelled a video player to work at the Burrow, the Weasleys had incorporated a muggle movie into their weekly Sunday dinner. Having skipped the previous three, Harry had felt compelled to attend the last one, where Ron had promptly fallen in love with Julia Roberts after watching a double billing of Notting Hill and Pretty Woman.
Draco shifted on the couch a little nervously. “Well, see, the thing is - Basil needs a place to stay.” Harry opened his mouth but Draco cut him off quickly. “Luna said he’d been left in a box outside the Menagerie but she was struggling to find room for him since they took in all those Kneazles a few weeks ago and – well, just look at his
“Since when are you and Parkinson a thing?!” Harry burst out the second the sound of the whooshing flames died down.
Harry and Draco rediscovered the easy banter of their Eighth Year once the conversation lightened, and even Ron seemed relaxed and friendly by the end of the night.
As it had done for the past hour, Harry’s mood swung sharply from morose to irate, and he looked around the garden for a distraction. Hermione was showing Arthur the iPod she had bought Harry for his birthday.
The next time Harry seriously thought about proposing, he got as far as actually asking Draco a question. His famous Gryffindor bravery had buffeted him down the hall and into the front room where Draco lounged on the couch in soft grey jogging bottoms and an oatmeal t-shirt. His hair was pulled up in a bun and he was reading something intelligent and dense-looking. However, Harry’s courage failed him at the last moment and instead of asking his beautiful, wonderful boyfriend if he would do him the honour of becoming his husband, he instead asked him if he’d-
"Where're you meeting him, then?"
“I hear you, Bas. I know exactly how you feel.”
When he finished the glass of water, Draco grabbed Harry’s arm and dragged him to a standing position. “Right, come on, you, let’s get you to bed.”
Harry Apparated into the hallway, wincing as the sharp
“Did you seriously just make a joke about the time I set the kitchen on fire?”
“It seems to take a lot out of you,” Harry remarked carefully as he set the toast on the table.
“So what have-”
Draco chuckled. “You didn’t even know Thomas and Finnegan were at it and they were in your bloody dorm.”
Sorry it's a short update! I thought I would have a lot more writing time this weekend but I didn't and had to cobble this together on the tube! x
(When Harry had contested that, Draco had sniffed and added dryly “he’s a bloody Unspeakable, Harry, imagine how boring the dirty talk would be with a guy who can’t
“I love you,” he mouthed silently, but he hoped that somehow Draco heard it anyway.
Harry waited until Draco’s breaths were deep and even, and then he brushed his lips against the shell of his ear.
Ginny looked around as they stood in the doorway, taking in the distressed wood, deliberate peeling paintwork, and exposed bricks and pipes. It
Hermione reached for her wine. The bottle came bobbing out of the kitchenette a moment later, followed by a chipped ceramic mug. She only had the one wineglass, a heavy crystal thing that sparkled when it caught the light, that he knew she’d taken from her parents’ old home when she’d gone back after the War. It had been left on the side of the sink, long since dry, covered in a thin film of dust. She hadn’t been able to find any of the others in the set and later that evening, she, Ron and Harry had tearfully toasted to the hope that the other glasses had made it to Australia, ready for her mother to pour her favourite Sauvignon Blanc into.
And so, when Draco decided he was going to propose to Harry, he knew it had to be special. In the moment when Draco knelt before Harry with the engraved gold ring he'd had made, he wanted Harry to feel all of Draco’s admiration and commitment and love for him. He wanted Harry to know that Draco wanted to grow old with him, that Draco wanted to see him be happy and tired and angry and sleepy in the morning, that Draco wanted all of Harry, and for Harry to have all of him, even the brittle and spiky parts.
The wind was roaring in his ears and he couldn’t hear a thing except the faint screech of the dragon. His hair was whipped around his face, and his skin felt flushed and rosy even though he’d applied super-strength sun screen. But he was smiling so wide his cheeks were hurting, and his stomach swooped every time he changed course on his broomstick, and he felt light and weightless in a way he didn't usually. He glanced up ahead and caught sight of Harry, face alight with laughter as he executed a perfect corkscrew through the air.
“I don’t know, I wasn’t counting!”
is Basil. Say hi to Harry, Basil.”
. That he’d decided to first go and buy Draco’s favourite pastries, the ones guaranteed to put him in a good mood, was completely unrelated.
The morning after their not-quite-argument about stepping out in the wizarding world, Harry had been woken at the crack of dawn by an Owl from the Ministry. Even though it was a Saturday and he wasn’t due to work, he’d reluctantly left a sleeping Draco – so soft and warm in the buttery yellow sunrise – and Apparated back to Grimmauld Place to get changed into his robes. After that, they’d never gone back to the conversation they’d had that night.
“Oh.”
is a little disconcerting,” Harry said as he shifted Basil over to Ron’s lap. “Watch the cat for me, I’m going over to Pansy’s.” He ruffled Ron’s hair. “Thanks for everything, mate.”
“You never did tell me how you ended up with
Harry felt a little disappointed that he’d been brushed off once more, until they stepped outside into the cool April evening and started walking, and Draco spoke again.
Harry swallowed tentatively. “There’s no way Hermione called you devilishly attractive.”
“What- no!” He spluttered. “I need your help picking an outfit for tonight. Nothing looks right! I don’t know if this place is posh or if I should be more casual. And that was
There had been a smile on Hermione’s face when she and Ron were leaving, and when Harry had raised his eyebrows at her she’d given him a tight hug and whispered, “It’s nice to see you interested in something other than work.”
. Even in the darkest moments of the war, when he’d been terrified and close to broken, Draco’d had a burning in his eyes that Harry couldn’t forget.
“Oh, thanks,” Harry had grinned, “but I’m okay. I’m here with friends and it’s my round.”
“Because…I want you to come to Ministry events with me, and I want us to go to Quidditch games together, and have drinks with our friends at the Leaky Cauldron and the Hog’s Head, and- and, have tea at Madam Puddifoot’s—"
Next to him, Ron’s shoulders were shaking silently and Harry viciously hoped it was because he was choking to death on the last piece of bacon. He looked up and caught Hermione’s eye, and she gave him an encouraging smile.
“Nervous?”
“Needed that. Was great.” Harry pressed a soft kiss to Draco’s skin, just at the tip of one of the
“Prat.”
Draco titled his head back so he could look up at him. Harry wasn’t sure what the expression on his face was, but it didn’t look happy at his suggestion. “I don’t want to go back to wizarding London,” Draco said slowly.
Harry had chuckled – he was rather cute, if the line was a little corny – and added the bloke’s drink to his order.
mosquito bites on Draco’s arse and a rather sheepish trip to the food hall to beg the cook for some of her tea tree salve.
With a hand firmly wrapped around his waist, Draco supported a swaying Harry up the stairs and into his room, allowing him to collapse into a heap in the middle of his bed.
Blaise pushed a fruity-looking cocktail at him and reached a hand across where Draco was already elbows-deep into decorative tissue paper. “Hello, Potter.”
Draco’s shifts varied depending on the projects he was working on and Harry’s training was ramping up as they edged ever closer to their Auror examinations, so they didn’t see each other all that often. But if Draco left the house first, there’d usually be a cup of tea – perfectly milky and just the right amount of sweet – under a stasis charm in the kitchen, waiting for a sleepy Harry to descend on it eagerly. Harry, in return, would stop by the bakery off Diagon on the Saturday mornings that they both had off and grab some of the pastries that made Draco moan in ways that should be illegal. (Not that that was the reason he did it.)
“No, of course not,” Harry said. (It was the principle of the thing.) “Don’t you miss it?”
He walked right past the drinks table, setting his empty glass down, and hurried up to his dorm. The room was blissfully cool, the lead-paned windows letting in a slight chill to wash over his heated skin. He huffed out a sigh and quickly tugged his shirt off, grabbing a t-shirt from his wardrobe.
Potter smirked. “Don’t you want me in your bed,
“Yeah, sorry, I didn’t mean to fall asleep on the couch.”
a perfect person for me, there’s no saying they’d be dating or available or what have you. I could end up missing out on a good thing because I waited on nothing.”
It’s a year today – it’s just gone midnight - and Harry’s on his way. I pour a firewhiskey as I wait for him.
Harry burst out laughing, the sheer ridiculousness of it all finally hitting him in one giant, rolling wave. “Oh Merlin, we really are morons.”
When Draco gave a soft moan of pleasure as he tried the dark chocolate mousse they’d decided to share for dessert, Harry had to artfully arrange his napkin over his lap and take a gulp of water. He carried on making small noises of pleasure as he ate, licking the spoon lasciviously and looking at him with hooded eyes, until Harry had felt like he might faint from all his blood rushing south. When he’d finally leaned over and quietly asked if Draco wanted to go back to Grimmauld Place, Draco had immediately dropped his spoon with a clutter and rolled his eyes, muttering, “
he only had all seventeen seasons downloaded on the telly box thing for Pansy’s benefit). He knew ten ways of restraining a suspect that were lawful and a further six ways that most certainly were not. He knew how to brew salves that could fade the scrapes and bruises Teddy would get with his rambunctious play, and potions to settle his stomach, and a spell or two to glamour his blue hair when they went out into muggle London together.
Molly pulled back and reached up to smooth a hand through Harry’s wild curls. “Darling boy. Your hand on the family clock used to point to work more often than it did home. And in the last couple of months that’s changed; you’re happy, so we are too.” She smiled. “You know, when I told my brothers that I was going out with Arthur, they were furious; Arthur’s mother was born a Black before she married Septimus Weasley. My brother Gideon told me that only rotten apples came from the Black family tree.” She gave Harry’s cheek a soft pat. “Merlin knows history’s proven that wrong. And your young Malfoy, he’s a Black too.” She drew back and pulled out her wand, waving it at the remaining dishes and sending them soaring to their rightful places.
“You are hopeless, Potter.”
Harry sighed as he crumpled up the parchment in his hand and tossed Ron’s owl a few treats. He was bone-tired, having gotten home in the early hours of the morning after getting through the mountain of paperwork to finally close his latest case, a counterfeit potions ring in East Anglia. In the two months since he started dating Draco, he found his enthusiasm for overtime and investigating crimes up and down the country had waned dramatically; gone was the fervent desire to be constantly active, to heal through hard work, and keep his mind occupied with finding the patterns and connections and salient details in cases. Now, he wanted to spend his time with Draco; and not just because he fancied the pants off him (literally), but because he liked listening to him talk about the different customers that came in to his shop, and he liked how Draco would sometimes smile so widely it would bring out the dimple in his cheek, and he liked how Draco’s eyes would gleam when he spoke about Leonie, a squib who was using his shop after-hours as a space for other wizard-borns to meet and talk and learn about Muggle magics.
Harry quirked his mouth up despite the heavy feeling in his chest. Molly’s lemon drizzle cake was a cheat day staple, and always featured the day after the dreaded weekly five-mile run to remind them there was goodness in the world.
“He made me realise what an absolute prat I was being.” Draco looked down at his hands. “Told me that I’d spent the last three months caring more about your reaction to my wedding than about the event itself, and that no man would – and I quote –
“You’ve known him since you were eleven. And Ron and I got married young-”
Harry shrugged. "Just bumped into him in Muggle London."
“Half a mile to go.”
Harry’s hangover had melted away – thanks to a hangover potion and a coffee chaser – by the time he joined Draco at the kitchen table, grinning a little sheepishly.
Harry watched as Draco went through some sort of internal conflict. His self-control, ingrained from his pureblood, aristocratic upbringing, was unable to hide the slight tightening of his jaw, the almost-imperceptible frown between his eyes as his mind worked.
“Harry James Potter, I did
Harry had woken in the early afternoon with a groggy head and three owls of various sizes on his windowsill, each waiting patiently atop a parcel. A fourth owl, a small fluffy white thing, hovered in the air with a small pouch tied to its leg. After relieving the owls of their cargo and downing half a vial of hangover potion, Harry sat down to examine his deliveries with a cup of coffee and an apple turnover from the small café down the street.
it – I knocked it off the mantle with my elbow and you just happened to be the last person I called so it just auto-redialled since I got that stupid fancy Floo set up- anyway, that’s not important!” Harry’s face felt so red he thought it was going to melt off his skull. He reached behind him into his bedroom and grabbed an armful of clothes, which he flung through the fire onto the waxed hardwood floors of Hermione’s flat.
Hermione nodded. “Listed buildings have their own protections from things like enlargement charms, they have since the Statute of Secrecy was put into effect,” she said when she caught Ron’s puzzled look.
Harry pressed another kiss to Draco’s forehead, breathing in the smell of sleepy warmth and musky morning skin and the lavender pillow spray Draco liked to use every night, the ridiculous prat.
“Really?
“The Falcons though,” Draco mused, “that’s rather impressive. Perfect team for Flint, I’d say. Isn’t their motto ‘Let us win, but if we cannot win, let us break a few heads’?”
“Did you guys hear that Angelina Johnson and Lee Jordan got engaged?” Hermione asked, taking a sip of her Gillywater and lime.
As his and Draco’s relationship got more serious, the appeal of shiftwork and overtime and going away on missions and nights spent healing in St. Mungo’s started to wear thin. Even when they weren’t working, there just never seemed to be enough
, until the novelty wore off with each fresh cup that he drank and Draco started to dread the sweet, cloying taste. Despite the gallons of tea and the sweets and the leaves that he chewed slowly as he walked, Harry was still feeling weak and light-headed. He ambled at a slow pace, taking frequent breaks to gasp in shallow breaths and close his eyes, allowing Draco to (somewhat guiltily) enjoy the breathtaking surroundings.
“Excuse me,” Draco muttered as he extricated himself from the couch as gracefully as he could, feeling light-headed. “I need a drink.” He swept his gaze quickly over Harry’s face and imagined he saw a flicker of disappointment.
There were lots of things that Draco Malfoy knew. He knew, for example, that there were still people that were wary of him, even after a decade spent serving the wizarding public as an Auror. He knew that when Pansy and Ginny were fighting - about once a month in their fiery relationship - nothing could cheer his best friend up like a sundae from Fortescue’s and an afternoon spent watching that ridiculous muggle TV show where they ferociously judged what other muggles wore (and yes,
Ron’s eyes lit up, and Harry caught Hermione good-naturedly shaking her head at his enthusiasm. “Lead on, then” he said, and when Blaise stood up to join him, Ron threw an arm around his shoulders.
I didn't get to write as much of this as I wanted but posting anyway or I never will. I've hit a bit of a roadblock with it - I have an ending but not too sure yet how I'm getting there!
let one of those shots go down the wrong way. Pretty sure I just singed off all my nose hairs. Anyway, let’s meet up tomorrow for a coffee and talk strategy. We have a man to marry.”
Potter looked like he was trying to hold back a smile. “I thought you’d have loved to see me beg.”
Draco grinned. “No, you're right. She offered me a homemade scone and I think she meant it as a threat this time.” He reached out and twined his fingers with Harry’s. “I spoke to Astoria this morning and we agreed to nullify the contract. She seemed quite relieved if I’m honest, said that
, the dramatic prat.”). On Hermione’s recommendation, he’d booked a table for two at an intimate French restaurant in Belgravia for the following week, and whiled away the morning talking with his friends and composing the perfect reply to Draco, tactfully disregarding every single suggestion Ron made. (Although he couldn’t help but grin when he imagined how Draco might react to
Draco had re-entered his life a couple of years later, when Gringotts had taken the Malfoy heir on to work alongside Bill as a Curse-Breaker in London, sub-contracted to the Ministry of Magic. It appeared that his

“Don’t blame you, Harry, I hate to objectify him but when Draco wears those grey jeans, I also get a bit…distracted.”
his gaze, slow and heavy like treacle. Draco automatically turned his left arm, shielding his Mark from view.
For their five-year anniversary, Harry and Draco booked a holiday. They’d pored over Draco’s list of places he wanted to visit, debating the merits of each, until they’d settled on Peru: Harry wanted to do the Inca Trail and Draco was keen to visit the Peruvian Amazon to see some of the rare and intriguing flora and fauna. He also wanted to squeeze in a visit to see the Nazca lines, having read an interesting article in The Astronomer’s Anthology about the geoglyphs.
Draco nodded, dropping his hands from where they’d twined in Harry’s hair. “Yes, that's probably best.”
“Well, tell us all about her!” Molly grinned.
The table drinks had been replenished a couple of times, and the forced politeness between his friends and Draco’s had relaxed with each new cocktail consumed. It helped that Hermione and Parkinson were already close; before long, Ginny had enquired where Pansy’s lipstick had been purchased, and then Pansy had pulled the tube out from where she’d wedged it in her cleavage. (“Undetectable extension charm,” she’d winked at Harry; he had almost inhaled his cocktail umbrella by accident.) Now Hermione, Ginny and Pansy all wore that same shade of purple-red, their teeth flashing even whiter as they giggled in the corner.
? Are you an absolute masochist?”
“Oh, not to worry,” she said warmly, “you’re here now. I hope you’re hungry.” She gave another smile when Draco nodded faintly, and then turned to the table and yelled for everyone to take a seat.
pieces of Chudley Cannons paraphernalia he’d received from Ron over the years, despite being a vocal and unwavering Puddlemere United fan, and tried to suppress his wince.
Seamus nodded. “I think I agree with you there, Draco. Dean was really keen on the idea a couple of years ago, especially as the wizarding world is far more accepting of gay relationships and marriages than Muggles are. But after we talked it through, we realised we liked things as they were and a piece of paper wasn’t going to make us feel any different.”
fucking perfect. Draco’s mouth was hot and insistent, and when he opened up to let Harry lick inside, it tasted both sweet and sharp. Harry swallowed a groan and stepped forward, pushing Draco into the hallway and crowding him up against the wall, one leg between his, never breaking the kiss. He dimly recognised the sound of the door clicking shut in the background. He felt feverish, his blood fizzing beneath his skin, ready to combust. As he kissed down Draco's neck, his mind raced with wild, jumbled thoughts like
to get married. Not that he didn’t
When he slipped in under the sheets a moment later, Draco rolled over and groped behind him for Harry’s hand, dragging it over his body until Harry was spooning close around him.
“Fucksake,” Harry growled as he threw the magazine across the room. Basil shot out from beneath the coffee table when the Witch Weekly burst into confetti as it hit the wall, chasing the pieces of paper around the room with a joyous chirp. “Why would they even write something like that? He’s fucking gorgeous.”
He nipped at Harry’s hipbone, earning a chuckle, before he leaned down and mouthed along Harry’s prick, laving the hot, velvety skin all the way down to the base and then back up to the thick head. He tasted the slightly bitter tang of pre-come as he licked at the slit, before opening his mouth and swallowing down a good five inches of Harry’s cock in one go.
Harry grinned as he stepped up to Draco and placed a hand on his waist. It was meant to be a sexy, intimate gesture, and perhaps it might have been, had it not been somewhat mistimed: Draco, lifting the wine glass to his lips, startled when he felt Harry’s touch and sent the majority of his drink all over his white shirt. It soaked down from the edge of the collar to where his nipple was pebbled, the wine dark and purplish like a bruise.

Harry pushed him with a laugh. “You’re such a prat.” Then he pulled him onto his lap and shoved his nose into the juncture where neck met shoulder, the scent of bergamot and citrus and musk filling the hollow in his chest until Harry felt like he might burst from happiness. He mouthed at the soft skin, the very tip of his tongue drawling swirls that made Draco sigh breathily and press a kiss to his cheek.
Three months had passed quickly, and Harry had found it increasingly difficult to stomach any wedding chat. Ron, on the other hand, was full of advice, having been a groomsman at Bill, Percy and George’s weddings. Harry wasn’t sure what his issue really was; he just knew it was wrong for Draco to tie himself to someone forever just to please his mother. Harry spent January and February telling himself and anyone who asked that he was just concerned about his friend. By the end of February, however, he’d realised that what he felt for Draco was perhaps a little friendlier than was typical. And when Ron – who was steadily working his way through another pint as Harry ranted yet
“Bathroom?” he asked Draco instead.
“Marryin’ Draco.”
Draco took a sip of his wine. “It’s funny, I was pretty much raised to think I’d be married straight out of Hogwarts and expected to produce an heir as soon as possible to

His smile is everything.
Ginny really was quite graceful, even when shoved to the floor.

Harry chuckled. “Are you ever going to call me Harry?” he asked as he stood, watching Draco scoot under the covers.

Draco tutted and ignored the question. "Why haven't you cast a Drying Charm, Potter? You're creating a health and safety issue."
“We are, but I don’t see why you’re on my bed,
Draco shook his head. “No, I- just need a bit of-.” He cut off, running his fingers through his shoulder-length hair and rubbing the back of his nape distractedly. “Just need some space today.”
As everyone settled into eating, the conversation meandered through Ginny’s latest tour with the Hollyhead Harpies, Bill’s work strengthening some alarm hexes at Gringotts – at this he fixed Harry with a wry grin and informed him the goblins sent their regards – and Hermione’s thoughts on the Ministry’s latest educational reforms which included a host of Muggle and wizarding arts programmes at Hogwarts. She told them that it was Dean Thomas, who Harry didn’t see that often anymore now that he and Seamus lived in Hogsmeade, who had led the way for a dedicated Art and Design OWL, teaching Muggle art history and techniques as well as the magic behind animating wizarding paintings and sculptures. Hermione had tactfully sidestepped Molly’s wistful comment about how lovely it was that Dean and Seamus had stayed together all these years after meeting at school, responding innocently that hadn't Ron recently been out with none other than Lavender Brown, his very first girlfriend at school? Ron had spluttered as his mother seized on the information, giving Hermione a very un-gentlemanly middle finger salute when Molly’s gaze was turned.
“You ready, love? We need to leave now.”
After a night in the Leaky, where Seamus had joined them, bursting with pride about Dean’s new jewellery shop in Diagon Alley and how he was finally
Harry burst out laughing. “Merlin, I love you.”
Harry chuckled. Though Draco had beautiful hands, with long tapered fingers and perfect, square nails, the ring had still needed to be substantially widened to fit him and was now closer to his father’s in size.
The third box contained some fancy cologne that he blearily remembered Ron saying would make Draco smell like Harry’s favourite things. A quick look at the ingredients confirmed that it did indeed contain Amortentia and Harry, with the practiced ease of a Quidditch player, lobbed it over his head and straight into the bin. As much as he liked treacle tart, he didn’t really want Draco smelling of it; especially not if it accidentally gave him a boner – his birthday dinners at the Burrow would be ruined forever.
“Where were you tonight?” Potter asks, his voice low and gravelly. “I missed you.”
“Yeah.” Draco put the kettle on. “It feels like I’m – well, not making amends, because I don’t think I can ever make up for what I did – but I’m helping. Doing my bit towards getting rid of any lasting reminders of Voldermort.”
“Because it’s going to be a room full of Gryffindors and Slytherins and that’s never a good idea.”
brought that upon yourself.”
Harry had spent the following year renovating Grimmauld Place, before he and Ron started the Auror training programme. He’d seen a Mind Healer, finding it helpful to talk to someone other than Hermione and Ron, someone who could tell him – from a professional point of view – that the broken pieces inside of him could be healed. When he felt more stable, he’d begun to date a few blokes, having admitted to himself and his friends that he liked them just as much as he liked women. A photo of him kissing Justin Finch-Fletchley led to a media storm and a few nasty articles from the Prophet; a printed apology followed swiftly when Harry’s call for a
Draco’s blinding grin was everything.
Harry grinned. Outside, the sun broke through the clouds.
They spoke to Robards and wrangled a month off; Andromeda, Teddy, Ron and Hermione saw them to the International Portkey Office, where they were to catch the 7.14pm to Lima. They arrived with plenty of time to spare, so Harry took Teddy off to grab some hot chocolate while Ron bought a round of Pumpkin Pasties from the welcome witch in the waiting room.
What’s in your hand?”
Draco leaned back. “Er, well, I didn’t mean
“Yes?”
“Harry, dear!” Molly bustled up to him as he stepped out of the Floo, thrusting a pile of plates in his hands and smacking a kiss to his forehead. “Here, we’re eating in the garden today. Can you get these out to the table, love, and I’ll grab the bacon.”
“But…it’s
Just a little update - I am posting this now in the hope that it will encourage me to finish this soon!
“Thanks for walking me back,” Draco said with a half-smile. He pulled out a set of keys and opened a door at the side of the main entrance to the shop. A quick flick of a switch illuminated a long hallway that led to the same steps at the back that Harry had spotted when he’d first been in the bookshop. Draco stepped inside and turned around. “I did get your letters, you know. I still have them. I just didn’t know what to write back...My mother needed me and, to be frank, I wasn’t quite sure where we stood. I’m sorry if I…well, it was rude and I apologise.”
There was an inset photo of Harry with his friend Euan from a few months ago; in it, Harry was laughing uproariously at something Euan had said, before being pulled into a one-armed hug. Harry felt a current of anger shoot through him as he realised how the photo had been taken out of context. Draco had in fact been just on the other side of Euan that night, deep in conversation with Euan’s girlfriend Hannah.
“While I thoroughly approve of getting completely trolleyed whenever one feels like it,” Draco said wryly, “I am compelled to ask, as your partner and friend, if you’re alright
to hold and look after and love.
Harry walked over to the armchair by the fireplace, grabbing the thick Aran blanket that Draco had stylishly flung there when he moved in. As he draped it over Draco, Harry took in the slackness of his face in sleep and the darkness under his eyes. He felt a wash of tenderness that had him biting his lip to keep from doing something stupid, like kissing Draco’s forehead or smoothing a hand through his shimmering hair. He grabbed Draco's cloak to hang up, knowing how irked he'd be if he woke up to find it wrinkled and creased, remembering to avoid the creaky floorboard outside the room.
“Yes. Wait, where’re you goin’?”
Harry had sat in delicious tension as their waiter cleaned up their plates and brought over the bill; he left so much money on the table in his haste to leave that Draco would later refer to the date as “the time Harry tried to impress me by leaving our waiter an eighty per cent tip.” He pulled Draco into a small quiet alley, almost drunk on the scent of bergamot and citrus and musky male skin as Draco wound his arms around his neck and kissed him deeply. He Apparated them straight to his bedroom, feeling the
“Coffee?”
bounced off the wainscoted walls. It was almost 5am and Draco would be getting up in a couple of hours to get ready for work; he owned a small bookshop in Muggle London, carrying all manner of old and dusty tomes that had Hermione positively vibrating with joy whenever she visited. It stayed open until around seven every night except Sundays, when Draco took a day off, so Harry hated waking him too early when he came home.
He examined it for a moment before he returned to the letter. He read the words, written on thick parchment in an elegant looping hand that he’d know anywhere, and chuckled softly.
Thanks in advance for reading, I hope you enjoy it. There'll be another update soon (promise!) xx
Harry stilled.
“You continuing to say
Indeed, there they were: the replies he’d never received, bundled together at the back.
"Right, Har, I'm off," Ron announced, throwing his red Auror robes haphazardly over his chair.
Sirius’ own personal vault). As well as Grimmauld Place, he also owned the ruins of the cottage at Godric’s Hollow and a plot of land on the outskirts of the village that had once belonged to the Peverells; a crumbling manor in Gloucestershire that had belonged to the first Potter, Linfred of Stinchcombe; a Black family home nestled on the banks of the Dordogne in Bergerac…on and on the list had gone until Harry had seen, listed inconspicuously under ‘Miscellaneous’, his parents’ wedding rings.
“Hello,” he mumbled, looking Harry over confusedly. He sat up slowly, moving a little gingerly.
Harry couldn’t help snorting at the unintended innuendo, but his laughter died off quickly when he realised Draco hadn’t found that quite as funny as he did. “Well, I’m sure you’ll get the stain out in no time when you get home.”
“I thought you said this bar was new?”
I walk to the door, still smarting. We’ve been having sex exclusively for a year, a year tonight, and hanging out at the pub after work, and brushing our teeth side by side in the morning when I stay the night. Didn’t that make us boyfriends?
“I love you too,” Harry smiled.
.” “Are you seriously surprised?!”).
They chuckled and then Hermione looked back over at him, twirling the stem of her wineglass lightly between her fingers. “So, falling in love?”
Draco chuckled and tilted his head to give Harry better access, feeling his cock starting to thicken and press against his trousers. He ran his hand down Harry’s back, fingers dipping beneath the waistband of his shorts and gripping a handful of his gorgeous arse.
Harry set his drink down with a dull thud as his temper spiked again. “Speak for yourself,” he said. “You’re the one that almost took my head off over an accident.”
Harry refused to acknowledge how his heart sunk a little.
They may not have been on brooms, but Harry was quick enough on his feet, and he led Draco on a merry race around the garden and into the grass past the gate.
“This isn’t my first rodeo, Malfoy.”
. And that it would be a disservice to us both if I went ahead with the wedding.
“Wear these. Pans said the bar is smart casual so this’ll do.” She waved her wand at the rest of clothing on the floor, which scrambled to right itself into a neat stack. “And maybe this too,” she added with a smirk as she retrieved a small, stringy bundle from the top of the pile. With horror, Harry realised it was a jock strap. He rushed to get up, almost spilling the last of his wine, as Hermione giggled.
Draco knocked his fourth Firewhisky back and blew a smoke ring lazily. He fervently hoped it would keep the headache in his left temple at bay. His cheeks felt flushed from the combination of all the people crammed into the common room and the several drinks he’d consumed. It wasn’t that he was
“That’s quite alright, it’s your couch too.” Harry took in Draco’s puffy eyes, still a little shadowed, and a scruff of stubble along his jaw just a shade darker than his hair. He swallowed.
. I was avoiding a serious unrequited crush. It was starting to hurt, the stale smile I had to wear each time Harry told me about a date he went on, endlessly chattering about the food he’d eaten, or whether there’d been a kiss at the end. The only saving grace had been that Harry’s dates mostly ended with a platonic parting of ways.
Harry chuckled. “He took dedication to a whole new level for sure.”
Harry’s train of daydreams was interrupted when Hermione said, “Draco, can’t you enlarge this room in any way?”
“You know what I mean.”
Harry felt a little tug in his chest as he closed the letter back up. He placed it with the others and slid the whole lot into his bedside drawer. A part of him wanted to keep reading, to devour all of the other letters Draco had decided to finally share with him, but he had an overwhelming urge to gather his boyfriend close. Whatever worries had been flitting around Harry's mind all day evaporated as he slid over to spoon behind Draco, who made a muffled noise and snuggled in closer until they were pressed tight to each other. He was surrounded by the warmth of Draco’s skin, legs tangled together, the delicious, faint friction of his cock pressed snugly to Draco's arse.
Harry carefully pulled two strands of the barrier spell open and climbed into the bed. When Draco followed suit, he felt sparks on his skin where the spell touched him.
They were out in the garden again, enjoying the late July sunshine. Bill and Fleur were chatting with Ginny and Neville near the Rollicking Roses, which were singing an off-tune rendition of ‘Happy Birthday’ on repeat, while Hermione and Arthur sat in conversation a little further down the table from him. Molly was bustling around, somehow still bringing yet more food out from the kitchen, the table groaning as she rearranged plates and adjusted Statis charms.
Harry had felt like an eleven-year-old all over again as he realised just how
“Yeah, about that,” Ron added. “Although wasn’t this Lee’s third proposal?”
He’d stomped off then, leaving Harry somewhat speechless on the sofa; they hadn’t spoken again beyond polite, work-related chat until the usual team drinks at the Leaky, where Harry slid Draco a glass of the pub’s most expensive Elvish wine in apology and Draco had given his shoulder a little squeeze in acceptance.
“Can I come in?”
Dinner had been perfect; unlike their first date, they’d chatted comfortably and easily from the start, Harry revelling in the way Draco would wave his forkful of food around as if to punctuate his precise, crystal-cut words. They'd shared a bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape that perfectly complimented the smoky coq au vin, and made Draco’s face flush in a beautiful way.
“Made sense to have him move in with me. There’s a whole floor that I don’t even use.” Harry felt a soft vibration against his thigh, where his wand was holstered.
“Harry,” Draco had said quietly after realising his incorrect answers were going un-ridiculed. “Tell me what’s wrong.”
His best friend shrugged. “If Hermione asks, I only had one slice of cake, yeah?”
Harry had settled on the other end of the sofa and unconsciously pulled Draco’s foot into his lap, earning him a slightly raised eyebrow and a small grin that showed off that ridiculous dimple in Draco’s right cheek. And Harry’s heart started beating a mile a minute because in that second, as Draco smiled at him warmly and went back to reading, Harry wanted – with an intensity that burned - to reach over, knock the book from Draco’s hands and devour him in a bruising, claiming kiss. He wanted this to be more than friendship, much
I think there will be about five or so more updates (not really chapters), based on the outline I've got. As ever, thanks for reading!
“I think Draco’s mad at me,” he said after a moment. “Because of what I said last night about marriage and that. He went to Pansy’s because he needed some space.”
He spun around and took in all six foot two of Draco Malfoy coming around the counter, a stack of books under one arm. He was long and lean and - dear Merlin -
One week, Draco was absent from pub night and when Harry asked Pansy where he was, he ended up being subjected to an hour-long discussion about Draco’s dinner date with the
“What about work?”
There’d been a story tucked away on page nine of the Prophet the next morning, accompanied by a picture of the four of them laughing. Harry had read it with a frown, worried it would be vicious and cruel, but the article had been fairly neutral and even touched positively on Draco’s role as a Curse-Breaker. In fact, the only thing that had caused Harry any concern was the way his photo-self’s eyes lingered just a second too long on a smiling Draco.
Draco rolled his eyes. “No.” He drank a tiny bit of his replacement wine, which Harry took to be a good sign that the date wasn’t over yet.
Hermione put her wine down and walked over him, ruffling her fingers through his wild curls like she used to when they were younger. “I’m glad.”
we can’t do in muggle London,” Harry countered. “We can’t go flying, for one.”
and walked back to the Gryffindor common room, his stomach in knots and his heart flying against his chest.
in nothing fancier than jeans and a t-shirt, blonde hair catching sparks in the sunlight that filtered through the window. He was chewing on his plump bottom lip, his eyes unfocused as he churned something over in his mind. His right index finger was tapping lightly on the spot where his Mark was dissected by the stark white scar of the burning curse he’d saved Bill from years ago.
Despite the challenges, there had been a few moments already where Draco almost blurted The Question out: when he’d spotted the sheer joy and incredulity on Harry’s face as they looked out on the ancient ruins of Patallaqta, the sun cocooning them in a haze of warmth; when they entered cloud forest and spied hummingbirds flitting through the trees like tiny colourful Snitches; when they snuggled together in their tent, achy legs tangled…but none of them had felt like
“Harry fucking Potter, you come back here!”
"Nope."
“Hmmm, I don’t think so. Apparently, he said the bloke was an incredible kisser. Harry? Where are you going?”
They’d managed to get the smell of burning out of the kitchen with a host of Molly’s high-strength cleaning spells, although there was still the odd whiff of it every once in a while. Draco had not been best pleased when the walls that he had painstakingly painted a soft, French grey (
Draco laughed. “So keen.”
. When Arthur enquired kindly as to where Draco had been for the last three years, and whether he saw anyone from the wizarding world, he certainly didn’t expect Hermione to chime in, telling Arthur that her fellow Unspeakable Pansy Parkinson ventured out to Muggle London to see Draco occasionally, along with Blaise and Greg. (Harry had blurted out
best friends. “I know what you mean, mate. And thanks.” He clapped Ron on the shoulder and gestured to his front door. “Coming in for a cuppa? Draco might even be home.”
“Hermione you didn’t raise-”
Ron beamed. “Perfect way to pop the question if you ask me. Tell him he looks fit in those grey jeans he likes to wear then get down on one knee.”
They’d been walking back from the library the night before their first exam, ribbons of moonlight falling through the large lead-paned windows that looked out onto the grounds. They paused at the turning down to the dungeons, Draco’s face flooded white and silver as he said goodnight with an easy smile. Harry had stood there, looking at Draco with his marble skin and his liquid eyes and his
In fact, Ron, I reckon Draco might be my pass.”
The ring box in his trouser pocket bounced lightly against his leg. He’d taken to carrying it around all the time under a concealment charm, finding the slight weight of it somewhat reassuring. When he’d gone to Pansy’s the day the Witch Weekly article came out, he hadn’t felt right asking Draco The Question when he was feeling so low. He had instead focused on reminding Draco that he was absolutely
“Harry, I-.” Draco stopped abruptly. “Oh.”
“Night, Harry,” Draco whispered as he closed his eyes. In the darkness, he allowed himself a brilliant smile.
He could be forgiven for forgetting to propose after that.
It took a second, but when Draco gave a small smile in return, it made Harry’s heart sing softly. “Okay. Harry. And this isn’t the
“If I recall correctly, you
“That’s a shame,” Draco mumbled. Harry’s heart tripped before Draco continued quickly, “for the readers of Witch Weekly I mean. Britain’s Most Eligible Batchelor another year running and he doesn’t want to date.”
“That boy threw over that ridiculously hot barista for you. That’s commitment enough, I’d say.”
“Yeah?”
They dressed quickly (or, at least, he did; Harry stumbled through pulling on his clothing with his eyes half-closed) and packed up their bags, walking out into the blackness of pre-dawn. Draco cast a furtive spell to collapse their tent down into a light, compact bundle under the guise of pulling out the poles and pegs. Francis came over to them, rubbing his hands together to warm them up in the frigid cold of early morning.
“No! No. I just-.” Again, he stopped abruptly, so at odds with his usual verbosity. Draco sighed. “I’ll see you tonight, Harry.” He quirked his mouth slightly, and leaned down to run a hand over Harry’s jaw, pressing a featherlight kiss into Harry’s hair.
“You smell like a pub,” Draco sniffed after a minute. “You need a sobering potion and a long shower. Then I reckon we should grab some Chinese and have a Jeopardy! marathon. I’m in the mood for chow mein and a snuggle.”
“Harry?” It came out as a whisper. “Will you marry me?”
“Yes! Why wouldn’t I be? Everything’s fine!”
“Am I hurting you?”
, Malfoy,” Harry growled. He really wished he could raise one eyebrow slowly.
In short, he wanted it to be absolutely perfect.
“Oh, right, yeah. Are you going to have another date with that barista?”
They said goodbye to Ginny, Neville and Goyle outside the bar a few hours later, everyone exchanging smiles that were far more relaxed than Harry might have thought possible. Hermione had tipsily suggested they carry on, and then Pansy had volunteered Draco’s flat as the next stop. Blaise and Ron walked arm in arm ahead of everyone else as they led the way to the bus stop. They arrived just in time to get on the 205 towards Warren Street, where the six of them had the top deck all to themselves the whole way.
“Thank you, love, I needed that,” Draco mumbled, his voice muffled somewhat by the pillow he had shoved under his face.
Harry thought with a nod,
It had seemed so impossible once, that he and Draco would be anything more than enemies, and later, roommates. But this heavy flooding in his chest was love, Harry knew. This aching desire to simultaneously be over there, wrapped around Draco, with his bright socks and his bright hair and his bright eyes, and also right here, watching him in his element, drinking in all his sharp edges and the soft spaces in between
Grey eyes met green and Harry realised just how close they were sitting. He could see the different colours in Draco’s eyelashes, the fine lines under his eyes from late nights, the ridiculously smooth quality of the skin on his cheeks and the way his deep grey eyes were shot through with silver swirls. It almost seemed like Draco was leaning in ever so slightly. Harry felt a puff of breath ghost over his cheek and he licked his lips, Draco’s eyes flicking down to look-
time by the way and it was an accident!”
“Of course they did. Because they’re my family, and they know you’re important to me.” Harry took a moment to shore up some nerve. He didn’t want to ruin this fragile moment, but he wanted to make sure Draco understood. “The people who matter to me won’t take issue with you, Draco, or with
Blaise laughed but he released Harry’s hand and then looked over to where Ron, Ginny and Neville hovered somewhat awkwardly across the table. Well, Ron and Neville looked awkward; Ginny was busy lining up her preferred selection of drinks. It seemed she was really planning to paint the town red. (And yellow and orange and – most worryingly – neon green with thin line of electric blue salt around the rim.)
worst date (“He was like a Devil’s Snare, only not as polite with the grabbing”), which made him chuckle and spurred a competition to tell their worst dating stories.  Harry filled Draco in on the less glamourous reality of being an Auror (“and then this fucking demon kneazle comes shooting out of the chimney, claws-first, and I swear to Merlin-
“It has,” Harry replied, swallowing heavily. “But…”
Draco was spared the need to answer when Teddy bounded out of the kitchen, a pastry squished to a pulp in one small fist. He stopped when he saw Harry on the floor, the ring box still held aloft.
The Prophet had, of course, speculated extensively on the Ministry's decision to allow an ex-Death Eater access to Dark objects. Ten months later, it was reported that, while examining a music box found during a raid on a suspected Death Eater safe house in West Sussex, Draco Malfoy had thrown a well-timed
Had Harry scared Draco with his talk about marriage and commitment and choices for life? Enough for him to need
Their friends had been happy (“About sodding time,” Ginny’d shouted before forcing them all the do a round of shots to celebrate the end of all that UST). Within a couple of weeks, a photo of them sharing a sweet kiss outside the Leaky made the front page of the Prophet. Draco’d handed him the paper on his way out to work the next day, taking two steps into the hall before whirling back around and pulling Harry into a searing kiss. He’d nipped and sucked his way down Harry’s neck, his hand reaching around to grab Harry’s arse as he whispered fervently, “I haven’t read it. I don’t care what it says. You are
“Why do we do this to ourselves?” he gasped, doing an excellent impression of a crup in labour. His vision charm was starting to fade, a slight blur settling over the sight of London in the distance. Ron, whose fair skin had turned a frankly worrying shade of red, merely panted in response and leaned back against the doorway, sweat running down his temples and dripping off the tip of his long nose.
Draco looked up, straight into the ridiculously green eyes of Harry Potter. Adorably rumpled, somewhat drunk Harry Potter. Stupid Chosen Prat Harry Potter. Unrequited love of his life Harry Potter. Draco felt his mouth go dry as he took in wild black curls and a full, soft mouth and
Draco sighed, extricating himself from Harry’s hold, and sat up.
Hermione would be able to use the word ‘initiative’ as if she hadn’t just drunk her weight in Te-killa Sunrises.)
Draco shrugged. “Hazard of the job. At least I’ve got a couple of weeks off now.”
Wide grey eyes flew up to his own and before he could say anything else, Draco bent down to grab his book and left the room with a softly snide, “put some clothes on, Harry, it’s not a Witch Weekly photoshoot.”
Draco reached over and ran a finger across the rings. “No offence Harry, but your mother had rather…
His friends weren’t completely unused to venturing out in Muggle London, but they did still look like fish out of water as they followed Harry into the dimly lit, rather crowded bar. Ron pointed towards the back, where Harry could just see Hermione’s wild cloud of hair. Weaving in and out of people, trying not to knock anyone with his proliferation of gift bags, he led the way over to where the rest of the party sat on high stools grouped around a few small, impractical tables crowded with drinks. The music was dulled somewhat in this area and Harry wondered if it was because of a furtively-placed charm or just well-chosen seating.
This is the last time, I tell myself. Tonight, I’m going to tell him I can’t go on with this
“Hello little hellion,” Draco said affectionately. “Did you actually miss me or is this just a show in an attempt to get presents?”
“Draco?” I ask softly.
He led them to the third cabin, a wooden hut with a roof that appeared to be made from woven palm fronds, and two hammocks strung up above the small deck outside.
Blaise grinned. “I’m more in the market for a wingman than a boyfriend,” he clarified.
On the first day of their eighth year at Hogwarts, Draco had stopped Harry in the courtyard to deliver a quiet apology to somewhere in the vicinity of Harry’s shoes and thank him for speaking at his trial.
“That sound pretty perfect,” Potter smiled.
He shuffled over to lean back against the armchair Pansy had vacated. “I’m just nervous, I think.”
“Ah, so you do remember.” Harry frowned. “Besides, it not that long ago.”
“Uncle Draco, you should say yes so I can have ice cream.”
Harry gave up trying to grab the Ogden’s and slumped down further on the sofa, trying to avoid staring at the way Draco stood with one hip cocked, the sleeves of his soft ice-blue button-down pushed up his strong, pale forearms.
Between one breath and the next, Harry fell asleep
“Ow! Lay off. Draco wants to be with you forever, he said so himself. So, I think we need to romance him a bit.”
“Is?”
There’d been a lot of dancing; energetic jumping as a group, lusty one-on-one grinding with Draco, and even an impromptu macarena when someone had – ironically, no doubt – requested the Carlito Flores track. When the song had come to a sweaty end, they’d left Blaise and Ron to work their charm on the small dancefloor and returned to the muffled area they’d claimed at the back.
Harry chuckled. “Depends on what Uncle Draco says, Ted.”
“Goodnight Harry,” he responds. “You can see yourself out?” It’s not unkind, but it cuts pretty deep anyway.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. “Are you
“They went on
“It’s a him.” Harry took a deep breath. “He’s a wizard but he owns a bookshop in Muggle London. He’s gorgeous, and so funny, and he makes really good pasta, and he has a white cat called Mabel who’s got one blue eye and one yellow eye.” Ginny grinned at him across the table, the sunshine throwing golden sparks through her fiery hair. “I really
“What are we doing?” he had gasped, running a hand over his mouth and rubbing his jaw distractedly. Harry felt an urge to crawl over to him and lick and bite and nuzzle that stupid perfect jaw. “We’re friends! We’re partners.
Harry frowned. “So, what, we’re never going on a date in wizarding London?”
On the Wednesday, Harry had realised that he probably needed to buy Draco a present. The day had started off fairly relaxed: it was a day off from work after all, so his shoulders had automatically dropped and the frown line he noticed between his brows was softened with the knowledge that crime was being fought by someone else for a day. He’d set off for Diagon Alley early in the morning, scouring the shops for something suitable, getting increasingly sweaty as the late May heatwave hit its peak around lunch. He’d returned home, wilted, worried and woefully empty-handed, a few hours later. Ron was once again treated to the sight of his best friend’s mildly troubled face floating in his Floo. He had come through to Grimmauld Place with a conciliatory bottle of Ogden’s and some of Molly’s leftover shepherd’s pie, determined to help.
Harry rolled his eyes, just as he spotted Hermione by the Exit Floos. "I got caught wandless in a rainstorm and ducked into the bookshop he owns. We had a chat and I asked him out. No stalking involved, promise."
“You fucked my brains out, Harry. I couldn’t hold a conversation right now if I tried.”
Draco looked up from where he lay on the sofa in the front room, a black furry ball curled up on his chest. In fact, Harry’s first thought when he stepped out of the Floo was that he’d gone and bought a new cushion, until the furry thing moved, tail swishing about just once before settling back onto Draco’s chest.
“Okay, Draco, look,” Harry cut in, finally unable to hold his feelings back anymore. “I know we’re friends, and I should be happy for you, that you’ve found this great bloke, but I need to tell you something because I don’t think I can stand it anymore.” He took a breath. “I think I’ve fallen in love with you. Well, not think – I
“Thank you for coming,” Harry said quietly. “It wouldn’t have been the same without you.”
“And then some.”
They’d said goodbye to Francis, Luna, Neville and Ernie back in Cusco after a hearty meal and a well-earned beer together in Aguas Calientes, the small touristy town at the bottom of Machu Picchu (“Are you telling me we could have just got a bus up there?!” Harry had half-laughed, half-huffed). Their new guide was Victor, a tall and striking wizard who worked at the magical reservation they were going to be staying in for the week. He clearly had an affinity for animals, having already pointed out a small, feathered lizard that flicked out an electric blue tongue in greeting, and a butterfly that changed colour to blend into its surrounding like a chameleon – and that was just at the Portkey office.
Harry turned to Draco so fast he felt his neck crack. “What?”
as a couple. He knew, deep in his bones, that this was a once-in-a-lifetime feeling and he wanted to hold onto it forever. And, because of that, he was going to ask the prat to marry him.
“I’m asking Uncle Draco to marry me, Ted.”
“Stay with me, at Grimmauld Place.” Harry cleared his throat. “Since Ron and Hermione moved out, there’s basically a whole floor free. We did the place up really nice. It’s got a much less evil vibe these days. Although, I won’t lie, there is a ghoul that sometimes ends up sticking in the pipes so hot water can be temperamental.” Harry realised he was rambling and promptly pursed his lips to stop the flow of word vomit.
floating through the darkness.
“She’ll come around.” Draco’s smile faltered a little. “But it doesn’t matter. This is what I want. I shouldn’t have run off yesterday but I was…well, scared I guess. You’ve become one of my best friends over the last couple of years and I didn’t want to ruin that. It took Ron telling me that he wished he’d acted a bit sooner with Hermione to make me realise how much I really wanted to try this.”

This was the best day ever.

“Yeah,” Ron agreed, taking another bite of cake. “Teenage Ron would actually hate me, but I have to admit he’s a bit of alright.”
a lot of the time. They had gone from shagging voraciously in the first year of their relationship, to less frequent fumblings, to going weeks where they did little more than peck each other on the cheek and have a furtive wank to let off some steam. Harry was a little frustrated – at the situation itself, rather than at the lack of sex – and a lot worried that Draco might start to get bored of scheduled shags and the odd handjob in bed.
“It’ll be fine, Harry. We’re all adults. We can make nice for a couple of hours.”
. But it’s been six months and I can’t let go. When he turns up at my door, my pulse thrums and my mind whirls and I can’t think about anything but tearing his clothes off and sinking my teeth into his perfect golden skin.
“I did find my forever person, Draco. I’ve been under the impression that he’s been my boyfriend for the last year.”
hand, which trembled in Harry’s palm like a bird.
“I think we need to talk, Harry.”
“Come on, up.”
early. Was rather embarrassing.”
and everything, but I can’t find the bloody ring anywhere.”
Draco looked up, hit for a second by just how large the sky looked. “I’m not sure you can see Draco in the Southern hemisphere.”
Merlin, it was hard to believe it had only been four months. Four months and eleven dates, that’s all it had taken for him to fall head over heels for Draco.
“And I’m getting ice cream?” Teddy added hopefully.
“Harry, there’s a really lovely lady who works with me-”
Working as an Auror in the Magical Response Unit had appealed to Harry when he’d been younger and fresh out of his Hogwarts Eighth Year. It gave him purpose and structure, something he needed as he learned how to live after the War. He had never really minded the unsociable shift patterns or overtime, because frankly he hadn’t really had anything better to do: his Sixth-year romance with Ginny never picked back up, and the handful of men and women he slept with before meeting Draco never progressed beyond a night. He saw Ron most days as they were in the same unit, and Hermione most lunchtimes as she joined them from Level Nine. He was content with his lot, until he saw Draco Bloody Malfoy with an armload of books, a pen stuck behind his ear and wide grey eyes, and for the first time in a long time, Harry wanted something
“You called me- you said-,” I stutter but the words won’t come. What am I doing? This is exactly what I wanted and I’m fucking it up good and proper.
“Ah, right.” Harry steeled himself. “It’s Draco Malfoy.”
“Do you want to Floo home or are you going to Apparate? I’ll have to open the Floo up for you. It’s been so cold lately, I’ve kept it closed so I can have a real fire going.”
There was a niggling feeling in the back of his mind that told Harry that it shouldn’t be this hard. It had been almost two months since he first told Ron he was going to propose. Two months where he hadn’t been able to say five words to the person he told everything to.
“Shoes off, you sod,” Draco muttered, pulling at Harry’s trainers when he failed to move.
“It’s just so lovely, Harry. I’m happy for you. And hey, I could always teach you that Bird-Conjuring Charm, just in case?”
“So, you’re not the marrying kind then?” he asked Draco, trying – and just about succeeding – to keep his voice light. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Ron grimace.
before he felt a returning pressure as Draco kissed him back. His hand came up to Draco’s nape, fingers twisting into the baby-fine hairs there, thumb tracing the edges of his jaw. He felt a hand ghost along his hip and he turned towards Draco fully, who wasted no time in pulling Harry onto his lap. His arm clamped around Harry’s waist as he moved his mouth down the column of Draco’s neck and sucked hard on his collarbone. The low groan that left Draco’s mouth sent all the blood in Harry’s body rushing south, his erection straining painfully against his jeans.
He stubbornly ate his way through a generous plate of sticky grey rice, even though both Ron and Harry had warned him about Hermione’s remarkable ability to turn the humble mushroom into a weapon of biological warfare. He’d later returned from the bathroom, pale and wan, and conceded that perhaps the risotto had been less knocked up than beaten viciously into an inedible, toxic sludge. This had spawned a competition to one-up each other in providing increasingly ridiculous excuses as to why they couldn’t eat Hermione’s cooking, culminating in Ron claiming he was vegetarian as he turned down Hermione’s hunter’s chicken to tuck into a pepperoni pizza (“Everyone knows pepperoni isn’t real meat, ‘Mione.”). Even Hermione had laughed at that one.
Potter leans against the door frame, his wild black hair spilling in bouncy curls over his forehead, his green eyes glazed behind his glasses. The top two buttons of his white dress shirt are undone and his sleeves are pushed up his forearms, revealing tawny skin that gleams in the moonlight. Black jeans, a days’ stubble and a worn leather jacket lend him a faintly dangerous air, like a wolf on the hunt.
Draco chuckled. “If you think I got a single say in anything wedding-related, you obviously don’t know my mother.” He cleared his throat delicately. “Besides, I had a chat with Ron last night.”
Draco smiled sleepily. “But it’s early o’clock and you’re tired and I’m tired.”
Ron snorted as he grabbed the last piece of bacon, and muttered, “Not what but
They both stopped talking abruptly. Harry took a large gulp of his ale and gestured for Draco to continue, but he shook his head. “We’re not very good at this, are we?”
“Are you
“You don’t even love each other!”
It was a few weeks later that Draco had mentioned finding it difficult to get a decent flat in wizarding London. The two of them had been standing at the mouth of the alley by the Leaky, sharing a clandestine cigarette, Draco having stayed late at the pub for the first time in a while. Their shoulders were touching lightly and it suffused Harry with a warmth that shielded him from the freezing night.
Harry laughed and then pulled back, just enough to rearrange them so that Draco sat between his legs with his back to Harry’s chest. It was a lovely moment that seemed to swell as the group descended into good-natured bickering and light insults; the smell of Draco’s shampoo and his cologne tickling Harry’s nose, the warmth of his body pressed back against Harry’s, the way their left hands were entwined loosely.
"Hold on, I'm about done with this report and then I can go down to the Floos with you," Harry muttered distractedly.
“Harry, I will throttle you,” Draco replied, trying not to sound as frustrated as he was and taking aim once again. He threw the blasting hex, but the bottle jumped to the side. “It fucking moved!”
. Urgh. Who drank my drink?”
Harry frowned when he flicked his eye over the rest of the page and caught on sentences like
“Mmmm.”
“Fuck off, I might be silly but I’m not stupid.”
“Finally!” Ron exclaimed as they took their seats next to him. “I was about to pass out.”
So he took a deep breath, tucked all those messy feelings away in the back of his head and tried not to think about Draco’s rosebud mouth or his stupidly clear skin (Harry was twenty-two for fuck’s sake and he
Draco sighed and sat down on the coffee table in front of Harry. “Is this about yesterday?”
At last, they both finally relaxed and started to talk. Draco told Harry about his
When they walked into the kitchen a few minutes later, Harry couldn’t help the burst of warmth in his chest or the way his lips quirked up at the sight of Draco Malfoy, barefoot and
When Harry had finally got up to leave, Draco had given him a sad little half-smile and pressed a chaste kiss to his cheek; it had felt a bit like a goodbye and Harry had been so panicked that he’d Flooed Ron and Hermione at dawn the next morning. Together, the three of them had lain on the grass in the backyard of Grimmauld Place, watching the day break as Harry worked his way through his feelings and they once again penned an Owl to Draco. (Ron’s suggestion of
on your mind?”
“Don’t you have any other candles you want me to…
Draco bit his lip. Now was as good a time as any.
Draco couldn’t help but melt a little at his words. “How about we have breakfast by the Great Lake tomorrow and you can kiss me there?”
“And Pansy.”
"Like a date," Harry confirmed with a grin as they exited the Auror offices. They just managed to catch the lift, squeezing in past a pair of witches dressed in the gunmetal grey robes of the Magical Accounts Division. Harry gave a polite smile as the taller of the two giggled at her friend. While the witches and wizards up at MAD were the worst with the flirty smiling and the flirty touching and the flirty autograph-hunting, it paid to be nice to the finance team - no matter how much Harry didn't want to sometimes.
to plan?”
“You alright?” Ron asked as he sank onto the sofa next to Harry. Frowning, he reached between them until he came up with the now somewhat crumpled copy of Witch Weekly. “Hermione
Before long, a fortnightly catch-up at the Leaky had been established, and slowly expanded over time to include Ginny, Pansy, Blaise and Luna. Once in a while, they were joined by other Hogwarts alumni and - on one memorable occasion - Professor McGonagall, who threw back a shot of Firewhisky and remained regal and stoic when smoke poured out of her nostrils as if she were some sort of ancient, majestic dragon.
It had been a little awkward at first, as Draco hadn’t seen Macmillan since Hogwarts; although he saw Luna and Neville occasionally as part of Harry's extended friend group, they weren't comfortably close. But Draco had discovered that there were some things that inexplicably bound people together, and trekking through the Andes - even after just two short days - was one of them.
Harry smiled softly. “Hey.” He shifted over, giving Draco room to sit next to him against the headboard. “They belonged to my parents.”
“Alright, lads!” Ron called, waving at them with his half-drunk ale sloshing precariously up the sides of his glass. “Oi, budge up, Finnigan,” he added, conjuring an impressively ornate set of armchairs for Harry and Draco.
Neville and Goyle had sequestered themselves at the other table, talking about, of all things, how to keep Goyle’s fussy magical calatheas alive. Harry had been most nervous about this pairing, because he remembered the way Neville had described the relish with which Crabbe and Goyle wielded the Cruciatus Curse back in seventh year: with what had happened to Alice and Frank, Harry had been unsurprised by the depth of Neville’s fury. But somehow, despite the deep, wounding hurt of the past, there the two of them were, discussing potting soil and drainage and feeding charms.
in a cosy grey cardigan, tight black jeans and slightly scuffed brogues showing off a flash of his bright scarlet socks.
“Potter,” he muttered, spinning around to pull his top on. Before he could do so, he felt Potter come up behind him, warm fingers on his shoulder.
when they weren’t sneering.
He felt Draco’s hands tighten around him. “Be that as it may, you’re still paying for dinner.”
"Who're you out with?" Ron asked, eying the witches with interest (he had no such qualms about being nice to the finance team). About a year after the war, he and Hermione had decided they were better off as friends - the best of friends - and Ron had since enjoyed batchelorhood immensely.
He helped a groggy Draco sit up and strip down to his boxers, neatly folding his clothing the way he knew Draco liked, and then he pulled the sheets up around him.
Harry chose that moment to focus on controlling his breathing instead of humouring Ron with a response. While it was true that Harry had developed an appreciation for Draco’s thundercloud eyes and razor-sharp wit, he wasn’t sure he wanted to fully admit it to anyone but himself. Anyway, they were
you’d like to ask me? No
Maybe it was the way Draco said it, or the way his skin tingled where their shoulders touched, or that he was tired after a long day writing reports, but Harry had found himself blurting out the truth.
Harry kneaded the sore muscles of Draco’s back with well-practiced skill, soothing the knots and kinks from another long hard weekend spent Curse-Breaking somewhere in Snowdonia. Slowly, he eased off the pressure until Draco lay soft and pliant under his hands, his back rising and falling gently with his relaxed breaths.
He got through that year by distracting himself with details: the curling ivy pattern of the sconces along the ballroom wall; how Nagini would pause for four seconds exactly, tongue in the air, just before she ate; the twenty-four heartbeats it took Voldermort to traverse the length of the Manor’s dining room, cloak whispering behind him with the softest hiss; the cacophony of colours that made up Harry Potter’s eyes as they stared desperately at him from between swollen, raw eyelids.
“That might be sooner than I anticipated,” Draco muttered, sighing when he caught sight of Harry’s answering grimace. “I apologise, Potter, that was rude.”
“Draco,” a clearly inebriated Harry Potter responds. “Draco Malfoy.”
"Merlin, Harry, stop being so vague," George said with a grin.
Harry thought as he took in the sight of Draco fucking Malfoy holding a tiny cat like it was the most precious thing in the world. Harry reached out a hand, gingerly, and stroked Basil’s forehead. The cat closed its eyes and preened a little. “Welcome to the house then, Basil.”
Ron sat on his desk and surveyed Harry with a raised eyebrow. "You're not pulling overtime tonight?"
. I was actually hoping to get to bed before midnight. It’s been a long week.”
“Hey,” Harry whispered, softly shaking his boyfriend awake, “let’s get you comfortable for bed."
“Why don’t you move to a bigger space in wizarding London?” Harry asked.
But he didn’t want to push away someone who had come to mean so much to him, who was so tied up in Harry’s own happiness. He didn’t want to lose Draco, who had been – once again – the only thing to catch his attention in years. Years in which Harry had buried himself in work and avoided building any sort of meaningful relationship outside his small group of friends. And now he was all in, committed to this thing with Draco, and yet; it felt like any moment it would slip from his hands and the last few months would have been nothing but a daydream brought on by too much stress and not enough sleep.
“For fuck’s sake Harry, my chances of finding someone who loves me are less than zero as it is. I’m a gay ex-Death Eater with the kind of work schedule that makes finding the time to even have a quick wank difficult!”
late.
Harry had anonymously owled his mother’s ring to Dean and asked for it to be altered slightly; he wanted the band widened and thickened to fit Draco’s finger perfectly.
Ahead of them, Luna, Neville and Ernie Macmillan passed a flask of coca tea between them (oh how Draco had truly started to loathe coca tea) as they walked with their guide, Francis. Draco had been somewhat surprised to see them standing at the start of the trail on their first day, as he and Harry had met with Francis the day before in Cusco and he’d told them it would only be the three of them in the group. Francis, a Peruvian squib with a fantastic smile that beamed frequently in his burnished red-brown face, informed them cheerily that Luna, Neville and Ernie had booked last-minute and would be joining their hike.
I turn around slowly, giving him a chance to back off. My heart’s suddenly light in my chest and my blood’s fizzing and
“Okay, now everyone raise your flaming shot to the heavens and join me in a toast to our wonderful newlyweds. May 'for better or worse' be far better than worse. On three, ready? ONE, TWO, THREE. To Harry and Draco!”
Harry James Potter, do you actually use this? It’s
nothing, is it?” Draco crowed triumphantly.
They’d been in the Auror training programme together straight out of their Eighth Year at Hogwarts. It was six months in that Ron that had first extended a hand of civility to Draco, inviting him to join their weekly drinking session at the Leaky when he felt a twinge of guilt at how all the trainees had shunned Draco (“he doesn’t really seem like that much of a knob anymore”). It had been an awkward night at first, the conversation stilted. But then Ron had asked Tom behind the bar for his wizarding chess set and before Harry knew it, Ron had lost a game of chess for the first time since training began and everyone who had already been through a humiliating chess defeat at Ron’s hands (which was most of them) was toasting Draco with a flaming firewhisky.
“Shut it, ferret face,” Ron replied with a grin. “Anyway, did you see your old mate Flint made Chaser for the Falcons?”
“Ah, well, that’s understandable then,” Draco muttered faintly as he lay a napkin over his chinos. George grinned. “This looks lovely.”
“See something you like?” Draco smirked.
. The Moment.
about having Draco in his house, with his bare feet and his cosy grey cashmere jumper and his silk pyjamas and his special Darjeeling tea in the cupboard and his fancy cheese in the fridge. Harry liked that he’d get the odd owl asking if he wanted to join Draco in a takeaway or a reminder to grab milk on the way home. It sparked a warmth in Harry and he found he could easily imagine having
“None for Pansy then, she comes with her own fire-breathing abilities.”
. That fucking article. Argh!”
I’m not so drunk that I can’t remember turning up here in the middle of the night, kissing him as soon as the door shut behind me, with a ferocity that shook me all the way to my bones. I remember his soft gasp of breath, body still warm from sleep. I remember a whispered question and a hurried
"Yeah, I'm alright. Glad it's the weekend though. Are you not doing overtime tonight, Harry? Not feeling well?" Harry rolled his eyes again; yes, he often did overtime on a Friday but was it really

“I still don’t understand what you were using the Floo powder
Harry groaned inwardly, running a hand over his stubbly jaw as the Floo flared to life.
After Hermione left, Harry sat in bed, the two rings cool against his palm. He’d decided he was going to return them to his vault until he felt it was a better time to ask Draco. He hadn’t been able to resist taking one last look at them together, these surviving pieces of his parents’ history. He shut his eyes and concentrated really hard, seeking out even just a wisp of warmth that was their touch. He fancied he could feel it, the soft burn of magic that felt like

with how much he wanted to fold himself into Draco’s arms and never leave. The moment was broken, however, when he hiccupped violently.
"Okay, guys?" Draco and Harry smiled weakly. "We'll take breakfast in ten minutes and we'll start hiking to Inti Punku at about 3.45. It's a challenging walk but it will be beautiful to see the sun rise over Machu Picchu. It's an unforgettable sight."
. He’d put on some weight since school, and Harry couldn’t deny the way his mouth dried at the sight of his broader shoulders and softer face. His skin was clear and creamy, and his eyes – although a little tight around the corners with nerves – were the warm grey of thunderclouds in the summer.
Next to her, a man with dark bristly hair and broad shoulders was looking on at whatever they were saying. It took Harry a moment to place him. It was
His eyes, flinty cold for so many years, were warm and light and open. His corn-silk hair was teased into a casually elegant quiff that flattered his high, regal cheekbones, patrician nose, pointy chin and small pink mouth. Harry found his gaze drawn to that mouth, rosebud lips that looked so
“Yeah.” I swallow and gather my things.
Draco let them into the bookstore, and then led them to the space at the back where Harry knew Leonie held her meetings for wizard-borns. It was a little small so they sat close together, but he felt Draco wasn’t quite ready to have Hermione and Ron in his private space.
“What? Why not?”
And yes, Harry got tired of it all sometimes, but wizarding London was his home. It was his job and his friends and his family,
“To be fair, you
Draco shook his head, strands of his hair catching on Harry’s stubble. “No, it’s a Grade II listed building – important to muggles,” he added before Ron could ask, “so even if I wanted to, I couldn’t.”
Caught off guard, Harry thought about the reasons why
And now Draco was very, very late to Harry’s birthday brunch.

for me. Stop smiling at me like that.”
“Can I kiss you?”
“Maybe you could wait to open it when you’re alone?” He looked so uncertain that Harry didn’t hesitate to nod, despite his intrigue about the mysterious gift. “Happy birthday,” Draco added, with another one of his little half-smiles, and pressed a kiss to Harry’s cheek.
The sweet domesticity of their living arrangement settled something in Harry. He hadn’t really ever had a proper relationship; he and Ginny had never picked up where they left off (she’d told him, the summer before Eighth Year, that the War had given her some perspective about what she really wanted – and it wasn’t boys); the men and women Harry had dated after leaving Hogwarts had never really progressed beyond a few dinner dates and a shag. And he hadn’t really minded - he had been in no real shape to get into a proper relationship with anyone in the aftermath of the War and he’d
Harry chuckled, a little breathlessly. They were onto the fifth and final mile of the day, and even though the physical side of Auror training kept them in good shape, Harry’s thighs were starting to feel like lead and there was an unwelcome sharpness in his side.
The first time, it was because he’d received an Owl inviting him to join Draco -
just as Ron chimed in with
He felt his own trousers tightening even further and he couldn’t help grinding his hips forward, revelling in the incredible pressure of his erection on Draco’s, and the guttural moan that spilled from Draco’s mouth.
“I FUCKING LOVE YOU HARRY POTTER AND I WANT YOU TO MARRY ME,” Draco screamed.
“Oh Harry, you’re really worried about this, aren’t you?”
Harry felt the tell-tale spark of warmth in his belly as his thoughts moved back to Draco. That morning after their first date, Ron and Hermione had Flooed over to Grimmauld for breakfast – and yes, Hermione had said in a no-nonsense tone as she buttered her toast, for the gossip. (Ron taken one look at Draco’s note and rolled his eyes: “He could’ve cleaned his shirt up with a
“That sounds good.” Harry stuffed a triangle of buttered toast in his mouth, wondering how best to phrase what he wanted to say without pissing Draco off – he could still go from nought to pissy in the space of a few mis-spoken words. “Make sure you take it easy for the next couple of weeks, though. I was a bit worried about you last night.”
“Hot, Malfoy?” Potter smirked, his voice low.
Harry’s stomach dropped and he tried to school his features into something casual.
Harry cleared his throat. “Yeah, uh, I’ll just clean up first and then…”
Draco snorted. “At least he’s honest. Too honest, perhaps.” He set Teddy down on the floor and flicked his nose. “We’ll make a Slytherin of you yet, Ted.”
“I think we all do, Ron. Those grey jeans are something else. Sometimes my thighs quiver a bit.”
want to have tea at Madam Puddifoot’s, do you?” Draco cut in.
want to go jogging with you,” he said as he walked past Harry, neatly sidestepping the bundle of bedlinen that flew into the room and smacked Harry in the face.
one?”
Hermione grinned. “It’s got a battery inside it, similar to the ones in the Walkman I showed you before, but you charge it when it gets depleted rather than swapping for new ones.”
“Yes, well, it got his attention, didn’t it? Anyway, back to you. Why don’t we bring up the subject of marriage at Friday drinks, see how he reacts? I’m certain you’re worrying about nothing but if it’ll put your mind to rest…?”
Harry nuzzled into Draco’s neck the instant he lay down, pressing open-mouthed kisses over his collarbones. “Merlin, Draco, you look so fucking fit with your skin all flushed. I thought Victor was never going to leave us alone.”
. Or what you did for three years when you left.”
Molly beamed. “Oh Harry, that’s so wonderful! You seem so happy.”
Harry looked around so quickly he felt his neck twinge. His boyfriend was indeed standing by the kissing gate, something tucked under his arm. Even from across the garden, Harry could see the stiff way that Draco held himself, and that perfectly aristocratic veneer that smoothed his face of all emotion. Rubbing the sore spot just under his ear, he stood up and made his way over.
hard not to think about Draco at all.
The next day, Harry stumbled out of bed in the late morning, his throat burning and the world a blur. He pushed his glasses onto his nose and fumbled around in the side table for one of Draco’s home-brewed hangover potions; he’d somehow found a way to give them an aftertaste almost like treacle tart, which always made Harry’s heart warm even as he shuddered through the initial discomfort of all the toxins leaving his body at once.
Draco cocked his head to the side as if thinking, but Hermione spoke before he could respond. “There have been studies to suggest that wizard-borns can affect some metaphysical changes in energy, when they take part in muggle magic circles.”
“Yes, I’m flirting with you.
“So…what you thought you felt then, it might not…I might not…it’s a terrible idea.”
with me?”
Draco nodded, fiddling with his wine glass. “I thought about what you said and you were right, there’s no point in waiting for that perfect person to come along. Even if there
Harry had awoken earlier that morning with a sense of determination. He’d built the whole
“Oooh, good shout! Can he be my pass too? Can we both have him as our pass? What’s the rule on that?”
Draco shrugged, taking a sip of his coffee. “It was okay.” He swallowed and looked around the kitchen, gnawing gently on his lower lip. “He’s really nice. Aiden, I mean. Funny and handsome and he sees past the Death Eater stuff. He’s perfect, really-”
work.”
It’s when we stop moving against each other that my chest starts to ache with the burden of loving him. It’s not right to keep something so large, so all-encompassing, trapped in a cage of sinew and bone and it’s starting to eat away at my insides.
“Blimey,” Ron murmured, “Draco Malfoy supporting wizard-borns.” He looked up at Harry and winked. “It’s what we endured Hermione’s mushrooms for, mate.”
This was the worst day ever.
was pretty terrible for drinking – he couldn’t never quite get the temperature right and it was usually a bit tepid). As he’d passed the front room, he’d spied a leg dangling off the sofa and walked in to find Draco sprawled out, fast asleep. Draco must have been exhausted – Harry recalled something about a four-day trip to the Taynish oakwoods near Argyll  – because he still had his boots on, cloak crumpled on the floor beside the couch.
It shouldn’t have surprised him really; he’d noticed Draco’s reluctance to hold their dates anywhere but in the muggle world, after all, but somehow Harry had thought it was only a matter of time – especially as their relationship became more serious – before they did something in wizarding London together.
, his brain supplied.
Harry sighed, rolling back over onto his back. Draco’s unanswered question hovered in the air above them as they lay there, hands entwined in the space between them, until Hermione called them back inside.
When Harry Apparated to the Burrow that morning, he was pulled up short by the sight of a familiar shock of white-blonde hair, just a shade darker than the early December snow that had blanketed Ottery St Catchpole overnight. Draco had been standing at the kissing gate in front of the Weasley’s front garden, one hand gripping a tasteful bouquet of wildflowers in a tight fist, the other clenching and unclenching at his side. This uncharacteristically nervous gesture was really quite endearing; even more so was the way Draco bit his plump lower lip as he stared at the Burrow. He didn’t even register Harry’s presence until he tapped him on the shoulder, startling him out of his reverie.
Hermione put her glass of wine down and regarded him archly over the wing-shaped glasses she sometimes wore for reading. “Yes, two months." Her tone said the topic was closed. "Now," she continued, "why are you panicking so much about this birthday party, Harry? You’ve been a bit… manic all week.”
I hesitate, biting my lip. Potter and I had become quite good friends in the last two years, after Mother and I reconnected with Andromeda. What started as suffering each other’s presence awkwardly while visiting Teddy evolved into drinks after work, Saturday coffees and occasional dinners with our growing group of mutual friends.
before you realised Draco’d left.”
Harry laughed quietly, feeling a rush of warmth for his ridiculous, brilliant best friends.
“I just don’t want to mess this up. It feels like it’s something special.” He sipped his wine. “I liked him a lot in Eighth Year. He… softened. It made me think, if things had been different – we probably would have been friends.” He shook his head softly. “I might have realised I was bi a lot sooner if the whole
sausage rolls,” Ron clarified.
And with that, he stepped neatly into the Floo. He made a mental note to save the memory of Ron's face to rewatch in a Pensieve later.
Draco gave him a small smile and reached over to squeeze his hand. It was only a second of warm, soft pressure, but it set the nerves in Harry’s hand on fire.
“Mmmm, a little, but in a good way. Where did you –
“Hold on…ah! There. The box by the bed that’s glowing. Wait, why do you have anti-summoning wards all over it? Did you bring home some sort of Dark object from a case? You know you’re not supposed to do that.”
even though he'd still have the occasional prattish moment, at least he now acknowledged when he was doing it. And there was something about the way he looked now, with his hair no longer slicked back stiffly, softening his features; Harry’s stomach would twist oddly when Draco would allow a rare smile, a dimple forming in his right cheek.
Rolling onto his side, Harry’s gaze swept around the bedroom, bright in the moonlight, albeit blurry without his glasses. He’d done his best to tone down some of the eviller vibes in Grimmauld Place since taking up permanent residence in the townhouse, but this bedroom was the only one that had really been finished. It just seemed that there was always something else to add to his never-ending list of things to do, like Transfiguring the serpent door handles and shooing out the ghouls in the attic, or encouraging some of the more cantankerous furniture to not kill his guests.
But Draco, stubborn arse that he was, wouldn’t be dissuaded.
Draco looked at him for a long moment. “What about the press? Or our friends? Or my mother or
Draco thought fervently.
Harry felt his blood fizzing around in his veins. Every nerve felt electrified and he swallowed against the thrumming of his heart in his throat. It was
“You guys are the actual worst.”
Draco smiled. “I guess it’s all subjective,” he replied. “I love Harry and I want to be with him forever-” (“Awww!” “So sweet!” “Draco that is disgusting.”) “-and I don’t need an hour-long bonding ceremony and a signed bit of parchment to prove that.” He leaned forwards to take another sip from his wine. “My, this conversation has become very serious. We’re in our twenties! It’s a Friday night! We should be shitfaced and dancing in a club somewhere.”
. "No, you tosser. I'm meeting someone for drinks."
Draco nodded absently, his eyes on Harry as he picked Teddy up with one arm, his t-shirt pulling taut around his shapely biceps. With a deep breath, Draco joined them, leaning in to press a soft kiss to Teddy’s multi-coloured curls.
A faint chime rang as he entered the shop, which was small and cluttered but surprisingly light inside. All along the walls were floor-to-ceiling shelves crammed with books, with no discernible filing system – some were double-stacked, with some books turned so that the glint of gilt pages was all Harry could see; some shelves were crammed with books at strange angles and spilling onto stacks on the floor; yet more shelves had orderly rows of books interrupted by a stack of cards bound with twine and a sprig of sage, or a small bird’s skull, or a velvet pouch. A small counter sat at the back next to a rainbow display of candles and, behind it, a doorway where a set of stairs was just visible. A strong woody smell permeated the little shop, making Harry feel instantly at ease despite his sodden clothes sticking to his skin unpleasantly. He moved to the nearest bookshelf, his trainers squeaking softly on the dark hardwood floor. Running a finger along the wooden shelf, he realised all the books were about magic.
“That bloody ghoul is back in the pipes and I need to get in to Gringotts by nine, they want us to start working on the items we found in the Avery vault. Most of them are goblin-made so
The ring had been returned, exactly right, earlier that morning. Basil had sniffed the little cream coloured velvet box – scuffed at the edges and worn at the front – before curling his little body around it, a sign of approval if Harry’d ever seen one. Harry had finally moved it to the darkest corner of his underwear drawer, using six Auror-grade spells of concealment and a fancy muggle technique where he threw a load of questionable underwear over the box in hopes that the truly shocking amount of holes would deter Draco’s wandering hands.
Harry stood transfixed, his eyes on Draco’s prone body.
“Hey,” he said, sitting opposite Draco. He twisted his hands in his lap, feeling a little nervous. “How was last night?”
“Mmmm,” Draco answered distractedly, his hand once again reaching into the pocket of his trousers to touch the shrunken velvet box he’d stashed there.
“Yeah, I know. There’s just... so much history between this particular group of
There was the familiar sensation of a hook behind his stomach and the rest of Draco’s words were left behind as they span through time and space.
He startled slightly when the door opened, whipping around to see Potter standing in the doorway, one arm above his head, pulling his loose white t-shirt up slightly to reveal a strip of café au lait skin. Potter had lost his pinched, post-war look and had become deliciously lithe, leanly-muscled with a sharp jaw and strong forearms that made Draco’s stomach squirm a little.
"It's a big, wide world isn't it?" Harry muttered, looking out at the expanse of starlit night and line of tents in the distance slowly coming to life as people were woken by their guides.
“About us… y’know… not having sex that often at the moment.”
,” Draco said dryly, pleased that he didn’t sound like he was
Harry smiled, trying to seem relaxed and calm even as he battled with not projectile vomiting everywhere. He looked into his boyfriend’s stormy grey eyes, which had widened with what Harry hoped was anticipation. “Draco-”
“After all,” Ron had told him, his mouth somehow already full with what looked to be around half his serving of pie, “I made it through three birthdays before Mione and I split up. I’m basically a present-giving pro.” Harry thought briefly of the many,
bookshop.”
Draco bit his lip. “I’m not.” After a moment, he exhaled harshly through his nose, nostrils flaring. “I like my bookshop, and my privacy, and my anonymity. The wizard-borns don’t care, or they don’t know, about my past. No one looks at me twice on the streets. No one reminds me of a mistake I made as a teenager that had lasting –
“Good luck popping the question, mate,” Ron said, clapping a hand on Draco’s shoulder briefly. “Make sure you let me and Mione know as soon as he says yes.”
Ron shrugged. “Seems like Oliver’s happy to be at home with them full-time. Surprising really, given how mental he was about Quidditch at school. Didn’t he once try and drown himself in the showers after Gryffindor lost a game, Harry?”

One night, Harry had come downstairs for a glass of water (his
“Meet me there in five minutes,” Draco confirmed as he stood up and sauntered off.
“Harry, please, your eyesight is not that bad. Anyway, how do you plan on asking him?”
“I don’t want to be
“Harry, Ron’s just told me the news! Oh, I’m so thrilled for you!”
But there was something comfortable and
There was a pause as Draco set the two cups of tea on the table and sank down into a dining chair slowly. “I promised Luna I’d go see her and Rolf, see how the Menagerie is doing.”
“No thanks, Hermione.”
When Draco reappeared some long moments later, Harry had managed to quash his indignation and had bought a round of drinks. He nudged the glass towards Draco with a sheepish grin.
Draco nodded. “So much,” he breathed.
Harry’s chest hurt, because despite his words, Draco was obviously terrified.
. They had camped among the giant redwood trees in a modified tent, waiting for hours in the stifling heat just to catch a glimpse of the elusive Giant Peruvian Bowtruckles, which were six foot tall and actually rather terrifying. Harry had spent an afternoon speaking to an anaconda that was basking in the shallows of the river while Draco hung back, fascinated and fearful in equal measure: the sight of Harry roaring with laughter, before turning to Draco and saying with a wink, “I think he looks quite delicious too” as a twenty foot snake bobbed its head behind him would stay with him for a while. They’d swum in crystalline pools, the Peruvian equivalent of gillyweed giving them not just gills and webbed feet, but exotically bright scales too. They’d shagged on just about every part of their cabin, including in the shower which resulted in
“We’re the first ones here,” Harry laughed as they wove their way to their usual table at the back of the Leaky. “I think we might end up messy tonight. It’s a shame you wore your fancy sweater.”
“Oh, honestly, no need,” Harry had protested weakly. “I think it’s just a small thing—"
Draco rolled his eyes. “Hardly, Potter.”
Harry chuckled weakly and waved his hand over them, wordlessly and wandlessly casting a cleaning charm that skittered over Draco’s skin and fizzed lightly when it swept his balls. He rolled over and placed his head on Draco’s chest.
They detoured to the off licence on the corner of Draco’s street. Harry bought a bottle of cheap vodka and some cranberry juice; it was from concentrate, but they were all sloshed enough not to care.
Harry walked them over to the others, leading a quick round of introductions. Draco leaned over the delicious spread to shake hands with Arthur and then Bill, and Fleur gave him a sunny smile when he said something to her in French. The words sounded delicious in his boyfriend’s voice, and Harry almost growled when Fleur came around the table to kiss Draco twice on each cheek, causing Ginny to snort with laughter.
“It’s not exactly like I’m beating the boys from my door,” Draco continued with a little self-deprecating laugh, completely oblivious to Harry’s mini-trauma next to him.
“When we got together, I wasn’t expecting anything like that,” Draco continued quietly. “You told me that you loved me and it was the only thing that mattered
“Merlin
Draco nodded. “Yeah. It takes a fair amount of magical strength to untangle curse-traps and hexes as is, but this place was pretty well warded and I caught the brunt of a blasting curse.” His voice was gravelly and he brought his hand to his ribs. “Couldn’t find the energy to walk up to my room last night. The Floo trip back from Gringotts pretty much did me in.” He set the tea down and ran a hand through his hair, grimacing. “Ugh, I need a long hot bath. Sleeping in a tent, even a wizarding one, always makes me feel grimy to my bones.”
"Blimey, Harry. Where did you even find him? He's been fucking AWOL since we left Hogwarts. Wait, you've not gone all Sixth Year on him again have you?"
Harry watched as Draco walked to the doorway that led to the stairs up to his flat. He paused, and then turned partway back. “Are you going to…?”
“Why would I do that?” Draco stepped forward a little and got dressed quickly. He felt oddly vulnerable with Potter standing behind him, not close enough to touch but close enough for Draco to feel the heat coming off him in waves.
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Ron stuttered. “Anyway, don’t try and pretend” – he took a fortifying breath – “you aren’t letting him move in because you’re- well, you’re kind of into him, aren’t you mate?”
“Two months!”
“It would be a shame for you to miss out on a chance to be happy.”
account,” Hermione said and Harry was surprised to see that smirk turn into a soft, sweet smile as Pansy looked at her. “Why are you panicking about your clothes, anyway?” She continued as she looked back to him. “Draco’s party isn’t for another—” she checked her watch “—four hours.”
Harry leaned down and swept Draco’s silky silver-blonde hair across his shoulder, pressing a kiss to the elegant nape of his neck. He took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of Draco’s cologne, bergamot and citrus and musk, the salty hint of sweat (not that he’d ever
Harry lifted the topmost response. There were no postmarks, presumably because Draco either hadn’t sent his reply or hadn’t replied until recently. He unfolded the missive and started to read.
.” He set his wine down on the table and put his hand on Harry’s leg, fingers tracing small circles on his knee. For some reason, the gesture made Harry feel nervous, as if Draco was trying to subconsciously calm him. All of a sudden, he wanted to be anywhere but this conversation. “It’s been quite a freedom not having that over my head these last few years.”
“Is everything okay, love?” Harry asked as he stood up and extended a hand out. Draco took it, allowing himself to be pulled up into his boyfriend’s arms. He leaned his forehead to Harry’s and nodded.
She laughed. “I don’t think anything was clouding your judgment, Harry, he was a right shit back then.”
Before he knew what he was doing, he had leaned forward and pressed his mouth to Draco’s. Harry’s heart stopped for a second as panic overtook him –
“Thank you for being so accepting.” His voice was muffled on her shoulder. “I know it can’t be easy.”
Harry stumbled out of the Floo, his mouth still stinging from an over-enthusiastic cleaning charm. He was going to sit right there on the couch and wait for Draco to get home from his date.
In the awful silence that followed, Harry heard his heart thundering in his ears as he realised what he’d said. “Oh Merlin, no, that came out wrong! You don’t need to get in shape! Unless you want to? In which case I totally support that. But you definitely don’t have to! Draco I didn’t mean-”
Stupid name.”
and Harry found his attraction to Draco growing every time he saw him.
I thought he’d quit professional Quidditch after they had their last kid?”
and then it was really
Harry’s resolve to be a good friend to Draco was tested one Saturday, when Draco asked if he could use his shower.
waking up to find you pressed against me like that. You always make time for me when we get a Sunday off together. When those things stop, then I’ll worry.”
“Ow! I’ll admit I deserved that. Down it on three? Ready? One, two, three-”
to Harry, and that with all they’d been through together, all the blood and fire and horror and joy, Harry was not going to give him up. Not unless he really wanted to go. (“Of course not!” Draco had sniffed, lifting his head from Harry’s shoulder. “Well that’s settled then,” Harry’d replied, brushing his thumb gently under Draco’s eye. “How about we go home and spoon on the couch?”)
Bill had clapped Draco on the shoulder, who looked politely bewildered as Fleur kissed him twice on each cheek with gusto, exclaiming her thanks for protecting her husband. Arthur had smiled kindly, and Molly had given his arm a quick squeeze before bustling him to the dining table. Draco’s small smile had faltered when George had just stared at him, eventually giving a curt nod. His tension seemed to ease when Ron passed him a plate piled high with fluffy, perfect eggs and Hermione immediately engaged him in a discussion about something intelligent-sounding. All in all, it was a successful brunch with the only hex thrown by Ginny when Ron hogged the bacon.
