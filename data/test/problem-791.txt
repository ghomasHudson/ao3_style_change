"The Dursleys? You shouldn't have been placed with them in the first place." They both snarled in anger.
This caused her to smirk, she had noticed several books with her name on display that showed she was an important person(which she would be looking at, of course). This man would fall to his knees to please her with his very fine clothing but she’d make him sweat a little. “My name is Maeve Potter, a pleasure I’m sure.”
Maeve only blinked, after all she had expected an outburst. "Well, I suppose I'll have to convince you, huh?" She questions, making direct eye contact.
She rolled her eyes when she stepped forward, as the whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over the hall.
"Yes, we've been over this. Now--wait, did you say he betrayed my parents?" She thought back to the day she visited Gringotts. Why hadn't she asked more questions in regards to her godfather? Why didn't she ask about why he wasn't in her life, surely the goblins would know as they manage all that goes on with the wizards through the bank. She'd have to write to the Potter's account manager, Silvertooth, and ask for information regarding Sirius Black.
Daphne took a sip of her water before clearing her throat. "Well, at least we don't have to worry about another Howler incident. Another one of those and they might as well sign their death warrant."
Soon it was finally 3:00, in 15 minutes parents will start arriving. Mrs. Colt had the students finish the math work as their exit ticket. Ready to set her plan in motion, Maeve stood up and began to walk towards Mrs. Colts desk.
"Five points from Slytherin and if you don't sit down I'll make it more." Flitwick threatened and before Pansy could open her mouth to argue yet again, Maeve stood up with a harsh glare.
Maeve looked out the window, the feeling of her magic coiling around her soothed her nerves. She tapped her fingers gently against her thigh, trying to match the rumbling of the car. Clouds darkened as though it was to rain, she let a smile full her face. Story weather was always enjoyable.
Once the sizes have been written down, Fairchild and Margaret both got to work on creating the masterpieces that would The Maeve Potter returning. “Ms. Potter, the estimated time for these to be completed would be two days tops. Would you like us to owl these to you or would you be picking them up in person?” Margaret asked as she pulled out different layers of fabric.
She watched as Dudley stuffed his face with eggs and bacon that was drenched in grease. -how disgusting. If that fool continues to eat so much, I fear he'll eventually turn into an actual pig.- She turned to her aunt and cleared her throat, "May I head to school early?" She asked in a polite voice. -why must I ask permission? These lowlifes should be kissing my feet, not the other way around.-
She placed the note on the counter and walked out the house from the back door. It was much easier to get by with no witnesses. Walking to the bus stop was quiet and peaceful.
The corners of Maeve's lips turned upward, she was finding the whole predicament hilarious. Now only would Vernon Dursley come down would she start the party. "Whatever do you mean, dear aunt Petunia?" She asked in mock curiosity.
The shelves were stacked to the ceiling with books as large as paving stones bound in leather; books the size of postage stamps in covers of silk; books full of peculiar symbols and a few books with nothing in them at all. Maeve would have the time of her life if she never had to leave the place. She began her search for her supplies and then she searched for books that would help her in this new world.
Maeve walked out of the common room alone as Loki had requested to remain in the dorm, lunch was over and she hadn't eaten a thing. Maybe Malfoy would be willing to help her search for the mysterious kitchen she heard the upper years talking about. Or perhaps Zabini would be more willing. He seemed the daring type. Nott, she wasn't so sure about, she had only met him today.
Maeve clipped it on and gasped startled at the rush of power it gave to her. "Oh my. That was... incredible." She whispered in awe. She glanced at Loki with excitement in her eyes. "Loki! Look at my beautiful necklace!" She has never felt such childish glee before, a smile spread across her face so big it was nearly painful.
"Today we'll be going over the cure for boils, you all will read silently. Make any noise and you'll have detention. Friday we'll be working on the potion, hopefully you're not all as idiotic as you look." The dark haired man sneered before turning around.
Marge could only state in fear, this was no child. A demonic little girl she was. She knew Vernon should have gotten rid of her when she was a babe. Now it was too late.
She huffed irritably, a scowl firmly placed upon her face. Jade green eyes narrowed, glaring dangerously in the open air. Blaise knew her harsh gaze could probably set ablaze the unoccupied chair in front of her. Fire, the most powerful and dangerous element for a witch, especially an angered one.
The halls seemed so much longer than before, she almost just wanted to head back to her dorm and call it a day. But, alas, more knowledge meant more power. The more she knew and understood, the more capable she was of doing magic
Maeve sighed, rolling her eyes. "I guarantee it's because I'm not acting like the golden girl he wants. Instead of Gryffindor, I'm a Slytherin. Little bookworm was probably sent to try and sway me to the light side, spewing utter crap about Dumbledore being a great wizard."
"What is it you need, Griphook?" The goblin, who must have been in charge, ask. Said goblin motioned to the small girl beside him. "She is claiming to be Maeve Potter, and has requested the blood test to prove it along with an inheritance."
Maeve couldn't stop the pleased smile that made its way onto her face, there was something exciting about the way she made people cower before her. It filled her with a surge of power and she was drunk off of it. She nodded to her darling Dragon when she saw his concerned look, there was nothing to worry about. Not when she could cause fear to rise in anyone.
The question was innocent enough, but it made her pause. Hogwarts first year term was on 1st of September, which was in a month. She had to get everything ready, because she was going to have an amazing year.
"I know defense against the dark arts mostly because my grandfather taught me, he wanted me to acknowledge the power of the dark arts and how to defend myself from them." Theo admitted, she smiled at him and wrote down both Draco and his strengths and then looked at Blaise.
The professor hummed as he thought about how different the girl who lived was from the stories that were told. She didn't act as someone who was spoiled nor did she act like she was raised by filthy muggles. She held herself with the grace and poise of a proper lady raised by purebloods, quite strange.
"And like the moon she had a side of her so dark, that even the stars couldn't shine on it; she had a side of her so cold, that even the sun couldn't burn on it."
Maeve silently opened the door and walked out, she made her way to the common room. She stopped in surprise, she didn't expect anyone else to be downstairs so early, was Malfoy an early riser or was the first day jitters? He faced the fire that was crackling in the furnace, but she could recognize his blonde hair anywhere.
She withheld a sigh, Merlin, she hoped these two had more respect and brains not offend a Lady as their brother did. Well, not wanting for them to notice her as she is most positive the younger Weasley had ran his mouth about her and she was not in the mood to entertain a pair of Gryffindors. She bit back a curse as lady luck was clearly not on her side today.
Maeve smiled politely, standing up. "Well, I hope you understand what I have said. It'd be a shame if any of you were to vanish. Petunia, I will not be doing those ridiculous chores anymore, you want them done do them yourself. Have a good day." She walked towards the kitchen door, before stopping. "Oh, by the way, I'm taking over the guest room. If Marge ever decides to stay over I'm sure you could find her somewhere to sleep. Might I suggest a dog house? That is where animals go." She then walked out, her laughter following her out.
"It's because you three are disgustingly normal, you have no power, no magic. Nothing. Which means you are below me. I'm in charge now, because if I wanted to I could kill you. I have no problem in doing so, just know I do not need you. I'm capable of taking care of myself, you have no use to me. Petunia, Dudley you may be blood, but you are not family. Remember that. Any questions?" She asked, glancing in the eyes of her terrified relatives.
She narrowed her eyes, the feeling of being looked down upon had always been one of her biggest peeves. “I require robes for Hogwarts, I’ll be attending my first year. I also need robes for everyday settings, robes for holidays and special occasions will also be appreciated.” Her request was plain and cold, she expected it to be done and quickly.
Maeve rolled her eyes, a charming smile pulling at her full lips. "Yes, I've noticed them looking at me like I'm a monster. Well, if they want a villain so bad then I'll be delighted to show them exactly how dark I can be." She looked at them with her eyes glowing with malevolence, the manic look sending shivers down their spine. Yet, even then, they also allowed equally dark grins to spread across their faces.
"Cub?" The scarred man whispered brokenly. Maeve tilted her head in a confused manner. Cub was an unusual nickname.
She lied in bed, carefully thinking out her plan. She'll make sure the Dursleys never lay a hand on her again. Her back was still sore from the whipping Vernon did, despite the fact her special ability(actual magic, as Loki had told her) had healed most of the damaged parts.
Maeve rubbed her arms as goosebumps formed on her pale skin, shivers racked her body and her teeth chattered rapidly. You'd think she was being dramatic and over exaggerating, but she truly despised the cold and everything associated with it. She made it to the common room door and practically shouted the password, the fireplace was lit and the warmth enveloped the room. The shivering girl softly sighed in relief, she was about ready to cry from the icy air. Maeve dropped herself on the emerald couch closer to the burning fire, the heat nipped at her skin comfortingly.
She tried to walk around the other girl only to be stopped yet again. "Wait, you can't just ignore him! That's Dumbledore! Greatest wizard of all time, and don't you know it's rude to disobey adults?"
She ordered the lazy snake up, he hissed grumpily but did as told. Maeve opened her door and walked down to the kitchen where the Dursleys were at. Loki slithered alongside her, trying to stay within the shadows where its cooler.
"I agree, love, too incompetent for my taste." Blaise eyes the crowd of first years who shuffled around nervously.
Darling, you are a goddess. And once you know what that truly means, I pray for anyone who tries to hurt you.
Zabini, who had been reading and listening, had to admit Potter had a way with words. It was no wonder she was placed with snakes, no other house would see her potential. He smirked, they wouldn't see what hit them until it was too late. She'd make a great leader, especially with the way she was pulling strings from behind as she was basically manipulating Malfoy into deceiving his father, whom the boy quite literally worshiped, into giving him information. A Dark Lady indeed.
The bloke had a daunting personality, but she'd break him if necessary. And if he proved to be a formidable opponent, well, she always encouraged a good challenge. She could keep him alive and on a tight leash. Should he turn out to be incompetent, then surely Dumbledore, the greatest wizard since Merlin, could afford to find a decent replacement.
Maeve smiled kindly, this one should be kept as well. He's a dark horse. "Pleasure, I'm Maeve Potter." She took his hand, feigning another blush as he pressed a delicate kiss on her knuckles in the same manner Malfoy did.
She hissed in question. Loki merely nodded his head before falling once more to sleep. She giggled quietly. He was such a lazy little guy.
"How do you plan on showing them your dark, well darker, side?" Blaise questioned, with a curious expression.
A few moments later the door opened and a few more students from both houses walked in. Walking in last were her three companions, making their way towards her when they saw her sitting in the back. From his pocket, Malfoy pulled out a plastic covered sandwich and covered treacle tarts.  Her lips quirked up at the offered food.
She giggled when she heard the snake cheer. Maeve walked down the sidewalk, and Loki hid along the shadows following her. They reached the Dursleys resident, when she suddenly stopped, pouting she remembered her plans to visit the library.
Maeve nodded, finding Loki's answer to be acceptable. She slowly removed the blanket and got up, careful not to make any noises as to not wake the others. She quietly opened her trunk and pulled out her uniform and a pair of undergarments, she grabbed her hygiene bag, a towel and headed to the showers.
Maeve rolled her eyes at the reaction everyone was having. Magic was real so honestly how could ghost existing be what surprises them?
"Of course, professor. I'm grateful he took time out of his day to assist me." She had a faux smile on lush lips as her words were heavily sugarcoated, not that anyone would notice. He eyed her from over his shoulder for a moment before turning away, a smirk replaced her smile. -fools.-
"Either they follow us or they fall with their so-called light leader." Maeve shrugged carelessly. "I personally have no need for them at the moment, so I will not care should they die...Well, perhaps Flitwick is alright." She said after a momentary pause.
"Honestly, did his parents not teach him manners? And to speak to a lady like that? How dare he?" Despite attempting to calm down, her anger wouldn't simmer. How dare a lowly boy like him think he could speak to her in such a disgusting way. She'd have his head on platter served to his mother who didn't think to discipline him.
Quirrelmort nearly hissed as he felt the familiar ting of magic. He eyed the girl curiously, why did she have the feeling of his magic? Then he saw the thin gold chain that hung around her pale neck. Could it be..?
After leaving Gringotts feeling much lighter, Maeve decided it was time for a new makeover. She’d also need to visit a bookstore to find out more about magical customs and what it means to be Lady, she'll need to learn the laws, politics, and traditions. It wouldn’t look good if she were to insult someone accidentally because she didn’t have the right knowledge. A whole new wardrobe is also a must, wearing mundane clothing will never get her as far as she’d like and she would very much appreciate never having to be reminded of the life she once had.
"Well, it can't be helped. I sincerely hope you are prepared to meet your family's betrayer." He had a sad smile but his eyes held anger at being denied.
He had a sneer on his face and a cold look in his dark eyes as he looked around the classroom. Momentarily stopping at Maeve Potter who merely smiled mockingly, toxic green orbs glinting dangerously as she stared at him. He cleared his throat and instead turned his attention to the rest of the classroom, missing the cruel smirk that curled at the young girl's lips. "You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-making. As there is little foolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through the human veins, bewitching the minds, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even stopper death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach." He spoke softly, capturing the attention of everyone with ease.
"Nox is Latin, meaning Night. It is derived from Roman Mythology, Nox is the Roman Goddess of Night."
She reached the doors that led to the benches that faced the quidditch pitch. Maeve tugged her robe closer to her body and Loki hissed in annoyance at the chilly air, neither were good in cold conditions. Merlin, those twins better make this worth her time or she was gonna hex them so bad for causing her to freeze.
"Well thank you, Mr. Hagrid." She said once more before walking closer to the wet, shivering girl. "Next time, don't bad mouth the dead, especially about my dead relatives or I'll make sure you join them six feet under. Understood?"
"Boys, I take it you've all missed me?" She had a teasing smile on her face, despite that her eyes spoke volumes. Theo caught on, he supposed the future Dark Lady had a heart after all, not that he doubted of course. Blaise smiled as he was very observant and knew the question she had left unasked. Draco on the other hand was a bit dense, even so, they loved him all the same.
"Of course, Lord Malfoy. Sorry godfather, I must be going. I'll be visiting you soon, I promise. Get well soon!" She walked away with the blonde, her mind buzzing with plans. Maeve couldn't wait for everything to be set in motion. Dumbledore won't know what hit him, she guaranteed.
Maeve giggled softly, full lips pulled into a delighted smile. "They told me it would help me in my journey of my choosing." She stated.
Maeve thrummed her fingers lightly against the arm holder of the black couch, humming softly to herself. She looked around the room, one of the few sitting around was the boy who was with Draco at the train station. Goyle, she believed his name was. Perhaps he'd be willing to call her boys down, not that he'd have room to refuse.
"Sorry, professor. I was just searching for my three friends. Draco, Blaise, and Theo. Have you seen them?" She would play along with his little games, just for now. After all, it could prove to be amusing.
"Where have you been staying? My father said Dumbledore claimed you were living with muggles, is that true?" He asked as though the very thought of living with muggles was a disgrace. He was right, of course, but that tone of voice would never be allowed with her. Best he learns that now then make a mistake like that again.
Loki hissed in question. She hummed in response, not seeing the point in replying verbally. Uncle Vernon drove in silence, he usually complained about every little thing he sees, but she guessed he could do that when she's gone.
"I have some books and notes we could go through." He offered, he could ask his mother to owl them to him. They should still be in his room as he hadn't returned them to the family library yet.
"Thank you." she replied tersely, snatching her schedule from his out stretched hand when it seemed he was not going to simply hand it over like a mature adult.
Muggleborns, their called. Her mother was one, and she was brightest witch of her age. Unlike Malfoy, Maeve didn't care for blood, as long as you had magic you belonged. The only thing that mattered was magic and how powerful you were.
She swung her legs over the bed, groaning at the sore feeling shooting up her back. "We'll let you get dressed." Griphook said walking out with Axehammer.
Not given much choice after losing the challenge, George pulled out an old parchment paper from his pocket and looked around cautiously. "I solemnly swear I am up to no good." He whispered as he tapped his wand gently upon it . Maeve's eyes widen in amazement as words began forming on the once blank paper.
She really wanted to slam her head on the hard surface of the tabletop, why couldn't they have a teacher that actually taught something useful? Her green eyes trailed to the ceiling, was Dumbledore always this incompetent? He truly couldn't get a more qualified teacher for class, perhaps one that isn't dead? What if the professor wanted to rest, could the Headmaster keep him here against his will?
"Have you received a letter from your father? Or the books you requested from your mother?" She asked Draco, as she fanned the corner of her lips gently.
He sighed. "I mainly know all about ancient runes. I study them in my free time. During my trip to pick up my supplies, I stumbled upon the runes section and became fascinated. So, I've been studying."
"When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"
"Pet, listen, lets just get rid of her. Surely her kind wouldn't notice her missing." She listened as Vernon continued to insist on removing her. Petunia was clearly thinking it through. "I don't know Vernon, you saw what she could do. What if she follows through to what she said and kills us?" Maeve smirked at that, it seems her aunt wasn't fully dumb. Vernon scoffed, puffing his chest out. "The freak wouldn't do a thing, we took her in and gave her a home. Fed and clothed her, she owes us."
"Turn to page 36, you may work in partners or you could work alone. And don't be afraid to ask for help, that's what teachers are for."
She walked towards her wardrobe and opened it up, her uniform hung neatly in the front of the other clothing. Gently pulling it down, she turned to her snake who was watching her curiously.
On the fateful day of October 31, 1981, the Potters were attacked by a dark wizard who went by the name Lord Voldemort. James Potter, a wizard from an ancient and noble pureblood family, was the first to lose his life while trying to stall time to save his wife Lily Potter, a powerful muggleborn witch, and their daughter and heiress, Maeve Alarica Potter who was the child of prophecy.
"We'll just be asking a few questions and then we can join the others for lunch." George stated, he didn't want to stay out in the cold either, sunrise or not.
Also, I've already been asked this but I'm not sure where the alohomora spell is taught, I found it online in the charms section but someone said it was in the Transfiguration part. I'm not too sure so please don't comment about how it's wrong or not, it really doesn't matter to me as long as it's taught in class so that way Maeve knows the spell without having to rely on Hermione who was the only one to actually know it in canon. Thank you.
Maeve looked at them in disbelief. No wonder there was a stereotype of them being Neanderthals! They were bloody wankers, the lot of them!
"Sit." She ordered in a quietly, pushing some magic into her voice to make sure they did as she commanded. Her aunt and uncle's eyes widen as they did as told with no hesitation, Dudley squeaked as he was forcefully pushed into a chair that had pulled out on its own. "Now, Dursleys listen carefully because I will not be repeating myself. I know of magic, and I've come to realize that you two," she pointed at her shell shocked aunt and uncle in disdain. "Knew I had it but kept it to yourselves. I don't appreciate that, that will change. You are no longer in control, you no longer have authority over me. Do you want to know why?" She asked sarcastically.
"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost -- I say, what are you all doing here?"
Then her daughter, Maeve Potter, strange name with an even stranger middle name, was dumped with them. She was a carbon copy of her father with Lily's eyes. The little brat was a beautiful baby(even when she had a lightning shaped scar on the right side of her forehead above her eye), perfectly pale skin with a natural rosy glow, full puckered lips, a small nose and thick curly ringlets that reached just below her chin. And her eyes were a stunning green framed by thick eyelashes that fluttered gently each time she blinks.
Maeve noticed his horrid crooked teeth and dark eyes, she thought he'd might've had troll blood in him. He seemed pretty tall, despite sitting down, he also looked muscular in a way that stemmed from playing sports. Flint glanced up and smirked as he made eye contact with her.
Petunia cleared her throat before shakily meeting her nieces alluring deep green eyes, "Well, there's something we need to discuss before your birthday tomorrow." She said trying to appear confident.
She made it down the road to privet drive, the street was empty as everyone was most likely getting ready for bed. Walking up to number 4, privet drive, she noticed the living area lights were on. Furrowing her eyebrows, she unlocked the door and went inside.
Reaching the school, she stared up in distaste. The building was a dull grey color, with its paint chipping. The whole setting was dreary and depressing.
The boy next to Zabini surprisingly answered. "Everyone believes Slytherins are dark, considering all the witches and wizards it's produced." He paused, lowering his voice. "Including the darkest wizard of the last fifty years, Voldemort."
Petunia rushed into the kitchen as soon as she heard her precious son shout in distress. "Duddykins?!" She shouted frantically, eyes searching the area for any intruders before falling onto her niece who sat innocently at the table with a single plate of food in front of her. "What is the meaning of this, girl?" She demanded, eyes narrowing in suspicion.
"Potter, you say?" The pug faced girl asked with a shrilly sort of voice. She had an air of superiority, as though she assumed she was better than those around her. But Maeve had seen her eyeballing Malfoy since they sat down, most likely hoping to catch his attention.
-how can I make them understand that I am the superior? They have no chance a beating me, even with Vernon's brute strength. After all strength will always bow down to those with far more intelligence.-
I will like to accept this invitation to your school, I hope the fact that it's being delivered on the last day you should have received it didn't hinder your work. By the way I currently have no way to get the items stated on the list, is there a certain place I go? Please write back with answers.
"Of course, professor. When would she like to see me?" She asked in artificial politeness, a plastic smile plastered on her face. She supposed the plan she forged would have to wait.
In a previous chapter it was said that Maeve had gotten the Horcrux removed and it's true, but the matter of her feeling the pain was more due to what she found out in Gringotts about being a Nephilim. Being half angel allows her to feel the corrupted and twisted soul Voldemort would have, thus her flinching and wincing when being in contact with the Quirrell. She'll still have the scar despite the dark magic not being there, since obviously scars don't really disappear after being there for so long.
As you can see from this chapter but my favorite professor is Fitwick, he always seemed the type to care about everyone regardless of house and so I've named him president of my book.
McGonnagal's eyes narrowed, something about the Potter girls tone made an uncomfortable shiver trail down her spine. Nevertheless, she responded. "Potter, you do understand you were being rude and disrespectful in the way you spoke to me, correct?"
The dark skinned by sat across from her next to a pug faced girl while Malfoy sat beside herself. The girl seemed to be glaring at her, eyeing her unkempt tie. Once they made eye contact, Maeve simply raised a brow, daring her to say something. The girl appeared to at least have some brain cells as she merely turned the other way with a barely covered scoff.
The head goblin, Silvertooth she remembered Griphook saying, nodded and examined her with calculating eyes. She stared back, refusing to be domineered. Seconds later, he motioned for her to sit in the chair in front of him.
Who in the world were these people she was supposed to be loyal to? She hates when anyone meddled in her life, especially when they tried to control her every move as though she were a puppet! She glanced up at Silvertooth thoughtfully, making a decision she handed the paper to him.
Soon enough class was just about done and professor Snape had instructed them all to close their books and gather their things. Maeve did as told, followed by those around her, she didn't miss the grimace that graced Snape's face when he took in how well behaved her snakes were. He could make faces all he wanted as long as he never disrespected her and that he knew his place. They'd never be equals and it's time he realized that.
They must think themselves invincible, and most likely daft, to believe that she had not thought once of getting revenge. One way or another, her relatives would atone for what they have done to her. No, as soon as she has complete control of her magic, they will be regretting ever laying a hand on her.
"Oh! Before I forget, Draco, your father was the one to take me to the trial and also agreed to be my proxy. My godfather was of course declared innocent as I knew he would be." She paused to wait for the last student to pass ahead of them. "We also have much to discuss, Dumbledore spoke to me just as your father left. Said some things that would be vital in our journey to take over the ministry and then the world...Also I've been doing some thinking and have come to a conclusion, but I'll talk more after class. That is, if we don't die of complete boredom."
"The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rule breaking will lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points is awarded the house cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours.
Okay so I'm still kinda new to to writing on ao3 and I just figured out the Rich text let's me use italics and bolds lol I was scared to use it cause I thought it did something else.
Maeve smiled at her serpent friend, he always knew exactly what to say to make her feel better. And he was right. No matter what, she was going to take control. Make everything better.
Flitwick nodded, hopping onto the stack of books that were well placed behind his desk. "Good, two points to Slytherin. Today we'll be doing Lumos and putting it out with Nox, would anyone like to give a demonstration?"
Theo rolled his eyes, muttering under his breath. He shook his head and looked at their leader with a head tilt. "Do we meet up in the library after Dinner?"
The goblin, who identified himself as Griphook led her to the back where she would be taking a blood test. "Griphook," she spoke as they walked. "What type of test does one take to find more of their heritage?" She was curious on who exactly her parents were, of they were like her.
She was proven correctly when he opened his mouth, "Go around, I'm busy as you could see." She refrained from out right growling, the nerve he has to speak to her like that and he doesn't even bother to look at her when speaking.
Also, no hate to boys when I called them an easy puppet to manipulate. Not all of them are idiots, but some are blind to a pretty face.
He was an upper year student who she saw constantly bullying the younger years from other houses and not once getting in trouble by their head of house. Although that didn't really surprise her as professor Snape seemed like a total git from what she's heard from passing students. His name was Marcus Flint, he was the quidditch captain and its chaser, he was known for his brutal attacks to win by any means.
"Well, it can't be helped. Anyways, I planned on showing you a locket I received from Gringotts." She pulled the gold necklace from beneath the collar of her shirt and proudly presented it to them.
She shooed them away before walking confidently into the wall. Her already large green eyes widen at the sight before her, the scarlet train was magnificent. Plump pink lips curling into a smile, this was going to lead her to her home, the very place her parents were taught at and practically grew up in.
She quietly giggle to herself when Malfoy had been called up as he swaggered forward and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, "SLYTHERIN!"
"That sounds like our best options." The corner of her mouth lifts slightly, not a full smile. "Well, would you like to join me for an early breakfast?"
It went on like that until the last student was called on which happened to be Blaise Zabini going after Tracey, Maeve believed her group went last as professor Flitwick knew full well that they were the most competent in the class. Only a few actually required help and even then there weren't many mistakes, her snakes were quick learners and she'll make sure to see if they need help anywhere else. She refused to have anyone failing when there were plenty of ways to change the outcome.
"And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death."
That had been an exciting day, she got to put one of her disgusting relatives in their place. She dressed in an over-sized black nirvana t-shirt tucked into faded high-waist cutoff denim shorts that stopped just below mid thigh and a pair of black converse, she looked in the mirror and nodded her head approvingly. She grabbed her brown, leather messenger nag and walked out her room, making sure to lock it before going downstairs.
He sighed and made his way down the stairs to the Dursley's kitchen. He automatically started making copious amounts of eggs, bacon, and potatoes in order to satisfy the beasts that were his cousin, Dudley, and Uncle Vernon.
of my father or his associations Potter" Draco spat in a low livid voice. Harry was too shocked to respond and, hyper aware of the boys hand around his throat and the alarms going off in his head that he was getting angry enough he might get hurt, didn't say anything. Draco shoved him once more and walked out the door, his gang of cronies following behind him.
He went through his usual routine; get up, shower, get dressed, get breakfast even though he was never hungry anymore, and then go to class.
Tonks looked around the room as Harry packed. She walked over to his mirror and stared at herself for a few minutes looking deep in thought.
When she saw the writing etched into his hand she gasped. "Oh Harry, what did she do to you..."  Harry opened his mouth to explain, but the shut it again as he realized he wasn't exactly sure. "I don't know." He said slowly "she makes me write lines with this quill but there's no ink it just. Uses my blood I guess and it took the words from the paper and put them on my hand"
Harry nodded and without meaning to looked around and his eyes landed on Draco once more. He ripped himself away and followed Hermione onto the train and into their compartment.
As he stepped into the classroom he was pretty sure his heart had stopped for a solid minute because in all of Merlin somehow Draco had gotten even more handsome. He already felt a tad warm as soon as he saw the glorious boy, but when Snape announced that they would be sitting with their partners for the majority of the project Harry's temperature sky rocketed.
Sirius was the first to speak. "Of course you would want to join Harry. And I feel you have the right to know some things. But you aren't old enough to join the Order just yet. I will tell you what you need to know a little later."
"Hey Potter didn't expect to see you here. Would have thought you'd be off with Dumbly raving about your lunatic theories"  he smirked "or did he ask you to spread your little rumours about The Dark Lord"
Surprisingly Malfoy heads his advice and sends a heavy look back at him before leaving. One that Harry would dream about for days.
Draco had invited him on a date and had told him to come to the Astronomy Tower at Midnight which Harry headed by grabbing the Invisibility Cloak. He slowly made his way up there and found Draco there alone. He greeted his Boyfriend, Draco had asked the question of labels a week ago, with a kiss and a smile. "So why'd you bring me all the way up here, Dray?"
Harry was just finishing putting most of his things in his trunk when a wave of, something, passed over him. It was so strong he had to sit down for a second. He slowly laid down on his bed and breathed deeply. He felt the numbness beginning to take over again and that's when he realized the something was a wave of sadness. That he couldn't control. So he welcomed the numb again. He tried to distract himself from the new sadness but couldn't find anything to do so he went downstairs to help Ms Weasley with dinner.
Harry is mad that his friends didn’t tell him about The Order. Harry is mad he can’t join the order. Harry is just mad in general
Harry bolted straight up in bed, breathing hard. The dream fresh in his head, his scar pounding. He looked around wildly for a second before bursting into tears.
After Hermione's ridiculous request that Harry had stupidly agreed to, he spent most of his free time making lesson plans which to he found actually helped distract him quite nicely. Of course he still cut every now and then but he had slowed down considerably.
Mr Weasley quickly got off and made a beeline towards the middle of the hall and Harry followed him as he made a sharp turn onto some staircases. Harry followed him down onto the next floor and towards a large door set into the wall with
The weeks passed in an insane blur of studying, DA sessions, questions, Umbitch, and snogging when possible so Harry was glad to have a break in the form of Draco after curfew.
Harry began obediently bringing the large plates of food over to the table setting them down quickly. That's how he ended up burning himself on a particularly hot plate, he went to pick it up and it had burned his hand. He had yelped and pulled away, more out of instinct then pain, resulting in him spilling the plate and it's contents all over the clean kitchen floor, which is how he managed to be locked up in his room on Sunday, August the 6th.
Harry glanced down at the schedule Draco had made for them after their last positions class and noticed that he was on duty to stir the potion that night. It was almost getting too late to go down so he grabbed the invisibility cloak just in case and slipped out the portrait hole.
After dinner that night Harry had gone and collapsed into bed. He was tired and still a bit dizzy after his last session with the knife, yet he found he could not sleep soundly. He woke up about 100 times that night from dreams.
Draco undoubted had more to say but he was cut off because in a fit of self confidence Harry had shot forward and kissed Draco Malfoy dead on the mouth, and to his surprise, Draco reciprocated. Their mouths moving against one another in tandem. They spent what could have been second or hours like that, Draco pushing Harry back against the bookcase and kissing him senseless and eventually breaking apart for air, both of them looking dazed before they jumped apart from one another, both going to speak at the same time.
Around midnight they got pretty serious and started asking him questions about his sexuality and how he knew and such but over all it was a really good night.
Eventually they managed to get off the door and stood on the first step of Number 12 Grimmauld Place. Mr Weasley offered Harry his arm and as soon as Harry took it, apparated them to a deserted muggle street. They crept down the block to an old telephone box where Mr Weasley punched in 5 numbers then held the receiver to his ear.
For all his thinking Harry arrived at the potions room with crescent moon shaped indents in his palm from his nails, and a sufficiently destroyed mood. He watched the potion for a bit and looked over the instructions in his book, adding a little bit of the next ingredient and giving it a couple stirs, and was about to head out when none other then Draco bloody Malfoy swaggered into the room looking perfect as ever.
Harry loved flying. It's one of the best feelings and if he's being honest the first time he's felt close to happy in a long time.
"Hurry up there boy! I need to eat and so does Dudley here after those demonteraters" Thundered Uncle Vernon. Reminding Harry yet again of the Dementor attack just a few nights ago that had resulted in him getting multiple letters from the Ministry Of Magic and the possibility of getting expelled from Hogwarts.
Our token baby gay runs into his crush late at night and the sexual tension could be cut with a KNIFE.
Harry had had lots of time to think this over, he had gone to the library, payed more attention to his observations, looked stuff up online, etc etc. And Harry Potter was fairly sure he was gay. Utterly and irrevocably gay. He was kinda freaked about the whole thing but he knew, at least, that he had to tell people. He decided that he would do it at dinner the next day.
Finally it was dinner and so Harry sat through it. It was both fast and unbearably slow and then before he knew it. Dinner was over. He had missed his chance.
"You can work with Mr Malfoy. I will inform him of course" he said with a smile that could rival that of a predatory fox.
"All in favour of letting the accused go and clearing him of all charges" everyone else's hands went up.
Harry crawled out of bed and got dressed in his nice clothes, he had laid them out the night before, and tried to do something with his unruly hair but ultimately gave up and went downstairs.
He'd thought he'd been getting a bit better, but as these thing tend to happen, the pressure kept mounting and eventually Harry had to do something about it so he found himself in a bathroom between classes, distractedly muttering the same cutting curse he'd been using for weeks which backfired on him because he cut a little too deep for his liking. He'd been in the middle of watching the blood flow when he heard footsteps and who should walk in but Draco bloody Malfoy, but that wasn't even the surprising part. That was the look of alarm on Draco's face when he took in the scene.
Draco Malfoy. The wonder, the joy, the knowing looks, the day's spent outside under a tree together. Those hurt the worst. Because he knew that could
The other adults looked incredibly surprised and several tried to object but Sirius would just put up his hand and they would stop.
"Oh idk. Maybe Voldemort has started to take control like we warned you he would" Harry spat angrily.
Quietly closing the door behind him, he sat down on the floor against the tub and pulled up his shirt, pointing his wand at his side and murmuring a quick cutting charm. This time the pain was sharp and he gasped a bit as he felt the sting of the cut along his side. He stood up and looked at it in the mirror for a bit, watching the blood bloom and spill onto his side, before closing it up swiftly and going back to bed feeling much more relaxed.
Obviously seeing his baffled expression she explained. "I'm a metamorphmagus. I can change any part of myself at will." She told him. "It's great for being an auror. Shame not many people have it. Now then. Let's finish this packing"
She got him cutting the potatoes for her while she went and cleaned up a bit and so he started dicing them into neat enough cubes to be roasted.
Harry is late for detention with our least favourite toad bitch and he feels the pain, literally. Ron and Hermione are protective QUEENS
Although he wasn't sure he was very comforted by her statement as she seemed to be wearing radishes from her ears and was reading a strangely coloured magazine called The Quibbler upside down. Nevertheless Harry smiled at her softly and turned away. Looks like he wouldn't be getting his answer then.
For the next week Harry went to his classes, he sat next to Draco during potions, and both of them pretended like nothing had happened. Which, Harry might like to add, was getting harder and harder by the day.
Draco sneers "believe it or not, checking on you. Have you even been eating you look like skin and bones."
"What do you mean Harry, nothings pulling the carriages. Nothing ever has..." Hermione said, a concerned edge to her voice.
Ron nodded, apparently taking this as an acceptable answer and went back to raving about the Chudley Canons.
Hermione ended up going back to her room around two and him and Ron fell asleep not long after, tired out after the exciting events of the day.
"Fuck off Malfoy" Harry muttered distractedly. No matter how mad he was at him he couldn't help but notice how his hair was swooped just right, and how that smirk was having more of an effect on him then he would like to admit.
Harry kept waiting for some sort of sign that what had happened in the potions lab that night wasn't some sort of fluke or figment of his imagination. Maybe he was just so desperate for something to happen between them that his brain created this image of something. Was that possible? Harry didn't know. What he did know was that it was pissing him off how perfect Draco bloody Malfoy was acting like nothing at all had ever happened between them. He was getting fed up with it. So the next time Draco decided to tease him, which happened to be the next Hogsmeade trip, Harry retaliated.
Harry was beginning to think about agreeing just to shut her up. He listened to her beg all the way up to the common room throwing in small comments about how it was all luck, and that he honestly didn’t know how he was still alive. Which was true he honestly had no idea. Most of the time he wished Voldemort had succeeded in his mission, that way he wouldn’t be stuck here with an unrequited crush, and Hermione trying to get him to join, and lead, a student run Defense group.
“Get back to class or I’ll write back to mummy and say you’re getting high again,” Daphne called after her sister, who gave her a rude gesture as she turned the corner. “Now,” she patted Draco’s arm, “let’s get you to the common room before the wolves come back shall we?”
“You really think that Theo and I ran off together?” Draco said as the two people turned the corner. He gave the two girls a smirk and looked them both up and down. “And you’re right Daphne he really isn’t my type.”
“Do you reckon that the couches here are less comfortable than the ones back in the old common room?” Ron asked as he tried to fluff up one of the pillows.
It seemed that the world was standing still. However, seconds after black clouds of smoke began to shoot for the sky. Likely his parents among the dark figures shooting for the sky.
“Clearly no one knows,” Harry said shaking the parchment. “I’m going to mark this one and send it back to Featherstone. Malfoy is a Death Eater after all.”
Due to his uncontrollable workload, Harry and Ginny both agreed that they would be taking some time away from one another. Also to see if that they had only gotten together due to the fact that it was wartime and Harry might possibly die.
“But he is giving the government his time you knob,” Victor said throwing a pillow at the other boy. “You stay here Draco and one day you take Roger’s fucking job. And then you tell him what to do and then there is no where else but total world domination from there!”
Draco turned to the book and nodded, “It’s amazing. I found this on the common room so I borrowed it. Have you read it?”
He stomped his foot and throw the telescope in Harry who effortlessly caught it. He’s fucking out. He glared daggers and walked out to get to the bedroom, ignoring Harry’s yell.
He smirked, “Of course, daddy. I can see how hard you are for me. Leaking and going to be so desperate to fuck me”
Whoever made him the Head of Department of fucking Mysteries made the wrong decision. He cannot even get the omega who actually caught his interest, how can they expect him to handle a whole department?
Now, she’s suddenly feeling dizzy. Jean Jacques is a famous wizard Chef across Europe. His name is very famous all around and was ranked as the most famous chef all around the Wizarding World. She gulped, taking in the surroundings. It was obvious they are in a private area and even at the simple design, it was apparent that the place is luxurious.
Remus smiled, nothing like the seriousness back at the dining. His hands continued its way up to his neck, choking him in a way his cock leaked some more.
As if on cue, the door opened and there he is with his glory. He locked the door behind him and stared at her as he moved to stand at the edge of the bed.
She began to walk around, laying the bouquet of flowers on the small dining table. The place was complete with furniture and all. The wall paints were creamy white and floors were timbre.
The breakfast the next day was awkward. Well, it was on Harry’s side. He’s sure Draco is still mad if those glares he keeps on giving him is of any indication.
Another song drop. The last one for his shift and as he turned around, gave a seductive glance to the audience, his breath hitched.
“Daddy” Draco moaned sleepily, leaning all of his weight on Harry’s chest and sighing, “Bedtime stories?”
His eyes alternated at his wrist to Draco’s for several times before chuckling, “Don’t worry, that’s just Luna”
“I’m a freelance photographer travelling from New York to Seattle when there’s a gig. And my husband’s a journalist for the local newspaper”
“Shut up. That is not what I expected when I asked you to come with me for a date” Harry responded, stopping short at a flower shop, “Let’s be romantic for tonight”
There was a an awkward cough and Draco knew it came from Harry. He might've been shock at what he heard and it's only just the beginning. Pansy seemed to tell anyone about his quest and it's fucking good when you have supportive friends.
“Are you sore?” he asked, palms gliding wetly across her back where he began to massage her, “Do you ache somewhere?”
He reminded himself that he is the heir of House of Potter and no one else. He should display and act on the same brilliance and righteousness his father did in the same way his father's father did and so on. He cannot be seduced into sleeping with an eighteen year old boy who's nothing but an irresistible tempest.
He took in her appearance, eyes glassy, her face is an ethereal gorgeousness and the way she looked back at him with that look. The look that told him he is seen as much as he’s seeing her in return.
Dean shook his head, “Only Parkinson and Malfoy. They’re hurdled over the end of Slytherin table. Look” he pointed at a direction and Harry turned to look discreetly.
“Nice to meet you too” Dracy smiled at them after shaking hands with Ron and stood beside Harry, leaning against him a bit because she’s never been comfortable with eyes all on her since everything came crushing down.
His eyes drop lower, the knowledge that the omega’s nipples are only covered by that blouse, all naked underneath is driving him nuts.
So, without further complains, he decided to wear the bracelet. The bright color surpassing his pale skin, it stands out among the rest. Especially when younger students looked at him, even though he received backhanded compliments he decided to keep it on his wrist.
Draco sat beside Zayan as Pansy put a bottle in the middle. He kept stealing Harry glances and looking out for any expression. And he relished because Harr y's face are drawn too serious for the fun that's going to take in any moment.
Draco whimpered as he closed his eyes voluntarily when Harry raised his blindfolds to his face. Tying it gently, Harry hummed, “How’s it, sweetheart? If anything’s too tight, be a good kitten and tell me, alright?”
He went back inside to find Draco still seated at the couch with legs crossed and eyes immediately glued to his.
Fuck him, dude. Just fuck the man who now hides behind winks, cheeky smiles, and flirty statements ever since the party they attended from. Those casual touches he realized he isn’t prying off to the way they just fucking had a movie night last night.
Harry bobbed his head up and down, his fingers beginning to encircle his rim. He whispered a lubricating charm and entered one finger. Draco cannot stop mewling, moaning, and whimpering. All these feelings inside him and the way Harry is driving him crazy are overwhelming in the best way possible.
Harry sighed, “The midnight sale doesn’t sit right to me. Get back to the apartment and I’ll handle this”
Draco was once again, like always, like literally always, focused on his work. Why is his sexytary always so busy? Can’t even pour him a nice attention?
They've been at the game for more than an hour now and still not once did the bottle stopped at him. Harry is grateful for that because he wouldn't like to see him do sensual things with other people especially when he had seen the obscene things that are dared to a victim.
He’s a stripper for fuck’s sake. Harry is Harry. Why would Draco wants more if Harry already generously booked him for the entire night?
He raised an eyebrow when he saw her fingers casually caressing a man’s shoulders, gliding them smoothly along his expensive robes and the feigned innocence in her face as she began to converse with the man. She made sure to stick her left thigh in the view, calling the attention of the available bachelors around them.
“I saw you in Daily Prophet and I knew I j-just have to s-see you. Tell you how sorry I am for the things I have done”
“I love you so fucking much. I would spend the rest of our lives planning effortful dates, carefully romantic ones. Will you marry me?” he was so sincere, looking so hopeful but also nervous. Never in Draco’s life had he ever seen Harry’s usual stern demeanor turn into some sort of a scared puppy.
Draco then lifted his head to nuzzle at Harry's nape and had the urge to bit him and mark him with his teeth.
Draco once again ignored him and Harry sighed, “I’ll leave it here” he laid the potion on the floor so Draco would get them when he wants to and he turned to leave, wanting to go to his bedroom and write a letter to Sirius or Remus instead.
Harry stood in front of them and observed how they look while Ron stood beside him. Messy, healing bruises, and a little bloody which he had concluded they had already went to St. Mungos to have their wounds healed up.
“Fuck, fuck, I’m cumming” Harry whispered, pulling out almost completely and pushing back in. His arms shook slightly as his hips stilled, releasing his own inside Draco’s tight heat.
He can swing his wand, perfectly perform out curses when it's necessary and can hex like hell. And besides, it's not like he's gonna be attacked right?
Last night when he was lying in bed, he thought of Draco staying in the other room just across the bedroom he's staying in. He wondered what Draco was doing and wondered if he was thinking him in the same sensual way Harry did. He didn't even had a good night sleep because Draco, bless the young boy, had managed to appear on his dreams and fuck, his image is so fucking good. Looking at him seductively, and those eyes that's convincing him to step closer, touch those sexy legs and have him writhing underneath.
Draco rolled his eyes and came, feeling the wetness on his stomach and slid down to the bed. And the way all of him seemed to dissolve in pleasure. Harry didn’t halt as he fucked him through his orgasm and it only take three more thrusts and Harry was coming.
Draco chanted like a mantra. To say the lunch was good is an understatement. It was rather intense and confusing. Would he really want to stop this engagement from happening?
“We’re not that kind of couple, you dog” Lucius said with a defeated sigh. Turning to look at the Cissy’s cousin who managed to get an appointment with the man he’s talking about.
Harry clenched his jaw, closing his eyes and opening them a second or two after, he pulled out and held her by the waist. Dracy felt the chilling sensation of a cleaning charm all over her as she watched him helped her under the blankets.
“Baby, fuck” Harry moaned, quickly removing her dress and his eyes darkened upon the sight of her lingerie greeting him in view. The way his cock throbbed rhythmically against her pussy has her bobbing even more.
“Everything’s good?” he whispered, pushing her head nearer to his and inhaled her which did its magic to calm down frustrations he was feeling a while back, “If I touch you now, will you get mad?”
“Ssh. It’s okay” harry murmured, one of his hands coming up to cup her by her cheek, “Take care of you now”
Hermione spared him a glance before exchanging knowing stares with Harry, “Actually, we do. There’s this charity for orphan children this weekend. You should come”
They took a deep breath as they stayed on their position. Draco leaned his body on him and slid his palms up and down Harry’s chest. For a while, they relished on their silence, giving them ample time to decide what to say to the other.
“Shall we get this?” Dracy murmured and Harry hummed, eyes glaring at the people who’s brave enough to spare them second glance.
She shook her head before she grabbed his hand and intertwined it with his, “I-I’m just. . . I’m just so h-happy”
"Get in the motor. We're going back" he ignored the way Draco whined in protest as he straddled the motor and waited for him to follow.
"I was hired to guard the Malfoy heir, Mom" Harry informed his mother just as he finished packing up his clothes.
“You’re gorgeous, you’re savage that it stabs me straight to the heart and would love to spank you for all the slaps you gave me” he winked and Draco found himself slightly fidgeting in his seat..
"I have parties to attend. I don't need an Auror to guard me. I can guard myself just fine, thank you very much" he sarcastically said and rolled his eyes.
He smiled and thanked him by pecking a kiss on his lips. He took the narcissus flower close to his nose and inhaled, “I applaud your lack of originality, Potter. But it’s corny. Anyway, is this to represent my mother?”
This, right here, at the eyes of the sun slowly creeping inside the bedroom, the comfort of the whole place, and under Harry’s languid sucking, meant mornings is not just another day but a blessing, a gift.
“What?!” he snapped at smirking Pansy who shrugged with a playful whistle like she knows something he doesn't.
He stood just behind Draco and run his fingertips on the transparent dress he wore, feeling Draco shuddered and moaned, “Don’t you think we should remove this?” Harry whispered.
“I’m cumming. I’m cumming H-harry” he stated and moaned, he closed his eyes and loved it when Harry roughly took his fingers out and slid it back in rougher than ever. Rougher than he could ever be and surely is able to topple him forward if not for his weight restricting him.
He tried not to think whether he’s excited or unexcited with the idea because seeing Harry. Well, from his physical appearance, sure, Muggle Prince. But the attitude? Not so.
They were enjoying a fun time at dinner, ignoring all around them as McGonagall and Flitwick inspect the tree with critical judgment. Draco knew then they are doomed but that’s to expect if the Headmistress and the Professor literally hired the disaster squad.
Harry jumped as if he was burned when he felt a hand smacking his arm. Malfoy snatched the juices without looking and added it to the cauldron while muttering under his breath, “Can’t even focus”
The Aurors perked up and looked at him straight in the eyes hoping for some serious announcement, “I love how dedicated you all are but I think I’d prefer if you go get your own life for a bit. Enjoy, loosen up. You'll find yourself happy”
“Oh, I certainly will” he answered before gently laying her into the bed and opening her thighs wide.
“Come” Harry whispered and within a second, she trembled, her back arched and her eyes rolled at the back of her head. Her nails roughly dig into his skin and she may also have left some bruises.
He was coming! He nearly exploded! Why must he fell from his bed and wake the fuck up?! Really? That was the most delicious wet dream he can ever have in his life and it was cut off?!
“Why?” he asked in whispery tone, his raging hard on flagged down a little, confusion ebbing in his system.
“Don’t you want me?” his voice broke and Harry clenched his jaw. Does he really have to answer that? He should’ve just take on Ron’s offer to go to a bar with the other Aurors he didn’t yell at.
Harry turned to look at Draco, wandering over his mind and recalled some things that said before. Trying for one last time, “Professor, we’re happy and it’s Christmas.  But we cannot stop thinking  what really happened to us?”
He sighed and bit on Draco’s shoulder as he took his time stretching the boy. He murmured some compliments but he wasn’t even aware how it sounded but he made sure to sound saccharine and it did everything to drive Draco insane with need.
“Do you seduce every Auror that guarded you?” he asked, currently massaging Draco’s shoulders, “Do you get them to your bed?”
Harry smirked before shoving his hand away from his face, not bothering to know what Draco is trying to show him, “You look gorgeous”
Hmm. It’s worth the try, isn’t it? Well, it’s not like he tried in the first place. He haven’t got his dick out yet.
Once, Harry may have acted cheesy but in the end, opted to spank him because soft is not really Harry’s thing. If Harry’s good with anything like boy, that would be how to be deliciously rough.
He stumbled back when someone grabbed his luggage and he turned around, ready to run his machine gun because his ass is so fucking done.
She lied in her bed while also moaning in pain. She can handle her heat before with the help of potions but now that she didn’t take any, she can feel it full force. The need to have something buried inside her, arms around her, kisses on her lips, and Harry’s scent. She needs it all.
Harry only grinned before dipping his head down, lips ghosting over his own, body covering his. Draco felt sweat forming his temple as he clenched his hands. He gripped Harry’s shirt tight, the need to leave but also to stay too strong.
Draco moaned, fighting the urge to moan his name and beg already. He kept his mind not to say a word as he was instructed to. Even though he wanted to challenge the man, the sooner this is over, he’ll get to snoop around and be done with this stealing stuff.
He can do broken Renaissance phrases, medieval sentences, or even misquote Shakespeare. Anything to make that omega blush and give in with the cravings he have not discovered yet but Harry can see.
Draco’s mouth opened in realization. He didn’t expect they’ll be broaching the subject. He thought it was just him, the thing that felt churning and twisting but painless. He thought he dreamt it or even just imagined it.
He walked out of the room and went to the kitchen to make himself some coffee. He took a seat at the terrace to pass some time and spy on Tom’s apartment with the excuse of just basking in the morning sun cascading over his spot.
“I-I know that,” he sighed, “Draco and I inhaled some” he chose to say the truth, knowing the two wouldn’t judge or nag him about it in the way Hermione would’ve.
It was when she was walking back to the dining when she saw Harry prepared a nice candlelit dinner for the both of them, claiming it is for moment he planned. Just a simple one, nothing to extravagant but for her, it’s as extravagant as it could be.
He was confused when he found himself at the hospital wing. Memories of what happened came rushing in his mind as he nervously looked around. His hand scrambled to touch his body, from his temple to his neck down to his stomach, making sure all of his body parts are still intact from the accident.
He nodded and nodded, already wanting Harry to fuck his pussy fast and nice. Praise him again and again for being such a good baby.
Having an impulsive idea is dangerous but more often than not, in her case, they end up more entertaining than she expected.
He guided Dracy to sit down at the cushion before he settled behind her, each foot on both of her sides as he protectively cradled her stomach. They were facing the whole city, the lights, the beauty of the night.
