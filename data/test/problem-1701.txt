Malfoy pulls back a little and watches him carefully.  It's the first time Harry's seen him look less than completely confident.
Having garnered the information he wanted, Draco felt he could afford a little graciousness.  "Thank you,
.  But what difference does that make?  Are you saying that single people are basically doomed to live alone unless they can find someone to marry them?"
He watched Draco as he chopped and stirred, then turned his attention to the rest of the flat.  "Looks like you've settled in properly now."
Harry crossed the room into the conservatory and looked around. It really was impressive, and completely unexpected.
Harry started in surprise; he could practically feel Draco's breath ghosting over his nape.  He turned around slowly, and even though he was expecting it, Harry was still surprised by just how close Draco now was.  "What?" he asked, wincing at how hoarse his voice sounded.
A matching flush coloured Harry’s face – he’d never learned to take a compliment with grace.  “I don’t know about that,” he muttered.
Hermione watched until he was only a few steps away, apparently distrusting, before returning to floor level. She didn't leave the hall, though, and waited for Harry to enter the living room first before she followed – door closing firmly in her wake.
Draco did enjoy a flushed Potter, that was true – all that righteous indignation was rather appealing, not that wild Thestrals would drag that admission from him. "I'll see what I can do," he said. "You're assuming it will be Potter and not your dear husband who comes up?"
"Then what you need to do is make sure he isn't." Blaise sat back in his chair, grin firmly fixed back on his face.
"Honestly, I don't know yet. I'm sure I'll think of something." Harry wasn't sure he believed that, but it wasn't like he needed the wages desperately. It might actually be nice to take some time out for himself.
But there were beady eyes watching him, so Harry took a steadying breath, pulled back his shoulders and strode towards the door with more outward bravery than he felt.
"I'll have one of those as well," Potter said without further hesitation.  "Only make mine well done, please."
Hannah placed his drink on the bar and just smiled in return.  “Well, to be fair, I wouldn’t exactly expect you to be looking for Draco either.”  She paused then, and a slight frown creased her brow.  “You’re not going to start anything, are you?  Because—”
Malfoy looked up then, expression carefully neutral.  “I’m not a Muggle.  Is it so wrong to want my own community to recognise my rights?”
repeated ad nauseum, and then followed up by a noise that sounded uncommonly like a honking sea lion.”
But then Harry saw what Draco saw and the knot in his chest vanished completely.  First there was Hermione, resplendent in her bridal gown, and she just beamed – clearly as happy for them as she was for her own nuptials.   Theo merely raised an eyebrow at them speculatively and then gave a brief nod.  Restrained thought it may have seemed to most, from reticent Theo this was as close to a ringing endorsement as Harry knew they were likely to get.
Draco couldn't quite find the words to express just how ridiculous and untrue that statement was – though it was clear from Pansy's expression she knew that herself already.  Instead, Draco turned his mind to wondering if it was too late to take Blaise up on his offer of that Skiing holiday – apparently Switzerland was rather lovely at this time of year.
Malfoy was clearly more at home than the rest of them, as he ushered them confidently towards the fitting rooms.
"I think it's a great idea." Pansy seemed to have caught Ron's enthusiasm, though Harry didn't recall her being a particular fan back at school. "We'll go, won't we, Draco?"
Before he could question what she meant, Teddy repeated his earlier actions, only on his grandma this time.  “Is it Cousin Draco?” He bounced excitedly as he clung to her legs.  “Is he comin?”
Harry sat back in his chair and crossed one leg over the other. "Honestly, everyone just assumed it was what I wanted, and I couldn't think of anything else, so rather than disappoint them…"
Draco looked up then. His smile was weak, but a smile nonetheless. "I hate you, Potter," he said, but the way he leant in said otherwise.
Malfoy doesn’t snigger – of course he doesn't – but when Harry chances a look in his direction finally, there's a smirk on his face and Harry just knows there's no way this will end well.
— and dragged him downstairs, through the kitchen, towards the cellar. Dank and musty, and completely unused since the Black wine collection had run dry, Harry had never used the room. He hadn't bothered to suggest Malfoy touch it either. It wasn't like he was short of the space.
“I want you to be my best man,” Neville blurted out suddenly before that line of conversation could progress any further.  “Will you...I mean, I’d really like if...”
Ron, however, had grown up with two very forceful women, had dated numerous others, and  wasn't fazed in the slightest.  "Just that I never thought I'd see the day
Hermione started in surprise at the new arrival, and Harry was left wondering at the alertness of his Auror senses, if he'd managed to miss the approach of so imposing a personage as Blaise.
Harry laughed.  “I’m not Hermione, Ron.  I know what the grin means, and I also know that Draco will kill you if you start hitting on his best friend.”
"But that's good, isn't it?"  Pansy placed a hand gently on his knee.  "I mean, I know you said you were over Potter, but you weren't fooling either of us.  At least now you'll be happy."
"Thought you'd change your mind at the last minute," Ron confessed.  "It's not really your scene, is it?"
The moment was broken then as they were ushered into the back room where a table of delicious looking samples awaited them.  Harry’s stomach rumbled again and he flushed in embarrassment.
"Yes, well I spent a year there," Malfoy replied, evidently taking that as Harry's answer.  "So you can imagine how keen I am to go back."
"You're bored," Malfoy replied, like it was the most obvious thing in the world. "You wander around this house like some kind of lost soul because you have no purpose."
Harry grinned.  "Yeah, something like that.  He drives me crazy with his snide little comments on everything I do, but then I remember how he died and I feel like a complete git.  I mean, he's stuck in that picture forever, now."
Harry had no trouble imagining that, and to be fair, there was more than a grain of truth in it. The garden was long neglected – mainly because Harry never went out there. Before leaving the Aurors, Harry had spent little time inside the house, never mind the garden. But he couldn't deny the small thrill that ran through him at the prospect now. It seemed like Malfoy was anticipating needs that even Harry didn't know existed.
Harry grinned and kissed him again.  "Then you'll understand why I have no intention of waiting any longer."
Before Draco had chance to speak, Potter nodded in the direction of the two unused beds.  "Are they—"
They parted for a moment, barely a hair's breadth apart. "I was beginning to think you'd never get round to doing that."
Harry shrugged, hoping it appeared somewhat nonchalant.   He hated this part.  "You did," he replied.  "After the trial."
Narcissa fell silent then.  She reached for a grapefruit and proceeded to consume each sliver with delicate precision.
"Besides," Pansy continued blithely, "You know Lucius would never hear of it.  My name's worth about as much as yours is right now – there'd be nothing for him to gain from it."
They had only a few seconds warning as the Floo burst into life.  Draco took that time to decide if it was worse to be caught like this, or to pull away and risk having his mother see the erection that was undoubtedly tenting his trousers.
Malfoy watched him intently for a moment, as if to test the truth of his words, and then began speaking softly. "After the war, there were a lot of bad memories in the manor."
Kreacher looked unimpressed – Harry had yet to meet his exacting standards of how a 'proper wizard' should behave.
"See." Ron turned a brief, triumphant expression on Hermione, and then loaded another forkful of meat and pastry. "So, I was thinking maybe you could talk to her for me."
Draco was almost certain he saw the faintest hint of a flush on Potter's cheeks – but the dim lighting in the restaurant prevented him from confirming it.  He didn't reply straight away, preferring instead to sample the crushed potatoes adorning his plate.
Harry didn't even need to answer though.  Draco had, apparently, seen the expression on his face enough times by now to know what it meant. "I'm sorry," he muttered, head hung.
As they headed towards the changing rooms, arms piled with clothing, Draco resumed his earlier topic.   "Why is he even here anyway?"
"No, no, nothing like that," Hermione said hurriedly.  "Sorry, I didn't mean to alarm you.  It's just that we're bringing the wedding forward, so it seems a bit unnecessary to have an engagement party as well."
Draco didn't mean to laugh but he really couldn't stop himself. "This isn't school anymore, Harry. Besides," he said, allowing a hint of hurt to colour his tone. "I thought we were past that now. I'd rather hoped we'd become friends."
They were at the table before Harry had managed to come up with a way of breaking the news to Ron.  Malfoy hung back slightly, as if unsure of his welcome.  Pansy appeared to have no such concerns.
Pansy’s words came back to him then and everything fell into place.  He came to a sudden halt in the middle of the floor.  “I should…” he gestured towards the door.
"You can say her name."  Harry tried to keep the exasperation out of his tone.  "It's been months now, and I'm not in bloody mourning!"  It was Harry's turn to look guilty then, but as he opened his mouth to apologise, George waved him off.
"Mind?" Harry frowned. "Mind what?" He looked around the entrance way again and within seconds had his answer. There, all up the stairs wall, in a variety of different sized frames, were
“Well,” Ron said, “I might not be much for cooking, but there’s one thing I learned growing up with mum, and that’s how to peel veg.  Let me just go and dump this bag in my room, and then I’ll come give you a hand.”
"Things change."  Harry raked one hand through his hair in agitation.  "Your sexuality, for starters."
business, well, I hate to be the one to break it to you, but I think your chances of actually getting it up for a woman are fairly remote."
The sound of a chair scraping across the floor pulled Draco from his musings.  He looked up and found Potter smiling down at him.  And damn, if Potter didn't look like he should be on the menu himself.  Not as formally dressed as Draco by any stretch, but the trousers fit in all the right places, and Draco's fingers itched to see if that jumper was as soft as it looked.
Draco wasn't sure if he should be worried by Potter's level of interest in their friends' activities, but for now he chose to focus on something else.  "Ooh, someone's been teaching Potty big words," he teased.
Hence his bleary eyed condition when he finally made it down to the kitchen for breakfast.  He dismissed Kreacher's offers of toast or porridge, opting instead for several strong cups of coffee, drunk under the disapproving gaze of his house-elf.
"Then pick another room." Malfoy ran a free hand through his hair, exasperation clear in both his tone and expression. "Merlin knows you've got enough of them. Or if you must be in here,
"How's life at the Ministry these days, Potter." Draco paused, smiled wryly, and then amended, "Sorry. Harry."
Harry grimaced at the reminder.  His plans needed some adjustment in the face of Neville’s reluctance.
"For the love of Merlin, please don't ever finish that sentence.  I saw enough last night to last a life time."
Blaise sat upright and gave her hand a gentle pat.  “C’mon, how about I take you for a proper lunch, instead of this muck?”
"I thought he'd forgiven you for that."  Pansy reached out and brushed an imaginary piece of lint off Draco's shoulder.  "And if he has, then it's not fair of him to keep throwing it back in your face."
"I can't promise I won't," Harry said honestly. "But I'll never do it intentionally. People in relationships hurt each other sometimes. It's what happens."
, or ask about his plans for the future.  And what Harry really needed right now was to be around someone who didn't keep asking
Malfoy dumped the box on the old kitchen table and fixed Harry with a steely gaze. "Tell me, Potter," he began in a deceptively calm voice. "When you said you didn't have a hobby, had you forgotten about this little box of tricks, or were you just lying to me?" Words finished, he tipped the box on its side and spilled the contents onto the table's surface.
"It's my job," Draco said.  He slung one arm around Harry's shoulder.  "Now cheer up," he instructed.  "It's not the end of the world – we'll just have to work a bit harder at this."
Draco just nodded - really, what else could he do?  Aurora Zabini was notorious the wizarding world over.  The only wonder was that she could still find willing...victims.
Suddenly two and two added up to four for Harry.  "Hermione," he said tersely, then shook his head.  He really should have known something was going on when she suggested what colour jumper he wear that evening.
"I'm not suggesting you marry the bloke, for Merlin's sake.  He's here for a few weeks, so maybe you go out a couple of times, have a bit of fun, a few drinks, and then..."
Harry placed his hands firmly on Draco’s waist – he wasn’t letting go now – and grinned.  “Well, we have to save something for the second date, don’t we?”
Draco promptly slung one arm around Harry's shoulder and pulled him close.  "And a two-headed one at that, Weasley," he chipped in.
Really, Harry wanted nothing more than to go back upstairs and bury himself under the duvet and hide out until this evening was over.  He knew that wasn't an option though.  Hermione would never forgive him.
Pansy Parkinson emerged from the shadows around the house, her face lit by the glow from her cigarette.  "Don't look so worried," she said calmly.  "It's nothing I didn't already know.  Draco couldn't keep a secret to save his life."
The sight of Draco on his door step, all dressed up in his finest, seems to wipe the ability to speak or move from Harry's conscious brain. Fortunately, Draco has never been backward in coming forward.
Snape's gaze narrows in a way that transports Harry right back to Potions class.  "Neither you nor I know that to be the case.  Draco has a right to know and to make the choice for himself.  Whatever that may be.
"I'm not sure the no would hurt any less," Harry admits, and something clenches painfully in his chest as if to bear out the truth of his words.
"Really."  The disbelief in her tone was hard to miss, and just like earlier with Ron, Harry bristled.  "Yes, really.  Why would I lie?"
Draco suppressed a smile at this.  Normally his mother wouldn't be caught eating anywhere so Gryffindorish as
"Don't you have a husband to get home to?"  It was said good-naturedly, but Draco fancied he saw a spark of possessiveness and it caused a flare of
Ginny was the only person he'd voiced his worries too, and Harry had no doubt that she'd kept his counsel.   Since their last chat, Harry had been working hard to figure out not just who he was, but also on learning to accept it – and on current evidence he seemed to be doing quite well.  In the end, Harry had decided not to over think things – he liked who he liked, regardless of their gender.  As the
As his eyes travelled further around the table, Harry noticed that Hermione was also watching him.  She looked at him intently and gave a discreet nod in the direction of the window.  Glancing outside, Harry realised that it had gone dark already – the conversation had flowed so well over dinner that afternoon had faded into night before any of them had noticed.  He gave her an almost imperceptible nod of acknowledgement.  No one else noticed this exchange, so the others thought nothing of it when Hermione excused herself from the table only moments later.
Harry leant forward so his lips were a hair’s breadth away from Draco’s ears.  “You’ll see,” he murmured, and did not miss the shiver that ran through Draco’s body in response.
"Not at the moment," he says, and then gives a wry grin.  2I just can't seem to find the right man."
Harry had been sceptical before about the possibility of Pansy's alleged attraction – after all, she had turned Ron down every single time he'd asked. But this definitely sounded like flirting, even to Harry's less than experienced ears. And judging from the heat currently radiating from his face, Ron agreed.
be dancing this evening, Harry Potter. I spent all last Saturday searching for a dress that did look like something we camped in the New Forest in, and it's
Pansy opened her mouth as if to protest Draco giving her orders, but then shut it just as quickly.  "Fine," she said, her tone begrudging.  "But don't fuck this up."
Despite his initial concerns, over the last few weeks Harry had found that living with Malfoy had gone surprisingly smoothly.  Malfoy was certainly easier to live with than he’d expected, and Harry couldn't deny how much better he felt having another person in the house again.  It stopped the walls from closing in quite so much.
If Ron had expected remorse, he was to be sorely disappointed.  Ginny simply grinned and gave a brief nod.  "Yes, and I'll do it again if you don't stop being an arse.  So Harry's friends with Malfoy – who cares?  And yes, Hermione's sneaking around with Terry Boot and thinks we're all too dumb to notice, but that's hardly any concern of yours anymore, is it, Ronald?"
Harry knew Ron meant well, but the sympathy in his best friend's eyes only made him feel worse.  "Fine."  Harry gave as nonchalant a shrug as he could mange.  "Why shouldn't I be?"
It was said pleasantly enough but, after twenty-five years of experience, Draco knew the warning was implicit.  Obviously his mother's senses weren't as dulled as he'd thought.
as well, don't you worry," Draco replied.  "But first we need to go shopping.  You activated that Portkey before I could grab the bag I'd packed, and I refuse to spend a weekend in Paris with only a Weasley jumper to my name."
"Don't worry about Ron," George continued as he turned towards the fireplace.  "He'll get used to it."
Draco nodded.  "Guilty," he confirmed.  "Don't worry, I picked you up some as well."  He was rewarded for his troubles by a beatific smile.
Blaise dropped into the chair at Hermione's side, pecked a quick kiss to her cheek, before grinning broadly at the rest of them. "So, what are we talking about?"
Draco stifled a slightly hysterical laugh.  He knew exactly how his father got, and he rather suspected that the next time Draco visited Azkaban, Lucius would have rather more to worry about than his wife's sudden predilection for Muggle department stores.  "You look like you bought the whole of Harrods," he observed, mentally reckoning up just how much of a dent his mother had made in their vault.
"Malfoy."  Harry acknowledged him with a nod, then stepped backwards as he realised how close he was standing.  "This is one of the last places I would have expected to see you."
Harry did know that. The Ministry had made it perfectly clear how much they wanted 'Harry Potter' on their books when they'd offered to waive NEWT requirements at the end of the war. Harry had refused special treatment then, and he didn't want it now.
"No." Harry hadn't even heard Malfoy enter the room behind him. "You are. We've already discussed this."
Malfoy laughed.  “You’re not wrong.  I’ve roped Mother in to deal with her.  She’s much better with temperamental old ladies.”
"Where's Draco?" Pansy's tone was just a little sharp as she set Harry's fresh pint in front of him. "You haven't upset him, have you?"
"I'm getting married, Potter.  It's what my parents want, and there's nothing you can say that's going to change that."
Draco couldn't help it, his eyes automatically drifted to the subject of their conversation.  "I hadn't noticed," he said distractedly.
Auror Kettlewell makes his way around the room, testing their bonds.  Harry's never minded him before – he was one of the more reasonable tutors in Auror training – but he's definitely rethinking his opinion now.
There was a flurry of loud exclamations in the wake of Hermione's pronouncement.  Harry, for his part, fixed her with a glare.  "We did not."
Harry rolled his eyes.  He'd known introducing George to Muggle pop-culture would come back to bite him in the arse.  "Just remember I still have to buy your present," Harry warned.  "So be nice."
What if Draco was just being polite, not wanting to offend him by shrugging off his hand?  What if Pansy hadn’t been there when they got home?  What if Draco came out of that room and pinned him down on the worktop right now?
“That’s nice of you.”  Harry didn’t mention he knew exactly how much of the wedding Draco was actually paying for.  The Malfoy of old would doubtless have bragged loudly, but this was Draco, and there was something very attractive about his modest generosity.
Of course, the trouble with wanting to remain invisible was that it meant Harry couldn't enter the tower until some else came out.   A couple of words escaped his mouth that would have had Mrs Weasley cuff his ear had she heard, and then Harry settled back reluctantly against the wall.
"But you spent the night in the dungeons right?" Ron carried out as if Harry hadn't spoken.  "I mean, you weren't here when I woke up."
"So do I," Theo commented.  "You do realise you've invited a slob into your house, don't you?"  Ignoring Draco's protests, he continued addressing Harry.  "You might actually want to rethink keeping one of those elves."
Draco knew his mother had thought no such thing.  It was just her discreet way of chastising his lateness
But ten minutes later when Malfoy was ordering them in and out of dressing rooms, running his critical eye over their form, Harry did start to reconsider.
He turned his attention then, somewhat reluctantly, to his best friend.  Harry had always worried that if,
Harry’s stomach sank as he saw where the conversation was heading.   He followed Pansy’s gaze to where Draco was still with Hermione, only now he was frowning slightly in their direction.
"Fair enough, " he says, then produces his wand and slips his free hand around Malfoy's waist.  There's just time to see Malfoy's eyes widen with something before the world around them shifts, and they're outside Grimmauld Place.
"I fail to see how it affects you."  Draco tried to keep the irritation out of his voice – he knew Blaise was only being a friend – but this was none of his business.
With a flush that was visible even in the dimly lit room, Potter slid to the edge of the sofa and started to get up.  Draco's hand shot out and took hold of his arm, even before he had time to think about his actions.
"What are you, my pimp?" Harry asked incredulously.  "Are you seriously suggesting that I shag Blaise Zabini?"
The swell of the music as it reached out to every corner of the building gave Harry goose bumps.  He didn’t fully understand it, but he could hear the pathos and emotion resonating loud and clear with every note and as he looked to the side, could see it reflected in Draco’s face also.
Her tone sounded affected and girlish, or at least it did to Harry's ears, and he found himself irrationally irritated by it.  Malfoy appeared not to mind though, because he smiled indulgently and patted her hand on his arm.
A very real knot of fear twisted in Harry's belly at these words, but he squashed it firmly. This was Hermione. How bad could it be? "Okay," he said, and placed his own glass down as well – no sense in breaking her best crystal if it was bad news.
"I don't think," Draco snapped, more than a little irritated with the conversation.  He was doing his best not to think about Blaise and Harry, or about the prospect of seeing them in each other’s arms on the dance floor later that night.  "I know."
“Don’t ask me,” Harry shrugged.  “Last I heard they were at each other’s throats because Ron walked in on her naked.”
"What if we have to piss?"  It's Ron, of course, and because it's Ron, it comes out louder than intended.
"I'll tell you how it's my business, Potter." There was something oh-so-familiar in the way Malfoy said his surname that time. "You employed me to redesign this house, which I'm trying to do. But it's a bit bloody hard when you keep chasing my elves out of the room because you want to wallow in self-pity."
Harry reached into his back pocket and then slid a car catalogue across the table.  "Because," he said, jabbing a finger on the shiny paper, "I just bought one of these."
"You must be looking forward to it."  Harry counts out the required number of shrivelfig into a jar and smiles warmly at Mrs Morrison.  Mostly they're a wholesale supplier nowadays – Hogwarts and St Mungo's are two of their biggest contracts – but Neville had been keen to retain the smaller, more personal service that
Honeydukes wasn't his favourite shop for nothing, and within less than a minute of their entrance Draco had weaved his way through the crowded shop and was clutching several boxes of their finest chocolates.
He really should stop Ron hanging around with Draco so much, Harry reflected.  For all that people considered him to be the archetypal Gryffindor, every now and again there would be these bursts of Slytherin-like manipulation - and even though Harry knew exactly what his best friend was up to, he found himself being sucked in nonetheless.
Harry slid his free arm around Draco's waist, his fingertips slipping teasingly just inside the waistband of Draco's trousers.  "Work driving you to drink?" he asked.
“I can’t till they do,” Harry answered, with a rueful look in the direction of the living room.  “I thought everyone would be having an early night so I volunteered to sleep on the sofa bed.”
A quick glance at the clock had Harry shifting guiltily.  “Of course I came.  You’re my favourite person in the whole world.”
"Don't think you're getting of that easily, Harry Potter.  You'll have fun this year if it kills me.  Or you."
Harry nodded in return, and decided on reflection that however bad things were for him, he wouldn't trade places with Ron right now for anything.
It was a sign of how much his parents had changed recently that she didn't even bat an eyelid at the mess.
Hermione quickly emerged, followed swiftly by her husband.  Before either of them spoke, their eyes were automatically drawn to something behind him.  Harry turned around to follow their glance, and saw they had noticed the six foot, Norwegian spruce currently residing in the bay window.
"It's not so much can't," Harry said, and cast one last glance at the arse in question.  "It's more usually
And a Draco Malfoy currently wearing the very distinctive maroon robes of Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes at that.
Draco had to admit the jumper certainly wasn't as garish as the ones he remembered seeing Ron wear at school.  It was a lovely soft, black knit, with a silvery-grey 'D' on the front, and if Draco was being honest, he was forced to admit it did feel rather nice against his skin.  "Maybe this time next year you'll have one of your very own," Draco teased.
Ron had a dopey grin on his face and was clearly remembering things Harry would rather never hear of.  "She's amazing.  I mean, she's still a complete bitch when she wants, but she does this thing with—"
Harry felt hands on his shoulders, shaking him, pulling him from the nightmare that had him in its grip.
Harry shrugged, because he really wasn't sure.  "He said to ask him again tomorrow if i was serious."
"Not a word, Potter."  Malfoy sat down and wrapped his hands promptly around the steaming mug of coffee in his place.  He watched Harry over the brim with narrowed eyes, almost as if he could read his thoughts.
"C'mon, Hermione, it was just that one time.  And you managed to talk the Centaurs around eventually.  How was Draco supposed to know that they could understand French?"
"You really can't handle your drink, can you," Draco teased.  "I don't know why you insist on trying to keep up with the rest of us."
"Uh, thank you." Harry entered and looked around warily, expecting a trap. Maybe Draco lying in wait with a particularly vicious hex. Surely she couldn't be welcoming him in after what he'd done to her son?
Hermione just smiled.  "You'll be fine.  Just make sure you give those to him.  No hiding them down the back of the sofa."  Harry tried his best to look injured at the accusation, but it was a little hard to manage when he knew she spoke from past experience.  "Talking of Ron," she continued, "I bumped into him yesterday."
Draco looked from his mother to the main doors which were less than fifteen feet away and just arched one brow.
"Nah, mate."  Ron had the smuggest of grins plastered on his face.  "Kreacher's got a real soft spot for me just lately.  He's only too happy to serve
Potter's lips trailed their way down Draco's neck, placing hot, open-mouthed kisses against the sensitive skin.  And all the while he rocked his body against Draco's. Draco found himself biting down on his bottom lip in an effort to stifle what he was sure would be a most unmanly whimper, but he couldn't stop himself from arching off the bed, pushing his body  even more firmly against Potter's.
"I didn't."  Hermione didn't turn away from the mirror as she applied her makeup – but Harry could see the faint blush in her reflection.
Malfoy's expression was a mixture of relief and wry amusement at Harry's response, and he obviously decided it was safe to continue.  "I was glad we were freed, obviously.  But no one likes to be beholden, Potter, and especially not to someone they once considered an enemy."
Draco, however, had no intention of letting go.  He saw something familiar in the stubborn set of Potter's jaw that both thrilled and concerned him in equal measure.  "I don't want you to go," he said finally, having had to fight several deep-seated instincts to get the words out.
Harry murmured his agreement but was finding it a little hard to think.  He checked the Warming Charm was still active and then set the bag to one side.
Malfoy began pacing slowly around the room, fingers trailing over various furnishings as he went. "So," he said finally, "If that is Granger's contribution to the décor, is the rest of it down to you?"
A whooshing noise from the Floo interrupted any further conversation, and after what appeared like a tussle in the grate, both Blaise and Ron appeared, bearing numerous bags and cartons.  Seconds later they were followed by Hermione and Pansy.
And also, the fact that Draco was now getting to see firsthand the effort Potter really was putting in to his work, he no longer resented Slughorn's occasional gushing outburst quite so much.
the time came, the barrier of Draco's surname would just be too much for Ron to surmount.    But Harry had underestimated his friend again.  Yes, Ron looked uncomfortable, and was obviously trying to hide his face in Pansy's hair, but for a split second their eyes met and that told Harry all he needed to know.
house, and if you keep this up you'll be the one leaving." But apparently Harry had spent too long in Malfoy's company of late – his rants and glares had lost what little effectiveness they had.
Draco leant forward and placed his glass on the bar alongside Harry's.  "Sadly not.  She was feeling a little under the weather."
There was just the faintest hint of bitterness present, a hint of something Draco had hoped they were long past, or at least had a mutual understanding never to refer to again.  "Pansy, I don't wa—"
"Fine."  Hermione closed the oven door with a bang.  "You're helping because you're a very good friend, and because you don't want me to tell Ron what you got up to in this very kitchen last night."
Malfoy was atop a ladder, hanging curtains. The stretch as he reached upwards displayed the long lines of his lean body. When Harry managed to separate the body from who it belonged to, he could admit it really was rather fit. Malfoy had definitely grown up well – Harry was certain he hadn't had an arse like that back at Hogwarts, or Harry would have figured out his bisexuality a lot sooner.
“They were strict and absurd, and feared a lot of things they didn’t know,” he settled on. “And they hadn’t been exposed to music, or what little they had been exposed to had been very bad, and so they just didn’t approve of it in general. And I didn’t make a fuss – it wasn’t like I knew what I was missing, after all.”
“You do that,” Kenny said, starting to clean the table as Draco rolled into his room. He moved over into a soft chair and leaned against the headrest. How had he not known until today how angry he was? It seemed impossible, and yet he was sure it was true. Still, here it was, burning, and he was still somehow who he had been then, trying to make his father proud, his father who had dangled continued fatherly love in front of him as bait.
“I was there. I couldn’t do anything, but I saw someone whose character, to use your words, well, just refused to do what the mind wanted, or thought it wanted.”
Sometimes, the letter continued, people returned to their old lives before they were fully well, but this was likely to just start the illness up again. The recommendation to the patient was to remain in the muggle world a year after perceived full recovery. Then the importance of keeping the statute of secrecy was emphasised.
Also, as I have mentioned before, this story is own-voices. That means that writing some parts is pushing my own buttons really hard too.
“Actually, I do sort of understand about not feeling the choice at all, um, I just… made different choices. And I still think, honestly, that those choices say something about our characters. It’s like it’s our character and not the mind making the choice in the situation. And your character is brave, and mine is… well, it’s not.”
They agreed Kenny would start at once. Kenny would go get a mini fridge and a microwave the next day, which he had off, and then Harry would be there the next two when Kenny worked, just in case, and also they would have to get Draco a phone, but make sure he didn’t have to learn all the new things at once and get plenty of rest, and…
People were walking by on the sea promenade six floors below, and now, in early May, they were no longer hurrying to get where they were going as fast as possible, as they had all through winter, but instead seemed to take their time and just enjoying the day.
That summer he started first exploring and then using the rest of the apartment. He was using a small wheelchair that moved him around by way of electricity. Electricity was as close as muggles had to magic, he supposed. He wasn’t well enough to sit straight up and down at the proper chairs at the dining table, but he could use the sofa, and when the weather was nice he would have breakfast outside at the balcony, looking out over the sea. His flat was on the sixth floor, which was the top one. That view from there, when it was sunny, after all that time in bed, never failed to lift his spirits. Even the other rooms were a welcome variety, though.
“It did. Oh, it fucking did. This is interesting, but also a bit disturbing, like,” Kenny laughed. “But you’re right. I mean, no wonder it’s those genres, though. They’re not the best.”
“This place is on the High Street, I’ve walked past it many times. I’ve never been in there, but it looks fancy enough for your tastes, and so it should be plenty fancy enough for any of ours. Any small thing from there should be a proper thank-you-gift, I should think. And if you get stuck or confused in the conversation, just say ‘excuse me for a moment’, and then hold your hand over there and don’t talk too loud, and chances are they won’t hear you very well, so you can ask me stuff.” That seemed reasonable enough. “Ready?”
Draco raised an eyebrow. He did not appreciate being called a tart. Kenny blushed and immediately backpedaled.
“That makes sense. Can’t say I know a lot of the wizarding history either. Binns wasn’t the most engaging teacher.”
Her face looked a little slack somehow, and clearly she couldn’t walk very well if she needed the wheelchair, but she looked nowhere near as unwell as he had feared. He could see traces of what he had seen in her face the day she collapsed – like her face was less symmetrical than it used to be. She was beaming at him too.
Another loud, long beep, and then a friendly woman’s voice saying “Hello, The Little Chocolatier, this is Brenda?” and he immediately went into his politest dealing-with-salespeople-mode and hoped that would be enough.
Nothing had changed, and everything had changed. Some of it made sense, and some of it was more puzzling. Wizards adopting muggle fashion was something he could not have predicted.
The improvement of that first year was both frustratingly slow and exhilaratingly fast. Draco made visible progress from week to week, and yet there was always so much he still couldn’t do. He tried to focus on what he could, though: He learned to drink water, first dripped into his mouth by Mary, then sucked from a soft tip fastened to the side of his pillow whenever he wanted it, and eventually through a straw as he was half-sitting up.
If it doesn’t boil yet, Harry instructed, give it another half minute. Oh, and don’t fill the cup up too much, or there would be water everywhere, the thing can boil over, just like a cauldron. And speaking of cauldrons, an important thing was to never put metal in the microwave, Harry rambled on. And never ever to try to cook an egg in it. The microwave was, apparently, best suited for heating leftovers. The tea was fine, though, for being brewed in a mug and not a pot, and Draco decided he would ask Kenny to place some tea and clean mugs on the microwave, which sat on a low table, easily reachable from his wheelchair. Oh, and some water. There would still be room for the little refrigerator there, when it arrived on Tuesday.
She looked like she wanted to say more, but Kenny showed up with their ice cream cones, and the lady looked terrified and left with a nervous “bye then”. Oh, yes, people were scared of punks, for some reason. How would that work in a hospital setting, then? Kenny would wear a uniform, and probably keep his hair down, but he would still look unconventional, wouldn’t he? But Draco was too overwhelmed to ask, or to hold a proper conversation at all. Kenny handed him his ice cream, and then he leaned on the railing, and Draco leaned back in his chair, and even though he realised there was no way this muggle ice cream was as good as Florian’s in Diagon, it couldn’t possibly be, it was the best ice cream he had ever eaten.
“I mean, what I’m asking is, who normally comes to help you with things if Mrs. Williams is sick? I’m assuming you still need regular help with… things.” That last was said while gesturing vaguely at Draco’s body, and the wheelchair beside the more comfortable chair he was sitting in. He would probably have felt insulted at that, but he was way too exhausted.
Harry was left speechless for a moment.  Of all the reasons he had imagined for Malfoy's behaviour, this hadn't even crossed his mind.  "You don't
He was, however, a fan of the crisp notes bearing their Queen's head.  Draco currently had a handful of them tucked neatly inside his wallet, much lighter than a pouch full of coins.  In fact, so strong was his approval that he had been lobbying both Gringotts and the Ministry for quite some time for Galleon notes at the very least.  If for no other reason than the fact a pocketful of weighty coins did nothing for the line of a good suit.
Moments later and Malfoy rolls completely on top of Harry, his lean body cradled by Harry's thighs.  Even through their clothes there's no mistaking the press of Malfoy's erection against his own, and Harry raises his hips up off the sofa, desperate to feel more.
Not that instantaneous healing was anything particularly surprising in a world of magic, but the fact that it was Potter who was doing it, and that he had and still did hold Draco's hand carefully with his own was more than a little unexpected.
They sat in thoughtful silence for the next few minutes.  Only the occasional clink of cup against saucer broke the quiet.
"I know, you big sap."  Ginny gave him a playful push and then her smile widened.  "So tell me, while you're in the mood for confessions, what d'you think of
“You fancy slumming it for a change?” Ron teased.  Harry shot him a warning glare - he knew Draco well enough by now to spot the brittle edge to his tones that spoke of strained self-control.
,” Pansy complained bitterly.  “Does anyone even know what this is supposed to be?” She prodded disdainfully at her food.
"You'd think after spending nearly a year in a tent together you three would have learned something about communicating with each other."  Ginny got to her feet and turned her gaze over all three of her speechless friends.  "You fought Death Eaters for Merlin's sake – how hard can it be to be honest with each other?"  With that, and a toss of her long red locks, Ginny turned on her heel and strode from the Great Hall.
"Well, you obviously had no intention of marrying the poor girl.  Which is just as well, considering you quite obviously prefer men."
He shook his head, a wry smile quirking his lips.  He was supposed to be dropping round to see Harry casually, a spur of the moment decision – the last three outfits had practically screamed
"Okay.  Or you could Floo me; I'll be home.  Whichever is easier."  Draco spoke with nonchalance he most definitely not feel, especially not with Blaise watching his every move like a hawk.
And just like that they're snuggling, Harry realises.  There's really no other word for it.  He lets out a breath he's been holding and just goes with it, because Malfoy, as usual, is right.  This really is more comfortable.    He's just hoping that the Floo is locked, because anyone coming in now would totally misread this situation.  And it's really not what it looks like, is it?
Ron nodded and sat in silence for a moment with a thoughtful expression on his face.  "So are you and Malfoy going out or something now?  You were pretty cosy with him last night."
So lunch at the Leaky had become a thing.  Something he and George fitted in as often as their busy schedules would allow.  Ron sometimes joined them, but that was 'before Hermione', or
"You're supposed to be a silent partner."  Draco took a deep breath and tried not to think of all the ways this could go horribly wrong now that Pansy was involved.
"Hi?  That's all you've got to say for yourself?"  Draco's frown had morphed into something more like outrage.
"No."  Draco shook his head a little and the strand of hair fell free.  "I'm going to tell her, I promise.  But I—"
"Not as much as I'd like to," Harry said ruefully. "I catch it on the WWN sometimes, but it's not the same as actually watching it, you know? But with the shifts I end up working, I rarely get a chance to see a match."
"It's clearly not," she says, and looks pointedly at his white knuckles clenched around the chair back.
Harry has lost track of the number of times he's been left stunned this evening. He's never heard Blaise say so much in one go, and certainly not so heartfelt or revealing. He opens his mouth, wants some way to convey his gratitude, but Blaise just shakes his head.
Harry huffs.  "You wanted to watch the whole season.  We can do something else instead."  He raises the remote to turn the TV off, but Malfoy slaps his hand away.
"Us?"  Harry's eyes widened impossibly but he didn't pull away. "It's not that I think it's bad, it's just. Well, I've never thought about it before."
Hermione lets out an unhappy sort of a sound and leans forward to prise his hand off the chair. "There's nothing between them," she chides softly. "You know that."
"You don't have to," he said quickly, in part because he still wanted answers, but also because he was just plain intrigued.  "I really didn't mean it the way it sounded."
"I used to." Draco said, raising his voice a little to be heard over the cheers of the crowd. "Father took a box most seasons."
“But we’d have one hell of a wedding night.”  Pansy leered and winked at her friend, all thoughts of Draco’s problems forgotten.
Malfoy's lips curved in a faint smile. "Relax, Potter, I'm not planning to pull the 'Black heir' card." He paused and looked around the shabby hallway. "But I would like to help restore some of its former glory."
Harry stood back from the door and gestured into the hall. He'd never cared in the slightest about the interior of his house – little had changed since it had served as the Order's headquarters – but as he watched Malfoy scrutinise first the hallway, and then what had once been the drawing room, he couldn't help but feel exposed. It was like this insight to his home was sharing more with Malfoy than just his disinterest in interior design.
Harry held her gaze and refused to be cowed. "I don't want to force myself on him if he doesn't want it. And he's made his feelings very clear."
If he was honest, Harry was secretly pleased that neither of their guests had joined them yet.  Although he and Draco had lived together for almost three years, this was the first
In response, Harry slumped into his new favourite chair. Only the disapproval in Malfoy's gaze caused him to straighten up a little. "So what do
"Of that I have no doubt," Hermione replied softly, a slight smile on her lips.  "But intentions aren't always necessary."
"Gin."  Harry's voice was soft and low – he meant every word and it was important to him that she know that.
"You make me sound like some obsessive stalker."  Even as he spoke, Harry had to force back the memories of sixth year.
Unable to think of an appropriate response that wouldn't earn him a lecture, Harry made a non-committal noise – neither Ron nor Hermione liked it when they weren't the first to know about developments in his life.
"And yet somehow I'd like nothing more than to pull your jumper off and lick that drink from your skin."
It seems like moments later when Malfoy's body tenses, taut like a bow.  His cheeks are flushed, head thrown back, and Harry flicks his tongue over the bared skin, tasting the salty tang of sweat as Malfoy's hips stutter against his own.
Draco looked down to where Harry's hand held his tightly. He stayed silent for what felt like an age, before finally lacing their fingers together.
This stopped Harry in his tracks.  Instead of the laugh which he would have expected to erupt on hearing this, he actually found himself musing over the thought of his father-in-law in such an outfit.  Murderous tendencies aside, Lucius Malfoy was certainly an attractive man.
"I don't know why you try and defend him."  Ron cut Harry off before he could finish.  "Everyone knows you should have been Head Boy this year.  McGonagall's gone barking mad if you ask me."
The respite was brief though. No sooner had Hermione set a plate down in front of Ron than he leant back in his chair and continued.
Draco smiled.  "We've finally got the house to ourselves.  Do you really want to talk about my parents?"
If he was to have any hope of making it out of the library without making a fool of himself, or worse, giving Potter room to suspect his motives, then Draco realised he was going to have to focus on something else.  Like the Potions homework which sat virtually untouched on the desk in front of him.
Potter's eyes widened and flickered with some emotion that was too quick for Draco to name.  He opened his mouth to reply, but before he could—
Once again Draco stared – this time at the extensive collection of large green shopper bags.  He squinted at the gold writing, and then looked at his mother.  "You've been shopping in Muggle London."  It came out as more of an accusation than an actual question.
The expected continuing tirade never materialised.  Ron simply got to his feet with an obvious attempt at dignity and nodded again at the both of them.  Without further words he turned on his heel and made as if to leave the Hall.  He didn't get many steps before he turned on heel and returned to the table.  Harry looked up expectantly, but Ron's gaze was fixed on his plate.
Pansy was never repressed for long.  "Does she?  How can she, when no one but you, me, and a very pretty French boy know for sure where your tastes lie?"
filled the canteen and was swiftly followed by the sound of Harry's chair scraping back across the floor.
"It's nothing, Ron, really. I just got the impression that she was a little bit interested. That's all."
Draco snorted.  "That's putting it mildly.  He's having some sort of racing track built in the old meadow."
"I don't know where he is, Potter."   Pansy had a slightly shifty look in her eyes, but Harry couldn't decide if she was lying or if this was simply her default expression.  "Maybe he's running late or something."
"Large as life," Pansy said.  "Blaise told me he was coming to see you, so I thought I'd come and lend some moral support, protect my investment."
"Too far," Harry muttered in reply, his words somewhat muffled as he turned his attentions to Draco's neck.
Draco glared defiantly in return.  "Is there a problem?"  He'd known a reaction like this would be forthcoming from Pansy, but that didn't make it any less irritating.
Harry smiles then. They can do this now – enough time has passed that the memories no longer churn his stomach and cause his hands to shake. He still
"No carpet, bare walls, and that hideous orange blind." Malfoy ticked each offending item off on his fingers. "Not even a lightshade. There are homeless people with nicer doorways than that."
Harry nodded.  “He wasn’t too happy when I pointed out the rest of the building might object to a sudden, and rather localised, snow storm.”
He sat back on his heels and surveyed the devastation he had wreaked in a rather short period of time.  There were clothes strewn on every surface.  His bed, were it not for the ornate headboard, was virtually indistinguishable; shoes were scattered on the polished floors; belts and ties hung from every available door handle.
Oh good, so his mother was plotting. And being very tight-lipped about it, as always. He was glad it wasn’t all gardening and reading and having tea with people, although of course that was nice enough. Come to think, the having tea with people probably was politics too, it always was.
“And it’s not up to Kenny to forgive you. It’s up to the people you have harmed. I have forgiven you, by the way. And so has Hermione. I don’t really know about anyone else.”
“He sounds like a proper dick,” Kenny answered, “but it’s okay to have complicated feelings about this stuff, you know. Be mad at him and care about him at the same time. He’s your father.”
“Certainly, love, we can do that for you. So, are you thinking gift baskets, or…?” she let the words hang in the air. He was used to magically concealing the presents, but he supposed muggles might hide them in baskets. The gift Mary had gotten for his birthday had been wrapped in shiny paper, but a basket sounded like a sensible way of doing it too.
Kenny did the dishes, and he even shook his arse a little as he put the frying pan away, but he wasn’t sold on Dolly Parton at all.
Draco made space. He could not stop looking at Mary. He had missed her so much – she had been there constantly for years, and then just got taken away with no warning. And he knew she would be home with Vicky, recovering, but he hadn’t known she would be well enough to come see him! It was a surprise, the best surprise.
They sat, Kenny in the sofa and Draco curled up in the arm chair, leaning back with his eyes closed. Kenny had the booklet and a cup of coffee, and they let the entire Filth and Fire album wash over them, song by song.
He found he enjoyed most of the magasines Mary had brought him. There were ones about muggle celebrities and royalty which provided helpful insight into muggle culture – muggles were quite mad, true, but in quite a different way than he had expected. Then there was a magasine that was all about muggle science, which he read small stretches at a time. There were magasines dedicated to music, cooking, and various other specialties, and he was excited to read them all. Everything he learned might help him survive, of course, every exposed piece of ignorance was dangerous, but also, he had been starved for entertainment, and it was lovely to finally have some, even if it was only in small doses.
The expectation of wizards who loved wizards was, quite simply, to marry a witch, have at least three children, preferably more, if you had enough house elves to support a big household, which everyone Draco knew did. He was the only one he knew who was an only child, and he’d heard a lot of whispers of “so sad, that poor boy” in his life. (It would make a lot more sense to get the mortality rate down, Hermione apparently always said, according to Harry. Which, fair enough, ditching wars seemed as good a start as any there.)
“Well, yes, in general, but that’s fairly simple to fix, really. Arthur Weasley has been doing this thing for years with bigger muggle things where he just uses a preservation charm around the bits that have electricity. It’s an easy fix.”
Harry got her to to promise to text Kenny about any updates, and in return he promised to get Draco a phone and teach him how to use it.
Why, he wondered as he watched the man, was Harry Potter in this muggle town, distinguished only by its lack of wizardkind? What was he doing here? Escaping the press, maybe – he had always tried to do that at Hogwarts, instead of trying to use it, which would have been the sensible thing to do. So maybe that was it. Hastings was certainly a good place for it, if so. Harry interrupted his musings:
Draco just nodded in response. He felt exhausted, which he supposed was no wonder either, with the screaming, the dream. He couldn’t remember screaming as the fire happened back then, but he probably had. The fire, the enormous storage room he had still felt was his own up until then, which had been his only safe place the year before the fire, in spite of what he was there to do. Up in flames, gone forever. And he himself, damaged. Vincent dead. And Harry, it turned out now, damaged, too. Talking to Harry about it was probably why the dream had come back. He said as much to Kenny.
He didn’t only read sci-fi, though, he read everything and anything that wasn’t too heavy a read. Mary soon learned that he would try anything once. Reading Jane Austen had him thinking that muggle and wizarding culture had been closer two hundred years ago than they were now, and he wanted to share Pride and Prejudice, especially, with his mother. Reading George Orwell made him see similarities between muggle and wizarding politics he hadn’t considered before. It also made him dream up a book where Winston Smith worked at the ministry of magic, and where the department of mysteries were actually doing things to change the past, which again made him think about how le Guin named one of her protagonists George Orr, and how that story was similar, yes, surely she had read Orwell, surely this was a reference, oh, he was happily drunk on the discovery for days, it felt like he had finally gotten enough of a grip on a piece of muggle culture to see the connections.
The way the magic avoidance was accomplished was generally to somehow find a muggle, preferably a nurse, give them a lot of money, and propose they care for the patient until recovery was accomplished, far away from wizardkind. Absolutely no magical items should come with the patient, and they should not even bring their regular non-magical items, including clothes, as they would have been exposed to quite a lot of magic as well. Failure to comply with this was likely to be lethal, the letter stressed.
It was an ongoing conversation, one that was held a bit at a time, over several months. And throughout he was getting better. He was having showers now, sitting down, only needing help with his hair, and drying off after. Every other part of showering he could do on his own. And one day, one day soon, quite likely this summer, he could go out among the muggles for real, armed with all his new understanding of the world.
“I think flowers is the traditional thing, but also chocolate, I think, and sure, cards. I usually order Hermione flowers for her birthday, you can just call a local flowershop and have them deliver it. We could do that.” Well, that sounded handy.
“Very lucky,” he managed to answer. Then, “I started by finding things in Rolling Stone Magazine. Mary would buy whatever I found that sounded interesting. And then more stuff by the bands and artists I liked, and then sometimes the shop manager would recommend things, once Mary started coming in and buying stuff once a week. I am actually rather looking forward to meet that shop manager myself, once I get well enough to go there in person.”
But Harry hadn’t realised. Harry, and Hermione, and probably plenty of other people outside his circle, had assumed that Pansy had been his girlfriend. Somehow that felt like it cheapened their relationship – what a curious thought, why would that be? There was nothing wrong with having a girlfriend, or getting engaged to your Hogwart sweetheart. A lot of people did that, and went on to have excellent marriages. So why did he feel such resentment at the thought of having been assumed to be one of them? It didn’t make sense, not at all.
“Sure, that sounds like a good solution. Do it – call this man, and we will hear whether he thinks that might work.”
Apparently the bed and remote control was a new technology, and Mary was excited about being able to test it for the first time, because it would give her patients more independence, and wasn’t that nice? It was nice. The remote control reminded him a little bit of having his wand, actually. He really missed his wand, the lack of it felt stronger the better he got.
His mother had invited Marcus Flint for tea? That hurt. But oh – of course she would have needed to invite Flint, too, or he might not have been too keen on Pansy going. This way, though, Marcus himself was included in a small conspiracy – and if the story came out, they would know exactly who had leaked it, and Marcus would know that, so most likely he would keep his mouth shut. And if he didn’t, well, Pansy, whom his mother had always doted on, would have some big ammunition for whenever she needed it in her marriage. Trust his mother to set up a situation that had only upside no matter how it went, even if she had gambled with what she had clearly considered his secret.
“No, I do. Just not that part. I keep thinking, though – don’t you think it’s weird how we’re talking as if I’m the only one in the group you hated, while Kenny is the actual muggle here? But he thinks it’s just a race thing, and I mean, we can’t tell him.”
He was not supposed to move yet, because even that would be beyond his limits. Just breathing consciously, and blinking when information needed to be exchanged, was enough, and there would be time enough for everything else later.
“That makes sense. But, just to be clear, when you say marry her off, you mean they just… decided for her? Not give her a choice or anything?”
“Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen. Actually all her books are about courting in one way or another, and it always ends with a proposal, but this one the most.”
“Well, I certainly did when I came here, and I had not been privy to whatever seems to be happening to wizarding attitudes towards muggles, so I feared for my life until Harry told me I was being very silly.” A drama queen, he had said, but Draco wasn’t about to tell anyone that, not even Pansy.
“I really am sorry, you know,” Hermione was saying. “I didn’t realise there were reasons why your husband couldn’t know, why you wouldn’t tell him. I wasn’t implying that you were stupid, not at all, I just didn’t understand what conditions you were working under – I still don’t, but now I know that I don’t know, which I suppose is a bit better, anyway.”
He mostly listened to whole albums, not songs, but there were exceptions. A song called Zombie got him thinking so much about the war that he only played it when Mary left the house, and then on repeat. It was beautiful, but disharmonious, a woman singing about the war, howling grief in a way Draco couldn’t. He even wondered if Dolores o’Riordan was secretly a witch, if it was that war – but no, it was just a bit too early, released in 1994.
He supposed he would find out what muggles did about stairs eventually, but not yet, because even with the chair he wasn’t supposed to go outside for another year or two after first leaving bed. No, he would have to spend time learning things like how to use the toilet again, and move around in his apartment a bit.
Nazi. Draco froze, and something in him came crashing down. Because no, that was not exactly what he had been, of course, but also, yes, that was exactly it. A nazi. That was the muggle equivalent of what he had been. He had been that, he had, and while he had regretted a lot of what he had felt and done, and regretted it hard, too, he had not really seen it like that before. Nazism, though, he had read about, in his history books, in newspapers, he had read Orwell’s essays analysing it too, and he had been just as disgusted by the whole thing, as any sane person would be, and yet he somehow hadn’t seen the very obvious similarities. He had never thought to compare it to what he had done, what he had been, and now the word was here, connected with him, and there was no defense, none, because it was true, wasn’t it? It was just... true.
He could think more or less properly now, too, long stretches of thought, and talk quite a bit. When he wanted to talk, Mary would take a seat in one of them, and sometimes she would knit while she talked. He wondered if that was a muggle thing as well. It could be, he decided, it would make sense: They had to get clothes somehow, after all, and he did learn in school that muggles had less leisure time than wizards did. It made sense to do two things at once, he supposed.
Well, not the war Kenny was talking about, to be sure, but he had fought in a war. Not that he could tell Kenny that either.
“Oh, and yours. Just hearing it… just… the last time I saw you, you hadn’t been able to speak for months, and before that your voice was so very weak. You sound like yourself again, Draco, and I cannot describe how wonderful it is to hear… of course, I knew you were better, I had an owl from Ms Granger, and she told me you were safe and sound, which was such a welcome message, as you can imagine, hearing you were alive, knowing you were on your way to recovery. And then she explained the entire situation over tea when she came here to help me with the phone, of course. Such a lovely young witch. She taught Tippy as well, who seems to have a knack for technology, who knew. And I understand that you have the company of Mr. Potter while convalescing, that’s lovely. Tell me everything!”
Then it all wound down. Vicky said “Sure, I’ll call you about that, Kenny” about something Draco had missed. Harry said how lovely it was to meet “the famous Mary” - they hadn’t talked that much, but he had been listening to her talk to Draco. Mary said Draco mustn’t come visit until he was absolutely ready. No pushing himself too far for her. And then Draco thanked them all for coming, and somehow he didn’t feel tired, just shaky with gratitude. He went to bed and fell asleep halfway through The Division Bell, saving the mix tapes for later. What was a mix tape? Must ask Harry. Harry.
This was starting to feel a lot like that day in May when Harry had stepped in and solved things. Figuring stuff out that Draco couldn’t, calling people Draco didn’t know to call – the ambulance, Vicky, Kenny. That had worked out, hadn’t it? He had been saved from a very difficult situation back then. And he felt a flutter of hope in his chest. Was this possible? Could it be? Could he talk to his mother? Could he talk to Pansy? Greg, perhaps? But oh, his mother especially. He could let her know he was okay. Hear her voice. Know how she was doing, alone in the Manor.
“Oh, good, let’s test something. Hmmm…” Harry flipped through the pages. “I can’t think of anything. Is there anything you want? An item you miss and didn’t know how to ask for in muggle English, something like that? Because then I can probably help you figure out whether there’s a muggle version, and you can call in for that, and order it sent here.”
“Oh, thank you, I appreciate that. She didn’t make it public, not at all, but she invited me and Marcus for tea after you were taken away, to let me know. And I am very glad she did, or I don’t know what I would have thought.”
“I’m so glad. I have been so worried! Sometimes I convinced myself you must be dead, other times that you must be better, but lost without a way back, caught among the muggles forever. Of course, your mother did let us know it would be years and years before you could come back, but still.”
Crying in front of Harry Potter again was out of the question. He clamped down, hard. He had gotten so used to loneliness that he didn’t always remember just how lonely he had become. And with that it was suddenly clear to him that it meant a lot, Harry being here, and that he wanted him to keep coming back.
“You came to my flat straight after a long day at work. Thursday could have gone so very wrong if it had not been for the three of you,” Draco told him, perhaps a bit more forcefully than necessary. “If just one of you three had not been there, my life would be in shambles right now. Imagine if I had to tell my mother I didn’t show my gratitude with a gift, she would be shocked.”
“And besides, what was I supposed to do but try to save you? There was fire everywhere. It wasn’t a situation with a lot of good choices.” Harry shifts uncomfortably. Oh, yes, heroics, he didn’t like those, Draco remembers. He used to think that was just a clumsy attempt to charm people, but it’s apparently honest enough. Still, Draco can’t resist poking it a little.
She wasn’t the only gift. She and Vicky had brought him two lovely notebooks, and Harry and Kenny presented him with headphones. Oh, so that was why Kenny had been so insistent that there wasn’t time to help him buy headphones until next week, and that it would just have to wait. Sneaky, for a Hufflepuff and a Gryffindor. He should have noticed. There was also a CD from each of them, both with handwriting on instead of a print.
“You’re here,” a voice said, a world away, but he was too busy fighting the dream to really listen, and besides, the voice was so far away. “See if you can breathe,” the distant voice suggested. He tried to not gasp, but breathe more fully, but it hurt even worse. But then, suddenly, he found his rigid body went slack, and he sagged against Kenny. “You’re here,” he said, Draco could hear it clearly. He nodded. He was here. Hastings. Bed. Here. It didn’t feel true, not yet, but he knew it was.
I have never written a longer thing before, and I know I have a lot to learn about that. How long are chapters supposed to be, really? And when should I post? Is there any point to having a schedule?
And so Harry did, while pacing the length of the flat. Draco tried not to listen, but eventually he gave up. It was about him, after all.
“My father would have… I don’t know what he would have, but it would certainly not have have been nice.”
“They originally just asked her to break off the engagement, and be open to one or other of the men who would then show an interest, but she wouldn’t. She threw an enormous tantrum, and then THEY broke off the engagement for her. A bit of a scandal, that, I mean, you’re supposed to do it yourself, even if the parents are the ones making the decision, or insisting on breaking the engagement. She absolutely refused, though. She can be quite stubborn. My mother was livid with her parents. She actually didn’t serve them dessert, can you imagine?” He smiled fondly.
“Oh! Mary. Mary Helen Williams,” Draco answered. Harry repeated that into the phone. Mohammed was still on the floor with Mary, doing Merlin knows what, but he supposed the man knew what he was doing, and certainly better than any of them.
“I’m sure we could do the same thing for Parkinson as for your mother. I don’t know what the plan is, exactly, but Hermione seemed completely confident that this wouldn’t be very hard. Are you and Pansy still...”
At first Draco thought all this must mean that in this, at least, the wizarding world was superior. But the pressure in the wizarding world, and especially among the purebloods, was to contribute to the magical gene pool, or else. And it should be done within the sanctity of marriage, because that was the traditional way. And wizards didn’t have sperm banks (they could have, though! They could! It would be easier with magic! We have the technology!). But oh, the implications… Draco had read enough science fiction to know that when technology changed, the culture would follow, with some delay, but it would usually not look nearly as tidy as one expected. He was not sure he wanted to explode the pureblood marriage by making it redundant.
He had not just been tempted, as he had often thought about it before, he had been threatened, threatened with the withdrawal of a father’s love. His mother had made sure he knew he didn’t have to, and he hadn’t had to, not in technical terms. He had also also known his mother had wanted him to do the opposite thing his father did, but there was no threat in that. His mother’s love was unconditional, after all. The choice, in the end, had been very easy.
“Hermione, wait,” Harry broke in. “You need to get one for Parkinson as well. Well, Pansy. Pansy Flint, now.”
“No, I… I mean, I should have realised, at school, I mean, I could have seen for myself, then. I mean, only being in a class with Hermione should have taught me otherwise. But she just pissed me off. A muggle, with zero training, being better than me in pretty much every subject? It felt like theft, somehow. I don’t know. What I’m trying to say is, I could have known better, I had the information, I just didn’t take it in. The truth was there in front of me, and I rejected it.”
“The receiver goes the other way,” Potter said nonsensically, as Mohammed pushed past into the kitchen.
Draco had just nodded mutely. All of his breath and tears and words had left him, and now he was just empty. Harry had placed a cup of tea in his hands, with milk and honey, which wasn’t how Draco took his tea, normally, but he couldn’t bring himself to care. A wrong cup of tea was better than no cup of tea. Now he was at the bottom of it, and had eaten five biscuits and a small chocolate bar, besides, that Harry had somehow found in the kitchen.
He woke up on his own accord, thankfully. The clock showed quarter past five in the afternoon, and he felt intensely hungry – oh, because he hadn’t had any lunch, just biscuits and a chocolate bar. It took a few seconds for reality to fall into place: Mary in the hospital, Harry Potter in his living room (and when had he started thinking of him as Harry? He really had gotten used to muggle customs – normally he would have known someone a lot better before they became a first name in his head). He pushed himself out of bed, used his walker to get to the loo, and then got into his wheelchair.
Draco had a rest, and then picked up a book about a woman who was time traveling or perhaps mad, it wasn’t quite clear. The future she went to was clearly better for her, because the society she grew up in was so very bad. He wondered idly if the USA was still like that for poor people. He couldn’t seem to find anything recent about it. Most of the books he read about the USA had scientists in them, and they seemed to be doing alright for the most part, but that made sense, they were experts. Not on top of anything, but very far from the bottom.
“Are you saying that you were that shithead who bullied Harry through school? And pretty much everyone else you thought beneath you, too? That was you, Draco?”
The papers in the folder were confusing, to say the least, but there was a letter that gave some sort of overview of the situation, all “he” and “mr. Malfoy”, not “you”s or sensible language. Well, Draco was good at complicated language, it was what his brain ran on on its own accord, even while sick. While the papers had some words he didn’t know how to make sense of, the sum total was pretty clear: He had been completely wrong about his disease.
“What do muggles do for people in hospital?” Draco asked, somewhat frantically, after Harry had hung up (why, why would it be called hung up? Why not, say, pushed out?). “Would you send candy? People sent me candy when I got sick, it’s the thing to do, traditionally, and letters and cards. Do muggles do that too?”
“Just because your father has a mouth on him doesn’t mean you should grow one too, and you clearly don’t know what you’re saying. You know perfectly well you are not allowed to swear – ”
All of this was a new development, Harry said. About forty years ago it had been legalised, but was still considered an illness until fifteen years ago, and the discrimination had been a lot worse, too. And it was still there. There was violence, and refusal to rent to gay people, and job discrimination. But at least it was better now, Harry said.
Draco nodded. That made sense. Mary certainly didn’t work all the time, that would be too much. And she didn’t have the cleaning lady come in anymore, she did that herself, because she had more time than she had at first, caring for him. And Vicky no longer got the groceries, Mary always went out to get those herself. And she talked about how nice it was to have more time to read. They spent quite a bit of time chatting, too. All her time certainly wasn’t occupied with helping him.
“That makes sense. But even if it feels like it’s your fault, well, most often these things are a lot more complicated. I bet there are several other people who feel just as guilty about it, that’s usually how it goes with these things.”
Draco knew when it came down to it he himself was somewhere in the middle of these approaches, had a tendency for both, but had generally chosen to be like his father, much good that had done him. There, in his sick bed, in an apartment he hadn’t seen yet, in a muggle town he knew nothing about except it didn’t have wizards, he promised that he would endeavor to be more like his mother. More logical, even when logic defied feeling and demanded sacrifices, and more loyal to the people that mattered the most to him, whatever that might look like. And he would apologise to his mother, too, for not appreciating her enough when he was younger.
“But I DO know what I am saying too, because bullshit is how you say the word NONSENSE in SWEAR LANGUAGE, and now I CAN swear, because your rules are BULLSHIT, because YOU broke them when you shouted at guests TOO – ”
Well, that explained the absence of his mother, at least. That was a relief – no reason to think the muggles had caught her trying to masquerade as one of them. Knowing he would not get to see her, or anyone, for his entire recovery hurt, but at least now there was no reason to think she might not be safe. Oh, but how worried she must be for him! “Left to die among muggles” made a lot more sense now, even as sending him here had been the only reasonable thing to do. No part of this new information had changed that – if anything, it made even more sense now. He was glad his mother was a reasonable woman, even in her grief over him.
“You ordered 120 pounds worth of super posh chocolate for each of us. And then you ordered more, for you. That’s like… you probably spent more than 400 pounds on chocolate. What the fuck, Draco. What is wrong with you. Oh, my stomach.”
Well, that was a generous way of putting it. Ridiculous, but generous. He had done what he had done, and Harry had somehow found his inner Hufflepuff and decided to be nice about it, even if that was also a bit stupid. But wait...
He moved his arms and neck around a bit just to prove to himself that he could, now, he could, and then his legs. Then he got out of bed entirely. It was still dark, but he found his walker. Normally he would take his wheelchair, but he wanted to show himself that he could actually walk now, even if he needed something to support himself with, wanted to show himself that the nightmare was over, the worst of it. He had to sit on it to open the door to veranda, and then just sat there on the seat of his walker in the doorway. The sea was quiet, and there was a waning moon. He could hear someone drunkenly shouting and laughing in the distance. Other than that the night was silent.
“I hope that’s okay,” Kenny went on. “I knew there was room for it, big kitchen like this, an entire wall just unused. I couldn’t call you, obviously, as you don’t do the phone thing yet, but I rang Harry, and he said if you didn’t want to shell out for it, he would. I mean, he already has, in a way – I’m using his extra credit card for everything until we figure out how to get to your money. But it will save you lots of money in the long run. But more importantly, it saves us both stress as well, because with that I can batch cook much better with one. Use my time more efficient, like. Keeping you from needing more people coming in. Because, ask Harry about that sometime, that’s really stressful.”
“Perhaps, but Mother, I really think I only figured out something that muggleborns have known all along.”
He would listen to music not only in his bedroom, now, but in the outer living room, and he had set up shelving for his still growing CD collection, and a separate player with big speakers. He would also sit in the inner living room reading, or working on a big puzzle that would take up the table over the weeks it took him to complete it. He would sometimes even roll his wheelchair into the kitchen if Mary was there cooking or something, just to chat. The kitchen elves back home never let him do that, not even when he was small, but this was a kitchen built for humans, and Mary liked the company.
“Okay, so, are you feeling more tired than usual after doing your morning stuff today? Less? About the same?” Kenny asked when they were done.
“You could have prioritised getting yourself and your friends out of there. Instead you chose to do the heroic thing, again.”
He crossed his arms, looking like a stubborn four-year-old. Draco wasn’t going to argue with him in the first place, but somehow seeing a sullen Harry was a little bit endearing, and it was tempting to poke just a little more, like he would a friend. He reined himself in. There was something important here, something similar.
So while the specific arrangements had changed a bit over the years, Draco and Pansy had always known they would marry each other, and they had been very happy with that prospect. Who better to marry, after all, than their best friend and ally in the world? Together they would have independence from the adults and be able to arrange life just as they wished. They knew this, they wanted it, they talked about it as a matter of course.
“Stop mocking me, if you please. How was I supposed to know how much chocolate costs, or that I would have to deal with the cost before the bill came? I knew the roses and chocolates together were 73 pounds, but I had no way of telling how much of that was the flowers and how much was the chocolate, or how much chocolate Mary would be getting. Or whether the baskets was a large additional cost. So I added a reasonable buffer so as not to make the chocolate lady suspicious, or otherwise make a fool of myself. But I think I did rather well, in the circumstances.”
In another case, a dutch woman had fallen ill, and was being nursed, away from everyone, by her devoted husband, who had taken great care to use no magic at all in her care. He still noticed her getting slowly worse, though, and after two years he gave her care over to a muggle neighbor and left, thus saving her life. She was the only one of the five to survive.
“Oh, that’s too bad. But maybe you could let me know what sort of books are good for the muggle OWLs, and I can get Kenny to get me some? People in the books always know chemistry and physics. They need it for things like the hyperspacedrive.”
Kenny seemed taken with Draco’s CD collection, enthusiastic about the pizza, and ready to ask Draco about a thousand questions about his daily routine. He was confident that they could make this work for a while at least, as long as they employed some strategies to make Draco more independent around meal times. Was he able to operate a microwave if it was placed at a good heigth? How about the fridge, could he access the lower shelves of the fridge? Hmmm, too bad. What if they got a mini-fridge to place the day’s meals in, making sure it was easy to open? Worth a try, certainly.
“That’s nice. I mean, the music is the important part, for me, but good lyrics can only help. A bad text can certainly ruin the entire song.”
“Actually, I know one thing that changed the muggle marriages and all, between then and now. There was a big gay scare, in the late 1800s.”
As it turned out, the flower shop also had some fancy chocolates, including something that sounded like the ones Mary liked, so Harry ordered a big box of those as well as the bouquet – “the nicest thing you could fit into a hospital vase, with lots of yellow roses”, Harry instructed them. Draco figured the amendment and constrains on his wishes made enough sense that he shouldn’t make a fuss.
Kenny did. “Okay, it’s not impossible to make good country music,” he judged. “This is really good. And I didn’t think country would be about that – you know, homelessness, air pollution.”
Draco wondered, quietly, whether he might be permitted a membership, too. No one in the muggle world knew him, but then again, he supposed he already knew two members, if they were willing to vouch for him. He did not really know how these things worked – in his father’s club one needed to be a person of some societal status, as well as have several recommendations from existing members. The editor of The Daily Prophet had tried and failed to get in repeatedly, to Lucius’ mocking amusement. Trying and failing to get in would be the worst, Draco decided. Carefully asking once he got better, though, that would be the way.
He wished he could add wizard versus muggle to the conversation of their differences, but of course he could not. Instead they talked about how his family had the power to buy her services, even as most people with the exact same needs as Draco would not have that option. They might have to be cared for by a rotation of carers who came in to do only the most necessary things and then left, or by an already overworked family, or, fairly frequently, not at all. He had not even considered his access to a nurse as a luxury, just as a tedious need. The idea of that same need, but unfulfilled, was deeply disturbing.
Kenny did wake up before lunch, and looked quite a bit more rested, too. He made them bread with some scrambled eggs that were also full of vegetables – tomatoes, peppers, greens, squash. Draco had never seen eggs served like that before, but he found it quite enjoyable. And the dinner was already made, the famous lasagna that was supposed to be as good as the one they had enjoyed on Friday. If it was, Draco was excited for that meal as well.
“Oh. Well, I suppose you believed what you were taught to believe, Draco. You can’t blame yourself.”
“I don’t care that you’re sorry! You assumed he had me practically locked up! And your ‘apology’ was terrible – ‘bla bla, I assumed he was bad because I thought he was bad’ – not worth the time it took to say it, certainly.” Pansy’s voice was getting rather further away too, even as her volume had clearly gone up quite a bit.
“Off to bed, then,” the man said, breaking through Draco’s stalemate of indecision. Draco nodded and rolled out, Kenny behind him. Kenny watched Draco get into bed before refilling his water carafe and placing a single pill on the table. “If you have trouble falling asleep, take this, even though you’ve already had one today. But probably you won’t need it, most likely you’ll be asleep in five minutes. I’ll see you tomorrow. If you’re not up by nine I’ll wake you. Sounds good?”
“That sounds hard. No, I had time to prepare, once we were certain what was wrong. Hermione figured it out, of course, and then we just rented a place for me in muggle London for a month while planning the move here, on the theory that damage reduction was a good idea, you know, that muggle London was better than staying where I was.
Well, he knew that last part. Mary had explained that to him – how trying to do too much too fast would just slow down the progress further, or even reverse it. He would much rather have used his self discipline to push further, faster, but no, recovery would be slow, it would take years. This was what Mary had told him, and the letter gave her the right of it.
It had been a normal morning. Morning toilette, a leisurely breakfast, and then reading the newspaper on the veranda for a while, enjoying the sun and the best part of a pot of tea, decaffeinated because Mary said he really shouldn’t have stimulants yet. They were still arguing about the EU constitution referendum that Tony Blair had proposed last month. Draco still found muggle politics very confusing, but he had tried to follow this, and apparently nobody was too pleased with the muggle prime minister right now.
Harry’s laughter was fond, loving. Only been in muggle shops to browse – no pureblood Draco knew has ever gone to a muggle shop to browse. Ronald Weasley was a lot more adventurous than Draco. Of course, these days Draco wanted to experience the muggle shops for himself, but before living here, it had never even occurred to him, not even as a lark. He supposes Weasley might have been dragged there by his muggle-raised and his muggle-born best friends, but that was still fairly adventurous in Draco’s book. Draco laughed with Harry, finding a trickle of fondness in himself for Harry’s friend.
“Safe and sound,” he said. “And really glad to see you! I worried,” he admitted, though surely she had known he worried. She smiled with the functioning part of her face. “When I get better, I can come visit you.”
“Copy?” Draco looked at him, confused. He knew there was a thing called a photo copier, but he’d never heard of copying music.
“You say that as if that was something you could have just decided to see. I think that’s bullshit, frankly. But I’m really glad you see it now.”
“Okay, great! Of course I’ll find the time for that. And Harry will text me your number. Yes, Ron, I’m just about done, I promise…”
The breakfast table was lovingly done. Kenny had found a table cloth and put on the kitchen table. He’d also found a pillow to place under Draco’s feet, which made it easier to sit there. And he had indeed managed crepes, and a huge bowl of strawberries. “There should be plenty,” he said, “for a birthday. So I bought six punnets of them. I figured if we can’t eat it all, I can always just puree it with some sugar and freeze it. There’s always a use for strawberries, after all. But also, it’s amazing just how many strawberries a person can eat in a day if there are enough of them. So I just got a lot.”
“Oh, and then we found a cleaning lady who was also willing to do some food prep and such until the application for carers from the city went through, so I had most of the help I needed, and Ron went back home, and there I was, you know. Alone, but still. Able to go out a bit in my wheelchair. Money certainly helped, though. I didn’t have to spend anywhere near as lavishly as you did, but still.”
“Yeah, a schoolmate, like. Didn’t know he was here with the same thing I did before today, and his carer, a nurse, she just collapsed, she’s in the hospital now, and this guy needs a fair bit of help, but not fulltime… he doesn’t go out yet, but he’s got a wheelchair friendly flat… yeah, I figured it would maybe be a good situation for you. It’d be live-in, so you could probably work out a schedule that would work for a while at least, even if it would maybe be too much for you longer-term… no, I don’t know how much, maaaybe fifteen hours? Guessing wildly, here, I don’t actually know, you know? I mean, he doesn’t know either. You’d have to talk to him and figure things out? Well, I’m not going to make his decisions for him, but like, he apparently doesn’t do any of his own management now, he’s used to having that done for him, but he could probably learn, but the thing is, he’s vulnerable in some ways, and the carer carousel would be even worse for him than it was for me, and that’s saying someth... Oh, Kenny, mate, you’re a star. Yeah, just come over right away, I’ll buy you some pizza, I’ll buy us all some. About quarter past six? It’s the big, shiny building by the seaside walk, you know the one. Top floor. Yeah, I know my public school is showing, shut your face, Ken. Yeah, see you then.”
“So, you may want to look this up properly later. I may get things wrong, okay? Precision is not my thing, as both you and Hermione like to remind me.” It was lovely how close Harry felt to his friends still, confident that they would still be there in the same way as before when he returned from his exile. Draco was barely even jealous, it was so uplifting.
“I suppose it is easier for me than it is for him,” he heard Pansy say. “I have a good marriage, and Draco has, well, a life among muggles. No offense, Hermione, but it will limit him, you know? He won’t be able to find a wife until he comes back, even though Narcissa will do her very best in setting up a good situation to start his search from. And Draco and I – we were so sure of each other that he never had any backup plan – why would he, right? It was always meant to be the two of us. We got engaged when we were five, you know. That’s all lost to him now.”
As Harry was talking, Draco was belatedly struck by the strangeness of having Harry Potter in his living room. He looked more grown up, but not very different, except for his muggle clothes. He was wearing jeans and a forest green hooded sweater, and a light brown leather jacket over that. The jacket had seen better days, but the rest of the clothes looked neat enough. He had a pair of big earphones slung around his neck, and somehow he looked too large for the space, so much taller than Draco in his wheelchair, so much taller than Mary, too, so much broader than… well, anyone Draco had seen in years, certainly.
Because Mary said it would take years. Just getting out of the bed would probably take about a year, during which time he would be introduced to such things as talking, sitting up, drinking water, eating soft foods, gentle stretching, and so on. It would be hard, Mary acknowledged, and demand a lot of self-discipline, but as time went by he would at least be feeling increasingly better, she promised.
“Yes, I’m nearly halfway through recovery, and of course life is getting better the better I get, so that’s… good. I’ve been outside several times, too!”
The look of horror on Harry’s face probably matched his own. The excitement he felt, at the technology to communicate with people back home being available, was pushed down, hard, by the terrible knowledge that there wasn’t any way to let them know about it. He felt horrified that there was a way and he hadn’t known about it, and that they hadn’t known about it, and that he couldn’t see a way to create the connection now that he did.
And suddenly, with sleepy clarity, Draco knew exactly what Harry Potter was doing in Hastings. He was doing the exact same thing Draco was doing, of course. He was recovering too. Harry had been in the fiendfyre as well. Sense made, Draco slept.
“She’s certainly very good at arguing for bending the rules when it suits her.” Pansy’s voice was a lot more indulgent now that the child was gone.
He was not in hospital, he was in his own apartment, which apparently had been bought for him, in a town called Hastings, which he vaguely recalled as being on the south coast of England, but which was a largely irrelevant place because there weren’t any wizarding society there for the last thousand years.
“There was a fire,” he said instead. “I haven’t dreamed about it in a long time, but. My friend, Vincent, he died. And I nearly died. And my other friend, too. Harry saved us. We didn’t deserve – it was our fault, the fire. My fault. My fault, mine. I was so stupid, so stupid, so…” He succumbed to dry sobs, half amazed that his voice had carried so many words before giving in. He must have screamed a whole lot before waking up, because his throat felt so sore, like it had the day after, like smoke.
“It really is the same thing, in the sense that people build on what they have available to them. Magic opens up for more magic, and muggle technology opens up for more muggle technology – electricity opens up for the telephone, just like transfiguration is necessary for some people to become animagi. And then culture is built in much the same way…”
While these cases were anecdotal, the article stressed, they did indicate quite clearly that it was indeed dangerous for the patient to be around magical people. This was further supported how there were no recorded successes of the patient being cared for by someone magical, including house elves, and by how even rare visitors seemed to make the patient detoriorate further.
He had no idea how to talk to the man. Not like Harry did, certainly, in a tone that mixed intimacy and vulgarity. Harry had certainly never been especially well-spoken in school, but he had not talked like this. He had known the basics of talking properly, even though he had absolutely no refinement. Well, Draco had no intentions of being neither vulgar nor intimate with the man, but also, Kenny was so very unlike Mary that Draco found himself floundering a bit, especially as he was just so tired.
“Excuse me, are you okay? Do you… need anything?” A stranger, a woman with a little child strapped into a contraption on wheels, both mother and child in bright pink, had stopped and looked at him, worriedly.
“Vicky does,” he answered, “but I don’t know how to call her. And she’s Mary’s sister, so… oh no, she doesn’t know, does she? And I don’t know how to call her! She should know her sister is… sick. Oh, I hope she is just sick.”
Draco did, in fact, want some tea or something, a whole lot of somethings, but he found himself shaking his head nonetheless, in a feeble attempt at taking back control, maybe. “Later,” he said. “Tell me about your idea first.”
“Forget it,” Harry said, looking wary. Draco shut his mouth, ready to listen to whatever warning implied in that wariness, but Kenny clearly was not interested in doing any such thing.
Draco and Harry got hold of Mary’s sister in the afternoon, after resting and having dinner. She said she had meant to call, but she had just been so overwhelmed with everything going on, and Draco seemed to be in good hands for the time being. Mary was awake and would be okay, but coming back to work wasn’t going to happen for a while, if ever. She would be in the hospital for a while, and then recovering, which she could do at Vicky’s place.
Draco nodded again. Harry seemed nervous. Talked too much, too fast. Then again, he sort of always did, back in school. And he was right that Draco’s situation without a carer was very bad indeed. For a worried moment there he had thought maybe Harry was planning to offer himself to help. Now that would have been a recipe for disaster. No, he needed whatever Harry had cooked up, and it was unlikely to be a ploy.
But the reason why this is hard to write is the main reason I am writing it. Which is why I appreciate everyone reading so, so much. Thank you for letting me tell you this story!
“And your father?” Kenny asked, politely interested, as were drinking tea, eating biscuits, and working through a few of the chocolates, which were, in fact, delicious.
As it turned out, Draco had a bank account which didn’t have a card, but with a lot of money available, and some investments that he could sell if he needed more, which seemed quite unlikely. There were also two extra credit cards in his name, which Harry promised he would teach Draco to use when he was able to go out again. They also found the contract for the flat, signed for him by Mary, and the form that gave her the authority to do so on his behalf. The flat had been bought for a sum that had Harry moaning, claiming that it was a ridiculous amount even for a huge, posh, new flat like this.
“Vicky, was that it? Is it okay if I look around to see if I can find her number somewhere?” Harry asked. “Mrs. Williams… Sorry, Mary, she may have left it somewhere. Does she live here too, or…? Okay, cool, where’s her room? I’ll go do that, then.” Ten minutes later Harry had not only found Vicky’s number, but called her. By the sound of it she had already received a message from the hospital, and was going there as soon as she had someone to watch her daughter.
“If anything, we were more nemeses than anything. I thought he was the absolute worst, and I behaved… well, really badly, actually.”
“So what I want you to do is, drop the heavy activities for a few days, just drop them entirely. Yes, including showering, I’m sorry. I’ll help you get clean, but I know it’s not the same. And if you feel yourself getting tired during light activities, like reading or listening to music, then you stop and do some extra actual rest. Can you do that for me? Well, actually, scratch that, can you do that for yourself?”
Divorce was almost unheard of among wizards, and his own family, and everyone like them, looked down upon it. The few stories that circulated were mostly about muggle-borns and mixed families anyway, but it happened among purebloods too, and then disdain was the correct response. Probably part of it was, as Harry pointed out, that it was a lot easier for purebloods to avoid divorce in the first place, as most of them had an enormous hereditary family home, and plenty of money besides – if they ended up in an unhappy marriage they would have a lot easier of a time avoiding each other, after all. One would take the west wing and one would take the east wing, and so a married couple could lead very separate lives, though on occasion they would probably have to go places together. It certainly put some previously rather puzzling things about aunt Isabella and uncle Thaddeus into perspective.
A second article detailed experiments with placing patients in magical stasis, with no success. This experiment was allowed only because the normal odds of dying, and the suffering nature of that death, were so high.
“Exactly! And there are other food places that do that too, but pizza is practical because pretty much everyone likes some version of it, and there’s also variety, so it’s a good food to share. And it’s really good, I bet you’ll like it. Now, I’ll just call the pizza people, and you should have a think about which things your nurse usually does for you in a day, and what you do yourself. Because that’s one of the things Kenny will want to know, so he’ll know what to help you with.”
Draco didn’t, but he nodded all the same. It made sense – it was what he was used to. As long as you married and made your tidy and proper contribution to the gene pool and the social stability, why wouldn’t you have your lovers of whatever gender you preferred? This was how he had intended to live his own life, his life with Pansy.
Being moved, carried, every step an impact that seemed to hurt his very core. Clicking, voices, more clicking. A strange humming, then, and shaking and moving. His eyes fluttering open to see two worried, blue eyes and a dark, blond beard - “oh, shit, he’s awake, hey, Mary! MARY! Is it safe to give him some more…?” “Yes, 5 ml, do it, now!” And then it was over.
“Just rest,” the man repeated. “Don’t even try to think. Mrs. Malfoy, if you will join me in removing some things from this room? Just that one, and this portrait for now, and then I will explain later. No, not by wand, by hand only, please. Ourselves, no house elves. Okay, that’s good.”
They made tea by boiling water in the microwave, first Harry, to demonstrate, and then Draco. That part was easy: Power to the maximum setting, time to one minute, open to see it at a rolling boil in the mug, hopefully. Snape had grown up among muggles, Draco suddenly recalled – he wondered if the man had ever experienced with using a microwave instead of a cauldron. The thought felt equally absurd and likely, somehow.
“Stop being so bloody dramatic, Draco, no one is going to burn you at the stake, and especially not your own nurse, for fuck’s sake. I get that it must have been difficult, though. You can ask me stuff, I just. Don’t know much, like I said. Two half educations doesn’t really make me fit for living in either world. I’ve been reading to take my O-levels, though, when I get a bit better. That’s basically muggle OWLs. They even sound the same, I keep meaning to ask Hermione whether she knows whether someone named it that as a joke or something.”
“You said that already,” Harry said. “After they sentenced your father, remember?” He looked like he regretted the words as soon as they were out of his mouth, looking uncomfortable as they hung between them. Draco forced himself to answer. It wasn’t that bad. It wasn’t.
The choice of Hastings made a lot more sense now, he supposed. No wizards here since the Norman conquest. There was unlikely to be any magical items around, and certainly no magical people or creatures.
“Mary used to have errand day on Thursdays, and.” Draco felt weirdly shy about his request, but surely Kenny would understand. “And she would get me magazines and a new CD.”
“So once they had broken off the engagement, they just found Flint for Pansy instead. Pansy’s mother and his are cousins, and very close, so it was easy to arrange, of course. And now she signs her letters Pansy Flint, and I haven’t even had one of her letters for… four years? Five? A long time.”
Mary understood that thinking about this slow progress was all very frustrating, of course, but that was just the way it was, and trying to do too much too fast would only slow him down. It would be important to find some enjoyable activities when he was able, she said. For some people, reading was possible – did he like to read? Blink – yes, he did enjoy reading. And maybe he could sit on the balcony and look at people, wouldn’t that be nice? He wanted to sneer at that, but he found himself overcome by longing instead: It would, in fact, be nice. Blink.
“We were going to get married. She was going to be the mother of my children! I’ve known that since I was just a child, and there was never any reason to doubt it, and now… she probably has children by now. With HIM. I can’t say I know how to deal with that, but I need to talk to her. I just miss her… so much.” His voice broke.
Kenny nodded, thoughtfully. It was the truth, even if Draco had to twist it a little – leave out the muggle bit. The truth, and more importantly, the true story.
“We figured we’d share the best music we didn’t think you had heard,” Harry said. “Kenny’s sister helped, with the CD burner. It’s like… a mixtape, but on CD.” What a mix tape was, he failed to explain, so the explanation left a lot to be desired.
“Politics? Oh, yes, you have the Malfoy Wizengamot seat. I somehow forgot that was your responsibility now, until I am old enough.”
“It’s a good place to start, I think. And it makes sense to have a solid understanding of things. I see you’ve been reading history lately too.” Kenny threw all the carrot tops in one of the pots, for stock, and started on chopping the rest of them into small, even pieces.
“It’s only pretentious if you are pretending,” Draco pointed out primly. “And I am not. I have lots of thoughts about muggle technology and the role of science fiction, and I haven’t had anyone to talk to about it, obviously, and I thought you might be interested, because you belong to both worlds, and…”
“Tell you everything? Well, that would be a lot, Mother,” he laughed through tears, “but let us start with… Oh, yes. I was in bed at first. Seven months in some sort of muggle technology induced stasis, which of course I don’t remember at all, and then another year spent just in bed. They connected me to tubes for everything, which were a joy to get rid of, of course. And after about a year, I started moving around a bit. They have a chair with wheels on it, so that I could move about even before I was strong enough to walk. I still need it most of the time, and when going out, but I walk more now. And then… hmmm. And I have learned so much about muggle culture, and it has been so very interesting, and I am looking forward to giving you some muggle books.”
“I read this book,” Draco would often say, “this muggle book – ” And usually Harry would laugh at Draco’s sci-fi adventures, but admit he hadn’t read the book in question. He wasn’t big on reading, generally he prefered to just watch a film for entertainment, and even that made him restless. He had seen a lot of them when he was too ill to do much. Draco hadn’t, he had gotten dizzy whenever he tried and given it up.
Still, even Lucius, so acutely aware of power, had to really squint to see those power differences from above, Draco realised. Lucius had good instincts for these things, and he was good at squinting, and at using that to his advantage, but the power differences still weren’t really visible until he looked for it. He tried to tell Mary about his father, but it was hard to find the right words.
Find help, yes. He should find help. How did one go about finding help? Rolling back out on the veranda and shouting, perhaps? There were plenty of people out there. Would the building receptionist let them in? Oh, the receptionist, that was who he should call for help, with the thing in the hall that wasn’t exactly a telephone. He rolled out into the hall and was thankful that the device wasn’t too far up. He hadn’t used it before, but he was used to technology now, he used a lot of it, surely it wasn’t that difficult. Ignore the heart beating its way out of his chest, now, ignore the fear that she might be gone, too late, too...
And then there had been a whole mess of changes, and now lots of people lived openly gay lives. Kenny was one of them – even though his ex had turned out to be a bad card, the two of them had lived together happily for two years. Kenny’s family were fine with this and treated his partner as they would have a woman he lived with – but this was rather absurd in itself, the concept of living with a partner before marriage. What was the point? Either get married or don’t. Draco didn’t say that to Harry, but he suspected Harry could see his disapproval nonetheless.
“I suppose. But I don’t think I deserve to just be forgiven just like that, either. Or anyone who has done terrible things, really.”
The setup for reading was a strange one: He would sit up in the odd bed, a magasine resting on an equally odd table before him, which had a horisontal surface, but also a connected part which could be tilted, and that tiltable part could stick out over his bed when he wanted – the table did, of course, in true muggle fashion, have wheels on it. So he could put a magasine on the tilted surface and read, when the angle was right and his bed was positioned right with the remote control. Mary had to adjust that part of the table for reading, though, and he found himself wishing there was a remote control for that as well. He was adapting, he thought, surprisingly well to muggle life.
“Yeah, I mean, to know a reformed fascist, I guess. To see that there’s a way out of it. Because he keeps talking about their disgusting strategies to find lonely young men and recruit them, but then he has absolutely no sympathy for those same men once they’re in, and that sort of leaves them no way out, see?”
“Faster it is, then. And I will text you the number the SIM comes with, so you will have your mother’s number. Get Harry to show you how to save it to the phone so you can see when she’s calling. Now, do you want me to send the phone to her by owl with some instructions, or do you want me to owl her and ask if I can come deliver it and show it to her?”
“I know that! Of course I know that. But muggle technology doesn’t work in the magical world, the magic is too strong, it interferes and destroys electrical things!”
Draco hadn’t realised mobile phones even had loudspeakers, but apparently they did, albeit not very good ones. Hermione’s prim but scratchy voice filled the room.
Harry’s voice wove in and out. “Yes. No, not conscious. I don’t know… No, or, I can’t tell? Just one second, though. Mo, is she breathing? Oh, apparently yes, but weakly. Yes. Yes, he placed her like that already. I don’t know shit about it, but I know he’s done a first aid course at least, for work, so I guess he knows what he’s doing, to some, ah, extent? Yes, umh. Into the elevator once you get there, and then top floor, and then you see the door, we’ll keep it open. Yes, still unconscious, no changes there. No, I don’t actually have her name, I just happened to be here, I was just… Wait a sec. Draco, what’s her name? Draco? Hey, DRACO! What’s her name?”
And then he grabbed a carrot and rolled off, because he didn’t feel quite ready to see Kenny’s reaction to that.
“Yes, exactly,” Draco cut him off harshly. “Oh, nobody used that word, but you know perfectly well that does not matter. It was the same thing. It was… fascism and racial supremacy. That’s what it was.”
“I am sorry,” he apologised hurriedly. “I got too excited. I haven’t been able to talk to anyone about this stuff. I couldn’t very well ask Mary about how electricity worked, she might realise I wasn’t a muggle. I don’t want to be burned at the stake!”
Draco ate his soup in silence, mulling it over. And then after the meal, he added it to his list of things to do when he returned to the wizarding world. There were many things he could not fix, but surely this was something he could at least affect.
"I believe Master Harry will find his clothes already laid out.  And your bath is waiting."  Kreacher bowed his head after this, but not before Harry was convinced he saw the elf smirk – ever so slightly.
"Has he ever been?"  Snape replies, and Harry finds himself in agreement for the second time that day.
"I just don't know," he admitted finally.  "There's no reason why I shouldn't like it, or any of the others for that matter, but..." Harry tailed off with a shrug.
The conservatory had swiftly become Harry's favourite room in the house, and despite Malfoy's insistence that it function as a dining area, Harry was strongly tempted to install his favourite leather armchair in there. Perhaps that would wait until after Malfoy's departure, though, he thought. No point in there being needless arguments.
Over dinner they talked about the book, more about music, and then about Draco’s mother, though he got a little snarled up when he said he missed her a lot. He couldn’t tell Kenny just how long it was since he had seen her, after all. Still, Kenny didn’t appear to notice. Oh, he needed to ask Harry how he had presented all this to Kenny.
“Five minutes,” Harry told Mohammed. “Five minutes and they’ll be here, the operator said. They are on their way, they’re nearly here, she said. Started out the minute I told them where to go.”
Slowly. And she had said he would be getting better slowly. So, more of the same, then. Bed, sludgy thinking. Surely better, though. Getting better. Than getting worse. Even if it was still hard. To think. To move. To everything. Don’t move, she’d said. The nurse. Mary. Not like madam Pomfrey. Not at all. This one looked short, and dark, and round-faced. Pomfrey was tall, and blonde, and her face was a bit square. So, different. But maybe a little alike. Kind and firm. He hoped. That’s similar. He heard her now, in his room, doing something that produced a gentle clicking sound. Soothing him, making him sleepy. Hypnosis, he thought. That’s the muggle version of. Umh. Of mind control. Spells. Those spells. Yes.
It started with this conversation, though, while Kenny was chopping carrots for a soup. There were a lot of carrots – Kenny was fond of making a lot of meals at a time. Beside him were several leeks and a little pyramid of potatoes.
Then the chocolates arrived. The baskets were not for concealment of the gift, as Draco had assumed, but for display. Surprising, but quite lovely, he thought. Kenny was excited about his, but also insisted that it hadn’t been necessary, and didn’t this situation serve them both, after all?
“Do that, I am sure you will have a lot to talk about. But tell me, what have you been doing with your time? With both me and father… away?” His father would never get out of Azkaban, they both knew, but this wasn’t the time to talk about that.
“She sounds like she’s on the way to be an excellent attorney,” Hermione said, sounding amused. “Though I am afraid she won’t be allowed to swear in court either.”
“Yes, I absolutely do, I have… I have read about pizza.” He felt silly saying it, but it was the truth. He was familiar with the concept, through reading, but he hadn’t actually tasted any.
Harry laughed, a slightly hysterical-sounding burst of mirth. Draco found himself waving his hands, shaking his head, frantically denying any such possibility with his whole body. Then he, too, was laughing, gasping.
The horror of the machines. The horror of the tubes. The beard, which no one here was going to understand the wrongness of. But mostly, the tubes. How they went into his body, to force it to live, pumping, making him half muggle machine himself. And all the time he could not move.
“Thank you,” Draco said, and meant it. “And speaking of not dying, thank you for saving my life before.”
“Yes, thirteen more years, is it not? Well, as you know, politics is more than what happens in the Wizengamot. I will tell you about some more of that later, after the Goyle soiree on Samhain. It may all come to nothing yet. And I understand that this phone gives us rather unlimited access to having conversations.”
The information came in little drips over the next several weeks. His nurse was named Mary Williams, and he was her only patient. She had dealt with cases like this before, one exactly like it, and several similar ones.
“How nice for you, these excursions. I had to read up on the history of the place, so I knew there was a castle, but I haven’t much idea what it is like there now, except that there is, of course, a muggle town of some sort. I don’t suppose the castle is very relevant anymore, defense-wise.”
He had never heard his mother so scattered, jumping from topic to topic like that. He hoped it was just the telephone making her nervous, or the emotional impact of speaking together after so long. But at the same time, the relief of her voice felt like a poultice soaked with healing potion on his heart.
The pizza was good. Draco tried everything, but he especially liked the one with just mushrooms and cheese. Harry offered to teach Draco how to operate the microwave, looking slightly wary. He was probably afraid that Draco’s inexperience with technology would give his wizarding roots away, Draco decided. Little did Harry know that Draco was now well versed in muggle technology, he even had a technological bed. Well, he wasn’t about to argue about that in front of Kenny, so he just thanked Harry. He wanted to show Harry how well he could master new technology anyway. He really was living the muggle life, or the indoors version of it, at least. There was still a lot he didn’t know (driving a car seemed quite difficult, for instance, and he would probably need several tries to drive it in traffic), but a microwave didn’t sound like much of a challenge.
“And what price range are you thinking of, then?” He was supposed to think about the price range? He didn’t know anything about muggle money, and he wasn’t quite clear on what price range even meant. He mouthed ‘price range’ furiously at Harry, but he was about as helpful as a chocolate teapot and just kept mouthing ‘what?’ back. Draco turned his back on him and frowned. Okay, so the flowers and chocolates for Mary had been 73 pounds, plus delivery… so that means one could get reasonably nice chocolates for that amount. He would just have to take his chances, and add a bit of buffer just in case.
“You’ve got it, mate. You just roll over there where it’s a bit more quiet, and I will get us an ice cream each? Just place yourself the way you want to sit. Any preferences?”
“I don’t know a lot about muggles, but I think the ‘strict parents’ excuse can cover a multitude of sins,” she mused. “It also has the benefit of being true, too, for the most part. I mean, imagine Narcissa if you decided you wanted to buy, say, a muggle motorcycle at fifteen. There is no way she would have taken that well.” Neither would most muggle parents, but she had a point.
“No, I’m… not well enough for outside yet. I’ve never been out, here.” A plain ‘no’ would probably have been enough of an answer, but apparently his filters were all turned off. A good thing it was only Harry, who didn’t really know him, in this life or the other, not anyone who mattered.
And so they did. It wasn’t the same, but it was still pleasant enough. After Harry left, Draco couldn’t stop thinking about it, both how Harry had claimed to be there when he tried to kill Dumbledore, and that he insisted Draco had been overruled by himself, his moral, his character, and that was why he couldn’t cast that Avada. That it was not cowardice. He still thought it was nonsense, of course, but even so – the guilt of being a coward seemed to have shrunken a little. That guilt and the guilt over being on the wrong side had never seemed to balance each other out, opposite as they were. They still didn’t, but they felt a little closer to an equilibrium now.
“Oh, I admit I am absolutely musically promiscuous, and I see nothing wrong with that either. Being prejudiced about music sometimes seems like it’s some sort of ideal, frankly – ”
And then the door dinged again. Harry opened it, and there was Mary, in a wheelchair pushed by her sister. Draco shouted in surprise, and then tried to navigate his own chair up to her side and hug her. That was even more difficult than the Harry hug had been, but just… Mary. Mary, Mary, Mary.
The muggle music machine was big, taking up most of a whole shelf in his room. Each recording of music, called a CD, was organised by theme – most often the theme was who had composed or performed the music, but there were others, like instrument. By reading the music magasines he also learned that a selection of music that the musician or band had created since the last time they published a recording was also a popular theme of organisation, or what had come out by various artists that many people had liked. The music machine had a remote control, of course it did. He was getting used to the machines to control other machines now, and it was certainly very useful for him, stuck in bed as he still was.
Bach was his favorite composer, and most days he would just have a single record in the player and play it repeatedly, but at other times he liked other things. There was a series of four Mozart records, which had singing in it, a whole story of singing, and with muggle notions of magic in it. It was in German, and sometimes he enjoyed that one too, although he didn’t speak much German. Mostly, though, he liked listening to new music. He started moving beyond the classical, too.
He tried to stay calm: No one who mattered would see him like this, no one would need to know. Still, just knowing it about himself was so shameful it hurt. Even if he hadn’t done it himself, his face still had a beard on it, at his age. There were stories of wizards who tried to grow one early, of course, but early had meant in their fifties, and those stories were not nice ones either, and usually marked the beginning of a descent to madness. But there was no way he could explain that to poor Mary, who clearly had no idea what she had done to him.
Kenny woke him the next morning, and they moved through Draco’s morning routine together, a little clumsily. The porridge tasted a little different than Mary made it, but it had more jam on it, and Draco didn’t mind. Kenny had to spend some time looking for a clean pyjama, because Draco had no idea where they were stored, and that wasn’t written down in any of the papers Kenny had found in the office after Draco had gone to bed. But eventually Draco had a clean face and mouth and was wearing his clean pyjama. Daywear was still beyond him, but he now changed pyjamas every other day, oh, sweet progress, sweet hygiene! Over that he was wearing a dressing gown in dark blue silk – he liked that one so much he had asked Mary to get him one several in different colours, all dark, so he always had a clean one to wear. Spills, after all, was a fact of life now, as was the lack of cleaning spells, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t do his part to look appropriate.
After, he cried violently for several minutes, and then suddenly stopped, clear-headed, clear-hearted. He had his mother back. Next time they talked, he determined, he would thank her properly for sending him here. And ask her about the war. And tell her about the nazis.
The first thing he was aware of was a sharp, unpleasant taste in his mouth. Unfamiliar, disturbing. The smell, too, was unfamiliar. Not just like the presence of a smell, but like something was missing, something that should be there but just wasn’t.
In the living room, Harry was sat with a large, purple mug Draco hadn’t realised he owned, steaming, holding the booklet for The Spaghetti Incident CD by Guns’n’Roses. Not Draco’s favorite CD, but he still felt a lurch in his stomach, a fear that Harry would have damaged the booklet. It was easy to do, at first, with CD booklets, trying to get them out of their case. Harry was wearing the head phones too, hooked up to Draco’s CD player. His head was tilted back, his eyes half-closed. Draco deliberately rolled into view. Harry gave a gratifying little jump, and put the booklet aside, threw off his head phones.
I'm at the stage of writing where several things should happen first, and I am trying to wrangle the next few chapters into a good structure. At least I am learning a lot about structure?
He could look around his room, too, which was interesting at first. It had a big window that followed the entire wall to the left of his bed, and when the curtains were open, he could see the sky. There were two doors, one to the hall and one to his bathroom. He really wondered about muggle bathrooms, but there was no way to ask about those either. There was also a big closet and some shelves, and a low table with two comfortable chairs.
“Well, needs must, I suppose. Your mother owled me on Wednesday, saying she had heard from you and that you were alive and doing a lot better. I was so happy to hear it!”
“Okay, now I really need to listen to what you consider good country music. Go put some on while I do the dishes, then.”
“Do you have a cellphone, Harry? Call an ambulance. Right now. I’ll just. Fuck.” And then Mohammed started moving Mary around, placing her in an odd sideways position, tilting her head back slightly, and then leaning over her as if to give her a hug, but stopping over her body, keeping himself very still.
The worst of it was that he had already missed seven months, and it was now mid-june, 2002, as opposed to november 2001. He had been kept in an artificial coma as even doing what he was doing now, thinking, small movements, that kind of thing, would have made him worse, apparently. This infuriated him, but he couldn’t have said why. It certainly wasn’t Mary’s fault. She had stolen those months in a sense, he supposed, but only to save his life. She certainly seemed to know what she was doing. A competent muggle – not something he had been prepared for, though he supposed they must exist.
“She made that public, where I am? Not that I need it to be a secret or anything – the spreading of it is all yours, if you want, and if she hasn’t.”
Draco assented. He was a little amused, though, by the mix of authority and attempt at not overruling Draco’s independence. It was exactly like Mary (oh, he hoped she was okay) had told him they were taught in nursing school. He couldn’t remember madame Pomfrey caring much what the patient wanted, come to think. She knew what was best for you, and that was that. But then again, madame Pomfrey had never been to muggle nursing school.
Draco snuck his handkerchief out of his pocked, dabbed at his eyes. If birthdays were about being seen, like he had thought earlier, then he absolutely was being seen.
Well, Draco sighed, that made sense. After all, how would they know how many of the people sent into the muggle world died of the disease, and how many died of other things, such as breaking the statute and getting killed? Or being abandoned by their muggle carers, who, after all, was apparently paid in advance? It was not like they could ask the ones who didn’t come back what had happened. Surely that sort of thing accounted for at least some of the deaths, he thought.
Of course he had been screaming for Vincent. Draco had thought he was so brave at the time, and yet he had been such a coward, so unwilling to confront anything, unwilling to listen to that voice inside that said something was wrong, or to his mother for that matter. But that would all be nonsense to Kenny. He didn’t know about any war, of course, and he couldn’t know either.
“Nice,” she repeated again, economical with words and syllables in a way she had never had to bee before. But Draco knew her, he knew she would have used more words, would have said something like “Yes, haven’t I always said that Mohammed is a very nice young man.” And probably she would have added something about how clever he was, too, always reading his advanced math books behind the reception counter when there was nothing to do, and how clever it was to get a job like that as a student, if you could handle the interruptions. And possibly she would add something about the stroke, but of course, that was new, so he didn’t know what she would say there.
“And then there is the way I need your help for everything,” he said “That is being in your power too.” Not that he had ever been truly independent, he was used to doing with the help of house elves, of course, but that was different. And he definitely had the power over the elves, so it didn’t matter as much that he needed them to... oh no. He had the power in that relationship, and he had no idea how that might look from below. He had always heard that the elves liked to serve, of course, but only from other wizards. He could sense a cascade of implicaations ready to bury him.
Now that he had been outdoors, it felt like everything was possible, though of course he understood it would still be slow going. For now, he and Kenny went outside every Wednesday, but they never ventured far. Draco had rolled up and down the street, a short distance each time. He had even crossed a busy street, which had been terrifying – Kenny had assumed Draco knew the traffic rules, whereas Draco didn’t know anything about that but what he had surmised from seeing what little traffic he could see from his balcony. Kenny kept reassuring him to behave as a pedestrian – Draco, you count as a pedestrian even though you’re on wheels, no, you’re not a bike, argh, Draco, just act as if you’re walking wherever that’s possible. On the plus side, all of Draco’s confusion was chalked up to the wheelchair, so that, at least, was something.
nudge had their suspect stumbling inside. "You can tell the Wizengamot all about how innocent you are tomorrow morning."
So lost was Harry in these musings that he didn't notice the fire in the grate flicker green.  Nor did he notice when Hermione emerged from the flames.  It wasn't until she crossed the room and placed her hand lightly on his arm that Harry woke to her presence.
"I think you look great," Harry leant in and murmured softly.  "Remind me later to show you how grateful I am that you wore the jumper."
"Pansy!"  Draco flushed; he couldn't help it.  Even after over twenty years of friendship, Pansy's own particular brand of honesty never failed to embarrass him.
They'd spent the previous day moving Ron and Hermione into their new flat; something Harry's muscles were very much protesting after the event.  Their new home was small and cramped and basic, and Harry couldn't for the life of him see why they didn't just live together at Grimmauld Place like he had suggested.  But his friends were happy and so excited and not even Molly Weasley's disapproval could dampen their spirits, so Harry wasn't going to either.  He humped boxes with a pasted-on smile and acted for all the world like he was happy for them.
The woman turned to smile at Blaise, but her expression froze when it landed on Harry. He could hardly blame her, Harry supposed.  The idea of Draco Malfoy describing Harry Potter as an
Harry nodded in agreement and ignored the quiet voice that pointed out Luna had been imprisoned in Malfoy’s home, and Hermione tortured there, so it was plenty personal for them too.
"Are you feeling quite well, darling?"  Narcissa reached forward as if to feel Draco's forehead, but he moved back just in time.
"She also thinks it's fixable." Harry pauses, because he values Hermione's opinion above all others. She never coats the truth for him. "It is fixable, right?"
Harry usually knew exactly what to expect when he came home from work at night – a dark, empty house, with no one but a disgruntled house-elf for company.
Draco blinked once, then twice, but even after a third go he found he could no longer deny the expression on Potter's face showed clearly just how much he thought this was a brilliant idea.
"I had a really nice time tonight." Draco settled back on the sofa, wine in hand, and smiled warmly at Harry.
Ginny's shudder was neither small nor faked.  "That's not even funny."  And her tone certainly bore that out.  "You know, this really wasn't what I had in mind when I suggested you try new things this year."
Astoria set the rescued booklets back on the desk with a slam and fixed Pansy with a glare.  Draco watched in amusement, because if Astoria thought she could out-bitch Pansy, well, she was
It was just that he was starting to feel a little overwhelmed by the sense of being left behind.  The feeling that everyone else knew what they were doing, and were moving towards it, while Harry was standing still.
, because the truth was he had no idea.  And the less exposed his floundering was, the happier Harry would be.
Harry decidedly ignored her hints – he was already confused enough without going there.  "I haven't made my mind up yet."
"Just the ones that force you to marry someone you don't love."  Once again the words left his mouth before his brain had chance to screen them.
Harry slumped back in his seat, arms folded across his chest, a stubborn expression marring his boyish face.  “Fine.  Whatever.”
"Don't worry, I won't do it again."  Harry didn't necessarily mean for the words to come out that sharply, but he was hurting, and Malfoy was just sitting there like nothing had happened.
"You may have a point."  Draco frowned slightly for a moment before his expression cleared.  "She'll be gone for ages, though.  She and Aunt Andromeda can talk for Britain once they get started."
The parquet floor was polished to an impressive shine, and Harry could already picture Teddy skidding along on his knees the next time he came to visit. The walls had been painted a soft yellow colour, bringing light to the previously gloomy hallway. The banisters had been stripped and waxed, and the rest of the woodwork freshly painted. It really did look amazing, and this was just the first room.
"That doesn't make any sense." But then it did, and Harry could feel the heat rise in his cheeks again. "I don't…That's ridiculous."
He juggled his unwieldy burden into one hand and, with the other, rapped smartly on the door.  The snow was starting to fall heavily now, and he silently willed Hermione to answer sharpish.
"It's not that simple," Malfoy said, taking a step backwards. "I can't just disappoint my family to make you happy."
“Yes, we are,” Ron retorted.  “Someone needs to say it, and as I’m the only other person who knows, it’s going to have to be me.”
They appeared in the hallway of Grimmauld Place with a loud crack, but not even the shaky landing could distract them from the task at hand.  Their lips practically devouring each other, while eager fingers tugged at clothing that impeded their path.
"Did you have something in mind?"  Draco asked carefully – he was mindful that the last time this had happened, he'd wound up babysitting an excitable Teddy Lupin.
"Sorry to disappoint, Gin."  Harry allowed a hint of a smile to cross his face.  "But the only date I've got tonight is with Madam Pince.
Where flattery was going to get Harry was never quite clarified because Malfoy broke off into a hacking cough that rattled loudly in his chest.
Harry didn't miss the insinuation in Snape's tone.  "I've seen him three times in six years; we're hardly best friends."
"What about you?"  Harry really didn't feel up for this conversation right now.  "I hardly think working for George was your dream job."
Pansy seemed to take his silence as embarrassment rather than denial. "I must admit that I'm a bit surprised. Not that it's you and Draco – that kind of makes sense, thinking about it – but I didn't realise you were…"
Harry nodded. “Trust me.”  He turned Draco round gently and tied the silky black fabric over his eyes, then guided him towards the kitchen.
It was the first time that Harry had referenced their past relationship in a positive light, and Draco was not willing to let the moment pass.  "That was a wonderful holiday, wasn't it?" he asked.
Again, sick Malfoy held off on the usual protests. If anything he looked a tiny bit relieved. Harry took a firm hold of his arm and spoke in a clear voice. Moments later then tumbled out into another fireplace, and after a moment scramble, managed not to fall.
"Yes, Harry, we've seen it.  We'll need to set another place for Christmas dinner - Blaise will be joining us."
Potter simply shrugged, and the flush became more visible.  Draco could see where it disappeared under the crisp collar of Potter's shirt, and couldn't help but wonder just
Quite unable to resist teasing further, Harry slid the tip of his wand down his sleeve and gazed steadily at his best friend.  "Do you really want to chance it?"
"It's okay, Ron.  I can handle this."  Harry turned round slowly and felt that familiar twist in his stomach.
Harry nodded, suddenly struck dumb by the sight of his dream car combined with the even more astonishing sight of Lucius Malfoy in jeans.
Harry swallowed hard.  It had been a long time since he'd heard that word used to refer to the two of them.  "I guess," he said softly, turning back to the kettle.  "We can thank Hermione for that."
Neville makes his excuses after a short while and goes to relieve a very grateful Hannah from behind the bar.  Harry tries his hardest not to stare wistfully at the tender kiss they share.
"Did you know he was going to be here?"  Harry's gaze drifted back to the dance floor just in time to see Draco's partner licking his neck.
Draco relaxed visibly at these words and melted further into the embrace, standing so close that barely a breath separated them.  They stayed like that for what seemed like the longest time, eyes locked in an intense gaze that both seemed loathe to break.
Biting back every retort that sprang to mind, including several that were entirely too witty to be wasted in this manner, Draco gestured vaguely at the empty seats.
A faint blush coloured Draco’s cheeks.  “So how’s Ron now?  Has Hermione calmed him down from the ceiling, or can I expect to be hexed when I get to work tomorrow?”
Unable to bear the discomfort any longer, Draco nodded and then turned to leave.  He'd got barely three feet away before the sound of his name stopped him in his tracks.  He turned slowly to find Blaise still in the doorway watching him with something indefinable in his eyes.
Harry grinned in response, and as if to bear out the truth in Draco's words, Pansy's strident tones soon echoed through the flat.
Malfoy stepped a little closer, his brow creased with a frown.  "I've handled this badly," he said finally, before raking one hand distractedly through his hair.  "What I said, about it being a mistake – that wasn't true."
, Harry," Ron explained, with just the slightest hint of irritation in his voice.  "Bent.  He likes taking it up—"
From the moment he had arrived home from work, Snape had been driving Harry crazy.  Obviously he got bored in the house alone during the day, with only Kreacher for company, so Snape was making up for lost time.  The relentless digs, snide remarks, and constant demands for information were more than Harry could stand.  Were it not for the fact he knew Draco would never forgive him, he would have moved the portrait to the attic in a heartbeat.
Harry choked slightly on his coffee.  "A television?"  he repeated.  "Lucius Malfoy, king of all things pureblood has a TV?  That's priceless."
Secretly Harry couldn't help but wonder how this affected business at the shop, but he knew he'd never actually ask.
Draco walked back behind his desk and sank into chair with a sigh.  He winced when the slamming of the outer door echoed through the room and announced Astoria's departure from the building.
"Would want you to be happy, too.  However that happens."  She followed this up with another glance towards the door.
The sound of voices from downstairs was enough to rouse him from the cocoon of warm sheets. Malfoy clearly had company and it wasn't the high-pitched chatter of house-elves. Curiosity peaked, he grabbed jeans and t-shirt from where he'd dropped them the night before and quickly dressed.
Draco got to his feet, curiosity written all over his face.  “What’s going on?” he muttered quietly.
Harry's not sure if he's happy or if he regrets asking that question when Malfoy squeezes between him and the back of the sofa, their joined hands between their bodies, and Malfoy's free hand on his stomach.
to be there, and the temptation to say 'fuck it all' and leave was a struggle he wasn't sure he had the energy to fight much longer.
"Harry," Hermione reached out for another chip, evading Harry's attempts to stop her. "Ron and I didn't talk about his love life
Harry barely had one foot out of the portrait hole when he spotted Ginny leaning against the wall, an almost amused gaze fixed on him.
Harry heard Neville mumble his excuses behind and then the click of the door as he escaped to the garden. Not that he paid it much heed, Harry's attention was on the scattering of familiar photographs and the slight ache they evoked in his chest. "It wasn't a lie," he said, tone just a little sulky. "I haven't touched these in years."
Once satisfied they could not be over heard, Draco took a deep breath and turned on his friend.  "Whilst I appreciate your concern for Astoria's well being, this is neither the time, nor any of your damn business."
“Do you two think you could rein it in a bit, please?  It’s bad enough that I’ll have to spend Christmas listening to my mother’s constant bitching, without you two taking me for a trial run.”
Harry smiled slightly at this.  Ron might be volatile, but he really did have a good heart, and Harry made a mental note to give his friend the benefit of the doubt more often.  "I really am sorry, you know?  I was still getting used to it myself."
"No!"  Draco reached out involuntarily towards Potter, but managed to stop himself just in time.  Then, before Harry could argue that point, which it was obvious from his expression he intended to do, Draco continued.  "I didn't mean that.  I meant...you don't have to pretend like nothing happened anymore."
"Fuck off."  But the smile on Draco's face softened the words.  "You want a glass of wine?" he offered, picking a bottle up off the side and gesturing in Blaise's direction.
“It’s certainly unusual.” Hermione ignored Ron’s amused snort. “But this is Luna we’re talking about.  Did you really expect her wedding to be entirely traditional? Even to please Mrs Longbottom?”
As he and Harry strode towards their usual spot they passed Neville Longbottom, who, Draco had been surprised to find, was responsible for tending the plants.
"What?  Agree with him?"  Hermione shook her head, now-tamed curls bouncing softly with the movement.  "Your private life is just that."  She leant forward and pressed a light kiss to his unshaven cheek.  "I'd better be off.  Anthony's mother will have a fit of the vapours if I'm late."
, and Draco thought he wouldn't change it for all the hearts and flowers in the world.  No more idle daydreams or furtive wanks that left him empty inside – this was
Harry couldn't help but remember Malfoy's expression when he'd talked about living at Malfoy Manor, and couldn't help feel sympathetic at the prospect he'd be forced to return.  Living somewhere so full of unhappy memories wasn't good for anyone.  And after moving into Grimmauld Place at the end of the war, Harry knew all about that.
Draco laughed and shuddered at the same time.  "Poor baby," he soothed, and added a pat to Pansy's head as he got to his feet.
Harry shook his head.  "Sledgehammer," he explained with a grin.  "You're covering up the missing plaster until I get around to redoing it."
"Special request from Mr Malfoy."  The girl -- Emily, Harry's brain supplied suddenly -- blushed a little at this and then promptly disappeared before he could reply.
Of course, his mind being occupied so heavily in other areas meant that Draco was far less focussed on more trivial matters – his homework, for instance.  A little too much pressure in a moment of distraction – and really, when Potter licked his lips like that, it was only to be expected – and the sharp crack of Draco's quill snapping filled the air around them.
Harry isn't sure if he wants to kiss or kill Hermione when she invites them to join their table, but when Draco's squeezes a chair in at his side, their knees knocking occasionally, Harry's mind is made up.  Hermione's getting flowers tomorrow.
Dragging on a pair of jogging bottoms, Harry headed out of his room in search of caffeine.  Draco was already up and seated at the table, his usual black coffee in his hand.  Before Harry had the chance to speak to him, he heard a shrill voice coming from the living room.
A flash of red caught Harry's attention.  He turned just in time to see Draco emerge from Madam Malkins, resplendent in his Auror robes, and clutching numerous bags.  Harry quelled the urge to rush forward and touch.
Ginny made a choked sounding noise that was lost somewhere between a laugh and a sob.  "Don't."  She shook her head slightly.
"Ah, yes, lunch with the Weasels.  I still can't believe you're going to that.  What ever happened to 'It's just sex'?"
Blaise shrugged.  "I guess."  He paused and fiddled aimlessly with the salt cellar.  "I'm not surprised," he blurted out suddenly.  "I mean, it was bound to catch up with her eventually."
“Not as such,” Draco replied, drying his hands on the tea towel.  “It turns out that despite his rather illustrious pedigree, he was, shall we say, rather impoverished and looking for a meal ticket.  The idiot thought our Pans had more in the bank than she actually has.  He got quite the nasty shock when he found out.”
Snape's usually narrowed eyes widened at this piece of information.  "If you've hung me next to that rabid woman, I'll...Portrait or not, I
"Fine, I won't mention it again." She pulled her hands back across the table and curled them around her teacup. "So are you going to ask him again?"
"I'm fine, Mother," Draco replied quickly – the last thing he wanted was for her to start trying to dose him with potions.  "Just a little full, that's all."
Astoria sees his approach before Draco does. Her eyes widen, then narrow, and Harry wants to hate her for the hand she has on Draco's arm. But the look of resignation that finally settles on her face just makes him sad. A few whispered words in Draco's ear and she steps away, eyes carefully avoiding Harry's this time, but her body language speaking volumes.
Draco looked up from his mound of paperwork finally.  He'd been trying his best to tune Astoria out for the better part of the morning, but it appeared that she had something she wanted to get out and wasn't going to give up until he listened.
And he had a sneaking suspicion he'd never forgive himself either.  It had been long enough.  It was time to face up to the past.  And dressed like this, Harry felt more than ready to do it.
“I have no idea where you put all the food you eat,” Hannah replied, as she grabbed an order pad.  “You’re skinny as a rake.”
Years of sneaking around this castle undetected stood Harry in good stead, and only a few minutes later he had made his escape and was heading up to Gryffindor Tower.
“Honestly, Harry.” Luna gave Neville an indulgent smile, before fixing her gaze on Harry.  “I’m sure you can put the past behind you for one day.”  And there was a note of steel in Luna’s voice that implied he’d better or there’d be consequences.
Ron frowned and rubbed at his face.  "You have to come," he replied.  "Hermione's got her heart set on everything being perfect.  First Christmas in the new home and all that crap."  He shrugged.  "It won't be the same without you there."
"Bloody vicious beast," he muttered, waving his arms around in an effort to shoo her away.  A small voice in the back of his mind suggested he could just run, head back into the living room and slam the door shut.  But his pride would not allow it.
"Five minutes."  Draco's voice floated up the stairs and dragged Harry back to the present.  Reluctantly he threw back the duvet and sat upright.  Cupping his hands around his drink, Harry inhaled the rich aroma of freshly-brewed coffee; for that reason alone he was tempted never to let Draco leave.
If he'd had any thoughts about what Draco's question meant, Potter didn't show them.  He just let out a wry chuckle.  "It can't be any worse than listening to Ron bang on about how Hermione has abandoned us."
Harry shrugged. "It's your fault it's not done – I've taken enough grief from him over the last few weeks because you've been too busy fantasising about Parkinson to do any actual work."
Hermione surveyed her work, not without pride.  "Not bad, is he?  Rose has been dying to make one ever since the snow started.  Ron wanted to do it, but he's so busy at work lately."
Harry sat back in his chair, arms folded defensively.  "Yeah, well, believe it or not, so have mine."
"Well, you'd better do something soon.  Pansy's on the verge of interfering, and you know there's no telling what she's likely to do."
As always, thank you to the mods for running this wonderful fest, and for their endless tolerance and patience!!  Thank you to my beta for being available at incredibly short notice several times.  And thank you to   for your endless fandom efforts.  Hopefully this will leave you feeling thoroughly glomped!
Potter gave that infernal shrug of his again.  "Not necessarily.  I just don't see myself doing much formal entertaining."
"Not really, no."  Draco had had an inkling about Hermione's intentions since that first dinner invitation some months ago. He hadn't expected Potter to figure it out so quickly, truth be told, but now that he had, Draco wasn't going to lie about it.
Draco shuddered visibly.  "Let's just say I've learned to knock really loudly before entering any rooms."
"He's my father."  Despite the failings he had been forced by the war to acknowledge, Draco still afforded his father the respect due to that role.
"I didn't plan to," Draco said, before taking a sip of his water.   "After the war there were a lot of pureblood families who couldn't afford the upkeep on their homes anymore – supporting Voldemort didn't come cheap."
When the last elf had left the room, and only the sound of their small feet pattering on the stairs could be heard, Draco gazed after them wistfully.  "Can we keep one?" he asked plaintively of Harry.  "That elf of yours is too old to be up to much, and I'm sure mother wouldn't mind."
Nothing had happened, but just enjoying the closeness of being in the same bed as Draco had been a wonderful experience for Harry.  Intimacy was not something that came easily to him – having been starved of affection during his formative years, Harry had struggled to learn how to show it to others.  But with Draco it seemed to be second nature.
Evidently Draco took pity on him, because the next time Harry peeked through his fingers, the room was a much more friendly hue.
"Every way," Draco replied in exasperation.  He paused to pour a coffee before continuing.  "It's been going on for a while now, according to Mother.  First there was the music, but she just used Silencing Charms for that.  Then he had a," Draco paused here, obviously searching for the right word, "television installed."
"Don't be so prejudiced, Ron." Hermione fixed a steely glare on her boyfriend. "Millicent is an excellent Auror candidate – Kingsley told me so himself."
"You could at least try and guess."  Harry's bottom lip pouted ever so slightly - he hadn't lived with Draco all these years without picking up a few mannerisms.
“Poor bloke, my arse, Weasley.”   Harry and Ron looked up as a now fully-clothed Pansy entered the room.   “He was a gold-digging parasite who got what was coming to him.”
It was dark when Draco woke.  He knew instantly something wasn't right, but it took him a few seconds to work out what exactly.  A quick stretch and it all became clear – he was alone in bed.  When Draco had fallen asleep, Harry had been wrapped around him like a sleeping cat in its owner's lap – but not anymore.
"Yes.  He likes you.  A lot."  He used his grip on Harry's shoulders to give him a slight shake.  "Now for Merlin's sake, put us all out of our misery and do something about it.
"I'm already impressed." Harry admitted it begrudgingly. It was the truth, but he couldn't quite help the sulky tone that came with it.
Malfoy turned slowly to face him – or, at least, it felt like an age to Harry.  His mouth stretched in a smile that was warmer than any expression he had ever directed at Harry before.  "Potter.  Nice to see you.  Didn't think this was your sort of thing."
"Don't make me spit in your food, Potter," Draco replied good-naturedly as he exited the room.  Harry grinned to himself and took a moment to ponder the delight that was Draco Malfoy's arse in pyjamas.
, it was the obvious thought behind it that meant so much to Harry. Added to the fact that Malfoy had hit upon the very career that Harry had been considering, and there was no way he could keep the silly grin from his face.
Malfoy looked around the room, his nose scrunched in obvious confusion at Harry's words. "Sticking Charms?" he asked finally, expression clearing.
Draco looked over to where Charlie Weasley – a fine figure of a man, even Draco was forced to admit – was sitting really rather closely to a dark-haired man with vivid blue eyes.  He swallowed hard.  "Your parents don't mind?"
"I said so, didn't I?" Ron dug deep in his pocket and produced a pouch that jangled slightly.   "Here y'are."  He held it towards her, but Ginny took a step back, hands out in front of her.
Only Malfoy didn't say anything straight away.  There were no insults or smart remarks, and when he did open his mouth it was only to say a simple "Sorry."
Ron sat up in bed sharply.  "What?  Don't tell me that git turned you down?  He should be bloody grateful to have you interested.  You're quite a catch."  Then, seeing Harry's amused expression, Ron added quickly, "according to
"Well, you were wrong," she says simply. "You tried to hide part of your lives away from us, and I know you thought you were protecting him – from us, from the public – but I think you just made him feel like you were ashamed."
Harry chose to walk home from work that night.  Normally he'd Floo straight from the shop into his living room, but tonight he was hoping that the biting winter air would wake him up, invigorate him for the evening to follow.
"That you don't have to do it anymore."  Malfoy finally released his hold on Harry's hand, allowing long fingers to softly stroke his wrist as they unfurled.
“Oh,” Harry replied, somewhat stumped.  He had been expecting something more…well, just something more.  “Of course you can come,” he added hurriedly when his silence caused his guests to shift uneasily.  “But what about your holiday?  You were really looking forward to it on Friday.”
"I don't think so."  Draco reached out and took the pile of clothing off her.  "He's too quick to see the good in everyone.   I mean, this is a man who has Professor Snape hanging on his wall because it's the
The now familiar image of Malfoy in a taffeta dress came to mind and Harry grinned, just a little. “No.  I mean, I see him in passing at the Ministry, but we haven’t spoken in years.  Luna’s probably keeping us apart as much as possible.”
Harry’s breath caught as he felt the cool touch of Draco’s fingers on his skin, as he carefully brushed damp strands of hair out of his eyes.
"But if you ever want me, or those bloody elves, out from underneath your feet, you're going to have to let us get the job done. And if that means putting up with a bit of noise, or remembering you’re a wizard, then that's what you'll have to do. Okay?"
Harry just shrugged.  He didn't need Ginny to explain that to him, but silence was much easier than trying to explain that he didn't know how.  "It's an important year," he said weakly.
"All right.  Harry it is."  Narcissa gave a smile that Draco had rarely seen bestowed on anyone else but him.
"So what changed?" Ron clearly wasn't happy with the situation still, but the anger seemed to have faded. "Why today?"
Ron rolled his eyes and sat at his desk – a plain cup of tea clutched in his hand.  "I had to pick some things up for the party tonight," he explained.  "Hermione's orders."
"Spare me the details, please," Draco replied, and held up his hands as if to ward off further overshares.
The despondent expression on Potter's face made Draco's insides flip in a way he would never admit to.  "It's not that uncommon to think like that," he reassured.   "Buying a home is a big step – it's only natural that you want to get it right."
