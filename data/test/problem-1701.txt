Uncle Jason was a man of few words, but when he spoke it was often biting to the individual who heard it. He directed a conversation that pointed out truths, the discomforting ones an individual would have rather left to rot than to be spoken out loud, the ones most people fail to face in life and take to their grave. He was young, however, so as usual Uncle Jason's words had left him struggling to grasp the implications. He was soon distracted by the sweet flavour with it's sour twinge.
"Look," he started, "I rather think of myself adopted by my aunt, although my mother and father remains well. I'd not impose, but I would like to have you as a sister, in the same manner my Aunt and Uncle remains close despite their different blood."
"He's grown," Vivian pointedly began, "I've been showing him the trial for his guardianship I've participated in but seven years ago. He was particularly taken with the subject, and decided to approach his father with Jason's aid. I did not expect that to be his first course of action, but it's an improvement, don't you think?"
Vivian leaned forward and wiped her thumb over the scratches over the iron handle.
The girl tipped her head to the side, then to the other, and pointed towards the air above his shoulders.
They glared at each other.
Two, his elf was extremely loyal to his son.
Vivian turned to her brother with distaste, as she quite disliked rushing into matters without the pleasure of second guessing what the other had prepared. Especially when the map seemed to be as long as the conversation would be. The ink black hair of Owen fell into disarray as he rubbed his face into his hands, his golden glasses frame dislocated before falling back into place.
"You remember every word." Vivian finally spoke.
(See the end of the chapter for
"And Lucius?"
"A werewolf at prospective hiring for Hogwarts, disappearance of 'Dark' wizards and witches in England, decrease of students at Mahoutokoro, Koldovstoretz and the Russian government have passed their limited-entry motion for all foreigners, Castelobruxo is wavering on the matter of closing their exchange student program or continuing it."
"Gtrivanka is the family name of a student in Durmstrang." Draco frowned.
He closed his eyes, and counted to three.
His mother had proposed two names, and had told him the history of both.
He glanced at his colleague.
"Moved where?"
Those who had been tallying the scores breathed a sigh of relief. Other Slytherins simply frowned, while Draco, stared down Hermione Granger, who'd half risen from her seat with a mumbling protest on her mouth. Not only was he glaring at her attempt, but she'd received half of the Gryffindor's stares from doing so, and Ron Weasley's grip across both of her arms.
It was silence which greeted Erlnier when he first met Chartres de Barr, his beady eyes assessing and his wrinkled face creasing into dissatisfaction. He didn't have the urge to prove himself, as he usually would have wanted, and instead grimaced back. They had not seen each other since.
"She is."
"An approval once earned is never taken back, like the Crow's Head. Whatever goes on in there, is supervised and never interfered. We don't have a restricted library, like Hogwarts, so all books of all manners and topics can be easily accessed. Also the reason why our healers are recognised around the Worlds, as they've dealt with far too many curses."
Draco had wished not to meet anyone before his introduction to the Slytherins. In fact, when they had both decided to enter such a house with the surprise of realising how divided Hogwarts seemed to be, the last thing Draco had wished to confront were the students themselves, which was why they had seated themselves at such early hours.
"I'm glad you've had your manners well-taught. Is it your mother? Vivian would have taught you to bite the finger off."
"It was worth being rude everywhere." He commented as he watched a very tall, knife-wielding woman stomp his way.
Blaise slumped in his chair and found meticulous curiosity of his robes, while Draco began:
"Master Regulus the First liked the House of Fawley. The House of Fawley is master Regulus' friend. Master Regulus had business with the House of Fawley."
When Blaise took his eyes off the book he was reading, he was met with red-rimmed eyes.
"Mr. Scrimgeour. Are you sure? He's a stickler for the rules."
"Harry Potter's here." He said instead.
"There's nothing as uncertain as a destabilised ministry after years of conflict, you know this as well as I do."
"The problem is," Jason interfered, "I couldn't place the exact date of their time of deaths because I was to busy figuring out how to extract Owen from the French headquarters."
Black, she emphasised, so as to separate Narcissa from her husband's standing in society. Vivian watched the corner of Narcissa's eyes crinkle and wondered if she had understood.
They moved down five streets towards the herbal store, and Luna would have casted had Draco not pulled her back.
Slowly, carefully, he unrolled his magic. It came out of him like a tide, which with his blood of Black was harder to control but easier to roam, and the house groaned its path open. The doors rattled open, and some portraits began to mutter awake. Blacks were thunder to his ears, with a handful of rain but nothing more, a slow rumble in the distance with no lightning. This was the canvas of which the Black children grew from, free to add their flair of more rain and wind.
Draco smiled stiffly at the hum of his band.
"What a talkative person." Blaise whispered as he watched Joheim leave.
"Your family renounced the hereditary magic," Draco snapped before they continued any further, "you shouldn't be able to feel sentient magic, at all."
"Amelia Bones?" An older Slytherin student leaned forward from his seat.
"Don't be greedy, children," Aunt Vivian patted their heads, "and do try to share."
"And your plans for today?"
"What can be made into a cake, sometimes black, sometimes white, and greater than anything on land?"
"Draco."
"That's what we've been asking the Grey Lady!" Fred started, "since she's a Ravenclaw and all, but a ghost, she's less likely to tell anyone." George finished.
"But I am afraid there had been a miscommunication, somewhere between our exchange. It is a rite of Hogwarts to greet students by the Sorting Hat. It appears, to me, that I have failed to mention the need for such tradition to be upheld."
"Hello, Hermione."
Witnesses were troubled souls, seen and spoken to all but of themselves. Lucius Malfoy's dark mark was nothing but a blemish when he had seen it manifest before his eyes, a dark outline of a skull and snake. The sun had been blazing, unlike Drumstrang's usual coldness, no wind or cooler tones in sight. Weather had pushed Draco to his home, his Aunt unavailable and his Uncle gone to who-knows-where, but in his French home had been his father, who had similarly come in flee of Britain's summer rain.
Draco plucked a feather out of his tea.
Draco flung his arms apart, the hat behind Dumbledore shifting, and was as startled as a thirteen-years-old could be.
"Well you're a lucky one!" The bartender snapped a mug down, "Mr. Crouch's been busy the entire month, he barely sends me a greeting!"
"Yeah, we'll help. Just spare us a dozen!" They bursted out into raucous laughter. Taysa, apparently, pondered for a moment more as she tapped a finger on the bar.
"I believe I have already told you everything you must know, and by your oath I can answer more questions you inquire than I could of anyone else." Vivian reassured.
"Possibly."
"I find it pitiful." He concluded.
"Malfoy," Higgs shouted, "can I see?"
"You've got to be a seeker. For me. Harry Potter's been Dumbledore's favourite for the past few years, Draco, we need to win fairly just this once. Everyone knows you're so
"Which means-"
on him, on it, and smiled.
"Mother may know, as much as this explains why Aunt Vivian had shown such-" Draco stilled. "Is
The Hufflepuffs in the corner, being the innocent souls they were, gasped as loudly as they could.
"To think, the House of Fawley was so valuable that it would foster one its own."
Marcus blinked at him. Draco glared back, and had to second-guess what he saw. Marcus was smiling.
Whoever decided to judge Durmstrang by its wooden exterior and rumours she pitied.
"That's what Draco has to find out, don't you think?"
"Come on, come on," Draco clenched the grass, "where are you."
"Does professor Snape favour you?" Cedric asked incredulously.
"Millicent Bagnold headed died on the 2nd on her way to meet Monsieur Chartres at the restaurant!"
"It's a miracle how they managed to place one of us into their records division," Luna idly wondered fluttering ten pages at a time, "wasn't that place all about high security and stuff?"
Draco's hand fluttered over the newspaper strewn over the desk before ceasing. By the very corner, was an application for a position in Defence Against the Dark Arts by the name of Remus Lupin. There was another set of letters to the side, addressed to a Percival, and finally, their formal applications to a student exchange program, second in recorded history between Durmstrang. Without reluctance, Draco immediately grasped those to hand, then to the nearest fire, despite the disapproving stare of another portrait far within.
"Can we make it snow pink, too? And, have that snow cause some kind of reaction? I've always wanted to see Dumbledore without a beard."
"What I do not understand, then, is the reason you seek out a Malfoy. If you are about to adopt an innocent child out of future conflict you may as well start up an orphanage."
"Muggles are created by the dilution of magic passed by an ancestor who once married another who'd long given up magic. In short, a witch decide to marry someone without magic, and their child married another muggle, and another, until magic diluted and appeared explosively under rare conditions generations later. Unfortunately, the increase of muggles meant the increase of less-knowns, and the less-knowns, largely known as squibs, are either left unattended in the muggle world or magical society. And in the span of growth left unattended, their magic becomes something vastly different from those who grew in protection of the wards, which instead disrupts the flow of magic between wards every time they enter any point of entry."
He winked out of existence.
Erlnier crouched and spoke haltingly.
"Sorry," Blaise growled, "Deprimo!" And Luna was sent flying back into the nearest bookshelf.
"Are you runed?" Draco asked incredulously towards his broom, "but you're a prototype."
Unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, the apothecary was closed. It seemed to have toed a line of illegality that shouldn't have been crossed, as the ministry's notice of closure was stuck to its window. Another red line crossed its door, a mark of imprisonment and indication of ministry and auror investigation. It was more likely to, however, be left abandoned in Knockturn for another year before residents of Knockturn begin to tear it down for their uses.
"Did you do something?"
"Kreacher will serve the Most Noble and Ancient House of Black. Kreacher will serve master Draco."
What remained before him was a path of blood and tears.
"Now, Blaise," Pansy clawed Blaise's shoulder, "we've been waiting for your return. It's less than polite to leave us waiting, don't you think? Perhaps an introductory greeting of your fellow friend for us to tear into?"
"There's a loaded revolver on the Headmaster's desk. He's using a weapon as a paper-weight for his papers. And a time-turner, just there. I suppose he assumes anything which looks like a decoration must be a decoration."
"We know Marcus pushed you to be a seeker, as your reputation's on the negative side of proper. General consensus is that you're the kind of person to take no sides only to aggravate a dispute. Your Quidditch victory was...unexpected, truer than a fault. Which is why Dumbledore may be further willing to upend the year's scores. He never gave Slytherin its highlights, only wins to dissuade dissatisfactions."
"Your belief that people grow by experience has finally led your own ward to his destruction," Catherine said as she finally watched the psychopath before her, "at least you did not kill him outright." She whispered.
The formal meeting was as stiff and boring as when it first began. The only interesting part of it all had been when five delegates began a shouting match over whether the case of illegal immigrants from the south coast of Italy should be held accountable to France's renewed entry and deportation acts.
Harry opens the door to his room. It’s the exact same but completely different from how Draco remembers. The furniture and layout haven’t changed but the feeling of the room is off. Sad and empty.
It was 9pm on December 23rd and Harry was wandering around London with an address scribbled on a paper in the palm of his hand. A couple months back, Draco had written a letter to Harry with an updated address so that Harry may visit him whenever he returned in London. At first, Harry had been upset that Draco had assumed he would come back, but now Harry was grateful. Draco did always know Harry better than he knew himself.
------
The second item was another picture. This one from their previous Christmas (and magical no less). Their friend in New York had photographed them under mistletoe, kissing each other with small smiles.
His hand begins to shake with it outstretched. “Take it,” he says. Harry stares at him dumbly. “Take it!” he says, louder now. Harry still just stands there. “Goddammit, Harry. Take the fucking jacket!” he yells. Harry reaches out, his eyes never leaving Draco’s. Harry notices that he’s crying when he pulls his hand back, this time with the jacket clasped between his fingers.
The whole time he talks he’s looking at Draco and the whole time, Draco does not look at him. He preocupes himself with drinking, combing his fingers through his perfect hair and making small remarks to Pansy or Theo. Harry can’t stand it, and by the time he grits out his final ‘thank you’ he feels faint.
Harry walks up stairs with Draco following close behind him. Draco had been at Grimmauld Place nearly every night they dated. He knows the house well. He runs his fingers up the railing as he walks and he remembers all the times Harry had pushed him against them as they kissed. He remembers fucking on the 3rd floor landing when they just couldn’t seem to make it to their bedroom. He also remembers sneaking down the stairs the day he left, clothes shrunken in his pocket. He remembers lingering on the stairs, thinking about turning back but he hadn’t. He shakes these thoughts away. ‘Tonight will be different,’ he thinks.
Draco’s crying too. Tears trickle down his face as he watches Harry bring the jacket to his nose and smell. Even though he only had it on for a few minutes, the jacket already smells like Draco. Warm and sweet, like vanilla.
“Harry,” Draco sighs against his lips. He’s pulling Harry closer, clinging to him.
Suddenly, he can’t even begin to think about doing anything but going to see Harry. He shouldn’t, he knows he shouldn’t do what he’s about to do but he can’t help it. He closes his eyes, releases the power that's still clenched in his fist and murmurs, “12 Grimmauld Place”.
“No really, Draco, let me help you,” Theo says. Draco notices the looks that his other friends are giving Theo and becomes angry.
“Harry!” Draco yells out again.
“Draco,” Harry sighs. He begins caressing Draco’s hair again. “You should have talked to me about your fears. I loved-I love you so much. I would never walk away from you, Draco. I choose you everytime. It’s always been you, Draco. Even when we were young and before I knew it too, it’s always you and it will always be you.”
“It’s the least I can do,” Draco says. He places the cups in the drying rack then wipes his hands clean on the dish towel Harry has by the sink.
“Help me take off this bloody jumper,” Harry complained, tugging at the fabric, “it's far too hot.”
I'll be home for Christmas
“And presents ‘neath the tree…”
Harry exits the bathroom in light blue sweats and a black tshirt. “All yours,” he says. “Feel free to use whatever you need.”
Draco placed the lube on the bed and helped Harry pull the jumper all the way off, raking his hands up Harry's torso. Harry wriggled under his hands as Draco began teasing his nipples with his thumbs, his other fingers encasing Harry’s ribs.
“Draco pleeeeaase.”
“I’m moving back, Draco.  Back to London. Back to you. Back to home,” Harry said. “Now please, Draco,” Harry said pressing his lips back against Draco’s, “Please, I’ve missed you. Fuck me, Draco.”
Draco withers around the floor of the forbidden forest, yelling out in pain. The Dark Lord has him under cruciatus curse. His evil snake like eyes gleam as he looks down at Harry who is tied and on the floor.
“You know,” Harry says, “I always dream about you.”
“Don't ever leave me again, Draco,” Harry whispered, pressing a kiss to Draco's hair.
Harry sits up and drags Draco up with him until Draco is sitting in his lap, never letting go of each other the entire time. Harry drags his hands lightly down Draco’s body which causes him to shiver. He brings his hands down underneath Draco’s shirt to feel his warm skin against his own.
Harry stopped trying to push himself on Draco. He just sat in his lap and finally gave a small smile. “As long as you’ll have me.”
Draco should leave it here, put it back and leave. But he can’t move his feet. He doesn’t want to unwrap the jacket from himself because it feels safe. It feels like home. He brings the collar to his nose and inhales. It’s a heady scent that makes him sober and drunk at the same time. It smells uniquely like Harry.
Harry nodded, holding Draco’s head to his jaw. Draco continued sucking deep marks into Harry’s jaw and rocking his hips to meet Harry’s. “Draco,” Harry whined.
------
“Yeah,” Harry says. He kisses Draco softy and spells them clean with wordless, wandless magic. Draco shivers underneath his hands.
“I thought you left again,” Harry whispers, so quietly Draco almost misses it.
Draco walks over to the left side and moves the covers of the bed slowly, as though he’s afraid he might rip them. Then he slips into them and looks down at his hands. “I thought you were done remodeling the house,” he says, commenting on the book.
Draco kisses Harry again. “I’m sorry. I won’t leave you. Not this time. Not ever. I love you, Harry.”
When Harry was close, Draco pulled his fingers out and gave his cock a small tug. “Ready?” he asked. Harry gave a small nod and then Draco pushed in slowly. Harry gasped as Draco pushed himself all the way in.
Draco gets up and walks to the free bar. There used to be a limit to drinks one could get in the earlier years, or else someone would have surely died from alcohol poisoning after drinking themselves silly due to grief. Thankfully, that restriction was lifted last year so Draco orders 2 shots of tequila and drowns them quickly. He then asks for a glass of fire whiskey and nurses it as he walks back to his table.
Harry was looking at Draco with lust filled eyes. His kinky hair was sticking up and some was stuck to his forehead from the sweat. Draco reached up with his free hand and gripped Harry’s hair. He pulled Harry forward to meet him for a kiss before releasing him and letting him fall back onto the bed. Draco added another finger and started fucking him, pulling his fingers in and out in a rhythmic pattern that had Harry squirming and begging for “more, please, Draco” in soft pants.
No one speaks for a while. Then, “I was scared,” Draco starts. “I was so fucking scared, Harry. I had never been so invested in someone else’s life, and I was scared because you meant so much to me. Ever since we were kids, everything I did, every action and every thought, revolved around you. I was scared when I realized just how intertwined we were. And I was terrified of you not wanting me. That one day you’d regret being with me and you’d leave. I was so scared of you and me so I left. And Harry, I have regretted that night everyday for the past year. I shouldn’t have done that to you. You deserve so much better,” Draco says.
Harry is staring at the Black family tree, tracing Draco’s linage, when his floo flairs. He’s changed out of his robes and suit in exchange for worn jeans and a soft t shirt. He stands up in the room and begins walking down the stairs to the living room. He’s thankful, as he walks down the staircase, that he’s remodeled the house after moving in 5 years ago. The house is brighter and more open. It has a classy, modern feel while still having small quirks that make it feel like a house that has been lived in. It makes him feel safer as he walks downstairs to meet his guest. ‘It’s probably Hermione or Ron coming to check on me,’ he thinks.
“You’re so beautiful, Harry,” Draco said, pulling back. He started unbuttoning his trousers and pulled off his jumper. He finished undressing then layed down on Harry again. “I love that you’re here, in my bed, in my clothes.”
“Everything. Sometime they’re good. We’re happy together, have a house, things like that. Sometimes we’re making love.” Draco lets in a sharp breath at that.
When he comes back out Harry is awake, staring at the ceiling with his hands stretched above his head. Harry doesn’t look at him as he crawls back into bed and lays down on his chest again. Harry brings his hand down tentatively and begins playing with Draco’s hair.
“And then sometimes, there are the nightmares.” He doesn’t continue. Draco doesn’t ask him to because he knows what those are. He gets them too. Harry lying dead in his arms, Harry in his own pool of blood, Harry not breathing, and Draco never being able to save him.
“So needy,” Draco tsked with a roll of his eyes but his smile betrayed his attitude. He grabbed the lube again and moved lower on Harry’s body. Sitting on his knees, he squirted some lube on his fingers and reached down slowly and began rubbing his fingers against Harry’s hole. Harry shivered beneath him as Draco slowly inserted a finger inside of Harry. “You’re so beautiful,” Draco says, slowly adding another.
Draco’s head falls back and he whimpers as Harry circles his slit with his thumb. Harry runs his hands along Draco’s length faster after that. His grip tightens just a little bit as he sucks on Draco’s throat, marking him.
Harry lets out a small laugh. “I am. Just want to touch up a few things,” he says.
“This is your fault,” he says in a slimey voice. “You did this to him.”
Harry peered out of his window onto the snowy streets of New York City. He and Draco Malfoy had been sharing a flat in Manhattan for the past two years before Draco decided to move back to Europe the past summer, leaving Harry behind. They had stumbled into each other the winter following the end of the war. They both had decided to move to the states, to New York City no less. Over a cup of coffee and a tour of the city, Draco had asked Harry if he had a roommate, and if not, would he be inclined to move in with him. Harry said yes immediately. He craved familiarity even if it was in his former rival.
Harry crawled over and rested his back to Draco's chest. For a while neither talked. Draco stroked Harry's hair, and Harry held Draco's free hand in his own and examined his knuckles and nails. Both were trying to process that this moment was real.
Harry’s breathing started to quicken and Draco felt himself growing tired. He was close and so was Harry. Harry tugged on his hair and Draco bent down and sucked on Harry’s throat. Harry held him there and used his other hand to grasp his throbbing prick. He fucked his hand in a natural rhythm every time Draco thrust into him.
Harry is rummaging in the drawers and he pulls out a pair of black sweats and a worn Magpies shirt. He hands it to Draco.
“It’s not that simple,” Draco says. He pushes his head up to look at Harry.
“You can stay.” Harry confirms. “I want you, Draco, for as long as you’ll have me.”
“Please, please, please,” he chants, clawing at Harry. The sting Harry feels on his back only increases his desire.
Draco smiled, “I’ve missed this.”
It was 2am when Draco got home. He unlocked his front door and immediately heard the sound of soft christmas songs playing. His heart stopped beating and his breath got lost in his throat.
Draco scoffed and throw the letter down onto the table. He wouldn’t be told what to do. But then again, he had been “moping” around and getting out before Christmas would be nice. First he had to get somethings in order.
Draco’s boots crunched the fresh snow in London. He walked down Diagon Alley with a cold, red nose. His gloved covered fingers were clutching parcels and bags as he made his way out onto the muggle streets. It was December 23rd and Draco was still making last minute shopping trips. He fondly recalled Harry nagging him beginning in November to do his Christmas shopping.
Like that, the elves forgave readily, as long as the person in question showed signs of making changes for the better. In that case, they couldn't imagine not forgiving them.
“But – the ‘Potter stinks’ badges? And the remarks about my ugly hair?” Potter looked so vulnerable; Draco had never seen him this vulnerable before.
Harry obviously laid on his side now, and stroked his cock firmly, while fingering his arse with his other hand.
“You’ll have to ask your parents if they want me to visit.” Harry smiled at the girl. He didn’t think Dudley would say yes.
Pawter and Meowfoy had a satisfying sex life with each other, but they would not stoop down to display their intercourse publicly. That was a doggish thing to do, and if someone had to teach Harry and Draco, Pawter and Meowfoy had no doubt, the dog-humans in the portrait would be less disinclined to instruct the grownup cubs.
Stirring twenty-seven times counterclockwise, Draco repeated his mantra these days: “Having to take a love potion for the next seven years won’t be as bad as it sounds. I’ll survive it and in seven years, I can take a male lover on the side. Or frequent Muggle gay clubs. It’s not like I have a chance with Harry anyway.”
“Sorry, no significant other in sight.” Draco said bleakly. He turned to Nippy. “Good afternoon, nice to meet one of the elves who took care of Paw.”
Kingsley had reluctantly accepted his resignation from the Auror department, and made sure he had a secret Floo connection to the houses of his very best friends that was personalized. Only Hermione and Ron, the Weasleys, Luna, Neville, Dean and Seamus, Lavender and Parvati, Andromeda and Teddy, Headmistress McGonagall and Kingsley himself could Floo to his house. He could Floo via one of their addresses if he wanted to go to any wizarding location.
“Of course not, it wouldn’t make sense to come and tell you, if I were the person who did it.” Draco was surprised at his own lack of anger with Weasley. But he knew that he would have been just as angry and asked the same kind of question, had Weasley told him of an attempt to spy on Pansy, Blaise, or Greg.
“Draco, what if there were a way you needn’t marry her? You wouldn’t need the love potion at all.” Pansy put a hand on Draco’s shoulder.
She told him the potion would wear off by itself at some time between in a few hours and in three days.
“If Mr. Draco needs anything else, Mr. Draco can call Kreacher any time.”
An hour later, Draco and Greg stepped out of the elevator at the DMLE. It had taken a lot of convincing from Greg for the welcome witch to let them into the ministry on Draco’s day off. She had accused them of nefarious intentions, but had no way of denying them the right to report a crime they witnessed.
He had found out that if he failed to get Draco out of this marriage deal, he could wait for seven years and hope Draco would take him to be his affair on the side. If it was true that he was the man Draco wanted. He believed after what Pansy and Narcissa had said that Draco would be more likely to fancy him than to fancy Astoria, but they might also be mistaken. Draco might have fancied him at Hogwarts, that didn’t necessarily mean that he wanted more than the friendship they had. They had grown up after their Hogwarts years after all.
When the healer had cast the charm, Achilles leaned over in the portrait. “Abraxas II. had my portrait painted over with Silentium Varnish. Luckily, the Weasleys hadn’t done the same to Uther’s picture.  He told our Draco, who transferred me to Uther’s painting. They brought us here last week. as the first, still behind the scene picture of the Wizarding LGBTQIA patron gallery. First same-sex couple married in any kind of rite after 1429.”
“No, I’ve focused on my work,” she tried to give Mr. Malfoy a forbidding look, but he ploughed on.
“No, why didn’t you tell me you fancied me?”
Draco had even managed to secure a cooperation with the Ministry, that made Kingsley’s Dark Heirloom Turn-in Act of 2004 feasible. Draco and Harry would break any curses on the artifacts in the Ministry. The difference between the Turn-In Heirlooms and the heirlooms that stayed in private ownership usually was the purpose of the artifacts. Categories D 2-7 (D for danger) were confiscated, or in case you inherited them or found them in your attic, you were obliged to give them to the DMLE, as well as Category Q 5-7 (Q for questionable). If you owned a D 1 or a Q 1-4 artifact, you could keep it, but the problem was that these artifacts could be combined and were sometimes more dangerous than a D 4 artifact or a Q 7.
Kreacher smiled with a softness Draco had hardly expected to see in the elf’s face. “Mr. Draco can rely on Kreacher. Kreacher is happy to see that Mr. Draco cares about Mr. Harry.”
“I mostly cook the Muggle way, but so far everyone who tasted it has liked my breakfasts. Do you want to give it a try or are you chicken?.” The ball was in Malfoy’s court.
After coming for the second time, this time by rutting against each other, Draco needed something to eat and drink, while Harry had dozed off. He saw a bathrobe hanging on a hook beside the door, put it on, and padded downstairs.
“Special occasions are the occasions when I stay at home and just listen to music, cuddle with Delilah, my cat, so I'll wear joggers and a sweater.” Draco said sheepishly.
“You better accio the owl treats. I’m not ready to wait for you to come back into my arms any longer than necessary.” Draco grumbled, wrapping the blanket back around himself.
“Draco, sorry, but could you hold my mirror, please. I can only do my shaving charms around you. Thank Merlin, they vanish the hair immediately, my uncle always used to leave the hair in the sink, and I had to clean it.”
“How did Malfoy, you know…?” Ron inserted.
The camera cut to the bedroom, where Draco just buttoned up his flowy white shirt. He was wearing a pair of jeans that hugged his arse just perfectly and Chelsea boots. Then, he sat down at his new dresser with a mischievous grin and applied eyeliner.
“Yep, that would be likely,” Harry replied.
“For what news? You know, I can help, if it’s a good idea.” That was Remus, who sat in the middle of Dean’s picture ‘Black lake in summer,’ the golden sun glistening in his hair and a knowing smirk on his face.
Dennis stood behind the counter, leaning over towards a customer in a blue dress with dark blond hair. “I wish we could…”
He Flooed to Diagon Alley and went to Dennis’ shop.
He couldn’t even pretend to do any brewing today so instead, he made an inventory of his ingredients, cleaned and sterilized all his empty jars, bought any ingredients that he was short on stock, more so than needed, as it exceeded his monthly ingredients  budget, but most of all, he had stared at imaginary points in his lab over the last week wondering if all he was doing was actually pointless. He rearranged all the ingredients of Pepperup Potion, the easiest potion he was selling. And the one that would run out first, then sat down, covered himself with a cozy warm blanket and finally laid down to have a break. His mind was spiraling.
Uther Weasley exchanged a look with Achilles and disappeared from the frame.
“You are talking like my mindhealer would.” Harry mumbled.
“What do you think of vegetable thali? That’s different dishes to try. We could order them for two, and you taste and take what you like, and I take the rest?” Harry suggested.
And today was probably going to be a whole lot of more trouble in the cafeteria. It was Valentine’s Day after all, and he had to watch all the displays of interdepartmental declarations of love, knowing very well that there were only three wix in this country and one abroad who cared about him. One of them was his mother, one was very lesbian, one was happily married to a Muggle, and the other one was very aro ace.
Talk to you soon.
Draco gave Morpheus an owl treat, but the bird stayed put. That was unusual for Luna’s owls. Draco furrowed his brows and read.
“And if, it’s not like it’s my business. Draco wants to get married. So what, if I fancy him, he’s not mine. And for all I know, he’s straight. At least, I’ve never seen him with a bloke.” Harry twisted the lowest button of his button-up shirt. What were Narcissa and Pansy playing at? Wasn’t it hard enough to get over his feelings for Draco while breaking curses together day after day? Did he have to discuss his feelings as if they meant something?
“You can’t just come here and make demands. Who do you think you are?” She sneered.
“Take more Legos, at least one for every student who passed their exam due to your help.” Karamo placed a handful of Legos into Draco’s hand. He took twelve blue bricks and put them onto the pan. Then he picked a red brick.
“It’s run by your former housemate from your year, Mick Bulstrode.”
“Nobody ever fancied me back. Once they realised I’m not the great hero but a normal man and vulnerable at that, they hated me. You never believed I could be the great hero. Why would you love me then?” Harry’s hair may always look like a bird’s nest, but even after the Battle of Hogwarts it hadn’t looked as ruffled as at this moment. Harry’s eyes were wet and looked much bigger.
Yes, Draco had always had effeminate tendencies, not taking his ballet lessons reluctantly to have a good balance for dueling, but enjoying them and crying when his two years that belonged to a proper Pureblood education were over.
As Draco Flooed home, he heard a few shouts about careless drivers and lyrics of pop and rock songs. It seemed like the man was listening to the car stereo while driving home. This suggested that the man might be a Muggleborn and could not live too far from London. People who avoided Apparating and Flooing were usually Muggleborns.
He asked the shop assistant if they had any clothes designed by Akasha Gupta. Draco loved Akasha Gupta robes, but they weren’t suitable for his pale skin, while they just seemed to be made for Potter. Akasha Gupta combined modern British robe cuts with the rich colours and fabrics of Indian clothes.
“The owner of that other cat must become a friend of yours, Uncle Harry. It seems Meowfoy wants to marry the other cat.” Mary said sagely.
“Good morning,” he greeted, taking in the ambience of the room and the person’s looks. He had a vague idea of having seen them before, at Hogwarts, and he could see the resemblance of the face in his mind with the image of a Slytherin tie.
“Maybe I could take one Lego for tutoring my friend Greg and some younger Slytherin students during my school days?” Draco’s voice sounded shaky again.
“Bloody hell, I owe Ginny twenty Galleons. She said you both would hit it off within the first 48 hours, while I said it would take you a week or two.” Weasley chuckled. “Don’t look that shocked. We’re Harry’s family. If you’re what he wants, while you may have been a prat in school,you might still be a prat, I also know that the Ministry elves trust you. They told Hermione that you have become a good man. But for some reason, they think Teddy lives with Harry. The truth is Teddy visits Harry every other weekend.”
“But perfect Potter can’t love a Death Eater.” He whispered in a low voice as he scratched violently at his Dark Mark. A droplet of blood bled through  his white button-up shirt sleeve. “Merlin’s balls!”
Lucius Malfoy, everyone has been better off since we’ve been free from you. Don’t you dare try to interfere with our lives! Draco glared at their father.
“Oi, I was reading that!” Greg yelled from the break room.
“You were underage and forced to take that mark. And the good things you did voluntarily ever since the day you told Bellatrix you can’t be sure it was me, override the mark you were forced to take. I can very well remember the day you made it look like a fight but actually pushed your wand into my hand. You took great efforts and risks to do the good things you did. And I know who you are today, you make sure lycanthropy patients get affordable Wolfsbane potion, you donated half your fortune to the cause for house-elves, and you think I don’t know the anonymous author of ‘Facts on Selwyn’s curse that may be helpful for healing it’ is you? You saved the life and health of hundreds of Muggleborns by enabling Hermione to develop a remedy. Malfoy please, I’d feel honoured if you stayed at Grimmauld place for the time of the decontamination”
He felt Harry’s hand open his fly.
“You look like shit, Draco. Maybe you should come over now and tell me what happened.”
“Malfoy, I’m glad you’re coming to. You literally got out at the last second. If Harry hadn’t come to fetch you, you would have been dead by now. Why did you even stay at the Manor as contaminated as it is?” Granger sounded so much like Pansy when she gave someone a stern talk.
Today, I had the weirdest day in my life so far (and that includes the day Hagrid informed me that magic is real and I’m a wizard, as well as the day someone who wanted to get me into trouble signed me up for a competition I wasn’t really supposed to take part in), but I think it was weird in a good way.
“It’s only with the Tapestry ceremony in the morning of the wedding day that the Armiger ring will be released from Lucius’ power. His Aunt Renee and his cousin Leopold have to participate in order to release the ring, as Lucius can’t be trusted to leave Azkaban for Draco’s wedding, let alone giving him a wand. And Narcissa also doesn’t trust them enough to inform them. She says it’s not sure who they would side with.”
Flaccidus can’t work indefinitely. If you need to resort to it constantly, we recommend you ask yourself whether you can’t indulge safely instead. The spell fails after frequent use for your own good. We suggest a little extra activity during your daily ablutions, if you can’t obtain your love interests’s favour.
Anxiety curled at the pit of his stomach as Harry stepped through the Floo, and asked Dempy to lead him to the lab. He was momentarily shocked at the state Malfoy Manor was in, despite the clean polished walls and light ornamental furniture. The walls exuded the stench of dark magic, like a staleness that was imprinted in the fabric of the home, that it wouldn’t leave no matter how much one opened the windows and sprayed fungicide on the mold stains.
Sometimes Quipsy came over and asked him what to clean or repair, otherwise, he spent his waking times in solitude. Most of all, he pondered the weirdness of things. The weirdest thing of all was not what was different, but what wasn’t. Potter still had the same effect on him.
After dinner, they walked slowly through Islington.
“No, it’s Rita Skeeter. She doesn’t get her stories published as easily as before, now that people want real information since the Prophet group’s de facto monopoly is broken.” Hearing Ron say this, Draco was no longer surprised that Ron would sometimes speak at the Auror press conferences. He radiated professionalism. “People can find news in the Quibbler or get accurate information on WWN. She thought if she could uncover a story about your love life she would be back on top.”
“Feel free to check your message, it might be important.” Conrad gave him a smile.
“But you... never spoke up against the things my father and the other portraits said.” Lucius said, and sat down on the floor, as his strength left him. He desperately dug in his pockets for his vial of emergency Pepperup.
“If you think that a show with perfectly-timed hilarious stand-up comedy and singing songs of which some require a vocal range only few singers achieve, if you think it’s easy to sing the one they are singing now” Achilles paused for a moment, just as Draco sang
“Yay! He’s doing what he likes to do!” Tan said and high-fived Jonathan. They watched Draco stroke over the pale oakwood of his new dresser and then turn and touch the king-sized bed with the blue and sage coloured duvets.

“I never thought you would need to ask.” Luna’s face in the Floo had an expression Draco had never seen. It took him a while to conclude that it was her flabbergasted look. “I was sure you were familiar with Catford Cat and Kneazle cattery?”
He nodded.
But this dream was different, he felt Harry’s even, calm breath, his long, messy hair tickled Draco’s neck, and Draco inhaled Harry’s amortentia-like scent with every breath. And – that was the weirdest thing – Harry’s pert arse was pressed up against Draco’s erect cock.
“Yeah, my cat doesn’t like the Floo.” He remembered who the person was. “Bulstrode? Millicent Bulstrode?”
“What do you do to help them?” Draco was intrigued.
“What do you mean?” Harry inquired.
“Y-yes, I did.” Bree looked at the floor and fidgeted.
“Yeah, no curses on our rings.” Harry called out and hugged first the headmistress, then pulled Draco into a long and tender kiss.
Harry took his hand and slid the Potter ring on his finger. It was a rather simple platinum band, precious but not ostentatious. And while its physical weight was just as it was appropriate for a platinum band, its magical weight was far lighter than what he had been used to for all his life. The ring was only imbued with protective charms, not with all the load of pressure and curse residue any ring from Draco’s family had been heavy with.
“He needs a beautiful name,” Marlene demanded. “If he were a woman, I would say something like Amalthea or Celeste.”
“You will feel better in a few minutes, and nothing speaks against you returning in for the finale if you stay sitting here until I give you the okay.
A pause, wait for a laugh and then continue, Draco said to themself before continuing.  “And then there’s the Merton Graves’ method. Melody Webster with her Canadian accent was the last of his series of beauties expiring at thirty-five.  I’m not sure that his best before date approach would work well for me. My partner is always complaining about my inability to use stasis charms. Fairly certain if I had to use one on him he’d rapidly resemble the banana I forgot about three weeks ago. Unappetisingly soft.”  Draco raised their eyebrows suggestively, and waited for just a second as the audience tittered.  They had to get the timing just right for the next part otherwise it wouldn’t work.
“Why, pray, do you not want us to get drunk on our wedding day like most pureblood couples? Is that a Muggle tradition?” Draco was torn between petulance and curiosity.
“Come. Show me what you have for me, Morpheus.” The owl gave him a sceptical look, and he remembered that Luna always called him Marv. But then, Morpheus glided over to the water tap and stretched out his foot for Draco to take the message.
“And Hagrid, but you apologized to both when you were no longer under your father’s thumb. And the kind of Slytherin you are today I wouldn't mind sharing a House with.” Harry tried to form a block against the drain, using his own and an accessible part of Malfoy’s magic, he didn’t even know how he was able to do that.
It was Granger. As usual these days, she was wearing her hair in protective bob braids.
“And you don’t have to worry if you are worthy of me. You always are. I love you.” Harry whispered in Draco’s ear, then kissed him hungrily.
“Send Angelina my greetings, chaotic neutral.”
Emily leaned over and said, “Maybe it would be better for you if you went there with someone capable of making sarcastic remarks about Finch-Fletchley.”
An earsplitting meow later, Malfoy looked up into Harry’s eyes and mumbled “Okay.” He turned, scooped up Paw into his arms and stepped through.
“Why would you meditate in a cupboard? It’s not a room.” Draco asked. If Harry hadn’t looked so scared, Draco would have assumed that he was having him on.
“Cousin Sirius,” Draco said tentatively.
Or the man was a crime scene specialist. After some problems, Potter, for example, had changed from Auror to crime scene specialist. Maybe not the best choice for his mental health, Draco supposed. After all, Potter still had to spend his working days looking at crimes. Maybe the man was a colleague of Potter’s, although, an Auror would surely be more likely to be targeted by a potion attack.
“Good morning, mirror. Can you help me look good?” Draco addressed the mirror on the wardrobe.
“We should send her a box of chocolates when we tell the public that we’re a couple,” Harry said and kissed Draco’s cheek.
But I have at least a four-legged companion for you who needs a new home. A beautiful black cat with green eyes and white paws. He belonged to Theophanu Macmillan before, so he knows not to disturb a potions master. After her sudden demise from wearing a cursed necklace, her cousin Ernie tried to take the cat, but Ernie’s dog and the cat didn’t get along. You would do Ernie and me a great favour, and it could help you a lot, too.
And now, after just six months, they were getting married and had invited him. He hadn’t really wanted to attend, but Molly had begged him to reconcile with Percy; she couldn’t hold all family events twice for the rest of her life because two of her kids wouldn’t talk to each other. And Harry had been so grateful to be called one of Molly’s kids so matter-of-factly that he hadn’t dared refuse. He had just told Molly that he wasn’t doing it for Percy but for her, Arthur, Ron, Ginny, George, Charlie and Bill.
“Merlin’s balls! Sorry. I just had hoped to be able to help you get back home more easily. Can I offer you a carrot or two, and ask you to wait for me to finish my work?” Draco hoped the  gnome would accept his offer.
He chewed resignedly and then answered her. “No, Dawlish is leaving me alone since the elves insisted that I’m essential for their loyalty at their last talks with the Beings Division. Smith must have been close to tearing off his own hair that day, as Ninty told me. I don’t know if I deserve the elves’ loyalty, but I’m grateful for it.”
“I’m not sure he knew those charms himself. He was disowned and burnt out of the family tree at sixteen, and only got the house because his brother Regulus was already dead.”Potter sighed and led Draco into a not very refined but passable kitchen. “The Weasleys wanted to teach me their house charms, but we found out that the houses were built on different runic principles.” Draco sat down at the table. Potter made tea, his posture one of someone who had too many losses to mourn. Draco wished he could help him somehow.
Draco took a few deep breaths. It didn’t help, but he had to say it. He stared into his teacup to avoid eye contact. “In the night, you had a – you had a wank. I heard your fantasy about Quidditch and silver eyes, and I felt on my body how you touched yourself. I’m – I’m sorry. I didn’t know yet, that it was you. I only found out in the morning, when you read the Daily Prophet.”
“No, the next millennium! Of course now.”
“Comes with being raised in a barn, or in my case in a cupboard under the stairs,” Harry deadpanned.
“It’s – it’s comfortable! How can dressrobes be comfortable?” Potter mumbled to himself as he peered into the mirror.
“Sorry to burst your bubble, but this wasn’t
“I don’t know if they talked, but George said there was quite a telltale smell on the bouncy castle they had been on. Cleaning charms don’t work so well with that Muggle plastic. He couldn’t see anything there, but the castle was smelling of sex.” Luna grinned at Mick and took a bite of her dirigible plum pie.
“Professor. While it’s true that this isn’t a marriage we want, Draco must marry a Greengrass. And I can only not marry him if he marries someone else.” Astoria replied, while Draco’s glamour fell and tears ran down his face.
“That gallus bastard did what?” That voice and that Scottish brogue was doubtlessly Headmistress McGonagall, but she normally didn’t shout like that or use such pedestrian language.
Harry leaned in and kissed him, softly, as if he were afraid a wrong move would wake him up and reveal that all this was just a dream.
If Pawter and Meowfoy could speak human languages, they would reveal things to you, dear reader. Of pops of elvish Apparition in the night, portraits asking for help to manage some mischief to help a pair of very oblivious wizards get their shit together and of bare human feet walking down a corridor they weren’t supposed to be in. All with good, albeit meddling intention. They would tell you of human eyes exchanging exasperated looks at their friends’ avoidance of physical contact even though a decent cat’s nose can smell how much both men crave that touch.
but did you listen?" Catherine waved a silent spell over her drenched clothes.
"Then stay, and wait. I'll get the rest of the papers from your study, and bring it here to keep you company as you keep Draco company."
"Didn't you see?" Draco whirled around as the dust settled, "that was Miss Millicent!"
"What is so urgent about this," Lucius Malfoy settled in his chair, "that you had to return from unpacking your bag? I thought you've requested early leave just to greet your friends ahead of others?"
"I can!" Draco disagreed, "but I need to ask you something."
"Get me my case. No, the black one, Winky."
"Is that a revolver?" Draco questioned incredulously.
"No, I'm sorry for talking like that. I have been stressed about Sirius Black's appearance, too."
"I'm sorry, Draco."
"As for my dad." Draco started as he slid a fresh shirt on.
"Why yes. I do. He passes this store everyday on his way to work, and he's a man who takes the security of Hogsmeade very seriously. My store's the closes to Knockturn, so he makes sure to give a glance."
Pansy Parkinson eyed them firmly with crossed arms. An unspoken exchange lasted between them, until Pansy rolled her eyes and uncrossed her arms, only to hike up her skirt.
"What in the realm of nine hells was your excuse to make them all assign detention!" Susan screamed before the first syllable left Weasley-boy, latching onto Blaise's shoulders.
Narcissa stopped drinking her tea. She instead turned back the pastries the waiter was about to serve to package, as their order had been placed not a minute ago.
"Malfoy manor stands on a point of dissent. Hogwarts' grounds are protected by points of headstones. Durmstrang is protected by a congregation of weather. But they're all intertwined, to cover the society and people which lie between. Each and every sentient building of a magical society has a part to play in the concealment, which used to involve your house, until it was corrupted entirely by intent. You could say, in fact, that your house would be the easiest to enter even with wards in place by your own hands, by wizards and muggles alike. Weasleys have long lost the qualifications of pure-blood rituals."
"Oh."
Joheim pointed at a wide area between two buildings.
"Albus Dumbledore? Ha. How many would praise him for being Headmaster, I wonder? How many would recall him fondly as a figurehead of Hogwarts rather than a strategist and mentor? Nein, nein, everywhere I walk I am greeted with smiling faces, fond faces. Dumbledore walks down streets with fear and awe in every greeting received. I am known for my own purpose. A good, respectful purpose."
"If I disagree?"
Hogwarts was an ancient castle. Its magic, sweeping and vast, had grown into a signature of its own, and would have bestowed hereditary magic on the owner of said castle, but there was none. Hereditary magic was, after all, the pure, unfiltered magic most wizards and witches were incapable of processing in full through their cores and out their body, despite the thick saturation which rested over the Wizarding World, which decreased with every torn seam for the muggles to pass through.
Draco nodded to both of her statements.
Catherine's cheeks turned lightly red, and her blue eyes which remained sparkling even between the grey skies and the shadows of the clouds gleamed brighter. It was quite astounding how her beauty was flawless when she claimed to have done nothing to her skin. She clenched a fist against her green summer dress and glared.
As they picked apart his memory one by one, he found that he couldn't hold his breakfast, and even after they enlisted the help of Pot with the towels clinging to his talons, they went through another round of emptying the tea in his stomach before Draco could settle.
"Yes, well. I told you to set
"Oh, my."
"Narcissa Black, Catherine, is occupied weaving a very productive blanket for her dear son."
Vivian stood, and Chartres stood almost immediately because her hand was moving.
"We're talking about how Draco's a suspect of Sirius Black's appearance in Hogwarts, Marcus." Yurika supplied.
"From what I've been told, you're implying Draco had been in Durmstrang since he was five. Wasn't that too young an age for you, Draco?"
"Marcus," he elongated his name, "you're giving me a horrible headache of deja-vu."
"His eyes and ears?"
"The Black's House?" Tea asked in surprise, "whatever for?"
"We need at least one professor for cooperation."
Tolerating what could be the first time Blaise pressed a matter on him, he hadn't complained.
, walked towards the right dragging his fingers along the walls and stained windows. They didn't question why he was a man, as he clutched his side while limping. Draco recalled the moment he landed a
"He flew without a broom in his dream, Catherine. Now settle, please, this is not your preparatory school. Draco, this certain memory is probably the last interaction I had with the conductor of France's Northern train stations on the day of Grindelwald's death. There will be dead bodies, and something you'd probably find interesting to see. Do remember, the memory will
"Draco," Hermione began.
"I didn't consider-"
"I've a spell I want to try."
Draco wrote 'charms, resistance, magic attachments on intent'.
Without further output, Catherine sighed.
The men behind him suddenly cheered. "Taysa! Take him up on'it!"
"Have you any French dishes?"
me. Do you understand?"
Vivian paused.
"I'm moving. You were right, by the way. Animagus. But don't blame my deliberation, I'm still reserving any judgements."
Blaise shot Draco a stifled glare.
"Ron. Lost. His. Rat." Susan parroted, but it sounded more ominous than the fact she'd been repeating other people's words for the past minute.
Cornelius Fudge looked closely at the pale boy, with hair nearing white than blond, and eyes of stormy grey. When he realised the boy was Lucius Malfoy's child, he wavered, and ultimately ceased to a comforting voice.
"Blaise tore through the silencing charms I casted on the curtains. And they were meant to be permanent."
"You expect me to be a scarecrow to your heir." Chartres drew his teeth forward.
"None."
Vivian had once mused about the identity crisis which approached mid-life, when there was success as of current and failure in the future. She had similarly warned Draco of the matter, as young as he was, in terms that he could understand. Jason had looked on with half a sigh lingering in his voice, as she hoped for the best with all the maturity she had given him.
"Monsieur Chartres came over on the 1st of June. He died after meeting Bartemius Crouch on the 2nd. Millicent Bagnold was found dead on the 3rd."
"Yes, Draco."
"-your poor mother-"
"These are request forms. For England, and Wales, and a few rifts between France and Scotland. Including Diagon Alley, Knockturn Alley, Indigopal Street, and blocks five to eight on Burton Alley."
"This really isn't the time," Draco muttered as a twinge flashed across his magic. He straightened, facing North. "The Willow."
Aunt Vivian made an amused hum.
They remained in silence for a while, before Draco opened his eyes.
"The Pavilion. It sounds like an entirely different function from the school's representatives?"
It was the cork of a butter-beer bottle, not the beer itself. But as he observed the swinging thing, he came to the realisation that he had never tasted one before, nonetheless heard of one, so he proceeded to ask of its flavours only to be replied with: "It's soft, and softer, but not as soft."
"Jealousy," Vivian clucked her tongue, "the demise of beauty."
"Sirius Black, who murdered innocent muggles and a wizard, escaped Azkaban. We're looking for him the best we can. A reward to those who catch him, dead or alive." Pansy had only given a frank conclusion, and Draco wondered if he should call the night, a night, so that they'd be able to function the next morning.
"It's nice to meet you again, Potter. Please, introduce yourself to the group. Friends of friends are welcome, here, and there's positively nothing we know of you, I'm afraid, as rumours aren't to be trusted. Have you brought a friend too, perhaps?"
"Your mother," Aunt Vivian begins, "is of the firm opinion that helping the downfall of Karkaroff and the expansion of her garden is one thing, and that your frequent presence on these grounds is another. It is not your concern, although it should be, as I would rather have you focus on your studies."
"There was never an otherwise for the Blacks and neither for those who became in-laws to such a prestigious line. I may be a descendent of Flamel, but as tied in blood to the Fawleys, and by extension the Blacks, it was either we extended our riches or destroyed it all like the Gaunts." Vivian moved her gaze towards the expressionless woman. "There will always be the if, the hesitance, so allow me to reassure you by this impression."
"Your observation surprises me very often." Aunt Vivian said, "you would be reading into the days where I am deprived of a human's frivolities next."
"May Hogwarts grieve for its occupants' blindness." Draco whispered to the Slytherins.
There was a rustle of papers, and Erlnier settled.
Draco shoved the letter back into her hands, and flipped his.
The woman snorted.
"This isn't something Headmaster Dumbledore can decide to give without rhyme or reason," she was biting out like a woodpecker, "look at the Ravenclaws. Aside from us Gryffindors, who's celebrating? Can't everyone see the entire school doesn't agree with such blatant-."
"Then, Matthew. Why didn't you be headmaster yourself?"
In a room of black mahogany shelves reaching across the walls and towards the glass ceiling above, Vivian and Jason shared a white leather fainting couch. The room itself could have been mistaken for an antique shop, if Vivian had been further careless about the decorations when she had first come across it as it had only suffered marginal changes with her reluctance. Feet propped upon Jason and her head resting against the miniature fort of pillows she observed her brother's intense concentration towards the book in his hands and found it fitting to disturb him.
"Luna," he started, bracing for a fight, "Bertha Jorkin's in Albania."
"Of course, Draco. Glad to be one."
"Weren't you two fighting?" Draco asked in return.
She watched his lost gaze and fluttering hands, and grabbed them before it knocked the nearest glass to the floor.
"How rare of you to admit you've gained no pleasure by the use of foolish men," Narcissa commented, "or perhaps you would both prefer to abstain from sex itself."
I have like, a references page + author's notes which has all the inspiration and omitted parts on which I haven't published. I was going to add it anyways since there's a detailed layout of Durmstrang, but the problem is: now or later?
It has the chart, if you want to see, from June 1-3 of their discoveries.
"It's midnight," Blaise questioned, "can't we push the plan back? There's enough time for the end-of-year celebrations."
Jason looked up from the book, "he also used another channel to visit, as there weren't any records of portkeys under his name, unless made illegally. Are you following?"
"So, all you need to do is catch the snitch."
With an hour and quarter to spare, he called for help in a secluded corner of Knockturn Alley.
"And tell him, no matter how warm Chartres may act before him, if such a conversation happens once more I will personally see him removed."
"I did mention you could involve others and make shares. I have ten or more questions." Draco smiled innocently, "besides, what credibility is there to speak of in any society?"
"Do you remember the time that eighth year got stuck between the dimensions on the third corridor?" He said, ignoring Hermione's gaping mouth, "Aunt Vivian had to fold the entire school's dimensions together, and reattach his legs before pulling him out. That was hilarious."
The tall, brown-haired man smiled at the bartender, curling his fingers around his glasses and lowering it to clean. The handkerchief was silk.
"He is Dumbledore. Rather predictable a strategist, unpredictable a human. Unicorn blood. Reported robbery of Gringotts. Dumbledore and Nicholas' letters. We had predicted this long past today, but it was set into motion this evening. With the arrival of Harry Potter, of course, which we would see reported on his house the following Monday."
Vivian tilted her head.
No-one bothered him in the Stamp-Room. To them, the papers which strung from ceiling to floor was a sorry sight, and the machine which whirled the papers into rolls were too loud. Somehow, there was always a fault to find within the room, for most save him and Agatha, who were tasked to switch in blank paper rolls when necessary. And to his due, he did his job of sorting records into place very well by giving more effort and precision than anyone, but only well with enough sleep.
Then he seemed to realise what, exactly, Draco was intending.
"There goes our Russian spies. Any replacements?"
His fingers ran over the folds of his robes. Despite the howl, despite the stillness of the air, his head raced against the sensations because, of many there was one thing he couldn't comprehend, the reason behind the dementors themselves. Perhaps he was slow on the uptake as several students looked as expectant as they were.
Sirius Black was now before him, old, battered, tainted, but with the unmistakeable haughtiness to his eyes which could only be gained by better households.
"The pork pie's on me."
Then, Harry had bumped right into him at the Great Hall one bright, summer morning, just as the leaves were turning yellow.
"So, you know a lot of people? Like the aurors?"
"The notes indicate they were mentor and student," Luna said as she leaned back on a chair, flipping through the notebook, "They apparently knew each other from work, when Monsieur Chartres first entered diplomatic service of auror cooperations for the centurial seminar of the International Confederation of Wizards, and remained his mentor through several letters. Besides, Monsieur Chartres wasn't planning to stay in England, he only remained another day because Bartemius Crouch requested a meeting."
"Before we charge up there, tell us why we're going after Sirius Black."
"Bartemius Crouch," Luna repeated, "how?"
It was only when they walked down the last of the corridor, that Draco snarled.
"Have you checked how the pile of bones is doing in Albania?"
In the middle of leafing through a book, Blaise looked up.
"We have six more years to place everyone in their positions before it begins. Not nearly enough time, but we should be able to narrow down his current trajectory."
Bursting out of the crowds by the furthest stand south, he snarled at the fair distance of muddied grass. Reluctantly, he ran.
"Fuck," Draco whispered to himself, "what has the British Ministry come to?"
"I told her Monsieur Chartres is dead!"
"Fucking son of a swine," he said, "putain, va te faire enculer."
The Slytherin's common room was blocked by grey walls on all sides. Had he not seen a poorer demonstration of a dungeon in his own mansion, he would have considered the rooms to be the holding cells of prisoners. From what he was told, previous generations of Slytherins improved their rooms with their own budget, from furniture to decorations, including the Glub-lights above and silver rug below.
Catherine dragged her hand across her eyes, and moaned.
"May I?"
"Susan Bones." Cedric suddenly announced.
Now that a majority had gone Draco could see a heavy, round person sitting on a stool in the forefront, as Viktor Krum whispered worriedly into Nartus' ear. Considering Nartus' threat with his position at stake, Viktor did have a reason to protest rather violently. Draco ignored Nartus' pitiful whines.
Sometimes, Durmstrang's neutrality on the Treriksröset caused more problems than it should.
It gave many people trouble, but not now, or nowadays. It only closed when he 'slept'.
"We couldn't go by generation. Four died during the first separation, one during the conflict in an assassination, a few of illnesses, most stepped down, five during Grindelwald's era, and one stepped down before Jason, and Jason stepped down for me."
Draco pouted.
"It is with the reputation that people are judged and not their true value. I have defaced my family's name once, I will not do it again."
"A pensieve alter, an arrangement of port-keys under the guise of collectable trinkets, this room could as well be a reason for enticement than being an enticement."
The guy huffed, and walked off. Luna slid out of her seat, walked out of sight, and tailed him to the kitchen.
The room wasn't sound-proof, and he didn't bother casting a silencing spell either. He was a cautious man, Zaxter Zimman, and tended not to use magic in the building. The rows of archives, of records of wands and policies to its writers was often filled by the mindless chatter of workers bored out of their minds. And they were all in their 70's, or 80's, one was a 109, which meant their deaf ears and louder voices made it loud. Louder than one would expect.
She was considering her husband's manner which had remained constant despite her active part in pushing him into his house arrest. There was not a single change from what had been before, to what had been now, as it was the same politeness she had first witnessed and the same love she had seen directed towards her. It spoke volumes of her husband, and herself, she found his loss of memories and return to 'normal' life without such proof rather disheartening.
His colleague, Agatha, bursted out into laughter.
"The moon."
"What?"
"Yes." Fred replied.
Draco crossed his arms and legs, and leaned back incredulously. An impulsive Blaise, Draco noted, resulted in an affectionate Mrs. Zabini. He could read the worry vibrating off her usually stoic, in which symbolised sexual, features.
Aunt Vivian had held the broom, ran her eyes over the bristles, and returned it with a nod. It didn't escape his musing that she could have ran diagnostic charms in the split second she had done so.
The man tilted his glasses as he placed it back on his nose to the exact degree and smiled.
The air was humid.
Before the wide, grey courtroom, she sat on the highest throne, as all others watched on in a peacefully hateful silence.
Erlnier's gnawed on his cheek. His wife?
"Hand me a wand."
So Millicent left the courtroom with more than negative emotions towards Vivian, who was attempting to take partially minor custody of a child who had well accomplished parents, both from traditional families, with only Lucius Malfoy's past affiliation being the pin on their coattails. Millicent Bagnold properly, rather purposefully, exclaimed her job well-done but unnecessary when Vivian followed her out.
"No. It's only a proposal, of equivalent confirmations."
"Damn it!" Blaise kicked the nearest chair. "Fuck, fuck, Luna, I'm so sorry."
Her face lit up. “Thanks for asking, I had never dared to hope I would have a chance with Hermione, and it was a nice surprise that Ron is the first cis man I have ever been in bed with who knows how to make a woman feel good. We decided to repeat the experience. But back to your problem.”
“Millicent? You really saw her? How is she?” Pansy picked the only part that interested her out of Draco’s ranting.
In fact, Harry had been more than nervous tonight.  He had felt like he had been running off pure anxiety and adrenaline.  Not that he'd admitted that to Draco.
Mx (pronounced Misc): a nonbinary equivalent to Mr., Mrs., Ms.
Darling! This felt so good. Harry took Draco by the hand and led him into his room. As soon as they were up the stairs, Draco pulled Harry into an embrace.
“Although I wouldn’t be complaining too much if he were to turn into a disintegrating mess at my touch.” The audience laughed. The joke worked better than it by all rights should, but as Draco looked around, something felt off.  He ploughed on though.  He was a professional after all. “I’d rather consider my love to be like a fine wine. Somethin that..”
“He didn’t. Wait! I think something was off about it, like, he didn’t feel the way Nearly Headless Nick or Moaning Myrtle feel.” Harry couldn’t put his finger on it, but listening to his instincts had often helped him survive, so if his instinct told him Malfoy felt different, it might mean something.

“We have a special guest tonight. You know who you are. But this song is especially for you.” Draco smirked at their father, then sat down at the piano and started playing. The band chimed in, and Draco began to sing
“Drake’s not feeling well, today,” Pansy whimpered in a sympathetic tone. Her hand rubbed his shoulder as she took a small bite of peas. Her face scrunched up. “Ugh, the house elves could do much better than this,” she chirped. Blaise laughed, and Harry set down his fork.
“What did you dream about last night?” he asked. Malfoy glared at him.
“Harry Potter? Wait, what’s going on here?” The girl was stuttering and trying not to laugh at the sight. Harry could sense Malfoy’s panic in the air like radiation. He knew he had to think fast. Harry isn’t the brightest bulb, but he knew one thing Malfoy always did.
After flying lessons, Draco’s head was throbbing with pain after being shoved into a brick wall one too many times by a faulty broom and a large Gryffindor. For the last class of the day, immediately everyone spread out to finish off the day with study groups or naps in dorm rooms, but Draco just went straight down to his own room to take a shower and then straight back up to the music room, where his piano waited for him. Today was hard, despite all of his favorite classes, and they all failed him. Draco was suffering a small headache now, and a bruised hip that made him want to shriek in pain every time he stepped with his left foot. Draco silently opened the door to the music room, his elegant piano sitting in the corner, silent and waiting for someone to play its keys, but in the opposite corner was something not silent nor elegant. Harry Potter sat on the edge of his chair, sliding along on his violin, struggling to read the sheets sitting in front of him. Immediately, the music stopped, and Potter looked up towards where Draco was, and then held his breath.
Be well, my Draco,
Draco’s head swam a bit, but in a good way, when Jonathan asked him to show him his grooming products. He led the way to the bathroom, and Jonathan picked the products up one by one.
“Damn your chivalry, I wanted to have sex with you tonight.” Draco whisper-yelled.
Then, Weasley sat closer to Draco, and cast Legilimens. The uncomfortable feeling of someone prodding and poking around in his mind began. Draco was grateful that Weasley kept it limited to the events of February 14.
Harry beamed at them, then, as he saw Draco looking at the letter again, put an arm around them.
Harry was right in quoting his godfather that there was a Queen song for every situation.
“What does this have to do with Meow?” Harry ‘s voice rose by an octave.
“Outside this task force, nobody will know that it’s not you who’s going to work again on Monday. Could you give us some hair for that? If you're too vain, leg or chest hair will do.” When Draco had cut off a strand of his hair, Weasley opened the door. “Junior Aurors Shahin and O’Dell, come in, please.”
Draco thought of Severus. He had been strict as his name; now that no house rivalry blocked Draco’s view anymore, he had to admit to himself that Severus had never been fair to the Gryffindors and resented Potter just for looking like his father. Severus had been a bad teacher, except for his very favourite students, of which there were only two, Adrian Pucey and Draco himself. But he had taught Draco, his godson, about life outside the circles of the elites. After his release from house arrest, remembering Severus’ narrations went a long way to limit the damage from Draco’s parents’ lack of practical education.
“No?”
I always assumed my hair looked like my father’s, which would be true about its colour, but the structure is not straight like his.  It’s curly like my mother’s. It may sound like a matter of little importance to you, but it makes an immense difference. I can wear my hair in a style I’ve always liked but never dared even consider, assuming I would look like my father.
Draco banished Harry’s joggers to a chair in the corner. He was wearing a green speedo.
Antoni smiled, and said: “That’s rice paper. One can use it for summer rolls.”
“Git.”
Their father was sat in the audience.
He decided to go to Creevey’s Stationery on Diagon Alley. Dennis Creevey had, at sixteen, decided that he was sick and tired of using parchment and quills, and had convinced Headmistress McGonagall that for him, and for the other left-handed students it would be a great improvement to write with a biro on paper. What had started out as an improvement for legibility of left-handed students soon became the new standard of writing at Hogwarts. Dennis had the capital to open his shop on Diagon Alley when he was directly out of Hogwarts due to finding investors who were glad their kids found it easier now to make legible notes and score better at their exams. And Dennis had invented a charm, that made paper as weather-resisting as parchment.
“Which wouldn’t be there in the first place if you had informed me that you weren’t planning to sleep in my room.” Harry snapped. “I took advantage of the fact that Draco was sleeping and couldn’t voice his lack of consent to cuddling.” He purposefully left out Draco’s morning wood.
“Draco, you don’t look like you had a good night?” Sirius sounded utterly shocked at the thought that a man could not have a good night. Did portraits lose their understanding of reality?
“I just called the grapes I couldn’t reach sour because you rejected me in first year.” Draco felt his hand begin to tremble. “Looking back, you could not have befriended me, not with the things I said about Hagrid and Weasley.”
The hand moved into the pyjama bottoms. Draco felt skin on skin, yet he could still see his own hand lying motionlessly on the blanket in the wand light.
“I will.” Another ring wrapped itself around his wrist.
“That’s the spirit, mate.” Weasley smiled at Potter, but the smile didn’t reach his eyes. “Malfoy, we’ll have to keep your gnome here and question him some more, and Brightest Cat will visit you later, as it’s safest if you both leave for the Hippogriff’s Nest right now.”
“You both are free. Lily Potter was the daughter of Abigail Evans, née Greengrass, adopted by the Baker family.” Headmistress McGonagall slowly walked towards Astoria. “Abigail was the Squib daughter of your great-grandfather Ebenezer. And as Harry is a Greengrass by blood, Draco can marry him. I recommend though, that Draco and Harry use the Potter rings, if possible.”
“It sort of comes with my Animagus form. I’m a stag, like my father was.” Potter gave him a shy smile.
“You have changed since Hogwarts, and so have the Weasleys. And no matter if it’s you disrespecting them or they disrespecting you, I have zero tolerance for disrespect. The same rule is just as strict for them. Rule number five: We divide up the housework equally between all the people living here.”
“I don’t think my name is Obliviate. The female called me Cupid. I have no idea.” The gnome offered between noisily chewing on a piece of raw cauliflower.
“Was he a friend of yours?” Anthony inquired, while he took the tart out of the oven.
“Because I had insulted Weasley?” Malfoys voice sounded vulnerable.
“Fine, Storey told me to make sure I invite you and, if you have, your significant other to our next pub night on Friday at the G&S.” The G&S was a LGBTQ+ friendly pub in Little Compton Street, owned by the surprisingly successful business partners Marcus Flint and Seamus Finnegan, whose husbands’ professions were reflected in the interior; while most people would guess that Oliver’s sport accessories and Dean’s art would clash inside a pub, an anonymous interior architect managed to create a fusion that was comfortable and stylish. Yet rumour had it that Marcus and Seamus had to take an Unbreakable Vow not to reveal the genius’s identity to anyone. What everyone did know was that G&S stood for Godric and Salazar, and that it was considered the best LGBTQ+ pub in wizarding Britain.
Not for the first time Draco wished to have a timeturner, to be able to leave his family instead of doing all the evil things he had done as a teenager to please his father. His heartless, abusive father, who had always threatened to harm his mother in order to keep him obedient and threatened to harm him to keep her under his thumb.
“One day, when I came back from the nursing home, there was a parcel on the table, and I assumed that Quipsy had left it there, that it was from Mother. I opened it, and inside was a box. When I touched it, a notice-me-not was lifted, and the last thing I saw before dying was Rabastan’s face. When I came to as a ghost, he told me that the best thing to hurt Mother was killing me and letting her not even get a body to bury. He had put the cursed box there.” The despair made Malfoy’s voice sound more ghostly.
“It’s always been you for me too, Harry. I still love you. I love you so much it hurts,” Draco says, squeezing Harry’s chest.
“I, I came to return your jacket,” he says. He still wearing the jacket though and makes no moves to take it off.
So, when he reaches the landing, shock does not begin to cover the feeling of his heart pounding, his rib cage tightening or his hands shaking. Draco Malfoy is standing in his living room, looking around the room as though he’s never seen it before.
“You’re doing so good,” Harry murmurs against his skin. “So beautiful.” He speeds up his movements until Draco is withering against him.
“You don’t have to do that,” Harry says. He leaning on the counter, watching Draco scrub the cups.
“What are you doing here,” he asks, his voice is shaky.
“No,” Harry replied. He squeezed Draco’s left hand in his own before releasing it. He turned around and straddled Draco’s lap.
They lay down next to each other, a large space keeping them apart. Draco turns to his side away from Harry. He waits for Harry’s breathe to even out but it never happens. They just lay down, listening to the crickets chirping in the crisp spring night.
“Nothing we do is simple, Draco. Look at us. We have spoken in a year and here we are. Sleeping in the same bed, holding each other and avoiding our problems,” Harry says. Even though the words are harsh they spoken gently as though not to scare Draco.
Harry stops. He looks back at Draco who has begun eating the tiramisu which has just been served. He looks sensual as he slowly takes a bite and groans around his fork. “I need some air,” is all he says before walking around her and exiting the room. As soon as he’s in the hall he heads to the floos and makes his way home.
“I love you, Draco,” he says.
“Please have snow and mistletoe… ”
“I don’t know,” Draco says.
As they reach the bedroom Harry turns around and looks at him. “You want this, right? I’m not imagining this?”
“Harry, are you okay?” Draco asks, his voice panicked.
“I think that can be arranged,” Harry says, laughing and kissing Draco’s hair.
-------
Draco whimpered. He wanted this so badly, but he had to know. “Harry,” he sighed, placing his hand on Harry’s chest and holding him away. “How long?”
“Do you want to talk about it?” Draco asks.
Harry was there. He was laying in Draco's bed. His black curly hair was strawn out on the white pillow, his dark skin striking on the linens. He was wearing one of Draco's Christmas jumpers and tight black underwear. His feet were covered in fluffy socks with snowflakes on them. He had fallen asleep over the cover with a book in his hand. Draco noticed a piece of mistletoe hanging over his bed and smiled.
Harry tilts Draco’s head up from his chest and looks into his eyes. Before Draco knows it, Harry lips are pressed against his own. Harry’s lips are chapped and he has stubble on his chin but it doesn’t matter. His lips taste like mint and tea and they move against his own like they were sculpted specifically to fit Draco.
Once again, Draco broke the silence. “So... are you here for the holiday?” he asked, fearing the answer would be yes.
Draco had made a mistake leaving New York. It wasn’t leaving the city that was the mistake. No, as much as he loved it, he needed to go back home. His mistake was not waiting for Harry to come with him. He missed Harry something fierce. Everyday since July, Draco had spent a majority of the time “moping” around according to Pansy.
He takes center stage and scans the crowd. He knows what face he’s going to see but he can’t help himself. Sure enough, Draco Malfoy is sitting at the back left of the room looking bored. He’s drinking his wine while examining his fingernails, which Harry knows are freshly manicured. Harry takes a shaky breath and draws his eyes away from Draco but it's already too much. His heart is pounding in his chest and he feels light headed.
They sit there together is each other’s arms until Draco let’s out a loud yawn. “Can we actually sleep now?” he asks.
“It fit the mood, don't you think?”
“It's only Christmas eve,” Draco said.
“Nothing, Draco.” Harry rubs his temple with his finger. “Absolutely nothing.”
He begins unbuttoning his shirt. He hangs it up in the wardrobe then removes his trousers. He folds those up and places them neatly in the wardrobe as well. Then he picks up the clothes that Harry left him. He brings the shirt to his nose and sniffs. He could get high off of this scent. He could probably come on the smell alone. At this thought, his cock begins to stir but he knows he shouldn't. He quickly puts on the shirt and the sweats before making his way downstairs for some tea.
It’s crazy, to Draco, that Harry could still trust him. Even after a year, Harry still leaves him alone in his room. Draco’s heart swells at the thought.
Draco all but dropped the present back under the tree and ran to his room. He slowed down and, with his heart in his throat, gently twisted the handle of his door and pushed it open.
“Draco,” Harry grits out. He takes a step towards him.
“Where the love light gleams…”
Harry shakes his head and hands Draco the cup back. Draco places it on the nightstand.
Harry is already sitting in bed. He has a book out, A Wizadering Guide to Home Improvement Spells. Draco hesitates at the doorway and Harry puts the book down. “Come on,” he says, patting the space next to him. Draco notices that Harry is on the right. He remembered that Draco always preferred the left side of the bed. The thought makes Draco’s heart beat faster.
Harry had looked delectable tonight. He was wearing midnight blue robes, open to see his muggle suit. It was fitted perfectly to his body almost like a second skin. His tall frame had commanded power in the suit. Merlin, it was sexy.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Draco says. He balls his fists up inside the pockets of the jacket.
-------
The Christmas song was still playing when Draco decided to speak. “Do you seriously have this song on repeat?” he asked.
Harry leaned into him. He studied Draco’s face briefly before pressing his lips to Draco’s. Draco kissed him back softly, as though Harry would disappear if he pushed his luck too far. Harry held Draco’s face and pressed himself against Draco, missing everything about him. He began grinding his hips against Draco, wanting to feel him. He moved his lips from Draco’s mouth to his jaw then down to his neck.
“That’s my hope,” Harry says back.
“If you must know,” Draco groans, “You were fucking me. Nice and deep.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco says, not for the first time that night.
Harry laughed, having forgotten that he did in fact have I'll be home for Christmas on repeat.
Draco kissed him hard and brought his arms around Harry, squeezing him hard to his chest. “I’ve had a key with your name on it for months,” Draco said
“Christmas eve will find me…”
They sit in silence a little bit longer until Harry reaches over and turns the light off. “Let’s get some sleep,” he says. Draco nods and snuggles further into the covers.
“Harry,” Draco replied, kissing Harry once more before leaning back. Draco watched Harry fondly as he began stroking his hair. After what felt like hours, Harry opened his eyes.
A rush of guilt washes over Draco. He remembers the night a year ago. It was the night of the gala. He got scared, panicked and packed all his stuff while Harry slept and left without a single word.
He saw the star on top of the tree and knew the tears in his eyes were now falling freely. Then he spotted the presents underneath the tree, wrapped and perfect. He picked one up and found that it said “To my beloved Draco, From Harry”
“Happy Christmas, Draco,” Harry said more firmly.
Harry stops stroking his hair and rests his hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Why did you leave, Draco? You never told me why,” he says, sadness dripping down his voice.
Draco looks on for another moment before turning around and taking a handful of floo powder.
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” Harry cries out. There are tears streaming down his face as he watches Draco thrash around the floor in agony. “I’m sorry.”
Harry placed both photographs onto the fireplace mantel and began getting to work on the rest of the house. He unshrunk a Christmas tree in the corner of the room just to the left of the fireplace, placed a skirt underneath it, and then he took gold tinsel and wrapped it around the tree in an even layer going up. Next he strung fairy lights around the tree and started hanging red and green baubles. He grabbed specially made baubles from his bag. Each one was made for him by a different friend, a gift from Hermione his first Christmas in the States. Ron’s had the Chudley Cannons logo on it, Hermione's had a book, Luna’s had nargles, Nevile’s a variety of small plants and Ginny’s a snitch. He placed them evenly on the tree before grabbing his favorite one. This one was one Draco had made him. It was a golden color with green and red calligraphy on it. It read “D + H” in loopy cursive with a heart on the opposite side. Harry placed it in the center of the tree with the letters facing out. Finally, he picked up the star. It was a relic from Draco’s mother, Narcissa. Draco’s family had used it for decades. It was silver and elegant with a charm so that it would never scratch and the color would never fade. On the inside, where it was hollow to place on the tree, the Black family name was etched into the aging metal. Harry placed it on top and watched as the star began to sparkle, another charm placed on it. Content, Harry took a step back and took a deep breath. There was still much more to do before Draco returned.
“I’ll be home for Christmas...” the song played.
Draco's heart was pounding so fast he thought he might pass out. He tiptoed to the bed and leaned over, placing a kiss on Harry's temple. Then he kissed his cheek and Harry let out a small yawn. He cupped his jaw and moved his mouth to Harry's, slowly willing Harry to wake up from his slumber.
Draco nods, he has a bit of a sweet tooth. Harry looks pleased with himself and begins sipping his own tea. They drink in silence, and when their cups are empty, Draco takes them both and washed them in the sink.
Luna took a sip from her strawberry pumpkin lemonade.
He had refused to tear out peacock feathers, complaining that it would hurt them.  Had begged for a puppy or a kitten. And that was nothing compared to Draco’s inappropriate attitude towards that house-elf! The one Potter had freed. He had refused to let it iron its hands.
Yesterday, as I saw you stepping out on the stage, I wanted to yell at you, disinherit 	you, tell you that you are ruining the Malfoy name. But then I had a little conversation
“While I disagree with lots of things that our ancestors did, there are some things you should learn from them, especially if you choose to glorify ancestors for such stupid reasons as waging wars. Do you really think someone who hated Muggles would have befriended their kings and tried to marry their queens?” He gave Lucius an expectant look.
Just as he was shagging Draco and jumping over the edge, he heard a loud banging against the door and Justin and Percy swearing.
“Riddikkulus! Riddi…!” A coughing fit overtook Lucius.
Yes, Ginny was his ex, too, but they had broken up amicably, both insisting that the other was an amazing person, but that they were better off as just friends.
Draco stood in front of his mirror and cast a glamour on his eyes. The wedding guests didn’t have to see that he had cried half the night. It was enough that his mother knew.
“And you think I’ll be happy to live with Granger and the Weasel?” Draco snarled.
When people’s attention was on the waiters with the Prosecco bottles, he approached Draco and Harry. “You have a window of three minutes to Apparate home before their attention will be back on you,” he whispered, then winked. “The wards allow you to Disapparate from the stage. Have a good weekend in bed.”
Harry’s fingers ghosted across his hip, then moved to the middle and began stroking his cock. He moved back up to kiss Draco’s lips again, then cast a wandless Lubrico on both their cocks and they both got lost in the delicious friction.
“Nngh, yes. Please, more.” Draco gasped, as Harry trailed kisses down his abs, then dipped his tongue into Draco’s navel, making him gasp with arousal. Harry’s hand found its way under the waistband of his boxers, and Draco decided to wear lace knickers next time. He wanted to drive Harry as crazy as Harry drove him.
But he was the one who had to leave the kitchen and clean up, because the chef demanded it, and that was what he hated about his life.
“I can’t pass the duty to marry on except to another descendant of the Greengrass family. But what would happen if he were to choose someone else depends on what his father bound him to by the power of his ring.” Astoria sighed. “But if we wait for seven years, we can have affairs without being punished for it.”
Ghosts could even feel horny. But there was no relief for it. He was bound to this house, there was no way of escaping, let alone the fact that it was not likely that anywhere on earth there would be a club at which he could pull a ghost bloke.
Potter led the way into an office room and offered them seats. “So, what did you want to talk about?”
“May I ask you for your mother’s hand in marriage?” Dr. Conrad Howell, renowned healer and his mother’s boyfriend, had atypically donned very formal dress robes this afternoon and looked at Draco, as if the young man were the Wizengamot deciding about his future fate.
Harry pondered for a moment. “They should hold the wedding at Grimmauld Place. Tonks Cottage is narrow if five people are present. And only your mother, her husband-to-be, Andromeda, Teddy, the celebrant, you and I are seven people.” Harry didn’t like big occasions, but big occasions in narrow places were even harder to tolerate.
“Gin, Darling, I agree that we need to stage an intervention, but this evening is not the right time to plan it. Let’s watch Netflix and try to calm down and plan tomorrow over breakfast.”
The elf Apparated away, and after a minute, Malfoy knelt down on the hearth pillow. “Potter.” His voice sounded weary and resigned.
“Meowf- his name is Meow.” That was a near save. How could he tell a Slytherin his cat’s full name?
“I just got back into bed. You slept so deep and didn’t even hear the owls.” Harry gave them a tender look, then reached over to the bedside table. “Good news first or the letter from your father first? Don’t worry, I checked it for threats with all the detection methods Ron taught me.”
“Is that all?” Karamo asked, beckoning to the Lego box.

“You have exactly the smitten kitten look on your face that James had for Lily.” Remus’ voice sounded shaky, and when Harry looked at him, he spotted a happy tear in Remus’ eye.
“I won’t Obliviate someone if there’s another, less harmful way. And I think an Unbreakable Vow can serve the purpose very well, here.” She rubbed one of her braids between her fingers.
“What does your royal highness want? Darjeeling first flush? Assam? Earl Grey? Oolong? Pu Erh? Matcha? Chai latte?” Harry snarked. It felt good.
“Draco? Are you okay? You look as if you’d seen Cedric Diggory’s ghost.” Pansy put a hand on Draco’s arm.
“You should taste my Aloo Gobi or my Dhal.”
In reply, Sirius mumbled something that sounded a lot like “It’s about time you got laid, Prongslet. Can’t have you being prudish forever.”
“Thank you, she’s fine, going to remarry next year.” Malfoy’s face seemed to soften at the mention of his mother.
Harry stared at her in shock. Fifty percent was a rather low percentage. “And if we do it and don’t succeed?”
“Are you using Amortentia in the shampoo?”
Draco let the letter fall to the table. It hurt him almost physically how resigned Prongs sounded. Why could he not see how awesome he was and how much he deserved to sometimes let go and just let someone be there for him. If only he could be worthy of such an amazing man…
For a moment, it felt liberating to laugh at Voldemort splinching off his nose. But then Draco thought again about how wrong it was to get arousal from an unaware sleeping Harry and fell back into despair.
“Before I walked in here, all I heard was the beautiful sounds of a piano and a violin intertwining perfectly to create perfection. You did it before, I would love it if you two could do it again for the sake of showing the rest of the school these classes aren’t a waste of your time here at Hogwarts. Try it out, and if after a couple weeks you still don’t think it will work, I’ll adjust the pairs to accommodate you both.”
“What? How is that even relevant right now?” He sneered. It looked strange on Harry’s face.
“Well, Malfoy needs to get his hearing checked. And also his sanity,” Harry said, ruffling his hair and moving to get past Parkinson. “Besides, isn’t he missing his girlfriend right about now?” he remarked. Parkinson scoffed and brought a hand to her forehead.
Draco decided to try out that silent treatment thing as well. Professor Snape stalked up to the front of the classroom and began speaking distractedly. “I’ve got essays to grade, because some of you think it wise to turn them in at the last minute.” He glanced over to Seamus Finnigan. “I’ll have all of you make a simple Hiccoughing Potion today. Afterwards, you may work on anything else you have for other classes.” Everyone was silently surprised at the easy day, but nobody complained.
“It’s not that big of a deal. I don’t think anyone will show up, really. But the reason I was asking, well,” Harry stopped. His friend waited in anticipation for whatever he was going to say next, but not even Harry knew what that was.
“Malfoy, that’s exactly how you act towards me. You do it nearly every day. Now you know what it seems like to me. I think you are obsessed with me, or obsessed with finding a way to get me in trouble for picking my goddamn nose.” Malfoy just kept on scoffing and turning his nose up at Harry, but they both knew he was right. “Come on, admit it. Admit all you ever do is find some way to make me the bad guy, or make me the stupid one. Admit you spend most of your waking moments thinking up evil plots to get me expelled or lose house points, or something even more serious, like getting killed by Voldemort.”
“Do you think there’s an antidote? I mean since this is the kind of potion that is supposed to wear off, maybe nobody bothered to make one...” That made Malfoy shut his book and rub his temples.
“About ten minutes after switching bodies, you’ll feel the same headache recur. Then you’ll know you’re switching back. It’s important to remember as always to try not to recreate potions outside of this specific classroom, as these are very dangerous. You’re lucky you get to try the potions, let alone make them, so don’t mess it up for everybody else if you get caught,” Snape drawled. Perfectly on time, Harry began to feel a tense headache, and sat down waiting for him to return to his own body. After a few short seconds, his muscles relaxed and he was back to normal, as was Ron.
“Uh, Harry.. Leo isn’t going to get those lessons. Headmaster Dumbledore may allow a lot, but he wouldn’t just add classes on because some first-year wanted them.” Hermione and Harry shared a doubtful look, but decided Ron must be right. There was no way Dumbledore would do such a thing.
“We have to tell someone,” Harry said, which was apparently a bad idea because Malfoy gave him the craziest look ever. To which Harry remembered how weird it was that he was talking to...himself?
“We’re only three minutes away from class. Care to explain the situation to me again?” She crossed her arms over her chest and waited while Draco groaned.
“Unless you’re going to give me a makeover every morning,” Harry stated. Malfoy glared at him as he parted Harry’s...his...hair.
“Anyway, if Leo does end up getting music lessons at Hogwarts, Ron and I have to figure out what we want to play.” Ron looked up at Harry with a puzzled look.
“Leo Parks,” the boy smiled, and Harry waved before sprinting up the concrete stairs to class.
“What? Oh God, I’ve been screwing around in that class,” he muttered. “I don’t even know how to hold the violin properly! I’ll look like a fool. I’ll hex myself and say someone else did it so I don’t have to perform. No, too risky.” Ron ran his hands through his hair in distress while Harry laughed.
“Anyway, I’m sure you’re much better with the violin. Been practicing for ages, I assume.” Malfoy turned away and stood up, reaching for his bag. He was about to stalk out of the room, but turned back around to Harry, a bewildered look on his face.
‘So don’t sign it. Unless you want to learn how to play an instrument.’
“Er, are you alright?” Ron said. Harry sighed and nodded.
“Potter, wait,” Malfoy snapped when the door clicked open. “I played for you, now it’s your turn. Let’s see how talented you really are when you’re under pressure.” He sat up straight once more, turning his nose up like he does.
“Oh, Ron, you didn’t crush the lacewing flies, did you?” she peered over, stirring the potion. The face Ron gave implied the answer was no. Surely, Harry wouldn’t have to drink that... Who knows what could happen to him? “Here, just pour that out and take half of mine. We don’t really have time to start from scratch and Snape isn’t the best at realizing when Harry could be in danger rather than one of his Slytherins,” she muttered. Harry smiled and silently thanked her.
“What are you doing?” Draco said, giving Potter a shove. “Don’t you know how to walk?” Potter shushed him, and Draco decided on what hex to use on him before Potter spoke again.
Blaise Zabini sat down across from Draco, biting the tip of his quill and getting ink all over his tongue. “Are you trying to poison yourself?” Draco snarled. Blaise looked up, and realized what he was doing.
He ran straight into Draco. Or Draco ran straight into him. Or it was a mutual effort. Either way, things went stumbling. Draco was obviously not happy. He guffawed and then, clenching his jaw, sneered, “Watch where you’re going, Potter. Or I’ll gladly watch for you and make sure you never run into me again. You’re lucky I am letting you off the hook this time.” Harry didn’t say anything, trying not to let the situation escalate, although he himself was feeling his own anger escalate. His robes and part of his face felt wet, when he realized Draco’s potion had been spilled on him. At the same time he realized this, he heard Draco whine again.
“Pansy, care to escort me to class?” he said, shrugging the bag onto his shoulder.
“I can be where I like,” Potter muttered, stepping down another step and trying to slip past Draco. He made it down a step below him before Draco gripped Potter’s shoulder, forcing him to pay attention.
“I think we should give up on schoolwork and get some sleep,” said Harry. He hadn’t realized just how much he needed to climb into bed and forget everything else that was happening around him.
“Mo-what?” Draco questioned. “Well, anyway, your violin doesn’t squeak, you sound fine. Like I said, I need to practice, so as long as you can tune me out and I can tune you out, this’ll work just fine. And I’ve had plenty of practice tuning out annoying chosen one’s.” Then Draco turned away and pulled out his sheet music and flipped through pages while he heard Potter shuffling about behind him.
“I thought I was going to die. I’ll have that crazy man fired, just you see.” Potter shrugged Draco’s hand off and walked out of the hallway, looking both ways before motioning for Draco to follow.
“Eye of newt,” he stated, and a passage to the common room appeared before their eyes. Malfoy eyed him, and said, “we recently had to change it. Some Slytherin girl thought it would be a good idea to invite a Hufflepuff boy in, and she let slip the password. Had some unwanted guests...Anyway,” he led Harry upstairs to one of the bathrooms. “Just sit here and I’ll do it myself, no point in teaching you.”
“Well, what?”
But the two of them seemed to be at a stand-off. Neither of them wanted to play first, Draco’s pale fingers resting on the keys, and Potter’s hand waiting for the first pull of the bow across the strings. At that moment, Draco decided there was no moment like the present and pressed down on a key, just as a long, eerie sound came from behind him. Turns out Potter had the same thought. Draco scoffed and pressed the key again. Why didn’t it sound right? It was fine yesterday, when he played for Potter. Draco pressed harder, then once more.
how long has it been? anyway, here u go! <3
“You mean awful,” Potter butted in. Granger sighed, but didn’t argue.
‘That’s because you’re gay.’ Pansy held back a laugh.
“Fine by me,” Ron replied, and stacked all his papers together to shove in his book bag, bounding up the stairs before Harry had even finished gathering his supplies. Laid in bed, his comforter snuggled around him like a protective shield, Harry couldn’t stop thinking about the dread he felt having to practice music with Malfoy. He’d supposed it was going to be initially like it was in the music room, but more of Malfoy snickering and bickering at everything Harry did. Would Malfoy have even acted like this all these years if Harry hadn’t refused his handshake back when they were younger? He scoffed and shook his head. It was ridiculous the grudges the Malfoys could keep when they were dedicated. Harry was eleven years old, for God’s sake! He didn’t know anything, just knew that this random kid was being snarky to his new friend. Harry was frustrated that every small action he made was blown out of proportion. He chalked it down to being the “chosen one.” But nothing had even happened with Voldemort since first year! Surely people would give up on calling him a savior, and a hero to the Wizard World. He just wanted to be a normal boy.
“Anyway, they were even suggesting arranged marriages. But come on, nobody does that anymore. And marriage is awful, so restricting. I think if I had to marry anybody, it would be you.” Draco smirked at that; what an odd thought, being married to Pansy. “I mean, we’re both gay so we would obviously not feel obliged to fall in love, and clearly there’s an open relationship in the deal. That way, our parents would be satisfied. I am a pureblood Slytherin after all,” she said, flipping her hair. Draco stared at her with a surprised look.
“It looks like you’re having a heart attack every damn time you look at me in there!” he shouted. Realizing there could be other people in there, he began searching through the stalls. “Pansy is beginning to think you fancy me. Is it true, Potter?” he smirked. Potter was silent long enough that Draco began to think it was actually true.
Anyway, here's the second chapter to Truce :)
“I don’t know. I suppose I’ll practice flying or something. And if you really want to tackle styling my hair, you’re going to need some form of magic. It’s really not possible.” Malfoy rolled his eyes and began to leave the bathroom.
“What? How do I stress you out? I’m trying to find out how to fix this, just like you. And where did that even come from?”
“You wish, Malfoy. I’m just still surprised you can actually play the piano well instead of sounding like a kneazle scratching against a blackboard.” Potter seemed quite proud of that, so Draco let him have it.
“Sure, next I’ll tell my aunt and uncle how much I appreciate them for everything they’ve done for me. And then after that, I’ll plan a lunch with Voldemort,” said Harry. Malfoy had apparently had enough.
“You read my personal letters?!” Harry had to back away in fear of being punched by himself.
“Risky, how? If it’s wrong will I be in my body with your hair, and you in your body with my scar?” Harry asked. Malfoy bit his lip and looked down, shuffling his feet.
‘That’s true. Maybe he is as well.’ Draco looked sideways at her, she had a serious look on her face and shrugged her shoulders.
“We’re walking slowly,” she said before catching up to him. Draco took large steps and stuttered and paused as much as he could before he found them standing in front of the Potions classroom.
“Oh, are you talking about me, again?” Potter remarked, setting down his violin on a neighboring chair. “Yeah, I don’t really get that. Because as soon as I begin to play, I can only hear a horrible squeaking noise that sounds like I’m murdering a child, but everyone else seems to hear Mozart or something like that.” Potter straightened his glasses and looked uncomfortable.
“Well, I have a petition I’d like you to sign.” This got Harry’s attention. There were not many petitions at Hogwarts anymore, besides the one last trimester protesting the ban on the Weasley twins selling their homemade products. Of course he had signed that; those things had gotten him out of many homework assignments and a talk with Neville about how his wand seemed to not like him very much (which was ridiculous; any sensible witch or wizard knew that).
“Harry, if you’re going to spit something at me about being shit at the violin, I’ll grab your essay and tear it up.” Ron looked dead serious, until he laughed and punched Harry’s shoulder. “Really, what’s up?”
“That was wicked,” Ron said with a wide grin. Harry agreed with a smile of his own, and then went to gather his ingredients to put away. Everything this class was going perfectly, even Snape seemed to be in a good mood. Which is why Harry pretty much expected what came next.
“I didn’t know what was going to happen, Malfoy!” Harry immediately retaliated once his foe stopped mumbling. “I just want to be back in my own body again! I want to stop hanging out with rude Slytherins and sleeping in a cold dungeon and wearing Slytherin colors!”
“Did you have another nightmare, Draco?” Harry absolutely wanted to just get up and somehow get away from here. How was Malfoy here? And who asked that? His best guess was Blaise, and also his only guess. Harry’s drowsiness caused his brain to melt and become unable to brainstorm at all. So Harry kept quiet. “I’ll take that as a yes...Do you want to go hang out down in the common room for a bit?” Harry still didn’t reply, but jumped when a hand slapped his leg twice. “Come on, it’s okay,” and then he heard shuffling and someone pushing his back, encouraging him to get up.
“What did you say?” he said.
“Did you hear that?” he whispered. Draco thought Potter was finally going insane. It must be that scar, he thought, that finally made him lose it. Potter gripped Draco’s arm and tugged him down a narrow hallway he hadn’t noticed before. He was about to say something before Potter brought a finger to his lips. Then he heard it too. A long, scrawling meow that meant Filch and his scraggly cat was near. Draco held his breath; he was slightly terrified of the old man and questioned Dumbledore’s daft decision (say that five times fast) to hire him. Draco decided that just this once he would listen to Harry, but that it didn’t change anything between them. Potter shoved Draco down the hallway into the darkness and Draco knew better than to complain now. He watched in horror as the old man waddled down the hallway, talking to his cat.
That night, Harry stayed up late with Ron in the common room, working on homework they’d ignored over the past few days. Hermione had been with them, but after nearly falling asleep over the table, she was convinced to go to sleep, leaving the two boys alone. After about the tenth time Ron cursed at himself for making a spelling mistake, Harry put his own quill down. “Ron, have you heard yet about the performance we’re going to have for music lessons?” Harry decided that Ron didn’t hear anything about it, because his face dropped as soon as Harry told him.
“It’s habit!” he whined. Draco stood up, grabbing his bag.
“I told you. The only thing here that scares me more than the idiot running this place is that damn cat. Are professors even allowed to have animals at Hogwarts?” he wondered out loud. Potter looked like he was about to argue when Draco huffed, letting him know the conversation was over. They turned a corner and went down a few steps, startling the painting of a young boy who was sleeping at his desk.
“You’re out here, too. Don’t forget that. Unless you want detention with me, and to miss music lessons as well as Quidditch practice,” Potter said with a determined look on his face.
Draco woke up with a pleasant feeling. A smile grew on his face knowing that he would have Double Potions today, and not even a class full of Gryffindors could ruin his mood today.
“Malfoy, come on. You know you hate this situation even more than I do. There’s no way you’d stay sane living at my home, nor would you ever be comfortable enough to stay any longer in Gryffindor robes.” Harry waited for Malfoy’s response, which took a lot longer than he’d expected.
“Okay Potter,” he spat. “You want to be stuck in my body forever? Be my guest. Have fun with my father and try not to ruin my life, please.” He stood up to leave when Harry scoffed.
“I’m not done, just giving it a once over,” Harry explained before he opened the book back up and began intently reading the publication date. He saw Malfoy roll his eyes and manage a small smile.
“I don’t feel well. I’ll just eat and head back,” he excused. Blaise sighed but didn’t reply. Harry was led to the Slytherin table, but as he eyed Ron and Hermione across the room, he saw himself sitting there, sipping pumpkin juice. He was dumbfounded, and made eye contact with himself. The other Harry widened his eyes and spat out the juice. Harry himself was shocked, too. As he was being lured along by Blaise, the other Harry rushed over to him, grabbed Harry’s arm, and was yanked out of the room. The last thing Harry saw before the doors closed was Blaise standing there looking shocked and Ron and Hermione looking shocked as well.
“Why did I sign it?” Harry laughed, and found himself looking at the list again. Draco Malfoy’s name was a few lines above Harry’s; he found himself wondering what Malfoy would choose to play. “Well,” Ron announced. “I’m going to bed before Hermione comes back with those forms.” And at that, he stood up and walked out of the room. More people began filing out and Harry decided he would go to bed as well. It’s been an unusual week, he thought.
“I’m going to be spending the day researching our, um, condition. And I can’t be bothered to remember your classes nor take notes for you.”
“Ugh, you got something wet on me. Disgusting, Potter. Can’t keep in your own drool?” He snickered, and then walked away, leaving Harry to pick everything up. Snape watched the whole thing from afar, not bothering to interfere, as always.
“Figure it out, and I will, too.” Harry really had nothing to say. It seemed to him like Malfoy was seriously stressed out, which kind of made sense. He was also pretty stressed, but very, very tired.
‘Probably my dashing looks. Not even he can resist them.’ Pansy snickered and wrote something down while Draco looked up, meeting Potter’s eyes. He glared while Potter looked down, blushing. Draco became outraged; surely Potter was the most idiotic person on Earth, doesn’t he know to forget what happened? Draco thought.
“Ah, I’ll think about it. What’s your name?”
“Well, you said you’d learn the same instrument as me. Have fun on the violin,” he said with a grin. Ron was not pleased by the idea; he was sure these lessons wouldn’t happen.
