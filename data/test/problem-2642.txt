“You can…” Draco swallowed hard, trying to slow his breathing. “I want you to.”
“Here, I’ll clear some of this,” Blaise said, reaching for his wand.
“Maybe a different colour next time,” Draco grumbled.
Granger’s eyebrows shot up in surprise. She glanced at Theo, and then back at Lavender. But the moment passed, and she smiled at them as she said, “That’s alright. We weren’t planning to come, either, but we thought it might be nice to get out of the castle for a while.”
Harry shook his head. “No. I’m not going to do that.”
Draco closed his eyes as a shudder passed through him. If he focused on it too long, he knew exactly the sensation Harry was referring to—a sickening sense of dread that seemed to emanate from his arm, cloaking him in grief.
It was, as far as Draco was concerned, absolute nonsense, but Harry was regarding Lovegood as seriously as if she were McGonagall lecturing them on Transfiguration. “So how do we fix it, Luna? If it’s the repressed memories causing him problems, what do we do?”
“Oh, er…alright.” Taken by surprise, Theo faltered. “He works as a security guard, now.”
As the others said their goodbyes, Theo clasped Draco’s hand. He hesitated, and then leaned in to say, “Let me know about that position at the Ministry, Draco. But it’s no pressure. Alright?”
“Of course he’s not,” Harry suddenly said. It was the first time he had spoken since arriving. “Who cares what Slughorn thinks?”
"How dare you be so rude,” his father hissed.
“Tomorrow’s Christmas Eve,” Harry mused. When Draco said nothing, he asked, “Are you sad you won’t be with your parents?”
“Yeah.”
“What’s that?” he asked, pointing at a strange, winged figure at the top. “It looks like a lion.”
That, of course, only stoked Draco’s arousal further, just as it sparked off something sweet and warm in the pit of his stomach. In a shaky voice, he breathed, “Okay.”
“You’ll have me crying if you don’t stop,” he said drily.
Draco had a hundred questions, but he couldn’t decide what to ask first. Looking around the vast room, he finally said, “I’ve never been in the kitchens before. How did you know how to get in?”
After a few moments, Draco thought he saw the inkpot twitch a bit.
“That—I—”
“You may not have noticed, sir, but the other students aren’t exactly keen on me this year,” he said idly.
“Lost?” Draco supplied.
“It wasn’t a trick!” she cried. “He
“Can you bring us?” Harry said. “We need to get to the Ministry, right away.”
“A bit.”
“Father,” he said stiffly. He shifted to the armchair Daphne had just vacated.
The stands were empty save for a stout little wizard dressed in yellow and black robes. His unshaven face split into a wide grin as he caught sight of them; bouncing to his feet, he hurried down, holding out his hand as he approached them.
"Really?” Draco blinked at him in surprise. “So…it just has to be a happy thought, then.”
“I’m fine,” he muttered. “I’m fine, I promise. Just…shaken up.”
“No,” said Daphne. “Tell me: who has a problem with Dean?” None of them dared look at her.
She gave a cold, bitter laugh. “Of course not. They want to keep an eye on me. They’re very
“Well, I’m not.”
you leave school. That is our condition.”
a bit fuzzier than it had been—the outline was blurred, as though someone had rubbed at the inky lines. As calmly as he could, Draco said, “Yeah. It looks…better.”
“What was what? I have no idea what you’re on about, Potter—let me go, you’ve lost your mind—"
“Disgusting,” Draco hissed.
In the face of Draco’s chilly silence, Slughorn said, “Well then, Mr. Malfoy, what exactly are your interests? Any career in particular you’ve thought about?”
Draco had never been to Azkaban before. He knew that visitors were heavily regulated; the prison could only be accessed by Floo through authorized grates at the Ministry, and appointments had to be made weeks in advance. Everything about his mother’s plan terrified him. He hadn’t seen her in months. What would they talk about? Surely, his mother would scold him for failing to write. He couldn’t bear a row. He also had no interest in visiting the Ministry. Between his own hearings and his parents’, he had become too acquainted with the atrium, the lifts, the courtrooms. And then, of course, there was Azkaban itself—haunted by Dementors and filled with Death Eaters, there was nowhere he would have rather less visited. If, somehow, he made it through all of that without falling apart, there was then the question of what he would say to his father. Would they discuss his friends? His classes? Their plans for the summer holidays? All while his father sat in a cell and Dementors supervised the visit?
“Then don’t ask,” Draco said. Blaise snorted.
“Mmm.”
At first, Draco wasn’t sure what Potter was referring to. Glancing over, he saw Potter reaching for his arm. “I don’t know why you bother to ask,” he muttered, looking away as he stretched his arm out onto Potter’s lap.
Theo shook his head. “No, not at all. Lots of people only have their O.W.L.s, and anyway, with the partial credits we got…” Catching sight of the look on Pansy’s face, he said hastily, “But you should finish out the year! It’s really important.”
But Draco’s heart still twisted violently. “You don’t think it’s worth it?” he asked, grasping his left arm. “Getting rid of the Mark?”
“Would you like a medal?” he sneered.
“Sure.”
But Draco was hardly listening to Lovegood; his eyes were fixed on Harry as he hurtled after the Snitch. As the Seekers flit through the air, Baddock scored another point for Slytherin, bringing the score to twenty-zero.
“No. I did it because I’m afraid.”
“Who’s keeping secrets?” Nott demanded. “No secrets in this dorm! Tell me.”
“Yeah.” Uncomfortable, Draco pried his arm away. As he pulled down his sleeve, Potter seemed to come to his senses. Abashed, he extinguished his wand, casting them again into darkness. Draco didn’t know what to do. He was still too lightheaded to stand up and head back to the castle, but he had no interest in sitting with Potter longer than necessary.
Potter frowned. “So why didn’t you ask to do something else?”
“I don’t know what to think of him,” he whispered.
The next day at breakfast, he received a reply from his mother. She had scrawled a few lines at the bottom of his letter:
There were worse ways to spend an evening. The fire was crackling away in the hearth, and Draco had changed into the comfiest clothes he owned: a sweater and a pair of flannel bottoms. He and Blaise were supposed to be working on their Potions paper, but instead they were flipping through the latest issue of the
Unless the Cannons pull out some sort of miracle at their next game, or they Confund every single player, there’s just no way. None.”
“Minister, I…I…”
“Have I…have I said the wrong thing?”
“How did you do that?” Draco asked, gaping at him.
“I haven’t agreed to go with him to Azkaban, if that’s what you’re on about,” Draco warned him.
you for anything. It’s just…he wakes up, and you’re not in bed.”
Reaching for a sandwich, Draco said, “How do you know those two, then? Kreacher, is it? And Winky?”
Blaise smirked. “I’m not worried about you, if that’s your concern. But still…” He leaned forward and traced his lips across Draco’s jaw, whispering, “You haven’t been much fun lately. Remember all the fun we used to get up to?”
“Tell me you want it. Tell me. Let me hear you.”
“It’s weird, isn’t it?” Harry said softly. “To think that your parents’ only chance at getting away is this tiny, little bottle.”
“It’s hard, isn’t it? You grow up believing one thing, and then all of this happens. And then you don’t know what to think.”
“No,” Draco rasped. His throat ached. “I want it gone. Completely.”
to see my mother at Christmas,” he went on. He sounded rather hysterical. “In my second year, they went on a trip to Peru. I stayed here. It was nice.”
They stood in silence for a moment, appraising each other, when finally, Harry said, “I know what happened at the hearing. Yesterday night, I sort of…heard what they were planning. And I figured, unless Shacklebolt managed to change most of their minds before today, then…” He took a deep breath, and then finished lamely, “It doesn’t look good.”
“And then we’ll sleep—where? My bedroom? Oh, that would be great, wouldn’t it? Spend the night in that room where I heard awful, just awful things. No.”
“Mmm.” Harry trailed his thumb along Draco’s lips, gently parting his mouth before drawing a line down his chin and across his jaw. “I’ve been wanting to touch you all day. I don’t know how I’m going to bear it, keeping my hands off you until the end of the year.”
Draco’s stomach was in knots. He hoped that perhaps Pansy was lying, or had confused things somehow, but the resolute look on her face told him otherwise. “I don’t understand. The other day, when we were talking about Brown, he mentioned that she’s a pure-blood. Remember? He said ‘at least she’s a pure-blood.’”
“Mmm.”
“Well…alright. I guess it couldn’t hurt.”
“No, use this.” Draco bit back his irritation as Potter leaned forward, opening the drawer and rooting around until he pulled out a bottle of lubricant.
Draco untied the parchment from Callidus’ leg and unfurled it. His stomach clenched as he saw that it was from his parents. How stupid—he had always looked forward to his parents’ letters and the treats they sent him. But he swore he could feel their misery seeping out of the parchment in his hands.
“Right. You’d best get back to sleep. Keep an eye out for my next letter.” And with that, before he could say goodbye, his father’s face had disappeared.
“Do you think he’ll tell people?” Zabini asked darkly.
“Okay.” Harry took out his wand and brought it to his temple. He screwed up his face in concentration, and then, as he took his wand away, glittering silver stands came along with it. Draco watched as he added his thoughts to the basin. The airy liquid in the bowl began to froth and spin. Still, Harry added more memories, relaxing his face now as it seemed to come easier. When he stopped, the contents of the bowl swirled slowly. Draco could make out his own, pale face within the mist.
Draco would have given anything to come up with a comforting reply, but he was terrible in these sorts of situations. As kindly as he could, he said, “I’m sure he would have liked that.”
Draco gave a shaky laugh and wiped his face with the back of his hand. “No. I didn’t. Probably deserved to, but I didn’t. But back then…obviously we didn’t know I’d survive…My mother, she’s a very rational person, my mother is…but she went to every Seer you can think of. Had my palm read. Had some hag come to the Manor to read my tea leaves. Dragged me all the way to Guilin to see some expert in Chinese Fortune Sticks, don’t know if you’ve ever heard of those…that was a bloody awful trip…and all the while my father just goes on
At the very least, their study group was more organized than it had been last week. Nearly every fifth-, sixth-, seventh-, and eighth-year student attended; the Great Hall was so crowded that Proudfoot cleared away the Ravenclaw table as well before leaving them to it. Most of the students opted to practice their Summoning Charms. Potter, to Draco’s surprise, encouraged them to try their hand at casting nonverbally.
Diggle had them learning general defensive spells—Shield Charms, counter-spells, revulsion jinxes. The room was loud with the sounds of students shouting and occasionally falling against desks and chairs. It was too loud, much too loud; a headache had already started to squeeze his head like a vice. The result was that Draco was quite on edge as Blaise continued to fling hexes at him, looking to break through his Shield Charm.
The sneer returned to Blaise’s face. “Let’s try it, then. Ready?” Draco nodded. They paused, waiting for the other to make a move, when Blaise whipped his wand forward. Draco reacted a fraction too late; his wand flew from his hand, soaring towards Blaise. He caught it, grinning slyly.
“Your appetite’s back up,” she said. “But anyway. Sitting with Potter and his friends…that was
Draco took a long swig of firewhisky. When they continued to stare at him, he shrugged. “Too busy this year. With my N.E.W.T.s, you know.”
His mother seemed to understand; she rested her hand briefly on his arm, and then rose to her feet. “Would either of you like more tea?”
“Partly.” Harry pushed back his chair and looked up at the great ceiling. “But mostly, I just couldn’t take it. I felt sick after. It was almost like being around the Dementors.”
“Whatever. Let me by. And stay the fuck away from me.” He couldn’t explain his rage, only that it was fueled by his mind’s attempt at working through all the possible ways that Potter could get him and his family into further trouble. He stormed back into the pub and found Pansy, who had moved her chair and was now sitting next to Padma Patil. They were giggling together; somehow that irritated him further.
Thursday mornings he had double Arithmancy, and Professor Vector was notoriously strict about punctuality. Draco checked his watch, saw that he had fifteen minutes to get to class, and hurried back to the castle. In the entrance hall, he waded through the crowd of students when he suddenly felt a hand grip his forearm. He jumped, whirling around.
Granger grimaced and, as though it pained her to do so, she said, “No. Let her speak.”
“I’ll read it later.”
“No.” Draco pushed his bowl away; his stomach was in knots, driving away any appetite he might have had. “Absolutely not.”
shop. What can I get for you, sir?”
“You are?”
Slughorn sighed and lowered himself back into his chair. “Well—yes, that’s all. Take some pamphlets if you like.” He waved his hand at the glossy brochures in front of him, but Draco was already halfway out the door.
—the things they did, you don’t know, you have no idea.” He was rambling, he knew. But there was no way to put into words the terrible things he had seen, no way to convey the depths of depravity he had witnessed. “I didn’t know, when I started. Or, no, I knew. But I didn’t get it. Didn’t understand. Honestly, I believed what my parents said.
Harry shrugged. “Why aren't you?”
“Come on, then. I know what will cheer you up.” And before Draco could stop her, she was dragging him across the pub towards Harry and his friends. Granger noticed them first, pausing as she brought her drink halfway to her mouth.
Although Draco didn't want to fight with her, he couldn’t help but snap, “It’s not really your business, anyway.”
“Dunno. Depends on what you decide to do.”
“Nothing. Only that we need to let all of this rivalry between houses go. It’s so stupid. Hermione agrees.” When Draco said nothing, he added, “Wasn’t the point of everything to move forward? I’m so sick of dividing everything by family, by blood, by house…aren’t you?”
But Harry looked very real to him as he walked back and set a vial of olive oil onto his desk. And he sounded very real when he said, “Can I ask you something?” Without waiting for an answer, he went on in a low voice, “You said there had been complaints about your marks, right? That’s why Slughorn talked to you in the first place?”
“I’d imagine so.” He wrinkled his nose as Pansy shoved several packages of fudge into his hands.
Blaise cocked an eyebrow. “Can one of you explain what’s going on?”
“You will not,” he said flatly. “Or I’ll write to yours. I’m sure your mother would just love to hear about what you got up to in France last summer.”
, he carefully drew the velvet pouch from under his cloak. The little crimson sack was tied with black drawstrings. Though he knew he shouldn’t, Draco was sorely tempted to open it. He felt along the pouch, trying to make out its contents, and he swore there was some kind of bottle inside. He shook it—no sound at all. Vexed, he tucked the package under his textbooks, hoping whatever it contained wasn’t too fragile. He closed his trunk and tapped it once with his wand, locking it.
Too panicked to try to lie, Draco asked, “How did you know?”
Draco considered the satisfaction he might gain from snapping his old wand in half—a clean break from the past, maybe—but then he shook his head. “No…I’ll keep it, I think,” he said. “It'll be a good reminder."
Harry was listening to him quietly. Draco knew he shouldn’t be saying all of this, but he couldn’t help it: once it had started to spill out, he couldn’t control the deluge. “So then the Dark Lord comes back at the end of our fourth year. And I think to myself, well, he’s in a difficult situation, right? Because if he doesn’t go back with the Death Eaters…they’ll kill him. You won’t believe what the Dark Lord let my father get away with. I don’t know why. I guess because he was useful. But I figured it was all an act, just a way to line his pockets a bit more, or to keep us out of trouble. But then they started—started bringing me when they would…go. We would go out and…” He couldn’t say it. Harry nodded, showing that he understood. In a hoarse voice, Draco continued: “It was awful, the stuff I saw. And he was doing it, too. He
“We have the rest of the holidays!” Draco protested.
They walked back to the castle in silence, Pansy gripping his arm tightly. It had finally started to rain. Thick raindrops dripped down on them; they slipped down Draco’s brow, his cheeks. Neither of them bothered to conjure an umbrella, nor did they pick up the pace as they traipsed down the path.
“Draco?” Daphne was staring up at him with wide, confused eyes.
“Really?” Harry pulled back and eyed him critically. “You’re going to show up in the tightest shirt I’ve ever seen, and trousers that leave
“Shall we Apparate, then?” Theo asked, already drawing out his wand.
“Kiss me,” Draco murmured. Harry took a moment to look at him, as though taking him in, and then finally he pressed their lips together, groaning as Draco deepened the kiss. Pressed up against the door, he basked in Harry’s warmth, his reassuring weight as his hands came up to cup Draco’s face. He felt protected, as though Harry was shielding him from the spectres still lingering in the house. He grabbed Harry’s shoulders and pulled him closer still. He smelled of shampoo from the shower, his hair still damp under Draco’s fingers. He was soft and hard all at once—his worn jumper and gentle hands contrasted sharply with the way he held Draco against the door. They kissed urgently, as though they were both aware of what was about to happen and neither of them could quite believe it.
“Isn’t it? Don’t you want to see my father suffer like everyone else does?”
Draco drew his arm away, suddenly fearful. He tried to recall what they had just witnessed, but whatever memory they had just been subjected to had already trickled away. “Did I do something terrible?” he whispered.
“The thing is,” Pansy said, turning back to her paper, “I think he wants to know if you’ll go with him, sometime.”
“We’ll be going to the theatre,” Pansy went on. “My father’s gotten us all tickets.” Draco grimaced. Pansy, catching sight of him, said quickly, “Don’t worry. He’s sure your mother will be able to leave the country by then. Everyone says so.”
Blaise was now at his side. “I didn’t mean to do it,” he said weakly, passing Draco his wand.
“What should I do? Is it another flashback?”
Greg shrugged him off. “Just be careful.” With that, he shuffled out of the room, leaving Draco in a state of pure terror. He had no idea if he could trust Greg or not. God, how could he have been so stupid? This was all a mistake. If they got caught, if people found out he was shagging Harry Potter, they would hate him more than they already did. He would be accused of cursing Potter, of threatening him, of feeding him a Love Potion. His father’s position would become even more precarious. As these thoughts raced through his mind, he almost didn’t hear Delacour when she called his name. Standing in the doorway, she asked him again, “Monsieur Malfoy? Are you coming?”
“Don’t give me that,” Potter snapped. “You tried to use
“Am I? I hadn’t noticed.”
, you need to sleep—”
“I just thought…you looked angry, and then you left…”
The others went to bed when he did. Zabini turned off the lights, casting the room into darkness. In his bed, the curtains draw around him, Draco basked in the relief of finally being alone with his thoughts. There was simply too much to process. What he had done with Potter...it had been less than an hour ago, and yet he already felt as though it had been a dream. A strange, surreal, incredibly erotic dream, in which Potter had driven him absolutely mad with his hands, his mouth. And why? That was the most vexing part of all. According to Potter, he didn’t like blokes.. Of all the people to experiment with, why him? He still couldn’t shake the fear that he was being set up somehow, that this was all some elaborate prank, or worse. And yet there was no denying the captivated look on Potter’s face. He certainly hadn’t been laughing. But why wouldn’t he let Draco touch him? Maybe he didn’t dare allow himself to be sullied by a Death Eater, thought himself too good to stoop to that level...but then why would he  get down on his knees so eagerly...
“Let’s meet again tomorrow,” Harry said. He gestured towards Draco’s arm. “We should try to finish before it snows.”
Granger gave a shy little smile. “I’ll be staying with my parents for Christmas. We didn’t get to spend the holidays together last year.”
kind of a reaction, but Blaise and Pansy were now looking back for him. He shot Potter one last frown before pushing past him.
“Father? Your Floo is being watched?” Draco sat up in alarm. “If they catch you, if they suspect you of anything—”
“And you’re an insufferable git,” Harry said. Draco could hear the smile in his voice.
Snarling, he ripped himself away. Their sudden separation caused Potter to gasp as though he had been drenched with cold water. They sat there scowling at each other.
“What’s going on?” Draco startled as Theo came up behind them.
Sensing his discomfort, Harry said, “It’s fine. They won’t mind.”
“I don’t want to see that again,” he said. “Understood?”
Draco was spectacularly sad. He didn’t know what else to say.
“Mate, I hope I didn’t upset you,” Theo said nervously.
“Sure,” Potter said, startled. “I just figured, you’re always so quick to get back…”
“Does it really matter?” Zabini asked tersely. He had three chapters of
“You had it earlier.”
“I’m not going.”
“Er—yes?”
“Oh, no, nothing like that. He tried to suppress them, by distracting himself.”
“Just a few,” Pansy said. She was bent over, her nose nearly touching the parchment as she carefully labeled her drawing.
In the dark, he could just make out Potter’s bright green eyes. He couldn’t place the look on his face. Suddenly cold, he crossed his arms against his chest.
“And then…I don’t know. We got to know each other. A while ago, he told me we’re friends.”
“It’s freezing!” Pansy cried, rubbing her arms. “Come on, let’s get back.” She turned to Theo and wrapped him in another hug. As they said their goodbyes, Draco stood off to the side, ill at ease. He thought again about what Theo had said about Greg, and for some reason, he felt sick to his stomach. He couldn’t think about Greg without also thinking of Vincent.
They gaped at him in disbelief. Instantly, he was ashamed of himself. But the shame mixed with indignation—why couldn’t they leave him alone? Why did they care what had happened at the Manor? What did it matter to them? And why were they constantly nagging him?
“When? Today?”
fancy girls. And then, between the Dark Lord’s return, his father’s mishandling of the events at the Ministry, and his failed attempts to kill Dumbledore, he hadn’t exactly had time for a boyfriend. But his fear ran deeper than that. If he forced himself to be brutally, frighteningly honest, the truth was that he had spent much of his life being disappointed by people who said they cared for him. And he wasn’t sure if he could handle it if Harry went on to do the same.
There was something tender in Draco’s eyes, but then it flitted away as he twisted his fingers in Harry’s hair and yanked. “I’ve told you to behave,” he growled. “I’ll leave you here, wanting it. Don’t think I won’t.”
“Oh, yes, that went very well, didn’t it?” Draco sniffed. “I wonder what Dumbledore would say if he knew you had a former Death Eater in your bed every night.” He was filled with a self-loathing so strong that his hands shook.
people. Sometimes the killing wasn’t even the worst part, because then at least it’s over for them, right? God, what a fucking thing to say.”
“No.”
that.”
Draco strode towards Pritchard and pulled him away roughly. Ignoring his indignant yelp, he hissed into his ear, “Put your wand away, you idiot.”
!” A single screw fell to the floor.
“Is that so?” Harry leaned so close to him that their lips were nearly touching. “So you’re fine if I just walk off, then.”
“Why?”
Draco picked through it and held up a jar for further inspection: U-No-Poo. He wrinkled his nose in disgust. He had just taken a sip of tea when Potter unwrapped a book from Weasley—
Furious, Draco made to push past him back into the pub, but Potter gripped his arm. Draco struggled against him, ripping his arm from Potter’s grasp. He snarled, but Potter didn’t seem angry—he merely stared at him, as though he had never seen him properly before.
Draco nodded. He felt feverish, caught somewhere between states of consciousness. It was difficult to sort out his thoughts, hazy as they were, but he knew that he wanted Harry on the bed. Now. And so he pushed off from the door and pulled him along, tugging his hand as he crawled up onto the sheets. Draco settled onto the pillows and reached for Harry, who came to lay next to him.
?” Pansy shrieked. Several heads swiveled towards them. “What are you on about, Blaise?”
“You have such a good memory,” Pansy grumbled, flipping the page. “Why is everything so
“Just leave me alone! I don’t know what’s gotten into you, why you’re so touched in the head this year, but stop. I mean it.”
“Nosy, aren’t you?”
“I’m working on it,” he said tersely.
“Oh, Draco,” Pansy sighed. “This is why I hate reading the paper first thing in the morning. Blaise, can’t you find the Quidditch section?”
“But I had no problem with Theo,” he argued. “With Theo and Lavender Brown.”
“I’m just so excited!” Pansy drew away and fanned her face. She was nearly as red as her robes. “We have your presents here, but you’ll be opening them at the Manor, won’t you? Draco, your mother’s in the sitting room—she’ll be here any moment—you’re only just in time for dinner—have you told her that Harry’s going with you to the Manor?” Eyes widening, she said in a very loud whisper, “Does she
Harry shook his head. “You don’t need to decide that.”
Even as butterflies burst in his stomach, Draco forced his face into as neutral an expression as possible. It wouldn’t do, he thought, to show Harry how quickly he fell apart at his words. Instead, he teased, “You think?”
“Yes. All the time. Usually my father’s business associates, or someone coming to ask for a favour. My father was very good at doing favours for people. It put them in his debt. You wouldn’t believe the amount of people at the Ministry who’ve owed my father over the years. Of course, I guess that doesn’t really matter, now.” This was too painful to talk about—he swallowed hard, and then said, “But, yes. We had visitors all the time. Every summer we’d do a dinner party out in the gardens. It was supposed to be for charity. My mother would be frantic the week before. Actually, it was kind of funny. One summer—I must have been eight, maybe nine, but no, I think eight—I let off a Dungbomb in the sitting room. I can’t remember why.” He frowned, trying to recall. “I was probably just bored, or I wanted my mother’s attention. But anyway, she was
“Forget about it.”
“Why can’t we just be in the greenhouses like normal?” Pansy snapped, pushing her hair out of her face. “This is so stupid.”
Though it had annoyed him before, Draco had to admit that her squeals of excitement were oddly endearing. Madam Pince hushed them angrily. They sniggered, leaning over their textbooks in case she came to find the source of the disturbance.
“Yes, Potter, I know what you’re talking about,” he breathed. “I know exactly what you’re talking about. But what the fuck do you want me to do about it?”
The strained silence between them was filled with the roaring sound of the lawnmower. A few cars went by. Draco was especially fascinated by cars—in the evenings, they would sometimes eat their dinner outside, and as the Muggles drove home from work Draco asked Potter about each car’s model and make. He had gotten quite good at identifying the most common ones. Of course, he had already known about cars before coming here, but never before had he been exposed to so many.
“Why’s he such a prude? I never thought Weasley of all people would be some sort of…some sort of bigot. What’s it matter to him?”
“Er…yeah.” A moment of silence, and then: “Why didn’t dittany heal your scars?”
Draco was nervous, waiting outside of Slughorn’s office. He told himself not to be—he had faced much worse terrors than his Head of House. But his teachers’ reactions to him had run the full gamut this year, from ignoring him entirely to being openly hostile, and he wasn't sure yet where Slughorn fell. They rarely spoke in Potions, as Slughorn was usually chattering away with Potter and his friends, swooning in the presence of the Chosen One.
“What we saw, it was…it was really bad. I…” In a very quiet voice, Potter said, “I didn’t know.”
“Let’s go to the lake,” Blaise said, consulting his list. “We still need to do bearberries.”
Draco meant to write to his mother, but he kept putting it off. He didn’t know what to say, and he was afraid to ask questions. In any case, it was easy to distract himself with schoolwork: it seemed as though the faculty had collectively decided to cram as much as possible into the final weeks before the Christmas holidays. Delacour was expecting three feet of parchment on conjuration, and Vector had set them the complicated task of composing their own numerical charts. Meanwhile, Sprout had them tending to their own Alihotsy trees, which required that they visit the greenhouse every other evening. And Babbling expected them to memorize two chapters of runes before they left for holidays.
He wasn’t surprised when a deafening roar filled his ears. Uncomfortably aware of his pulse as it galloped away, Draco only just managed to stumble back to his bed. Leaning over the sheets, he groaned as an awful vision burst before him: the Dark Lord’s wand against his arm, ripping through his skin, his flesh curdling as thick plumes of steam escaped the wound. He was screaming, and it
“I mean…” He gave a shaky sigh. “Sometimes. After he’d call us. Or whenever he was angry.”
Potter shook his head. “We haven’t erased that one.”
echoing throughout the castle, and then the Room of Requirement…feeling certain he was going to die in the unimaginable heat, and then wondering if perhaps it wouldn’t be so horrible, dying…
She nodded sagely. “Well, they wouldn’t trust just anyone with teaching students, would they?”
“And the Wizengamot will believe that?” Draco asked hotly.
“They are. I thought it all might be coming to a head, and that it would ease once my Mark was gone. But if we can’t erase it, then…”
“Why did you stop?” Granger asked.
Bill Weasley brought a whirlwind of energy into the house that took them both by surprise. Draco knew Potter was bitter about not being able to attend his wedding with Delacour, and he had been bracing himself for a horrific mood swing, but instead Potter seemed happy to pepper him with questions. Weasley was in high spirits. He showed them the ring on his finger, and told them all about the wedding, the guests, the ceremony. Of course, they knew about the interruption, and the resulting chaos, but Potter seemed determined not to talk about that. Instead, he asked about the food and the gifts they received. Draco sat at the dining table, amused—he had never expected Potter to be so keenly interested in which marquee company the Weasleys had employed. He suspected, though, that his curiosity was motivated by the same desire Draco felt for some sort of normalcy. It was strange to think that outside of these walls, people were going about their lives, getting married and attending parties.
“He blows up stuff a lot less often these days,” Harry assured him. “And he’s got some good stories about his summer in County Kerry.”
“Right.”
“Look. You can hardly see the eyes, now.”
I can guarantee you he’s up to something. Why doesn’t he just ask Granger? You’re telling me there’s no one else at Hogwarts who can teach him? Why you of all people?”
Draco shook his head. Something buried deep within his mind told him not to accept, although he couldn’t say why. “I don’t want to draw attention to myself. I’ll wait for the holidays.”
“No. I’ve told you, we only tried twice.”
Harry laughed at that; again, several heads swiveled towards them. Harry seemed not to notice. “Dunno. Guess I’m happier this year.”
, along with several yellow and black pins.
“What are you going to do, then?” Blaise snorted. “Pine after him for the rest of the year?”
Something bitter curled up in his stomach. “Check the
Draco gnashed his teeth as Harry held his arm in place. Even as the memory disintegrated, like sand slipping between his fingers, he could still see those red eyes glinting in the light of the fire, gauging his reaction, narrowing in amusement whenever he stumbled.
As the feast finally came to an end, Harry leaned towards Draco and murmured, “Let’s do something fun.”
She smiled at them and then glided out of the room. The moment she left, Draco sank back into the sofa, letting out a sharp exhale.
, Mr. Potter,” said Proudfoot, speaking over him, “are performing magic wizards twice your age can’t accomplish, but you’re also rudderless. So take this opportunity to learn, to hone your own skills. You can’t teach something until you’ve mastered it. It’s not experts who teach. We become experts
“You’ve told her, then? About…” Draco wanted to say “us,” but that sounded odd. As though there was any sort of him and Potter that formed an “us.”
Draco ripped the door open when Potter said, “Wait.” He dug around in his pocket and then pulled out a handful of gold coins.
” He ground his hips down roughly.
“Well, we’ve spoken through Floo before.” He frowned. “Or I could just write. Their mail’s being checked, though.”
“Hey,” Draco said, alarmed at the fearful look on Harry's face. “Nothing’s happened. I’m right here.” He reached forward and took Harry’s hand in his, bringing it to cup his face. “See? Right here.”
“We have Care of Magical Creatures together,” she explained. “And a few weeks ago, I noticed Dean sketching the Porlocks…and it was good,
“I couldn’t tell you,” he said. “She hasn’t written me in days. I think she’s gone into a complete panic.”
“I’d rather spend my Christmas cooking in the Hogwarts kitchens,” he said stiffly.
“I think it’s a journal,” Draco said. He felt oddly touched.
“Dunno,” he shrugged. “For my tuition?”
“That’s how it was,” Draco said quietly. He turned his head and watched as the wet grass rustled in the breeze. “That’s what they did.”
“Well, anyway, the first time we tried, it started with my father asking me to check if it was Harry or not. And then we stopped. And then when we tried again, it picked up at the part where Harry took the wands out of my hand.”
“Come in,” Slughorn called from inside. Draco stepped into what had once been Severus' office. It had since been redecorated with plush gilded sofas, an ornate rug at the center of the room, and an enormous oak desk. The room felt unbearably claustrophobic, with side tables squashed in alongside winged armchairs, and a large variety of tapestries and framed portraits hung along the walls. Slughorn sat at his desk, rifling through some papers.
Harry shrugged. “I’m switching things up.”
“You!” Weasley growled. “How the hell can you show your face here?” Granger was at Weasley’s side, her face red as she tugged on his arm.
“No.” Draco shook his head vehemently. “You’re the only thing keeping me
“They’ll look into it,” Draco repeated. “They’ll find out that my father meant to give them the slip, and my role in everything. Just leave it be.”
Draco shook his head, dismissing Harry’s concern. “Push me.”
“I still don’t see the point in this,” he complained. “Half of them can’t even manage a proper Cheering Charm. Isn’t this the faculty’s job?”
He wanted desperately to open up the vial and confirm his suspicions, but he knew better. After all these years, he was still afraid of his father, and the prospect of angering him was daunting. Besides, there was also the question of whether opening it would be safe. There were extremely complicated potions that spoiled if they were opened too early or by the wrong person. What if he ruined his father’s one chance at escaping the Dementor’s Kiss? What if he accidentally spilled it? And that was another thing—knowing the velvet pouch contained a small, glass vial was horribly nerve-wracking. He now kept it exclusively in his satchel, carefully tucked away at the bottom so as not to crush it under his textbooks. Whenever he accidentally bumped into a student in the busy corridors, the moment he was alone he checked the pouch to make sure that the vial hadn’t broken. Fortunately, it seemed quite robust.
“Piss off, Potter.” He was suddenly angry. “What do you think I’m up to now? The Dark Lord’s gone, isn’t he? So what the hell could you possibly suspect me of?”
“What should we do with our last night together?” Draco asked, blowing on a hot spoonful of potato soup.
To Draco’s relief, his mother gave Harry a little smile. “I’ll be delighted. Any friend of Draco’s is a friend of ours. Please, let’s sit.”
“Oh, he’s alright. Always getting fouls, though. Ravenclaw’s got a good Captain this year. Bradley, isn’t it? He’s always had a good build for a Chaser.”
Draco wasn’t sure whether it was a dream, or a memory, or perhaps some figment of his imagination, but in his mind’s eye he saw himself on his broomstick, soaring through the air. And there were Vincent and Greg, playing as Beaters…it was nice to see Vincent again, he thought…and there was Potter, shooting past him as he searched for the Snitch…and Draco decided to chase after him, because why not…wherever Potter went, good things happened…wherever Potter went, the Snitch would surely be there…and so he tailed him, but there was no animosity between them, no real competition…it was wonderful, up in the air, keeping an eye on Potter as he scouted for the Snitch…
Harry wavered, and then said softly, “I’ve never done this.”
“Could you do me a favour?” he asked.
“It’s nice to see all of you,” Theo said, leaning towards them. “Lav talks about you three all the time.”
“I’ll write you. Every day, I’ll write you. And we’ll find each other…after.”
He grabbed Pansy by the arm and led her out to the entrance hall, Daphne close behind them.
Draco shook his head. “There were a few times when my parents, I think they wondered…his Patronus, you know, and sometimes, the things he said…but they trusted him. Especially after he made the Vow.”
“G’night.” Harry gave him one last smile before heading up the staircase.
“Because. It just didn’t work out. But not because of…” Potter motioned vaguely in Draco’s direction. “Whatever this is.”
“Let’s start practicing, then,” said Potter. “Remember, Summoning Charms, and once you’ve got the hang of it, try nonverbally.” His cheeks were pink, and Draco thought with amusement that perhaps he was embarrassed at having been bested in front of his admirers. The students worked on Summoning various items they had left scattered throughout the Great Hall—goblets, platters, cutlery—and a few of them also worked on their Banishing Charms. Draco and Potter circulated among them; he was particularly gleeful at the opportunity to correct the Gryffindor students as they failed to cast nonverbally. Soon the hour was up, and Potter dismissed them, urging them to practice their Summoning Charms, which could use some work all around.
His heart skipped a beat. And then another. And then a few more. He didn’t know what to say. Surely, he must be dreaming—or his mind had taken pity on him and deposited him into some wonderful fantasy in which Harry was cupping his face, staring down at him, their lips only inches apart.
Draco didn’t know what to make of that. He shoved his hands into his pockets, feeling childish, and asked, “May I go, sir? I have an essay to finish.”
“Oh, Draco, he was
“Draco,” Harry whispered. He sounded almost nervous. “I’m going to kiss you. Alright?”
“Just say ‘Ministry of Magic.’ But, Harry, nobody will be there now, not at this time…and it’s Christmas Eve…”
“I know that.” And he did. Sort of.
“I’m fine, sir,” he said. He looked around the room, for some reason incapable of meeting Proudfoot’s eyes.
Draco just managed to slip out of Harry’s bed before the eighth-year Gryffindors returned to their dormitory. It was a painful separation, Harry nearly refusing to allow him to leave. He grasped Draco’s hand one last time, kissing his palm and then every one of his fingers, until Draco, laughing, managed to pull away. In the days that followed, they couldn’t stand to be apart. He almost couldn’t bring himself to care if people stared—they walked each other to their respective classes, dawdling in the corridors until the very last second; one night, at dinner, Harry strode over to the Slytherin table and sat himself right across from Draco. They discussed Thursday’s study session, keeping their expressions as neutral as possible, but Draco nearly slipped when he felt Harry’s foot brush against his.
“I can’t believe you’re taking their side,” Pritchard said coldly. “Everyone was right about you.”
“I’ll ask Hermione again,” Harry said, a doubtful look on his face. “We can skip tonight, if you want. Give you a break.”
“Oh, Draco, you’re so boring when you’re obtuse,” he drawled. “Lately you’ve been all ‘Harry this,’ ‘Harry that.’ I see you looking at each other during meals. In Potions, you were practically best mates. Weasley was furious,” he added, smirking. “So well done there.”
“I forgot you might be…bothered.”
Draco winced, trying to think of some way to signal his discomfort to her.
“Oh, yes, what a grand idea,” she said moodily. “We’ll strangle each other before we even make it there.”
Draco was nearly asleep in the large four-poster bed when Harry finally burst through the door. The room was dark, the fire in the grate having burned down to embers, but he recognized Harry right away as he strode towards the bed. He made to sit up, but Harry immediately covered his body with his, holding his face so that he could examine him from all angles.
“And? We’re of age, now. It’s ridiculous that we still have a curfew. I heard most of the teachers aren’t even enforcing it,” said Nott.
He jumped when Harry said, “How do you feel?”
“Oh, God. Her and Thomas. Was it awful?”
“Alone? Sorry,” he said to Daphne.
“I want you to listen to me.” Harry’s voice was hardly more than a whisper. “I am going to wipe away every last mark of him on you. Do you understand me?” Rendered mute, Draco could only nod. “And then you are going to forget about him. About how he touched you. We are both going to forget. And you are going to be mine.”
“Nobody ever taught me.”
“That’s enough for today,” she said. “I expect a full two feet of parchment on trans-species Transfiguration.” As they groaned, she spoke over them: “For those of you who have been successful, please transfigure your mouse back into a toad and bring it up to the front here.”
“So…” Harry’s face grew serious. “Now what?”
“You’re all meant to be my friends,” she whispered.
Potter shook his head but said nothing. He was still gripping Draco’s hips, their chests pressed together. Draco swore he could hear Potter’s heart beating in tandem with his. He felt a burning need to commit everything to memory: Potter’s bright green eyes, his jet-black hair, his parted, pink lips. His white uniform shirt, with the top three buttons undone; his tie, hanging loosely. As he looked down at Potter, it suddenly occurred to him how reckless he was being: alone, with Potter, snogging him. Surely Potter had lost his mind. He would be expelled for this, or worst. And if his parents found out…
“Why?” Theo asked. “You don’t think she’ll like this?” He held up a thick tome.
” Rounding on Draco, she said fiercely, “I’m sure you know what happened to my mother, of course.”
“But I won’t erase it. I won’t.”
They nodded in agreement. Gesturing to the four firewhiskies already on the table, Theo said, “I thought I’d get us started.”
“Why is she angry?”
“What? Haven’t you heard?” Blaise smirked at him. “They’re patient and hardworking. In
“They’re from that man she’s dating,” Blaise said as he rummaged through the box of chocolates. “It’s so annoying, how she tells them what I like.”
me. It comes up before I can even think about it.”
“You…” Harry abruptly rose to his feet and started pacing. “And you’re sure this Portkey will work?”
and he was so warm, so firm under Draco’s hands. He thought Potter might be able to help him forget all of the worries perpetually brewing in his head, the dread that haunted him like a shadow whenever he woke up, the flashbacks he couldn’t seem to shake. But then reality hit him and he shook his head.
“Who’s it from?” Pansy asked absently.
“I know,” Harry said evenly.
“No.” At the exasperated look on Harry’s face, he said, “I’d rather snog Weasley than see a Healer for my
“It was a last-minute thing. I know it’s a lot. But please trust me.”
Harry startled as a palm came to rest on his back, running along the curve of his spine. “And you were at lunch with your friends. How was it? Tell me.”
She paused for a moment, appraising them, and Draco thought to himself that her accent was not as strong as he remembered. Perhaps that had come from being married to one of the older Weasleys. “Well,” she went on, “we have much to do. I hear your seventh year was interrupted. Understandably.” She picked up a piece of chalk and began to write various spells onto the chalkboard. “We shall go through each one by one and see which you are familiar with. If you know none of them, do not be shy—tell me. If we must start at ze beginning, we start at ze beginning.”
referred to Proudfoot in passing, but always in relation to the Ministry. “Not really. I can’t remember.”
Draco felt very much like the cat that got the cream. Grinning to himself, he pushed on Harry’s shoulders so that they came face-to-face. “So this is your first time.”
“Don’t you bring him up,” Draco warned her. “You can tell he still believes in all of it.”
“Lav’s fine,” Theo laughed. “She can handle herself. How’s Hogwarts?”
Draco turned his head to the side, absolutely refusing. If he looked, he would be undone. The edges of his sanity were already fraying as it was; he needed to keep
Draco quickly spotted Callidus up in the rafters: he dwarfed the barn owls around him. As he sat in one of the windows, Callidus fluttered down to perch closer to him.
Draco and Harry were late to their Thursday study session. They bumped into each other on the way to the Great Hall, and Draco gave a perfunctory show of resisting before allowing Harry to pull him into an empty classroom. Pinning him against the wall, Harry kissed him so hard that Draco wondered faintly whether he was trying to stop him from breathing ever again. When they finally broke apart, their lips swollen, their faces flush, Draco made to reach for Harry again when they remembered the study group. They pulled themselves together as best they could before rushing to the Great Hall, sharing an amused look as they realized that they were the last to arrive. Pansy, Draco noticed, wasn’t there. They hadn’t spoken since their argument. Draco told himself that he didn’t care.
“I’m helping you because I want to,” Harry said softly. “I thought you knew. And you need to forgive yourself. Because I forgave you ages ago.”
There was a loud
“You go ahead,” Draco said, disentangling his arm from hers. “I’ll come in a bit.”
“I know Grimmauld Place,” Draco said. “I’ve never been—I don’t think anyone could get in, when Sirius was in Azkaban—but I’ve heard of it. It belonged to my Great-Aunt Walburga.”
“Great,” he said. He didn’t know what to feel, and so he felt nothing. “That’s really great.”
“With your Mark. I told her what’s been happening.” When Draco frowned, he said quickly, “I didn’t tell her everything. I just said you have a memory you don’t want to erase.”
A strange, hollow feeling overtook him. He felt numb as he pulled the thin sheet over himself and waited for Potter to leave. Because he always did eventually leave.
“What do you mean, no?”
“Mmm.”
And yet Potter hadn’t been laughing. He had looked…intense, serious. Draco rubbed his face, exhausted. And what Potter had been saying before, about the dread, the nightmares, the anxiety...it should have been reassuring that someone else felt the same, but instead Draco was sick to his stomach. He didn’t want to talk about it. He didn’t want to hear about it. He wanted to cast those feelings aside until they went away. He had to go back to normal at some point, didn’t he? It was a cruel form of torture, having to listen to someone else describe the suffocating terror. Draco resolved to avoid Potter from now on. There was, of course, the unfortunate matter of the study groups they were forced to lead together. But in those instances, they were around dozens of other students—surely Potter wouldn’t bother him there. He would go in, do what he needed to do, and get out. He only had to survive until the end of the year.
“Oh, would you quit it?” Her tone was brusque, but there was a little smile on her face as she turned her chair to face him properly. “It’s so strange when you get weepy.”
“Yes, yes,” he snapped. He knew he shouldn’t push his luck, but he was so desperate for Draco’s cock in his mouth that he couldn’t stand it anymore.
“Yeah.” He tried to shake off the tension in his shoulders, but he couldn’t.
and found the small velvet pouch.
“We’re barely into the first term. There’s loads of time before N.E.W.T.s.”
“It’s after midnight,” Harry said. He was patting her head. “I’m sorry, we were trying to be quiet.”
Flitwick had them working on charms to alter texts. Tucked away in the back of the classroom, Draco and Pansy were pouring over her copy of
Draco looked over and saw that Weasley was crouched down next to Harry, frowning. That was strange, he decided. And Granger was on his other side, face full of concern. That, perhaps, was even stranger.
“Of course Kreacher recognized Master’s voice.” The old house-elf drew himself up with pride as he spoke.
Harry hesitated. Neither of them wanted to do this. But it needed to be done.
Draco was uncomfortable. He had no idea why Potter was suddenly so talkative. “It’s just…it’s like when there’s something on the tip of your tongue. And the harder you try to remember, the faster it just…it just sort of…”
“Have you read the whole recipe?” Draco asked. “The brewing process is awful. You have to take it on and off the heat a few times…stir it one way, then the other…let it sit for exactly thirteen minutes…it’s a massive pain in the arse.”
They watched as Potter opened his gifts. He received an old watch from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, a Sneakoscope from Granger, and, from the Weasley twins, an enormous box of merchandise stamped with the name
He chuckled. “We’ll manage.”
“He’s got an injury, hasn’t he?” Blaise asked.
“Well, how was I supposed to know!” Draco said, affronted. He drew his cloak tighter around himself and pushed on down the path—the wind had picked up. “This is so stupid.”
“Your parents send you sweets all the time!”
Draco was sorely tempted to avoid Pansy and Blaise—he considered walking to Hogsmeade, or hiding in the library, or perhaps finding an empty classroom where they wouldn’t disturb him. But he had learned by now that it was best to confront these things directly. The longer Pansy had to stew, the more fanciful her conjectures would become. And so he braced himself and headed back to the castle, where lunch was being served in the Great Hall. Just as he had expected, his friends had their heads together at the end of the Slytherin table, speaking in hushed voices over their servings of scouse. When Draco sat down next to Pansy, she looked up at him in surprise.
As November dragged to an end, the other eighth-year Slytherins seemed fixated on making his life as miserable as possible. Out of nowhere, they had gotten it into their heads to spend an evening on the Quidditch pitch, never mind that it was well below freezing. They refused to go without Draco, although he didn’t see why. He knew that he was being sullen and moody; it wasn’t as though his presence added anything to the atmosphere. But Daphne insisted that he join them, and so one Friday evening he finally relented, if only to stop their nagging. As they traipsed down to the pitch, their freshly-cast Warming Charms producing a veritable bubble of heat around them, Draco listened quietly while the others debated whether the Firebolt’s successor might be released soon. By the time they arrived at the pitch, the sun had almost completely set.
“Your old wand, the trouble you had with it. I told you I’d ask Hermione, remember?” Harry pushed the bundle of parchments into his fist—there had to be at least five pages. How could he stand to read such long letters? Shaking his head in amazement, Draco turned to the paragraph Harry was pointing at.
“Malfoy.”
“But what would an Acromantula be doing near Hogwarts?” Patil laughed. “You’re drunk. You’re completely wasted!”
“Yeah.” Extremely uncomfortable, he shifted in his seat, eyes glued to his textbook. He still couldn’t push the image of his mother’s terrified face out of his mind. He remembered clearly how she had looked at him, begging him to join her, to escape with her. Mercifully, at that moment Babbling announced the end of class and reminded them to complete their assignment for next week.
“How do you get to the Ministry?” Draco demanded.
Proudfoot chuckled. “Would you relax, boy? You’re not in any sort of trouble, and I’m in no mood to scold you. I’m only trying to understand.” While Draco kept his eyes trained on the lake, watching as the water lapped up violently on the cliffs in the distance, he felt Proudfoot staring at him. “So explain to me, then, everything you’ve been through. Help me understand.”
“It’s not about
“Hi,” Potter said softly.
“I don’t think there’s anything else we can do,” Granger said. “I’ll check the library again. But there are so few sources…and they take ages to translate.” She hesitated, and then called, “Er—Draco?”
“Smart bird, isn’t he?” Pansy said, shading her eyes to watch as the enormous owl fluttered up to the West Tower.
“Look, how about this? I’ll come with you. We’ll go to Pomfrey together, and get you an appointment, and I’ll schedule mine for the same day. I could use a check-in. And then I can take you out for lunch or something.”
“I know that.” She frowned at him, offended. “But it still seems rude not to tell him. What if his feelings are hurt?”
“Ever the eager teacher, aren’t you, Potter? I’m just so relieved we have your vast experience from leading Dumbledore’s Army.” Pansy sniggered.
“Who? Potter? Ah…yeah. I guess.” Avoiding her eyes, Draco looked out at the grounds. Already, the trees were changing: the giant oaks had turned the most brilliant shades of orange, red, and yellow, the pines had begun their gradual shift to a darker green, and the birches were ornamented with strips of peeling bark. In his mind, autumn always meant the start of a new school year. It would be very odd, next year, not boarding the Hogwarts Express come September.
Draco rested his head back on the sofa, sighing. “I don’t know, Harry. I don’t know what they know and don’t know.”
Harry began to trail his fingertips up and down Draco’s arm. “I don’t want to push you.”
“This isn’t a joke,” Draco hissed. “Dumbledore gave us one job. One bloody job. How is it going to look when you can’t even keep me out for more than a few minutes?”
“Er…I probably shouldn’t say. It’s supposed to be private. But the point is…she offered to make appointments for everyone. So I just figured…er…”
“I have no idea who started it, sir, or who was telling the truth.”
“You think they’ll be angry?”
Something within Draco snapped. That word. He recoiled, almost physically, at the sound of that word. He swore it made his Mark pulse. Urging himself not to grab it again, he took a deep breath. “Yeah,” he mumbled, shifting uncomfortably on his pillow. He didn’t know what else to say.
me with this.”
Harry seemed nearly as nervous as he felt. Somehow, they both knew what was about to happen. They were silent as Draco crawled onto the blue and bronze blanket.
For a tense moment, Proudfoot said nothing. Finally, he lowered his wand. “I know what you think of your father, Draco.” He bristled at the sound of his first name. “But you’re condemning him to a fate worst than death. You’re better than this. Think of your mother—she doesn’t want this on your conscience.”
” Potter yelped. He dropped the textbook he had been holding with a loud
“Don’t be like that,” Harry reasoned. “It’s Christmas. Let’s go, just for a bit. You’ll have fun.”
Draco thought they might never escape. Kreacher insisted that Harry visit again soon and that he bring Draco with him; Winky gave Harry another hug, gripping his waist until he gently pried her off. Finally, they slipped out, Harry closing the door behind them. Draco was both very full and very happy—a rush of excitement passed through him at the thought that Harry had once again invited him into his life. They walked up to the entrance hall in silence. At the foot of the marble staircase, Harry turned towards Draco. He had a lopsided smile on his face.
Pansy whispered furiously, “You didn’t just
“It’s usually easy! You just make a bunch of stuff up. Every week I tell her I’m either going to meet my soulmate or suffer some horrible injury…she loves it.” Pansy flicked through the pages. “What was it again? The Two of Cups?” As she flipped through the book, she muttered, “Two of Cups…Two of Cups…Here. Partnership, unions, romance, sexual energy…the power created when two forces come together…look for connections in your life…creating a world between just the two of you…a physical and soul connection.” She looked up at him. “That’s about it.”
“Your presents!” Pansy suddenly shrieked. “Come on, let’s go to the kitchen, your presents are in there.”
Harry chuckled. “Yeah. It’s nice, though, spending time together outside the forest.”
“The Portkey? What about it?”
you. Force you out of the common room—in your pyjamas! Anyone could have seen.”
Draco forced himself to take a deep, steadying breath. This was ridiculous. “I don’t know. Daphne asked me to come. She’s started seeing Dean Thomas…and she wanted me there, in case the others…” He shook his head.
Draco blinked at Harry. Finally, he said, “Your Healer told you that?”
“I thought we were supposed to be branching out, making new friends. Inter-house unity and all that rubbish.” Draco held up a round, golden chocolate. “What’s this one?”
He’d never seen the boy appear so stoic. Cold. Hardened.
“No, you idiot! It’s a fact! You are going to get hurt if you don’t get the fuck out of here and it’s no one’s fault but your own!”
Remus couldn’t help but chuckle, interrupted for the better, as he nodded a silent thank you before cracking open his butterbeer.
“I know.” She pulled him into a warm embrace. “And you won’t. We’ll continue to be friends like we always have been.”
Dumbledore contemplated for a silent moment, glancing between the two as he fingered his floor length beard.
“He was eavesdropping on us. Why else would he stalk us, unless he thought we were up to something? And we did... say things... didn’t we? Things that could be self-incriminating?”
He lowered his head before responding. “Imagine if I won, Zabini. I could use it...” His eyes were solemn but almost hopeful. Like liquid luck was the answer to all of his problems.
Harry had lost consciousness before, and he remembered it being dark. Like the cupboard under the stairs in the middle of the night, or an eerie dusk during a new moon. But this time, all of the usual sensations were accompanied by the most vivid, brilliant light. He felt himself hit the ground, and time slowed indefinitely.
It was as if they’d never left. Every minute detail was as it had been the previous night, just like Dumbledore promised. They were thrust in the center of a frozen scene; it was as if time ceased to exist altogether.
The thought was there, and Harry had a sneaking suspicion that it wasn’t going anywhere. A seed planted within Draco’s subconscious that needed tending to.
When the couple on the show kissed, apparently Harry thought they should, too. His lips were soft, and pleading, and everything Draco wanted to spend the rest of his life standing for.
“I don’t either,” he stated quietly, sliding his fork against his plate in a mindless manner.
“Reinervate.”
There was a slight pull on his navel, as if he was being thrown across another dimension. A dizzying whirl that had Draco grabbing a fistful of his robes with his free hand. And then...nothing. There was a sensation of something flat beneath his feet, and he peeked an eye open hesitantly to view the familiarity of the Headmaster’s office.
Harry turned to face his former nemesis, and the contemplative expression he wore all but melted the remaining tendrils of his belly knot.
But what if there was something to break the cycle?
“He doesn’t deserve to practice magic. And neither do you...” He paused, giving the redhead a thorough once over from head to toe. “...Mudblood.”
Harry nodded. There were a lot of unknowns, but that much seemed clear. Sirius Black was head over heels for Remus Lupin.
Harry started as Draco’s form eventually faded into the background. The lights dimmed, and suddenly the fire place roared with startling green flames. He planted his feet as he settled in for the ride of a morphing memory.
Another laugh. “Still holding on, huh? Let me put it this way, Draco. Give in to me, allow me to take full control of your mind, or you will never leave.”
“After the last full moon, we finally finished it. At James’s house. We did it.” His smile was eccentric and wild and beamed proudly.
“Yes, Padfoot. I wouldn’t dare dream of having this any other way.”
They clenched their eyes shut once more, focusing with all of their might on becoming animagi. On transferring every bone, every organ, every piece of flesh to their animal form, whatever it may be. On complete surrender.
“Alright, Zabini. Which will it be? Truth or Dare?”
He didn’t even try to avoid it; instead, he sat down as the rain began to pound harder. It drenched his hair, his shirt, Even his shoes and socks. He was miserable.
“Amazing.” Harry finished, and it was the most honest thing he’d ever stated or felt. Draco chuckled between breaths, a genuine grin bearing his teeth.
“Crucio.”
“Remus, why are you such a pessimist?”
Voldemort’s expression was crudely inhuman, a snake waiting for the perfect chance to consume its prey.
He pulled him into an embrace, tears coating dusty cheeks.
“Ah, normally, I would agree with you. But can’t you see? Lord Voldemort has power beyond your deepest imagination. He will only truly live when you die. And I am here to further that cause.”
Albus Dumbledore, in all of his omnipotence, smiled softly. “Mr. Malfoy, Dare I Say that I am very proud of the young man you have become. Now, if the both of you will take my hand...”
She was immediately caught giggling and swaying back and forth. What truly let down her facade, however, was the next moment in which she turned and hurled right in the middle of the foyer.
James and Lily lowered their wands, gobsmacked.
Draco is a master at magic- or so he deems himself- so the fact that he hasn’t been able to conquer the patronus charm is more than aggravating. That’s what led him to finally give into Potter’s incessant requests that they practice together. He’d rudely barged in on him one day in the Room of Requirement, and at the sight of the faint, flicker of a white wisp that exited Draco’s wand, the secret had been discovered.
Sirius smiled softly, a hint of relaxed humor playing at his features. When he opened his eyes, they held something they’d never held quite like it before.
“Wait, Malfoy- you’re- you’re hurt.”
Harry held his breath, wondering what thoughts were flirting through Draco’s mind.
Only Harry seemed to notice the sheen of sweat on the back of his neck as he answered with feigned confidence.
“Fine, Potter. I’ll come. But not because you’re he Chosen One or anything. I just want to get out of here as fast as possible. That’s all.”
He didn’t want to follow the Dark Lord. He didn’t want to be a pawn in someone else’s game. He wanted to make his own decisions, and yet... that had already been stolen from him.
Suddenly, a pillow was thrown in his direction. He dodged it with a grin before resuming his post atop of Remus.
“I dont know. I mean, I guess he’d have to be... right? I...I hope so.”
Lucius Malfoy’s intentions were far from pure. They were downright bloody.
“But how did you-“ Harry blurted, and Pansy eyed him humorously.
It sounded like a promise, so Remus nodded.
“Yeah, I figured since were friends now, I should call you by your first name.”
When Remus continued to stare dumbfounded, he jumped up and placed a paw on each of his shoulders before licking both cheeks repeatedly.
There were slight changes between them, like sharing a bed and kisses in between apparating. But for the most part, things for the two boys remained happily the same.
“I just can’t believe that he’s gone. I mean, I knew what he was doing- I’ve known of the Dark Lord’s return for a while now. But the fact that the ministry sent my father... to Azkaban... all because of fucking Potter...”
Draco couldn’t help but laugh as Pansy smirked. What a friendship they shared.
Remus tilted his head. “A surprise? For me? Please tell me there’s chocolate involved.”
And, suddenly, as a bolt of lighting lit up the sky... Draco was crying. There was thunder, and wind, and he was soaked to the bone... and he sobbed. Because he wasn’t good enough. Because Harry deserved better. Because this time, what if he really had ended it all?
Harry’s lips are soft against his own.
Both were standing stupidly behind the couple, trying to lean in and eavesdrop a quite possibly private conversation.
Harry felt his own body melt into every curve and bend of Draco’s, and it was as if they were more alone than they’d ever been before.
“As I’ll ever be, darling.”
Harry studied three teens, scratch that, young adults, with his own proud grin as the edges of Malfoy’s bedroom ran blurry. He beamed at the secret, the unknown that he never would’ve predicted had he just not witnessed it with his own eyes. Team Free Will, albeit their intentions, supported him.
A whirlwind of colors led Harry to the Gryffindor common room. It was a Saturday, and he was perched on the couch next to Ginny. Harry slid a forced arm around her, an expected gesture for their ongoing relationship.
“It’s probably my fault.” Harry shrugs. “Too much peppermint, maybe?”
“Oh my God, Hermione, Nagini is-“
Harry felt his breath catch as the fingers loosened, letting go as the world settled into a balance.
Draco was frozen beside him.
Blaise chuckled. “We have a name now? Hey, at least rumor has it that Umbridge won’t be returning when the school year starts again. Team Free Will is in strict violation of educational decree number sixty eight.”
And this confused Harry, but he couldn’t make sense of it. Not through the pain...
“You are my world, Draco. Even when you’re trapped and lash out. Even when you think I’m your father, and you start to panic. Even when you convince yourself that I’m cheating on you, though I’d die before that happened.” He took Draco’s hands, clasping them as the rain poured down.
“God, Malfoy, just shut up and be patient.”
“Oh. Yeah.” Harry taps the vial precisely three times, and the potion morphs into the color of sage. He’s distracted by the sharp pierce of Malfoy’s stare.
His voice trailed off, along with his gaze, and Harry and Draco peered at each other with confused but grateful eyes.
He was genuinely curious.
“Are you hurt? We came as fast as we could.” Her brow was creased, not a hundred percent satisfied of his wellbeing.
When Draco’s lease on his London apartment is near its end, Harry finds him with a nervous twitch of his lips.
On the far left was a shorter, plump fellow that Harry didn’t have to think twice before labeling as Peter Pettigrew. The only thing that kept his blood from boiling at the sight of the traitor himself was the person next to him. James Potter was flipping through a quidditch book, nonchalantly biting the end of his quill in between circling strategies for his next match. It was all-consuming, getting to watch him father in a state so casual, a side he’d never had the pleasure of viewing.
Remus was pinning down Regulus, whether he’d intended to or not.
“What the hell were you guys thinking!? Turning into...” he lowered his voice- “animagi!? How did you even do it? Don’t you guys know it’s illegal? Of course you do!” James and Peter shifted subtly, waiting for Remus to calm down. Sirius was doing his best to stifle a laugh.
“First of all, I’m sure that’s what your last one night stand said about you, Sirius.”
And Draco sobs, without really knowing how to stop, and Harry’s skin is warm against his own. It’s the first time he’s ever really felt whole.
“That’s what you do for the people you care about.”
Beside himself, Draco cursed the Healer with everything inside him as he watched his white coat trail through the doorway.
P.s. I’M SUCH A SAP FOR HAPPY ENDINGS
“I don’t-“ Harry started, but all at once the lights seemed to shine, illuminating their surroundings vibrantly. He blinked once, then twice as his eyes adjusted.
Shuffled around them were several younger Slytherins that Draco and Harry didn’t recognize. The Marauders were outnumbered, to say the least.
Sleeping softly, head nestled against his chest, was Draco Malfoy. His breath was a gentle tickle through his shirt, leaving a trail of goosebumps beneath the fabric. He was also... drooling, a bit, and Harry caught his own lips tugging upward at the sight.
He wanted him to know just how loved he was.
Sirius relaxed back down before Remus breathed out a sigh.
“I’m afraid not. If he were dead, we wouldn’t still be standing here, now would we?”
The fingertips were soft, and warm, and he found himself not minding one bit that Malfoy was using him to steady himself. Even if that’s all it was.
“I hope you both enjoyed the rather late breakfast that was served this morning. I do apologize, those house elves, they’re always so punctual, but something I’m afraid must’ve come over them...”
“I don’t know, um- Hermione used a time turner in third year, and we were able to alter stuff with that- there’s got to be a way to change the memory!”
James flashed him an award-winning grin.
Voldemort’s smug grin had melted into confusion and shock as he turned to view damage.
Stabbing pain shot through the back of his legs, a burning curse sent along the course of each popliteal artery. He fought against it, he gritted his teeth with sudden veracity, only barely shaking the boy in his arms...
“Come on, let’s not let Peter start eating himself.” Remus stood, extending a hand to help Sirius lift upward.
The morphing of three unregistered animagi as Remus emerged in wolf form snapped him from his reverie.
Draco couldn’t speak; he couldn’t fucking think. His heart hammered against his ribs, an intense counterpart to the elation that still filled his belly whole. He settled on a nod, a quick jerk of his head born of nerves and necessity.
Harry chuckled at his facetiousness. “Isn’t it nice, Draco?” He pulled back, locking eyes softly. “Where we are in life. No more Voldemort. No more monsters or inner demons. You defeated yours when you faced your father. I conquered mine when Voldemort shot the killing curse at me in the forest. That was years ago. Now, We’ve got a beautiful flat together. You own your own potions shop. And I actually got to stand at the altar and call you mine.”
“So, everyone, sit back, enjoy the refreshments, and try to keep your hands off me because I’m soon to be married man!” Chortles rang throughout the crowd, and Sirius took his opportunity to cat call.
“Lucius.” Peter shuffled nervously, glancing from his feet to the Slytherin.
Where in the hell was he? Was this some sort of... torcher chamber that belonged to Voldemort?
“I don’t know. All I know is that they know about me. And I’m trying to enjoy my last- however long it’s going to be- here, with you, but I just...”
On the floor sat a very distraught Draco Malfoy, head buried beneath crossed arms that pulled his knees taut against chest. His back seemed to rise and fall rhythmically, but what gave him away immediately was the soft and broken noise of his voice cracking into a sob.
“Draco!” He called, breaking his attention from the depraved man in front of him. “Let’s go!”
It was Lord Voldemort himself, eyeing him hungrily behind crimson pupils.
“I most certainly have NOT- thought about it-“ He winced as he fought to continue his argument, but his face was bright red and Harry had a nagging suspicion that it wasn’t from his swollen jaw.
Harry must’ve looked as stupid as he felt, because he straightened before continuing.
A laugh from James, who was jittery with excitement. “We’ve brought you here to this party to celebrate something. And that something is my engagement to the beautiful Ms. Lily Evans!”
“Wasn’t expecting to see you here, Potter.”
He stood by Dumbledore. He stood by Harry. He stood by... by Draco.
This didn’t make any goddamn sense. None of it did. His body was reactionary, and he swore he didn’t tell himself to rest his cheek against Potter’s messy mop, to breathe in the scent of his hair and revel in how unexpectedly clean it was.
When Remus Lupin was sorted into Gryffindor, Harry caught himself clapping with the crowd. He wasn’t sure why Dumbledore was revealing these memories to them, or why on earth they would need to be organized, but he didn’t care. This reality was a heavenly reprieve from the one he and Malfoy were currently residing in. He’d spend as much time as he was allowed here in detention.
“Draco, Harry. I have come to bring you back to Hogwarts. I’m afraid that something horrible had happened.”
“Hey, dickwads, dinner’s ready, and Peter can’t control himself around food!”
In one corner, a slightly perturbed Lily Evans was propped against the wall with a book in hand. She’d obviously been mid-sentence when a very smug James Potter interrupted her.
And in the midst of it all, he saw a single face:  blonde tendrils falling against sharp cheek bones. They were pulled taut from the large smile that he wore, and it was beautiful. Absolutely stunning.
But, no, Harry whispers, this is more important. You are more important. When had their relationship morphed into this... whatever this is?
But Lucius Malfoy, or this version of him anyway, stood frozen and unaffected by his outburst.
Another laugh.
“No, Snivellus, Relax. We were... hanging out? Remember?”
The striking thing about it was that they were floating. The ingredients to his “potion” floated about an inch above the bowl, and Harry wondered if the boy was a wizard like himself. He was far too young to channel his power, but perhaps it was one of those odd things that happened to magical children. Like the time that Harry’s hair kept growing back every time Aunt Petunia would cut it, or even the vanishing glass at the zoo.
The only thing worse than being against our Dark Lord is pretending not to be. You aren’t worthy of the task he’s given to you.  Do you know what I would’ve done had he bestowed such an honor upon me?!”
“They don’t know, Rem. They think they know something. They don’t fucking know anything. I won’t let them know anything.”
“Better than me?”
The first thing he saw were piercing silver eyes held flush with his own. Why had he never noticed how stunning he was?
The expression on Lucius Malfoy’s face was both shocked and disgusted.
A small eternity passed, and Draco stepped forward. His eyes held something hopeful, like he’d anticipated this moment for quite some time. Harry swallowed, a hard knot sliding down the back of his throat.
“But I don’t want anyone but you. Not now, not ever. I don’t want rational. I want insane. I want to stand out here screaming at you in the goddamned rain. I want-“
“Don’t be jealous, Pete. Well come up with something for you. You kinda remind me of a worm.”
“Now, Draco, remember what we talked about. No funny business tonight. Your father will be very upset if you embarrass him.” The voice belonged to Narcissa Malfoy, and she scooped to one knee to adjust her son’s collar. She paused, meeting eyes with him and sighing before she stood.
“Uh, no... no fourth years...”
Draco smiled softly at the sentiment. Harry, following a bit of courage, draped an arm around his waist.
The crisp night air was clear; the sky was a royal blue painted with stars. Harry immediately became entranced by it and headed to the rail for a better look.
His hair was jet black, slicked back so that not a single hair was out of place. He brought himself closer to Lupin, his shadow towering over him though he was clearly younger.
Harry remained fixed to the floor, unable to follow.
All of this happened before Regulus Black was tackled to the ground.
And then, a miracle happened.
“Regulus Black.” Harry stated, eyes glued ahead.
“Guys, We did it! Remus will be so mad at us! But then he’ll be proud! And Happy!”
And then, she spoke. “I’m going to get something to drink.”
There was no pulling out of this spell, no manipulation tactics that could break the hold on his limbs. Draco Malfoy had- against all odds- overpowered his father. His face held a mixture of exasperation and disbelief, feeling drained and yet the most alive he’d ever been.
“Besides, we all know how you get around Potter. He throws you off your game.” She giggled, and Blaise shook his head as if to visibly state “I’m staying out of this.”
“Sirius, why don’t you shut the fuck up and go bother someone else?” He’d clearly hit a nerve with his little brother, who was all but red with frustration. His cool facade was quickly crumbling.
Suddenly, everything froze. There it was, dancing on Malfoy’s lips like the damn lottery. A smile.
No, he refused to believe that the Draco he so desperately sought after was the boy running cowardly from the restricted section. And suddenly another emotion entirely flooded through Harry’s being:  anger.
He was completely floored when, instead, he heard voices that increasingly became more clear.
“So do you, Moony. You deserve the world.”
“Yes, darling, we did. And that’s the point.” Pansy crossed her arms and rolled her eyes, exasperated.
“I’m listening,” Pansy raised her brows with a smirk, folding her arms.
Harry had held onto his confusion until something about this moment unraveled him. Perhaps it was the phrasing: “Cursed objects that Kill,” on the head of the page. Or maybe it was the fact that Draco ripped this entry out, folding it and hastily shoving it in his robes. Either way, Harry suddenly realized that Draco was backtracking on his decision to go against his father, and that there was no way that this memory was more than a few weeks old.
But that wasn’t going to happen. That couldn’t happen. Harry’s heart hammered at the prospect of what would become. Remus Lupin was alive and well outside of this memory so the killing curse would have little merit here.
The world began to vibrate, an earthquake against the plane of his own mind. A shelf toppled over. More memories, breaking on the floor.
Harry’s still lost in thought, finally snapping back to reality with the buzzing excitement of a new idea.
Peter sighed. “You’re welcome.”
Draco’s throat bobbed as he swallowed. This felt so right, so perfect, and as the butterflies swept through his veins he came to the sudden unsettling conclusion that this was far different than being held by your parents or close friends.
He passed shelves and shelves of glowing balls, a seemingly infinite sea beyond his measly figure. Each footstep forward was enough to shatter the quiet, resting uneasy against the pit in his stomach. He noticed himself breathing harder, though he wasn’t running and suddenly began to question his own sanity.
He’d stumbled into it before in his fourth year, fallen straight into a world made purely of memory.
Harry had no idea that Slytherins were close like Gryffindors. He knew they stuck together and formed cliques- but the friendship between Pansy and Draco wasn’t far from his own with Hermione. This both puzzled and delighted him unexpectedly. It was like he was peering into a world that only existed when he wasn’t around. It was an odd circumstance, and it left him feeling somewhat fuzzy. Probably because his window into the world of Draco Malfoy was only making him fall harder.
Harry was still floating, until he felt his feet  uncomfortably slam against the floor. He glanced around. It wasn’t dark, there were no happy memories playing like a movie for old time’s sake. Just rows and rows of shelves, all lined with crystal white orbs...
Harry caught himself gulping. He was ready to find out the truth, or to do his best to change it. But now that he and Draco approached the stone bowl, wisps of memories permeating the air above it, a shallow pit of fear was tugging at his abdomen.
He couldn’t help but notice the presence of two other children that seemed about Draco’s age arriving in similar attire.
All of a sudden, Sirius perked up.
And, perhaps most importantly, for the feeling that was evading all darkness within him.
“Merlin, did we just agree on something?”
“If I didn’t know any better,” she pressed, placing a hand on his knee. “I’d say that you too are both a couple of sexually frustrated morons who need to find reprieve with each other.”
“Because they’re mean. And they eat people.”
When Malfoy accused him of being gay, he all but snapped.
Blaise approached just then, joining their group as they all tried to piece together the night’s events.
He turned back to the gang. “You guys really should go. I appreciate all that you’ve done, I really do. But I don’t want to hurt any of you. I care about you too much.” His eyes were desperate, pleading.
“No, why?”
The tears continued to fall anyway, and he slid his back against the wall as he deescalated to the floor. Harry watched as Draco Malfoy sobbed, clearly cracking under the pressure. He’d need a plan, and he’d need it fast. And Harry wondered if he’d come up with one yet.
It appeared that they’d interrupted a Quidditch match.
When he blinked, the world had reconfigured into the Great Hall. Judging by the feast, it was breakfast time. There were a few straggler students, mostly Ravenclaws who’d arrived early to study before class. Alone and withdrawn at the Slytherin table sat Draco Malfoy, picking at his eggs.
“No, but you’ll think of something.” His voice was as gentle as the motion of each finger Remus continued to card through his hair.
“Malfoy, I think we used the right amount of peppermint oil.”
“Maybe we-“ Malfoy freezes, a sudden dawning transforming his cheeks to a rosy pink.
Beneath a shady oak tree sat Black, Potter, and Pettigrew. Potter was twirling a snitch between his fingers; Black was leaning lazily against the tree. Pettigrew was in his own world, appearing to study the puffy white clouds that dotted the sky.
“He loves him.” Draco declared softly, eyes still locked on Potter.
Draco’s patronus is a doe.
“Yeah, I guess so. What about you and Sirius?”
And then Weasley of all people admitted that he didn’t believe his own best friend, and Draco was fuming at the betrayal. Because he wouldn’t never done that to him. He would’ve been loyal through and through, from the second he took his hand on the train.
In the nick of time, the door opens to reveal Weasley and Granger, who immediately hurl spells at Draco’s childhood friends. The robotic henchmen that he’s realized were no more loyal to him than his own father. They were blind, the lot of them, sightlessly following orders from the Dark Lord. Draco dodges, protecting his face from the fallout. Magic sparks the air, and an urgency radiates between all parties as Crabbe’s flames begin to violently spread.
Regulus didn’t speak. The familiar voice of Severus Snape chimed in.
Sirius was smiling. And Remus felt his lips pull upward, too. It was one of those moments that seemed to last an eternity, unspoken words stretching timelessly between them.
“Are you questioning your loyalties?” Lucius Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
“Better than that time Snivellus felt my wrath in fourth year?”
Before him was the face of Sirius Black, partnered by none other than Remus Lupin. They were younger, likely a few years out of school. He was moving toward them, crawling. He wanted to see them, be held by them, to grab onto their attention and never let go.
“No! I won’t let you win!” Harry yelled passionately, unable to provide the means for his success but standing his ground regardless.
“Potter. Always telling others what to do. If I had it my way...”
“Well, if you don’t plan on telling me, I’ll figure it out one way or another.”
He straightened, and for a moment all was silent. The next word from his lips was the credit to all chaos:  “Fire.”
Draco winced, keeping his head forward. Harry followed as he coldly ascended the steps and emerged on the upper floor of Malfoy Manor.
Guilt swarmed his gut as Draco packed his things, readying himself for his next lesson wordlessly. His face held all that needed to be said. He was devastated.
Draco’s soft snoring sending hot breath across his skin and a shudder down his spine.
Draco’s eyes fly open as Harry presses their lips into a soft embrace. It’s as if kissing fucking Harry Potter causes more of a shock to his system than the venom coursing through his veins, and suddenly he’s wide awake.
His head hit the floor, eyelids sunken and heavy. He tried to hold on, but it was difficult, perhaps the hardest thing he’d done thus far...
On one side of the room was the Wolf, teeth bared and snarling in a fashion more violent than Harry had ever seen it. His hair stood up frighteningly along the back of his neck; he leaned forward in quick preparation to attack. It was like something straight from a horror movie.
“Preoccupied my arse, Severus!” Lily called passionately as she held her wand steady, and James couldn’t help but beam  at her decision to stand up to him. “You guys came here to hurt poor Remus! And you will all be punished!”
He annunciated each syllable through gritted teeth that bore the fight he was committing to. Beneath him, Harry felt a spark run through him. Like an electric shock that briefly reminded his organs to work.
Harry sighed. “I’m glad to hear that you think I deserve the freshest of linens, Draco.”
“Not now,” he stated icily, “I have very important business matters to attend to. Can’t you see that I’m busy?”
It began with Remus’s transformation. It was horrific, and heartbreaking, but Harry couldn’t look away as each bone in Remus Lupin’s body broke and re-formed into the wolf. His cries were wrenching, skin bleeding, teeth gnashing at what was probably the worst pain anyone could feel.
His gaze snaps up, and Harry’s smiling softly. The name seemed to roll from his tongue in an effortless and fateful manner.
“What is it with you and Potter? Like we get it, you don’t like each other, but why do you two always go out of your way to talk shit? It’s like you’re both obsessed with each other or something.”
It trickled beyond the bricks of the castle, shed light to the edge of the spiral staircase leading up to its tallest point. It also ever so softly landed on two boys who had most inconveniently overslept.
Harry laughs. “Why?”
Theo pulled away as soon as he was able to and stalked back to his spot.
“I’m going to need all of you to change back, please.” He said calmly, and in the next moment he was surrounded by his friends again.
Across from them sat James and Peter, each sipping on a butter beer and enjoying the event that was a Hogsmeade Saturday. Perched relaxedly in the Three Broomsticks, it appeared that nothing could ruin the sunshine that bled through the windows or the cool fall breeze outside.
With an unruly gust of wind, the fire died down to smoldering orange and black ashes. And Draco was alone.
“Looks like Potter got himself a hot date,” Pansy prodded, and Draco smirked.
Perhaps he just wanted this to be over with as much as Potter did.
Cursed. That was it. He’d been cursed by-
Sirius felt himself involuntarily smiling, and Remus followed with a soft chuckle.
His heart was thumping wildly against his ribs, ecstatic and fluttering as he neared what so thankfully appeared to be the very statuesque form of Draco Malfoy...
Harry directed his gaze from Draco to the pile of ash below him and knew that he had won. Whatever demons he’d harbored, darkness he’d entailed... it was all gone now. Now, he was free.
Not until the door is thrown open, and Harry’s there, sporting nothing but a pair of boxer shorts and a concerned purse of his lips.
“I-I don’t know. I just didn’t expect you to talk to me ever again, that’s all.”
“I knew it.” He smiled facetiously before tilting his face a bit more forward. Only a few inches remained between them now, and It suddenly became evident what was about to happen next.
“Isn’t that...illegal? And hard?” Peter asked anxiously, twiddling his fingers as he knew he was either going to get with the Marauders or get behind them.
He didn’t have to see the crimson of his eyes to know exactly who the shadow belonged to. Even in a memory, he felt something thick lodge itself in the back of his throat.
Drunk Harry didn’t care, and he had a feeling that sober Harry wouldn’t either. They separated with a grin before Draco took Harry’s hand and pulled them into a standing position.
At once, he stood tall, careful to stand near Harry protectively.
An odd and embarrassing memory, but one that came to a close with Harry smiling and Draco resting his head against his shoulder. For the moment, it seemed that everything was going to be alright.
He watched the trail of a liar as he escalated the steps to his bedroom. And he’d never respected him more.
“We’ve got this. I mean, we made it through the hardest part, right? Stealing those ingredients from Slughorn’s stash was a crime in itself.” Sirius winked, and Peter shuttered.
"Your stuff is our stuff," Hermione said, trying to meet his eyes from below, smiling in a wavering sort of way.
Hermione rolled his eyes. "You're overreacting. I doubt Malfoy has any wicked intentions. He hasn't been the Malfoy we know since seventh year."
"Hm." There is a brief pause. "And how will they be able to help me?"
"What if he wants to murder you and throw you into the lake?!" Ron exclaimed. Harry knew they both knew just how incapable Malfoy was of murder and violence of that degree, but he understood the sentiment. "If he does
"Oh, I've always wanted to go there!" Hermione said, a deeply wistful expression of her face as she glanced up at Draco, back down at the camera. "It's so beautiful."
"Pardon me, but you're not telling me anything I don't already know, Madam Aileen."
When it's hard to make sense of things, he goes to Hermione, and asks her without mentioning anybody, though she does give him a long, considering look before she answers with an affirmation that, yes, it is possible for one person to like both boys and girls, and yes, it is perfectly alright to, and yes, it's fine and normal to realise it at a very later age, and yes, it's still real if it's just one person when you've believed for most of your life that you only like people of one gender. She doesn't ask him anything, but Harry gets the strong feeling that he wasn't being as subtle as he thought he was by framing his questions in a hypothetical manner, and that she was only respecting his wishes to disclose anything in his own time.
"Malfoy
"Draco's okay right now. As okay as he can be, I suppose." For a moment they seemed carefully unsurprised, and Harry didn't understand why until he went back over what he said. He cleared his throat, looking down at his hands. "He won't even look at me."
*A dream memory:
Outside Harry's dorm, he draws the coat off his shoulders. When he holds it out, Draco takes it, draping it over his own arm with the elegance that is so effortlessly ingrained in his every movement.
Potter settles down beside him after a moment, pushing his nose over to Draco's hairline, murmuring, "And you're mine."
The cushioning charm on the floor of the Astronomy Tower is a bit of a relief, Potter's back wedged against the wall, but trying not to shift around too much under the Invisibility cloak lest if fall off doesn't help sleep come easy. Still, Potter's arms wound tight and warm around him settles the malaise around his heart, as if it's been pushed out of place and now finally fitting in its cavity. The things he doesn't want to think about, they fray at the edges of his mind, and he focuses instead on counting Potter's breaths, one inhale, one exhale. Inhale. Exhale.
Somewhere within, Harry has already wondered of everything Pansy's said, this repressed doubt and fear, but hasn't quite let it resurface this way, so clear to himself. Not until now. He whirls on his feet, not quite able to meet Draco's eyes, just needing air out of this house.
Narcissa was eying him, then smiled softly. "You're too good a man, Harry," she said, and it was genuine, before Draco had come and borrowed her for something. Harry let him have his time with her, moving away into a corner, accepting a drink from one of the servers. A little while after, somebody had come and asked for a dance from Narcissa, and a little while after that, Draco accepted a dance from a woman, black-haired and very conventionally beautiful. A name niggled at the back of Harry's mind, with that face, and he finally placed her as the younger Greengrass sister.
Prior to the start of their classes, Potter was telling Draco about the history of the infamous Marauders, ending on a note about his father and friends being unregistered animagi. The conversation promptly devolved into what animagi they themselves would be.
and saw it was seven. I got out of bed, and it's completely dark. I'm really confused in my half-asleep state, wondering why it's so dark at seven in the morning, right? And why the hell is the sky

"Oh no!" Ron exclaims, overdramatically. "I think he's really disappeared! Now we're really gone, Harry!"
Warnings: mentions of implied suicide attempt/ideation, depressive+dissociative responses, scarring, implications to past abuse, implied sexual content

"Give it a try, Harry," Ginny says, her hand taking a hold of his. "You don't talk to anyone about any of it. It could be good for you."
Narcissa touches his cheek, stroking it gently, smiles at him in forced reassurance. "It's nothing for you to worry about. I'm only not feeling well, that's all."
"Malfoy," Harry warned. He closed his eyes. "You don't actually care, do you?"
"I'm not looking to return to Hogwarts. Whatever her conditions, it is of no concern to me."
As he watched Malfoy watch the water, Harry felt the nausea in his gut again, that strange, inexplicable dread. Something wasn't right, but he couldn't…
"Then we'll handle it," Draco says. "I am
* * *
And there was his aunt Petunia.
"Sorry," Potter says, laughing awkwardly. "I didn't realise you guys were still doing wandless magic."
Draco wandlessly locks the door after, when they're too tired for any more. That's something Harry's been liking very much for a long while as well, whenever he sees him using his wandless magic. He watches him draw the curtains like that too, thinking of how he hadn't realised before that his enjoyment for wandless magic extended exclusively for Draco.
," Malfoy spoke over him, loudly. "What do we know about what such failure entails? Perhaps the lifespan becomes doubled instead! Perhaps we both die!"
Harry stood a little far behind him, hands pushed into his pockets. He looked at it for a moment, and then at Draco for the rest of it, at the shadowing of his cheekbones under a light above him, the silver of an eye framed by long lashes. He never quite understood what it meant to stay in the entirety of a moment, savour it, but he supposed it must be something like this, like watching Draco lose himself in paintings for ages.
"Are you really so desperate to be on a first name basis with me?" Draco asks. He has a half-amused smirk on his lips. Harry wouldn't call himself desperate, per se— "What was it you'd said in First Year when I asked for your friendship?"
"After you," Draco tells her.
fading, quieting softly into the kiss.
(See the end of the chapter for
He did finally give in at the end, sweaty and gasping and feverish, pulling at Harry as he trembled and put his forehead to his shoulder and let him touch him, Harry whispering soothing nonsense into his hairline,
That burning throb of an urge was back again in his chest, as it had many times before throughout the day, the one that kept trying to force his hands and his body into something imprudent and unwise. If nothing else, it would certainly wipe that fucking smirk off of Malfoy's face if he gave into it.
Draco
Malfoy, apparently, found some of them rather hysterical, laughing with a knuckle to the teeth of his grin.
"Three days. Mimi healed you." She had a deep frown, lining between her brows. She looks older than she is from her stressed features. "What happened to you?"
Maybe Draco noticed, maybe he didn't. The music faded off into a quiet finish, and at the end of it, he spread his arms, one hand around a bow and the other around the neck of the violin, and bowed in a sarcastic sort of curtsy. "I only accept praise," he said, smirking, and Harry laughed, somewhat fumbling in his drunken quickness, clapping his hands together. He was trying to affect a serious face and only barely passing.
"Harriet James, will you do me the honour of spending the rest of your life with me?"
Maybe it's just the sense of somebody being there. Maybe it's his words, something to focus on that isn't his own thoughts.
At the end of this, as they begin to walk towards their respective classes, Potter asks, mildly tentative, pulling the strap of his satchel higher on his shoulder. "See you at the Great Lake for lunch?"
From the row in front of him, Nott and Goyle fist-bumped.
And suddenly his stupor was broken by a very self-appeased Pansy Parkinson suggesting that they lock each other in a closet for seven minutes and see what happens. “It’s a muggle game! Hermione told me about it,” she chattered, and Harry noticed Hermione’s cheeks blushing the same way that Draco’s had. What the fuck?
“Listen here, Rem. Even if they know, which is impossible, because there’s no one who could’ve told them... you won’t go away. They can’t take you away. Dumbledore wouldn’t let them. I won’t let them.”
When the world settled, Draco recognized the setting immediately.
He pondered this, but found himself apathetic. It could be midnight for all he cared. He suddenly found himself wanting to be nowhere else. Stuck, alone with Malfoy in this alarmingly different but wholesome world.
“Guys, maybe we- maybe we should just go another way,” Peter chattered, slinking behind inconspicuously.
It was peaceful here, in a way, but there was something else he was supposed to be doing... a nagging sensation pulled at his gut, trying its damndest to remind him of something...
Draco watched Harry’s reflection enter their bedroom in the large, full body mirror before him.
“Just let me help you,” Potter insisted, and Draco had scoffed.
Until it wasn’t.
“Well, are you just going to stand there all day or are you going to view this memory with me so that we can get out of here?” Malfoy’s familiar scoff brought Harry back to reality, and he found himself groaning internally.
Harry melted, his organs somewhere on the floor of a memory. He’d never been told this before. He’d never felt this before. There were no words to describe the warmth that trickled from his head to his toes, threatening to pull him under a blanket of tranquility. A reactionary grin tugged at his face until his cheeks hurt from being pulled so tight.
“And then, Hermione thought about the Room and... well, here we are. I’m sorry we missed out on all the action.”
And yet, here they were. All because of...
He did like it. And it didn’t matter why. It turned out that Draco Malfoy wasn’t the person Harry had pegged him out to be; no, not at all. He was funny, and charming, and sympathetic. The idea tickled his stomach. He could’ve pondered on this, but in a fit of confusion and fear he chose to focus on the Marauders instead.
Draco doesn’t respond. He tells himself his hard swallow is the effect of the snake venom, but he knows it’s a lie. It’s always been.
He had to find Draco, so he could tell him. He just had to.
And he’d robbed it from him.
“Now. The memory charms have been successful to their intent. The only one who recalled any reason of how they got into the shack that night was Mr. Snape, and he has been sworn to silence. He remembers his own speculations, but no evidence remains in his psyche. The rest are convinced that that you all snuck out separately and ended up in the shack after you began quarreling. Can I trust that you will continue to protect Mr. Lupin’s secret to the best of your ability?”
They ate some more in even more silence. Nearly a half an hour passed, and Malfoy had only just finished his first bowl of soup.
The first time the bond had begun to act up for Harry alone, he'd thought Draco must have been experiencing it as well in the exact same way. He had stumbled into the kitchen whilst Draco was in the midst of his private classes, both he and his tutor staring at him for a confused, blank moment.
"I'm going to have to think about it," Harry told him.
. There were probably many reasons why Malfoy would do that, even if Harry knew none of them.
"He loves you," Hermione told him, grabbing his hand on the countertop, meeting his eyes sternly. "Bill
"I've been unkind again," Draco said, after a while, tearing his eyes away from his. "I just wanted to be angry at somebody."
Draco raises an eyebrow, a slight sneer on his face. "What do I like to eat?" he repeats flatly.
And then Harry can't see him anymore, somebody sliding up in front of Draco and blocking his view of him.
"Can I still say my speech?" Ron said, when they drew back, not entirely letting go. "I'm still going to say it. I've been practicing for
, but it would be too much, too fast, when Draco's only just come back.
"Do you get reminded of them?" Draco finds himself asking, almost mindlessly, already wishing he could take the words back from the air. "When you see me?"
Ginny understands, is kind and easy about it, and it only leaves him more ashamed. He walks away from her not knowing what to do with it, not knowing what to do.
Hermione was sitting with half of her back against Ron's chest, their hands tangled on his thigh. Ron's knee was touching his, a wordless comfort. His mouth squinched up at a corner, cleared his throat and looked away, like he didn't know what to say about it. None of them knew, it seemed. Harry knew this was all they had. Cutting down to five years was the most he could get, and it still felt like forever, more real and fathomable in a way that twenty years hadn't been.
It was easier not to before, with Potter's voice and company keeping him occupied. His chattering, drawing him back into reality, keeping him here. His silence, but the presence of him a vivid, painful awareness in the back of Draco's mind.
"Yeah," he says, finally giving that breath of a small, hesitant smile. He brings with him, like summer breezes, the memories of coin calls and sneaking in and out of dorms and arms around him under the rectangle of a doorway, lying together on the floor of towers under galaxies, dancing under stars, huddled together in alcoves. Soft kisses and warm laughter and wild, spontaneous dancing. "Yeah, I did."
Draco was easing himself to lie on his side. Harry put the tray of an empty plate aside on the night table, doing the same. He folded an arm around him, a hand at his spine.
it on my—"
And just like that, whatever moment of near civility they'd had was over. Harry rolled his eyes, annoyance taking precedence over his puzzlement. "Right, then." He had already turned around, opening the door.  "Whatever. I'm going to take a shower."
"Nice," Harry said dryly.
, and he is alive, and he is beautiful, looking at Harry very still with a small line between his brows, waiting for him to speak.  He is now more bemused by his silence than impatient, by whatever it is that Harry must look like right now.
Harry wanted to say, only it sounded like something Draco would only laugh at right now, call him a fool for. Only Harry didn't know anything about anything anymore, because he hadn't expected what had happened to happen, and everything was so off-kilter and out of his control and understanding that he felt like he was constantly caught in a freefall, not knowing where anything was going, what would happen to them, to Draco
The shards of sunlight drew over him, pouring through translucent white curtains, all over him. A feeling stirred in Harry's chest, a sort of ebb, a swell that blew out as quick as it came.
And then one day, there was a loud crash from the kitchen, shattering ceramic, an almost buried cry amidst them.
He was caught between staying, doing the one thing that could be keeping Malfoy's life in him, and seeking help from someone, anyone, that would know better than Harry.
The rest of it was rather uneventful. More talking. More drinking. Some food. Then they were all dancing in the centre of the great hall, all slow and formal and fancy. Harry had a dance with Narcissa, where she engaged him with polite small talk, smiled at him a lot as she spoke, charming and warm in a way he'd never seen her as in his school years. He was asking after her, telling her of what Draco had told him with all the gaps, and then had finally gotten the proper story which wasn't so far off from what he'd gathered.
"Well, we spent a lot of time together, during the—" Draco gestured, vaguely, as if finding it difficult to say. He cleared his throat. Harry nodded, as if to tell him to go on. "I would go down with food, some tarot cards and a chessboard. And we'd just play together, and talk for hours. Mostly, she would ask me all these questions that—that just broke down everything I had once believed, until I could no longer make sense of why I ever thought they were true." He paused, and then huffed slightly, sounding almost fond. "She knows how to make sense when she wants to."
"What are you—why—" Ron frowned even harder, gesturing confusedly at him. "Shirtless? Why in Malfoy's—"
"It's alright," Hermione said, smiling at him reassuringly and squeezing his arm. "It's alright, you know. You don't have to… Bill would say something like that would be there in almost every bond that was symptomatic, or it wouldn't be a symptomatic bond at all."
He did seem to energise himself after that, talking and joking and dancing with everybody in the room, as if adamant about not ruining the party. But Harry could still feel that something wasn't quite right. His own mood had gone strange as well, and always now, there was that fear and desperation shrivelling up his heart. Always.
"What? No." Harry quickly shakes his head. After they've gathered all their things, they begin walking out of the DADA classroom. "No, it's fine. You two are, you know, a thing, and when you're a thing, it's… it's natural, right? To want to spend time together on your own?"
Draco swallowed. "Good. You wouldn't… you wouldn't deserve that at all," he said, his lips a sad slant. "It won't be quite painless before that though, for me."
For a moment, Harry didn't know if this was something he should tell him, because maybe this would bring them right back to what Xavier had been trying to avoid, and maybe Draco could still be saved. Maybe they could both do better this time, and reverse it all back.
Harry kept trying to conjure a Patronus, but it was hard these days to think of anything happy enough for it. He closed his eyes, swallowed hard, tried to calm down. When did it become so hard for him to think when he got scared?
"Because she likes you. She thinks you're lovely, but she thinks that about anybody that talks to her. And no offense, Malfoy, but speaking from experience, you're not the loveliest bloke I've ever known. You keep to yourself more now, and that's all I know. I don't really know who you are, if you aren't your father's son. She's been through enough, so… fair warning. You do anything to hurt her..."
The rest of the walk takes place in silence.
* * *
"Is that so?" Harry raises an eyebrow, amused. "Alright then. Do it. Tell me to fuck off politely."
Draco's mouth closed, taken aback as he stared at him, as if he hadn't expected such easy acceptance. Then, a moment after, he looked away, the movement of his chest still a bit irregular.
"Not that hard," Harry said, shrugging as he made himself tea, well-aware that he might be acting somewhat childish about it but not able to stop himself. It wasn't as if
sounds with
"About bloody time," Harry said, huffing, glancing over at Draco. They were watching Hermione slide the ring onto Ron's finger, Ron doing the same for her. "They've been together for, what, six years now?"
"It was worth a try," was what Harry said, looking back down at his plate, putting up an insouciant facade as he collected a bite on his spoon.
Potter's eyes clench shut. "Don't. Don't do that."
one of my favourites, but I only ever come here on the most special occasions. The last time must have been about, what, four years ago?" That explained why he wasn't as easily recognized.
Half-way through the explanation, he was trying to demonstrate it by casting it on Harry, but his magic fizzed out, and he went quiet, his wand held still in his hand.
"Nothing. I've just never taken you to be somebody that would miss out on classes just because you didn't feel like it."
Ron twists a corner of his lips. "I don't know. I mean, you're always looking at him, like in Sixth Year, except it can't be because you think he's up to something. He's hardly even
Scorpius clambers off the bench and looks closely at her hand, the two of them beaming up at each other. Harry can't see what's happening anymore, but Annie catches sight of Harry over Scorpius' shoulder and comes running over to show it to him.
He listened when Harry told him about growing up in a cupboard, living with a family that starved him and never wanted him or cared for him, confessed that he had once craved their affection and acceptance so much that he made himself get better at everything they forced him to do to get any token of approval when he was young, but they never noticed or cared. He'd watch his cousin receive all their love for free, while he fought for it every day and never managed to make himself mean anything to them.
He breathes through the weight pushing down on his lungs, trying to follow a rhythm, trying to follow a voice, a comfort, a too bright and vivid memory of a solid chest and a still arm around his back.
Hermione shook her head slowly. "Nothing, Harry. Just… It doesn't sound like Malfoy, does it? To do anything just because
"Not a lot. Just… you know. When things are bad, and they get busy and I isolate myself without realising I'm doing it again. Like it all comes back. But not anymore — they make sure I don't, whenever they can."
Harry laughed slightly. Draco grabbed his face by the chin and kissed him hard.
Harry takes Draco to the Christmas dinner. Molly and Arthur talk to him, ask him questions about his studies, his future. Charlie asks him about his and Harry's relationship in school, and they give him the watered down version of their story without its impossible complications. Charlie tells them all about his boyfriend back in Romania, and Harry can see the way Draco straightens at this, listening closely. Harry knows what he grew up with, how hard it was to be himself there, and he understands, because grew up somewhere just like that too.
His eyes slipped shut again, and thoughts morphed into incoherent, blurred images. Waves of messy, white-blond hair. Bright bulb lights.
"I'll walk you to your dorm, Malfoy." Something inside of him was trembling, shrivelling up.
They lapsed into silence, as Draco seemed to think for one of his own.
"Good," Harry says, nodding, throat convulsing. He presses the back of his sleeve to his eyes. "I'm glad that you don't ever have to...sorry. I'm not the one who should..."
"What happened?" Narcissa said. There was something very controlled about the way she sat, moved. She was pouring him tea in another cup. "Last night."
him now to think about that, that Draco could never have been here at all.
." He says the word with a dry sort of emphasis. "Merlin knows how she considers the place where I'd be welcomed the least 'safe'."
Draco comes in fairly late. His lips are pressed together, but he is clearly nervous in the roomful of children, eyes everywhere, tugging at his collar with two fingers as he clears his throat.
* * *
"That's a shame," Timothy said, dropping down to the seat beside him.
his tactless and untoward behaviours in the past here as well, but that felt like dredging up more than he should at the moment.
"You're staring at me," Draco says, with an edge of a huff to his voice.
"I'll talk to him," Harry tells him, uncrossing his arms and making his way to Matthew.
Harry came to stand next to him and grabbed two mugs from the cabinet above. He heated the kettle on the stove, poured the boiling water in two mugs after it was done. He put five sugars, two spoons of milk in one, and slid it over.
"You're in a mood," Harry said. Draco poured tea in another cup.
"I thought… I thought you'd be a lot more… grossed out. At the thought of that. Us, I mean." Harry could not explain the tightening feeling around his ribs when he said the words aloud.
* * *
Harry stroked his hair, wanting to get him to look at him. "Sometimes bad things just happen, even to good people."
Thank you so much for all your kind and supportive comments in the last chapter! I appreciated them deeply 💙
"I'd like to know."
. Sometimes he would ask them,
Luna Lovegood comes into Draco's compartment and asks if she can sit with him, trailed by Neville Longbottom, who shuffles uncomfortably in the doorway with his toad in hand. He walks inside anyway after Draco's off-handed affirmation, his jaw set decisively. Lovegood seems fully oblivious, as expected, to the strained dynamic between the two of them.
He goes through life there adrift and restless. Sick in his chest for a home that doesn't exist.
"Malfoy?"
"Yeah," Harry said, trying to smile, though it felt strange on his face. "Alright. Just tired."
The next time they ran into each other at Andromeda's, it was Harry having already been there for the past quarter of an hour. Andromeda was in the kitchen, making lunch. He was holding Teddy high on his shoulders, spinning around and drawing loud peals of belly-laughter from him.
?" he squeaked out, his voice trembling.
"Shall we fall in love this time then?" Draco said, and looked him in the eyes, making it so clear how absurd he found the concept to be.
I hope you're all safe and well and taking care. And happy Easter to everybody that celebrates it!
"How would you?"
He puts it on, adjusting the formal robes. He'd borrowed it from Harry, so they're somewhat short on him, but he casts a few spells that resize it to his fitting. "Right. So. Go out with Ginny, yeah? Don't be alone."
is sharing this with him.
not feeling it?" Harry had asked, breathless, his voice sounding distant. He'd felt hot, and then cold and shivery, and like he wanted something he didn't have a name for.
"Bye bye," Scorpius says in a sing-song voice, waving at Harry.
to get back into society's good graces, indeed."
"Oh no, it's alright, Harry. You're always welcome to join," Luna says.
"That's for old and grey people, like your Weasley parents."
Harry stills, surprised, and then relieved. There's a pause after, and he thinks Draco might be trying to compose his grief away, how it still lingers. "Now I have, or had, no doubt about my importance to them, but… with blood relations and people who are obligated to you, there's always a question of how much you'd really matter to them without it." His voice goes a little fainter, quieter, here, something perhaps hidden under the surface. "Not to say it means nothing at all, then. It matters. But I do believe it must mean something more if they choose you."
Draco is at the front in the stands when he comes to watch Potter.
Harry gave in now.
Harry went back to sleep, ear to the reassurance of his heartbeat, Draco's hands stroking his hair back.
In the noon, Narcissa sent breakfast up via a house elf. Draco still hadn't woken by then.
As Headmistress McGonagall's speech goes on, Harry glances over at the Slytherin Table, at Draco sitting with his chin on his palm, picking listlessly at his food. He hasn't looked up in all the time they've been here.
"Can we please be nice and let Mr. Malfoy finish what he was saying?" Harry says loudly from the corner, but nobody listens.
Teddy removes his hands away from his face, blinking big eyes as they readjust to the suddenly reappearing world.
Harry hadn't been able to make himself approach him, however. He didn't want to start anything again by pissing him off in any way, which might happen just by Harry making the mistake of trying to speak to him.
At first, Harry is afraid. At first he is afraid because they are friends, and they are fragile, and Draco is still recovering, healing. Tangling anything up into complications might just mean breaking everything apart.
It was in this moment that they got to view a secret, an act that they were never intended to witness.
“What are you saying, Pans?” Blaise asked curiously, following intently with each word of her plan.
He’d never felt that homely feeling until now:  the sensation of fresh cooked meals and Christmas trees surrounded by family and friends. The implicit notion that no matter what happened, he’d always have a safe place to return to. It unraveled him from the core outward and he felt himself clinging to Harry. He never wanted to let this go, not as long as he lived. Never.
They shared a worried glance before Harry reached forward and grasped one of the handles, bracing himself before throwing it downward and flinging the door open.
“Bullshit, Reg. All of the people you spend your time following around hate me. How in the hell do you expect me to believe that you don’t?”
“Well,” Sirius spat angrily, “they aren’t. And I doubt they ever will be.”
He could only hope he’d get a glimpse of James Potter.
He then turned to his friends, who were currently held at Wand point by a now standing James and Lily.
One face seemed to penetrate the crowd, sticking out enchantingly amongst the others. Harry cocked his head, studying the young red-head eagerly. Who was this girl, and why did she seem so familiar?
“Well, like you said...” Pansy’s expression was suddenly lit like fire against her thoughts. It reminded Harry eerily of Hermione when she was onto something big.
But Malfoy didn’t yell, or spit defensively, or even physically attack him. Instead, he glanced at his own toes before replying.
The destruction rang closer and orbs were falling every which way. Shards of crystal landed by Harry’s face. It was suddenly, all so real...
“And, remember that time in third year when I asked you to Hogsmeade? You said, ‘maybe if you quit asking in a few years I’ll change my mind.’ And... here we are.”
Something about the way the words fell from Harry’s tongue, so effortlessly... he truly meant them. And it was evident that, deep down, Draco was always the person he’d loved. The same strong, brave, determined, ambitious almost-Gryffindor he still was.
“How? Like, we date?”
What happened next was far from what he ever could’ve guessed.
Draco smirked, amused. His gaze softened. “Thanks, by the way. For coming after me. Even if it was just the workings of your hero complex.” Humor danced along the corners of his eyes as they pulled upward contentedly.
Malfoy’s smile fades. “Do you smell anything?”
He was passing aisles and aisles of memories, resolutely pressing onward, when he realized that there were now footsteps peddling not far from him. He didn’t dare turn around to see how close he was gaining on them and instead gripped Draco’s body tighter.
“We received your patronus, Albus,” Shacklebolt declared. “Mighty Fine job rounding these up for us.”
Remus stood dumbfounded, unaware of what was happening around him. He reached forward for Sirius but was met instead by a rather large black dog that’s tail was wagging excitedly.
It was in this moment that they realized that their eyes had met, faces not far apart. A playful air resonated between them but was quickly settling into something more serious.
“Thank you for coming.” Regulus Black extended his hand forward almost professionally, and Sirius shrunk back without taking it.
“Professor Dumbledore? Can you hear me?” He asked aloud, in somewhat of a dumb fashion, grasping for anything that would lead him to the missing Malfoy.
Because even Hermione noticed gray eyes peering in their direction, and she cocked her head contemplatively before turning back to her notes.
Sirius Black and Remus Lupin we’re perched at the edge of the water, laughing and splashing each other lightly.
“Oh, well, I wasn’t-“ he starts, but Harry Potter has stepped his foot forward.
Present day Harry couldn’t help but wonder how he hadn’t noticed Draco staring heavily in his direction. Whatever the distraction was, it was strong.
This realization was enough to move mountains. To scatter the seas. Suddenly Harry felt that he could do or be anything. It was Draco, and his unannounced support, that meant everything.
“Geez, Draco, are you performing a seance in here or what?” With a flick of her wand, the room illuminated.
Harry stood at the door frame, holding onto one edge to keep himself from falling into the bizarre world of light beyond.
“So being myself is a blatant disrespect to the Black name, eh? Maybe I should’ve gone to Potter’s. He wouldn’t have let that happen to me!”
“Pshh, you’d be lucky if SHE gave YOU so much as a handjob,” Blaise jabbed, trying to direct the subject away from Draco. It was obvious that something was wrong.
Draco nodded before resting his forehead against Harry’s. And then, out of nowhere, he was laughing.
It was pathetic at best, and they were highly outnumbered. The wicked grin on Malfoy’s face was enough to make any witch or wizard’s skin crawl.
Harry smiled. “Of course not. But I am enjoying seeing you so flustered.”
“How much time do we have?” Peter asked nervously, twitching as if he was already in rodent form.
“Nicely done, Mr. Malfoy.”
He appeared to fit right in with his house mates.
“Oh.” Ron and Harry spoke simultaneously.
“Goyle.”
He thought it would end, but the wand held steady as the punishment continued. Harry couldn’t breathe, he couldn’t think as his own body subconsciously flexed and tightened at every muscle. Discomfort turned to anger in a flashing fury as he watched the malicious glint reflect from Lucius Malfoy’s gaze.
Malfoy appeared sick. To be honest, Potter felt absolutely nauseated himself.
“I’ve decided to give you boys detention with me this weekend. You will forfeit your Hogsmeade priveliages and meet me here Saturday morning. Is that understood?”
“Maybe we’re immune to amortentia.”
And James, upon learning Moony’s observation, was ecstatic.
“Oh my god, that’s it! Wormtail!” Sirius was beside himself, grinning from ear to ear. James was pleased, and Remus couldn’t help but chuckle. Even if it was just slightly.
And Sirius Black wasted no time in slinging hexes in Lucius Malfoy’s direction. Beside him, Remus Lupin sat calmly in wolf form.
“So you wanted to meet because you’re interested in the dark arts?”
“Because he’s an abomination!” The words belonged to Lucius, who, though bound, was still able to speak.
Harry rested his head against a shoulder, giggling quietly.
It suddenly became evident to everyone in the room just what Lucius Malfoy had just done.
“So, Lily, are you glad you came?”
“Is this the part where I get to drink?” He asked facetiously, a smile pulling at the edges of his lips. There were giggles from the girls and chuckles from the rest as they tipped back each glass.
“You bloody Gryffindor.” There it was, that crooked smile. His favorite.
Until one member of their clique noticed something he hadn’t before from the corner of his sight.
Harry could hear pacing as he continued to divulge.
It was evident that he didn’t know what to say, or how to feel. It was as if Pansy had unlocked a whole new world that he’d yet to explore. He smiled softly.
Did he know?
Harry watched as they all exited, holding his breath. From the next room, he swore he heard the soft whimpering of a scared wolf, though the others seemed to pay it no mind.
The excitement of brooms flying every which way and cheers booming from the crowd momentarily distracted Harry from realizing that Malfoy was still holding onto him.
Things would never be the same between them.
“Oh, much better.” Sirius grinned, almost forgetting the reason why James had confronted the younger Black in the first place.
“Hey, be nice to the wittle rodent.” James gestured toward the ground, squatting to get a closer look.
He had no vials, no memories from his own psyche, nothing to pour into the pensieve that he thought would lead him to the blonde.
“Yes...I’ve heard rumors...that there’s a Dark Lord coming to power...”
“Ouch! He bit me!” Sirius doubled over; Peter transformed back into human form.
His body altered similarly, swelling and popping as he hit the ground. Pale skin was quickly covered by the darkest fur they’d ever seen. It spread rapidly to his hands and feet, which had already transfigured flawlessly to paws.
He tilted his head, glancing about the room for some sort of answer to a question he wasn’t sure had been asked. And then, an idea occurred to him.
What came as a surprise to him was his Godfather’s undoing. When Snape killed the Headmaster, Draco was in shock. Instead of standing his ground, he followed.
“I can’t believe I’m telling you this. You of all people, Potter. But I can sort of...relate.”
Lucius smiled maliciously.
“Oh.”
Harry watched the jolted expression of Lily, who seemed stuck between a grateful  sigh of relief and an anxiety attack. He saw his father slide a hand around the small of her back as he led her down the stairs and to toward the exit.
Something caught his attention, flickering from his peripheral vision. He stopped immediately, pivoting to the source that was a cabinet across the room.
Voldemort’s return was widespread. The ministry was under fire. And Draco was forced into a role that he’d never asked for.
Even in darkness, his eyes seemed absolutely delighted at the prospect of horror.
“Memories,” Harry whispered, placing a hand on a random globe of white light. He was greeted by images of Buckbeak in their third year Care of Magical Creatures Lesson. He quickly let go of this, sprinting along to another shelf. Another memory, a more recent one, one that had occurred only hours before, if he estimated correctly...
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco, take me to Draco,” he thought, as if the pensieve was the Room of Hidden Things, as if by merely requesting the boy he’d stumble upon him.
“No.”
It was this fact that had him feeling empty, like he’d left a piece of himself back in the pensieve. With Draco.
“I quite regretfully believe he has a chance.” He folded his hands, twisting his fingers as he sparked his own revelation.
“Why didn’t you help me!?” He yelled dramatically, offended beyond belief that the people he’d chosen over his brother hadn’t come to his rescue. Like James would’ve.
“I would.” Harry spilled, and he wasn’t sure why. The response had just sort of rolled out naturally, like it belonged there the entire time. He hadn’t thought about it, but if he did, he knew that he’d meant it all along. He would do that for Malfoy. He’d do that for anyone. Wouldn’t he?
“Draco!” He caught himself screaming, shuffling after the boy who weaved in and out of the bookshelves stealthily.
James pranced around happily before chasing Sirius with his antlers. Peter’s lip retracted into a smile as he laughed at the taller Marauder, who was yelling at James to quit it.
“Come on, Regulus. He’s not worth your time.” Lucius coaxed, and the others began to trail after him. A moment behind, Regulus Black gave both his brother and Lupin another once over before making a decision that would forever ingrain the present dynamic.
“There, now that wasn’t so difficult, was it?” The voice above him taunted, and Harry began to crawl forward as the pain subsided slightly. The curse must’ve been wearing off.
“He saved us,” they stated, and he never thought he’d hear the words “Thank Merlin Malfoy was there” Come from Ron Weasley’s mouth.
He slowly turned, approaching the staircase. Unable to look him in the eye.
Draco didn’t hear the spell over his own shriek. He instantly threw his arms to try to place himself between the two... but he was too late. Harry, who’d barely made it off the ground, was out cold.
Harry’s stomach was overcome by the soft fluttering wings of butterflies. And suddenly he wasn’t so empty anymore.
Okay, okay, he wasn’t crazy, and that was a relief. A sort of sick and twisted freak maybe, but not insane. And if he was somewhat of a hormonal weirdo, at least Draco was, too, and for some reason that made it feel a bit more alright.
“He reminds me of a rat.” James rebutted, and Sirius put a hand forth dramatically.
He glanced from side to side humorously. “Which one? They’re all too good for you twats.”
Remus’s face bore fresh scratches, maybe a few days old. It appeared that this memory didn’t occur far after the shrieking shack.
Harry gulped, quite audibly.
He doesn’t know how to live without it.
He was rushed to St. Mungo’s, and Draco didn’t care to hide the tears that streamed uncontrollably down his cheeks.
Her words were like a lullaby, a song that would come to be his favorite. A tune he would treasure forever.
“Fine.”
He gestured first to himself, then to the girl pulling him along, and then to a spot right between his legs while he nodded his head crudely.
He’d water that damned thing if it was the last thing he’d be able to do. It was the least he deserved.
“Relax, Malfoy. I think I heard something.”
He yelled passionately, and for a moment, nothing happened. But then... more sparks. Harry felt his stomach lurch as the electricity flowed through his blood and seemed to revitalize every part of him, piece by piece.
“I will get you that potion if it’s the last thing I do, Remus Lupin. And it will work. And you won’t have to go through this anymore.”
His tone was heavy with the escalation of their argument.
“I give that a 7. Pansy and I whooped y’all,” Blaise stared, and the playful humor of the soirée continued.
Draco didn’t seem nearly as jumbled in his thoughts as Harry was. In fact, he seemed quite content beside him. That was almost comforting. Harry felt his own physique relax considerably before the world began to shift again.
“You little imbecile! I raised you better than this. You are no son of mine. You can keep that thought with you as you await your own personal punishment once I turn you over to the Dark Lord.”
Lucius grinned, an unsettling match to the insanity in his colorless eyes.
“Hey, look,” he instructed, turning toward the body that was walking beneath the stands. “Isn’t that Pettigrew?”
Ron piped from the sidelines, and Harry turned to him, flabbergasted, mouth dropped, heart beating erratically in his chest.
One bed to the right was Black himself, hair grown out past his shoulders and bearing a frame that was all muscle. He laid back dramatically with a sigh.
Remus, shaking his head, laughed lightly. The party continued, and Draco muttered something about wishing they could eat the food in these memories.
A wicked laugh from behind them. “You can’t run from your demons, Draco! They are your demons, after all!”
When her cold stare became evident, he, too, scrambled to leave. Only the five of them remained.
“What are you gonna do about it, Lupin?” Bella cackled, but another Slytherin was already stepping forward.
He hasn’t tried to perform the charm since, but something tells him he won’t be able to. It’s a nagging feeling in his gut, and he admittedly doesn’t like it.
Draco gulped before nodding.
It was one of Draco’s favorite nights, Harry snuggled lightly against his chest, the soft feel of his breath tickling the bare skin.
Why dub Draco the deed if they planned on doing it themselves?
One by one, the Marauders transformed back. Sirius was the last, leaning over Remus’s body and carefully healing some of his wounds with his wand. James sat a sympathetic hand on his shoulder.
For love.
“You look like you’re stroking out or something... that’s what the muggles call it, right?” The edges of his lips pulled upward sarcastically.
Across the room, Draco couldn’t help but eye Harry. Just to make sure he didn’t hear his house mates being ridiculous and immature.
And Malfoy was yelling, he was screaming for him to stop, but this only fueled him forward. He grasped for the back of his robes, only to miss narrowly as Harry employed the skills of a team’s best Seeker. His breath was heavy, he wondered how much longer he could push, but something inside, a little voice perhaps, kept whispering just a little farther...
But Draco had changed. He’d seen it in the memories. The way his smile reflected against the romance of Remus Lupin and Sirius Black. The way he’d seemed to realize that the values of his father weren’t fair to him or to anyone else. The way he’d jumped in front of Remus Lupin, ready to set his life on the line regardless of what his father thought...
He smiled a quirky little grin that caused something inside Draco’s stomach to lurch.
And suddenly his stomach lurched, and he felt himself falling head first into darkness. There was no up, or down, and he wasn’t quite sure which direction he was heading toward anymore. There was only darkness, and the sinking feeling in his stomach that something wasn’t quite right.
“Very well. Draco, I presume you know what will happen if you fail.”
“That cabinet. There’s one just like it in Borgin and Burke’s. I’ve seen it before; it’s a vanishing cabinet. That’s how they’ve gotten in!”
Harry glanced around passively. “The shrieking shack. This must be where he sleeps.”
The day Harry kissed Malfoy was one he would savor endlessly. They were on the couch, watching some muggle sitcom that Harry enjoyed far too much. His face lit up at each joke, and Draco smiled at his reactions.
“Don’t let them bother you, Reg. Know that it grosses us all out equally,” Bellatrix added with a wicked grin.
Harry was still holding an utterly shocked and blank stare, head cocked stupidly to the side as he came to observe their surroundings.
But then, another whisper. A distant proclamation that rings through the periphery of his hearing. “Draco... always... good enough...”
“It means something. For you, and for me. Magic doesn’t lie, Draco.”
James disarmed Bellatrix before his focus was completely torn away to the other side of the room.
“Draco?”
“I know it’s fucking hard! I know how much you crave his acceptance! It’s about just as badly as I want my parents back from the dead.”
The most unsettling thing of all was the presence of one of them directly behind him.
He doesn’t care that he’s spent the last 7 years arguing with this boy. He doesn’t give a flying fuck that he’s on the dead end of his wand. He’s dying, and he doesn’t bother with small details.
Eventually, the wolf was replaced by a scarred Remus, naked and vulnerable on the floor of the shack. His body was covered in cuts and bruises; blood ran down his lips where his jaw had reformed.
“What has happened is a tragedy. An atrocity. Potter and his colleagues have embarrassed this entire family. Do you agree?”
Huffing and puffing, the boys straightened up at the sight of an almost pleased Dumbledore, stirring his tea wandlessly with a circular motion of his finger. His gaze was fixed beyond the room, as if he was contemplating something much bigger than the boys missing from detention.
He hit next again.
Eventually, Draco used his palms to press himself upward. He still struggled to catch his breath as he stood, chest rising and falling rapidly against his determination.
Draco Malfoy doesn’t visit Malfoy manor, and its empty rooms are surely hung with cob webs and dust mites and other small creatures that have made it home. The stone exterior is beginning to succumb to a green vine that twists its way up the foundation, and apparently small children dare each other to knock on the door of the “Death Eater House.”
Draco and Harry sped past her, no longer caring if they could see ahead. They had to protect Remus, and the animagi.
His limbs feel heavy, and Harry cracks an eye to realize he’s being carried by Hagrid. He stares through the small slit to see a sea of people, dirty with war but standing determinedly. And in that cluster of bodies, his eyes catch the figure of a blonde.
But that wasn’t the end of Potter’s prying. Every day, it seemed, he found little excuses to spend time around Draco.
Draco hadn’t realized that his ghosts would follow him here. But as he watches the shadows dance upon the walls of his very own room, he knows he’s not dreaming. It’s his father, reminding him that he will never be good enough.
