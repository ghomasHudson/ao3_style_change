"Potter wanted to speak to me about when we were going to meet next to rehearse," Draco replied easily.
He didn't dare admit it however. Especially not in front of the madwoman who impersonated Draco's aunt.
Harry stared at him unblinkingly before throwing his head back and laughing loudly. It was then that Draco realized just how rare his laugh was. He had other sorts of laughs, yes, but he rarely laughed the way he did just then. With his entire body, with amusement and happiness. It was rare both before and after the war, much to Draco's dismay.
“Likewise.” They broke apart and Hermione frowned. She got a better look around Harry’s house. “Geez, I thought Blaise was exaggerating, but you really are a mess.”
"There's our moody teenager," his father laughed while his papa mused, “What's that saying again? 'Happy wife, happy life?'"
Draco sighed. "Potter, relax, alright? Stop stopping in the middle of your sentences and saying 'er' like an oaf. I did not get to meet my uncle, but I assure you that my uncle never once said 'er' in his life."
Draco blinked. He'd been expecting a berating about his incapabilities in Potions and a harsh warning of his soon-to-be disowning. He'd been expecting... not a talk about the two fields he'd mastered by third year.
Draco rid himself of his confused thoughts. "No. Let's continue to talk about your idea." He pressed a few fingers to his temple, sighing. "Regardless of what you want me to believe, I will not deliberately force myself to fall in love with some poor bloke or witch who is in love with me. It's manipulation. Not to mention how horribly that would turn out. Remember those books we've read?"
The only reason he finally forced himself to get up was because he needed to. Harry was a Viking. This will not be the only time he left for days on end, and Draco needed to be capable of living here without his being around. This meant going out into the village— maybe working on Harry’s pitiful garden— and learning how to cook.
"Malfoy, wait up," Potter called out to him in the middle of one of the busiest hallways of Hogwarts the next morning.
He would have laughed upon remembering their habit of yelling at each other over three tables had he not been preoccupied with a conversation with Blaise.
"It's something called 'making sure first year Slytherins didn't snatch it on their way out of your bedroom'," Theo kindly replied.
He excused himself politely and stepped past the crowd to follow Harry, who was clamoring up the stairs leading to the docks at such a feverish pace Blaise would have been worried if not for the fact that nobody present would insult the poor boy. Well... Draco would. But he's busy playing the piano— or not. The seat that he'd occupied was empty, and the music had kept playing without a single hitch.
Pansy blinked once. Then twice. Then bursted out into loud laughter. She laughed until she cried. She clutched her sides and begged Ron for mercy.
"You're eating with me?" Harry asked as he stepped out the bathroom in his sleeping garments. It would have sounded questioning if his eyes weren't trained on Draco's exposed collarbone. Instead, Harry's question sounded more like a demand than an inquiry.
Thank you all for waiting so long! As thanks, I'm including a pretty long chapter about their totally-not-a-date on the Astronomy Tower. (It's secretly my favorite trope so...)
Pansy glanced towards Draco, who gave her the go-ahead. "About a few days before that incident, Draco hosted his first piano recital. There were reporters everywhere, and one of the ambassadors of Spain arrived to speak with Lucius. Let's just say, Draco exposed him for his fake Louis Vuitton, his illegitimate sons, and his affair with his secretary. Nearly fifty million galleons worth of inheritance was transferred to this blond git, and the ambassador has a price on his head for it."
expression written all over Potter's face. It was definitely prat-like. What else could that look on his face be? It certainly wasn't pain.
"Malfoy!" Harry called once he stepped out into the empty corridor. Draco stopped walking, but didn’t bother turning around. He wouldn’t admit it, but for some reason... just the sound of Harry's voice was enough to make him stop where he was. When Harry caught up, Draco turned away in fear that he would give himself away. "Are you alright?"
"It was. But I loved it. I loved sitting there under the trees and listening to my mother. I loved falling asleep under the stars and waking up to see one of the peacocks making a funny face at me. I loved playing the little violin she would bring out whenever I was feeling particularly down and she claimed she wanted to hear me— I loved being the reason why she smiled." He paused, the tips of his lips spreading into a gorgeous smile. "Everyone is beautiful when they do."
"Good evening, Mr. Malfoy," she replied. She was obviously pleased that he finally took up her offer of referring to her by her first name. "I hope I did not interrupt a study session by requesting for your existence."
Okay guys, my next update might take a while. I have this severe writer's block, but it shouldn't be more than a few days. I'm so sorry ToT
"It's not what they came running about but—" Theo muttered under his breath before Draco kicked his shin under the table. He hissed and glared at the blond.
"Draco," Blaise suddenly spoke up. Draco broke away from his trance to look at his friend. "May I borrow your inkwell?"
"Not true!" Hermione unexpectedly argued. "In fact, most of Gryffindor tolerates him. And that's saying quite a lot, Theo."
He did know what he wanted though. He wanted them to be exclusive. He wanted to be allowed to spend more time with Harry. He wanted to passively get to know Granger and Weasley so they would remain a little more than just civil for Harry's sake. Draco knew all this, but didn't know how to phrase it in a way to guarantee that he'd get it.
"He succeeded," Draco corrected. He stood up from the couch he and Harry had been sitting in and went over to the corner. He snatched a box that he'd disillusioned earlier and smirked triumphantly as he placed it on the coffee table. "Affinity enhancers. This is Alois's first batch. The next one should arrive by tomorrow morning."
"Stay safe, my darling. I will always support you no matter what you do. Swear that you'll remember that, Draco."
"So you won't?" Shacklebolt inquired politely. He pulled out his wand, clearly threatening him and inadvertently informing him that Draco either had to comply or be sent back to the holding cell.
Hermione, as quick as ever, used a silencing charm on Antonin before the screaming could attract other Death Eaters' attention.
Sighing, Draco said, "Yes, but this is not the time for small chat. Go to your class, Potter, or Merlin help me, I will beg Granger to drag you away."
"Well... after we became friends, Pansy, Theo, and Blaise started talking a lot about you. Ron and I really didn't believe them at first, y'know, but then Hermione started believing them so we thought it was a safe enough bet. It's kind of embarrassing, but we felt like we were friends with you even though you were... y'know."
Mutely, Harry took it and wiped his face while Theo changed Draco's shirt. He made sure his eyes were covered while Draco's torso was exposed, not wanting to make him uncomfortable in his sleep. When Theo's footsteps sounded a bit farther, Harry opened his eyes and settled back into his chair, taking Draco's hand again. This time, Harry did not kiss it.
"— and then you all arrived with your wands blazing and Ron convinced Draco to spy on Voldemort!" Harry ended up shouting.
Sharply nodding upon the harsh demand, Draco took a deep breath and locked eyes with his godfather. He filled his mind with one thought: find all the potion advancements Severus Snape had once made. He had yet to try and learn these advancements, and Draco would be damned before he let this chance go.
"Harry, you're being ridiculous," Draco blurted. No way was Draco going to let Harry come along. If Harry was right— Merlin, Draco hoped to heaven and hell that he wasn't— Harry would be dead within two seconds of entering the Manor. Draco would rather suffer under Wormtail's uncomfortable stare for eternity than let Harry go anywhere near the Dark Lord. If he could, he'd keep Harry away from that madman forever. "You are not going with me. Absolutely not."
"You don't know either?" Blaise was flabbergasted and indignant. "You didn't ask Hayes about what happens to your own character?"
"I'm sixteen. Of course I do," Draco replied, rolling his eyes. "And I'll think about it, Harry. If I do decide to do so, do you have any songs you'd like for me to play? One that would be challenging, preferably."
"McGonagall would yell at me if she saw me eating this," Harry confesses with a soft chuckle. She was always a Quidditch fanatic (not to mention gambler) and if she ever saw someone slacking off or eating more sweets than they can burn; Harry especially since his speed as a Seeker can be hindered if he gained too much weight. She'd strictly prohibited him from eating more than four treacle tarts a week (which he'd personally thought should be punishable by Azkaban).
"Yes, but even if I wasn't, there isn't much choice. The Dark Lord has begun his attacks. We need to hone our defenses, starting with yours..." Actually, that gave him an idea. "If it sounds like an alright idea to you, Severus, I suggest we begin training a group of individuals in the art of Occlumency and Legilimency. These individuals would then take on their own groups and so on."
Draco nodded shakily. "Harry, let me take over the explanation. All you've done is made him confused."
"Then? Look, Malfoy, I think going to a Mind Healer would really help us out. We both get lost in our heads all the time, and trust me when I say we've both been through some difficult stuff. It's about time we see if there's something we could do to get some peace."
"No..." Draco whined. He simply could not believe the audacity of Blaise Zabini. "Have you forgotten about my dying wish already? I said I wanted to be cremated and scattered into the wing— oh, but Theo can still let down my casket as he does whenever he's my Potions partner."
He'd detailed it so both pupils and the specks of Potter's eyes were emphasized quite nicely in a way that didn't hide the hidden reflection in his eyes. The hidden reflection went into detail about Lovegood's imprisonment at the Malfoy manor.
"It's just uncomfortable how they still call each other by their last names!" Hermione interrupted before Pansy could confess. "We're all friends, aren't we? They even talk civilly now. But..."
Malfoy's giggling was literal music to Harry's ears, and whatever it was that their professor said to him about laughing in the middle of an exam escaped his ears. All he wanted to do was make Malfoy giggle like that again, no matter how absurd and stupid and completely irrational saying another comment was.
"Of course not. If so, he'd be a Hufflepuff," Theo huffed. "Unsurprisingly, Draco has a thing for parties and pianos. Anytime he hears an opportunity to do either, he gets all childish and excited. Put them in the same sentence... well, he might as well be identified as a year-old puppy."
Harry didn't respond, simply taking off with their friends and leaving Draco alone with the Death Eaters. Draco tensed when he heard a nasty cackle.
He shot two wary glances around the horribly filled hallway as he picked himself up, brushing his shoulder off.
Harry shrugged. "Anything really. I just want to know more about you since we're friends and that's what friends do. Get to know each other, that is. It's weird because if I'd told the younger me that I'd be friends with Draco Malfoy, the younger me would have slapped me and asked if Hermione found the potion to cure whatever the hell was wrong with me."
"You're speaking as though you have never shared a book with Cass before you two got together," Pansy sassed.
Draco did something that looked like a shrug. "I miss how it used to be." His eyelashes fluttered before shutting. "It may have gone to shit now, but before... before, it was wonderful. It was my home. Now, I can't even think of it in that way."
"Cissy and Blond Asshat's brat?" the unfamiliar voice certainly had an edge to it now. Draco could just imagine a distorted man narrowing his eyes and scrunching up his nose in disgust. He shivered. He did not want to find out what convicts learned from Azkaban.
"No, I did tell you. You asked me where I was a few weeks ago and I informed you I was speaking with Potter. We have to do this peer share activity where we share one fact with each other before our next class."
"You are," Potter said. He ducked his head slightly, catching Draco's eyes and forcing him to stare back into them. "And I was just trying to get it over with. You know, the thing Hayes wants us to do. If we don't, we're not going to be allowed to graduate. You know how McGonagall put her class as a requirement."
He was still awkward. No one could take that trait from him. But his attempt to follow Draco's advice made him just a tad more charming than usual. And Draco knew this because wizards and witches alike practically fell over themselves when Potter strolled into the library with his new hair style on Monday.
"Oh really? How kind of Harry to volunteer," Blaise drawled. His eyes narrowed in suspicion and Harry fidgeted on his feet. "He most definitely does not have any ulterior motives for agreeing to hold your hand."
He quickly shook that thought off. Ron and Hermione would hex his bollocks off if they heard him thinking the way he just did.
"We can go to the library to work together tomorrow morning while Harry, Draco, Vince, and Greg are out," Theo offered. "Draco, it's not too far, right?"
Pansy grinned. "Remember when I told you that Draco became obsessed with Muggle books in Fourth Year? Back then, Draco bet that Lucius wouldn't be able to sneak in as many Muggle slang terms than he could during meals. It was wonderful: for an entire day, we witnessed the Lucius and Draco sit in the dining hall cursing at each other under their breaths. We had a tally and everything."
“Good boy.” And to add insult to injury, Harry mussed his hair roughly before pushing him to the ground.
“You’re a Viking wife. If the village is attacked while the Vikings are away, you need to be able to defend yourself.”
They weren't pissed that he kept it from them (well, Pansy was) and they weren't angry that he tried to deal with it on his own (this time, Blaise was). Nor did they take great interest in his then-erased Dark Mark (well, Theo did this one).
Unsurprisingly, he was absolute garbage at anything concerning the theoretical parts of brewing potions and their components. But when it came to the practical parts of Potions, he found it to be quite simple. All he had to do was pretend he was cooking and baking at the same time: prepare ingredients and add specific amounts of them.
Blaise, on the other hand, rolled his eyes. "Continuing forwards, Pansy also had suspicions that it had been a potion gone haywire in your third year that was still affecting you now. When Theo gave you his own concoction, she thought it must have reacted badly with whatever the contents were. However, when your Hanahaki continued..."
There was a dull emptiness in Draco's eyes for the rest of his stay, and there was a steady flow of bloodied bedsheets sent the house-elves' way. His mind played tricks on him, and his head remained bowed. His thoughts remained empty, except for the ocassional shiver from the reminders of
"So you mean to tell me that you saw Draco cough up blood back then and you didn't think to tell me?" Pansy asked.
Granted, the misunderstanding was sort of my fault since I'm really bad at being clear sometimes. So my bad. TvT I apologize.
By Sunday, Draco was sick of it. He began avoiding the main corridors, choosing to venture through abandoned but clean hallways to avoid bumping into Potter on the way to the library. Somehow, Potter took notice and began bumping into him on purpose in these abandoned hallways. He'd then verbally harass Draco and ask him why he was so terrified of telling him his favorite color.
So he restrained himself and went back to work, completing his Defense Against Dark Arts homework right as the class was dismissed. As he packed his bag, Draco reckoned that he could finish his Care of Magical Creatures homework during lunch since the assignment wasn't that difficult.
Draco's head snapped up, his eyes raking Potter once and twice before he forced himself to stop. He grit his teeth and braced for a hex coming his way— if it wasn't by Potter, Draco expected Granger or Weasley or one of his other Gryffindor followers to do so. If they didn't step up— Draco glanced around the hallway to see people staring at them— he knew one of Potter's stupid lackeys would be happy enough to do it for him.
"Perhaps, Theo can put my bodiless coffin into the ground. That way, he can let me down one more time," he finished, wiping a nonexistent tear from his eyes.
"Pansy and I'll stay back," Theo added. "We'll have to be here to make sure Code Pink doesn't come snooping around for traces of you all, and if she does, we'll need to be here to steer her off."
To think that he'd missed so many opportunities to make Harry laugh so carelessly and beautifully over the years…
For starters, while everyone in Potter's family was dead, some of Draco’s were very much alive. There was his aunt Andromeda and the son of his first cousin, Nymphadora, who had fought on Potter's side. Theodore Lupin was a cute little Metamorphosis, and Draco could gloat about his perfect, childish grin for hours after Theodore came to visit him while he was at Azkaban. Not even the fact that Potter was his godfather could have taken away Draco's pride and joy upon interacting with the little brat.
Thinking of Lucius right now didn’t do anything to ease his nerves. Being at his father’s mercy was awful, always waiting for him to marry him off to the next person willing to pay the right price. But, Draco was far from thinking it would be any better with these Vikings. Despite Harry’s pleasing looks and hospitality, Draco had no idea what he had planned for him.
"It's not," he insisted. Then he glanced around the room once over before lowering his voice. "What if, as an act of loyalty, my father wants me to use my affinity against us?"
It’d never occurred to him not to follow through with his original plan, yet now he found himself considering other options. When it came down to it though, there really were two possibilities: cast Draco out on his own to face public scorn and his father’s wrath, or don’t. One one hand, he’d get revenge on Lucius. It’d be poetic.
"Thank you for your lovely offer, Granger," Theo responded for him. "However, Draco is a freak when it comes to his studies. I'm afraid he may trouble you unnecessarily."
They watched, bewildered by his words. Pansy stepped aside, allowing the blond to pass by quietly. He didn't give any other indication that he heard her voice except for a slight nod and making his way past. Nobody, not even the one who'd been with Draco the longest, knew what was going on. He was too different from the boy that they knew before Christmas break.
Draco watched as Harry's shadow began moving on his own accord. The shadow, which now looked like a hand, waved at him. Draco crouched down and gently touched the ground. "Shadow animation. You've done it, Harry."
"What are we doing here? Why are you like this?" Draco asked. Harry had finally stopped dragging him away from the Hospital Wing, but they were now standing around in the near-empty courtyard. "So... weird?"
"This room is also occupied," Blaise corrected. Then he shooed Draco away with a flick of his hand, not about to give him any more attention even if Draco begged for it.
Narcissa didn't know whether or not she was allowed to breathe. Her son had deliberately avoided saying that Voldemort was his lord. Good. Merlin, he's just a boy. If he already— no. Draco was smarter than that. Narcissa had to calm herself. She had to clear her thoughts and remain impassive.
"No, it's not that I don't like him," he said, "I just wasn't expecting him. Especially when you mentioned Blaise. He was referring to my stuffed dragon, Cepheus, which my mother had taken with her to France."
information," Draco emphasized when he remembered that Hyacinthe, according to his mother, had a Dark Mark.
"My mom cared about him even though he was the one going to kill them," Harry suddenly shouted. His shoulders started to shake uncontrollably. Draco took another step forwards.
He'd staggered forwards, almost not believing the blood that stained the tiles. Malfoy's name was halfway out of his mouth when Snape rudely tossed him aside, knelt by Malfoy's bleeding side, and muttered words that made the blood slowly vanish.
He was hesitant to go out at first, but Remus decided to tag along and Draco was instantly reassured. Not that he thought anyone would try to hurt him, but the dog’s presence was definitely welcome. Over the next few days, he learned how to navigate Gryffindor. He met the non-Viking villagers, who were extremely curious about Harry’s captive and, therefore, very helpful.
That thought frightened him into researching in the library for longer periods of time. He didn't want to die by such a pathetic
Draco smiled. "I need to assure that you won't be an entire mess after I die. Which, of course, means that I need to engrain years of pureblood teaching into your mind, starting with house-elves and care for your vaults."
He gripped Draco's forearm sharply, reminding Draco of his insane and dead aunt who had a habit of breaking skin with her nails. So Draco really couldn't help the screeching— much to his complete and utter horror— and clawing at Potter's hand to get him to let go. It was like he'd just become a feral cat, scratching and biting as a defense mechanism.
"Yes, I have. The scripts have already been delivered to your respective quarters," she replied. "If there are any problems concerning the storyline, please let me know. I will be making adjustments according to the journal, which will appear as I go, so do not read until the very end yet. I advise you to inform your classmates of the same."
"No," Harry replied after what felt like an eternity. His eyes were trained intensely on Draco's, electricity and magic crackling between them.
"A mere thirty minutes," Dumbledore corrected politely. He sent a pointed smile at Draco, welcoming him into the office and gesturing towards a chair beside where Harry had sat previously.
Hermione smiled. "Don't be. I knew how important your friendship with Draco was when I first asked you. To be honest, I didn't even think you would agree. So it's fine. I'll owl you later when they're nearing the Luxembourg park so you can meet us there with everyone else."
Draco sighed, hating how bloody incompetent he was. He glanced over towards the board, scowling as he tried to figure out where he had went wrong with the potion.
Although Draco agreed with that logic, he knew that he couldn't disagree with what Blaise said next.
She stared at him silently, giving him a bit more time to prepare himself. "This has to do with the Hanahaki disease."
Draco silently wondered if Hermione had told him about each of those things as he bit into his apple. After all, the first two things Harry had just mentioned were the first uses Professor Sinistra taught them.
Pansy raised her eyebrows. “You weren’t? Because if I’m not mistaken, you were publicly straddling him not even half an hour ago—”
," Pansy hissed. She sent a pointed look at Vince and Greg. "It was until these two tricked us into thinking that they went to the library!"
"Draco," Harry greeted casually. He put an hand on Draco's shoulder and gestured for him to look down. "Look at this."
"I'd be able to show you better if we had a telescope," Draco huffed, pouting a little. "It's a shame Professor Sinistra always hides them away after classes."
It just had to be a mistake. A cruel prank pulled by the universes that will eventually be revealed.
**Has not been fixed yet! If you would rather avoid a headache from the gender pronouns/other bullshitty stuff, please wait another day or so!**
“What do you want, Blaise?” he slurred. He was too tired to deal with whatever the fuck Remus wanted. Letting his head fall back against the bench, he tried to fall back asleep.
Instead, they were upset that Draco continuously put himself in dangerous situations in which they wouldn't have been able to help if he hadn't told them just then. They were upset that Draco believed his Dark Mark dilemma wasn't as important as other things— like party planning or taking a break— and therefore needed to be pushed back.
And then, just as sudden as Potter kissed him the night before, the next pages were blank. It took several seconds for Draco to snap out of his daze, and it took even longer for Draco to realize that it was at that point that Hyacinthe had disappeared. Draco had half the mind to mourn his disappearance.
And had Draco not known Potter was an arrogant toerag who was only there to have his most-likely-very-stupid question answered, he'd have hoped he wouldn't even be given a single moment to speak before being hexed to unconsciousness.
"That's what I always say!" Blaise claimed. "Smart idiot doesn't even need his books. As long as he hears it, he'll remember it until the day he dies!"
"Look, I just like being around you. You let me talk to you about stuff, not that you agreed to in the first place, and when I say something off, you immediately catch me in the middle of my bullshit. I don't know what else to say about that. You keep me in reality, I think. You sort of make sure I don't let things get to me, like how I got annoyed by people bothering me a month or so ago. Hermione and Ron sort of do that, but I have to actually ask them for advice and even when I do, they don't say stuff the way you do. So I don't know. I guess I sort of thought we were becoming friends."
"You scared the living shit out of us!" she screamed, raising her fist to weakly punch Draco's arm. He didn't make any effort to move away. "Merlin! When Harry came back with you like that, we weren't quite sure what to think!"
"Wow, you really are a freak, Malfoy," Goldstein said. "Naming that menace after Harry? What, are you gay or something?"
She unexpectedly smiled at him and took a seat. She began flipping through the pages, as if expecting them to be reading companions without any punching or fighting or hexing.
Severus sneered. "Don't be ridiculous, Draco. I loved Lily as she was my best friend, as you do for Parkinson."
"Yes. You have ensured the safety of a priceless prophecy and stopped Tom from causing irreversible damage to Harry's mind."
Draco then did what Harry knew he did best: whine. "Because it's—" he suddenly casted a charm to check the time— "one am in the morning and it's cold."
"So I do have to leave you here for a few hours. I hope I can trust you to be quiet and discreet," he said.
per say, but just weird. After all, he had been attracted to Cho during the beginning of the school year. Harry felt bad because of Cedric, but he didn't pay too much attention to it. And then, Ginny caught his eye for a while, making Harry even more confused. She was funny, attractive, absolutely brilliant on the broom, and off-limits. She was Ron's sister, of course so of course she was off limits. 'Don't fancy your best mate's sister' was a rule that was not said, but understood. Which, by the way, just made Harry even more attracted to her.
Goldstein shuddered and somehow managed to push Draco off of him from that ridiculous angle. "Can't fight me yourself, huh? That's why you gotta take a dig at my mum?"
Harry, whose face was still flushed red, huffed and reached into his bag to randomly grab around for his script. Draco hid his disappointment when Harry emerged victorious, somewhat disliking that they wouldn't be within close proximity with each other to read Draco's script.
"Near the end of the play, Shacklebolt pops up. Unsurprisingly, he was James Potter's and his friends' roommate during his years. And since he was working with Sirius at the time, he heard about what happened to Hyacinthe and wanted to offer Regulus his condolences."
"Unless you think that they're not going to feel the same way for you." Merlin, Ron was incredibly brutal when it came to his perceptions and words, wasn't he? Draco really felt that stab in his lungs. "Unless you think they hate you."
Draco rolled his eyes in amusement, grinning as he jumped head-first into an argument with Harry about which was the better name for their owls. Draco won obviously. 'Hedwig' sounded as though Harry had seen a bald wizard and wanted to encourage him to get a wig for his bald scalp. When Draco had told him so, Harry gasped as though he'd been scandalized.
Potter's face twisted. "I remember that, but then you were a twat to Weasley. No, wait, I mean Ron. You were mean to Ron. He gave me a sandwich!"
"Before I give thisss..." the Dark Lord paused. His thin lips transformed into a nasty, cruel smile. "I have a tasssk for you."
"You're not wrong," Ron replied quietly. "Did you know Harry used to just stare at him across the Great Hall? "
"Because they do." Blaise nodded gravely. "And Ron, do you remember the scandal between the old Ministry of Magic and the Ministress of Magic of the Americas? Draco threw a hissy fit and got them slammed into Azkaban for child harassment and attempt of murder. All because he wanted a chocolate frog and Professor Snape refused to give any to him so he had to throw a temper tantrum."
Draco, used to hearing complaints like this from the younger Slytherins, waved him off. "Try and do it for a minute first. We'll be doing three sets right now to get you used to it. Then we'll move onto the next step of proper pureblood posture."
"And you," Harry repeated. Draco had no idea what he was talking about. "You told me about Wormtail and the Manor's guest— I'm going with you."
"Your papa only retaliated in kind," Draco did his best to explain, "so as the years progressed, so did the things we did to each other. By Sixth Year, I was breaking his nose for what happened to my father, poisoning his best mate through butterbeer, and threatening the life of his dearest mentor. Harry retaliated in kind, and the very fact that he even offered to help at all spoke volumes."
"Is that Draco?" she asked politely, pushing herself off the bed. She walked over, humming a little carefree tune.
Severus rolled his eyes, setting Draco's three day's worth of assignments on his desk. "You are very lucky that you only missed two classes. Any more and Narcissa would've had to hear a thing or two about your work habits."
He ignored the betrayal in Harry's, Ron's, and Hermione's eyes and focused on the pink pig in front of him instead. If he played his cards right, the entire situation could be resolved and Harry could get out of the room unscathed.
"You will be working with Remus Lupin and Sirius Black," Dumbledore said. "You should be comfortable with working with them."
Harry chuckled. "Stop blaming Missy for everything. She loves snapperfish. Besides, those two are your favorites."
He watched in amusement as his friends conjured their own magics and tested themselves with the the cuffs. He picked one up, admiring the molding of the cuff. As far as he was concerned, each affinity had a unique design to them. Each affinity had a different rune symbol present and, now that he had time for a closer look, he noticed how each one of them were painstakingly crafted through dragon fire.
"Don't try, Granger. Either he stops or I don't help you at all," Draco said. At Granger's curious look, he pursed his lips. "It's awfully creepy, and I have other matters to concern myself with that has no connection to Potter whatsoever. If he has a problem, please tell him to grow some balls and hex me instead of staring."
Harry stumbled forwards, about to give one of his friends the Blood Replenishing vial. But then Madam Pomfrey came running over, her shoes clicking against the cold tiles of the Hospital Wing. "Merlin, it hasn't even been two hours."
He patted the beast on the side and continued onward to the house. Remus followed his master eagerly, though he looked back several times to make sure that Draco was following.
Draco summoned the book from his bag, dusting the cover off nicely. "Professor, this is my uncle's journal concerning Hyacinthe Potter. I recently realized it would do the class more good if I were to let you borrow it."
"I did?" Then Draco shook himself loose from the thought. "Harry, stop it. I'm trying to speak with you."
Harry looked away but nodded. Even if he hadn’t admitted it, his current misery made it clear enough.
Serenity and peace hung in place of awkward silence as he strolled towards one of the more secluded tables of the library. They covered Draco like a protective, invisible blanket, allowing him to feel safe as he reached for a Transfiguration book. It helped that no one except the most diligent, more tolerant of his existence students of Hogwarts were there.
"Pretty sure she's going to hurt both of us," Harry replied, stopping dead in his tracks just seconds later.
"Really? I can think of another," Draco replied. "Perhaps she wants both of us to die horribly mysterious deaths."
"Merlin's beard, Harry," Draco snapped. Then he whipped his head towards Hermione. "Hermione, will you be my second in the duel against Harry and Blaise? You know how your idiot best friend can be incredibly impulsive at times? Well, he challenged me to a duel and practically told me I'd still lose with the greatest witch of our time. I obviously disagree."
"Merlin, am I dreaming?" Longbottom asked, his voice somehow filled with wonder and horror at the same time. "Did I just see Harry and Malfoy holding hands? Am I losing six galleons to Dean and Seamus? Was Ron really not joking when he said he, Harry, and Hermione became friends with Malfoy?"
However, before he could panic any further, his aunt Bellatrix and the other Death Eaters chased Harry and their friends out the room. Their footsteps sounded thunderous even as the noise faded so Draco refused to come out of hiding until he was entirely sure that everyone had left.
And he hated how Harry's eyes glinted with a knowing sense. Draco sighed. He knew he had to get it over with sooner or later, and if his friends wanted to be the first to maim him, Draco also knew that Harry would be there to help him. The Gryffindor seemed to be in a semi-good mood at the moment. Draco's tales of adventure must've amused him. Knowing that Draco could be an absurd child must be amusing to him.
Draco managed to keep his sadness in check by holding his hand under the table. He sent small smiles towards both him and Scorpius, joining in on the conversation as well.
"'The Knight and the Dragon'," he read aloud. He closed his eyes and let himself get swept away in the memories.
“Handsome doesn’t just describe you properly, Harry,” Draco said. “Even if it did, you’re much more than your looks. And I don’t love you because of your stupidly green eyes and your perfectly unkempt hair. You know I hate how you can move boulders with your eyes and frustrate me with your impossible to tame hair. No, I love you because you’re kind and honorable, and you care so much about the little things that it’s nearly impossible for me to believe how incredible you can be sometimes. Not only that, but everything you do, you do it for love. You hated me during Hogwarts because you loved your best friend. You fought in the war because you loved your family. You became a teacher because you loved children. You even proposed to me because you’re in love with Scorpius and me— and that’s saying quite a bit about how insane you are as well,” Draco huffed. “But, I don’t mind that at all. So if you think, for even one second, that I will one day ‘wake up’ and ‘realize that I can do so much better than you’, then I’ll be here to tell you to shut up. I already can do so many things better than you— baking and putting Scorpius and James to bed easily are just two examples— but there’s absolutely no one else I’d rather love. Do you understand that, Harry James Potter-Malfoy?”
"Relax," she laughed. "These are sights from other countries as well. The Paris section is only a few pages."
He was referring to how Dumbledore, in all ways that mattered, fattened Potter up: all those house points at the end of the year that made Gryffindor win the House Cup, allowing him to be on the Quidditch team despite it being against regulations, and encouraging his relations with people who adored him, who loved him. Draco used to be so jealous of him. He used to be so angry that Dumbledore took things that were rightfully his-- Slytherin's House Cup, breaking of records, flocks of admirers-- and he never realized that Potter had suffered so much for these small mercies. Not until his trial, that is, which was when Potter practically exposed himself and all his traumas and compared those to Draco's own issues to appeal to Wizengamot. And now Draco was only angry that Potter wouldn't leave him alone sometimes.
Potter shrugged. "It was pretty clear to me that it was important to you. Being more historically accurate to how Regulus might have been, that is. And since this is about your family, I thought that I should try to respect that. You would do the same."
"You could come to France with me," Draco proposed without thinking. He was as surprised as Harry was by his impulsiveness. "For a while, at least. Mother wishes to speak to you properly anyway."
So there he was: an eighteen-year-old who became the Savior of the Wizarding World, an idiot who could not remember some bloody information that he'd been studying religiously.
It was a lot of faith for a man who had fought with Draco for four and a half years and then got into a familial argument with Draco just a week before. Blaise shook his head.
It was obvious that his father was after the prophecy that was in Harry's hands. However, why would his father want a prophecy when he could easily access to the Ministry any day? And, in addition to that, how did it just happen to be Harry's and the Dark Lord's prophecy that Harry picked up? How did such an important prophecy just end up on the floor?
"Yes, yes of course," Blaise dismissively agreed. His scrutinizing glare was still trained on Harry.
But then his mother gave him gifts to console him: a shrunken trunk that Draco knew contained his belongings and two Black heirlooms. One of which got rid of the Dark Mark and belonged to a 'good man'. The ring symbolized that Draco was free to choose between the good and evil, and that those coerced onto the wrong side can start over and make their own choice.
Potter blinked, his lips slowly stretching to form a smile that he usually reserved for Weasley and Granger. The worried, guilty look on his face vanished. "Er, yeah. I mean, how could I not listen to what you were saying? You were there."
"Oh." Harry's face did this weird thing that Draco found nearly impossible to decipher. "I thought..." Draco hummed, quietly asking him to pass the ashwinder eggs. "Nevermind."
"I didn't do anything. Not yesterday, nor today. Perhaps he's angry due to someone else," Draco replied. His mind wandered to... the thing that'd happened the day before for a split second. He quickly tossed the thought out the window and asked, "Why did you assume I've done something? Isn't Potter always pissed?"
There was utter silence from Sirius, and Draco assumed he was giving Harry the 'bitch please' look. His mother did wear that very well whenever Severus claimed he did not enjoy Draco's constant pestering for chocolate frogs. Blaise did mention that Draco himself wore it well whenever Blaise claimed that he wasn't in love with Cassius. Perhaps it's a Black hereditary thing
Harry followed behind Dean, sizing people up to see if they were planning anything stupid. One man looked like he might— Harry makes sure to make a point by looming over him and scowling.
Giggling, she left them alone and made her way over to their other guests, smiling and chatting them up before sliding to Theo's side. The lanky Slytherin looked down at her in surprise, but handed her a blue cup anyways. "Party pooper."
But Draco was on the verge of breaking by Thursday morning, which was the day Blaise stormed to him, red with blood that was clearly both his and another person's, and demanded to know just what was so special about a color.
"I know," Draco cheekily responded. "Don't let Pansy hear you say that though. She'll never let me live it down. Merlin, I can just hear her voice now: 'Harry was right, you know; a few centimeters aren’t anything to brag about'. And then I can never get away with any height jokes with her."
Harry snorted. "In case you didn't notice, that house is way too big for one person. Besides, it can be our safe place. Not just mine." A pause. "God, that was cringey wasn't it?"
Potter shrugged, his smile lopsided and unsure. "Hermione did tell me to do that, but I thought it'd be weird if I was the only one going. I mean, it would really look like I was the only one who was messed up in the head."
"Ha!" Blaise snickered. "As if! I wrote Shacklebolt myself to ask some questions about what happens in the play."
Unable to help himself either, Harry grinned. "Do you think that I should ask him for a chocolate frog?"
He woke up one morning with the bed cold and empty, even with Remus occupying Harry’s usual spot. Once the dog noticed he’s awake, he barked and licked his chops.
Draco sighed as he passed him it. Then he turned back at the Idiot Duo Plus Granger. "Sirius apparently fancied muggle inventions and the like. I doubt you’re referring to him however. He’s an ex-convict, Potter. Anyways, if that’s all you needed from me…"
Draco's shoulders tensed, and he unconsciously gripped his left forearm with his right hand. "You'll need to be more specific, Harry."
"Draco!" Pansy all but cried. Blaise and Theo weren't as vocal about their relief, but Draco didn't miss the way that their shoulders relaxed and the way that their lips pursed into a deep exhale. Theo, in particular, appeared the most roughened up of the three of them. Draco wondered if he'd gotten in a fight on the way to the... Hospital Wing? Is that where he was? He could've sworn he was going up to the Astronomy Tower... "Salazar Slytherin— Merlin— Draco—where's Madam Pomfrey?"
Lovegood talked about nargles and wrackspurts, both things Draco had heard more than enough about to believe they were real too. At least, he hoped they were. Still, it was a weird subject to bring up. Obviously, it was very Lovegood of her, but no matter what Draco tried, he couldn't think of a good way to make an amusing performance from either creatures.
“You’re leaving already?” Draco asked, practically dead weight against him as he hugged Harry. His nearly translucent grey eyes seemed solemn in a way that nearly made Harry call off the raid. Alas, he restrained himself. “When will you be back?”
"Was that all?" he asked, suddenly aware that could change at any given moment. "Do you need me for anything else?"
Even with his cheeks flushing slightly, Harry rolled his eyes. "After Buckbeak attacked him, he was complaining about it for days. It'd be weird if someone didn't pick up on it."
Draco's head immediately shot up and he searched Harry's eyes for a possible explanation as to why he'd willingly leave Ron and Hermione. And then he glanced towards their table, realized they were learning about Amorentia today, and grinned widely.
"Is there something wrong with the way people think of me now?" Harry asked, his nose scrunching up adorably. "I mean, everything they write about me is absolutely bollocks anyways."
"Right. I believe I've forgotten to formally introduce you two. Harry, this is Adrian Montague. He's six feet of nothing other than 'git', but he bakes alright cakes. He's the sort of person to make depressive jokes and scream internally when the slightest thing doesn't go to plan. And Montague, this is Harry Potter. Now that you 've been introduced, stop referring to him as my bodyguard."
"Yeah, but I thought—" Theo cut himself off, his eyes fluttering shut. "I thought it might have helped better than that."
"Malfoy, I'm serious. Is someone threatening you to stay away from me? Is someone hurting you every time before or after we talk? Because that' not right. Me, Ron, and Hermione discussed it. We can help if that's the case."
He knew the Ministry. He knew how long they'd been trying to get their clutches on it— Draco couldn't help but feel a bit worried. If he remembered correctly, his father had mentioned how the Dark Lord was looking forward to the Ministry uplifting Hogwarts. He'd mentioned something about how they'd use it to infiltrate the castle when Draco failed. Not when.
"I know, but it's a risk I'm willing to take. Besides, didn't you once say that you'd rather have him pissed at you for the rest of his life instead of having to visit his headstone for the rest of yours?" Hermione challenged. "This is the risk you should be willing to take if there's any at all worth taking."
Harry was vaguely aware of Blaise, Ron, and Dean wandering off to check in with the rest of the crew (no doubt to pursue the village for any valuables), but he only had eyes for Draco.
from Astronomy, but he sobered up and realized he had been too busy being bored half the time to learn anything from the class. Therefore, he learned zero to nothing in comparison to Draco's vast knowledge.
"I'd activated our magical bond," Draco responded with a shrug. His palm was no longer tingling from where he'd cut in order to prove his mastery over the house. "I'm the master of the Le Havre safe-house. The bond doesn't allow the house to hurt me. Much like how the bond that you will form would protect you."
Draco's smirk transformed into a grin. He felt bad about how easily Ron abandoned his best friend. Only a tiny bit. "Where's your Gryffindor loyalty?"
"Oh… okay." He proceeded to read it with the smallest hint of hesitance, making the entry sound a bit less… strange, to summarize it. "How was that?"
, and he’d be damned before he was going to not be there when they needed him. Except this time, he truly did not want to go.
Draco sighed. There were many reasons why they were at Gringotts instead of the Malfoy Manor— one being that the Dark Lord who wants Harry dead was residing there— but Draco knew that he'd never be able to muster enough courage to talk to Harry about it. Instead, he said, "I have to make sure that the estate's wards will continue working for our friends without me there. I also need to strengthen security, and all magical house security advancements need to be either approved or implemented by the goblins here."
"I mean, I was, but not anymore. I'm more curious as to why you challenged our Prefect in the first place."
Perhaps... Draco would let her plan the wedding? It was always a hobby that she and Sirius (he'll never admit it obviously; Aunt Walburga would've cut off his long hair and traumatized him for life) shared whenever Sirius felt particularly withdrawn from Regulus. It was a comfort hobby for the both of them. Several of their wedding plans actually carried out, and the one that Sirius had contributed the most on...
Harry snickered and as he tugged Draco towards the Hospital Wing, he quietly wished if Harry would find he felt the same and snogged him within an inch of his life. Well... a bloke could hope, couldn't he?
"You've mentioned," Draco replied, a cheeky grin also gracing his features. When his eyes caught Pansy's tearful ones, his grin faded into a warmer smile. "I'm joking, Pans. I won't die any time soon."
Draco lifted the box's lid and picked up the tattered, old-fashioned journal. It was leather— the best kind to write in— and when he picked it up to take a closer look, he took notice of the neatly engraved words on the cover.
However, never a big fan of it, Blaise spoke up. "We should do something similar when we get back. Wager different things and see who wins."
"It's alright. I believe you can't be as bad at Potions as Theo can. It's rather easy, I presume. Just don't daydream about Pansy Parkinson when you're supposed to be aiding me," Draco teased, batting his eyes innocently as he turned towards Pansy's and Theo's table. Harry stifled a laugh when a pointed glare was shot towards them. "Oh, and do let me know if our dearest Harry can't read the list of ingredients on the board."
"Blaise!" Draco whispered when he noticed that his facial expression was still blank. He wondered what exactly his best friend saw when he was with Ron, Luna, and Longbottom. "What in Merlin's beard happened?"
"We acquainted then," Draco continued, "but it was more of a formality than anything else. Once at Hogwarts, we grew closer to those we liked."
He already thought he was past his quota of luck when Draco said 'yes'; a kiss was way past his expectations.
Brief recap from the last chapter: Draco decides to skip his dinner, thinks a bit about Harry and Vincent Crabbe, and strikes an unlikely deal with Hermione. She promises to get Harry to stop staring at him and being an overall creep, and in return, Draco agrees to help her just a little bit in Arithmancy. Of course, Hermione doesn't need the help, but she really wants the best grades possible.
Draco took another step to stand beside Harry, asking the house-elves to prepare the usual basket as the brunet stared a hole into the back of his head. When they popped away and back with a basket, Draco took it into his hands and turned towards Harry.
Draco glanced towards him, his attention not exactly leaving the Potions book set in front of him. "Yes, Harry?"
"You've read until the end then? I'm impressed," Draco said and hoped he didn't actually sound as impressed as he was.
Instead of doing as requested, Blaise plopped himself on Draco's bed. He hastily casted charms when Draco directed his glare to him. Then he floated his bag to sit alongside Draco's and patted the bed invitingly. "Come on, Draco. Sleep it off."
Thanks to the very contradicting opinions, it wasn't until much later did Draco form his own opinion of Sirius Black.
Montague sat down beside Draco, sliding him the slice. He didn't pile any food into the plate in front of him, which meant it was safe for Draco to assume he wasn't going to stay for the entirety of lunch.
"It's fine. You should finish the assignments," Blaise added, unknowingly going along with the plan. "Harry, you too. The quicker we complete them, the less we worry about them."
"We're not inside of Paris yet. This is the Malfoy safe-house in Le Havre, which is the outskirts of France.”
Harry appeared so pleased, Draco found himself smiling as well. "You can thank me with a trunk of chocolate frogs after you pass this term with an Outstanding," Draco said.
'd me. They don't believe that we're friends now, and even after I convinced them that we were, they don't understand why I'm letting you tell me what to do for the play. I tried to tell them about how I'm not doing it for you, I'm doing it to pay homage to Regulus' memory the way that I know Sirius would want me. After that, they only got more concerned because I've apparently been 'brainwashed by Malfoy'."
Even if he did, he knew that was a rotten rabbit hole to jump in. Because once Draco answers one of his questions, Potter would ask him more. He would ask for more and more and— and Potter already had his wand. He already had control over most of Draco's magic.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, the edges of his lips quirking upwards to express his amusement. "You really are impossible, Potter."
Harry sent in an application within a month after the decision, to which the newest Headmistress of Hogwarts, Minerva McGonagall, replied with good news. She reported that the position wasn't available until the following school year since she had just found a substitute professor for the subject, but that was fine with Harry.
"Your lie sucked," Draco replied, sticking his tongue out. "Besides, he's my godfather. I can't lie to him without facing repercussions. What if he revokes my chocolate-in-the-dorms rights?"
"Thank you for the journal, Malfoy. I will return it to you once I'm done noting the events. It should be done by our next meeting." Draco nodded. "Now, Potter, what can I do for you?"
"This isn't a battle to be won, Pansy." The sharp inhale coming from her didn't escape Draco's knowledge. "And I do. Of course I know. We've been fighting and arguing since first year."
"Yes." Harry started laughing. Draco hid a smirk behind his hand. "If you don't believe me, allow me to change your mind by telling you that Severus once claimed that I hated him because I asked him for candy. He thought that children who hated you would deliberately choose to annoy you by asking for something that you clearly didn't have. He also claimed that I mentally abused him into having a chocolate frog on hand at all times."
constrict your heart and pierces wounds into your lungs. You had a collapsed lung that miraculously healed itself after a single dose of Episkey, even though internal wounds are normally healed with two or three doses. Your blood pressure was also incredibly low, and you were on the brink of being beyond waking up. Quidditch should the least of your worries."
He didn't really look towards Ron to see whether or not he'd complied with his directions because his eyes landed on Harry. And suddenly Draco was feeling pretty sure he only owned one shirt. After all, Draco had never seen Harry wear anything other than the Hogwarts uniform (classes and Quidditch) or the grey t-shirt. He'll try to convince Blaise to make a shirt or two for Harry as well. Maybe he could offer to do a week's worth of homework?
And yet, even when seeing Hermione and Ron watching him like hawks, Draco takes a deep breath and makes his way over decisively.
He held his hand out for the rest of the papers, which Draco happily gave up in hopes of beginning what everyone else was already doing: rehearsing. However, their fingers touched briefly, and Draco was forced to look Potter in the eyes when the git refused to actually take the papers. The git had the audacity to look dazed, as though images were flying in front of him at the exact moment that they touched.
"With piano music of course. It's only natural," Pansy stated. "It's been quite a while since you played during one of my parties, yes? Do you mind performing?"
"No... no, actually it's alright if I talk to you here," Harry decides, his inside Gryffindor bravery takes hold of him. Draco stops, his eyes narrowing and piercing into Harry's very soul. "I was wondering what you were talking with Macmillian about?"
That was the third or fourth time Harry had asked him about a favorite of his. Draco couldn't really remember anymore.
Severus gave him one. His face contorted. He slammed his hands down on the professors' table and glared. "Why I ought to—"
She didn't know which was worse: the fact that he couldn't lie or the fact that he was trembling harder at the slight touch.
"Malfoy," he greeted with a light accent. He greeted Theo the same way as he slid next to the seat on the opposite side of Draco. "I hear you're hosting a party with Parkinson and... Granger, that muggleborn from Gryffindor, down in the dungeons. Valentine's theme?"
It was the sappiest thing he’s ever said in his life, but Harry couldn’t even find it in himself to be embarrassed. Because, right now at the very least, it was absolutely true. Later, he could try and take it back. Later, he could try to figure out what it meant that he’d
Draco had not been active in his Charms class since fifth year. Some time between then and now, Professor Flitwick had lost his marbles.
Ignoring the tightening in his throat, Draco laughed weakly. "Honestly, Harry, how can you be so daft? She wanted you to ask her to Hogsmeade."
“Don’t worry,” Harry said as if he could read Draco’s thoughts. “I’ll give you a tour in a bit. First, I wanna get settled at home, make sure you’re comfortable there, and maybe get a real meal in you. We won’t be going on another raid for a while, so there’ll be enough time for you to see everything before then.”
All he could focus on was some stupid inquires and how he was going to fail, and by failing, he was going to be disgracing his father, who was the son of a world-reknown potion brewer and was therefore a good brewer himself, and his mother, who was now-retired professor Slughorn's prized pupil.
Harry stood up wordlessly like a deafened soldier and began making his way towards the closet again. Draco stopped him halfway and forced him to sit again.
If he did, Draco wanted to know who his sources were and why the hell Potter reached out to his sources.
"Well, except that he's supposedly madly in love with some girl," Pansy drawled as if it was just another every day thing.
And so, Draco kicked Voldemort's head as hard as he could, summoning hellfire using the heat particles created by light and lighting it aflame just as it knocked against the far wall.
He took several steps back, his smile not wavering in the slightest as he walked closer to the door Draco was so eager to run out of moments before. It was surprisingly easy to make Potter smile, Draco realized. He didn't want to realize it, but it'd always been impossible for him to not notice any bit of information about Potter.
Harry looked up, his eyes pleading with Draco to say something. Already knowing that he was weak against Harry's eyes, Draco slowly sat down beside him on the carpet. Harry moved over to give him some space. Draco peered into the mirror, surprised when he saw a simple man in the mirror. Sirius had dark, wavy hair (like his mother) and kind eyes (like his mother), and Sirius didn't look very upset at all. Instead, he just looked disappointed with Harry's life choices and surprised when he saw Draco's face.
"And what do you want me to do with this information?" the professor asked. "I appreciate your explanations, but I don't suppose an explanation could make up for your classmates being distracted by unnecessary commentary and laughter."
"Well, I don't mind it as long as I get cake," Draco drawled. Granted, he'd first felt uncomfortable by the thought of a man's eyes on him, but now Draco feels nothing but flattered. Draco himself didn't have the moral high ground so— once he got over himself of course— he was pleased with Montague's affections. Even if it was not reciprocated. "Besides, you've already checked for jinxes, hexes, curses, all potions possible... even traces of magic. The cake is completely spell free, Blaise."
Draco was beginning to think Blaise had been sorted incorrectly. Blaise had never successfully manipulated someone before so it was quite a feat. Or maybe he has, but Draco was oblivious to it. His attention had always been on Harry since first year after all. And before that, Draco obsessed over other things such as music, astronomy, and French. Honestly, he knew he wasn't the best sort of friend for Blaise. The only thing he ever did for Blaise was set him up with Cassius, but even that was of the bloke's own doing.
"Harry," Draco greeted. He drew his wand back. "My apologies. I didn't know it was you. I reacted without thinking."
"Although I agree when it concerns his level of stupidity, I must ask you this: why do you insist on remaining oblivious?"
Wizards weren't entirely prejudiced against homosexual relationships, but Draco knew muggles were different. He'd heard a few muggleborns talking about it in the library once. Though Draco doubted it, the very thought of Potter disowning his already-dead uncle for loving another wizard was definitely going to piss Draco off.
"And you're the wizard equivalent of a Niffler," Draco drawls. "Overly excited, attracted to shiny objects, and spends too much time with their face planted in the Pitch."
It was easier said than done, however, and Draco ended up taking the table farthest away from where his peers were clustered. He set the parchment paper down on the table, staring at it for far too much time with a blank mind, and then quietly conjured an inkwell. When Draco put the pointed edge against the paper, he suddenly realized what he should do.
"Bullshit. He handed you a vial. It's colorless. Took weeks to brew," Blaise accused. Draco looked away sheepishly. He knows better than all of them that an entirely clear vial means that all the ingredients are of the highest quality, and that it means the difficulty of the potion was higher than required in NEWTs. "Theo takes care of you. And Pansy protects you. On the other hand, I don't even know what the hell you're sick with—"
Now that sounded absolutely ridiculous. "Why in Merlin's name would you have a non-moving portrait?"
Hermione and Ron nodded, although a bit reluctantly. Draco knew they were hesitant to perform any type of manipulation, regardless of whether or not Harry's fate was involved, but he also knew he couldn't focus on explaining himself any further. He was practically itching for answers.
Truth be told, Edgecombe's mother really was in trouble with the Ministry. When the Daily Prophet had sent out its latest edition a week prior, Edgecombe had her mother's face splashed all over it. It was the only other thing circling the hallways other than whispers of the Valentine's party in the dungeons. Of course, this new edition didn't mention why she was newsworthy, but Draco was willing to bet Edgecombe didn't know either.
"Sure, we're not being smart," Pansy said. "Of course we're not. We're being stupid and reckless and utterly Gryffindor-like, but at least we're sticking to it. What exactly are you objecting? What are you afraid of, Draco?"
For some reason, he just knew that Potter was going to forget his copy of the script again and that they were going to have to press their shoulders together to read Draco's copy together. It made him feel strangely giddy inside, a feeling which Draco hated bubbling in his stomach. He skillfully avoided having this hatred from rising to the surface.
Draco handed the small box to Harry, whose beautiful eyes widened when he saw it. Then, pressing a kiss to Harry's forehead, he retired to bed and sobbed until sunrise.
for Harry. When the goblin nodded, Draco casted a quick healing charm. "Acceptable proof by your standards?"
He could be playing the piano or kicking his father's arse at Quidditch right now, but he had to be stuck sorting out things with 'sentimental value.'
Pansy winked. "Or simply strip. Money or no money involved, people will stop and admire a gorgeous body."
But he couldn't do anything more than watch as his boyfriend approached the Dark Lord with nothing more than enhancers slapped on his wrists and a stick in his skinny hand. Draco resolved to order more armor from Alois for Harry if he survived this.
"I think I understand." They sat in uncomfortable silence for several minutes before Draco summoned his courage and asked, "It helps then?"
"No!" Harry exclaimed forcefully. "No, it's not that. Of course it's not. And— and you aren't a Death Eater."
"It scars?" Harry asked, unable to help himself from taking another step forward. He swallowed thickly and tried to not let the tears cloud over his eyes. He didn't know why he was crying, but all he knew was that he felt a deep remorse and wanted to repent. "I'm sorry. I'm so sorry."
In the midst of it all, Harry pushed past Pansy and Blaise, kneeling beside Draco's bedside as well. Several Slytherins— who Blaise couldn't remember the names of for the life of himself— cleared a path as soon as they realized who he was. Theo, on the other hand, barely glanced upwards. Like he already knew Harry was going to fall to his knees as soon as he saw him.
"That's what your father said about your mother once." Sirius let out a soft, tearful laugh. Merlin, if that wasn't a major stab to the chest. "I wish you luck then."
He ignored Vincent's strange behavior and obsessed frantically over the one item that could guarantee his family's life. And that irresponsibility indirectly led to Vincent's death. It was Draco's fault, and that's why he felt so guilty about it.
Narcissa planned on following through with that. She was willing to risk everything for her son— something that she'd been too cowardly to do for her cousin. She silently hoped that Sirius was doing alright wherever he was, and then pushed open the door to Lucius's study open.
Draco shrugged, not really thinking of it. He ignored how Hermione tried to threaten him by wiggling her eyebrows. "I suppose it means I'm always right then."
If he and Harry talked and decided to do anything— and that's a major 'if'— there was so much that could go wrong with it.
"I don't want anyone," Theo replied, turning away from him and Pansy. To anyone else, he might've appeared dismissive of the idea as a whole, but Harry saw Theo's ever-growing blush and the way the tips of his mouth quirked up into a shy smile. Harry heard the complete phrase Theo didn't say: 'I don't want anyone who's not Pansy.'
"What did you used to do?" Harry asked quietly. He wanted to know everything about him. Well, everything Draco was willing to tell him. "Before Hogwarts? Before everything?"
But it was too late. Pansy and Theo's minds have finally caught up to what their friends said. They blushed, glanced at each other, and then quickly turned away. Blaise pursed his lips, throwing Draco the 'now you see what you've done?' look over his shoulder.
The best and worst part of the whole thing was that Potter looked furious. It reminded Draco that he shouldn't be laughing at Potter's expense simply because of how he could be tossed in Azkaban for it. But at the same time, it made his hysteria even worse since he wasn't supposed to be laughing.
"I'd feel a lot better if you weren't suffocating me with your jacket," Draco mumbled, feeling oddly tired now.
Draco nodded. "Yes, that is all there is to it. No worries, you will get the hang of it rather quickly, Potter. You simply need to practice."
"Not if I have anything to say about it." Draco had thought about the picture of Hyacinthe and snorted. He stepped forward into Potter's personal space, his hands shooting up to feel the texture of the hair. "Potter, do you even brush your hair? It's filled with knots."
Even Google ships Drarry and I just— it's a reason to celebrate I think! And so I've decided to write from Harry's POV just for that ^w^
Before even knowing what to name it, Draco fell in love with it. With the baby Hungarian Horntail Potter gifted him.
Draco raised his left hand to his face, wiping some of his tears away with nimble fingers. He turned to lay on his left side, facing the door instead of Harry. He quietly cried, taking deep, shallow breaths in order to prevent himself from making too much noise. He mourned for his mother.  She wouldn't even know what had happened. One moment, she'd be sitting in the Drawing Room and doing one of her many hobbies, and the next, she'd learn her son was dead.
"...no." He let out an audible sigh of relief. "However, this does put us both in an odd situation."
"No problem," Harry replied, stuffing his hands into his pockets. "What's making you think that anyone's watching us anyways?"
Draco couldn't ignore the way that his heart fluttered at that. Although he wasn't one for theatrics (not that much anyways), Draco felt pleased to hear someone say that to him. He already knew it, obviously, but hearing it from someone was nice. Well, maybe it'd felt nice because it was Harry telling him that. Had it been Boot or someone Draco didn't particularly fancy, their bollocks would've been hexed off.
"If you like it so much, why didn't you take it?" Harry asked curiously, snapping Draco out of his thoughts.
They took another door to the Hall of Prophecies, where the orbs glowed even brighter, and took a left turn before reaching the far side of the hall.
"Harry Potter," Draco stated clearly. "Son of the late James and Lily Potter. I relinquish all claims of the Le Havre estate to him."
"I know, Harry. You're not like that. I accept your apology." He slowly got out from underneath the table, holding out a hand for Harry to take. "Let's go stop Pansy and Blaise from planning your murder."
"Yeah. Emphasis on 'before.' Draco, I am not going to forget how he hurt you in Sixth Year," Blaise declared.
"You've gone mad, Potter. That's the only plausible reason," he finally muttered, but his small smile was everything.
Pansy and Theo had already been visiting the library occasionally to complete their homework or to research Draco's curse.
"What? Mate, he's one of the smartest blokes in school. You should've told him right after you told us."
"Merlin, it's a wonder you manage to remember anything at all," Draco murmured. A few of their friends snickered. "Alright so you forgot about other, more safer methods of contact. Why were you contacting him in the first place, love? What happened? Is he alright??"
Good afternoon y'all. I'm just a teeney-tiny bit tired today since I just took my first driving instructing class. I've finally got my permit, but whoever it is that decided we should pay for driving classes ought to be questioned for his or her sanity. I've got no more cash in my wallet, but... well, I'll always got a sister who could pay stuff for me! XD
"Draco?" Montague's voice was silvery. Draco shook himself of his thoughts, smiling weakly. "Are you feeling faint?"
She waved off the protective charms, which Draco had taught her how to, and stepped inside. As per usual, Pansy took a critical hit upon noticing that
The first three days of Draco just listening to his friends' conversation passed by without the slightest hitch. Pansy had originally thought there was something wrong with him, but Draco was quick to soothe her worries by saying that he was worried about the grade he'd receive in Charms. After that, Harry just quietly led him to their table in the library and let him sit there, quietly admiring the carvings, instead of wallowing in his silence. And each time they returned, the subject was completely forgotten.
"Thank you." Pansy jumped out of her hiding spot. "I'm surprised Blaise didn't jump in and offer to conjure some flames to make the damage much worse."
And our magic's reaction to the love sacrifices must have demanded for us to return the sacrifice. So when we love someone as much as our mothers love us, or when we are willing to do anything for that person, our body begins to slowly sacrifice itself through a connection to the original sacrifice. As such, we had Hanahaki because the people who sacrificed themselves for us— our mothers— had floral names. Magic wants us to remember the sacrifice by letting it be the one thing that kills us."
But, of course, Harry’s just jealous because he thought that Draco would fawn over him more than he fawns over Harry’s family
As per usual (since the last chapter), please let me know what you guys think about either my writing or the plot! I'd be happy to answer questions if you have any as well! Thank you for reading and see you next update! <3
"Not to sound egoistic, but I don't need one," Draco replied. "As you said, I am at the top of class. Why would I study with someone else when I'm perfectly capable of studying by myself?"
Harry scrunched up his nose. 'You're beautiful. Will you think I'm in love with you if I say that? Will you hate me if I say that?'
Draco stopped and stared at him, unsure of whether Harry was pulling his leg or if he truly was an idiot. The sides of his lips curled into a small smirk that he quickly schooled.
Harry nodded. "I just realized I didn't get you back for telling me things about your family. I mean, I told you about Sirius, but that doesn't really count. So..."
He smirked when he recalled the event. Blaise had bitched the whole time, but he ended up stealing the most materials. Theo had stood guard and practically screamed 'Mother Morgana' when Severus began to retreat to his sleeping quarters. And Pansy, who had been the one who immediately agreed with Draco's insatiable want for potioneering hacks, had ripped her cloak into a long string so they could safely escape. However, Severus had caught up to them fairly quickly.
"Just watch as it becomes one hour every week," Blaise drawled. Then he frowned. "Would that mean you and Granger could be considered to be 'friends'?"
"Hey. How am I the pain if you're the one encouraging me by laughing?" Harry replied. "If anything, you're the pain."
"No shit," Draco drawled lazily, his eyes glazing over with boredom. On that day, Draco had just heard about Sirius Black, who his mother had been particularly fond of when they were younger. Draco hadn't understood what she meant when she said that Sirius 'was her best friend' so Draco had brought it up with his usual companions. His friends practically shot up with surprise. Pansy, especially, had gone all mother-hen on him and burst into tears as she wailed that she'd thought they were best friends this whole time. "So I suppose that unless that particular person spoke to me of it..."
"Yes, much more pleasing now," Draco said. Then he closed some distance between them. "Now, another important thing to consider as a supposed pureblood, is how you walk and speak. Since your speaking is covered by the script, you will only need to think about your walk."
Draco stared at him, thinking to himself how presentable of a pureblood Potter would have been had his father not married a muggleborn.
When Draco and Harry begin speaking with Lucius and Narcissa, Harry's a bit nervous because a rather pathetic
Harry hesitated, seemingly debating with himself for a moment or two. "Alright, well you're sucking the life out of me right now. Come on."
"Just something to think about, Granger," he said quietly. For some reason, he felt like his little emotional outburst was going to be the hot topic tomorrow morning. Not that he would be there to witness it. Draco was be a shut-in at the Slytherin Commons. "I'll be leaving first. Get Potter to stop staring at me and I'll tutor you. One hour only."
Harry settled in, putting away a few of his things from the boat, and grabbed a snack for his and Draco to share. The whole time, Remus weaved around Harry’s legs. It’s a wonder that Harry hadn’t tripped over the dog yet.
With that, the Golden Idiots sat down at their table awkwardly. While Weasley pretended as though his hands were more interesting, Granger and Potter looked at everywhere except for Draco's direction. Which pretty much meant that they were spying due to his petty, blond ass. Draco sighed and dabbed his quill in the inkwell, continuing to formulate ideas for his monograph.
"Oh." Draco thought back to when he realized he was in love with Harry, flushing slightly when he remembered that he'd had a panic attack not even a few seconds later. "If it makes you feel better, our walk together in France is when I realized it was you."
"I know," Draco huffed. Then he wandlessly closed the book, set his glass down, and cradled Missy in one arm as he made his way to the kitchen. He placed Missy in her sleeping cradle, shooting a small burst of magic so it would rock gently on its own.
Their wedding occurred three years after the proposal due to some difficulties at the Auror department.
Anyways, before Draco and Harry exchange their vows, the 'pre-party' starts as per Pansy's insistence. In reality, it's just everyone dining and congratulating both of them.
"Or," Harry rudely interrupted, "don't take any at all! Aren't you at least a tiny bit relieved he's okay?"
The moment they disappeared from Draco's peripheral vision, the blond perched himself back on top of the desk.
Half a dozen Vikings descended the bluffs and headed straight for him. There was no doubting their intentions, but Draco was barely able to force his legs to work. With very wobbly legs, he sprinted back to the village. Perhaps, if he got close enough, he could cry out for help and someone would graciously rescue him under the guise that this would grant them good favor with Lucius.
Jaw dropped, Potter stared at him stupidly. "No way. You don't know what the LGBTQ+ community is? I didn't know myself until this summer so I really shouldn't be acting like this, but still. You don't know what it is?"
Something in Blaise's eyes soften. With one step, Blaise closed the distance between them, allowing Draco to rest his forehead against his shoulder. "Of course I will. I'm not leaving you. Pansy would feed me to the wolves."
"I can feel my stomach bloating just by looking at it," Draco comments when the pies arrive. He picks up the fork anyways, taking a bite so quickly Harry thought he would miss the movement if he'd blinked.
Potter was still strangely quiet and docile when they left the office, not even complaining when Draco set him down. He only looked up with sad eyes and nuzzled his nose into Draco's side calf. It was as though he was apologizing for getting Draco in trouble in his own little adorable way. Even though Draco wasn't in trouble— it was still quite difficult for him to comprehend— he knew that if he was, he wouldn't be able to stay angry at Potter for long.
"I'm sorry," he repeated, pouring as much melancholy and self-hatred as he could possibly manage without physically combusting.
“It was only a matter of time before they wormed their way into our already-condensed world too,” Malfoy said, his words no louder than a whisper as he continued. “They seduced our ancestors, claimed to love them, then they threw them away without embracing
However, there was a part of him that was disgusted by the very thought of a wizard being with another wizard. Draco didn't understand at all. All he could think was:
"Not really," Draco dismissed. "I didn't truly think much of it until I saw you all lined up together and began making assumptions today."
"I'm sincerely planning to commit homicide," Draco huffed. "It is ridiculous, and I'm still in shock. But we made a deal and—"
Draco heightened his guards and raised his wand with his left hand, his limbs remembering before his mind how identical this peculiarity was to when Harry had quieted in that room in the Department of Mysteries the day prior to his return. A part of him expected Voldemort to come waltzing into the hallway and launch yet another attack at Harry even though a much larger part of him understood that Voldemort couldn't physically come back to hurt them.
Harry snapped his attention to the other end of the hall. He sat on a chair, raised up on a platform as though it were a throne, and watched idly as Harry crossed the distance between them.
"You safely assumed it wasn't," Draco finished. "That, I understand. But 'a potion gone haywire'? Blaise, how long have you known me?"
Pansy smiled while Blaise and Theo tried to hide their snickers. Hermione and Ron had no problem with laughing out-loud at Harry's expense. "Shut up, Malfoy."
"Very funny, Malfoy," Harry snorted. Their essays now abandoned, they lounged lazily against the bleachers. "I'm serious though. Nobody has given up so you shouldn't either. And, yeah, nothing's come up yet, but if there's anything you and your friends can do... it'd be creating another potion or cure or something like that in order to increase your social statuses and number of vaults or whatever."
"After the argument?" Hermione asked. "Or after Draco suddenly stopped talking about the... you know."
If they looked at this rationally, maybe this Hanahaki thing would be spread to the other person. After all, that's how diseases are spread.
Harry let out a frustrated sigh. He reached his left hand up and messed his already-messy hair even more. "You're so— you're so oblivious! And you call me 'naïve'!"
Harry was the more clingier of the two of them, always sobbing whenever Draco had to meet with foreign ambassadors. Well, he didn't
But, as it was not his place to do so, Draco never let himself fathom too long over them. And yet. Now that Harry was no more than a few inches away from him in, Draco took notice to how incredibly skinny he was... Almost as skinny as Draco was, and he was different since he simply couldn't stomach much more than a few meals without daydreaming about Harry or wondering about the blood that he sees ever morning.
He shut his eyes and remembered how he'd been the last one to know about Draco's pain. He remembered how it felt like a million insignificant betrayals rolled into one because a million insignificant things become really significant when delivered in one blow.
Like all the other nights before, Draco laid on his bed without the slightest hint of falling asleep. He had no doubt that sleep would never come by him again. It's been too long since he's had a good night's sleep, and that definitely wasn't about to change. Sighing, Draco stared into the silver ceiling and imagined how it'd feel to be crushed by debris and broken tiles.
Potter's sigh was oddly believable. "Then why are you here? Torment someone else like your brother does."
"I don't think I'd like to tell you anymore," Draco huffed. "You're being a complete and utter twat."
“To see the legendary not-really-a-couple couple get married after Harry Potter, son of hilariously stupid Professor Potter and beautifully strict Professor Potter, makes a dumbass mistake that turns out to have an incredibly well ending, you lucky bastard,” most of them say.
The two of them turned to him, looking comical with how they appeared confused to see him even though Harry had been the one to come looking for him in the first place and Draco had told him to shut up twice.
She droned on and on about the rules for the exam— everyone in the class were more than just well-acquainted with them, but it was apparently required to continue speaking of them anyway— as Harry became more and more nervous for the exam. He fiddled with the end of the quill and bit his bottom lip, bouncing his right foot and trying not to literally scream because he didn't really need 'Deranged Savior' as another one of his infamous titles.
Once the three sets were done, Draco nodded at Potter and said, "Now is the most important step for you to understand: the matter of the head."
Usually, Draco would be wallowing in self-pity whenever he felt like his chest was about to burst because of the ever-growing flowers in his lungs. Well, he wouldn't be
Draco could only hope Granger was here to study peacefully. Preferably twenty meters away from him. After all, Granger had a mean slap— one that rivaled Pansy's— and Draco would rather jump to a different table than risk being slapped by the witch.
Two hours later, when their first dance and dinner toasts were over with, Harry began to get a bit fidgety. He stared a bit too long at the two chairs they left empty for James and Lily Potter, sighing often enough that even Narcissa noticed. She pulled her son aside and gestured to his now-happily-wedded-husband. Draco followed the gesture and quickly rushed over to him.
Harry's eyes softened, suddenly appearing as though he was remembering somethin from a long time ago.
Draco arched a brow. "Blood status and inheritance aside, he's a brilliant wizard, amazing Quidditch player, master of the violin, loyal without faults, and honorable when it comes to his word. Are you sure he's not your type?"
Obviously all of the professors see Harry so smitten and does absolutely everything in their power to put them together for every project.
"What? Ron didn't laugh at you!" Potter insisted. Then his eyes widened and he imitated a frozen goldfish. "Oh Jesus, he
He mentally cursed himself for giving Potter a hint as to where he was going to be, but he forced himself to act as if he didn't care while he walked away from Potter.
"I was reading," Draco repeated. "It was late when I realized I needed to complete my homework. I don't need a draught to sleep."
"Chang," Draco greeted back. He narrowed his eyes, wondering what the hell she wanted with Harry. Valentine's was over and DA meetings weren't scheduled for another few days. If the date had been moved up, Draco's fake galleon would've let him know of it. Whatever she wanted, it couldn't have been good.
Draco shivered, remembering how Lucius had more or less auctioned him off to the nearest wealthy family. He almost instantly became the fifth in a long line of young husbands Astoria had kept and then lost in tragic-- and suspicious-- circumstances. It took him only one day to realize why: he’d been hit and beaten and burned on their wedding night, hurt in all the ways Draco feared from his father but never actually had to endure.
"Shit, I really thought you had forgotten about it," Harry huffed. "I even complimented you for Merlin's sake."
"Stop it," Harry shushed. He redirected all of his attention to Draco, making him feel as though he was the center of the universe. "And I'm pretty sure you heard what Ron said earlier."
Hermione had obviously just come back from wherever she spent her time studying— Ravenclaw, probably— and if Ron got wind of it, he'd complain that he never got enough time with Mione before she had to leave again.
Anyway, here's the brief recap that I now deign regular: Draco is a bit shaken about how casual Harry is being about , but it leads to them having an awkwardly romantic situation and Draco receives a package from Pansy and his mother that contains a journal that contains the mysterious connection between his family and Harry's family in the previous generation. The connection which, of course, we will be exploring in this chapter!
Draco pushed away his empty plate. He shivered, his eyes watering at the thought. All the Slytherins— those who'd noticed how odd he was being at least— watched as he stood and left the Great Hall, but they looked away before they caught sight of an alarmed Gryffindor chasing after him.
Harry will carry this secret to the day that he dies, but seeing Draco Potter nee Malfoy so happy because of him and his family pleases him so much.
And although Blaise knew the password to the Gryffindor Towers— he, Theo, Pansy, and Draco all did— he pounded his fist against the wall so harshly, he knew he was waking at least somebody up.
"We'll bring materials with us during those days." Pansy waved Theo's worry off. Then she looked at Draco, her eyes softening. She reached over and held one of his hands. "We'll find that something or someone, Draco. We'll see to it that you do all the things that Blaise had just said."
“Good.” Harry gathered up the remaining food and put it back in the chest. Wiping his hands on his britches, he looked down at Draco with a smile. “Lover or not, I’d like to keep you around. It gets lonely back home by myself, and a companion would be perfect.”
“You got a stick up someplace indecent, Theodore? He’s Harry’s. Walk away or prepare to get a sword through your belly when Harry gets back.”
"Yes and no," he said, fidgeting with his fingers. "As it had come out during my trial, I had taken the... Dark Mark to spare Blaise and Pansy from the Dark Lord. He'd wanted them in his circle to punish their families for their lack of loyalty and participation during the first war. But he was also angered towards my father, who had failed in a personal mission. So when I traded myself for them. To protect them. And I couldn't bear to think of them being... dead. So it struck a chord to hear Goldstein—"
"If you finally woman up and snog Theo, yes. Merlin knows the only people who have no idea about the sexual attention between you two are you and him," Draco said.
He grumbled profanities as he pushed each door open, wandering into them briefly and searching for traces of familiar magic signatures. When there was none, he walked out. And when he finally found one, Draco stared blankly at the sign above the door.
"None of this was here last night," Harry was muttering. His hands scooped up some of the flowers and Harry tossed them carelessly to the side. "I swear. Last night, Draco got drunk off two cups of butterbeer and tried to steal half of the chocolate display Vince and Greg got out; and he definitely should've been sick since he had the butterbeer on an empty stomach, but he wasn't. Disappointed, maybe, but not sick. Draco wasn't sick at all."
It actually cheered him up to find a house in such a state; Harry might never get a willing lover from him, but he could take care of the house, be useful, and not get thrown back to Lucius.
Even if it wasn't, something else stopped him from being ignorant and fucking off. He— and Blaise would definitely back this up with a grin— was a selfish attention-whore.
Draco forced himself to lock eyes with Potter, fighting with everything he got against guilty memories that threatened him. "Are you an idiot?"
listened to him. When he expressed so, Potter scowled lightly. It was the only familiar thing Draco had encountered this entire conversation. If he was honest, Draco would admit that he didn't think he'd last so long without being hexed or cursed.
Harry slowly nodded, getting up from his chair and heading towards Severus. Once he was out of earshot, the unexpected happened.
"Maybe later, Hermione. I have to tell you before I forget and begin to think rationally," he rejected politely.
Harry thought Draco was a git and vice versa. Not to mention how Harry had suspected him of being a Death Eater for Merlin's sake!
"Go to class before your Weasley and your Granger sic themselves on me," Draco said. "We'll meet whenever we can to practice our lines. We'll begin on Thursday night after dinner in two weeks. My schedule will be packed with quizzes and tests, and I expect the same for you. We'll meet on the Quidditch Pitch."
"You should speak to him during lunch," she said. "To my understanding, you don't share a lot of classes with Potter."
Blaise sighed at that, reverting to his usual nonchalance. "Draco, you know being Potter's friend isn't a good idea."
"Harry, every year, you come back in the same grey shirt. I think it's safe to say that it is a horrible punishment."
Potter frowned. "We talked about this last week, and we agreed that you were 1) an ex-Death Eater and 2) a child in war acting under duress."
All he knew was that the history books he read at school were right. He hadn't believed it because his papa had seemed so alive during his defense classes and when they were at home. But now the evidence was staring right at him.
"This— wake up!" Theo hushedly demanded, at Draco's side not even two seconds later. He slapped his cheeks twice. "This isn't fucking funny, Draco! Wake up!"
He sighed again. "This is a classic, political move. Umbridge and the Ministry would be fools if they decidedly hired another Headmaster. No, politically, it'd be best for them to simply keep one of their own stationed in Hogwarts. Preferably with high status like Umbridge."
"Aren't you going to be helping the rest of us up, Potter?" Blaise huffs as he passes them. Harry ignores him in favor of smiling a bit wider into Draco's eyes. "Merlin forbid he helps one not of self-interest."
And that's when Harry knew he was in love with Draco, who laughed so freely and beautifully at his stupid comments.
“C’mon.” Harry didn’t wait to see if Draco was following. He just shouldered his bag and stepped away from the dock. “I’ll show you my place.”
One minute, she was talking about Hyacinthe having the Dark Mark, the next, she's talking about his dead uncle. And now she was talking about romance?
He made Draco feel like he was worthy of redemption, of love, of happiness regardless of their brutal history. It was rejuvenating to have someone who had seen the darkest, most awful parts of him and still claim to love him.
"Harry wouldn't. He just thought that Draco was a major git," Hermione consoled. "Or that he was 'up to something', for a reason I could never understand."
Harry was just... repeating his name and hugging him like a touch-starved child. Not that Draco knew what being touch-starved by his mother and father felt like.
Harry's shit-eating grin widened and Draco knew something in his expression must have given him away because the prat Harry laughed. "You hate admitting it, don't you? That I was right?"
He continued to walk, pointedly ignoring how the trees seemed to loom over him in an intimidating manner. However, when something lightly colored caught his eye, Draco turned and raced to find it. The light didn't want to be found, however. It kept running away each time he drew near, twisting around and dodging his every attempt to snatch it.
But because his boyfriend was off doing something he knew his boyfriend wasn't exactly sure of doing, Blaise would have to blend in with the background and inch out of the room without Harry or Draco noticing.
Draco ran towards the approaching brunet, threw himself into Harry's arms, and then whispered, "I have something to tell you."
There was a noise of barely concealed frustration. "Hand over the prophecy and no one needs to get hurt."
Severus ignored him, which wasn't a surprise in Draco's opinion while it was in Harry's. "Draco, I'd like for you to
He saw the blood and flowers before they even left his mouth, but he didn't move until they all left Draco's lips. It was unnerving, watching someone's mouth fall open and blood run down the sides of his chin until bloodied flowers were finally plunging out. But, Harry wasn't going to move until Draco woke up for real.
"Obviously not. I'm Draco," he joked, earning one of Harry's sassy, yet amused eye rolls. "But I'm not jesting. I understand it sounds odd, especially since I practically muggle-shamed Hermione and demonstrated a particular hate towards Muggles, but it's true. Can't you think of how much more simple our lives would be if we weren't wizards?"
Both of their grins simply widened. They then exchanged another brief round of goodbyes before Draco went off to bed, mind still boggling at the fact he was capable of being so happy.
Pansy's entire body trembled with the intensity of her next deep breath. Her fingers curled to form tiny fists, which did not look intimidating at all. Nope, of course not. Draco was totally alright with seeing his best friend pissed off. He was completely alright.
Now, Potter was a termite and Draco wanted to set fire to whatever stupid tree Potter was living on.
"Yes, I'm sure," he mindlessly replied. He rolled the piece of parchment up and handed it to Blaise. He patted around for that Black heirloom his mother gave to him— the one that supplied him with whatever he needed. Draco had never tried using it before, but he would be willing to give it a try to avoid touching non-silk material for longer than and few minutes. He cursed lowly when he didn't find it.
“It’s not nothing, Harry.” Hermione walked past him and took over Blaise’s seat on the bench. “You need me. That’s never nothing.”
Let me just say that I know from past experience that it can and will lead to some people getting hurt.
He had no idea whether she was furious with him or if she was disappointed in him, but he knew he'd have to vie for her good graces if he didn't want this incident to be reported to the Ministry. The Ministry, which would, by the way, throw him into Azkaban for the lightest infraction. And Pansy would have his neck and his heritance if he was thrown back into the prison.
"Don't ask. I don't even know. I think he understands you, you know? Or at least what it's like to be where you are."
He tugged Harry back when Harry attempted to move out of his grasp— why he would want to do that, Blaise didn't understand. At least, not until Harry hunched over and proceeded to heave out a small pile of flowers. It sickened Blaise, but it didn't seem to bother Draco all too much.
Clearly, this man was in charge. The captain or leader or whatever title the Vikings gave to such a person.
He cleared his throat then, putting the script back into his bag and sending a pointed look at the still dazed Potter.
Draco wondered how Potter had managed his classes so far, but then remembered that Granger was usually there to berate him. Now that Granger was too completely focused on studying and refused to get into any of Potter's odd shenanigans, there was no wonder Potter didn't decide to do something for himself.
And when the Dursleys had to pick him up, they had to be nice to him. They had to pretend to care about him.
Besides, if the press caught wind of it, their discussion would going to be the talk of the century. Draco could just see the Prophet's headlines now: 'Harry Potter: A Bottomless Pit Of Tragedy? Malfoy Heir Has To Teach Him Pre-Spell Skills!' Merlin, if that actually happened, Draco wouldn't know if he should laugh or cry.
Blaise— the bastard— laughed. And, as if he didn't think that was enough to piss Draco off, the bastard had the audacity to turn the chair around so he could laugh at Draco in his face.
"Oh. Yeah." Harry paused. "I know you said you'd think about it when I brought it up last time, but it's been a few weeks and you haven't said anything. So... I want to ask you if you'd want to come with me next time. Y'know, since you see that it actually helps now, maybe you'd want to try for yourself."
Tears threatened to tip over, but Narcissa managed to hold herself together for her son. "Why have you visited? I didn't expect you for a few more months, Draco."
“Yes, Draco,” Harry replied, his voice cracking. Once again, he buried his head in Draco’s neck. But this time, he let out small sobs. “I love you so much. Don’t leave me.”
Draco gasped. "I'll have you know Montague makes an excellent cake. You should be honored if you receive the opportunity to be him," he scolded. Then he playfully bumped their shoulders together. "So why does our dearest Harry want to be 'literally anyone' else?"
Because now, instead of being done with most of his homework, Draco had a sketched pair of eyes that gazed into the very depth of his soul, making him feel naked even though the pairs of eyes were stuck on paper and couldn't jump out.
"Not much. My dad died before he could teach me anything. Or maybe he did, but I've lost whatever memory I have of him."
He knew Blaise was leaving to write a letter to Pansy concerning his immature outburst. He knew he was going to ask her how to coax him out to the Great Hall, something she'd done almost every day during Fifth and Sixth Year. Draco also knew Blaise was going to worry her by telling her what Draco had said; Pansy would expose him by informing him that Draco had never been bothered by people watching him eat before. After all, Potter had watched him eat enough times to make him be comfortable with ignoring any stares. Therefore, he wouldn't be bothered by people staring at him while he ate.
But over the past few years, Draco felt like he was protecting them by making himself a walking target. By openly opposing Potter, he gave off the impression that he was strong and capable enough to actually take on Potter in anything that the bloke wanted him to. No matter what. Whether it be flying (he never actually won), classes (only in a few, but Draco suspected Potter got by because of Granger), or social class (that's down the drain now), Draco knew he gave off the impression that he could take it.
Blaise continued. "— and I've also been a third wheel to you two and your attempts of being inconsiderately in love in front of me for even longer than that. So please excuse me if I would like to get out of this situation as soon as possible. I am very much pleased both of you are finally feeling better and finally got your heads out your arses, but I would really like to go downstairs."
"It helped that Theo fed us dittany constantly," Vince added, always the most quiet of the two. "I think he didn't want us to see you when you were sick."
If possible, Harry's beam brightened even more. It felt like Draco was staring into a sun he wanted to burn in.
However, before they could even try and begin to state the traditional vows, Draco interrupted them.
But then Regulus comes to visit and assist in DADA, and Draco idolizes him too for his strong will and incredible Occlumency shield. Harry gets so jealous that he starts glaring daggers at
Draco's head shot up, his silver eyes glittering with curiosity and excitement. "Gift?" he asked nonchalantly.
"There is no Bianca and Lucentio. Only a Katharine and her impulsive Petruchio," he replied. "Chardonnay. That is the password."
"If we were in the same situation as he was, you know Draco wouldn't give up on us. I'm not giving up on him," Theo snapped. "Now go get Harry."
He then triumphantly threw it down and crushed it, reveling in the blinding light that surrounded him and erased the dark and dreary demeanor of the woods. When he glanced towards where the wall and the totally-not-dangerous moat, he gleefully noted that the demeanor of those things had changed as well. Right when he was about to seek out the potioning advancements Severus had made, Draco remembered the horrible feeling of a mind intrustion.
But then the moment was ruined when Harry leaned forward. He cradled Draco’s cheek in one hand and drew his thumb across his lips to brush away crumbs. Even after, his hand lingered a moment longer than it needed to. Draco’s heart fluttered at the touch, but as soon as Harry pulls away, he’s hit with a sobering realization.
When they drew alongside the Viking ship, Draco was hefted on board. The bearded man, who was apparently his keeper, brought him up to the ship’s prow and tied him to it. It’s a curious prow at that. Instead of a dragon’s head or some other ferocious beast, it’s a deer with a long, curved horn. The craftsman responsible for it obviously meant for it to look fierce, but there’s something almost friendly about it.
"But... Pansy has done too much for me to ignore. I need to find a way to guarantee that she will be taken care of after I pass since I would not be able to do it myself. Yes, she snoops into other people’s businesses and yes, she's rather pushy and yes, she’s strong. I admit all of that with pride. However, she's not unbreakable. And, like me, she absolutely hates losing things. Whether she cared about it or not, she would be heartbroken and, therefore, I fear that losing me might do that to her. I'm not trying to boost my own ego, but I know that I mean enough to her to devastate her if she loses me. Honestly, I would feel the same way for her. The same deal goes with Theo and Blaise. Much like how you, Ron, and Harry would be hurt if you lost each other. Thus, I am willing to give you anything within my power. If you say you need knowledge, I will personally rewrite any and all knowledge within the Malfoy and Black vaults. I will do my best to guarantee what you want in exchange for your existence by Pansy’s side," Draco said. He raised his eyes to meet her brown, teary ones. "But, before I guarantee that, I need to clear this misunderstanding: I do not need your help for my sickness. I need your help in taking my seat as Pansy’s right-hand bastard. Or witch, if you will."
For some reason, Draco's heart stuttered in his chest. He glanced towards Harry, who now was staring up at the sky, and wondered if Harry knew just how romantic he sounded or how his words were affecting Draco.
Granger spoke about creature rights, which was certainly an interesting idea to bring up with the Ministry and Headmistress McGonagall. Even Draco couldn't think of a plausible story to weave around that subject. He supported it full-heartedly, but there was absolutely no way people would want to work for months on something that could easily be resolved by Potter and his influence on the Ministry.
"Then why didn't he admit it?" Harry asked, his voice even more harsher. Then his eyes softened. "Why couldn't he admit it?"
He glanced towards Potter, who was clearly more interested in his feet than Draco's self-evaluation. Draco let out an inaudible sigh of relief. "Right here?"
The rest of the short voyage, Draco either hid inside Harry’s cabin or behind him on deck. The crew stayed just as fearsome as before, but they paid him little mind. Every night, Draco was filled with a mix of dread and anticipation as he waited under the covers for Harry. And every night, Harry was a perfect gentleman who kept his hands to himself and stayed on his side of the small mattress.
Harry’s left eye twitches. Lucius cared so little for his son that he hadn’t even told these men his name, nonetheless how incorrect their descriptions were. Draco just turned twenty-three, he’s already six foot one, he has dashing silver eyes, and his hair isn’t just blond, it’s the white blond that shines under the moonlight and— Goddamn it.
The unfamiliar voice groaned. "Alright, whatever you're cheery about, it'll need to wait. Who's with you, pup?"
Half the village was there to greet them on the beach as usual. The Viking wives and their children were eagerly seeing the return of their families. A few others were there, hoping to offer their assistance to the Vikings in exchange for some of the loot they carried back for them as per usual. They weren't important though. Harry scanned the crowd for a pair of silver eyes under a mane of white-blond hair.
"Perhaps, when he's done crawling out of his troll bridge, he will," Draco said. He glanced around and confirmed that Blaise was not near them. Then he eyed her cup of alcohol. "I thought Theo had handed you butterbeer?"
And Draco didn't want to go back to Azkaban for assaulting the Prat Who Lived after learning about his homophobia.
"Which made it more amusing than it should've been," Draco replied. He snickered, remembering how Montague hadn't even cared. He'd shrugged and went away, only to return to his table two hours later with a delicious cake. If heartbreak led to delicious cakes, then Draco was pleased he'd helped in some way. Harry, though, wasn't and Draco rushed to reassure him. "There luckily weren't any hard feelings. He accepted my rejection and went on to create the best chocolate cakes in existence— is this dark chocolate molten by the way? I sense a bit of melted fudge."
Circling back around the village one last time, Harry was no closer to a decision than he had been before. Seeing no point in this fruitless exercise, he headed back home.
He would kidnap this man— perhaps, gain his admiration just as Lucius did with Hermione. He’d wrap this boy so thoroughly around his pinky, the boy wouldn’t even know which way was up and which way was down. And then, once he’d fully succumbed to Harry, he’d cast him out. Abandon him as publicly as he could and let the whole world see for themselves how horribly his fall from grace would be; and once he’s no longer the virtuous and dutiful son, the boy would bring shame not only to himself but to Lucius as well.
In turn, Draco confided in Potter about the horrid pureblood training he had to do when he was younger and how he'd felt incredibly lonely until he met Vince and Greg just a few weeks before their first year at Hogwarts. He explained his own guilt, starting by explaining that he didn't regret taking the Dark Mark because it ensured that his family was safe, and his self-discovery, which concerned how he didn't believe in many pureblood ideologies. On top of that, Draco confided in him about his mother's situation in France. Potter acted like he cared so well, Draco couldn't help but blabber on and on about her.
He didn't understand why Larissa didn't have to do anything either; all she did all day was butter up to papa by baking him his favorite desert, treacle tart, and read some stupid potion books in the library like a loser who doesn't have any friends or any respectable hobbies. She hasn't changed at all from that nerdy eleven-year-old who buttered people up to get better grades than Scorpius ever got.
Especially if you're in love with someone on what your parents and ancestors assume to be 'the other side'.
Draco rushed over, dropping onto his knees and cradling Harry's face with his hands. He pulled Harry onto his lap, brushing the thick, dark hair out of Harry's eyes.
"Regardless of what she was thinking, she fulfilled her part of the bargain." Not completely, but Draco had felt the most free in these five minutes without Potter glaring at him from across the room. The action in and of itself was a bloody miracle. "Therefore, I have to do mine."
Pointing to the Slytherin mentioned, Pansy rolled her eyes. "Nice to know where your priorities lie, you bastard."
"Afternoon Harry. Weasley. Granger," Draco said anyway. For all he knew, Harry could have had a run-in with one of his many stalkers-slash-fans before lunch. It was the most plausible reason that he could think of, seeing that Potter was in the kitchens for the meal and not in the Great Hall.
"We wouldn't be," Pansy muttered. "If we see you in a comatose state again, Draco, I don't think we would be able to take it anymore. You mean too much for us to gamble with."
It took Draco's entire willpower to not beat Blaise with the book. "Funny. I think I should do the same thing, but with me trying to be like you. In other words, I choose to become a blubbering, buffoon-like bastard."
"Sorry, that wasn't a good word to use. I mean, it was a bit poetic. You know, the whole 'I'll sacrifice myself to save you from it' trope. It's used a lot in muggle books."
Some part of him— a twisted, sick scrap of who he used to think he was— was disgusted by what he'd read. That same part refused to believe the noble house of Black would want anything to do with the blood-traitor house of Potter. Another, more unlike-Malfoy part of him accepted and supported the homosexual relationship between his uncle Regulus and Potter’s uncle Hyacinthe.
"Holding hands?" Theo asked, scandalized. He smirked not-so-discreetly and raised his eyebrows. "When was this?"
Please let me know what you guys think about either my writing or the plot! I'd be happy to answer questions if you have any as well! Thank you for reading and see you next update! <3
Blaise frowned. "Bullshit. You're practically on par, perhaps even more refined and elegant than Potter. He's just gotten lucky. Besides, Slytherin would rather be damned than to have Harper fly in your stead. Even Harper said so."
For the wedding, Ron is flower girl while Hermione is Harry’s best man and Draco's best maid is Pansy, who they befriended in Sixth Year
He winked. "I'm not sorry. Besides, I've finished casting the strongest Silencing charms known to wizard. I hope, with Cassius here, Blaise will put it to good use."
And yet… he was so terrified of it. Caring for Draco, nay, loving Draco was much more complicated than revenge. Following the plan was simple. It was known. This thing with Draco was the complete opposite. It was different and dangerous because he’d never tried giving his heart to anyone before. And pushing Draco away might hurt him, but it’d keep Harry safe.
"I'd expect to be," Draco replied. "I've got her tact and intellect, not that Father could've given me any of his with how little he has of both."
"Oh." Harry paused, allowing Draco to check to see if he was feeling much better. He concluded that Harry did. "Because of her, how many constellations do you know?"
Merlin, what if their friends were being watched and followed right now? What if they were in trouble right now? What if Draco had left them for the dead? What if they were too late to return and—
He set Potter down on the ground, hastily grabbing at all the materials he'd need for the day and stuffing them into his bag. Potter watched him as he did so, not quite understanding what Draco was doing until Draco neatly stacked all the books he'd borrowed from the library— including the ones he used as bedtime stories for Potter. Then he'd launched himself towards Draco, latching onto his leg and threatening him with adorable puppy eyes.
Draco did his best to do as Harry asked, gasping for air through his mouth. Harry continued to rub soothing circles on his back, murmuring his soft request over and over until his panicked gasps quieted into near-silent pants. The presence of the person who was following them suddenly vanished, and Draco went slack in the brunet's hold entirely. He was only vaguely aware that they stumbled, his mind choosing to focus on the way that Harry's grip on his tightened and loosened. The embrace let this odd knot in his chest untie itself, allowing him to breathe more calmly and steady his heartbeat.
Draco put Potter down the moment they arrived, rubbing his head one last time before standing to greet the two guests he had.
Once again, Draco was reminded of just how different things were here. In Lucius’s and Astoria’s homes, there were cooks to handle the meals. Despite having the wealth to hire a cook if he wanted to, Harry had chosen to cook for himself. More than that, the very notion of someone cooking for him seems to never have crossed his mind.
"Calm down," Blaise said. He rested a hand on Harry's shoulder. He waited until Harry began breathing normally, unsure of how to help him exactly. It wasn't as though he'd ever been good at calming people other than Draco down anyway. "You're right that Draco will want to help you, but you and I both know that he will listen if you tell him to stop it."
At that, Draco pretended to bow his head sheepishly. "I admit, I am honored you are looking for my advice. However, I think it will be misplaced. I, myself, would like to cause injury to Potter, Dolores. He's caused me quite a bit of pain and struggle over the years as well. We may be friends now, but since he's apparently dragged my name into the mud with his little stunt of his... well, I must say that I feel hurt and betrayed."
Draco didn't know what to say to that, but didn't want to play Mind Healer with Potter again so he returned the nod and handed Potter the script. "Have you been reviewing the lines on your own?"
The three of them were still friends of course, and they always talked to each other first if anything, and this was literally
He just couldn't tell whether that someone was following them with curious or with malicious intent.
"I missed many lectures. I need extra preparation," Draco informed. Pansy threw him another object, which Draco was disgusted to find was a biscuit.
So instead of strolling up to Potter and telling him about their uncles' relationship, Draco turned for the Slytherin dungeons and found safety and solitude in his room.
to do?" Theo snapped. His thin fingers gripped the opposite arm, biting his lip in shame. "It wasn't like I could've said it out loud. I would've sounded mentally insane. 'Oh hey guys. By the way, I just saw Draco Malfoy cough up this really pretty flower'! Pansy, you know that would've sounded like utter bullcrap!"
“You love him, and you pushed him away. You played with his heart for your own amusement. How is that not as bad as what Lucius did?”
Unlike the last time Potter touched him, it felt surprisingly gentle. Which, Draco quickly realized, meant something was about to go wrong. He righted himself almost immediately, sending a pointed look at where they were touching and looking up when Potter recoiled as though he'd been stung.
Harry had always been like this— the only one who could get under Draco's skin like this while also being the only one who would be utterly terrified for his (ex)enemy.
Harry then let go of Draco's hand, picked the ladder up, set it against one of the walls with a latch, and started climbing it.
Sighing, he called Potter's name in greeting. The little thing's snout appeared from under the blanket again, though this time his eyes were narrow with suspicion.
"Come on, Harry," Draco giggled. "Her predictions were infamous. Everyone has heard the general gist of them."
birds. Like the Slytherin crest, every single detail was attended to. Feathers were skillfully crafted, light markings for bones were not forgotten. And, though this may not actually make sense to anyone, Draco couldn't help but think that the beaks and eyes of these drawn birds seemed realistic enough to put real birds to shame.
He felt another squeeze around his hand. Draco shut himself up before he said something incredibly stupid.
At that, Theo let out a laugh. His friends instantly whipped their heads to him, eyes wide comically.
With that, he stood and fled, leaving Potter alone under the tree they'd occupied for no longer than forty minutes and under the moonlight that had made Potter's smile incredibly endearing and handsome.
"Not too much. Pansy had insisted on bloating me last night for the graduation feast," Draco groans, pursing his lips into a pout. "I swear that woman hates me. She knows I don’t eat much."
"I know," Draco replied quietly. It wasn't as if he thought he didn't mean anything. After all, if he meant nothing, why would his friends even bother helping him? "I didn't mean it that way."
Draco being pleasant company was a good sign. The last thing he needed was to be incapable of following through with his master plan just because he was too overcome with disgust. He needed Draco to be utterly devoted to him, so thoroughly enamored that their inevitable separation would devastate him. Draco needed to be ruined as completely as Hermione had been, or else it wouldn’t have been good enough.
Never one to hesitate, Harry went through the village gathering his crew. He’d never given his men and women so little time to rest between raids, but this calls for special circumstances. The open sea and his beloved ship were exactly what he needed to clear his mind— to refocus and remind himself of what’s really important. The only reason Harry thought he had feelings for Draco was because they’ve been cooped up together for too long. A few days apart and Draco would get over it.
"To be fair, he hasn't helped me all too much," Draco said, desperate to please Blaise. Perhaps it was the fact that Blaise had an entire speech including a tidbit about their childhood that pushed Draco to feel as if he was on the verge of losing him. Merlin, if Draco loses him—
And now, because it was too late, Draco couldn't hope for peace if he accepted Potter's invitation for friendship. He couldn't hope that his fellow Slytherins would not have a target on their backs. He couldn't hope that everything will be as alright as Potter said it would.
"Draco, do Theo and I next," Pansy excitedly encouraged. Draco rolled his eyes. "Make it sound as poetic as you made everyone else's."
Draco soothingly rubbed the back of his palm again. "This means he uses me as his exclusive taste-tester. His association with me carries him through the door for almost all bakeries in the wizarding world, which I must say he doesn't even need. In return, I get nothing but his undying loyalty— and chocolate. I definitely get that from Montague too."
“He isn’t that small,” Blaise interrupted as he stepped forward, an arm around a very pleased Pansy. “And don’t pretend you wouldn’t let him pin you anytime, anywhere.”
"About how everyone looks towards you for answers, yet ostracizes you the moment they hear something they dislike." Draco smiled down sadly. "Like how you told me you could 'tell the wrong sort' for yourself. I obviously disliked that."
"Severus and the Amorentia potion," Draco summarized. "It took a rather embarrassing amount of time for me to get my head out of my arse to see it. After that, it was just the matter of how I could tell you without embarrassing myself."
Draco stared at him. He hoped his gaze conveyed how much he loathed the idiot for forgetting that he held his wand. Then he remembered that his mother had given him her wand so he could survive during the war, and he faltered.
Emboldened by Pansy’s confidence in him and the certainty of his own heart, Draco strode over to where Harry sat, handed him a small tray, and carefully sat down on his knee. Harry looked like he swallowed his own tongue as he looked up at Draco with comically wide eyes.
Harry slyly glanced towards him, smirking. "What do you know? Draco Malfoy can be rendered speechless."
They snapped back together like rubber bands when the Dark Lord returned and asked for volunteers to lead the Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Pansy, being a witch and easily influenced by fear, was his first choice. Blaise, since his family had been neutral and the Dark Lord needed more followers, was his close second. Draco knew this, and he knew the dangers of either of them entering the Dark Lord's ranks. So he closed the distance between them.
"Alright, let's just say that someone is out here. Why would they be following us?" Harry asked, oblivious to Draco's inner turmoil.
"Are you alright, my darling?" Narcissa asked. Stepping out of the Manor, they began walking out to towards gates.
"Well, enjoy your cake, Malfoy," Montague said with a wink. He pushed himself up, jerking his head towards the other tables. "When you feel like you can beat me at Strip Poker, you know where to find me."
Shaking his head, Draco let out a low chuckle. "Don't be. You didn't make me do anything. I wanted to."
Draco and Harry shared a happy smile as they watched the people they love laugh and spend time with one another, knowing that they wouldn't change anything in their lives for the world.
With that, Draco made his way out of the Hospital Wing with wobbly legs. Pansy, Blaise, and Theo rushed out after him— Theo and Blaise pressing themselves against Draco's sides to support him. Pansy walked beside Blaise, her eyes still teary from earlier. "You should've given her a chance," Pansy said.
"Fine. If you go back to the Malfoy Manor, and you came back like you had from the holidays... we'd all be devastated. Even worse: if you didn't come back at all, we'll all jump to the worst case scenario but wreak havoc anyways breaking into the Malfoy Manor trying to figure out what happened to you. And don't say that we can't. Pansy and Hermione— all of us— we won't stop until we do. At least, if you're with me at the Dursleys..."
His voice was like a command, his eyes sharp with steel as he conjured a chair for himself in front of Draco. He reminded Draco sharply that he had been an army commander, a rebel leader who proved himself fearless and strong-minded time and time again. He reminded Draco that Harry Potter was a stubborn bastard.
He sealed the pretty thing up and placed it inside an empty file as a reminder of the skill that it took for it to get there.
No more than half an hour passed before Draco heard footsteps approaching. He flinched when the door was yanked ajar. The light from outside was blocked by the man's silhouette, allowing him the luxury of not squinting and appearing like a sour grape. Before he could decide what to do, the man stood before him.
Draco let out a sigh of relief. "Oh thank Merlin. I thought I was going to tip over the cliff of insanity."
There was another sting of magic, but instead of it being anger, it was more of like a mixture of fear and horror. "It wasn't acting. We thought— we thought you were dead."
"I know, I know. You struck a deal— one you won't tell me about— and you sadistically tortured her to fulfill your side of it."
"Harry," Draco called out a bit breathlessly. His eyes snapped to meet Harry's. Harry stopped arguing with Sirius, waiting for Draco to continue. "I just had the most brilliant idea."
It felt strange to feel happiness again. It felt awkward, impossible. It was the kind of happiness that made Draco feel terrified of when this dream would end and how he would feel afterwards. But he pushed those thoughts out of his mind.
He spent two weeks simply watching his aunt and uncle fight over what they should do with him. He decided then, even though he was probably too young to really understand why, he didn't like the screaming.
Not only was he late to their meeting, but he also missed half of the class. He slipped in through the back, using Blaise as his cover once sitting beside him. It appeared as though nobody noticed that he'd been gone. Or at least, if they did, they didn't notice that he'd snuck. Checking to see if Professor Hayes had seen, Draco froze under caramel eyes.
She removed her hand from his shoulder, closing her eyes. She focused until she found the little shimmer of Draco's thoughts, and then she dived deeper to hear them. Her eyes snapped open when she heard it:
"What are you waiting for?" Ginny Weasley drawls from next to him. Her hands rest easily on her hips, an eyebrow raised at Harry. "Go ask him."
Draco rolled his eyes. He believed the correct word Harry was looking for was 'offend'. "Originally, it was humiliating, but I don't really mind anymore."
Draco let go of tension he wasn't aware he was holding in his posture. A weak noise escaped him as he began making his way over to them. And that's when his father saw him.
Blaise glanced towards him, noticed the nervous fidgeting, and agreed. "Alright. Let's go up to your room."
Draco stomped down on his foot, making Harry groan from all the pain. "Thank you, Severus. Good night."
Draco snickered. "What could he have acknowledged? The nonexistent supporting music? The probably-very-drunk students who glared at him?"
Draco cut himself off there, unsure of why he'd suddenly freaked out and blabbered like an idiot. Harry didn't even ask. He'd simply said one thing and Draco went off on another. Luckily, Harry had zoned out, which was a good thing in Draco's opinion.
Harry sat in the snow in something akin to rags, shivering and wincing as he tried to will himself not to cry, and obediently waited for his relatives to let him back in. He knew that if he waited, he would be let in quicker and he would be allowed to cry into the ugly, torn teddy bear that Dudley had secretly given him for Christmas.
"Well, I still think he's an idiot," Theo hummed. Draco shot him a nasty glare that he ignored. "But, we should focus on other things. Like... what are we going to do? No one is going to believe us."
He was wrong for doing so and he knew it, but he couldn't stop. Especially not after third year and those first years told him about how people didn't harass them all too much when Draco put on a tough front and pretended to be on par with Potter.
"Merlin, no. Blaise is just a friend. My feelings for him are exactly the same as my feelings for you and Theo."
"Absolutely not," Blaise grit out. "You can not fucking talk as if you've given up, Draco, and you can not tell us to give up on you. We will not fucking stop looking, even if you try to convince us to. You are worth more than words, Draco, and you will live through this. You will get the best NEWT score possible in Potions, you will beat Potter in Quidditch, you will be the first Prime Minister in the Malfoy line, you will be the first to beat the shit out of Theo when he messes up the flower arrangement at your fucking wedding like when he used to mess up his potions, and you will be the first to get ugly wrinkles out of all of us. So don't forgive us when we prove that we believe in you, Draco, but don't forget us when you're outliving us."
Draco pointedly set his copy of the script down on one of the seats. "Potter, why do you keep apologizing to me?"
Draco chuckled at that. He couldn't help but think about how if he heard those exact words from Harry a few months ago, he would have had a difficult time restraining himself from attacking him.
Harry glances at the blond's friends— Pansy, in particular, is excitedly shaking his hands and trying not to squeal— because they're openly staring at him with open jaws. Merlin, they obviously know. So...
Harry snorted, ruining Draco's attempt at dramatic poetry. "Just say that they're as posh as you are, Draco."
"You know my father knows all the ins and outs of the Ministry." He paused for the dramatic effect. In the corner of his eye, Draco saw Harry approaching. His cheeks were flushed and his hair was ruffled, but Chang wasn't skipping away or anything so he figured it was just the cold. He put a mental note to cast a heating charm for the Gryffindor idiot. "Therefore, you do realize he could put in a good word for you and your mother, right?"
Harry took Draco's hand again, squeezing it as a form of reassurance. It was more for himself than for the blonde, and he hated how selfish he was when Draco was clearly in pain as well.
Malfoy doubled over, snorting before giggling like an adorably cute kitten. And kittens are generally cute enough without all the snorting and giggling.
"Then listen to me," Hermione said. "Draco, it's incredibly dangerous. And we're just kids. We can't do anything. Especially not something that is going to put you in danger."
"Oh," Potter dumbly said. He shifted on the balls of his feet. "Right. Er, so just talk a bit more like you?"
Draco realized he'd been doing that a lot lately— calling Harry 'dearest', that is. He didn't even know where it came from. He just said it one day and he couldn't stop himself from repeating the endearment. Draco feared the day he started referring to Harry as 'my love'. Severus would have a stroke and Harry would look at him as though he was mad.
His mother schooled her facial expression when they reached the Manor's doors, waving a hand and stepping inside without a click of her soles. Draco stared at where she stepped, that uneasy feeling beginning to pool in the bottom of his gut. He took a deep breath and stepped onto the tile silently as well nonetheless. Years of slipping out of uncomfortable birthday celebrations granted him such a skill.
"I don't know about that either. It's not really accepted in the muggle world so not a lot have come out. And those who do don't advertise themselves as such so..."
Draco brought one of his hands up and combed through Harry’s hair. He leaned back to press a chaste kiss to Harry’s forehead, right beside where his infamous lightning scar was.
He grinned, a smile like his automatically sent shivers down Pansy's spine. It was incredible how dramatic (and hilarious) her friend could be when it's his life on the line. In his situation, the easiest thing to do would be to negotiate with the person he's in love with. Or fall out of it.
"Love ya too," Harry replied. His gorgeous eyes glanced around their surroundings. "Wha' happened? Where's Voldemort?"
Draco chuckled. "To the Manor? Merlin, no. Father really might kill himself. As much as some things may be easier when he's gone, I'd rather not have Mother be alone for a bit longer."
It's been years since Draco had been really pissed at him, but Blaise couldn't recall if his best friend had ever looked this upset even then. Like Blaise had kicked his precious piano out of pure spite.
." Draco shot a nasty glare towards her. He now knew the name of the bitter feeling he had held towards her: jealousy. After all, Harry did fawn over her in fourth year and sulked when she went with Diggory... and Draco knew he would've known why Harry had been attracted to her if he had simply redirected his attention away from Harry.
Merlin, Draco loves his voice too. It's kind, caring. Harry had used the same tone when trying to calm him down. Was Draco panicking now? Probably, but he couldn't focus on it. Harry's voice reminded him of that nightmare he had several weeks ago. The one with a flash of green and aching coldness. Draco figured out what it was. It was Harry
Weasley and Granger stood rigidly by Potter's side, keeping watch beside him. Their shoulders were stiff, and their jaws were set in a way that told Draco neither of them would mind hexing Draco if he was planning an ambush or anything like that. Especially Granger. Draco would even go as far to say that she was absolutely ruthless when it came to Potter and Weasley. Surely, she would hurt Draco without a bat of an eyelash if she sensed he wanted to hurt her friends.
Knowing that he wasn't going to be able to reply truthfully without his voice cracking, Harry ignored him and asked Hermione to conjure a new shirt and warm towels. He had to rely on muggle methods— the way Aunt Petunia taught and expected him to know after the first time he had been beaten— to clean Draco up. He tenderly wiped the blood away, not quite giving up when some of the blood refused to be cleaned up. He handed the shirt to Theo, who was staring at him with a pair of knowing eyes. Harry ignored that too.
. He held the bloodied palm to the goblin, who swiped at it with the back of his quill. The goblin hummed as the tip of the quill turned blue. The goblin then turned his attention back to his book.
The days passed by in a daze then, and when he returned to Hogwarts, the days burned to nothing but crisp as Draco remembered all the things they used to do and all the places they used to sneak off to.
Draco explicitly ordered Leia to take any and all letters he received to the dungeons and hide them all in a small corner that was hidden within the most unused cell. As always, Leia did not betray his orders.
"Potter, you're acting weird," Malfoy said slowly as though he was talking to a child. "Madam Pomfrey, I think we'll need a Calming Draught too."
“Third-wheel the hell out of Hermione and Ron,” Draco teased. He waved his wand and cleaned up the little pile of dirty clothes Harry never bothers to clean up. “Now strip yourself of everything else. If I don’t see your naked arse in ten seconds, I’m taking the bath myself.”
Then, as though the random ray of sun served as a reminder, Draco remembered how he was supposed to meet with Potter and Professor Hayes before their first class.
Blaise rolled his eyes, taking his seat again and picking up his fork. There were a string of murmurs that rang around them, but Draco refused to acknowledge them as he took his seat again.
"So I'll be staying with Harry," Draco concluded. He glanced towards Harry, who gave him an affirmative nod and soft smile.
"Yes. He did the exact same thing with James during our NEWT Potions exam and proceeded to convince Slughorn to not persecute Lily for distracting others with her obnoxious laughs," their professor said. "Honestly, one might have thought flirting shouldn't have been done during their final exams."
And as promised, when Harry let him breathe, they went to the Hospital Wing, where one Sullivan Fawley stood. Draco wasn't given any time to wonder why the Hufflepuff alumni was standing there before Harry sat down and began talking about how irrational much of Voldemort's decisions were before and during the war. Apparently, Fawley thought that if Voldemort was truly interested in gaining power, he should have used his charm to take over the Ministry and slowly exclude muggles and muggleborns from the Wizarding society.
The murderous glare in his eye reminded Draco that Harry was in love with him and had a tendency to get jealous. For absolutely no reason at all, Draco wanted to say, but he knew he had his own jealous fits in second year, fourth year, and — Merlin, he even had one this morning. Draco needed to talk to Harry about his conversation with Chang by the way.
"— Draco," Blaise panted, sounding as though he'd been trying to match Draco's terrified-then-frustrated pace for fifteen minutes. And, judging by how Draco snapped out of his daze to find himself in the Slytherin Common Room, it must have been. "What happened?"
Draco agreed, reverting his facial expression back to its neutral state. "Yes, this is very similar to an intimidation stance. Go ahead and attempt this. Uncle Regulus was, after all, a Slytherin and a Black. Intimidation is something he must have been extremely familiar with."
"Fine, here." Potter handed him a poorly conjured hairbrush, which he conjured without a wand and without saying anything. Draco did his best to not scowl at the casual display of strength and transfigured the object into a hairbrush into something that was much closer to his own brush. "Why couldn't you do it on your own?"
"And talking about Harry," Blaise added. "If I remember correctly, Draco used to say this, 'Stupid Potter and his stupid green eyes and his stupid scar and his stupid broom'. It was so amusing, Slytherins changed the password to that exact saying for a month during second year. They only changed it after Draco bribed them with new brooms."
After the incident where he nearly blinded a few of the wizarding world's most powerful individuals and nearly erased Joanna Longbottom from the timeline by warping reality, Draco had been condemned to hide his affinity. Everyone who ever saw him display it was obliviated save for close few, and Draco feared what would become of him and those around him if he were to lose control again.
"I can't help it, Harry. She said it precisely the way you do. Now, if she just had green eyes and a clearly-conspicuous pair of glasses..."
"One where I have to do nothing," Draco replied. Then, carefully wording his sentence to not mention their 'learn one thing about each other' assignment, he said, "Nothing to do with Potter specifically, but I suppose that ship has sailed."
"Exactly," Blaise said. "You had hated them and they had hated you. Things changed, Draco. I mean, why else would Ron have helped you and not insulted you the moment—"
Draco nodded curtly. "Yes. I received a harsh reprimanding for that. Our muggleborn prefect made me apologize to Hermione."
Stepping into the Common Room, Theo stared at his friends in shock. Draco and Pansy were huddled up on one side of couch, muttering amongst themselves. Though he knew that they were always going to be the closest among their entire friend group, he couldn't help but feel jealous. Pushing down this uneasy feeling, he sneaked closer to them in an effort to hear what they might be talking about.
Also I've purposely kept Draco's affinity a secret in preparation for the battle! What do you guys think it is? Ten points to whichever House gets it correct!
"Relax, would you? I can't exactly wear the same one for every party," Pansy pointed out. "And stop being such a kicked niffler. Don't you have some contacts to exchange and manipulate?"
Harry’s fingers card through Draco’s untamed hair, and he kisses the top of his head. It was all part of the act though. Nothing more.
His hands clenched and unclenched around empty air, the usually comforting feel of his wand missing. Draco grit his teeth, forced himself to breathe, and stalked towards the library to actually start on his Muggle Theatre assignment. Hoping to find a lonely, secluded spot, Draco nearly fell to his arse with how harshly he'd suddenly been pushed backwards.
The worry that had been sitting heavily in his stomach for the past few days was instantly replaced with gratefulness and something akin to affection. Before he could even register what was happening, Harry was tearing off the bloodied layer and pulling Draco in for a tight hug.
Not even two minutes later, Potter pranced in and told Professor Hayes that Draco too liked muggle music.
"Potter," Draco grit out. He had no idea why the hell he sounded angry, but anger was always a better solution to vulnerability than defeat and fear apparently.
Contemplating whether or not to tell Blaise about his inability to actually sleep, Draco shrugged. Blaise folded his arm in a condescending way. Pissed, Draco cut him off with a simple, "Good night, Blaise."
Cracking a smirk, Draco lifted his head. "You prat. You're speaking as though you apologize all the time."
Draco scowled. "I appreciate it, but I don't need an escort. I'm supposedly rehearsing lines with Potter. Besides, why are you so concerned now? It was fine before."
Draco leaned over the edge, his eyes skirting around as he looked for the familiar constellation. He had faith he could find it now. Suddenly, it became all too clear where it was. Thanking his ancestors above for giving him a hand, Draco tugged on Harry's hand while trying to point it out for him.
Draco sighed and thumbed the opening to his galleon-filled moleskin pouch, walking slower as he window-shopped and became more and more upset with how horribly bland most of the displays were. He was no closer to a decision than he'd been before, and it was a mere two weeks away from Christmas.
Draco sighed and straightened his back. He looked at Harry in the eyes. "You said that you saw You-Know-Who during the tournament. If that is true, you need all the help you can get for the plans that he'd have for you." Harry opened and closed his mouth several times. Draco turned back to the goblin. "Apologies for the delay. May we go?"
"Ooh... you naughty little minx," Pansy giggled. She jammed an elbow in Draco's side, which Draco had luckily been prepared for. "So it was your idea to dress Cassius up in clothes Blaise designed, huh? I'm surprised he hasn't started drooling yet."
parents and if you like my family so much, you should just marry me and become related to everybody.”
Draco had tripped over his own feet as he cackled with glee as he boasted about his little stunt with Dobby. Apparently, Draco really didn't like the investor, who'd came out as a wanted Azkaban criminal six months later. And even though Lucius had been under surveillance for 'attempting to break out a criminal' stunt, Draco received a gift of some sort two days later.
“I bet you were awfully brave, Harry,” Draco replied just as quietly. “You are an incredible professor, love.”
"Merlin, Draco, can you stop talking like you're about to die?" Blaise snapped. Unexpectedly, he fisted Draco's collar so hard the blond was forced to his feet. Draco's eyes widened for just a fraction, but then he relaxed in his friend's hold. Blaise became even more enraged by his reaction. He raised his fist.
Over the course of the next several weeks, Draco and Potter met sporadically to rehearse their lines. By the time their monthly check-in with the Muggle Theater professor came around, they were done memorizing their lines and cues. Professor Hayes had been exceptionally pleased, urging them to continue with their collaboration and completely forgetting to remind them to tell her one fact about the other person.
And Harry, who had been thinking of Ginny the whole time and how relieved he was than his plan to manipulate Draco into confiding in him all about Voldemort's plans for the war, had never been more thankful that Draco couldn't see his face when he realized he couldn't say 'I love you' back.
"What? No," she insisted. Her eyes were sincere, but her not-so-secretive smile said otherwise. Draco stubbornly refused to give in. Granger sighed. "Alright, I'm sorry. I'll tell you why I'm really here."
Standing up, Draco followed him to the library. Their table— with the amount of time they spend there, it was allowed to be considered as
"Please don't do that. It wasn't his fault that he was laughing." He winced. "I mean, it was, but not really. I was the one making him laugh."
He held up a hand. "You did. You know that Draco always jumps to the deepest end of the pool. And the moment you mentioned Lucius, you made him think like he was completely unloved."
"Malfoy, you do realize this is an assignment about yourself, correct? This assignment was supposed to allow me to understand who you are, or at least who you hope to become in the future. You weren't supposed to summarize what others have influenced you to think or do. After all, you hadn't truly believed that all muggleborns or muggles deserved to die simply because they didn't have magic, correct?"
"Should we organize another party and see if one of them will admit their undying love for each other? The next holiday is Valentine's, isn't it? It'd be the perfect date for Hermione and Pansy to confess their undying love to our best blokes."
And Draco will carry this to the day that he dies, but he figured out about Harry's jealousy back in second year and did all of this just because he wanted to see more of jealous Harry.
"What an interesting question. I'd love to have an answer for it," Pansy said sweetly, her eyes twinkling as she slowly unraveled another one of her scrolls.
On the way out of the diner, Harry sees his Hermione and Ron giving him matching pairs of thumbs up. He also sees Neville, Dean, and Seamus, who were all making kissy faces at him as if they were saying that they expected him to attempt initiating a kiss at some point that night. Harry knows that he'll let his teammates down.
Draco surged forward, casting a diagnostic spell. Finding nothing wrong, Draco picked him up and set him down on his lap, stroking the surprisingly soft belly.
However, when he flipped to the page that had an incredibly beautiful man sketched out, Draco's body seized up.
But for now, Harry was going to be content with waiting for both him to wake up and their friends to return.
"Yeah, how do you know?" Blaise teased, fearless for no reason whatsoever. Draco stepped up and feared for his life for him.
"And I know my word doesn't get rid of your stupid 'I'm worthless' thoughts, but I hope hearing our thoughts of you will let you just do you."
After letting him know the time and the place they were going to meet, Harry stays in a good mood for the rest of the day.
He hastily wiped his cheeks with his sleeve, storming out of the Room of Requirement and refusing to acknowledge the five of them as he passed by. The moment the door slammed shut, Pansy sicced herself on Harry.
"Not 'tricking' exactly, but yes. I need help in order to avoid failing Potions," Harry admitted. He looked rather pitiful— his eyes downcast with shame, his hair messed up with nervousness, his back crouched from exhaustion, and his voice not even biting. And although he hated the amount of additional work he'd have to do, Draco knew that he disliked this version of Potter even more. With that, he sighed. He waved his wand and magicked most of his scrolls back into his bag.
There were so many reasons why Theo should leave: they're from opposite Houses, Harry hurt Draco, he insulted the Malfoy name... and among other things of course. Not to mention how Theo should be with Draco, telling him to calm down and to hex Harry the next time he sees him. Yet, at the same time, there was one reason stopping Theo from leaving.
"Don't apologize for things you have no control over. Don't apologize for things you aren't apologetic or regretful about either. It ruins the sincerity of your apologies," Draco advised. Then he cleared his throat. "Are you ready? We can run through the first two sections that we already covered to memorize it a bit better. Then, since it's only seven, we can begin teaching you other behaviors of purebloods to make your acting more realistic. We may do another section of the script if we have time."
"Please. Hermione, I caught you within five minutes," Pansy snapped, though it lacked any spite or hate. "If anything, you didn't use any of your personal means."
As they walk the entire length of the village, Draco did his best to take it all in— memorize every path, learn every face, and the condition of every house. He was committed to making things work here. These people, despite being mostly Vikings, appeared friendly and welcomed him without caring for who his family was or what he could do for them. It was refreshing and it reaffirmed Draco’s desire to fit in and find a place for himself here.
From this distance, Draco could see the remnants of teal and gold in it. It was unfair how Harry's eyes can seem even prettier from a close distance. Draco refocused by clearing his throat and leaning away the slightest bit. He filled a glass with water, purified it, and conjured a leaf to place in the cup. Their friends looked over with interest now.
"There's also a Luxembourg park that we should visit," Hermione continued. "We could eat lunch tomorrow there."
"Of course I do. She's like the little sister I never wanted, but needed," Draco replied without hesitation. Pansy's breath hitched. "Sort of like you and Hermione, if you will. You love her like a little sister, don't you?"
"You're right. You were terrified," Harry teased. When Draco huffed, he murmured a soft apology. "Do you have another favorite?"
"So you can listen," Draco snarked, unable to help himself. "Would you like to try and go through what we've already said with that advice in mind?"
She knew how lonely the manor could be. More often than not, his father had to leave for the Ministry and his mother dived headfirst into throwing political parties and making allies. The only times Draco wasn't alone were when Blaise came over or when his... less mad aunt accompanied him. And when Draco lost one of those people...
"It can be considered to be 'extra credit' for Muggle Theatre, Blaise. After all, muggles draw by hand, don't they?" Draco challenged.
Draco's room was flawlessly clean. Unlike Blaise's room, there weren't any spare clothes lying around, his bed was made neatly, and all the books Draco had— or was borrowing from either her or the library— was placed neatly into the bookshelf. All the windows were nicely polished, as to be expected of their perfectionist friend, and even his clothes were firmly ironed in the wardrobe. There were a few stacks of scrolls, distinguishable only by the differences in the ribbon that was wrapped around them.
They stayed like that for a moment. Draco was practically in his lap and suffocating him with a vice-like grip, but Harry could think of nowhere he’d rather be.
"She is. And you were the one to make sure that I had the second thing. After you transferred the Le Havre place to me—"
to Draco. Honestly, he thought Harry would've thought to be a bit more romantic or something, but this was alright too. They are alone after all, and Theo supposed it would be sort of romantic to bond over their regrets... No. No, it is not.
Draco blinked in surprise then stared at Potter, who had magically appeared to save him like the person Draco had named him after. Harry, who had been hurrying after the little guy, looked both perplexed and proud of Potter. He was hiding a small smile behind a hand, the other resting on his hip to make it seem like he was disappointed.
*Anxiety attack alert! There is also mentions of Wormtail being a creepy dude so if you are uncomfortable with either, please skip to the long horizontal marker!*
Harry nodded slightly, taking a step inwards and closing the door behind him quietly. He stood for several moments, seemingly debating with himself as he did so. Finally, Harry just sighed.
Blaise sighed. His hand drifted down to pat Harry’s back a few times before it disappeared. Harry peeked between his fingers to watch Blaise head out the door. He paused in the doorway, picking at a loose splinter.
Potter rubbed the back of his head, smiling sheepishly and apologizing in a very soft voice. "Right, so how should I do it?"
Draco didn't like the way she said 'your undying love', but he decided to let it pass. He still needed to tell her about how the disease practically deleted (see: yeeted) itself from his throat. Besides, Harry didn't have the Hanahaki disease. Although he did love Draco in return, his affection wouldn't be as intense as Draco's. He doubted Harry would confess his 'undying' love for Draco.
Because for the first time in a long time, he was sure of the happiness that swelled up in his chest. He had a partner, of some sort, and his partner was Harry. They agreed to be exclusive and romantic, and they agreed to continue kissing. Although he was unsure that other people began relationships this way, he was sure that he and Harry never fit into the normal spectrum anyway and if this was how they wanted to do it, then so be it.
"Oh my god, shut up, Malfoy," Potter snapped before he unexpectedly pushed Draco into an empty classroom.
"Mhmm. Right," drawled Draco. He twirled his wand around, drying his towel immediately. Then he folded it, placing it on top of his dirty, yet neatly folded, clothes. "And you were the only one who came?"
"Draco, for a period of two weeks, Potter had arrived late to all of his classes in favor of sitting by your bedside. Potter quit Quidditch quickly after." Draco balked.
Merlin, if it's another 'you should be rotting in Azkaban, Malfoy' letter, Draco was literally going to
A silver mist led the four of them to Ron, Ginny, Luna, and Blaise in the Brain Room. Ron looked like he was drunk off his arse, Ginny was limping like mad, Luna appeared well, and Blaise appeared a bit shaken.
Hermione scowled slightly. "I hope he doesn't just take a look at whatever Harry shows him and just does it."
The fifth day of Draco's peaceful silence went similarly, but Harry pulled him to the Quidditch Pitch instead of the library and roped Draco into thinking he wanted to talk to Sirius about their abnormally traditional family. They ended up talking about chocolate though (which Draco definitely didn't mind at all!). Remus, who was there as well, kept muttering about how he'd cover Draco in chocolate from head-to-toe the next time they met face-to-face since Draco obviously loved it as much as he did.
Draco flushed but didn’t allow himself to be distracted. “Your men kidnapped me. You’re holding me prisoner, as you said, away from my home. What do you want with me?”
"Well, my mother doesn't really know. Father had asked me to keep it a secret when I turned six and he started training me. He said that I would surprise her one day."
And in Third Year, Draco and Harry take Arithmancy together. This is because Harry knows that if he went to Divination, Uncle Wormy would take offense to it and cry. So they walk in, sit beside each other like they always do, and Draco absolutely worships Professor Pettigrew because of how brilliant you have to be in order to understand the precision of these spells.
"I'm pretty sure you're the only Hogwarts graduate to say that full-heartedly," Harry says with a light laugh. "Besides, I can't. I'll never be able to understand Potions, no matter how much you insist Snape 'dumbed' it down for us."
Blaise nodded along, waiting for it to dawn on Harry that Draco usually would not do something like that unless he cared deeply for a person. In fact, Harry should already know this, but Blaise supposed love made him even more blinder than per usual.
Not only did they speak about those sorts of things, but they also talked a bit about what they imagined Harry's parents were like— which nearly made Draco want to tear his own hair out when he realized just what a happy childhood Harry had been deprived of. He'd been angry and withdrawn afterwards, and he wanted to dive into necromancy to give Harry a minute with his family.
"What do you suppose we do now?" Blaise asked quietly. "We have to definitely hide this from Vince and Greg. They'll go berserk if they learn of what you experienced— I know you don't like hiding things from them as much as I do, Draco. But let's keep them innocent for a bit longer."
Please let me know what you guys think about either my writing or the plot! I'd be happy to answer questions if you have any as well! Thank you for reading and see you next update! <3
Draco cursed, his shoulders tensing even more when he and Harry decided to part from the rest of the group and slide into another, much more dark room. Harry pushed him against the wall, pressing his pointer finger against his own lips. Draco nodded, but still gripped his wand tightly.
it is," he whispered softly. Her eyes widened as she connected the dots. He sent her a small, tightlipped smile. "I don't know who they are. There are no cures. Surgery is out of the question. I refuse to live while being incapable of loving my friends." He cleared his throat and said in a louder tone, "Besides... regardless of when death claims me, it will happen. I've never heard of a person who avoided death."
As he leaned his head against the bedpost, too shocked to move and too terrified to fall asleep, at three am in the morning, Draco couldn't help but wonder what was within the contents of the letters he'd sent away.
There was no way that he, the man too terrified of everything every day, could have killed Hyacinthe, the husband of his best friend's younger brother.
"The only trouble you're going to get in is with me, and it'll happen if you don't get up from that bed," Draco deadpanned.
"Honestly, couldn't you have just gone down to the Slytherin Commons and asked the Baron to see me and ask me yourself? It's a simple solution that even a the most Gryffindor-ish Gryffindor could have figured it out."
Blaise looked as though he was about to tell him off, but Draco just plopped himself down on the couch and flipped open Regulus's journal. When footsteps began fading, Draco inhaled and focused his attention on the entry in front of him.
Her hopeful expression dropped. "I'll be right back, Mr. Malfoy. No getting out of the bed until I say so."
“No way,” Hermione replied sarcastically. “Blaise is waiting for you to give the word. They’ll help you find Draco and, maybe if you grovel enough, he might take you back.”
Draco answers with a small nod and presses his side against him. He used his free hand to break off a piece of bread, dipped it in honey, and held it out for Harry to take. And, as if they traveled back in time and were back home during the time where Draco first learned to cook lamb stew, Harry took a bite with his eyes trained on Draco. It’s exhilarating. Throughout the entire meal, they stayed like that: hand-feeding each other and enjoying every moment of it.
"You are both too good for me," he bawled as he took a white chocolate truffle. It melted into his mouth smoothly and it tasted absolutely heavenly. "You're like the Merlins to my Prince Arthur."
Draco scoffed. "Still hung up on the past, Golden Boy?" Draco drawled. He cast a quick charm and perched himself on the table. "Honestly, some of us are growing more mature. Will you stash away your childhood trauma for another day?"
They played the rest of the game in complete silence. While Draco was busy wondering why Harry would react so badly to him not-falling, Harry was busy glancing around for the Snitch. Due to his lack of focus, Draco ended up losing 2-1, but he couldn't find himself to care when they flew to the grass and Harry grinned like an idiot while tossing the Snitch up smugly. Draco
It wasn't until fourth year, when Pansy sobbed in his arms about this disease she read a story about, that Draco learned exactly what he had.
Quidditch, his one and only beloved love of his life— 'play without me; I can always try out again next year, Draco' he said when Draco asked him about it. It was like he was trying to will Draco into not dying by simply giving into every one of Draco's oldest complaints.
