“So you cut me up for what reason exactly?” His voice was light, but Harry could feel his steely grey eyes boring into him. He could feel the bond stretch with tension.
Hedwig. Draco would recognize that owl anywhere. She had been beautiful.
. People who had defied the Dark Lord. They were people—just like me. Greyback was a monster—not the people he turned.”
Harry scowled, then looked up at him, “No personal gain at all? I don’t believe it.” Malfoy looked a bit tired himself. His blonde hair was buzzed short, only a bit of growth on top that was pushed back by fingers, not product. He was wearing all black robes, with not even a bit of white, silver or any other color to highlight his features.
areas. They would have tea out back in the gardens or in the sitting room in the private quarters. An elf Draco didn’t recognize showed him to the back parlor. Not necessarily untainted, but nothing particularly bad happened in that room. As soon as Draco walked in he could tell his parents had been arguing. They looked too stiff and his mother was slightly turned away. To anyone else it wouldn’t have been much, but Draco knew them too well.
“It did not happen like poof.” Draco rolled his eyes, “We became friends eighth year.”
“Do you feel like sometimes he doesn’t understand?” Potter asked. It was easier to be friendly with other people around.
an asshole.” Harry leaned forward, licking from the base of his jaw to behind his ear.
“Out on the couch.”
“It’s not his fault.”
“That you shouldn’t have edged me for forty minutes and expected me not to fuck you like a crazy person.”
“Yes, well, inbreeding makes your DNA bad. And in witches and wizards, sometimes it causes their magic to consume them.”
“Fuck off.” Harry said, but he had a smile on his face, “I like my bubble baths.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yes sir.” An auror said with a smile, handing Harry a glass. Draco knew it would be followed. All of the aurors respected Harry too much to say anything.
Harry was silent, just running his fingers gently through Draco’s hair. He squeezed Draco’s shoulder for a moment, stepping away. When he came back, he helped Draco get undressed and then moved him to the tub. There were plenty of bubbles and it smelled fantastic as Draco sunk down into the tub. Harry climbed in behind him, pulling Draco tight against his chest.
“I am because I am serious.” Draco said, “You need a sober up spell—you’re falling all over the place.”
, so don’t give me that look, you’re twelve years old. You shouldn’t be wandering around without parental permission. And I am looking forward to meeting your best friend.”
They were headed to a bar they frequented in Muggle London. Somewhere off the beaten path from wizards and witches. The bar was more than just a pub, but a lot less than a club. There was music playing as they walked in.
Hermione squeezed his hand, “I’m sorry Harry—I should have thought of this years ago.”
aware from a young age when you’re a squib.”
Draco shook his head a bit violently, “No. My Mum is already so—she’s so fragile. I don’t want to tell her. And my father wouldn’t care.” He let out a harsh breath.
Harry looked a bit guilty, “I’ve learned that it doesn’t always have to be
“Done.” They shook hands on it.
“Ow.” Draco groaned as he opened his eyes.
Draco couldn’t quite believe he was here. It had been eight months since he had graduated and his feet were finally buried in the sand at a Florida beach. He had taken Lindsey up on her offer of hosting him. Graduation into a job had been a bit of a whirlwind. Working for George had been nothing short of painful in the beginning. It was awkward, it was tense, and it was all around nerve wracking. Of course, Ron had been in the store as well. They avoided each other for the first month, but once the ice began to thaw on George it was only a matter of time.
“No you don’t—but it might make you feel better.”
! THEN HE KILLS HIMSELF!” Draco shoved Harry again, “one last fucking DICK MOVE. Like he couldn’t fucking
“Well, I don’t want to take an advert out in the Prophet—but I want my friends to know.” Harry said with frown, looking up at Draco, “The press is fucking nuts. It’s not that I don’t want to—but holding your hand in public would cause a frenzy if someone we don’t trust tells the Prophet.”
“It’s peppermint.” Isaac told him, also holding out a box of tissues with his other hand. It was difficult to breathe through his nose so Draco took the box gratefully. He wiped his face with a tissue, blowing his nose as he held his teacup in the other. Draco leaned back a bit, but kept his legs pulled up as he placed his teacup on his knees, “Have you told anyone about this?” Isaac asked.
“Yeah, I think so too.” Draco agreed.
“Holy fuck!” Ron’s voice carried, “Mione?”
“Shut up.” Harry couldn’t help but laugh again. That
Draco could just make out a small smile on Potter’s face in the darkness, “Goodnight Draco.”
staring at his arsehole.
One more chapter! Just the epilogue. Can't believe it's finally here. This story was a bit more difficult to get out of me than usual, but I still love it. Let me know your thoughts :)
Harry’s breathing got a bit more even, Draco started again. He twisted his hand a bit, squeezing just like Harry liked. Harry’s breathing got faster, Draco moved his hand faster. Harry bit his lip, his chest heaving as he got closer to the edge. His hip twitched a bit, but Draco kept going.
“I tell them I top—I usually top in hookups.” He confessed.
“Come on. I got injured!”
“He didn’t do it!” Hermione said.
“I got it from the twins, but it was made by my dad and his friends.”
“When did you start?” Isaac asked.
Hermione squeezed his arm, “But she’s fine, nothing happened.” Draco cleared his throat a bit, nodding.
“Is this some sort of line?”
“You’re much better at speech giving than I am.” Harry complimented, setting his drink down. Some clinked their glass and suddenly the room was chiming.
“Multiple reasons. The first being that I owe you Potter for saving my life in the Room of Requirement. And second that if the roles were reversed, I believe you would help me.”
“Everyone always thinks we’re way more interesting than what we are.” Harry told her with a roll of his eyes.
“I would never cheat on Harry!” Draco yelled, letting out a sigh, “Give me some Veritaserum.” All the aurors looked a little awkward, “I know you are bound to have some—
He laughed with Lyn as he made his omelet, then made Draco’s omelet according to her specifications. The French toast recipe was his own, made easier by the slightly stale bread Draco hadn’t gotten around to eating because of Harry. Harry turned around to place the tray of French toast on the island to see Draco standing in the doorway. He was freshly showered wearing a black sweater and slacks. His face was in shock.
“Want to talk about it?” Harry asked.
“Come on Malfoy, let’s go have an adventure.” Potter looked a little too eager. Draco couldn’t help but shoot Granger a frightened look.
She giggled, “I’m black—which in America can be an issue. The British accent throws them off, I get away with more.” She winked and Draco laughed more. Draco couldn’t stop asking questions about her bakeshop. Apparently she had to work ridiculously early in the morning to make sure everything was ready in time. He didn’t really know how to bake without magic—or with it—so she explained as much as she could.
“How were you cheating?”
thank you very much.” Harry smiled before kissing him again.
“Why—why would she?”
“Plumbing?” Draco asked.
“Well you’re here now.” He waved his wand at a pot of tea and plopped down on the couch opposite of where he showed Draco to sit.
“Pansy had to take me out of the room at Astoria’s funeral because I couldn’t stop giggling.” Malfoy said, looking surprised he admitted to it, “Pureblood funerals are a bunch of shit. It wasn’t what Astoria wanted. We had our own ceremony later.”
“Will you fuck me there?” Draco asked.
“I don’t want to be.” Harry whispered back.
“I picked the wheat for the bread this morning.”
Harry was angry with himself for drinking so much when he knew he was going to be alone. He didn’t do well on too much alcohol and being lonely. He knew it and did it anyway. Harry dithered around the kitchen, making sure everything was in its proper spot before making himself one tall glass of water. The sun was just about to sink below the horizon, so Harry went onto his back porch to try to sober up and watch the sun set. When he heard the floo go off, he turned around excitedly. He didn’t hide his disappointment when he saw it was Hermione.
now. I told you to put the past behind you and focus on who I am now—and you haven’t
“Healer Malfoy.” He said formally.
“How chivalrous of you.” Draco grinned.
Blaise snorted, “Now I doubt that.”
“Getting me food. I’m sick of hospital food.”
“You went to him today as well?”
Harry walked up to Luna’s house a bit nervous—well, a lot nervous. He was arriving a few minutes late but not so late that he interrupted anything. The door opened as he pushed through, he never felt the need to knock on the door at Luna’s. Rolf waved him inside as he stepped in, taking off his coat.
“I had Maia come in because I wanted her to look at your results too, just making sure that my closeness to Draco was not influencing how I was seeing things.” Blaise said. He pulled a piece of paper out of the folder and handed it to Harry. It had all sorts of magical and hormone levels. One taken from when he was admitted in the hospital, and one from now.
“Good— missing her brothers, though I’ve been sworn not to mention it to them.”
“No?” Draco asked.
“Yeah—he did the fancy bit with the clock.”
“I—Harry sent them.”
“And they say there’s downsides to being a werewolf.” Draco teased, making Aiden laugh. Draco leaned back on Potter’s shoulder.
His mother was quiet, it looks like tears were in her eyes but Draco couldn’t be sure from this far away, “We have only done what we thought was best because we love you.”
“Trying not to.” Harry grinned.
All the blood drained from Draco’s face, he stared at the tattoos and blinked a few times. He wrapped one arm around himself and held the other to his mouth. Tears came to his eyes as he stared at them.
“Oh alright.” Harry rolled his eyes, “If you pretend you’re sick we can have it sooner.” He bargained.
“Shouldn’t I be asking you that?” Draco asked.
“Remember the time Mum got so mad she threw the—what was it?” James asked Albus.
Harry had wanted to do it first.
. Draco seemed to know exactly what he wanted before he wanted it.
Draco nodded, “Yes sir.”
.” Harry pushed back Draco’s hair, “How long have you been thinking this.”
“I—I—” Potter gasped, clutching his neck as his face turned red. He couldn’t breathe. Draco wiggled out from under Potter, grabbing his wand, which was lying abandoned on the floor. He crawled back to Potter and pulled up his shirt. His left side of his rib cage was bruised to hell, a deep laceration on the left side between the fifth and sixth rib. One of them had punctured his lung. Potter started coughing, blood spattered everywhere. Draco said the incantation and immediately Potter gasped a deep breath. He pulled several deep breaths as Draco continued to heal him.
“Fucking hell.” Harry let his head fall back. Draco let his fingers go up Harry’s sides, playing a bit with his nipples. Light touches seemed to slow Harry’s breathing, bringing him back to himself, "It was sort of like coming without all the fun."
“I’m bi, but I mostly date women.” Harry shrugged, “But obviously men can fuck me too—ask Draco. He fucked me multiple times.” Harry grinned over his matcha latte. The clatter of a saucer made Harry turn to Draco.
muttering about him to Mr. Weasley. The group around him seemed determined to ignore it, so Draco followed suit.
“Kinda sounds like you ditched him.” Isaac said as he handed Draco a cup of tea.
“People come back to school tonight.” Draco informed Harry. They were sitting out by the lake. It was one of those days that was just warm enough to be comfortable outside, and only because they had been used to frigid weather. They had played Quidditch for a few hours. Draco was sweaty and gross. They had plopped down by the lake in exhaustion, too weak to make the hike up to the castle.
Draco moved around his bed back to the chair Harry was sitting in. His cock was half hard in his blue boxers and his hands were gripping the arms of the chair tightly.
Gryffindor made him nervous. And he is a Slytherin, he is going to be cunning and work the situation to his advantage.”
Draco snorted, “Harry was here because he is a sentimental prat—not because he is worried about you hurting me.” He performed a few diagnostic charms on Aiden as his patient began to rouse.
Harry snorted, “It’s not my cock. But we need to get dressed and leave in thirty minutes.”
“I like pancakes.” Draco sounded pathetic, but his head hurt. His entire body hurt, no thanks to Potter. Potter gently pulled Draco’s elbow up so he could see Draco’s face.
“You didn’t have to do that.”
“It’s a gift.” Draco said as the doors opened. One of the older Dark Arts Healers from the hall walked up, his name was Youngson. Draco hadn’t worked with him much, but he liked him. The Healer twisted his leg around, and Draco
“What do you want Malfoy?” Potter cooed, running his hand on the outside of Draco’s thigh.
“Wandless and silent? I’m impressed.” Draco hummed, then frowned, “Don’t let it go to your head.”
“You are not supposed to be here.” The other him accused.
“Only because you’re sick now. Once the bond settles in and we stabilize your hormones, you can fuck me if you’d like. I would like us to get to a point where we enjoy the bond—so it’s not a burden.” The last sentence was a bit quiet, but it got to the core of the ache in his chest. He let himself reach out to hope that this wasn’t a horrible situation. Sure he would still be tied to Malfoy for the rest of his life, but it wasn’t like he was tied to Voldemort—or Greyback—or really anyone who didn’t know him well. They
“You look like you need a drink.” Draco said, handing him one, “What’d she say?”
“This conversation?” Draco looked up hopefully. Potter smiled in a way that made the corner of his eyes crinkle.
. I was used like a pawn and then fucked like one. You and me are not the same Potter.”
Blaise walked in with a woman behind him, “Hm” He said with a slight tilt of his head, “I shouldn’t be surprised.”
“I would like to move in with you.” Draco said before he could over think it.
—visiting! Charlie.”
. Draco loved how his chest muscles rippled as he arched backward and thrust into Draco’s hand.
“He accused me of living with you to salvage my reputation.”
“Do you know when they’re going to let me out of here?”
“Yes you did.”
“What were we talking about?”
“No!” Draco stomped his foot.
because he is all HIGH AND MIGHTY AND ABOVE DEPRESSION. AND THEN HE FUCKING DOES THE SAME THING. THAT ASS HOLE.” His throat seared from yelling, he couldn’t believe what he just said, “I—I just—oh Merlin, I shouldn’t have said that. He just—and I just—” The high of righteous anger burned away as quickly as it came. He just insulted his father, who was
“I don’t know.” Draco said, tapping Potter’s thigh, “Flip over.”
Neither one of them heard the floo.
“Harry—please. And you’re welcome. I’m just sorry Hogwarts didn’t say anything. They probably didn’t know about Jack’s furry little problem, otherwise they would.”
held his hand through it and marched him straight to the mind healer to sign up for a session—and then made sure he went to see the mind healer for
“He—he’s actually been great. We have talked a lot. The bond wants us to be patient and understanding—but it hasn’t forced feelings.”
“What do you need?” Draco asked.
“Thank you Guinevere. It is wonderful.” Harry said genuinely.
“Hold your legs.” Potter ordered, standing between Draco’s legs off the side of the bed. Draco hoisted both legs up, holding them open with his arms. Potter slid two fingers into him, “Look at how easy my fingers go in?” His voice was low, “You’re just a gaping hole aren’t you, so fucking needy for my cock.”
Draco walked around the couch to see a small black box set on the table with a diamond ring in the center.
“These policies really should be changed.” Hermione said with a sigh.
“His mum died too.” Albus said, and Harry felt like he had been punched in the gut.
enjoy peace. And I, for one, am going to take my sliver of it.” Harry’s eyes met Draco’s and his heart definitely stopped for a couple seconds, “So enjoy yourselves tonight!” There was loud cheering as Harry stepped off the stage, and Draco grabbed his hand.
“Yeah. It’s all in the shoulders, small behaviors. I’ve been staring at you since I’ve been eleven. It’d be embarrassing if I couldn’t spot a fraud by now.” Harry said, and Draco laughed.
“Mostly defending a client, actually.” Harry said with a grin.
time.” Harry said with a grin.
.” It felt like his nose was being broken all over again. Draco let out a cry as his nose snapped back into place, more blood going everywhere. He knew Hermione was casting other spells to clean up the bleeding as he blinked through the blinding pain.
“Draco.” She interrupted firmly, “To wrongs don’t make a right. I upset you, and I am sorry.”
“Good, enjoy your cupcake Mr. Malfoy.”
“And I’ve been injured, so I need a reward.” Draco told him and Harry laughed, kissing him a bit more. A light cough broke them up. Potter blushed a bit, leaning back.
Draco’s face looked serious for a moment, taming a wayward piece of Harry’s hair, “Would you really change it all—if you went back?”
“Night Draco.” She called softly as he walked into his room.
“I liked that I didn’t bother your sleep.”
“You fired?” Sherry asked
.” Draco whispered into his knees, his hands over his head. He was so
“Few hours—it gets easier.”
“Ginny did video recordings. For me and the kids. We’ve only watched some of them—but one she labeled ‘When it’s too sad to bear’ and the entire video she makes knock knock jokes that are bloody awful.” Harry had a lump of emotion in his throat that he tried to push down with tea, “We had a lot of recordings of our lives with the kids, Lily likes to watch them.”
“You know why that is.” It wasn’t a question.
Rolf handed Harry a firewhiskey, “How are you?” Harry asked.
“Why?”
“What the
Harry frowned, “I like him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Yeah well, Albus has reasonable intelligence and a quick wit, so I am fairly certain he is not your child.”
“I’m off duty.” Harry said, starting to put out plates. Hermione had a look of concern, but that was neither here nor there.
Harry snorted, “You’re going to think back at this and laugh when we’re fifty.”
“Lovers quarrel?” She asked, her voice teasing. More than one person saw Hermione and Draco together and assumed they were dating—despite the fact that the Prophet would show pictures of her on dates with Ron every other week.
“We’re going to head out. Draco, please let us know if you need anything.” Sherry squeezed his hand, “And don’t come back in here for a week at least.”
fallen out of the Hufflepuff’s bag, but that was neither here nor there. Draco wasn’t a thieving prat anymore. Mostly. Blaise, that fucker, had thought to put it on the record player in their room. They had made fun of it at the time with their roommates—a stupid game to poke fun of the muggle born.
“No Slytherin banner?” Harry asked, trying to lighten the mood.
“Lindsey—”
It was Draco that eventually called him out—saying he had been distant for months. That if he wanted out—than he should just say so.
“You have my word.” Zabini said seriously.
“Ginny would want you to fall in love again.” Ron said.
He was sort of glad he wasn’t forced to go back to classes on Friday. His body ached all over the place. He would have been more focused on trying to sit down and not be in pain than listening to any of the professors.
Potter grinned, “N-n-not compe-competing with you-you two.” Draco poured each of them more tea.
The world was full of lights—the sounds of cameras flashing came from everywhere. Draco stood firm next to Harry, trying not to let his anxiety overwhelm him.
“Oh really? All from the small little device. No more having to owl order in things—I want a mobile.” Draco grinned.
Potter nodded, “You don’t—y-y-you—” Potter huffed again, his cheeks turning red.
“Don’t mention alcohol. I’m never drinking ever again.” Draco said as they walked out the door. They walked down the steps, “Where to for dinner? I’m feeling comfort food.”
Scorpius dug into the cake, so Harry thought this would be the perfect time to bring it up, “When are you going to tell your Dad and I that you are dating Lily?” The timing couldn’t have been more perfect. Scorpius inhaled the cake down the wrong pipe and started coughing. He grabbed a paper towel to wipe off his mouth and swallowed milk.
“I know.” Draco’s heart sank. He stared at the grains on the wood table.
Draco looked to Potter, who just frowned back. Potter didn’t follow him back out into the waiting room, which was a wise choice. Draco gave Rachel back to her father and watched them walk out.
“Good morning, let’s see what we have here.” Draco said, sweeping in. The Dad barely backed off a centimeter.
“I did.” Draco answered, “Finished most of my homework.”
Harry protested, “Let’s hear more about Bill and Fleur.”
. It wasn’t crucio because it wasn’t all over his body, but it fucking
“You can’t tell her!” Weasley turned a brighter red.
The rest of the evening went well. Draco even had a few conversations with other Gryffindors that didn’t make him feel like punching anyone. Seamus Finnigan was actually quite funny—despite being a drunk. Harry found him later in the evening.
“Fucking hell!” Scorpius gasped, “You scared the shit out of me.”
“I DIDN’T CHEAT ON HIM!” Draco yelled back, scrambling to try to turn around, “It was polyjuice. I just took Veritaserum to prove it. So you vultures can go fuck off. Especially you Rita. You only get information from informants who
“I’m going to the kitchen for a drink.” Harry told Draco, who was still getting ready.
Lily turned bright red with anger, “Lily—” Harry started.
“Yes.” Harry said, “I don’t want to go to class tomorrow.”
“Just—I can feel my instincts craving you.” Harry said, blushing scarlet.
“Ah!” Draco cried out at the thrust, closing his eyes.
“I’ll try.” Draco said.
of them abandoning you. You were always an incredible person, this was inside you all along. Your success today is because of
Isaac barked out a laugh, “That’s an idea.”
“That’s not why I’m being friends with him. He helps me and I help him—but we don’t keep score.” Draco explained, “I like talking to someone who understands panic attacks.”
“Don’t touch my hair.” Draco warned as Harry moved closer.
. His voice filled Draco’s head.
“He isn’t good at asking for what he needs. His family didn’t really allow for that.” Hermione whispered back.
“Here is your bond.” Blaise said, placing it on the table above all the examples. Harry stared at it, then back at the examples.
“Don’t get in trouble back at the castle now.” He advised and Draco nodded, following Harry out the door.
“I-I know that.” Potter said, frowning at his marsh mellow, “The Prophet—I know it made them out to be monsters. But they’re not. They make it seem like it was so
“Never, if you don’t leave here.” Draco spelled the sheets to go in the washing machine, it started on it’s own.
“Wonderful.” Draco said sarcastically, sitting down, and suddenly remembered his mother was there, “Hermione, this is my Mum.”
Jack smirked, “Never heard it called that before. My parents—my
“Yeah.” Harry whispered, wrapping his arms around himself. Ron stared at him for a moment before sitting down next to him. The two were silent.
“I-I-I n-n-n-” Potter huffed.
“We think it is time.”
Potter gasped and his navy blue shirt started to get dark red.
“It was a slow death—she bled out.” Draco snapped.
“I was not sure Green Thumb would let me in.”
“You fucked Longbottom?” Draco asked.
“That is one baby.” Draco pointed at a grey blob, “And the second.”
“No, some things need to be sacred.” She shook her head, “I enjoy making it, and I don’t want to stop loving it.”
her.” Harry brushed errant tears, “I
“Mrs. Malfoy.” Harry greeted warmly, like the two had been friends who had seen each other frequently over the past several years.
“They’re out in the waiting area—I can go bring them back here.” Draco said.
“Fuck this is good.” Draco said.
“He said I was doing good work in charms.” Draco took a sip of his tea.
“We’ll have to go get lessons again.” Draco said with a sigh.
“No. Not once.” She said confidently, “But it is lonely work. You are on your own on this. I work a rotation in sometimes, but there are a lot of hours where you don’t talk to anyone else.” Draco nodded, “And of course, if you’re an absolute idiot you won’t find anything and it will just be a colossal waste of time.”
Draco was unwilling to share, especially with his father there, “No—just a good breakfast I suppose. How was your morning?”
“Why do I organize the closet if you don’t pay attention?” Draco asked with a sigh. Harry just grinned brightly at him, and Draco leaned in and kissed his lips. Ten years later and those lips had never gotten old. Together ten, but married for seven. And all kids were out of the house and Harry wasn’t even fifty yet. He considered himself a massive success in terms of parenting. James had taken up professional Quidditch and was a chaser for the Falcons. Harry had to give up all his Cannon gear, but it wasn’t too much a hardship. Albus had taken over Draco’s apothecary and was opening a second location. Lily had fallen in his footsteps and was a junior auror. Scorpius, much like his father, dabbled in lots of things. He ran a very successful segment of the Malfoy business but also tinkered in George’s shop, Albus’s apothecary and various other businesses around town.
“And thank you Healer Malfoy.” Harry added, “Can’t stay mad at him forever Hermione just cause he likes fucking me.”
“No.” Draco frowned.
“They have the same problems we do though—business staying within families rather than promoting on skill sometimes leads to terrible business decisions.” Potter said.
“Hermione’s Mum.” Draco answered.
“Mungo’s.” Harry corrected with a grin. Hermione’s laugh seemed to break the tension as all the sudden everyone was talking to one another, Draco let out a breath.
“Malfoy beat you?” Potter asked, sounding appalled.
“Fuck! Sorry. Sorry.” Harry tried to pull away but Draco grasped his thighs.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Government agency.” Draco tagged on, “He helped save the world once.”
.” Draco told the door, and it slid open, “Thank you for bringing me back.”
“Yes.” Harry confirmed. Draco nodded to Ron before stepping into the floo and leaving Harry all by himself. It was deathly silent for a moment, and Harry couldn’t take it, “I’m seeing Draco.”
“How long do you think you’ll have to be together?” George asked. Draco stiffened next to him, his chest puffed out. George frowned, starting to puff his own chest. Harry realized it was alpha posturing—body language that would have gone right over his head a month ago. He felt his own instinct crawling at him to support
“One of them makes sure your ribs didn’t splinter with bone fragments in your chest—so
. Squeeze me—I don’t know if I can come like this.” Harry flipped Draco over, pushing him into the mattress as he fucked him. Harry made a choked sobbing sound, grinding into Draco’s hole. Draco’s own orgasm was quickly approaching, so he snuck a hand back to wank himself.
“Harry’s party. You reminded me of your mum at parties—when we used to go. She just always made sure everyone was having a good time—but always made sure Lucius was happy first. Lucius was a prick about it—but still.” Greg said with a shrug.
“How many times do you throw off hexes a day?” Isaac asked, looking straight at Draco. His brown eyes were sharp.
“Guess who’s awake?” Hermione said with a grin to John, who was sporting a black eye.
“He’s easily the most attractive seeker in the league.”
“I’m—I can’t tell you.” Draco felt his heart burn and he curled his fingers tightly, “I’m just not ready.” How could he even begin to tell her what happened?
“Well, as you can see—I’m fine.” It was several days after his injury had hit the papers, so she obviously wasn’t too concerned.
“Ginny often said that she never even considered divorce—murder, yes but never divorce.”
“I know—but only practiced your side of it.”
“Can I borrow a jumper?” Draco asked, walking out. Harry nodded, tossing him an extra from his bag. It was an older one, a soft blue color. It smelled like Harry. He brushed his teeth and walked out into the kitchen, “Breakfast?”
“Fine.” Potter disapperated on the spot.
“Pansy—I don’t need to ask yours.”
His mother looked at him with wide eyes, “I—ok.”
“My wife isn’t here today because she is traveling for work, but she’ll be back next week. Our relationship has improved drastically. Susan was willing to admit it later, but she considered leaving me during the dark times. I refused to talk about Amelia, and it’s all she wanted to do. It felt like I was shutting her out, and after a while she wondered if I would ever let her back in again. And I did, it just took some time. And it hurt at first to talk about Amelia, and how great of a witch she was. And it’s still hard when I see someone who is about her age, because I wonder what she would be doing. Probably would be married by now, have a couple of young ones of her own. Peter has made me a grandparent, named his eldest daughter Amelia but they call her Lia for short.”
“But you didn’t know about magic when you went to Hogwarts.” Lily said.
“We went over the basic construct of how to do it, as outlined in the chapter for homework. I suggest you both read it diligently.”
Potter snorted, “Absolutely. Fucking love chocolate. You?”
“I don’t wear any of it—I’ve never worn any of the pieces I gave you. I still have plenty.” She said with a wave of her hand.
“You ready?” Harry asked.
“Sometimes.” She nodded.
James agreed and then added, “Ravenclaw is the team to beat this year.” They talked about Quidditch for a bit, and Harry got distracted about why he was there in the first place.
“Yes.” Draco said as he grabbed the blanket to curl up under, “Stupid Gryffindor colors.”
They ended up eating dinner in Isaac’s quarters. Draco had only ever seen Snape’s rooms, so he was excited to see Isaac’s. The three of them sat at dinner and ate until Draco was so full he thought he would burst—and then Lindsey brought out tiny pies. Draco laughed until he thought he would split in two. The siblings told lots of stories about growing up. And despite Lindsey’s struggles, she sounded proud of her childhood. Isaac was fifteen years older, so Lindsey mostly remembered how much he bullied her (as big brothers tend to do).
“Her identifying features have been marred. We need your diagnostics. You said you ran tests on her.” Potter said.
She winked at him, “I think your bias for your colors.” He smirked.
“I want to try something.” Draco said into the kiss, “If it doesn’t work—you’ll have an orgasm.”
“Why does everyone know that?” Draco adjusted his messenger bag a bit as he walked toward McGonagall’s classroom.
Also I'm terribly sorry for the late update. Bit of an emergency this week, so even though this chapter was written I didn't think about updating. Thanks for your patience!
“Matcha latte?”
He looked around his room for a moment, then closed the door behind them. He put his soufflé down carefully, wrapping the blanket around him a bit tighter before looking back up at his Mother.
“I’m sure.” Harry laughed, giving his left hand to Guinevere. The buzzing started immediately.
“I’ll get the paste.” Harry said, hopping up.
“Definitely all the Indian food spots.” Harry was practically salivating at the thought, “probably some thai food—definitely some pizza.” Harry groaned, his hand on his stomach. Draco was quiet as they walked, but Harry could nearly feel the tension rolling off of him. He bumped his shoulder as they got closer. Draco huffed.
“You two want dinner?” Harry asked.
“He gave Smith the dressing down he deserved.” Madam Pumfrey said as she removed the bandages on his legs, smiling a bit, “Like I said—there is a list of us.”
“I’m just here so he knows.” Draco said, “I won’t try anything unless something goes horribly wrong.” He promised. There was a loud explosion and Draco turned to the house, “We got to go in.”
“Is that wine? I could use a glass—or a bottle.” Isaac looked exhausted, and then frowned, “Didn’t mean to scare you.” Draco looked to Harry, who had jumped up with his wand in hand.
gone on three dates since Ginny’s death and each one had ended in a disaster. They made him feel more alone than ever. It had taken days to recover from each event, he felt so hallow afterword.
Draco did make it back to St. Mungo’s right before Harry’s potion wore off. He ordered him more pain medication that was administered by Sherry and watched another healer re-wrap the bandages. It was difficult to keep a degree of separation, and Draco was sure to point out when the healer did something wrong.
“Your Mum?”
“You did.”
He was sleeping on his stomach, his one arm off the couch and his other arm underneath his pillow. The sheet was tangled in his legs, so his back was exposed. Draco tried not to stare too long as he set the hangover potion on the coffee table by Potter’s head. He looked different asleep—younger and less dangerous. His mop of a hair was all over the place, despite its shorter length. Draco let out a shaky breath, walking back into his room and closing the door softly behind him.
Come say Hi on tumblr. I'm sad this story is over so I need friends to dry my tears.
this was real, but it felt like somehow he was far away. He pulled his legs tighter to himself as tears fell without stopping, “I—I didn’t fight him. He was so
“I’m feeling great.” Harry answered.
“You spilled the beans to my boss that we’re fucking—so I can’t heal you anymore.”
Draco had slept through the night but woke up at five in the morning. His shift today was a bit later, but he had already slept his eight hours. He heard the floo, which meant Hermione had gotten home from her night shift so he walked out into the kitchen.
“She still won’t say how she got it either.” Draco said, running his fingers through his hair feeling a bit awkward. Hermione looked at him.
“Sometimes I feel like—I don’t know, that you might not want to see me and I’m just always there.”
“Draco, I’m not going anywhere. I’ve punched you in my sleep, remember?”
“It’s not the same Potter!” Draco growled, he felt like something angry had roared to life inside of him, “You are the Hero of the Wizarding World! No one can say no to you. You can be a lay-a-bout and no one is going to knock on your door and tell you not to do it. We’re not the same at all! I
“You’re ok.” Blaise said, moving a bit closer. Harry tensed, but then let out a slow breath as he tried to relax again.
“I do, how are you?”
“Shit Draco.” Potter said, standing on his toes to see his arm.
“I left her behind seventh year. She resented being left behind—she couldn’t accept the fact that despite being alone with Mione for months, we did
“Have you eaten anything?”
“Have you ever fucked him?” Viktor asked, waggling his brows at Harry. Harry reached out and brushed his shoulder. The touching just as easy and breathless as it had been at brunch. Draco wished he could do that.
The room waited with bated breath, watching the stubs of legs to see if the potion would continue to eat more flesh. The whole room was silent and they waited. Draco timed it for two minutes and it didn’t look like anything happened. He let out a breath and the tension broke in the room.
“We were lost?” Potter asked, looking at Hermione.
“She was stunning.” Harry agreed a bit wistfully, closing the album and placing it carefully back on the shelf. It still hurt to think of Ginny, but not like it once did. He had loved Ginny with everything he had, and he still did love her. But he loved Draco too, and fell more and more in love with him every day. There was a picture on the shelf of Harry and Draco’s wedding. It was one of the goofy ones and one of Harry’s favorites. The entire family was in the picture—all the Weasley’s and Malfoy’s parents too. Cissa and Lucius stood stiff while the rest of the family were going a bit crazy. Harry had jumped into Draco’s arms and licked his cheek, Lily was making a funny face, Scorpius was sitting on Albus’s shoulders, George was setting of a firework, Ron’s hair changed blue, Teddy had given himself a pig nose. It was all around pandemonium.
“Night Sherry!”
“Do you want me to stop?” Harry asked.
“I already told you Potter, I don’t mind when you touch me.” Draco was suddenly glad for the counter between them. He wasn’t sure if Potter did it on purpose. But it made it seem a bit easier. If Harry had been touching him, or sitting beside him he might have been more inclined to lie. But Potter staring him dead on with a bit of space felt more business like. Like Draco could say
“War does that.” Draco said, then frowned. Lindsey nudged his arm.
“First you’re going to eat, because you’re skin and bones.” Draco plopped down a massive scone in front of him, all the fixings floated in not too far behind it.
“Prob-probably be-because y-you
“Y-yes.”
“I don’t know—it’s complicated.” Draco said, firing up the oven.
Draco nodded, “It did. Maybe it eased the way for this transition.” Hermione frowned but Draco continued, “Just don’t act that way when I start sleeping with your other best friends.” Draco said with a grin.
“Who did your ink?” Guinevere asked, midway through Harry’s tattoo.
.” Harry gasped when the fingers pulled out of him, clenching down and aching with emptiness. The nudge of Draco’s cock had him whining again, pulling onto Draco’s shoulders and biting more. Draco glided inside in a long slow push. Harry moved his hand, not quite being able to articulate just how
“S-so close.” Draco stuttered, arching his back.
“Yes.” She said nodded quickly, so they headed up to the cash register. He put the bottle of ink, a quill, and a few rolls of new parchment on the table.
“He came over to mine last weekend—it just happened! Then we went on a date on Friday—”
Games made everyone relax just a bit. Harry and Draco mixed up teams to make sure everyone co-mingled. And before too long, everyone was having a good time. Sherry thought George Weasley was positively hilarious. Molly had entirely way too much wine and couldn’t stop giggling even when nothing was happening. Arthur and John hit it off ras they apparently both have a weird fascination with muggle things.
?” He asked.
“Astoria was dying for the last five years of her life.”
“You’re so harry.” Draco said, kissing across his chest.
“I am so sorry Draco.”
“Just remember when you’re running this floor that I got you there.” Sherry said, making Draco laugh.
“Yeah—nearly got me thrown back in Azkaban. Hermione defended me, so McGonagall happened to lose the letter telling the aurors I broke my parole. I was assured she would not lose the letter again. After everything Hermione did for me, I started calling her Hermione.”
Then they got into a huge discussion about role-play, which Draco just listened to. He wasn’t too interested, but he liked hearing Harry give his opinion. The pleasant buzz from the alcohol warmed him, but he was sure he would be cold without Harry’s body heat. Harry’s hand hadn’t moved from his leg, his thumb moving in small circles. Draco didn’t think Harry realized he as doing it.
“Yes. Yes. It’s hilarious. How drunk are you two?” She asked, then bent down to pick up the discarded and empty bottle of firewhiskey, “You two should get to bed. Harry, please sleep on the couch. I don’t trust you to take the floo.”
“Yeah.” Quidditch had been a distraction for Draco’s nerves. He packed a few prototypes to show George, if he let Draco get that far. Draco was wrapped up in his own head as he pushed through the doors into the Slytherin locker room. He stripped and turned on the shower head.
That did sound like a good idea. Like going to Madam Pumfrey to pick up some headache medicine, “Yeah—yeah ok.” He nodded.
*French is curtesy of google translate. Sorry if it sounds robotic...it's cause it was a robot that gave me the translations.
“I’m going to get you a shirt like that.” Draco said to Harry.
“What is going on?” Harry’s voice carried.
letters screaming at Draco. Draco was on the floor on opposite side of the bed from the door, so he was hoping Harry wouldn’t see him. The yelling letters stopped abruptly, “Draco?” Potter’s voice was softer, but still far away. Draco just kept his head down, trying not to sniffle. It was a vain hope. Draco felt, rather than saw, Potter walk around the bed. He could feel his eyes staring at him, “Draco.” He sounded broken.
“He lives with Hermione—not too far from Ron and I. About a ten minute walk.”
“Yes.” Draco said.
“Precisely.” Hermione tucked her hair behind her ears, “Now out with it—tell me about your shag fest. Or I’ll start talking about mine.”
“Ugh—stop being flirtatious. It’s disgusting.” Weasley grumbled.
Lindsey flushed, “Shit, that was a bit presumptuous of me wasn’t it?”
“Yeah.” Harry managed to say.
“Don’t worry about it.” Draco shook his head. He had more money than he knew what to do with anyway. And despite Lucius’s idiocy when it came to ideology, he was no idiot when it came to finance. Draco’s grandchildren’s grandchildren could afford to be lay-abouts. Lindsey was quiet as they left the store, and Draco wasn’t quite sure why.
“I did not mean to upset you Harry by speaking of it. It is strange that while suffering you want people to bring it up, and yet you don’t want to speak of it.” Her voice was heavy with experience, “When Lucius was in Azkaban, both times, I didn’t want to speak of it and yet it was the only thing I wanted to think about.” Harry understood that deeply.
“Wouldn’t matter—it’s written in code.”
“Ew.” Draco’s voice was scratchy and weak. Harry snorted, well aware that it was sort of ridiculous to think it was gross considering how prolific he was at blowjobs.

“I think quite glad to be back in the same house.” Gary said with a grin, “Albus and his friend Scorpius are upstairs in their room. James is downstairs playing one of those muggle video games. Lily is watching him play.”
Malfoy’s long fingers wrapped around the tea cup, his thumb rubbing along the lip of it. He was wearing a charcoal grey sweater made of thick material for the winter and black slacks. His hair was pushed back, but it looked from his fingers pushing it back rather than the gel he used to use to slick it back all those years ago.
“Yes—I went to court with Harry for an auror case. The bad guys attacked us.”
“You should get some muggle sex toys. I want to try them out.” Draco told Potter.
“I think they wanted the story of big Alpha Harry Potter fucking them more than they wanted the reality of just me.” Harry said with a roll of his eyes.
“Don’t let Dermtree work on me.” Draco told John in the elevator, making him laugh.
forever.”
Harry grinned, climbing back into bed, “About time they started pulling their weight.” Hermione laughed, “Lily said it was the longest deliberation of housing placement in a century, according to McGonagall.”
“I hope you didn’t break anything!” Draco hollered back.
“Cheers.” He said with a smile, his face flush from being around so many people.
“He’s a werewolf. They wouldn’t heal him so I had to do it myself—I don’t think I could light a candle when I finished healing him.”
“Yes. The brown bag protected it.” Harry told him, placing it on a small table, “Is the wine safe?” Draco was holding a bag with two bottles of wine in it. He placed it down next to the grocery bag.
“Draco you should not be with a man who made you take Viritaserum to prove it wasn’t you.”
saved his butt. Winston had been doing a presentation on new Dark Arts information and Draco had nearly dozed off. It was only thanks to a swift elbow to the ribs that he was able to stay awake and answer whatever question Winston had asked.
“Well, maybe it’s time to do something for yourself.” Hermione pointed out.
—how fragile he was and I—” Her voice broke.
“They rag on you a lot.” Harry told Draco with a smile.
“Draco?” Harry called to him.
“It’s like you had no upbringing at all.” Sherry said with a sigh.
“What?” Harry asked, looking to Draco.
“I can in the morning—you have to go in tomorrow?”
“Yeah.” Potter said, but he still looked a little lost.
“But obviously I changed my life around, I’ve been a model citizen since I left.” Draco said, fixing the collar of his jacket.
“Metastasized?”
“I haven’t gotten it to work yet.” He looked down at his fingers, still avoiding Potter’s gaze.
“That was my father, but yes.”
Draco looked up at him, “Yes I do.”
He tossed it aside without finishing it and opened another.
“I’m trying to get the judge that signed off on it punished, but it is proving difficult.” Harry confessed.
“Mine were deemed illegible”
“Now he listens.” Draco said with a frown. Harry laughed loudly, leaning over Draco to kiss his shoulder, then between his shoulder blades. He took his sweet time kissing down his back, his fingers dragging along Draco’s thighs, “Harry.” His name came out breathless.
“S-stupid.” Draco whispered to himself, trying not to think about what happened to him even though it was all he could think about.
“No—Hermione is smarter than the rest of us—so I don’t think so.” Draco said, “Want me to preform the sober up charm?”
Harry didn’t hesitate, “Come on then.” Harry stood up and walked over to Malfoy’s bed.
“No. I don’t. Because you won’t tell me how to help you.”
Draco kept his nose against Harry’s neck as they both came down.
“Feeling better Hermione, thank you.” He had never used her first name before, but now was a good a time to start as any.
“I dunno.” Draco looked around and found a clock on the wall, “Shit. It’s two A.M.”
“No—you’re staying here.” Draco said sternly, “You aren’t well enough yet. I will keep you overnight for observation.”
“What will you do when they play each other?”
“Draco.” Harry grumbled when he sat back down in bed.
“We had a big party at our house.” Harry said, “Ginny said we weren’t allowed to be sad. I was anyway.” He smiled, “We used to play a game after she got chemo, trying to guess how long it would take before she started throwing up.”
Harry smiled brilliantly, “Out of the two of us, I don’t think I’m the one who has to worry about going bald.”
“Fucking fuck.” He whispered into the table.
“I run an apothecary. Part of it is being able to diagnose issues. Not quite the level of a healer, but something underneath.”
“It’s not that I’m running away from my past—it’s just that I’ve worked hard to get to where I am.” Draco said patiently, “I
“Blaise, you staying over?” Draco asked.
A growl made them all freeze.
“Doing quite well, she gets invited to all the social events of the season.” Harry nodded and Malfoy smirked, “Not going to inquire after my father?”
“Really? That’s a new excuse.” Ron looked at Harry, “You believe this shit?”
“I can help too.” Harry said, pulling out his phone, “What do you want? Chinese? Pizza?”
“STOP!” Potter yelled, “Stop. I’m gunna come if you keep this up.”
be tolerated at Hogwarts.
Potter laughed, reaching out his hand to Draco. Draco immediately wove his fingers through his and pulled him close. Draco put his scroll on the bedside table and curled into Potter, kissing him briefly.
“No.” Isaac assured him.
diapers. He kept his face covered.
“Most of the time.”
Potter nodded, he leaned off the bed a bit dangerously and reached for his wand. The effort to crawl on his hands was probably more than just getting up—but Draco understood the sentiment. He grabbed the wand and crawled back on top of Draco. He cast the spell and Draco sighed as he cast the one on the sheets too. Potter leaned forward and kissed Draco again, and Draco wove his fingers through Potter’s hair. Potter rolled off of him to the side.
“And I advise you keep romantic dalliances outside the classroom.” She said with a raised brow. Draco took a step away from Luna.
“I promise I will limit my amount of distracting.” Harry smiled as he pressed his lips against Draco. Draco laughed into the kiss, “Now get some sleep. You need to recover.”
. His heart felt like it was being ripped in tiny pieces. But Draco had found him, he apologized, groveled, and swore that he would never ask Harry again for favors for his family. Harry pointed out that he knew he was prejudice against Slytherins, he would work on it. But he didn’t think he would ever be comfortable with the idea of helping rich people get away with shit because they were rich.
“Potter you better not be getting ideas.” Draco said sternly.
“Yeah.” Draco nodded. Potter grinned at him before putting Draco down and dropping to his knees.
“I’ll forgive you today for having your feet up on my station.” Sherry said, her harsh tone not matching the smile on her face, “Congratulations Draco.”
followed him. No one held open the double doors for him, so he pulled the patient through the door.
“No—not really. But I don’t really go into the magical community a lot in America—I’m a squib.” Lindsey told him, taking a huge sip of butterbeer. Potter nodded as he took a sip of his own butterbeer, but didn’t look phased by her answer.
“You like men.” Hermione said it out loud, which made Harry feel like the air was sucked out of his lungs.
“Healer Malfoy.” Pope acquiesced, “You were the healer when Rachel came into the emergency room?”
“Oh—hello.” A light voice made him jump. Lovegood was standing in the entranceway.
“No—just made breakfast.” Harry said again, feeling self-conscious.
“Blaise.” Draco interrupted, walking into the bedroom.
to anyway.” Draco was quiet but he reached out with his hand to tangle his fingers between Harry’s.
“You guys see them?” Harry asked.
“You can’t change the past—just endeavor to do better next time.” Draco told her.
“What the fuck?” Ron barged into his house one morning holding the Prophet, “Was there some Death Eater-Auror reach out program?”
Draco cringed, “No thank you. I doubt the Weasel would win any awards in a shag fest.”
Finding out
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ok.” Draco agreed easily. He probably would have agreed to anything Potter asked for at the moment, but Potter didn’t know that. Or at least Draco didn’t think he did, “Bedroom. You’re not fucking me against a wall.” Potter actually carried him to the room, which was impressive given that Draco was a bit taller than Potter. Not by much.
Draco rolled his eyes, finishing the last of his martini, “Shall we get out of here?”
“I figured. Is that lipstick?” Potter pointed at his neck.
“Then I’ll be brief.” Kingsley said, winking before stepping up onto the small stage. He put the wand to his throat and must have done the spell soundless because his voice boomed, “Welcome!” The crowd around all stopped talking, turning to Kingsley, “Welcome to the Fifth Year Anniversary of the End of the Wizarding War.” There was polite clapping, “I’m so glad to see so many friendly faces out there. Thanks so much for coming out tonight. It is good to see some of you dress up for once.” There was polite laughter, “Without further ado, I introduce the reason why we’re all here—Harry Potter.”
“What do you like about having sex with Draco, Harry?” Hermione asked, knowing the spiked alcohol George made would have more effect with a direct question. Harry instantly covered his mouth with his hand, making Draco chuckle. But Draco was curious what the answer would be. When Harry garbled the answer in his hand, it was unintelligible.
“I didn’t know about Snape.”
He was right. Draco sort of got lost as Potter explained each of the dishes, but nodded along. Some had chicken, and some had something called paneer, which was a cheese that Draco had never heard of before. They had stuff that was green, and stuff that was orange—but it all sort of looked like throw up. But it tasted
“You look handsome too.” Draco complimented.
“No. It wasn’t fair. But life isn’t fair.” Park said.
“Daddy?” Lilly’s voice pulled him from his musings.
“That’s the spirit.” Blaise said, hopping up to his feet, “I’ll be back in a few hours.” The door shut and Hermione and Ron both turned to him.
Draco collapsed on Potter’s back as Potter’s legs fell flat. It was a bit sticky and gross, but Draco was too content to care. Draco moved off to the side and Potter put his head on his shoulder, throwing a leg between his own. It was a bit strange—Draco never thought about holding him like this. He always pictured himself in a more submissive role—but he liked it. Draco squeezed Potter tight just as a cleaning charm went over them.
As Draco sauntered off to talk to other people, Harry made his rounds through the important people to talk to.
“Then let’s get clean and then maybe something to eat.” The slick wasn’t as bad as it normally was, but it still didn’t feel comfortable.
“No need for that—where would you like to go?” Harry asked, “The portkey isn’t until six. We could go to Wizarding Paris to have lunch—or muggle Paris.”
Draco snatched the tile off the counter before Hermione could grab it. He sent the message and set it back down on the table.
“You liked Aleksander.” Draco accused.
“I’m going to call you old at thirty-seven and see how you feel.” Harry said with a scowl, “I still rank in sexiest wizards alive in Witch Weekly, thank you very much.”
“When you’re being an arse!” Draco declared right as Harry pushed his index finger inside. Draco pushed back on his finger, accepting him with little difficulty. Virgin he might be, but he was no newbie to arse play. Harry’s cock pulsed with need watching his index finger move in and out of Draco. His thumb moved along his perineum. Harry didn’t rush his movements, letting his finger drag in and out. Draco had beads of sweat starting to pool on his stomach, his hair a bit matted. He loved seeing Draco this fallen apart, he was determined to watch him completely melt.
“We’ll have to break in every room in this house—it’s going to take forever.” Draco said.
“I’ll see what I can do.” Harry didn’t swear to do it, he wasn’t sure if he would survive this anyway. Ron squeezed his hand as he sat down in the chair next to his bed.
“Everything packed?”
He said how he didn’t realize how much he didn’t care about Vincent until he died, and how horrible it made him feel. Vince wasn’t a
“I know that.” Draco rolled his eyes, “Think you could eat some food?”
“George gave it to me.” Harry replied proudly, he turned to glance at the French toast behind him, “Hey Scor—you want breakfast?”
Despite that thought, Draco’s feet carried him to Potter’s room. He wasn’t surprised to find him still sitting there.
He walked out of the floo, pulling off his healer’s robes at the same time. He sent them to the washer. Potter was sitting on one of the barstools, reading a book.
“You sure? It’s your first time—I was just going to do it once.” Draco said.
“Not my problem. I refuse to be left here alone.”
And consciousness evaded him again.
Scorpius sighed, “We just—it’s odd dating your step sister. We didn’t know how to tell everyone.”
“I need all hands on deck!” Winston yelled, and Draco bit back a groan as he stood up. His brain was fuzzy as he walked toward Winston. He was adjusting his collar as the other Healers of the floor walked up—there were twelve Healers on the Dark Arts floor plus Winston, “The Unspeakables did something stupid.” Winston usually wasn’t so cavalier about things—but he was about unspeakables. He thought their job was needlessly reckless, “There are ten of them coming in. How many of you have been on shift for more than ten hours.” Five people raised their hand including Sammy and Draco, “Fifteen?” Sammy and Draco kept their hands up, “You two will be floating in and helping the others.” Draco nodded. He would usually protest—but he felt like horseshit.
what I do. I
He thought he might get sick.
It was silent as they both looked over the menu, and soon the waiter came over. She looked nervous, so Harry smiled encouragingly at her before she bustled off to get them their tea.
He had played it off in Potter’s room, but the conversation with Healer Park had really hurt Draco. Draco kept going over it in his head as he went through the day. It hurt worse that Draco had respect for Healer Park. And here Park just thought he was a Death Eater that snuck into the Healer program. At the end of Draco’s shift, he walked to Park’s office.
“Well we had a great day.” Lindsey cut off Isaac ranting about old policies.
“Congratulations Dad.” Mathews punched his shoulder.
Harry laughed, “No, I guess not. Still mostly reading and researching.”
“I feel better—Draco has been helping me.” Harry motioned over his shoulder. Draco had slid into the booth, talking to the waitress.
“This morning.” Draco answered. He had never been happier to see that fucking island get smaller in the distance. Fuck dementors. Fuck prison, “Mother did a cheering charm.”
“Chin up Potter, you’re not a hopeless case.” Zabini said, the chair making a noise as he sat down.
Harry kissed his forehead. Draco’s jaw ached from keeping his jaw clenched tightly, his
“No—for Harry after he finishes his speech.” Draco said.
“I’m sorry.” Potter said again as he pulled off his jacket.
“I—I really don’t have the energy to tell you what was said.”
“I would have hated that. I
“But I was recently reminded by how much we have gained. This morning, my best friends were making pancakes, my boyfriend sitting next to me, and I felt peace for the first time on this day in five years.
Draco smiled briefly, trying to digest it. He couldn’t believe he didn’t see this coming. But he tried to think back how many nights they had slept alone—and it was hardly ever. Unless Harry was away on a case.
“Don’t force me to choose.”
Harry unlocked his hands, placing them on Draco’s knees to keep them open. Harry wrapped his arms beneath Draco’s back, changing the angle just a little bit where Draco
Draco looked at him, “You think I could do it?”
“So you’re saying if I was open to different options, I might have been sorted differently.”
“You look so beautiful.” Draco murmured, it was true. Harry had turned a bit red from the experience, sweating just enough to look sexy.
Harry let out a harsh breath, his heart pounding a bit, “I don’t want you to not hate me because of gratitude. I did those things because I believed they were the right thing to do.”
It still felt like he was walking through water. He couldn’t really focus on what was in front of him as he walked down the stairs. He stopped on the main level when he could hear everyone talking down in the kitchen. There was some murmuring and laughing. He sat on the last step and put his head in his hands.
“You do this for a living?” Draco asked.
“How’d you get in here?” Draco squeaked, covering himself up.
Draco laughed, “We’re nineteen, I think we need some time to know where all our body parts are before we’re kinky.”
Draco laughed, “I’m sure he’ll be in here sooner or later.” Probably because he would get injured, but Patricia didn’t need to know that, “I’ll be in here Monday.”
“Just a bit weird to talk about people like a science experiment.” Jack said.
McGonagall looked at him like a puzzle she hadn’t figured out yet, “You are quite right, Mr. Malfoy. Slytherin is an honorable house, and though it is not for the reasons your father thinks it is, it is no less honorable.”
“Well, let’s eat some snacks.” Potter said with a clap of his hands. Draco let out a breath, turning to him with a small smile. He was just grateful the attention was now off of him.
“That’s a muggle bar.” Weasel said.
“Is that muggle medicine?”
“Father disapproves.”
, it doesn’t dispute the facts. This girl was systematically abused over a long period of time.”
“This has as many steps as Grimmauld.” Potter whinged behind him.
“Her life was brutal, you were a glimmer of happiness in her otherwise terrifying life. She has found peace.” Winston said, “You will have to make your own peace with that. Go ahead and go home, Draco. Have a relaxing weekend and I’ll see you on Monday.”
Potter huffed, looking up at Draco with a glare, “I-I-I can’t sleep alone!” He rubbed his face, “N-not of-often. Isaac is-is is helping me.” Draco was quiet as Potter stared at his knees, “I sl-sleep with ‘M-‘M-‘Mione at H-Hogwarts. It s-started this sum-summer. I-I-I’d sleep w-w-with R-R-Ron. L-L-Like a child.” It was quiet as the information sunk in. Potter looked so young curled up into himself and Draco’s heart ached.
“I’m ok.” Draco said.
“Blake is the best there is.” Harry affirmed, “But I think I am a bit hopeless when it comes to being on time—or being organized really. Hermione always says I could be dangerous if I was well organized.”
I have BIG NEWS.... *drum roll* I got a tumblr! It's Caedes12.tumblr.com.... I confess to being a frequent stalker of tumblr, but I haven't had my own since high school. And I never used it. So now I'm being a big girl. Come say helllooo. I don't know what I'm doing...
He had to get home.
“I can’t do that anyway.” Hagrid answered, “Now on 3. 3. 2. 1.”
Ron turned to Hermione who turned a bit pink, “I’ve shopped at his store a few times.” It was a sort of Borgin and Burkes shop that had a bit of everything. There was an apothecary section and a books section. Harry had actually been in it as well.
“His father’s fortune helps.” His father said flatly.
“Harry?” He called out. He walked into his room and scowled—all Harry’s stuff was gone, “Fuck.”
“You—you’re Harry Potter.” She whispered.
“That was because he thought I was going to call you mean things and hex you constantly.”
“It’s not as bad as it could have been. The Prophet’s is the worst, of course. But they still included Harry’s quote.”
“Ok. Well then, I’ll see you the Monday after you graduate. I’ll send an owl with my official offer.” George stood up, adjusting his jacket. Draco immediately stood up.
“I know—I should just tell him.” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose.
Harry let out a breath, “Will I have normal heats?”
“Good.” Harry said.
That had Weasley breaking out into a large grin, “She is too good for me.” He turned to Harry, “You really think she’ll say yes?”
“Draco.” Harry said his name so emotionally that Draco’s whole body tingled. And like the coward he could be sometimes, he didn’t have the courage to look up to see if Harry was just as effected as he was, “Draco.” He whispered his name again like a prayer, a request. Draco gripped Potter’s hips a bit tighter before looking up. As soon as Draco met Harry’s eyes, he knew he wasn’t alone. Harry’s green eyes were wide, his breathing short. Draco crawled up a bit, wrapping his arms underneath Harry to hold him close. The kiss was desperate, Harry’s grip on his back
“You got a tattoo.” Harry said with a grin.
“Sit back and flip over—I want your arse.” Harry told him. Draco smiled up at him before obliging. He wiggled out of his pants and Harry pulled them the rest of the way off.
Draco pointed at her with his spatula, “Pot—kettle.”
“No such thing.” Potter interjected, stealing some shredded cheese from Draco’s plate and eating it.
“Do you not want to come to a Weasley’s?” George asked, raising a brow.
“How’s everyone’s eyebrows?” Potter asked, a scorch mark on his cheek but otherwise fine.
“I’m starving.” Harry told Malfoy, pulling the collar of his coat a bit closer. He had worn a thinner coat as spring was just around the corner, but it was a bit too cold still for it. Malfoy locked the door of his shop and then the wards slid down over the building. Harry shivered, his magic felt like ice water.
“I love you too.” He said, kissing her head.
“I didn’t say that Draco.” Harry let out a sigh.
Draco’s anxiety. The feelings that were too soon to talk about or maybe even acknowledge, but still beneath the surface. Harry was glad Draco didn’t try to speak anymore. They just held each other, waiting for his knot to go down.
“Fine.” Potter still had a grin on his face as he leaned over and kissed Draco as he buttoned up his jeans, “Seen my shirt?”
“You got a little something right here.” She pointed at his neck.
happy.” Draco said. She grinned, tears in her eyes.
“I’m not.” Draco said, “You already made your choice.”
“I can’t believe—this doesn’t feel real.” Draco said again. She weaved her fingers through his hair, holding him close to her. She kissed his head again.

“Anything Luna has given you.”
“I—I don’t know! I’m nineteen!”
“I am terribly sorry my fame bothers you.” Harry said.
“Did you get the bad guy?” Draco asked.
“I—I’m weirdly glad you have seen it. I didn’t think I would be, but I am.” Harry looked away from Draco, “I don’t like talking about it much, doesn’t do much to talk about it anyway.”
“It’s not just
“Yes.” Harry answered decisively.
“Do your parents know?”
“Some of these you might want to try.” George waggled his brows, sliding away from him as he walked up the stairs. Harry let go of Draco’s hand, following after him. They walked up to a small, but well decorated flat. It had just enough knick-knacks to give it a warm feel, but not so cluttered it became overwhelming. The flat smelled like George—a comforting smell with just a strong dose of mischief beneath it. Draco’s shoulders were tense.
to be there.”
“I dunno.” Harry frowned, but his face changed as Draco pushed inside of him, “
“We’ll be here when it does.” She promised, moving back a bit and looking at him, “Blaise is on his way over with clothes. Says he is going to take a bedroom until you kick him out. Molly is sending over food. I managed to keep her from coming over with all the Weasleys.”
reason why Draco worked hard, but it was certainly one of them.
“I’m in agony at every moment, I’ve barely slept. That doesn’t even include how
“I love you so much.” Harry pressed a kiss to his lips.
“I do. And Tuscany is lovely this time of year.” Harry grinned, weaving his fingers through the hair at the nape of Draco’s neck, “One of those big Tuscan villa’s—we could sit out on the patio and drink until we pass out. That sounds so much better than our evening.”
“Then let’s go.” Harry grasped his arm and Draco prepared to be apparated.
“Ok—you can tell me to stop.” Harry said, showing Draco both his hands before unbuttoning the top button, then the next one, “I sort of expected green pants.” He was wearing blue boxer briefs.
Draco loved getting hard like this. It was the lazy sort of arousal you didn’t notice until it was consuming you. Harry moved slow, down his chest, a flat tongue rolled over his nipple, causing sparks to go down his spine. His hands moved down Draco’s chest, his calloused fingers leaving fire in their wake. They always gripped him
“You know, what goes around comes around.” Potter said, and Draco snorted.
Weasel looked confused, “Why is that—
“Morning Mr. Potter.” His assistant greeted, holding out a cup of coffee. His assistant was a gift from Merlin. He was highly organized and was always fifteen minutes early to meetings. Blake was incredible at his job.
“Ok.” Potter said, looking brighter but still not happy.
Draco let out a half deranged laugh, “I hated myself for everything I did. So when you didn’t answer my letter eighth year, I went to the prefect’s bathroom in Hogwarts and decided to end it. I had been threatening to for years—but you two didn’t care about me anymore. I had
Draco nodded, “It’ll take time, but he’ll trust them eventually. Does he do the full moons at school?”
“Fuck no.” Draco rests his forehead on Potter’s shoulder as he tugs again. His thumb rubs across the tip and Draco’s hips flinch now for an entirely different reason. He couldn’t help the small whimper that left his lips, so Potter made the same motion again.
“A few on your chest from the burn hex, and a few on your leg from the same hex.” Madam Pumfrey answered.
“I bet.” Matilda frowned. She was sitting on the floor with her legs crossed on the carpet, “Of course Slytherin doesn’t get any comfy stuff—we’re supposed to be cold and mean.”
“Indian is meant to be eaten with your hands.” Potter said with a cocky grin. Draco just scowled, “Have you been?”
“Does that make you First Lady?” Draco only glared at him, “You are a very beautiful First Lady.”
“I think something might be wrong—I am wet again.” Harry frowned.
Her eyes sparkled up at him. Patty looked to be late fifties and had brown eyes, “This March it has been five years since I lost Bill.” Harry had the good sense not to say he couldn’t believe it had already been that long. To him it felt like yesterday, but he was sure it didn’t feel like that to her, “I’m a bit worried how I will react—especially since I have a new boyfriend.”
“It’s not a pureblood tradition to put house elf heads on the wall?”
Draco quirked an eyebrow, but pulled off his own boxers, tossing them to the side. Potter sat up, his large hand wrapping around Draco’s cock. His grip was hot and he pulled
“Were you—were you worried I would be mad at you?” Sammy asked.
“What does it do?”
“Can you find the amount of werewolves necessary to do a study?” Harry asked.
“Because I’m not a heathen.” Draco replied, taking a small bite sliding the fork through his teeth.
“Bacon? Eggs?”
“It’s not
“Do you think they’ll cave?”
Harry grinned, “Well, I broke my fair share at Hogwarts so it wouldn’t be fair of me to criticize my children for it.” He motioned to the bar stools on the island, “Sit.” Both boys climbed onto the chairs, “I’d shake your hand Scorpius, but they’re a bit gross at the moment.”
Potter snorted, “Not easily, that’s for sure. Ron did a lot of groveling.”
“Thanks for coming Harry.” Luna said as she stepped up to him.
“What happened?”
“Potter, I my portkey leaves soon.”
. This time they could just be Potter and Malfoy.
Draco looked up at him, “It’s a good one Harry.” Harry kissed him, pulling on his shirt. It slipped off his shoulders.
“You two want to come back to mine for a night cap?” George asked, standing at the end of the booth. The bar had emptied out after the dinner rush.
Harry’s jaw dropped, “Astoria?”
“Third floor flat.” Potter said before disapparating. Draco waited for as long as he could before following him. He was around the corner from Potter’s apartment, not sure what he was thinking as he walked toward the building. Why was he doing this in the first place?
“What?”
“’Fraid I am Harry Potter.” Harry said, his cheeks a bit red as he held out the pastry box. Kali looked at him with wide as eyes and with pink cheeks she grabbed a pumpkin pasty.
Draco smiled up at Harry when he pulled away, threading his fingers through Harry’s, “Do you have to go to work?”
“Barely—distantly.” Ron waved it off, “Can you imagine? You should jus’write that down in a- in a- note to your father next time he pisses you off.”
Albus rapidly blinked back tears, but they came down his cheeks anyway, “Does this mean you don’t love Mum anymore?”
student.”
Draco sang loudly, reorganizing the shoes to make sure that the fancy dress shoes were at the top, working his way down to the most used shoes at the bottom. Potter always favored function over fashion. And when Draco argued that Potter walked around crime scenes most of the time, so he probably wouldn’t need to worry about function, Potter countered that he
They continued to chat as she continued to draw. Draco felt something in him relax as they nattered on. It was nice to talk about something and nothing with someone his own age. Luna did say some very odd things, but now he found it endearing. She had to explain all sorts of tiny invisible creatures to him, which he told her blatantly that he didn’t believe in but she didn’t seem to mind his disbelief.
“Not too shabby looking yourself Malfoy.” Harry smiled back and leaned in for a kiss.
“Yes. He’s also the youngest son—so he plays second fiddle a lot. So I guess he never really thought that I would like him, or would stay with him.”
Hermione laughed, “Nothing, I’m genuinely asking.”
Harry nodded, “Tomorrow will be fun—for just the two of us.”
Draco smiled, “I’ll remember that—chocolate cake?”
“I am glad she likes it.” Draco said.
Why him? Why did this have to happen to him? Why in the cosmic scheme of things did he have to have this burden? Was this payback for all his past misdeeds? Draco directed the spray towards the wall before sitting down against it. He kept his legs tucked up into himself as he let himself cry. He did it as silently as possible. The sobs hurt as they came out. They felt like they were too large for his chest, burning as they escaped. Draco clutched the back of his head with his hands, crying into his knees.
“We never thought it was permanent until now. We both thought you would be a Healer for a decade, then eventually come back and marry a pureblood witch. You like both, Draco, I don’t understand why you couldn’t have been with a witch.”
“He does keep getting injured. Might want to go out while he is still on top.” Harry argued.
“Thank you Teddy.” His voice choked up and more tears came to his eyes. A chair scratched and everyone turned to look at his Mother. His mother was pointedly not looking in Andromeda’s direction, but neither was Andy.
“Ackerley lasted eight hours before he spilled everything.” Harry explained, easing the purple potion to his lips. It tasted horrid, but Draco finished it. He’d had it before—Snape had given it to him once after Voldemort had—after he had—but it didn’t matter now. He drank the other two without complaint, but he was feeling a bit queasy by the end of it.
“I love you both.” Lucius said, looking at each of them.
“No. He doesn’t mind at all.” Harry said with a grin on his face, kissing Viktor, “As long as you don’t mind me wearing this shirt.” Viktor kissed him again.
I'm new to Tumblr! Caedes12 Please come say HELLO. I barely know what I'm doing.
Hermione snorted, “I would have figured that out ages ago.”
“I’d like to fuck you.” Potter said between kisses.
“I told them you know—Ron and Mione.”
“You come hang out with my friends and see how you feel.”
“Yes, well, the Falcons are doing well this year
Potter raised a brow but nodded, “Ok—you know where my apartment is?”
“You can do wandless magic?” Draco asked.
“Ok—thank you Winky.” Potter eagerly grabbed the tray.
“You’re not supposed to find that funny.” Draco informed him as platters found their way to the table. The food smelled delicious. It was all he could do to keep from reaching out and grabbing the first thing that set down in front of him. Everyone sit down at the table—the entire Weasley family minus the one in dragon hide boots from the bar that Draco
“No but, it sort of goes both ways. Stag is protected me many times.” Potter acquiesced.
Harry grimaced, “For right now I’m just going to focus on being happy. If someone comes down the line, we’ll see what happens.”
Draco chuckled, and then turned to the Weasel, “Your Wheezes cigars are fun.”
“B-but—you don’t to say where you were—but that has to be far.”
“Ready?” Potter asked,
“Do you get jealous?” Draco asked, his body tensing.
“You don’t have to touch it.” Potter said, taking off Draco’s shoes and socks. It was odd having someone else do it, but not unpleasant. Potter took off his own socks and shoes. Potter pulled him to the edge of the bed, leaning over to kiss Draco. Fuck that man could kiss. He didn’t think he had ever met a better kisser. He kissed filthy and yet so pleasurably. Draco felt it all over his body.
“I KNEW IT!” Draco glared at empty space.
“Please.” Draco put the cup down, he stared at up Dumbledore’s portrait, “I know I don’t really deserve to say this—but I am sorry for my part on the tower.”
“We tried that.” Harry argued, frowning.
“He’s going to kill her.”
“Thank you sir.”
“I’m not—I’m not too hungry.” Draco frowned.
“I told ya to stop barkin’ at the merpeople!” It was an unmistakable voice Draco had made fun of for years, “They’re just gunna poke ya, cowardly mutt.”
“Have you done problem four yet for Arithmancy?” Draco asked her, blurting out the first thing that wasn’t controversial that came to mind.
“Just a little tighter.” Draco said breathlessly. Potter adjusted his grip and Draco moaned, “Yes—just like that—
.” Draco assured him. Harry groaned, he had been distracted by Draco’s fingers more times than he could count and to finally have them wrapped around his cock was
“It was Mum’s favorite.” Lily said, sitting in the seat next to Malfoy.
“On the first, Rachel came in with a broken arm. I fixed it and then father and daughter left.”
turned out well. But we’re not done yet. We have to continue down this path, forging past boundaries and reaching across to those we don’t understand. It is understanding tradition and adapting it to fit the current situation. When I was growing up, I had no idea this world existed. To go from being a boy in a cupboard under the stairs to a wizard was a mind-boggling step, I wanted to know everything about the wizarding world. It wasn’t as perfect as what I first thought, but it was still magical—and I do mean that in a figurative sense rather than a literal.” There were some chuckles, “The longer we’re in this world, we forget the awe that we first had when we walked into it. And if we always had it, we don’t understand how overwhelming that first stage is, we get used to the beauty of it all and forget to marvel at it.” Harry smiled, “Let me tell you, refilling alcoholic drinks alone would excite most muggles.” There were chuckles.
“I plan to.” Draco replied.
“Not your fault. I know you were an asshole—still kinda are an asshole.” She elbowed him a bit so he could look up and see her smile, “But I really do love being your friend.”
Potter was liberal with his praise, asking for the recipe during dinner. And Draco couldn’t help but preen a bit. But then they got into the specific cooking methods, which turned into several debates. Draco didn’t realize Hermione and Ron had left them to themselves.
“I don’t care what you were—or what you did. As long as you treat Harry well, I’ll be fine.” Bill said.
“My family—the muggles who raised me—didn’t love me at all.” Potter turned red, like he didn’t mean to blurt out that information but didn’t want Draco to be uncomfortable.
Harry gripped the ugly hospital blanket, “You won’t speak to anyone?”
“Why?” Draco asked, his heart racing.
“In comparison!”
for them? Hubburd is an absolute
“No Pansy.” Draco said softly, but still with conviction. He turned to Theo and Greg, “I’m seeing Potter.”
“To the new little Potter!” One auror cheered, and everyone yelled loudly as they raised their glasses. Harry wrapped his arm around Draco's waist, squeezing it tight as they clinked their glasses with everyone.
“You alright?” Harry asked, looking at him funny.

“Well I hope you brought her a muffin too.” Draco said.
“You haven’t been around.” Draco pointed out before taking a bite of his pancakes. They were delicious.
“Who’s that?” A young girl pointed at him, her blonde hair nearly as white as his own.
“Why didn’t you tell me after the first time you saw each other?”
“No—you can always come here.” Draco said resolutely. Harry’s shoulders dropped as he relaxed and he put his cloak to the side, slipping off his shoes as he crawled on top of the bed.
.” Harry said as he crawled into bed.
“No—I’m fine.” Potter said, wincing as he stood up, “I don’t like pain potions, makes my reflexes slower.”
“That was a long time ago Ron.” Harry was trying to calm his friend down to explain, but Ron seemed intent on yelling.
“Potter.” Malfoy was standing at the end of his bed.
“Well—most of us. And the rest of us just want Harry to be happy.” Draco nodded. He took a deep breath, trying to stop his hands from shaking as he walked behind Arthur out into the dining area.
“To be fair, I didn’t want to play with the giant either.” Harry defended himself, “And I didn’t
Tea and scones were placed on the table. Harry reached across and snagged the chocolate scone, and he noticed Draco grabbed the other chocolate scone.
“I know you said you wouldn’t get mad at me if you had firewhiskey, but I hope muggle whiskey will do.” Malfoy said as he sat down. He had taken off his coat to reveal a forest green sweater.
“I-I think we can head back to your h-house now.” Potter said, moving to stand up.
“You have nothing to be embarrassed about.” Harry said sternly. He pulled back slightly to look in Draco’s eyes. He pushed back some hair that had fallen and cupped his cheek, “You have
you wanted.” Pansy said. Draco felt heat bloom in his chest, he didn’t look over at Harry but he didn’t need to. Draco had what he wanted, he didn’t need the designer robes. Sure, they would be nice, but he didn’t need to suck up to his parents to be happy.
“May I?” Harry asked, pointing to his coat. Draco nodded, so Harry undid the buttons and then the zipper. He pushed the jacket off his shoulders, feeling the body heat come off of him. Harry’s heart was pounding in his chest as he moved slightly to hang up the jacket on one of the coat racks. When he looked back, he was standing entirely too close to Draco. Maybe because he was cold from the rain, but it felt like Draco was a furnace, “May I?” Harry asked again. He was standing too close for the question to mean anything else but the obvious, throwing caution to the wind and feeling like a Gryffindor.
“And the lilies are for your mum.” Draco got back on a happier topic.
“If that happens, I’ll probably demand a trip to the spa.” Draco confessed, “I love a good stone massage.”
“You’re going to kill me.” Draco huffed with a smile on his face as he leaned over Harry. Sweat had his hair pushed back, and the boyish grin made him look younger than he normally did.
“Harry—I will always be on your side. Always. And I’m probably never going to be friends with Ginerva—but I promise I won’t hex her for what she said.”
“Finally he emerges from his cave.” Blaise teased him, handing him a glass of firewhiskey.
Isaac laughed, “No, no. You’re right. I wasn’t a Slytherin.”
“That’s why I don’t use those pepper-ups very often—feels like you been pushed down by a rolling pin.”
“He saved the world!” Lindsey whispered, and Draco cackled.
Molly’s food was incredible, as always, and she piled more food on Harry’s plate when he wasn’t looking. Though it was fair to eat a bit more, he had lost weight since Ginny’s death and hadn’t managed to put it back on. Sometimes it was difficult to remember to eat with so much going on. The Burrow was covered in pictures of her, and Fred of course.
Harry rolled up the paperwork on his desk, looking up to see the people of Diagon walking around the street. There were families and new Wheezes bubbles shaped like animals.
“Alright, I’ll let you two catch up.” She waved her hand before walking out the door.
“I have the savior of the wizarding world with his golden trio, I’ll be fine.” Draco assured her.
“I—I wanted to say that I’m sorry.”
“I’m not fucking with him.” He finally blurted out.
“You’ll tell me if I don’t remember something?”
Harry shifted a bit and grinned, “You could have been an auror.”
And there was something about Harry on his knees that always got Draco on edge. Looking down at Potter’s bobbing head, he groaned.
Why didn’t he think about that?
“Fuck
“I just don’t like fulfilling stereotypes.”
Over the next several weeks, Harry continued to go to Luna’s group. He didn’t talk very much, but he did enjoy listening. Patty became a close friend and confidant, her twinkling eyes always looking out for Harry. Malfoy and Harry had come to some sort of truce where they just wouldn’t talk to one another. Harry thought Malfoy was being childish by refusing to acknowledge his existence, but he wasn’t going to push the envelope. Harry didn’t share his story at group, but he noticed Malfoy hadn’t either. Or at least he hadn’t spoken while Harry was there.
switch to Malfoy. But he never had to say it, thank Merlin, because Draco took his.
was offering him a life line.
His voice squeaked a bit at the end. The lodge in his throat had grown so big he couldn’t swallow and he felt like he might throw up. Draco tried to take a breath but it came in short. He still couldn’t look over at Isaac. He kept staring out the window. The pain of his neck turned was a distraction from everything else he was feeling. Draco didn’t want to blink and see the mental image of what happened. Even now he could smell the whiskey, could feel the pain, “He threw me over the couch and forced himself in me. He raped me.”
Harry opened his mouth to talk, taking a breath before going in for a plunge, “I find myself missing—insane things.” He said with a frown.
“There are a million different things he could do.” Hermione said with a frown.
“No. I like the burn.” Draco said. He bit back a whimper as Potter withdrew his fingers, feeling empty. A door popped open and lube flew to Potter’s hand. He heard the lid pop and the slick sound of Potter coating his own cock. For some unknown reason, Potter decided to take for fucking ever. “Potter, if you don’t put your cock in me in the next five seconds—I’ll murder you. I fucking will.”
“I’m still going to therapy.” He told her softly, he didn’t like to talk about it much despite his enthusiasm for it. He just didn’t like how people acted when he said he saw a therapist. It was like suddenly he was contagious.
*          *          *
“What is he doing here?” Fleur asked.
“You know him?” Patty asked, and Harry turned away from the scene to look back to the woman next to him.
Draco let out a breath, feeling his eyes burn again as he reached out for Viktor’s hand, “I would prefer you with me.”
Draco sort of leaned back, wondering if he was going to panic. But he didn’t feel like panicking at all—he felt like doing that again. So he did. It was small licks, not really taking Potter completely into his mouth. Potter was making these little gasping sounds, hissing and his breath was shallow. Draco wanted more of that. He took Potter into his mouth and the gasp he got was
“Mr. Potter! I hadn’t seen you in too long.” A dark haired elderly man with a heavy Italian accent greeted him.
“Nice place.” Sammy said, looking around.
“But he did. He thought it was worth the money. Plus, he got to hand it down. Good quality is something to be valued. I’m not saying people don’t over price things because they are highly valued—because they do. But I think some things are worth it, and some things aren’t. Those Dragon Hide boots you wear—I would find them impractical as I would never wear them. Clearly, you do.”
“We also saw Draco’s levels were a bit elevated as well.” Blaise added, “Probably since an omega in distress usually elevates the alpha’s levels as well.”
“And this is what you choose?” His mother wrinkled her nose, “It is a hovel, Draco. You have a
“Draco, language.” His mother chastised.
.” Draco said incredulously.
physique. Draco loved the chiseled abs and the muscular cut of his torso. Draco stopped at Harry’s boxers, kissing right along the edge. It was impossible not to notice Harry’s hard on, but he didn’t touch it.
“No on the sex dungeon?” She batted her eyelashes and made Harry laugh.
“I’ve seen you at ministry function in your ‘I saved the wizarding world’ robes.” Malfoy argued.
“It would get me away from you.”
name and slammed it into the table. Winky appeared again, looking like she had cried the entire time she had been gone. She had a tea tray and another tray full of snacks.
Harry pressed his lips to Draco’s shoulder, not loosening his grip even a little bit.
“Draco!” Harry’s green eyes were wide with worry, ushering him into the apartment, “We’ve been looking for you for hours.”
“Uh—it’s one I learned from the book
“No—right after the war I had trouble sleeping and used it. I didn’t think I was addicted, but Ginny took it away from me. The withdrawal was a nightmare, but apparently I wasn’t ‘that bad’—whatever that means. It fucking sucked. I haven’t touched it since.”
in sawdust!” Draco waved his wand, cleaning it all up.
“Yes. It’s generally what people do when they see each other.”
“No. I fell in love with Ginny, so it seemed as if I would only add drama if I announced it. And people—I don’t know—people get weird views on bisexuality. Like that I just want to fuck everyone with legs, or I somehow chose to fall in love with Ginny before a man. Or even worse that I
“When does the thirty minutes start?”
“Set the table.”
He let out a slow breath, “Please don’t go around telling people that, it’s my choice to tell someone.”
This chapter is heavy. Please use your discretion as to whether you can read it or not.
“Then Lee Jordan told me I was sexy and he was glad I wasn’t limiting my options to one gender.” Harry said.
“Should we look for former Death Eaters being targeted?” One of the aurors asked.
“Yeah—I’m not really good at hiding things from them—I hope that’s ok.”
“Harry?” He called out. The house was dark, which was odd, especially if Potter was left to his own devices. He had every light on like he was occupying every room at once.
“What if it all goes away?”
“We still have dessert too.” Draco said—he was particularly proud of his dessert and a bit put out his parents didn’t get to see it. But he pushed back the feeling since it was a bit ridiculous. He managed to wiggle his hands out from underneath his blanket, cutting into his steak.
It will come out later that their instincts are making them be nice to each other and are drawing them together. I did try to hint at that in the chapter.
“No.” Potter muttered.
Draco scowled, “You take that back unless you want me to go and have whatever weird kinky sex we’re having with Blaise.”
“Doesn’t matter. It’s the same treatment.” Draco said with a slight grimace as he tried to move again. He turned to look at Pansy. There were four aurors surrounding her, Pope being one of them. Pansy was acting like a wet cat, hissing and trying to bite everyone, “She told me my father is behind this.”
a woman, helped death eaters into Hogwarts, nearly killed Katy Bell
“She didn’t bring that up when we talked about it.” Potter admitted, “But she says she gets the right to say I told you so when you do something stupid.”
“Oh—want to come with me? I found a place to study that isn’t so crowded. I hate the library because people tend to stare at me and ask questions and I—” Potter was babbling a bit, and he turned bright red as he stopped.
Harry laughed, “You broke my nose, I think Pansy pulverized yours.”
“Come on. Let’s have some tea.” Potter whispered. Draco hadn’t realized he was crying until that moment. He wiped his face, standing up with Potter’s help. A drying charm ran over him right before a warming charm—and then one to brush his teeth. Potter had a small grin on his face at Draco’s look, “Couldn’t resist.” He dried himself off, then pulled Draco with him onto the couch. He tucked him tightly into a blanket.
“I am.”
“Bull shit.” Harry said.
. He wanted Draco to know that he was
He somehow managed to get all three of his children to King’s Cross and through the barrier. Having this many children was like herding cats, you just hoped you all end up in the right place.
“That wouldn’t be role playing—I’d be myself.” Bill said, laughing with George.
throwing away leftovers. He would only really do it with limp salad or over cooked food. Once everything had been cleaned, Draco grabbed the dessert, which was sitting under a charm. It had taken him a few years to find the perfect charm to keep them warm but not cook them.
“Want to fuck me?” Draco asked.
“Make them leave so you can laugh at me Potter?”
“Why do you get the bigger one?”
“You always had an over active imagination.”
“Pain meds?”
Draco glared at him, “No.”
“Go home!” Potter yelled at an ally.
“We need to fix your nose.” Hermione said.
“Oh, finally. My arse hurts.” Draco grinned so Potter knew he was teasing. He cleaned up the dishes with a wave of his wand. They walked not too far down the steps into the dungeons. The castle was pretty empty since all the students were leaving to go home for spring break.
“So you actually want to try to date me?”
“Follow me—you sure you are alright?”
“No.” Draco frowned, “Mum’s coming up to visit me though.”
Harry stiffened again, “Yeah—I mean—I know we sort of chose this, but it was all sort of forced—and I—I dunno, I want to get to know you.”
Draco barked a laugh and Harry leaned in and kissed him. Draco immediately tensed, “Should we be doing this?”
“It’s not our bedroom.” Harry smirked, unbuttoning Draco’s shirt. He leaned in and kissed the edge of his jaw, his short beard tickling him as he made his way down to Draco’s neck. He nipped at his jugular, and Draco arched his neck a bit to keep him there. His neck was sensitive, and the scratchiness of Harry’s beard always drove him a bit wild.
“Wait!” Harry said before he knew what he was saying, “Shit, sorry. I don’t know why I said that.”
“Harry, I didn’t mean it like that.” Hermione said softly.
He held out his arm, “Shall we?”
“I don’t think I can.” Harry said.
“I’m not saying I’m not—I’m just saying your both ridiculous. You acted like you were in Hogwarts all over again—and now you don’t have teenage angst to blame.”
“How did you two first get together?”
“You have the top grade in the class.” Granger told him.
“You know my werewolf research?” Draco said, interrupting Harry’s babbling.
“Yeah?” He was walking down the steps, freshly showered. Draco pointed to Bill and Fleur. Harry colored instantly.
“Draco has never had to confront that he is gay.” Luna said, and Harry winced, feeling like he had betrayed Draco, “I’ve known for years Harry.” She squeezed his hand, “Can you imagine how terrified he must have been to wake up with you in his bed and
“What kind of icing is this?”
He hadn’t really meant to do it; it was just a difficult habit to break. He would butter his toast and glance at Potter to see what he was doing, he would walk to class a few steps behind Potter, he would watch Potter in class to hopefully see him get injured. The reasons now made no sense as Draco wasn’t serving the Dark Lord anymore, but Draco did it anyway. Potter had gotten a bit taller, though he was still skinny. Draco noticed he hardly ever ate, and sometimes Granger would nudge him to eat more. He looked at ease when he talked to people, smiling. But Draco knew it was an act. As soon as Potter thought no one was looking, his face looked drawn and exhausted. There were bags under his eyes that didn’t seem to go away. He glamored them away most days, but Draco knew they were there.
“I’ll still stay on the lookout.”
“I don’t really notice it.” Harry said, hugging his son tightly. The green and white Slytherin scarf nearly made him scrunch up his nose.
. If people still say that. It contains spiral thinking, dissociation, and all the mother fucking brain fog you can possibly imagine.
“If you two are going to flirt all the time, I’m quitting.” Parkinson sat up on the bar stool next to Harry.
“Want to meet with Meredith? That’s what I do when I can’t screw my brain on right.” Harry stiffened, “I’m not saying—you don’t have to—it’s just a suggestion.”
“Draco.” A familiar voice cut through all the noise. Viktor was kneeling down in front of him. His chocolate brown eyes were full, staring up at him. His hands on both of Draco’s knees, and he felt warm again. He didn’t realize how cold he was—how hard he was shivering—until that very moment.
“This isn’t truth whiskey—is it?” Draco looked down.
“It wasn’t a full bodied Patronus—but enough to keep the dementors back until Kingsley’s got there.”
“Alpha.” Harry whimpered. Those fingers were back, rubbing his hole again. This time it felt a bit like the spot behind his ear did. He couldn’t help his sharp gasp and wanting to arch his neck, but he contained that feeling.
“Painless?” Draco whispered the question, looking down at his hands. The silence stretched between them for too long. Draco wondered if he should just leave her alone. If she left, none of it would feel real. His father wouldn’t even be dead, it would be like they weren’t talking as per usual. He could pretend it never happened.
“Never offered me an out. He just offered to do the task for me. He wanted to protect his duplicate nature from me, which is quite understandable seeing as I was just as likely to protect him as to march right up to the Dark Lord with the news so that my family could get out from under his thumb.” Draco let out a breath, “But Snape never offered me a way out. I was certain he was in it for the glory, not because he wanted me to get away from
“What do you say Stella?” Kali asked, still staring at Harry.
“I am sorry you have to deal with that.”
Draco couldn’t help but smile, “Thank you Professor.”
“Fuck you’re good at this.” Harry groaned.
“Potter.” Draco said through grit teeth.
When Draco woke up, he did sort of expect to find his bed empty. He wasn’t sure why he expected it. Maybe he thought Potter would come to his senses in the night. But Potter hadn’t. He was lying on his stomach, still naked, facing away from Draco. His arm was under his pillow, his other hand off the side of the bed. Draco sat up a bit, looking at the Phoenix on Potter’s back. It noticed Draco and preened a bit, showing off his feathers. Potter turned in his sleep, and Draco was quiet for a moment, but all Potter did was turn his head to face Draco—still asleep. Draco wanted to reach out and touch Potter, but he wasn’t sure if he should. Did Potter not freak out because he hadn’t had the chance? What if the only reason he slept with Draco was because he needed physical comfort after his nightmare?
“They bully you” Potter pushed, his eyes locked on the creature on his shoulder which pulled his robe in every possible direction, Draco chuckled “so what are you going to do? You! The all mighty Potter! I bet you're going to laugh!! finally!! Malfoy- the heartless bully gets a taste of his own medicine!” Potter's frown deepened from Draco's words, he visibly flinched “I can help you” he said.
Weight.
“Aren't you too quick to trust me for a Slytherin?”
“Dude- ew no. Drake? Drakkie? My buddy? My man?”
“Would you look at that…” Draco's voice was raspy, he stared at Potter's figure through heavy eyelids, red and throbbing from his  salty tears “Harry Potter, the savior of the wizarding world, keeping his all known hero persona and helping out a war criminal” a hum left his throat, it's just so ironic that the events of their sixth year are repeating themselves,Draco Malfoy falling apart for no other than Harry Potter himself to find him and to break him more, maybe Draco will earn an another scar from this encounter.
Sometimes all you need to keep you grounded, is a smile and a sturdy hand to hold.
“I.. I know all of this sounds like an excuse.. I mean..” Malfoy bit his lower lip, thinking over his next words “but this could explain what I did to Longbottom and Hermione...at least a little…”  and it did, even though his bullying could never be justified, Malfoy is trying, and for the first time Harry could see it. “I know I don't deserve any more of your help Potter, but thank you for coming for the room of requirement with me” and with that he stood up, brushing grass off himself, the pale moonlight made his skin glow with a tint of blue “I should go, it's way after curfew.” Malfoy said and turned on his heel, and as he did so all the Solus leaped out of Harry's lap in order to run after their master, slowing him down as their claws dug into his pants. “M-malfoy wait!” Harry collected himself quickly hopping on his feet running right after Malfoy almost stumbling into the dark water, after he caught himself he reached out a hand at Malfoy, looking at him with pleading eyes. The boy rose a pale eyebrow in his direction, his eyes glistening with question while the Solus climbed up his torso back to their usual place at his back.
While gazing at his pale nape, Harry's eye locked onto the thin line between his collar fabric and Malfoy's actual skin, Slytherin colors suited him, Harry thought, the cold green like a splash of paint on fresh snow, if Malfoy was an element, he'd probably be ice, cold and beautiful but fairly useless under the heat of sun.
“And you didn't?!”
AYYYY IT'S YA BOI
“But a chance.. I can give.” Neville said at last, and somehow, a smile curled on Draco's face as he returned his gaze to the room, the Solus in front of him still sitting there, looking, and then bowing it's head as if thanking him, it's cracks expanding blooming with a soft orange color, rising up to the ceiling like fog before gathering up into a ball and flying through his chest.
Last Words of a Shooting Star- Mitski
Fang's loud barks marked their arrival, startling it's giant owner, the door opened in seconds with a creek and followed by excited cries  “Harry! Ron! Hermione!”  Squeaked the half giant, pulling the three teenagers into a tight hug  “I missed you guys!” Hagrid smiled, a heartfelt smile shining on his face “come on come in! I've made some tea” he waved and walked back inside, flopping into his big chair and began pouring hot tea into tiny semi clean cups, the golden trio sat down on their usual cushion, as they grew up, even a house of a half giant seemed to shrink, making the place they tend to have tea parties appear much smaller than it's actually is, but the truth is, that the house is all the same, but the people walking in and out of it had changed, the once eleven years old children were eighteen now,all grown and ready to face the new world, while the kind giant stayed there and never left, always creating those children a place to return to, no matter where they went, his big bush of hair had started planting white in it, and his skin slightly marked all the smiles that man had ever given anyone, marking all the frowns between his eyebrows to remind him that ever after all this pain and worry, he can still be kind, his big hands tough yet caring, and his raven eyes filled with love for anyone who'd take it, a marvelous man, Hagrid is.
“A spirit told me” somehow, Harry wasn't surprised from her answer at all, it was very Luna-like.
Potter just chuckled behind him, shifting with his own blanked before he said;
Something was wrong, Harry was sure of it.
“Dear students, may I have your attention please?” the chattering hall went silent, all four colors looking at her, she sighed but her thin lips curled into a soft smile “welcome back, to an another year at Hogwarts” the crowd cheered, Harry shot a look at his friends who were smiling widely, their hands curled together, probably thinking Harry won't notice, his eyes then trailed off to the teachers table, Hagrid was waving at him just like he always did, he waved back, with professor Flitwick jumping besides him, a glass of wine in his hand, the little teacher was cheering for everyone who made it and stood here now, they all deserved it, their return is indeed a worthy toast.
Squeezing his eyes tight shut he felt the mattress shift with Potter's added weight, who now probably laid besides him. Draco did his best to fall asleep, thinking about anything that could distract him from the git he's sharing his bed with. He counted sheeps, thought about his mother, about Quidditch, and how the weight on his back is way less suffocating than It had been before, two Solus gone into the unknown, both leaving with such pretty colors, only leaving Draco to wonder where they went. And a small part of him, slowly noticing that none of them never really
His eyes locked on a raven haired figure, Pansy Parkinson was standing next to Blaise Zabini, her eyes were wet and her arms were folded neatly over her chest, her hair barely reaching the end of her face with a firm undercut underneath it, from her exasperated frown you could understand that she was probably ranting about something, Harry could guess what.
He looked down at his slice of pie, and then looked up at her, remembering his previous conversation with Neville. “Hermione I'm sorry, I really am.” he blurted out, and she froze, staring at a slice of her own, a small but honest smile curling up on her lips, her brown eyes sad but knowing “I know.” She said, taking a fork and digging in into it, chewing as if trying to keep herself from speaking. Did it work? He really had meant it, even though he didn't say much, his gaze fell to the pie on the counter, noticing a Solus standing there all alone, it's while eyes reflecting his figure looking back at it, holding his plate, little cracks appearing on it's long form. This one didn't have ears, more like a sharp pair of horns and a short tail, though it didn't happen yet, it clearly was about to bloom, with orange light clearly seeping in through it's black fur. It then turned, jumping off the counter and walked casually towards the exit, then stopped and turned to look at him, waiting.
It looked like someone casted a spell on him at first, since the floor had absolutely nothing to trip on, but a glimpse of black mass caught Harry's attention, that thing was tugging Malfoy’s leg and Parkinson didn't seem to notice it, Harry blinked a couple of times and frowned, the creature was gone, weird, with laugh echoing through the hall Draco stumbled to get up,shooting everyone an angry yet defeated glare, pulling his robe up and leaving the hall running.
But I had been paid a visit by Karkaroff.
“I can't believe you've done this!” Draco exclaimed as they walked through the fields on their way back to the castle, both of them soaking wet. “You got what you deserve.” Potter mused, his horrible mop of a hair still dripping so hard you could wash a whole corridor with it. “I offered you a hand!! To help you get up!! Ugh!!” He kicked the grass like a child, hating each time even the slightest breeze made him shiver, being cold is horrible, being wet is worse. He wrapped his hands over himself, holding his hands under his armpits “that's so fucking childish of you.” He muttered through gritted teeth, Potter groaned “you started it!”
also H E C K this one turned out longer than I anticipated it's around 7K WHAT
“I just want.. for you to give me a chance.” Draco said, turning to finally look a Neville who had quit crying, but did have a mouthful of pie he was munching on, he seemed to be in deep through, his eyes still red and puffy from the previous crying. He started at the pie, and somehow staring at it made his eyes tear up again, perhaps it really is that sweet and horrible, Draco hadn't tried, he doesn't even like apple pie, but Hermione was right, feeding someone a thing you made sure feels nice, even when it's Neville Longbottom “I can't forgive you.” He said, his words followed by a painful silence, making Draco release a heavy sigh from his chest, of course he can't.
After Harry's speech, Malfoy was no longer interesting and the colorful crowd seemed to mix up, the room suddenly filled itself with chatter
They killed him
Maybe his stress was acting up, making him
Happiness flooded his lungs like fresh air he didn't know he was missing, it's so good to be back, so good to be home.
“Don't say that! You're a war hero, anything you say might have a huge impact on people!”  It always surprised Harry how Hermione managed to be so kind even towards the worst people, he saw Ron roll his eyes and chuckled “tell him Harry!” Hermione slapped Harry's shoulder,he shut his mouth and held it in a thin line, he had to bite the inside of his cheeks in order to keep himself from laughing.
“I would like for us all to have a minute of silence for all those who left us, so we could start a loud and eventful school year” the tip of her wand lit up, Harry did the same, pulling out his wand and murmuring lomus, and the great hall filled up with light, everyone held out their wands out high, silent for all those who can no longer speak
Drip, drip, drop, that's all Draco could hear, small drops of water falling into the sink, sliding down into oblivion. What time is it? He didn't know, his throat was dry from crying, and his head was resting on the cool wall while his legs spread open on the marble floor, eyes locked on a certain spot on the wall with heavy creatures snuggling up to his thigh, he let his head drop heavily to look at them, after his meltdown there seemed to be more of them now, each shaped so differently yet all gathered up together to mess up with his life.
Pairing: Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy
"You deserve it, sweetheart," Teddy said. "
There's no way to explain the sparks of pleasure that explode and catch fire inside Hermione when Pansy finally gives in and sucks on her nipples. Giving each one tantalizing attention before moving on to the other. Consistently keeping her entertained and aroused by reaching a hand up to twist and squeeze the nipple not being touched by her tongue.
Potter should just leave. Despite trying not to pity himself too often (he was very lucky for his situation, and he understood that), it was difficult to believe he was worth coming back to Hogwarts.
I might do that someday...
Warnings: teratophilic fantasies? Discussion of wet dreams from underage characters, but they're adults in the actual fic
"Ha ha."
Thus far, Pansy has not failed her yet. Her humor is very targeted and tends to veer on rude, but it doesn't help that she has a rather blunt way of talking in combination with a flat affect. Occasionally she can be quite defensive when Hermione tells her that a joke has gone too far. Most times that happens she will always come back a while later and explain herself and apologize.
"Fuck, not you again."
during their trysts. Hermione believes it's because she's always so cold that she likes to leech from Hermione's warmth whenever she can. Pansy always smiles when she tells her this, stating that she can neither confirm nor deny those accusations.
Unexpectedly, Potter smiled at him. Not fully, but it was definitely a smile. He outstretched his hand and kept it between them, unwavering. Potter never wavered; he was always annoyingly sure of every movement he made.
Seamus placed three drops of Veritaserum in the large bottle of wine, placing his thumb over the top as he swirled it around to disperse the potion. That was a lot of truth serum, but they would all be drinking small amounts so it shouldn't be too bad. Right?
. But that isn't who he's going to get 20 quid for if he asks for their number. He steels himself and sits down next to the couple.
"Yes?" Harry answered quietly, brows furrowed as if he were trying to come up with an answer. It took a few minutes for him to realize he spoke aloud.
"Very bohemian," Draco muses.
Hours pass before Draco's heat is satiated. He knows this will last for at least three more days (likely five, knowing Draco and his rotten luck) but he finally feels restful. Being surrounded by Harry's scent is definitely helping him as well. Would they be expected to go to class tomorrow? Draco hit his heat early in the morning, before classes, so somebody must have told their teachers.
Harry groans and wiggles around in the rope. "The bastard stole our wands, took my glasses, and tied us up together. If I move any more than this, we'll both fall over and probably concuss ourselves."
"Harry, my queerness has been a point of tension in my family since I was ten years old. Though I must be far from the first gay Malfoy, it doesn't mean I can shirk my duties to produce an heir. That's all there is to say about it. Now, what other questions do you have?"
, he thinks. His body is already feeling warm at the prospect of getting out of this damned cold. He pulls his suitcase after him with numb fingers to meet the car halfway.
"No. You're a
Enjoy reading! Comments are appreciated :)
"What is your favorite color?" Seamus asked.
A dream of both of was to have their own child. A baby coming from their own sweat and blood and tears. More than once, Harry and Draco have stayed up for hours fantasizing about which one of them would be pregnant in a perfect world, who would be the most annoying pregnant person (Draco begrudgingly agreed it would likely be him), what their child would look like— Draco wouldn't care what they looked like, as long as they had Harry's distinctive green eyes.
"I appreciate everything you do for me," he confessed. "You never had to help me, I know that. You could've turned me away when I first came here, begging for help and grovelling at your feet. But you didn't. And I don't know how to repay that."
Harry pushes down the duvet revealing his own pajama pants tented up. Ron's poor prick throbs again in want.
"So good. You're so good for me, Harry. Could stay inside this tight hole all day. Wanna make you come over and over again."
"You're a lot more amicable than I was expecting..."
He smiles. "Sounds great."
He can't help but wonder what the solid soles of his boot would feel against his aching cock. Merlin, there was something wrong with him, wasn't there? Normal nineteen year olds didn't travel a million miles away from home to research different species of dragon heartstring on wands. Normal nineteen year olds didn't lust after the second-eldest sibling of a family he was raised to hate. Normal nineteen year olds especially didn't have depraved fantasies about said second-eldest sibling spitting on his boot and making Draco lick it off.
One of those people she knows is her son. A handsome young man now, not the chubby little toddler with a tendency to secretly lick her arm. (It wasn't the licking he liked, it was the tired, disgusted expression on her face from having baby saliva on her skin that made him laugh.) Draco uses his office a lot now. He works independently as a potioneer. Narcissa always hated his boss, his arrogance was staggering and she was shocked Draco put up with it for as long as he did.
"I think we're getting this whole 'dueling' business wrong," Dean admitted as Seamus hummed a ballroom song for them to sway to.
"Clean it up," he commanded. Draco did just as he said.
“We need to talk about being Seekers,” he said bluntly. At least this time Draco knew he wouldn’t try to surprise him with any strange Muggle references. He was still holding his Quidditch robes against his chest, subconsciously covering it. When he noticed this, he flushed and dropped his arms. No reason why he should be covering that. Not anymore, at least.
Draco's back is warm against Harry's. He is still groggy, coming off the sleep potion. Harry fucking hates sleeping potions. It always makes him feel like there's sand in his head instead of his brain.
"Get these off," he whines, pulling Harry back to the bed.
. “Alright, ‘Mione. I’ll see you at breakfast.”
"About that too: I'm thinking that if you help me out on this research paper, my work and your interview will keep 'my kind' out of your family's hair for another three centuries, at least."
“I know what you’re going to say—”
"Wow," Harry said in awe. "Did you go shopping recently? I'm fairly certain that wasn't in your closet last time I was over."
Bronze skin. Unkempt, raven-black hair that fell just an inch or two past his shoulders. His beard filled out with a thick scruff rather than the close shave he used to have. For a moment, he convinced himself the person in front of him was just a convincing doppelganger. Those existed, right? Sure it was rather rare, but it wasn't completely unlikely.
"Please," Harry begged, turning into a moan as her hand traveled under his boxers. Her hands were cold against his hot sex.
"How would you beat me?" Dean asked with a raised eyebrow.
Draco still didn't know his name as the man turned back around and led him to the elevator. Hopefully the receptionist wasn't looking for him. Or that he had already told Harry. He wanted this to hit Potter hard. But maybe that was his theatrics talking.
He lies next to Harry. He feels better already. Sleeping in his own bed is grand and all, but Harry must've charmed his bed during their years to be so comfortable. Ron feels himself falling into the mattress, feels like he's being held by a cloud.
"Alright, alright, I'm getting there, Malfoy." Malfoy? The man's skin was beginning to bubble up. Bile rose in Draco's throat.
The fireplace crackled and popped to his left. It provided a pleasant warmth that erased the wet chill in his bones from practicing and he felt himself unwinding bit by bit with every minute in the presence of the fire.  The bright flames licked the sides of the brick fireplace, dancing as erratically as the Weird Sisters. (Ginny tried getting him into their music, to no avail. He just didn’t understand wizarding music. “How is anyone supposed to dance to this?”)
Draco coughed and stared down at his work. Harry rolled his eyes and countered, “We’re already together, Ron. I appreciate what you’re trying to do though.”
"Because Harry needs to be cheered up," Neville responds. He isn't drinking much either, just enough for his cheeks to become pleasantly red. "And we're all here to support him in this time of need."
Pairing: Harry Potter/Draco Malfoy
His cunt squeezed around her and her hips stuttered. Which was such a compliment, that he was able to do that to her. She fell gently on him. Rested her head on his shoulder. Her hand nestled at the base of his neck, twirling his curly hair in between her fingers. Harry massaged her back as well as he could from his position.
Draco slumped forward, even closer to her, and began to weep.
Her praises were just another layer on top of it all. Harry twisted his hands in his unruly hair. He needed something to hold during all of this. With her other hand, Blaise reached up to fondle his chest and squeeze his nipple.
I realize now that for so many of these prompts the ships are so sappy with each other lol.
"Well, Blaise wasn't wrong. To ask the question, I mean. If what you're saying is true, then I was absolutely obsessed with you in sixth year." And then, without his explicit permission, his mouth added, "I still am. Hopefully as much as you're still obsessed with me, of course."
The walk back to the dorm room was… quiet, to say the least. Harry was walking next to Ron. He couldn’t keep his eyes off of the white-blond hair, so white that it practically glowed in the blackness of the night. After everyone was assigned a position Madame Hooch made them run through countless drills in an attempt to whip them back into shape after such a long break. It was a comfort to know she’d be treating the other house teams the same way, though.
Hank loved it. Draco loved talking to him. He had so many interesting stories about his job. He was so curious about Draco's life. For a moment, Draco wondered if this guy had amnesia and just forgot who Draco Malfoy was. For a moment, he wondered if this man could finally be the one to help him get over the one who's had his heart for ten years.
Potter was standing there, his Quidditch robes fitted across his chest a bit tighter than in previous years. Ironic, because the chest of Draco’s robes were actually a bit looser than they had been. Beside him was his redheaded sidekick, who was glaring at him almost like he was a gnome digging up his mother’s precious peonies. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had seen Weasley stare at him in such a manner. His memory of his family’s trials was blurry at best, his mind so fully overstimulated and in desperate need to process everything that has happened in the past few years.
The door locks behind him before he can think to take out his keys. Did he do that with wandless magic? Or did Hank do it?
"This weather is miserable," he complains to the driver, pulling on his seat belt and clicking it into place.
Of course it was fucking Polyjuice Potion. He could recognize the signs of a person coming off the substance with his eyes closed. Better just to wait it out and face the music than to ignore what was happening and deny it.
Ron inhales deeply, then exhales. Things went better when he just did things instead of dwelling on them. He gently pushes Harry to the left and lies down next to him.
Harry flushed, his face feeling like a furnace. “Does that mean you have nothing on right now?”
Have I mentioned that I love Ginny/Luna? Because I do. I want to write more kabedon but I find it so difficult! That just means I get to practice them more I guess.
Pairing: Zygmunt Budge/Tertius
"Malfoy?"
Well, I was thinking more dub-con but the scene got away from me and ended up traumatizing Draco even more than dubiously. This is one of the darker fics so far. I have written non-con and dub-con scenes before, but this is my first published one. In other fics I've alluded to it or referenced it in detail, but I haven't actually published a whole scene of it before.
“Maybe, in another time, I wouldn’t. But I care about what my mother thinks, and she’s the one I’d hurt the most by being so careless as to get in trouble with Aurors.”
“Don’t you think I should make that decision for myself? Whether or not I should be doing something? I am an adult, you know.”
Too late, Ron realizes the parseltongue has stopped. Fear gripping his lungs, he opens up his eyes and stares straight into the flushed expression of his best friend. Ron's hand stills on his dick; it throbs angrily at not being able to reach completion.
"No. Of course not. I'm sorry if I came on too harsh. I think you're a very admirable person for staying in control as long as you did."
for daring to question my authority."
So he cherished the moment. Sighed happily when the other teens finally came, coating his front with semen and leaving his insides warm and wet. Sirius didn't let go when Remus lay beside them, one arm over Sirius' back and rubbing soothing circles in his shoulders. He wanted this to last forever.
His face is flushed but maybe Charlie will think it's just the heat of the room. Or even the cold from outside.
. Can one let something like seven years of antagonism go that easily? He knows it’s what McGonagall is expecting of him; that’s why she roomed them together to begin with. There could be no other reason. A weak, childish part of him wished nothing would change. That Malfoy would wake up one day and hex the shit out of him and he’d hex him back, just like old times.
"Lucky us," Draco purrs and meets Harry in a deeper, longer kiss. Harry picks him up and sets him on his desk, nearly knocking over the potion he had been just about to send out. Narcissa pities whoever that potion is going to.
The first rare pair! Between two wizards from the 1500s who only show up in a 2013 Playstation video game. I hope you enjoy reading, I had a lot of fun writing this prompt
“So, you want me to call you ‘she’, or…”
"Fuck," Harry breathes. He reaches out with one of his hands. "Can I?"
Ron’s jaw dropped and his eyes widened to the size of saucers. “Malfoy’s gonna be here? Why’s he need to be here, shouldn’t he have hundreds of thousands of Galleons in his family’s vault?”
But the Malfoys were traditional purebloods, with no interest in Muggle history unless it intertwined with wizarding history. Harry had seen Malfoy working on Muggle Studies essays over the past few weeks, but he supposed he was still unused to Muggle historical figures like that.
"Hopefully something more than friends. Hopefully we'll give it enough time to grow and change and get stronger."
Pansy Parkinson is not the type of person you want to introduce to your parents unless it was a marriage deal. Hermione shudders at the thought of trying to find the commonalities between her Muggle dentist parents and a Slytherin rich witch of the Sacred Twenty-Eight.
I hope you enjoy! Comments and kudos are appreciated :)
"Truth serum is illegal, you know." Malfoy gaped at them. "You
"Can I clean you off?" He whispered through their post-sex panting. He waited patiently for her reply.
"Oh, you're a mess, darling," Draco coos, repositioning the infant into a cradle. The same arm position Hermione taught him when Rose was just a baby. "That's unbecoming of a Malfoy-Potter, you know."
They stop in front of a dark wooden cabin. It looks like something out of those slasher movies Harry's showed him. He doesn't want to move. Is this all some ploy to murder the Malfoy heir, when his parents were both ill at St. Mungo's? (Draco had been assured it was nothing more than a case of spattergroit, but his parents were dramatic and were convinced they were on death's door.)
Hermione pulls Pansy up by her robes, depleting the three inches of difference between their heights, and sighs softly when their lips finally meet. She's hoping to put as much longing as she felt into it. She's hoping Pansy understands.
"Oh, you liked it. And I'm just trying to lighten the mood. It really does put a damper on things in my life sometimes. Especially because my father has succumbed to some sort of obsession about the lineage."
"Sorry, mother!" Draco calls as Harry pulls him out of the office. They close the door behind them.
He leaves his socks and underwear all around his bed. And his bed is closest to their shared restroom, so Ron tends to trip on the way when he goes to piss in the middle of the night. He has crude humor, sometimes making blunt, dark jokes when Ron's least expecting it. The worst time this has happened was during lunch and Ron laughed so hard milk spewed out of his nose. But the biggest difference between the Harry Ron thought he was going to meet versus the one he actually ended up meeting was that Harry is so brave yet quiet. Quiet bravery is a good way to describe him.
, he thought. Nobody's called him that in years. Certainly not since he left Hogwarts.
“Don’t call me that Malfoy.”
Minutes or maybe hours later, the gravity of the situation, of what was happening, hit Draco. He pulled away, his lips feeling swollen. Kissing a boy was so much different than kissing a girl. More aggressive, confident. No questioning or insecurity about pleasing the girl. Potter opened his eyes and looked at him, really looked at him.
Harry—
Fuck, how is he supposed to look into Gellert's eyes tomorrow? Will he know what depraved things Albus did? He's incredibly perceptive when he wants to be.
Pansy had said gleefully the first time she marked Hermione with blood-red kisses. That sentiment alone was enough for Hermione to insist they wash off before seeing their friends again.
"You okay, love?" He asked quietly. "You didn't say the word, but that was still pretty intense."
, Draco thinks. In his misery and warmth, he doesn't notice the smirk gracing Charlie's face, who clearly notices his ogling. Maybe it's for the best that he doesn't notice.
This was one of the first fics I ever wrote for kinktober. I also remember staying up untill three a.m. writing because I managed to find an incredible rhythm and didn't want to lose the characters' voices. Hah, good times.
are experienced Occlumens."
Potter laughed (he dared to laugh!), throwing his head back and exposing his long, thick neck. Draco felt weird for noticing; as if he were Turned during the War and became even more obsessed with Harry Potter.
"Well, has he made it right?"
, as some sort of self flagellation."
"Harry! Where are you?" A loud voice upstairs asks.
on this. It takes a month to brew and fucking so long to find all the ingredients."
Harry spent a bit of time in the common room to catch up with Hermione. She’d stayed up to write an essay for her Arithmancy class. Ron jumped over the sofa to sit next to her, resting his head on her shoulder in the hopes of catching a few winks, but she protested too much at his sweaty and dirty skin. He laughed at the antics, trying very, very hard to ignore the blond head going up the stairs.
Granger finally got him alone in Arithmancy. It was a few classes later in the day. He was sort of dreading it. He wondered if she was going to punch him in the face. Granger hadn’t seemed upset, but that was libel to change the moment she got him alone.
“Please, come on in.” Draco said. Harry backed away so they could all walk past him as he shut the door behind them.
“I did not know that.” Harry said, backing up to look at him, “Any other languages?”
“I’m grateful.” Draco said, tilting his head to see Harry, “But I think I’m ready to get out.” The water had gotten a bit too cool. Harry nodded, kissing Draco’s shoulder right before they got out. Draco was glad they were at his apartment because he had the big fluffy towels that had been warmed up on the towel rack.
“Ok—that’s fine. I’ll just go then.” Harry said, finding his wand.
Malfoy from now on was almost too much to bear. His whole life was going to be this. What if he fell in love? How would that person ever put up with him?
Harry explained how the Elder wand was his, how that is how he won the dual with the Dark Lord. He said that he gave it up in favor of his old wand. Which was the most Potter thing Draco had ever heard.
“Well, Pansy is resilient.” Draco said tersely. Draco couldn’t help but think his father was implying that Pansy had turned out better than Draco, that she didn’t let the war bring her down. He thought his father was mentioning his letter by proxy—but he might have been reading too far into it.
Malfoy threw back some more whiskey, “No. It’d be very hypocritical of me.”
“You alright?”
Potter looked up in shock, “Someone could have needed my help.”
“Ready for a drink?” Harry asked.
It began a process of planning to see Viktor quite regularly. It was not odd for Draco to come home after a long day at the shop to see Harry and Viktor chatting over the dining room table. Draco tried to be friendly, but he was struggling to be as easy with Viktor as Harry. Harry had this effortless way of making friends. When all three of them were together, Draco noticed Harry brought Draco into the conversation, making sure he felt included. It wasn’t necessarily surprising that Harry was better friends with Viktor, but it was frustrating. Draco just didn’t know how to get out of his own skin. Harry encouraged him to have his own nights with Viktor when he was going out on auror raids, or on long nights.
“Hm.” Draco hummed, staring into the fire, “I think it’ll be good, I need the distraction—plus, you can always go without me Potter. I heard you do things by yourself sometimes.” Draco said with a smile, remembering what Potter had said in Hogsmeade.
, with just enough strength to feel it but not too much to hurt. Harry flipped open Draco’s belt with his right hand, his left rubbing along the outside. He wasn’t completely hard yet, but the strokes through his clothes held promise.
“But you still consult with the aurors regularly.”
“I’ll take the risk. Go home.”
“It’s
“N-no, it’s not because of that.” Potter shook his head, “Come on. I’ll show you.” Potter started walking, motioning for Draco to follow.
“Yeah.” Harry answered, his fingers running absent patterns along Draco’s back.
“I fucking love you too.” Draco managed to say between deep breaths. Harry laughed breathlessly, but held him tight.
“Harry?” Draco asked again, focusing his eyes on Hermione.
“Come on.” Potter said, slipping his hand down into Draco’s and pulling him along. It was a bit Gryffindor to hold hands, but Draco didn’t mind it. He liked that here they didn’t have to hide—they could do what came naturally.
They were sitting in a booth, watching the band with two lagers when Potter turned to him.
“When did they get here?”
“She isn’t here.” Harry defended himself, “Alright everyone—food is ready. We got flank steak, scalloped potatoes and a salad. Wine has been opened—and Draco likes this bottle for anyone feeling wary about my wine choices.” The floo went off, so everyone stopped to stare. George Weasley popped out, his face surprised.
“You should come to group.” Luna said.
“Memory.” Draco snapped, nearly smelling the whiskey again. He tightened the grip on his hair.
“I won’t be back.” His voice broke more than what he would have liked, but it couldn’t be helped. He looked down at the tablecloth and not at his own mother. He couldn’t bare it.
“You’re stuck with me Potter.” Draco gripped him tightly. Harry squeezed him back.
Draco’s eyes fluttered open.
“Ok.” Draco said, his voice choked on emotion. Harry entangled his fingers with Draco’s squeezing tight.
“We don’t have to do this.” Harry said softly, making Draco face him.
“Don’t use that
“I’m just glad those articles came out during the summer—it would have been so much worse if it came out during the school year.” Albus said.
“Not at work?”
“You really think so?” Lily perked up. Harry didn’t think this conversation was very good for interhouse community, but he was all for making Lily less nervous.
“Thank you for getting food.” Draco said with a small blush.
“Fine. Don’t be an adult about this. If you feel like being an arse, I’m leaving.” Harry turned to the door.
“I have to go into my father’s line of business.” Draco told him coldly, turning back to the lake, “I don’t—” Draco stopped and took a deep breath, “It’s what I have to do.”
“Fucking hell!” Draco gasped, “More pain potion!”
“Yes Father.” Lily said, rolling her eyes. All his kids called Draco father. Draco had been incredibly touched when Lily started calling him that after they got married, and then soon Albus and James joined in.
“The one where you have secret Veela heritage and I am caught in your influence.” Harry said.
“We’ve just gotten started.” Draco said into his ear. Draco felt Harry’s breathing quicken, “Let’s see if your good behavior lasts.” He bit his collarbone and then kissed the bite wound. Draco sat back up and pulled off his own pants, tossing them to the side.
“I’m close.” Harry whispered. But Draco knew he could get closer. He pumped him once, then twice, and then let go. Harry let out a harsh breath, it blew some of the hair out of Draco’s face. His chest heaved up and down a bit. Draco stared at Harry’s cock but nothing had happened. He waited a few seconds, then grasped Harry’s cock again. He worked him even closer, the slick sound of the lube making Draco’s body tingle.
“So the dad killed her, waited for everyone to go to sleep, then dumped her like yesterday’s trash.” Draco concluded.
Harry sucked hard, pulling off him with a slurping pop sound, “That’s the point.” He stroked him still, licking the precum that poured from his head before bobbing back down. From then on it was only a bit of coordination and heat that had Draco spilling into Harry’s mouth.
“Sounds like a plan.”
“I don’t want to hear about how.” Scorpius said flatly.
“No—I just thought you had.” The clench in Harry’s heart started to relax a bit. He’d woken up and Harry was gone, he assumed the worst not because he thought Harry would do it, but because he couldn’t hope otherwise, “I don’t really know how to move forward from here.”
Lindsey nodded, “I think he’s pretty great too.”
The door was closed, so he knocked on it. Isaac opened the door.
WARNINGS
“If I was going to live with one of the Golden Trio to salvage my reputation, Hermione would be my last choice. She would have figured that out before we had even moved in together.” Draco pointed out.
“Can we discus for a moment?” Hermione asked them both.
“Where will we run away to?” Draco asked.
, its ok.” Draco said, “I’m not going anywhere. I promise.” It was said fiercely, yet quietly enough that Harry believed him. He focused his eyes on Draco but let his hand go. Concentrating on breathing in Draco’s close scent, he let his eyes flutter shut as the extremely uncomfortable test began. It took too long in Harry’s opinion. Every swipe of Blaise’s wand was slow. A couple of passes made him wince in pain.
“When should we tell the kids?” Draco asked over coffee nearly a week later. His hair was all over the place, which was entirely Harry’s fault. But Harry was sure he looked just as debauched as Draco did. Harry had no idea what he was doing when he took Draco, but he had released some sort of sexual fiend. Draco was insatiable and incredibly creative. He wanted to try everything.
“Well cheers then, to a game well played.” Draco said. Bulgaria had lost, but Viktor had caught the snitch. It had been a goal at the last second that pushed Brazil over. Viktor hadn’t known until it was too late.
“He is really sensitive to smells.” Draco told Blaise, “Most omegas are—but he goes a bit beyond that. We were at George’s last night—and he was kinda zonked out on our scents.”
“I get them too.” Draco admitted.
“Y-y-you c-c-c-cl--cleaned my teeth?”
“Will do Potter.” He said with a grin as he got up. Ford opened the office door and Edwards was standing outside talking to Blake. His face was a bit red and Blake looked anxious.
“What? Yes, you did.”
The pain made his eyes close, he pinched them tight as his breath increased. His breathing was shallow as he felt the warmth of his own blood drip down his wrist.
“Albus has always been sensitive to your fame—perhaps your status as
“You cook?” Mrs. Weasley asked
“You have more than two friends.” Draco said, “Don’t be dramatic.”
“I live with a muggle born. I’m not the twat I was in Hogwarts—not that you knew me then either.”
“I won’t tell anyone.” Potter told him instantly.
“He is a great friend.” Harry replied.
“Fuck yes.” Draco nearly sobbed, clenching his hand tightly as Harry thrust again. His entire body was wound tightly so that every bit of pleasure felt a thousand fold. He didn’t want it to end. He wanted to stay this close to Harry forever. Sweat dripped down his side burn and onto Harry’s shoulder. Draco looked down at their bodies pressed tightly together. There was not an inch of space between them. He rocked a bit more so his cock would rub harder against Harry’s stomach. Draco tried to pull Harry closer, arching his back to try to get him deeper.
Potter gaining some weight and looking healthy was another win in Draco’s books. Draco didn’t really realize how gaunt Potter looked until he started eating the way he was supposed to eat. Their Quidditch practices also helped put muscle on both of them, and Draco was definitely reaping the rewards of both. He forgot how sore he could get after playing Quidditch for so long. There were no more shower encounters because everyone was back at school, but that was fine.
“Draco, I need to see you after a bit.” Winston said, exiting the room.
“You’re alright. Take a nap on my couch, ok? I have paperwork I have to get done anyway. You won’t disturb me.”
“Next to the Phoenix.” Harry answered. Draco looked at the designs again with a bit more discretion. He tossed out one immediately, then another. The final three were similar in design—similar to the Phoenix tattoo. Since they would be close, Draco figured it would be best if they were done in a similar style. Draco hovered for a few minutes, hearing Harry and Guinevere chatter on in the background. When he was sure of his decision, he grabbed a design.
“I think the evening Prophet will go out early.” Harry said with a grin. He bumped Draco’s arm, “How are you and Mione?”
pin Draco to the floor quickly. Draco retaliated by trying to buck him off. There were a few more elbows thrown in, shoves back and forth and a few grunts of pain. Again Potter managed to pin him down but Draco nailed a solid hit to his ribs.
“Stay there.” Harry said, swinging out of bed to
“Ah yes, the old Black residence. It as dreary as I remember?” His mother asked. Draco knew she meant to be rude, but Harry laughed it off as he put down four salad plates and sat down across from Draco.
“Sit.” Rosmerta ordered. Draco sat down gingerly on a leather chair. He heard a clink of glasses. She plopped down two small low-ball glasses and filled them both generously with whiskey, then slid him a cup. He took it. When she took a sip, he pressed the glass to his lips and took his own small sip. It burned on the way down and tasted disgusting. He wrinkled his nose, setting the glass down.
“In Isaac’s living quarters, there is a bunch of cardboard boxes on his counter top by the refrigerator. I need you to bring us one with the brownies inside—ok?”
“How are you Draco?” Ginny asked stiffly. Draco noticed she had been sent by Mrs. Weasley to assumedly scout out the situation and probably report back.
“Oh so now it’s
Harry gave a wet laugh, turning to the side a bit, “I think my situation was a bit above and beyond.”
“Ah, shit. I’m running late.” Harry said, scrambling to his feet.
It was difficult to process that Lucius was dead. He still had nightmares where he heard the crack of his neck, but Harry was always there to help. Unless he was gone on an auror mission, in which case Blaise was there to help. Blaise hadn’t moved home yet. Draco said he could, but Blaise said he liked living at Grimmauld Place better because he missed being around people. There were some nights Blaise went home, but he slept at Grimmauld more than he didn’t. Draco asked Harry if he minded but Harry only shrugged and said that it didn’t matter to him.
“You gunna let this one stick around?” The Weasel asked.
“Please what?”
“Ok—come around for tea on Thursday.”
“He wouldn’t.” Harry said, “Narcissa asked me to come over, so I did. We talked, he confessed—things.” Harry wouldn’t betray his confidence even though he was sure Luna already knew, “Things he never confessed to anyone. We fell asleep—and when I woke up he was furious with me for staying.” Harry sat down on the couch, his eyes burning, “He—I told him things in confidence that he blew up in my face. Then I—I did the same thing because he made me so
“And now we have taken that away from him.” Draco concluded, and Harry nodded, “I didn’t think about that.”
“I tried to redecorate my room—right—right before I left.” Draco swallowed, trying to move closer to Harry even though they were already pressed together, “My mother accused me of rebelling. I just—I didn’t want it to look the same—I wasn’t the same.”
“He graduated top of his class as a Healer and took a specialty in ABO dynamics. They say he is a prodigy to the field and completely reinventing it.” Hermione said.
Draco frowned and froze in place at Isaac’s words, “I didn’t think of that.”
“He has been very fragile since his loss, you have brought him back to himself. I am very grateful.”
“Go close up and make yourself useful.” Draco said with a growl. He let out a sigh, turning back to the espresso machine. Harry hopped off the bar stool too as Pansy gleefully walked away. Harry walked around the counter. Draco was a bit too vigorously cleaning the coffee stains away.
“I’ll have you know I have never slept with a St. Mungo’s nurse.” He said with a frown.
“Always second fiddle.” Draco said with a nod.
“Done.” They shook hands.
Guess his mother didn’t know everything. He couldn’t quite believe his father was willing to kiss another man to ruin him. “Pansy put the wand away. You—you have your whole life.”
“Ok.” Harry let out a breath, “I like seeing him here with you when I’m gone for a while. Makes me feel better for not leaving you alone for so long.”
The coffee bar had a large marble counter top extending past the cash register for people to sit up and work on, as well as a smattering of tables, chairs and lazy boys in front of it. He sat up on the bar stool as Draco helped another customer. The crowd had slowed down.
“I love all of those things.” Harry said a bit breathlessly as Draco pumped his cock.
Harry laughed, “Gryffindor. When Albus plays for the team I will reconsider my positioning.”
“Yes.” Draco answered.
In terms of funerals it was remarkably dull. The priest spoke about Lucius’s many accomplishments in life, but it sounded like the man had never met his father. He certainly wouldn’t be saying those things otherwise. One of father’s business partners gave the eulogy. It was once again about accomplishments and power. Nothing was real. His father’s casket looked like a shrine in the front. It was a closed casket, considering the circumstances.
“Just a minute.” Harry turned around so he wouldn’t have to look at his facial expressions, laying back on Draco’s shoulder.
“No.”
. He climbed up between Harry’s legs, the tension building in Harry as he did it, “You—you’ve slept with a man before, right?” Draco asked. His eyes went straight to Harry’s. They saw
“Was what you said last night true?”
“It’s like you have no imagination.” Harry said, his tone heavy with amusement as he kissed down Draco’s back. Draco felt the soap bar between his legs, thick fingers moving sensually up his thighs. The bar slipped between his cheeks and up his cock before back down again, “Put your legs together.”
“Well, that makes me want to vomit.” Viktor said with a grimace.
Draco grinned, “I’d like that.”
“But he’s—he’s manipulating you!” Ron yelled.
“Draco?” Potter’s voice broke him from his revelry. He was sitting on his bed, trying to edit his Transfiguration essay but he had been lost in thought. Potter pulled the invisibility cloak off his shoulders.
“Disloyal?” Something in Draco snapped. The patience he had was gone. Draco interrupted his father, who colored at such an insult but Draco didn’t give a shit. All the anger building up suddenly bubbled to the surface like someone threw a mento in a coke bottle. It was like a surge of lava was going to spew from him. Something shattered from the accidental magic that cracked through him, but he didn’t care what it was, “
“Patty, yes.” She grinned, looking more at ease now that Harry recognized her.
“Mione made me take lessons.” Potter admitted, his cheeks getting pink.
Draco opened his mouth and then scrunched his nose, “I hate not being able to use sarcasm.”
“Albus has quite the aptitude towards potions.”
“Don’t tell that to my children—or my husband.” She said with a grin, and Harry smiled back.
how out of control his cutting had gotten. No one else changes their outfits based on wounds, “I—I know it’s not a good thing, but it’s—it makes me feel like I can calm down.”
“The potions riddle—Snape’s idea. Hermione got us through that one.”
Seamus rigged up a set of speakers to run on magic. Draco sort of thought the older people would clear out when that started, but to his shock they all stayed—even when George started drinking games. Molly and Sherry were excellent at Quidditch pong partners. Arthur and Jonathan tried to hold their own against them, but lost miserably. They even beat George and Seamus, which might have been because Seamus was too drunk to be much help anyway.
And then it went downhill pretty quickly for Harry. He got a little bit more than drunk and had a really good time until everyone started going home. But as soon as the last person stepped into the floo and left, Harry felt like he had been punched in the gut. His house seemed so empty without anyone there. It nearly crushed him to the bone.
“I try not to make him angry.” She admitted with a grin, “but I find he usually shuts up if there is tea involved. But this was the first time he was angry with me, and not some other injustice.”
“He’ll come around. I think he is—Scorpius is
“No.” Draco huffed, moving to the coffee pot, “I tried talking to Harry—his nightmares have been awful.”
. Usually when Draco was mad at him when he
“I’ve had girls around, but I don’t keep them around for long.” Draco admitted. He was starting to feel all the gross liquids dry against him, “Mind casting a cleaning charm?”
“Potter, let me pay you back.”
“Ron is walking around nude to prove that he can—so if it is alright with you I’d much rather stay here.” Hermione replied, and Harry chuckled.
“Draco?” Harry whispered his name.
“Fuck. That.” Draco said decidedly, “I’m making dinner—you want anything?”
“You smell brilliant.” Harry said, and Draco flushed.
“Potter is my patient. Getting in an argument would be counter productive to his recovery.” Draco said airily and Hermione snorted.
to have access to your vaults again.”
Draco took a quick shower, and had just enough time to work himself into a bit of a tizzy. He took out his pens and drew a few miscellaneous things on his arm before pulling on his cloak and walking down to meet Lindsey.
Blaise smiled at Draco, “I can think of a few.”
“No—probably tomorrow though. It will depend on how your wounds heal today.”
“Of course, I need to be in the store for a bit, but then we can go elsewhere.”
“I think it is best for you two to leave.” Harry said, standing up.
“It was her favorite.” Lily said. It still hurt to hear the past tense when talking about Ginny, “How old was I?”
“So you weren’t Harry’s first therapist?”
This is where Harry felt a bit nervous, but he decided to go all in with Malfoy. He really had only ever told one other person this in his entire life, “
“You’re welcome Mr. Malfoy.” Flitwick waved his wand and the clock disappeared, “How about this? I’ll tell the mind healer that you’re going to swing by this afternoon, just to get some tips to help your panic attacks.”
Harry pulled back, “You sure? I do have some experience in the area.” That was overstating it a bit. The last time Harry had been fucked by a man was nearly two decades ago, but he did have a dildo that he loved using when he had the time and patience for it.
“What happened?” She asked.
Draco had finished shoving things in his bag. It was better not to fight Madam Pince on this—well, and pretty much everything. He wished Potter would just shut up so he could get away, “It’s fine. I was just leaving anyway—may I check out this book?” Draco pointed to the book he was using for his charms homework.
“No, the sentimentality in the room is starting to wrinkle my robes.” She said, glaring at Theo, Greg and Blaise, “I thought it was only Draco who was lost to this Gryffindor nonsense.”
“Through there.” Harry pointed to a doorway and Draco jumped up and slipped out the door.
“Draco’s flank steak is delicious.” Greg declared, taking his plate over to the table. Hermione worked a bit of transfiguration so the table was big enough and Blaise conjured chairs.
“My business is regularly looked at by aurors. I run a clean business—ask your wife.”
.” Potter hummed his agreement. It was a bit weird to talk to him about it, but it was comforting. It felt a bit like walking onto thin ice—but the ice didn’t want to break either. Potter understood in a way Isaac never had. They walked in silence up to the point where Potter went up the steps and Draco went down toward the dungeons.
“What?” Harry stopped. Draco couldn’t help but lean across the table and kiss him. He wanted his hands on Harry to make sure he was real. He slid out of the booth and dropped back down next to Harry, squeezing his hand.
“I’ve been shopping here for years!” The strong and gentle voice could be no other’s.
“I am aware you two are lovers.” His mum said.
“No shit Hermione.” Draco snapped as he poured water into the coffee pot. He looked out of the corner of his eye and watched Hermione deflate, “Fuck. Sorry. I’ve been up since three.” He said with half a smile, pressing the power button on the coffee pot.
“Why does everyone stare at you
“Me too.” Draco said a little hopelessly.
“Blocking you
Draco nodded, “Sometime before midnight if everything goes well—he is taking an international portkey from Japan.”
“Stop staring.” Draco said, washing off the shampoo.
“So you could go to.” Draco finished.
His shift was only three more hours, but every moment was agony. He was barely aware of his own hand in front of his face. He wasn’t sure why the world hadn’t stopped spinning.
“The pheasant is particularly good today.” Antonio whispered conspiratorially before walking away. Draco looked down at the menu to see roasted pheasant with potatoes and greens. He hadn’t had good pheasant in forever.
Draco walked his mother into his room and for an awful second was worried he left sex toys out. He never did, so it was a ridiculous worry. But for a moment he panicked—but his room was clean. Harry’s bag was on the settee—a ridiculous gym bag.
“This isn’t even the most ridiculous article I’ve read about us.” Harry shook his head. Harry had a weird fascination about reading all the articles about them. Draco would just read the more ridiculous ones for the laughs.
“Looks like no one has been here for awhile.” Draco said.
“You’ll have to stop getting injured as much, don’t want to ruin them.” Sherry said, making everyone in the room laugh.
There was a little spark in him that fluttered as he tried to go to sleep. He couldn’t believe
“Are you just going to stare?”
“Did you suspect the father of being abusive then?”
Sherry laughed at him when she saw him, so he knew he still looked ridiculous after being in a fight. He scared away no more than three nurses who tried to work with him. When he finally trudged himself over to the café for a quick bite and some caffeine, his mood had worsened. He plopped down in the booth across from Hermione.
“Yes, that’s true. Lily may go Slytherin, but I’m betting Gryffindor.”
“Harry you’re—oh, hello Draco.” Winston said as he walked in, “You should be in your own room.”
Mrs. Malfoy nodded, “Did you go through chemotherapy or did you do wizard treatment?”
consensually legal in terms of age. Theo had just hit the age of consent for a few days before Rodolphus was knocking on his door. Theo had admitted he liked the attention, the instruction. It turned abusive quickly. Draco was thrown in there somewhere as an escape for Theo while he was at school. Draco didn’t have a clue Theo had been sleeping with Rodolphus at the same time until much later. It wasn’t like Theo and his relationship had been very healthy either. It was Draco’s sixth year at Hogwarts, so he could barely focus on anything other than his own pain. Theo had suffered from Draco’s lack of attention. Theo held no ill will, always saying Draco didn’t know his suffering on purpose, but Draco still felt guilty.
. Draco had to basically choke on Potter’s cock to get the message across to Potter that he
“Yeah, ok.” Draco whispered, pulling Harry back to his chest.
I've been getting such kind comments that it is difficult for my heart not to feel full. My life has been a stress ball and this sometimes feels indulgent when I have so many other things to do. But your comments really do bring me solace and help me gear up for anything.
Harry's body stills, his breathing evens out. Ron feels his throat catch when Harry turns closer to him and wraps an arm around his body.
His host grins again. "Isn't it? It's an eclectic collection of items my family sends me and stuff I buy from the market. Or something my neighbors give me when it gets really cold." He waved his knitted gloves.
Malfoy’s bed was empty when he reached their shared bedroom. The light was on in their bathroom and he heard the water from the sink. Harry took the break to quickly change into his pajamas, so Malfoy couldn’t see him like that. Well, he supposed, if they were going to be on the same team then they’d probably see each other in half-dressed states quite often. He ignored the heat rising to his face and kept buttoning up his top.
They leaned forward, pulling his bound hands away from his twitchy cock. "Naughty, naughty," they murmured, kneeling on the bed with one knee in between his spread legs.
And maybe, just maybe, it was those memories that triggered the visceral response he had when he saw the white-blond head of hair walk out of the kitchen and toward the eighth years’ table. He stood up from his seat, hands clutching the sides of the table, eyes not leaving the other boy (well, a man now). Hermione gasped and tugged at his sleeve urgently.
If he had looked up, he would've noticed the gleam in Tertius' eye. He would've noticed the way he suddenly sat up a bit straighter.
The door to the room swung open and he felt himself stiffen up. He wasn’t facing the door, and he decided to keep it that way. Keep his head low, his mouth shut, and just focus on unpacking all of his clothing. His mother and Pansy went shopping in the main shopping center of Tinworth after his procedure, finding a new wardrobe of clothing that would fit properly. Not that his old clothes didn’t, but Draco misjudged the difference it made between having his chest flattened with clothing and having all of the unwanted flesh being transfigured off.
"Mhm."
He was just a normal guy, really. Anything that made him special was missing now that Draco was looking at him again. "Who are you really, then?"
Teddy stood, leaning against the door to James' bedroom. Across the room, swept in wide painterly strokes, was the deep orange of sunset. The colors heightened the experience of watching smooth skin, blemished only by a galaxy of light brown freckles, being uncovered by plain clothing. Typically, James liked wearing extravagant displays of his family's wealth, but for nights like these, with just the two of them, he opt for a more humble approach.
Warnings: swearing, very brief description of self-mutilation, heteronormative family pressures
Tertius leaned over and pointed at the vial and Zygmunt could see the way his arm muscles shifted below his skin. He wasn't wearing his robes and his bronzed shoulders were on display. Zygmunt felt miserable, he allowed himself a bit more ogling than considered normal. Tertius had shiny brown eyes, like coins— golden shining in the sunlight, darker in the shadows. Those dark eyes were searching his expression, hoping for a yes.
This one is short and sweet. Probably takes place in fifth year or something, before James officially got together with Lily. Sirius is a sappy little shit and I love him
"Oh. Um. Yeah, makes sense. I've done numerous interviews with other lycanthropes—"
She sat back on the bed and pushed his legs apart. He still squirmed a bit in embarrassment, but Blaise said she loved seeing how open and wet he got for her before she even touched him. Knowing she was genuinely attracted to him helped him move past the shame from exposing his intimate parts.
I want to experiment a bit more with my style and I love writing dialogue, so that's all this chapter is. Like 95% dialogue and 5% phrases that give a bit more context to the dialogue. Werewolf Draco Malfoy is my absolute favorite trope (creature!Draco is my favorite no matter what creature, actually)
There was a plan for what to do. A plan was always put in place, one they both talked about in extensive detail the days, or sometimes hours, before everything. Too many interruptions could happen in their busy lives to risk anything but proper, thought-out time together.
. And, well, it only takes a few moments for him to decode it:
Regulus always used to give her in depth rants about whatever his idiot brother and his friends were doing that week. In letters and in person.
"What's up with the face?" Blaise asked.
It doesn't take long for the sparks to explode in one shattering orgasm. Especially not when Pansy slides her free hand down, slipping under her skirt's waistband, and rubbing against the front of her panties.
“It’s getting pretty late…” Potter said, as if he was trying to make small talk. Which, Draco thought, would be a terrible idea in their current situation. What could be more unbearable than small talk when one of the speakers was naked?
Harry’s eyes narrowed. He braced himself for a tragic reveal: he was secretly an animagus, or a vampire, or that he was actually Nagini the snake all along. Harry wouldn’t put it past fate to make the first guy he wanted to be with be some sort of magical creature. What a dilemma.
Blaise smiled wickedly. "You'd like that, wouldn't you? Being blindfolded and edged for hours, unsure of when I'll increase or decrease. I wouldn't even need to ask you to tell me when you're going to cum. Your body has always been so honest."
Harry falls on top of him while he's removing his shirt, making Draco giggle despite the fact that it makes the pain worse. It's all too much, the skin-to-skin contact. Draco feels so desperate. He just wants his knot inside of him, holding the two together for as long as it takes to breed him. No, he doesn't want that. His heat wants that from him.
"No, I know that. It's just. I don't know. Wizard's chess isn't the same as Muggle chess."
Ron grimaced. He shuddered. “I just can’t imagine wanting to go
His eyes would shine with hatred and longing. Eventually, Harry would close the distance, fisting his hand into Malfoy's robes and pulling his face into Harry's. There would be no asking or teasing. Just pure force and teeth and urgency. What if this was the last time they'd ever see each other? They had to make it count.
He growled low to himself and nearly kicked at the large door in front of him. When will that damned Headmaster leave his office and talk to him? How much work did he need to do? It wasn't as if he had any students' papers to grade any longer.
Number seven included the idea of using polyjuice potion to become a new, attractive person for your partner. As unethical as the entire premise was, Draco was shocked by how many people truly believed it. Why on earth would you be sexually active with someone you weren't attracted to?
She frowned but nodded. Her skirt swished as she stood up. Her eyes glanced over Ron and Hermione. “I’m glad you guys are together. Ron’s Qubats are finally going away.”
"You like when I squirm," James countered with a grin of his own.
"Wow. A Malfoy, in the flesh."
Steady hands held onto him, straightening him out. "Alright there?"
Harry's hand doesn't waver when he picks up the dagger. Which shouldn't surprise Draco because this is the same man who dedicated every inch of his time to this ritual. But it does because he's going to die by that dagger and he doesn't even flinch. It doesn't faze him in the slightest.
He seemed insistent on that last point. Aggravated, almost. Draco’s chest burst in satisfaction. He liked knowing that he could still get under Potter’s skin, could still get him pissed off.
Draco cleared his throat. He wanted to ignore the sting behind his eyes. "If this is about my past as a Death Eater, I want to assure you that I've done my time and I obtained this job through legal means. Mr. Barnes has also been cleared of all affiliations—"
"Please tell me you're not expecting me to last long," he pleaded.
Or at least that's what Bathilda said. Gellert did tell Albus, but he has a tendency to lie about the most mundane things, so Albus wasn't inclined to believe him at first.
"You thought wrong. I distinctly remember telling you not to say you like me until you mean it."
He could recognize that voice anywhere. Tertius Langley, a year older than him. A prodigy in Transfiguration if Zygmunt ever saw one. And absolutely incredible, body-wise.
Sirius had a tight grip on the brat's blond locks. His face was twisted in a satisfying display of pain and hatred. Practically
Draco's arse was pert and smooth when he finally pulled down the briefs. Milky white. Unblemished. Sirius wanted to mark it up black and blue. Show the Malfoy brat what it's
. Draco found himself hit with a pang of wanting.
"We're going to have to tell them... eventually," Pansy says and Hermione can feel her jaw against her shoulder, moving as she speaks.
I don't write a lot of major character death. There is definitely an alternative ending out there in which everyone is alive and happy, but I decided not to write that one.
Ron leaned over and whispered, "Well this should be good."
He looks up at the sound of approaching footsteps. In front of him, breathing heavily, is Draco Malfoy. The boy looks thinner than Harry's ever seen him before; his robes shrink his body so much. His face is gaunt and his eyes are sunken. Even how heavily he's breathing is odd. Was this the same boy who could challenge Harry at Quidditch any day of the week?
Yes, they made the right choice in not binding his whole body. In their satisfaction, Teddy felt their hair shifting, growing longer than before until it spilled over their shoulders. They adored having long hair during these scenes; James usually begs him to keep his hair long, says having it gives them a stunning aura. But in their line of work, wrestling injured dragons into rehabilitation programs, long hair was a downside.
"Before we go any further, I need to tell you something."
"I don't know," Harry lied. Then he said, "I just thought the Wizarding World would have special sex toys. That's all."
Draco tugged on Potter’s shoulder and he turned to him. He shrugged. “Well? I started it last time, I would’ve thought you’d return the favor.”
The sweat and cum disappeared after they spoke. That spell was so helpful for times like these; when Teddy just wanted to lie down with their lover and comfort him. Standing up to get a handkerchief always ruined the mood and they didn't like leaving James so soon after a scene.
Dean laughed. "People really dueled to get married?"
"Nothing but this is worth more than my life, Draco."
“Never thought you and the ferret would ever shake hands.”
Draco raised an eyebrow. “Why would I do that? What could I possibly gain from making everyone hate me more for touching their precious Potter, as well as encouraging the Aurors to put me under probation or something? I bet they’re already aching to do so, I wouldn’t give them a reason.”
Draco took the information in. Stewed over it. He narrowed his eyes. "It's not 'my shop.' I just work there."
Draco apparated them to his apartment building, stumbling a bit from anxiety and the fuzzy feeling in his head from some kind of Valpolicella. He couldn't remember what the server told them it was. Hank helped steady him and they made their way into Draco's apartment.
. Draco dropped his wand in surprise when he first got pulled away. He really wanted it now. He wanted a lot of things. Most of all, he wanted the vine to stop
He rolled his eyes so hard it hurt the front of his skull. With a mocking note in his voice, he replied: “I think I can tell the wrong sort for myself, thanks.” And took his hand in his own.
"Want has nothing to do with it, Mr. Potter—"
His arse aches now. Harry's slid out and put his prick away, casting a quick
Dean nodded, impressed. "Nice."
Pansy removes herself from Hermione's shoulder and grins as they stare at each other's faces. "Sounds like a plan, Granger danger."
Seamus' face turned redder and redder the more he thought.
He's tying up another letter on a potion with a nice lapis ribbon when she hears the front door open.
Harry grinned toothily. Something inside of him was bright and warm. Is that what reciprocation felt like? Wow, he could get used to that.
Blaise helped him put up posters and photographs, before they even got together. When their relationship was a rocky friendship that bloomed from get-togethers at Seamus' place. Blaise honestly helped remind him how to decorate his home— she was one of his only friends who had a history of hedonism and collecting nice items just for the hell of it. She was the one who convinced Harry that it's okay to own more than five shirts. It's okay to spend extra on gourmet food and deluxe accessories, especially since he had money to spare.
"I do," they acquiesced. With a quick
robes, tailored to resemble his father’s straight-cut, dark greens, and blues, and grays.
Draco gasped, genuinely gasped, as Potter gripped his shoulders and pulled him close. He was an inch or two taller than him but was still able to shove his cold nose into Potter’s warm neck, the black hair tickling his forehead.
"— I will ask you, Harry Potter, truth or dare?"
Harry's gut twisted. That didn't sound good. By Malfoy's expression he was thinking the same thing.
Few House Elves were there this late at night. They cowered at the sight of Draco, but relaxed when Potter followed close behind him. He tried very hard not to take offense to that. He knows his family doesn’t have a great track record with House Elves, but it’s not like he was especially dastardly to them. They even looked between them as if Draco must’ve bewitched Potter to get him to be in the same room as him.
He wasn’t the only one on the pitch, wasn’t the only one whose boots were slowly diminishing. The other eighth years were waiting in seven different groups. Madame Hooch was fluttering between all of them, constantly switching the students around, her hands feeling their shoulders and the tops of their heads. Every year, when Draco was on the Slytherin team, she would do this. Madame Hooch was not the type of woman to explain herself, although an older boy named Lucian Bole told him she had a gift for knowing who was supposed to be where. Very rarely back then were students moved to different positions, but Madame Hooch was as busy as a bee for this team.
Okay, maybe the world was ending just a little bit.
. How adorable was that?) "Not sure yet. Someone spewed it up after ingesting an unknown potion and when it began moving on its own, I put a stasis charm on it. I was going to send it to the Department for magical creatures to see if they can figure out what it is."
