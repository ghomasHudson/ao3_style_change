"Wait a minute." Blaise cut Draco off in the middle of his tirade and turned to Hannah again, giving her an amused smirk. "You mean to tell me, you actually
It started when Seamus Finnigan decided to spike the drinks of all of the Slytherins with a Weasley concoction during dinner, while everyone was eating in the Great Hall. Within a few minutes, every single Slytherin (including Potter, because apparently Finnigan didn't even think to spare the bloody Chosen One from his ridiculous tomfoolery) began hiccuping like crazy, and colorful, quaffle-sized bubbles began coming out of their mouths.
On the contrary, if it wasn't for Aria Potter speaking up for him and his mother during their Ministry Trial a few weeks ago, Draco was certain that his entire family would probably be rotting away in Azkaban by now. Instead, thanks to Potter's carefully worded testimony, he and his mother were actually the only ones to walk away somewhat exonerated from this whole 'Death Eater' ordeal, their only punishments being mandatory community service.
ridiculously hedonistic, polygamous lifestyle, do you? You're practically more famous than Aria is these days with how many times you're mentioned in those gossip tabloids! So shut up and let me enjoy my wedding planning in peace." She huffed.
, no one knows what became of her and her body has not been found until this day." Fleur told them grimly, shaking her head.
2. I know the NEWTs are usually held somewhere from May to June. But I changed it in this story. Just presume the war effed up the schedule this year.
The moment passed too soon, making the situation a little awkward as both Slytherins didn't seem to know what to say anymore.
"Calm yourself, young man." McGonagall reached across the table and handed him a box of tissues. As Corey sniffed and wiped frantically at his eyes, she sighed and turned her attention back to Aria. "Exactly what are you trying to tell me then, Potter?"
"Pretty good, actually." Ron answered, giving her a grin. "We have a really good line-up this year. Ginny's spectacular of course. I mean, she's been training all summer so no surprise there. And the new Chasers who joined aren't bad either. Demelza Robbins is
The smile on Fleur's face vanished at her question. "At that point, if a veela is refused by her chosen mate, she's stuck. She's bound to a man who doesn't want her. This rejection is what often drives young unmated veelas to such despair that they sometimes cut off their own wings or, even worse, commit suicide." She finished with a grim shake of her head.
agree?" Aria spoke her last three words in the exact same, faux sweet voice that Skeeter had used on her just moments before.
of you to be able to read it. It is very difficult to read our names if you are not veela and there is a reason for this. Our names are
She angled her mouth toward his, murmuring pleas that were so incoherent and nonsensical that she wasn't quite sure if he understood her, but Draco did as she wanted and kissed her anyway. Their fingers intertwined together as he brought her hands up, pinning her wrists above her head.
She closed her eyes and threw her head back, flaring her wings wide open and forcing the muscles along her thighs to contract as she rode him faster and fucked him even harder, causing the headboard of the bed to begin banging noisily against the wall. Draco's voice broke as he cried out, his hands bruising her skin as he gripped at her and thrust upwards, desperately trying to match her merciless pace.
They all fell into a surprisingly comfortable silence after that, and the only sounds heard in the room were the scratching of their quills against their parchment and the occasional footsteps of other Slytherin students who happened to pass by their strange group while entering or exiting the Common Room.
Somehow, Aria managed to resist the urge to hex the handsome blond prat into the next century and instead, turned around to give Hagrid a rueful grin. "So er…yeah. Unfortunately, I'd like to apologize in advance, Hagrid, because…er…I'm here with
our schedules was Advance Muggle Studies." Draco answered flatly, ignoring the way Pansy continued to grumble under her breath as he deposited his bag onto one of the empty seats near the back of the classroom.
for a Malfoy to lose his wits that way, especially since there were so many witches back then who weren't above using such bewitchments to try and impregnate herself with our line or something." He explained.
He stood up from his seat and stalked purposefully towards her. When she saw him, Aria straightened back up, her eyes widening in surprise when he pinned her roughly against the wall with his body.
Ignoring Aria's angry shouts, Bentley raised his wand, pointing it against the side of Draco's head. Within seconds, Draco's eyes rolled back and his entire form went limp as he fell, unconscious. Bentley threw him off with a sneer; and Aria heard a few more panicked screams around them as Bentley disappeared again. She rushed to check on Draco; and when she was, more or less, assured that he was unharmed, she stood back up — only for Bentley to reappear directly behind her.
As soon as the large group had gone, Aria turned to a sleepy-looking, pajama-clad Draco just as he entered the living area, a thick, green blanket wrapped around his shoulders. He sat down into his favorite armchair, a steaming cup of coffee in his hands, and fixed his narrowed-eyed stare at the closed, common room entrance.
"You want me to be the third wheel in the most romantic city in the world? No thanks, Hermione. I can't stand all the public displays of affection you and Ron get up to these days." Aria teased, smirking.
Simply by listening to the sounds of her sighs and the soft, high-pitched cries that she couldn't seem to hold in no matter how much she tried, he was already discovering so much about the many little ways he could pleasure her. Aria had always been easy for him to read after all, he had studied her facial reactions for
Draco almost tripped over his own foot, stunned by the casual way she had just talked about Aria being a veela. Luna shrugged and gave him a smug look.
"We don't know where Aria went." Blaise answered uneasily beside him, and Draco noticed for the first time that Blaise had several cuts on his face and that his left eye was bruised. "All we know is that she's hiding and Fisher ran off to look for her."
." Draco frowned and took another sip of his wine, struggling to think of the best way he could verbalize all of the confusing thoughts in his head. "It's hard to explain, really. It's just…I grew up with her
Draco's eyes dimmed and his expression grew resentfully bitter at her words. He stalked towards her and pushed her down onto her back, stubbornly placing both of his hands on either side of her head so that he caged her between him and the hospital bed.
"Fuck off, Zabini." Pansy snapped at him from where she was lying, exhausted and half-asleep, on the couch, her legs draped comfortably over Neville's lap.
thing! So if we're going to be drinking a lot tonight, we ladies have to watch out for each other! These boys are all
She swallowed nervously and clasped her hands primly behind her back before lowering her gaze to the floor.
"And you as well, Girl-Who-Lived." Firenze stood tall but he inclined his head at her in a respectful bow. "I have heard tales of your many heroic exploits while you were absent from Hogwarts last year. Yours is a story that shall continue to live on for centuries to come, even among us centaurs." He told her.
Bentley charged at Draco and the latter obliged by simultaneously evading him and punching him hard in the face. By then, Draco was far too gone at this point to hear Aria's angry shouts as he and Bentley finally hurled themselves at each other, fists, elbows and feet flying everywhere and smashing violently against the other's in a fit of mindless rage.
She shot Hagrid an apologetic look before reluctantly turning around, arching an eyebrow at the blond scowling petulantly behind her.
Technically, the story officially ends here; but I will be including one last chapter for the Epilogue just as a thank you for everyone who kept up with me until the end. Thank you all so much, I never would have been able to complete this without your constant support and encouragement!
"Yeah, it's not a problem." Corey answered him with a careless shrug and made his way over to a small wooden bench that was situated along the perimeter of an adjacent courtyard. "I'll just wait over here until you get back." He added.
sorry about that." Pansy gave her a sarcastic smile before she sat down gracefully into her seat, oblivious to the way Draco rolled his eyes at her antics as he took the seat between her and Blaise.
Draco turned to look at her in surprise but Aria just shrugged and began leading him to the tall building at the very end of the street.
So, as a big heartfelt 'thank you' for all the wonderful and positive reception I received for the last chapter, I made this update extra long. I was originally planning to cut this chapter in half again but then I figured - I have such wonderful, supportive readers anyway, I may as well post the whole thing. FYI, I think this may be my longest chapter to date for this story lol.
Draco was startled out of his thoughts when he suddenly heard her curse beside him, followed by a loud 'thud'. He immediately sat up in alarm, glancing over the side of the bed to see Aria sprawled on the floor in a tangle of her own hair and limbs.
"Fortunately, tying our hair up like this and keeping all of the strands locked will diminish most of the effects of the allure, making it manageable enough that most wizards will be able to ignore it. Muggle men, I am not so sure." She added as an afterthought.
Aria waited for the initial shock from their group to die down before she looked up, chuckling when she saw everyone else's amused expressions.
of all people, she would have probably had that person sent to St. Mungo's for a psychological evaluation.
No sooner had the last few words left Greg's mouth, Aria finally smiled at someone over his shoulder; and this time, he followed her gaze. As soon as he saw Astoria there, standing right behind him with her arm looped through Blaise's and her face completely flushed, Greg's eyes widened and he shot up from his seat in dismay.
Her surprise was short-lived, however, because a few seconds later, Aria's eyes narrowed, and the smile on her face became vicious.
with himself), Aria coughed and awkwardly averted her gaze, pretending to fiddle with her utensils again so as to save him from his embarrassment.
"My grandmother Dorea Potter." Aria answered with a sigh as she finished cleaning the windows and began working on the desks.
And so the next morning, every Gryffindor who came down to breakfast had shiny white hair, black teeth, and looked like they were suffering from a bad case of the chicken pox —only the spots on their face were silver while the rest of their skin was dark green.
"Aren't you two going to go after her?" Aria finally spoke up, directing her blank stare at Blaise and Draco.
When Zach seemed to hesitate and looked reluctant to go into further details, Pansy spoke again, drawing everyone's attention back to the frown on her face. She ignored everyone else's questioning looks, however, and directed her attention solely on Blaise and Draco.
again." Pansy muttered under her breath beside Draco, rolling her eyes when she noticed the way most of the boys inside the room were blushing as they stared unabashedly at the tall blonde.
"At least they seemed to have dropped the investigation for now." Blaise added as they crossed the school courtyard on their way to the other wing of the castle. "But the other houses are
His answer came a moment later, in the form of another, unknown voice, though the words really baffled him even more.
"Will you, Valerio Lanai, promise to never hold anyone captive who to your knowledge claims an allegiance, friendship or kinship to Harry Potter from the moment that he mates with our son, except in the defence of yourself or your family, friends or allies?"
It was curiously like an autoimmune disease: the system that should have protected and helped had attacked instead and thereby had ravaged the body that hosted it: the wizarding community's trust. In the aftermath people turned to other places for aid: namely those that had the money and influence to protect those loyal to them from a ministry that was still as corrupt, still as incompetent as ever.
The vision broke as the black woman cleared her throat, perhaps aware of the observation, and suddenly Narcissa felt overcome with the surrealism of it all, the absurdity. What were they doing, acting like grudging allies or rather like enemies under a ceasefire, as if a friendship that had been forged over decades with trust and goodwill and affection could break so easily, was worth so little?
"Fortunately, I was never dependant on the benevolence of others." Adler answered. "But where my husband goes, I will follow."
If only he could utter even one reassurance to them, he might calm down enough to be able to properly concentrate on finding the one (and probably violent, with his luck) expedient to the trap he was walking into, but with the Aurors still glancing at him with the same pity and concern a phoenix with ripped off wings might gather, that small mercy was as much a physical impossibility as a foul-free quidditch game between Slytherin and Gryffindor.
"Step behind me if you will." Draco instructed Harry and stepped past him, turning towards the mirror so that the black-haired teen only needed to close the small distance between him and neither one of them would have to face the other directly while they were connected thusly.
Breathing in deeply, Draco strode towards the tree-like pillar in the middle of the room where four paintings provided the portrait of his ancestor with room to manoeuvre around and the possibility to keep the entirety of the window front in sight.
He didn't wait for an answer, just grabbed the door and slammed it shut. The last thing he saw of the pair was how McAuley grasped the shoulders of healer Cowan and pulled him backwards to evade the wooden door. What a pity, he would have enjoyed the sound of Cowan's breaking nose.
Insanely he wondered whether breaking his skin might free the force caged within him, whether, if he clawed his flesh open, his magic might spill out along with his blood, drowning his enemy in red and gold…
But it would allow him to guide it during the transformation and should Potter ever mate – not that he would have a say in the matter anyway – his mates would have a much easier time trying to tame that power.
The knowledge that Dudley didn't hate him anymore (he wasn't so sure about Petunia and Vernon, you hate what you fear after all) and that his friends would not even abandon him if he ever should lose his ability to perform magic had come only after Harry had awoken. Then the idea that had scared him so much during his sleep had seemed so ridiculous: Ron and Hermione leaving him with the Dursleys, breaking off all contact… god, after all they had been through they'd never do that to him, it was unthinkable. Whatever happened, he knew he'd always have them. But his magic, Merlin, his magic! He wouldn't have survived losing that.
"I don't want you to leave either." The words were breathed against Harry's ear, tickling and almost succeeding in making him squirm. "I want you to stay here and let us help you."
What she couldn't deal with, however, was giving her mirror to the infuriating horde of red-haired weasels!  And that was exactly what she would do. Because Blaise had asked her. Nicely.
"How did you react?" she asked, leaning forward. "You know that sometimes it is leniency that wins favour."
Harry shivered, muscles trembling from brutal rage and shock and fear and he knew he should look up into the eyes of the kidnapper looming in the forefront of his mirror like a too-close enemy in the foe glass; he should start negotiating, start trying to free his friends but for endlessly stretching seconds he could do nothing but stare on and on, because there was Hermione – the lively, fiery woman, the beautiful, wonderful, smart Hermione – with her white hands tied together behind her lying on the ground and a gag distorting her red lips, tear streaks running from her terrified eyes, painfully wide and pleading like those of a wounded deer about to be mauled by the hunter's pack of hounds, yet unable to run.
It would be perfect: a beautiful, large villa with a spacious park, including a large pool and access to the beach; all of which were guarded by a dizzying amount of privacy spells and actually belonged to Blaise as a part of his father’s heritage. It was perfect in every way. And after a few days, Amalyne was certain that nature and instincts would do their part to resolve the issue. Such power … it had to belong to her family. Not to mention the improvement in reputation it might entail. The Boy-Who-Lived, forever bound to her family.
“Now, you really should go.” Lucius said with a smirk. “I told them to leave the boy alone but still…”
Harry desperately tried to keep his heartbeat and breathing under control. Oh, Merlin, how he wished he didn't have to do that. "Is that how you would treat another Zabini?" He asked as sternly as he was able to, but he almost faltered when the large eyes became even larger and started to shine suspiciously. "Blaise ordered you to treat me like you would a Zabini! Do you want to go against the direct orders of the master of this house?"
Knowing that his long-time friend was much easier to get information from than the snakes, Harry finally settled on following Hermione suit and turning his questioning stare back to Ron's stubborn, freckled face.
Then suddenly the grin diminished as Harry turned serious again. "And you really needn't worry about me: My whole childhood and a good portion of my youth was sacrificed for 'the greater good'. This is my life now and I won't let myself be pressured into doing something I really don't want."
There was nothing to be done however, regardless of how much Blaise wanted it to be different. He’d rather have Harry forcefully mated to himself and Draco, rather have to endure his hate and scorn than see him dead.
Blaise sighed once more and held up his hands in a placating gesture that didn't seem to have any effect at all. "I reacted on instinct, Harry. I'm sorry."
The words – that seemed to have surprised even Draco, for he didn't dare to continue and the thin, sharp feathers in his hair flattened down against his skull – cut down clankingly into the suddenly freezing night air between them, hanging there like crystalline blades, sharp and deadly and mocking.
For now it crouched as if it wanted to climb down from its pedestal, the claws of one large hand already deeply embedded in the front side, and its long, spike covered dragon-tail wound around the stone as if to stabilise itself during its descend.
I guess I should warn everyone that I didn’t really read books 6 and 7, found them too frustrating and depressing… that means I’ll try to stick to the original story as best as I can without having read it. There are going to be some changes though: I am totally 100% refusing to accept the deaths of Tonks, Lupin and Fred. Honestly I cannot bear the thought of George being left behind and Teddy growing up without his parents.
"I don't know what you have been told," Blaise pressed on, allowing a hint of righteous indignation to enter his voice "but I assure you, it isn't true!"
He sighed and reached over to clasp one of Narcissa's narrow shoulders. There were bitter tears in her eyes, turning them into glistening sapphires, cold and beautiful.
For as long as Harry himself and not his magic, was in control of his body and thoughts, Draco would never decipher him.
Forcing himself to concentrate on the panicked, agonized look in those unseeing, teary emerald-green eyes and the small chirps Potter still continued to make, probably not even aware of it, Draco calmed. A bucket of ice water could not be as effective as the sounds of a frightened, hurting submissive.
"You can take it willingly or have it administered by force." The man said in an almost bored tone of voice and Harry shot him a nasty glare, hating him more with every second, every icy word that left his lips. But his blackmailer only raised an eyebrow in challenge, a confident reminder of how defenceless his scheming had left Harry.
Severus himself was fond for the boys in his own way. He had watched them grow, tried to encourage their potential beyond the petty ambitions of their parents. And now that the fragile seedlings were finally just starting to thrive…
"I know." She whispered back, cocking one elegantly curved eyebrow teasingly as she straightened herself and turned to leave. Lucius watched her measured, graceful steps, the sway of her slender hips. Gods, how he loved her…
Harry held out his left hand for Draco to take, locking eyes with the blonde’s which flashed in an unspoken challenge, a challenge Harry couldn’t
?!" Blaise grabbed and shook his shoulders once and as he lost his calm, a flood of emotions splashed over Harry, hushing him with their overwhelming intensity. Anger, concern, protectiveness. Above all protectiveness.
Glaring at his mother and future parents-in-law, Blaise tapped his wine glass with his wand lightly, a bell-like sound filling the room. “May I have your attention for a few moments, please? Thank you. It was a wonderful evening, thank you all for coming and celebrating the news of our engagement with us. Unfortunately, at this very moment, a new Vykélari is unexpectedly fledging without elder supervision and both Draco and I are required to help him through the transition as Lucius’ substitutes. We therefore bid you all farewell and a good homeward journey. Again, thank you all for coming and for your gracious gifts.”
Ron was still watching her with silent concern, rubbing her hand soothingly and Arthur … Arthur looked like a rock, tall and calm and unmoveable as he gazed steadily at each of them.
Blaise barely had the time to prepare himself for a rough landing before the whirling colours deflagrated and gave way to an inky blackness. Momentarily blinded Blaise fell, his flailing limps breaking through small twigs, rough bark and rushing leaves. One of his hands managed to get hold of something that burst under the pressure into sticky wetness, before he impacted harshly with the dirt covered ground. He rolled uncontrolledly over sharp stones and hard roots that bore painfully into his flesh, scraped at his skin and robbed him of the breath to even cry out.
"You may test me whenever you please." Draco said, his words deceptively soft. "But I'd rather you would not force me to follow through on my words. As I said: I do value your advice."
This finally, Blaise mused, might be the fascination and the true source of Draco's obsession: that inner power Harry held to make people try and improve themselves and the world for him. And the blonde's hate and resentment that rooted deeply in Harry's refusal to even acknowledge him as someone of the smallest importance despite his bloodline and everyone else already thinking of him like that, was probably cemented even further by his inability to follow through with it and gain the recognition and appreciation of the Golden Boy and be acknowledged and seen by any- and everyone as a worthy equal to him.
The Submissive, but I really can't find any useful information on the subject in the whole library…"
Draco sighed in relief and let go of the bed frame, lying one of his hands on Potter's cheek. Softly he let one finger trace the lower trim of that pale mask, letting sparks of his magic travel into the tear stained skin.
Instead of falling, like Draco had half expected him to, the Gryffindor rushed forward without losing a metre of height, gliding on his wings with the grace of a vulture and the nimbleness of a goshawk, leaving the young dominant Vykélari behind, helpless to do anything as he continued towards the boundaries of Blaise's land.
Silently Draco and Blaise watched the Gryffindor pull out one of the white leather chairs jerkily and sit down, the movements shouting the brunet's irritation out to the world in no uncertain manner.
Blaise felt a smile tug at the corners of his lips, completely approving of the cautious answer. Now he was convinced that Harry would be good for Draco, able and willing to give him the opportunity that Blaise couldn't: the fair opportunity to honestly prove himself to someone who was neither prepossessed for him nor would pass judgement on him based on actions he had done while he was little more than a child or teenager under the thumbs of its parents. One person more who might come to honestly appreciate the Slytherin Prince for something else than his reputation.
." He drawled. "It's as simple as that. I am sure a wizard of your stature will have no problem to grasp a concept that should come naturally to you anyway. You
Usually Severus was rather proficient in compartmentalising his emotions whenever they didn’t mix well. Instead of enforcing an emulsion through sheer patience and effort like many less efficient and practical minds were often wont to do, the potions master tended to simply pick the one most useful to him and ignore the others, incarcerating them in the far recesses of his mind until such a time as they could be picked apart or sometimes be forgotten until they shrivelled, died and rotted away into dust and dirt.
It took me two years of hiding my state behind facades to be exhausted and desperate enough to finally seek help in a friend that I had lost contact with after school almost a decade before. It didn't take her more than 30 minutes after I sent that mail to call back and in the following two years she build me up again and probably saved my life the way I was going. She's never going to read this, she's too straight and too much no-nonsense to like this kind of fiction, but she's one of the most important people in my life. All the best to her!
Therefore he answered the unspoken challenge with a lazy smile and a smooth "That is quite alright, Harry."
The man whipped his arms up to protect himself but not quickly enough. Dirt and small stones and grass hit him directly in the face and he spluttered, throwing his head to the side and clenching his eyes shut, even as his hands moved to rub them clean again, leaving him helpless and unable to react.
"He is … Draco is a very private person, Harry." He said finally, knowing it wouldn't be enough to divert or placate the brunet when he gave him a rather sceptical look.
Fingers pressed against his throat then in retaliation, sharp, claw-like nails threatening the delicate skin; not enough to draw blood or to hamper his breathing, but enough to be felt a little bit more with every excited beat of his heart echoing through his carotid, every intake of breath. And this time there really was a snarl distorting Draco's lips. But Blaise didn't back away and didn't try to break the other dominant's hold on him, encountering the intense stare evenly, challengingly.
And why, why in Medea's name had only the one portkey been activated? What atrocity could have taken place that could have made Blaise abandon Draco or the other way round – or had the portkey automatically activated due to its bearer being wounded too badly?
"That Werewolf Lupin is a good fighter and he'll come to Harry's help no matter what." Blaise continued, remembering what their Gryffindor had told them about his father's friends only a few hours ago.
“Damn it Blaise! We need to fly up there!” He breathed urgently before hurriedly waving for Giallina, Harry’s Elf, to approach, raising her into his arms and spreading his white golden wings.
Without saying anything, Blaise leaned over to press a soft kiss to Draco's shoulder, still clad in his dark green dress robes. Immediately Draco's posture softened and he in turn laid his cheek against his lover's forehead, rubbing tenderly against the soft skin, returning the affectionate gesture.
It was not a completely new experience but it had been rare enough during the last few years to still be surprising: none of the newcomers even took a second look at his scar while they shook his hands with sure, firm grips and introduced themselves to him in that typical melodic lilt that Blaise only adopted when he was tired or angry and maybe when he was otherwise ... impassioned (and god, that thought made Harry freeze for a moment).
Severus comes to the Manor to congratulate his godson and fiancé since he wasn't at their engagement party but is told by Lucius of the situation.
The only thing that might stop Harry now while not risking his life was the influence of a dominant's magic but the submissive needed to be able to see or feel it…
than heard. And within a moment he had wriggled his hand out of Blaise's loose grasp and taken a step back.
Draco was shivering with rage when the Italian Aurors at last released him from the paralysis Harry had cursed him with. Not that anyone but him and maybe Blaise would have noticed the barely perceptible tremors in his shoulders and hands, but still; his fury was so intense that the disgust and revulsion on their captors' faces didn't even faze him in the slightest.
The worst was that there was nothing to be done. Even if Narcissa Malfoy had disclosed Harry's current location - which she hadn't - the fact remained that any interference of a normal wizard in what was usually euphemised as 'Vykélari courtship', was highly illegal and punished with five to ten years in Azkaban. Harry would have their heads if they got themselves landed into the wizarding prison, besides, once there, they'd be of no use to their friend.
Every single one of their little group would still have followed the Dark Lord or – in Blaise's case – remained neutral, wouldn't they? The fact that Goyle and Crabbe had turned against Draco during the last stand and that Blaise, Theo and Pansy had fled at the earliest convenience (though of course, they had thought that Draco was somewhere among the evacuated Slytherins) should be proof enough.
Slowly he made his way to the desk opposite of the painting and the door to sit down, wishing that the desk was closed at the front and wouldn't leave him so open to the portrait's view because he had acquired a habit of jiggling with his left leg whenever he was nervous and sitting and he wouldn't be able to do that now without betraying his feelings to Ives. He just knew that he would be all fidgety in no time…
"Yes?" She cheeped after looking them over in a disparaging way that she must have copied from her mistress.
"Well done, Alfar." He praised quietly. "Now leave me alone but remain close by in case I need you."
If only they would gain more than a vessel of hate or worse, a breathing corpse. Because those lively eyes would either die or forever burn with betrayal that time would transform into disgust and loathing as surely as any seed can do nothing but perish or become whatever plant it was destined to grow into.
"Where is Potter, Mancini?" the minister hissed, trying with little success to not let his voice carry through the opulent entrance hall of the ministry.
Weasley smirked at them sharply like the carnivore that he was. "Yeah, well, but not that it sometimes can be better to face your enemies head-on. Understandable of course, I know that this concept has to be impossible to grasp for a snake."
It made dealing with his ancestor quite a precarious endeavour. One never knew if Adler was in the mind of helping or not. And Draco himself was not sure if this time he would get actually useful advice or only slashes from that sharp tongue. Fortunately he wouldn't need the elder Malfoy's advice, only information. But even that was sometimes hard to get as well, if Adler was not inclined to be helpful.
“Shit.” He groaned, gazing through tears of pain into the ghostly pale eyes of the stag. He couldn’t make out any emotions in those icy depths but the animal stood frozen just as he did. Unmoving because it had recognized him? Draco hoped so. He hoped it was over, he hoped Blaise was alive, hoped they’d all be still alive in a few minutes.
him in a not so appropriate way! The tips of those slender fingers ghosted over his hip-bone and Harry honestly didn’t know what to think of the weird tingling sensation they left behind.
For a few tense seconds a poisonous silence stretched between them. Severus felt his breathing slow, his body, his every thought stilling, anticipating that first sign of aggression, that one impulse that would hurl him into action. His wand hand tilted just so into the perfect starting position for a quick spell or hex, slowly, so the movement would not catch her attention.
"Never mind!" he snarled as they stayed silent; he didn't really care much for what they had to say anyways. "Give me back my wand and my clothes and then take me back to … to London!"
But there had been more. Harry almost hadn't listened to it at the time, too furious with the rules that had been imposed on him. Yes: otherwise he was to be treated like a Zabini by all the House Elves; so the question was: what was a grounded Zabini allowed to do?
"And do find out what a respected family like the Lanais did to warrant a death sentence. We cannot possibly portrait Potter as a mindless spree killer..."
Behind this very curtain his best friends – the heart and soul of his very existence – were still at the hands of their tormentor, possibly awaiting their execution or, god forbid, already dead because he, Harry, was too busy taking revenge and committing murder to follow a simple one-sentence plan! Worse, without even a sparkle of remorse in his chest.
Of course, that theory was based on the reasonable but very wrong assumption that both portkeys had still been in Blaise and Draco’s possession when the Lanais had first taken Potter. But neither Narcissa nor Severus knew that one of them had been lost to the Lanais during the abduction.
The portrait to which he had bowed - it was the only one he would ever show that much respect to, including the picture of Dumbledore in Hogwarts - chuckled lowly.
Suddenly his expression became harsh and grim, transforming into a cruel mask of violence and determination and he flicked his wand, which spew out red glowing sparks like the spray of blood that followed a bullet to the head.
Ron's heart beat quicker but he refused to back down now; he would have to lie if he said that he wasn't nervous. Yes, he had known that he was doing something illegal, something that might cause him a world of problems, and so he had also deliberately done it in a way that would not allow him a retreat: he could not withdraw from a magical promise like the one he had just made, just like one couldn't back out of an Unbreakable Vow.
"I don't need to learn how to fly." Harry said stubbornly through his bafflement over their behaviour. "I need to learn how to control my magic so that I don't attack random people."
happen, how would the Slytherin get away? Harry would never run from danger and leave anyone behind, anyone. Even obnoxious, oddly protective and totally confusing Slytherins that
submissive Vykélari desirous? Did he desire them in turn or only their magic or was that all his magic? So many questions and he couldn't even find an answer to one of them.
Draco saw the birds draw together right in front of him, heard Blaise’s shout from behind and the sound curled around his chest and throat like a Devil’s Snare. Of course it wasn’t entirely unexpected that the birds launched an attack: they would have seen him coming long before they could have possibly sensed his magical aura and recognized him; Draco was still holding onto the feint hope that they would veer away as soon as they did, there was still time for them to do so… but the apparent aptness of the bird’s every movement made his skin crawl and he knew he had to be prepared to break through their barrier, not with brute force like a magical battering ram, but with the exact piercing power of a quarrel…
“I’ll do it.” She said, her voice harder than Severus would have expected under the circumstances. “I don’t want to, but I will do it.”
, Generale. There is... something is there, in the ground, in the air... And it doesn't react well to magic. I don't know if Zabini and Malfoy caused it or were just cursed alongside the land, but our usual crime scene reconstruction charms can't be employed and we have no witnesses that can, at this point in time, be interrogated."
The proper procedure therefore would have been to inform the head of the Vykélari council, namely one Valerio Lanai and ask if the council required the Guardia's assistance. And then, where would they be now?
Harry looked aside. They had already told him that, and it wasn't as if he thought they had lied to him, but still "They won't let me go, either."
Awkwardly, Harry lowered his gaze, flushing faintly from shame and embarrassment and searched futilely for anything to answer. He had never wanted to appear weak in front of the two Slytherins, never wanted them to see that losing his magic and encountering such levels of agony and fear when he hadn't known what was happening had achieved what Voldemort and his followers never had in all those years. But although he had known that this would be the consequence of asking after the transformation and the pain he had felt, he had needed the reassurance. And they hadn't batted an eye-lash and they were not mocking or teasing him, but they
Gleaming talons tapped and scratched harshly against the stone floor as they were ushered forward, their matter hard enough to leave deep furrows in the marble.
When magical governments all around the world agreed upon the International Statute of Wizarding Secrecy and moved their seats out of the eyes of muggles - and more often than not underground - the Italian senate had not been willing to leave behind their age-old, opulent government palace. It was a stately building meant to impress, with a large courtyard where wide arches and tall pillars proudly reached for the endless sky, where walls and floors and ceilings were clothed in marble and adorned with colourful, intricate mosaics and frescoes depicting the heroics and tragedies of Italian wizards and witches, magical beings and ferocious beasts.
"Tomorrow we will speak with my father and see what he found out. And if nothing comes out of it we will simply have to show him the thrill of flying on one's own wings, the wonderful things he could do with his magic. If he has the spirit of a Vykélari he will not be able to deny himself those pleasures."
Harry turned half away, the accusations and horrible claims leaving him more shaken than he wanted to admit, because he had feared the same thing only two days ago, after Blaise had dazzled him with that colourful display of his magical prowess. Hadn't his own magic whispered to him of all the numerous virtues of the two dominants who had lead him through his inheritance? It had appealed to him to submit to them, had made them seem more honourable than they perhaps were…
Potter's legs and his arms were fixated to the bed with sturdy, thick leather straps. Where he had fought against them the hardest – at his ankles and his wrists – they had chafed the skin to an angry red, making Draco's blood boil in rage: Vykélari had very sensitive tactile senses that Potter must have already regained at this point of the transformation; the high sensibility meaning a high density of nerves in the region and that meant that superficial injuries hurt like hell. A healer should know that, and they seemed untreated as of yet!
Immediately the tenseness drained from his body with a single breath of air that he hadn't even realised he had held in and he slumped back into the soft down pillows behind him. Raking one hand through his tousled hair Harry once again listened intently to the voices that appeared to come from behind the curtain to his living area and told himself to not be silly and calm down: who else could it be but Zabini and Malfoy after all, and Harry thought he could be fairly sure that they didn't wish him harm.
After fifteen minutes, he groaned, grabbing his wand and spelling the hangings shut, placing a silencing charm on it. He pushed his pyjama bottoms and pants down, cock jumping free. He jerked off quickly, mind effortlessly supplying the image of himself pounding into Malfoy.
Potter nodded dumbly, removing his pants (Draco watched gleefully as he hissed when his more-than-just-erect and
But staying true to his promise became about impossible as, after answering the question correctly, his eyes locked with Potter’s darkened ones. He held his gaze, not giving in to the pathetic urge to look away.
well if I say so myself,” she answered, grinning. “Now, spit out. What do we have to know about Snape?”
around the forest, eyes and ears working extra hard to pick up any worrisome movements or noises. The only sound he heard after a few minutes was Hagrid coming towards him, Longbottom and Hermione tailing him.
“Let’s leave her out of this.” He grimaced. “I don’t like being reminded of straights existing. And you don’t have to be
This is the second to last chapter of the first part of the Destinia series. Next weekend will be the last episode (kind of like an epilogue). Just a hands-up.
Late that night, him and Pansy met up in the common room. It was around one o’clock, so the room was empty. They had planned a meeting with Hermione, insisted by the girl, to get to know her better. Honestly, Draco was slightly hesitant. She was a Muggle-born, and
time to talk, Pans,” he said hastily, pulling her towards the Greenhouses for Herbology. “We have Herbology and I just saw a dragon!”
With a crack, the egg split into pieces and a baby dragon flopped out of it, falling onto the table. Draco thought Potter’s description of a crumpled black umbrella suited the black lump well. From his position at the window, he didn’t have as good a view as those inside, though he had a good view of the tail, black with small stubs, not long yet.
He finished his breakfast quickly, aware of the bothers Malfoy’s presence would bring him. And getting hard was all too likely when you were still feeling drowsy early in the morning.
Draco nodded thoughtfully. “I’ll check to see if I’ve already got anything to do against tomorrow evening.” Pansy gave Draco a short nod, and he took the book from the bedside table.
And from then on, both Draco and Pansy knew the adventure continued, and they were thoroughly excited about it.
Draco laughed coldly. “There are a lot of sexualities,” Draco said, shrugging, as he got off the bed. “I’ll owl you a book.” He winked and waved at him jokingly before entering the ensuite bathroom. “And get dressed and leave, you’re not staying the night!” Draco called out. He chuckled as he heard Potter’s laugh.
, but it won’t be easy getting him here. I think the best thing will be to send him over with some friends of mine who are coming to visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn’t
In the meantime, I’ve started writing another story, which I will probably be posting, but not yet. I’m not exactly sure when, but you can keep an eye on my account for when I do publish it. That will probably only be in a month or two. I just really need some time to myself, and don’t have a lot of time to write.
Draco gave a short laugh. “Haven’t told her what really bit you, huh?” he mocked, smirking nastily. He didn’t think he would ever stop hating the Weasleys, this Weasley specifically.
Draco took a deep breath as he entered the hospital wing. Looking around, he quickly noticed Weasley sitting on one bed, glaring as he looked back.
Draco felt his voice break a pitch higher, which it didn’t do often, and got quickly lost to the feeling of being fucked mercilessly. He had always been one for rough play, but never one to push it onto his partners, and the pool in Draco’s stomach grew quicker than ever. He clasped his hands around the pillow
“Pansy’s right,” Draco said, making the brunette’s eyes snap to him instead. “Snape’s trying to make sure nothing happens to Potter.”
Malfoy’s got detention! I could sing!”) and at last, while meeting her eyes, “You’re gonna forget the Cloak on top of the tower and get caught by Filch.”
Draco put his hands on his hips, leaning forward slightly and lowering his voice to a menacing whisper. “Otherwise
This is the last chapter of the first part of Destinia. I will take a few months off before continuing with the series (don’t know a specific date), and then I’ll start publishing the second part of Destinia. To stay updated, you can subscribe/bookmark the Destinia series on my account.
Harry almost choked on his egg. “She’s still asleep,” he told him dismissively. “She looked like she needed it.” Ron nodded, smiling.
Aria held a hand out, waiting patiently as the red-headed veela sitting to her left handed her a thick white folder. Smirking, Aria turned her attention back to Rita Skeeter as she flipped the folder open, scanning lazily through its contents.
The former Hufflepuff had turned into a complete, shaking bundle of nerves the minute their team had flown out onto the quidditch pitch at the start of the match. He kept fumbling nearly every time Draco or Austin tossed him the quaffle and once, in his blind panic, the bloody idiot even managed to accidentally toss the quaffle to Goldstein, one of Gryffindor's Chasers.
, the decision is up to Corey here. If he wants to play, then you should let him play. Besides, if he and Aria have been flying for weeks now and there hasn't been any negative impact on him, then don't you think it's fine? I mean, if his healer did say it would be safe, then there should be no reason to worry." He reasoned calmly.
To her frustration, Blaise didn't look at all intimidated by the hostile expression on her face. He merely blinked and smirked knowingly at her, shaking his head in mock disapproval.
hurry back." He warned, giving them a wide, saccharine smile that betrayed the chilly look in his eyes. "You wouldn't want McGonagall hearing all about how you almost attacked the savior of the wizarding world, would you? Maybe I should dock off points for that too. You
Parkinson." Aria began slowly, raising her hands up at both Neville and Pansy in a gesture of surrender before another fight escalated between the two of them.
He was halfway to the exit of the library when a familiar voice suddenly started calling out to him, causing Madam Pince (as well as a few other students studying near the entrance) to look up and silence them with a sharp, admonishing glare. Fighting the childish urge to shoot the students a haughty glare back, Draco looked up and sighed in mild exasperation when he saw a grinning Corey hurrying across the library towards him. The younger Slytherin stopped when he reached him, and Draco couldn't help meeting his sheepish smile with a wry look.
actually." Blaise admitted, shrugging. "But I took the train back to Hogsmeade this morning and walked back to school."
"I gather Pansy doesn't know that you're interested in joining the quidditch team?" Draco asked wryly.
She giggled at his aghast expression and went on as though he hadn't spoken. "I understand, you know. Like I said, it's okay. If I had to lose to another girl, it may as well be Harriah Potter. And believe me, you have
" He growled loudly, causing the said Gryffindor to flinch at the anger in his voice. "Didn't I specifically tell you
It took a few seconds but Potter eventually jerked awake at his nearness and sat up, blinking blearily up at him through her thick-framed glasses.
"That's enough, Corey." Pansy cut him off again as she reached down and grabbed him by his collar, turning him around to face her. "Anyway, it's like I told you. Potter here has agreed to give you DADA lessons every Saturday. At least until your grades pick up. Use the time wisely, okay? And don't be afraid to ask her questions, she's the best at DADA in our year."
then, right? Because we're the good-for-nothing lot who chose to side with the Dark Lord?!" She shot back, the anger in her voice causing Neville to blink at her in disbelief.
can't be a Slytherin." Ron croaked out even before Aria could even say anything, shaking his head frantically in denial.
He was a little surprised when she didn't hesitate and began untying all of her hair in front of him (though that was probably because she knew he was resistant to her allure). After yanking her hair-tie off and bending her head down towards the ground, she untwisted all of her long, dark strands out and allowed them to hang from the back of her head like a long, shiny black curtain.
Aria in a high-pitched, chipmunk voice, her eyes widened and she immediately clamped her hands over her mouth, glaring furiously at her two best friends as they burst out into hysterical giggles. Pretty soon,
"Wait a minute." Aria suddenly realized something and she paused, glancing curiously at Blaise, Zach and Neville. "My hair is down right now and I'm in my true form. Why aren't any of you—"
She winked, causing Pansy to flush darker and give her another scathing glare before she huffed and stomped back over to Neville, swatting him on the head when he continued to stifle his snickers behind his hand.
She smiled and gave his hand another squeeze in reply before she straightened, her eyes flicking over his shoulder towards the exit.
"Well no, but—" Pansy hesitated. "—to be honest, I just thought that all Gryffindor boys have this annoying tendency to be nice all the time." She admitted, biting her lip and giving him a slightly sheepish look.
"You think I give a shit about what that bint, or anyone else, thinks?" Aria retorted, narrowing her eyes at his hunched shoulders. "This is
"If that's what you want, I won't stop you." She whispered back, closing her eyes and sighing when his lips began to travel down her neck to her shoulder. "Veela skin doesn't scar anyway."
She giggled at his deadpan expression and folded her hands coyly behind her, tilting her head up so she could look into his eyes. "But really, thank you for meeting with me tonight, Draco. And thank you for being so honest with me. It was…
The room was also quite spacious, the floors lined with soft, gray carpet, and much like the living room, three of the room's four walls were made entirely of tall glass windows, all of which were partially covered by long, sheer white curtains.
much so. Trust me, I've known exactly how much you despise me since the start of the year! It's not something you have to keep rubbing in my face!" She snapped.
at that because instead of answering her, Draco mumbled something under his breath about going back to his dorm room before he jumped to his feet and snatched his things, storming out of the Great Hall as fast as he could.
And for the first time since Sirius died, since the war happened and she lost so many of the people she loved and cared about, Aria felt the walls she had so carefully built around her heart slowly begin crumbling down, every little piece breaking away bit by bit, until her eyes began to sting and those three, little words finally found their way to her lips.
a Care of Magical Creatures class. That is to say, the different lecturers you will be meeting in this classroom over the next few months
"For what you did for my brother, obviously." Pansy gave her an annoyed look and rolled her eyes in exasperation. "If it wasn't for you, and if you hadn't stepped in the way you did that day, Corey would have been expelled and punished for something he didn't do."
As soon as it was gone, Aria jumped to her feet and rushed forward, slamming the windows shut. When she turned around, she noticed that Pansy was staring at her with wide eyes.
Aria's eyes had gone wide at his reaction and she took a cautious step backwards from him, her hand instinctively reaching for her wand in her pocket.
"So what do you say? I'll save you a seat for tomorrow night?" He asked again, giving her a cajoling grin.
me and my family. So I think you can relax about her cursing you in your sleep." He snapped in a low hiss.
Instead, she shrugged and answered Rita Skeeter's question with a small, knowing smile. "If there's one
"Merlin, they never give up, do they?" Aria sighed and shook her head to herself in exasperation. "Who's the bloody wanker who tried to drug me this time?"
And speaking of classes, she'd definitely be lying if she said she didn't miss having Hermione beside her during long, boring lectures.
He ignored her protests and accidentally crashed into her, causing them both to stumble and end up crashing into their cauldron, spilling the remains of their potion all over themselves as they tumbled to the floor. Obviously startled by all the ruckus, the tarantula became frantic and hurriedly scurried away – crawling down Greg's back – and up onto Aria's leg.

students (including Blaise and Greg), who were subconsciously glancing at her every few minutes. They would blink, stare at Potter with a dazed, faraway expression for several seconds, before shaking their head and turning away as though snapping out of a semi-trance.
Granger raised her hand again, and the seriousness of her voice caused the rest of the class to look up.
When Ron simply relapsed into another stunned, uncomfortable silence, Hermione finally snapped out of her own stupor and let out a long, exasperated sigh.
"No, of course not. She'd never allow me to, she's too worried all the time." Corey admitted glumly.
Brushing the thought aside, Draco cursed inwardly and found himself calling out to her again against his better judgement.
come from him, suddenly popped into his head and he was startled when he felt a powerful wave of lust jolt right through him, shooting all the way down to his crotch.
Aria and Hannah were seated together on one of the couches near the entrance, both cramming the required readings for their next class while Zach and Neville were sitting on the carpet close to the fire and playing a game of exploding snap. Morag was seated on the couch beside Blaise and was quietly proofreading her assignments for the day. Not surprisingly, Pansy, chose to sit
With a growl, Aria shoved him away and jumped off the counter, furiously trying to fix her disheveled hair back up as she stalked towards the doors. Laughing, Draco rushed after her and grabbed her wrist to prevent her from walking away.
Thankfully, the house-elves were more than accommodating when they got there and after conferring briefly with them on how they could help out, Aria set off to work with washing the piles of dirty dishes on the counters while Blaise situated himself on the other end of the room to dry and store the plates.
"I'm being serious right now, Potter." Draco looked annoyed at her reaction, sighing again before he turned to face her fully. "Look, all I'm trying to say is…If you…Well, if you're angry about what happened back there and you'd rather that things between us stay the way they are, then I'll understand." He broke himself off and Aria's eyes softened when she saw the insecure expression on his face.
Blaise, he was there in the common room with us when Slughorn and McGonagall came storming in. He looked just as confused as the rest of us about what happened—"
Draco blinked and followed her gaze to the thick, platinum band on his left middle finger. "It's actually a
"I'm Draco, by the way. Draco Malfoy." He waited until she turned around and looked up at him before extending his hand towards her.
"Of course I will." Aria assured her, giggling when she noticed the excitement and giddiness that continued to linger in Hermione's brown eyes. "And seriously? I'm really happy for the both of you. You both deserve this after everything that's happened. So just…enjoy yourselves and try not to worry so much about the future tonight, okay? You should go find a nice hotel and have a celebratory shag or something."
; nowhere near as chaste or innocent as the lovesick, pining emotions that often floated around in his head whenever he was around Aria in school.
"Is that a muggle cellphone?" Across the table, Andromeda looked up from her plate and watched as Aria fiddled with the strange contraption. "
Aria broke their kiss and threw her head back, allowing her endlessly long hair to spill over to the floor. Draco obliged by leaning forward, kissing and tracing his tongue very lightly over the curve of her neck, all the way down until he reached her breasts again. Her fingers buried themselves into his hair, tugging on the blond strands as he took one nipple into his mouth, sucking softly while he used his fingers to play with the other one, tweaking and caressing lazily until it hardened and pressed up against his palm.
Frowning, she looked up and glanced across the room at Pansy in question. When Pansy just shrugged back at her, and Hannah slammed the bathroom doors shut, Aria sighed in exasperation and turned to give her two confused best friends an apologetic look.
"Because you don't want a mate?" Draco interrupted quietly, looking at her again and meeting her eyes with a weary, defeated look. "Or maybe because you don't want
"Wait, let me lower the flames first." Greg warned her, reaching for his wand and using it to weaken the fire underneath their cauldron. When the flames retreated and potion's bubbling surface began to calm, he turned to her and nodded.
Pansy rolled her eyes and opened her mouth to berate her even further but that was when Hannah suddenly sat up on the bed. She sniffed a couple of times and reached up, using the back of her hands to wipe the tears away from her cheeks. When she finally lifted her chin and met their eyes, Aria was surprised when she realized that a small, amused smile was tugging on the corner of her lips.
Without meaning to, Aria frowned and her eyes automatically flicked over to Pansy, immediately causing the other Slytherin girl to stiffen and glare back at her with a defiant expression on her face.
that they're forcing you to be in Slytherin this year." Bentley went on, scowling in distaste as his gaze dropped down to stare resentfully at Aria's uniform. "Personally, I feel affronted for you. I mean, how dare they tarnish the savior of the wizarding world by making her associate with those Slytherin lowlifes?" He raged, slamming his fist against the table and causing Aria to jump slightly.
Instead of answering, the petulant scowl on Aria's face darkened and she turned to glare accusingly at Blaise.
Instead, he frowned and seemed to stare uncomfortably at something over her shoulder. Aria followed his gaze and, when she noticed the growing crowd of curious onlookers that had gathered around them, she let out a frustrated curse under her breath. From the notebooks and cameras in their hands, Aria realized that they were the same reporters from her press conference and that they probably tailed her when she chased after Draco following her hasty exit.
Aria looked annoyed at that but just as she was about to head to the exit of the pub, Draco sighed again and called her back.
Bloody hell, will you both just stop it and let me down?!" She cut herself off in the middle of her sentence and glared at them.
With a sigh, he knelt down and began perusing the dusty books along the shelves again, starting from the very bottom partition. He was just in the middle of going through the books on the topmost shelf when the soft sound of someone clearing her throat drew his attention, causing him to pause and look up.
"Can you really feel me like this, even when I'm not actually touching you?" He asked quietly, flicking his curious gaze back up to meet hers.
When Aria managed to regain control of her breathing a few minutes later, she gave him a sheepish smile and they both chuckled as they took in each other's ruffled appearance.
Neville raised his hand and Draco had to force himself to look up when Fleur called on him, still haunted by the image of a veela's wings (if he was being honest with himself, it was
teach you this. Five points from Ravenclaw for your callousness!" Fleur answered him in a cool, contemptuous voice, not even bothering to address Corner directly as she looked away, her delicate nose pointed high in the air. "Not only is it offensive to ask a veela such a thing, but seeing as it is also a very difficult spell to learn, there would be no point in teaching you the incantation anyway. It can only be spoken in ancient veelish – a language that even we younger veelas have difficulty learning, mind you." She snapped at him in a chastising tone of voice.
really. And like I said, not all veelas are fair-skinned. Although, if I am to be completely honest, our skin
"Malfoy." Ron's eyes flashed and he grew impatient as he sighed and gave Draco a pointed glare. "Look, I've got her. You can let go of her now, I'll take her to the hospital wing—"
"Anyway, I myself can walk into a room and immediately sense if any of the occupants are wizard or witch, muggle, werewolf, veela, mermaid, well...you get the picture."
A few seconds later, another Nimbus 2001 came flying all the way across the other side of the field towards them, and Aria grinned as she caught it easily in her hand. Draco waited until she offered the broom's handle out to Corey before he shrugged and rewarded the younger Slytherin with a knowing smirk.
"Oh, I definitely agree." He murmured, wrapping an arm around her waist. "In fact, I'm actually willing to recreate the scene right now." He pulled her closer and leaned down to nibble on her earlobe. Unfortunately, before he could do anything else, Aria suddenly twisted away from him, glancing at something on the other side of the room.
actually." Greg answered, shaking his head. "At least, not until Harriah Potter actually agreed to be my date." He added, giving her a wry smile.
Both Neville and Aria glanced cautiously around the Slytherin Common Room, oblivious to the throng of other Slytherins who were entering the common room behind them and heading up to their dormitories.
A few minutes later, as Greg busied himself with cleaning an empty bottle for their potion, Aria looked up and glanced around the classroom. She noted that most of their classmates (including Hermione, obviously) had already finished brewing their potions. When Aria glanced over her shoulder at Draco, she wasn't surprised to see him already packing up his things, his finished vial of un-matured veritaserum placed neatly on the table in front if him.
I don't know about the other houses, but I just came from Hufflepuff and it's insane. Trash, paint and muck
"Not that big of a deal?!" Aria screeched at him, glaring at the other Slytherin as though he was stupid. "Do you have
sorry." The anger on Aria's face melted away and she sighed, reaching up to pinch the bridge of her nose. "I didn't mean to go off on you like that, Hermione."
"Now hold on a minute, Pans." Neville looked uncertain as he flicked his gaze back and forth between Aria and Pansy. "I think that's a little unfair; Aria has nothing to do with this incident. You can't just ask her to do something like that—"
As in Blaise Zabini?" Ron blinked at her in surprise. "You mean to tell me you're actually going to spend a night in Hogsmeade hanging out with him, Parkinson and
Draco's lips twitched with mirth as he watched Blaise pretending to clutch at his heart and give Morag a crushed, disappointed look.
even more of her smooth skin. A soft, satisfied hum escaped the back of his throat as Draco remembered reading about how extremely sensitive veelas were to touch. He began to wonder if it was
"Draco!" She blurted out, her eyes wide as she glanced over his shoulder at a small group of blushing first year students who were staring awkwardly at them as they passed. "What are you doing? We're in the middle of the hallway! Everyone can see us!"
"All I know is, it's not you." Blaise cheeked, snickering and giving him a consoling pat on the back.
As soon as they were gone, an amused voice to Aria's right suddenly spoke up, causing her to jump in surprise.
to make this all work though." She pointed out in an astute, irreverently blunt tone of voice that vaguely reminded Aria of a more ruthless version of Hermione.
"Ever since the war last year, the school board's become very strict about stuff like this. They want to prevent as much
Draco felt his left eye twitch with irritation at Blaise's words but instead of answering, he opted to keep his thoughts to himself and directed his gaze back to the scenery outside the train's windows.
He pressed her up against the wall, silencing her by leaning in and meeting her parted lips in a searing kiss. She growled and tried to push him off for a bit, but when Draco eased his tongue into her mouth, Aria immediately stopped struggling. Their tongues met, and she hummed in delight and arched up against him, linking her arms around his neck.
He calmly began to make his way to his usual compartment, and it didn't take him long to reach the Slytherin-occupied end of the train. When he got there and slid open the doors, the familiar sight of his friends – Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson and Greg Goyle — greeted him.
"And what exactly are you staring at, Malfoy?" Aria scoffed as she approached him, smiling when his hands automatically wrapped themselves around her waist.
at me, I just…I get all of these ridiculous, fluttering sensations in my stomach. When I'm with her, I forget every single shitty thing I've done in my life. She makes me feel like I'm actually
She flopped down into her usual spot on the Slytherin table and wordlessly began scooping some food onto her plate. The rest of her housemates did the same and soon, more students from the other houses began piling into the Great Hall.
"I said I'm fine!" Draco finally lost his patience with both of them and stood up sharply, glaring at the other two Slytherins in frustration. "Look, I just wanted some time to myself! You two didn't have to go all 'Hufflepuff' and come out here just to check up on me—"
Neither of them moved for awhile, both of them panting and struggling to catch their breaths, until Aria finally grumbled and gently began jerking her ass upwards to jostle Draco awake.
"Well, if you must know, I think it's ridiculous that you just had to be a veela on top of everything else." Pansy huffed at her, her eyes narrowing with disdain. "Like the scar wasn't enough? You need even
"I'm just stating the obvious, Parkinson." Aria rolled her eyes at the other girl before turning her attention back to the book on her lap.
"Professor." Granger's hand immediately shot up into the air. "We don't have a research assignment on veela." She pointed out.
Unfortunately, her little comment about her gown only seemed to make Greg stiffen and blush even more.
Her cheeks had regained a bit of color, and even though her wings were still heavily bandaged, the rest of the wounds on her face, arms and legs seemed to have already healed up, leaving her veela skin completely smooth and unblemished once more. Though, despite the fact that Aria was in her true form, her 'veela glow' was dimmer than usual, and Draco took that as a sign that her body was probably still recuperating from everything that happened.
Draco glanced down at the curriculum in front of him, silently reading along as McGonagall individually listed all of the topics they'd be covering for the remainder of the term.
Pansy's loud, obnoxious voice grated on his nerves as he grit his teeth and reluctantly followed her into the small classroom at the end of the east wing hallway.
"This is really delicious, Pansy." He told her, inadvertently causing the short-haired girl to redden in embarrassment before she scoffed at him and pointedly looked away.
I'm not going to give you tips on how to seduce your lazy sod of a boyfriend, Hannah! It's weird!" Pansy snapped at her again, flushing with horror and shaking her head. "Go bother Morag or Potter or something! I have better things to do with my time!"
of pretty girls in Paris, just so you know. So I agree, you should probably make your intentions known before he leaves." He snickered loudly, only to wince a few seconds later when Hannah kicked his shin under the table.
"I heard that a veela cannot fully control her allure. Isn't that dangerous? Not just for her but for everyone else around her?" Padma Patil mentioned with a slight frown.
She recognized one of them easily - the brown-haired, lanky one on the right was Bentley Fisher. Aria remembered him as the weird boy who had declared himself to be her fan and fawned all over her in the Great Hall the night before their first day of class.
Aria continued, staring off into empty space as though she had forgotten he was there. "Your mother was the one Voldemort sent to check up on me. When I woke up in her arms, I remember that the first thought I had was how gentle she was. It felt nice to wake up to a mother's touch for once." She blinked and glanced at him, giving him a strained smile that didn't reach her eyes.
She placed her hands on his chest to steady herself and immediately stilled her movements as her orgasm came rushing forward, coursing through her entire body and causing her to scream. She bent her head back and arched her spine backward, frantically flapping her wings high up into the air as she lost herself to wave after wave of mind-numbing pleasure. When it was over and the haziness in her mind slowly began to clear, she finally noticed that Draco's painful grip had slackened around her waist. She glanced down, noting that he was still coming down from his own post-orgasm high.
"I'll never understand you Slytherins." Ron snorted and, with a decidedly amused look on his face, he stood up and walked back over to sit by Hermione's bed. "I'm going to sit over here before you all infect me with your...
He wasn't surprised to see another front page article about Aria; especially since she was all the newspapers seemed to be able to talk about these days.
Aria gave him a rueful smile and shook her head. "Of course not. I could never sell that place. It's one of the few things I have left that remind me of my godfather."
time, even Pansy seemed interested in the conversation because the Slytherin had looked up from whatever it was she was arranging on her desk and cast a hooded gaze at Aria.
"I know." Neville shrugged and gave her a rueful grin when he saw her reaction. "Anyway, it didn't last long. Eventually, Smith stopped whining long enough for Zabini to befriend him and by the end of the night, he wasn't as annoying anymore. He even show me his card collection." He grinned at her.
"Of course! Of course, I'm so sorry for disturbing you! I'll let you get back to your meal and go sit with my friends." Bentley suddenly rushed out, looking deeply embarrassed as he shot up from his seat and bowed apologetically at Aria. She gave him another forced smile, which quickly turned into a grimace when Bentley leaned in one last time and, ignoring Ron's warning glare at him, whispered into her ear.
were you planning to tell me all this? You know how much I adore that lovely girl." Narcissa's eyes suddenly sparkled with delight. "And she's a veela too, I adore veelas. Think of how lovely my little veela grandchildren will be! Your great-great Aunt Dorea was a veela, you know. Well, I suppose that makes sense, Aria
Ignoring the curious looks Blaise and Pansy were giving him, he dug out a quill, a short roll of parchment from his bag, and quickly ducked over the table to write out his answer.
stubborn, Aria. You left me no choice!" He swiped at her arm again but Aria managed to evade him, wincing when the sharp movement brought another stab of pain to her injured wing and caused her to stumble to the floor. "I tried to make you see that Malfoy wasn't right for you — how none of these Slytherins were good for you! I tried to show you but you wouldn't listen, Aria!"
Aria." He gave her shoulder a reassuring squeeze before he stepped back, moving to stand behind Draco just before the blond looked up.
Thankfully, none of her teammates had finished yet so Aria hastened her steps and jogged lightly across the field toward the other end of the pitch. Just as she reached the exit, two figures entering through the stands suddenly caught her attention and she glanced toward them, frowning at the sight of two Gryffindor 7th year boys making their way towards her.
" He spat the word out as though it was a filthy curse word. "—joined the team out of her own volition. In other words,
drunk." Hannah slurred as she glared at him and clumsily tried to swipe her glass back. "I'm just a little dizzy, is all. Ugh, why is this room is so
"What?!" Draco rounded on him and snapped. "Are they insane?! That asshole has her name, what if he uses another Feather Curse against her?! What if he tries to cut off her wings again and forces her to mate with him?! Where is she now?!"
"So it's good old fashioned nepotism at work then? Don't worry, I understand more than you know." Draco mused, chuckling.
"Look, there's really no easy way for me to say this." Draco raked a hand through his hair, a self-deprecating smile tugging on the corner of his mouth. "Over the last few months, I actually came to realize that I may have...
"And everything will be perfect, sweetheart." Narcissa assured him, her lips twitching with fond amusement as she watched Draco squirm in his seat. "You've been planning this for
"So instead, you settle for being the most polite person on the planet?" Potter retorted with a snort.
"That's not a bad idea." Zabini snorted and actually looked a little intrigued at Neville's words. "Assign the task of waking up early to the fresh bloods. Sort of like an initiation of sorts." He chuckled at the thought.
"You realize I didn't want to do this, right?! I didn't want to take such drastic measures to make you understand but you were just so,
Draco immediately stiffened in surprise and turned around to find Blaise standing behind him, a small, wicked smirk tugging on the corner of his lips. When Draco just blinked and arched an eyebrow at him in confusion, Blaise grinned and spoke to him in a soft, mischievous whisper.
Draco hesitated for a few seconds before he sighed and placed the pile of books he held down onto the bench beside Corey. "I'll run down to the library and be back in three minutes. Can you watch over these for me?"
Aria sighed at that and she was just about to say something else when Corey suddenly cut them off when he landed directly in front of them, his hair all disheveled from the wind and a wide, ecstatic smile lighting up his face.
He wanted to say more, but Aria chose that moment to walk back into the restaurant from the connecting lobby; so he snapped the box shut and hastily shoved it into his robes just seconds before Aria sat back down into her seat beside him.
Aria flattened herself against her broom and sped off as fast as she could towards the brief glints of gold flashing occasionally at her from the many different areas of the quidditch pitch.
Aria sighed at their shrill voices and turned her attention back to Greg, glancing briefly at something over his shoulder. Then, slowly, her lips curled upwards into another mischievous smirk.
Aria was trying very hard not to let the heated blush on her face show as she averted her gaze from his, reaching up behind her to begin twisting her hair back into a loose braid.
They were in the middle of the dance floor, waltzing to Stubby Boardman's cover of one of Celestina Warbeck's most popular songs; when Aria accidentally tripped on the hem of her gown and ended up digging one of her heels into Greg's left foot.
They left the empty classroom together, both girls still heavily lost in thought as they retraced their steps back to the Slytherin Common Room. As they turned a corner and passed by the same corridor Aria had found Pansy arguing with Michael, she was startled out of her thoughts when Pansy suddenly spoke.
" Fisher protested in a shrill voice as he stopped behind them and directed his angry, seething glare at Draco. "I meant for that bludger to hit
Suddenly feeling absolutely frustrated with himself, Draco slammed the book shut and ran a hand through his hair, messing up the blond strands. Then, growling under his breath, he stood up from where he had sat down on the floor and angrily shoved the useless textbook back into its proper shelf.
Narcissa had taken to redesigning the entire manor, throwing out all of their furniture and repainting the walls of every single room. Not surprisingly, she avoided entering the formal dining room altogether, probably because she and Draco

in her lifetime. Once she does, all she can do is hope beyond all else that her chosen partner is willing to accept her." She said.
The silence that greeted her was oddly comforting; and she eventually sank down into one of the empty seats. Tucking her legs under her lap, she wrapped her arms around herself and stared down at the field with a contemplative look on her face.
He tried to gauge everyone's reactions for a few seconds before he nodded to himself and stood up, shoving his notes back into his bag and rearranging his things on the desk. "Before I dismiss you, the Headmistress did instruct me to remind you that your next essay assignment will be on elves next; and as usual, it is due before your next class." Wood smirked when he heard several grumbles echo around the small classroom.
"Somehow, that bit of information isn't making me feel any better." Neville muttered irritably under his breath.
She frowned, tilting her head to the side to give him a concerned look. "Is everything okay? Do you want to talk about it?"
She waited until everyone was huddled around her before swishing her wand once in the air in a quick circular movement.
Draco didn't answer her right away, pointedly choosing to ignore the sharp, warning glares he knew Blaise and Pansy were shooting the back of his head. When Astoria continued to stare expectantly at him, he eventually sighed and met her nervous gaze.
Draco lowered his gaze to the folded-up copy of the Daily Prophet that Blaise wordlessly handed to him. With a sigh, he set his cup down and took it, slowly unfolding the newspaper out in front of him.
Once the students from the other houses exited the stands, and after the Slytherins kicked out all the reporters and journalists hoping to get an interview with Aria, they set up a massive tent in the middle of the quidditch field. It should have been a bad idea, given the fact that it was still winter and all, but after Blaise and Pansy finished casting all of the necessary warming charms around the tent (Morag also set up a few impressive wards to keep out any nosy reporters), they barely felt the effects of having their post-quidditch celebration outdoors in the middle of the cold, snowy field.
around the moon, similar to this, then it is what we call a Vampire Moon. Werewolves are usually terrified to go out during this time, and for good reason. During a Vampire Moon, a vampire's powers and abilities are significantly amplified. In fact, we become almost thrice as strong."
"It gets worse." Hermione's gaze lowered and Aria noticed that she was trying very hard not to meet her eyes. "I didn't tell Headmistress McGonagall yet but I checked the records of the prefect schedules this morning. And as it turns out, I noticed that there were only
She ignored the way Bentley's eyes flashed in outrage at her words and smirked at him, watching as he took a nervous step away from her and cradled his injured hand to his chest. "All this talk about trust and me suspecting my housemates, I'm beginning to think you know something I don't. Is there something you want to tell me, Bentley?" She mused in a light, dangerously casual tone of voice.
Malfoy ignored the look on everyone's face as he strode calmly towards them and gracefully sat himself down into the last remaining vacant seat on the table – the one directly across Aria. He ignored the unwelcoming expression on Aria's face and turned to give Blaise an admonishing look.
"My books, Corey." Draco answered sharply, narrowing his eyes at his reaction. "Were you going through them? Because you should know that's rude. You're not supposed to snoop around in other people's stuff." He snapped, grabbing his notebook and immediately leafing through it to make sure the parchment containing Aria's veela name, along with all of his important notes on Ancient Veelish, were still intact.
They reached the train station at the other end of the village in a short amount of time, and eventually, they stopped in front of the entrance, turning to face each other with a warm, friendly smile.
Corey made a face at his question and shook his head. "She's still in the Common Room. I was bored so I wanted to go around the school for a bit but Pansy said I could only visit the library." He complained, earning a smirk from Draco.
As soon as Zach had announced that Slytherin had won the quidditch championship, Aria found herself immediately crushed right in the center of a group hug by
"Well, I did a bit of that extra research Delacour suggested in European Anthropology." Pansy told her, looking particularly smug.
"So you manifested last summer?" Draco finally gave in to the overwhelming urge to touch her and wrapped an arm around her waist, drawing her close against him so that her wings folded up as her back pressed against his chest.
I suppose. Especially after the horrible week I've been having. I really appreciate it." She admitted softly.
"Of course I can, Miss Granger." Madam Pomfrey answered her in an exasperated tone of voice. "But since she's unmated, it'll take a little bit longer for her wing to heal up properly. Had she been mated, I could have simply whipped up a special salve mixed with a drop of her mate's blood and that broken wing will have healed itself right up in a few hours." Madam Pomfrey said with a disapproving 'tsk'.
"Someone who models and calculates magical predictions using numbers." Morag explained with an impatient sigh, glaring at Aria as though she was the most ignorant person alive. "Honestly, Potter. You really are nothing but pure adrenaline on legs, aren't you? I do wonder how Granger was able to put up with you and Weasley for seven years." She drawled.
"It wasn't your fault, mate. That bludger came out of nowhere." Ron berated her firmly as he reluctantly stopped attempting to pull her from Draco's arms and glared poisonously at another approaching figure over Ginny's shoulder.
For a while, the room was filled with the incredibly lewd, wet sounds of flesh hitting flesh, intermingled with their vulgar moans as they fucked like two animals in heat, with Draco slamming himself frantically against her like a drunken sailor and Aria clawing at his back, urging him to go faster with her rapturous sighs and the filthy words she whispered into his ear.
I hope no one was offended by that part with Morag. If you read it correctly, I was actually lauding her character's sexual independence. :D
Draco swallowed the dry lump that had formed in his throat and let out a nervous laugh, pretending to busy himself with brushing away an imaginary speck of lint on his sleeve.
; and she felt a strange, magnetic pull from somewhere in the middle of the crowd. It called out to her veela blood, warm and soothing, drawing her towards it like a moth to a flame. She allowed herself to follow the pull for awhile, her eyes scouring through the sea of faces before her until she finally found herself staring at her mate's hooded figure behind a tall row of photographers.
Draco laughed at the exasperated tone of her voice, leaning back up and meeting her lips in another kiss. When they broke apart, he began lavishing the rest of her body with kisses, his hands roaming shamelessly over each of her curves, leaving bruises where he squeezed too hard or his fingernails dug into her skin.
concept. Did you know it actually originated from the idea that women were the property of men? It was mainly just a way to consolidate property between families and to treat the reproductive ability of women as another resource to be bartered."
"Poor kids." Ron added, frowning and shaking his head. "That sounds a bit extreme for something as juvenile as trashing the common rooms." He pointed out.
"Okay, Zach. I think you've had enough to drink." Aria was obviously trying hard not to laugh as she took the empty shot glass from Zach's hand and set it back down onto the table. "You drink any more of that nasty stuff and we'll have to carry out out of here in a stretcher." She teased.
When she looked uncomfortable at his reaction and tried to push him away again, Draco's eyes narrowed and his arms tightened around her, moving her into a more secure position against him. As she shifted in his arms, the skin of his cheek brushed gently against her forehead, causing her to gasp and Draco to swallow nervously at the way the skin-to-skin contact caused a spark of electricity to course through his entire body.
"…It's nothing like that. The war is over, remember? There are no more Death Eaters or traitors…There's only us, now. Gryffindors and Slytherin. Just
Aria didn't see her face at first, so she shrugged and was just about to resume her conversation with Ron and Hermione but when Hannah rushed past her, running towards the bathroom, Aria's eyes widened at the sight of the pig-tailed girl's tear-streaked, sobbing face.
Blaise made a face at her before he reached into the pocket of his robes and pulled out a silver flask.
Aria grumbled at his question and rolled her eyes. "Tiring as usual. I really just wanted to get out early and see you." She arched up on her toes and tilted her chin so that her lips were inches away from his; and Draco chuckled when he saw the familiar way her wings suddenly poked out from below her shoulders and fluttered happily at their closeness. "So...Congratulations. You are now officially acquitted of all charges. How does it feel?" She teased.
of a reason to attract everybody's attention? Merlin, why is there always something about you, Potter?" She scoffed.
"We're still setting a date." Hermione answered wryly as she pulled her hand away from Aria's and wrapped it tightly around Ron's arm. "And you're invited, by the way." She told him.
As Fleur fell silent and contemplated Morag's question, Draco looked up and inadvertently locked gazes with Aria across the classroom.
Draco stiffened, watching intently as one corner of Aria's lips gave a brief twitch that he wasn't quite sure how to interpret.
Coincidentally, Aria was also discharged from the hospital wing that week; so rather than endure an awkward week of avoiding her in the Slytherin Common Room, Draco decided to leave Hogwarts and spend the break in his flat in London instead.
3. Thank you so much to that one guest reviewer who pointed out my mistake about Harry's Firebolt! I looked it up and realized that it was destroyed in book 7 lol. I made the correction already so thanks again!
"And are you authorized to make that kind of decision for the rest of your housemates, Miss Potter?"
For her part, Aria finally seemed to have snapped out of her trance. Her eyes began to widen in horror as she stared at him – as though she herself hadn't anticipated her incredibly obscene reaction. She tore her gaze from his and looked away, her cheeks flushed heavily with embarrassment as she stared abashedly at a fixed point over his shoulder.
is a very serious request, Potter." She warned, looking alarmed. "One that I sincerely hope you can support, because it'll take a little bit more than the influence of the famous Girl-who-Lived to convince them to agree to something like that. The school board is comprised of a lot of influential people, after all. And you have already risked your reputation by testifying in defense of the Malfoys during the Death Eater trials. Are you certain you want to put your name on the line,
When she didn't reciprocate and simply stared back blankly at him, Blaise relented and offered her a sheepish smile. "Alright, I know it sounds horribly overdone and tacky but I just figured that since we'll all be spending an entire year together, now's the best time to get to know all of you – maybe make some useful connections in the future if I'm lucky." He added.
"Anyway." Neville shook the gentle expression away from his face and stood up again, slinging the strap of his bag over his shoulder. "I should go. I promised Professor Slughorn that I'd help him harvest some ingredients for a potion he's making."
Aria faked a cough at his words and nervously looked away, still squirming under his heated gaze. She managed to force out a strangled laugh and set her empty wine glass down onto the kitchen counter.
The. Team!" He released his grip on Fisher's robes and shoved him away, causing him to crash into the other members of the Gryffindor team behind him.
"Who knows?" Aria shrugged again, crossing her arms over her chest and leaning against the dungeon wall behind her.
She ignored the rushing of blood into her cheeks and trudged grumpily across the empty room towards the lockers. Unfortunately, only a thin wooden partition separated her from the boys' changing area, so she was forced to endure hearing all of the boyish, dirty jokes and loud, boisterous laughter of her teammates as she opened one of the lockers and shoved her bag inside.
"Do I really have to rehash everything I just told Corner?" Aria growled, narrowing her eyes at the other girl. "It'll probably be much easier to push for an expulsion in your case, the Ministry already has a record on
FYI, I'm posting this chapter earlier than usual because I'll be going somewhere without any internet connection for work this week and I'm not sure yet when I'll get back. Thanks for the love! :D
And since those three happened only to be Draco Malfoy, Blaise Zabini, and apparently, her new teammate Austin Flint, she was beginning to suspect she had a certain…
are, huh?" Blaise grinned knowingly at her, amused at the way she was squirming uncomfortably in her seat. "Don't worry about it, I'm sure Macmillan will pop your cherry soon. Do you want me to talk to him and maybe drop him some hints—
Aria smiled back apologetically at her before she stood up, ruffling Teddy's hair playfully as she passed his high chair on her way to the lobby of the restaurant. As soon as Aria was gone (and after making completely sure that she was too far away to hear them), Draco immediately turned to Narcissa and gave her an expectant look.
"An occupation that specializes in Charms, then?" Aria swallowed the lump in her throat and before she knew it, she began to ramble. "I noticed you're one of the top students in that class. Speaking of class, how are you with your NEWT preparations by the way? Is there any subject you still need to brush up on—"
"Where's Aria?!" Draco immediately blurted out. He sat up again and stared in dismay at all of the dried blood on his hands and along the floor. "Is she hurt?! Did that bastard manage to cut off her wings?!"
"Actually, I think I'm going to take off too. I think I'll brush up on some notes before our next class." Neville didn't bother meeting the questioning look Aria gave him as he stood up, a foul expression on his face as he began gathering his things.
The uncertainty in Greg's voice caused Aria to look up from her Potions textbook, waiting until he walked back over to her and showed her the crushed Sopophorous Beans in his mortar. Aria obliged him by leaning over his shoulder, peering into the mortar's contents.
The git was sporting an obnoxious smile on his face as he handed her the chore assignments for that evening, cheerfully pointing out that she would be cleaning classrooms in the fifth floor of the school's west wing with none other than Pansy Parkinson.
" Corey was practically beside himself with glee as he immediately shot up from his seat and grabbed his wand. "Well, what are we waiting for? Let's finish the lesson already. What was that about the stunning spell again?" He demanded.
Aria flicked her gaze over to the green and silver sea of Slytherin supporters, her wide eyes already scouring through the crowd in obvious search of someone.
"This is...some place, Potter." He whistled, following her example as he shrugged off his coat and hung it beside hers inside the closet.
"Bloody hell, yes, we're doing this." At the sound of his amused chuckle, Aria arched an eyebrow and gave him a playful smile
"Seriously?" Draco sputtered as he reluctantly took the basket from Hagrid, holding it away from him as though it was the most disgusting thing he had ever held in his life. "We're supposed to go into the Forbidden Forest?! Is this a chore you regularly assign to
until finally, the need for air became much too urgent for either of them to ignore and they broke apart slowly, but not before she let out a breathless laugh and leaned in again, pressing another kiss against the corner of his lips. When Draco just blinked and stared back dumbly at her, his face still flushed and his eyes dazed with arousal, she smiled and reached up, caressing his cheek with her hand.
"I remember exactly the kind of person you were even when we were children. I also remember exactly how you and the rest of your snotty little friends would make fun of kids like me behind my back, laughing at me and calling me an orphan because my parents were insane, calling me a squib because my magic showed up later than yours."
There was a small frown that marred Aria's features, and she looked strangely upset as she stared at him, still not saying anything. Finally, when the silence became unbearable for them both, she sighed and lifted their joined hands, pressing her lips against his fingers.
else, I shouldn't even be allowed to breathe the same air as you these days! Tell me the truth, Potter! Is that the real reason you're so terrified of touching me? Because I disgust you? Do you hate me that much?!" He challenged.
The smile on Aria's face dimmed a little as she shifted her gaze from Corey's flying form to Ginny, watching as the redheaded girl took another graceful dive in the air. "How is Ginny, by the way? She's been really immersing herself in nothing but quidditch this year."
Blaise and Pansy shouted angrily at him, demanding to know what the hell he was doing but Draco ignored them and gripped his wand even tighter, closing his eyes and muttering a complicated incantation over and over again until a small, circular formation of water began to form. The water eventually formed itself into a magical, protective barrier around them and Draco motioned impatiently for Blaise and Pansy to follow him as they stepped into the fiendfyre and made their way across it towards the doors.
Aria didn't laugh at Hannah's quip, nor was she smiling as she felt another unsettling, prickling sensation at the back of her neck. Slowly, she looked up, instantly meeting Bentley's wide, gleaming blue eyes from across the hall.
"Were you trying to test me?!" Draco demanded, walking over to her so that he towered over her seated form on the hospital bed. "Was it all a way for you to check if I was 'worthy' enough for you?! Is that why you decided to keep your identity a secret from me for so long?!" He seethed.
"I must go back to my herd now." He told them, glancing over his shoulder one last time to give Aria another deeply respectful nod. "It was an honor seeing you again, Harriah Potter. I look forward to hearing more of the many great feats you will undoubtedly accomplish in your lifetime."
Her gaze involuntarily drifted over across the table to where Malfoy had been quiet the whole time and was calmly sipping his drink. When he noticed her staring at him, his expression immediately soured and Blaise nearly choked on his drink as a barely suppressed snort of laughter caught in his throat.
Normally, Draco would have said no – if only because he couldn't care less whether these two hexed each other's eyeballs out – but when he saw the panicked, slightly pleading expression Pansy was giving him, he rolled his eyes and reluctantly stood up, gathering his things.
“I mean yes I guess I am, I'm also scared shitless. Last time I thought anything was like three years ago, i did a course on extraction, And before that it was the D.A, and now i’d of house and supposed to teach defense again, it’s scary as shit” he may have spoken a little too loudly, because McGonagall’s voice shot out
They both met with Narcissa at the three broomsticks, and it went about as well as you’d expect, she spent the first 15 minutes just fussing over Malfoy, was he eating enough, was he eating good, how was the new semester, all that mum stuff and Harry was sat there feeling more and more left out by the question, not because of Narcissa and that she was focusing on her son. But because she was a mother, caring about her child, Harry could see the love in Narcissa eyes and Harry couldn’t help but feel like this is what he missed out on, just being loved and having this person that loves you unconditionally, but when Narcissa was one fretting and Harry was done feeling sorry for himself, Narcissa started talking to Harry like they’d been friends forever,asking about hogwarts and what he’d been doing, seemed careful not to bring up the war or Harry’s career as an auror, which he appreciated. after an hour of small talk they finally breached the topic they had met up for, Narcissa didn’t have much other than Rookwood’s wife had left shortly before their daughter began hogwarts and he was mainly seen at the pub since then, there had been some concerns in the area for the daughter but there was no concrete proof, Narcissa seemed to think it was one of those situations where everyone just knew, even without proof. Neither Malfo nor Harry seemed to be too thrilled at the no proof part, they had agreed not to talk to Rose without it. They had been with Narcissa for two and a half hours, Harry not talking much, just letting Malfoy and his mother catch up a bit, Narcissa left by floo which left Harry and Malfoy standing awkwardly outside, not sure how to say goodbye. They didn’t talk outside of Harry’s office and that just ended with Malfoy being overly formal and then leaving the room and that was that, this time they were stood in silence unsure of how to move forward, Harry ended up being the one to break the silence with a quick goodbye and then he hurried off towards Ron and Hermione’s cottage.
“You’re right,i haven’t and i’m sorry… so what have you been up too these past days, you’ve had the castle almost to yourself” Harry got up and picked Apollo off the stick and placed him on the desk
“Uhhh can i uhh - can i help you?” Harry almost had to pick his jaw up from the floor, because the proud and slightly pompous Malfoy was fidgeting and couldn't keep his eyes at point,
“I miss back when we lived in the dusty place and you never woke me back then” Apollo complained, Harry chuckled and opened his eyes, The light from the window coated the room is a warm yellow light, it was that time of the morning where you still hadn’t realized you had responsibilities and stuff to do, the room smelled of warmth,
“Hey no, what triggered you? Is there anything i can do? anything i can get you?” Harry asked, deciding to ignore the even you comment. That could  wait till later. malfoy was shaking his head, uncharacteristically aggressive.
Harry sat next to Neville and immediately looked to the gryffindor table, a lot of the weasleys had kids now, in 9 years or so this hall would be swimming in gingers dressed in scarlet. McGonagall got up, the sorting was about to begin. It went pretty much the same as all the times he’d seen Dumbledore do this at the start of each year, a short speech about Hogwarts and the coming year as well as some ground rules, she introduced Harry as the new Defence teacher and the students either started clapping or whispering. The hat was then brought out and sang his ever so lovely song and then it was time.
“of course, is something on your mind?” Harry was just about to go into detail about Sophia Rose and his conversation and how he felt she had been holding something back, when a knock sounded on his door, “one second buddy” Harry got up to open the door, expecting to see a student with a question or maybe even McGonagall here to follow up on their talk from earlier, who he was not expecting to see was Draco Malfoy.
“Helping me with this whole thing, I just mean, I’m confused, you’ve changed obviously but it’s still weird seeing you working so hard with ulterior motives” Harry said, palms sweaty, scared he’d just ruined his one shot at befriending his old rival.
“Oh right yes, mother responded, she says that she’s been asking around and would prefer to meet in person to discuss what she heard which doesn’t really sound good so i suppose our suspicions were correct, she wants to know if we’d be free to meet at the three broomsticks this saturday at noon?” Malfoy explained
“hey, is this better?... Malfoy?” Malfoy looked almost broke, almost childlike, and Harry couldn’t help the overwhelming need to protect him,he couldn’t protect Malfoy when they were at school, he could sure as hell do it now.
“I’ll ask Apollo to keep his distance” was all Harry could trust himself today, Malfoy just nodded in what Harry would guess was appreciation. They were both silent for a while, they had migrated to Harry’s bed, sitting side by side, if he leaned over just a little their shoulder would be touching, Harry quickly buried that thought, or why it made his chest tighten a little, other than that it felt oddly nice to just sit in each others precedence,
“Right thanks”  The rest of the walk was uneventful, no daydreams and no close calls with trees, only the faint feel of body heat next to him and the very clear feeling of red warmth on his face and nervous sweat on his hands.
“No, we agreed on this, leave her alone” Malfoy responded, clearly annoyed to be having this conversation again.
Thanks for reading this :) This is the first thing i've actually decided to write, anything else i've written has always been a one off, but this i keep coming back to so that's hopefully something.
“Ok so Apollo may have said that he didn’t wanna leave you because your smelled nice”  the longer harry talked the quieter he got, hoping Malfoy had missed the last part and that he didn’t care, obviously the universe was against Harry yet again because the Malfoy had heard every word and now a smirk (that Harry was not welcoming) was spreading on Malfoys lips.
Malfoy had a funny look when he talked about his mum, if Harry didn’t know any better he’d say it was pride. During school he rarely ever mentioned his mother,which had found strange, seeming how often he liked to name drop his dad. Harry couldn’t remember much about Narcissa Malfoy other than she was related to Sirius, Andromeda and Bellatrix, one which didn’t bode as well, and that he owed her his life.
“And then I can imagine all the horror scenarios I want?” Harry said, a slight tinge of amusement in his voice. Hanging out with Malfoy didn’t exactly provide the best circumstances for comedy, he probably thought Harry was boring,
“you know, life at the Dursleys was hell too, i get it. For eleven years i was a slave, i cooked for them but wasn’t allowed to eat any of it, they fed me scraps or whatever was burnt, i lived in a small cupboard under the stairs and my only clothes whatever clothes my cousin,who was 3 times my size by the way, had ruined. So that’s why i’m doing this, i don’t care what your reasons are, as long as you’re committed to it, and i know Ron was wrong”  Harry said, strangely enough, not feeling like shit, like he did whenever he shared his life before Hogwarts with any of his friends, but then again he and Malfoy weren’t friends.
“Oh, sorry I can come back later” he was about to turn around and walk back out when Harry stood up,
“I don’t know what to say” Malfoy sat down on a bench, elbows on his knees and his hands covering the bottom of his face, Harry couldn’t help but notice how elegant his hands looked, long slender and pale fingers “fuck ok, you met my dad, you knao what he’s like, i lived with him and his crushing exspectiations for 17 years, i also lived with the consequences of not meeting those expectations. It was hell, but I had my mother, she did her best to keep me safe so when the time came i-...sorry that’s, you don’t need to know that. Just I know what it feels like to not feel safe in your own home” Malfoy explained, Harry didn’t know what to do or say, what did you do when your old rival now almost friend confides in you?
The rest of the day went by in a haze, he could barely pay attention to Neville's rambling at supper, probably something about some plant or a student's affinity for herbology. His mind filled with worries for the young girl, what did one do in this situation, he just needed someone to talk to about this, just out with all his worries, Harry quickly excused himself and hurried back to his quarters, Apollo was the only one he could truly talk to about anything.
“What can i do for you guys?” Harry asked from behind his desk, smiling up at them, a splotch of yellow dangling from a stick out in his peripheral. Berkins stood forward, “Well sir, Those chapters you asked us to read for next Wednesday, we well, we on the hufflepuff team might have some trouble, we’re up in the first match this thursday and it’s our captains last year so he’s kinda gone mad with training, really wants to win the cup his last year here and such…” Berkins explained, the two behind her were fidgeting, waiting for her to finish. Pearce with his robe and Gardner with her hair.
“What about Miss Rose?” Harry wasn’t sure if McGonagall was expecting him to badmouth the student, her expression had changed, almost as if she was warning him to tread lightly.
“So we just write to her asking if she knows anything about the Rookwoods?” Harry felt sceptical, but it was the only option they had so far so Harry went along with it
“Do you ever wonder which professor you are?” Malfoy said lightly, like it was a thought that slipped out, never meaning to be heard, Harry looked over but Malfoy wasn’t looking at him, he was staring at Harry’s blank walls like they held the secret to the universe.
“what? no i’m fine, i just need to get some food i’ll be fine” which was just a bold faced lie, the man could not stand still, he was swaying from side to side like a drunken sailor, but Harr was not in a position where his opinion would change Malfoys. The least he could do was to walk him to the great hall, he had to make sure the other didn’t faint on the stairs and crack open his skull, now that would be a horrible way to start the school year.
“Yes i hope so, well maybe I’m not quite sure actually - can i come inside?” he motioned to the chairs Harry had set up in front of his desk for students.
“what if, if we worked together” Harry's voice was barely above a whisper, regretting it as soon as he’d said it.
They bought it 2 years post hogwarts, saved like hell and ended up with a quaint cottage just outside hogsmeade, it wasn’t much but like the burrow the place was overflowing with warmth and the feel of home, like if the burrow and an old library had had a weird 2 story 3 bedroom stone cottage as a baby.
“So, what did you need my help with” Harry was tracing the rim of his mug, waiting for his over sugared tea to cool down and also just needing to do something with his hands.
“I can’t hate you” was all Harry managed to get out, because he couldn’t, he wasn’t even sure if he did back in school. Malfoy was a troubled kid, even if Harry wasn’t sure of it back then, Harry always knew there was something about him, just something. Now he almost felt like a completely different person, he made jokes, he cared about the students even if he showed it in a weird way or not at all. He cared, he laughed and smiled and he made Harry feel… something, something amazing, something free, something happy.
Malfoy nodded, looking off into space like nothing in his life made sense anymore, he quickly shook out it, going back to his usual careful expression,
“I mean sure? we’re grown ups now, we don’t have to continue the the dumb rivalry from when we were kids” Harry shrugged.
“you, what’s your name?” her face turned the same shade of red as her hair, maybe not expecting to be called on first.
“Sure Potter, after we meet my mother you can imagine anything you want” Malfoy sighed, but he smiled a little, it was nice.
“you’re Harry Potter, The Harry Potter” a young boy with flat light brown hair and a hufflepuff tie called out. Harry was used to it,he had to be but i didn’t make it any less annoying.
“Would you stop? this is hardly your fault i never told  you i didn’t like snakes so this is hardly your fault” Malfoy said, pulling Harry out of his shame spiral, Ok ok, Harry couldn’t have known so what now, Well first calm down, He’s no good to anyone  if he’s panicking too, ok calm, next, talk to Malfoy and figure out he needs and then have a stern talking to to Apollo that he is to stay away from Malfoy no matter how interesting he smells.
“I had to see McGonagall about some ingredients for next week, i noticed i'm almost out of bat spleens and the second years are brewing swelling solutions the day after tomorrow” Harry grimaced remembering when he’d have to brew it, potions was never his strong suit and it didn’t help he always had Snape breathing down his neck waiting for any opportunity to take points from gryffindor.
“What was umm, what was he saying” Draco’s voice was barely above a whisper “I just told him he had to come over to me and that he couldn’t crawl onto strangers shoulders no matter goo-ummm nothing, it’s nothing” Harry really had to stop rambling just because of his bloody snake. Draco clearly caught onto Harry’s almost slip up.
“Could i get you some tea?” Harry was very unsure of what to do with himself, what was the proper etiquette for when your former rival now coworker showed up at your door at 7pm?
“Yes, the blonde man. He has many books and smells in his room, no sticks though… our room is better” Harry just chuckled at that, a direct passage from here to Malfoy, could’ve used that when he was in school.
Malfoy muttered a quick “right” and then took the notes and hurried down the hall, Harry figured if they’d been back at school he’d have purposefully bellowed his robes after him, but alas no robes this time. It was lunchtime before He knew and there was still no Apollo, he was hoping Apollo had just found a nice warm alcove and was snuggled up like a little cinnamon roll, maybe even looking out a window.
“Oh he just wanted to ask if i had seen his hair lightening cream” Harry joked, and both boys seemed to find this amusing, accepting they weren’t gonna get a serious answer.
“What do you mean you prayed someone would notice?” Malfoy’s voice was small, like he was either scared of the question or the answer, he was looking down in his tea like the milky liquid held all his answers.
“The kind that would suggest she’s not being treated right at home” his back straightened, he was the teacher here to protect his student not some troublemaker so he was gonna take this seriously “the signs are there Minerva, I’m not saying her parents are hitting her but i wouldn’t be much of a teacher if i ignored this”
Malfoy just muttered a slight response before looking away, focusing on his meal, not really paying much attention to Harry or Apollo aside from the occasional glance, the rest of the meal.
“You mean the scar?” Everyone's faces turned towards the young girl with long blonde hair in the back, some looked terrified, she said it others relieved she said what they were thinking.
“You’re taking the piss right?” Ron laughed, Hermione looked quizzingly between Harry and her husband, Harry just shook his head, not finding the right words, Ron shot up out his chair, almost knocking his cup over in the process,
“If i wasn’t committed to this i highly doubt i’d spend my free time in the company of a snake and drinking out of a pink gryffindor cup, and what did the Weasley say that’s got you so worked up” Malfoy said, his hands were interlocked and between his knees, Harry laughed, he was kinda proud of making Malfoy attached to his frilliest mug.
“Yes Mister Dugal, I know there’s a snake around my neck” he poked Apollos head which was resting on his shoulder till the sleeping snake began to stir “I’m gonna have to move you ok? nono you don’t have to wake up” Harry put the dozing snake in the right top drawer, which had been made into a little nook for when Apollo was feeling particularly clingy and sleepy. The two boys were still standing by the door, Liam Dugal was rather short for his age and probably because of that he spiked his sandy blonde hair up, his best friend was Simon Adler, he was neither tall nor short just average which was coincidentally the perfect word to describe him, he had a mop of dark brown hair and was rather spindley he wasn’t the brightest boy but he got by he was just average, except for of course his immense talent at annoying the hell of out all his teachers.
“You still spy on him” Harry asked shocked Harry, who had kinda forgotten about Apollo’s definitely creeping probably morally wrong hobby, it was only his office though at least Apollo wasn’t spying in his bedroom. Apollo definitely had slytherin traits, he was a curious little thing and even if Harry told him he wasn’t allowed to do something he still would, he’d just be careful not to get caught, the little shit.
“Right..” Merlin this was awkward, how should one act in this situation? former rival now coworker, he was head of slytherin and harry of gryffindor so were they supposed to keep it up or be civil? friendly? surely McGonagall wasn't accepting them to be friends…right? the walk to the great hall was painfully awkward, neither saying anything other than ´are you ok?´ and ýes i’m fine´
“Can i ask you something?” He reached down and scooped Apollo up, laid him on his desk and sat down in his chair.
