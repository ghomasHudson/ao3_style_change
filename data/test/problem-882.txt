“Yes, of course.” Draco said politely as they walked through the doorway. Minerva let go of their arms to walk fully in the room.
Harry, as usual, served to both keep in suspense and disappoint. At first, the majority assumed Ginny Weasley would be wearing the colors of his team while Harry would wear her colors from her team. That was not to be, since they had never gotten back together after the war. They were just very good friends, practically family, with a friendly rivalry.
“Whatever you say, dear husband. I have an engagement party to plan for.” Narcissa said as she left the study.
“Where’s Blaise? The boys want to hear a story from him.” Draco said as he looked in Harry’s office. “Where is he?”
This chapter is a little late due to realizing I needed to wrap presents but I also wanted to finish my game but I also needed a shower.
After months of healing he was back in tip top shape. He had actually done his therapy faster than anticipated. His coach, team manager, and team healer put him through rigorous tests to make sure he was actually healed. It had felt like tryouts all over again but he passed with flying colors. He was scheduled to practice the week after but wouldn’t play in any games until the new season.
“Potter, this better not be a deep present because it’s been the longest short day of my life.” Draco said as he walked in the door looking haggard.
“Thanks for saying you’d help me get a date with him but I’m good on that.” Harry said. Ron’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.
“I finished early and I let the cook know not to leave food out for me.” Blaise said as he gazed down at Draco. Draco had his hand on the baby carriage, holding a little mittened hand in his own.
“Very well. I’m glad we came to an agreement.” Mrs. McGonagall stated as she stood up. Harry stood up as well but the chair came with him.
“Mrs. McGonagall, this is a place that is meant to garner peace for the people.” Harry pointed out. “Having your husband be the main focal point tells people ‘this is for the wealthy and well off.’”
Harry jumped a little when Draco sat up. Apparently he had dozed off. Draco just smiled at him and ran a hand through his hair making him hum happily. Draco stood up and walked over to grab his bag. He then walked over to the Black ring box and took his ring off making Harry jump up.
“Your mother knows and I only think one of my best friends knows just because she’s smart.” Harry said running his hands through his hair. “I don’t deserve you.”
“Goodnight Draco.” Blaise said sweetly. Draco stared at him for a few seconds smiling and then finally left, shutting the door behind him.
“I can’t believe you got this for me.” Draco said as they sat down to catch their breathes. The blond had cast a few floating light charms so they could see each other.
“Mind if I join you?” Blaise asked. He was at the local park outside the city, which was a winter wonderland. There were plenty of children out enjoying the day, judging from all the happy yelling and screaming.
All three of them started to say various forms of no thank you and tried to make their excuses. One stood up and Blaise blocked the walkway as he charmed them into joining him and Draco. They immediately started agreeing and walked over to the table Draco was sitting at. Two of them sat in the booth next to him on either side, while the third and Blaise took some chairs to sit at the table. Blaise took the liberty of ordering some alcohol for the committee members.
“Why yes. He’s like no mortal man. Who is he? What is he?” Remus asked setting the papers down and bringing his small kitchen chair to sit on across from Harry.
“Too bad. He’s such a nice fellow, if a little unorthodox. Of course it would take an angel to put me to work.” Remus said with a chuckle.
“I see Mrs. McGonagall has pledged quite a hefty sum but has not yet sent her check.” Blaise said waving the small index card around.
Thanks to Harry’s seeker reflexes he caught a small package before it landed in his scrambled eggs that an owl dropped in the morning mail rush. A letter with the distinct Gringotts wax seal was attached. Harry quickly pocketed the box and read the letter. He winced a little after reading it and then realized Ron and Hermione were staring at him. He handed the letter to Hermione as he stood up.
Ron threw it back at him and jumped when a loud thud resounded through the room. They both looked at the door as someone knocked. Harry canceled the spells.
Harry Potter was standing in the doorway of the informal dining room staring at Draco in awe. Draco looked at Scorpius in question as his son looked at him sheepishly. He then realized he was in his pajamas and house robe while they had a guest and gave Scorpius a different look.
“There must be.” Remus said. “You and Draco love each other. You always have. Even when you were picking fights before you got together.”
“Yes, exactly. An angel. Draco is a creature of earth. As are you.” Remus pointed out giving him a pointed look.
“I told you I’m not leaving the house. And I don’t trust a masseuse enough.” Draco said getting annoyed.
“Hello Professor.” Draco said cordially. He was still reserved with the older man since he had been so terrible to him in his college days. Thanks to his husband’s attachment to the man he was kinder. He didn’t feel he deserved the man’s easy forgiveness though.
Draco and Blaise were in the taxi that graciously waited for them. Draco was wearing his new jacket. They were heading back to the house.
“I’m telling you because I’m a terrible boyfriend.” Harry said. Before Hermione could reassure him he kept going. “Even though we’ve kept our relationship to ourselves he’s told his mother. His mother, Hermione! That’s like the step before meeting the parents. And I’ve told no one close to me. I mean, who does that? People who want to keep their relationship hidden due to it being a dirty little secret! I don’t want that! I want the opposite of that! I want to tell the whole world!”
“Yes really.” Harry said amused. He walked over and kissed the top of Al’s head getting an annoyed grumble. “You should probably get some rest. I’m assuming the Muggle way of healing is your punishment.”
“Anytime.” Potter said happily. Draco felt very awkward as the other man just sat there looking at him. He wasn’t sure what to do.
“Are you sure you’re an angel?” Harry asked suspiciously. He didn’t like the way the angel was looking at his husband.
“Be good or you won’t get your present.” Harry said. Draco looked thoughtful and then threw his leg over Harry’s while placing his hand on Harry’s thigh and squeezing.
“The man who composed that music was the only man I ever loved.” Mrs. McGonagall said with conviction. “We were engaged to be married but I got frightened. He had nothing and I was afraid of poverty. He went away... and I never saw him again. I never loved my late husband, but he was very much in love with me and he was wealthy. I spent a fortune honoring his memory on empty monuments.”
Harry just held him closer. The headmistress and the staff made it very clear that attendance for classes was not going to count towards their overall grade. Some days were harder than others and they didn’t want to add unnecessary pressure. Harry was glad for it considering he barely attended classes at the start of the year.
“Right. Yes.” Harry said burying his face in Draco’s chest. “I knew that.” He looked up into Draco’s eyes when his jaw was held.
As uncomfortable as a place like this would be for Harry, the appreciation and approval from his blond made it more bearable. Harry had decided to take Draco to the poshest, fanciest, and most exclusive restaurant wizarding England had to offer. He had wanted to take him to a posh, fancy, exclusive restaurant in France but they were stricter with their reservations. Also his name wasn’t as impressive over there.
“Oh? A palm reader as well. Do you tell the future?” Draco asked and held his hand palm up. Blaise delicately held his hand. One of the committee members turned to tell the others.
“He told all the other kids that we couldn’t play in the snowball fight because we couldn’t throw a snowball as far as he could spit.” Albus said.
“I don’t just want to nod hello at you in the halls or say a word or two in passing. I want to hug you and kiss you. I want to hold your hand while walking with you.” Harry said squeezing the hand he was still holding. He liked the happy smile starting to form on Draco’s face.
“Harry, I’m sorry but Mr. Shacklebot is on the line. He said it’s urgent.” A no nonsense looking woman said stepping out of a room across the hall.
“Blaise.” Minerva said as she turned to them. Draco smiled happily as he stepped closer to Minerva. Harry tensed up.
“Hm. Maybe Luna got it for her.” Draco said quietly. He then walked over to the bathroom. Harry quickly followed him in and shut the door behind them, taking Draco into his arms.
“I’ll be right back.” Lily said and disappeared. Narcissa waited patiently and smiled at the annoyed look on the red head’s face when she returned. “I can plead innocent for killing my husband for his annoyance, right?”
“Yes.” Harry said miserably. Draco canceled the ties around Harry, who immediately scrabbled up and wrapped his arms around him.
“No you won’t. Because when I’m gone you won’t remember a thing. You’ll never know an angel visited your house.” Blaise explained.
“The main article was stupid. There was a smaller article, well a paragraph, on one of the pages saying that you and Zabini are engaged.” Hermione explained.
“Hey. How did you know my name?” Neville the cabdriver asked as he looked in his rear view mirror at them.
“You will not! This is a celebration not a- what are you doing?” Narcissa asked as Lucius waved his wand. She heard a light yelp.
“Come now, Harry. We’re very old friends. You must call me Minerva.” She said as she looped her other arm through his and led them across the front hall to the East Drawing Room. Draco and Harry had flabbergasted looks on their faces as they walked with her.
“I make the bed. And I won’t mind paying.” Harry said. The blond rolled his eyes fondly as he headed over to the tree. He looked around.
“Yes. There are many things that has dear Abraxius rolling in his grave.” Narcissa said as she sat in her chair. It was the only comfortable chair in the study that Lucius conjured only for her. “Perhaps we should check the mausoleum for fractures at this point.”
“Okay! Now you get a spanking you cheeky prat!” Harry said as he squatted down and hauled the blond over his shoulder.
With that Draco hurried up the stairs without looking back at Harry. Harry stared up the stairs sadly and then ran a hand through his hair. He walked back into his office and saw Blaise looking through the money pledges.
If you’re not familiar with sable it’s a type of animal who’s fur is extremely valuable. Like starting price for a full sable coat is $55k. The species isn’t listed as endangered.
“I don’t think he’d enjoy seven swans and nine ladies dancing.” Harry said dryly. “I do kinda want to go opulent.” He clarified at the surprised looks. “But not like with various live birds and random people doing very specific actions.”
“Did you-“ Draco started but stopped when the host approached them. The blond snapped back into his pure blood self while Harry smiled at the man.
“Why would you think that?” Blaise asked. Harry gave him a look but handed him some money. When Blaise kept staring at him he gave him a little bit more.
“Well I was having a lovely weekend. So your experiment better be worth my worry.” Harry lightly scolded.
“Fine.” Lucius grouched and kissed Narcissa’s cheek as he let her go. “I’m letting Severus loose on them.” He opened the window slightly.
“How about we get some food?” Blaise said also watching James. He used a little angel magic to dry the worst of the moisture. James’ tense posture relaxed a little.
“Why’s that?” Draco asked, seemingly innocently except the dilated eyes gave him away. Harry just smirked and kissed his blond deeply.
Draco had a free period after Arithmancy so he was sitting in the Great Hall in study hall. He was going over his notes ignoring Blaise who had slipped in to sit next to him. He was a little stuck on a problem when Blaise spoke up.
“I know it’s a collectible but wanna go for a fly?” Harry asked hopefully. Draco’s attention snapped away from the broom as he looked at Harry wide eyed.
“Draco.” Blaise said. Draco immediately turned to look at him. “My work here is almost finished. I’ll have to be moving along.”
“Glad he did some good for some people. He’s brought nothing but disaster for me.” Harry said not even looking at Remus.
“Look,” Harry started feeling like the rugs been pulled out from under him. “You’ll have to phone my secretary to make an appointment. I’m in the middle of dinner-“
“What does it look like?” Draco asked a little annoyed at losing his train of thought and being called a nerd.
“No, but if it is what I think I’ll let you know by saying ‘I knew it.’” Ron said grinning at the annoyed look he got.
They pulled up to a very elegant mansion. Blaise got out of the car, letting Harry out. Harry looked back at Draco as he straightened his jacket out.
“We should head out, Draco.” Harry said as he walked over to the other man. He stared at the jacket that Draco was wearing. It was the new one he got when he was out with Blaise. “We have many people to see.”
“I know, it’s easy to forget.” Hermione teased while wiggling her wand. Harry gave her a sheepish smile.
“Oh hush you. You’re adding to the rolling.” Lucius said while throwing a weak glare at his loving wife. She just gave him a cool smirk that turned into a smile when she glanced out the window.
“I really can’t. I need to get home. I should...” Draco started but looked st Blaise. “Perhaps for a few minutes.”
“You were looking awfully smug.” Harry said as he lounged on the bed, waiting for Draco to come out of the bathroom.
“It’s fine. Wondered what had you so snippy but won’t press you ‘bout it.” Ron said as they entered the boy’s dorm. He watched Harry curiously when Harry checked the room and then locked and soundproofed the room.
“Such a charmer.” Draco said. “I think we’re squishing the tickets.” Harry lifted up and saw that the tickets had been trapped between them.
“Then what are you doing here?” Draco asked and caught a glimpse of the clock on the bedside table. “And at 7 in the morning?”
“It seems you have a gift under the tree.” Draco said with a smirk. “You should unwrap it and enjoy.”
“Alright. So you pick up the snow and back it tight.” Blaise made a snowball and handed it to Scorpius and then made one for Albus. They then stood up. “Then you aim at your target.”  Both boys aimed at James. “Then let it fly.” Both snowballs hit James squarely in the face.
“Depends on what you use it for.” Harry said. He handed Draco an unsealed envelope. Draco opened it and it took him a second to understand what he was looking at.
“I got held up. Where were you?” Harry asked barely responding to Draco’s embrace as he stared down Blaise.
“I’m sorry I’ve barely grasped the concept of you dating him so this will take awhile to sink in.” Ron said bringing a hand up to his head to rub his forehead in bewilderment.
“Honestly.” Narcissa said while rolling her eyes. She stood up to better look out the window. “You have seen our son, right?”
“What’s more, look at how much I’ve written. For 10 years I couldn’t write a single sentence and now? Now it’s as if every book I pick up yields new information.” Remus said brandishing a stack of papers enough to make a book with. “Do you know what this means?”
The next day, Draco came home and Harry was once more waiting for him. The blond looked at him questionably but accepted the welcome home kiss. They just stared at each other.
Harry had been shoveling food in his mouth and felt like squealing happily at Draco kissing him in public. Now he knew why girls acted the way they did. He settled for just smiling down at his plate. He looked up and Ron was giving him a smarmy look, seemingly knowing how Harry felt so Harry did the mature thing and flicked some food at Ron.
“Think of it as a countdown to Christmas. Are you saying you don’t want to open it?” Harry asked with a cheeky smile. Draco rolled his eyes as he picked the gift up.
“I don’t know how you do that elegantly. I think I look like a sack of potatoes.” Harry said as he went and got the presents from under the tree for Draco.
“I’ve heard good things about a place called Fleur’s. Heard of it?” Blaise asked. Draco got a dreamy look in his eyes.
“Yes.” Harry said frowning as he pulled Draco back down. He grunted at the weight but didn’t let go. Draco frowned back and tried to at least lay on the bed instead of on Harry.
“I am always “nice” and dignified.” Lucius said. “Unlike certain people.” He added. Narcissa rolled her eyes and headed to the door.
“Tell him he’ll call him back, Hermione.” Draco said firmly. She nodded and went back into the room. Draco shut the doors to drawing room. “What’s happened to us Harry?”
“Your father did it to me.” Lucius said. Narcissa’s glare disappeared as she remembered and smiled at the memory.
“Where have you been? The boys have been asking after you. Draco’s been so sad since you left.” Luna said.
“Well hello.” Draco said with a surprised eyebrow raise. He set his satchel on the table by the door and kicked off his shoes. “I thought we were meeting later.
"Pardon the interruption, but if the Ministry wants to know more about us, they need to prove they're not going to come and slaughter us all the second we're no longer beneficial to them. If you need a tidbit for your findings, here's something: Does the Ministry want to kiss our asses individually, or are they okay with just eating shit to compensate?"
Harry's head was spinning with it all, his newfound obsession with Nightingales not helping in the slightest. As the train sped on, and his friends moved on to lighter topics, Harry was still hung up on one Draco Malfoy.
Severus' mistake had been underestimating her intelligence. Just like her mother, she had a gift in seeing straight through his lies and had been able to figure it out all on her own. Barty Crouch posed as Mad-Eye had discovered her parentage last year, and when the cat came out of the bag that Draco was a siren it was irreversible. Voldemort would know the only secret he had cared about keeping for almost two decades. The last thing in his life that he gave a damn about.
Harry couldn't accept that as an answer. "Sir, if Draco really was a siren like his mum, wouldn't he want to go into hiding if Voldemort was hunting sirens?"
"It's time," she said, the finality in her tone sending a shiver down his spine. He took the vial from her, bracing himself as he downed it in one go.
As they left the diner and walked back to the contraption of death and destruction, there was a small group of young men gathered in the parking lot. Something about them made Draco uneasy, and he picked up his pace to keep close to the older sirens.
Barty Crouch took a step backwards, nearly toppling himself over as he tripped on the rug. Ludo gave an unsure smile; he appeared like he was trying to decide whether he was afraid or not.
Draco finished the sentence for her. "And not find myself in any precarious danger. Mother, Cassie is more than capable of keeping me safe, there is no reason to fret. I promise, I'll be safe."
Draco's head snapped over to the teacher's table. Following his eyes, Harry found the Potions professor staring down into his goblet while lost in thought. Finally, Draco would see that the man wasn't as great as he thought him to be.
His vision was spotty, black dots flashing in and out of existence. He hadn't been spotted. He knew as much when they grabbed Potter and made no move in his direction, dragging off the boy-who-lived to some statue in the near distance. Lifting his shaking hands, he made the sign formation for a cloaking spell, allowing himself to camouflage into his surroundings as the world around him went dark.
Cass threw the nearest object (a vase) at the Oracle's head, and it missed him by a hairline as he ducked to avoid it. There was a rather significant hole indented on the wall in the vase's wake.
Cassie sucked on her teeth. "Don't confuse love with ignorance, Draco. Sirens may only love once, but that doesn't mean that the object of our affection is good for us. Look how it turned out for my mother. I don't blame my father, I really don't, but I promised myself that I wouldn't make the same mistake she did. Yes, I loved him long before his offering. But I had to know he was in it for the right reasons and that he wasn't blind to the face of reality."
"Can I help you?" Cassie drawled out, her sickly sweet tone paired with sharp eyes that sent a shiver down Draco's achy spine.
He doesn't move other than opening his eyes to watch Cassie get up to answer the door. Draco might just sleep here, screw moving to his cold bed.
"I hate to say it, mate, but she's got a point. He's barely ever in class from what I've heard, and when I do see him he looks pretty exhausted. And I don't understand how you've connected the dots between someone putting your name in the Goblet and that someone being Draco Malfoy. I'd be suspicious of his cousin before him. She's terrifying."
Andrew wasn't someone he had ever gotten to know really well, but over the summer he'd learned at Order meetings that he was Cassie's mate. That was important in their culture, something more sacred than marriage. Draco would have one soon, some lousy American that Harry knew nothing about. How did they even know that he would be good for Draco? That he didn't have some ulterior motive, that he'd look out for Draco better than anyone else would?
A hand came to run through his hair, and a cup of water was poured over his gills. Perhaps this was all a fever dream.
"How do we know that their bond isn't acting up because of the reflecting pool water they drank and not the prophecy?"
"She's joining the Death Eaters?" Harry asked incredulously, and Andrew fell to his knees, forehead resting against the doorjamb. He wasn't even crying. Just looking shell-shocked. Empty.
Severus interrupted, "I'm sorry, but I wasn't aware you had gone and trained extensively as a Healer? Tell me, who was it you studied under at St. Mungo's?"
Footsteps stomped around the corner. Draco didn't pull away, simply turned to rest his head on Harry's shoulder to see who it was.
With his head still throbbing, he did not have much of a choice. He risked a peak to the other two, when a strained voice blared through the cemetery, turning Draco's blood ice cold and stopping his heart in its tracks.
She wordlessly handed the letter to Andrew. Pressing the heels of her palms into her eyes Cassie began to take a few steadying breaths. After collecting herself for a minute, she fixed herself into a proper position, all straight posture and chin lifted and hands crossed on her lap with poise.
"Now that you have returned to your barely redeemable levels of decorum," Severus drawled, "the Headmaster has burdened me with inquiring you both about a favor."
Cassie? He dared not shout, could hear that they weren't alone, muffled voices of confusion in the distance.
Uncorking the vial, Narcissa emptied its contents into the cup before setting it on the ground in front of them. Palms upward, they laid their hands together in tight formation around the cup. Closing his eyes, he focused on harmonizing to the tune of the Nightingales' Songs.
It was a tale that he was regaled with at least once every week. Not that he minded. With each recollection, it was like the power of his ancestors was brought forth in his veins, his blood boiling to continue their legacy.
He smelled blood. It was fresh, the scent of iron burning his nostrils. It smelled foreign enough for Draco to know it wasn't his. He took a deep inhale.
"In the case of human-siren bonds, the established way of linking two cores is by removing one of the siren's scales and creating an incision near the clavicle to mimic the wound typically created using teeth or claws in siren-siren pairs. The removed scale is then placed in the human's mouth, as it's a place where the pair's bodily fluids have already familiarized themselves with each other-"
He floated with zero effort. Attempting to move around was... baby steps, 'slow and steady,' he told himself. He shifted his tail, thinking about using the same muscles one would to shift your weight from one foot, but all it did was throw him off kilter. His tail was so much longer than his legs, didn't cooperate in the same way as these muscles were different. Like having a completely different set of limbs nothing like either his arms or legs.
They made it back just after sundown, and Draco pondered the likelihood of Peeves coming after them to stir up a cauldron of trouble. Filch wouldn't be able to do much to them if they were caught outside of their dormitories, other than perhaps demand that Severus serve them detention.
As they approached the docks where the spectators stood, despite being almost a mile beneath them Draco could hear the echos of their cheering. The Task hadn't started yet, but it would soon.
The two men stood stiff as rigor mortis. Barely meeting each other's eyes as the silence stretched on between them.
As he ate, his neck felt hot. Someone's eyes were intently on him, but he didn't want to draw even more attention to himself by whipping around to catch the culprit in the act.
"Is that where you two have been? Teleporting all over the place?" Draco wished he'd been there to see that. He assumed it was a lot like apparition, and would've gotten a laugh if Cassie landed somewhere without her eyebrows.
"It is not nonsense, you intolerable wench. You're allowed to hold jealously over the fact that you will
Hermione turned to Ron with her 'it's clearly obvious, but I'll explain to you anyways' face, but Cassie came from around the corner to beat her to the punchline. Snape followed close behind, but kept a distance upon seeing the state Draco was in.
While Draco recalled his vision of Cassie and his father, said Head of House calmly crossed the room to hook his arm in her elbow. As Draco got towards the end of it, he was forcibly escorted into the stairwell.
Draco laughed, letting himself fall so he could lay down. Cassie copied him, and they both turned their heads to look at each other.
Umbridge's mouth opened and closed a few times in a very fish-like choreography. She lowered her wand a few inches, before raising it with renewed vigor. No one had time to react before she struck.
They were inside the castle now, almost to their shared quarters. "That isn't fair! What if one siren manipulates someone to get at another siren?"
He clenched and unclenched his fists, breathing deeply while he worked on calming his expression. He didn't even need to go to the bathroom--that was the best part--he simply needed a break from her breathing down his neck while he tried to complete his potions essay.
There was blood splattered on the older siren's face, but it washed away as he dove under the surface and reappeared a foot away from Draco.
A drop fell onto Severus' hands. Another, his robes, the tear-stain the only evidence that what Draco was hearing was true.
"Well, this past summer I spent some time with him and Cassie, and I sorta, kinda developed what some may classify as a crush, which in my opinion is a heavy-handed word-"
"What's the point in plotting a fake death if you want to throw it out the window after a few months?" Cassie argued.
Someone, perhaps Corey, broke off into a sprint, the squelch of damp forest leaves and dirt marking his departure.
His dark eyes seemed sharper than usual, vulturine as they bored into Harry's. "Whatever conspiracy you've got swirling in that thick head of yours, spit it out."
Mad-Eye (or, rather, Crouch Jr.) had made them learn about sirens in DADA last year. The term 'Nightingale' was not unfamiliar to him, but Harry had gone down a rabbit hole of research after this particular conversation.
His friend rolled his eyes, slumping back against the desk. "Nightingales are just like that, hunting in pairs or whatever. They do it without thinking."
"It's alright if you regret it," Draco spat out, the paleness of his face suggesting that it would be anything but.
Severus rolled his eyes and continued on. "They are currently arranging the finer details of the Third Triwizard Task, and concerns have been raised about the assurance of the Champions' safety. After the
"I reckon the Ministry wants to feel more in control over the beasts that Dumbledore's so intent on letting in," Ron commented.
"Harry, don't!" Hermione warned as she yanked on his robes to keep him seated. He would've protested more, but Dumbledore had swept his way to the center of commotion and sent him a warning look.
She kept talking, and Draco couldn't find the energy in him to keep listening. It all seemed so trivial. Worrying about a dance, when there was so much else happening in the world.
"Because, he's operating under the impression that I sent her to him, which gives an advantage. He thinks I can control her, so he won't need to manipulate anyone. He'll simply ask and expect it to get done."
excited about it." Cassie was stacking pebbles atop one another, her boredom evident as she didn't even blink as they toppled, quietly going about rebuilding the stacks.
He should've shoved her off the couch when he had the chance. "You really want to watch this whole place burn? Is there not enough chaos already with the Triwizard Tournament?"
If Dumbledore was involved in this, it could mean nothing good. It wasn't public knowledge that Snape had a daughter, and yet they transferred her to Hogwarts for the school year. Were the States not safe for her? But the threat was targeting Snape and Draco as well...
Dumbledore's jaw clacked shut. The old man looked furious, standing and making a move towards Draco, but Andrew leapt to his defense.
"If you are ever on the run, get to the sea," Corey had advised him on one such occasion. "She will always protect you, no matter what."
At the very least, the other sirens were going about their way, not even sending Harry a disinterested glance. Small miracles...
"Doesn't work like that, Dray. Only the Siren that sang to someone can counter the damage. You could sing to them to extend the demands you wish of them, but trying to undo another siren's Song will do virtually nothing."
The stone walls were cool against his back, rough edges digging into his shoulder blades as Draco forced himself even closer to him. In a moment of panic, Harry realized his blood was beginning to trail south. He tensed for a moment, prompting Draco to pull back to meet his eyes.
She sighed upon meeting his gaze, likely disappointed he didn't recognize what she was doing. "Really, Dray, this is an important skill set to have. Our ancestors have relied on these predictions to survive after all these centuries."
In her slow healing process he had unfortunately gotten to know her. The doubt had already been planted in his head the moment Lily's life had been endangered, and his hatred for James only went so far. If anything, he had begun to further despise the man for simply putting Lily at risk. Damn Gryffindors and their need to run headfirst into danger with no matter as to who they drug down with them. He figured the reason they'd never gotten along with Slytherins was simply because snakes could never get over their instinct for self-preservation. Their unwillingness to leap blindly into action made them unappealing to the risk-seekers who would never understand their perception of the world.
A growl rose from deep in his chest as primal anger consumed him. They can try to starve and weaken him all they like, he'd die kicking and screaming before they'd control him.
Draco said his goodbyes and left the bath while trying not to look like an absolute fool while doing so. He got dressed and curled up on the sofa by the fireplace when he noticed something peculiar about the room. An extra door had appeared next to the one that led into Cassie's bedroom, and upon further investigation, Draco felt a stone drop in his stomach.
Both seemed satisfied with his answer, and went about transforming back and drying themselves off. Draco pushed himself up onto the edge of the pool and almost feel right back in as a fluffy towel in the ugliest shade of yellow smacked him upside the head. It was followed by uncontrolled cackling, but instead of starting a fight and tossing it back, he used it to dry his hair like the good sport that he was. He'd get revenge later, when they were least expected it.
He leaned his head against hers, fighting the heaviness of his eyelids. "You know, what a stupid design. Any other siren, no problem! But let's make Nightingales have this absurd weakness since their magic is regulated by the phases of the moon."
the restlessness seep from her body at the touch of her mate. Utterly disgusting how sweet they were.
She had reached their side of the room, and had paused mid-stride upon looking at his table. Draco willed himself not to look up, to pretend that he hadn't noticed. He really did not want to deal with the headache that would come from unnecessarily interacting with her.
She nodded, shaking herself out of her shock. "Cedric Diggory came running to me about students fighting in the courtyard. When I arrived, Professor Moody"--she shot him a glare--"had just attempted to hex Miss Prince, who was capable enough to defend herself, when I stepped in."
If Severus hadn't helped charm his robes, he'd be paranoid of the blood completely seeping through to the outer layer for everyone to see. Then he really would have the unbearable curiosity of all four houses breathing down his neck, if not that of the two visiting schools, AND Madam Pomfrey. It was all a bloody mess.
"Yes, but his symptoms don't line up with any of them! It all sounds like symptoms of delayed growth spurts and siren presentation, which is common in sirens hidden among wizard-kind. His death doesn't make any sense-"
Cassie swung first, hitting the one closest in the temple, and it was almost comical how fast he crumpled to the ground like a puppet getting its strings cut. Instead of backing down, the other three lunged at them, and Draco's vision went black before he could register anything else.
Not being sorted into Gryffindor for nothing, Harry leaned in the rest of the way, pressing his lips to Draco's with a tentative softness. He lifted a hand up to caress the blond's cheek, and ended up with a hand fisting the hair at the nape of his neck while Draco pressed further into him. It grew progressively heated in a manner of seconds, Draco swinging a leg over Harry's so he was sitting on the latter's thighs, Harry feeling dizzy from the rush of adrenaline that coursed through him.
More grindylows had appeared than there where initially, and Potter struggled to fend them off. As they began to drag Potter downwards into the cluster of weeds, Draco reacted without even thinking. Talons extended, he clawed at the closest grindylow, a rumble of satisfaction coming through him. The other grindylows, aware of the predator in their midst, scattered like leaves in the wind.
She had been in the worst shape of the five. The first and only Nightingale they had managed to catch, caught in a rare moment of weakness when she had been out in the daylight. A Nightingale out with the sun put a flashing target on her back, black scales a dead giveaway against the blue waters. Somehow, he never did manage to get the answer as to why she had been out during the day, why she had been so careless.
Andrew looked over his shoulder to glare at him. "He threw himself off the bed when you grabbed him, dumbass. We need to get him into the water."
Draco screamed as Andrew dug his claws into his shoulder, but he had successfully been restrained by the other two. They were all in their siren form, but Harry had only now just noticed the full transition. In all honesty, he could see why they had been designated as Beasts and not Beings.
Loss. Someone died. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. It was someone Cassie knew. Please not be someone that Draco knew as well.
His tail. Cassie had charmed the ceiling to be a reflective surface the day prior. He hated the concept at the time, but now he rejoiced in it. As his transformation completed after a brief few seconds, he couldn't look away. It was just incredible.
She hugged him one last time as the train blew the final whistle. It was a sight to behold, an improper gesture that any sensible witch or wizard would never guess would be seen within their lifetime. An outwardly display of affection by a pure-blood family, and the Malfoys, at that. Had more people been actively watching the group amidst all the chaos of parents and students doing a last-minute shuffle before departure, perhaps the momentous act would've made the gossip section of the next day's paper.
"Bloody hell, Andy, if she's feral then keep her somewhere she won't kill anyone," Draco complained.
"Harry, are you certain that you want to do this?" If Snape's voice didn't break him out of his reverie, it was the fact the professor had chosen to use his first name.
"Potter, do I make myself clear? If Malfoy tries to rope you into some scheme, I trust you to convince him that the adults are handling the situation. As children, I do not want to hear anything of you running headfirst into this war. I'll hex you myself if you dare set foot outside of schoolgrounds. Do you understand?"
For as handsome as the well dressed man is, he is easily over looked and forgotten. Even helping a half blind man crossing a busy road or catching a baby carriage before it rolled into traffic made him forgettable, but not the feeling of kindness for the man, nor the reprimand for the mother.
“They’re little kids. I don’t play with little kids.” James said stubbornly. Draco just raised an eyebrow.
“To be friends with Mr. Potter.” Scorpius said. He then started heading towards his room but stopped to look at them. “You are friends, right?”
“You’re lucky I love you.” Harry grumbled. “And this present, I don’t want you to get the wrong idea so I’m going to have to explain it.”
“Ah, Yes. His work. He’s much too busy to see us anymore.” Fleur said not masking her disappointment. “We understand though. Of course we understand.”
“Tried to be witty. You look like you had a fun time.” Ginny said. “I am familiar with how you look after snogging someone.”
Draco snorted but smiled at him. Harry’s breath caught at the exquisite beauty that was in his arms. So many emotions welled up in him that he didn’t know what to say. Instead he pulled Draco closer and kissed him like he hadn’t in years.
“Open the other one.” Harry said, instead of saying something about not being surprised that the Malfoy’s would decorate with Tiffany ornaments.
“I’m never taking my ring off. I’ll fight anyone that tells me to.” Harry said. He then grabbed Draco’s hand and lifted it up, kissing the knuckle above the ring in a copy of what Draco did earlier.
“Draco’s going to be coming down soon. Don’t let him see you like this. Try to calm yourself.” Blaise said as he walked over to the door. He opened it and walked out smiling, shutting the door behind him.
Gossip rags speculated about every person who was spotted out with him. Thank Merlin for their teams personal PR manager. He had it on good authority that he was one of the favorites for PR because he was, as his team’s manager put it, a “triple threat.” He was already a celebrity, he was an actual skilled flyer, and, even though there were crimes committed during the war, he actually kept to himself and caused no trouble. It helped that he didn’t date. Been there, tried that, and been traumatized each time.
“After that last comment? No. I have arithmancy.” Draco said shuffling to the door with Harry still attached to him.
“Cissa, don’t make me nauseous.” Lucius whined with a grimace. He got up to walk over to his wife and enveloped her in his arms. “You’re terrible.”
After Luna left the room, Blaise turned to look at Draco. Draco opened his mouth then closed it only to turn away and run his hand over one of the strands of garland. Blaise stood in the doorway admiring the soft glow the tree cast on the blond.
“Okay, in context that doesn’t sound great. But considering who you are I get why you’d want to keep it to yourselves.” Hermione said. She clarified when Harry frowned at her. “You two can be yourselves without changing for outside influences.”
Malfoy usually did hourly sessions with his clients but since he didn’t trust Harry on his own he actually moved in for the duration of Harry’s recovery. Harry had been so angry about that but when Malfoy casually mentioned what Harry had done without any supervision suddenly all his friends were pro-Malfoy. It was annoying because Malfoy verbally treated him the same like they were back in school but his actions contradicted him. He’d be making fun of his hair while preparing his food and nutrition potions, or he’d sneer at him while helping him go through stretches as gently as possible to minimize pain.
“No it is not.” Mrs. McGonagall said imperiously. “Before you interrupted with your late entrance we had a disagreement. As I am a main sponsor, and the one who encouraged your promotion, even at your young age, I would think I’d get some say in the building process.”
Draco entered his home to be greeted by his live-in maid, Luna, who helped him take his overcoat off. He rifled through the pockets before she took it away and held the coin in his hand as he approached the doors to the drawing room. He took a breath in and opened the door. All talking ceased as all eyes turned to him.
Draco was some what sneaking through the hallways to get to his and Harry’s meet up room. He probably wasn’t doing a great job of sneaking though because he was trying to get to the room quickly.
“How the bloody hell can you say that so casually?” Draco asked. He didn’t fight as his hand was taken away from his face to be held by Harry between them.
Blaise walked across to the drawing room looking around as if he had heard something. He came across the coin that Professor Lupin had given Draco and picked it up to inspect it. He turned when he heard footsteps behind him.
“I had great respect for Mrs. McGonagall but it feels like this is a monument for her late husband. I understand wanting to honor those you love but there are actual ways to do that.” Harry said as he stood up to pace.
“If you’re referring to me as “stupid things” then yes, you do do stupid things.” Harry said with a wink. Draco’s eyes narrowed as he grimaced and pulled away.
This year Harry went with Draco to pick out the tree. He hadn’t minded the fussing about boughs and smells as they went to pick one out since he’d never done it before. The hot cocoa and snuggles after putting up the tree had been worth the scrubbing off of sap. Sap seemed to be impervious to cleaning spells.
“Bye Albus, Scorpius, James, Lily. Have a great day Draco.” Blaise said. Draco nodded and followed his children out, Blaise shutting the door behind them.
“Thank you.” Draco said after a moment. “James tries to act mature but then he does that.” Draco said making a vague gesture. “I think seeing all those toys in the windows on Main Street addled his brain.”
Harry had been so ecstatic to be back that when he got home and saw Malfoy he hugged the blond, asked him out to dinner, and then kissed him all in the span of two minutes. He abruptly pulled away when he felt the blond shaking and was worried he had just ruined everything. It turned out Malfoy was laughing. The blond just said yes to dinner and pulled him back into their second kiss.
“You asked Malfoy. To marry you.” Ron said slowly. Harry nodded. Ron looked at Hermione who also nodded.
“I’ve never fought an angel but I suggest you take off your coat and put up your dukes.” Harry said.
Harry walked with no hesitation into the Hall and walked over to his usual spot. He grinned at Hermione who had sat next to Ron. She usually avoided sitting next to the red head since she’d end up with bits of food on her book or homework or notes.  Harry waited for Draco to sit down first and then sat down himself.
“I like cooking and considering how fast fruit goes bad it’s easier to just turn it into jam.” Potter said. “Do you want me to feed you?”
“Hello Professor.” Harry said as he headed over to sit by the fire finally realizing how cold he was.
“Naughty gets you a spanking and no gift.” Harry said. He held his breath as Draco seemed to think about which one he wanted more. The blond let out a put upon sigh.
“Can we go over the blueprints at a later meeting? I have an event I must get to.” Harry said. Mrs. McGonagall nodded and removed her finger from the button.
Wouldn’t it be the best to have someone financially support you, besides yourself, just so you have that comfort? Draco living the dream.
Seeing that Harry stopped, Draco looked at the ruins and quickly understood. He silently stood beside Harry, waiting for him to notice.
Muffled gasps rang out as the surrounding students watched with terror in their veins, all of them dreading what will happen to the boy now.
" He fed me healing potions ?" ; Now this truly astonishedd Harry . He did not expect Malfoy to actually care about him as such . It was a novel feeling .
The moment Eggie landed in Draco's arms, Nagini lunged towards Harry, aiming with a deadly strike. It's agile body moving fast. The sight of the egg distracted Harry as his eyes moved away from the snake. Nagini took this chance and lunged !
Dumbledore did not give up and further probed," I have also heard that Miss Weasley is a known company to you . Perhaps-? "
Leaving these useless thoughts behind, Draco entered the shop. The interior was simple and generous, neatly displaying various items on the shelves around.
"  We shouldn't kill the Headmaster. If he dies then the moral of everyone will be affected. So...so… you should tell him ! "
But before he could do anything, the quick flick of wand and sound of spelling sounded, " Expelliarmus!! "
“I don’t blame them for being attracted.” Harry said. He smiled at the pleased look and slight blush.
“I’m sorry, what?” Draco asked somehow even more startled. “You? Don’t deserve me? Don’t be daft, Potter.”
“And I expect to hear a play by play of your snowball fight.” Draco called after them, watching fondly as they followed Luna. He turned to Blaise and saw him watching him with a smile.
Albus and a red faced Scorpius followed him a little bit away. They then squatted down when Blaise squatted down.
“Almost blank. I signed my name on the line. You can use it for anything. Something fun like a shopping spree. Something serious like an emergency repair. Hell, you could buy a duplex or townhouse if you wanted.” Harry said. “You don’t even have to use it if you don’t want to.”
He entered the room and glanced around. He heard a harp strum and turned to see a beautifully ornate harp. It was well taken care of. He started looking around the room when his eyes fell on a beautiful box inlaid with mother of pearl. He tried to open it but it was locked so he coaxed the box to unlock.
“Well, I figured there was someone. Not Malfoy, mind you.” Ron started his face kind of scrunched up. “It probably won’t sink in until I see it.”
“We can tell the world if you want. But only if you’re sure.” Draco said running a hand through Harry’s hair.
“Bye Blaise.” Albus said as he tugged Scorpius out the door, James followed after with the baby carriage, Lily waving her arms once again.
" Looks like you're enjoying it. If you like being a slut so much maybe I'll let my aurors have their way with you."
Hand running down to Draco's throat , gently rubbing the small protrusion . It was a wonder that the tiny ball wasn't running up and down but slightly trembling .
Behind them Yaxley was again running to them with a new vigour rarely found in his old-age. Bright lights flew around and the tapping of boots on the marble floor grew faster and louder.
Turning to Draco , Harry searched his beautiful features as he noticed that his eyes held a certain warmth and gentleness when he looked at people in front.  A sudden fire burned in Harry's chest as he tasted the sourness on his tongue .  His eyes froze completely and his face blackened into something terrifying.
It was getting harder to leave , to take even a step away . He knew it was the illusion making it harder , testing his limit .
Her numb legs collapsed as she plopped on the floor. Drawing her knees up, she gazed at the beautiful body on the bed,
With a jerk , he came back to himself. Gripping Harry's wrist , he said in a desperate voice ," wait "
Did the sun rise from the west ? Or was it the east ? Is Blue of Sea it's own color or was it a reflection of the sky above ? Draco's head was in a tangle . It was so tangled that it could be called a messy ball of wool rather than a brain.
The care Potter subconsciously directed towards the egg wasn't casual. It seemed much more deliberate to the point that somehow it felt similar to how he treated Weasley and Granger. It might even be more but not less.
Ron's face shifted and returned to his original one as the woman kissing him let go . Her eyes confused and wide.
These words seemed comical and superficial and only for saying and not actual action. But when Harry said them, he meant to follow them through.
So Eggie finally appeared through this chapter is not heavily based on eggie but reaction and feelings of Harry and Draco towards eggie but it will come soon.
Afterall, they now had another Master !! It was a very happy occasion ! Their Lord has found himself a sweetheart ! And Master Draco is such a cultured gentleman! And beautiful as well !!! He will surely make Master Harry very happy !!
" How ?" He asked , wanting to know what can breach the secure and unbreakable wall he has built around Hogwarts.
Harry didn't even realise when his eyes took on the gloomy green of a deep sea. The obsession in his eyes was scary but well hidden behind the clarity. His eyes only held Draco, they only reflected Harry's love , his infatuation and his lust for his beloved.
Even if Harry wasn't too keen on working with him, he had valuable information about the war and many other things. Advantages can be gained only after derailing another person hogging them. And that was what he intended to do. Dumbledore was a good person, Harry knew that but he was blind to many things. Harry was grateful to him to an extent, an extent to which he trusted a well-meaning and knowledgeable but slightly foolish family elder. He went along with him because he needed more information about Voldemort. He learnt it early on, Know your allies but know your enemies better.
Next time Draco woke up, he was lying on the ground in an unknown place. The room was as big as the great hall with marble pillars standing on both sides. Slowly, he sat up and looked around. His body felt like it was run over by the Hogwarts express.  It hurt everywhere. Standing up, he noticed that many objects were carefully kept in here, they looked meticulously cared for. The room itself was dusty and dirty, but the objects were clean without a speck of dirt. Cautiously, he did not touch the objects but looked around and spotted a man in white robes sitting on a stone chair  in the far front. The man wore white robes with gold embroidery similar to wizarding robes. He had blond hair a tint darker that Draco's, somewhat similar to his father. The man sat in a perfect and stiff posture. His back straight, head up and had his back to Draco. He seemed to be reading something. He could see through the man, Draco noticed.  He came to a stop behind him and was thinking of calling out, when the man spoke, " You finally woke up, little one." It was the same gentle voice that spoke in his head. With this, Draco assumed that it was him. The voice did say it was a soul.
Below the school, two people dropped in an abandoned chamber with a thud. Opening their eyes the first sight they saw was the enormous corpse of a huge snake. The body was laying there, rotting and smelly, possibly dead for years.
Draco's pale face instantly puffed red with anger. A scowl itched his face and he pushed Harry away without a thought, "You shameless wanker ! Pervert ! Stay away from me !" And he swiftly walked out with steps stiff out of anger.
" Could you not do that ?" The look in Ron's eyes was of anger as he stood up and grabbed his luggage and turned to leave without a word to either of them .
Everything was silent. The only sound was Harry's heaving breaths and Draco's silent wheezing. No one was speaking anything. The sound of cicadas outside was clearly sonorous. All their eyes trained on Draco as he gave a violent shudder and collapsed entirely, his eyes rolling back as he fell. Harry caught him, still frightened but more calm.
A graceful smile rose on Pansy's face, "Of course it is.  This is the place where I sit, it has to be the best. Obviously, it will be noticed and used by others"
As they again turned on the way, the old hag had travelled a few dozen steps ahead of them. Draco and Harry quickly made a joint effort to keep up. Soon, they found themselves entering an old and depleted cottage. The inside was messy with dust and mud everywhere. It seemed impossible to imagine that someone lived here had they not seen the old hag. The inside was dark, no candles or lights were lit, and an unpleasant stench penetrated every knock and crevice.
When Harry finally came to a stop, he was exhausted and heaving heavily. His muscles burned and calves wobbled but that did nothing to garner his attention, even temporarily. He stood there, as still as a statue, bathing in moonlight spilling out of the huge windows, drowning his body with it. He did not understand what he was feeling, did not understand his own emotions. Was that even possible?
How could she so easily forget her? Was she such a selfish and uncaring character? Did a person's life mean so little to her? Did Pansy's life mean so little to her? Was Pansy so easily disposable to her?
Aggrieved and helpless, Pansy could only confusedly look at the smiling face and let the warm and firm grip around her shoulders take her outside.
Draco looked as one second Potter was alright while the next he fell like a sack of potatoes . Panicked Draco moved to him . The golden boy cannot die on him !!! He did not need another murder charge !!! Checking his body to find that not only was his magic entirely depleted , his body was in a weak condition as well. Potter not only had deformed bones but also had many internal injuries yet to heal completely.
The items here were as good quality as that of Diagon Alley. There were various things ranging from expensive items such as jewelleries to the most common household items like a teapot. Gliding through the shelves, an ominous shine caught Draco's eyes. Moving forward, a simple and unadorned wooden box came into his view. The top of the box was made with clear glass and inside lay a mysterious pair of opals.
As the two women walked out the door, Draco's cheek healed and went back to its original condition. Whenever she came and whatever she did , Draco did not speak a word and never gave a reaction. He endured and endured but never did anything else. He never told Harry about this. Ginny was a potential suitor for Harry and a close friend. He did not want to ruin their relationship. For all he knew they might already be sleeping together in a relationship. Even if he did tell him, Draco knew that Harry would never object and probably blame him even worse.
But Harry still has a doubt, so he silently questioned, "Why did you ask me to come with you? You didn't even need me"
In front of them, Draco was on his knees before Harry. His brows frowned in worry before flashing hesitation. But they soon turned into determination.
As soon as the car disappeared, Harry, not waiting for the arrival of order of Pheonix, slowly turned around to silently pick up a packed trunk . He needed to leave as well or who knows when the uninvited guests will arrive ? He took a last look around to see if he forgot something, as he did so, there was no emotion in his eyes. They were cold and hard. They were the eyes of a victor.
Reaching the hut , Harry tapped on the door. The door opened to show a very happy Hagrid whose face changed after noticing the person in Harry's arms.
Dumbledore anxiously followed , questioning, " Draco , my child. Are you fine ? Such an extreme reaction is uncommon. Is your body in good health ?"
Blaise couldn't process what was happening but his heart was anxious to let Neville leave with such misunderstanding. It felt like if, today, he let Neville leave with this misunderstanding, then the regret tomorrow will be an infinite torture for his whole life. So, he hastily tried to prove his innocence.
"Potter ! What are you doing ?!" Draco asked furiously. Now, he had to redo the entire ritual again. But then he saw Harry's next action and a horror rose in his heart.
" Well..…. Looks like we need to hurry even more " , Harry said , gears already wheeling in his head.
His eyes flashed patience and worry as he shakily stood up, carrying Draco's limp body inside the tent.
The soul made a gesture with his hands and immediately a ring flew to him. The ring shone bright with a blue-green light. It had a turquoise stone embedded within the silver. At once, Draco was astonished. It was a Malfoy ring! Every Malfoy is given this ring on their twelfth birthday as a recognition of their talent and expertise by their elders. And another thing about this ring is that only its owner or his spouse can command and touch it. It has been a sacred ornament in the Malfoy Family for years. This ring signifies the sweat, blood and tears it's owner flows to achieve his/her goal. It signifies the reason to live for the one who wears it. It signifies everything they are and they own. Giving this ring to another signifies giving your everything to another, heart, body and soul as well making the person their sole purpose from now. Opposite to contrary belief, Malfoys are absolutely hopeless romantics. The same goes with the Blacks. And Draco, being the perfect spawn of Malfoys and Blacks, is not only hopeless but absolutely wrecked romantic.
Rubbing his aching nose, Draco hissed," Can you not touch me ? Is touching just anyone common to you? "
The anger in her eyes sent a satisfactory and comfortable feeling through his entire body. This girl was really annoying. Always hanging around Draco like a sticky tail. Touching him here and caressing him there. It wasn't just now, she had been like this since 1st year.
" Yes, when you saved Ginny Weasley in fourth year, you destroyed it ultimately destroying Voldemort"
The soul ripped apart Draco's sleeve to reveal his dark mark. He squeezed the darkly stained skin as coal-black and dense liquid dripped from Draco's pores. Slowly, the thick black blood flowing down turned to the normal crimson colour.
Harry realised that Draco's insults - no , Draco himself was like a flower of poppy to Harry. He was irresistibly drawn to him , still longed for him even if he knew that having any more of him will trap Harry in those deadly eyes.
The oldman was rambling far and fast. Eloise had a favourable impression of Draco from the start. The reason for this is still unknown to him but something in him stirs at the sight of that boy's pale skin and blond hair. They seem so dear to him but still so strange.
Draco was about to turn around as well but firm hands steadily stopped his movement. He gave Harry a questioning glare. Harry sighed as his hands rose to draw the hood over Draco's head lower and to rewrap the scarf around his neck so as to cover Draco till only his eyes were visible.
"You truly can ?" Sure enough. After hearing his tone, Harry tacitly decided to talk freely this time. Not trying to hide anything. This is an obvious acceptance of the teaching. Therefore, it's also a silent acceptance of his proposition.
She stealthily stood behind Hermione, almost touching her back. And as if feeling the burning warmth of her magic , Hermione flinched, jerking her hands back a little.
Ron , not able to take anymore nausea, directly said, " You are a thief , Fletcher. Everyone knows it "
Draco thought of his own ring securely hanging on his neck . He always had it but he never wore it . On his twelfth birthday when he got it , he swore that he would wear this ring on the day he became the greatest potion master in the wizarding world , not just Europe. He knew that it was a big dream but he worked hard for it . He touched his chest to feel the ring inside . His eyes lowered and he appeared to be reminiscing in a memory with a melancholic feel . The look only lasted for a second before it flew away and Draco lifted his head and looked at the soul in front of him .
Draco kept walking and Harry kept following . Why was Potter following him ? Was interrogating him not enough , that now he needed to escort him as well ? He was too busy in his gloating that he did not notice Harry lifting his head and looking around with wary eyes .
Sitting down , they closed their eyes as she said ," We are thankful to you , mother , for giving us the food on our table , air to breath , water to drink , people to cherish and magic to protect ."
The oldman had recovered some days ago and was now actively making his life difficult but he wasn't without advantages. At least now unexpectedly meeting Snape wasn't a sanity-threatening disaster that could wreck him. Well, he was still a sanity-threatening disaster , Harry just got an early reminder from Eloise and ran the other way as soon as he knew.
Ron refused to meet Harry's gaze . He didn't need such a friend who hurt him .  Understanding Ron's refusal , Harry still continued ," When I hurt you tell me who tried his best to stop me even if it meant he could possibly get the same treatment ?"
A broken hiss escaped Draco's throat, furious and unforgiving , " I hate you ! I fucking hate you ! I swear, Potter, I am going to skin you and feed you to dogs ! I hate you! Get lost ! You mutt ! You-you ….!"
" Nothing much. Parkinson and Nott are on their way and Hermione must be out as well. Ron might take longer because of the wedding "
Harry frowned as well and nodded. A child shouldn't stay wet and naked for long in such weather. This much he knew as well.
Tsk ! Such a coward ! I would've chosen A. No one hates a nice pair of juicy plum lips belonging to a pretty woman …..unless you're gay. Then kiss her husband , instead. And if somehow you already have a partner ….. happy breakup !!! Now back to the story.
Harry's hands came forward to hold him and  a single touch of his palm on Draco's waist was enough. Draco's back arched , his mouth flew open and eyes rolled up spilling intoxicated tears .
The house elf answered honestly , accounting everything he knew , " Master Draco has been fine but very busy. Everyday , Master Draco will wake up exactly an hour after the break of dawn. After cleaning up and breakfast , he visits Mr. Dumbledore to check his condition before practicing new potions and spells with lunch and dinner in the middle .Master Draco has been working very hard, often skipping dinner and sleeping late. This servant wants to ask master Draco to retire early but does not dare to disturb him lest his spells and potions go wrong. Forgive this elf for not taking good care of Master Draco, Master Harry. This elf will take any punishment for his disability  "
Draco mused with a concentrated expression and scrunched brows as he again undid the whole wrapping to do it all over again.
“Won’t be gone long. Just think of me spoiling you.” Harry said with a wink. He laughed at the eye roll but felt smug as the door closed behind him.
“Yes, I’ve been thinking about that. I don’t believe you’ve ever been to Vienna in your life.” Remus said steadfastly. Draco looked at Blaise with a raised eyebrow.
After taking off their coats and shoes, Harry made hot chocolate with whipped cream. When he had entered into the living area the only light on was the string lights on the tree. He walked over and handed the drink to Draco. After sitting in the quiet room for a bit Harry gently nudged the blond.
“Goodbye Harry.” Blaise said walking over and holding his hand out for a handshake. Harry stared down at his hand but took it to shake.
“Thank you.” Draco said staring at the band smiling down at it. He then blinked and looked at Blaise. “Not even going to ask who?”
“Put it on me.” Draco ordered and handed the necklace to him. Harry almost dropped it not expecting the necklace to be shoved in his hand but caught it as Draco turned his back to him.
“I thought you wanted to keep this hidden.” Draco said pinching Harry’s side. Harry jerked but didn’t let go.
Harry liked the smug happy smile Draco was making. He remembered Draco telling him that one of his favorite things was to make Harry laugh. He leaned forward and kissed Draco’s smile.
“He’s been terribly busy trying to raise the funds for that new building. He aims to have the finances set before the new year.” Draco said with a half hearted smile. “Why are you getting that tree, Professor?”
“Harry. The benefit for your old office? The one you were in before you were promoted. The one that is doing too well that the ministry keeps cutting funds for.” Draco explained. Harry’s eyes shut in annoyance at himself.
Harry reluctantly conceded after Malfoy explained how he’d never fly again. That reaction wasn’t good enough for the blond, who let it be known in the fiercest scowl Harry’s ever seen. He ended up full heartedly conceding when Malfoy threatened to call Ginny, Hermione, Mrs. Weasley, and even his own mother, Narcissa Malfoy. Two of them together was bad enough but all four actually put fear in him.
“Do you two often have silent conversations in the middle of the corridors?” Blaise Zabini asked with a raised eyebrow. His other eyebrow raised in surprise at the look he was getting from Harry.
“Obviously no lie in, typical of kids,” Harry said, making Draco grin in agreement, “no working. It’s your birthday.”
“You’re going to be his assistant?” Draco asked hopefully as he laid a hand on Harry’s arm, not seeing the incredulous look Harry was giving Blaise.
“I admit I’m starting to lose faith in having you promoted.” Mrs. McGonagall said with a sniff. “We’ll speak on this later, when you’ve come to your senses.”
“It’s lovely.” Blaise said letting Luna drape it around his neck and tucking it into his coat. “I’m sure Harry will appreciate it when he sees it on me. Thank you.”
“No. Take it. And you and Harry should come by my flat at some point. We can all catch up.” Remus said, patting the hand that was curled around the coin.
“Your mother knows about us?” Harry said in a high pitched tone making Draco frown and pull his hand away.
“I’ve finally done it. I’ve lost it.” Harry said running a hand roughly through his hair. The handsome man just smiled at him.
Harry reached forward and shook the tree lightly. Besides rustling from the animated dragon and soft clinking of the few ornaments another rustling came from the tree. A small wooden box fell out of the bottom with a small thunk. He grabbed it before Draco could and turned to face the blond properly.
“I’d tell them to shove it.” Harry said seriously getting an eye roll from Draco. “Seriously, Draco. If they can’t accept that I love you than that’s more telling of them.” Draco made a small choking sound as he placed a hand over his eyes.
“Erm... Together?” Harry asked. Hermione smiled and shook her head in amusement. She canceled the silencing spell and turned only to jump back in shock, knocking into Harry who steadied her.
“Uh huh. Then why does it seem like everyone knows something I don’t?” Draco asked. “And why did we eat dinner on Christmas Eve instead of having it tonight, like in past years?”
Harry leaned up to kiss Draco hungrily. Draco grunted but gave as good as he got. They rolled around the bed snogging each other senseless. They only pulled away from each other to breathe.
It had been a few days since Blaise had been let go by Harry. Christmas Eve at that. The boys had wondered where the man had gone to, especially since Draco told Albus and Scorpius that Blaise was going to tell them about Santa Claus. Draco had been in a quiet mood, being extra cheery around the children. Harry could see how upset Draco really was but didn’t know what to do.
“Aunt Pansy told me to give you hell today because apparently you told her you’d spend it with me.” Scorpius said while crossing his arms.
Remus was walking towards Harry’s and Draco’s house, having been invited to go to their annual Christmas party. Judging by the amount of people heading in that direction, so had half the old block. Remus stopped next to the gate turning to look behind him. There were many people around but he felt as if there was someone he should be seeing. He shrugged and turned back to enter the house. A handsome, well dressed man standing across the street, never being seen but leaving feelings of accomplishment, happiness, and love, turned and walked away.
“Well, early congrats.” Harry said with a grin. Ginny scrunched her face up at him while Luna smiled serenely.
“Oh... Oh!” Hermione said in surprise. “So this morning with Zabini whispering in Malfoy’s ear... I don’t think there’s anything to it.”
“You’re a good man Harry. You were heard.” The man said walking to the other side of the fireplace mantel. “I was instructed to come here.”
“I will go tell him you’re here.” Mr. Potter said, and then quickly headed in the direction of his father’s room.
He came back and felt so much love at the moment. Draco was sitting on the floor in front of the tree just looking up at it. Harry had plugged the tree in before the blond came home so the lights made everything more dreamlike. He set the plates of food on the dining table and walked over to Draco. He sat down next to the blond and wrapped his arm around him. His boyfriend cuddled next to him and let out a content sigh.
Harry stared at Blaise suspiciously as he got back in the cab. Blaise simply smiled at him from the window. Harry watched as the cab drove away and made his way to the door.
“I was aiming for a relationship.” Harry said, starting to kiss Draco’s neck. “A romantic sexual one with domesticity.”
“You usually have breakfast now.” Scorpius said. “But I’m guessing you decided to have a lie in.” He added sheepishly.
“Something like that.” Scorpius said. “And you were right, I did come early to make my trip on time.”
They were finally stopping when they noticed Neville on the edge of the pond wearing skates. Neville stepped on the ice and was suddenly out of control. He nearly took out all the bystanders that had been watching the skate routine before finally being stopped by one of the support poles of a bridge. Blaise signaled for him to stay there and went to get him.
“They threw a curve!” The kid from earlier yelled excitedly. He then ran over and grabbed both Albus and Scorpius. “You’re on my team!”
“I like that idea.” Harry said and kissed him again before he could say anything. Draco pouted when Harry stopped kissing him. “Unfortunately, I must go find out what my lovable sons did this time.”
“I really should get them home.” Draco said as he lifted Lily up and cradled her against him. She was getting fussy.
Blaise decided to do a whole routine that took up the entire skating pond. Everyone who had been skating stopped to make room and watch. Before he knew it, Draco was part of the routine. He had no idea how he did most of the steps he did but he did them without falling.
“Thanks.” Harry said as he turned to look over his shoulder at the blond. He leaned into the kiss but pulled away since it was an awkward angle for his neck. “I’ll see you later tonight.”
“Like it was made for you.” Harry said without really looking. Draco just gave him another flat look and got up to look in the small mirror by the door. Harry watched as Draco looked at it from different angles.
“As long as it’s you proposing in a romantic way then it doesn’t really matter where.” Draco said snootily. “In this case I’d prefer substance over style.”
“Sorry, love. I’ll speak to your father.” Narcissa said, seeing Harry rubbing his neck and Draco glaring, as she shut the window. She then gave Lucius a harsh glare. He pouted at her.
“Oh.” Draco said as he looked down but walked over to the side table straightening whatever was on there. “Where are you going?”
“No. They rarely send us to the same place twice. We might form attachments.” Blaise said. Draco turned to face him.
“You’ve been very obvious, Harry.” Hermione said patting his arm. “It doesn’t upset me. Besides, I don’t believe he’s dating Zabini.”
“Or because Draco must be happy?” Blaise asked. “It’s difficult to help you if you don’t make it clear what you want.”
Draco and Blaise were strolling down the street. Blaise was carrying a few bags that were obviously toys for the children. Draco tossed a coin in Santa’s “chimney” to donate for the local church, nodding at the man dressed as Santa.
“Only in hardly used corridors.” Hermione said as she elbowed Harry. She could feel the scowl over her shoulder. “Come on Harry. You need to go tell Ron and I’ll join you after I drop this off.”
“Five.” Harry said as he opened the door. He gave Draco another quick kiss. “Until then.” He then shut the door and hurried out of the building to get ready, more mentally than physically, for tonight.
Draco frowned heavily at the closed doors. He was so confused and hurt. He stood at the bottom of the stairs and looked up towards the boy’s room. It took him a few times to bring a smile to his face but he had to stay happy for his family, even if it hurt him.
Draco was standing in the drawing room with Luna, who was fluffing the tinsel in the tree. He had just returned home and immediately went to see what was giving off a glow from the drawing room. Luna had taken his coat and jacket and explained that Blaise had decorated the tree. She said that she had gone to speak to the children and when she came back it was decorated.
“Yup.” Harry chirped as he loaded his plate with food and loaded Draco’s plate with some of his favorites.
“Can you hang on for a minute, Neville?” Blaise asked and grabbed Draco’s arm, walking into the shop.
“Mate, he hasn’t been that bad this year.” Ron said slowly. Harry blinked and looked at Ron confused.
Harry walked passed the Ministry seeing a flyer on the bulletin board listing the benefit he missed. He kept walking just letting his feet take him anywhere. Before he knew it he was outside Professor Lupin’s flat. Without thinking he rung the bell.
They walked out of the small room that they had been waiting in, Harry holding the door open for them. Harry looked back into the room as if he was looking for answers to this bizarre situation. Draco stared perplexed as Mrs. McGonagall looped her arm through his to walk with him to the drawing room.
“That doesn’t matter. What matters is I’ve succeeded and no longer need you. Now leave me and Draco alone.” Harry said.
“Then I will most likely attack, maim, kill and death glare.” Harry said with a small smile as he held Draco’s hand and walked towards the Great Hall.
“Excuse me, Draco. Need to do something about that.” Blaise said as he stood up. He then walked over to the table the three people were sitting at. “Forgive me for coming over but I wanted to introduce myself. My name is Blaise and I believe you’re all good friends of Draco’s. We were wondering if you’d care to join us for lunch.”
Harry walked passed him to the front door. He turned to look at Blaise, who was watching him. When he stepped out the door he turned to see Blaise turned away and looking up the stairs. Harry glanced up but saw nothing. Blaise just looked back at him and waved the index cards at him. Harry finally left staring through the front door suspiciously until he was gone from view.
They were back in Draco’s flat sitting on the floor in front of the tree. Dinner had been delicious. Harry had felt like they were in a world of their own. It continued after they left the restaurant. They had leisurely walked the streets of London until it got a little too chilly.
“Of course I do!” Draco said vehemently. “It’s just If I’m wearing a ring and you’re wearing a ring, then people will put two and two together.”
“Harry, you have to remember that the real world will probably be cruel to us.” Draco said running his knuckles over Harry’s cheek.
“It helps having something sturdy to hold onto.” Draco said. “Next you’ll tell me you’re a professional skater.”
“Or I make you your favorite breakfast and give you a birthday present you’ve always wanted.” Scorpius said.
“Of course. Yes!” Harry said a little startled at being asked but, of course, the answer would be yes.
“Love?” A voice asked behind her. She pulled her head out of the floo and saw Lucius with a bemused expression walk in. She put her head back in the floo.
“That’s very kind of you but I have work to do in town. You know what I mean, Harry. So many good people making so many mistakes.” Blaise said. Harry just stared at him.
“You do like it, right?” Harry asked, a little worried. The bright smile Draco gave him made him relax.
Lucius looked out the window to see his son and Harry Potter sitting on one of the garden benches. Harry had an arm around Draco who was cuddled up against him. Even from here he could see the air of warmth and love. It was sickeningly sweet. Draco kept playing with a ring on his left ring finger.
“I’m sure I can move things around. But I promise we’ll go out.” Harry said. Draco was about to say something else when Hermione appeared.
“If you sent me to represent you I would have done it. You didn’t. So I represented you with your husband.” Blaise said cheekily.
“Love, you’ve reciprocated ten times over.” Harry said as he sat next to Draco and kissed his forehead.
“Yes.” Draco said decisively. Harry walked back over to wrap his arms around him and give him another kiss similar to their first one.
“Fine looking building. It’ll look great once built.” The man said conversationally. “Well, Harry. Do you believe I am what I say I am?”
Draco and Blaise watched as a man tried the jacket on with the help of a shop attendant. The shop attendant was touting all the great features of the jacket and how it wasn’t for everyone. When the attendant stepped away, Blaise stepped into view in the mirror the man was looking in. He caught the man’s eye and shook his head in the negative.
“You know it’s true love when I let you wrinkle my shirt with no complaints.” Draco said looking down at his shirt before stepping out the door. The last thing he heard was Harry’s delighted laugh.
“This is the smallest, saddest tree you have, Severus.” A man with salt and pepper hair said tiredly, if not amusedly.
He glanced up and put the sheet music back in the box after giving it a once over. He made sure to lock the box once more. He quickly walked over to the harp, sat in the seat, pulling the harp to him and starting to strum.
“I don’t know what you are or where you came from or who sent you here. I just want you to hurry up with whatever you’re here to do because there’s no time to lose.” Harry said agitated.
Draco quickly walked passed Blaise and left the drawing room to quickly head upstairs. Draco didn’t even hear Harry calling out to him. Harry had just entered the front door when he saw Draco run up the stairs. When he looked in the drawing room he saw Blaise standing next to a Christmas tree.
Scorpius set his over night bag down, which a house elf quickly appeared and disappeared with. His father usually appeared a few minutes after he arrived home. He was taking longer than usual. Hopefully his father was fine and just sorting out his guest.
“All you had to do was walk over to the bed.” Harry pointed out as he ran a hand through the blond’s hair.
“Right.” Draco said. He hummed when Harry kissed him one last time. The other man reluctantly let him go.
“I love you. So much.” Harry said with conviction instead of answering the question. Draco looked at him with worry.
“We should get to class.” Draco said absentmindedly. Harry hummed and walked them over to the posh couch. He sat down and Draco draped himself over him.
“A massage then.” Harry said happily as he finally stood up. He held his hand out for Draco to take.
Harry walked in the house and immediately called out for Draco. He looked around the ground floor and then started to head up the stairs. He heard a noise behind him and turned.
She walked into the Great Hall and headed straight for the Slytherin table. Conversation dimmed down as everyone was trying to figure out what she was doing. She made eye contact with Draco. All she had to do was give him an exasperated look and a head tilt. He immediately stood up also with an exasperated look and followed her out of the Hall.
“I didn’t say that, Harry. This isn’t exactly my strongest department for advice.” Remus said with a shake of his head. Harry stood up to pace.
When he opened the box there was folded sheet music in it for the harp. He read the small note at the top of the page and raised an eyebrow in surprise. This was a love note from a man that wasn’t Mrs. McGonagall’s late husband.
“I’m tired of wandering. I’m tired of an existence of neutrality.” Blaise said as he stepped closer to Draco. Draco took a step back.
Harry started walking around his office looking and feeling lost. He looked at a large photo he had of Draco that was on a side table. But then he turned his attention to a large portrait of the future Auror office that Mrs. McGonagall commissioned.
He jerked his head up and scrubbed his hands over his face. He then looked around his office as if he was supposed to be doing something. He walked out of his office. When he looked at the stairs he suddenly ran up.
Once he healed and was discharged from the hospital, he had immediately hired the best physiotherapist. This man was renowned throughout Europe, mainly mainland Europe. Injured players clambered for this doctor’s attention. Harry knew he paid a small fortune for this guy but he felt restless and useless when not flying. Imagine his shock at having Draco Malfoy appear at his home and tell him he was his physiotherapist. The blond had given him a raised eyebrow and told him he could refund him most of his money but he’d take a small stipend for travel expenses. Harry had quickly shut that idea down and invited Malfoy in.
“Should we expect Mr. Malfoy to make more appearances?” Ginny teased as she walked over to the kitchen.
“What should I do?” Harry murmured, resting his hands on the fireplace mantel. His eyes widened when the picture seemed to glow. He stared in amazement but snapped out of it when he heard his office door open and close.
“You can open your eyes, love.” Harry said. He knew the moment Draco realized where they were when the hand he had been holding to lead the blond squeezed his hand in surprise.
Scorpius gave his Father a thumbs up, a habit he picked up from Al, and turned once more to head to his room. He’ll have to message Al and see how his friend’s doing. And tell him that their dad’s being friends worked.
“What’s wrong?” Draco asked giving Harry a visual once over. Before he could walk closer Harry brought what he was holding in front of him.
“No I- yes.” She tried to decline but when she looked up at Blaise she was compelled to meet with her visitors.
“Hello. Mrs. McGonagall? Yes I must speak with you, this afternoon if possible. No?” Harry asked. Blaise tilted his head. “Five? That’s perfect. I’ll see you at your home at five o’clock. Good bye.”
“Well... you could eat at the Slytherin table if you promise not to attack, maim, kill, or death glare at Blaise.” Draco said.
“I’ve been friends with Draco for a little while now.” Harry said as he walked into the room. “So poison oak and poison ivy?”
Blaise hurried out of the office to the hallway closet to retrieve his coat. As he was putting it on he felt hands helping him put it on. He turned to see Luna helping him.
“If he loves you as much as you love him, which I suspect is how much he loves you, then I have no reason to hurt him.” Hermione said. “Now I need to go return this and head back up to Ron... How do you want to tell Ron?”
“You’re up to something.” Draco stated when they got back to the blond’s flat from having Christmas brunch with Narcissa, Andromeda, and Teddy.
“Nothing’s wrong. Calm down.” Scorpius said, patting his father’s shoulder. Draco fell back on the bed.
“Do your friends even know about us? Your family?” Draco asked quietly. He didn’t like the frown on Harry’s face but they both knew actions had consequences especially for those closest to them.
“Luna.” Harry said sounding scandalized at hearing the girl say shagging. He was used to it from Ginny but not from her wife.
“Can we serve dinner? If we wait any longer the chicken will over cook.” Luna said from the doorway.
“Still get jealous, Potter?” Draco asked amused. Harry just reached across the table and held the blond’s hand.
“Of course.” Severus said sounding bored as he walked out to the tree in question leaving Draco and Remus alone.
“Me too.” Blaise said. “Oh and people are speculating that Draco is in love with Granger and that he’s leaving me for her.”
“Well...” Blaise said with a smirk as he broke away from Draco to execute an aerial spin jump. Draco shook his head in disbelief.
“You want to earn it on your own.” Harry said. The blond nodded. “I know. That’s why I left it up to you. If you wanted you could sell it for my autograph alone. Just void the cheque first.” He smiled when Draco chuckled.
“Well that could have gone better.” Harry said as he headed back to the drawing room, Draco following after him after shutting the door.
“What happened?” Harry asked startled wanting to hug his blond but not wanting to irritate him. Luckily Draco took that decision out of his hands and wrapped his arms around him and clung to him.
“For why?” Draco asked, hesitant to take anything. It looked too good to eat. Potter poured syrup over Draco’s perfectly presented French toast and slid the plate and fork closer to him.
“Harry, staying for dinner?” Narcissa asked. She kept from smirking at the slight panicked look. “I spoke to your mother.”
“I spoke to Mrs. McGonagall. She’s definitely on board and I should have the funds in a few days.” Harry said.
“Congratulations on getting married between breakfast and Arithmancy?” Blaise said questioningly with a raised eyebrow.
“You don’t want me to do that. How would you explain it?” The man asked amused. “Tell the world you’re being visited by an angel? You can’t do that.” The man headed towards the office door, Harry trailing after him. The office door suddenly opened.
“Draco, we’ve known each other for most of our lives. We’ve seen each other at our best, our worst, and everywhere in between. I’d like to continue seeing the best and worst of you for the rest of my life.” Harry said. He then flipped the lid of the box open and presented it to Draco. “Will you marry me?”
“I appreciate your appreciation but where are the funds for the new building?” Harry asked rhetorically.
“If this is your way of proposing though, I don’t know if I should say yes. I’m not even wearing a ring after saying yes.” Draco said looking at his bare left ring finger.
“I don’t know. I just suddenly wanted to feel happy and having you in my arms makes me feel happy.” Harry said. Draco blushed.
“Apparently during study hall Zabini had held Malfoy’s hand up to get a closer look at the ring. So of course it would be taken out of context.” Hermione said sounding annoyed. “Harry James Potter you are Not. Allowed. To. Attack. Zabini.”
“You know I don’t like going to these events alone.” Draco said. Their attention turned to look at Blaise who had stepped closer to them. Harry’s face turned stony.
She smirked at the scandalized look Draco had on his face before she shut the door gently. She hoped Harry wouldn’t suffocate himself with how hard he was pressing the pillow against his face. She headed back down to start over the chapter she had been reading. Hopefully Lucius wasn’t waiting for attention.
Fleur stepped back and indicated to them to follow her. Draco nodded at three people sitting at a table as they walked by. Their eyes followed Draco and Blaise as they were sat at a table within eyesight of them.
“There’s certain attention I like, especially attention that I dictate.” Draco said from inside the bathroom. “Did you see their faces?”
“I don’t know. Holding hands is so intimate. That may be going too far, Potter.” Draco said looking down at their hands and then looking up at Harry with a mischievous look. “Not to mention that the majority of time when we’re holding hands one of us is usually balls deep in the other.”
“Anyway, you know how I feel.” Harry said. Blaise nodded and then turned to head to the door. “Wait a minute! There’s another thing.” Harry said as he pointed the key at Blaise.
“Your mother said you might as well stay here while she cools down.” Narcissa says looking at Harry. “And kills your father.” She added thoughtfully.
“My name is Blaise.” Blaise said as he joined her on the couch. “Now tell me about the man who wrote that music.”
Harry nodded at all his teammates as the announcer started listing players. He knew his name being called last was due to being a seeker but it felt more dramatic when the announcer gave a longer pause than usual. He shook his head amused and kicked off to do a circuit of the pitch as the crowd went wild. He didn’t even try to hide his joyful grin at being back. He flew to his starting position after completing the circuit and looked over to the family area where a certain blond was. He had enough time to roll his eyes at the fact that Malfoy was still wearing his jacket instead of showing off Harry’s jersey. When the snitch was released his entire focus shifted. The whistle blew.
Walking forward , something silently slipped out of his hand to soundlessly drop on the carpeted floor.
Draco didn't say anything but the look in his eyes gave Hermione and everyone else the feeling of being soothed and enveloped in a warm blanket . This was the feeling of being Draco Malfoy's person, they understood . This was the feeling of being under the wings of the famed notorious and heartless Slytherin price, so absurdly warm.
Draco shrugged his hand off and turned around to face him . His eyes were glowing as if containing silver embers . Mouth set in a scowl and muscles all over his body tight as he said ," keep your hand to yourself , Potter . They won't be attached to your body the next time " ; His voice low and tight .
And this , people , was how Draco unknowingly picked up not only an ancient monster but literally a god to be his father .
Harry's eyes trailed down , his gaze caressing every part of Draco's body , lingering on his consumable lips and beautiful collarbone.
Soon the door opened and Pansy Parkinson , Blaise Zambini and Theodore Nott entered . As soon as they caught the sight of Harry , their wands were out while complete shielding Draco behind them.
"Have you heard of The Golden Warrior? Eloise Herewósa, The Great Golden Warrior ! That who I am.", The voice boasts with a prideful and awe-inspiring tone.
How did he get those? Who poisoned him? Draco urgently needed to examine what kind of poison it was to make an antidote .
" Let the events take their course . All we ask you is to keep an eye out for the younger students. Keep them safe and mostly let the teacher's take the action" Harry continued.
Harry sighed. How is he going to survive not touching him? His existence is like an aphrodisiac made especially for Harry.
Hermione shook out of her daze to see Pansy waiting for her. She must have clearly heard their conversation.
Others looked after her curiously, several moments passed and Hermione came out again with a book in her hands.
- Draco's gentle control and Harry's hard control dynamics . So , basically Draco is the softer , gentler leader whereas Harry's the harder and tougher leader. They balance each other out. Like a king and queen , you can say.
