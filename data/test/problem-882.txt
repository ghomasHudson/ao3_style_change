“Just the one?” Draco snickers, the thought of Harry’s rubbish love life making him gleeful.
“Yeah, I do.” Boldly, Harry puts his hands on Draco’s waist and pulls him closer. “So what?”
“Take it however you want.” Harry refuses to let Draco see how much he unsettles him. He tries to imagine Draco’s life after the war, taking another tiny sip of his drink. “I can’t imagine living like that. To be split down the middle, constantly watching your words and making up stories about places you went, things you did and people you met.”
His chest is tight, his palms clammy. Fear rolls through him and he can’t stop the shame that claws through him. It’s as though he’s putting his sex life on display, something intimate and personal up for judgment.
not turning—” Draco stops. “Doing what wrong?”
“I’m sure you don’t.” Harry sounds amused. He flicks the wand, sending a powerful hum of magic through the shop without uttering a word. He’s such a bloody show-off, Draco refuses to display even a flicker of respect. He keeps his expression cool and crosses his arms to avoid yanking Harry closer to explore what other tricks he has up his sleeve. “This will do. This will do very nicely indeed. What’s the core?”
Harry’s been looking for. The whole mess of his life is upturned and on display, but finally unearthing the truths he's been trying to bury doesn’t make it easier. The realisation that everything has changed irrevocably has hit him with full, devastating force. He can go back to before, but he’ll
“Not nearly pissed enough for this conversation.” Draco drains his drink.
“A different gorgeous George,” George clarifies. “Less gorgeous than me, mind.”
“Okay.” Harry runs his fingers over Draco’s chest. “I should have told you everything the minute it happened. I just hate moping around people. It’s embarrassing, losing my job and sitting around in my underpants staring at the wall. It’s hard to let anyone see the fucked-up parts, not just you.”
“He misses having a partner in crime.” Ron winces, obviously realising
“Queer?” Harry doesn’t say it with a spit and a hiss like some people do. He says it like it’s part of him. He opens his eyes, blinking at Draco. “Dunno. The press is bound to get wind of it eventually. I don’t care what strangers think about me.”
“Nearly one in the morning.” Harry turns to find Draco standing so close it sends a pulse of lust through his body. “Did you really come here to talk?”
“I’m not very good at delicate,” Harry replies. His hands are clammy, and he puts his coffee down before he spills it all over himself. “I’m like a bull in a china shop most of the time.”
Draco pulls off Harry for just long enough to murmur a familiar spell, then returns to his task. He pushes two slick fingers into Harry’s relaxed body, sucking him into the back of his throat.
things.
.” Draco glares at Harry. “I don’t want you to lose your job. For some unfathomable reason you seem to enjoy it, and you’re not going to be able to help any of us that end up in Azkaban if you lose all your clout with the Ministry.”
Draco’s eyes darken. “Stay still. Don’t touch yourself.”
He stops. His body begins to adjust to the unfamiliar sensation and it’s not quite so uncomfortable anymore. A desperate hunger crawls through him and he wriggles experimentally, pushing his arse back towards Draco.
“Because I come here all the time.” Harry shrugs. “Best hot chocolate in the UK if you ask me. Miles better than the stuff in Diagon. Rubbish coffee, though.”
“Well.” Harry clears his throat, rooting around in his pocket. Part of him wants to Apparate away, panic welling in his chest.
“If you like,” Draco says. “You’ve still got to see The Unspeakable too.”
Nope. Why Jean-Paul?
“You’re such a prick,” Draco replies. Pink spots rise on his cheekbones and his lips narrow. He grips his mug of tea tight enough that his knuckles turn even whiter than usual.
“The legislation
Harry swallows his tea so quickly he nearly scalds himself.
“Nothing. You, being here.”
Draco shakes his head. “It wasn’t. I’d never have bothered to learn how to get Muggle technology to work in a magical property if it hadn’t been for Astoria. I’ve never much cared for Muggle things, you know that. I spent months on the spells, making the space as comfortable as it could be.”
“I didn’t mean to,” Harry insists. “I’ve got no idea how it happened, one minute he was—”
“Yeah, it’s my room.” Harry watches Draco poke around, the nosy fucker. “I told you I needed some interior design tips. Maybe you can recommend some fancy art, so I can take old Walburga down. I put her in the room at the back that never gets used, but I still know she’s there. She doesn’t half give me the creeps.”
“Wishful thinking,” Harry replies. He gives Draco a small smile. “That’s all.”
“Gryffindors do tend to wear their bleeding hearts on their sleeves,” Draco agrees. “Just be very choosy about the people you trust. You know the Aurors use Glamours to flirt with men in Knockturn only to arrest them as soon as their interest is reciprocated. That’s how Roger was caught soliciting. They tried to claim he was resisting arrest, when it was three against one and all he wanted to do was get them off him.”
“Aren’t we?” Harry drops his arm and has another swig of his beer. “Sorry.”
Talking to Ginny lately is like clutching a fistful of sand and watching the grains slowly slip through his fingers. The tighter he holds on, the more he loses.
“I don’t go to Muggle bars.”
, Harry.” Ginny gives Harry a watery smile and the tension snaps out of his body, leaving him aching with relief. He’s so tired. So tired of fighting the desperate itch beneath his skin, of pushing back the questions in his mind.
“Aurors,” Harry whispers. A wave of nausea rolls through him, his skin hot.
“I don’t like to have long conversations about who I am or what I want. I’d prefer not to talk about it at all, just get on with it.”
“As if. They’re my specialty.” Harry’s already looking forward to seeing George and Lee again. It really has been too long since he’s gone out and had fun. Draco doesn’t count. Eating tapas and having weird, uncomfortable conversations in the huge dining room in Malfoy Manor probably isn’t what Hermione had in mind when she told Harry to let his hair down.
“I organised the ball tonight,” Lee says. “I’m walking in the Butch Queen category, naturally”
“I hauled Dawlish in to reprimand him about that, not that it did much good.” Once again, a hot fury curls within Harry. He’s part of the actions taken against people like Roger. Directly or not, it’s his team policing Knockturn, on his watch. “They usually listen to me or come to me directly if they disagree with my approach, but not on this. I haven’t been involved with Knockturn in years. I was attacked shortly after the war and the Ministry felt it was a security risk to have me working in that area, not to mention my face is too familiar. Dawlish has always run stuff over there. It doesn’t help that Robards keeps overruling me.”
“I know it’s going to miss you,” Harry replies. “We all are.”
“Oh.” Draco sounds surprised. “I like it the way we just did it once in a while. But for the most part…”
“Another bar. A
“I don’t want to hear it, son.” Arthur’s face pales as he looks at George. “Great Merlin, is that why you’re here too? Have the two of you been—?”
“I used to think it was a punishment, for all the things I did during the war.” Draco’s jaw works.
“It was supposed to help.” Harry swallows back a wave of anger at the futility of the situation. Hermione and her team worked themselves into the ground for this. “All the lobbying, all the work. For what? It sounds as though things are worse than ever.”
sex before, Malfoy. You invited me round to fuck—dead romantic of you by the way—now you’re being noble again.”
and there’s no doubt in his mind that this is something Harry enjoys. Draco knows men’s bodies. He knows the places he needs to find, the different spots that make a person lose their mind and the best way to read someone when they’re being kissed, touched and fucked.
He’s also stupidly attractive, not that Harry would let that be the determining factor. It certainly doesn’t hurt, though. Harry grins at the memory of the previous night, the slow, searching kisses as they lay in Draco’s bed and used their hands to bring one another off. In one way it wasn’t the most intimate thing they’ve ever done, in other ways it was more intimate than they’ve ever been. For the first time in ages Harry is happy. Really, really happy.
“I can be pretty considerate in the right circumstances.” Harry puts his arm back and the smile on his face is positively filthy. “Wouldn’t you say?”
, that Harry Potter,’ he’d say. He used to talk about you every Sunday lunch.”
“Do I have to do everything around here?” Draco’s cheeks are even redder now. “Use your imagination, I’ll tell you if you’re being a clumsy oaf.”
Aside from the irritating image of a triumphant Harry holding the Snitch aloft, Draco’s quite excited about the event. Some big names are returning for the occasion and even if Quidditch at Hogwarts brings back a lot of complicated memories for Draco, time and distance have helped. Besides, gone are the days when Draco would quibble over playing favourites or expect to be at the centre of such a high-profile event. He knows how fortunate he is to be accepted as a retailer at Hogsmeade.
“Did you stay because of my owl?” Harry’s stomach rolls at the idea that his desperate attempt to get a response from Draco might have been the final nail in the coffin. “I only sent it because I didn’t know what else to do. I hoped you might respond, but you never did.”
must be right about magical education going downhill faster than a herd of rampaging mountain trolls.”
He’s not one for public displays of affection, but to be so carefully non-tactile doesn’t suit Harry in the slightest. He never realised how much he took for granted with Ginny. He could take her hand across the table when she smiled at him or wrap his arms around her on a cold day. He enjoyed those tiny gestures in a way he only realises with hindsight. The hand on someone’s back, the clutch of gloved hands, the light kisses. Being able to hug someone when they look sad, without caring who’s around. Even looking at Draco fondly or talking too openly within earshot of others could be dangerous.
“Oh.” Harry isn’t sure he’s ever met anyone that doesn’t care about marriage, apart from Ginny who flinches at the mention of it. Molly’s always on at him to pop the question and even Hermione dropped hints the other day about how nice a ruby ring would look with Ginny’s hair. “Even if you were allowed to?”
“Don’t I?” Harry’s voice is calm but there’s a hum of tension in the air. He’s worked in interrogation for long enough to know when he’s being goaded. He stands and moves close to Draco, until he’s backed against the wall. He puts his palm flat beside Draco’s head, taking in the flash of his eyes and the way his breath becomes unsteady. “You’re so full of shit. I’m not sure what you think you’re going to achieve by riling me up.”
“No.” Harry shakes his head. “We’re not engaged. Ginny isn’t interested in all that. She says she’s too young, and it would spoil her roast potatoes.” He laughs. “I think she was joking about the last part.”
“You’re awake.” Harry holds up the Proust he’s obviously helped himself to from Draco’s bedside table and waves it in Draco’s general direction. “Are all your books this boring? I’m not surprised you fell asleep. I’ve read reports about Niffler shit that were more interesting.”
Harry grins, even as the solid weight of Draco’s body leaves his breathing ragged. “Pretty confident aren’t you, Malfoy?”
“Please,” Harry says. It makes Draco’s fingers tighten on his hips and he smiles to himself. “Please fuck me.”
Harry swallows. It’s the second time in as many weeks that Ginny’s mentioned how rubbish London is. No matter how hard he tries he can’t picture Ginny holed up in the shadowy rooms of Grimmauld Place, helping Harry entertain their friends in the way Molly and Arthur do with such generosity. Like marriage, the conversation about living together—and where—is one they both seem content to put off.
“Anything.” Harry’s hand tightens around the t-shirt clutched uselessly in his hand. The memory of Draco pressing him against the wall comes flooding back.
“It’s not like you to give up on something just because it’s difficult,” Draco points out.
Harry looks up to see Molly and Arthur standing awkwardly next to the booth he and Draco settled in towards the end of the night.
“I don’t have any friends left in England.” Draco answers Harry’s question at last. “Apart from you.”
“I’d never thought of it like that,” Harry murmurs.
“Probably not, but you were always going to, let’s be honest.” Harry tries not to let his anger get the better of him but it’s difficult. “Come on. We might as well get this over with.”
“You speak French, don’t you?”
“I should be getting off—err—home. I should be getting home.” Harry speaks quickly, heat rising in his cheeks.
“You still have your job,” Harry says, with more confidence than he feels. “It’ll work itself out.”
. He used to crave it desperately, but somewhere along the way things shifted around and now the idea makes him want to go flying over crashing waves, diving headfirst into the oncoming rain, until the wind pulls all the breath from his aching lungs. He’s been with Ginny since the war and he can’t imagine a life without her, but over the years their lives have become increasingly separate: Ginny living in Wales, focusing on her career with the Harpies with determined enthusiasm, Harry throwing himself into his work at the Ministry. Spending every weekend together soon dwindled into seeing one another once a month or less, filling the gaps with rushed Fire-Calls.
Harry can’t bring himself to say it. He doesn’t even know what he and Draco are, only that they’re something. Something exclusive, something that made him happy, something he still can’t put into words. It’s so new and tentative.
“Yeah.” Harry takes a shaky breath.
“Something about timing. Apparently Bulstrode thinks I can afford a yacht.”
“Not so different to us wizards then,” Harry murmurs. He slides the wand between his fingers and casts a sharp, crisp
“I used to say a lot of things,” Draco murmurs. His gaze sweeps across Harry’s face before travelling lower. It would be so easy to step forward, to trace the line of Draco’s jaw and urge his mouth closer.
“Not cerebral enough for you?”
“Then what is it?” Draco can feel the swell of Harry’s cock, heavy against his thigh. “You definitely like it.”
“In a manner of speaking.” Draco frowns and picks at a small speck of dust on his trousers. “The papers got it all wrong. They made it sound like I was in Paris for the parties, the
Harry presses closer, close enough that Draco’s breath warms his cheeks. They’re almost the same height, and Draco’s lips are just there, damp and inviting.
Harry’s breath catches in his throat and he presses against Draco. “Bit presumptuous of you, Malfoy.”
“I told you I still have some friends left, shocking as that probably is to you,” Draco points out.
“Keep them open,” Harry says, his voice gruff. “Look at me.”
Did you like this bloke at school?
“I know—” Harry breaks off with a groan, pressing a line of hot kisses over Draco’s throat. “It’s…intimate.”
“I did, didn’t I?” Draco leans forward, his eyes glinting. “It felt rather good.”
Cursing under his breath, Harry tugs on his dressing gown and shoves his wand into the pocket.
Draco nods, his expression grim. “Do you even care about this job of yours? With this house and the Black inheritance, I can’t imagine you need the money.”
“Either of us?” Pleasure worms through Harry, a flicker of anticipation and hope chasing away the dark thoughts from before.
“I know.” Draco’s voice is quiet. “I think McGonagall would give you a chance, if you wanted it.”
“The one that counted.” Harry nods towards the bar where Ginny Weasley and Luna Lovegood are arguing with Parkinson of all people. “Luna’s bisexual, so you’re wrong about the lesbian thing too.”
I went to see an old acquaintance this morning. I needed something to clear my head.
“If that’s supposed to impress me, it doesn’t.” Harry slips off his outer robes and steps inside. He watches as Draco sends his robes off to Merlin knows where. Harry is suddenly awkward in his jeans, comfortable jumper and tattered Muggle trainers. Draco always looks so polished.
Mondays are rubbish. It’s mornings like this I wish I had something warmer than a Quick-Match Quill to curl up with. The feathers don’t half make me itch.
“I’m sure it wouldn’t take you long to find if you put your mind to it.”
“Nope. It sounds like the kind of thing someone pretends to like when they’re a stuck-up twat. I’m betting it’s all porn and Rom-Coms. Do your house-elves make you dinner every night?”
“I only know the edited highlights, remember?” Harry gives Draco a small smile. “Go on, then. Ask away.”
, no it’s nothing to do with me.” George shoots Harry a panicked look. “I’m here for moral support. To lend an ear. The good one.” He laughs nervously but nobody else joins in.
and throws it across the desk in Harry’s direction.
The last couple of weeks have forced Harry to stop prevaricating. He knows what he is and no amount of fighting, crying and railing against it will change anything. He’s gay. He’s gay and the legislation that makes saying that out loud a crime isn’t going to change anytime soon. His life feels like a pile of overturned boxes and empty cupboards, but all his soul-searching has finally revealed the
“I’d sooner be a Gryffindor than allow Potter to put me in handcuffs,” Draco replies. The smirk on his face suggests the statement might not be strictly true.
Spurred on by Draco’s encouragement, Harry decides not to try to run before he can walk. Draco doesn’t seem to mind his clumsy first blow job, with Harry’s mouth slick and stretched. To the contrary, he seems to be enjoying everything Harry tries, and with quiet
. “It sounds serious,” he says, lightly.
“For a pub quiz?” Harry laughs. “Hardly, mate.”
“This.” Harry wets his lips and tugs at the knot in Draco’s robe, using it to pull Draco close. “Please fuck me. Just…fuck me.”
Because it still makes Harry horny as fuck, he responds with a fierce kiss. He grunts when Draco begins to wank him off properly, the filthy slick and slap of their hands and the puffs of their breath loud in the quiet space. They stroke each other with practiced familiarity, re-learning the all the things that used to make one another gasp, twist and buck. Harry loves the velvet slide of Draco’s cock between his fingers, the messiness of the lube. His pleasure mounts as Draco breaks away from the kiss, arching as if he’s imagining Harry’s cock sinking into his body. With a murmur of encouragement, Harry takes the opportunity to taste the light perspiration on the pale arch of Draco’s neck. He sucks barely-there blooms of red onto Draco’s throat and breathes in the rich, expensive scent of him.
“Don’t be daft. I’m fine,” Harry lies. “I’m not calling for sympathy. Kingsley reckons they’ll keep it hush-hush so the press don’t get wind, but Robards is going to have to tell Ron why they got rid of me. He still thinks we’re together. Everyone does,” he finishes miserably.
“—Excuse me.” A witch appears beside them, holding out a beer mat with a trembling hand. It takes a great deal of effort for Draco not to start throwing hexes. “Can you sign this for me please?”
“I don’t understand why you and your Weasleys have had such a sudden change of heart where I’m concerned.”
It’s all so out of sync, so wonky. Harry doesn’t really know himself yet and everything has a restless, agitated quality, like he’s overturning boxes and emptying cupboards just to find something that’s always out of reach. As much as he loves being around the Weasleys, he can’t picture himself with the family set-up so many of them have. From the few awkward conversations he’s had with Ginny about taking the next step in their relationship, she seems equally unenthused.
around her neck. The rubies and diamonds glimmer in the soft candlelight. Hermione was right. It really does look beautiful with her hair.
pair that George gave him last Christmas.
“I don’t want you to stop seeing your friends,” Harry continues. “They obviously miss you.”
“Oh.” Harry helps himself to the last prawn before Malfoy eats them all. They really are delicious. Plump, succulent and garlicky. He never wants the meal to end. “One night I’ll have to get you pissed on lager and take you for a kebab.”
“Thanks.” Harry extends his hand to Ron, who shakes it. “Good night, isn’t it?”
“I’m glad you’re here.” Draco studies the television screen, without looking at Harry. “I haven’t used this room in a long time.”
“Yeah. I really do.” Harry grins at Draco. “You don’t have to switch things up on my account, not unless you fancy it. Seems we agree on something for once.”
“You always say the nicest things.” Draco laughs and it’s so bright and unexpected, it makes Harry laugh too. When the laughter fades away, Draco runs his tongue over his lips. “That fucking
“Fuck the form.” Harry whoops with delight. “Good old Fawkes to the rescue again.”
“You sound just like McGonagall.” Harry grins. “I thought she was going to have kittens. I decided it was best not to mention I was flying a Hippogriff at the time.”
you need me to attend to, I work from home on Thursday afternoons.”
Draco seems pleased by the revelation. He pulls on a pair of Harry’s jogging bottoms and doesn’t even comment on the indignity of wearing Gryffindor colours, which is definite progress. After he leaves the room to make breakfast, Harry stands and opens the bedroom window.
awful—but you can’t tell anyone. Mum and Dad would—” she breaks into a sob, dropping her head into her hands as her shoulders shake.
“They’re very enthusiastic.” Kingsley laughs under his breath. He clears his throat, something obviously on his mind. “There was one thing I wanted to raise with you.”
“What the hell do you mean by that?” Draco growls. He gets out of bed and tugs on some pyjama bottoms because if he’s about to get dumped after less than twenty-four hours, he at least wants to avoid the indignity of being naked to boot. Heat rises in his cheeks as he thinks of the countless Evaporates they’ve exchanged. “A distinctive
“Will you fuck me tonight?” Harry turns quickly enough that he almost slips, Draco’s hand on his waist keeping him steady. He circles his fingers around Draco’s cock and meets his questioning gaze. “Please?”
“Look—” Harry stops, clearly searching for the right words. “I might not have been around for a while, but that doesn’t mean I don’t know what the last few years have been like for you.”
“How’s your
“I’m sorry,” Harry says at last.
He lands in Grimmauld Place and walks heavily up the stairs and strips off his clothes. He turns on the shower, standing beneath it. He trembles as he lets the water sluice over the aching parts of his body that he can’t bring himself to touch.
“Is that so?” Draco tries to keep his expression implacable. The bloody nerve of it. Harry might have informed him they were
Harry rubs his chin, swallowing back another wave of fear as he tries to think rationally. He’s worked as an Auror for long enough that he would have known if anybody was nearby, lurking in the shadows. He would have sensed it.
. “Are you into fucking in silence?”
Potter.”
“I suppose one more couldn’t hurt.” Draco takes a quick look at his watch. He was due to open the shop five minutes ago, but considering he only has himself to answer to, he supposes he can extend his lunch for a short while longer. It’s nearly the holidays after all. When the waitress brings them both a mug of hot chocolate, he looks at Harry’s curiously. “How do they know what you want?”
,” Ginny pleads. “Oh Merlin, Harry.” She speaks around a hiccup, her voice quiet. “I don’t think I like wizards very much,” she says in a rush. “Or I like them well enough, but not like you’re meant to. Not like you deserve.”
“I wish we could have talked about this.” Harry clenches his jaw, the futility of the situation overwhelming him. “We could have sorted it out. We were good together.”
“Yeah. The staff have the day off.” Harry gives Draco a curious look. “What’s on your mind?”
“I suppose I should leave you to it,” Draco says, gruffly. He pats his tangled hair, his cheeks turning red when he appears to remember what caused the uncharacteristic messiness in the first place. “What are you going to do?”
“Oh yeah.” Harry gives Draco a strange look and then holds out his hand. “Call me Harry. Isn’t this Malfoy and Potter business getting a bit old?”
“Friends?” Draco tries to stamp down a flash of jealousy because he knows he doesn’t have the right. He glances at the sofa, wondering how many other men Harry has had here with his sexy magic and unshakable confidence.
“You can’t blame them.” Ron looks up at Harry, his cheeks flushed with anger. “They don’t know what to make of it, they thought you and Ginny were happy for fuck’s sake. We all did.”
“I got your usual.” George stands and gives Harry a quick handshake, sliding in next to Lee to give Harry the seat next to Draco.
“They won’t stop. Not even on your say-so. Part of me thinks they enjoy it.” Lee shrugs and watches Draco at the bar, his expression concerned. “I’m not sure Malfoy’s okay even if he’s pretending to be. It’s why I wanted him to bring him here tonight. I’ve never seen him stay away from Knockturn for this long.”
“Not if we kill each other first,” Harry mutters.
“Thank you for reminding me, Potter.” With a huff, Draco stands, a waft of woody musk and expensive scent filling Harry’s senses. He walks to the window and looks out as the rain batters against the panes. “We argued about telling people, all the time. I was convinced you were bound to leave me for someone easier, without my complications.”
Harry supposes it would be rude to say no.
He must get you worked up if you can’t wait to Apparate home.
“Plenty. Some.” Draco rubs a hand over his eyes, his erection not quite as pronounced as a moment ago. Potter has likely shagged on every continent and Draco doesn’t want to upset the balance by sharing his own experience or lack thereof. “Do we have to do this?”
“I wish.” Harry shakes his head. “I can’t just make laws by myself. I’d have to lobby for the law to be changed and that wouldn’t exactly be discreet.”
“Most likely.” Draco pushes a hand through his damp hair and pulls a face. “I don’t imagine it would be a regular occurrence. Just a visit, every now and then. Civility is all I ask for.”
“You didn’t, then?” Draco’s lips tilt into a strange smile, his eyes trailing over Harry. “How curious.”
“Oh, I wanted to check something.” Harry waves a dismissive hand. “It doesn’t matter, I’m all set now. Bon voyage, Malfoy.”
“I don’t care about the new legislation!” Arthur bellows. “It doesn’t apply to Aurors, and for good reason. Your job is to protect the people you work alongside, to spend time in close quarters with members of your team without becoming distracted. You’re supposed to be protecting people like my son, not thinking about…other things.”
, Malfoy. I’ve been trying to shove this down, pretend it wasn’t there, hide it away from myself—not to mention everybody else—for years.”
“A brand-new Barnabas Barista.”
“In time.” Draco swallows the last of his tea. “I don’t want to talk about Astoria anymore. Please.”
“I am when I’m in bed with you,” Draco counters. From the laugh that huffs against his skin, he’s confident Harry doesn’t believe him for a moment.
“I didn’t want to hide. I never wanted that.” The fury rolls off Harry, crashing over him in waves. “I hated sneaking around, pretending to go our separate ways after work and dancing with everyone who asked at Ministry events because you couldn’t bear to be photographed too close to me.”
,” Harry repeats. Heat rises in his cheeks and he fights it back. “Our laws on this particular issue can only be enforced in magical spaces. Diagon, Hogsmeade, Hogwarts and so on. There’s something of a grey area around places that are predominantly magical with some Muggle inhabitants, but we’ll cross that bridge when we come to it.”
Draco takes the offered hand and shakes it. Harry’s palm is cold and damp from the beer. “Is this intended to be symbolic?”
I like flirting. Do you get off on it?
“Thursday’s the new Friday.” Draco pours them both a generous glass of wine and puts the bottle back in the bucket. “I thought you hated wine.”
“It’s not a game of chess, Malfoy.” Harry rolls his eyes.
He’s about to go upstairs when he catches sight of card at the very bottom of the box. He takes it out carefully, a lump rising in his throat. On the front is a picture of a dragon. Like many magical cards, it swoops and turns, its tail flicking. It breathes a huff of fire and the card turns warm in Harry’s hands.
“I was thinking.” Harry settles on the sofa and reaches for Draco when he looks like he’s going to sit on the armchair. “Do you have to be so far away?”
“Dad, don’t.” George stands and puts his hand on Arthur’s shoulder. “Please just let him tell you.”
“You’re different.” Draco waves a hand. “You’re not sniffing around trying to make an arrest. At least I hope you won’t be. I wouldn’t want to compromise your position as the world’s most insufferable do-gooder, but I expect you to turn a blind eye for one night. Consider it your evening off.”
When Draco begins fucking Harry properly with his fingers, he thinks he’s going to lose his mind. His desire spirals and twists through him, the heavy sound of their breathing mingling together in the quiet room. He half wants to beg Draco to fuck him harder, to beg for more, hotter, filthier, dirtier. But he knows he’s so close to the edge, he’s not sure he could take Draco’s cock inside his body without coming before they even start. He grips onto the sheets, an
Draco rolls his eyes. “I couldn’t care less what you do, I was just trying to make conversation.”
,” Draco snaps. “Why on earth would he protect me?”
“Yes.” Draco nods, guiltily. “I’ve known from the start.”
The words whisper and twist in his head, slithering like Parseltongue.
When they finally break apart, Draco looks faintly embarrassed. He ducks his head and picks up his belt from where Harry discarded it, a flush rising in his cheeks. He threads it back through the loops and buckles it with more avid attention than it warrants, his throat bobbing. Harry tugs up his joggers as Draco looks around with a frown, eventually spotting his wand and pocketing it.
“I think we’re a few drinks away from
with a picture of his kiss with Draco on the front page.
Somewhere between paragraphs the writing gets blurred and Draco’s eyes grow heavy. After another few moments of struggling to read, he closes his book and curls closer to Harry.
“Got it.” Lee’s eyes are warm and sympathetic when he looks at Harry. “Maybe you can find a way to bring this new bloke of yours out to Knockturn one night, Malfoy. You seem pretty serious about him.”
“There’s no need to be sarcastic,” Harry mutters. “You’ve got my attention. I’ll do better.”
I was different then. I could be unkind. There were things I did and said that I regret. I’d rather forget them.
At the same time, it’s an anti-climactic moment. Harry can’t reach across to squeeze Draco’s hand, or thank him for trying to protect Harry from his own unflinching honesty. He can’t slide an arm across the back of the seat and lean close to Draco, whispering something that’s just for them. The realisation that even after sharing his secret with his friends, he still can’t be openly affectionate with Draco settles heavily on Harry.
Harry laughs. “Maybe he’s here because he’s genuinely curious?”
Harry looks at his friend, his chest clenching. Hermione does look more frazzled than usual, a quill stuck in her hair and her fingers stained with ink. He knows how late she works, how tirelessly she gives the Ministry so much of her time. Ron’s been away for three months working with the Magical Congress on dangerous potions infiltrating American cities, an area he specialised in after the war, eradicating many of the illegal brewing activities in England. Harry doesn’t have the foggiest how Hermione manages to work round the clock and raise Hugo and Rosie single-handedly too. Harry decided a Crup was too much like hard work last week. He resolves to do whatever she asks.
Harry makes his way quickly inside, orders a pint of water, chips and some bread. He knows he’s dangerously close to saying something to Draco he’s likely to regret, and he resolves to take it easy on the wine. It’s one thing being open around George and Lee, it’s a totally different thing being open around Draco.
“It doesn’t matter who knows, now.” Draco turns back to the window, watching the rain. “Not anymore.”
“What other reason could there possibly be?” Draco’s careful mask slips momentarily, replaced with open curiosity.
“So I hear.” Draco gives Harry a smile and the strange atmosphere between them eases a little. “Thank you.”
, not your lineage. It’s not good to suppress that. Or other things.”
“There was something unrelated to the Ministry I wanted to talk to you about,” Draco answers. There’s a note of hesitation in his voice.
“So much for a lie-in,” Harry mutters, as if he’s ever had a lie-in in his life. “See you Saturday.”
Harry sits back with a frown, contemplating Draco. He has dark shadows under his eyes, and he looks jumpy and on-edge. “Has something happened?”
“It’s not really the same.” Harry’s voice takes on an unexpected roughness. The thought of Draco’s
“Not yet.” Draco shakes his head. “Granger thinks they’re going to sweep it under the rug. I expect they’ll ask you to sign off on an official story that won’t be the
Harry reaches across the desk and helps himself to a quill, countersigning the documents. When he’s finished, he puts the file on Draco’s desk. “Don’t forget to send those to the Ministry.”
.” Draco rolls his eyes and sits up, moving over Harry and sliding down his body to put him out of his misery. “I don’t know who told you that you’re hung like Hippogriff but—”
As he sips his hot chocolate, Draco’s mind flickers to his upcoming meeting at Hogwarts. It’s strange, thinking about going back. If he tries hard enough, he can picture his younger self sitting close to the Great Lake and listening to the waves lapping against the banks, straining for the sound of Merepeople singing. With a sigh, Draco looks up at the white sky which already looks as though it’s preparing for a snowstorm.
“Either. Both.”
“Yeah. We can.” Harry opens Draco’s trousers and moves closer between his legs. He takes Draco into his mouth, sucking him slowly to full hardness and luxuriating in the warm, contented
want to do the fucking.”
“Oh relax,” Draco drawls. “You’re really not my type. Your idea of letting loose is a quiet pint in one of the dullest pubs in London.”
Draco answers by closing the distance between them and sinking into another blissful kiss. The weight of the last few months of agonising over what he should do lifts from him, rising like a phoenix from the ashes and disappearing into the clouds. He opens his mouth eagerly to Harry, pressing against him and holding him close. As the kiss deepens, Draco shifts their positions, so Harry is the one with his back pressed against the bookcase. He catches Harry’s lips in a searing kiss, their tongues sliding together, slick, hot and urgent. With a groan of pleasure, Draco slides his hand underneath Harry’s jumper and finds the buckle of his belt. The movement makes Harry hiss and buck closer to Draco. There’s a rough urgency to every movement, the clink of metal and the way Harry drops his head back and gasps for breath.
“I do after hours appointments for one-to-one consultations.” Draco taps his wand against the stack of forms. “It’s in the paperwork. You can book your slot via owl. I’m not cheap.”
Ginny snorts with laughter and Harry’s cheeks heat. Draco avoids Harry’s eyes and he sends a light hex in Millie’s direction that makes her yelp. The room descends into laughter, the music pulses and twists around them and Harry settles back on the sofa as his head spins. The idea of building such a secretive life when he’s always lived so unapologetically sits uneasily with him, but he supposes he should get used to the new normal.
Draco ignores the painful twist in his gut as the memory of his time in Azkaban sears through him. Fucking
“I’m not sending anyone to prison.” Harry glares at Hermione. “You know I wouldn’t do that.”
“I’d like for nobody to be going through this in five years, or ten, or twenty, but I can’t waste the rest of my life trying to go back somewhere that doesn’t want me.” Harry’s words catch in his throat and he swallows thickly. “I can’t live with false hope. I’ve got to focus on ways to move forward without the Ministry, at least for now. Build a new life, a new career.”
“Fine.” Draco glares at Harry. “Then why wouldn’t you just call me?”
“I’ve trusted Ron and Hermione with bigger secrets than that.” Harry frowns at Draco. “They would never have told anyone, not if I made it clear it couldn’t get back to your parents. I trust them with my life.”
“Why?” Draco turns to Harry with a look of surprise. “You broke up with me.”
Do you think forgetting fixes anything?
“No. It was the hail.” Harry makes his way into the kitchen and puts on the kettle.
Based on our conversation so far, I’m not expecting much more than that from your Evaporate.
“Hermione would be brilliant.” Harry honestly can’t think of a better candidate for Minister, his friendship with Hermione aside.
“I’m—” Harry breaks off, his words chased from his mouth by another press of Draco’s body against his own.
“Of course you should.” Draco’s throat bobs. “There are people who would give anything for a chance to reconcile with their family, no matter what’s been said in the past.”
“Stop.” Draco holds up a hand, trying to catch his breath. He looks up to see the hurt and confusion etched over Harry’s face and his heart twists at the sight of it. “We can’t, not until I tell you—”
“Not a lot. My social life’s been rubbish since I took on Malfoy’s case. At least I’ll be able to go out and have a few beers now I’m not traipsing over to Azkaban to be insulted.”
“You’re unbelievable.” Draco shakes his head, but despite himself his lips curve into a smile.
Harry looks around the gathered crowd at the table, perched on the edge of their seats clearly eager to see how Harry responds. He clears his throat and stands, extending his hand.
“Because I don’t want to believe you,” Draco says. He sounds resigned. “For your sake, rather than mine.”
“It’s not about me.” Harry shakes his head. “I wondered why you haven’t been out for a while.”
“You daft sod.” Harry’s voice breaks. He wants to reach for Draco, but he catches himself. “I was pissed off you couldn’t be honest with me, because you fucked off and left without telling me why. That’s totally different. Your mum getting sick wouldn’t have made me break up with you, what sort of man do you think I am?”
“I don’t want your
“For fucks sake, Potter!” Draco’s cheeks turn red, but he laughs under his breath. “I might have bloody known I’d get this kind of brazen behaviour from a Gryffindor.”
“Don’t fit in too well, Potter.” Draco gives Harry a quick smile to show he’s only teasing. “I expect whoever set up this bar liked your analogy too. The place has always had something
Dark clouds pass over the moon, moving through the sky like Thestrals.
“I’m off to training in a minute, Harry.” Ginny’s settles on her haunches as she accepts Harry’s call. “Why aren’t you at work?”
“Being gay?” Harry has only ever known Draco to be defiant and open. Watching him now it occurs to Harry life hasn’t always been as easy for Draco as people might imagine.
is dead cerebral. That step-by-step guide to fisting sounds very highbrow.”
Harry had always imagined Draco’s reformed character was driven by necessity as much as anything. Being in the Muggle world and finding acceptance there was bound to alter the views he used to hold about the superiority of wizards. Last night Harry realised for the first time that Draco’s reasons for making alterations in his life go far beyond his experience as a gay man. Draco’s grown up, pure and simple. For all the posh clothes, snarky remarks and the way he continues to lord it over people sometimes—he’s not had a complete personality transplant—Draco Malfoy in his thirties is a world away from the spiteful, entitled teenager Harry remembers from Hogwarts.
“Bloody Gryffindors. I thought you had better taste, Malfoy.”
“Thankfully I was able to purchase the Manor after a few years at Gringotts. I paid far more than anyone else would, with all its unsavoury associations. The house is mine, and mother and father have alternative accommodation abroad. They have no interest in coming back to Britain and they also no longer have the ability to use the Manor as leverage to keep me quiet.”
“Not anymore, Dad. The new legislation—”
“Thursday night,” Harry answers. “We were pissed. Not that it’s any excuse.”
well. Are you mental?”
“After your henchmen put me in Azkaban?” Draco raises an eyebrow and pours a glass of wine for them both, handing one to Harry before taking a seat. “I’ve finally got the stink of damp out of my hair, if that’s what you mean.”
Ginny frowns. “Why would I mind?”
“Fingers crossed.” Harry checks the time on the large prison clock. They’ve covered a lot of ground, and quickly. They usually spend visiting time dealing with the case, but this week there’s time left to talk about other things.
“What on earth do you mean, not together?” Molly stares at Harry, confusion crossing her face. “Of course you’re still together. You’ll be getting married soon.”
“Thanks.” Harry gives Draco a small smile and takes a gulp of his tea. It’s perfectly warm and sugary. He has a bite of his toast, glancing at the folded paper. “Has it made it into the
Fortunately, he doesn’t have to. Harry slips his fingers from Draco’s body and adds more of the chilly lubricant. He nudges the blunt head of his cock against Draco’s entrance, breaching his body just slightly.
Harry tries to mask his surprise, both at Lee’s revelation and the fact Draco didn’t think to tell him. “That’s why you were so interested in Lee. I knew something was up. How well do you two know each other?”
. Two men, together. It just isn’t Harry’s battle. He threw his name behind Kingsley’s bills on Ministry reform and purging Azkaban of Dementors once and for all. He led the team that stopped trading in artefacts formerly owned by Death Eaters. As he rose through the ranks of the DMLE, he started a new programme for trainee Aurors, specialising in Defence. Before Kingsley stepped down to a Wizengamot role and Robards became Minister a couple of years ago, Harry was heavily involved in putting an end to Ministry corruption. It’s not like he’s been sitting on his arse, colour-coding files and sending Howlers to people. He’s been out there, fighting. He has an Order of Merlin, First Class. He’s done good things.
“Cool.” Harry can’t recall a time when Ginny looked quite so buoyant, and he watches her chatter about Oxford fondly. He wants nothing but good things for her and watching her with Millie gives him confidence in his own path, letting him know there’s nothing wrong with this, nothing shameful. How could there be anything bad about something that makes two good, kind-hearted people that happy?
He sends a piece of paper across the table towards Harry, which appears to be a long, dull form. Harry doesn’t even both picking it up.
. Go on, then.”
“He actually told me to get my scrawny arse down here to support you otherwise he’d turn me into a ferret.” Draco scowls. “Charmed, I’m sure.”
The sound of the clock interrupts whatever perfunctory greeting Draco planned to make, his mouth open and empty before he snaps it shut, annoyed. Harry clutches the doorknob tighter as reluctant desire grips him with unexpected intensity. Even after a year of apart and the heartache of their break-up, it seems his body’s still finely attuned to the presence of Draco Malfoy.
“I’m here to help you with your paperwork.” Harry hands Draco a stack of official documents when he opens the door.
“That we are.” Harry looks up to find Draco watching him intently. “Kingsley made it pretty clear I’ll lose my job if it turns out the rumours are right.”
“You’ve met someone?” Lee leans forward, his eyes shining. “Let me guess—”
want an invitation to continue with whatever you were planning, consider yourself invited.”
“I don’t want you to think I’m more interested in him than you two.” The break in the conversation starts to become uncomfortable and Harry’s desperate to recover the situation. “Wouldn’t make me a very good mate, would it?”
Whatever Harry wants, it can wait.
story but it will sound far less scandalous than the truth.”
With a low grunt of pleasure, Harry stops his slow exploration and shoves down Draco’s pants. He wraps his fingers around Draco’s prick, getting used to the feel of him again, the length and the weight of him. He murmurs a lubricating charm against Draco’s lips as they sink with a groan into another filthy, messy kiss. Harry finds himself aching to make Draco feel good—to make them both feel good.
“You know it won’t help. He’s just doing what he has to.”
which sends light surging through the shadowy space. “We all like to be wanted, don’t we?”
“Good.” Draco sounds amused. He clears his throat, propping himself on his elbow and looking down at Harry. “Did you enjoy…?”
“I remember.” Ginny squeezes Harry’s hand, and the room gets quiet enough to hear a pin drop, only the background music humming and drumming around them.
“How do people expect you to be?” Harry asks quietly. “You might as well tell me.”
real name?
“You wanker.” Draco sounds half cross, half impressed. He gives Harry’s hair another impatient tug. “Are you planning to blow me anytime soon?”
“I’m not sure dragging me out of bed at midnight is going to make it go any better,” Harry points out. He has a feeling he’s going to need to sleep all weekend after tonight, the whiplash of emotions already exhausting. “You’re lucky it’s Friday, otherwise I’d have left you there.”
“Stop talking in riddles.” Molly looks between Arthur, George and Harry. “You’re not telling me there’s any truth in those awful rumours?”
Nope.
Draco heaves a sigh. Knowing Harry, he won’t shut up until Draco gives him something juicy. It’s not as though he doesn’t have enough ideas about the things he wants to do with Harry, but Draco also knows it’s going to make Saturday as awkward as hell. Resolving that this will absolutely be the last time he has a conversation of this nature with Griffin, Draco supposes he should at least make it a good one. He’s always been able to use the anonymity of Quick-Match to tell Griffin things he knows he would never have the guts to say to Harry in person. He might as well make the most of it.
Were the multiple pictures of my cock not enough for you?
Draco responds by quickening the pace of his hand, using his free hand to squeeze the fleshy globe of Harry’s arse. He digs his fingers in—hard—and it makes Harry shudder with pleasure. Their kisses get more uncoordinated, punctuated by every bite and whisper. It doesn’t take much time for Harry’s orgasm to knife through him, a searing pulse of pleasure. The heat of his climax ebbs away as Draco jerks back from the kiss to catch his breath, spilling over Harry’s fist. Not caring about the come on his fingers, Harry pushes his messy hand into Draco’s hair and urges him into another kiss. They stay like that for a long time, touching one another with warm, sticky hands until the kisses lose their urgency.
“It seemed the easiest way.” Draco’s face twists. “But I wasn’t thinking about you—even though I never
He takes in the vast, clean, white space that looks nothing like the Manor of old. Like the long corridors leading to Draco’s study, the living room is decorated with a painstaking eye for detail. Huge, colourful prints add interest to the blank walls and a large, opulently padded Chesterfield coffee table sits in the centre of the room, covered in arty-looking books. Harry picks up a small bronze. He nearly drops it when he realises it’s a sculpture of a naked man. Putting it gingerly back on the nearest surface, he shoves his hands into his pockets.
“You’ve got an enormous something, alright.” Harry grins.
“I can’t—”
, Harry. The cousin of the woman who killed our Fred, the boy who allowed werewolves into Hogwarts to maul my Bill.”
gets under his skin.
Malfoy. “Marriage just isn’t for us. Loads of couples are happy without getting married. You’ll have to tell your mum, though. She’s been on at me for years and—”
“Well of course I liked it,” Draco snaps. He bites out the same lubricating charm Harry used a few moments before. He wraps cool fingers around Harry, his breath hot and rough. “Don’t pretend it didn’t make you horny as fuck, too.”
“None taken.” Draco rolls his eyes. “You want to keep using Quick-Match?”
In a heartbeat, Draco’s lips are on Harry’s. There’s nothing warm, nothing gentle about it, and it’s absolutely
“Looking forward to Sunday?” Harry changes the subject with a grin.
“Has it?” Harry pushes himself off the counter and advances towards Draco, getting so close he can hear the stutter and shake of his breathing. “I had to redecorate my whole damn house after you left because you were on every single surface, in every room. We fucked in every one of them. Was I your
As much as he desires Harry, Draco can’t help but envy him. There’s a boldness to the way he carries himself and he exudes the kind of confidence that comes with being completely settled in himself—something that has always eluded Draco. For all his restlessness, moving from the Ministry to Hogwarts, taking on a multitude of odd jobs and constant thrill-seeking, Harry still possesses the strength of character and courage of conviction that suggests he can be happy alone, in those quiet moments that cause Draco such difficulty. Even though the past doesn’t return to him like a punch to the gut with the same regularity as before, it will always be there. Memories of all those things he was complicit in haunt the sleepy summers and winter’s longest nights. He sometimes thinks of himself as a wand with an unstable or hollow core. It’s as though part of Draco will always have to contain a dark, empty space where the past can echo and reverberate.
things, not sit around reading boring statutes and arranging his filing cabinet. Anything that involves sitting at a desk too long leaves his skin itching, an unpleasant thrum of restlessness creeping through him.
“It’s not that bad.” Harry laughs, shaking his head at Draco. “It’s just precaution. Aurors piss a lot of people off. Most of them pissed me off, half the time.”
“Looks like it.” Harry doesn’t elaborate on his prior whereabouts. He takes a swig out of the bottle, Niffler piss be damned. “Haven’t you heard of sanitising charms?”
“We did in the end.” Harry sits on the armchair facing Hermione. “I’m almost going to miss the flight out to Azkaban. It’s loads better than flying in London.”
A friend from Paris. I’m sure he wouldn’t mind me using his name. Why Griffin?
“Do I have to toss myself off while you have a nap?” Harry doesn’t sound annoyed. He sounds pleased with himself.
was Pritchards doing snooping around?”
Harry clears his throat, glancing at George who gives him an odd look. Harry takes a breath and shoves aside the feeling that he’s treading on eggshells. He stops trying to second-guess what Lee and George want him to say and decides to be frank. This isn’t a meeting with Robards or the Aurors. Lee and George are his friends.
There are too many questions Harry isn’t ready to answer, too many things he doesn’t want to say.
“Yes. I got my ticket last weekend.” Draco gestures in the vague direction of the hologram that swoops and dips around Hogsmeade. “Are you responsible for this?”
“Fuck you, Malfoy.” Harry tugs the duvet up to his chin and refuses to look at Draco. “You wouldn’t understand what it’s like. Not having any family.”
“Sounds like you’re asking Potter here on a date,” Millie says, cheerfully. “Well done, Malfoy. You almost had us fooled into thinking you’re just trying to be helpful, doing your bit for the cause. It’s a tricky old way to go about asking someone out, but whatever works for you.”
“And you’d make an effort with the Weasleys?” Harry already knows the answer, but he wants to hear Draco say it out loud.
.” Harry sends the paper to the fire with a flick of his wand. “I’ll see what I can do.”
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Harry sits back on the sofa, rolling his eyes. “You’re really reassuring. So glad I came to you. Remind me to give you a call next time someone dies, or when someone runs over my Crup.”
criminals and your ugly mug.”
“No.” Harry lets out a
Draco moves over Harry, the memory of last night and the scent of Harry’s cologne still lingering on his skin. He moves to kiss him, but Harry clearly has other ideas.
“You haven’t.” Harry is a little hurt, truth be told, but he also knew Ginny didn’t want to get married. He knew in his heart, but he blundered on anyway to try to stop his whole world from crashing down around him because of Draco
Draco arches off the sofa into Harry’s throat, fisting one hand in the soft velvet cushions and the other in Harry’s hair. He might as well try to gain some element of control when his limbs are shaky and his whole body is wired. He’s overwhelmed with a restless, feverish need to satiate a hunger that he suspects will always linger after tonight, like a sunbeam on his skin.
“Hello,” Draco breathes. He touches Harry's jaw, his eyes glinting. “Are you keeping the beard for a while?”
“Because you left before I could. Pretty glad I didn’t to be honest. I’d have felt like even more of a knob when you fucked off to Paris.” Harry breathes out through his teeth, looking back down at the floor. His anger dissipates and he’s left sad and deflated. “Have you said everything you wanted to?”
Draco swallows. “What were you doing in the Forest anyway?”
“I can’t believe you came to Paris. I used to think about it, you know.” Draco’s jaw works. “Sometimes I’d walk down the streets and see men that looked like you, but they never were.”
“I’m trying something different.” Draco’s words come out rough and jagged. “I thought you might prefer it.”
Are you wanking already?
with a story about wonderful Potter’s wonky wand.”
Draco’s career options were not what they might have been, had things been different. He knows he’s been lucky to get a job he enjoys that pays reasonably well and has a connection to the magical world. The small firm with its tiny office above bustling Liverpool Street crowds might not have the grandeur of Gringotts, but it suits Draco very well. He likes being able to go for lunch in a place where he can lose himself on a street full of Muggle strangers.
“I have some.” Draco wets his lips. “I wouldn't do anything rash, however. There's a blond at the bar giving you the eye.”
“I’m sure you do. I hear Gringotts has made you a fortune.” Harry masks his surprise at the information that Draco isn’t on speaking terms with his parents. As far as he was aware, Draco has been living the good life at the Manor since the end of the war. Lucius and Narcissa haven’t been on British soil in years, but Harry always assumed Draco maintained a good relationship with them.
“Absolutely not,” Harry agrees. He grins when Lee comes back from the bar with three pints, shaking his hand and settling into his seat after they all take the obligatory first glug of foamy ale. “Good to see you again, Lee.”
The shoulders of Harry’s colleagues begin to press against him, elbows digging into his belly, arms digging into his chest. A dizziness overcomes him as one, singular thought stands louder than all others.
“You had a meeting with the goblins…”
wrote about Draco’s arrest and the insinuation that he’s been called countless names. That sort of thing must wear on someone. If all people tell you is how wrong you are, no matter how hard you fight against it, there’s bound to be a niggling voice that wonders if they’re right.
“Are we still talking about the wand?” Draco glances at Harry.
“That’s not what I came here to tell you.” Draco doesn’t sound so certain, a sharp note of anger beneath his expensive tone. “I’ve already pointed out you’re the only friend I have left—”
“I should?” Relief courses through Harry and he nods towards the screen. “We could watch another film.”
Harry throws back the sheets, breathing in the clean, soapy scent of Draco’s skin as he works his way down his body. His body is still warm and damp from the shower, small beads of water kissing Harry’s lips. He lingers over Draco’s hipbone, mouthing lower. He pointedly ignores the irritated tugging at his hair, muttering
Draco swallows, because
of contentment, Harry pulls back. He moves quickly up the bed to tug open the drawer of the nearby cabinet, rummaging around until he finds the lube.
“Not a lot.” Draco turns his eyes heavenward. “Are you sure they won’t put something in my food so you can marry Ginevra after all?”
. “Good things?”

intensifies Draco’s actions and it’s not long before he pushes his tongue inside Harry, hauling him into a better position to really get to work.
“Sickle for them.”
“No?” Harry presses his mouth to the hard line of Draco’s cock, running his lips along the shaft. “How about now?”
for you? Rumour has it you’re still not keen on Slytherins.”
“Are you waiting for an invitation?” Draco drops his head back with a moan, as Harry slides his mouth off him. “Merlin, don’t
. He’s not a bigot. He just hates the way the conversation makes the itch under his skin intensify, hates the hot discomfort that rolls within him when he thinks about two men together. Hermione would get it if she were a wizard too, he’s sure of it. Harry makes sure his voice is firm, authoritative, steady. “I’ve got nothing against two wizards—or witches—being together. Live and let live.”
“How is she?” Draco asks.
At around ten that evening, Draco’s Quick-Match Quill vibrates eagerly which is a sure sign of trouble. With a sigh, Draco taps the Passion Parchment which flips open to the next blank page.
Draco stops, his expression stormy and his jaw clenched. Understanding dawns on Harry, and he studies Draco with a frown. Draco obviously thinks Harry’s got some weird hang-up about sex, being fucked in particular. It explains Draco’s restraint, the silent commands in Grimmauld Place, his hesitation to talk about the things he likes and the way he pulled back after demanding Harry let him take charge. It surprises Harry that despite the creep of his own fears and years of denying himself, he isn’t inhibited about sex at all. If anything, he’s spent the day looking forward to seeing Draco, to exploring, trying new things and indulging some of his fantasies.
the prick.”
“No. It’s a funny thing, splitting yourself in two. The people who know the lie, the people who know the truth, the people who know something in between. I’ve always been drawn towards people who are the same as me. You learn to develop an inkling, a sixth sense. Survival instinct, I suppose. Like the Aurors learn to sniff out a Dark wizard.”
“Everything you wanted before. No more hiding away.” Draco holds Harry’s gaze, a light flush colouring his cheeks. “I told mother I was planning to see you. She said if we were able to resolve things, she’d like to have supper with us.”
Draco stops, because he can’t think of the right word. Seductive, he supposes, although that doesn’t seem quite right. There’s something ineffable about the way Harry’s magic feels. Even through a wilting wand, there was comfort in it, a warmth that mingled with the tenacity of a dying phoenix feather fighting against all of the odds to stay alive.
“Because it’s
“Are you serious?” Harry sits back in his chair, staring at Kingsley. “You’re telling me I should get married and have kids to help my career?”
Ginny sniffles and scrubs her eyes with her hands. Her shoulders get tight and she stares at Harry. “When?”
.” Harry lets out an
“I love you too.” Harry clears his throat, his voice rough. He rubs his eyes and sits forward, watching the sunset. “What happens now?”
. Look it up.”
Harry seems to know how to read the responses of Draco’s body, fingering him slowly then adding an additional finger when he’s fully relaxed. By the time Draco is pushing hard into Harry’s mouth with a grunt—
“I don’t like this place.” Harry rolls his eyes. “I like my pub, but you kept complaining about it.”
“Yeah.” Harry gives Draco a smile. “I like talking to you when I get up and go to bed.”
Harry’s anger dissipates, a surge of emotion flooding through him. For one brief moment he thinks of clawing everything back. He could convince Robards to ditch the stupid charges against Malfoy. With Kingsley on his side there’s a slim chance he could still leave the meeting with his job intact. But in his heart, he knows what denying the accusation would mean. Intense scrutiny from the Ministry, having to keep his distance from Draco for a long period of time. It would mean looking Robards in the eye and denying himself. He doesn’t want to live like that anymore. He can’t.
“I know. We’re working on it.” By
The sight of Harry Potter with all his ineffable charm standing in Draco’s sanctuary is not exactly a welcome one. The reminder of Griffin’s messages from early that morning surface unpleasantly. A strange, guilty knot twists in Draco’s stomach, leaving him mildly nauseous. Damn Harry and his ability to insinuate himself into every aspect of Draco’s life. He can’t even get respite when he’s at work, it seems.
“Not that unexpected, surely?” Harry raises an eyebrow at Draco. “Just let me in, dickhead. This is stupid. I’m not here to tell you to back off or to give you a wedding invitation. Ginny broke up with me.”
“I flew here.” Draco runs a hand through Harry’s hair. “In the dead of night, I might add. Bloody freezing it was too. There’s a place I used to go flying when I needed to get away. Miles and miles away from here.”
There was a time when there were few things that infuriated Draco more than the sight of Harry Potter catching the Snitch.
Harry glances at Rosie and Hugo chattering excitedly, clearly thrilled to have their dad back. Hermione looks happier than she has in weeks, her smile broad as she chats to Molly. The sight of them makes Harry’s heart clench, and not for the first time he feels left behind. People are moving on without him, his friends are building families of their own. Harry’s stuck arguing with Malfoy in Azkaban and suffering a crisis of confidence at the Ministry. Not to mention his girlfriend seems less eager to spend time with Harry by the day.
“No.” Lee glances at George, who shrugs. Lee clears his throat. “I was just asking Malfoy why he hasn’t been to Knockturn for weeks.”
“Your thoughts.” Harry stops stretching, shoves his hands in his pockets and shoots Draco a broad smile. “You stopped working on my wand ages ago.”
Harry takes a breath when there’s a lull in the conversation. “About Malfoy’s new bloke,” he starts.
Harry tips his head to the side, contemplating Draco. “Like what? There’s no way I’m going back to the Ministry unless the law changes and that could take years. I’m not sure I’ll want to go back by then.”
, then he can certainly deliver on that.
his brain urges. Draco’s face swims before his eyes, his flushed cheeks and well-kissed lips. He can almost hear Draco’s snide voice asking him
“Please…”
“What part of ‘I hate wine’ don’t you understand?” Harry takes a sip anyway, when Draco hands him a generous glass. It’s not bad, as wine goes.
“Do you use it?” Draco tries to feign surprise and isn’t sure he manages it. He’s tired. Very, very tired of pretending. “I can’t imagine the great Harry Potter needs a matchmaking service.”
“Extremely.” Draco drops his head back with a groan, his breath stuttering as Harry’s lips travel along his throat. “You can buy me a new one. I hear you’re filthy rich.”
“I’m sure they did. Are they worried I’m going to convert you to my deviant lifestyle?”
“You’re awake at last.” Draco looks up from his position in the chair next to Harry’s bed. He closes his book and slips off his reading glasses, stretching forward and putting them on the nearest surface. “About time too. There isn’t a single decent book in the house. I’ve been forced to read this.” He holds up Harry’s copy of
Harry lets out a brittle laugh. “I was stupid to trust people wouldn’t snoop through my locked desk drawer, but the rumours about me started long before that. If you want to blame anything, blame the law.
.” Harry moves closer until their bodies touch. He takes off his glasses, sending them to the kitchen counter and brings his lips to Draco’s ear, his voice low and filthy. “You’re the only person I’ve fucked in this flat, if that’s what you’re wondering.”
“That doesn’t count.” Harry carefully evades Draco’s question, fighting the heat rising in his cheeks. “I’m not as strait laced as you think I am.”
Harry shoves Draco back against the wall and Draco goes easily, his back landing with a thud on the damp bricks and his breath leaving him in a huff. Harry never wants the kiss to end, never wants to break this moment where the rest of the world fades away into oblivion. He chases away the voices that crescendo in his head—
“I won’t do this again with you,” Harry whispers to himself. He rubs his trembling hand over the light scars that still linger from years before and swallows back a wave of pain. He’s reminded of the press of quill against skin, the dark seep of blood.
Harry glares at Draco. “Very funny. I’m guessing Hermione told you everything?”
Draco leans forward, his voice clipped and low. “I haven’t been out because I was
“Back to work tomorrow.” Harry pulls a face. He’s enjoyed his week off, spending time with Draco. The busy holiday season at Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes is approaching and Harry’s already dreading the crowds. It’s not all bad, though. He gets to spend time inventing cool things with George, and it keeps him occupied. “I’d work here every day if I could.”
“I’m used to it.” Draco shrugs. He gives Harry a wry smile. “Besides, I haven’t been with many hand-holding types. Just you.”
Harry watches as Ron does as Harry asks, turning his back and making his way out of the room. Harry wants to stop him, to pull him back and to make him bloody
“Windows,” Harry grunts. “The…fuck, this wand isn’t…”
“I’m sure that’s not the case.” Harry sounds amused.
“If you say so.” Harry casts a Cleaning Charm without a sound and grins when Draco’s breath falters. “Does that turn you on?”
“I’m not.” Harry tears off some bread, chewing thoughtfully. “Are those bars the sort of place anyone can go?”
“Your magic.” Draco runs his hand across the windowpane, pressing his fingertips against the cool, smooth glass. Even though it’s just ordinary glass a layer of intricate magic makes his skin tingle the way it did when Harry traced his mouth and tongue over Draco’s body. “It’s everywhere. Downstairs, too. I noticed it when you walked in. The place is full of it.”
“Careful,” Harry laughs. “My bad lines are rubbing off on you.”
“Don’t they have spare owls for staff?” Draco can’t believe Harry gives his owl a day off. They’re bloody
Draco’s mouth opens and closes again. “Your pretty girlfriend dumped you and now you’re suddenly
“Tell them whatever you tell Ron and make sure they know I’m fine with it. They’re going to start worrying otherwise and I don’t want mum turning up dabbing her eyes with a hanky and wailing about not having grandchildren even though she’s already got loads.” Ginny pauses. “I don’t—I’m not ready, Harry. Not yet. Not to tell them about me.”
It’s complicated. He was always…unattainable.
You might as well. I don’t have anything better to do this evening.
Hardly. Do you need confirmation?
.” Draco yanks Harry in, drawing him into another kiss. “Come on, Harry.
“Hurry up, Parkinson.” Draco waits impatiently for Pansy to join him at the top of the rickety stairs leading down to the seedy underbelly of Merlin’s Kitchen. “I’m parched and based on the crowds we can look forward to another hour of queuing before we get any drinks.”
“There’s no need to be so fucking rude about it,” Draco snaps.
“I think I can manage that.” Draco rolls over onto his front and turns to look at Harry, who gives him an amused smile. “You should probably start practicing now.”
No matter how hard he tries, Draco can’t tear his eyes away. He can admit to himself (and to his friends after too many martinis) that he’s had more than one fantasy about Harry Potter. Draco’s imagined what it would be like, of course he has. He’s a gay man with eyes and like it or not, Potter is untidy, stupidly heroic and sexy as sin. Draco’s gaze settles hungrily on Harry, drinking him in. The strangest details take hold, the way slanted squares of mirror ball light accentuate his jaw, the curve of his biceps, the lopsided tilt of his smile and hands strong enough to hold on tight. Draco swallows, his mouth dry.
“Gods, so much.” Harry sounds pleasingly undone already, grinding back into Draco. “Come
“I’m not letting you into my house, so you’re just going to have to deal with it.”
The bars are right in the heart of Knockturn, with gloomy pubs and dusty shops selling questionable artefacts flanking them. To the casual observer the two bars are indistinguishable from the other pubs and buildings that surround them. Save for the signs that creak and swing in the light evening breeze, they’re hardly recognisable as places witches and wizards might go drinking at all. The first pub Draco identifies as
“Worried one of your pals is going to overhear you?” Harry leans forward, nudging the papers towards Draco. “Just bloody well look at these, will you? Stop being a twat. I’m not your enemy.”
It’s the kind of day that swells with promise.
I hope you have more exciting plans for the day than I do.
“Your friends don’t mind you being here?”
“Circe, no.” Harry shakes his head. “I had help from friends. That’s why everything looks so nice. If it had been left up to me, you’d be sitting on Hagrid’s old sofa and drinking lager out of a mug.”
“Morning Malfoy,” Harry says. He’s as brusque as ever, barging into Draco’s space like a Beater thwacking the Bludger at the nearest Seeker’s head. “I need your help.”
“Where’s the fun in that?” Harry flips open the top of the lube. He gets his fingers slick as Draco watches, a moan stuttering from his lips as he drops his hand to his cock and gives it a quick stroke. “No touching,” Harry says. “I’m coming.”
“Please don’t.” Harry rolls his eyes. “I don’t know why you’re treating me like I don’t know what I’m doing. I’ve had
Lee writes quickly before sitting back with a contented sigh. “We’re going to win this week. I’ve got a good feeling about it.”
Harry’s anger quells, replaced with something altogether less comfortable. His stomach squirms as it always does when this topic of conversation comes up in official briefings. Wizards and
“Yeah. Don’t tell me you’re going to give me financial advice. I thought this was your night off.”
“As if I’d want to know anything about your sex life.” Harry snorts, the tension crackling between them dissipating in a moment of light relief. “I’d rather stick my head up a Hippogriff’s arse.”
“This could be quite…kinky.” Draco imagines the thrill of being pressed against the large windows by Harry, before he catches sight of Parkinson dancing with her friends below. He pulls a face. “Maybe not.”
.” Draco traces one long finger down Harry’s chest, his voice low. “I’ve noticed how you’ve been looking at me since I arrived. Don’t be coy.”
Harry grins, the tension between them dissipating as Draco slumps back in his chair with an irritated cluck of his tongue. “
“Rumour has it wrong. Malfoy here can tell you that.” Harry shakes Flint’s hand and winks at him. “A handshake doesn’t mean I won’t enjoy beating you at Quidditch again if an opportunity arises.”
The more Draco sees Harry in the flesh, the harder it is to keep up the pretence of not knowing exactly who Griffin is. Even small talk feels like one more lie piled on an already steaming pile of them. With his guilt intensifying, Draco knows this nonsense has to end. Although he doesn’t feel too bad about his early evasiveness—Harry is clearly as reckless on Quick-Match as he is on the Quidditch pitch—their conversations in person and as
“I’m offering to show you everything, Malfoy.”
Harry rubs his eyes and sighs. Eventually he looks up and sets his jaw, meeting Kingsley’s gaze head on. “The rumours are false. You have my word.” He keeps his voice dispassionate and knows Kingsley doesn’t believe him for one minute.
“From the start.” Harry turns to look at Draco at last. He leans back against the window ledge, his arms crossed which is a sure sign Draco shouldn’t come any closer yet. “You’ve got a very distinctive…” He trails off and coughs, indelicately.
Draco doesn’t get a chance to ask what Harry means by
“Once an Auror, always an Auror,” Draco mutters. “Go on, then. You might as well tell me the problem. It’s nothing I won’t have heard before.”
Watching Harry does nothing to dull the noise in Draco’s brain.
“I’m not joking.” Harry tries to sound firm and convincing, but he’s not sure how to convince someone you’re gay. He didn’t know what to expect, but he thought Draco would believe him at least. The way he’s acting has Harry doubting himself. “Why won’t you believe me?”
Hermione winces, her expression harried. “You heard about the arrest?”
“Fat chance of that,” Draco replies. “Saving the world doesn’t make you any less of an idiot.”
I nearly froze my bollocks off going for a swim this morning. It’s colder than a
“Go and get ready for bed, Potter.” Draco gives Harry a lazy smile. “And stop showing off.”
“I think…maybe.” Harry flashes Ginny an awkward smile, a strange weightlessness leaving him unburdened for the first time in months. He can’t say
He reaches across the bed to the rumpled sheets and the warmth of the mattress that confirms the night wasn’t just a dream. The sound of the shower lets him know that Draco’s still around, which is a good thing at least. There’s a hot cup of something next to Harry’s wand and glasses and he props himself up to drink it. The familiar taste of strong, black coffee reminds him of countless lazy weekends in bed with Draco. A kernel of warmth swells in Harry’s chest as he thinks about the previous night. Part of him is happy things ended the way they did, but there’s a smaller voice that reminds him the night ended with some things left unsaid.
“Potter?” Draco’s amused voice makes Harry turn back towards him before he leaves. “I’ve always been drawn to you too,” Draco says. “Isn’t that peculiar?”
“Excellent choice.” The shopkeeper shakes Harry’s hand. “Excellent choice.”
“Hmm.” Draco doesn’t sound so certain. “Don’t worry, I’ll be sure I leave your arse alone.”
“It doesn’t matter.” Harry is surprised to find he really doesn’t mind. He’s spent all day dwelling on his plans with Draco for next Thursday, and his rash decision to go to Knockturn. He’s hardly had time to think about the weekend plans he made with Ginny. Wales seems like ages ago. “The Brecon Beacons sounds fun.”
Draco nods slowly and sips his wine. The sight of it is torture—the wet press of his lips, the muscles of his throat working, the way his fingers hold the glass. Harry bites at the inside of his cheek.
“Ginny.” Harry cuts her off with a shake of his head. He doesn’t want Draco babysit Harry. “I’m sure Malfoy’s got his own plans and the last thing I want to do is traipse around an art gallery in Central London. Why are you so determined to stop me from sorting out the garden?”
“And I’m not going anywhere again,” Draco says. “If you need to hear that.”
“It’s okay,” Harry replies. “I’m not sure I got everything right either.” He brushes his thumb against Draco's cheek. “But I forgive you, if you need to hear it.”
Laughing, Harry resumes his position after making sure he has proper access to Draco’s arse. Breathlessly he slides a slick finger inside him, meeting only a little resistance. The hot clench of Draco around him sends pleasure pulsing through his veins. He fucks Draco slowly before adding another finger, taking in the way his lips part and the arch and buck of his body.
for Merlin’s sake; he’s fairly certain they don’t have employment contracts. Flying is what they do. They enjoy it.
“I said enjoy yourself, not Wronski feint into my feet, you prat.” Ginny grins, giving Harry a light punch on the arm. She glances over her shoulder. “There’s no one around. Take off that cloak, it’s weird not being able to see you.”
For one desperate, cloying moment, Harry thinks of the Department of Mysteries, of Sirius and the voices that whisper and sing to him when he’s on that floor. It would be so easy, to go and find Sirius. So easy to make it look like an accident. Harry’s stomach rolls as the lift shoots up and people jostle for space, eager to get their weekends started. They talk about their families, their friends, children, husbands and wives.
“Why didn’t
Yeah. Would you still want to go there now if he was interested?
“You do that.” Kingsley stands, and Harry gets up from his desk, walking around it to see Kingsley out. “Any plans for the weekend?”
hope it doesn’t ruin your concentration.”
“Something like that.” Harry keeps cheerful, refusing to be baited. “Rescued a few Kneazles from trees, apprehended a wizard smuggling ring and used a Time-Turner to go back and kill Voldemort again, just to make sure I finished him off the first time. How are interest rates doing?”
journalist might put to him. Everything is still too raw and fresh. In time, perhaps. When there’s a chance his story might do some good.
“You are being discharged from your role.” Robards reaches for a further set of papers and sends them towards Harry. It’s an official contract, with print tiny enough that Harry would need a Magnifying Charm to read it properly. “However, there is no restriction on you remaining at the Ministry in an alternative capacity. As a gesture of goodwill in recognition of your exemplary service, we are prepared to offer you a contract with the Broom Regulatory Department. A new role has been created and you will oversee a small but enthusiastic team. With your background in Quidditch I believe you would be well-suited to the position.”
“Because I don’t need to go out and meet men.” Draco’s cheek works. “Would you like me to start doing so again?”
“Can you?” Draco’s breath is harsh and ragged. “You can’t be in charge of this like everything else in your life. Did it ever occur to you I might have precious little interest in being fucked by you? Perhaps
“Like Thestrals.” Harry grins. “They’re always around too, but not everyone can see them.”
“Yeah,” Harry replies. He decides quizzing Malfoy about his interest in Lee can wait. “I’m not going to barge in on their weekend plans. I really am fine. I’ll be perfectly happy here doing the garden. I promise.”
“Do you think I’d do that?” Harry stares at Draco, disappointment flooding through him. He didn’t expect to be welcomed with open arms, but he thought Draco trusted him—at least more than he did a few months ago.
More fool them. Give me a minute.
“We thought you might be,” Ginny replies, cheerfully. “With Hermione gone and the fact you’ve been avoiding me. That’s why we came.”
“A hopeless state of affairs.” Despite his words, a strange, giddy feeling clutches at Draco. It helps that he’s not alone in his doubts and his adrenaline spikes at the thought of getting to know Harry in ways other people don’t. It's not as though they would be the first people to have to have actual conversations to get beyond a one night stand. “The only club I can go to without having to Obliviate Muggles is this godforsaken hellhole.”
“I’m not always good. I can be a dick when I want to be.” Harry pushes a hand through his hair, his thoughts from the previous night returning with force at the mention of courage. “It was easier not to take a chance, wasn’t it? That’s why you never replied to my owl. It’s why you stayed in Paris.”
Ginny narrows her eyes. “I hope you haven’t been in cahoots with mum over this daft marriage idea. I’m too young.”
“For the time being?” Draco’s uncertain expression turns serious. “You can’t tell anyone else
Draco rolls his eyes. “Obviously I like certain parts of the male anatomy. I’m gay.”
Harry follows Draco into the living room after shrugging off the jacket and sending it upstairs with a flick of his wand. Ginny turns the music up and insists Harry dance with her.
“Nope. I left less than an hour after I arrived. I’ve just been walking ever since.” Harry shakes his head. “Please don’t make me tell you.”
“Of course they have. Mum’s been crying more than usual. She gets weepy over silly things. I think George had a long chat with Dad too, told him he’s already lost one son and he shouldn’t let another one go. Percy’s keeping well out of it and Ron hasn’t said a lot to them, but Bill and Charlie have had a few choice words. They think it’s all bollocks.”
“Don’t stop.”
“You lot might have told me I only needed to clean one room.” Harry closes the door and leans back against it, folding his arms. “I could have saved some energy.”
Ron shrugs again. “Big. Busy.”
“I’m not being foolish,” Harry says tightly. “Do you think I’d lie about this?”
Harry shakes his head, his body warming at the suggestion. “Hardly. I just want to see it. I can’t believe you ever let loose.”
Harry fumbles and something happens that plunges the shop into darkness. Draco isn’t sure if Harry has cast a particularly powerful
Draco nods towards Harry’s gaggle of Gryffindors. “You brought the cavalry.”
Everything begins to slot into place. Unlike most of the staff who have specific subjects to teach, Harry is more likely to be found swanning around Hogsmeade in his Quidditch leathers one minute and teaching students how to defeat a Boggart the next. On one balmy summer evening after meeting with McGonagall to discuss starting his own apprenticeship in wandlore, Draco happened upon Harry in a small clearing, cooing over baby Thestrals and whispering to them in a low, soothing tone before disappearing off into the Forbidden Forest. Probably foraging for Blast-Ended Skrewts, knowing Potter. It’s exactly the kind of ugly thing he would find charming. It makes sense he would start his life at Hogwarts as a mini-Hagrid, literally and figuratively.
“Any ideas?” Ron pushes his hands in his pockets, his expression miserable. “Robards told me about the Broom Regulatory stuff. What a twat.”
“I don’t
“Not exactly,” Ron replies. Harry turns to find himself confronted with a sheepish looking Ron and a very uncomfortable looking Draco. “I thought it was only right he should be here,” Ron continues. “I invited him myself.”
, names he spat out on too many occasions to count. This grown-up, bashfully charming
“Read what?” Nerves grip at Harry, fear building within him as he looks around, half expecting to see the
“You are?” Hermione frowns at Harry, her eyes narrowing. “I thought Ginny had plans with a friend. She told Ron she was going away.”
“There’s nothing for people to spread rumours about.” Harry swallows.
When Harry’s around the shop fills with a strange, crackling tension that fizzes and spits between them. Under normal circumstances there’s nothing Draco enjoys more than some verbal sparring, but it’s impossible to enjoy Harry’s company when the weight of their Quick-Match correspondence pushes a barrier between them. What started out as a bit of fun has become increasingly complicated and Draco isn’t sure he can take keeping the identity of Jean-Paul a secret from Harry for much longer. On the other hand, as much as he complains about Quick-Match, Draco can no longer imagine a single day without a conversation with Harry in it.
Watching Harry get more desperate is exquisite. Draco notices every curl of his fists in the sheets, every tremble and shiver, every time he bucks up and back. He drinks in the way Harry lowers his face into the pillow to muffle a cry of pleasure, when Draco curls his fingers just so. After watching Harry get more and more worked up, Draco can’t hold himself back any longer. With another quick spell, Draco slicks his aching cock and positions himself. With one hard push, he settles himself deep inside Harry and pauses to give them both a moment to breathe.
As he kisses Draco, it all comes flooding back. The taste of Draco’s skin, the bitterness of cologne, the saltiness of sweat. He remembers sinking into Draco and the way his body would shake and tremble after having Harry’s face and tongue sliding over and into every intimate place Harry could reach. He remembers the ache of his arm after fucking his fingers into Draco, the hiss and spit of ragged pleas and the sweeping pleasure of climaxing in Draco’s body, his hand, his mouth.
“Were you fucking me around?” A hot wave of jealousy rolls over Harry and he curls his hands into tight balls, his stomach in knots. The idea that Draco might have found someone else occurred to him countless times, the images conjured by the society pages leaving him nauseous. “You had a better social life in Paris than England, by the looks of things.”
When Draco doesn’t respond, Harry opens his trousers and shoves them down. He wraps his hand around Draco and falls back against the wall with a thud, sucking in a breath when Draco strokes him just so. He rubs his thumb over the thick, blunt head of Draco’s cock and arousal pulses through him at the thought of taking it inside his body. He doesn’t have much experience with cocks, but he knows he likes the way Draco’s feels in his hand.
Do you ever talk dirty in French?
It turns out Draco’s methods of getting Harry to be quiet are incredibly successful. Not that Harry’s quiet, exactly. It’s difficult to stop the pleas that fall from his lips as Draco works his tongue over Harry’s most intimate of places. In the end, Harry stops trying to be less obvious about his pleasure. Draco seems to enjoy every sound Harry makes. Each groan and
“Better, I think.” Harry tightens his hold on Draco and breathes in the scent of fresh paint, clean and white.
as punishment. I can’t imagine being gay is all that popular with Voldemort’s lot, if your own parents can’t get their heads around it. Don’t talk to me about my army. Things would be a lot worse if you’d had your way.”
“Then don’t do anything daft on my account.” Harry means it, too. He isn’t alone in this—Draco understands all too well how it feels to be rejected by family. The other night they had a long chat that stretched into the early hours of the morning. The last thing Harry wants is for Ginny to be miserable just so they can all feel sorry for themselves together.
“’Course not. I’m happy with anything that gives Hermione a break.” Ron tips his head back into the wintery sun, closing his eyes. “Not exactly normal doing that sort of thing with other wizards, but I don’t think a bloke should be put in prison for it.”
Harry swallows, taking his time to consider his words instead of diving straight in like he usually does. “It’s not vile,” he says at last. “Not if you enjoyed it.”
Because it makes me horny thinking about you and this complicated bloke of yours.
“You’re a kinky fucker.” Draco laughs breathlessly. “Is now the right time?”
He strides through the club before Harry can change his mind.
—and he expects he knows why Draco doesn’t sink to the ground either. It’s as if neither of them wants to give the other any kind of tacit upper hand until one of them says
Harry studies Draco thoughtfully. Eventually he replies, keeping his tone warm. “Yeah, obviously. You really gross me out, Malfoy.”
“I don’t.” Harry knows he sounds hollow and unconvincing, but it’s not that. It
“I might not show up if you don’t have a yacht.”
Harry barely recognises the sound that leaves his lips as his own. He slides his tongue into Draco’s mouth, the kiss hotter and heavier than any Harry’s had in a long time. There’s a strangeness in kissing Draco, as if Harry’s floating out of his own body and this is all just a weird, fucked up dream. He’s not sure if it’s the booze, the fact he hasn’t kissed anyone other than Ginny in years, the fact it’s a man, or the fact it’s Draco Malfoy. All he knows is that the unfamiliar lips against his own and the grasp of Draco’s hands on his jacket make his head spin.
“Of course I like it. Just…not all the time.” Draco finally meets Harry’s eyes, his expression mutinous. “I might enjoy it more with you. As long as you don’t fuck it up.”
Ginny bursts out laughing and Harry joins in, as Draco mutters something about not understanding Gryffindors either.
Harry scowls. “I don’t have any
He can be unpredictable. Hard, I expect. He’s not my grandmother. Besides, he has a tendency to charge into things.
“Throwing up after Apparating is a delightful thing to have in common. We really are scraping the bottom of the barrel.” Draco shifts to his hands and knees, deciding it’s as good a way as any to get things back on track. “In case you’re wondering, this is an invitation too.”
With another quick smile at Ginny, Harry races upstairs. One of the best things about being a wizard is that household chores take no time at all. He doesn’t know what the arrangement is between Ginny and Millie, so to avoid any awkwardness he cleans three rooms. With all the dust and cobwebs lifted, the upstairs looks brighter than before. The rooms that used to belong to Sirius, Regulus, and Orion and Walburga are sparkling clean, the beds neatly made and the bed linen fresh and crisp. The bathrooms have a new glossiness, the various cleaning products all tidied away neatly. Harry tidies his own bedroom too, his cheeks heating as he does so. It’s not that he expects anyone to sleep there with him, but he wouldn’t put it past Malfoy to have a nose around. That’s all.
“I’m glad to hear it.” Harry’s stomach growls. “Although I wouldn’t say no to a bacon sandwich, if you fancy going downstairs.”
“Home looks good on you.” Draco pours another glass of wine and hands it to Harry. At some stage Harry should probably remind Draco he prefers beer. “I didn’t even know Bulstrode was queer until her and Weasley stumbled out of my fireplace and demanded I come and save you from your disgusting wallpaper.”
Ginny links arms with Harry, walking through the narrow, ambling streets. Her touch doesn’t send the same thrill through Harry that it used to, even after all their time apart. There’s something comfortable about it, though. A sunny warmth that comes from just being close to Ginny. They might not share the same kind of intimacy they did in the early days, but Harry is quite content with the way things are.
, Harry’s brain niggles. He pulls a face and avoids saying as much. “Because Malfoy’s a prat?”
“Ten points to fucking Slytherin. Is this gay enough for you, or do I need to turn around so you can fuck me properly?”
“You’re mine, too.” Harry’s voice trembles.
Draco nods his agreement, not quite able to reply as the past comes hurtling back with whiplash force. The crude reference to being thrown into Azkaban aside, he’s reminded how his nights at Merlin’s Kitchen are a relatively recent occurrence. During the brief post-war period before Harry Potter’s much publicised departure from wizarding London, Draco was standing trial and facing a lengthy sentence which was only reduced after intervention from Professor McGonagall that Draco still isn’t sure he deserved. After that, he was too busy fighting against the steady creep of madness in Azkaban and waging countless internal battles that are still a work in progress. Recalling grainy pictures in the
“I was always happy being close to you,” Draco murmurs, his voice rough. “I was closer to you than anyone in my life. I’ve never been like that with someone—”
“We can put it to the test one day.” Draco moves closer to Harry, pressing him against the wall. “Something on your mind, Potter?”
Harry can never be fully relaxed with Draco in public. Even if he took the enormous step of leaving the Aurors voluntarily, the same would still be true. Any public intimacy whatsoever could lead to either one of them being arrested as long as they’re in the wizarding world. Harry is unlikely to be locked up for long, if at all, but Draco has a very different history. Without Harry at the Ministry his sanctions could be worse.
okay with me. Trial and error, like you said with that cologne. I’m not sure I’d be up for that step-by-step guide to fisting yet, but that doesn’t mean I wouldn’t try it if you—”
I suppose I would want him to kiss me.
Draco is about to remind Pansy as much when the atmosphere in the club shifts. The poppy beat of the music becomes less intense, and the people gathered on the dancefloor stop dancing. A steady hum of chatter gets louder and a group of Hufflepuffs next to Draco and Pansy begin to whisper urgently to one another.
“It’s all over the blasted
Harry doesn’t need telling twice, taking off his joggers and pants quickly enough that it’s a wonder he doesn’t knee Draco in the stomach. His eagerness seems to amuse Draco, but Harry really doesn’t give a fuck. Maybe someone who’s horny as fuck and quite happy to let Draco
“—I’m not indulging your back-alley fantasy when you have a perfectly comfortable bed.”
“Circe.” Draco bites back a groan and he pushes his hand under the elasticated waistband of Harry’s joggers. He moves his hand over Harry’s aching prick and then presses his lips to Harry’s ear. “Take these off,” he whispers.
“Got it.” Anticipation thrums through Harry and he slicks his fingers, pushing Draco’s legs apart and adjusting his position for the best access.
“I was thrown into prison for having sex with a Muggle in the middle of a park in London.” Draco gives Harry a pointed look. “When was the last time you let that loose?”
Draco gets his wand and casts a quick lubricating charm, sliding a slick finger in between the cheeks of Harry’s delectable backside. He doesn’t miss the way Harry arches his back like a Kneazle, or the soft huff that leaves his lips.
Circe, you’re so peculiar. What are you planning to do while I fantasise about someone else?
, Draco’s very annoying inner voice reminds him.
Harry tries to ignore the fierce yearning that grips him at the implication behind Draco’s words. He remembers every bit of it. The hot flavour of sweet tea kisses, tugging off clothes because they couldn’t wait long enough to go upstairs. The ache of wanting Draco burns through him, leaving him restless.
“Now I don’t think about you at all,” Draco replies.
Is Griffin
“Morning, Potter.” Draco walks past Harry, squeezing his arm briefly before topping up his coffee. It’s not much, but that one, simple gesture makes Harry instantly relaxed. It says
“Not yet.” Draco sounds firm and he urges Harry up onto his knees and forearms.
“Oh Potter.” Draco shakes his head as if to imply the question is a particularly stupid one. “Not even close.”
“Yeah, ‘course. Sorry Harry.” George steps to the side to let him in and he’s immediately engulfed by Molly.
“Thank Merlin.” Ginny slumps back in her seat with a sigh of relief. “You almost gave me a heart attack.”
,” he bites out. “Move, ah—”
“There’ll be none of that. You’ve been nothing but trouble,” Draco mutters. The last thing he wants on a perfectly pleasant Monday morning is to deal with Quick-Match. He points a finger at the quill which gives him another insolent, feathery flutter. It curls in on itself and turns in the ink pot in an agitated fashion. With a resigned sigh, Draco taps his wand against a blue book. “
“Pleased to hear it.” Draco slides his hand down Harry’s back, squeezing his backside and pulling him close. It makes Harry shiver with pleasure and he bites back a low moan. “Mm. You really do like it, don’t you?”
He picks up his wand and makes his way into the hall where bits of discarded wallpaper are strewn everywhere. Draco looks up as Harry emerges. Aside from the weekend, Harry’s favourite day is Thursday when Draco ‘works from home.’ Lately he’s been working from Grimmauld Place, setting up a study in Sirius’ old room. Draco reckons it’s haunted, because his papers keep ending up in odd places. Harry’s noticed it too. The scent of leather and cigarettes, the way his Gryffindor scarf keeps carefully rearranging itself over Draco’s Slytherin one. He secretly likes the idea that Sirius might be teasing them both. It makes him feel as though Sirius really would be okay with Harry, even if he’d think shacking up with a Slytherin is a rubbish idea. Sometimes Harry swears he hears a motorbike in the sky when he’s watching the stars through the window and struggling to sleep.
“How can I tell them after this?” Ginny’s shoulders shake and she buries her head in her hands, her voice muffled. “I know I have to. If I tell them about me too, it might make things better.”
“Lee Jordan?” Draco asks, casually. Harry gives him a sharp look. It’s not the first time Draco’s pretended he doesn’t know who Lee is.
“You don’t have to, Gin,” Harry promises. “I won’t say a word.” Someone yells Ginny’s name in the background, and he lets out a watery laugh. “Go and play Quidditch. Do some cool moves for me.”
“Obviously.” Harry rolls his eyes. He watches Draco straighten and a warm tug of arousal curls in his belly. Draco in Quidditch leathers is really something. He clears his throat when Draco catches him staring. “I still reckon I’d beat you to the Snitch.”
“I don’t see how you’re going to be any use to me at all.” Draco gives Harry a suspicious look. “We’re not sharing tea and biscuits and talking about how difficult it is to be a queer in the world you’ve created with that oafish army of yours, if that’s what you expect.”
insinuating himself into my personal business, I might as well find other ways to entertain myself.” He lifts his napkin to his lips and dabs them. “To take the edge off.”
A rush of happiness comes over Harry as he takes in the way Draco has clearly dressed carefully for the occasion and the warmth in his eyes as he meets Harry’s gaze with a tentative smile. Harry wants to reach for him and hug him, or kiss him, Ministry be damned, but he can feel Pritchard’s beady eyes on him from across the room. It’s enough that Draco’s here. The rest can wait. Harry’s sure he can control himself for one night.
. Sibilant sounds, scattered thoughts, a rush of hot water over his face and Harry knows. He
“Perhaps.” Harry swallows another delicious bite of toast, contemplating Draco. “I’m sorry. I should have told you as soon as it happened.”
He can’t say he’s surprised. The official story was as flimsy as Harry expected. The news appeared without fanfare, an official Ministry briefing thanking Harry for his service and wishing him luck with the other pursuits he supposedly left to focus on. Considering he hasn’t been seen in public since he stopped working as an Auror and his
“See if George can go with you. I’d offer myself but I suspect my presence would do more harm than good.”
“What are you up to today, Malfoy?” Millie asks around a mouthful of bacon sandwich. “Counting your pots of gold?”
“I thought we could go for a cream tea,” Ginny suggests. “I love hot scones with jam and clotted cream. It’s worth all the extra training to work off the cream.”
“I have no idea.” Harry sounds as though he has every idea. “I could cook after.”
I like to keep an air of mystery.
“They won’t fire him, because the rumours are
“Someone I used to know from school told me once that wizards are like wands. We all like to be wanted.”
“No,” Harry lies. He rubs his chin and pulls a face, deciding to be as honest as he can be. This is Kingsley. He’s fought alongside Harry countless times. “I’m just not sure I appreciate being told how to run my life.”
you lost it. As if it makes you lesser, not equal to the others when you—” her voice breaks and she clutches Harry’s hand tightly. “
“George Weasley and Lee…Jordan?” Draco frowns as if he’s trying to place him.
As Harry takes him with relentless, determined purpose, Draco can’t be sure there
“Maybe. Bulstrode and her protests, Jordan and his obsession with queer Americana and Muggle balls, Granger back at the Ministry. There are people determined to change the world.” Draco shifts closer to Harry, their bodies touching as they watch the clouds. “Maybe Millicent’s right. One day we’ll just be two old queens, saying
Draco is fine hiding behind the mask of Jean-Paul when they’re sharing sweaty pictures and parchment fucking or whatever you call it, but when hopes and dreams begin to get involved the whole thing leaves an unpleasant taste in his mouth.
“Oh.” Draco is quiet, but pleased. “Neither am I.”
“Isn’t it?” Draco shuffles his forms, to indicate the conversation is over. Nosy-parker Potter isn’t half interested in Draco’s love life. He might not have had boyfriends, but that doesn’t mean he’s
Draco stands abruptly. It’s a hopeless charade pretending he doesn’t want to be somewhere private to see where the night takes them. He can’t be bothered to pretend anymore and technically Potter’s already made the first move so there’s nothing to lose.
Why are you on Quick-Match if you’re just going to be rude to people?
“Fuck me,” he says.
It’s not exactly a truce, but it will do for now.
“Then I’m glad I did too.” Harry gets quiet and the music soars around them. “You’re not them.”
“Do you like it?” Draco stops, clearly aware of Harry’s gawking. He taps his finger to his lips, studying the picture. “It’s Muggle. Not usually my taste, of course.”
“And Weasley hates
“I’m not sure there’ll be time for that. There’s so much to arrange. Perhaps we can have a party when we get back?” Hermione stands and makes them a cup of tea with a few deft flicks of her wand. She hands Harry his mug, thoughtfully. “A lot can change in six months. You might even become friends with Draco.”
“Let me in.” Draco’s voice is crisp and firm and Harry can sense his magic nudging at the edges of his mind. With a gulp, Harry drops his barriers as Draco draws his wand and whispers, “
It seems like a lifetime ago that Draco announced this year was going to be his for the taking.
“Fine.” Harry rubs his hands together, eyeing something green and toxic behind the bar. Trusty old Apple Sours. “I’ll see what I can do.”
in local magical areas, the hoot of an owl during the evening, or one of the other countless ways that things left behind can remind someone of their presence. It took eighteen months of hedonistic travel and two long, brutal years back in wizarding Britain for him to learn the hard way that no amount of money, good looks or charm could undo the wrongs of the past. During those two years, Draco worked in whatever jobs would take him, from collecting glasses at the Leaky Cauldron to working in the post room at the
The rest of the working day is sufficiently busy that Draco doesn’t have much time to think about Harry until he’s closing the shop for the evening. Pulling a face, Draco removes the quill and notebook he shoved in a drawer earlier in the day. With a sigh of resignation, he taps his wand against the notebook. It opens eagerly, the quill springing into action.
“I know.” Harry’s jaw works. “Do you think I’m stupid for caring so much about this job?”
“I’m here to get you out of Azkaban.” Harry glares at Draco. “
“I love you too,” Draco murmurs, digging his fingers into Harry’s thighs. “I missed you so much it hurt.”
, Harry wants to scream. He meets Kingsley’s eyes and he knows in that moment Kingsley sees everything. It’s as though he’s using Legilimency and Harry’s mind is an open book. Harry’s shutters fall, and he’s quite sure the expression on his face gives him away as Kingsley’s shoulders slump and his mouth sets in a grim line.
“Evening, Head Auror Potter.” Lee winks at Harry. “Very official looking this evening. Not planning to arrest Malfoy again, are you?”
—he’s lonelier than ever.
“Gringotts have a relationship with the Bank of England. I’m familiar with the City,” Draco points out. He takes in the little pub, haughtily. “We usually drink elsewhere.”
“I don’t think he’s going to thank me for anything,” Harry replies quickly. The thought of going somewhere like that with Draco sends his heart racing. “He blames me for being in prison in the first place.” He pauses, his brow furrowing. “Who’s Millie?”
“Millicent Bulstrode, you remember her.” Ginny turns, yelling something at one of her teammates that Harry doesn’t quite catch. “She lives in Cardiff and the Harpies go there sometimes on Saturday night. It’s much nicer than Hollyhead. We bumped into one another at a—in a bar. We’ve been spending time together ever since.”
“I know.” Draco hates being reminded that he can be a selfish prick. It tends to make him defensive and he swallows back the urge to snap back at Harry. He knows he should have put a stop to things long before he did.
Draco knows that as well as anyone, still not convinced he’s mastered how to fully change without tearing himself apart. “Three years of running is a test of endurance.”
“Yeah.” Harry’s body responds to Draco’s proximity, the closeness making him dizzy. He itches to put his hands on Draco’s slim hips, to pull him close and enjoy the burn of his kisses again. He wonders what Draco would say if he asked to be taken, right here, right now. “Ginny gave me some fancy gifts when she got her first payment from the Harpies. It’s from Liberty’s. I liked it so much I’ve used it ever since.”
What would you want him to do to you?
Wondering what all the kerfuffle’s about, Draco turns to face the door at the bottom of the stairs leading into the club. When Pansy squeezes Draco’s arm and murmurs into his ear, it’s a wonder he can hear over the music, the gossips and the pounding of his heart.
“Because you seem like the marrying type.” Draco turns his wine in his glass, watching it slide over the sides. The candles in the room cast shadows over his face, making him seem more angular than usual. “At least you got some of that pent-up aggression out of your system after spending some quality time with your girlfriend.”
“I’ll get better at it, then.” Harry grins at Draco, sitting up and giving him a quick kiss. “I wouldn’t want us to be completely hopeless.”
“I know all that. I haven’t just
“I like it.” Harry squirms happily in the bed and stretches out next to Draco. “I like all of it.”
“You should.” Millie claps Harry on the shoulder. “I’m not going to tell you it’s all going to be fine, or any of that rot. But perhaps one day you and Malfoy will be sitting outside—on a yacht or something, knowing Malfoy—a pair of old queens that have seen more of the world than most. You’ll look back on this and say
“Cheers, Sirius.” Harry closes his eyes and swallows back the tears that threaten. “What would mum and dad say about all this? I reckon you’d know what to do.” His voice dips into a whisper, falters and breaks. “I wish you were here.”
“Come on, you’re fine.” Lee laughs under his breath and urges Harry through the crowd to a table. “Most excitement we’ve had here in ages, people are bound to stare.”
Draco nods his confirmation, suspecting Harry doesn’t really want the full details. He enjoys helping witches and wizards organise their investments. There’s something soothing and mechanical about accounts and budgeting. His latest research has sparked something he buried after settling into the humdrum of his daily work, however. Delving back into the world of Arithmancy with Hermione has helped Draco remember how much he loves the
“Piss off, Malfoy.” An unfamiliar witch gives him a thoroughly unimpressed look. “Wait your turn.”
“No?” Arthur’s cheeks are red, his face pinched. “Then what of the Malfoy boy? Oh yes, we’ve heard all the rumours about that too, not that we would ever have believed them. Lucius Malfoy’s
His confession leaves Harry’s heart pounding, his palms clammy and his cheeks hot. He pushes a hand through his hair and meets Lee’s gaze again, relieved to see the stony expression soften. Lee smiles broadly and the strange tension in the air fades away.
Despite himself, Harry laughs. “I can’t do anything illegal.”
“I don’t want advice from you, thanks. Anyway, there’s no magic inside unless you’re authorised. Club’s warded against it.” The witch points to a sign that says as much and pockets her wand, calling out to the wizard standing guard at the top of a dimly lit stairway. “Malfoy’s clear, no Dark Arts paraphernalia.”
A familiar figure in the distance catches Draco’s eye, striding purposefully in the direction of his shop.
As Draco whispers words Harry never expected to hear—
“I see.” Hermione sounds thoughtful. “Didn’t he want to be here with you?”
“You haven’t?” Harry had assumed this was Draco’s place, a bit like putting on mood music or lighting some candles. If he had a massive bed and cinema room, he’d probably use it to have sex in too. “I thought it was somewhere you used. With other blokes.”
“Someone fucking me,” Harry confesses. He moves his hand down and adjusts himself in his tracksuit bottoms, his cock already half-hard. "I nearly asked Ginny a few times but things ended up going south in that department so I just…never did.”
“You don’t want the details.” Harry’s voice is low and furious. “I know you think it’s gross.”
“Maybe.” Harry sounds sheepish. “The sale only went through last week. It was an impulse.”
“I want sex, not a conversation,” Draco replies through gritted teeth. “I’ll send my review by Owl.”
“Mmm.” Draco makes a noncommittal sound. “I had my suspicions you know. No idea why. Wishful thinking, perhaps.”
“It was wonderful. Too short, of course. But wonderful. Have you been up to anything exciting?”
A sensible man would have closed the conversation and never spoken to Griffin again. Either that, or they would have revealed their own identity at once. Unfortunately, Draco is not a sensible man which is why he’s been chatting to Griffin, daily, ever since. Convincing himself he hates Harry is becoming harder by the second which makes the whole debacle even more wretched. Griffin—
Draco’s Quick-Match Quill vibrates eagerly on his bedside table, the feathers giving an excited ruffle like peacock trying to get his attention. With a scowl of annoyance, Draco strides to his desk and taps his Passion Parchment with his wand to let the quill scribble out several incoming messages in an untidy hand.
as he puts it, but he’s alright. He probably shouldn’t shag anyone—witch or wizard—in the middle of a Muggle park, but I don’t care that he’s gay. Not at all. It’s not for me to say what’s normal and what isn’t. Not doing anyone else any harm, is it?”
“You could always remind them you saved the world. I reckon that should get us at least a couple of flaming sambucas.” Lee flicks his wand, turning the tip of it into a quill. “It’s time for a team name. Any ideas, Harry?”
“You clearly don’t have any taste, not that I’m surprised.” Draco sniffs and sends the Proust back onto the bookshelf with a flick of his wand.
because he’s one of us? Come and look at him, Mikey. Harry Potter here in the flesh, as I live and breathe. A
“Give me time. I haven’t had a coffee yet.” Harry glances at Draco’s coffee machine and nudges his glasses up on his nose. “Is that just for staff?”
Draco turns his hand so it’s palm-up, unbuttoning his shirt cuff and rolling up the sleeve to reveal the now faded Dark Mark. Harry puts his palm over Draco’s and their fingers curl tightly around one another.
, thanks.”
Instead of the frantic fever of the previous night, the kiss is slow and steady. Passion flares through Harry, bright and hot in his chest. The knots in his stomach slowly unwind and for the first time since he started kissing Draco again, he enjoys it without any inhibitions. He takes in the breathy whimper as he tugs Draco’s lip lightly between his teeth, the slide of their tongues together dizzying. Having time to kiss Draco and knowing he’s going to stick around reminds Harry of the long nights that would stretch into morning and the slow tease as they would draw the hours out for as long as possible.
“The best,” Dennis agrees. “So, did they?”
“No.” Harry knows his smile gives him away and Draco pushes a cool, gloved hand under Harry’s jumper. “Maybe. Fancy washing my hair?”
.” A low voice speaks from the shadows. It’s familiar, but Harry can’t quite place it.
“I’ll be back soon enough.” Hermione gives Harry a reassuring smile. “Ron too.”
“This is where it all began.” Harry stretches back on the grass when they break apart and watches as the Thestrals stretch their wings and take to the sky.
Draco’s words leave him with a groan of pleasure as Harry takes him into his mouth, largely to shut him up. Harry concentrates on using his mouth and fingers to give Draco every pleasure. His head spins with the warm, masculine scent that lingers beneath Draco’s freshly washed skin. The delicious stretch of his jaw makes his own prick twitch in appreciation. He’s so turned on, so into every wriggle and twist of Draco beneath him. The air in the room is close and hot, the sounds of sex and the roughness of breath filling the space. Harry’s jaw aches and saliva gathers in his mouth, but he doesn’t want to stop tasting Draco. He works his fingers in tandem with his mouth, before bringing Draco to a rushed, salty climax that leaves his body with a shudder as he collapses back on the bed with a curse.
Fine. Whose voice do you use?
Harry shakes his strange mood away and focuses on Ron. “How long are you home for?”
“I think he’ll be fine, with both of us. We didn’t exactly make things easy for him, going and falling in—well, whatever we’re doing with Slytherins.” Harry tries to keep his tone casual, but he knows Ginny will see right through him. “Have your mum and dad said anything about me?”
“As you were,” Draco replies. In for a Knut, in for a Galleon he supposes. “Stop being so considerate, Potter. It doesn’t suit you.”
Harry laughs. “You sound like Hermione.”
“Do you want me to still be here?” Draco’s voice is quiet and clipped.
If I told you that, we might not be strangers anymore. I wouldn’t want to say anything that might compromise your wanky air of mystery.
?” Ginny shushes someone in the background. “Merlin, are you okay? Do you need me to come over?”
Draco huffs. “Don’t do me any favours, Potter.”
“I’m not concerned about the past,” Harry replies. “I know every last bit of it. I’m more interested in who you are now.” He pauses, clearly picking his words carefully. “I’ve never known you to be with anyone. Not seriously.”
Harry clears his throat. “I’m not sure there will. They fired me because…”
, Harry Potter, are wonderful. Don’t ever let them take that from you. Don’t you dare.”
“A lot’s changed.” Harry shrugs. “There’s still the odd archaic law like this one where we’re miles behind the Muggles, but they wouldn’t have dreamed of firing me back in the day whatever the law said. They would have hushed everything up, probably one or two people would have tried to blackmail me to keep it out of the press. The fact they’d have to let me go shows the Ministry’s reformed, as unfair as the reasons might be. Nobody’s above the law.”
“If you’re going to break the rules you might as well do it properly.” Draco pushes his hand into Harry’s hair and kisses him thoroughly enough that it leaves Harry breathless.
“Pleased to hear it.” Harry takes a sip of the wine. He doesn’t really like wine, he’s more of a lager and ale sort of man, but it’s drinkable. “I’ve been in Wales.”
Harry gives George a small grin, the slip making him smile. The moment of peace is appreciated, and he takes a couple of forkfuls of food as he tries to remember the speech he’s practiced countless times.
“I have no trouble whatsoever believing you’re the same wanker you’ve always been.” Draco presses the palm of his hand against Harry’s crotch, leaning in to murmur in his ear. “Heroics don’t impress me, Scarhead. In fact, I find do-gooders disappointingly
“I’m sorry,” Ginny says quietly. “I hate that this all happened to you. I’m so
Draco’s throat bobs as he stares at Harry. When he speaks again, his voice is gruff. “What do you want?”
“I thought you were going to be an Auror,” Draco says.
“I couldn’t give a flying Abraxan about your magical prowess, Potter. Stop showing off.”
Why the fuck do you want to know?
“Mmph.” Harry swallows, his throat bobbing. At last Draco feels as though he’s got the upper hand back. “After we can—when—err—
“If you refuse to proceed with making a formal complaint, you leave me with no alternative,” Robards says. “You will be dismissed from the Aurors with immediate effect. You can no longer serve as an Auror, Unspeakable or take any active role in the policing of crime or defence of our country.”
. He finally settled into a job that suited him well, at the wizarding library in London. On his breaks he read as much as he could and discovered his interest in wandlore. Once he had found his faltering feet in Britain again, Draco cut ties with the Manor and packed the last of his bags. He left Britain for Paris, where he studied wandlore for three years at the magical branch of the Sorbonne. After that, he spent a further three years in Munich under the tutelage of Mia Gregorovitch.
“How’s America?” Harry gives Hermione a faltering smile and she laughs softly.
“Maybe he doesn’t want to be one of
“It’s Ron and Hermione’s night, no scenes. I’ve had enough of those for a while. Not that I don’t appreciate the thought.”
“All we’ve ever done is talk,” Harry replies. “I’m really more a man of action.”
“Thank you for putting me straight.” Draco hopes Harry doesn’t miss the sarcasm.
of desperation falling from his lips as he pushes back towards Draco. He twists his hands into the bedding, arching when Draco hits the spot inside him again and again. When Draco finally wraps his other hand around Harry’s cock, it only takes a few quick, hard strokes to bring Harry crashing over the edge.
“Is it?” Harry raises his eyebrows. “Hermione’s been burning herself into the ground lobbying for social reform—she’s the main reason homosexuality isn’t illegal anymore. Didn’t you used to call her names because her parents are Muggles? You probably think your precious Dark Lord would approve of your lifestyle. Perhaps you hoped he would have a personal interest in the matter. Handsome bloke, Tom Riddle…”
With a growl of annoyance, Draco leaves the shop to go back to his quarters and determines to put Harry to the back of his mind for the rest of the evening.
“I expect not, but I’m not sure you’ve ever fully understood the power of shame,” Draco murmurs. “I was terrified of other people finding out, of the things they would say.”
. It’s 2013, the Muggles have overhauled that act completely, and repealed the worst parts nearly ten years ago. If you hadn’t been so busy charging off and waving your wand around—”
“It makes me feel sick too,” Harry says.
, announcing his return to England.
“I’m pretty intimidating when I want to be.” Harry tries to lighten the mood, but it falls flat. He remembers how scared Draco was, and why. It hurts to think about it, so he tries not to anymore. “And now?”
Perhaps. Yes.
“Come on lads, let’s leave the shop talk at home.” George breaks the strange, crackling tension with a forced laugh. For some reason Harry has the sense his answer has pissed Lee off even more than the possibility he and Draco might be friends. “We’ve already got enough Slytherins causing problems for us, better not bring another one into it.”
Harry finds words chased out of him and instead he lets magic pulse and twist in the room, his breathing shallow. He gulps out a small
“Bisexual. I go out in Knockturn a lot. It’s how I know Malfoy. Earless knows all about it too, has done for ages.”
Do books get you off? That’s a bit kinky. I bet it’s the leather.
, the gym down a back-alley off Hogsmeade High Street, the last thing he expected was for Harry to take such long, steamy showers and walk around with a skimpy towel to cover his modesty. Although they rarely spoke for long, they were often there together, alone, having discovered a mutual fondness for exercising at weird times. Harry takes an age to dry himself, towelling every drop of water from his body and scrubbing places that really don’t need to be scrubbed after an hour on an exercise broom. It’s as though the Saviour of the Wizarding World has never heard of a Cleaning Charm or Dry-Me-Quick Spell in his life.
Harry steps back and leans against the wall next to Draco. He folds his arms, avoiding meeting the young Auror’s eyes again.
“I thought—” Harry is cut off by Draco sinking to his knees.
“Hello.” Ginny gives Harry a big hug, clinging to him tightly. She pulls back, her cheeks flushed and her eyes shining. “Now listen here. You’re not to be cross with me about filling Millie in on the details. I want to help, and she’s got some experience in these matters—”
“Maybe it’s already our time,” Harry says. “Which means we’d better make the most of it.”
“I think…after.” Draco likes the idea of showering with Harry, but after the events of the last few hours he needs a few moments to himself.
“None at all,” Harry replies. He takes another long gulp of his beer, chasing away thoughts of Draco, Ginny and the peculiar itch settling beneath his skin that seems to be getting worse by the day. “None at all.”
“Why did you leave?” Draco nods towards the holster on Harry’s jeans. “Because of the wand?”
“Talk about blowing hot and cold.” Harry’s lips tug into a crooked smile. He extracts his wand from his pocket. “Are you always this direct with wizards that come into the shop?”
“Yeah, well.” Harry shrugs. They both know he’s not
“I suppose it’s trial and error,” Harry says. He slides his fingers over the crisp cotton of Draco’s shirt, his skin warm through the thin material. Harry breathes in, his fingers tightening in the shirt, his breathing as ragged as Draco’s. “Trying different things until you find something that suits you.”
“Does anyone want to tell me what this is about?” Kingsley pointedly doesn’t meet Harry’s eyes and his stomach rolls. Surely Kingsley wouldn’t have said anything? He wouldn’t betray Harry like that. Not after the years they worked so closely together.
under his breath. “Second, get over yourself.”
“You don’t understand. There are certain ways people expect me to be and—”
have increasingly been erring into more personal territory.
Me neither. Is Jean-Paul your real name?
Hermione laughs. “It would be good for you to go out and let your hair down. I can’t remember the last time you had a proper night out. Didn’t you always do that pub quiz at the Leaky with Lee and George?”
“Crystal clear.” George sounds like he’s trying not to laugh.
“That’s one way of putting it.” Complicated is as good a word as any to describe Draco’s inner turmoil. As much as he wants to shout and scream about being thrown into Azkaban, he no longer holds the belief that he should have escaped the war entirely unscathed. “I see mother and father every weekend. We have supper together on Sunday evenings. Now they’re under house arrest it’s…better.”
“I’m firing you because you’re homosexual.” Robards cuts Harry off, cold and clipped. “Which is a criminal offence. I am well within my rights to have you sent to Azkaban, so I advise you to think very carefully before you speak
“I get by,” Harry says, easily. “I might have to find somewhere to go flying like this, though. I’d forgotten how good it is, not worrying about planes.”
“—overuse my wand. I know, I know. That spare you gave me doesn’t like me at all. If it doesn’t stop being a twat, I’ll swap it for a different one.”
“You know me.” Harry would go down fighting for his friends which includes, much to his surprise, Draco Malfoy.
Ginny laughs, shaking her head which turns her hair to flames. “He’s stinking rich, though. Millie tells me he’s got a fancy art collection shipped in from New York. You could get him to take you for champagne at The Ritz, to thank you for getting him out of prison.”
“About time,” Hermione mutters. With a sigh, she shakes herself, all business again in her element as the dedicated Ministry lawyer she’s become over the years. “The legislation that passed last year was based on the Muggle Sexual Offences Act 1967, with few amendments. We’re decades past that, Harry.
“Getting aroused when somebody kisses you—particularly somebody who’s as good at it as me—doesn’t make you gay.” Draco sits down again, staring at Harry with suspicion. “That’s just biology.”
. Harry has the cheesiest lines Draco has ever had the misfortune to hear in his life.
“Yes and no.” Harry closes his eyes and hums briefly to a song that has the dancefloor in a frenzy. “I suppose you’re right. It could be worse.”
“I might,” Draco replies. “I know most of the crowd that go to The Purple Niffler and only a handful of them are desperate enough to go out with you.”
“But he’d care if I was,” Draco says. His voice is quiet. “Then all that’s left is an angry Weasley, eager to protect his friend and privy to private information that could ruin me. Do I trust him then?”
“Oh yeah, that.” Harry chuckles and reaches for his Alder wand. Holding Draco’s gaze, he doesn’t say a word and Draco’s pyjamas disappear to fuck knows where. “This wand’s a tricky bastard. I think I sent those to the laundry but there’s a chance they might have ended up in Lichtenstein.”
“I know.” Hermione rolls her eyes. “If you’re supposed to be enforcing the law, don’t you think you should make an effort to understand it? Ron’s just as bad. I don’t think he’s read a piece of legislation properly since he took his exams. You’d think the Co-Head Aurors would at least read their own laws.” She tuts under her breath and mutters something that sounds suspiciously like
“I suppose we are friends, me and Malfoy. I doubt he’d agree, mind. He hates
“Obviously not.” Harry rolls his eyes. Draco’s as prickly as a Spiky Bush sometimes. “I’m not very good at sharing.”
“I’m sorry did you expect me to
The suggestion is innocuous enough, but it leaves Draco hot and eager. Damn Harry. It’s a supremely Slytherin move, or perhaps it’s simply brash, Gryffindor confidence in his own desirability. The promise of a debt owed is a clever way to extend this dance of theirs after the Merlin’s Kitchen DJ stops spinning her tunes. It avoids the awkward
“Thanks.” Harry and Hermione make their way upstairs and Hermione busies herself while Harry gets ready for bed. “Are you staying?”
“Oh?” Draco raises an eyebrow at Harry. “I hope you’re not going to suggest I take you there. It’s far too risky. We have to wait until the rumours about you die down.”
kissing, we’ll have to go Muggle at least for the time being. Knockturn’s crawling with your old crowd, itching for an opportunity to have their sport with queers.”
“I don’t know how.” Harry sags back against the sofa, unable to look at Draco. The courage of Harry’s newfound conviction ebbs away from him and he tries to put his tattered thoughts back together. “Maybe you’re right. I’ve got this all wrong, it was a full moon or something.”
They come third, but it’s still the best night out Harry’s had in ages.
They both leave and Harry watches them go, a glimmer of hope taking up residence in his heart. He sits back down next to Draco with a thud.
“Chin up,” Millie says. “There’ll be plenty of bars, plenty of parties. Our lot are good at them, if you like that sort of thing. You’re not going to get caught out, either. You’re Harry Potter. If anyone can spot a shit Glamour on a Ministry employee, it’s you.”
The visit seemed so pointless, devoid of any real emotion. They’d made small talk about everything from the weather to the Ministry, skirting around anything important and filling the gaps in the conversation with uncomfortable, protracted silences. By the time the evening came to an abrupt close, Harry hadn’t asked a single one of the questions racing through his head and Draco hadn’t volunteered any answers.
. If we can’t show one another those, there’s no hope for us at all.”
In the past, if they hadn’t seen one another for a while, one of them would be on their knees by now, sucking and tasting, chasing orgasms. For all they loved the slow tease, after a few days apart their first moments alone would always take on a dizzying urgency. Now, after so much time apart, those desires have intensified tenfold, but neither of them move lower. Harry knows why he isn’t getting on his knees for Draco—
Harry frowns. “Well, I’m here now.”
“I’m learning all about Gorgeous George,” Harry says lightly.
“Lately I think about you.” Harry fights back the heat in his cheeks, holding Draco’s questioning gaze. “Last night I wanted you to take charge. Throw me around a bit, fuck me into the mattress. I didn’t want you to hold back, not for a minute. Is that so difficult to believe?”
Harry stares at Draco. “
“Don’t.” Harry’s good mood fades and he frowns at Draco. “Why do you always do that?”
a rule to break. All he wants is a quiet, normal life with a Crup and the warm arms of someone he loves—whatever the law thinks of it—wrapped around him.
“It is if you want me inside you,” Harry murmurs. He really does have the filthiest mouth. He captures Draco’s lips in a warm, searching kiss and he tastes of salt and toothpaste, which he must have pilfered from Draco’s bathroom. “Are you going to get rid of your Quick-Match stuff?”
“I’m considering it.” Harry looks away from Draco, his jaw set. “Go on, then. Ask me whatever you want. You’ve clearly got a Snidget in your shoe about something.”
“I hate wine.” Harry lets him in anyway.
“I like comfortable stuff.” Harry shrugs and he gives Draco an easy smile. Now Draco knows exactly what that mouth can do, it’s going to be impossible to look at without thinking about sex. “Coffee or espresso martini?”
“We’re on our way home but we couldn’t leave without…” Molly’s voice wobbles. She surges towards Harry and wraps her arms around him so suddenly, it makes Harry yelp with surprise. “Come and see us again,” she whispers. “Please come and see us. We all miss you. I still set a place for you and…”
, his brain whispers.
Harry considers Draco’s words. “The law doesn’t say it’s a criminal offence to be with someone. Who I am doesn’t change, whether I’m by myself or with someone else.” Harry gives Draco a small smile. “It is what it is.”
“Good ones.” The expression on Ginny’s face changes from amusement to stunned surprise as she turns to face the crowd. “Blimey. That’s not something I expected to see.”
“Tears from the phoenix the feather belongs to.” Harry finishes Draco’s sentence, which is pretty rude of him. Harry didn’t spend three years at the Sorbonne and another three years getting yelled at by Mia Gregorovitch. The least he could do is let Draco do his bloody job. “I’m familiar with the concept.”
“Stop, you’re going to set me off too.”
“Yes, I suppose you are. Do you expect me to prostrate myself at your feet in thanks?”
it generally means there’s some big evil looming, and we all know how that turns out. I’ll take a few more years without excitement.”
or if his shop will ever recover, but he no longer cares. He only has himself to blame for giving the most stubborn wizard he knows the most stubborn wand wood. He never told Harry as much, but Gregorovitch always felt differently about Alder than Ollivander, whose notes indicated that Alder wands are best suited to someone with a different temperament to the wood itself. Draco always puzzled over the idea that a stubborn wand would do best with a more pliant owner. When he raised the question with Mia, she told Draco that her father’s perspective was different.
“No.” Ron’s jaw works and he pointedly doesn’t look at Harry. “Ginny told me why she really ended things. I didn’t believe she’d ever have broken up with you over Quidditch. I remember how she used to follow you around as a kid, Harry Potter this and Harry Potter that.”
“Just watch.” Draco leans back after Lee leaves, stretching his arm over the back of Harry’s seat. “Jordan here loves an opportunity to show off his moves. I think you’ll like it.”
?” Draco lets out a splutter of indignation. His eyes flash and his cheeks flush with anger. “Did you come here expecting me to crack open the champagne?” His lips curve into a sneer, and he leans forward with a furious hiss. “Or perhaps you wanted to warn me off, threaten me with Azkaban again. Go on then, Potter. Call me whatever names you want. I’ve heard all of them, countless times.”
“I know enough to understand things have changed. You’ve changed.” Harry glances at Draco. “You’re pissed off.”
“You do have windows after all,” Draco comments. He falls back on a large, opulent sofa and bites back a groan. The cushions are luxurious velvet, like lying on a cloud. It’s fancier than he would expect from Harry, not that he’s complaining.
