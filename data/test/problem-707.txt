“It won’t matter. I’m inviting you in, it should be easy. Why don’t you use Legilimency on me and describe what you see.”
“We’re not going to beat Harry by sitting around and eating Christmas biscuits!” she railed when Percy complained about squeezing in another practice after dinner.
Harry was the only teacher using the Defense room that didn't have another real classroom with its own office. If he’d had time, he could have cleaned this out at the beginning of the year and used it all along. Maybe there would have been less instances of him frantically searching the dorms for lost student work. But the office had always seemed like such an overwhelming project.
With that, the Head of the Wizengamot pounded his gavel, announcing that they were finished, and swept down from his chair and out of the room.
"Enough to merit a skeleton crew," Fred said. "If it's real skeletons, please take notes. We should get one of those for the shop."
Draco shot a spell into the drawer, then levitated a paralyzed spider into the wastebasket. "But I'm trying to imagine a future for myself, now. And I know that everything will always be tied to my past. I'm not trying to get out of that. I just want to build a future I can live with. And I shouldn’t have gotten mad at you over not helping. I can't build that future with you."
“Malfoy. I feel like a shitty teacher. You’re doing half the instruction for the first years, but in this class--”
“Because first-years never do magic that complicated?” Draco put his hand on the door, ready to leave.
It had eaten away at him for the rest of the week. Of course he complained about Potter. Who wouldn’t? He was insufferable and always popping up when he wasn’t wanted. Yes, Potter was on his mind. Often. Because of his irritating qualities.
Harry smiled, because that was it, wasn't it? Draco could make every argument for himself, but when it came down to people actually choosing him--to anybody else seeing the good in him, it was always a shock. He took one of Draco's hands and squeezed it.
When they’d gathered their books, Pansy led the way up front to pay. “That’ll be twenty galleons,” the checker stated, staring Pansy dead in the eyes.
Harry had been plenty of other people, and he'd had many of his friends Polyjuice into him, which he still avoided thinking about. But suddenly the idea of giving Draco that close of a connection with Harry's body felt like a lot. Possibly too much. Draco was starting to know Harry's body, but this would be different, and Harry wasn't sure about doing this all at once.
"That happened one time! You gave up after one try. I know you, Potter. I know you don't give up that easily on anything you actually care about."
“He didn’t do anything wrong,” Harry said quickly. “We were both--” he pointedly avoided looking at Hermione, “confused.”
Draco didn’t know how to say it without Ron and Hermione getting worked up, but he wished Pansy would study more too. The two of them didn’t need to do well, they needed to be exceptional. He needed to convince someone that they should hire him despite his dark past because his NEWTs were just that good.
Draco clutched his wand. O-kay. This might need a delicate touch. She looked like she was fifteen or sixteen year old, but maybe she was a witch who'd magic had gone unnoticed and undeveloped, and that could make her dangerous. "So you're an angel, Claire? Do you have--special powers?"
When the house elf stepped back to find Potter, Draco pushed his way into the house and down the hall. Harry wouldn't mind, not if it was about a kid in crisis.
Several of the kids looked around the room, thoughtful. "Maybe a spell. Is there something to find out if they've taken anything recently?"
"I'm going down there," Draco had replied, already untying his apron with sharp motions. "This is a job for a snake." He didn't know exactly what he'd do, but there had to be some combination of knowledge and words that would frighten Lockhart out of this.
“No, but when I said that, some secret came to mind. Today, we learn how to identify those pet thoughts.”
Molly and Ginny Weasley seemed to be entrenched in a war over priorities. Mrs. Weasley wanted her children’s help cleaning and decorating the house to prepare for the holidays and seemed to want the extra guests perpetually busy with warm tea. Ginny Weasely, on the other hand, wanted every person who was slated to be on her Quidditch team out on their makeshift pitch every daylight moment--and for moonlight practices.
“Were you just going to pat me on that back?” Harry was on the edge of laughter. Draco was glad he didn’t sound hopeless and lost at the moment, but not so glad that Harry was laughing at him.
Potter ruffled one hand through the back of his hair. “Malfoy and I have an unspoken agreement. Specifically, not speaking to each other from now until--well, probably until we die.”
Oh? Draco eyes lifted to analyze Potter without shifting his head. Potter had a stupid smile on his face and couldn’t seem to stand still. What the hell would Potter want to talk about that would make him look like that?
"Don't. Please don’t say you want to end this." he heard himself saying. It sounded so stupid. Why was he begging Draco Malfoy to keep this alive when he was only making Draco miserable?
“Pansy is still sleeping off the last of the sleeping potion that I would have shared with you if you’d only asked,” Hermione sighed. “Merlin. We’re going to have to go with the whole haunted and misunderstood thing you did at your first set of trials.”
The barbed thoughts started. How would Draco make the world better? Rid it of one ex-Death Eater? Everything he touched turned to rust. He’d just have to stay far away from any improvement efforts.
There was a series of crashes and the sound of something ceramic breaking, and Harry looked over to see Draco frowning down at the debris that had fallen out of a cardboard box. "I know that you find everything Slytherin stands for disgusting." Draco's voice strained as he tried to keep it even. "But it's not about
Draco squeezed his eyes shut. He’d done his best, but what were the chances that Potter hadn’t seen right through him? That when he went to complain to his friends, they wouldn’t tell him everything?
Potter shifted from foot to foot. “Um. I was at Hagrid’s just now, talking to Hermione and Ron, and they said I ought to come talk to you.”
Draco knew he should head straight for the hospital, but he found his steps leading towards the joke shop. He didn’t want to turn himself in to strangers, either for the crimes or the confusion. He just wanted someone to recognize him, and set him straight. Fred and George probably wouldn't be there any longer, but if they were, maybe they could help him sort out what had happened with Harry.
“Uhm--the first time I flew on a broom, I s’pose,” Harry answered. “What’s the biggest sporting event you’ve ever been to?”
The Goblin left behind the desk (no skeletons in sight. Fred would be so disappointed) looked Draco over.
"You are doing something," Harry answered. He used his free sleeve to dry his face. "You said you'd take Lacey. When everyone was arguing and looking at one another, you said you'd take her."
“Oh, the trace is a joke?” Hermione responded, eyebrows rising. “Maybe when you come from a magic family the trace is a joke, but it wasn’t a joke when Harry nearly got expelled. It wasn’t a joke when I sat at home wondering what magic you were practicing while all I could do was read about it.”
The first time Draco had really encountered Harry’s stage was when he, Crabbe and Goyle had dressed in a giant dementor’s cloak and tried to spook Harry from his broom during a second year Quidditch match. It hadn’t worked, and Draco had been terrified of the stag Patronus since then. It was a good thing that his Patronus hadn't taken that shape.
He knocked on the door. He'd been there only a couple of days before, and the house had been decorated for Christmas--there'd been a wreath on the door, and paper ornaments cut out by the children taped to the windows. And all of that was gone. Worse, there was no light coming from the windows.
There was silence for a moment, and Draco wondered if Potter had nodded off, back to sleep. Then he looked at Draco.
Harry lifted his flask of Draco-Polyjuice. "Cheers." He took a deep swig and put his long legs to use, easily keeping ahead as Draco jogged to keep up, shouting. "What did you and Ron do six years ago?"
Draco's mouth dropped open. He hadn't stolen anything, but--they'd definitely given him the money, and now it wasn't here. The goblin's hand was already in the floo powder. He'd floo the Auror's office, and they'd have someone here for him in seconds.
Hermione beamed up at him. “Thank you so much for being here today, Hagrid. If we’re lucky, they’ll realize that banning your magic was ridiculous from the very start and they’ll let you carry a wand again. If they’re being stubborn, we’ll have to open a separate case for you, as I believe the case in which your wand was originally--”
She wrinkled her nose, disgusted. "Lucius never reproduced, thank Merlin. He's a disgusting criminal, and anyone claiming to be related to him has no place in my house."
Harry opened his mouth to retort that he'd spent the past half an hour hiking all over the castle searching for Draco, but then he realized, with a jolt like apparition, what Hermione was trying to communicate to him.
“Which Potter taught them to do,” Draco interrupted. “I had nothing to do with that.” It sounded impressive that they’d been able to cast the Patronus spell. It was impressive. But Draco had barely learned to cast his own Patronus. He hadn’t taught them anything about that.
Pansy’s post-war positivity about their classmates wasn’t very realistic. At dinner, the eighth years were shown to a table that sat just below the head table, running the breadth of the room. There weren’t enough students to fill the table, and there were two empty seats between where Pansy and Draco sat facing each other and the eighth year Ravenclaws. They weren’t even the only Slytherin eighth years, but Blaise and Pike and Bulstrode had somehow found seats among the others.
“World cup,” Draco answered shortly. So Potter was sticking as close to the script as he was. Good. “What’s the last dream you remember?”
Instead of starving his thoughts, he let them engulf him. Potter holding Draco’s knee in his hands after the Quidditch game. Potter seeing the scars on his chest and looking into Draco’s eyes with the exact expression Draco had imagined a thousand times and never truly expected to see. Potter choosing to sit next to him on the train back to Hogwarts, and the casual warmth where their knees rested against each other.
The platform was even emptier than expected, and there were several compartments on the train empty for himself and Pansy. The first years they passed stared. One of them actually whimpered when Draco had bumped his trunk against the young wizards’.
"But I can't work for the Ministry properly. I'm not going to commit to that," Harry said. "I'm going to stick at figuring out what's going on in my head and how to live with everything."
Of course, at that moment there was a commotion on the staircase, and Harry rushed into view seconds before Professor McGonagall. Draco vanished his doe and pocketed his wand.
Draco opened his eyes and nearly dropped his wand. The thing before him was graceful and delicate and beautiful and should never have happened.
Draco clutched his pajamas to his chest, listening to the shifting of the house and the foots pounding up and down the staircase. He nearly always changed his clothes in the bathroom at Hogwarts, even this late into the year. If he was quite sure that the others were busy in the library, or Potter was in the middle of marking papers in the common room and looked unlikely to shift for the next hour, sometimes Draco would yank his robes off and tear on his silk pajamas in their dorm room.
Snape had not been a patient man by nature, and years in a job that he was ill suited or ill-prepared for had done nothing to improve his temperament, but he had always shown an extra dose of forbearance with Draco. When Draco had gone to him to learn to control his mind, Snape had been hesitant to teach a fourth year, but he’d seen the value. He’d understood why Draco would need the skills, even if Draco had never explained to him who he wanted to keep secrets from.
Harry turned toward Hermione slowly, shocked. “You said something to make us fancy each other! Malfoy and me, that was your fault.”
The next morning found Draco feeling brighter than most of the eighth year table. He sat at the end of the table still, with empty seats between him and the nearest Ravenclaw, and when Pansy had swept in arm in arm with Granger, he’d felt certain that he’d be eating alone. But Pansy sat next to him and surveyed the table with a twist of nausea on her face.
Pansy and he timed their arrival at the Hogwarts Express just as carefully as their journey to Diagon Alley. Late enough to avoid the crowds, but not so late that the train left them. They were court ordered to attend, it wouldn’t do to cut it too fine.
"First off," Fred said, "Because the bank is closed for the evening, and if you don't mind, gentlefriends, we're not just going to hand over our hard earned galleons to you without a receipt. And second, where is the story, the triumph? The glory? We'll be along to you tomorrow when we've got every penny you're owed."
Gross. Also, useless. “What are you reading, Potter? Or should I ask, which of the books is Pinch going to have to wipe drool out of?”
Draco’s blood boiled. Didn’t Potter think he could learn? He slumped in his seat, openly glaring at Potter, as the last minutes of the class period ticked away. As he stood to make a grand exit, Potter ran his fingers through his hair and caught his eye.
Hermione was just as difficult to convince that evening at dinner. “Draco, I have a theory about why you won’t do your patronus.”
"I know you're a mess, Harry. Newsflash: we're both a mess, and if you think you're good at hiding it, you're not."
Harry laughed, looking around the room. They had run into a few stacks of things, and Harry had made a grand sweeping gesture and cleared everything off the desk with one motion so that they could climb on top of it, which had just made Draco roll his eyes and mutter about how many priceless artifacts Harry was trying to destroy in one night, exactly, before he climbed gamely onto the desk.
Draco raised one eyebrow in an attempt to keep looking cool and aloof. "I actually quite want to know what my birthday present is before I make any more decisions about tonight."
Draco winced. “I tried to sleep. Didn’t Pansy have any trouble?” As she spoke, Ron dropped his books on the table and took a seat next to Hermione. Draco startled at the noise.
"You what?" Draco said, looking around to see if there were other glasses with beverages, hopefully something strong and burning. "I'm sorry, I've been having a very strange evening. I think Lockhart went poking around in my head. It sounded like you just said that you were sort of in love with me."
“You can’t hide the thoughts. And you can’t try to force yourself not to think them. The art to Occlumency, Draco, is allowing those thoughts to starve. They occur to you, have no emotions to stick to, and tumble off in the other direction. People want to keep their secrets as pets, to take them out and play with them in secret, and then marvel that they never die.”
“I wish you’d stop deflecting with sarcasm and bitterness every time!” Hermione snapped. “What do you want to hear, Ron? If you want an answer, why not ask the question you actually mean?
And as the train progressed, Draco began to relax as well. Potter wasn’t paying any attention. He wouldn’t notice when Draco let himself melt into the contact instead of pulling away.
“Homework,” Draco said. “That Defense against the Dark Arts professor is having us write twelve inches on harmless hexes.”
But Sam wasn’t the only one putting up a fight. “You said she needs Defense,” Johnson said. He was pointing his wand at Ron, who stepped back, raising his hands. “We can help.”
Harry looked down, half expecting his legs and hands glowing with ghostly transparency. Instead, he saw that his knee was bouncing again, and he forced it still.
“Maybe we could go to the common room for a few minutes? I bet they’ve all worn themselves down and they’re just draped over the furniture downstairs. There could be snacks.”
"Oh Harry," Hermione looked pleased. A little too pleased. Her eyes were wide, a smile stretched across her face. "You made it for dinner. Draco was worried he wasn't going to see anything of you
Harry's curls were looking a mess now, but he forced his hands to his sides. "Jamie. Go play with the pygmy puffs, and please keep your feet on the ground."
"I'm not a patient person," Harry shrugged. "It's one of my very few flaws. But. You got my letter."
But in the early evening, the Head of the Wizengamot stood and spoke in a reedy voice. “In the matter of Pansy Parkinson versus the Magical Community, we rule that under the guidance of a Ministry approved sponsor, Parkinson may once again use magic at her own discretion.
Potter snorted. “I couldn't learn it from Snape, I don’t know why I thought I’d be able to learn this way.”
Harry's eyes narrowed. "You must have been out of the loop for a while, stranger. That home was open for about four months before we disbanded. I'm the last person you should be asking for help with kids."
Harry let out a sound. Finally, progress. It was something between a groan and a huff, but still. Maybe he could make words eventually. Maybe he could explain.
"What's going on?" Fred asked, looking from Draco to Potter. "You two conducting secret meetings behind our backs?"
Harry shook his head fiercely. "No. Your letter inviting me to teach Defense was the first thing that got me out of my funk last summer. I would never have gotten this far in figuring things out if not for the students. But I think any choice I made right now would be wrong, because I can't make choices right now. And I don't want to end up being a teacher that isn't safe for kids because I made the wrong choice."
It was a pleasure to hear from you on Sunday, as always. We are also anticipating some exciting turns of events during the Tri-Wizard tournament, but I am happy to hear about them from a distance. I would rather you stay far away as well, but I suppose I can’t stop you from attending school events, can I? I do wonder sometimes if Hogwarts is a safe place to send children. Your father has spoken of transferring you, and there are times that seems prudent.
Harry took off, only to hear Draco whining at his elbow, "Why do you always want to run everywhere?"
Draco turned around to watch Lockhart pass. He was dressed in red and gold, and surrounded by laughing lackeys.
"I'm fine," he snapped. "I just need to--this is all wrong. I'm going to find my family. I'm going to find my family and go to sleep, and when I wake up tomorrow everything's going to be okay."
"Are you serious? Sam cried, pounding their fists on their desk. "You've been disguised as each other the whole time?"
The first years were cheering her on without pausing for breath. Pansy came up and stood close behind Draco. “Draco, I’ve never heard of someone stopping an obscurial transformation halfway."
“You know what to do,” Potter whispered, so close to his ear, and Draco nodded, letting out one shaky breath.
Draco started laughing again, and Harry found himself smiling. This was possibly a very Harry thing to do while waiting to have some tense emotional conversation. Defense Against the Dark Piles of Unsorted Junk.
Draco rolled his eyes and sat up again. Potter was safely in his own bed and covered up. “The Board of Governors would shit themselves if they thought they could get you on staff.”
She was yanking on his arm, but her motions didn't have as much effect on Draco as her words. His head jerked up. "How do you know my name?"
Potter. He’ll hate them! Even someone as thick as Potter won’t be confused about my motives.” He looked down at the button, flashing its message cheerily. He felt somewhat sick
Draco shoved his hands into his pant's pockets, feeling for his identification, or his pay stub from the Weasleys, or--
He chanced a glance up to see where Potter was. How had he--Harry had already nosed up to be nearly side-by-side with Draco. Draco inched foreward a bit more. This wasn’t his broom, but he thought he’d gotten used to it during practices. He thought he’d pushed himself during practices, but he could feel the difference now. The snitch hovered feet away from them, and he reached out one arm, pleading
"Thanks." Draco replied, and Harry could tell that Draco was trying to be extra cheery, too. He wasn't asking Harry if he'd forgotten, and it wasn't because he didn't suspect. It was because Draco didn't want to hear the answer.
"Of course I am," Draco said, disentangling himself from the hug ambush. "I don't know what the big deal is. I'm just a little late."
Hermione, as if she’d just noticed Draco’s presence, nodded once. “You can go. We’ve got it from here.”
Sam cast the spell again, grunting with the effort, but nothing would form for them. “I can’t do it. If Lacey gets hurt it’s going to be all my fault.”
Harry startled. Draco realized that encountering Draco in the dark was probably not what Harry had anticipated. He looked closely at Harry’s face, expecting to see thunderclouds--but Harry looked more sad than angry. He was silent for so long Draco thought he wasn’t going to get an answer, but then he cleared his throat. “Thank you for being there. I should have been."
The other students in the class erupted into cheers, and Johnson turned to the other boy in shock. “I did it.”
So when Potter didn’t even come to dinner that night, he cleared his throat and pushed the food around on his plate and said, “I’m worried about Potter.”
“And I told the Headmistress exactly what I thought about sending her home to that family, and she explained to me that Lacey wanted to go home. She has little sisters that still live with her parents, and she didn’t want them to think she’d left them for good. They’re really young, but Lacey thinks one of them might be a witch, too.”
“To win?” Draco interrupted. “You think that will make me happy, so I can cast a patronus and you can mark it off on your checklist?”
The two of them watched him warily for the rest of class, even though all Draco did was walk from student to student and prompt them to think about their thoughts. When the class period had ended, Potter hadn’t returned, and Draco waved the students out of the room, trying not to overhear Sam saying something about letting Death Eaters supervise.
He walked in, swinging the door open wide, and stared at the mess. When had it gotten this bad? Remus had packed up all his things into his trunk and left properly at the end of the year, but had anyone ever cleaned out all of Quirrell's things? When Lockhart was packed off to Saint Mungo's, had anyone gathered his personal effects? There were an overabundance of pink knick knacks lying around, and he'd already scavenged would-be Moody tools from the room. The really dark-looking bits and pieces in here might have been from a Carrow. But this was a Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom--he supposed they could really be anybody's.
The students rushed out of the class at the end of the period, all protesting that they'd known something was wrong, they just hadn't said anything about it.
“You’re not ready to help with this,” Draco answered, holding his wand against his side. So help him, if he got his magic reinstated just to full-body-bind seven first-years and have it taken away again, he was going to snap his own wand in half and start using an umbrella.
Draco accepted the wand. He couldn’t keep denying himself all the things that he wanted. Not when they were so close. His hand closed around the end and he felt warmth. Maybe it was because Potter had been clutching it, or maybe it was because his wand was meant to be with him, and it felt right in his hand.
The girl's face crumpled, and she dashed to stand in front of him, planting her fancy dress shoes in the snow. "You can't say things like that, Draco. How am I supposed to help you when--" in the middle of scolding them, she stopped short and clapped a hand over her mouth. "That's it!" Squinting her eyes shut, she whispered. "Do you think we could--well I know that. There's always a risk that. Yes, of course. Oh, thank you, thank you!"
George had been absorbed in counting the till, and he looked up to Draco and Harry with his wild-light eyes. "We've got the galleons we owe, and get this." He lifted up a knut and a sickle. "Some left over!"
He stood up, steadier now, but also filled with dread. His eyes scanned the road. There were no convenient bags topped to the brim with gold sitting on the steps with him. But he could still see his footprints in the snow. He’d trace those, and maybe he’d find something. Some clue as to where he’d left the gold or how he’d lost the last few minutes.
It hadn’t gone well. The next day, Fred had tossed a copy of the Daily Prophet on top of the pile of Daydream Dummies that Draco was straightening.
"Everything that came afterward. All the excuses and the explanations, all the fake sounding blood magic. Do you know how much good that did me when I was six? Eight? Twelve? Of course I went home when Dumbledore asked me to.
She looked down the table and smirked triumphantly. “He keeps looking down here with this panic on his face. As if he thinks we’re talking about him.”
Harry gave another tug on the cupboard, but it didn't give. What good was being the boy savior when he couldn't even figure out the right incantation to open a stupid wooden box? He yanked again, as if that would change anything.
Several hands went up around the class, and Draco pointed to a Hufflepuff in the third row with hair in dozens of narrow braids. “It’s shielding your mind.”
Was this girl some accomplished legilimens? Never mind. "That's her. We'll take you to Luna and Harry. They'll know what to do with you."
“Good morning,” Draco returned, wishing that Pansy could communicate to him what role he was supposed to be playing at the moment.
Draco couldn't. He couldn't go to the home and face Fred and George. They were finally celebrating the fruit of all their hard work, and couldn't watch their smiles go brittle and fall from their faces. He couldn't tell Potter what Lockhart had promised and kill the lights in Potter’s eyes. He couldn't see the kids gathering around, realizing that something was wrong, realizing that it had to do with the home but that all of the adults were going to try to keep it from them.
She blinked. "Oh. I know all about you, Mister Draco Malfoy. If you don’t mind, could you get out your wand and get us dried up and warm? It would be a pity for you to die of hypothermia after I jumped in to save you."
Draco was dangerously close to emotions he didn’t want to share. “It doesn’t matter, Potter. So I’m failing Defense. You can’t be expected to teach me happiness. Thanks to Granger they’re not going to chuck me into Azkaban for failing a class. I’ll be just as good a cautionary tale for children with or without the defense skills.”
The door cracked open, and Draco's heart lifted just a little. Maybe Andromeda would call him in. Maybe they could talk about this.
“Fairy lights,” she told the Fat Lady, and stepped into the Common Room without looking back at Ron.
Draco had conveniently neglected to give the map back, which meant he actually had to search. It meant checking the common room, and then the library, and then realizing it was almost time for dinner and that everyone would be heading to the Great Hall right now, and if Harry really wanted to talk to Draco, he'd have to go too.
Granger frowned at her friend. “You didn’t bother to look at who was teaching the class?  You do know about Defense, don’t you?”
Sam took off like a spell, bouncing up the steps and twisting around the landings. Draco followed as quickly as he could, but Sam reached Lacey’s side before him and had grabbed onto her arm. There were several other first-years gathered around Lacey. Draco wasn’t surprised to see blue and yellow robes in the mix, but when he saw two of the first-year Slytherins, he paused.
A First-year in Gryffindor robes skidded into the entrance, looked up, and darted toward Draco, grabbing him by the sleeve. “Professor Malfoy! Professor Malfoy you have to help!” Draco looked down at the figure in the robe.
"I'm not a witch, Draco," she said. "Your kind aren’t the only ones with power. Now, you wanted me to meet Harry Potter?"
But Hermione and Ron didn’t look the least bit interested in discussing Viktor. They were both looking at Draco. Hermione’s face was calculating, Ron’s shocked.
Draco couldn’t see the man’s face, but the voice seemed familiar. The ministry had found him. Which meant that he existed once again. This was his Diagon Alley, with his joke shop, and his  Teddy, and his Harry Potter.
They made quick work of the rest of the questions, and when all of the groups were done, Slughorn let them leave early to lunch. Potter peeled away from the class before Draco could stop him, off toward the eighth year rooms. Draco found himself walking between Pansy and Hermione, with Ron and Seamus just ahead of them. He was just starting to relax. There was still truth potion in all of their veins, but Potter was safely away now, and he hadn’t asked Draco anything that would make him spill secrets he’d rather keep.
Potter gaped and turned to watch Draco go. He could feel the four-eyed stare on him all the way out the door, as he grabbed Pansy’s elbow and dragged her out of sight.
Harry, as usual, had opted to take a high vantage point and scan the field from there. Draco stayed lower. Even though it might be harder to spot the snitch, there was a chance he’d be closer, and he’d need every advantage he could get on this borrowed broom.
One again, Draco was relieved to be able to shake his head no, although now they were too close for comfort. “Nope. Not a stag, either.”
I did. It was for the Order. It was for him. It was what I had to do, and he knew I would do anything. He knew I would do anything he asked, and he asked me to keep going back there, and I may hate my Aunt and Uncle but I still--I loved Dumbledore. Even when he did that."
“It’s not you, it wasn't you. You and George and--” his voice broke, “Fred were the only ones who ever came for me. The adults. Dumbledore and McGonagall and--Merlin,
Sam wiped a sleeve across their face, smearing tears and other fluids. “She’s outside the Common Room. She won’t go inside. We found her by herself.”
“Honestly, Potter.” His voice sounded false, but there was nothing for it, he had to keep plowing through this. “This is what you get for always listening to your fan club.” Close the book. Gather up the notes. No stopping now. “And first years. They thought I was a death eater a week ago, and now they think, what? That I’m in love with you?” His voice was getting stronger. It was magic. “Of course that makes more sense than the idea that anyone wouldn’t adore the boy savior. What a joke. I’m going somewhere peaceful where I can actually get some studying done.”
The little colt ran a circle around the whole happy mob. Harry brushed it away from his face. “Lacey, why’d you cast your Patronus?” Maybe he was worried that she was feeling the oncomings of another obscurial attack, but Draco hadn’t had to ask. He knew it was the same reason he’d cast his Patronus earlier. It wasn’t about the protection, it wasn’t about the dark.
"Harry," Draco snapped, dropping a handful of broken teacup bits into the bin. "I can't believe I even came here. I am still trying so hard, and you're not giving me anything back."
Pansy.” The bite was back in his voice, and this time he felt like he needed it. He wasn’t sure how to explain the situation in his own mind, much less share it out loud. But it would be one part the fear of Potter learning things he shouldn’t know, one part the tension of second-guessing everything he said and did, one part a longing for a future when it wouldn’t be like this and one part the inability to imagine such a future.
Right. Harry raised his cup and took a gulp, and Draco mirrored his motions. And then, in a series of horrifying shifts, Draco became Harry's image, and Harry became Draco's.
At the end of class, Potter asked him to stay after again. Draco cut Ron off with a glare before he could make any comments.
“I’m sure that will be convincing. Telling the ministry you cast an unsuccessful Patronus charm. I’m pretty sure they have a record of you casting one of those several years ago, actually.”
Hermione managed the spell, but before either Ron or Pansy could move to send another patronus to Harry or the nurse, four of the first-years had their Patronuses pelting down the stairs. Sam was staring at the end of their wand, furious. “How come mine isn’t working?"
"I will never be able to read the story of the Deathly Hallows the same way again. I'm sorry." she cleared her throat. "You chose to keep the cloak. And in the story, that lets the youngest brother hide from death until he's ready to go. It's a good ending."
The first years filed in, clustered so closely together that most of them kept bumping into the kids in front, who were walking with the slowest of steps. When the whole group had gathered in the hall, McGonagall stood and cleared her throat.
“Ginny,” Charlie frowned, “You can be on the same team as Harry next year. I think you’re taking this all a bit too seriously.”
Ron shot a nervous glance at Draco and Pansy, as if checking to see whether they’d taken offense. “But you insist on sitting with them anyway?”
Draco humphed and settled into the best seat, next to the window and looking forward. Harry sat next to him. Draco sat straighter, holding himself very still. This was fine. It made sense. Harry knew that Ron and Hermione would want to sit with each other. It was nothing unusual. His thoughts were starting to grow too large before he could starve them. They were starting to gorge themselves on emotions.
Hermione was in the middle of reassuring Draco about the lack of wine when the Weasley girl opened the compartment door and pushed herself into the already rather full compartment.
Potter frowned and leaned on the back of the chair behind him. “What’s the wording on the probation, exactly?”
She shook the snow off her head. "I don't know if you're hearing me. I don't have a home around here. I live in heaven. I'm an angel."
He wasn’t surprised to find that the party had been much more focused on beverages than food, and any snacks that had previously been up for grabs were long gone.
“Oi!” Ron called. “What’s the big idea, Draco? It’s almost dark, and now you and Harry have to catch the snitch again.”
“I’m not going to walk in there by myself after everyone saw me hanging back with you. They’ll think I’ve murdered you already.” He didn’t ask Potter if he was scared. He didn’t need to.
But Draco hadn't stopped to listen. They were technically his bosses, but that was exactly why he had to do this. They couldn't be the ones threatening the competition, and they'd be terrible at it anyway, since subtlety was not in the Weasley's skill set. But the shop had to be protected, and that left Draco.
Claire hopped down the steps and took a nibble of her cookie. "We should get walking, I think. And I told you, Draco. Just like you wished, you've never been born. Without you, Harry wouldn't have kept the home going past the first few months. Hasn't he ever told you how much you helped him?"
He knew what it must say. He knew what most of the gravestones in this cemetery would likely say. But his hand reached out anyway. It moved almost on its own, like an arm that belonged to someone else. He dusted away the snow from the bottom of the stone.
Rather than rising to the bait, Granger’s face clouded with confusion. “He’s still hanging onto your wand? Why in the--I told him to owl that back to you eons ago.”
The trial proceedings--from sitting in the waiting room, to Hermione launching into an impassioned argument that magic was a fundamental characteristic of every witch and wizard and that to restrict the use of magic was to restrict their being and potentially cause irreparable harm to their well-being, to Hagrid’s testimony about being wrongfully expelled from Hogwarts and having his wand snapped for something Tom Riddle had actually done, to Pansy trembling on the stand and explaining that she was falling behind in her classes because she was afraid to practice the spells on her own, to Draco getting up on the stand himself and saying as little as possible to avoid insulting or offending anyone, to the Wizengamot’s discussion of how dangerous and evil he and Pansy might be, to the moment they reached a verdict--took most of the day.
"I wanted to go over the details for the Christmas Eve entertainment. What time tomorrow should I have the kids here by?"
"Find a mirror," Malfoy grinned, snatching the quill off the floor and twisting it between his fingers. Harry looked in the foe-glass, because why not, and saw the words "git" and "prat" scrawled on his face, sometimes complete and sometimes in pieces, wherever he'd been able to smack the quill away quickly enough.
For every memory he could think of wanting to grab hold of Draco, there was a matching memory of telling himself no, that it wasn’t the right moment. That he would do it wrong and upset Draco. That he should keep his hands to himself.
So when he faced Healer Goodnight, instead of telling her about Lacey and Ron and talking to Draco in the Defense office, what he said was. "I'm a ghost."
Potter’s shoulders eased. Draco knew he’d be able to talk about the girl. “She’s fine for now. McGonagall wasn’t exactly thrilled that I’d put Occlumency on the curriculum for the first year students.”
When the fourth child—he looked Muggleborn, although Draco knew he wasn’t supposed to think that people looked Muggleborn—was also assigned to Slytherin, he looked around in terror. A couple of Slytherin students applauded weakly, but this boy didn’t move off the stool either. “Do I have to go?”
It didn’t make any difference. Even after Draco followed Harry to their room and crawled into bed, his nerves were far too electrified for sleep.
Potter flapped a hand. “It’s not the Defense classes. Besides, that’s me. You’re Draco Malfoy, you’ll probably be a natural at it.”
Harry stood up, and Ginny scooted her chair around so she could study both of them. "That's really interesting, random person. And really, no offense met, but, why are you in our house?"
Draco had to suppress a gag whenever the front page of the paper was Saint Potter, cutting the ribbon for the house, or Saint Potter, marching his perfect little charges down the street to get ice-creams, or Saint Potter, picking up a crying four-year-old to comfort her. And he couldn't complain to his bosses. They enjoyed a ribbing at just about anyone, but Potter was their patron saint, too.
“Oh Merlin,” Potter breathed, taking two steps toward Draco. Ron’s room was not large, and this brought him uncomfortably close. Draco wished he was holding his wand so he could put something defensive between Potter and himself.
"As faculty. At Hogwarts. It doesn't have to be the Defense position, like you said. I could teach Muggle Studies, although we are going to rename that. I suppose I'd be pretty pants at instructing Transfiguration, but I could give it a try."
“What do you really think of—“ It took Draco a moment to locate the question he really wanted to ask. “Of us coming back.”
"I'm not going to work for them, either. Not next year. I mean, maybe a bit. I'd like to help Hermione get her new department sorted out, and if I can, I'll probably spend some time doing that."
Pansy’s brow furrowed. She seemed uncomfortable, out of her depth. “That you’re obsessed with him. Why else would you take the time to make all these buttons for him instead of just cheering for Cedric or--"
“Exactly, Potter. I understand that you like to live on the edge, but some of us prefer routine hours of sleep.”
His voice sounded so confident. But then, Draco knew now, the Weasley twins always sounded confident, and then they worked instead of sleeping.
That was exactly what Harry intended to do, but instead when he opened his mouth, what came out was, "Why didn't you tell me you were going to ask McGonagall for a job?"
"Of course you're the problem," she said, and then, when she caught sight of the expression on his face, she softened. "No. You're not a problem, Harry. You're a good thing. It’s not your fault you’re the way you are, either. But at this point, you are the one responsible for sorting yourself out. And you already knew that.”
“It is an honor and a privilege beyond what I can acknowledge to welcome all of you to a new year at Hogwarts. Most of you know that we have been through the darkest of days. For those of you who are new to this world, you should know that we look to you as a great hope. There was a time I thought we would never see another class of first years walk through these halls. But here you are. Let it serve as a reminder to all of us that hope can be found, even in the darkest of times, if only one remembers to turn on the light.”
Healer Goodnight frowned. Today she was wearing earcuffs that glimmered with tufts of dandelion fluff, and she fiddled with one of them as she studied Harry. It was the only thing that changed about her appearance from week to week, Harry realized. The black robes were the same as always, her hair, her shoes. Everything was the same. He wondered if that was some gesture of goodwill toward her patients. Trying to keep things consistent.
"Five, four, three, two, one! That's it!" Fred shouted, flipping the sign on the door to "CLOSED to YOU, NUMPTIES" and jiggling the lock into place.
Draco knew he had to get to his coat, and wand, and make sure the girl actually got warm. But he took a moment to rub his forehead. This had already been the worst night of his life, and now he'd been interrupted by a
“It’s Lacey. She’s got bad thoughts, and we’re trying to help, but something really weird is happening.”
Potter ignored him throughout dinner and the apparently yearly tradition of listening to Celestina Warbeck’s Christmas special. Fleur complained about the radio program, but it gave Draco an ache in his chest. His mother loved Celestina Warbeck, too. Hermione still passed him a cider and Ron still offered him a pudding. Draco figured that whatever was going on between Potter and himself, they were staying out of it.
Whatever he was doing differently this time around, the Gryffindor class did not seem to be going well.
"To save me?" Draco frowned, realizing his wand was still in the pocket of his coat, up on the bridge. It was going to be a long slog up there, but the girl was right--it wasn't going to get any easier as they got colder. He managed to kneel. "I jumped in to save you."
Draco didn’t turn around. Why hadn’t he disguised himself? Why had Pansy left him? Why did Weasley have to notice him just when the cashier was glaring at his money?
Draco had never seen the spell behave in this way. The light had started small and wispy, but it was growing. The first years were chanting, “Lacey, Lacey, Lacey!” and the light had started to pull together. The other Patronuses had gathered around the nebula of spellwork, sniffing or flicking out tongues at it. And Lacey, who had tears streaming from her eyes and the beginnings of a bloody nose, held her wand steady and stubborn.
Neville glanced up. “On my bed? I have enough of sitting and studying at desks in my actual classes. This makes me feel much more relaxed.” He continued on, probably happily dripping ink all over his sheets.
Draco shrugged. "They like me, too. They trust me. I wouldn't have told McGonagall I thought I could do the job, otherwise."
Potter was always destined to catch the snitch. He was golden, and they were drawn to them. But for the rest of the day, Potter was always within reach, always checking to see if Draco was okay. Draco felt like he might be the actual winner here.
“I said, can you hear anything I’m saying? I wanted you to look like a human today, not a strung-out house elf. When was the last time you slept?”
But Pansy was a different story. He let her get away with her little joke because she never pushed it any farther. In fact, it was almost like a code.
“What do you think Potter will think of these favors I’ve made?” he asked, tossing one to Pansy. It was an effort to hold back the smug smile.
Ginny laughed so hard she had to bend over to catch her breath. "Wow. Your reaction was even better than his. That's my tax for getting dragged into your mess."
"I'm going to figure out how to be healthy. And maybe happy. And then, I'll think about coming back. If there's a place for me."
“I don’t have any wine to give her,” Draco muttered. He was showing up at the house of a family whose son was dead because of the war and he didn’t even have a good wine to thank them for their hospitality. Luckily he’d been able to get to Hogsmeade to buy a nice selection of chocolates, but they certainly didn’t have any bottles in that town worth purchasing.
Harry felt a wry smile slide into place on his face. "I think what you said was that anybody could do it, so why not you?"
Time to make an exit. “I believe Molly wanted us inside for Christmas Eve dinner, and I’ve got to wash up.”
"Because Draco has always been a much stronger Potions student, and I believe the rapport he has demonstrated would easily transfer to the Potions position."
"And I feel like going home," the goblin snapped. "Have you got the gold, or have the Weasleys sent their pet Death Eater to beg for mercy? You must be good at it, if you've survived this long."
The moment the words were out of his mouth, the answers were compelled from the other four. “Viktor Krum,” Hermione and Ron said in unison, while Pansy answered, “Oliver Wood, of course.”
“No!” Potter protested. “Well, I was grinning. I might have been gloating. I just--I was happy. Naively happy, as Malfoy helpfully pointed out.” Potter scuffed his feet on the carpet. “Can I go now?"
"The particular position I'm interested in has come up every year I've been alive. I think I'll chance it. This is what I'm going to do." The more Harry spoke, the more certain he felt. "The thing is--I'm not doing well. I killed Voldemort, and everything's supposed to be better now, but things don't feel right. I don't feel right. There are so many people I haven't even really talked to since the end of the war. The only time I deal with what happened is when I'm sleeping and I haven't done enough of that this year. I've been seeing a mind-healer, and I want everything to be faster, but it's not."
“Oi,” Ron said, poking his head into the compartment. “Is dropping the door on me your way of saying you’ve seen enough of us over break?”
"If Draco's going to be Potions professor, does that mean that you took the job as Defense teacher?"
“Each of us may be missing someone in these halls, and I have faith that we will treat each other with a compassion that bears in mind all that we have lost and all that we stand to gain as one. With that, I believe the sorting hat would like to introduce himself.”
Andromeda looked up from where she was taping up a last package for under the Christmas tree. "Draco. Don't keep Teddy up late. She's going to want to stay up late tomorrow. Read her a story in bed."
Draco clenched his teeth. "I was going to the bank to make a late deposit," he forced himself to explain. "For the Weasleys. I got there, and I can't find the money."
“I thought it would only be fair to warn you all. I get nightmares. And I know I could just ward the curtains and everything but when I wake up, I’m a bit disoriented, and I need somebody to talk me down. Nev already knows all about it and he’s agreed to help, but it might be disturbing. In the night.”
McGonagall sighed. "It was a bit of a mess. I had a rather large discussion with Kingsley about it, but I think we have a plan. She's technically the ward of Hogwarts School now, but you're the one down on all the paperwork to take care of her. We'll have to have those two...ministry officials back to get everything squared away. It means you'll have to stay at the castle this summer and get permission if you're going to take her anywhere farther than Hogsmeade."
His words seemed to startle McGonagall, who cleared her throat. "As you should, Potter. As we all should"
He wouldn’t admit it to Potter, but standing in front of the first year Slytherins and Hufflepuffs was actually making him short of breath. They were staring at him, and he couldn’t read their expressions. Fear. That had to be fear. And disgust? Probably.
But in his Potter-like manner, he plowed forward. “I just wanted to say that I’m sorry for what I did with the spell. And I can understand why you wouldn’t want me to be anywhere near you after that. I wasn’t sure where my boundaries were. But I will destroy you tomorrow in the match.”
The snow stopped so suddenly that Draco shivered. He hadn't even noticed that it was slowing down, and suddenly the sky was empty. The last flakes settled on the girls' white-blonde hair.
“I think so,” Granger replied. “Although we’d have to get them to agree that the previous rulings were unfair and ridiculous, which about eighty percent of wizarding law and justice is.”
"But Harry--why would you--there's so much--how can you just--" Hermione's eyebrows weren't the only part of her face pulled together in confusion and frustration. "Harry, you can't just quit."
Whomp. Something sped into Draco’s side. He tried to correct, but his weight sent the broom tumbling end over end until--crash. He landed in an untidy pile on the ground.
At least, he reasoned, he had kept the coat that looked good on him. It would only be this cold and miserable for a few more months. By this time next year, maybe he could afford something warmer.
He watched the door as the first of the eighth years made their way to bed and the room emptied. He watched as the fire in the hearth burned lower and lower, and he hoped Harry wasn’t getting himself in too much trouble with his big mouth.
As he fell into the rhythm of school, Draco recovered some of his confidence in the classroom, if nowhere else. No Quidditch or orders to sneak Death Eaters into his school left Draco with only the endless loop of his own mind and his textbooks, and he preferred his textbooks.
Hermione sighed. “Honestly Ron, he knows that I--” she looked back at her book. “Draco, you’ll still be here in half an hour, won’t you? I have some points I want to go over with Hagrid for the trial.”
“So,” that gleeful, predatory grin was back in Potter’s voice. “You’ve had a crush on me since fourth year.”
"Except that you're supposed to teach a lesson on Occlumency," Draco pointed out. "So the fact that you don't have much of a grasp on Occlumency or Legilimency could be problem."
Oh. Draco should check that. His chest ached and he wasn’t sure he was actually breathing. He heaved air into his lungs and pulled the broom out from under him. “Fine,” he muttered. “My body broke my fall.”
“You’ve got to catch up somehow,” Pansy insisted. She was lying on the couch with her feet on Granger’s lap. Draco had not imagined that outcome. He’d have to ask her about that. Later.
And then, off to his right, the glint of midwinter sunlight on a golden wing. Draco couldn’t help it, his first instinct was to glance up to see if Potter had noticed. It was a terrible move as a player, because Potter always had one of his eyes on Draco, and he noticed Draco checking. So much for his advantage. Draco urged his broom down the field. He stretched his long form along the body of the broom, inching as far forward as he could and still maintain balance. A little farther.
Draco shrugged. "We probably could have made a better argument if I had told you about it beforehand. Besides, I feel entirely stupid for getting everyone off track that way, because it's really about Lacey."
“I mean,” the boy continued, “I used to have this voice in my head all the time. Not a real voice. A meaner version of me voice. And when I was doing transfigurations, or potions, or flying or defense, the voice would be telling me over and over again that I was useless, and basically a squib, and I’d disappoint my family cuz I’d never be any good at magic. Since you’ve been teaching us about organizing our brain, I know how to notice that voice, and put those thoughts where they belong..”
Draco startled. He wouldn’t have guessed Potter was paying enough attention to notice that Draco’s glass was still full of the first round.
“Sorry—I was just thinking. I think it will help people get used to you if they can see you around. Doing normal person stuff.”
say something. “Morning, sleeping beauty.” Draco hadn’t lost his touch for choosing the words that would get to Potter, and he could see the blush get worse.
Draco opened his mouth to explain to her why that wouldn't help, but then the bricks disassembled themselves and moved aside. "That's convenient." And odd. It was definitely one point in favor of her being a witch who didn't know about it.
With the trial over and the prospect of using his old wand for NEWTs, Draco decided to throw himself into studying, a pastime which Hermione approved of greatly and Ron and Pansy had no patience for.
Harry sighed. Sure, he could have the girl turn out her pockets and find the nosebleed nougat. But what good would that do anyone? If she was already this desperate to get out of class, he might as well--
Hermione closed her eyes and blew a long sigh out. It was so much easier when Ron and Harry were the ones causing all the problems.
"And I'm glad the joke shop is going to be alright." Draco answered. To say nothing of the children's home. With Lockhart arrested, he wouldn't be able to do much to slander Harry's Home.
Harry surveyed the tiny skeletons of Doxies that had collected at the bottom of the cupboard. "I'm thinking, Draco. You know I'm not the swiftest."
"You can't expect me not to do anything," Draco's voice was tight. He was holding back. All this rage and he was still holding back.
She made a soft noise in the back of her throat, but didn't speak. Not to comfort, not to ask questions.
"I don't want to spend my whole life hiding from death. I thought that I would face death when it came, but I tried to face it, and I didn't have the follow through. I couldn't go on. I'm just here like a shadow. And some days it's almost like life. Some days I can actually--I can eat the birthday cake, or whatever. But then night comes, and I remember that no matter how good things are for a second, I'm never going to get away from these nightmares."
Draco couldn’t afford to start a fight, but if he paid that much of his books, he wouldn’t be able to afford everything. Especially if other shop owners had the same bright idea.
On top of that, I've been really disappointed at the transphobia coming from an author of books that have given so many people powerful lessons about love, empathy, and justice. Every kid deserves to feel safe, cherished, and supported at Hogwarts. For me as a member of the fandom, the incredible fanfic, inclusive to so many different kinds of diversity, gives me a lot of hope. I hope my stories, in tiny ways, make Hogwarts more welcoming.
Pansy’s concern would have disappeared from his mind if it hadn’t been from a letter from his mother later that week.
Ron interrupted, “That’s the biggest load of--first of all, the first years found him the moment he walked into the castle because they knew he could help.”
They split the students into two groups, and Harry-as-Draco instructed his group to keep a journal of their emotions throughout the week. He'd chosen some of the tougher students for this group, the ones he worried about. When he was being Draco, they all listened to every word he said, even when he went on and on about their journals. Maybe having the power to read your students minds really was the key to being an effective teacher. He set them to writing and watched Draco with the other half of the class.
“Because there are less of the eighth years?” Pansy pointed out. “Look, it’s going to be fine. None of our friends are coming back. Maybe this is a good opportunity to make new friends.” She settled into her seat and propped her head against the window, falling asleep before the train had started lurching forward. She slept a lot these days
Sam grabbed Draco’s robe again. “What’s happening to her? We don’t want to get sent away, we want to help.”
“I know you’re not happy now, and that makes it hard to find happiness anywhere in your own memory. Casting your patronus isn’t about forgetting that you’re sad or afraid right now, but it is about knowing that there are other things you’ve felt. It hasn’t always been this. Find something that works, Sam.”
Here--his footsteps were disturbed here, sliding and scuffing, and it looked like someone else had passed this way, too.
“You look fine, Draco. Perfectly coiffed and everything.” Pansy leaned against the doorway with an irritated crease on her forehead. “If we’re doing this, let’s do it now.”
With a flick of her wand, Hermione traded her carefully arranged breakfast plate for the empty one in front of Malfoy. He glanced up at her. She was not looking at him, instead focused on actually serving herself breakfast. But after a moment, she lowered the utensils in her hand and met his gaze. “Can I help you with something?”
Hermione and Ron passed by in their Auror robes and called out greetings to the children. Draco lifted a hand in greeting, then turned back to the kids. "I've got to go hide in the store so I don't scare away all the customers that you little goblins draw in."
Draco continued in the calmest voice he could muster, “I think you’re hosting a Defense Against the Dark Arts exam in the hall outside Gryffindor tower. That’s what’s happening.” The place on her arm where Draco’s hand rested felt more substantial for a moment, as if he was holding onto a person and not a very dense ghost.
Pansy, while she looked considerably better-rested than Draco, had copied her appearance for the day they’d gone to get their school supplies before the term. Her hair was loose and unspelled, her face bare, and her robes common. When they reached the apparition point, Draco reached out and gave Pansy’s hand a quick squeeze. For all her optimism and scheming with Granger behind his back, she was just as anxious as he was.
Draco had plenty of chances to get used to being talked down to by children lately, but it still got his hackles up. "Okay, Miss Claire Hanahan, Angel Second Class, who came to rescue me. We've both had a nice dip in the water. Any other big plans to help me out?"
"What the hell are you doing?" the door swung open, and he was faced with some version of Andromeda, one with deeper lines in her face and a bite to her voice. "I just got that little stinker asleep, and you want to come around banging on the door?"
Potter was shaping up to be a decent professor. He gave them a syllabus on the second week of class. Draco could agree, from an objective view, that the syllabus covered important things, but as a student he wasn’t looking forward to learning the things on the list with the people in the room. The first unit was about casting Patronuses, which was review for most of the eighth years. They’d been part of the secret club that practiced together while Draco waited outside for a chance to turn them in. He knew the spell, he knew the concept behind it--he’d even tried to cast it a few times. But nothing ever happened for him. Being graded on the spell didn’t improve his work any.
Harry laughed. “I don’t think I’d be good enough for any of those professional teams. Besides, the press, the fans. I’ve had enough of that.”
Harry meant to go up to his room and owl Draco that he had decided to quit being a git. He wasn't actually over it, yet, but Draco staying mad at him was awful, and he had been the one who banished Draco from sitting with their friends. So, yes. He could write something conciliatory, and Draco would forgive him, and everything would be fine again.
Harry was looking over Ron’s head at the Slytherin table. “Huh?” Hermione followed his gaze. He was staring at Malfoy, who was showing off some new feature of his Potter Stinks badge to the table.
She started to laugh, "Just hide the evidence. No one's going to want to listen to us sing if they think I'm a flower murderer."
And then Draco's hands were in Harry's hair and looped behind Harry's back, and even though the first touch still surprised Harry, he reached back. Draco was really pleased with the picture already, but Harry was hoping he could go two for two.
Draco cleared his head. "If you have them here at ten, we can make sure they're all in costume and ready by ten-thirty. We'll have them sing for an hour at a time with half-hour breaks, and you'll be standing next to Santa so the parents can get pictures with Santa and you."
"Yes," Harry said, and he could hear that his voice was lower. "If you can separate the person from any potions they might be taking, one of the most efficient solutions..."
“Do you want me to go on listing things?” Malfoy said sharply. “Sorry for hexing you, and saying rude things about Granger’s teeth, and always taking shots about Weasley being poor.”
She had the look in her eye that Draco associated with her punching him in the face. It burned just to look at her. She radiated determination and power. And this, Draco realized was how Hermione reacted when she was really nervous about something. He wished he projected anxiety as power instead of looking like--what had she said? A strung-out house elf
Harry swallowed. He knew Ginny didn’t pull any punches before he’d come to talk to her. He must have been looking for this kind of truth.
Harry was so close. He was close enough that Draco could reach out one arm and pull Harry’s shoulders until they leaned against his, until Harry’s head tipped under Draco’s chin. Potter wanted to protect everyone, he just wanted to make sure Potter was alright. So much for starving that thought, it bloomed and demanded Draco’s attention. Think. Not about that. About what to say to Potter.
The only exception to settling into their same seats was Potter. Instead of taking one of the seats, he lounged on a stool in the front of the room.
Harry ran his fingers through his hair, his signature move for when the kids were driving him crazy. Draco didn't know what he'd done to merit that.
The answer was everybody, and since that had been Snape’s answer, too, he’d never needed to ask the question.
Potter spoke up before he could manage anything. “What? That’s not fair, Ginny! I invited him. He should get to be on my team.
Draco took the drink when Neville handed it to him, but he didn’t even take a sip. He had no intention of doing so. Alcohol would cause unpredictable things to happen to him. Besides, he felt—uncomfortable drinking it. Aside from a few sips of wine at meal times with his family, he’d never had much to drink. Certainly not enough to get drunk. He’d always watched inebriation from the other side, and it looked… not like something Draco wanted to try. But how do you explain that to Gryffindors?
Draco didn't protest when Harry dragged him into the Gryffindor cheering section, even if he did glance around with an irritated expression at some of the banners. Hermione spotted them coming and jumped up, waving her hand. "Oh, Harry, Draco. You made it!"
"Wait, Draco!" Harry said. "And you, Dawes. Thompson. You've got to wait. They're coming.” Harry caught sight of something out the window and ran to the door, flinging it wide open. "Come on in!"
Draco stood and took a few steps up the bank, but nearly lost his balance and had to grab onto a rather thorny plant to keep from falling back. "And you didn't think to come up and talk to me? We'd be a lot drier."
“Now would be a good time,” she said. It felt like pressing her luck to push Ron this far, but if he didn’t say what he was really thinking now, she was going to lose her mind. The jealous angry act did not look good on him.
In fact, they weren’t engaging with him at all. Hermione was holding a hefty tome that he couldn’t see the title of.  Ron had a similar one open next to his plate, and was scanning the text with fervor.
“I’m not a professor,” Potter frowned, instead of appreciating Draco’s attempt at a joke. “Besides, I already know you know plenty of hexes of all kinds. Come to the party.”
Draco found an empty compartment and moved quickly, letting the door slide shut behind him, hefting his bag onto the top luggage rack and pulling out a book to keep him company. At least Pansy would look for him.
“Huh?” Draco realized that Neville and Weasley were laughing their way out the door and it was just Potter and himself.
Potter reached over and put his glasses on. “I didn’t know I had an audience.” And even though Potter was the one who should feel self-conscious because he was the one unraveling, Draco could tell he was starting to blush. Good thing it was dark.
Because it was late evening by the time they made it back to the castle. They’d missed dinner, but he didn’t care. He could--well, he couldn’t make food out of something else. But his magic was his again, and he could wait until tomorrow morning for food.
Draco tried to manage words, but he was still reeling from the panic he’d been experiencing and confusion that Weasley was asking him to be on her team for anything.
"No." The idea was almost laughable. If anything, he needed to start thinking about where he wanted to start donating the old gold from the Black family vaults.
Draco angled steeply toward the ground and jumped off before his broom came to a halt. Instead of giving the snitch to Hermione, who was tending the ball box rather than participating, he flung it as hard as he could at the ground. The ball stopped inches from the mud and veered away.
Draco opened his mouth, then shut it again, He didn’t know the rules of this game, but that was his fault, for not being there. Right?
Pansy and Granger weren’t just exchanging looks, they were leaning across the table to whisper to each other. He stood up. If they wanted to have a private conversation so badly, he could facilitate that. He had studying to do.
“But that’s not actually the most interesting part of it. Did you know, that’s when Harry became master of the Elder Wand? You were actually master of it before Harry, and that’s why Voldemort couldn’t use it in the end. If Voldemort had disarmed you before Harry did...it might have all gone the other way.”
Draco felt like a hornet’s nest that had lived long-dormant in his stomach was being poked by Potter’s words. He tried to let the words slide off him. “I’m not a stray puppy, Potter. I don’t need your charity.”
who had come to join the match, were beaters. Arthur, Hermione, and Angelina Johnson, who had joined as a guest of George, served as the chasers.
When Draco didn’t say anything, Potter spoke up. “I may have just told McGonagall that what Voldemort did to the school will look like child’s play if I ever find out that Lacey’s been sent back to her parents.”
Everyone else was sitting. He should sit too. Hermione and Ron were going over their notes and coaching Hagrid through the kind of things he should and shouldn’t say in front of the Wizengamot.
Oh. They weren’t exaggerating when they said something weird was happening. Lacey wasn’t crying or having a panic attack.
Hah. That would go over well with the Ministry. Why doesn’t the Malfoy boy want to Defend Against the Dark Arts? Could it be because he’s still trying to fight for them? No. That wouldn’t do.
"I think I can tell what's junk and what's not," Draco responded, directing his wand at another pile. "If you want to save any of the dark odds and ends you've been keeping for lessons, you better hurry up and sort them out before I get to them."
He was making it to the Great Hall for more meals lately. It shouldn't feel like a big deal, but the wave of noise washed over him, and Harry stood still in the midst of the chaos for a moment, breathing. These were happy sounds. This was good chaos. He found the glow of Malfoy's head from the entrance and kept his eyes locked on that beacon as he made his way across the hall.
He was mere centimeters away from contact when Harry seemed became aware and looked over at the hand inching toward him. His eyes shifted to Draco’s face as Draco hurriedly pulled his hand back and pretended to be stretching his other arm.
Draco leaned back in his sheets and chuckled. Maybe he should have left Harry feeling afraid to touch him. It was probably the only way he’d be able to best him. “Ginny will be very disappointed in me.”
“I don’t know what Potter has told you about Defense Against the Dark Arts,” he started. Well, at least his voice sounded imperious. The few first-years who hadn’t been looking at him jerked to stare with round eyes. “Probably teaching you that it’s a lot of silly wand-waving and shouting Expelliarmus louder than your enemies.”
Draco had the child’s instinct to list a thousand injuries so that Harry would keep one steadying hand on him and send more magic through him, but he couldn’t be that pathetic. Especially not with the entire Weasley clan, plus Bill’s work friend and Angelina Johnson clustered around. “I assure you, Potter. I’m fine,” he managed.
just let it be. And we weren’t powerful enough to make them listen to us. But they have to listen to me now.”
