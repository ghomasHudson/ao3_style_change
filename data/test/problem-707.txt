"Was she a duellist?" I ask and approach the image. Beside her is someone else. "Who are the people next to her in the photograph?"
Or rather… Someone.
Hugs,
“I am sorry about saying it like that,” I mumble a quick but honest apologize. "But I really, really like you," I open my eyes and land on Dray's. Eyes blue like the summer sky stare at me with bright amusement.
“An Imperio can fix everything now that Young Black isn’t fighting against me anymore.”
"It could be I hexed a kid on the last day of school and it could be possible that Professor Flitwick was a witness," he tells me.
NOVEMBER 20th, 2002
He laughs a bit and that little sound gives me hope. What a painful thing to hold to, really.
Draco is still so young. The war didn’t change the naivete of his soul. It just made him mature enough to understand the difference between bad and wrong, and from wrong to horrendous. Being a spy for Dumbledore wasn’t easy on him, but he still keeps some of his childish treats… His childish innocence. Like stickmen on his PJ’s, smidges on card box or a glass of warm milk after bedtime.
He takes one step forward.
"And what truth is that, Lucius?" I ask him, raising my eyes and trying to focus on him. “The truth that I disfigured my son? The truth that Sectumsephra did irreversible damage to Cissy? The truth that I was too cowardly to hand over my son to Regulus Black, without even turning back?"
“You are better,” Ron says to me. “But you have someone to look after,” he pats me in the shoulder. “Just as much as Parkinson have to look after someone else.”
Dray blushes madly and he is a sight to behold.
They are here, if their magical cores are something to go by.
I sit on the edge of the bed and shake Dray carefully.
"I wish you could see yourself with the eyes that I see you, Harry," I tell him in a low whisper.
Well, all hell break loose. So, there's that really.
Harry disappeared a few seconds ago with Dray Black in his arms and I can see in Moody's eyes his desire to murder the first unfortunate person to cross his path. The silence that reigns in the room is so dense that I'm sure all of us can hear a pin dropping in the room.
"You're right," she tells me, putting her hand on the doorknob. “Harry, no matter how Draco looks to you now, I don't want you to make any face, nothing to suggest that he still doesn't look quite right. Okay?"
"What was an attack on your dignity, Darling?" Magdy asks me, the same woman who looked after me in the afternoons after I came home from school.
“Harry,” Hermione’s arms are around me in a moment. “I am so sorry we didn’t help you enough.”       I sigh in her shoulder.
“Fraternizing with lowers beings then you, Draco,” I stop again, making Winky stops as well.
I wrap Dray and his cello in my arms.
I smile to Bill, trying to reassure him.
HARRY
Those were the words Neekeal whispered to me. I really don't know the names that are written here or who the head of aurors supect of. However, Robards and Neekeal assured me that there, in the pouch, were all the people who had contact with Narcissa Black before Draco Black was born. That information was provided by Robards and Neekeal, even if Harry and Ron weren't able to find everything, they found a few pieces. Neekeal and Robards tore that clues apart, trying to find some kind of path.
He nods softly. A smile is thrown in my direction and butterflies erupts in my belly.
Kreacher bows, his nose touching the ground and then fixes on Dray and steps back, his large eyes showing terror.
Hermione smiles at me and I can see love shine through her warm eyes. Thank God for someone as cute as ´Mione.
Harry nods.
“I need you to tell me about your Immortality Orb,” he says to me.
"Harry what are you doing?" she asks me, her eyes looking at the letters.
"Yaxley and Rowle are in Voldemort's inner circle," I tell her. "Now that you say it, Rowle was there." I tell them, lost in a memory.
The words disappear but I am sure the little genius is not done yet.
Dray falls silent and I let the silence grow between us. When I was little I heard the school music teacher tell Petunia that Dudley couldn't play an instrument because he was too slow to learn it.
Bill nods.
Emmm... Bellatrix basically being Bellatrix.
"But what if he believes all those lies one day?" he asks me with his bright eyes. Tears shining in his clouded eyes.
Hermione discovered something new about Draco Black's past.
Most likely, she has to make sure if this person is good for Harry.
"Now is not the time to watch and think, my love," I tell him, taking his erection in my hands. A new pair of ties wraps around his ankles and forces him to spread his legs wider. "It is only time to feel and let go." I moves my hand up and down on erection and a moan escapes his lips. "Good?" I ask him, needing to know if everything is in order.
There is a photograph of a girl with silver blonde hair like Dray's, with a couple of black locks in every temple. A slight smile of superiority is painted on her face, as she holds in her hand a small trophy that has two wands on it. She is wearing a back dressing gown, which is weird.
Hugs,
Severus and Lucius are completely silent.
"How do you know it was a Him?" I ask him with concern.
“If you hurt him, I am going to make your life a living hell,” I say to him in a dark whisper. I smile at him. “No pressure, healer Morris. I am sure you know what you have to do to help him.”
I smile at Arthur's easiness.
"Teddy likes plants," says Scorpius. "Can we put something like that on the cake?" he asks thoughtfully, as he begins to put on chocolate chips that resemble a Muggle flower.
"Kids, class is over now," says Hagrid. "If you are late, Professor McGonagall will punish you," I hear Hagrid's booming voice and I can't help but smile, remembering when it was me who was trying to stay so I wouldn't go to McGonagall's classes.
“Dumbledore wasn’t at our side,” I whisper, feeling broken. “It was never his intention to keep the Black family alive.”
"My name is Scorpius Hyperion Potter-Malfoy," he says proudly. "I am three years and nine months old and I also have a twin who is older than me for..." He looks at me and I mumble a faint two. "Two minutes."
I hear him laugh and it's the most wonderful sound I've ever heard. He extends his bare hand to me and I immediately take it in mine and let out a whisper full of horror.
And I take one from the pile on the tray and bite the head of the gingerbread man.
"You good?" Harry asks me.
“No, Severus. But I am going to make his wish come true. Bella told me all the ways Potter took him. And I want to take him the same way.” He says with greed. “You can go now, Severus. I will have a pleasant conversation with the Young Argentum about a better way to talk to Bella. I want for him to never lost that bright, mad stare he had today for a brief moment. I want to make that stare… Permanent.” He looks at me. "I am going to need for you to make more potions, Severus. It is after all, thanks to you that Bella was able to brake his mind. All thanks to your genious." He moves his hand dismissing me.
"Is he here?" she asks me, putting the spoon aside and smiling broadly.
"Those wards couldn't be forces in any way," I whisper, remembering the lies McGonagall revealed to me when I went back to Hogwarts for me eight year. The wards that surrounded the Dursley's houses wasn't my mother's. They were Dumbledore. "Whomever did this, Malfoy gave them his consent to pass the wards."
"Your kids are a problem, Potter," Cooper tells me, trying to hide a smile, because everyone in this office knows my kids. Not because they have ever been in the ministry, but because we have met many times in the park or in magical restaurants.
"If you're done, go put on shoes to accompany Papa to the ministry," and immediately there is chaos, the sound of chairs against the floor, and hasty steps on the stairs. "And clean your teeth before coming down!"
"Yes sir," Dray says to nothing, raising the wand in his left hand and closing his eyes. "It's not LevioSar, it's Liviohsa," he mimics Ron and I can't help but laugh. However, most things in the room start to levitate a couple of inches off the ground and I feel really proud.
Well, probably yes, and so is Professor Sprout's blood pressure.
What?
A pair of silk cloth-ties wrap around his wrists, holding him tight, in the position where I leave him, restricting his movements and causing the blush to spread to further into his chest. I summon a new piece of cloth, and wrap it around his head, blindfolding him completely.
"No, I just need a room," I say quietly.
“How can an Occamy knows about smells and magic?” I ask her, sipping carefully the mug.
And then he laughs. And the kitchen is filled with giggles and laughs and I feel happy.
“Yes, Healer,” I say to her. “And if you are as smart as I think, you will do good to remember that,” a silent threat lingering on my words.
James' eyes sparkle with something I can't name.
“Fuck,” I whisper knowing this is worst. This is worst then being alive. I grasp my wand whispering a spell to put him in comma and then, casting an extasis charm on his body.
She nods, hugging me briefly and then, letting go of me.
"Remember: home, children, kisses, food, bath and sex," I whisper against his pale cheek. “I love you and will be by your side for all eternity. So wake up soon, so we can be happy for another one.”
Ron and Hermione look at me, waiting for me to say yes.
"Why? You wasn't the one who broke up with me because you wanted someone to hold your hand, while I was actively trying to become a better wizards, trying to tame my own magic."
"I am pretty sure Luna wouldn't mind," she says to me and I know it is true.
I am not gonna ask for you to left something, since I was missing. But, I am glad to be back here! So...
“Well, I think our jobs are reversed now,” I say to him. “Because I always was told that I should be the one to destroy Horcruxes.”
“Before Mister Malfoy was found in his home bleeding to death? Or before you took a medical decision that was just to make by someone close to him?” he angles his body forward.
"Until Wednesday, Healer Lewis," he tells her, as he taps the chair with his wand and it rolls forward.
"Don't you want it?" I ask him in a whisper.
"Draco, you will close your eyes," Madam Pomfrey instructs me. “And you will let Harry's magic guide you. You won't be able to say a single word, Mr. Potter,” Madame Pomfrey looks at Harry seriously.
"No, it's not an earthquake, kids," I tell them, walking towards the twins, pulling Scorpius out from under the table. "Daddy's just ... upset," I say to the twins, placing Scorpius in the surface on the island, James climbing into a chair next to Teddy. "Love," I take Draco's hand in mine and pull him to me. Draco is trembling with rage. "Teddy, take your brothers to our room. Watch TV for a while, yes? It's still early to go to Molly's.”
"I am not a hero, Dray," I let him know. "I am as human as they come."
, 2002
GreeneySilvery.
"Excellent decision, young Black," Olivander tells him. "Unicorn hair core, nine inches, is very flexible," the man tells him, looking at him. “It is one of a kind. But, it reminds me of you." And he smiles at him with knowing blue eyes.
Albus looks at the candle.
"I love you, Teddy," I tell him, taking the blanket and covering him with it.
"Uh," I look at Dray with wide eyes. "A what?" I ask him, not believing what my ears have just heard.
“Never mind,” she says. “Maybe you just need to have depression and the curse will find a place to live into,” she says seriously.
“Being is spirit that the moon leaves to gather souls,” the Occamy hisses.
"Did something bad happen at work, Harry?" my dad asks, as he lowers his latest muggle acquisition to look at my best friend.
"Narcissa Black did not leave due to lack of support from her family, then," I murmur, as I realize what Ron is saying. "Because they didn't kick her out, because she wasn't a fault."
This is the person Voldemort has long sought.
The wand in my pants pocket vibrates and I take my eyes off the beautiful vision in front of my eyes.
"What precisely is your intention with my godson?" I ask him directly, looking him straight in the eye.
“Oh, you both are just a menace,” she says, handing them the fabric of the magical tent.
“You might rise, Severus,” and I do as he says. “Take your place beside your fellows Dead Eaters,” he orders with tired voice.
I nod slightly.
“Hello, Harry The First, “she calls me that.
"Hey," I say, lifting his chin carefully not to hurt him. "Do you know that Daddy and I are here to listen to you and always support you, do you know that?"
Those are the words that forms in the air. Golden letters glowing softly against the white wall of Saint Mungo’s.
"Don't let your father hear you deny the titles you hold," Magdy continues to tease me. "What can I bring you this time, handsome?" Magdy asks Harry with a suggestive wink.
I whisper back to him.
And that is for tonight. Enjoy, my darling, I am gonna make some supper.
Those were the worst month I had to survive, with Teddy complaining every other day about his mouth hurting. So I will cut my work short with the aurors to spend my evenings with him and Draco. My husband in the sofa, reading books about healing magic and muggle medicine, and me cuddling with Teddy while watching the best Disney stuff I can find back there. Teddy's little feet in Draco's lap and his face in mine, his eyes gleaming whenever Pumbaa and Timon entered the screen.
I think I will change the days of updating to Saturdays, because work and college and concerts are killing my week time. So, week-ends shall be.
"Harry!" I hear my name and the next thing I know, Hannah Abbot is by my side, making me walk somewhere. "I'll take you first with your two troublemakers and Teddy," she tells me in a serious tone, and then, hand me some papers. "I'm going to need you to sign this in order to help Draco," she says seriously, as we stop outside a door. I don't even read what Hannah wants me to sign. I am confident that she would not harm my family, much less my husband. "Thanks Harry. A nurse will come looking for you before you can go to  Draco before surgery. ”
“Who the fuck warded Malfoy’s house?” I ask for third time, while trying to unthread the massive ward. It’s like being lost in a fucking hurricane of threads.
I see him looking at Teddy.
“I will answer whatever it is you want to know,” I say to him softly, trying my best to keep my cool.
“That’s pretty ugly magic,” she says.
I fall deep into my core, where nothing can touch me. Not their mean words, or the painful of their magic and their curses. Not the things that are trying to change me. I grasp the strands and I think about Harry, trying to emulate his magic. My desire to be with him. My desire to be possessed again by my soulmate.
"Where are we?" he asks trying to hide a yawn. His gray eyes, hidden under the curtain of his eyelids.
"That means Robards will have our asses today because we still haven't found Draco Black according to Robards," I tell them with a deep sigh.
In time.
And yet, I have done the same. The wrong reasons that will win this war.
"I love you," he whispered one last time. "I will give yours back when you are healthy and ready to take on the world again, sweetheart." I left a kiss on his forehead before closing the door and walking toward the hospital entrance, then apparating at the Burrow.
“Not here,” I say to him because I cannot say where she is at the moment. It can ruin her career.
“Do you want for me to start ironing my ears, Severus?” I ask him with no regard for his wishes.
"You look silly," says James, as he looks at me. Draco and I looked at each other, and I watch him remove a bit of the icing Scorpius put on his cheek and slide his finger across James's nose. "Daddy!" James sulks and looks at me.
“He shouldn’t be up,” Goldstein says, taking a step back. “We are not still sure what he has or how to make him better,” he says in a whisper.
"Another Death Eater," Ron tells me with a sigh.
I smile with sadness.
"Harry Potter should be charged with kidnapping," Moody says aloud, tapping his cane on the floor of the room. "No one knows where he took the boy."
Draco leaves the room and pauses for a moment, his face turning in my direction and giving me the most beautiful smile I have seen him in recent days. I barely notice the lady from early is gone.
the letters change colors. They are glowing a playful violet.
I smile softly. Back when we were at Hogwarts, my Father told me not to talk with the odd daughter of my batty aunt. When the war started, I decided on my own volition to avoid Luna at all cost. If I ever were discovered, they surely will harm Luna. As the knowledge of the Wizarding World is so small, they never discovered my parentage with Luna or Ron Weasley. Even if I am not fond of Weasley, I am fond of Luna.
"This Dray, it's the sport of witches and wizards," I say softly. "And, I think there is no witch or wizard who has not played it in their entire life," I tell him softly. "Except for my best friend, Hermione. Hermione is only passionate about books,” I wince in understanding and disgust at the same time. "She is a bookworm, Ron say."
"Draco is awake, Harry," I hear Hannah's voice through the fireplace and let happiness wash over me.
“Harry,” Hermione admonish me rather quickly.
Dray stretches out his hand, white skin, and long, slender fingers, proof of his true nature as cellists. And the first to shake it is Professor McGonagall.
This is so messed up.
"What time is it?" he asks me, opening his gray eyes completely.
“The what?” I ask her again, feeling utterly confuse.
Ron's face turns to pure curiosity and I grab my wand with one hand and cast a copy enchantment on the pages, which immediately double. I stand up and take off the robes of the aurors to feel more comfortable, a pair of black jeans and a T-shirt from the Ramones.
And yet when I see Hannah I think it's okay for them to find out about this. It doesn't matter, if Draco is okay, if my family is okay, everything else pales.
"Round two?" he asks me and smiles at me innocently.
And I set down to start destroying the Horcurxes.
"What are you laughing at, Potter?" he asks in a serious tone, and I try to shake my head quickly, so as not to make my husband angry, and then I feel something cold on my chin. "Now we're even," he says to me with a smirk on his lips.
My mother hit him in the arm.
"You mean when Lucius cut off his ears?" I ask him, feeling the need to find Dray, wrap him in my arms and never let him go.
“What?” I say, not believing this.
I feel numb and yet, I am smiling.
“Harry,” I stand up and extend my hand in a polite manner, as Hermione taught me. “Harry Potter.”
"What about the Virgin Witch case?" He looks at me as he throws the question into the air.
“I love you,” I whisper against his fading body.
Black blood gushing out of the wounds, but I am free. One shackle free.
"Very well," says the hat, and I can hear joy in its voice. "Ready, Mr. Black?"
"We have the best children in the world," Draco whispers to me, as he snuggles against my chest again. "I would not change them for nothing. I wouldn't trade us for anything. ”
"I love you, you know?" I ask him, while I leave a kiss on his head.
I stroke James's dark hair and look him in the eye.
“He is my evil twin, because he was born out of the evil of the evilest being alive,” I say, balling my hands into fist to avoid hurting something or someone in this room.
She smiles up at him.
“You need to let it go, Draco,” A soft voice that resembles Harry’s is talking to me slowly.
His eyes move below his eyelids. My magic is restless and my whole body tenses. Once again, with a little more force, I shake the blonde's shoulders carefully, but he is still trapped in the nightmare. I sigh pulling my hands away from his body and rearranging my position on the bed to give him as much space as possible. The room is cold and I conjure two bluebell flames to heat ad light up the room.
“Ron is a pureblood, in everything but in believes,” she says sure of herself. “He is Ronald Billius Weasley Prewett. Son of Arthur Weasley and Molly Prewett, two purebloods and part of the sacred twenty-eight.”
Left kuddos and comments. Let me know what you all think.
Cheers! Goodnight. I am off to bed.
"R-r-room thirty-six," she says and then she blushes.
"It wasn't sex, Ron," I tell him, but don't stop. “It was just a kiss. A very good one and… "
Thank God, 'Mione has learned to control her know-it-all side.
What I am experimenting is not my own pain. This is Dray's.
"I'm Dray," he tells him as if it were an everyday thing, a sincere smile painting his pink lips, as a slight blush settles on his cheeks.
"Kreacher will do as told to please his Masters," he says, snapping his fingers and disappearing from view.
“Okay, let’s go to the Ministry,” she stammers, unsure of her own words. “We need to talk with Kingsley about this stunt."
"What did the Bones boy say to you?" I ask, casting an ecstasy charm on the sandwiches. I see Draco entering the kitchen. I reach out and Draco immediately takes my extended hand, putting himself in the middle of the kitchen island.
Father smiles to me and motion his hand for me to continue.
However, I know that Dray will become a target. Voldemort may ignore this for a couple of days, but there is no way he will ignore it for long. Especially not with Lucius Malfoy among his ranks.
If this wasn't so gloomy, I'd be laughing.
From one moment to the next, light begins to come out of somewhere, small and hurtful, the light feels like stabs in my eyes. Whoever was locked up there for a long time.
I see them run to the kitchen entrance and grab their “masculine”, a word I am pretty sure they still can't say, colored aprons with animated dog faces on the front.
I can feel a lonely tear working it’s way down my left cheek.
And neither I am in his sight range.
"Why does everyone say your name like you're some kind of Olympian god?" he asks me then he stops. "Or some kind of cult member" he says, looking at me with his gray eyes, full of curiosity.
A bit late, but as soon as I can. I am starting to work again on the 18th, so... Yup.
Regulus is one of the last people to be with Narcissa Black when she was alive, if they are father and son, it is possible that this boy, so sweet and beautiful, could be Draco Black and if so, he will need all the protection he can have. even if he doesn't fit in our profile at all.
He is tired. I can see it in the way he moves himself.
"At least I have someone to kiss me, Moon," I tell him in a serious tone, having taken Ron's hand from my mouth. "Not even because your mother is alive does she want to kiss you," I tell him harshly. "Or been seen with you, for that matter." I know I am being vicious, but this is easy when I have my intern Snape to help me with it.
I look behind me and Scorpius has his hand in the air, like he's one of my students.
Redfern just look me dead in the eyes.
"Me too," heard Draco's voice, followed by a small chuckle. "Stay away from troubles."
The blond is practically bouncing on the balls of his feet. His energy practically cannot be contained by his own body, just like his magic. His magic is growing stronger the most we spent time together and sooner then latter, I will have to chatt with Zephora about Dray's well being.
"Great, Mione and I can go with you and have a double date," he says seriously.
"Are you sure you want to continue, Draco?" she asks in the sweetest tone that any healer has ever used.
Thank you so much for reading this... It maybe might make nosense now, but in the future it will. This journey is aproaching its end pretty fast and now I am on vacations (for a week) I'm planning to update as much as I can in this time.
I laugh.
“Harry was their Lamb of God,” I whisper to her.
"But, the Bohs are fluffy and soft," I hear Scorpius tell Draco with a pout on his lips.
"You don't have to be scare anymore, love," his voice is just a whisper, but it gives me enough security to open my eyes again. This time, the sky has been dyed black and a huge silver sphere is shining overhead, illuminating everything. Harry's sphere of fire, keeping company with whatever is floating above our heads. "Look. That's you too,” the light, though intense, doesn't hurt me.
He says, handing me the paper.
Hermione is quick to nod since she has been looking in my direction, which is opposite to Draco’s.
"Half past six," I reply placing myself between his legs and bending down to kiss the full lips of my counterpart.
I watch Hannah, as we stop at one of the benches in the almost deserted hall.
In half an hour I must be with the Aurors.
Dray turns to me and he smile at him softly. I wonder vaguely if it won't hurt his face to smile so much. However, I set the question aside and focus on the place, instead.
"You," he says seriously, as he begins to raise his wand. "Harry Potter, I will take you to my Lord and you will die at his hands."
he nods softly.
"Once," he tells me, trying to contain his laughter. "I remember there were a few minutes to go until the premiere of El Toro or The Bull with the children orchestra in France, I was cello first and I had to play the cello solo," he laughs softly and squeezes my hand. “And I arrived when they were tuning. It was a very big shame, because being a cello first guarantees you a place in front of the stage. The director looked at me so seriously, I thought I would cry. However, I think he let it pass because I was the youngest member of the Orchestra. At that time I was four years old, and after that, I throw such a big tantrum that my dad took the initiative to assume that all my concerts and recitals were half an hour earlier than the program said, jus to be on time,” his eyes darted. crystallize and I know that Dray is in a very distant moment. “It was a nice day, playing for the president. But, really, I have the best dad in the world. I can't imagine anyone else running around with a two and a half years old kid, paying for private tutors, entrusting his child to a stranger, just so said child can fulfill his dream."
"See you later, Mom," he says as the book closes and settles back in front of the trophies, one of which was won by Narcissa years ago, if not more. "Guide me then, Monsiur Potter," he tells me fluently, however, there is nothing fake when he says Monsieur.
DECEMBER 11th, 2002
“You are to rest,” she says softly, through greeted teeth. “You are not dying!” she is red in the face. “You survived a war and Mr. Potter here has gone to lengthy shit to make sure you are really good.”
"Ha," he says to me and crosses his arms. "You can keep dreaming, Potter," and leans back.
I stare at the two people in the photos, while something inside me stirs uneasily.
Ron is fast on his feet.
Luna's question leaves me completely disoriented.
"Harry James," Draco scolds me once more in an almost inaudible whisper.
I look up at Dray and he wink his eye at me.
"How do you leave something so valuable in the forest?" Neekeal asks.
"You are a fucking teaser," I tell my husband with no feeling behind my words.
Nope, not Potter. Definitely Malfoy, the evil of the Malfoys is what shines in my son's eyes. However, I know that my son has a beautiful heart. Scorpius has a heart as beautiful as his other father's, because that's the way Harry is, completely beautiful.
"All of them are death eaters," she mumbles against her own hand, her mind lost in toughts.
I still stand inside my own core, my own magic flowing by my sides. Orange and fiery, a few dark strands and a lot of silver threads. I touch one of the many silver strands surrounding me and I feel pain again, and I brief memory, like eyes opening.
I watch him breathe deeply, as his hands go over his curls. Harry is the most beautiful man in the entire universe right now.
“That shit is not good for him. He is rogue now, just his mate will be able to bring him down earth,” he says.
"St. Hellen Hospital for Wizards and Magical Creatures," Ron whispers, nodding with conviction. "How hard can it be?"
"Here are two silver heads and one black head," and the Patronus disappears.
"She is this way," my mother says and I immediately start to walk by her side. "It is a little door, but I am pretty sure you will manage, my beautiful boy. You are growing so much, and faster than ever, I want you to know. You will be a hell of man soon," she says. "I cannot wait to meet my future in-law and all the grand-children I know you will have."
And that he, my blondie love, did. He destined thirty minutes every day to navigate through the telly, the cable that he insisted he needed to do a thorough job and an equally thorough inform. He took an unhealthy love for History Channel, I remember. He would watch The Science of Stupid presented by Robert Dallas, and then he will compare it to Arithmancy and Potions.
"Because it's important," Hermione replies as if that might answer Ron's question.
"He liked you guys," I tell Ron, as we get into the elevator. Wardwood enters right after us. "However, you already know that. I am glad he liked you lot."
“And I really don’t understand why you want to live in such a poor place,” he says, like if he is scolding me.
HARRY
Instantly, Dray is holding the book with long, elegant fingers.
"And you will continue to attend your rehearsals in the afternoons, my young genius," Dumbledore tells him, but I can hear the doubt in his words. "I'm not asking you to stop, just to help us a little bit."
"But, I appreciate it, Ron. Ginny levaing and George being mad about it. I even am grateful for you breaking something like that to my non-boyfriend-yet," I tell him, giving him a smile. "If your comment contributed anything, it was to take a big load off my shoulders and also to our first kiss," I laugh when Ron makes a disgusted face. "So thanks".
However, nothing happens.
I nod as I walk over to Scorpius and hold out my hand.
I reach out and immediately feel Dray. I sit up immediately, my eyes resting on his slim figure. His entire body seems to be fighting something that only he can see.
"We can have a really nice love triangle, Harry," he whispers to me. "You, me and the love that we will flourish between us," Dray rests his head on my chest and, suddenly the hippogriffs begin to stomp in my belly. "I don't need you to apologize for her, Harry," he tells me softly. “It doesn't matter if I don't understand half of the things you say when you are talking about magic. I care that you want to explain them to me and I want to learn them. Because in a few years, when you talk to me about your days I want to be able to understand everything, and figure out if you need a hug or if we need to plot the dead of some else. Ginny's comments doesn't bother me, because I really don't care about her, I do care about you, Harry."
“You don’t need to call me master, Patsy,” He points me, grabbing the cup of coffee I prepared for him. “Nothing new about the order?” he asks me.
DECEMBER 3rd, 2002
"So this is where they make the best burgers in the world?" I ask him, while I see some tables full, almost everyone is eating hamburgers.
The first baby blue ray is thrown and one after the other the people in the room begin to fall until only Ron and I are left standing. And yet Regulus, Albus, and Zephora seem to ponder what to do with us.
GreeneySilvery.
"That's right, we take care of catching the bad guys, call themselves followers of the Dark Lord," says the redhead and immediately I feel the tension in the air.
"I just need to check that you are real," he says and pulls away from me, then stands up, "Don't be a dream, please," and his lips rest on mine. And this is more intense than last night, much more intense than last night. More fiery. Innermost.
Luna.
"Well, it might not be such a bad color after all," Dray says, as he finishes descending the stairs.
"Thanks, Molly," I say leaning forward and wrapping my arms around her. Even when I don't have my original mother here, I'm immensely grateful for the simple fact that I ran into Molly Weasley of all people one autumn afternoon when I wasn't sure how I would get to this weird school: Hogwarts.
"And you hexed him because ...?" I ask in a serious tone.
So, I take the knife and sink it to my wrist.
the letters are a soft baby blue now.
"Is he ..." and I swallow deeply. I can't even dare to think about what it is. "Where is now?"
I can see men in the dinning table trying to smother their own laughs. Deranged people, really. Suddenly, every sound ceases and I look at the entry where a hooded covered face is walking towards to the head of the table.
He is the kid that has been gifted with life. But his mate… His mate is his equal, his opposite. His mate is the one that has been gifted with death.
Smart-Healer is ready to yell at him, probably.
"Try again," I told him, closing my eyes and thinking about my next destination.
And it is too much, my heart aches for all that this woman had to live. And for all that Dray has had to live without her by his side. I take a deep breath and square my shoulders.
"You're really pretty. Aren´t you the most pretty? Yes, you are," says the blond, caressing the animal. I move closer to Dray and hold him close to my body, taking him a few steps away from the glass house of the snakes, who reel in their bodies and return to tranquility.
“His heart is always beating strange when you are around?” she says, wrapping her body around my limb.
I feel my body growing hot all of a sudden. It's making me delirious, as I can feel snity slipping my grip.
Hugs,
“Are you ok, Mister Weasley?” I ask him, letting all my weight fall in the old oak tree.
“And I wouldn’t have you any other way,” he says softly. “Go save the muggles, your daughter and I will be here when you come back.”
“I…” He stops abruptly, looking toward the door. “May have do the apparition thing,” he mumbles. “Madame Pomfrey had to put my hand back on my arm.” He giggles. “It was embarrassing, really. I land outside and then, my hand landed and I was bleeding a bit and then, Professor Snape took me to his quarters to talk.” His joy is falling to pieces. “There’s something I need to tell you.”
"I'll be back in a moment," Magdy says, and stops next to me. "You'll have soda today, honey."
“Because Draco is wherever she is.”
"I loved meeting you, Dray," she tells him and then leaves a kiss on the cheek of the blonde, who turns as red as Gryffindor scarves.
Ewwwk. Gross.
"Molly," I start walking into the kitchen, looking for the only woman who can make the boys behave like normal people. "We need help," I say, stopping at the door.
"There is not human left in that place, Hermione. They are all something more, something else," Blaise rubs his cheeks with both hands. "If you think Dumbledore has power, it's because you've never been to a place like Rosse Cottage. Not humans, but neither common wizards. Not humans but neither common witches. If you have a werewolf kid you might want to send him there first, so The Ancients can teach him how to control his power. If you want to disappear to the ministry, you go to Rosse Cottage. They can make you invisible to any kind of magic the Ministry has applied on you."
his words are swirling with an angry red color and I swallow.
Press.
"It's not like that, love," I tell him, holding out my hand, and trying to calm my own emotions. These, the ones I feel right now: confusion, disappointment, betrayal and great sadness, are not mine. They are from Dray, and while his reaction hurts me too, I can't blame him. That was my same reaction in fifth year, and by then,  I already knew what they were asking of me. "I would never ask that of you," I tell him, but I don't try to take another step toward him. Not because the pain is winning, but because he would never intentionally hurt me. “I would never ask you to become a murderer, much less for me. I also don't want you to assist me if you don't want to, Dray, ”I tell him and his eyes meet mine and I let his magic envelop and search me. And right now, I can see how vulnerable Dray is, even if it doesn't seem like it, because there is always a smile on his lips and his thoughts are pure. But, right here and now… Right now I know that Dray loves me and that I have the power that many don't. I can destroy him without even trying hard enough. “You can assist me by being safe. It is all I ask. Do you remember the first time in my apartment? You just have to be home, for me to come back to you when it is over." His magic is almost cooling my own fire, and I let it be. "All I am asking of you is to be safe and be home for me take care of when the day is over. Nothing else, I promise."
"Uh..." Harry hesitates, as I see the other two people looking at the menu. "Something spicy."
And my heart breaks a little more.
"Maybe the headmistress will contact you," he says seriously, his cheeks turning pink.
"Great" and the smile he gives me leaves me completely blind. "I will give you two tickets the following week. Bring someone with you, okay?”
“Because Dray Black is a mean to an end, Miss Granger,” Moody says. “The brat can resurrect himself, that much we know now. Did you know he welds the power of the death. He can resurrect someone else. I am sure of it. That was why Voldemort wants him in first place.”
“Whatever it was… It mangled Blaise to near death,” she says, swallowing her own sobs. “He was mangled Harry. I am not even sure how he is alive anymore.”
I look up at him, trying to drink his picture.
I blush hard and a crush Bill between my arms.
Like a sunset.
And when I see Dray for the first time since the last day I saw him in Hogwarts, I can say Dray’s have been trapped in a bad position here.
“Harry?” Mione’s voice is tinted with concern.
"Wingwardium Leviosa," he says firmly. But, a gust of wind comes out of my wand and I see how the mirror in my bedroom fall and crash. "I'm sorry Harry," he says to me and I can see the tears begin to fall from his eyes.
"You're absolutely right, Arthur," I tell him, still laughing. "However, I don't know what all the fuss is about."
“But who says we are not your real parents?” my mother ask me in that lovely way she does when she is talking to the High Ladies of London, a stupid group of old witches that gather together to gossip.
So, Dray can give me attitude.
However, I see him move towards the dining room with two plates of toast and jelly in hand, while three others float behind him. For a moment, I am enraptured looking at my husband's body and ...
, 2003
“A triple cheeseburger, a double cheeseburger, a chicken burger and a Burguenator,” Magdy says as two people come up behind her with two trays of food. "Enjoy it."
It takes me a few seconds to figure out the truth.
"I'm not a pure person, Harry," he tells me too confidently. "I'm sure Dumbledore already told you."
“What Mione? What?” he has his wand ready to attack, maim or kill.
“I know, my love. I do, trust me,” I say to him, trying to blink my tears away and swallow the painful lump in my throat. “I know and I am sorry for you know now how painful life can be. I swear to you, that never was my intention when I seeked you out. All I wanted was to bask in your easy, glowing happiness. And I am sorry, because I ruined that for you, Draco.”
“Youngest seeker in the last decade,” Dray reads quietly, like we're in a library. "So you're like Hermione," he says looking at me with a mocking smile on his face. “Mr. Quidditch genius. And you dare to call her a know-it-all, when you're cut with the same scissors."
"I'm sorry, love, but it's something that's inside us," Harry tells him, looking him straight in the eye.
And I know he is scare, just as much as I am to make thing go faster. Because faster can make Draco retreat back to his shell and I don’t want that. But, I want him.
Well, shit…
“Nop,” I just shrug. I don’t care. The priority is Malfoy.
“Harry,” Hermione’s voice and her cold hand on my cheeks pulls me out of my own trance. “Hagrid said she is going to be okay, alright? Just…” But then, she is hesitating. Knowing Hermione, she knows things are gonna get fucked before they get better. She just knows it and don’t know how to tell me. “This is going to sounds really harsh, but… We need Auror Potter right now.”
My magic has been weird lately. I can’t contact Harry through our bond. Isn’t he reaching for me anymore? Does he hate me now?
"Harry," Hannah's voice calls me again once I'm in the hall. "It will be a long surgery." I nod as Hannah leads me to where I know the cafeteria is. “Your children will be sleeping for at least two more hours. But, when they wake up you can take them home. ”
I try to contain my laughter and I can't.
"You like it, bear?" I ask Teddy and his eyes, the shade as mine, look at me. I tickle his tummy and watch him stir, as he smiles at me and the drool falls from his lips.
This is the night. Today the seal that keeps the power of Dray and his original name hidden will be broken and although I am nervous, Zephora was very clear when she said that the complete breaking of the seal depends solely on me.
"Go find me when it's time to eat," the boy says to Harry, settling the huge suitcase on his shoulders. "I need to teach a class."
Yes, they are waiting outside, somewhere.
And that’s a true.
"Yes, you too. Draco will be most displeased if he sees you in a dress without sparks for dinner," I say to her.
Draco shakes his head and leans against me.
“I think is not hard to guess which side is Draco’s,” I say to her, while she keeps passing the garments. Long sleeves shirts and slacks, well pressed and of high quality.
“In a sense, yes,” she says. “If he lives, peace falls upon the society. If dies, wrath and despair came upon us.”
"Whoever took it, Harry," Hermione tells me in a serious voice. "Wanted one thing, to help you or to help Voldemort." Hermione is talking so fast that it's hard for me to follow her. It is as if she thinks faster than her mouth can move. “That leaves very few people. Dumbledore and the Order want you to win this war, so there is peace in Wizarding Britain." She says pacing the room. “Voldemort wants to win this war, to do what Regulus Black said. To get even with all those who hurt him. In other words, the number of people who could have stolen the Prophecy is small."
I see the boy turn white hair turn paler than he is. And Harry follows in his footsteps to the fate of paleness.
“He was Dumbledore’s,” I point out.
Draco conjures up a birthday letter, designed by my husband specifically for Teddy's fourteenth birthday, and he signs with a pen, then passes it to Scorpius, who writes Scrop instead of Scorp, and immediately tries to stifle a giggle. Then James writes something that appears to be James, in letters difficult to discern, but that is there.
I nod one last time, as I watch her walk away and Dray's giggle brings me back to reality.
Sadly, he was much less then what I expected.
“He can be sick,” I say, because usually I am not involved in this kind of cases. That is Hit Wizards shit.
January 7
“Because the part of Mr. Malfoy’s brain that connected with his vocal cords was severly damaged when he fell from the window,” she says. “You know another healer was here and he helped us to stabilize Mr. Malfoy. I am really sorry.”
He thumbs his wand and I feel wards going up. This is not Dumbledore’s level wards. This is just a common, ministry standard wards. He gathers his things in the air with magical aid and then, he is transferring all his vials and phials to a card box. I can see little smidges dancing around the material and I smile.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thank you, My Lord,” he says, inching forward and then, letting himself dangle from the ropes that keeps him prisoner.
My charm is wearing off. I reacj out, trying to take a feel of Dray's magic and I can feel it, little, curious, blinding, growing, searching... Searching.
“Can you awake him, please, Harry?” she asks, taking a sit in the chair nearby the door.
"Another song, Drake," a girl's voice reached his ears like a kind of shouted prayer. "Another one, yes?"
"Papa's favorite dessert is Daddy!" Scorpius says proudly, as if he remembered a very difficult answer.
"James wants to be Unspeakable and Scorpius wants to be Healer, like Draco." I tell him in a whisper. "I think maybe, I should intervene."
“Patsy,” the young master says softly. “There’s something I need you to find for me, please,” he says softly, sitting himself in front of me. “I need for you to find the blossom of a white valerian for me.”
“Come now, Draco,” my Father’s says authoritatively as always.
"I'm listening to hypotheses," says Neekeal in a serious tone, as the board clears.
"The kids?" I ask him, releasing his hands and turning to see my husband in the eye.
"To Sky Gardens," I answer his question softly.
"Auror Potter," a nurse tells me. "Your husband is out of surgery. You can enter if you like. You can bring someone else with you, if you wish,” she says softly.
I am death on my feet.
"Before that, let me help you," I tell him, watching the way witches and wizards look at him alike. I extend my hand to ask for his cello, but Dray gently shakes it, causing the hair that falls on his forehead to move with him.
Last night we visited Sky Gardens with its fairy-tale-like-lights and the smell of eart lingering in the air. I think the only thing Dray loves about that place is the endless trees and flowers that the place owns. A small forest suspended over London. And that same place, where I saw Dray caress the flower petals was the same place where I found the strength to tell Hermione and Ron what is happening.
GreeneySilvery
“I am sure he knows about Tom Riddle,” I say to them slowly. “I touched one of the strands that bounds us together, as soulmates. And I saw different things, they were crests. I saw the crest of the House of Black.”
“Was Narcissa Black ruthless?” I ask him, lifting my eyes from where my blond boyfriend is actually stealing the quaffle out of Angelina’s arm and going straight for Ron.
"Are you okay, Harry?" I hear the crack of the apparition and Ron's words are heard as mere whispers.
I close my eyes, trying to tune out Ron and Mione’s way to help. Mione using her brain and Ron explaining her why it would not be a good idea, because of the magical factor.
"Narcissa Black was killed on July 24th, 1980," says Nadja Neekeal, head of the Unspeakable. “The problem is that no trace of her son was found with her. We have no idea where the boy is, who must now be a man like all of you,” Neekeal sighs and rubs her eyes with one hand. "The problem is that the Black family has one of the purest lineage and its magic is strong. We think Voldemort wants that power."
The three of them nod, and the hugging and kissing chaos begins, all three trying to embrace life outside of Draco. Once the three of them have dispersed, I lean in and place a kiss on Draco's lips.
"What did you practice today?" I ask him, waving my wand over the chocolate liquid and heating it up instantly.
"I don't know how you can go from one thought to the next in a matter of seconds," Harry tells me. "Your mind is very beautiful, Draco." And his thumb caresses my cheek, while Nesha touches my hand with the tip of her tongue. I hear Harry hiss something and Nesha. "Your mind is always wandering."
In my own pain remembering my wife's broken and bleeding body, telling me that we would have a life later.
Molly pulls him away from the twins to hold him in her arms. Somehow the action doesn't catch the boy by surprise, who immediately closes his arms around the woman's back. He closes his eyes and a smile reappears on his lips.
Scorpius smiles at Miss Maddeline and she blushes deeply.
“What do you remember from that day, Draco?” tightening my hold in him, without making him suffocated.
Draco shrugs off me as I think about everything that needs to be done today. However, this family has been around for many years and there is always a mutual agreement. I make my way to the kitchen smiling as I remember that I have a husband and three children whom I adore with life.
Narcissa Black weren't supported by her family at that moment. Not if she was to be a single mother in a purist-perfect world.
No one will ever harm this beautiful blonde while I am alive.
Hannah just gently shakes her head.
Hello, my beloved readers. I hope you are all good.
"They are not myths, Hermione Granger," Zephora replies. "Here in the UK the magical society is a small group of magicians and giants and certain magical creatures who do not really possess an intellect. Other creatures are not welcome in this country and have therefore been eradicated elsewhere. Places where other ministries accept them and let them have a job, and they don't regulate them as if they were abominations of nature or as if they were beneath their feet.” Zephora's voice is as cold as an ice floe. “The Veela clan that resides here don't even contact British magicians, house elves are one of the few magical creatures British Wizards allow on their premises. It is not to be expected that the knowledge of British Wizarding World to be almost nil in that regard.”
Harry is a bad ass. Draco loves sharing good food.
"Are you listening, Lucius?" I fix my gaze on his and see my pain reflected in his eyes. “Everything we did, we did for him. Our acts of torture, our betrayal to Narcissa, our disdain and our feigned arrogance, it was all so that he could live Lucius,” he tells me and I can feel the effort he is making to keep his voice intact. "We haven't failed him, or Cissy," he tells me through a clenched jaw. “He lives and it may be that Narcissa is dead, and that you and I have been nothing but earth-walking dead, Lucius. But, he lives. He lives and he already knows Potter and no one could stop that event,” tears fall from Severus's eyes. “You, Dumbledore and I, we have been nothing but the dead who walk the earth, but there is little left. Because he is next to the person he should be with, and you and I can rest, Lucius. We just have to hold out a little longer, and then when they win, you and I can rest and cry and apologize to our dead wives, and our orphaned children. But, first we have to resist if we want to leave them a world and a future in which they can live peacefully and happily. First, we have to be strong, so that they can do what we couldn't."
"That's right," he murmurs, straightening his huge black robe. “What Regulus remembers is only part of the truth. What Lucius Malfoy knows is the other,” his voice is soft, but firm.
"It could have been worse," he replies, showing me teeth as white as pearls. "How about yours?" his question takes me by surprise.
I grow nervous just watching the blond kid's expression. It is so blank, one would think he is not even here, but plotting Ginny or Harry's death. His expresions says Dray doesn't have a single regret in life. Except, I'm pretty sure that theory isn't entirely true. The boy extends his right hand towards Ginny.
But Draco just shake his head.
Enjoy this chapter with burgers and a chocolate shake ... whichever is your favorite!
OCTOBER 29th, 2002
“Before the rising of Voldemort,” he says hotly. “We are not murderers, like all the others that stayed there.” He speaks.
"I know you because I have seen you in my dreams." he whispers softly, his eyes clears as a winter day.
"Dad," James' whisper makes me turn my head.
"It's a short ten-step walk, Draco," she tells him aloud. "If you give five or three, or whatever, if you don't finish today," she tells her seriously. "I swear, I will be proud."
Rage is all I feel inside me, but it just lasts for a few seconds. I feel the hot tears streaming down my face and I try to dry them away. I am a Malfoy, I shouldn’t be crying.
Well, I am back. I'm tired. I haven't sleep good but I couldn't take this out my head and here is a +2000 words chapter. I hope you all can enjoy it!
Until she isn’t talking anymore.
I pat Wardwood on the back.
"What do you need, Dray?" I ask him, caressing his hole with my thumb, pressing but not breaching. He is still to gone and I need his answer. I breach push my thumb past the thight ring of muscles. The noises that are falling from his mouth a ode to the pleasure. "Tell me. What do you want?" But his only answers are moans and groans of pleasure and a string of pleases. He is so beautiful like this, moaning and begging for more. "Tell me," I spank his ass with my hand, making it tint with pink, then I knead his globes tenderly. "Tell me what you want, baby."
I look Mione in the eye and see them shine with fun.
Instead of open my eyes, I roll to my side where something is biting hard on my wrist. This is so uncomfortable. I wrap my free and not itching around whatever magical creature is trying to steal my blood. I swat it, but instead of making it go away, I just manage to make the pain worst.
The orb closed itself with a soft hand move from Redfern.
No one will come between me and the blond-haired angel. And least of all, not until I know what her true intentions are towards Dray.
And if all he has done is not try… What would all this be like if Harry tried?
DRACO
HARRY
"What does that mean?" I ask him, searching inside his soul for my answer.
I push that thought out of my head and look at the packages full of small insects still stuffed and take two bags, knowing that maybe I won't be able to return for some time. Dray is not strong enough yet, the next blood moon is ten days away and according to Zephora, Dray is as helpless as a baby until then.
I smile at Draco, remembering good times, when Draco started to say: Silly-thingy-thing. He was afraid to mention Voldemort back there, his mark would burn until screams were rip from his very soul. Draco started calling him: Silly-Thingy-Thing.
We are not so far from his favorite spot at the park. I feel like a stalker.
His head nods gently against my neck and I delight in knowing that Dray trusts me enough to accept me as a wizard and even let me take him to a place that is totally unknown to him. Using magic.
“Someone is learning fast,” Bella says, with a murderous glare in Dray’s way.
"You ok, Tedster?" I ask him and he gift me with a dopey smile and a somewhat odd nod.
But, well… I crave destruction.
“She is good,” I say to no one in particular.
She just smiles at me softly.
“It’s not going to work,” Pansy says and I feel sad listening to her words. “Maybe, it is a different process for him.”
His head comes to rest on my shoulder and for a moment I think everything is fine.
"Sorry Ron, but it's Friday," when the clock strikes five, I immediately open the door and walk out of it.
"If any kid ever tells you something as horrible as that, Teddy, I want you to tell me," Draco says seriously. "Tell them your father will hear about it."
The doctor recommended no sex, but fuck his advice. Dray needs confirmation that I still want him as much as the day we got married. Dray needs to feel wanted and loved in a physical way. It had been hard for us, because, even have a pair of twins and Teddy with us, being father from more then a decade now, we are used to make love a handful of days a week, and keep my hands out of my husband's body has been hard.
“Just like I learned about the Deathly Hallows in a fairy tale,” I say to him. “How do you know the basilisk blood can’t destroy them?”
I throw myself in the chair that I use every day, and the same I brought from my own house. I turn on it and look at the board that is full of names everywhere.
“Unlike you, dear Auntie Bella” he says looking her straight in the eyes. “I am not a retarded wizard.”
“He is not even seeing the room anymore,” Hermione says in a soft whisper. “He is…”
“I asked you a question, Mr. Potter,” Healer Mason says a bit pissed about my lack of attention. “So, what is your answer?” she asks me again and I just stare at her blankly.
the letters fade.
I take my husband in my arms and maneuver him, until I have him bridal style in my arms. I sit him in one of the chairs, and I start on one of those massages I learned when Draco was in his first week of rehab.
I fidget from one foot to the other.
Maybe. However, I cannot assure anything. Harry's magic seems calmer, but I am pretty sure, it is ready to protect.
"Yours, for ever," he says, before I cum inside him.
“I am all alone now,” his voice is a faint whisper, his voice rough, nails digging in my flesh in a poor attempt to over come his own grieve.
“Let’s help the twins, so we can play a game,” Ginny says, getting up with Blaise’s help. “Hermione can be referee. She knows the book since we were kids."
Dray is a creature of emotions and sensations. And that's all I have to build his magic. When my hand releases his nipple, I see him place them on his thighs, assuming a submissive position.
And… I am over a huge table. Suddenly, plates and cutlery are appearing at the table. Oh, this looks more and more like Hansel and Gretel. Maybe my dad was being sincere when he told me real wolves existed.
Hello, I am posting today because finals xD and yeah, I did good in them.
"Doesn't your face ever hurt from smiling so much?" I ask him, leaving a kiss on his temple.
“Hello, Miss Lovegood,” good manners being beaten down to me by Petunia Evans, the bitch. “May I come in?”
"How was your day?" I ask her, as I walk beside her.
"Harry was able to open a gold-colored object," says Hermione. "Maybe only Harry can open the missing ones."
Thank you.
“Wakey wakey, Drakey-boo,” the voice is singing against my ear. She is too close, I can smell her rotten breath.
"I love you too, Dray." And I smile feeling the firt clean dish of the night being pushed in my hand.
"Dray," I move him carefully, as I cast another warming charm on us.
Both, my best friend and my non-blood brother smiles up at me.
"I'll be back now," I tell Dray, as I watch him stop in front of a terrarium full of rats.
And I lift my face to see a man place a chair in the middle of the stage and Dray sitting on it. The camera focuses on the gray-eye man, his eyes are illuminated by the large lamps and I can see how his body slowly begins to relax. The gestures on his face reflect a melancholy that I never thought possible in someone so full of life.
“Ok, I will have to tread carefully here,” he says, casting again. “This are his walls,” he says, pointing something with his wand. “This is a variation of Legilimens, but less invasive and more amicable with the science purpose of helping the patient.” I can see his walls, they are that… Transparent walls. Until there is a hole in them, a tiny little hole, that is clearing the fog in the walls. A few memories passing fast in front of our eyes, the sounds indistinctive. Until that lot of layers… Is a circuit. It is like a circuit.
I reach my bond with Dray, making my magic collide against his consciousness repeatedly, until he is somewhat conscious. I ask with desperation for his location, and between uncoherent thoughts, he shows me memories. I feel like hyperventilating now, because none of this makes sense. This is not Dray’s muggle apartment in the middle of London. This is foreign.
And that was how I fell in love with fucking Malfoy Watching him faithfully every night. While I was training to be an Auror, Draco Malfoy was finishing his career as a Muggle Doctor and finishing his apprenticeship as a Potion Master. The last class to become an auror was Potions. And Draco Malfoy was there, assisting Melanie Manstritch, and more time than not, she let him teach and help us to understand.
“You have to calm him down, Mr. Potter,” Healer Mason tell me, standing up and walking to us. “This is not good for his brain.”
Shit is happening.
I look him back in the eyes and a faint smile appears on his lips. And the only thing I can think of is this was not the answer I expected. Dray is so theatrical, so playful and so full of life... This tame answere is not what I was especting.
I wave my wand ready to launch a Patronus and alert Ron and Mione about my family's disappearance when a pair of delicate hands press against my chest, followed by a soft kiss on the line of my jaw.
I can see moist gathering in the old elf's eyes, again. God, this is a hard job.
Hugs,
The last Horcrux is me.
Narcissa appears in front of me and I see her holding a little Dray with pointy ears.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know it smells awful," Narcissa tells him.
"Dray, the store won't go away," I tell him, trying to slow him down.
Some people will flirt with you Harry, for some reason Hermione's voice echoes in my head and I pay attention to her. Don't be rude to them. It's okay?
"Are you asking me or are you telling me?" Dray asks Harry. And yet the boy extends his hand. "I am Dray."
“Are you ok, mate?” Ron ask me.
Zephora shakes her head.
“I want to see, Luna,” he says, but he is not looking at us.
“Someone took Narcissa’s memory with them,” he says softly. “We are hoping they actually has zero understanding of how it works, really.”
"Hufflepuff," and while it may sound like a statement to others' ears, I know Dray needs confirmation.
HARRY
Even if it was to pass information to The Order. Harry keep insisting I should tell everyone about my involvement…
"Oh," the magical head says to me and I immediately see the enchanted object start to wink at me. "I never thought you were the type of young man who likes to be with boys for one night," she says playfully. "You're already maturing, Harry. Surely you want to have a lot of action,” he tells me in a whisper. "And not just from the aurors." and wiggle her eyebrows.
“Professor Snape is amazing,” I say to them.
"Could you put it at the end of the bridge, please?" he asks with a face full of determination.
“So, you are a traitor,” the last of them, standing in door says.
Harry looks at her, his green eyes spin with something I wouldn't know what to call, but the other emotion... I'm sure it's happiness. I am happy that my best friend has something similar to a family, even if I know that, despite the years, Harry is still not used to having one. He still believes that we are a loan, a family that he will have to give back someday and I am so proud that my mother put him in his place, that she reminds him that he is also part of this family, even if he is no longer in a relationship with Ginny.
"What's it Reggie?" I look at Sirius, who only looks at his brother with the same face he used to look at me when I was 14 and some spell went wrong and ended up breaking something or the other.
“Damn, mate,” Ron says, and then a Jack Russell Terrier patronus is appearing in front of us. “Be ready.” Is the only thing Ron says to the animal, before sending it out. “How more before it shatters?” he asks me.
Draco blushes and I count it as a victory in my favor.
"No, he didn't," we say at the same time.
I've seen you in my dreams, Dray's voice echoes in my head.
Show time.
"I woke up like this, this morning," he says in a serious tone, as he walks towards them. "But, that's not going to prevent an exam today," and he gives the pages to the first student. "Pass the pages to your classmates, please."

I nod softly to Dray.
However, I have to look towards Hermione so I can calm myself down. Imagining her and Ron having sex work its magic. And that makes me feel slightly ill. That is something I never want to imagine again in my life.
"I love you, Harry," and it's a short whisper. "Much. Although sometimes I forget."
A laugh scape Harry’s lips.
"You are so hateful, that when you die, not even your mother will cry," and thank God, at that moment the elevator opens.
"And Fridays are busy because?" Ron asks me, looking me in the eye.
Well, she's a know-it-all. I'm sure Harry can spit out that knowledge when it comes to Quidditch as well. Yet what knowledge can Ron spit out?
Dray nods, his eyes on mine. Facing each other.
And Dray hits me again, this time on the head.
I lift my face from the cup in front of me as new people enter the room. However, I don't let Hermione go, I cling to her little hands, trying to keep my pain at bay.
He nods.
Hugs,
“Stop fussing over me, mother,” he says groggily. “I am fine, it’s just a headache.”
Molly's Patronus appears in the room.
The door opens and Hermione’s head peak from it. She looks at Draco and then, her eyes sets on me. Her face is set blankly and her hands are gripping the door so hard, her knuckles are turning white.
"About ten minutes ago, a full water truck drove past a taxi, which has five people on board," Hannah tells me, while she shows me a picture of the yellow car.
“Bill,” I look at the older son of Molly and Arthur. “You will do great.”
Slowly his muscles relax and I can feel some things start to fall to the ground.
“This are the correct place,” he says, raising his wand slightly and making a map of the property appears. “This wood is big, as every other Greenland in this country.”
"So, the twins will go with me and you and Teddy will join us in the afternoon," I glance at Draco, making sure that everything I know is correct.
Magic… Vengeance, dark thoughts start to swirls inside my head. Mate. I need my mate. But more then my mate, I need to spill blood.
I am back, yes... Not updating this fast and I am not going to give an excuse, because there's none.
A pale hand moves in front of my eyes and I come back to reality, laying my eyes on the beautiful boy trying to get my attention.
Until I slowly watch him lose consciousness, his voice fading, his breaths stopping. I put my fingers on his jugular. His pulse is so slow and his skin is so pale that I am afraid he will die. Until he stops breathing and his heart stops completely.
"Earthquake," says James, putting Scorpius under the kitchen table.
I try to move my body and I can feel my ribs protesting. The sole movement is making me breathless. I open my eyes again, not sure about anything anymore.
"Thank you, love," I say, approaching him and placing a kiss on his forehead.
“He is glad,” she says, taking the blossoms of white valerian carefully. “The book you recommended him is doing wonders for him to understand mamma. I think, they are a bit more in love now,” she hands me the little packet. The white valerian blossoms look like really tiny rose tears. “These are really fresh,” then she is smiling again. “Wanna come to the garden to pick the dandelions?”
