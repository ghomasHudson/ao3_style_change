“I think I’d like to speak to your manager,” Draco says, and though he intends his tone to be light, Potter’s expression darkens.
The goat lets out a short, raspy cry and then plucks up a mouthful of weeds from the ground, continuing to stare at Draco as she chews steadily.
“So I did, Serafina, I’d forgotten,” Horace says, and he retrieves the well-worn old book with a smile.
Her words go straight to Harry’s chest, twisting his heart and making his next words catch in his throat.
Hermione is quietly graceful, moving in a slow glide that allows her to hold Rose’s hand and also steady Ron, who seems to be having some trouble coordinating his long legs. After a couple of near misses, Mrs Purley offers to take Hugo, freeing Ron to slip-slide his way around the ice while she serves drinks with an unconcerned toddler strapped to her chest and a curious swan at her feet.
“Well, I’ll be honest,” he says, fixing her with a conspiratorial glance. “The eclipse is very interesting… but it’s all been done before, hasn’t it? This… now this is something new!” He indicates the children, who are now being asked by Mary Ann to choose between a bucket and a set of noisy utensils. “I thought that maybe we could drum up some extra interest, you know, just for anyone who couldn’t be here today. They can send money up to your place afterwards, couldn’t they, so…?”
As he takes back control of his derailed meeting, Harry continues to write, keeping half an eye on the twenty pound note as it travels around the room. He wonders if he’ll get it back.
He turns away quickly to stride across the shop and Draco has the strangest feeling that he’s trying not to laugh. He wishes he knew what everyone found so funny about his ducks.
“Don’t you dare say ‘complicated’,” Harry warns, and beneath the fury surging in his chest, something like electricity crackles in the air between them. The combination is so confusing that the next words are out before he can stop them. “Don’t. Your life isn’t complicated. You have no life.”
Harry flips through his notebook with inky fingers. “Yeah, I think so. Everyone’s had some good ideas and I think the best we can do for now is to be watchful. We can pass information around, alert each other if there are any new incidents and write down descriptions of anyone we see acting suspiciously. The patrol officer is arriving on Friday and should be able to help us coordinate our efforts. If we can just pull together,” he says, looking around the shop with what he hopes is an optimistic expression, “I think everything will be fine.”
“He looks very nice on our shop counter,” Harry says. “And he’s better behaved than some of our customers.”
In the big old drawing room, the setting sun is gleaming on the panes of the French windows and illuminating the dancing particles of dust in the air. Luna smiles, content to lean against the doorframe and listen to what sounds like a hundred conversations going on at once, the clack and hiss from a game of Gobstones in the corner, and the wireless, around which several children are leaping up and down in time to the music.
Harry looks at the money box thoughtfully. Of course, what he had really wanted to buy Rose was a ruler with spiders on it, but he has been reliably informed that she will be getting one in her Christmas stocking, shatter-proof and foldable, courtesy of Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes. The money box gleams in the lamplight, gold highlights glittering with brand new perfection.
When Harry steps into Diagon Alley on Monday morning, it is immediately clear that someone has beaten him to the idea of setting up a collection for Mrs Purley. Mr Jennings from the quill shop is already darting from shop to shop with a wooden box, and when he sees Harry, he hurries over, breath forming clouds in the cold air.
When he opens his eyes for a split second, the sparks and the stars seem to swirl above him in dizzying patterns, and the pure heat, from the bonfire, from Draco, from waiting and wanting and knowing, is all over him, rushing through his veins and turning their kisses messy and desperate.
When the little telephone is held out to her, Luna looks at the screen. Sure enough, there is a picture of a plate of toast with marmalade. One of the pieces has had a bite taken out of it.
“Oh, look,” Draco says with enviable nonchalance. “Here comes Officer Kettleworth of the MLE. Perhaps you’d like to… ah, he’s gone.”
“Draco, don’t be a prat when I’m trying to apologise to you,” Harry sighs. “I’m probably interfering where I’m not wanted here, but I want to help. Today I sorted out a bit of a solution with someone I trust, and if you want it, it’s there.”
“Yeah,” he sighs. “I know I don’t make sense, but I’d really like to be your friend again. If you’ll have me.”
Harry studies the offering for a moment and then grins at his friend. “You’re getting married? Congratulations!”
Luna can’t hear Ginny’s response over the sudden hammering of the bodhran, but she wrinkles her nose in sympathy.
For a moment, Draco stares at him as though he’s quite mad and then capitulates with a shrug. He nudges Harry and indicates the old woman behind the bar.
Left alone in the dark street, Harry stands perfectly still as his mind races ahead of him. He looks between the two shopfronts, noting the bare trees with a grimace. The door of Borteg’s swings open and out steps an unmistakeable figure.
He turns to her, unsure whether to be irritated or amused. She smiles appealingly and opens her mouth to speak just as there is a firm knock at the front door.
With a shaky smile, Harry pulls his jumper over his head, sitting back on Draco’s thighs and displaying the reminders of the past that scatter his chest and abdomen.
“Okay,” he says, and when he looks at Draco, he knows he can do this. In fact, he feels like he can do just about anything. “Let’s start with any business that serves food. We need to clean those up first so that they can start remaking anything they’ve lost. Anyone who’s good with organic cleaning spells needs to go with Felicity to see what they can rescue. Does anyone else have a special skill that might be useful?”
Harry agrees that it most definitely is, and he thanks the man, dropping several coins into the charity bucket as he passes. As he is examining a bag of exploding cinder toffee at the sweet stall, Mrs Purley comes to stand beside him with a big tin jug. Harry puts several more coins into it without a word.
“That’s a terrible excuse, Draco,” Luna says. “Everyone can dance, and you can’t say you don’t like it if you haven’t even tried.”
“You must be joking. He has bookings weeks in advance,” Harry says, setting down Rose so that she can run ahead and choose her skates.
“The point is,” Eilish says, “don’t give up on him. He might have a funny way of showing it, but he’s pleased you’re here.”
Wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist, Harry closes his eyes tightly and focuses on his destination.
“Are you coming to my Christmas play, Uncle Harry?” she asks. “It’s about all the different animals at Christmas time and I’m going to be a giraffe so I have a
to look both ways before crossing the road. Fortunately, Hugo is just starting to walk, and while he’s currently with Grandma Molly and no doubt being spoiled rotten, it’s only a matter of time before he’s going to school with his sister, and then he, too, will become Harry’s Monday to Thursday afternoon companion, and he’s looking forward to it.
“You’re the man from the coffee shop,” Mary Ann says suddenly, and Luna pulls away from Harry, following her eyes.
Draco seems disinclined to say any more, and Harry is no longer in the mood to push him. Instead, he looks around at the glittering trees, the Sunday morning dog walkers and the colourful lights strung between each old fashioned lamp post. The sky is clear and the pale sun shimmering over everything seems to make the air taste pure and sweet. The wind slices through Harry’s hair and clothes and brings with it a warm, festive smell that is instantly recognisable.
Rose watches the flickering spell for a moment and then looks up at Draco. “I don’t know properly, but the ones with the big bobbles on the antennas at the front are usually boys. His bobbles are pretty big.”
“Okay. But I thought we were seeing the alligators next year?” he asks, reluctant to let go of that particular promise.
The moon is sparkling on the water, making each little rivulet gleam brightly as though to invite her in. She is just about to step down into the stream when she hears voices.
“Yeah, he is a bit,” Harry says, but his eyes drift to the curtain and he wonders. “Does he always shut himself off like that?”
Ten minutes later, he is walking at Draco’s side through a vast park he has never seen before. Several yards in front of them, the ladies amble along the frosted path, chattering and laughing and acting for all the world as though Harry and Draco are invisible to them. All four are dressed up for the occasion, most notably Corrie, who has swapped her usual jeans and jumper for what Harry assumes is a traditional West Indian dress in vibrant yellow and green, with bold geometric patterns and a matching head scarf. She is also wearing a battered old denim jacket, but only, she has insisted, ‘to keep the cold out’.
Around them, everyone is still watching the display, and Draco feels slightly disoriented, as though he hadn’t expected to open his eyes and find himself in daylight, much less in Diagon Alley.
Seizing on the opportunity to dislodge Draco from his head, Harry leaps headlong into the madness and pushes himself hard, finding the impossible for customer after customer and revelling in the resulting relief. Fortified by several hours of dreamless sleep, he is everywhere at once, working seamlessly with Mr Borteg and managing to avoid crashing into a single customer. By eleven o’clock, he is sticky with exertion and overheating under his glittery santa hat, but he doesn’t care. He has sold almost all of the decorations from the charity Christmas tree, and practically every other customer has brought in a wrapped gift to add to the pile.
Harry turns to see Ron, eyes hollow and hair everywhere. He flicks his wand to set the kettle boiling and studies his friend.
, a storm is coming. Given that it was supposed to come on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and now today, Draco has rather given up hoping.
“Alright,” Eilish says, holding up her hands. “Corrie, I will whisper to you what cards you have because I am not playing, I’m just dealing. Okay?”
“I’ve got those ones!” Deb cries, catching sight of Penelope’s pyjamas. “When you get them wet, the little fishes flick their tails!”
“Listen, I just want to know if you’re alright... if you just say ‘Luna, I’m alright’, I promise I’ll go away,” she tries, but there is no response.
When the clock strikes for midnight, he stirs and trundles to the kitchen, half-awake and half something else completely. He gulps down water, staring out at the dull night sky, and then returns to his position with a large, steaming mug of tea.
“ALRIGHT!” yell the children, yell Deb and Mary Ann and Sam and the teachers, yell Horace and Harry and Draco and a man in a suit made of green fur.
“I’ll know.” Draco reaches into his pocket and extracts a slightly battered Galleon. “It’s linked into the bus’s own magic. If someone needs us, it vibrates. I can’t say I’m expecting anyone—Mr Barleycorn will probably get on later, but he likes to ride overnight.”
“Okay,” he says, wrapping his hands around his second cup of tea. “It all started when George had his stag night.”
Mrs Purley fixes him with a stern expression. “I’m alright, Harry. I’m open, I’m getting people their breakfasts. That’s what I do, and no thieving bastard is about to stop me.”
“Spanish, maybe? French?” Harry guesses, and he is just about to launch into the fish/chicken story when he stops himself.
“Wait ‘til you see him in his pyjamas!” she says mysteriously, taking a moment to enjoy their expressions of wonderful confusion before she takes off in the direction of the office.
The ladies laugh, and Thora cracks a reluctant smile that takes Harry by surprise. Under the table, something brushes his ankle, and he bends to see Montague cowering between his feet, brown eyes fixed on the mouse cage with deep suspicion.
“Really?” Miss Lister clasps her hands together and stares at Shan. “Aren’t you the lady from the chocolate shop?”
“And I’m sure you’d have made him sorry he was ever born, but it’s all okay. Everything’s back to normal and I promise she won’t be able to tell the difference today,” Harry assures. “Unless she talks to one of Draco’s chefs and mentions their knives. Those guys are still pretty mad.”
“My mother named him,” Draco admits. “He took one of her knitting needles and ran off with it the day he first came home with me. It did rather make me realise he needed some training.”
“I don’t know,” Harry admits. He picks at the fluffy fibres of the rug and groans. “I don’t know what I’m doing about anything.”
“Wow, you were brilliant!” Harry says, crouching down and hugging her tightly. “You were the best blue tit I’ve ever seen.”
To his relief, Mr Borteg doesn’t say a word, and when the shop door opens again, a large group of chattering women spills inside, swarming the shelves and immediately striking up a friendly conversation.
Draco releases him and swims away with an efficient backstroke, heading out into the centre of the loch. Harry follows at a more ponderous pace, sticking to breast stroke and stretching out his arms and legs pleasurably with every push forwards. When Draco stops and begins treading water with an alarmed expression, Harry calls out to him.
“You’re very welcome,” Harry says at last, and Florean drops the silencing charm. “You’ll bring her back before all her teeth fall out, will you?”
Eilish shakes out the letter. “Dear Mum,” she reads. “I thought you’d like to know that I caught an earlier Portkey and I’m currently wandering about in your house, drinking your tea and raiding your cupboards. Don’t rush home, I just wanted to let you know so that you didn’t have a fright when you came in and saw me eating biscuits in my pyjamas. Merry Christmas, love from Flora.”
Harry snorts. “Well, no, it doesn’t. But then neither was the conversation I just had with Trelawney, if you could call it that.”
“Don’t worry, everyone, Draco is just having a little moment. I’m going to deal with it, and then I’ll be right back after this song with the Eye in the Sky.”
“I apologise for my swan’s terrible behaviour,” Draco says. “I’d be happy to replace your bracelet at my own cost.”
“I’m glad someone’s going to wear that costume,” Ron says with feeling. “We only finished it an hour ago.”
Harry unlocks the door of the Magical Menagerie and slams inside. Draco gets up and puts on a record before dropping back into his chair. He’s not going to go over there, and not just because he’s in the middle of a show. Whatever Harry is upset about is not his problem. Except that it is, because his stomach is tight with concern and all he can think about is bursting into that shop and demanding to know who now needs to be hexed in the face. And that cannot be good. Apart from anything else, Draco is pretty certain that Harry Potter is capable of fighting his own battles.
“So I have,” Harry says, looking down at his cup and wondering how he has managed to avoid spilling it all over himself in the process. “I was wondering how you were fixed for Christmas Eve.”
As predicted, Molly and Narcissa have much to talk about, and are quickly lost in a conversation that veers from raising children to knitting projects with detours around the best place to buy good quality butter and the state of popular music. Ron eats his starter without taking his eyes off his mother, and Arthur seems equally entranced by his wife’s easy sociability.
“Maybe half of one,” Draco says, letting himself in to the empty restaurant and holding the door open for Harry. “I have no idea how long it will take everyone to make their way up here and I thought a locked door might send the wrong message.”
The distillery is cool and dark, heavy with the scents of wood and copper and humming with protective magic. In one corner, in the shadow of countless large barrels, is Mr Borteg’s little sanctuary. An old leather chair crouches beside an ebony desk, on which glasses and instruments jostle for space with piles of books. Next to his coffee cup, a single crackleball sits, waiting for its moment.
Harry smiles. Today, Audrey’s hair is a vibrant mint green, which clashes wonderfully with the pink and purple theme she has chosen for her window box.
“I’ve got leftover chicken, potatoes… the carrots have all gone, I’m afraid,” she mutters, granting Harry a look that is equal parts apologetic and concerned. “There’s plenty of fresh bread if you need—”
“I realise that you wanted to see the loch and the mountains, hear the landscape sing and such,” Draco says, gripping his fingers tightly, “but they’ll still be there in the morning, and I thought you might enjoy the night time view.”
Draco prods him out of the bus and onto the grass. The snow has dissolved almost completely in London, but here it clings in large, determined patches; the night sky is clear and strewn with stars, and there is the most wonderful, evocative scent on the air that Harry thinks he could identify immediately if it weren’t so out of place.
“Yes,” Draco says, leaning on the arm of his chair. “She thinks Montague is the devil, doesn't she?”
in the children’s lunches. I have a habit of putting alcohol in their food because I find it keeps them quiet,” she says, stomping across the room and hitting Sam over the head with an empty folder.
She watches him working on the cherry for a moment and then turns to her book. Harry and Draco may have moved up the list somewhat, but she isn’t about to forget her ongoing campaigns. Drawing her wand, she performs a script scrambling charm to disguise her handwriting and then dashes off a letter to one Ronald Weasley. She has sent a dozen such letters in recent months, all of them raving about his delicious baked goods and demanding that he open a patisserie or cookie stall or pie shop, depending on her mood or the character she imagines is writing the letter.
“I’m a bit slow, maybe, but I worked it out,” Harry says, needing something to anchor him, too. He grabs the nearest metal pole. Breathes. “Vesseur Spane is Severus Snape, and unless he’s come back to life somehow, you lied to those ladies. You never hired another driver.”
Harry watches the two women work, stepping around each other with practised ease and flicking their wands to send objects flying back and forth without the need for words. Separately, both Shan and Esmee are impressive women, but together, they form something bigger, something that glows with love and dexterity and confidence. Some people, he has to admit, really are stronger in a relationship, and even if he isn’t one of those people, he recognises greatness when he sees it.
By the time darkness closes over the castle grounds, he is wound up too tightly to lie when Neville asks him where he’s going. “I have to... lake,” he manages, and breaks into a jog. He doesn’t know how he knew it would be tonight, but when he reaches the water’s edge, he knows that Draco knows it, too.
It’s painfully clear that he is trying to hide his surprise, and Harry rather irrationally wants to smile.
“It could have been worse,” Draco admits. “Though… I’m not sure I want to know how long you were standing there.”
“I’m not complaining,” Draco says, catching a piece of carrot on his spoon. “Every wedding I’ve ever been to was just a competition to serve the fanciest thing possible. Have you ever eaten camel?”
“First door on the left,” Hermione says. She waits until Marius has disappeared into the house and then turns to Harry expectantly. “Well, what do you think?”
“Hermione gave me this thing for the bath,” he says, knowing there’s no way out. “You drop it in and it fizzes and throws out all this stuff. It honestly didn’t occur to me to look in the mirror before I came out.”
Harry bristles at the idea, but then he looks at Gertie and his irritation dissolves. This strange, caustic little woman has decided to take care of both of them, for no reason other than that she
George regards his brother with great benevolence. “Chocolate fudge, please. And I’ll think about it.”
The next morning steals into her attic bedroom with a shower of bright sunlight and a rustle of cool autumn air that sends all the loose parchments skittering off the bed and onto the floor. Luna scrambles upright, confused for a moment until her scribbles and diagrams come into focus and she smiles. There is work to be done, but first, she has to get some breakfast into her father. She can hear the whirr of the printing press already, and it wouldn’t be the first time that he has forgotten to go to bed in the run-up to publication.
After what seems like a long time, Potter returns to the shop. Some of his fury has diminished, but the look on his face is now one of grim determination, and he is carrying a small, string-handled bag.
“Only Mr Barleycorn. I think you met him once before,” Draco says, directing a small smile at the snowy ground.
and his badly-behaved bus and his skin covered with glitter and engine oil. About the way that he is difficult and cranky and confusing as hell, but also clever and sharply funny and secretly kind.
Draco stiffens against him, fingers coming to rest in his hair. Harry forgets how to breathe. Everything is pulled tight, motionless around him, and then there is a warm mouth pressed to his, a smile against his lips and three words spoken into the space between them that make his heart swell and ache.
Draco meets her sardonic look with one of his own and then turns his attention to the photograph. It’s fuzzy around the edges, as though it has been taken from quite some distance, perhaps by one of the Prophet employees who skulk around near the Magical Menagerie, always waiting for Harry to step outside and do something newsworthy. Irritated, he scans the article, and is just about to fling the paper aside when he sees a small box tucked into the bottom corner of the front page.
As soon as the shop quietens, Harry leaves with Mr Borteg’s blessing and heads down to the flower shop to buy Esmee something bright and cheerful. The afternoon sunshine is warm on his skin and seems to gentle the wind until the touch of it feels merely refreshing. He walks through the busy shop, waving to a grateful Shan, and climbs the stairs to the flat. He opens the door to find Esmee curled up on her patchwork sofa, covered in blankets and scowling at a book while steam pours out from under her hair. It’s strange to see her without one of her colourful scarves, and in her fluffy red dressing gown she seems smaller than usual.
Harry looks at the plate of cakes on the counter. He listens to the scratch of Officer Kettleworth’s pen on his notepad, the ticking of the clock on the wall, Sophie’s fingers tapping on the edge of Mr Jennings’s stool. For several seconds, the little shop almost seems peaceful, and then:
“Am I talking loudly?” Harry shouts as they walk into the Prophet building a minute or so later. “I can’t tell any more.”
“No, he’s just leaving,” Draco says, but Harry is already out of his seat and tipping twenty silver Sickles into the metal scoop.
Hermione smiles. “Sorry, Harry. It’s working for MLE that does it; I can’t seem to switch it off. I hope you have a great time shoe shopping, and if you ever do have anything to tell me, you know where I am. I know I’m really busy these days with work and the kids and everything, but I just… I don’t want you to ever doubt how important you are to me.”
“You taught them that, didn’t you?” Harry says to Draco, recalling the stag night and the driver that no one but him could remember.
,” he mumbles, aiming at the weakest part of the door and casting with a calm steadiness that Harry envies.
Serafina turns bright red, her darkened glimmer answering the question without her permission. Luckily for her, Luna thinks, Benny has no idea.
Rose looks up, apparently entertained by this image. Harry smiles at her and she smiles back. Hugo throws a piece of potato into Harry’s lap.
Molly and Arthur follow him inside and he weaves through the tables in search of Draco. He finds Needle attempting to tug an unsuspecting woman’s napkin off her lap, several smiling waiters and waitresses, but no Draco, and he is just about to check the kitchen when Narcissa calls to him from her table.
Stanley trundles towards the jars with purpose, knocking off the lids with his antennae and bumping into the glass jars one by one, each hitting the carpet with a soft thud-swoosh gentle enough to evade Draco’s attention completely and leaving Harry free to watch with delight as Stanley capers back and forth in a multicoloured ocean of ink.
“I thought perhaps we could go over…” Draco looks at Rose and lowers his voice, “the investigation this evening, after she’s gone home. I assume she’s going to be here for the rest of the week now that she’s on holiday from school, and I don’t want to alarm her with talk of… unpleasantness.”
When Draco returns, Needle rises from his crate and makes a nuisance of himself, clattering around Draco’s legs like a misshapen cat and mumbling his fingers until Draco bats him away, at which point he settles beside the desk and watches beadily as Harry drinks his Pepper-up. He gasps at the rush of heat and braces himself for the steam, gripping the arms of his chair as it pours out of him and into the cool air of the distillery.
“Can I have a humbug?” Harry asks, deciding to chance his arm while Draco is obviously thrown off balance.
“Well, don’t leave town,” Draco says, and the lightness of his tone makes Harry feel even crosser. “You never did answer my question about the restaurant.”
“Aye, well,” she says after a moment. “Ye cannae run forever. Youse’re good lads. Youse’ll face things head on, I know it.”
The ladies glance at each other, each nodding slowly before Ida reaches into her handbag and pulls out a small object. As Harry watches, she uncoils a long, flexible pole with a gleaming, brass eye-shaped device attached to the end. The eye blinks at him and he blinks back in surprise.
“I managed all of those things all by myself for many years, Harry,” Mr Borteg says, fingers twitching at the end of his plait, which today is tied with an elastic band and a sprig of holly. “Many, many years. Your community needs you, and I shall fend for myself.”
Stanley clicks, pulling impatiently at his lead and tugging it out of Draco’s hand. Triumphant, the beetle flaps his wings and scuttles straight into Ivy’s lap. At the sight of him, Magnus jumps and pulls his hand away from Fergus as though someone has sent a Stinging Hex up his back.
“Sounds reasonable,” Harry says, heading to retrieve the tools from the chest and smiling to himself at the thought of Draco wielding a rake or hoe.
“First of all, you would never show me up,” he says, holding her at arm’s length and looking fiercely into her eyes. “Second of all… it’s not that fancy. I promise. I’ve been saying that for years and I’d never even been in. Now I have, and I was really wrong. Just wear something that you’re comfortable in and it’ll be fine.”
She nods. “My grandson usually takes care of things, ye ken, but he’s out of action at the moment, the lazy bugger.”
“Because I always hit my head on the loft hatch, and then I drop the box of baubles on my foot. As you well know.”
Perplexed, Harry reads the note again. Hermione doesn’t mention the reason she was cooking carrots at ten in the morning, how she managed to burn them, or what carrot-based dish she thinks is Ron’s favourite meal, but she is his friend and he’s not about to let her disparage herself like that. Grabbing a pen, he flips the piece of paper over and scribbles what he hopes is a reassuring response. By the time he has fed the owl a bit of leftover breakfast pastry and sent it on its way, Mr Borteg is waving his arms around with spiky enthusiasm and waxing lyrical about the properties of magical woods.
He steadies himself on Draco’s shoulders, catching his breath when their eyes meet. A hand comes up to support him at the waist, fingers brushing his skin and pouring hot lead into the pit of his stomach.
“They’re Slughorn’s problem, aren’t they?” Harry says. “He probably hasn’t even noticed there’s anything wrong yet.”
With that, the old man leaves the studio, allowing the heavy door to slam behind him. Draco watches him for a moment, breathing in the faint smell of butter mints that follows him wherever he goes and wondering, as he often does, just how long Lofty Lee has been on the payroll of the WWN. He has asked around more than once, and the consensus is that he has been here ‘forever’. All Draco really knows is that every now and then he turns up with a handful of parchments, and he puts on the longest song he can find in order to frown at them and attempt to decipher the listeners’ comments from Lee’s spider-scrawl handwriting.
Draco blinks. Harry lifts an eyebrow and then turns away, carrying his lunch over to the counter and leaning there with the air of someone who is completely unconcerned about whether or not someone else wants to order some slightly fancier straw.
When, half an hour later, everyone is drifting in a sugary haze and Ida’s chair still remains empty, Harry starts to feel anxious despite assurances from everyone on board that she will be along soon. By the time the teapot has been refilled and emptied, though, the ladies are darting concerned glances at each other and the jigsaw in the centre of the table has barely been touched.
He nudges Draco, and together they watch Eilish, Corrie, Danica, and Ida making their way back to the bus, loaded down with bags and followed at a careful distance by a snow-covered Juno with a sweet wrapper in her mouth.
“Well, then. That’s how things are done in Strath Kinna. Youse may have noticed there’s no very many of us around here,” William says. “We get by on trading favours, ye ken... I bring Gertie eggs and milk from my farm, and she gives me a good meal when I want it, and a few bottles of her beer, too. That’s what we do.”
Work is as good a distraction as any, and with only twelve days until Christmas, the shop is soon full of people seeking gifts of all kinds. Harry helps them with his best smile and finds that the time passes mercifully quickly. At three o’clock he heads out to collect Rose, feeling exhausted but accomplished, and together they visit the brand new tree in the centre of Diagon Alley. Florean has chosen a fat, bristly individual that tops out at around twelve feet high and smells so deliciously festive that Rose closes her eyes and sniffs until she sneezes. The fountain, now crouching in the shadow of the vast tree, splashes water against the coloured lights, creating a shimmering halo of reds, greens, blues and purples. At the top of the tree, a glimmering star spins and throws glitter over anyone who steps too close.
She can hear the reporter, now the loudest thing in the street once more, talking rapidly about the movement of the earth, moon and sun, repeating what appears to be the same information over and over again.  The sky is already beginning to darken slightly as the moon seems to edge over the sun, and she glances up through her WWW spectacles every now and then as she and the others settle the children on the ground with cups of pumpkin juice and spectacles of their own. According to the reporter, the exciting part is the totality, which will only last for a few minutes, but the children seem quite excited by the whole process, and when they are not staring up at the sky, they are chattering happily about just how many pianos the money they have collected will buy.
The rain starts up again as they sit at their usual table in the Old Trout, and both of them dart anxious glances at Gertie, who is scrubbing down her bar like a demon and does not appear to have noticed the change in weather at all. By mutual tacit agreement, they rush their food and pelt back to the cabin as quickly as they can, where to their astonishment they find that the bucket is as dry as a bone.
“Molly, I have no idea what to say to that,” Harry admits. “The thing is, I didn’t come here to talk to you about Draco. Well… I did, but not in that way. Oh, god, do you mind if I go back outside and come in again?”
Draco nods. “Some people call them fairy cats. I can’t imagine that any of those people have tried to pick one up when it doesn’t want to be moved.”
Harry suppresses a groan and forces himself to look at something else. Rose. He can look at Rose. She is colouring away with one red plait dangling onto her paper, while the other lies neatly along her back, vivid hair standing out nicely against her dark green dress. He knows it’s one of her best, as are the shiny patent shoes and the glittery tights. She looks festive and pretty and Harry once again considers his ensemble and wishes he knew how to dress himself. His smart trousers, dark shirt and jacket are clean and they fit him, but he clearly doesn’t know what he’s doing, and when he sees Mr Borteg for the first time, he has no idea what to think any more.
“We’re going to be out in public and we’re going to be representing Starlight, so what does that mean?” asks Deb, looking around expectantly at all the eager faces.
“Good,” he says, wiping away all the patterns with his hand and gazing out at the snow, now littered with tracks and turned orange by the streetlamps.
“He came in with Patrick last night, if I remember rightly,” he says, rubbing his chin and indicating a bearded man at a table by the fire. “He might know something about it.”
“I was telling her how you thought Draco Malfoy was driving the Knight Bus,” Ginny continues, hopping up onto the counter. “She thought it was the funniest thing she’d heard since Fred told her that joke about the goblins and the cucumber.”
Harry walks slowly through the crowds of weekend shoppers, sipping his mulled punch and stopping whenever he feels like it to look at anything that catches his eye. With a vague intention of proving to Esmee that he isn’t one of those young people who leaves everything to the last minute, he has made a list of potential Christmas presents and stuffed it into his coat pocket. In reality, however, he has been wandering around for over an hour already and has failed to buy anything but a cup of hot punch and a bacon sandwich.
She knows that people think she’s odd, and she also knows that it is partly because she always seems to be saying something odd, but it’s just so easy to forget to slow down. She tries, but her brain is constantly making connections and leaping all over the place whether she likes it or not.
“He didn’t bite anyone,” Draco says brightly. “And Mrs Purley seemed to like him. She tried to feed him a sandwich.”
Then, taking hold of her spirits and flinging them skywards, she turns to the page with Harry’s picture and starts to write. Perhaps they have all waited long enough.
runs an article asking for volunteers to help restore Hogwarts castle and grounds, Harry, Ron and Hermione have been there for almost a week. He knows his two best friends have plans of their own but they stay for as long as they can, and the three of them work together in the summer sunshine, rebuilding smashed sections of castle, restoring ruined stretches of lawn and helping a grateful Hagrid to put together a new and better cabin that Hermione assures him is completely fireproof.
The other thing that goes without saying, of course, is that Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy are in love with each other. Unfortunately, neither one of them is going to do anything about it, and she’s not sure if that’s entirely due to stubbornness or if it’s just possible that they don’t actually know it.
He tries. Pansy is always telling him that he spends too much time thinking about Potter, but then she’s been saying that since they were both eleven years old. It’s just habit, that’s all.
“You knocked over my peace lily, you little reprobate,” he chastises, booting Stanley away from his feet so that he can inspect the damage. “Ivy and Magnus got me that. They thought it might make me more…”
By the time Harry sits down for breakfast on Saturday morning, he has endured three separate ‘little chats’ from members of his own house, two of them going so far as to stop him in the corridor to offer their thoughts on why he should stay away from ‘people like that’.
“It is starting to feel personal,” Harry admits. “It’s possible that you weren’t chosen at random. Maybe you and Mr Jennings and Reuben and Mrs Purley are connected somehow.”
Somewhere above, a parrot screeches and a second tells Draco to ‘look around, watch your step!’ so he does, making his way carefully around the shop floor, peering into cages and tanks and watching with interest when most of the occupants peer right back at him. Halfway round, an enormous, heavy-bodied snake dangles from the rafters and he jumps, stepping back and steadying himself against a tank full of luminous purple frogs.
“Me too,” Mrs Purley echoes, finally losing control of Needle as he rushes to Draco and promptly sits down on his feet.
The sound is dry and warm and wonderful and it seems to vibrate through Harry’s whole body, leaving him feeling unbalanced.
Hearing Draco’s footsteps on the decks above, Harry glances around the table, certain he can fashion a hat if he can think creatively.
Harry and Draco are standing among the long grasses in a pool of moonlight, tangled together and kissing desperately. It’s not a first-time sort of kiss, either, all messy and slightly off-balance. It’s a different sort of desperation—slow and intense and full of promise. Harry’s hands are threaded through Draco’s hair and Draco pulls him in tight, fingers slipping under the hem of Harry’s t-shirt and onto his skin. Around them, the vivid sea green and the fierce scarlet are burning, crackling and roaring around them, merging over their heads in a burst of fiery bronze that steals Luna’s breath. Her fingers press into the rough tree bark as she tries to decide whether to dance with delight or run away and ends up doing neither.
“I don’t know,” Harry admits. “If I was interested in someone, I think I’d probably want them to know. Especially if they might be interested in me, too.”
“Good friends are hard to find,” she says, cutting him off with such a gentle tone that he immediately feels remorseful. “Enemies who become friends are even harder.”
“Well, this… us… I do realise that it isn’t following the usual plan,” he says, frowning, and if Harry didn’t know better, he’d think he was nervous. “It’s been a while,” he adds quietly.
“Of course.” Draco wraps his fingers around the book and flattens its unruly pages for a moment. “But one day, she’ll finish finding herself and she’ll come home.”
“I found more of this,” he says, holding up a bag containing a frayed piece of hessian. “And some brown string.”
“I’ve no use for a thing like that,” she laughs, and his heart sinks. “A wee bit of this, though, wouldn’t go amiss,” she adds, leaning over again and enclosing Harry’s bicep in an alarmingly strong hand.
,” he says triumphantly, picking up a tall green bottle with an impressive drawing of a trout on the label. “It’s an Islay, it’s definitely younger than it tastes and I think it’s a nice bottle. What do you reckon?”
“No,” Corrie says. “It’s not. But I’m a rebel and I want to see Harry in his hat. Ah, I want to see all of you in your hats!”
Harry opens his mouth to protest and then falls silent. In truth, he has no idea what Molly and Arthur would say if he brought a Malfoy to lunch, and while one side of him insists that there’s only one way to find out, another, usually unheeded, suggests caution.
Harry wakes to find the cabin oddly silent. At first, he thinks the lack of sound is merely due to the fact that Draco appears to have wandered off somewhere, but when he looks out of the window and sees the sun, he realises that water is no longer pouring through the hole in the roof and into the bucket.
“It’s only a matter of time,” Harry mumbles to himself, pushing open the door and sighing with satisfaction when the bell tinkles softly above their heads.
“You are here on behalf of Ms Granger, gentleman,” he says, and though his tone is every bit as cultured as Mr Fortuna’s, his words are soft, almost sighed out into the enormous office.
Both women laugh uproariously and Harry flushes. There is something about him, he has learned, that is irresistible to women who are old enough to be his mother. As there doesn’t seem to be anything he can do about it, he doesn’t see any harm in using it to his advantage.
“Yeah,” Harry says, kicking off his shoes and crawling onto the bed. The bedclothes are just as soft as he has imagined, and when the last item of clothing has been stripped away and flung onto the floor, he stretches out, relishing the feeling of the quilts and blankets against his bare skin. Draco sprawls out beside him, arms and legs forming only the faintest contrast against the pure white fabric, cock flushed and hard against his stomach.
Everything Draco is wild in his veins, pulling him tight and stretching him thin with wanting. It’s been a strange journey, like nothing he has ever experienced before, and though he knows now, he
“Thank you,” Draco says, accepting it and seeming to steel himself. “Just one more thing… we spoke to Reuben this morning and he told us that the two of you were no longer together.”
Harry hugs Esmee, smiling when her curls brush against his face. “I’m so happy for you,” he whispers.
“How do you know it’s a she?” Draco asks, lowering his voice as though the goat might hear him and take offence.
Together, they watch the snow whirling past the window and the huddled shapes of people making their way along the cobbles. The shop is warm and safe, filled with the scents of clean wood and sugar and Rose’s peppermint shampoo. She leans back against his chest and he supports her there, relishing the feeling of trust and contentment.
“Wise decision,” Draco says, getting to his feet. “I’m sorry about taking advantage of your sofa, but I had a wonderful time. Thank you.”
At the counter, a middle-aged man with a beard is waiting, and he smiles at Harry when their eyes meet. A moment later, a second bearded man emerges from a back room with steaming cups of tea, and then walks among the shelves, straightening packages of padded envelopes and rows of birthday cards.
“Eat it while it’s hot,” he says as he wanders off into the aisles, and when he looks back, Potter is gnawing cautiously as his sandwich and looking thoroughly confused.
“Isn’t he nice?” Audrey beams at him and then turns straight back to her chair, slamming it with multicoloured spells that seem to be doing nothing but making it smoke slightly.
Draco smiles. “Do you want to come back to the Manor? Possibly the best duck pond in all of England? Or do you have to get back to work?”
“They are a credit to you,” Narcissa says, rising to shake Molly’s hand. “I shall look forward to meeting more of them tomorrow.”
The doors of the bus swing open at last with a hiss and a creak, and everyone stops their chatter to peer into the shadowy interior.
“The bus,” Harry repeats, fingers slipping on the bar. “Would you like me to go and make it less visible?”
“Right,” Molly says firmly, looking around at her family. “Lunch is ready, so, George, you go and get your father and Angelina, Percy, go and wash your hands if you’ve been touching the funny step, Ron, you and Hermione start taking these dishes to the table, Ginny’s got the knives and forks, Charlie… CHARLIE, sort out the plates, wherever you are… Harry, you and Rose fetch some extra chairs, and who have I forgotten?”
going to get cold and wet?” he wonders, struggling to imagine Molly abandoning her festive roast to the elements.
Harry flushes. “It was just Needle, and… you know what? Please just forget I asked you that question.”
“You missed all the excitement yesterday,” Danica says. “We picked up a whole family of passengers.”
“Fine. Look… it’s complicated,” he says, hating the word as soon as it’s out. “There’s someone I’m interested in and I don’t want to mess it up.”
“We know,” Harry and Draco mumble as one, Draco’s eyes catching Harry’s and seeming to glow with amusement.
Harry sighs, pushing his food around on his plate without interest. “Do any of you know who took that photograph?”
“Don’t start,” Harry groans, but the others are laughing and he can’t seem to control his smile. “We are not talking about Draco, and besides, it’s eight to a team. There’s no room.”
“Why don’t we try expanding the doorway?” asks the smiley one who came to them one day and never really left. He makes everyone happy, including Stanley, who has been allowed to ride with him on a broomstick even though it’s a secret.
“Spit it out, Luna, the suspense is killing me,” Draco says, leafing through Deb’s magazine and affecting boredom.
“Why?” Harry asks, even though he knows exactly why. His stomach is heavy and uncomfortable, and the thought of opening the letter makes him feel quite sick.
Draco rakes his hair from his eyes and shrugs. “I told you, Harry, it’s fine. I’m not going to fall apart.”
“It hasn’t been weeks, that’s ridiculous,” Draco says, frowning and riffling around for the old copies of various publications that always seem to be lying around whenever he doesn’t want one. “I’m sure I saw an article about him the other day...”
One by one, the shopkeepers return to the street, seeming to gather around Harry and Draco with their updates and expectant looks. Instinctively, they look to Florean, and he laughs gently.
Harry can’t be sure exactly what happens next. As every muscle in his body relaxes into the mattress, he has the vague recollection of mumbling something about Draco not being done yet, but then there is a rumble of warm laughter and a hand in his hair, and everything goes dark.
Needle lifts his head and makes to get out of his new malt crate bed but Draco holds out a hand and he settles, contenting himself with watching the customer’s every move.
,” Draco says, and his tone is so harsh that the swan retreats to a corner and folds himself into a contrite position.
By the time he has finished, he has filled two sheets of parchment and packed in at least five apologies, plus a promise of a donation to the cause and a recommendation for a lovely lady named Penelope, with whom he has worked on several similar projects.
As they walk out into the corridor, the editor calls out to them: “I’m sorry, gentlemen, but this business is what it is.”
Draco glances at Harry and then shrugs, grabbing his coat and stepping off the bus. Feeling suddenly rather warm all over, Harry follows him, standing by his side while he shields the bus from view. The biddy club, closely followed by Juno, are already stumping off down the lane.
“Hello,” he says, smiling at Corrie, Ida, and Eilish and finding an admiring look for Danica when she takes up her chair and gives him a shrewd little nod.
“I see,” he murmurs, and then he is kissing Harry breathless, reaching into a bedside drawer and withdrawing with a glass bottle that is shockingly cold against Harry’s skin.
had nothing to do with this, but Mr Malfoy, I distinctly remember telling you that you were not permitted to enter the patient’s room yesterday.”
“I think you mean a myth,” Harry says after a moment of confusion. “You know… swans don’t break people’s arms but sometimes people say they do. It’s not true.”
“Not today, Harry. I have testing to do and I’d rather not confuse my palate,” he explains, lifting a hand in a brief farewell and lurching back into the distillery.
Draco stares at the gently rippling water with deep suspicion. “This is your big plan? Hypothermia?”
He returns to the bedroom to find Draco stretched out in shirt and boxers, sleeping peacefully with Needle by his side.
“Come on, Magnus,” says the girl, and when her purple shoes pass the bench where Stanley is hiding, he twitches a hopeful antenna.  “We have to keep looking. He’s probably really cold and scared by now.”
“Yes,” Draco says as though it should be obvious. “Of course I’ll fucking miss you, but Christmas isn’t just a big meal and a few presents.”
“Have you got any Muggle money?” Draco whispers. “Because I haven’t! They’re not going to like it if we just stand here and stare at them.”
Luna stares at her friend. “There’s a little bit of Slytherin in you somewhere,” she says, and when Ginny grins, she grins back.
Amused, Harry takes his cup and saucer and attempts to put Draco out of his head, at least for a little bit. He feels accepted by these ladies and he doesn’t want to think about how they would feel if they knew he had upset Draco. The disappointment of a little old lady is a powerful thing, and he has seen men much stronger than himself crumble beneath it.
“I think we should keep this between the four of us for now,” Florean says at last. His eyes drift to Needle and a flicker of a smile almost breaks his grave expression. “The five of us. We don’t want to create panic.”
“Are you going to join them?” she asks, and Harry is pleased to see that she is holding a tray of currywurst.
Potter says nothing. He carries on writing as if Draco isn’t even there, pausing every now and then to flick bits of bright purple hair out of his eyes.
Two minutes later, Harry and Rose set off up the street, pointing out various bits of wedding preparation as they pass.
Harry pauses, taking in the shelves full of yarn and wondering if he might find something for Corrie inside. Five minutes later, he emerges with a paper bag containing a set of decorated wooden needles and a ball of wool as soft as Juno’s fur. In Flourish and Blotts, he picks up a book about endangered magical insects for Ida, and in the shop next door, he finds a baking tray for Danica that can be altered to cook cakes in a whole array of shapes, just with the tap of a wand, and a subscription for Eilish to a ‘Rare Tea of the Month’ club.
“Give her to me,” Mrs Purley says, taking the box and smiling down at the mother Kneazle and her kittens. “If we can get the café cleaned up, I can start making hot drinks. All the tea and coffee’s in tins so it might still be alright.”
“Maybe,” Ginny says. “Hey… and we could put some of the buckets in the shop when we open up again. Me and George and Verity could wear our PJs, too!”
“Secondly, only one of the incidents so far technically counts as a break-in. The others, while malicious and cowardly, were more… taking things while no one was looking,” Draco says, irritable expression pulling at the corners of Harry’s mouth.
“Yeah,” Harry says, wanting to smile but feeling too uncertain of his surroundings to do so. “Usually. Not when you’re marrying Angelina Johnson.”
“I think that’s for the best,” Harry says, hoping that Ron has no idea about the number of spiders his daughter has brought home over the years.
Seconds later, everything below is being pounded by hot, fat raindrops. A collective groan goes up from the assembled students and all at once, the lawn seethes in a scramble to collect belongings and dash for the castle. Draco goes to grab Stanley only to find the lead whipping away from him as the beetle pelts across the grass as fast as his little legs can carry him. Clearly terrified, he tacks and clicks and weaves across the lawn, sodden leather leash snaking behind him. Draco glances at Harry for a split second and then breaks into a sprint. Despite his boots and the deluge hammering over him, Stanley is surprisingly speedy, and Draco has to push hard to keep him in sight. He can just about hear Harry’s footsteps behind him over the roar of the thunder and the rain hammering in his ears, and the knowledge that he, too, is concerned for Stanley makes every sliding, squelching step just a little bit easier.
“Do you really think he can’t stop?” asks Serafina, as Harry hunches over and performs what looks like a kind of chicken dance.
He does not go to the Magical Menagerie. He does not even stray close to it; in fact, he opts to avoid Diagon Alley altogether with the exception of the vital, very essential monitoring of the Eye in the Sky. He continues to report, attempting to ignore the squirming discomfiture in the pit of his stomach that asserts itself every time he remembers that Potter might just be listening. Because Potter listens to the show; he listens to Draco on the radio, and however occasionally that might be, Draco is quietly horrified with the idea. Horrified and, more worryingly, embarrassed. It has never occurred to him that Potter might do such a thing, and every time he thinks about it, his head is full of all the things that Potter might have heard, and a shameful heat creeps up the back of his neck.
“I’m going to go and get you that Pepper-up now,” Draco says, putting on his coat. “You’re going to drink it, and then, because I know you’re too stubborn to go home and rest, we are going to sit here and figure out what to do next.”
He’s not an expert on the making of fine whisky—he’s never even been much of a drinker beyond a few beers with his friends—but he relishes the constant opportunity to learn from a man who has spent decades travelling and studying and creating beautiful spirits. Mr Borteg is an artist; he mixes and tests and adjusts until he makes magic, like firewhiskies that fill the whole body with warmth, gins that dance on the tongue and vodkas that jolt like a stunning spell and a Pepper-up in one.
“No. I got them from Sage,” Draco says, and Harry says nothing, silently drawn to the way Draco holds his triangle with both hands, strong, elegant fingers gripping the toasted bread as though it might escape at any moment. “Mrs Purley certainly knows her way around a bacon sandwich, but no one makes cheese toasties like Phillippe.”
The fire is really coming to life now, and the flickering light is soft on Draco’s sharp features. His hair, drenched and then dried by charm, is slightly wavy as it falls over his forehead. Harry wants to touch it, but he forces his mind back to the issue in hand.
On a cold December evening, three men stand around a frost-covered Christmas tree and discuss the best way to make it fit through the nearby doorway. Behind the door itself, a beetle hides with antennae twitching.
“It’s a Muggle primary school. Most of those kids have never even heard of a bristle beetle,” Harry says. “Anyway, I’ve got our tickets, all paid for,” he adds, producing a sheaf of pink sugar paper strips from his pocket.
Corrie leans towards him, needles clicking. “Because last time we played, I beat his little bottom at it!”
“Winter stew,” he reads, admiring the plain typeface and the frill-free description. “Chicken and tarragon soup. Spinach and pine nut ravioli. Slow-roasted belly pork with—”
“You stole it,” Harry teases. He coughs, scowls, and soothes his sore throat with a gulp of hot tea.
By the time the second week of term is over, Harry has given up trying to reason with his classmates. They don’t hear a word of the arguments he puts forward, despite the use of logic that Hermione would be proud of. The Slytherins are still furious at Draco for, in their words, ‘ruining everything’, and everyone else seems to be fixated on informing Harry that Draco hasn’t changed a bit. He is quiet and contemplative, having finally dropped the mask he’s worn for most of his life but yet to find a new face for the world, but when Harry attempts to explain that this doesn’t mean he’s ‘up to something’, he finds himself the subject of pitying smiles and ‘Oh, Harry’-s.
To his surprise, his stomach rumbles along with her, and he glances at the clock on the dashboard. It’s almost midday. The kitchen at the Burrow will be full of delicious, savoury smells by now, as Molly hurries around, stirring things and basting things and peering over Arthur’s shoulder while he makes one of his wonderful desserts.
Harry doesn’t notice it at first. After a long and rather active night down by the lake, he is ravenous, and has no attention for anything besides his bacon and tomatoes. He doesn’t look up when the post owls swoop into the Great Hall, nor when they drop letters and packages and newspapers beside the plates of those around him. He has only just had a letter from Hermione and he hasn’t ordered anything in weeks. Vaguely, he wonders if he should give Draco some kind of gift, and then he hears it. A gasp, and not a quiet one. Then another and another, until the entire cavernous space is echoing with shocked little whispers. Instinctively, he looks across at Draco, who is staring at his copy of the
Resting on his hands, he breathes slowly, shivering with the aftershocks of the sensation. Draco strokes his hair out of his eyes, fingers now warm and gentle. Carefully, he tugs at Harry’s arms until he collapses onto the bed, presses a kiss to the corner of his mouth and gets to his feet.
“Yes,” Draco says, expression indicating that Harry should be a lot more upset by this turn of events. “You got rid of it, and now it’s back.”
“I don’t think we’re allowed,” Draco says drily. “She thinks that excess alcohol will compromise our work ethic.”
“Pumpkins aren’t Christmassy,” Thora says solemnly, looking up from her own rather drab efforts and over to where Ida is now lifting the tiny orange thing and examining it from all angles.
There had been more, and there had certainly been images more unsettling, but all Harry can really remember is the handshakes. The one he had never accepted on his first day of school, the ones, begrudgingly and perfunctorily given after Quidditch matches, the strange, tentative one offered for the return of a wand, and the most recent: cool, strong fingers wrapping around his and pale eyes bright on his in the cab of the Knight Bus.
“Brown paper packages, tied up with string,” she sings, smiling. “These are a few of my favourite things.”
Just as he is arranging the parcels under his tree, a Ministry owl flutters onto his windowsill and taps at the glass. Harry takes the proffered envelope and grins to see a card with a picture of woodland creatures and a message from Timothy.
“Where the treetops glisten, and children listen…” he sings along, grinning and attempting to avoid Harry’s eyes.
“Crimey?” Draco repeats, eyes bright with amusement. “Are you sure your brain isn’t poaching in there?”
“Are you really going to sit here and just wait and see? I’ve watched you fight a dragon, Potter, I think you can handle the Daily fucking Prophet.”
There are no giant tomato-eating spiders to be seen in the grounds of Starlight, but the children do spot some beautiful late butterflies, a family of hedgehogs, and several brightly-coloured snails. Unfortunately the midges are also out in force, and while their repelling charms manage to shield the children quite effectively, Luna and Draco both finish the walk covered in small, itchy bites.
“Fortunately, I have an idea.” Draco gives Needle a stern ‘stay right there’ look and then gestures for Rose and Harry to follow him. “Come on. Bring the spider with you.”
“Audrey, I’m sure you know what you’re doing but if you want, you can have my chair. It’s quite soft already and I’m just going to go and talk to Draco,” he says, getting to his feet.
Disapparating on the spot before he has chance to do anything illogical, Draco returns home for the weekend. By the time he has changed his clothes, taken care of his duck pond, and eaten lunch, he has almost forgotten about Harry Potter and his intriguing behaviour. After a typically chaotic night out with Pansy on Saturday and a lazy Sunday spent in his sunroom, surrounded by succulents and scattered reading material on upcoming events that might be important for the show, he feels relaxed—at least, as relaxed as he ever feels—and ready for whatever the week may throw at him.
In the corner opposite theirs, the two men from the Post Office are playing chess with an ancient-looking set that appears to have been cobbled together from the remains of several others. Gertie’s grandson is sitting on the settle, crunching chips and leafing through a newspaper. The man who had been sitting at the bar when they first arrived in Strath Kinna is in his usual spot, slurping his soup contentedly. He meets Harry’s eyes over the heads of the other diners and offers a friendly wink.
“Merry Christmas, Mrs Malfoy,” he says, set off balance by her soft floral perfume and the new flicker of kindness in her eyes.
Harry climbs aboard the Knight Bus on Monday morning to find Draco grimacing, narrowing his eyes against the non-existent sunshine and losing humbugs from his breast pocket every time he moves. Grinning at the realisation that Ida must be back with them, Harry automatically looks to the back of the bus, only to find the curtain firmly shut and the tell-tale ripple in the air that comes with a hastily-applied silencing charm.
Harry follows them out into the crisp morning, inhaling the bitter scent of winter and something new, something savoury and spicy and delicious. Now that the snow has melted and the bracing wind is back, the aroma wafts into his nostrils and starts to pull him down the street towards the fountain. When he glances at Draco, though, he stops, caught by the bewildered look on his face.
He waves to Mr Jennings, who is standing fretfully in the door of his shop, and Sophie, who is heading towards him with a cup of tea, having apparently appointed herself as his temporary carer. When he reaches the festival area, he heads straight for the German sausage stall, following his nose and the growl of his stomach. As he waits for his order to be prepared, he watches the newest festival performer, a man in a glittering circus costume who is walking about the cobbles on stilts that must be ten feet tall. He hops from stilt to stilt as though each is an extension of his body, and the gathered shoppers clap and throw money into the collection tins.
Cautiously, they edge backwards, taking care as they descend the slippery grass on the hillside and make slow but steady progress in the direction of the barn with five curious goats in tow. Draco has to halt every few paces and call out to them again, but each time they trot forward, shiny black eyes alight with mischief and intelligence. By the time they reach the barn, all five are calling back to Draco at regular intervals, and Harry is beginning to develop a headache. Still, he can’t hide his feeling of triumph when he slams the barn door closed behind them, and he doesn’t say a word when Draco glances around, pulls out his wand and loops a simple containing ward around the whole building.
“Needle,” he murmurs, clearing a path for the swan, “If you do this right, there are some very tasty grasses in your future.”
By the time they rouse themselves to leave the pub, the sun is hanging low in the sky, pouring orange and golden light over the calm surface of the loch and turning it into molten copper. Still, Harry knows better than most that lakes are almost always colder than they look, and he reminds Draco of this, even as he is setting down the crate on the flat rock and pulling off his wellingtons.
“In all honesty, I was lost in a dream,” he says, pale face suddenly wistful. “Sitting in my chair in the back room…” He pauses, flinging out a black clad arm to indicate what is less of a ‘back room’ and more of a fully-equipped distillery. “Musing on the intricacies.”
“Right,” Harry says, wiping soot out of his eyes and standing up straight. He takes a deep breath. “Someone needs to check for shoppers and then ask Tom to close the entrance.”
“I’ll pay,” Harry insists, gently dislodging Juno and grabbing a handful of coins from his pocket and scanning the list again. “Unlimited day ride with a cup of tea. I’ll have that.”
“‘I thought you knew’?” Draco repeats, helping him up and then dragging him into a heated kiss that tastes like tea and chocolate and warm exasperation. “I love you, you absolute tosspot,” he mumbles against Harry’s lips, threading strong fingers into his hair and keeping him close. “I don’t know why... I really don’t know why.”
Next, Harry heads to Cherish, where he knows he can pick up delicious presents for almost everybody. He has learned, through years of trial and error, that simple edible gifts always go down well with his family, and come free of the awkwardness that flashier efforts often bring. He is all too happy with this arrangement, especially where Molly’s fudge and Ron’s chocolate biscuits are concerned. There is always the possibility that Hermione will try to make macarons again, but it’s probably best not to worry about it. Or think about it at all.
Harry listens as everyone hurries to assure everyone else that they, too, will open their shops and cafes and restaurants for Christmas Eve, and no kind of thieves or explosions of soot are going to stop them. Heart full of warm pride, he smiles and drinks the tea that Draco has acquired without seeming to move from his side.
. At the sight of Harry, he stops abruptly and takes the wheel with an expression that clearly says, ‘You saw nothing.’
By the time winter turns into spring, the seventh and eighth-years are caught up in revision and panic, dormitories strewn with parchments and muttered spells in every corner. Harry, Draco, Ron and Hermione sit down by the lake, surrounded by textbooks and study guides and broken quills. Harry throws scraps for the Giant Squid, wondering how Angus is doing and whether any of the villagers have noticed his increased size. The
He glances at Draco, relieved to see that he is still scribbling and muttering to himself, and then turns back to Stanley, not quite in time to prevent him from scrambling onto his lap and covering his favourite old jeans with little green footprints.
Taking a deep breath, Harry reads the rest of the letter. There are no surprises there, and it doesn’t matter. He knows what he has to do, and it feels good. He isn’t going away for three months, to Eritrea or anywhere else; finally, something, someone, is anchoring him, needing him, holding him steady, and all he has to do now is accept the weight of it.
“Look at this,” Shan says, picking up a banknote and turning it over in her hands. “It’d be even easier to rob our tills if all our money was made of paper.”
A gentle sigh travels through Mr Borteg’s skeletal frame. After a moment, he reaches deep into a pocket and produces a coin. “Black cherry will suffice.”
Cherish is already humming with life, several customers queuing at the till and peering into the display cabinet, so Harry hangs back and takes it all in. Borteg’s is quiet first thing in the morning, and he is always happy to linger here, drinking in the bright colours and the dizzying scents of cocoa, sugar and exotic spices. Esmee emerges from the back room where she and Shan have been designing, tempering and creating chocolates for longer than Harry has been alive.
Draco looks at the ground. “Because… I can’t believe I’m about to say this, but… if we get my coat and go out the front way, Needle will know I’m going somewhere without him, and he will be cross.”
“That’s lovely,” Harry says, and before he can stop himself, he adds: “Don’t you want to keep some for your own family?”
“Yeah, just… zoned out for a minute there,” he lies, closing Thora’s card and picking up the next one in the pile.
“No one,” Harry says firmly. “We’re all going to go to Florean’s meeting and we’re going to figure this out.”
Harry lets out a sound that is somewhere between a sigh and laughter, and he rests his head against Draco’s, pressing a kiss to his hair.
“I’m fine, Harry, don’t fuss,” she chides, still beaming. “They fixed me up wonderfully; in fact, I think my hip is better than it was before! I could do without all this pitching about, though, I keep spilling my tea.”
She holds her hands out for the pearls and Harry passes them over. Miss Lister watches, barely breathing, as she looks over them and then holds her hand out for the string.
In the chaos that follows, Esmee taps Harry on the shoulder and hands back his money, still folded into its swan shape.
“Mr Potter,” she says, eyebrows lifting towards her severe hairline. She glances between the two of them, momentarily speechless, and then grants Harry a little smile. “Well, obviously
“You’ll be big enough to go with them soon,” he tells the little boy, who yawns and winds little fingers into his own curls.
Harry, who is standing at such an angle that he can clearly see Corrie’s cards, thinks they would all be very interested to know that she has neither an Ace of Diamonds nor an Ace of Hearts. He is also completely unsurprised that her pile of Knuts is the biggest by far.
Draco snorts, vanishing his food tray and getting to his feet. He pauses. “Do you remember Corban Yaxley?”
“That’s right,” Mrs Purley says, gesturing with her spoon. “She asked me so many questions you wouldn’t believe it. Wrote everything down in a little book.”
Ignoring the curious glances of the elderly couple throwing food for the ducks, he drops to his knees on the damp grass and sets down the box. Slowly, the swan uses its weight to tip and then clamber free of its cardboard prison, massive wings held in a defensive crown. For a moment, the two of them regard each other in expectant silence, and then the swan strikes a bite at Harry’s trouser fabric and splashes into the water without a backward glance.
For long seconds, they stand motionless, grass waving around their knees as the wind sweeps through the countryside. Then Draco sighs.
When he has paid for his first class stamp and handed the letter over to be sent out with the rest of the day’s post, he looks around for Draco, finally spotting him peering at what appears to be a roll of bubble wrap.
“Please stop worrying about it,” Draco says, and his voice is so kind that Harry’s words of protest disappear into the cool air. “There must be more things that link these people.”
Harry smiles and shakes his head, arching into the touch for a moment before pulling Draco towards him until they are tangled together, citrus and cold skin, hands moving slowly, slowly, and quick-quick-slow, matching their rhythm and reaching for kisses broken by hisses of pleasure. So ready for this, Harry needs it, and when Draco’s hand flies frantically over his cock and then stops completely, he lets out a soft cry of frustration.
“Rose, learning the capitals of the world is a lot like making whisky,” Draco intones, so close that Harry can feel his warm breath on his skin.
“Right, that’s it,” Draco says, turning back to the wheel and putting his foot down. The bus lurches, shivers, and then hurtles along the road so rapidly that the chandelier pitches and rattles overhead and Juno leaps onto the table in surprise.
At twelve-thirty on Friday afternoon, Draco strides into the Magical Menagerie, ducks the dangling snake and drops a paper bag onto the counter.
He can still taste his cherry-chocolate-almond ice cream from the day before, and as he takes off his coat, stokes the fire and heads behind the counter, he wonders if he will ever go back to honeycomb and fudge sauce. It’s still delicious, but he feels different somehow. Clever old Florean.
Draco shrugs. “The ones who only come a day or two a week are younger, but these ladies… anywhere between ninety and a hundred and twenty. Actually, I think Eilish turned a hundred and twenty-two this year.”
Harry lobs the ball of paper into the fire and flops onto his back on the hearth rug, hands over his eyes. Every last bit of his warm contentment has drained away, to be replaced by a swirl of confusion, betrayal, and stinging regret. He’s not sure if he regrets getting involved with Draco in the first place or just regrets not just leaving the issue of the other driver well alone, but either way, everything is upside down and he hates it.
“We’ve been coming here for years,” says Danica, sharp eyes scanning his face. “And there are others.”
Instinctively, Harry checks that his teeth aren’t stuck together and then continues his circuit of the shop. He picks up glossy chocolate buttons for Hugo, a box of delicate chocolate teabags with assorted aromatic flavours for Hermione, and a set of dipping sauces for Ron that includes salted caramel, fiery chilli chocolate and the intriguingly named ‘explosive surprise’. With some effort and a lot of ‘excuse me’-s, he fights his way through the swarms and collects chocolate animals, moving chocolate machines and bags full of whizzing, glittering treats for the rest of his family. Halfway to the till, he checks his list and remembers that he still needs a gift for Rose.
“This isn’t about them,” Draco says, mouth flickering in a bitter smile. “This is about you. You can’t stand the thought that you didn’t know everything about me.”
Of course, Harry might be absolutely fine, she tells herself as she walks slowly down the drive at half past five that evening. The wind plucks at her hair as she walks, flapping it gently around her shoulders and filling her nostrils with the rich smell of earth and trees. He might be buried in his books without any idea what day it is. He might have had enough of all of them after Saturday and merely be taking a break. Most of the time, she relishes the unknown; it means curiosity and discovery and excitement, but today... well, it can take a running jump into a giant’s cereal bowl.
The snow is still very much present on the street, despite the midday sun making its best efforts to shift the lot, and when the Knight Bus careers into view, its wheels kick white powder over everything in sight. Harry, however, has learned, and protects himself with a Shield Charm until the bus comes to rest.
Draco gives him a look that could sour wine. “She does and she doesn’t. She doesn’t really like rattling around the Manor all by herself, so she stays with me quite a lot. She has her own bedroom and she likes to sit around in the restaurant and watch people.”
“If anyone around here is spoiled, it’s not you,” he tells the mouse, who is now poking his nose out of the cage and sniffing with dedication. “No,” he mumbles to himself. “It’s not the mouse, it’s the
Realising that Magnus and Fergus are now staring at him, Draco sighs. He loathes big pronouncements but he’s fairly certain he’s going to have to make one now, whether he likes it or not. Two of his favourite students need him, and he’s going to have to say
“And finally,” he says, master of ceremonies mask firmly back in place. “You must construct a shelter, without the use of magic, for when you inevitably displease your wife and she makes you sleep in the garden without your wand.”
Sam leans back in his chair. “I’m sure it is, but we don’t have the spare cash for something like that.”
Draco drops the parchment and leans back in his chair. “That’s the part you would focus on? Not the sharp objects and the exploding mammals?”
Draco hovers by the driver’s seat, clearly thrown off balance by a bus full of people, all paying attention to him at once.
“She’d never know,” Ron says with confidence. “It wouldn’t be my first time having two Sunday dinners.”
Harry picks it up. It’s a new one, bright orange with a grinning spider on the front. He wonders how Ron feels about it.
“I won’t,” he says, and Harry sighs, knowing just how hot-headed his friend can be. Once he’s got something between his teeth, he shakes and shakes until it comes apart.
Draco lets out a sound that is half laugh and half whimper. “Everything. Table. Armchairs. Biddies. I can’t.”
“Thanks for that,” he tells the girl, and then rejoins Draco, who is already lifting the dust from the rows of bottles with a charm so delicate that Harry hardly dares to breathe in case he disturbs it.
When Grace weaves across the stage, iridescent jellyfish ribbons swaying, all six of them wave, grin and give thumbs-up in various combinations. The little girl beams in surprise and waves back, adding an extra twirl and a little bow. At the front of the stage, Rose steps forward.
“Did you all hear that? Pansy wants to talk about my ducks... well, let’s do that. My ducks are wonderful. They are well—thriving, in fact—and I’m hoping they decide to breed this year. Because then there will be more ducks. And, as we have established, I like ducks.”
Harry shrugs, relieved when Mrs Purley brings his drinks and then horrified when he remembers that he gave all his money to the collection. Feeling his face burning, he turns to Draco.
Across the Great Hall, Draco is pushing away his plate, meal practically untouched. Roast chicken is his favourite, but he’s clearly not in the mood for eating, and that fact makes something prickle dangerously inside Harry. He glances over at the staff table to find that only Slughorn, Madam Hooch and Trelawney are currently present. He makes the mistake of meeting Trelawney’s eyes and she stares at him, hand flying up to her mouth in alarm. As quickly as he can, Harry gets up, seeing her do the same. He is faster, though, and is safely inside the Gryffindor common room before she can catch up. The last thing he needs right now is to hear about his impending death.
?” Deb asks, slamming into the office with a stack of files and staring between Harry and Draco with a look of pure confusion on her face.
“I know all sorts of things,” Draco says, and then shrugs. “My mother has one. Did you used to have a shop in Bath?”
With a huge effort, he walks away, out of the kitchen, through the dining room and into the street. The cold winter air blasts into his face and he groans, unsure if he wants to throw up or burst into tears. When he tries to take off his coat, he realises that he’s been clinging to his broom the entire time and he just about resists the temptation to throw it across the room. Instead, he flings his coat onto the rack and seizes the broom, sweeping savagely at the parquet floor until he longer feels as though he’s about to collapse.
“No one would know that horrible man was ever here,” Draco says. “I don’t know about any of you, but I will be opening tomorrow morning as usual.”
Luna opts to stay for dinner and she takes a seat next to Horace, who is all but surrounded by his adoring fans.
“Do you want to know what happened?” he demands, and then continues before Draco has chance to open his mouth. “Here’s what happened. In fact, let’s start right at the beginning of what happened, shall we? Let’s start with a child who was famous before he could walk. You’re familiar with that story, yes?”
Somewhere in the kitchen, a flame roars and one of the chefs calls out in a language Harry doesn’t recognise. Seconds later, a sizzle and the scent of cooking meat fills the kitchen. It’s a strange place to have a conversation like this, but Harry doesn’t much fancy the dining room, either.
“He knows how to behave now,” Draco assures, and while the man doesn’t seem completely convinced, he slowly turns his back on Needle and pulls out a scrap of parchment.
“Draco, we can’t wait for you forever,” she says. “Danica is about to invoke some kind of poker by-law that I’ve never even heard of. Oh… Harry, are you leaving already?”
Harry glances over his shoulder to check on Draco, only to find him engaged in what looks like a very intense conversation with Molly, Ida, and Danica. Deciding to leave him to it, he turns back to Ron.
Stanley scuttles closer and tacks softly, hoping to be allowed to join in. She laughs and strokes his shell, but the boy looks cross.
Harry laughs. “That’s me. Listen, doesn’t it bother you that no one we spoke to yesterday saw anything on either of these days? Nothing suspicious at all?”
“I’m so sorry about yesterday, Harry,” Hermione says, smile flickering as Rose hugs her tightly and then moves onto her father. “I know you wanted us to have a good time—and we did,” she adds loudly, before moving closer to Harry and lowering her voice. “But I’m sorry we weren’t there for you. We could have helped you clean up… or run the bastard down,” she whispers crossly.
Harry replaces the cube and walks past Needle into the living room, where Draco is standing with a cup in each hand, completely absorbed in the morning weather report.
“One Sickle into the tin, love,” she says, indicating the donation pot on her trestle table at the edge of the ice. “I’ve got tea, coffee, hot chocolate and crackleballs.”
In the chaos of surprised stumbling and trampled feet that follows, Harry stands in silence. He’s rather excited about the next stage of their evening. It’s been a long time, and he can’t help holding his breath as he waits. For long seconds, nothing happens, and then the hulking purple shape leaps out of the fog with an almighty crash, forcing everyone to step back as one. The bus seems to shimmer in the fog, radiating an aura of magic and nostalgia strong enough to make Harry’s heart race in his chest.
interfering,” Draco says, and a tiny, crooked smile ignites something in Harry’s chest. “But I think… perhaps you’re wanted, too.”
The man in question merely nods to her and settles his violin on his shoulder. He calls a count to his band and seconds later, the air is full of rousing music that makes Luna want to spin in circles, like Draco and Eliza on an imaginary mountain top.
“Maybe it’s the sky of another planet,” Harry suggests. “Maybe every planet has a different coloured sky.”
“How likely is that?” Harry mutters, taking both letters and opening them at Draco’s silent request. “All ‘O’s, I’m afraid,” he sighs, smiling to himself at Draco’s startled expression. “I passed everything... and I got an ‘O’ in Defence... and Transfiguration!”
Harry and Draco appear in the back garden of the Burrow to find snow falling softly and a collection of red-headed people in coats gathered around what looks like an enormous table.
With that, she stumps off over the cobbles and back to her shop. Rose, Harry and Florean exchange amused glances but Mr Jennings merely sighs.
“That almost sounds like a yes to me,” Harry cries, glimmer brightening as he reaches over to poke Draco in the arm.
Draco lifts a curious eyebrow but passes him the money without comment. As soon as he has paid Mrs Purley and picked up his drinks, he weaves his way through the café and out into the street. He’s an idiot, and what’s worse, Draco knows it, too. They stand side by side on the cobbles in silence, watching the shops preparing to open and the back-and-forth scuttling of Mr Jennings. Finally, Draco smiles, taking a triumphant sip of his coffee.
“Food’s good, too,” Harry says, looking at his boss’s rail thin body and wondering just what is holding it all together. The only thing Mr Borteg ever seems to eat is bits of chocolate from next door, and even those are few and far between. “Do you want me to go and get you a crackleball?”
After several months of that, Ralph (“it’s ‘Rafe’, for goodness’ sake”) had seemed refreshing, with his ready wit and exuberant spirit, but Harry had soon realised that while it was nice to have someone to squash up to on the sofa and to take to parties and pub nights and what had felt like an awful lot of weddings, ‘someone’ was not enough, and actually, he’d rather turn up alone than end up embarrassed because his so-called partner had drunk too much and pissed in someone’s topiary.
She goes easily to her, sleepy and stretched out with green eyes blinking slowly. Molly reaches for her immediately.
“You took it upon yourself to relocate the swan. The swan came back. You failed,” Draco says at last.
“You never really liked any of the other ones,” Ron points out. “I don’t know why you put up with it all these years. If it were me, I’d have told you to bugger off by now.”
“You’re barking up the wrong tree there, love,” Shan laughs. “I’m eighty-three and very happy with what I’ve got. No offence, Harry.”
“I’ll make sure he does,” Draco says, summoning Needle and propelling them both out into the street.
“Hello, lads,” she says, shutting the door on the cold. “What’s this all about, then? That’s the second time this month I’ve been summoned by a little note on my door.”
“I’m not too big,” Rose protests, and then narrows her eyes. “No, I am big. Like a big, lovely spider.”
Harry doesn’t know what to say. For a minute or two, he says nothing, just watches Draco driving and glances down at the strange little object that apparently means so much.
Danica glances at him as she tugs the curtain all the way back to the wall. “She’s a little bit forgetful sometimes. Are you going to come and have some tea?”
Harry grins and hurries to catch up with the others, racing up the spiral staircase with a spring in his step that makes him feel ten years younger and prompts Shan to comment that something good has gotten into him. He ignores her cackle and Esmee’s suggestion that what’s gotten into him is almost certainly a
“I see. And you thought you’d set me up with a fake date because you just knew I’d say something and ruin it?”
“It’s a cat, Potter, and don’t be rude. I’m sure she’s wondering the same thing about you,” Draco says without looking at him.
“The ridiculous gossip about Potter,” Draco says. “He’s seeing this person, he’s seeing that person, he’s going out too much, now he’s not going out enough... he’s losing his marbles...” he shrugs, unable to find satisfactory words to complete his sentiment.
He stops wondering about anything much when their food arrives and the portions are, if anything, even larger than the previous night’s. This time, Draco starts eating immediately and makes a point of finishing all of his vegetables. Gertie, having perhaps learned a lesson when it comes to the alcohol tolerance of eighteen-year-old English boys, draws them one pint of Ginger Rodent each before switching them to water.
“I’m not in the business of hurting people, Harry. I’m just asking that you take care. Draco cares deeply for you, and there is nothing in the world I care more about than Draco.”
Stanley looks at the enormous tree and wonders when the shiny balls and glittery strings are going to come out of hiding.
“Now we’ll get his boot print and see if we can match it to the one from the restaurant scene,” Timothy explains. “I’ve fixed it to his magical signature so we don’t have any confusion.”
Lowering her wand, Molly sighs. “It’s not real food, you know, that stuff from the supermarket. You won’t grow eating rubbish out of boxes.”
“Harry seems to have slipped into a trance,” someone says, and then: “Ronnie, did you slip him a dodgy memory charm again?”
Of course, what he needs to do is forget the whole thing. He needs to wipe it all away, forget about everything that has happened since the day he saw bright purple hair from the Eye in the Sky, and everything will go back to normal.
Despite his inefficiency, he feels oddly serene as the snow falls softly around him and dusts the shoulders of the skaters on the ice. He stops to watch them, hands wrapped tightly around his hot cup, and smiles to himself at the memory of Draco’s attempts to stay upright. Harry sighs, and his breath sends spicy steam spiralling into the cold air. It’s all so clear now, and though the weight of it makes every step that little bit harder, Harry doesn’t care. He loves this inexplicable man, with his terrible jokes and his stalking walk and his pure, unashamed reverence for his mother. He loves Draco, and it feels comfortable and brand new at the same time, like hearing your favourite song after years of self-imposed silence. Idly, Harry wonders what sort of song Draco would be and then stops when there’s a rustle and a brief count and then the sound of perfectly harmonised voices.
The room is surprisingly cosy, full of neutral fabrics and splashes of rich colour. The décor seems to match Draco’s personal style perfectly, and Harry is both surprised and not surprised to note a whole range of quirky items including an old typewriter painted blood red, a lit tree drenched in little wooden apples, and a grandfather clock stripped right back to its mechanism and pendulum, seeming to defy gravity as it sits in one corner and keeps perfect time. On top of a wooden chest of drawers, a wire basket containing balls of wool sits beside an enamel tin labelled ‘swan treats’.
The new duck is rather impressive, with his beautiful black and white plumage and his strong, sturdy feet. He is friendly, too, wagging his fan-shaped tail with enthusiasm when Draco feeds him a treat and runs a careful finger over his breast. Impulsively, he asks Harry to provide a name for the bird.
Harry watches Draco’s hands, sure on the wheel as he urges the bus through wild countryside, trees and hedges springing out of the way in alarm.
“There’s at least one present for everyone,” Shan says. “We don’t know what any of them are, so you can swap if you want to.”
“We should come back,” Harry says as they walk back down to the cabin, stuffed to the gills with pie and chips and stodgy dumplings.
“You gave all your money to the collection, didn’t you?” he says, and Harry tries very hard not to look at him. “He asked you for a donation and you just emptied your pockets.”
Harry gulps at the cold air and reaches for his focus. Never mind Draco and his ways, he has promised his boss a full report of the morning’s festivities and he needs to pay attention. Mr Borteg has never asked him to work weekends, but Harry is happy to lend a hand during busy times or at moments like this one, when the distillation process demands every last bit of its master’s attention. Harry has time, and he has time because his life is in perfect balance.
The day passes quickly in a whirl of customers, snow, and speculation. Everyone he meets seems to have some sort of theory about the thefts and none of them really make sense. Head spinning, Harry forces himself to focus on tomorrow’s meeting, but all he seems to be able to think about is what Draco will have to say on the subject. Perhaps more worryingly, he hasn’t seen Draco or the swan all day, and while he thinks he should be relieved, he can’t seem to stop himself from looking out of the window every few minutes, just in case.
“I’m the person who pays your wages,” the man says, squaring up to Harry and peering into him with watery little eyes.
Draco looks up at her, small smile weary but genuine, and then his eyes flick to Harry and Luna is temporarily blinded by the surge of scarlet and green light that results. The pulse of longing that stretches between the two of them is intense enough to leave her breathless, and when she glances at Sam and Mary Ann, she is bewildered to see them engaged in conversation as though nothing so momentous is happening right in front of them. Sometimes, people are… strange.
“I forgot the notes,” Harry mutters, darting into the shop and grabbing the box file. “He’s still talking to that poor lady about underground water sources.”
Harry allows the hat to be placed on his head and then looks in the mirror held up by the stallholder.
“Until midnight,” Draco says. “That’s when Papa Noel comes down the river in a boat pulled by alligators.”
Harry splutters slightly on his coffee and Luna thwaps him on the back a little harder than she means to.
Ida has accidentally let slip that an outing is on the cards, and if he’s going to spend another day walking around the park, he’s going to be well insulated. After a brief rummage in the cupboard under the stairs where disorganisation reigns, he finds a pair of violently orange Chudley Cannons gloves and a knitted hat that has ‘Save the Bristle Beetle’ emblazoned across the front of it. In the same bag, he finds scarves, pins, t-shirts and canvas bags left over from the same campaign, but decides against the full set, at least for today.
“I’m fine, love, don’t you worry,” the old lady says, brandishing her pipe at the hissing swan and fending it off quite effectively.
She takes another deep breath, this time allowing herself to enjoy the mingled aromas of food—spicy, sweet, fried—and the incense and heavily scented oils of some of the stalls they pass.
Harry unsnags several hessian fibres from a wrought iron chair. “Boots and a sack… why can’t I shake off the feeling that we’re being terrorised by Santa Claus?”
“I wasn’t born yesterday, Draco,” Potter mumbles, jabbing at Draco’s feet with spiky bristles until he steps backwards and almost right into the enormous snake. “I’m not giving you material for your show, and I don’t believe that you’ll suddenly stop annoying me if I do.”
“We’ll be sharks and then swans,” Luna says, extracting herself from the group in order to change the record.
“I don’t know,” Danica says, but when she leans forward to get a better look, the mouse takes off, spooked, and runs straight into the sleeping form of Montague.
He sounds content, just like Harry and Draco. And the others, they’re all getting there. The Happiness Project is well on track for success, she thinks, tucking away her notebook and fishing out the little silver button.
“I suppose it can wait a little bit longer,” Draco says with a theatrical sigh. “What will you tell them?”
“They’re having a night in a nice hotel and then coming back,” Harry says. “They don’t want to go off on holiday when it’s so near to Christmas—where would people get their crackleballs?”
“What on earth are you doing?” Mary Ann asks, appearing in the doorway and staring at Harry and Draco as though they have quite lost their minds. “I can hear you all the way from the kitchen! What’s tickling you?”
“She does,” Harry says, following Draco back out into the street. “I’m glad she’s not going to be here tomorrow. I think it might get a bit nasty.”
“It’s a piece of hessian from a standard goods sack. It’s not magical, it’s not special… it’s a sack,” Draco says with a shrug.
As night falls, the guests say their goodbyes and leave with cartons full of leftover turkey and vegetables. Harry’s eyes are beginning to close of their own accord when he hugs Molly and accepts an extra large helping that he knows will contain all the crispiest roast potatoes. Draco thanks her and gently boots Needle out into the snow, having already promised Charlie that Kingsley will be reunited with his new friend as soon as possible.
“Alright,” Luna says, touching her fingertips to Mr Abernathy’s glass pebble for luck. “Here’s the plan.”
William laughs. “She likes to look after waifs and strays,” he says. “Her children and grandchildren are all grown up now, ye see. It’s been a wee while since she had a project.”
That night, she eats Mary Ann’s delicious chicken casserole with the children and does her best to make sure that everyone has at least half of their peas. With the promise of jam roly poly and custard to come, even Gareth finds himself up to the task, and he is the biggest fusspot Luna knows. Afterwards, she drifts around the big old house, checking on the after-dinner clean-up crew, who certainly aren’t having a pirate fight with mops for swords, and the homework club, which is abuzz with muttering and tongues poked out in concentration.
“Is that mulled wine?” he murmurs, glancing around until his eyes fix upon a little wooden building, towards which the ladies are already trundling with purpose. “… at half past ten in the morning?”
“Of course you do. First of all, the word ‘continue’ in a brand new article makes it sound as though there has been a new incident, which there has not.”
“Don’t you think William should have said how to catch the bloody things?” Draco hisses, apparently no longer worried about upsetting the goat’s sensibilities.
“What? Oh,” Harry sighs, realising that his socks are, once again, singing, and Timothy is looking at him with unashamed glee.
It’s not as though Potter will care. He’s never seemed to care much about what he looks like. Then again, he does look a lot more put together these days—simple, casual, but no longer quite so much like he’s been dragged through a hedge backwards, and his clothes seem to actually fit him properly. The thing Draco always notices about him when he sees him through the Eye or in the newspaper is the collection of scratches and burns on his arms and hands, no doubt the result of working with difficult or frightened animals. He could heal them easily, but it’s as though he forgets that he can use magic. Probably it’s a result of growing up with Muggles, but Draco tries not to overthink it.
“No need to shout, dear,” she says, shaking her head and removing the trumpet. She frowns. “There’s something wrong with this.”
Louis looks to Ginny for help and she shrugs, pulling a dictionary out of her bag and flicking through the pages.
“She’s been back and forth between Hogwarts and the Ministry these last few days. I hardly think that it’s that she doesn’t care about you,” Draco says, and the words hit Harry somewhere sore and unexpected.
Horrified with himself, he takes tea and biscuits into the living room, settles in his fireside chair and opens the book Ginny gave him for his birthday. He has no idea what it’s about, and when, by seven o’clock, he realises that he still has no idea what it’s about, he gives in. Abandoning the book and dousing the fire, he pulls on his duffel coat, grabs his wand, and heads out into the street.
These things are always worth a try, of course, and Draco quietly congratulates himself for his restraint when, on Thursday morning, Pansy calls him over to the Eye to see Potter doing ‘something weird’ and he calmly finishes lining up the next record before heading over to join her. He thinks he is doing rather well when he manages to Apparate straight home after witnessing Potter walking up and down the Alley in flowing, multicoloured robes, and when, the next day, he leaves a trail of Fizzing Whizzbees everywhere he goes like explosive breadcrumbs, Draco returns to the Manor after the show feeling positively smug.
“I saw something,” Harry says grandly. He points at the Eye and manages to knock Ginny’s antlers askew. “Sorry.”
Over at Sage, it’s a similar story; this time, the kitchen has been the main focus, with ruined food smeared across every surface and several expensive items missing. The dining room floor reveals a set of shoe prints that seem to point to a hurried departure. Draco crouches to examine one of the prints while Timothy takes photographs.
He meets her eyes, furious with himself. “I’m so sorry, Mrs Purley. I’m in a world of my own. Two coffees, please.”
“Luna, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Draco says as the music starts up again. “Are we supposed to start this one in a square or a circle?”
“We need to get outside,” Harry shouts, raising his voice and ushering everyone out into the street, where they gulp at the clean air and attempt to brush off their clothes.
“Elegua is…” Harry hesitates, thinking of the flash of heat and Draco looking sad and Esmee’s stern face. “Actually, he’s pretty good. He’s leading me in a different direction than I expected, but I think I might be alright with that.”
“Five bottles of Borteg’s own and some very fine elf-made tumblers,” Mr Borteg adds. “Several more bottles smashed. Are you biting my finger, young sir?”
“Okay, well, if you work that out, feel free to let me know. I’m going to go and have a cup of tea,” he declares, already cringing at his theatrics as he ducks through the curtain and heads for the table.
“Mrs Purley, Reuben, Mr Jennings, Jean, you, Mr Borteg,” Harry recites. “Six people. Is there anything significant about the number six?”
“She’s not mine. She belongs to Bill, the guy who owns the shop. Still, I could probably borrow her for special occasions.”
“Great, thanks,” Harry says, taking off down the corridor and pulling Draco into the lift. “We need to go and see Hermione.”
“I think this is very elegant,” the woman insists, admiring the traditional Victorian baubles Harry has chosen and reaching out to spin one on its thread. The sunlight filters through the glass and onto the walls and she smiles. “I’ll have one. You choose.”
“What are you doing, you idiot? It’s… well, it’s very early, and… I didn’t even know that fireplace was connected to the Floo Network,” he admits.
He curls back up at Draco’s side, and they share the beer in between lazy kisses and drifting touches. It is strong, just as William had said, and by the time most of the bottle has been emptied, Harry feels slightly lightheaded, though he can’t be certain if that’s due to the alcohol or the fact that Draco is now slicking his cock with more lavender oil and letting it slide slowly in and out of his fist. When he is refreshed, he sets the bottle down on the floor and nudges Harry over until his back is pressed against Draco’s chest.
Harry smiles reluctantly and makes his order, opting to say no more about it. He pays, hails the bus from the nearest corner and steps inside, taking a moment for his eyes to adjust to the glow of myriad purple lights and the dancing reflections of baubles on every surface.
“Do you think they can speak Parseltongue? Because Parseltongue is snake language, but lizards are a little bit like snakes, so maybe they understand… a little bit.”
“Yes, though my mother is keen to meet Mrs Weasley, so perhaps you could bring her and Mr Weasley, too? It’s horribly short notice, I know, but we’ve got a lovely menu for the run-up to Christmas and I thought…” Draco pauses. “I’m not sure what I thought.”
. He’s handsome and clever and irritating and Harry doesn’t want anything to do with any of it. He has watched Draco from the safety of Mr Borteg’s window, watched him for years as he’s set up his restaurant and worked tirelessly to build it from a mere idea to the kind of place that requires a booking for afternoon tea and regularly plays host to Quidditch stars, musicians and the Minister for Magic himself.
Draco smiles but doesn’t look away from the road. He balances his half eaten apple against the steering wheel and pushes a fall of pale hair out his eyes with his free hand.
His hand flattens protectively against Draco’s back as the thoughts of suspicion and accusation creep into his head and steal like ice through the contentment in his heart.
“I see that my efforts are futile, like so many things in this life of ours,” he sighs, creaking behind the counter and folding his long arms behind his back. “I ask only that you take care of yourself, Harry.”
“I’ll clean the floor in a minute,” Harry says, suddenly feeling sleepy and not like playing Quidditch at all. The drum of the rain against the window has become soothing somehow, and he can’t think why he would want to be anywhere else.
They need all the sleep they can get, and besides, he has no idea what he’d tell them even if they were right here in front of him.
“You mustn’t hurt them, Corrie,” Ida says anxiously. “You could catch them and bring them in—I’ll put them in my roses with the others.”
“You should be ashamed of yourself,” says an excitable little man in a red cloak. “Your attitudes belong in the dark ages! I’m going to buy one of that lady’s things right now!”
“About which part of it?” Harry asks, looking around and realising that the biddies are nowhere to be seen.
“That’s what I was trying to say,” Ginny sighs. She points at the chickens. “Louis, qu’est-ce que c’est?”
“Fine. We have to let someone at Hogwarts know what’s happening. And by someone, I mean McGonagall.”
“Yes,” Draco says grimly, unsure whether or not to be disappointed that he’s dressed. It’s probably for the best. “And I’m not feeling it right now. I’m really not.”
She draws a leather box from her pocket and hands it to Harry. “They’re earrings,” she explains. “Amber studs. Esmee admired them the other day and I said she could wear them.” She smiles. “Something borrowed.”
“Do you think they’ve gone away?” Rose asks when they reach Cherish, peering through the glass and into the dark shop.
“Some third-years made a stall around the back of the…” Winston flushes and trails off, as if only just noticing that he is in the presence of teachers and prefects. “Erm, I don’t know.”
Amused, Harry Summons the box from the bedroom with another little flick of his wrist and sets about stuffing Stanley’s flailing feet into the little boots. Sensing adventure, Stanley clicks delightedly and scrabbles in Harry’s lap, making the simple task anything but. Draco just sighs and fetches his harness, strapping him in and suppressing a smile when the beetle struggles out of Harry’s grip and bobbles over to him, poking affectionate antennae through the holes in his jeans and stroking his skin.
The entire valley now looks beautiful, and Harry feels rather remorseful for thinking it grey and charmless. The hills are green, swathed with sharp crags and dotted with grazing sheep, the sky a cool, clear blue with trailing clouds, and the loch shimmering through endless colours in the sunlight.
They stand in the shallows, barely breathing, as something gargantuan rises slowly from the depths, spraying them both with cold water and sending up a hiss of spray so fierce that Draco has to close his eyes. When he opens them again, the Giant Squid is towering above the surface of the water, tentacles tracing slow arcs through the air. Just above the great eyes, dripping and gleaming in the first weak rays of sunshine, is a willow-patterned beetle wearing six tiny snowboots.
“Alright, then… so what we have to do, when Sam gives the say-so, is be the loudest, most exciting, most ‘look at us, aren’t we brilliant?’ thing these people have ever seen!” she shouts. “Alright?”
As the crocodile of children starts to move with Deb at the front and Sam at the rear, Luna rattles her buckets and walks alongside them, helping Harry and his boxer shorts and Draco and his fancy pyjamas keep everyone tightly together.
Halfway through the grasses, she sees Sam standing at the garden gate. He looks slightly anxious, but when he sees her, he smiles.
“Let’s get started,” she says, standing front and centre and beginning to work through the usual stretches.
“Oh, I… sorry,” Harry mumbles distractedly, watching as Draco stalks out into the snow and sweeps his wand through the air, causing the Knight Bus to shimmer and disappear almost completely.
Ron snorts and Harry catches the exact moment that he accidentally bites down on one of the floating things. He hides a smile and sips obediently at his soup as Hermione watches him. There’s something particularly…
“Since when were you an expert on animal skulls?” Pansy asks, and he shrugs, amused. She switches on her omnivox and begins to read the news, and Draco turns back to the window.
“I suppose I’ll... do something with all of this,” Draco says, regarding the old clothes in bewilderment for a moment and then setting his shoulders into a decisive posture that is quite at odds with his nakedness and sleep-ruffled hair.
“Make room for one more,” she calls, gesturing for Harry to follow her beyond the curtain. “Smile, Draco, it might never happen!”
There is ample room for everyone, and Harry wonders which one of them is handy with a space-bending charm. He doesn’t have much time to wonder as Ron and Hermione join them, taking off their coats and pulling up their chairs as their eyes flit around the dining room in an attempt to take everything in at once. Molly removes her cloak, startling when a waitress appears and spirits it away.
They all know she’s going to give in, and it’s during the resulting clucking and round of giggling applause that George finally arrives.
“Not in the way you’re thinking,” she says. “Not to me. But everyone else is... everyone’s looking, Harry. You’ve got to say something.”
“I’m taking donations, Harry. I’m sure you’ve heard about the dreadful goings-on yesterday. Perhaps if we all pitch in, we can help a little,” he says, and Harry is already reaching into his pockets.
“Oh, good grief,” he mutters. When Pansy finishes the news, he holds up the page to show her. “Can you believe this? I’m not a ‘humorist’, I’m a well-respected broadcaster. And if I was going to be funny, I would do it all the time, not just first thing in the morning.”
“I know,” Harry says, grimacing. “The thing is, though… the family sort of… isn’t… any more. Lucius is dead, Narcissa lives on some sort of commune in Europe, and Draco is alone, driving the Knight Bus pretty much twenty-four hours a day so that these mad old women have somewhere to meet up.”
Harry supposes he can’t blame him completely. It’s nice to be needed. And, he realises, with busy friends and no work to do, travelling on the Knight Bus as an unofficial, unpaid conductor has made him feel useful, too. In the space of two and a half weeks, it has become his place, and when he sits at that table in an armchair made for him by a crotchety bus, he feels as though he has always been there.
It’s all fine. In fact, it’s more than fine; it’s wonderful. Carefully, he places Stanley on a cushion in his favourite chair, taking a moment to remove all six boots and set them out to dry on the coffee table.
Harry lets out a sound of surprise and then loses his balance, gripping Draco’s waist and closing his eyes as the kiss softens and disables his higher brain functions. He presses close, feeling the heat pouring through Draco’s thin shirt as he slips his fingers inside his jacket and then under soft cotton in search of bare skin.
“Come on, let’s get inside,” Harry says, and with a raised eyebrow, Draco follows him down the road and into the little pub.
“Adam’s ale,” she tells them sternly, grey curls bobbing as she sets down their glasses. “Youse’ll no make a good job of that roof if youse’re out of your wee heads.”
“I’m not short, I’m… compact,” Sam says crossly, but when he looks at Luna, his expression is one of amused defeat. “You’ve thought of everything, haven’t you?”
Something is different, though and perhaps it is the strength and confidence of his movements as he controls the difficult vehicle, hands swift and sure and posture almost fluid in the leather chair that seems to support his every decision. The man he remembers was always stiff, pointed, hiding his uncertainty behind swaggering bravado, but this Draco seems possessed of a control that Harry can’t help but admire. He wonders just what the man behind the wheel thinks of him, and then he stops because he doesn’t want to know.
