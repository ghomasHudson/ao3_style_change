after all, and I want to lay with my lover," the last word came out as a hushed whisper and seemed to caress Harry through the air.
In the few weeks that followed Harry cherished his time at the manor, regularly checking up on Draco and detailing the blonde in his findings. Due to several new diagnostic spells with the aid of a new sensory potion, Harry had been able to determine that the pressure being felt on the blonde's already weak lungs was in a very weak state now and was not being caused by a virus. This had puzzled him greatly until he'd read a medical journal sent to him by his father about a man named Robert Koch who had identified that the bacillus causing diseases identical to Draco's as
It was a long shot, either way, but even she had missed Draco's grumbling about the Potter boy. It was only a matter of time before his moping got on her nerves and she didn't want any friction to grow between them. War or not, they were all friends first and foremost. She only wanted to see him happy, if only for a week or two.
Draco continued his stroking motions along Harry's naked arms and shrugged slightly against the pillows, "Not sure. It's something called 'How I met Your Mother' it sounds horribly cliché, but I've already watched an episode and it wasn't half bad," Harry chuckled but made no further comment as they both settled down to watch the upcoming episode.
Harry soaked up all of the information but it was too much too soon. He couldn't full digest it. He shook his head weakly from side-to-side, not because he was disagreeing, but because it was too many scenarios and consequences tossing and twirling in his mind for him to think straight. Finally his head lulled onto his shoulder and licked his lips, "Can I see him?" he whispered, so afraid of the answer was he that he almost hoped Severus didn't hear him.
A the brunettes confusion, Draco turned to her with a furrowed brow, "you didn't know?" he asked quietly. She shook her head. He let out a harsh bark of mirthless laughter that made Hermione flinch in her chair. "Typical. There always shutting me out of his life. I wouldn't be surprised if Harry died here and now and I'd have to wait to read his obituary in the Daily Prophet."
He didn't want to be around for Valentines Day though. He could only imagine how much rubbish Harry would get through the post from his numerous admirers.
December descended cold and brittle over the castle and cast a blanket of frost over everything beneath it. Draco spent most of his time indoors, looking out over the white world and wishing so badly that he really could turn into the 'ice prince of Slytherin' just so that he didn't have to feel the gnawing hatred from everyone, students and teachers alike, as they passed him by in the corridors or during classes -sometimes even during meals in the Great Hall. Ice would suit him perfectly, he wouldn't need to feel emotions or pain or the after-effects of curses and jinxes.
Upon exiting the hospital and into the muggle world, Draco stopped off at the small shop at the bottom, where relatives usually bought magical balloons and teddy bears for sick loved ones. Draco decided to buy a small beanie hat, lined with cotton so as not to irritate Harry's bald head. He paid the woman behind the counter, who gave him a sympathetic look and added a small 'get well' cake in a box to his bag, free of charge. Draco thanked her and then turned to Harry, tugging the price tag off of the hat.
He listened with half an ear to whatever Pansy was currently bitching about, and whatever Blaise was sneering about concerning the Ravenclaws he'd had in his charms class that morning. He wasn't really paying too much attention, lost in his own thoughts about what could be done over the Valentines weekend in regards to distracting Harry from the love-lorn fans that would no doubt be following him around like starved puppies, and didn't noticed the knowing look Pansy shot Blaise across the table.
Harry shivered involuntarily and nodded, "I would love that, as long as you're the one keeping me warm."
"Back?" Harry whimpered as the same time that Draco hissed, "We?" under his breath, like a vicious snake ready to strike.
On what would initially be Harry's last weekend at the manor before he needed to buckle down and study for his exams, not that they had known it until the following Monday, Harry had been in a bad mood for some reason or other. His physical examination seemed cold and almost foreboding as he helped Draco slip back into some fresh clean clothes, and then stationed himself at the ornate oak desk and buried himself in his work of sketching out Draco's body once again, an image that was always freshly engrained into his subconscious at the end of every day, before he took a break from his writing, to read to Draco and update him on any developments with his body as well as make sure he took his vital potions, no matter how bitter they tasted. Draco didn't necessarily like when Harry was in that particular sort of mood, he knew it was bound to have come to light sooner or later, but he didn't know the cause of it –unless it was himself –or just that the brunette man hadn't slept well. At around two o'clock in the afternoon, he'd had enough of the self-enforced silence on Harry's part and decided to ask. "Harry is there something that's bothering you today? You've been unusually quiet," Draco stated in a quiet tone as he read through one of his own books, comfortably propped in his armchair.
Slipping into his own nightshirt he went over to close the curtains and then returned to his own single bed on the other side of the room and crawled in between the cool, clean sheets and settled down to sleep.
Draco smiled and shook Cass' hand. "Hello, my name is Draco and this is Harry -and our hyper little dog, Seeker"
As soon as the plate was polished off he found a little note stuck to the plate. He tilted his head in confusion before plucking it up and unfolding it and frowned at the words;
His friends tried to help him prep for the task but there was no real way of knowing what would happen in the large maze that was currently growing on the Quidditch Pitch.
He gasped when he saw the room. He didn't know what he had been expecting but whatever that illusion had been was now shattered; the walls had been charred down to their bare stone and despite the sheer size of the room, there was nothing comely or homey about it anymore. Most of the stone had scorch marks on it and there was barely any light except for the faint light coming from a fireplace off on one wall that spluttered out a feeble aura of warmth. He cast his eyes around the room, his breathing harsh to his own eyes until they landed on the dull blonde hair of Draco Malfoy's bent head. Despite expecting to see the blonde his breath still caught in his throat and he hesitated, not knowing what to do.
Draco had wanted to say the words that had bloomed in his brain less than a week ago and he had rushed to Calais as soon as Severus' invite had arrived. He promised not to rush Harry and he always kept his promises.
That night, despite not getting to ask answer any of the questions fired their way, Harry and Draco stumbled into the Room of Requirement, their hands hot and heavy as they groped one another and scrambling to pluck the others clothes off. They were locked at the mouth, their kisses bruising, hot and damp as they breathed each other in, nipping and biting at one another. Harry pressed Draco up against the wall and started sucking at his throat, the skin soft and smooth between his teeth as he rubbed the older man through his trousers. He was hard and throbbing in the brunette's palm as he rubbed him. "Say it again," Harry demanded in a low husky voice that made Draco moan and thrust up into his palm. Before dinner the blonde had tugged him aside and confessed his feelings and Harry was going crazy with those words running in his head. He felt like he was caught in a dream. It couldn't be true, but it was, and he was relishing in the moment!
Draco smiled, his eyes glancing up to the clock on the wall. It was still rather late in the evening but it would be even later by the time they got home. A squeaking noise caught his attention. He turned his head to see the miserable nurse glaring at him, clutching a wheelchair before her. He smirked and then turned to Harry, "Harry? The bitch has brought the wheelchair." Harry's mouth twitched into a ghost of a smile, "come on, we'll get you home."
Harry chuckled to himself, "I know you do, baby, I just miss holding you in my arms whilst we sleep -it feels so empty each night, lying alone."
That's how he found himself half an hour later placing his wand on the mantelpiece above the fireplace and striding out several paces away from Draco before turning back to face him. He had a weak protection charm on his body that hummed gently over him, but he still felt fear bubbling up in his stomach as the blonde straightened up to fix him with a firm stare. There was no hatred in his eyes; just something so haunting that it left Harry breathless. "I've asked the room to help protect me as best it can, so as soon as you even think of an unforgivable or anything like that, you'll get reported."
Draco excused himself, his voice no more than a whisper, as he went into the kitchen to cook Harry something to eat. He looked as though he had not eaten in weeks -possibly more. The bags under his eyes were rough and heavy. His cheekbones were more prominent, and this worried Draco immensely as he boiled the water with a flick of his wand. He stared down at the bubbles, thinking that perhaps he should run Harry a bath. He was practically frozen to the bone. He sighed and added the chicken stock to the boiling pot of pasta, before bending down to put some food in Seeker's bowl.
He sighed, a ringing starting up in his ears from nowhere, and winced as the cool band around his ring finger swiped across his nose. He lowered his hand and glanced down at the plain gold band gleaming in the low light of his room. He'd been given it about four years ago, when Harry was finally comfortable with their relationship to go out and buy two plain gold bands and a pair of gold chains. The memory of that day was always fresh in his mind whenever he drew the ring off the chain around his neck and slipped it onto his finger so he could feel it imprint in his skin whilst he slept. It was too much of a risk for either of them to wear their rings out publically. It would raise too much suspicion especially when there would be no woman present around either of them long enough to even be considered their better half. He pressed his lips to the ring and then ran his forefinger over the precious metal. He needed to see Harry, he needed to talk to him and see if he was alright. He knew the younger man hadn't been sleeping a lot lately, late nights and early mornings weren't a good combination especially over a long period of time.
Draco hummed softly as he gave the other boys' fingers a squeeze. It was only then that Harry realised Draco hadn't let go of his hand throughout the entire time he'd been speaking. It made his heart feel oddly warm compared to how cold he'd become.
He had written letters to his blonde friend but had only gotten sporadic responses at best. These alone had worried him, especially when another letter from Pansy did nothing but complain about how Draco was being friends with Harry bloody Potter of all people, and how things for the entire Slytherin house had improved piece by piece. It still wasn't perfect, but he doubted that it ever would be any time soon. Maybe in a few years, but at present it still seemed a long way off.
Draco turned his attention to the corner and a happy smile spread of his mouth, "Wow that's beautiful."
The following morning he had felt beyond well-rested and as though he hadn't a proper care in the world. It was hard to hide how his aura seemed to glow around him, but he just couldn't contain it. Over the rest of the day he tried to keep an eye out and see who was watching him. There was no one.
Severus regarded his godson coolly, "I know what he did was wrong, and even being ill doesn't excuse him, but honestly, Draco, he wouldn't have come back if he didn't regret his actions. I'm surprised he's even fighting to get better as it is."
Harry sniffed lightly, drawing the back of his hand underneath his nose. "I feel so useless," he eventually breathed, his shoulders shaking as tears brimmed on his lashes, "I can't do anything for myself anymore!"
"It took me ages to understand that I'd developed a sort of –infatuation with you. Although it may have been because you were the only one who seemed interested in taking care of me and making me feel better," he turned to look down at Harry who in turn was staring up at him, his soft green eyes wide open and intense. "You were the only one to give me hope, Harry. I couldn't thank you enough for that. I think I might even Lo-"
It was the middle of July things still hadn't improved too greatly between Harry and Draco. Their business still flourished and they got a lot of people coming in every day for top-ups of to see if Harry would sign an autograph for a young child, but due to his hectic work schedule, which Draco was starting to think was more self-imposed than Harry let on, wouldn't allow him to be at the shop too often. The only downside to whatever was bothering Harry was that it was beginning to show to those who were often around them, like Draco's parents and Severus. They had been discreet about it, asking Draco when Harry wasn't in the immediate vicinity on one of their trips into Paris from an afternoon away from the apothecary and work. For his part, Draco didn't have much on the tale to tell, however what he did say seemed to have caused a frown to appear on Severus' usually expressionless face. This worried him a great deal but he pushed it to the back of his mind.
Without another word Draco stood up from the bed and extended his pale hand to Harry, "Come over here." Harry wanted to object but instead slipped his hand into Draco's and felt himself gasp as a jolt that felt like lightning zipped up his arm and straight to the back of his skull. His eyes flickered open to drink Draco in for the first time in ages. He shuddered as Draco led him over to the bed, their eyes expressing more than their words ever could. Draco slipped in among the bed sheets and gently tugged Harry down beside him, nudged him over on his other side and draped the blankets back over them. Harry felt tense and awkward having spent so much time avoiding Draco's touch. He licked his lips and waited for the familiarity to creep back into their touch but it wasn't happening. He felt almost numb as Draco curled his arms around the younger man and rested his head back against the pillow. They lay that way for a while before Draco's soft voice murmured, "Just relax, Harry," his breath tickled at Harry's ear. It took a while but soon Harry felt the tug of sleep and he finally relaxed in Draco's arms, the nostalgic feelings giving way to a momentary contentment that felt so much like bliss, that he didn't realise he had slipped into his nightmare before it was too late.
Draco shook his head as he picked at his food. "No, we didn't get around to discussing it, but he was quite angry. Stopped before either of us did any damage, but we relaxed enough before we went back to our dorms."
He suddenly felt every muscle in his body shaking as he snapped back to reality and stared down at the pillow clutched tightly between his hands in his lap.
"Pardon my intrusion, since you appear to be very deep in thought, but it seems to me that you've bored yourself into a catatonic state, unless I am very much mistaken?" purred a voice that trailed over Harry like silken ribbons wrapping around his muscles. He turned around on the spot in a whir of golden infused light and came face-to-face with a tall aristocratic looking blonde with chiselled alabaster features, steely grey eyes and petal pink lips drawn up into an amused smirk. Harry peered a little higher –the man was at least a head taller than he was –and saw that his slicked back hair was a fine shock of white-blonde hair that glistened like pale gold in the lamplight. The man extended his hand, clutching a flute of champagne in his free hand, and smirked a little wider, "My name is Draco Malfoy, son of Lucius Malfoy. May I enquire as to who you are?"
A knot of uneasiness settled in his stomach when he saw Pansy Parkinson walking up to him, a determined expression on his face. He tensed his shoulders, prepared to either walk away briskly or reaching for his wand. Despite what Draco said, Pansy had still wanted to give him up to the Dark Lord. Scared or not, she should have known that handing him over wouldn't have ended the war, it simply would have made it easier for the rest of them to fail and die. He cleared his throat and stood a little straighter, "Parkinson."
"W-what are you doing?" he asked as he gazed down with wide eyes at Draco kneeling down on the hardwood floors, basking in the glow of the candlelight and resting there in all his naked glory that had matured over the last two decades. He was breath-taking, and it reminded Harry of the night that he had asked Draco a very important question.
"As funny as that would be in the moment, Andromeda wouldn't like me setting that example. Besides, I don't think I want everyone seeing my dick, thanks."
He turned onto his back, staring up at the blank canvas of his ceiling, trying to figure out what life will be like in the months to come, his left hand draped over Seeker's warm body.
"And what of you?" the brunette man asked softly not wanting to upset his companion any more than he already appeared to be.
Draco glared down at him and then softened his gaze, "Don't be idiotic, Harry, it doesn't become you. And no, what I meant was that those letters reminded me that I needed to give once in a while and you needed to take. I love you more than I could ever love anyone or anything. Now please," he reached over and ran his fingertips down Harry's face, "Stop punishing yourself."
"Lucky Draco," Harry rasped, still staring up at the ceiling, his jaw clenching a little at the mention of the blonde man.
The rest of the day seemed to pass them by almost instantly as they dragged themselves to and from lessons. Potter was hardly ever mentioned, which was ironic considering just how much Draco used to complain about the boy. Now that they were friends -or was it more? -it was almost as though the scarred boy didn't exist to them anymore. Blaise couldn't deny that he sort of missed Draco's childish ramblings. True they had been annoying, but they had almost been a part of every day life. Now it was like a part of the boy was missing, and if getting that back, meant making the sod hopelessly in love with his once-rival, then so be it.
Draco lifted a corner of the towel and brushed it away, exposing Harry's skin to the cool air floating around the apartment. Harry shivered under his soft touches once again, before tensing and trying to reach for the covers, the towel -anything to cover up the obvious deterioration of his body. Draco stopped. He frowned before eventually emitting and soft sigh and reaching down on the floor beside him for the soft pin-striped blue and lilac pyjamas that Harry had removed from the dresser. They were soft under his fingertips. "You've made a good choice with these, Harry," he breathed as he took one of Harry's wrists lightly in his fingers and guided it through the sleeve of the open shirt. He did the same with the other arm, the weight of Harry's gaze upon him the entire time. Nimble, talented fingers skillfully slid each pearly purple button into its respective hole before the blond man leaned back to look at his handiwork. "Very nice," he smiled, straightening the collar around Harry's neck. He then stood up, and offered his arms out for Harry to mirror his actions.
And then came the night that Draco found out that Harry had died, and that he hadn't told anyone else about it.
"Weasley is just as stubborn as Draco is," Blaise stated dryly, "And from what I heard, it took a very basic one from Romilda Vane to get to him."
The last thing he did was remove the small, translucent orange tube of pills that were Harry's to take, twice a day. He swallowed thickly and went to place them on the bathroom counter next to their toothbrushes by the sink.
"Because it's a shadow of what it used to be for you. It's nothing but a mass grave right now, and even you can't deny that," the blonde reasoned mildly.
As soon as the realization settled like an iron weight in his chest, he choked on a few strangled sobs before wrapping his arms tightly around him and bowing his head. He was cold and shaking and wished more than anything to be wrapped up warm. But he knew that if he even dreamed of venturing to go to the dorms early he'd be ridiculed even further for not being manly enough.
There was no denying that there were feelings there, and they both knew it in the gentle moments of the night when they stayed later in the Room of Requirement than they were supposed to. The warmth of the fire and growing magic of the room, helped them to relax with one another and tentatively touch one another. It hadn't escalated past brief hugs and gentle hand-holding but Harry wasn't about to complain about it. They both knew the other was gay, but after everything that had happened before the Christmas holidays, he didn't want to ambush the blonde with emotions.
Why did he never remember to close the floo network? After the war he would have thought it would be on his main priorities every night; he double bolted the front door so why not check the floo network?
He said nothing as he stood from the hard plastic chair and followed the nurse through a series of corridors with disinfectant-armed doors, with pin-codes, until they finally arrived at Harry's private room. It was the least Draco could have done for his lover. The nurse hovered for a few moments, adjusting the covers on Harry's bed, before leaving him to his own devices. The door clicked shut, and he exhaled with relief, his mind sobering up instantly at the look of his lover, placed like a delicate flower upon a bland hospital bed, sheets tucked in around him making him look like a mummy.
"Potter," she said just as tightly. "Isn't Draco with you? I thought you were spending the day together?"
Draco rolled his silver eyes before downing the tonic and shuddering, "Nasty stuff." He winced after a moment and then his eyes shone a little brighter as he reached for his own butterbeer, "So what else do we have planned for today?" he asked, cocking a blonde eyebrow. For the rest of the day he couldn't help but look at Draco in a slightly brighter light. The stirrings in his chest and stomach gave himself away. He knew his feelings were more than just friendly. He knew that and had done since just after the Christmas holidays but he hadn't wanted himself to believe it. He had never gotten those feeling before, not with Cho or with Ginny. With Cho he had always been scared that she'd cry all down his front or snap at him for no reason. With Ginny it had been different but still felt weird, like she was a sibling. It had felt different but not in a good way.
It was half past eleven on Christmas Eve and Harry found that he wasn't tired as he sat curled up on the plush red armchair in the common room of Gryffindor tower. He was exhausted from working on his holiday assignments to the point that he'd practically finished all of them. He'd spread a blanket over his lap and stared into the fire as it crackled in the grate. He was so deeply lost in thought that the tapping of a barn owl on the window sill almost made him jump out of his skin.
Draco smiled softly as he massaged Harry's other foot. The kettle boiled. "Fancy some hot chocolate?"
The sound that ripped out of his throat would have scared wolves into running away. He hollered out nothing but pure, raw anguish as he looked over the pier as the lifeless blonde man dripping water. His throat was rough and scratchy as he banged his head back over and over on the planks, kicking his legs and pummelling his fists over and over until he wasn't sure if it was water running out of his fists or blood. He felt hands patting at his back and trying to force the rest of the greasy water up but it didn't ease the agony he felt tearing his heart and soul apart as Narcissa screamed out from the grassy banks, her hands coming up to her mouth as she collapsed to her knees and sobbed, clutching onto the narrow wooden railing for support as Lucius tried to pull her back up to her feet to no avail. She didn't have the energy to push him away. He watched as though he had floated out of his own body and observing as Draco's pale, blue tinted body was lifted away from the sodden planks and levitated back to Severus' house so that they could take him to the nearest hospital.
Harry nodded indicating the slid leather satchel in his hand, "Of course sir, as per your instruction."
Harry shrugged, "That's the problem. I have this whole new life, and a whole new take on it to come to terms with. A year on and I'm still struggling. I haven't even thought about what I want to do."
He nodded along to the small talk that was brought up, sipped at his pumpkin juice and picked at his food, only managed to squeeze a couple of plump grapes down his throat, despite how raw it was. He was in such a daze of his own numbness, his mind completely blank, when a hand rested on his shoulder. His head snapped up, cracking his neck, and he winced as he squinted up through the blazing sun up at Severus' expressionless face, his onyx eyes shimmering weakly with concern. Harry closed his eyes shut and then raised his eyebrows in question. "It's time for you and Draco to have that little boat ride of yours. It will do you both some good, even if it is just a quiet ride around the lake."
He hadn't meant to take things so fast that summer, but on one of the nights when they had taken an early evening picnic in the gardens underneath the cherry blossom tree as they had the previous year, he couldn't have helped how romantic the sunset shining in Draco's eyes had made him feel. That night he had thrown all caution to the wind and had leaned over to press his lips gently against Draco's. Mentally, he had been bracing himself for an almighty slap to strike his cheek, but it hadn't come. Instead, he had felt the feather light pressure of Draco's soft full lips responding underneath his own. The tender little touch had thrilled him and forced the air out of his lungs as they'd pulled away from one another and stared into one another's eyes.
Harry's breath hitched when the blonde turned to face him, his face half-cast in shadow by the fire crackling in the grate. "I can try and help, if you're willing to accept it this time," his voice held a tight strain of challenge to it, but for the most part he was anxious to know how he could help the blonde.
Despite the shortness of the letter itself, only taking up about half a sheet of paper, Draco had found himself unable to stop smiling when he'd first read it and even now as he read it on the train home many years later it still brought a wistful smile to his lips. It must have been very dull at Severus' house with nothing to do all day for three and a half months straight. He also wanted to cry a little. The hopeful note in Harry's words had struck chords within him he hadn't known were there until that letter was open.
All he could do was watch as they strapped Harry's body to a transportable bed and cast several complex spells on his figure.
Draco snorted dryly to himself and drew the blanket tighter around his body. "Just go. He's not coming back. We both know it."
Draco dropped another kiss to his forehead -Merlin, he couldn't get enough of those kisses! -before leaning back in the chair, "Come on. We'll be spending all day together on Saturday, right?"
Nuzzling his face into Harry's damp neck he suddenly felt his eyes burn with the promise of tears, "Forgive me, Harry," he panted in his ear, his sweat cooling on his skin as he shivered lightly. He squeezed the younger man tighter and pressed a kiss to his forehead, "I'm sorry. I ruined you!"
Harry took Draco in his mouth again to try and ease some of the tension from his pale body. He needed to make tonight as special for the blonde man beneath him as he could. He needed to remember not to rush anything, despite the burning ache growing inside him to just dominate the blonde over and over again until he was a quivering mess beneath him. As soon as he felt that Draco had relaxed enough he leaned up and increased the rhythm of which his finger slipped in and out of the blonde man's tight body. He bent down and twisted his fingers at an awkward angle as he slicked his middle finger and then pressed that into Draco's entrance too, stopping only when the muscles tightened dramatically around his digits. "Relax," he breathed out gently as he sucked on Draco's balls.
He really did have beautiful eyes, not that Harry was looking too much over at the blonde, trying to suppress his own embarrassed smile.
"Take me to bed, Draco," Harry growled lustfully. The blonde man didn't need telling twice as Harry was all but thrown onto his bed, the lean muscled blonde pressing down on him, the mattress groaning at their combined weight. Trousers and watch chains and shoes were tossed over onto the floor. As soon as Draco was completely naked he felt the fight ebb out of him as Harry sat before him and panting heavily. Both of their eyes wandered down one another's bodies and they both flushed bright red as they drank in how hard they both were.
Harry wanted to protest, but his words died in his throat as Draco shot him a pointed look. It was true, even he had to grudgingly admit to it. His face fell and he dropped his chin to his chest as he tried to relax his tense shoulders. "Yeah I guess you're right. I only came back here because I was sure that there was something I hadn't learned yet, or that it would fill my time before I managed to go off into the world."
Harry offered his own, weak smile as he leaned forward into Draco's opened arms; the feel of security that washed through him as those two, sculptured arms wound around his shoulders was enough to make him sigh with relief and contentment. "Thank you for helping me Draco," he murmured in the blond hair that tickled his nose as he was lifted up, away from the softness of the mattress.
Harry had stayed awake for another hour, tracing the contours of his lips as though Draco's own were imprinted upon his skin, before drifting off with a smile hiding behind his hand.
He shifted away, glaring weakly up at the brunette man who seemed unfazed. "What are you doing?" he asked irritably, feeling his greasy skin getting wetter. A bath would definitely feel great right now. Being clean would be a blessing.
Hermione narrowed her eyes even further, "no, he needs to be in the hands of a professional who know what they are dealing with!"
"Please let's not be formal, Harry. Call me Draco, unless I am royally frustrating you in which case call me whatever you like."
It was on one of those long days where he was observing some new spells that made it easier and safer to dissect body parts without any excess blood spurting out all over their robes that Harry received another letter from Draco. He smiled as he recognised the intricate scrawl on the front of the envelope. He never ceased to marvel at how beautiful his name looked written in Draco's hand. He flipped it over as he went over to sit in the hard backed chair at his small wooden desk and turned the oil lamp up a little bit more so that he could read in the gloom of the twilight. He felt his smile fall a little as he read Draco's latest reply.
"No!" Harry snapped up and then groaned in agony against Draco's shoulder at the white hot pain that ripped through him. Blindly, he reached over to the bedside table to swipe a dab of healing salve on his fingers and used it to smear on his rectum. Once the pain had dissipated, he settled down beside Draco and looked at with firm eyes, "Don't say any of that. Not now and definitely not yet. This is going to take some time to get used to. Just … Can we at least get used to it first?" he almost pleaded with the blonde.
The panting was by his knee now, their dog's head resting on his lap. It was a comfortable, familiar weight but it was not the one he wanted.
The hairs on the back of his neck stood up on end and he didn't know how he should feel. He felt violated at being so vulnerable and for clearly needing someone to look out for him, but he felt really unnerved and freaked out that someone was watching him so closely and carefully all the damned time. He would have been tempted to tell someone, but he knew that most of them would simply cluck their tongues and tell him that not everything was about him like he wanted it to be. He found his heart sinking as Severus flashed in his mind.
Draco actually sneered up at him, both of their expressions dark and ugly. This wasn't going the way Draco had planned but he had to work with what he was given. "No, actually I'm too tired for any of that," he snipped as he linked and flexed his fingers together between his knees, "I came here to ask you if you would like to come on a boat ride with me?"
Draco hummed at the back of his throat before shaking his head, "No, of course not. As an apprentice healer you have every right to want to ask questions. That's a good thing, bear than in mind for future reference. With Snape you can never be afraid to ask questions that may need to be asked, alright? He likes getting questioned. He feels that the less you question things at such an early stage, you might as well castrate yourself as soon as possible and go and wear ladies underwear." He smiled to himself, "And as for your question; it's been said that I have a weak set of lungs. I'm not supposed to live past the age of thirty if I can even manage that."
Draco watched from his armchair an hour later wrapped in a simple thin dressing down, a fresh nightshirt and a pair of slippers on his feet. He was eating a light dinner of fruit, dry seeded bread and cold cuts of meat and a bowl of soup. It wasn't a lot but he felt if he'd tried anything more he'd have been sick in the bathtub. Harry didn't mind the simple meal. It was good that he didn't because he had been scribbling in his journal for the past hour whilst explaining to Draco as simply as possible what he planned to achieve, and sometimes curing a fever may be the easiest way to go but it was also a good 'ice breaker' in some successful journals that he had read over the last few weeks. It was interesting and he had a good time watching how Harry's eyes sparkled.
Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes as he continued to stare down at the faded cushioned cover of the armchair. His throat was drying up and he could see Harry was going to argue against almost everything he could possibly say that would ensure Harry would be closer to him and further away from the hospital. He didn't want this, the constant fighting, the arguing the lack of understanding on Harry's part. It wasn't what had drawn him to the brunette in the first place. He understood that patients came first, but sometimes personal life needed to come first. "You can't save everyone, Harry," he muttered gently, so low that he wasn't entirely sure that the stubborn younger man had heard, but he decided that it didn't matter. Not at two o'clock in the morning at the very least. With a deep breath, he forced himself out of the armchair and made his way across the room to the door. He forced the handle down and opened it and he
"And you haven't been sleeping. Harry definitely hasn't, for quite a long time I believe. I want to know what the problem is. Have you two been fighting with one another?"
He had to wait in the drizzling rain for almost forty minutes by the time his delayed train pulled into the station. He was sure that his ticket had gotten soggy in his cloak pocket but he couldn't bring himself to care as he tucked himself into a seat, draped his soaked cloak over the chair opposite and pulled his satchel up onto his knees. He smoothed the pads of his thumbs over the locks, as though taking his time would lessen the low of what the letters had to offer him. He was half hoping that when he pulled the front flap up that they would have disappeared, leaving no trace for him to read. '
Blaise suppressed the smirk he felt threatening to crawl onto his lips. He found it amusing that Draco still insisted on calling the four-eyed git 'Potter' around them, as though they would take offence to the fact that the boy actually had a first name. "Any idea what that news was?" he asked, keeping his voice as neutral as possible.
The blonde breathed a smile and let his eyes drifted closed for a few moments, relishing in the after-glow of their love-making. They stayed that way for a while, cuddled together, their bodies kept warm by the fireplace as they lay curled in the armchair. At around eleven o'clock when the school clock chimed out over the grounds, they groaned in dismay and slowly disentangled themselves from one another and shuffled about, gathering their clothes off of the floor and pulling it on over their aching, wobbly muscles. As they left the room behind them, the door disappearing as they drifted hand-in-hand down the corridor, smiled grew on their mouths that, no matter how hard they tried, wouldn't go away. At the staircase, Draco turned to Harry, cupped his face in his hand and pressed their mouths together in a slow, exploring kiss that made the brunette's heart sing.
Harry let his eyes drift shut for a moment before opening them again. Everything felt so heavy and he didn't want to focus on the nightmares. He didn't even want to share them with Severus even if it did mean he might get some proper rest. He wanted to shake his head but he couldn't even do that. Should he tell Severus about the reasons why he didn't want to sleep? Or the reasons why he would wait until he was exhausted to the bone before dragging himself home to bed? Could he really reveal how messed up he was in his mind that his old teacher might even section him for some new experiment on the demons of his own psyche? He didn't know how he would cope if that happened. He didn't know how he would cope if that happened. And what about Draco? What. About. Draco? What was he doing risking Draco's health and everyone's else's something was clearly playing on his mind. He sighed and rolled onto his back and stared up at the ceiling his eyes raw and shining with a dampness. "I have been having nightmares that are making me not want to go to sleep. Since I've been working longer hours they sort of crept up on me and now … I can't sleep without seeing them play out in my eyes."
"Well I should avoid that short woman over there who looks a little bit like a bloat bullfrog," Draco stated in a cool manner indicating a rather rotund woman in a set of flamboyant pink dress robes, her brunette hair tightly curled on the top of her head, outlining the rather lumpy edge of her skull. Harry was momentarily captivated, wondering about the muscles that must strain to work as the woman rambled on at such a rapid pace that he couldn't help but wonder what kept her jawbone connected. "That's Dolores Umbridge, she tends to sneer down at a lot of people who don't meet up to her rather impossibly high standards."
Harry would never give Draco the satisfaction of knowing just how much that thrilled him to hear those words. He couldn't let the blonde become too egotistical after-all. Instead, he just smiled mischievously to himself and pressed a kiss to his partner's chest and said; "Of course. Anything you say, love."
Pansy huffed but gathered the knife and chopping board and jar of peppermint leaves over onto another desk so as to start her tedious task. She tried not to let it bother her as she chopped the leaves into fine shavings and piled them on the other end of the chopping board. She didn't have any qualms about what they were doing. It was all in jest and they would only be brewing a mild one, regardless, so after Draco's initial embarrassment had simmered down and he'd confessed his 'undying love' for Potter, then perhaps the hostility between the houses would gradually dissipate.
After the initial shock wavered a little, the two moved forth into the hall and took a seat at the far end of the Gryffindor table, right under the professor's noses. All eyes were on them, the hush in the hall was startling. Nothing seemed to move. That's when someone moved -or rather, two people moved. Hermione and Ron stood up from the middle of the Gryffindor table and edged down the aisle, and after a few hushed words, settled down opposite Draco and Harry.
"Do you accept this ring, Harry?" he breathed as he hugged the brunette man on top of him around the waist.
Smirking, Harry nipped his neck before moving his hand down to grab Draco's swollen member and start stroking him in time with his thrusts.
Draco frowned and turned his head to look down at the young physician in his arms. "What are you saying Harry?"
"Ah! London! I used to live down there myself with Oli until we decided to move up here. The weather is good here, if it's sunny it's guaranteed to be hot and if it's cloudy you're guaranteed cold and possibly rain. None of that bollocks London weather where it's sunny and pissing down at the same time."
He hated hearing those words. Whenever they'd tried to do something without magic, it had always left Draco feeling ... like he was lacking something. Most of those experiences had been limited to cooking and travel but sex ... that was just too intimate to tamper with, surely? Leaning back, he regarded Harry with scrutiny. "Are you sure?"
It did not take long for Harry to silently slip into the world of dreams yet again. Draco was glad he had been present for the brief period that Harry was awake. It was a rare occurrence these days. He gently eased Harry back onto the pillows, drawing the blankets high up around his chin and pressed a kiss to his mouth. He took the book and placed it on Harry's bedside cabinet along with the column of photo's. It would make Harry smile when he woke up. He walked over to the door, his gaze lingering on his lover's sleeping form before walking out into the sterile corridors.
Opening his eyes he was greeted with the sight of dark grey clouds shading the horizon and a curtain of rain spilling down against the window. He grimaced at the ache blooming in his chest. He could feel a stiffness creep into his knees and wanted nothing more than to stoke a fire and curl up in front of it with a blanket tucked around him. He had never felt as old as he did at that moment. He blew warm air onto his hands and rubbed them down his face before taking out another letter from inside his satchel. He slipped it out of the envelope and held it a little closer to read in the dimming light.
He needed to be there for when Harry woke up -he needed to be the friendly face in a foreign land of white-washed walls and disinfectant.
Draco ground his teeth together and slowly moved himself back before sliding in again. He slowly started to thrust his hips in a slow rhythm. Harry's panting spurred him on as he quickened his pace, pleasure pooling in his stomach. It was blinding him. He wasn't going to last long but he didn't give a shit. He tried to calm his erratic thoughts to last a little longer. He rocked his hips even faster. "Harry!" he groaned out as the brunette moaned and arched into his thrusts, making them both spasm with pleasure. "Shit, I don't think I'm going to last long," he panted as he leaned over his lover, both of them glistening with sweat as they rocked together. He inhaled Harry's musky scent and pressed burning, sloppy kisses to the other's damp neck and forehead. "Ah, I love you! I fucking love you!"
As Draco returned to placing a few cautionary jumpers in one of the bags, Harry caught the sleeve of his hoodie, making Draco stop mid-motion. Draco looked down at his lover with soft, concerned eyes. He stroked a finger down Harry's cheek, "what's bothering you, love?" he asked in a soft, forcibly controlled voice. Hermione had shaken him that much was clear. When Harry did not immediately speak, he settled himself on the bed, the mattress dipping under his weight, and pulled Harry to his chest with a protective arm, the pile of jumpers forgotten for the moment. "Hm?"
Draco smirked, peering over his shoulder. Two bright green eyes teased him from under a black wind-swept fringe. "You're not bad," he smirked. "You're just lazy." A firm hand smacked his backside. He leaned down and pressed a chaste kiss to Harry's mouth. "Now, are you going to let me get out of these stiff clothes and into something more comfortable?"
"Draco you know it doesn't work like that," Harry sighed in an exasperated manner, "I can't just hand over an entire hospital to someone."
Draco reached out just as Harry was taking his temperature and slipped his long pale fingers around Harry's wrist and in a sober voice he murmured, "I believe you can do it."
A jolt shot up his spine. Children. It was a subject he had side-stepped when they had eventually adopted Seeker, and it had not been mentioned since. He was not even sure if Harry wanted children anymore. He watched the small bubbles floating downwards in the air and drew in a deep breath -and stopped short. He could not ask Harry that. Not now, at least. First he needed to focus on a weekend away in the sunshine for the both of them.
"No, baby, it's not bad. You deserve a holiday after being cooped up for so long" Draco crooned softly, as Seeker padded up, his ears and tail drooping as he placed his muzzle on Harry's lap. Harry allowed his hands to automatically bury itself within the golden fur. Draco rocked back and forth until Harry sniffled and coughed and wiped at his eyes.
In the corner of the room there now stood a green fir tree that was adorned with silver and pale gold ornaments, twinkling with small fairy lights complete with a glittering star on the top of it. It was beautiful and cheerful and bright in the room, yet subtle in the soft hues around them. Harry took another sip of his butterbeer before sighing contently, "Happy first Christmas Draco."
"I'm glad you're enjoying it," Draco beamed as Harry licked the last droplet of chocolate sauce off of his fork and sighed contently. Draco signaled for the waitress to bring their bill over so that they could pay and leave. The waitress came over and took the money Draco handed her -it was not so that he looked like a big-shot but it was because Draco had never gotten used to those muggle contraptions that Harry had called 'pin-machines' for 'credit cards'. Harry smiled, the same thought clearly running through his mind as the waitress printed them off a receipt and a copy of their bill, before flushing gratefully at the large tip that Draco handed over to her.
"So where are you taking me Mister Money-bags?" Harry asked with a teasing smile, as they walked casually up the high street, his arm wound around Draco's waist.
Draco was not convinced but he tried not to show it as he turned the key in the ignition. He had been doing everything right. He'd gotten Harry to have more exercise, and some descent food along with his vile medication -and yet there was something that was a little off with his fiancé. He just couldn't put his finger on it.
For his part Harry felt such great relief that he had been able to aid in Draco's good health and found studying and working on his personal assignment almost 'fun'. He enjoyed it and the research was lodged in his brain from having reiterated to Draco two weekends in a row. Not that he cared. He loved to spend time with Draco and travelling to Paris was a nice change of scenery from Calais, especially the hospital and his gloomy little room.
A firm hand grasped on Harry's shoulder and the warm weight was comforting in a strange sort of way, "I'll tell him, Harry. He does too, you know," he murmured softly before he released his grip on his protégées shoulder and then drifted out of the room.
With a lot of whining, Harry dragged himself out of his lover, to the edge of the bed and almost dropped full-body on the floor. He caught himself just beforehand with a grunt. Draco was lying sprawled out on the bed. On wobbly legs, the brunette man padded heavily over to the bathroom and unrolled half a roll of toilet paper to wipe the cum off his chest and stomach. He shivered as the cool air snaked around his ankles and he had to brace himself on the sink before slowly taking the used condom off.
," she stressed the word, "were whispering behind his back and charming his ink well to spray all over his work and his shirt! They even spelled 'HEX ME' to weave into the wool of his jumper! It won't come off! I tried countering it for him but he just told me to leave it alone and stalked out of the lesson early. Honestly, I thought after what had happened everyone would be a little more mature about this."
Harry wasn't asleep but rather, he was reading by the light of an oil-lamp on the bedside table, his body propped up on a small mountain of pillows. When his door clicked open and Draco slipped in as quietly as possible, the younger man lazily drew his eyes away from his reading material to look up at his 'husband'. He frowned heavily, since it was rare that Draco would be the one to sneak out of his bedchamber to his. "Draco? What are you doing up so late? I thought you were already asleep."
Draco sneered and started hurling more spells at him; stinging hexes, the jelly leg curse, freezing him mid-shout, he even tried '
That was when he had started noticing some strange things happening, and he wasn't entirely sure if it was part of a prank or not. He still needed to decide how to approach it, if at all.
"People's lives would be at stake and I wouldn't be able to relax properly knowing that I could have been the cause of that."
Draco shook his head, "No, actually, he is my godfather. He did use to teach me potions before I was accepted to Beauxbatons School. So how long have you been studying underneath him?"
It had been a long day bent over several cauldrons, completing orders for the Ministry and restocking the supply cabinet for local small malady healers. It wasn't always steady money but it helped him break even with the bills, and that was all his pride needed. Groaning, he rubbed his forehead. He had been feeling jittery all day and inhaling noxious fumes all day had only heightened that itchiness.
Harry narrowed his eyes a little and found himself straightening up to his fall height which still onto put him eye level with Draco's pointed chin, "Mister Malfoy the world of healing potions in changing as we speak. Every day more people are finding new uses for various ingredients and making more and more cures, and you are standing there in all your finery as though you have given up and are just waiting for the right time to die!" he hissed out the last part out, not wanting to draw attention to the both of them.
Running his fingers through Harry's silky black hair, he eased himself against from the other boys face and tugged him up onto his feet. Both panting, he spun Harry around and bent him over the desk, "Are you ready for me to open your Chamber of Secrets?" he purred as ran his length against the cleft of Harry's arse.
The water was hot and beautiful against his skin as he lathered shampoo into his hair and massaged his scalp to rid all the salty sea-air from his body. He sighed softly as he scrubbed at his skin and massaged his aching muscles with some Radox. If his father could see him now -he would die of sheer shock! The thought made Draco smile and then exhale a strangled choke in less that two seconds. He shouldn't think about 'death' or 'dying'. If he did he would start to think the worst and he could not do that.
"Draco, I know that the two of you are hardly seeing eye-to-eye at the moment, but if he is going to get back to interacting properly with people then he needs to start somewhere. You're the only person he is close to and I'd advise you to stop scowling. You'll ruin your face looking like that." He'd stated the irritability clear in his voice despite how controlled he kept it.
"Malfoy just let me help," Potter stated in an exasperated manner. "You don't want to wear that. It's far too rough."
"Wet-wipes on the bedside table, for one. A towel to clean up with, so that next time you don't have to drag your sore little dick to the bathroom and -maybe something to give a little energy boost, if muggles even have that sort of thing."
Here came those tears again. Damn them! Draco nodded his head and let out a shaky breath, "who would believe it, Harry? I'm still regarded as a former death-eater, remember? The only reason I'm allowed to brew potions at all is because of how good my grades were and because I had the best potions master in the world as my tutor."
Draco could still remember that day that they'd walked along the Seine on the second summer of them living together and had visited his parents for a couple of weeks. It had rained heavily on a casual trip strolling through the Parisian streets and they'd had to use Draco's satchel as a cover for the both of them as they'd hurried to duck under a nearby tree for a poor excuse of shelter. It was one of the sweet little moments that he treasured throughout the rest of that summer, and he stole every chance he got to touch Harry. They'd had to be careful around the manor, although one time as they were eating in the dining hall, Harry had slipped his foot out of his shoe and stroked Draco in a few places he didn't think were at all appropriate to touch under a dinner table, especially when he spluttered his wine down his front and choked a couple of times into his napkin. His father had scowled at him and his mother and tutted with a shake of her head. Draco had glared at Harry across the table but the younger man had merely smirked over at him mischievously.
Draco nodded his head, his tongue suddenly sticking to the roof of his mouth. "Y-Yes, I wanted to know if you were doing anything this weekend?"
Harry mentally counted to ten before forcing the shirt into Draco's stomach where, thankfully, his hands automatically came up to grab it. He reached over and swiped up Draco's shirt from the sink, flapped it open and charmed it dry, before slipping it on over his chest, squirming a little in discomfort. "I'll give it back when I can," he stated before pulling his grey jumper back on over his head and quickly leaving the bathroom.
'. "Shoot," she pouted, "I'm late for meeting Blaise. Here, can you give this to him?" she help out a small smoked glass phial to him.
Completely unaware about what his friends were up to every night for the last three weeks, Draco went about his days in a somewhat bored fashion. It was all the same; breakfast, lessons, lunch, lessons, dinner, repeat. The only thing that would really break up the mundane cycle was whenever he would get a letter from his mother or if he would be sent a note from Harry during one of their classes, asking to meet him in the Room of Requirement after curfew. Since the Christmas Holidays, Granger and Weasley had been turning a blind eye to Harry whenever he disappeared during the night. They still supervised sometimes, and had even been getting along better with Draco as well, which he secretly felt proud over.
To Harry's surprise it didn't take long for Severus to be convinced that it would be a wonderful opportunity for the young apprentice to broaden his horizons and gain some extra knowledge of the apothecaries and tradesmen in Paris. Considering the progress Harry had made Severus had insisted that he take another day off in his week, so that he had a three-day weekend every week, for him to travel back and forth between Calais and Paris by coach as long as he studied frivolously for his exams in late June. Harry promised that he would and Lucius gave his condition that Harry were to come to the manor the following day to begin his readings to his son, and attend the final day of the function the following evening together.
Draco swallowed. This wasn't going the way he'd planned. He cleared his throat and drew in a few deep breaths to calm his rattling nerves. "Let's try this again, shall we?" he stated in a tight voice, "Pot -
Three hours later he was forced back into the world of reality by dry hands sharply smacking him across the face and a deafening scream vibrating through his skull. It wasn't until he was more awake did he realise that the screaming was coming from him. After one final slap he felt the scream die in his throat and slowly began to feel the rest of his body awaken. He was drenched in his own sweat and the sky was darkening outside. He felt his body spasm as he rolled over the edge of the bed and dry heaved. His neck muscles strained and he could feel the evening breeze chill the sweat over his body. Nothing came up his throat, despite the burning sensation, and he felt a hot hand pounding his back until he'd stopped gagging on his own saliva and curled up onto his side, tucking his throbbing head between his arms. He swallowed and tried to get his breathing steady again. He swallowed and tried to get his breathing steady again. "Harry what the hell is going on?" Severus snapped as he whipped away from the bed and bent low beside the balcony door and picked up the discarded phial. "You took dreamless sleep?" he asked as he sniffed the empty phial. His dark eyes fastened on Harry slumped over in the bed on his side, his skin waxy and his eyes red and bloodshot. "You stupid fool!" he spat out, throwing the phial out of the window. "I told you to get some proper rest, not delude your body! That potion will only make you worse! You need natural sleep you moron! I can't believe I even trained you up to be a healer when you can't even see that you're endangering yourself and all the patients in your care!" He was snarling now but he didn't care. The satisfaction he was getting from seeing the younger man flinch and cower at his words was only too gratifying. He strode over and loomed over the shattered man before him and sneered, "And what about Draco, Potter?" he spat out, "Do you regard him so lowly that you would rather kill him than admit to yourself and to me, that you're not well?"
Draco rolled his eyes with a soft smirk, "I don't think so. Severus did explain about how the boundaries could easily be blurred to either one of us and we needed to take precautions to keep them in place. Although I don't mind when you do take care of me for silly little things like a fever or something. I like that you're attentive when I'm ill."
There really wasn't much else he could possibly say against something as monumental as that, so he had let his wand-arm drop down to his side and breathed deeply, as what he had just said sank in through the angry haze inside Harry's head. He had tried to edge across the room, as though he were approaching an easily spooked unicorn. Harry had bolted anyway, muttering apologies and having tears running down his face that was white with shock. He had fled the room before Draco even had a chance to say anything to him.
Hermione's mouth snapped shut and Draco felt a wave or superiority over-come him. She knew he was right -everyone who had been in their generation at Hogwarts knew he was right. Hermione's cheeks flared pink as she struggled to find a retort against his thinking. Draco smirked darkly at her. She glowered at him, her fingers curled into fists, "Take him back there, Draco! Or I swear to Merlin I will take you to court!"
He was almost grateful to skulk down to the dungeons after dessert -not that he ate any -and seclude himself within the thick green curtains hanging around his bed. He curled up in his pyjamas and cast warming charms on the blankets and pillows, his feet already turning paler with the cold, and cast silencing charms on the curtains. As he curled up on his side and burrowed under the blankets, his eyes wide open he couldn't disregard the chill and hushed whispers that greeted him when his dorm-mates entered for bed a few hours later. He didn't listen to them and he was grateful for the silencing charms he'd put up. At least none of them would get disturbed from his nightmares.
A pressure that felt like a dragon's egg collided heavily into his chest. Bright white light flashed momentarily in his eyes. Water surged through his gullet and poured out his nose and bubbled up at the back of his throat. The pressure pummelled into his chest once again, and he felt his skull crashing back down onto something rough and hard. The world seemed to spin and water poured out of his throat and made more room for air to surf down his nose. Colour swam in spots before his eyes before settling into blurred shapes stretching far and wide. His lungs soaked up as much air as possible and his stomach unwound itself from the knot it had been twisting in. He pressed his mouth against what felt like wet wood and inhaled stiffly before his forced his head up.
Draco glared mockingly. They were as stubborn as each other. Grabbing the front of Harry's shirt, he seethed; "Fuck me into the mattress, Wonder boy!" before crushing their mouths in a rough kiss.
Harry breathed through a smile and leaned a little closer to the blonde. Now that there were no eyes, it was easier to feel relaxed with the older man. He couldn't deny the way his stomach flipped when they were together, and in recent meet-ups in the Room of Requirement there had been a tension thrumming in the air between them. A tension that surged through him and made him ...
He was simply left staring at the space where Harry had been standing. The problem with that was, he had actually seen what Harry meant when he said that he'd died. It was something he lost control over in such an emotional state. He was a skilled Occlumens -he'd had to be, staying in the same house as the Dark Lord -and he'd gotten a very brief flash of what Harry had witnessed upon 'dying'. It hadn't been an image per say, just a flash of whiteness and a platform, but the emptiness and loneliness he'd felt in waves was almost crippling. He'd then been completely overwhelmed with the turmoil he'd felt soaring out of Harry right before the connection between them had been broken.
Draco rolled his head to look down, his cheeks flushed and his eyes heavy lidded. He stroked Harry's cheek, "Let me make love to you, Harry. Let me show you just how much I love you."
to look back –dear Merlin he wanted to look back at the man he'd loved with all his heart –but he couldn't. He felt nothing but disgust at the rejection that was now slathered over him like bile. Instead of looking back around, he simply carried on through the door, along the winding corridors and back to his own bedchamber. He knew Harry wasn't going to bother himself with removing himself from his bed and hurrying after him, but that didn't mean that his chest didn't ache as he unconsciously stayed up for another hour and a half, curled around a plump pillow and slow hot tears running down his cheeks.
"Like our relationship you mean?" Harry muttered, a dark shadow passing over his face as he turned his face away from Draco's.
He was not repulsed by Harry's appearance. The only thing it did was sadden him to unbearable levels.
Severus inclined his head, "I know that it isn't easy, Harry. And yes, in some cases you may have done more harm than good but as far as I've seen in your records –yes, I've been checking up on you –but so far the only thing that has happened that may come back to haunt you is that you used scourgify on a couple of beds giving a large number of patients a rash, that you then later helped to cure with a strong dosage of your salve so … No, somehow you've managed to stay on top of most things. How you're managing that I'm not sure, but I think you're going to snap soon Harry. I don't know when, and I don't know how. But it will be soon, and you need to be careful. That's why I wanted you to come here for the two weeks. I want you to talk to me, or Draco, or someone. Come to me and talk if you're feeling scared, because I can see it in your eyes, Harry. I know you're scared." He leaned forward in his chair and bore his eyes into Harry, "Let me help you, Harry. I've been helping Draco and he's working through some things. Your negligence of his affections and even simply his attention and general conversation almost tipped him over the edge into depression, but I managed to get to him in time."
Harry nodded and watched as the blonde turned and started to descend the stairs. "Draco!" he called out, not wanting the night to be over, not yet. The blonde looked back up at him with a frown, "I er ... I hope you sleep well."
When Potter finally did emerge, it was in a loose grey shirt, baggy bottoms, dressing gown and a towel wrapped around something large and rounded in the crook of his arm. Was that the golden egg he'd gotten from the dragon? Why did he need to bathe the bloody thing?
However, now it would appear that said cause for Draco's own happiness was suffering and there didn't seem to be anything he could readily do to help him.
Draco seemed to listen to the words, his expression never wavering as he soaked it in. He lowered his eyes and seemed to take a deep breathe, "I can't forgive you for this, Harry –"
"I know," Draco stated kissing Harry's nose, "but I want to." Harry was left with a small blush kissing his cheeks as Draco sauntered off down the hallway, a new spring of hope in his step, as he made his way towards the bathroom.
"You're Harry fucking Potter. You're going to come out of it." He raked a hand through his blonde hair, trying not to let any of his emotions show. He was anxious and worried but he couldn't show Harry that. He flinched a little when Harry reached over and pressed a gentle kiss to his cheek.
The blonde man scowled as he had shifted in the chaise lounge he was in, "I'm not in the mood to talk to him, Severus. I can't forgive him for what he's done."
Five little photo's stared up at him; the first one was of him with Harry's arms around his neck, the second was of his kissing a blushing Harry's cheeks. The third one had a small Seeker's ears hopping up in the side of the frame; the fourth had Seeker leaping onto their laps, tail wiggling. And the fifth was a close-up of Seeker admiring the enclosed camera lens.
A sore lump rose in his throat, not for the first time day, as his eyes fell upon the chair. It had sat in the exact same spot since they had first moved into the apartment, together, even when they had redecorated several times he refused to move the chair from its position. Looking back on it now perhaps he had been a little too stubborn. Dropping his leather jacket on to the wooden floors underfoot –the silver zip clattering on the floor –he slowly glided over into the living room. He felt rather phantom-like of late. There was no substance to him or his way of living. The only company he could stand these days was their dog.
"I understand that Lord Malfoy but I do not believe I was deceiving your son. Potions and medicine have developed at such an alarming rate recently that I do believe, given some more time, there will be something to at the very least ease your sons discomfort and to perhaps give him a better quality of life." He paused and licked his lips, "I assume that is why he isn't here tonight. Did he take ill since last night?"
As he opened the driver's door and slid inside rather awkwardly, he vaguely registered that Harry was awake and staring bleary-eyed at his lap. Draco closed the door with a 'clunk' and deposited the food and drinks in the cup-holders and placed the bag on Harry's lap. He reached over and stroked his fingers through Harry's hair, forcing the younger man to blink wearily and smile as he turned his cheek into his lover's warm palm. "You okay, love?" Draco asked softly, his brow furrowed with concern.
Two lightly tanned arms wrapped around his waist. A firm weight pressed against his back and, at last, he felt the last of the dress melt off his shoulders. "Now, if Snape looked nearly as hot as you do, I doubt I'd be as bad at potions as I am."
Harry groaned and shook his head back and forth. "No, there is no calming down!" he snapped. Even though he ached and burned with a fiery rage, he felt his body weaken at Draco's firm assuring touch. Draco was cool, calm and real. He grounded him and it felt refreshing to have something solid to focus on after the months of dark nights where he slept alone, the fear of never waking up rolling through his skull like thunderous clouds.
Draco huffed in annoyance and swiped a handkerchief from his top pocket and swiped it across his brow. "Fine," he huffed waving his hand at Harry, "Read if you must but I can't promise to pay attention to you."
Draco sighed inwardly, the sky seeming drearier now. He was in constant denial of late and he loathed himself for it. He gripped the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles flashing white. He let out a shaky breath, tears prickling his eyes. He coughed stiffly and continued along the motorway the blood draining from his hands and face. He drove past a sign.
The lake water seemed to darken around him, as though something had swallowed the sun up. Draco's weight was becoming far too much of a strain as he fought to keep them away from the lakebed. He felt his head grow hot again but there would be no point in crying underwater. He didn't realise it immediately when he felt Draco's limp ghostly body slide out from under his arm and slowly began sinking back down into the darkening depths below. Harry wanted to cry out and reach down for him but he had no air left, no adrenaline fuelled fire in his muscles to keep him from sinking too. He tried to fight the darkness clouding in around him but it swarmed closer, clawing at him as stars filled his vision and he gradually lost feeling in his toes and fingers. His heart was erratic and becoming muffled in his ears as he felt his body grow heavy and slide further through the dark blue-grey water. His chest felt as though it was being crushed through a great amount of pressure, making it uncomfortable and suffocating as his eyelids blinked shut against the panic, the pain and the ghostly pale man drifting far below him no doubt never to be seen again.
"I'm more than willing," Draco breathed out in his deepening, raw voice. Harry felt a shiver run down his spine and the hairs on the back of his neck stood up on end.
Draco faltered. There was no real way to respond to that without coming off as an optimistic arsehole. He shuddered and tilted his head back against the stone, "I don't know Harry but maybe the reason you're feeling so trapped is because you're back here, where it all started and where it all went wrong. You're seeing both the empty spaces of students and teachers who died and yet at the same time you're seeing new first years coming here for the first time. You're seeing their joy and optimism and you're wondering if Hogwarts will ever hold that for you again. Am I right?"
"Yes you did," the older man continued steadily, "You lost sight of the distinctions between work and life. You forgot where work-Harry ends at the end of his shifts, and where home-Harry is when you get back to your apartment, and by extension you made Draco worry. You have deadened almost any psychological emotion inside your mind and you need to take the time away from everyone and everything. I believe if we take this one step at a time you will get better." He leaned forward in his chair, "I do believe that you can get better Harry, or I will die trying. Bearing in mind I will come back and harass you until you do."
As they lapsed into silence a hum ran through the room and something sparkled in the corner of the room. Harry turned to look and smiled at what he saw. He nudged Draco's foot with his own and pointed over to the corner, "Hey Draco, look what the room's given us for Christmas."
His bed was calling to him and he was desperate to answer that call after such a long horrible day. He wanted to change into warm, dry clothes and curl up with a book in front of the small fireplace in the lounge area of his apartment. He took his pocket watch out of his waistcoat pocket and grimaced at the time. He hadn't realised how late it had gotten but then it did make sense with how dark the sky had gotten so quickly. As the wheels creaked and chattered along the cobblestone road, he felt his fingers itch to slip another letter out of his satchel and read it to take his mind off the long journey still to be had. He finally sighed and berated himself as he dug around in his satchel and unfolded a letter out, peering closely to see it in the blooming light of the streetlamps. He swallowed thickly and began to read.
He spared a glance over at Harry and felt a sympathetic smile crawl onto his mouth; Harry was wearing a purple t-shirt and threadbare jeans with a pair of worn converses and a black skull-cap on his head. Draco had to admit, he missed Harry's ambush of untamable raven locks. They were feather soft to the touch, but you would never think that upon first glance.
He did his utmost best to ignore the catcalls from the other houses when they welcomed their new members. He tried not to let his eyes run over the Golden Trio sitting there, looking a little haggard at best, but still together and sharing in everyone else's enjoyment. He hated how easy it was for them, even the weaslette was getting it easy, being the hero-worshiper she blatantly was, was lapping up the attention that rebounded off of her brother and Potter and onto her.
Drawing in a deep breath, he poured the contents of the box out onto the empty desk and began sifting through them, organizing them by year, then month and at last official chronological dates. He was almost ashamed to admit that he'd forgotten he'd had the letters stashed away at the Manor. It had been such a long time ago it barely registered in his mind except for the dark days when he was forced to remain in bed with weak broth and hot tea with a cold flannel over his forehead and salve rubbed into his chest every hour. He loathed those days but Severus had taught him how to cope, even in the worst case scenarios. Once all the letters were organized into a neat pile, he cut off a length of twine, bound them together in small bundles and placed them neatly in his leather satchel before levitating yet another empty box into the fireplace. With a sigh he looked around his father's study, a knot forming in his chest and making him wheeze weakly into a handkerchief. He didn't want to leave it, not just yet. He forever counted his blessings that his father hadn't seen him as a waste of time like most other purebloods did to the '
His mother and father had simply been delighted to know that he seemed to be getting better, although they were warned by Severus that they were still a long way off from finding a lasting cure.
As he left the Entrance Hall and made his way along a hallway. He'd just turned a corner and yelped in surprise when a hand snatched his robes and dragged him along into one of the many alcoves dotted about. "Unhand me Potter!" he griped as he jerked his robes free.
"What –What happened to Draco?" he managed to rasp out, not daring to look at his old mentor for fear of the bone-crushing disgust no doubt evident in his eyes. He didn't know why he asked. It would torture him to know but if he didn't, it would merely suspend the impact when he eventually found out.
He hadn't told Draco. He'd barely written anything to the blonde man in the last month. He felt guilty about it, like he had abandoned the young master, but he couldn't help himself. The only thing he had sent was more bath oils, potions and salves in a one-off package that would last him a month.
Harry swatted his chest. "Behave, or I'll dump this on your face." Draco scowled but didn't say another word. "Does it hurt?" he asked somewhat cautiously, as he finished drying up the damp patches with the left over tissue.
Draco was left alone with his thoughts, his wand twirling between his fingers underneath the blanket that was draped around his body. The chilled air began skirting it's way over the wooden floorboards and chilled his bare feet. He started thinking about what to write. It was Harry's life, should he not be the one to do it? But then Harry had asked him to do it. He clenched his wand with both hands and tried vainly to bend it, however as his wand was so unbearably flexible it merely curved under the pressure and eased back into its original posture once he released one end of it.
For days he had been awake all night and had debated on whether or not to go to the Room of Requirement. Not for anything in particular but just to see if anything remained. That moment had cinched the night for him, for the fear to spike. When he had watched Potter's broom turned around he had never felt so happy to see that scar-headed git's face, and probably never would again. It wasn't like all of that could be cast aside anyway. There was too much there for them to get past, not that he was even sure he wanted to. If the room had any magic left he wanted to use that magic to take him away for a little while, to a place where he didn't feel ashamed and didn't get people spitting onto the back of his robes or his shoes.
Every now again he sighed to himself and leaned this way and that, his eyes never straying from the horizon that glimmered with the promise of a clear night sky.
"Alright, well I'll be right back. I'm just going in to McDonald's. Do you want your usual order?" he asked as he frantically unfastened his seat-belt and made sure that he had enough muggle money in his wallet. Harry merely nodded his head once again, and shifted in his seat to get more comfortable. Draco did his best not to fret over Harry as he entered the florescent restaurant, his left hand often fingering his jean pocket to make sure that his wallet was still confined within. The line seemed to take forever as he shifted gradually closer to the counter to be served. As soon as he had ordered and paid, he quickly turned and departed from the building and towards the car.
To that it had been awkward to begin with would be like telling someone that plants needed both sunlight and water to flourish. They had sat across from one another sharing small smiles and averting their eyes from one another. They were observing one another in each of those little glances, as though trying to assess how mentally stable the other person was before engaging them in conversation. It was almost as though they were perfect strangers to one another. Finally it was Harry who had decided to break the silence, "Would you like to accompany on a walk across Severus' gardens, Draco?" he asked rather formally, a wide smile still on his pink lips, "He's become quite the horticulturist since I was here last summer."
"Not at all. I trust your judgement." It had been an odd thing to say but after weeks of correspondence and weekend visits he honestly did trust the brunette man before him. Besides, he couldn't lie to Draco worth a damn. Then again, he was cunning in that sense; always being honest with those around still left people questioning him though they had no proof against him. "You're going to make a wonderful healer one day, Harry. I can literally tell you right here and now that you will be a world class healer but the time you're my age."
Draco glanced into the bag and accepted the hot-water bottles, his stomach flip-flopping as he did so. "Th-thank you Cass. I really appreciate it."
Draco shrugged, "we might as well try somewhere new, and the beaches appear far sandier than the ones down in Brighton."
Draco blinked through his staring state and righted himself in his chair, "Not at all. I actually found it quite interesting. You have a talent for speaking out, Mister Potter. But I do tire from listening to all this medical jargon. Would you like to discuss something else? I'd be most obliged if you do."
Draco shook his head, "I never thought you would allow me to do anything more than touch you and kiss you. I'm just as surprised as you are, believe me, but I don't regret one moment of it," he murmured softly as he tilted his chin and pressed a tender if hesitant kiss to Harry's forehead. He couldn't help but smile and blink away happy tears when he felt Harry wrap arm around his waist and draw their bodies closer together. "I never thought I'd get to see you like this again after your letters stopped. I had hoped you'd have written a letter and secreted it in that little care package you sent, but when I saw there was nothing I felt broken inside. Like something wasn't quite right with me."
Harry returned the smile, looking radiant as he did so, "Much better. And I am now all cum-free for the evening," Draco chuckled as Harry bared his body, the towel pooling around his feet. He clapped and grinned as Harry grabbed a pair of boxer-shorts and gently slid into the bed alongside his partner. Draco looped his arms around Harry and pressed a kiss to the bald head now nuzzled against his chest. "So what are we watching? Crap?"
Without saying a word the younger man shifted down onto one knee and pulled out a little box from the pocket in his trousers. Draco felt everything inside him tighten up. His body flushed with heat and his stomach flipped uncontrollably as he watched the lid of the box slide back to reveal a little gold ring. It was so hot all of a sudden that breathing was becoming almost too difficult. He clenched his fingers into fists and drew in long shuddering breaths to calm his racing heartbeat. "Draco," Harry smiled softly, his green eyes glimmering in the candlelight, "I have rehearsed this so many times in the last few weeks but nothing ever seemed good enough to say to you. So all I can do is ask; will you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, do me the honour of being my husband? To let me love you and hold you and accept every last inch of you the way that you have done with me? I know we cannot be the conventional marital couple, but even if it's in the privacy of our own home, I want you to be my husband, I want you to be mine and no one else's. I want you to love me as much as I love you. This ring is as close to married as either one can get. I want you to be mine. Every last breath in your body, I want to be mine and I, yours. Let me love you. Let us be as married as we can be and live as happily as we have been."
He took a while before he inhaled deeply, the tremors fading slightly. Harry did not relinquish his soothing caresses, for which Draco was immensely grateful. He reveled in the sandy smell that clung to Harry's shirt and the warmth that clung to his lover's soft, smooth skin.
With a mischievous glint in his eye, Potter jerked Draco's hand away from his dick and sauntered back towards the Gryffindor Tower. It had been a long night.
Harry had fallen asleep in the Passenger seat a while ago, as had Seeker in the backseat, his paw dangling just over the seats edge, the sunlight catching in his golden fur. The car was peaceful as a radio station playing out the muggle top hits of the week softly into the atmosphere around them. The traffic had not been too bad and Draco prayed that the good weather would last for the remainder of the long weekend. He hadn't stirred up just a fuss for them to be cooped up in a hotel room for a few days.
His skin looked so pale, like the starched sheets he was lying chemotherapy had removed all signs of hair from his face and head -no unruly mop of black hair, no 5 o'clock shadow, no eyebrows either. Just an unnaturally bald head that made the lightning bolt scar on his forehead loom bold and devilishly red against the pale canvas of his lovers skin.
Draco pursed his lips together in thought. How long had it been going on? He wasn't too sure because at first it had only been a couple of nights a week and he could easily brush that to the back of his mind, or simply explain it away, as Harry had done. When he first did notice it, it was virtually too late anyway. By that point Harry only came home 'early' on two nights a week. Not too long after that it had gotten later and later until he just didn't bother coming home until Draco was asleep. It had gotten rather lonely; falling asleep alone before Harry got home and waking up alone when Harry had scurried off to work, earlier and earlier every morning until Draco calculated that he only got around four hours of sleep at night. Did he take nap breaks at the hospital? He must have done, otherwise by any logical means he would have had a breakdown by now. Clearing his throat he mumbled, "A couple of months, I think."
Draco waved his hand dismissively, "For now mother is going to live in it but it's entirely up to her as to whether it will become her permanent residence, or if she decides to sell it and let it go to another pureblood family. Or even be converted into a hotel. At this point I think she is still a little too numb with grief to think properly."
It was later that same day after Charms that Potter caught him and gave him a rough jerk on the shoulder. Draco scowled down at him and adopted his haughtiest look, hoping to strike some fear into the brunette, however the only thing he saw in those green eyes was anger. Potter leaned closer and hissed close to Draco's ear, "I can make you scream louder than a mandrake."
Draco's hands instinctively came up to scratch lightly at the soft spot underneath Harry's neck. It made him smile and purr weakly light a cat. No one else knew about the sweet spot. "I love you too, Harry."
. He loved his father dearly for the love and pride he had for his family. Sometimes he was a little too pragmatic, but he did love them. That was the main thing about everything.
As if the 'Potter Stinks' badges weren't enough, Draco had decided that he desperately needed to rile Potter up more. He needed to get under the boys' skin and stay there. His plan was ingenious, of course everything out of his head was. He was Draco Malfoy after all.
By the time he had finished and went to wait in the Entrance Hall he was getting a little anxious until Draco stepped up next to him, "Hey Harry can you wait a moment? I need to go and try to speak to Slughorn about something for next lesson. You don't mind waiting do you?" he asked, his pale cheeks flushed pink.
Harry smiled softly and then looked over into the fire without really seeing it, "I know what you mean. The tone of your letters was more open after that letter I sent to you. It was like you were opening up to me again. It made me feel so much happier for the first time in months."
"How are you feeling?" Draco's toneless voice resounded in his ears as he continued to stroke the hair out of Harry's closed eyes.
However, when he looked at Draco as they wandered from shop-to-shop he knew he was falling for the blonde, and falling incredibly fast. He couldn't help but wonder if the older man felt the same way or not. He hoped so. But he wasn't going to put his feelings on the line and risk their friendship for some unrequited love nonsense. He was a big boy and he learned from his mistakes.
A devilish smirk crawled onto Draco's mouth as he looped his arms around Harry's neck, his stomach flipping when he saw the excitable gleam in those green eyes. "Maybe. Would you like that?"
What he saw on the other side of the door brought fresh tears to his eyes and made his stomach knot in a pleasant manner; tinsel was draped in silver and red and green strands around the smaller area of the room, and adorned the fireplace. Candles stood in small clumps on a few battered old tables in a couple of areas and a large, plush rug had been dragged into the room in front of the fire. Harry sniffed and rubbed at the back of his neck as the door closed behind him.
about time away with one another. He stabbed at his fruit and ripped it off his fork with his teeth. He didn't even look up at Harry sitting across from him. He couldn't. He was scared that if he did, his heart would stop in his chest and break. Harry was the one who spoke up in answer to Narcissa, "Unfortunately, I don't think I will be able to make it. August it an active time for children and there seems to be more crimes. I have a feeling that I'd be stuck in at the hospital all month."
He had managed the other small things on his own. The sandwiches had been easy and since it was for a descendant of 'the Noble house of Black', Kreacher had been more than happy to order the other house-elves around, not that they would have objected anyway. He was almost glad that Ron and Hermione had gone away that morning, so that they didn't see the stupid grin that spread over his face.
He had not expected to be awoken to the blinding red lights filtering in through the living room window.
They stood in silence for a little while before Draco spoke up, "Well there is something that might be able to help. If you're willing to help." He spoke low, and softly, his voice making Harry shiver with both relief and trepidation.
The train creaked along the rails and with a cursory glance out of the window; Draco noted that he was only two stations away from where he needed to climb off. He couldn't wait to get home to the warmth that he hoped would be welcoming him. In this blasted weather he honestly prayed that the timed charms he'd performed on the floors and furnishings would gently start to warm up within the next ten minutes. The place would feel almost Heavenly when he stepped inside, he was sure of it. He packed the letters away into his satchel, knowing only too well how they'd end as he rubbed his fingers against his temples and cleared his throat. He rubbed his hands together before slipping his gloves on. At long last the train pulled up into his station and he slipped his cloak around his neck, grasped his cane in one hand and his leather satchel in the other as he hobbled off the train, the creak in his knees making him wince a little. '
Harry's lips quirked a little before he ran a hand through his damp hair, "Is it wrong for me to admit that I'm glad you have a different healer?" he asked, sounding half-ashamed at the admission.
Harry didn't want to leave. He wanted to stay and be with the man he loved but he knew he couldn't. Draco would throw him out if he didn't leave, he could see it in his steely grey eyes. Feeling a weight pushing down in his chest, he reached over for the sealed envelope and pushed it down into his pocket before sparing one last longing look at the blonde man in the bed, before he brushed past the curtain and disappeared from the ward.
The letter had cut off there abruptly; a few ink splotches and clear smudged areas where tears had dripped into the writing made it difficult to discern if there had been another page or it Harry had merely shoved it in an envelope in his self-crazed stupor before letting the coachman post it for him. Up until that point that autumn, Draco had been refusing to reply to Harry, mostly because Severus had insisted that until Harry was better again he couldn't speak to Draco in any way. Although, Draco had wondered how Harry was supposed to recover with only one person to talk to on a daily basis. He had written to Severus and discussed things at great length with him the following week when the older man had come to visit, of course he didn't divulge that Harry had written to him, he had merely stated his curiosity and subtly brought up possibly starting a correspondence. Severus had insisted that he would consider it but since Christmas and the lonely affair it had been even with the Ministry function hosted by the Lake District at Severus' house, he insisted that Harry's mental breakthrough was a long way off yet and that any means of trying to talk to him would be futile.
. Harry hesitated for a moment, at which point Draco had slumped back on his pillows, peering up through scrunched up eyelids. Finally, Harry sighed and disentangled himself from the wicker chair, dread filling every step. The two paces between the bed and the chair seemed to warp and lengthen to ten times the original size. He forced himself to put one foot in front of the other. In almost no time at all he was pressing his knees down into the mattress and turning around so that he felt the sleepy heat of Draco's chest and stomach pressing against his back. He curled his knees up and felt hot tears slide down his cheeks as he nestled his head in the crook of Draco's arm. He didn't sleep for the rest of the early hours of the morning, too afraid of what might happen. Instead he listened to the echoing throb of his 'husbands' heartbeat.
Draco smiled; feeling a little bit more relaxed. He could literally see the excitement bubbling up inside his boyfriend from across the kitchen table as he sipped at his wine."Only if you want to, there's no pressure and no rush. As soon as you say the word, we'll go looking for a puppy to adopt"
Draco followed his vision of Harry's fingers to his wrist and then up the dampened curve of his forearm until his eyes drank in the squared jaw and the stubbled chin and the tired yet bright green eyes, "Perhaps sometimes I wish to have a quiet conversation with my husband, instead of worrying about whether or not Severus is asleep at this hour." Harry gave a fleeting smile before his eyes drifted to the fireplace, a hairline frown appearing on his features. The man came around the edge of the armchair. Draco pried an eyelid open to look up at the sodden man before him and sighed, "Go and get changed. You look a fright."
Harry wished he had the energy to roll his eyes. "I don't want to talk about my nightmares. If I have to relive them whilst I'm conscious then I don't know how I'm going to deal with it. I don't even think I can write them down for you. They hurt too much to even think about. They frighten me so much, that if I tell you, I'm afraid you'll judge me."
personally. Harry closed his eyes before turning his head back to the fading sunlight. "There's something that I haven't told anyone about what happened in the forest that night and to be perfectly honest, talking about it out loud means that it's not some sort of dream I had. It makes it all too real. I'm ... I'm not sure I'm ready for that."
It was almost too true to state that by the time the Second Task had rolled around both Draco and Harry were actually looking forward to their cheesy chat-up line moments between classes and after meals.
He focused on listening to Harry's breathing in case he fell too ill. He didn't want Harry to relapse, not now. Not after such a lovely weekend with just the two of them and no one else -besides Seeker -to worry about. He slid up onto the bed and gently unbuttoned Harry's beautiful shirt and slipped it off of his thin body -the ribs and hipbones sticking up through his skin.
He couldn't relax throughout his bath until he was let out and allowed to dress in a nightshirt and a summer dressing robe that he cinched tightly around his waist and paced his room back and forth for a while, even going as far to as ignore the call for dinner. He told the maid that he wasn't feeling too hungry and the enquired as to how Draco was fairing up. The young maid bowed her head and stated that the young master was asleep now and seemed a little on the warm side. Harry slumped down in the armchair in his small bedchamber –one of the guest ones –and watched the clock as it ticked another half an hour of his life away before he felt as though the coast would be clear outside for him to creep along to Draco's bedchamber and check on him. He wanted to persuade himself that he was merely curious as a physician, but a sickly fear swelled in the back of his mind and he found himself holding his breath as he inched closer to Draco's door, knocked lightly, and then walked in uninvited.
Harry took a deep breath and decided to hedge around the subject. "It's just, since we all practically stared Death in the face, doing something as tedious as exams and looking for a job seem -well -so mundane and ordinary that I just want to scream if someone mentions them again."
!" he rasped painfully, wincing as his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth. He didn't believe his own words but he wasn't simply going to lie there and be insulted.
Despite Severus' words Harry didn't feel any better. He slept a little more than he had been and he was able to keep the older man's suspicions at bay for the most part. He forced himself to eat a little more despite how sickly he felt afterwards and he refused to go near any alcohol, even at dinner. He had been shaking with nerves and withdrawal for the first couple of days, but with nothing else to focus on except his own health. Severus for his part was making sure that Draco and Harry were spending as much time together without seeming too suspicious. At first Harry had simply thought it was coincidence, but the more time he spent with Draco the more the nightmares cropped up to the surface. Sometimes it simply got too much and he would run up to his bedchamber and lock the door behind him. He'd shake and whimper and scream into his pillow until his head was throbbing with red hot pain that it made him slip completely into his nightmare. It was a never ending cycle.
Draco rolled his eyes, "Do whatever you want, Weasley, but I for one, am going back to my bedroom to pack."
As soon as Draco was ready he grabbed a light jacket and opened the door for Harry to walk out. The staircase was a little narrow so the blond man followed his lover as they descended the four staircases to the lobby. Oli and Cass were looking after Seeker for the evening, for which they were thankful.
Harry blinked. He hadn't exactly been expecting such a response. He would have expected the need for more details, so why was Draco focusing on his age? "Um ... Yeah you know when my birthday was ... is."
Harry still seemed unsure but was placated a little when Draco leaned down and rested back on the pillow getting his breathing evened out before slipping his hand down between their bodies and entwined their fingers together. At Harry's quaking, he gave a reassuring squeeze and smiled softly. "Just relax Harry," he breathed as he finally felt his eyelids grow a little heavier and soon he had drifted off to sleep, the weight of Harry's body against his reassuring and soothing all at once.
As he brushed his teeth that morning, he ran a hand over the bristles now forming on his chin and around his mouth -he had not felt the need to shave recently. He did not want to end up getting wavering hands and slicing his jugular. Harry wouldn't appreciate bloodstains on the fluffy bath-mat on the floor. He dressed in a casual pair of jeans that did not cling onto his leg muscles too much, shrugged on a plain grey tee and threw on a random lumberjack-checked long-sleeve of the top. He was not in the mood to be ogled on the way there.
When he was finally able to clear his vision he came to the conclusion that everything in the universe -including his feet -hated him. He had unwittingly guided himself to the Girls' bathroom. He crashed through the door and hurried over to the sink and raked his jumper and shirt off over his head before trying to rinse them out under the harsh spray of the cold tap. The tears were flowing freely now and it ate him up inside as his head burned and throbbed from the inside out. He sniffed loudly and gasped for air as he rang his shirt so hard it scrunched up into a tight little ball. He threw it at the sinks with all his force and staggered a little. He looked at the room, the memories, the ghost of his blood running down the drain and the anger swelled inside him.
Dinner passed him by in much the same fashion as any of the other meals in the Great Hall. General chatter filled the air as did the scent of the beautifully cooked food.
Then came the sound that was so familiar to him; the panting of a lolling pink tongue, and the tapping of clawed feet trotting down the wooden floorboards that decorated their living room and hallway.
He'd need to brew a new batch of calming draught for himself but Harry ... Well, it would seem as though he wasn't the only one that needed to be reminded of Christmas.
The man raked a hand through his hair and responded with a slightly panting voice, "I didn't think I would be so late," he breathed out, his cheeks blotchy and cool from rushing about in the frigid air. His dark hair was plastered down and water dripped from the end of his nose, "I missed the train and had to run to get a coach. I'm sorry," he added soberly, "I honestly didn't expect it to upset you this much. Clearly I had misjudged how well you were handling things."
"Tell me what you want, Harry," Draco growled low in his throat, his hands simply itching to tug at the robes on the brunette's body and to touch his skin again. He wanted to feel Harry pressed down on top of him and to feel himself pressed against his leg. Not that he couldn't deny Harry's obvious arousal straining between them. "Tell me. What you. Want!" he ground out so forcefully and thrust against the brunette before Harry bumped his head back against the door and moaned out loud as his hands sprung up and clutched at Draco's robes.
"Honestly? I'm not entirely sure. Whoever treated you before left some very indecipherable notes so I've opted to start from scratch. I hope you don't mind," he added in a cautious voice, his bright green eyes landing on Draco's face and the blonde man found himself shaking his head and swallowing thickly.
A week before the Final Task had everyone on edge. Draco hadn't realised just how quick the year had gone by as well as the fact that the final task was supposed to be the hardest. What if Potter didn't come back? He tried to tell himself that he didn't care, but now that it was only seven days away he couldn't lie about the sense of dread he felt pool in his stomach. He didn't sleep too well and eating was almost a distant memory.
"Well since this is my decision of what we do tonight I want us to do something we've never done before."
Standing outside in the cold corridor and clenching his fingers into fists over and over, Harry looked up at the door with its charred frame and blackened wood. He was surprised some of the magic was still intact considering the cursed Fiendfyre that had disintegrated almost everything within. Drawing in a deep breath he turned the doorknob slowly, straining his ears for the sounds of rusted iron grating, or even that of approaching footsteps. There was nothing but the drumming of his own heartbeat. With a deep breath he pushed the door inwards and stepped inside.
They made raw passionate love for the remainder of that evening, their loud moans echoing out throughout Harry's garret. His legs were pressed up to his chest as Draco thrust into him and made him moan and scream Draco's name in a heavy voice he didn't know he could make. Harry was so sweaty and sore that by the end of it he doubt he would walk for the remainder of the weekend, a difficult feat in itself considering he needed to move his belongings into his larger room a couple of floors up. As soon as Draco had exhausted the both of them, he made short work of stripping the soiled sheets out from underneath Harry, and spreading a thick blanket underneath despite his weakening legs and Harry's obvious discomfort at being moved. Once the bed and been sorted, the blinds shut and a small array of stub candles were lit and dotted around on Harry's desk, windowsill and the bedside tables, Draco went back to lay himself down beside Harry, curling himself around the brunette's back and draping an arm over his waist.
At the end of a couple of hours Harry closed his second journal and placed it to one side, "If I've bored you into a coma you need only say and we can discuss something else, if you wish."
Draco tilted his chin up and pressed a firm, loving kiss to the brunette's mouth, "I do love you. So much. God! I literally couldn't hold the words in anymore. It's like I finally got some fucking courage to tell you!" Harry grinned up at him like an idiot as he stepped out of his trousers and started pushing the brunette back, grabbing at his robes and slipping his hand under his waistband and squeezing his arse tightly.
Lucius nodded his head and then left the room barking for the young maids to get back to their work. Harry flinched a little, having not heard Lucius raise his voice before, even if he had only met the man the night prior. Harry seated himself down his slim satchel pressed against his leg.
Harry stared up at the blond with wide eyes as they walked, "Are you serious? Draco, you didn't need to go through all that trouble just for me."
"Not great," he admitted, "The classes are running together, homework is boring and mind-numbing and I'm dreading the exams because I know I could drool on them and still pass with flying colours."
Draco nodded in understanding, "I do not wish to lose correspondence with you, Harry. You seem to be one of very few people who don't bore me … How did you put it? Into a coma?" Harry nodded with an abashed smiled and Draco returned it before sipping from his flute, "Would you write to me when you are not too busy studying for your exams?"
Harry looked up at Draco with fearful eyes. He really did not want to be taken back to that hospital. The staff members were rude to him because of who Draco was. He shook his head of such thoughts. "N-no. I'm going to Blackpool, Hermione. That's my choice."
"I can dry my own shirt, thank you," he snapped, the bitterness seeping into every syllable. He turned his back to Potter and went about spelling the stupid garment dry, despite how rough it now felt under his fingertips.
Draco smiled and then delicately removed the glasses from Harry's nose, wiping the fogged lenses on his jumper as he did so. He smoothed a hand over Harry's bald head, removing the cotton cap as he did so, before bending over the water to kiss his lover's forehead, "beautiful" he murmured before reaching for a flannel that was hanging on the side of the bath. He dipped the flannel into the warm water and then took Harry's bony, fragile arm in his hand, running the drenched flannel over the bruised skin. Draco's features creased into a frown as he ran his thumbs over the bruises where the needles had injected the chemotherapy toxins into his lover's already broken body -why had the bruised areas not healed yet?
He didn't realise that the tears were running down his cheeks until they dripped off his chin and soaked through the collar of his nightshirt. He sniffed loudly and wiped his cheeks roughly. "Do …" he hiccoughed, "Do you really mean that? Are you sure?" his breath was coming out in rapid huffs, "I mean you can still walk out. I know it's been ten years but you're still young –in spirit –you don't really need me dogging you the res –"
Harry bit him lip before closing his eyes. "I just ... I've always wondered what I ended up missing out on, growing up as a wizard." He felt the Slytherin stiffen under his head. "Not that being a wizard is bad, you know I love magic!" He drew in a deep breath and felt his chest tighten. "I just -a lot of things with magic is almost too easy, minimal effort required. I never had the messy, slippery, fiddly sex that muggles have. I know it's a stupid thing to want but -well, we did it so ... that's that."
"What was that for?" Draco asked softly, a smile on his mouth as he brushed his thumb against Harry's hollow cheeks.
He went to bed late that night. Later than usual for the past few months, at least. Seeker was already lying in the very middle of the bed, like he had done when he was a puppy. He swallowed thickly; it had seemed so long ago. He sighed and rubbed at his eyes, before slipping in between the cold sheets. Had they always been that cold? He rolled onto his side and gaze out over at Harry's side of the bed, the pillow still upright, the covers pulled taut.
However, none of them discussed their nightly wanderings to the Weasley-girl. Her sheer distaste for anything Slytherin didn't help matters, but whenever she was near Harry she would try to draw him into a conversation that would ultimately revolve around her. It was frustrating for Draco to watch but he didn't comment on it, not outright anyway. He just didn't want to seem bitter towards Harry. He valued the budding friendship far too much to outright badmouth his existing friends, no matter how annoying they were.
The smallest of groans emitting from Harry's soft lips. Draco looked up from his paper crane he was making out of a tissue -Harry's head had lolled to one side and now a frown was marring his forehead. Draco frowned in distaste before leaning forward and smoothing the pad of his thumb over Harry's forehead, earning him a soft sigh and the fluttering of black eyelashes.
Draco started to stroke his hair, his fingers twitching every now and then. "What made you want to do it this way?"
Draco frowned at the words and then found himself laughing, a bright chiming sound that startled Harry into a somewhat better mood, with his blonde head thrown back and his lungs aching sweetly at the effort. "Oh, Harry!" he gushed as he tilted his head to one side and stared intently at the brunette man, "If that's all you wanted you only had to say. Everyone judges what to do with me based on what you tell them. If you'd simply said so, it would have been established!" he wiped at his eyes of the weak tears of mirth that had trembled out, before swallowing and taking a long swig of iced water from his goblet.
Draco shook his head, "Not at all, Harry. You are passionate and intriguing, two very important things that I need in my life," he looked down at the brunette, "I think you would be good for me."
Harry felt itchy in his own skin as he gripped the bedrail tightly. He didn't know what he could say. What should he say? Everything seemed inappropriate. "Hi," he managed to breathe out, the silence cracking between them.
The Central Pier was cramped with the same dart-games, however there were far too many for it to be 'fun' and it seemed more like a 'gamble'. But they did manage to have fun riding the huge Ferris Wheel down the very end. Harry had found it exciting as he could see for miles all around. Draco was far too comfortable with gripping the pole in the center of their pod that allowed the whole thing to spin and turn. It made him feel queasy as the breeze twisted them.
As he stepped into the foyer of the hotel behind Head Healer Snape and the few other medical students who had agreed to come along to the trip, Harry couldn't help but express his wonder at how beautiful the glittering décor of the high walls and the chandeliers hanging overhead were. It had taken his breath away as soon as he'd seen them. He fixed his glasses on the end of his nose and followed his fellow companions over to a small place where he handed his travelling cloak to a tall, gloomy looking man in a dark suit.
Hermione opened and closed her mouth, not knowing how to respond to Harry's speech. Finally, darting her eyes between the both of them, she straightened her posture stiffly and pursed her lips, "if anything goes wrong, Draco, you'll been for it. And it's just me, you have the Weasley clan as well as the press to deal with."
Blaise and Theo lapsed into silence and returned their attention to their lunch. Blaise hummed and couldn't help but look up when Draco slid back into his seat, looking exceptionally more cheerful compared to when he'd left. For the rest of the lunch break he watched as he blonde's grey eyes kept casting glances over to the Gryffindor table. He just knew at the back of his mind that Potter kept glancing up at their table. He rolled his eyes when he was sure no one was looking. It was so painful watching the blonde growing slowly and surely more infatuated with the four-eyed git. Blaise wasn't homophobic; he couldn't care less one way or another.
It was on this evening when Draco had been faced with shutting up the shop on his own and had looked forward to eating some cold cuts –another thing Harry had gotten him into –and then collapsing into bed. He hadn't been expecting to open the door to their apartment and find a fat candle perched on almost every available flat service, flickering in the cool October breeze that drifted in through a crack under the windowpane. His mouth had hung open in surprise, something he never would have dared to do if his father had been in the vicinity, and gaped at the room that was bathed in the golden light. Harry stood there in absolutely nothing. He was stark naked, with soft shadows rolling over his stomach and chest muscles. He'd felt his knees go weak beneath him as he drank in every inch of his handsome lover. "Harry," he breathed in awe, "What are you up to?" he couldn't help the smile that teased at his lips, his breathing coming out in short, rasping spurts.
Draco watched from the bed as Harry's lithe figure hobbled out of the bedroom, his limbs stiff from being cooped up in a bed for months, and a slight limp in his left leg. Seeker padded after him, his tail wagging from side-to-side. When Harry's shadow was lost from view Draco returned his attention to the jumpers and, with a sigh, resumed packing.
"Draco can you promise me something?" Harry asked in a soft voice, his green eyes glittering. Draco felt dread flood his stomach but instead of biting Harry's head off that he didn't want to hear any of it, he swallowed thickly and nodded his head for Harry to continue. "Promise me that -if you give all this another go -that you'll be ready for anything; for a puppy or random holidays to Blackpool," he chuckled weakly, "and maybe children if it gets really serious."
Draco shook his head, "Well we both know someone who pretty much survived a life like that. Severus pretty much lost all he had to live for when he was just a few years older than us. I mean sure he was only thirty-eight when he was killed, but he still lived almost twenty years just stewing in his own rage, hatred and pain. I'm not saying it's an ideal life, but you can still ... live."
Thankfully, Draco just settled beside him with a cool, calm patience that Harry truly admired about him, especially after everything he'd been through.
Draco smiled gently up at him, "After father's will was read out and his belongings divided between the benefactors, it turns out that I got this ring. It is a family heirloom passed from generation to generation. This is my way of promising you that you are not alone in any of this anymore. I will be here by your side no matter what happens. I have seen you at your worst and, even though it took some time, I am still here ten years on and I still love you. I want to be with you for the rest of my life, Harry James Potter, and by accepting this ring, you are declaring that you will love me for the rest of your life and will stay by my side for as long as we both shall live. You are my husband and with this ring, I am declaring that you are officially part of my family. Forever more."
Ginny furrowed her brow and Harry couldn't deny his interest was piqued as he lazily flicked through his Defence textbook whilst eating his food. "Who are you talking about, Hermione?"
Harry let a small smile grace his lips as he reached out and traced a line down the blonde man's features. When had he stopped noticing the slight crow's feet around his eyes, or the way his slender neck had gotten a little thinner, the shadow of his beard already starting to grow back out again? He still looked handsome but he also looked a great deal more distinguished than he had when they were younger, or even when they'd gone to spend the summer at Severus'. He had no doubt filled a little around the neck and cheeks but his muscles were a little leaner than they had been a few years ago. It was to be expected as he was now forty-three years old. He let out a soft sigh and relaxed as Draco's fingertips caressed his scalp. "That feels nice," he murmured as he closed his eyes and leaned into the touch.
Draco shook his head, hesitating briefly, before edging his way over to the armchair that was bedside Harry's bed. With the way their relationship had been going lately he didn't think it would be wise for him to slip into the bed like he desperately wanted to. He gave his own disapproving frown at Harry and nodded towards the oil lamp and the book in his lap, "You need to sleep at night, Harry. You've been running yourself ragged for weeks and I'm scared that you're doing yourself more harm than good." He sank down into the armchair and pressed his back into the soft cushioned back, his hooded eyes peering over at the dark haired man.
The silence reigned between them as the ticking of the clock on the mantel grew ever louder between them. It was Draco who finally broke the silence, his voice tight and cold unlike it had been the other night. "I see my father managed to cajole you into keeping me preoccupied while he goes about his political drivel."
"Why not?" Draco countered softly, picking at a frayed thread on the armchair, "You're the head healer; just tell them you're cashing in your time for a holiday, a break. You deserve it more than anyone."
The stairs creaked underfoot as he mounted them one at a time, his body feeling heavier and heavier as he drew closer to the landing at the top outside their apartment door. He slid his key out of his waistcoat pocket and slipped it into the lock. The sound grated against his eardrums and he winced. Forcing his weight on the door he was admitted into the room and couldn't help but feel surprised at the sight that greeted him beyond the threshold. "What's all this?" he croaked tiredly as he dropped his briefcase down behind the front door, a few empty phials clinking together gently, before removing his travelling cloak and hanging it up on the carved oak coat-stand in the corner of the entrance.
Draco was left standing there, shivering and confused. He raised Potter's shirt to his cheek and felt how soft it was. He quickly slipped it on, revelling in the warmth still clinging to every stitch and shuddered. It was the closest he had gotten to a hug in months. He hugged his arms around his middle and bent his nose to inhale the scent on the collar before he snapped himself out of his musings, gathered his sodden jumper out of the sink before slipping out of the bathroom and heading towards the dungeons, replaying what had just happened over and over in his head.
Draco nodded, "You managed to hold my interest for two whole hours straight whilst teaching me about the internal organs of the human body, so yes even if it's a tedious day for you I am sure it would interest me greatly."
Severus narrowed his eyes a fraction but inclined his head, "Yes, I want to know about everything. Anything that springs to mind that hasn't been happening recently. Also, I want you to tell me that last time you felt 'happy'. Even remotely happy, can you do that for me?" Draco nodded his head, feeling his entire body tense up when his godfather's cool, bottomless eyes turned on him. "I will be asking Harry to do the same. I don't expect him to be truthful on the matter if my suspicions are correct, but I would like both points of view to compare notes and determine how I can help the both of you. Sometimes you need a third person perspective on things, a fresh pair of eyes, to make sure that I understand all that I can and how I can help."
Draco was in no mood. He had just woken up to yelling, he still had bed hair and morning breath and he was half-dressed. "Hermione just shut the fuck up!" he cried out, blood rushing up to his face. She turned to him again, about to start another tirade but he cut across her, "Harry is fine alright! I brought him home! He did not escape or anything like that! They're making shit up!"
They stopped walking and Draco bent to his knees and called out Seeker's name. The soggy bundle of blonde hair pivoted and bounded towards them, long pink tongue lolling out of its mouth. When the dog pounced upon Draco, the blond man was forced onto his back into the damp sand, a yell of surprise piercing the air. Harry was too busy laughing to call of the dog who was more than happy to lick Draco's features with its hot, flat tongue. "S-Seeker!" Harry choked out between hysterics, "come on down boy, you know Draco doesn't like getting dirty."
"Potter!" he called out in a controlled voice, barely audible over the din of students returning to their dorms. He cursed his insecurities as he reached out and snagged the sleeve of Harry's robe and yanked, "Potter!"
When he got back to his room later that night, the steep staircases making his legs ache even more than they had earlier, he went about packing his trunk with the few potions he had researched and found in storage, including the one he had brewed after hours, and piled a few medical journals inside to read if Draco was feeling too weak and needed some company, as well as a new bound journal of his own to start recording his findings and research. He hadn't added everything he'd already researched as yet, because he wanted to cast some diagnosis spells on Draco's chest to see if he was able to detect the areas of pain and compare it to the diagnosis chart he had copied down during his lunch break. Kneeling back on his haunches he felt satisfied that he had everything and then settled down to sleep.
She was jolted out of her readings as Professor Slughorn's voice resounded through the room, "And now I shall read out your project partners so listen up!"
Saturday morning dawned through the curtain-less window. Harry tried to stay in bed for a little longer but he couldn't ignore the butterflies in his stomach or the fact that he had a huge throbbing hard-on that he took an especially long shower to get rid of before the others had even stirred in their beds. He spent the rest of the morning before breakfast doing some of his homework in the common room much to Hermione's surprise when she came down and saw that he was already awake and dressed. She smiled knowingly and even chuckled softly when he told her just how nervous he was feeling. She dropped a lucky kiss to his cheek just as Ron trotted down the stairs and asked if they were ready for breakfast.
The blonde man nodded from his position beneath Harry, "More than I was that night in the function room over twenty years ago and I thought to myself 'that young apprentice has the most beautiful eyes I have ever seen –I wonder if he has a beautiful voice to match'."
Draco looked down at the brunette apprentice with mild surprise and couldn't help himself feel a little excitable at what that question might mean. He wasn't holding out any hope, but he did enjoy talking to the young brunette. He tried to fit in without being insolent and he was certainly fairly passionate about what he could do with his apprenticeship. "Are you offering me to be your first private patient Mister Potter? Because if that's the case then I must say that I am intrigued as to how you would proceed with helping me fight my ailments, as I have been assured without a doubt that they cannot be healed."
The dot labelled 'DRACO MALFOY' had been pacing back and forth across the dorm for a while, as the other Slytherin's slept peacefully, it would seem, but Draco's dot had appeared rather restless that evening.
Seconds later Pansy sat down and huffed in agitation, "Whatever happened with that potion, it's making him into one soppy little bastard," she sneered, her lips curling.
Draco twitched his lip at the indication to how much time Harry had spent in St. Mungo's over the past year. He bent down to ruffle Seeker's damp golden ears. "Alright, lets get this mongrel back to the hotel and rinse him down before we go out. I don't think many people will appreciate the smell of wet dog."
been making more of an effort to force himself to leave the hospital before the night staff came on duty, but it was difficult. He didn't know why –if he did he would fix it –but it was so difficult to find his home and Draco alluring when something in his mind was forcing himself to think of work nonstop.
Draco sorted the problem out for him; he nodded his head and turned on his heel before walking along to the staircase to make his way back down to the dungeons. Before he reached the stairwell, however, an idea struck Harry. "Wait!" he hurried after Draco, his legs still feeling a little shaky as he went. The blonde stopped and turned to face him with a raised eyebrow. "If you want, we can meet up and duel during the evenings?"
"Oh, then that settles the matter!" she exclaimed as she reached out to grasp Harry's end, "The hospital will survive without you for a fortnight, Harry. If Draco is ill it may be because of the pressure on his mind. You taught me that stress can weaken the psyche and make it so that some people are easier to succumb to illnesses! You are both coming to Severus' house with me and Lucius and that settles matters. Severus," she turned her attention to her friend, "I'm sure you can find some competent to help out whilst Harry is away, can you not?"
Harry spread his legs beneath Draco and massaged his fingers against Draco's scalp, thrusting his cock to move further into his lover's beautifully hot mouth. Draco complied drawing deep, throaty moans from Harry as he received a blow-job that was making his mind spin and swirl into a mass of exotic colours behind his eyelids.
However, it didn't take away from the fact that Potter was tense as fuck from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to bed. They hadn't had a jerk-off session since, and Draco silently told himself that it had been spur of the moment and wouldn't happen again. So why did he feel disheartened by it? He had to shake his head at least three times a day to tell himself he didn't give a shit. He'd wear his 'POTTER STINKS' badge with pride until the tournament was over.
Harry hummed softly before responding, "It could very well help him if he was instructed on how the body has been designed to work and some possibilities of his condition as well as how the medicine would indeed cure him or at the very least aim to make his life more bearable."
He don't know how long he was crouched down on his knees and working Draco wider and wider, but as soon as his lover was ready and waiting for his throbbing member, he stood up and straightened the sore muscles in his knees before slicking his own cock up and positioning himself up between Draco's quivering thighs. "H-Harry … Please … Need more," Draco panted, his chest rising up and down rapidly.
Harry smirked as he peppered gentle kisses up Draco's body, smoothing his free hand up and down the blonde man's pale muscles, "It's alright, my love, just relax and you'll enjoy it."
The sun was warm on his face as he stepped outside to find Harry leaning against the front wall with Seeker tugging at his lead eagerly. Draco glanced at his watch -it was late afternoon and he was starving. "Fancy something to eat?" he asked as they walked out of the white iron gate and down the street.
"I don't want to leave you, Draco," came the breathy whisper in the darkness. "I am finally happy and now -I just -"
Draco smirked, "only for you, Scarhead." His smirk grew even wider as Harry flushed and averted his gaze, as Draco pressed his warm lips to the scar on his lover's forehead.
He forced himself up from the wicker chair, his muscles stiff and sore from being sat in the same position for almost two hours, and went to the small drawer in one of the cupboard in his bedchamber. The small phials glinted in the sunlight that was pouring in through the balcony windows and he sighed as he uncorked one and shuffled over to the bed with it clutched between his fingers. The mattress sank underneath him and he raised the glass to his lips and tipped the contents back, the bitter taste hitting his taste buds sharply. Wincing and sucking on his tongue, he tossed the phial carelessly to one side and shifted down to lay on his side, watching the lake glitter in the afternoon sunlight through the balcony before his mind started to cloud over and he succumbed himself to sleep.
Draco felt a flush creep up his neck as he grasped his empty flute in his hand, his face devoid of colour, even more so now. "How on earth can you tell that I have powder on my face?" he hissed, "I bought it for the sole purpose that I was told it was undetectable!"
Unbeknown to Draco, Harry did wake up far earlier then he wanted to. He didn't instantly leap out of Draco's arms like he felt he should do, but instead he would simply lie there in the warm sheets, their legs tangled like they'd used to be after making sweet, sensual love all night long, and traced gentle patterns along the fine blonde hairs over Draco's forearm. The blonde would shiver and hold him closer and for a brief moment, Harry closed his eyes and allowed himself to feel loved and adored before the dark mood settled in his mind and he slipped out of the warmth of their bed and forced himself about his daily routine.
Harry shook his head a fraction, not knowing the answer. What could he say? He knew it wasn't going to be that simple and he didn't know if he wanted to go through such lengths to get him anywhere relatively close to how he was last year, "Do you mind if I try and sleep on it Severus?" he muttered softly, "Let me think about it."
Draco had played CD after CD to fill the gentle silences that would occur when Harry would exhaust himself and fall into a small slumber. Draco did not mind. It was a pleasant day, despite the weather changing dramatically on the journey to Blackpool, from drizzly grey London weather to bright sunny, Blackpool weather, it stayed more-or-less the same on the journey down. Even as the evening drew near and they entered the busy streets of London, the temperature was still surprisingly warm.
Severus inclined his head, "I can only watch so many people suffer in silence before my conscience creeps back in, Draco. Besides, you and Harry are two of the closest things I've ever had to sons. I want you both to feel like, if something has happened, you can at least turn to me for advice. I've had forty-five years in training for it."
Harry knew though. Deep down they both knew exactly how the other felt. And it didn't scare either of them like it should've done.
With a heavy sigh she turned around, her arms folded across her chest, to look up at him, "I didn't mean to snap like that," she offered by way of an apology.
Whilst he waited in the oppressive reception area to be guided through along the maze of corridors, he stuffed his hands into his pockets and drew out his bus ticket. He had not wanted to touch the portkey sitting on the kitchen counter -that was for emergencies only. He ground his teeth together and began folding the edges into one another. He had been fascinated by the origami birds Hermione liked to make when it was a girls' night in, so he had asked her to teach him. She had gladly accepted the challenge, and soon Draco sound himself making origami cranes with any small amounts of paper he could find. Including bus tickets.
"Of course not, Master Malfoy, but sometimes having someone read it to you will fix it a little firmer into your mind so that you are more likely to remember it at a later date."
Draco sniffed and ran a hand down his tear stained cheeks, a choking sob brewing up in his chest again. "Does … Does this mean your my 'wife'?" he teased with a cheeky grin, earning a flick on his ear. They chuckled together for a moment before Harry slipped the ring off the chain and, taking Draco's left hand in his own, he slipped the ring on. Draco stared down at the band, his heart beating in his chest. He was transfixed on how beautiful something so simply could be. He looked up at Harry nervously and licked his lips, "Let me show you how much I love you, Harry," he breathed, leaning in for another soft kiss, his cool hands running up the length of the tanned naked thighs before him, his mouth pressing tenderly to Harry's and his thumbs brushing along the coarse hair between his legs.
Later the evening, Draco hadn't appeared in the Great Hall along with everyone else. For one, Harry Potter, this realization was a little unsettling after the funny looks the blonde had been giving him all afternoon. It was as though he were love-struck or something. But for the other Slytherin's, it was a much needed moment of secrecy that they could duck their heads together and trade information.
Draco watched everything happen as if in slow-motion -his mouth hung open in a stiff, soundless scream of fury.
The bell rang and he was just about to stealthily make his way out ahead of most of the class when he felt something warm and wet rain down on him from behind. He turned around just to get another cloud of the grey soapy water used for scrubbing out cauldrons crash into him again. He coughed and spewed out the water that had surfed down his throat, and soaked his school shirt and trousers. As he rubbed the water out of his eyes he could hear the laughter bubbling up from everyone who had stopped to watch. He could feel his eyes and nose burn with the threat of tears. He wouldn't cry in front of them.
Draco stopped abruptly, tugging Harry to a halt beside him. "No," he breathed, his expression stern. "You are not allowed to think like that. Let's just -enjoy the evening alright?"
Harry shrugged his shoulders, "I think I can manage a shower. You just open the window and ... relax," leaning over on the bed, Harry pressed a small kiss to Draco's mouth before smiling and retreating into the bathroom.
Every available surface was decorated with candles -thick ones, thin ones, even some vanilla scented ones -bathing the room in a sultry, golden glow.
When Draco turned around to see him, he gave an awkward little smile, "Hey, sorry about this but ... Well, after what you said about seeing Christmas for the first time, I thought that -maybe -we could see another type of first Christmas together."
Harry nodded to indicate that he knew it only too well. Seeing that he had hit a brick wall, Severus stood up from the chair and waved his wand to light the two candles on Harry's bedside table. He looked down at the gaunt young man in the bed and felt his own heart clench. Just as he was turning away to leave the room and go down to dinner with Narcissa and Lucius, Harry reached out and snatched at his fingers. He turned around and arched an eyebrow down at the beaten down young man. With broken green eyes Harry looked up at him and with quaking muscles and rasped out, "Make sure that Draco's okay," he pleaded with his eyes and as well as his words, "Please, Severus. Make sure he's going to be okay. And tell him I … Tell him that I lo –" Why couldn't he say the words? He wanted the words out of his mouth but they wouldn't tumble out! He swallowed thickly and dropped his gaze and his hand clinging to Severus.
He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. No, he wouldn't go back to the room. He had enough trouble sleeping and trying to avoid panic attacks whenever he walked by a classroom his aunt had destroyed or through the courtyard where Fenrir had slain his fair share of innocent children. He didn't need the burnt ruins of the room adding to those nightmares.
Draco squeezed the cool fingers in his palm, "He missed you too. In fact, just last night he brought this over to me," from the deep pocket of his hoodie he drew out the tattered book. He slid it onto Harry's lap and watched as weak fingers ran over the familiar cover. "I think he wanted you to have it -in case you got bored."
Harry was shocked to say the least. What Lord Malfoy was suggesting was not something that had even entered into his mind. "W-wouldn't you prefer to have someone that you know informing your master Malfoy of such things? My presence would surely only disturb him further, and I wouldn't want to be a burden on you, Lord Malfoy."
The long weekend at his parents Manor was a nice change of pace from the hurly burly world of running the apothecary and Harry disappearing to work as soon as he could get away from their apartment. It was refreshing to be able to sleep peacefully beside a large fire, whether it was a light or not. He did miss the fact that he couldn't sleep beside Harry's warm body, although he wasn't sure what he missed more; sleeping beside Harry or how he used to be at night sleeping with Harry. In truth the memory was a lot more appealing than their current reality but he never voiced it aloud. He didn't mind having all the space to roll around in but he had grown accustomed to reach out and lightly touch his hand along Harry's, who would entwined their fingers lazily in his sleep. Those moments made Draco's eyes tear up. The fact that, even in his subconscious, Harry
There was a momentary frown on the blonde's face before he smiled and nodded his head, "Let's see if you can sleep without me, eh, Potter?" and with a cheeky wink, he turned and started on his way down the stairs again.
"Ah! You must be Mister Malfoy!" came a cheery Southern accent from the small flight of stairs to the front door. An Indian man with ash grey hair stood there in a black collared shirt and dark trousers. His shoes shined as he descended the stairs, hand out-stretched, "my name is Cass and I will be here to serve you, as will my wife Oli"
"I'll go and talk to her," he stated, barely even looking at the red-haired girl as he hurried after Hermione. He gave Ron a reassuring smile and clap on the shoulder before jogging to keep up with Hermione. "Hermione!" he called out as he followed her out of the Entrance Hall and onto the lawns. "Hermione wait!"
topic brought up between them was enough to make them tense up. "So, Draco, Harry, Severus was telling me this morning about how he had recently bought a new house by the Lake District and has invited us along for two weeks in August. Isn't that lovely?" she beamed at the both of them, their haggard appearances not registering in her mind as she waited for a response.
"Why would you ask that?" Lucius enquired with a cool expression and an eyebrow hitched into his hairline.
Harry blinking before giving a lopsided smile and crawling up the length of Draco's body. They were both hot and damp, hovering on their high as he planted a series of kisses along the blonde's pale throat. Strong arms wrapped around his waist, pulling him deep and tight. "Careful," he grunted in Draco's ear. "Or I'll finish in you before I get to make you come."
Harry's bottom lip wobbled as he turned to face Draco, and that's when the other boy realised that there were tears in those green eyes. "How am I meant to explain to anybody that maybe I should be dead right now? That maybe it's better for me to be dead?"
Seeker was more than happy as he bounded through into their apartment towards his cushioned bed by the sofa. Draco went straight through into the kitchen whilst Harry announced that he was going to flick through the T.V. channels for a descent movie to watch.
They settled in a comfortable silence -or as comfortable as they could get at this point -for a little while before Draco sighed and stood up to stretch his legs, "We can't stay in here all night. The room took a lot out of itself protecting you."
The blond man collapsed onto the mattress beside his lover. He felt as though his heart was on every drug known to the world, it was beating so fast.
"It's no trouble," Draco breathed as his tender hands slipped down to the brunette's shoulders and kneaded the tense muscles. Harry felt himself a little shaking breath before closing his eyes and allowing his lovers touch spread warmth and relaxation into his muscles. Why had he been avoiding this man's touches these last few weeks, when they felt so beautiful even through clothes? What had he been so afraid of returning home for? Why did he always take a glass of whiskey before he got on the train home every night?
Draco rubbed Potter's length, rubbing the sweet spot under his head and making him grunt and pant in the chair. He groaned as he felt himself harden a little as he nipped at Potter's ear, "Together we could really make the 'Shrieking Shack' worthy of its name."
He had wanted it. Of course he had wanted it! He would have been a fool if he hadn't, but he should have showed some restrained in the matter and let Draco lead things the way he wanted to. He had ended up apologising profusely, backing away from their blanket in the shaded grass and turned from the blonde and hurried back across the lawn to the house. Draco wouldn't have appreciated being left behind in the growing darkness but he had needed some time to distance himself and gather his thoughts before letting himself run rampant again. He didn't have to wait long to know how Draco felt about it all, as that night the blonde aristocrat had snuck up to Harry's bedchamber –the one with the balcony looking out over the gardens and the lake –and had demanded to be let in.
Harry twitched his mouth. "I know these last few months have been tough for you, Draco, and I love you so much for staying with me through everything but-"
Could he do it? he wondered as he stroked the smooth wood and shifted his feet closer to Seeker's warmth radiating from the other end of the sofa. Maybe he could. He would need a distraction. The empty apartment was a constant reminder of the long, agonizing months away from his beautiful, beloved Harry.
Harry leaned up on his elbow with a shocked expression. "Are you honestly telling me you'd like to do that again?" he asked hesitantly.
"It wouldn't be the first time I've nearly killed him," Harry rasped as he curled even tighter into himself, his knees drawn to his chest, his bare feet damp and cold.
"Well ... You know the resurrection stone?" Draco nodded. "Well -Dumbledore had it in his office. I found it in the snitch he left me in his last will and testament." Swallowing thickly, he forced his voice to work, "And it ... It showed me my parents. Brought them back for that brief moment. They said that they were so proud of me and that they loved me. They wouldn't leave me at all, even if the plan went ahead."
With a sigh he pushed his plate away, not that he was eating much anyway, and stood up from the Slytherin table. As he straightened his robes with a flourish, he glared down at his friends. "I hate you all for giving a shit," he snapped before briskly walking away. His heart drummed loudly in his ears as he crossed the Great Hall, noting the numerous pairs of eyes turning to watch him.
Draco watched as Harry worked himself into a frenzy. His face got a little redder and a vein in his neck throbbed. It took all of his willpower not to just tackle the brunette to the floor and take him by surprised to shut up. Instead he reached out and gripped his shoulder tightly and forced the younger boy to look at him. "Harry, Harry, Harry just calm down!"
"Oh really Potter?" Malfoy spat, his voice rough and hoarse, no doubt, from crying. "Then why are you here? Stalking me again?" At Harry's pursed lips, he sneered, "Yeah, you
"Yes," he breathed out, his mouth working on its own accord. However, as soon as the word was out there, in the air, he found that he did not regret them. It felt so right. They had spent a great portion of their life together -why not take it that one extra step? Allowing the world to know that they were one another's alone, and no one elses?
Draco almost snorted. Almost. He slipped his hand around Potter's throat and gripped him tightly. "Maybe I'll check that for myself," he growled as he forced his hand down the front of Potter's jeans, making the younger boy gasp and jerk. It was too late. There was nowhere for him to recoil to, so he he was practically trapped as Draco's long, cool fingers wrapped around his cock and started to tug.
He slumped in a sweating heap among his pillows, his arms folded over his chest and his skin feeling sickly and almost wet all over from how much he had been sweating due to his current fever. His energy had all but left him since he'd written his latest letter to Harry five days ago. He was getting a little anxious at not having gotten a response yet and it was already Tuesday evening. He hated being ill because it meant that every one of his meals would consist of breakfast items, the easier for him to digest, and he loathed every moment of it. A letter from Harry would really have made him feel better at that moment but he supposed that the brunette young man had a lot of studying to do. He didn't mind about that but he did get anxious whenever he didn't get a letter. His correspondence with Harry was the only thing that seemed to alleviate the sheer boredom of hanging around the manor all day long. A knock on his door interrupted his musings and he felt his anger burn up inside him once again and he was just about to yell for them to get away when his door opened. He tossed his head to the side and almost regretted his angered expression when he saw who was standing in the doorway.
