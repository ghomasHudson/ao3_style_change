“I don’t know.” God, Harry wants to scream. He wants what Draco has, a way to be a thousand miles up out of the atmosphere, in the dark, uncaring void of space. He wants someone to sit him down and tell him what to do, because he has no idea. “I think we should try— a break maybe, nothing permanent—”
When he’s gone, when the screen’s gone dark and Harry’s pulled his head back out of his fireplace, he sits on the rug with his chin on his knees and thinks about how inescapably unfair the whole situation is.
“Well you’re certainly not
“It’s nice to have privacy, though, I guess. And McGonagall said we’ll still be allowed in our House common rooms, once everyone’s back. I wonder what they’re doing about classes. Reckon we’ll be in with the year below?”
“Yeah,” Potter says again, except he doesn’t sound like he’s joking, and his eyes have gone all sad and wide.
His mouth is warmer this time, especially when Draco parts his lips and tilts his head, gets Potter to open up too until he’s leaning back against the footboard of his bed, Draco bent into him. They’ve both got their hands to themselves and it strikes Draco as funny, suddenly, just their mouths touching and nothing else, and once he’s thought that he can’t stop thinking about how this entire thing is funny, Potter kissing him and then falling off the side of the castle and Draco bringing him in here and sitting him down and kissing him right back.
“At least we’ve moved on from the
Draco stretches, his fingertips brushing the ceiling, then shrugs, lets his legs fold under him and collapses back onto the bed with a small bounce.
wants.
“You’re very-- flusterable,” Potter grins, pulling back but keeping Draco’s head bracketed in his hands.
Draco sighs and rubs his eyes. “Well, I was.”
then,” she says, pulls herself into the driver's seat and glares at the three of them.
“Draco, just—” Potter pants, shocking Draco with the use of her first name and using her grip in Draco’s hair to get her mouth back where Potter wants it. The tug hurts a bit in a way that feels so good Draco moans herself, the vibrations against Potter making her buck up. She pushes into Draco’s mouth, holding her head down, gently enough at first that Draco can break away if necessary, and then with more force when Draco moans again, enthusiastically, and pushes closer.
“Yeah,” Harry breathes, no brain function left for anything more. “Yeah.”
“I think,” Draco says, muffled because Potter’s leaned back in, impatient. He has to stop talking to give as good as he’s getting, push back into Potter’s space and bite gently at his bottom lip, but when he’s done, when Potter’s looking satisfyingly dazed, he carries on. “I think my actual words were something about making the best of the time we’ve got.”
If his friends are right, and Malfoy is doing all of this on purpose, Harry hates him. Except for the part where he wants him in his bed.
He’s right that the name
Draco will never not be surprised that someone who cares so very little about sports got hired to be the main Quidditch correspondent for the Prophet. Although, Pansy’s complete lack of interest in the game doesn’t seem to have stopped her from getting exclusive interview after exclusive interview with half the players in the country, and several from around the world too. And Draco’s certainly not complaining — Pansy gets her free tickets to most games.
Potter mutters something that Draco doesn’t catch and jerks his head back the way they came. “C’mon,” he says. “We’ll lose the light soon.”
He’s still short with Potter a lot of the time, because it’s basically part of his personality after this many years, but mostly Potter laughs it off. Today he seems to barely hear Draco.
Harry doesn’t let go. “They won’t.”
Potter rolls his eyes, which seems to take it out of him because they slip closed right after. “Pointing out that you’re choosing not to say it isn’t any better than actually saying it.”
It’s weird — Harry knows some people like this, the choking thing, but he never understood it. It felt too restrictive, a little too on the side of violence for his tastes. But this is— it’s different. It isn’t Malfoy holding him down. It’s Harry in control, Harry cutting off his own air supply because he wants to, because he knows it’ll feel good and Malfoy told him to. And he wants to do what Malfoy says, which isn’t really a new thing, if he’s honest.
to do this, for months on end...
Potter climbs through his window two nights later, some kind of metal flask tucked under his arm and two mugs in the opposite hand. It seems impossible he’s made it up the side of the castle carrying all that.
Harry sees the moon, up close. They’re on a detour, Draco says, because of some unexpected asteroid debris that they need to avoid, and it means they might have to delay a couple more days until they can circle back around to Earth. Harry’s not complaining.
Potter falls just like he did last time, onto his knees first and then face down, making a wet choking noise. He wasn’t even throwing himself in front of Granger this time, just standing there, and Dolohov still went for him.
Harry takes another bite of his sandwich. “And you can afford spontaneous lobster?”
“Sometimes I just do, Potter. Do I need a reason?”
He finally lets go, because he has to.
He rubs over him, the shape hot and hard through the fabric, watching as the look of surprise on Malfoy’s face crumples and he moans,
“It only started blooming again when you-- er, after Christmas, I mean.”
He gives her an impatient look. “
“What now?” asks Weasley, when they’re in the street, Potter steadily turning the snow beneath him red. “Mungo’s?”
“I don’t even really
Ginny pipes up again. “Harry, you know he has the right to do whatever, or
“Oh, that’s simple.” She sounds like she’s answering a question in class and Draco gets hit with a wave of confused nostalgia for back when they all still hated him, and he them, and no-one had tried to kill him in the last twenty-four hours. “The loop kept kicking in when you lost consciousness, so you were never awake long enough to see if we got to the hospital in time. Harry stopped it by removing the piece, so when you blacked out this time, everything continued chronologically as it should and we were able to get you both here.” She smiles at him a little. “Though, I think you getting us out of there and to the car so quickly probably helped a lot. I’m not sure they’d have been able to do much to save either of you if we were much later, even with the loop broken.”
Hermione raised her eyebrows. “I assumed you’d have the forethought to arrange for your own transportation home at the end of the night. You’re an Auror, Harry. I know you know how to think tactically.” She crunched into a slice of cucumber.
They held their mock stand-off for a few seconds, then Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Very well, then. I’m forced to keep my brilliant headline to myself. Though, maybe I’ll let it slip next pub night. It’s really too good to allow it to go unappreciated.”
The bastards.
nsure the product never comes into contact with coriander, as that may disrupt the charmwork and cause it to behave erratically.
He hadn't even cast a spell, just said the words. Which, it turned out, was enough.
Ron shrugged again.
If only Kingsley would finish. Harry had seen Ron heading for the tearoom as he was on his way to Kingsley's office. And for whatever reason, the tea Ron made tasted like ambrosia…
“Right,” Malfoy said, shaking his head a little as he bent over the papers again. “I just assumed you’d keep them in boxes.”
As he left his cubicle to respond to the latest cock discovery, the line of CopyCocks on his desk bid him goodbye with increasing levels of enthusiasm. The first one in line barely twitched in his direction, while the last—which still, days later, remained fully erect any time Harry was in the room with it—swayed longingly in his direction like a sunflower following the sun.
Malfoy never glanced up again to notice.
Harry supposed it looked a bit like the cock currently sitting on the corner of his desk. If one could say a chihuahua looked rather like a rottweiler because they were both dogs. But it was huge. Intimidatingly large, even flaccid and nestled in the silky-looking blue cushioning inside the box.
"No, I can't spoil it for you." Rosemary rubbed her hands together in glee. "Everyone should get to have their first experience with Mrs Periweather unsullied by expectations."
“You don’t sound sorry at all,” Harry grumbled, though he couldn’t help smiling back. Malfoy’s laugh did things to him. Strange, fluttery, squirmy things to his lungs and stomach.
Together, they lingered near the doorway and watched the bustle for a few minutes. Harry was just about to go back to his office when a red-faced young Auror came running over.
"Your case. No one would have to know."
Ron nodded. "No cocks on Saturdays."
Harry clutched his box a little bit tighter—he had a brief and mildly horrifying vision of what might happen if he dropped it and its contents flopped out onto the floor in front of everyone—and joined the end of the queue.
Ron laughed right in his face. The bastard.
Rosemary smirked. "Yes. Yes I have. It was sitting tall and proud on your desk for several hours this afternoon."
“Afraid not,” Malfoy said.
There were a few long, stunned seconds of silence. And then Malfoy blinked bemusedly at the vibrating cock in his hand, and began to laugh.
"What," he said, blinking at the cocks, eyes darting helplessly from one to the other and back again. "What the hell."
The cock came loose far easier than he expected, and Harry wasn’t braced for it. His wet trainers slipped on the bronze and he didn’t have a good handhold. Harry knew better than to hope that no one had captured a picture of him losing his grip on the wizard and toppling back onto his arse with a splash, CopyCock Number Four clutched valiantly in his hand. At this point, he only hoped it wouldn’t end up in the
Which worked well enough, until a particularly enthusiastic twitch against the lid sent the cock popping up like a jack-in-the-box.
"Yes."
It was signed simply,
Harry shrugged. "Apparently it's what they need if it's not a Splinching, too. I'd take it up with those wankers down in Filing, but Hermione's been working on them for five years now, and if she can't get through, I have no hope."
Harry snapped his fingers. “That’s the one. Well, the latest cock was found charmed to his forehead.” He paused a moment, remembering. He hadn’t had time to really enjoy the image it presented, what with panicking and trying to get it down, but he was very much enjoying the memory. “It fit quite well, too. The balls rested over his eyes, the cock drooping down over his nose. It was actually something of an improvement, in my opinion.”
d the teaspoon with a sigh and dropped it into the sink. “Well. A while in Apparition won’t be so bad, I expect. It’s not too bad so far as punishments go.”
"Oh! Hey Harry! How's it going?"
Really, were it not for the months of piss taking, plus the fact that a perfect replica of his cock was still attached to a chair, he'd write the whole thing off as Bartram reaping the benefits of the mountains of red tape he was more than half responsible for.
"They haven't been dirty in the past. They have, on occasion, had your lunch on them, however. Pardon me for being cautious."
Harry had heard Malfoy laugh before, cruel or derisive or mocking, but never like this. Open and deep and a little helpless, and...nice. Very nice, actually. Malfoy had a surprisingly nice laugh, and it did something strange and a little fluttery to the very pit of Harry’s stomach.
Malfoy scowled a little bit and jabbed the cock again with his quill. “The coriander in the vindaloo must have interacted with the enchantments on the.” He broke off, glancing down at the cock which had twitched hard enough to tip out of the box entirely and was now slowly buzzing its way toward the edge of the table. Malfoy hit it with a Stasis Spell and it froze in place. Harry’s ears rang a bit in the sudden silence. Malfoy gave the cock another glance and sighed. “The enchantments on the specimen,” he finished.
“Bastard,” Harry said morosely. Definitely Hermione, then. She’d probably give him a headache potion, too. Harry loved Hermione.
Malfoy lowered the cock, peering at Harry through his long pale lashes. "So I have
Looked like Vindaloo Cock had gone off again, and it must’ve been right up against Sparklepenis because seconds later a jet of rainbow sparks erupted into the air.
“That’s a lot of words that start with A,” Harry broke in, more than a little worried that she intended to work her way through the whole alphabet.
"Harry." Arthur's smile warmed, and he dropped the penis back in the hat and patted Harry's arm. "It's really all right. Nothing to be bothered about." And when Harry continued to stare, "Do you think I've not seen a few penises in my time?"
"And you've got to get a Healer to sign off?"
Was that his imagination or did the vibration dim? He hit it again, and again, and kept hitting it until it finally stopped. Then hit the rest until they deflated. Or mostly deflated. The second penis he’d picked up this week only grew harder when he slapped it with the stack of papers, twitching eagerly with each blow.
"Along with a note telling him where to stick it, yeah."
"Potter! What! You!" Robards stopped in front of them, his breath harsh in their faces as he sputtered over the horrible whistling.
realistic. Malfoy knows because Ministry bureaucrats require potential Splinchings to be signed off by a Healer. Malfoy's just been the one on shift."
Apparition was empty when he arrived, which, after years in the never-quiet Auror Department, made him feel off-balance and wary. He passed Rosemary's desk, and then opened the door to his office. "Arthur?"
Harry glanced back up, taking in Malfoy's expression. He looked all prickly and huffy, but something in his face or his voice hinted that Harry's answer was in fact
good. They brought chaos at best, and mounds of unnecessary paperwork at worst.
He glanced around the room, but everyone seemed to be staring at him. He lifted the lid, and peered inside at… well.
Harry spared another moment to be grateful he wasn't a Healer. "Oh."
Malfoy, flushed and gasping. His hair was a mess and his lips were cherry red and swollen. Harry rocked his hips forward, his hard cock rubbing against an answering hardness, and there was a thump as Malfoy's eyes drooped and his head dropped back against the wall.
So when he got the memo that another cock had been discovered on Friday, dread settled like a stone in the pit of Harry’s stomach because if it was another CopyCock, it would almost certainly be worse than the last.
a kneazle. Persimmon is a purebred kneazle, a shining example of
"No, Pavlovian."
Harry took a closer look at the cock on the ground. George was right. It was… sparkly. Not just glistening slightly, but covered with silver and gold glitter. "Oh, what the fuck?"
Malfoy rolled his eyes, and muttered something about "Section 109-J-17" and Hermione was off again.
I waited three to five days for a response and when I didn’t get that I contacted you via interoffice memo, and all I learned is that the lot of you—”
The cock reached the end of the table and seemed to curl in on itself a little, tensing, its bollocks swaying in a way that reminded Harry of a cat wriggling its hindquarters as it prepared to make a jump.
"Hey, Rosemaaa—oh. Good morning, Mrs Periweather."
"Deal." Pansy raised her hand above her head, snapping until the barkeep rolled his eyes and sent a pint her way. She slid it across the table in his direction before leaning forward until his vision was filled with her face and cleavage, and grinned at him. "Spill."
"Good to be back." He took a large slurp of tea. "Did you miss me?"
Now that she mentioned it, Harry was pretty sure he could smell something burning. It took him a few seconds to connect the smell of burning cardboard to the box in his hands. Which was currently on fire.
"Granger's not the only one reading the dictionary, I see."
Malfoy grinned, glancing down at the cock in his hand. "Guilty."
Harry sent him a glare, and couldn’t help but notice how Malfoy looked much better than he had the last time Harry had seen him, though to be fair it might’ve been that the lime green robes and the harsh lights of St Mungo’s didn’t do terribly flattering things to his complexion. Made him look all washed-out and sickly. Sometimes Harry was surprised that Malfoy, vain as he was, had signed on for a profession that involved lime green clothes and harsh lighting. Or that he hadn’t had his father buy up St Mungo’s and change the uniforms. Or something.
He could do lie-ins until May.
Malfoy would be the only one who would know to change the original instruction.
“Don’t ask,” Ron said.
He groaned.
“Right. Thanks,” Harry said, not even attempting to keep the sarcasm out of his tone.
"The trauma. It just seems a big word for meeting some old lady and her kneazle."
After a moment, he pulled away again. "Normal people ask to meet up for lunch. Or dinner. Or whatever."
Seamus leaned in the doorway. “You seem frustrated.”
Ron shrugged.
Harry hated his life.
was just unfair. The look on Kingsley’s face darkened and intensified, and Harry’s protests died in his throat. “Right. Rosemary.”
He gathered up a Containment Receptacle and the paperwork, took a deep breath, and went to the Apparition Point specified in the report.
The slip of parchment had been tucked away beneath the Cockmonster’s rather impressive set of bollocks, and Harry spared a moment’s thought to be grateful that Bartram obviously hadn’t removed the cock from the box and discovered it, otherwise that meeting would’ve been a lot worse. Harry didn’t even want to think of Bartram’s outrage if he’d seen it.
One particularly purposeful twitch made the exam table wobble. Harry shuffled over a bit to hide behind Malfoy.
Harry resisted the urge to ask what exactly about his face, and instead focused on how grateful he was for Ministry-issue heavy woolen robes, which were doing an excellent job at hiding the fact he was
Harry shrugged. "Now that exams are over, I think Rosemary's handling most of it. That and sticking a trainee in to babysit. Pretty quiet there most days when there aren't any cocks."
Rosemary laughed. It surprised Harry whenever it happened, but she seemed to have a good sense of humor. He avoided saying anything about her schedules, though. Just to be safe. "Why you ended up in your neighbour's bath is what
Malfoy turned to the vase and rummaged around in it. The latest CopyCock was still mostly-hard when he pulled it from the flowers, but he still gave it a few strokes, probably more out of habit than anything else. “Form?”
“Leave the poor boy alone, Pans,” he said, sounding positively cheerful.
"Insufficient Deliberation." Rosemary nodded sagely, taking a large slurp of tea. "It always fucks with Destination. But look on the bright side, you're the biggest non-Splinching incident to hit the Department in the last decade. You'll be the stuff of legend until something better comes along."
He hadn’t bothered to ask Rosemary for more detailed instructions because if she hadn’t offered them, he figured he wouldn’t need them. And indeed he didn’t.
Harry was increasingly suspicious that Malfoy was fucking with him. “I am most certainly not inclined,” he snapped.
"Potter." Malfoy gave him the briefest of nods before crossing to the exam table and reaching for the stack of parchment.
It was a mistake, encouraging her. Harry really should have known better. Did know better, in fact, but if an enormous fake cock wasn’t an excuse for his temporary lapse in judgment, Harry didn’t know what would be.
“That’s… surprisingly nice of you,” Harry said.
walking into St Mungo's with that thing on display.
"That they enchanted? It's got…" and Harry leaned in, glancing around the office. He lowered his voice because he knew if word got out, he’d never see the end of it. "It's got
. Her revenge on Williamson (a truly demonic bit of shift scheduling which the sods in WR insisted was legal but still left him unable to determine what day or time it was for a month) after he'd complained about her not getting him a file quickly enough was still the stuff of legend.
And then he stood and made his escape, heading straight for the tearoom where he found Ron stirring sugar into his cup of tea. He looked up when Harry walked in.
Malfoy continued to blink at him. "So… any sex toys found by the DMLE are now your job?"
Ron shrugged. “Guess not. But when it was you, it was funny. Anyhow, I figure Bartram’s still kicking up a fuss about it. Must’ve been whinging an awful lot to get the case kicked over to the Unspeakables.”
“I was very close to her for most of my formative years,” Harry said. “I can’t help it if I’ve picked up a thing or two.”
"Sure you can skip it. If you want those wankers down in Boring Archives, Records & Filing sending the file back and requiring you re-fill the entire thing." Her smirk grew into an amused grin. “They’ll send you a nasty memo about it, too. Someone down there loves sending memos. You’d make their afternoon if you gave them half an excuse to send another.”
On Tuesday, Harry found himself actually hoping for a new cock to appear, just for the chance to pop over to St Mungo’s and maybe see Malfoy again.
The elf gaped, and then turned to dash further into the house. Harry followed, slamming the door behind him. Once inside, he looked around, trying to determine the best place to give Malfoy a piece of his mind. He could hear the elf squeaking frantically from somewhere deeper in the house, and he spared a moment to regret giving Malfoy the home field advantage.
And didn’t
in the bullpen…" Harry muttered, looking around his small office. Then he blinked when Rosemary tossed a balled up bit of parchment at him. "What was that for?"
None did. It was still his life. He sent another half-hearted memo to Filing to see if they'd located his evidence, but he knew it was mainly just for the record of having done it. The evidence itself was lost, but it wasn't his fault if he kept asking for it. Or something. At the very least he was giving those wankers another excuse to send him a snide memo.
"First of all, no. Second, have you
Well. Harry had been pondering what to do with a case he couldn’t close on account of not wanting to arrest either of the guilty parties. But he supposed Hermione would just make the whole thing conveniently disappear.
"Glad to see you back." He nudged Ron over and stole one of Harry's biscuits. Harry took another as the plate was beginning to look very picked over. Then he put it on his desk, standing in front of it, hoping to block the view.
Still, no matter the reason for it, Harry had to repeatedly suffer through watching Malfoy’s long fingers wrap around cock after cock and wank them firmly. He tried and failed to avert his gaze as Malfoy stroked, frowned, and stroked some more.
.” She snapped her fingers twice. “Come on, Harry, Apparition Accidents occur in Muggle areas more often than not, as you should know.”
Someone, somewhere, hated him. Someone with an extremely warped sense of humor.
And because his life went like that, when he arrived at the pub, Dean and Pansy were sitting in the booth together, arguing about the placement of Orsino Thruston's wedding pictures in the special edition of the
this wasn’t deliberate.
"That's
If he’d been asked just ten seconds earlier, Harry would’ve said with one-hundred-percent certainty that scooping a disembodied penis off the cobblestones was the absolute lowest point of his day. But ten seconds earlier, Harry wouldn’t have known that he’d be forced to present said disembodied penis along with an inch-thick stack of paperwork to Healer Malfoy.
The only good thing about stomping into Spell Damage after lunch on Saturday with his cock in a hat was that Malfoy looked as miserable as he did. "That's not a Containment Receptacle."
Harry waited for him to go on, for some snide comment or subtle dig about their past history. But it never came. Malfoy just stated the facts calm as could be and turned back to his paperwork.
"Did it by chance look something like this?" Kingsley placed a box on the table before him. It was white and appeared to be lacquered and very expensive, the sort of box Harry would associate with fine jewelry or fancy perfume. Harry pulled it closer and saw
He spent his walk through St Mungo's feeling rather grateful this call came in late enough to head immediately to the pub after.
"Because wishing for something better to come along is like that Chinese Curse. The one about living in interesting times? And I don't want to deal with anything more interesting than Tuesday."
“Potter,” Malfoy said, his face suddenly very sympathetic as he reached out and touched his fingertips to Harry’s forearm. “Are you defending it? Do you… feel
Healer Reynolds gave him an odd look. “Is there anything else you needed from me?”
It attracted a lot more notice than he wanted, as the chair had begun to squeak as soon as he crossed through the doorway. Heads poked out as he passed, but Harry ignored them as he continued on, pushing the chair and box and cocks along the hall.
The ride up to Spell Damage was one of the most awkward experiences of Harry’s life.
Harry threw up his hands. “Why do you think I did anything to it?”
“Persimmon is a kneazle,” Hermione explained.
Harry nodded and left.
Malfoy noticed, because of course he noticed. He snorted. “I think it likes you.”
Over in Bad Cock Corner, the Vindaloo cock began to vibrate, and Harry sighed and hit it with a Levitation Charm so it could shake all it wanted without bringing down the whole shelf or exciting the other cocks. The shelf wasn’t quite tall enough to accommodate the Vicious Cockmonster when it perked up all the way, Harry had learned. That’d been rather a low point in the case for him, prying a fake cock from where it’d wedged itself in his bookshelf. He only counted himself lucky that no one had been around to witness that.
No such luck, then. And Pansy was like a barnacle: sticking tenaciously where she was least wanted, and sharp enough that he had to be plenty careful in getting rid of her. And, oh. Now she was giving him a look like she could tell that he was drawing unflattering comparisons to sea creatures, and Harry was almost afraid she knew what he was thinking. She couldn’t, could she? He was mostly certain she didn’t know Legilimency.
Malfoy brandished the cock at him again. “Touch it, Potter! This is important.”
“Harry Potter and the Case of the Cursed Cocks?” Seamus suggested.
want to know. Have some practice going there?"
“Possibly because I am,” Harry said, letting his head thud against the back of the chair. “This case is cursed. That’s the only explanation.”
“Fine, fine,” Malfoy said, putting it back down on the exam table. “But I really did have a point. It’s not just sensitive; it’s only sensitive when it’s near
"No. No, no, no, no, no, no."
start worrying about it?"
Harry tilted his head back, nodding Ron toward the shelf. "Out of the way where I don't have to look at them."
“I feel like this just gets more and more ridiculous,” he sighed.
“Ah, yes,” the Mediwitch said. “Let's see, we've just had our shift change. I'll just check to see who’s on now...” She rifled through her paperwork. “Ah-ha, here we go!”
"Potter!"
“Well,” said Harry, tucking his hands into his pockets. “Yes.”
"Oh, god."
“Five minutes, Potter,” Malfoy snapped. “Five more bloody minutes and my shift would’ve been over and you would’ve been another Healer’s problem.”
For the first time since this whole mess had begun, Harry hoped Malfoy would be the Healer on duty. This whole thing was horrible, and the one small sliver of silver lining in all of it was that he got to drag Malfoy into all this horribleness right along with him.
"Potter!" Pansy looked up as he slid onto the bench, and grinned at him. "I've been hearing rumors...."
Honestly, they were freaking him out more than a little. He and Malfoy spent a while testing Number Six, just out of a morbid curiosity to see what it would do. It trembled at the sound of his voice from behind a closed door. It throbbed when he touched it. Most entertainingly, when they stuck it to the exam table and Harry walked around in a slow circle, it swayed toward him like a compass needle following magnetic north. Harry insisted on putting it back in the Containment Receptacle after that. He’d made it this far without seeing how realistic any of the cocks were when they ‘came’ and he’d rather like to keep it that way.
"You get that fucking wanker here right this instant, or so help me I will arrest him at work and make the biggest fuss I can cause and he will
Malfoy made a face. "Point taken. But it's true that I like big things… like… vo-cab-u-la-ry." And at that, Malfoy picked up the new stripey cock and gave it a brief wank.
“What was that, Potter?” he asked without looking up as he inked his quill.
The call for the third cock of the week came in just before Harry left for lunch on Friday. Still blissfully ignorant of what was to come, Harry took it as a bit of well-deserved serendipity when the location turned out to be the Apparition Point near that new Indian place he’d been meaning to try. Even when he got there and realized he’d forgotten to bring along a Containment Receptacle, his good mood didn’t waver. He just took out the foil box his lunch came in and used the paper takeaway bag to pick up the cock and transport it back to the Ministry.
“What’s going on?” Harry asked. He squeezed past Ron and found Hermione briskly packing away the cocks into a cardboard box.
Harry groaned and pulled his pillow over his head.
) position.
"Yes."
would be fantastic as far as Harry was concerned, but especially not today. When a standard
"Even though it's sparkly?"
Harry shrugged, placing the cock on the shelf and then crossed to his desk, closing the folder in what he hoped was a casual fashion. "I don't know who'd want any of these."
. He placed the BDSM Cock, Vindaloo, and Sparklepenis on the shelf which he mentally dubbed the Bad Cock Corner, and where they hopefully couldn't cause him more trouble. After a moment’s deliberation, he put Vicious Cockmonster over there, too. Not because it was ill-behaved, but the throbbing sort of freaked him out. He wheeled his old chair into the front corner beside the ficus Neville had given him, and peeked under the hat, prodding the cock half-heartedly with his wand. Just in case Seamus's Sticking Charm had finally worn off. Which of course it hadn't. Then he put the others on his desk, lined up as he'd done in Apparition, so anyone passing by would know he was working on it. Them. Cocks.
“Hardly,” Malfoy scoffed. “You always wear those stupid shoes.”
The Patrolman coughed again, and Harry sighed. The cock didn't twitch. He leaned down slowly, placing the open receptacle beside it. Still nothing. He finally rolled it slowly, carefully, into the box using the lid, just in case his touch triggered… something.
So much for professionalism. Malfoy was an arsehole.
“Sorry,” he muttered as the doors opened on floor three and he elbowed his way out, fleeing the lift as fast as he possibly could without resorting to knocking anyone over. “Sorry, ‘scuse me, sorry.”
When the doors slid open, Harry shuffled inside along with several other people.
As he spoke, the flowers rustled and Malfoy went very still.
"You're needed," the Auror said, gesturing across the hall. "If you'll follow me?"
Malfoy simply shot him a look, before he smirked. "Who wants to have sex on the job, anyway? Much less fun than advertised and more trouble than it's worth."
The first thing he noticed when he arrived at the Apparition Point at Diagon Alley was the half-dozen people standing around. The second was George Weasley, crouched over something on the ground. Harry groaned, pushing his way through the crowd and past the Aurors blocking the Apparition point.
But before she could continue, there was an apologetic tap on the lintel. "Sorry, but Harry, you need to get that form signed off before Kingsley starts asking questions."
"Problem with Polyjuice, or the cocks in general, is they give no indication how the real thing would behave when faced with similar circumstances." And Malfoy's hand was moving quickly, dragging Harry closer to the edge than he was ready for. And Malfoy still managed to sound like he was giving a fucking History of Magic lecture while he was doing it. "So while I can experiment, wank, whatever, the reactions are inherent to the device, not to the model."
was a surprise.
"I'm sorry, Harry." Hermione wiped her eyes and took a breath, looking distinctly not-sorry. "How long did you have to wait at the groomers?"
Harry blinked, realizing the scuff was no longer in his eyeline, replaced by Kingsley's annoyed face. "Sir?"
Harry sighed and held out his hand. “Where is it this time?”
She gave him a look that had entirely too much pity in it for Harry's comfort. "I expect we'll be seeing a lot more of each other in that case." She put out her hand. "Muriel," she said.
Harry stared intently at a small scuff mark on the wall directly behind Kingsley's left ear, trying to keep his expression smooth and neutral around the headache pounding in his head. It was completely unfair that he was being reamed by his supervisor first thing Thursday morning, when all he wanted was to drink a dozen cups of tea and take another headache potion to deal with his hangover.
Malfoy laughed. "Why? Did you?"
Hermione looked at him from across the table, the dim light of the pub doing absolutely nothing to hide the amusement in her eyes. “Rough day? Usually you don’t start asking existential questions until you’re three or four pints in.”
while you were Polyjuiced as me?"
Much like the vibrating cock had when Harry had resorted to percussive maintenance to control its malfunctioning spellwork, only a few seconds passed before the sparklepenis was back to shooting sparks from its tip. He could hear the sharp fizzle-hiss from within his bundled-up robes.
Harry just grunted in response.
Then Malfoy turned back toward him, with his arms extended and a terrifyingly intent expression on his face. He moved slowly but steadily towards Harry, cock held out in front of him like some sort of perverted divining rod.
Which was of course when his Floo chimed and the Ministry Welcome Witch's voice carried through his flat: "Auror Potter, please report to Apparition
Malfoy waved him off, his quill skritching quickly across the papers spread over the table before him.
On the table, the cock was now doing a repetitive reaching... thing. Stretching in a way he had never known a cock could do, before springing in again. The table was starting to wobble rather rhythmically, and Harry spared a moment to hope the soundproofing of the rooms held, as it sounded rather like he and Malfoy were… well. Like they were doing something that would get them written up at best, fired at worst, if they were doing it on the job.
Then again, all of Harry’s friends were arseholes. Maybe it made a strange sort of sense that Malfoy should eventually join them. Although, when Harry’d thought to himself he needed new friends, this wasn’t quite what he had in mind.
Harry sighed. “Vindaloo,” he said, then mumbled, “Might’ve spilled some on it.”
"Harry!" Arthur beamed up from his position in Harry's visitor's chair. He had a Muggle magazine on his lap, opened and displaying a picture of an engine. "Good to see you! I was just going to leave this here, but Kingsley sent around a note saying anything like this needs to be brought immediately to your attention. And I didn't want to bother you at home… Work and home should stay separate, I know! And I wouldn't want to stress you!"
And in any case, Harry figured that as a Healer, Malfoy had probably put his hands on far worse than penis paper. “Right,” he said. “Carry on.”
Harry said nothing, as he eyed the shadowed specimen jar closely. He simply opened the Containment Receptacle and tilted it toward Seamus.
"Well it worked. You flirted back."
“Erm. Came like that.”
“It’s my understanding they’re for Splinched body parts, not sex toys,” Harry said, feeling a bit silly even as he protested, because mismanagement of office supplies wasn’t something he’d ever concerned himself with before.
“Mrs Periweather,” Ron said at the same time Hermione chimed in, “Persimmon?”
He'd just made it back to his desk when it hit him. He rushed to his case notes, flipping through until he came to the 68-J Malfoy had signed off on, the one that was a bit charred about the edges. He'd duplicated the page, replacing it with a clean copy when Filing had sent it back to him for being defaced.
“Yeah, all right,” Harry said. He lingered for a moment, looking around his blessedly cock-free cubicle, then followed Ron down the hall, feeling better than he had in a long time. Aside from his arsehole friends and a new boyfriend who apparently thought that eighteen fake cocks was an acceptable way to woo someone, Harry’s life was entirely back to normal.
"What are you even doing here?"
"Tearoom's just through there; be a love and bring me one, too."
“Is that smoke?” wondered a woman from behind Harry. “I could swear I smell smoke.”
. And this one was still in its box and everything.
“Why do you always think it’s something I did?” Harry asked. “Okay, the vibrating vindaloo prick was my fault, I accept responsibility for that one.” When Malfoy gave him a sharp look at that, he rolled his eyes. “Promise I didn’t spill curry on this one. I found it like this.”
"What's up?" Harry whispered to Rosemary as he took in the frantic scrambling of blue and red robes.
“Come on,” Ron said, nudging Harry’s arm. “Let’s go see Kingsley so you can sign off on the transfer, and then I’ll get you caught up on the break-ins case.”
involve some amount of bickering.
And that made the best noise of all: a half-choked moan as Malfoy’s grip went lax around Harry's cock and he began to spill in hot wet spurts over Harry's hand.
A glimmer of light caught Harry’s eye, and he turned quickly to see ripples fading from the surface of his drink, though he didn’t think he’d bumped the desk. Frowning a little, he held himself very still and quiet, watching warily, but nothing more happened. Probably just his eyes playing tricks on him. It’d been a long week, after all. He ate another bite and picked up his paperwork again.
of careful breeding whose esteemed lineage is longer than my left arm. Persimmon is the fucking pinnacle of kneazle-dom.” He huffed. “I called Persimmon ‘just a kneazle’ and Mrs Periweather hit me with her purse.”
“Don’t forget when you got called in on your day off so that Arthur Weasley could give you a replica of your own—”
"I'm not wearing gloves." Harry grinned and reached out, giving it a poke, and watched it bob in Malfoy's grasp. Malfoy huffed a sigh as Harry batted his hand away, finally grabbing his cock and giving it a tug. “It’s a very nice specimen. Lovely proportions. Couldn’t ask for a nicer looking cock, really.”
With that, she turned around and strode off, head held high and somehow managing to look regal and imposing even with a box full of cocks, her march down the corridor accompanied by a loud buzzing and bright bursts of sparks. Halfway to the door, slightly tinny notes of ‘God Save the Queen’ echoed back to Harry and Ron. Hermione didn’t even flinch.
to become common knowledge, I suggest you set a good precedent here.” He and Ron stared at each other for a moment, then Harry laid down his trump card. “I’m not above spreading around pages of form 68-J. You know how Malfoy feels about gingers.”
And then realized that whatever bastard had done it (Harry’s money was on Seamus) had also stolen his lunch.
"Potter?" Harry turned to see Malfoy standing in the doorway, wearing his lime green scrubs and looking completely bewildered.
"Nah. Something I wanted to try."
"Why, yes, Hermione, that sounded completely convincing."
"No, she just thought you were hungover." Hermione took another bite, chewing quickly. "And I'm glad that you're getting some use out of it. You should read things beyond case notes and Quidditch periodicals."
Harry came into his cubicle, smiling in spite of himself, only to find the expression fade abruptly into worry when he saw Seamus spinning in his chair. He thought back to his earlier idea, that Seamus was somehow behind this whole thing, and wondered if it was true.
It was a rhetorical question, but Hermione piped up, “Oh yes, it’s one of the things the Ministry really ought to change. I’ve written several letters about it to the Wizengamot already, but now that you’re working in Apparition yourself, perhaps we could—”
"Couldn't risk Kingsley deciding you needed an Auror liaison to help you out," Seamus added.
Which was utterly mad. And Harry thought maybe he should be annoyed at how much time Malfoy had made him waste over the past couple of months. But, especially knowing Malfoy’s stance on unnecessary paperwork in general, there was something undeniably sweet about him suffering through stacks of pointless forms just for the excuse of spending time with Harry.
“Something like that,” Harry said.
He couldn’t help it, he laughed a little bit too. Thought briefly about making a joke of it, about how back in school they should’ve charmed the Snitch into cocks and Malfoy would’ve beaten him every game because he apparently had no trouble catching those. But no, he shouldn’t say that, Malfoy would probably take that poorly, and Harry had sort of enjoyed the lack of antagonism of today’s visit.
Rosemary shooed him off with a rather threatening promise to keep in touch, and then Harry dropped the hat over his penis and wheeled the chair out of Apparition and down the hall through DMLE.
Harry had a moment to find the entire situation strange, that he and Malfoy, regardless of how they'd been dancing around each other for weeks, had managed to make it to the half-naked and snogging part, when Malfoy's eyelashes fluttered again, and he turned a baleful gaze on Harry.
Harry aimed another kick at him, and hit the chair leg this time instead. Even though Harry hid his wince this time, the amused look Ron sent him said that Ron knew exactly what had just happened.
was avoiding all mention of them.
He took the lift up to the fourth floor, sharing the ride with a young lady who had large bunches of broccoli sprouting from her ears. They exchanged awkward smiles when the doors opened, and Harry gestured for her to go first. He let her approach the desk before him since she was suffering actual spell damage whilst he just had a cock in a box, and while the Mediwitch tried to explain to her that she needed to fill out paperwork before she could be seen by a Healer and the young witch asked "What?" a lot and cupped her palm round the green florets blocking her ears, Harry stared idly around.

, he supposes. They don’t look like they’re going anywhere anytime soon, unless that somewhere is a large saucepan. Or whatever you’re supposed to cook lobsters in.
“Draco,” Potter whispers, but then his hand brushes down the vulnerable skin of Draco’s neck and catches on something behind one ear. Draco flinches, tries to shift back. Potter holds him still with a surprisingly strong grip.
“Easier said than done, for some,” Draco says, grinning.
“Barely,” Weasley says.
“Quite right. He finished the milk too.”
“I don’t—” He can’t help but look at Potter’s mouth. Someone’s cleaned the blood away and he’s biting his lip, his teeth white against the flesh, eyes wide. It’s stupid and frankly sort of— mortifying, unacceptably
He finds Ron in the kitchen (reassuringly dressed like a normal person and not like he’s just walked off the set of an eighties workout video) eating a bacon sandwich and frowning down at the sports pages of the
Draco says nothing. He hasn’t finished the book yet, though it’s not hard to guess where it’s going.
Potter rolls his eyes. “Don’t be a prick,” he says, and shoves his own onto his head.
There’s a dull thud and something that sound likes a quiet curse and then Potter’s there, of course, three floors below. Draco watches him come into view; he must have climbed out of his own window.
Doesn’t stop Draco from half-hoping he’ll follow him out.
“What on earth are you going to
The door opens onto a small hallway, more doors off to the left and up ahead, a rusted pram still pushed against one wall and the stairs to the first floor only a couple of paces from where they stand, huddled in the entrance. No one seems to want to be the first one to go any further.
Harry nods, ignoring the parts of his body that fight against it, which is all of them. The temperature’s dropped whilst they’ve been walking and he watches Draco wrap his arms around himself, bouncing on his feet a little, wishes things were less of a mess and that he could just pull him into a hug until he’s warm again.
“No.” Draco cuts him off because he’s talking about the Polyjuice. “Not— what’s going on?”
Potter laughs. It’s a surprise -- it still is every time Draco gets that response. “Muggles do it.”
“Wait, wait,” Granger says, stumbling over to kneel down alongside him. “You’ve lived this before?”
The party’s ok, though. Teddy’s having the time of his life and all of Harry’s favourite people are there. Draco looks good, tanned, which means he’s probably been spending more time working at the ground station than Harry thought, and it feels like a small, weighty punch to the stomach when Harry sees him and knows he can’t go over there and just— bury himself, like he wants to, but he gets past it and it’s easier, then, a little better each time, like exposure therapy.
“Your mattress is so soft.” Potter pulls a face.
He detaches himself with a soft, wet sound but stays close, breathing against Potter’s cheek. One of Potter’s hands comes up and sifts through his hair again, the touch so careful that the gentleness of it aches more than the damned scalp laceration. Draco lets him, distantly aware of Weasley still ranting away in the front seat.
Draco rolls his eyes. “She’s exclusively off men,” he says, crawling over Blaise so that their hips press together. He gives a half-hearted thrust, bites his lip, tries to listen for any sign of Potter next door.
Draco hums, eyes flicking up from his Transfiguration text to Potter’s profile.
. Even these tiny shiftings of his hips are about to do Harry in. There’s no way he’s missed the press of Harry’s cock through those leggings.
For all his expletives and demands when Harry had his hands on him, he’s being almost unbearably gentle now. Not silent — he’s still making small, encouraging noises as Harry lies there and doesn’t breathe beneath him — but quieter. His touch is softer, more tender.
“Yes?” Harry asks. It comes out breathless, which probably doesn’t help the situation. Or significantly
The sun’s still out, its lingering heat warm for April, and the light turns Draco’s hair gold.
She asks it completely casually, like it’s perfectly normal for Draco to be in Harry’s bed at all, let alone planning on sleeping there for an entire night. Draco could freak out about this if she let herself. Or she could follow Harry’s lead and pretend like it’s not a big deal. Only one option gets her a warm, full bed for the night, so it’s not difficult. She nods.
“Who?” Granger asks.
“Depends.”
“He’s doing it on purpose,” he says slowly.
“Don’t know about that,” Draco says directly into Potter’s ear, feeling her squirm away as her breath hits Potter’s skin. “I barely had much time to
Ginny looks at him, deadpan. “You don’t care about anyone else bringing people home. Hell, you should try being next door to Dean and Seamus, they’re at it all hours.”
She stops and they both freeze, listening for the telltale sound of music from the other side of the wall.
“I doubt we’ll see much of each other, then.” Draco’s dropped Care of Magical Creatures, the only other lesson he shared with Potter.
Draco knows it’s going to happen a second before it does. The hand twitches, harder, purposeful, and the jet of ugly, familiar orange light singes Draco’s side as it skims him and hits Potter, who makes an awful, gurgled noise and drops, his hands clutching at Draco’s jumper on the way down.
Potter snorts. “Don’t get excited.” He looks tired, propped up with one arm on the table opposite Draco. Draco smiles at him, he can’t help it.
His brain, sluggish but still awake, doesn’t feel quite ready to sleep yet but he figures might as well go up to bed. Potter and his ex-teammates aside, most of the people still awake are Hufflepuffs, and that’s too much to ask anyone to deal with in the early hours of Saturday morning.
Draco opens the window and catches the rock before it can smack him in the face. It’s pathetic how good it feels, to close his hand around the smooth stone, to relish in how his reflexes are still there, instinctive, despite the fact he hasn’t been able to get on a broom since he was on the back of Potter’s.
times before. Like he’s
It felt important for Harry to say, though, to make sure Draco understood. This— whatever it was between them, was hard enough without throwing Harry’s unwanted celebrity status into the mix.
“Well.” There’s cool silence for a moment, just the waves and the blood pounding in Harry’s head. “I thought it was, but maybe I’m wrong.”
Harry laughs, all deep and tired and says “Sorry,” not sounding very sorry at all and then, “You really have to start calling me Harry. That wasn’t just a— sex thing.” She shifts over, sitting up slightly to unhook her bra with a noise of relief and then hanging off the side of the bed to reach for her wand, pointing it at the lamp to turn it off. Then she flops back down onto one side of the bed.
“Yeah,” Potter says. “It’ll be weird, though. Everyone back.”
Weasley grins again. “No,” she says. “Ron did.”
“Potter,” he says again. “You really have to wake up,” and then, ironically, he passes out.
He can’t decide if not being able to talk to Draco makes it easier or not. On his end, the horrible, tender feelings stubbornly refuse to die, so maybe it’s for the best. He’s not sure that he’d be able to remember why it was a good idea for them to break it off in the first place if he saw Draco’s face. At least after that disastrous Florida visit, the radio silence had felt necessary. Now he wants to talk to Draco because friends
charm, doing so without comment.
Malfoy moans next door, as if in confirmation, and Harry resists punching his pillow. It isn’t even late, barely past 4pm. Far be it from Harry to condemn a man for having a nice, late afternoon wank, but
Harry feels his hands bunch in the fabric of Malfoy’s oversized shirt, just like he imagined, and  Malfoy whines into his mouth. Even at this, even just kissing, he’s loud. Some distant part of Harry is vaguely impressed he can make so much noise when he has a mouthful of Harry’s tongue. He pants and murmurs, presses closer and crosses his ankles behind Harry’s back so that his thighs squeeze tight around Harry’s waist.
Draco’s kept busy for the next couple of days — a
Draco’s pretty sure Dolohov already knows, can probably see them from the window. He fights an urge to groan out loud in frustration. It’s not that he blames Potter for his skepticism, he knows the story sounds ridiculous, but he
“You’re bleeding too, you know,” Potter says after a bit, starting to shiver.
“Mhm.” All these years spent watching Potter and Draco somehow never noticed his slightly crooked front tooth. It’s a minuscule thing, a tiny overlap, but Draco can’t look away.
Heads turn as he enters, but he’s ready for them.
Draco stares at him. “Excuse me if I’m not at full social capacity at” -- he glances at the clock on his bedside table -- “quarter to one in the morning.”
Blaise’s eyes narrow. “And you should get off
Malfoy looks up as he enters, eyes him as he pauses in the doorway. “Good game?”
Blaise kicks at him with one foot. “I
“Hi,” Potter says, nonsensical. Their faces are very close together and there’s blood in Potter’s eyelashes, red framing the green of his eyes. How appropriately fucking festive.
“Look,” Malfoy breathes quietly into the space between them, when Harry makes no response and there’s a prolonged pause. “Word is, you’re a little jealous, Potter.”
The next morning, Harry pulls himself out of bed and into the shower, already reasoning with himself. He had a lot to drink last night and Malfoy had been louder than he’d ever heard him. Practically shameless. Harry can’t be blamed for getting turned on by such things. It’s a natural reaction.
manages to get Draco with a nasty battering hex that dislocates his shoulder, even as he’s lying on the floor with one hand cupped protectively between his legs.
She looks unhappy about it, but she lets Potter stuff them into his pocket.
“Oh, we both know you love dramatics, Dray, don’t be stupid.” It’s an old nickname, something Draco hasn’t been called since the start of sixth year and it makes warmth flood, rusty and unexpected, into his chest. Blaise’s smirk slips into something closer to a real smile and Draco can’t help but grin back. Every cold stare he’d felt on the back of his head when he’d walked in suddenly feels a little easier to deal with.
“Sorry I’m being so--” he waves a hand and then clenches it into a loose fist in mid-air, letting it fall with a noise of frustration. “ I don’t know.”
Malfoy notices his sharp intake of breath. He moves his hand slowly further up and Harry freezes.
to open the door without summoning the whole fridge.
It tastes pretty bad, because Potter has a mouthful of blood and Draco doesn’t have any kind of vampire fetish thanks, but it’s still good, more than good, more than Draco’s ever let himself hope for.

was painful. This is nothing.”
All four of them hold their breath when Potter tests the front door with his wand, Draco feels the collective pause, but nothing happens. Potter carefully pushes it open and nothing happens then, either.
It’s just that it doesn’t exactly
Potter doesn’t answer, seeming to consider this as he sinks back down into the water and comes up with his hair all wet. It doesn’t even sit flat when it’s soaked, still curling ridiculously in several directions. Draco deliberately looks away.
Draco scowls and says nothing, determinedly ignoring the way the tension in the room has lessened already.
“Of course you got to
Except he can’t shake the thought that he’s stuck in this loop for a reason. The chances of it being a completely random coincidence are slim to none and he’s a
“It’s mulled wine,” he says before Draco can ask, crawling onto the newly-positioned desk and then wobbling off it.
“Okay,” Granger says after the twelfth call for a rematch. “Who’s taking first watch?”
Potter laughs loud enough that a bird takes off from somewhere on the roof.
Harry directs his castle forward and tries to ignore the odd number at the top table that keeps drawing his eyes like a magnet.
Draco laughs, soft, his breath misting the window for a split-second before it fades. “I’ve seen it a hundred times.”
“And that’s a bad thing,” Draco says after a short pause where he tries to decide if replying will make Potter shut up sooner or only encourage him. His voice comes out all tired and sleep-rough.
Draco comes home for Teddy’s birthday that spring. It’s been over half a year, and Harry’s infinitely grateful that Andromeda thinks to mention it beforehand rather than leave Harry to be confronted with an unexpected reunion at a children’s birthday party. They’ve emailed a bit back and forth, he and Draco (Harry going out and buying a computer solely for that purpose and pretending to himself that he needed it for work), whenever Draco’s been back on base, but they never really
But Draco just shrugs. “If you really want. We could make it happen.”
“Do you think we’re the first people to do this in space?” Harry asks a little while later, voice snagging at the end when Draco slips a wet finger into him. They’re using real lube, from a bottle stashed under Draco’s bed, because magic’s so temperamental up here that every spell is monitored and catalogued by the maintenance team. Not that Harry’s bothered about anyone figuring out what they’re up to, it’s just— strictly speaking, they’re only supposed to cast when it’s absolutely necessary and he doesn’t think this qualifies.
self-awareness, you know—”
“I wish it would snow.”
The way
It’s not until they run into each again, completely by accident  — on the tube platform at Bond Street, of all places, the chances have to be astronomically tiny — that Harry even knows if Draco’s ok or not. Nothing, for eighteen months and then suddenly, there he is on the other side of the tracks. They stare at each other, the hot wind of an approaching train blowing their hair around their faces. Harry waits with his heart in his throat as the train obscures his view for a long minute, terrified that when it pulls away again Draco will be gone with it, off to wherever he’s headed or worse, never actually there in the first place, just a figment of the secret, guarded part of Harry’s imagination that still hasn’t quite stopped waiting, hoping. It wouldn’t be the first time his brain’s turned traitor on him.
“Bit, ah, early isn’t it?” he asks, nodding his head at the drinks between them and desperately trying to avoid meeting Malfoy’s
“I really am sorry,” he’d said to the ceiling, even though Draco looked like the only reason he wasn’t smothering Harry with a pillow for apologising
The thing is, Harry’s quite drunk. And the thing about
The fact that Malfoy is apparently sleeping with half of London (whilst Harry himself remains alone and unbothered to go out and find anyone to bring home) can’t even explain Harry’s frustration, because the noise annoys him even when Malfoy’s by himself.
His determined justifications do little to actually stop him feeling horribly guilty and he resolves to try and put the whole incident completely out of his mind, which turns out to be easier said than done when he comes downstairs to find almost everyone he knows (and a couple of people he doesn’t) bent over in workout gear in his sitting room, including Malfoy, who’s at the front and is wearing leggings.
going to pass out and either he dies or I wake up back on that street and have to do this all over again.”
going to make this weird. After all, Malfoy still doesn’t know Harry listens to him getting off, definitely doesn’t know that by this point Harry has gotten off
Draco spends the next day walking around the grounds, trying to put the odd reunion with Potter out of his head and focus on cataloguing what’s changed. He’d done the same back at the Manor on September 1st, feet restless, body itching to be doing something without the usual rush of a new school year to occupy it. They’d only been living in a couple of rooms all summer. He’d felt like it was time for one of them to get over themselves and assess the rest of the house, and it wasn’t likely to be his mother.
“What, that fish market that opens at 4am?”
Draco comes to standing up. It’s a weird sensation — he’s never woken up on his feet before and it disorientates him for a second. It’s the first thing he’s aware of, being upright, and then the second, immediately after: a dull pain at the back of his neck, like an oncoming headache only more localised, pinching at the base of his skull and behind his ears.
“Are you doing Potions this year?”
“I kissed you,” he says, like Potter might have forgotten. “And the loop..”
“Buy something decent for God’s sake,” he said on his way past, knocking his shoulder gently into Harry’s. Harry felt the bump, warm all down his arm, all the way to the supermarket.
“What about waking me up?”
When he finally heads inside to sleep, he finds his bedroom ceiling lit up, covered all over in glow-in-the-dark stars. If he cries a little bit, thinking about Draco standing on the bed, casting the same sticking charm over and over, he decides that’s ok. There’s no one there to see him.
“Same difference,” Potter says, and pulls him in again.
Grimmauld is convenient for uni and for work (yes, a job, how plebeian, and it pays like shit but at least it
Hermione sighs, slumping back into her chair. “I know. I just
Harry doesn’t like to dwell on it too much.
to think of Draco in that way, because he already spends too much time thinking about Draco in other ways. Like worrying about whether he’s sleeping enough, or caring about how awkward he feels around their friends, or wondering what Draco’s opinion on Harry’s new broom is. He doesn’t need to think about Draco naked.
Harry tucks himself away, shame flooding him. He just wanked over his friend. In his kitchen. Like an animal. He feels exhausted, spent and sticky, and he knows he can never,
“Am I a terrible godfather?” Harry asks, his voice small. Draco’s hand is so warm on his back, and he feels so comforted and safe.
It’s just embarrassing, that’s all. Because he’s thought exclusively about Draco for nearly a month, and because the feelings he had for Draco are definitely becoming something more, and let’s face it, he’s never been great with people he’s liked. Memories of trying to ask Cho to the Yule Ball creep into his mind, and suddenly he’s standing in front of his friends with his cheeks on fire.
“I think you’ve been in love with him for a while, mate.” Ron’s lips curve into a wry smile and Harry leans forward, needing some blood in his brain. He has no idea what to do. He’s shit at this love stuff. Ron is much better; he has Hermione and he hasn’t fucked up his relationship with her. Harry’s in love with one of his friends, and he has absolutely no clue what to do next. He doesn’t even know if Draco likes him back!
He opens the magazine with shaky hands. It’s a wizarding magazine, and there’s Draco, at least five pictures of him, leaning and moving and smiling. Pictures of him bent over a desk, sitting on a broom, behind a large white peacock. And the middle spread, a full two pages of him, laughing into the camera, one hand lazily holding a potions book—a large potions book—over his groin, the other running through his hair. His body is lean and defined, his neck a smooth column, that inviting V pointing to the book, his legs slender. He’s fucking gorgeous, and Harry’s cock twitches, his chest tight. Draco looks at the camera and winks.
“Do you want me to want you to?”
“All of it?” Draco asks, and Harry drops the magazine on the floor. He brings his hands to Draco’s hips, angling his so he can feel Draco’s cock, hard against him.
They wander around the room looking at the paintings. Dean has painted them all. There’re sketches of them talking and laughing, of Seamus sleeping and eating and talking. Big paintings of Dean’s parents and grandparents. A delicate watercolour of Hermione, looking proud and strong. A vibrant oil painting of Luna grinning. They’re stunning.
It’s never made Harry feel left out before, but after three weeks of fantasising about a man he already had a huge crush on, it stings a little to see them.
Draco Malfoy is naked in a magazine and it’s ruining Harry’s life.
“Now?” Draco drops his trousers, his dick straining against his pants. Harry’s mouth waters.
*****
A laugh, pale skin. Grey eyes. Blond hair. Rounded arse, that smile as he lifts his hand to run it through his hair.
“What are you doing?” Ron asks as he walks into the flat. Harry shouldn’t have given him the spare key. Ron looks around the room, letting out a slow, long whistle. “Bloody hell, mate. You’re not handling this well.”
It’s getting ridiculous. Harry tightens his legs around his broom and hopes that no one will notice that he looks uncomfortable. His cock swells in his Quidditch leathers. He is at
“I came as soon as I could,” Draco says as he jogs into the waiting room. His hair is flying into his eyes, his t-shirt is tight on his pecs, his legs long in black jeans. He looks worried and flushed, and Harry’s cock twitches in his pants. He groans internally. He’s worried sick about Teddy, and his cock still can’t behave itself. He is the worst human being in the world.
“How are you feeling about the speech?” Draco asks, and Harry relaxes. Draco thinks he’s uncomfortable because of the speech. Which, to be fair, he is uncomfortable about. The erection is just adding to the discomfort.
Fuck knows he’s not good at moderation at the best of times. If he saw Draco basically naked, he’s worried what would happen.
The thought of being naked, of having the camera on him, was both terrifying and titillating. He’d ignored the titillating part.
“Edward Lupin,” the Healer calls, and Teddy slips off Draco’s lap, wandering off with small, determined steps. Harry and Draco stand, walking close together. Harry can feel Draco’s hand brushing against his. His erection is still there, not fully hard, but definitely not as non-existent as it should be. There’s something wrong with him. He bites the inside of his cheek.
“I have no idea,” Harry replies, feeling shaky, his voice cracking. “I looked away for one second and he’s fallen off the broom. It’s only a test broom! It flies three feet off the ground. I don’t know what happened…” he trails off. Draco’s hand is on his back, rubbing small circles, soothing him. It doesn’t help the situation in Harry’s pants.
“Do we need to talk?” Harry asks, pulling his clothes off, following Draco’s lead. Draco's suit jacket, shirt, tie, socks litter the floor, and Harry’s t-shirt and jeans join them.
The food arrives and Harry lets Hermione stew for a moment as he digs into his pasta. It’s warm and comforting. Hermione finally sits up, taking her fork and stabbing at her penne. They eat without speaking, the clinking of their cutlery loud in Harry’s ear. He knows that Hermione will break first, because Hermione likes having the last word and she hates being wrong, and because he can see her thinking through an argument.
annoyed. Ron carries on, clearly pretending that Harry is involving himself in the conversation. “Ginny says Blaise has a copy in their bedroom.”
“Do you have your wand?” Draco asks. He sounds tired.
Training had been hard, especially as everyone had been talking about the damn magazine. It seemed that the positive reviews about the interview and photo shoot had prompted their manager to contemplate getting a few of their star players to do a similar thing.
“Exactly!”
Harry can’t breathe. He’s standing so close to Draco, close enough that he can feel the heat coming from Draco’s hand, hanging at his side. Close enough that he can appreciate the soft curve of Draco’s lips. Close enough that he could brush his erection against Draco, if he just angled his hips differently. Draco smiles softly at him, moving a fraction closer, and something in the air around them crackles. His erection isn’t going down.
“You’re being really brave though, Ted. Braver than I was when I broke my arm,” Draco says.
He walks into the gallery, taking in his surroundings. Portraits hang around the room, thick brush strokes of oils and detailed watercolours. Pastels and sketches and even a portrait of Seamus asleep done in embroidery. Dean is really very talented, and Harry lets himself marvel at it for a moment. The room is lit with soft candle light, and there are trays of champagne floating around. A Muggle band that Harry vaguely recognises is playing over the speakers. It all feels like a wonderful blend of magic and Muggle and Harry is overwhelmed by it.
“Yes.”
“I don’t know, mate. Talk to him?” he says. Right. What a sensible idea. Except!
It’s not a voluntary reaction, he’s aware. He has trained his cock to swell at the sight of Draco, because he’s been wanking over Draco’s picture, and exclusively Draco’s picture.
“I think you should have shown us more,” Seamus shouts, and Dean rolls his eyes, slinging an arm around his boyfriend’s shoulders.
“You love me.” Harry strips his pants off, standing naked in his bedroom with the man he loves, the man he’s been wanking over for weeks, staring at him. His cock is leaking, his body too full of adrenaline to concentrate.
“Why did you?” Harry asks. They walk for a few more steps as Draco formulates a reply.
supporting Draco. I can support him without looking at him naked,” Harry hisses, trying to regain his balance as they land. Hermione raises an eyebrow at him and stalks towards the restaurant. The waiter looks startled. Harry knows how he feels.
They stop in front of a collection of charcoal sketches. Harry can't take his eyes off the movement of the lines, the thick black strokes, the white chalk against brown paper. The biggest, sat in the middle, is a captured moment of Draco and Harry. Draco’s face is turned towards Harry, his jaw sharp, his mouth tilted up in a secret smile, his eyes light as he looks at Harry. Harry isn’t looking at him; he’s laughing at something beyond the paper.
“Anyone want another?” he mumbles as he walks away, knowing he won’t be heard. Ron arrives at his elbow two steps later.
guilty. He hasn’t done anything wrong. Well, he hasn’t done anything illegal. He wonders for a moment whether wanking over your friend is illegal, and decides there would be no way to police it, even if it was. He can feel that his blush isn’t going away, and he is resolutely not looking at Draco.
Out of lateness, rather than stubbornness, he’d not looked at the magazine that morning either. He’d barely managed to grab his training leathers and a piece of toast as he’d rushed from his flat. He rarely regretted not living in a wizarding house, but that morning was one of those times.
“Again, thanks?”
“I’m fine,” he mutters. Everyone eyes him suspiciously, but goes back to talking to Hermione and Ron about the speech. Harry takes a deep breath and turns to find Draco standing next to him, looking worried.
Harry walks into his flat, heading straight for his bedroom. He opens the magazine that’s lying conspicuously next to his bed. Read the interview. That’s what Ron had told him to do. He’s not read the interview before, just wanked over the images of Draco naked.
Draco looks at him, very seriously. “I do.”
“Ignore him; we can’t leave early.” Hermione rolls her eyes and starts to straighten Harry up, making his tie neater, and pushing his hair back in a vague attempt to make it behave. She never used to care about the way he looked before, so he scowls at her.
“I love you,” Harry says, kissing Draco’s neck, licking and nipping at the pale, smooth skin.
The friction of being inside someone, a blond someone, with grey eyes and a smile that lights them up. A deep growl, delicate fingers. That V that points to a cock. Blond curls trailing down from belly button to cock.
*****
Harry has spent all day thinking about Draco, and it’s starting to cause problems. In his pants. Serious problems.
“Ron!” Harry sits up, glaring at his best friend. Ron is the planner. Ron is the strategist. Ron is the one who makes it all make sense. Everyone knows that. Ron looks at him for a long moment, clearly enjoying the anguish that Harry is in. Harry is about to say something suitably snarky when Ron sighs.
Harry feels sick.
It takes Harry a couple of reads to really understand. Draco loves someone. Someone who pulled in from the fire. It could be a metaphor. He could mean someone who helped Draco when he was first struggling after the war. But Harry knows, in his bones, that it isn’t metaphorical. If there had been someone else, Harry would have known. There isn’t anyone else. It’s him.
“It’s not a treat!” Harry half shouts, catching himself before he can be too loud. He looks behind him to make sure none of their friends heard. Draco is sat in the middle, laughing with Hermione, looking every bit the model he is in a tight black t-shirt. Objectively, Harry knows that Draco is hot. He’s a model. It is literally his job. But Harry has never thought of Draco in
“Don’t be damp, Harry.” Ron laughs, pushing Harry into the room. He’s right, Harry knows. He defeated Voldemort. He faced death. He needs to get a grip. He gives himself a shake and grabs a glass of champagne. Ron claps him on the back, hard, and Hermione comes to stand between them, linking her arms with theirs.
*****
They push the doors to the events room open and are greeted with soft classical music barely audible underneath the roar of conversation. The room is packed with witches and wizards drinking good elf wine and talking subtly about politics. The light is low, candles hovering around the room, and Harry can see house elves popping around with food and drinks. Harry hates it already.
“It hurts,” Teddy says. Draco nods, moving to sit next to Teddy and putting an arm around him. Harry relaxes into the chair and watches Draco with Teddy. He loves seeing them together, the soft way Draco talks, the gentle ease of it. When they’re talking like this Harry can see the family resemblance. The straight nose. The pointed chin. The shrewd eyes. Draco’s gaze flicks to him again, and he gives a small, soft smile, before pulling Teddy onto his lap.
Ron looks at him triumphantly. And Harry wishes he hadn’t opened his mouth.
“Two please, somewhere quiet,” Hermione says, her hand still on his like a vice. They weave through tables, and Harry has just enough time to note how nice it is, big windows enchanted to show a Tuscan sunset, a big glass chandelier, cosy booths with thick red table clothes. He’d love to come here on a date. Or at least with someone who wasn’t frog-marching him everywhere.
seen them, but I know you, and I know you’re avoiding them. So why?”
Draco.
He has, instead of the parties, not cooked for himself in a week or bothered to clean up the takeaway containers. He’s been watching repeats of old TV programmes, when he’s not at training, and he can’t remember the last time he cleaned the flat or his training leathers. They’re sitting at the end of the sofa in the open kit bag emitting an interesting smell that Harry hopes he’s usually flying too high for anyone else to notice.
Draco Malfoy is naked in his bed, and it’s significantly improving his life.
“Not really?” he says, although it sounds like a question. Hermione grunts, and looks back at her menu. There’s something wrong, and Harry can’t figure out what it is. He’s a little scared to ask. The waiter shuffles over, looking as petrified as Harry feels, and Harry gives him a reassuring smile. Harry gives his order, and Hermione barks hers, and the waiter scurries away. The look Hermione gives Harry makes him wish the waiter had stayed.
“We should all buy something,” she says. “Use our ridiculous fame for some good.”
“It’s in my pocket. On the floor,” Harry replies. He’s also tired. Draco groans but gets up to grab one of their wands. He waves it, muttering a spell, and cleans them both off, before getting back into bed. Harry holds an arm out, and Draco curls into him. Harry sighs, contentedly, and feels Draco go heavy against him.
He can feel himself becoming infatuated. As if he wasn’t already.
It’s Dean’s art show, and everyone is going to support him, unless they want a beating from Seamus. Harry would have gone without the threat of a beating, but he appreciates Seamus being overprotective of his boyfriend. He’d like to be protective of someone, someday. As long as that someone is Draco.
“Why would any of our friends have a copy?” Harry snaps.
Something in his pants.
“Dean is so talented,” Harry says in an attempt to sound normal.
His life is moderately less ruined by Draco when he knocks on Harry’s door the next day. It’s Harry’s day off, and he was going to spend it cleaning his flat, but he’d much rather be spending time doing literally anything else.
They walk in silence in the direction of the park, along a route they take often. Harry enjoys these moments, walking in gentle silence with someone he feels he can be completely himself with. Sometimes they walk for hours in silence. Sometimes they talk about nothing. Sometimes Draco starts a serious conversation, like he truly is interested in Harry’s opinion.
He takes a step back, muttering words that even
“I think it’s broken,” Teddy says, looking down at his arm. It doesn’t look broken to Harry, but he is in no way a Healer, and Teddy is looking very very pale. They’re sitting in the emergency waiting room at St Mungos, the plastic chairs are uncomfortable and the light is harsh. Harry doesn’t like it here. Maybe if he’d been a better guardian he wouldn’t have to be here.
“You should be nice to animals!” Teddy sounds indignant and Harry chuckles, memories of a cocky, arrogant Draco flooding his mind. Memories of Draco shouting at him across the Great Hall, of gloating about his broom, of making ‘Potter Stinks’ badges. He helpfully chooses to forget the memories of Draco being an actual terrible person. Draco looks at him, grimacing, clearly remembering the same things.
No, it’s that Harry hasn’t seen it.
He’ll catch the snitch, win the game, and deal with the erection thing later.
He greets his friends, avoiding looking at Draco and praying to some deity or other that he doesn’t look guilty. Not that he should
He’s absolutely not going to do it again. It was reprehensible that he did it before, and it’s clearly going to cause a problem! Harry closes his eyes, willing himself to go to sleep and stubbornly ignoring his rapidly swelling cock. He is not going to wank over Draco Malfoy. Not again.
He flips the page open, ignoring the pictures and starts reading. It’s a very standard interview. They talk about Draco’s mum, his modelling career, his charity. Harry knows it all, has spoken to Draco at length about it. Has been there to see most of it. He has no idea what Ron could have been talking about.
“I haven’t.” A car drives past, and Harry glances over at Draco. His nose is so straight, his lips curling slightly at the corners, even when he’s relaxed and not smiling. Harry takes a deep breath. “Do you want me to?”
Fuck it. Harry tugs his cock out of his shorts and pants, not bothering to shove them down, and starts to rub a hand over it in quick, tight bursts. There’s no finesse. He doesn’t bother to tease himself, just watches as the image of Draco moves, winking and smiling. He has a beautiful smile. There’s a trail of blond hair leading from his belly button down behind the book. Harry knows what it must lead to, and his imagination provides an image.
“Harry, I’m close,” Draco pants against Harry’s mouth and Harry nods. He slides his hand between them, taking Draco’s cock in his hand and rubbing his hand in time to his thrusts. His brain is filled with Draco, his body tight, his balls aching, and then he feels Draco tense beneath him, as he comes. His hole clenches around Harry’s cock, sending him over the edge and ripping his orgasm from him.
she’ll want to talk to Draco, and he absolutely can’t have that.
“This isn’t fair either, Hermione. I’m allowed to talk to Ron,” he points out. Which is true.
“He’s a good friend,” Harry says to stall. He doesn’t want to tell Hermione about his crush that has definitely gone away. If he tells her it becomes more real, and he doesn’t want to deal with it. She’ll insist that it’s something they should talk about, or she’ll want to do some reading, or
“Hermione, he looks fine. Let’s go,” Ron takes her hand and drags her away. She looks at him, and he shakes his head. A little conversation that Harry isn’t privy to.
Harry takes a mouthful of food and chews it, watching her. No point in giving in too easily. He swallows and takes a sip of water. When it’s clear Hermione is about to break, he leans back in his chair and clears his throat. “Because I have a very small crush on Draco, and I don’t think seeing pictures of him naked will help me get over it.”
Hermione and Ron are waiting for him at the door to the events room. Ron is in smart black dress robes, also not done up, and Hermione is in delicate blue dress robes that are, their heads bend close together as they share a whispered joke. They look good together, happy and confident, and Harry realises he’d quite like something like that. An easy happiness. Or, no. Their happiness isn’t easy. It’s fire and passion, and a deep respect. Ron is the only one who can tease Hermione about her lack of cooking skills, and Hermione is the only one who can joke about being the more intelligent of the two of them.
, crush on Draco. Who wouldn’t? He’s witty and smart and dedicated. Those are very sexy qualities in a person, and it’s a good thing that Harry hasn’t thought about what Draco would look like naked, or how hot he is or else his crush might have developed into something a lot more, and that would be bad for everyone.
“This isn’t fair, Harry! You can’t tell Ron something and expect him not to tell me; I’m his girlfriend! And I’m your best friend!” She sounds upset, and the guilt curls in Harry’s stomach, which he pushes to the side. He should have told her, probably when he told Ron, but he couldn’t. Sometimes Ron is just easier to talk to. And it’s up to him who he tells about his ridiculous romantic feelings.
*****
The magazine sits offensively next to his bed.
Draco Malfoy is ruining his life.
“I am handling this fine,” Harry says indignantly. He pauses as his brain catches up with the words. “Wait, what am I handling?”
“Don’t be dramatic. You’re taking me out for lunch,” Hermione replies. “Be quick.” Her tone doesn’t allow for disagreement, as it usually doesn’t, and so Harry grumbles as he pushes his way into the changing room. He contemplates not having a shower and just forcing Hermione to sit with him smelling like sweaty balls and old leather, but he feels so disgusting he quickly dismisses the idea. He has a quick shower and changes into a worn Weird Sisters t-shirt that was a hand-me-down from Charlie and a pair of shorts that are tight on his thighs. He waves goodbye to his team and heads out to see the more annoying of his best friends.
“I think it’s really tastefully done,” Hermione says, her ears a little pink. Draco is lounging in his chair next to her, smirking. Harry used to hate that smirk, when it was directed to him. But after a year of Draco making heartfelt apologies, testifying against his father in front of the Wizengamot, and setting a newly single Ginny (mutual decision, as Harry has told many, many people) up with Blaise, the smirk softened, and Harry could recognise it as something else. A sort of awkward defence when Draco was feeling embarrassed. Five years later, and Harry’s starting to find it
They weave through the crowd, grabbing a drink off an elf wearing socks as gloves. Harry can feel his pulse in his fingertips as they get closer. Which is ridiculous because it’s just his friends. Dean and Seamus, Ginny and Blaise, Luna, Pansy. His friends. And Draco. Just his friend.
Harry stares at Ron, not sure he heard right.
“I’ve been wanking,” he says to Ron, in a vague attempt to make himself feel better. Surely Ron will know what to do.
It’s a sunny day, warm and filled with summer lethargy, and Harry can’t think of anything he’d rather be doing. He nods, slipping into his Converse and grabbing his keys. Draco waits for him patiently, as he always does, arms behind his back. He looks good, Harry knows. His hair flops into one eye, short at the sides and long on top, emphasising his long neck. His clothes are cut specifically for him, and they fit tight to his body. He’s stunning.
“Why would I want to see a picture of Draco naked?”
can’t make out, and leaves.
“He’s holding a potions book in front of his actual dick.”
Harry spends over himself with a shout, the orgasm tearing through him, blinding and intense. His balls ache with the force of it, his legs shaking and his eyes watering. His chest is covered in spunk, thick and hot, and he removes his hand slowly, sinking deeper into the bed as the realisation of what just happens floods him.
Draco must have known what he was doing when he said that. He must have known that Hermione or Ron, or even Harry would read it and know what it meant. That Draco loves him. That Harry saved him, and he saved Harry, and their lives that have been so intertwined for years may join together. The knowledge takes Harry’s breath away and he stares at the words as they swim in front of him. He feels light.
“What are you doing?” Draco asks as Harry opens the door. Harry grins at him.
“That’s what I was hoping you’d say.” He gestures behind him. “Fancy going for a walk?”
“More than I’m worth,” he mutters, and everyone rushes to assure him that’s not true. They’ve seen the pictures. They’ve read the accompanying interview. It was wonderful. He looks wonderful. He
it's my case, I'd be responsible for about a hundred kinds of mishandling of evidence."
And he cursed himself, because that was totally not what he wanted to say to get on her good side, but she cackled. "Oh, you sure did, didn't you? I heard Savage was spitting nails when he took the call. Eight Obliviators out of their beds at half two, all on overtime. Kingsley gave him a right bollocksing."
Harry sighed again as he waited his turn for the Floo. He rather wished Rosemary would do more explaining and less ominous cackling. One would be useful. The other was just annoying. Really, it was enough to make Harry miss Kingsley and his stern looks.
"And Rosemary just stood there behind Mrs Periweather and laughed at me the whole fucking time. Kind of like you, you arsehole." Harry aimed another kick under the table, this time
that I made sure you have multiple copies of mine?" Malfoy paused and raised his eyebrows. “And need I remind you that mine liked you best?”
Malfoy snapped on his gloves, flipping open the Receptacle. "Mm. And I could be calling you a dickhead. You'll never know."
He rolled his head to the side as his gaze slid toward the cocks. The Cockmonster looked even more monstrous from this vantage point, towering above him like some sort of horrible throbbing monolith. He didn't think he had a shoebox big enough to transport it, and he was
"It didn't come from an Apparition Point. Was left with Arthur Weasley."
“You needn’t look so cheerful about it,” Hermione said primly, pausing for a moment to cast a spell on Creepily Clingy CopyCock’s canister lid to affix it firmly in place, so that none of the Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder could spill out in transit. “I’m very busy. Right now I’m in the middle of overseeing forms 76-D, -G, and -J, and it’s really quite…”
“What about him?” Draco tries to snap, pushing down into the now steady rhythm of Blaise’s hips. “Shit. You should take your trousers off.”
As illicitly appealing as the idea of the roles being reversed is, Harry can’t be sure Malfoy won’t just lord it over him. He isn’t stupid enough to risk a lifetime of humiliation, and regardless, he isn’t interested in getting off with some nameless somebody, for reasons he’d rather not think about too deeply right now.
“Why do you even
Potter’s still laughing, though it’s muffled because he’s holding Draco’s head still and his hands are sort of covering Draco’s ears a bit. He kisses Draco’s cheek again, then the other, his forehead, even his nose. Draco can feel the skin bloom pink everywhere his mouth touches and he almost wants to squirm out of reach, except the smile on Potter’s face is difficult to look away from.
“Killing
Granger starts yelling, “No, the bag, my
Someone’s pinned a frankly ridiculous badge to the front of Potter’s top, which is long sleeved and far too casual for this place, tucked messily into denim shorts. Draco’s gaze gets lost somewhere around Potter’s thighs because Merlin
Five days later it’s Thursday, Malfoy is getting off in his room, making noise, Harry is lying on his bed, going insane and resigning himself to the fact that this is probably how it’s going to be for the rest of his hopefully short life. This is the state of the world now, and Harry has to accept it, even if he isn’t happy about it. He’s come to terms with worse.
“You invited me in!”
When Draco knocks on the bathroom door that evening, the reply comes, distorted and echoey through the wood. “I’m in the bath.”
,” Draco says again, like it’s a competition, like he needs to get it out now as many times as he can before they’re miles apart, and walks out into the Florida sun.
Dolohov laughs at him.
, he thinks,
“Ok.” He stays where he is, outside, leaning on the window frame, maybe sensing that Draco’s not in the mood. “Why?”
The thing is, Potter already knows she saw the match because she’d seen her there, Draco dragged along by Pansy to get pitch-side comments after the game was over. Potter had just touched down, sweaty and grinning from their win, which had been very close, snatched at the last minute by a pretty spectacular catch from Potter that had put her team ahead by a mere 20 points. She’d rocked up, pushing tendrils of hair out of her face, giving her statements to the press all whilst shooting Draco these little looks like she knew how good she looked and how seriously Draco was considering the merits of trying to break into the changing rooms later. Draco wasn’t even supposed the be there; it was for journalists only.
“Where are you going anyway?” Potter asks him. Draco looks at him in the mirror, watches as he sits up a bit, pokes a foot out of the water and stares at his toe.
“Bit of a—” Potter tries to say once they’re inside, but Draco finishes for him.
“If you don’t mind,” says Potter. “I don’t think we’ll take your word for it.”
Harry gets the full tour, sees the labs, the bridge, the area where they’re growing food under carefully controlled charms (he thinks of Neville), even the engine room (he thinks of Hermione, threatening to confiscate his
phase,” Hermione says. “If I had to watch that scene in the engine room one more time—”
“Is this going to become a thing?” Draco asks the following night, pushing his window open all the way before Potter can throw anything at it. He hadn’t been sitting there waiting or anything, it’s just that Potter has never been particularly subtle and Draco heard him walking around.
Granger, predictably, freaks out.
Potter doesn’t even smile. His face is quickly going slack and he still hasn’t opened his eyes. Draco wants to shake him, can feel himself getting woozy with panic. His head swims and the car jolts to the right as Granger overtakes a line of cars, speeding down the road.
“Funny, I don’t remember you crouched over my body trying to keep my intestines from falling out after you so rudely tried to remove them,” Draco snaps, the sick, worried feeling in his stomach sharpening his words. Potter only smiles at him. They’ve had that conversation already. That conversation is the whole reason Draco’s even here.
He’d closed the window before he got into bed, the first time since he arrived, because he can feel a cold coming on, the back of his throat odd and tight when he wakes up in the morning, and he doesn’t want to make it worse. He’s regretting it now though, unable to find the energy to get up and open it again, or even to roll over and find his wand. The room feels stuffy and close without the outside air filtering in and it’s making him restless.
They get a frozen turkey. Granger defrosts it with her wand and a distinct look of distaste once they’ve traipsed back out into the snow and found a safe spot to apparate, getting the tent and the protective enchantments up in record time because it’s too cold to be standing around in the Forest of Dean at the arse end of the year.
Ron does’t actually wait for an answer, just switches the channel and vaults over the back of the sofa so that he’s sitting on Harry’s shins. Harry shoves him off half-heartedly.
He finds it hard sometimes, not being able to share this whole other part of his life with them, if only because he knows how happy even the simplest of charms would make them, how big their eyes would get if he levitated their carefully constructed models and sent them spinning through the air in their own little orbits. But rules are rules (someone from the Improper Use of Magic office had actually made him

She waits for Potter to nod and leans down to kiss her again, just once, because she can, before she slides further down the bed. When she pops the button on Potter’s shorts, Potter pushes herself up onto her elbows to watch and helpfully lifts her hips up so Draco can slide them down her legs, throwing them somewhere behind her. Draco finally,
Ginny pinches him painfully in the side and he yelps. She fake-moans again, eyes dancing with mirth.
“I know it can be shit,” Potter says anyway, like Draco asked for an explanation. “I shouldn’t have assumed you’d be awake.”

blush, and Malfoy has already left, taking Harry’s jumper with him.
should step it up if you want him to hear you through these walls.” His smile widens when Draco, unable to help it, lets out an embarrassingly loud whine and tries not to writhe on the bed.
Potter shrugs easily. Draco watches him walk off in the direction of the lake until he disappears round the side of the castle.
to, her reputation is at stake — cut her off with a kiss, deep and filthy and much more appropriate for her image.
were the seven-year-olds at this party,” he says, smile rueful. They’re round the corner of the house, hidden from the main garden and tucked together next to Andromeda’s compost bin.
“I’m trying,” comes her harried response. “I think we’re near Swindon, I’m sure there’s a hospital..”
“Fuck,” Draco says, forgetting to scowl. There’s a distinct thump from next door. Heat flares hard in his stomach. Blaise grins even wider. “Fuck.”
“Before,” Draco says impatiently. So far everything’s happened almost exactly as it did last time, and he doesn’t know how long he has before he or Potter passes out.
He carefully evens the top of the pomade back into an acceptable state, raking his sticky fingers through his hair until it lies the way it’s supposed to (less I-look-like-I-use-a-permanent-sticking-charm-on-my-scalp these days, he likes to think, and more sort of— artfully dishevelled), and heads down to the kitchen to determine whether he has any almost-stale croissants left, the ones he managed to save from the bin at work, or whether Longbottom has gotten there first. Nothing in this house is sacred, or safe from Gryffindor fingers, apparently.
“Oh, you definitely are,” Draco says airily, thanking her pureblood upbringing for instilling in her the skill of coming across as cooly composed when your insides are doing something completely undignified. “Just because you’re a damn good Quidditch player and apparently learned to brush your hair and dress yourself..” She lets her gaze drag up the length of Potter’s body deliberately slowly. “Well, barely, but I’m sure you’ll get there.”
Ginny’s eyes narrow. “And what’s that supposed to mean? You’d have a problem if I was having sex with men? Or if Malfoy was bringing home girls?”
“Hi,” Potter says, voice weird. Or maybe Draco’s forgotten what it sounds like. “I saw you in the window.”
usually get this far.
off like, ok, that can definitely happen but Draco wasn’t exactly expecting it, if she’s honest, she’d thought Potter would probably want to get Draco on her knees just to shut her up. And isn’t that a thought she’s now finding it difficult to shake out of her head.
“Why ask, then?” Draco bites out. It makes Potter turn around, the sharp edge to his words.
Weasley makes a pleading face at her. “Surely we can have a night off.”
Draco, ironically, is momentarily lost for words when confronted with the full weight of Harry Potter, Girl Who Lived, on top of her, bathed in the soft glow. Potter won’t stop
like it’s foreign and suppresses a hiccup, rolls his head back against the bed  -- “but it always stopped being fun after a couple of hours.” He frowns. “I don’t like feeling out of control, I don’t think.”

“It’s not enough, is it?”
“There’ve been wizards in space since the sixties, we’re definitely not the first,” Draco says in answer to his question. “Pretty sure Carter’s son was
Besides, he should be grateful they even get this. He’s pretty sure it’s usually reserved for family members, but seeing as Draco’s not married and wouldn’t talk to his parents even if they were living next door, they must have made an exception.
next weekend, if people didn’t mind, and they were all welcome to invite whoever they wanted, in fact, please could they, because most of the people Harry liked already lived with him and if they were going to throw a party, it should probably have more than ten guests. Malfoy wasn’t there but he’d smirked awfully at Harry when he caught them all on their way out to buy booze.
“Happy New Year, Potter,” Draco says, and another round of fireworks goes off somewhere behind them.
Surely, though, that has to be because he practically has a front row seat to all of Malfoy’s evening— activities. He’d be the same with any of the rest of them. If Ginny or Luna or Neville or Seamus and Dean, or — God forbid — Ron and Hermione were keeping him up half the night with their obnoxious sex noises, he’d be annoyed at them too. But they aren’t, and he never thinks about what they get up to. Or not much, anyway. Out of sight, out of mind and all that.
Draco spends a long time kissing him goodbye. They stand on the rug in front of the fireplace and Harry closes his eyes so he won’t look at the clock above the mantelpiece and licks the taste of wine and chilli and lemongrass right out of Draco’s compliant mouth. Draco tugs him backwards when it’s time, not releasing his hold on the front of Harry’s jumper until the flames are green and he’s mumbled the address for the Portkey office into Harry’s chin. Then he’s gone, spinning away, one of Harry’s hoodie cords left swinging in the space where his hand had been.
, a reliable, if antagonistic presence in Harry’s life.
. Nausea creeps up his throat and he ignores it, forces it back down. “Seriously.” He pats gently at Potter’s cheek. “Oi, you lazy sod.”
“Yeah,” he says, shrugging. “Not bad for someone that you abandoned on a beach and never spoke to again.”
Potter tightens her grip on Draco’s waist, clearly waiting for an answer and Draco looks down at her, frozen for a second, and then grabs her by the wrist, dragging them through the crowd. She can just hear Potter’s laugh at her eagerness behind her, and she could turn around to remind Potter who exactly propositioned who on the dance floor but that would get in the way of her main goal at the minute, which is to get out of the mass of people.
His friends, at least, are a godsend. He’s not left alone with Draco for more than a second the whole afternoon and he thinks, not for the first time, that he’d be dead without Ron and Hermione, even if on this occasion he means less of a literal death and more of an overly-dramatic, symbolic one, in which his heart simply curls up and dies if he has to watch Draco smile at him like that one more time and not be able to do anything about it.
“Alright.” Potter’s hand is on the gate. “Let’s go.”
There’s quiet for a moment, Draco watching Potter scuff one foot on the grass. He seems unable to shake the grin from his face, smile firmly in place even with his eyes fixed downwards.
The morning of the Welcome Feast is freezing and sunlit. Draco lies in bed finishing
not supposed to remember that. “Bit optimistic.”
He doesn’t care that he sounds insane. He’ll explain it all properly once he’s sure Potter’s not going to die in the back of a car. He knows magic and he knows that, whilst he might be about to loop back to the start again, it’s equally possible that this has just been a one-off, a random blip, and if that’s the case, this is his only chance to make it right.
Draco sees what he’s trying to do, keep talking and then go for the element of surprise. Potter’s good, but he’s also a teenager, whilst Dolohov’s a fully grown wizard with a trigger-happy wand arm and little patience for chit-chat. Potter barely gets his own wand raised before there’s a sound like an explosion and shards of something hit Draco all over, cutting into his skin.
“I’m only kidding,” she says, and winks, which should look ridiculous and not devastatingly hot. “I like that you’re mouthy.”
“So have I,” Draco says, and the ending of that sentence hangs obvious and unsaid, the sarcastic
“Exactly!” Draco spits, and resists the urge to just whack him over the head. He hasn’t tried that yet — if Potter’s unconscious he can’t run in there and get hurt. “So if you could, maybe, I don’t know,
“Ew.” Ginny says.
“Oi.” Potter narrows his eyes, then grins. “I don’t remember doing much walking.”
Potter slaps her arse playfully and they’re both giggling like Hufflepuffs, Draco is honestly never going to live this down.
Christmas, festival-for-a-personally-irrelevant-religion-turned-commercialised-garbage-holiday though it may be, and now I’m stuck in the perpetual almost-there of it all with an idiot who gets himself cut up every time no matter how differently I try and do things!”
“That’s because you don’t know anything about wine.” Draco sips again in what he imagines is a refined manner. The metallic taste is less noticeable the more he drinks, and it’s warm if nothing else. “And they’ve thrown a load of spices in there and let it mull, so. Only a distinguished palette would be able to tell if the wine underneath was of decent quality.”
Harry refuses to speed up, even as Malfoy’s grip in his hair tightens to the point of pain. It’s novel hearing these sounds, the noises he’s come to expect from the other side of a wall, up close. And his name— he’s never heard that before.
Draco’s friendly enough with Ron and Hermione to have been invited, but not close enough that he’ll take time off to fly back and attend. It’s an amicable, unspoken agreement between the three of them: Draco understood the sentiment behind the invitation, Ron and Hermione accepted the regrets he sent via return owl without surprise or offence. The whole thing’s very sensible and civilised, which only makes Harry feel worse about it. He wants to be selfish, to beg Draco to change his mind so that when he’s standing up there, watching his two best friends tie their lives to one another, he’ll have someone in the crowd to focus on, just in case the twinge of pain that’s been threatening to spark fierce and blue in his chest ever since he helped Ron choose an engagement ring starts to overwhelm him. Someone to dance with, to tell him that just because he’s best man for the bride
, Harry’s really missed hearing his name like that, posh and affectionate and disparaging all at once. “As I recall, you were the one who essentially backed me into a corner with both hands tied behind my back.
“Not because he feels sorry for you,” adds Lovegood, somehow knowing that’s where Draco’s thoughts were headed. “He doesn’t mind you living here.”
, like they were on the same side. Maybe they were, in the end, when it mattered, or maybe Draco’s feeling uncharacteristically self-forgiving because, despite his successful efforts to see the year off alone, Potter’s still managed to be the first person Draco sees in this new one, and that seems significant.
“He might not even be in,” Harry protests, half-laughing as Ginny wiggles her eyebrows at him.
“Bastard.”
Grimmauld Place is a big, wizarding house, but it isn’t really a mansion or a manor or anything — there’s only one bathroom per floor, two on the ground floor if you counted that weird water closet no one uses, and it means he and Malfoy are sharing more than just a wall. Annoyingly, everyone’s started referring to the third floor as
Weasley rolls his eyes, counter-argument ready on his tongue and Draco gets up, leaves them bickering happily at the table whilst he goes and pulls the blanket off his bunk and then folds himself down just outside the mouth of the tent. It’s easier than trying to get them to stop, and it’s not like Potter should be the one out here. It’s freezing, and he needs to rest.
“Ok.”
, this is bad, and wrong, probably, and a serious invasion of— something, and maybe Malfoy goes quiet when he comes because his whole body tenses and his mouth opens on a silent gasp or he bites his lip, hard and his eyes screw up and shit, ok, that’s it. Harry rolls over and bites down onto his pillow, breathing heavily into the fabric as he empties himself into his hand. It makes a mess of his sheets but, unlike some people, he prefers not to risk being overheard.
“You started it,” says Draco.
He falls asleep to the sound of Potter’s steady breathing.
Potter holds his hands up, the rock dropping to the ground. “Sorry.”
There’s a bloody queue for the loos, of course, and it’s not long but Draco makes to shove past it anyway. She’s held back by Potter, who tugs them to the back of the line. Draco raises an incredulous eyebrow but Potter only shrugs again and presses Draco against the wall of the dimly lit corridor, so Draco can’t really complain. When Potter kisses her, she all but melts, getting her hands into that long hair as soon as she can and holding Potter’s head in place so she can give as good as she’s getting. No-one pays them any attention, the queue full of girls chatting and laughing and yelling through the open bathroom door for people to hurry up.
if we stop trying. You want some space? You said it yourself, we barely see each other as it is. Any more space and there’ll be nothing
Harry has accepted that and moved on, which apparently means complaining even more to Ginny about the incessant noise until she threatens to bring the old Bat-Bogey Hex out of retirement.
consecutive songs, someone — Weasley, if he remembers correctly, though by the end he’s little more than an orange smudge — foolishly challenging him to a shot contest until they’re both in danger of spending the rest of the night hugging the toilet.
Potter seems to take a second to actually consider the question, which Draco takes as a sign that no, he hadn’t had any good reason to start lobbing things at the window. After a moment he shrugs. “Just thought you might not be able to sleep either.”
Draco might be starting to lose it a little bit. The other three stare at him as they’ve stared at him many,
“No one’s making you stay,” Draco says archly.
and pushes the door open. He politely averts his eyes from where Potter sits looking all wet and annoyed — Draco was right, it’s a frustratingly good look on him — and goes over to the mirror.
plays. They’re loose and almost down to his knees. Pity.
the one they should be worrying about. Draco’s finding it hard to tear himself away, half-scared that the moment he does, the moment he even blinks, Potter’s eyes will close and Draco will have failed, again.
But he does stop, then. Cuts himself off with an expression on his face that Harry finds it hard to look directly at. They walk in silence for a minute, the mood not ruined, exactly, but a little more fragile.
“Merlin, I’m going to have to fucking kill him, aren’t I?”
Draco feels his face heat. “You know. Before. With the frozen— you said your nose was going numb.”
“I went home for Christmas. The Burrow-- the Weasley’s place,” Potter says. “But I’m back here now.”
It doesn’t escape Draco’s notice that Potter starts behaving even more oddly around him after the night of the party. In fact, it starts to get a little unnerving after the sixth time Potter promptly leaves a room just as Draco enters it.
“Morning,” Neville says, voice strangled.
“God,” he breathes, pulling back after a long, close minute. “You sure?”
Draco looks at his upturned face. “Aren’t you cold?”
And then there’s the other— stuff. Noises. When he comes home in the early hours of the morning and Harry’s forced to lie in bed, the sounds of Malfoy and whoever he’s picked up muffled but persistent through the wall. Sometimes there isn’t even anyone else, just Malfoy on his own, and he’s still loud. Sometimes Harry wishes the git would take a hint and cast a silencing charm.
“I know.” She drops back against the sofa with a huff.
Harry flicks a glance at him. “You’ve seen
Weasley makes a low whistling noise of appreciation, but Draco doesn’t have time to enjoy it, Potter’s bleeding.
. It feels like weeks since he was last curled up on his lumpy bunk mattress, and he thinks a break from the constant duelling and running and wound-staunching is pretty well deserved by this point.
Harry narrows his eyes. “That’s mine.”
“Right.” Blaise pops the button on his trousers. Draco spares him a glance from where he sits cross-legged at the foot of the bed, wondering if he’s imagining the sound of footsteps on the stairs. “So I can come?”
Malfoy’s mouth twitches. “On?”
Harry stares at her.
Draco tries for a frown but he doubts the expression holds long enough for Potter to even notice it.
“Yeah,” Draco breathes, running her tongue over her bottom lip and pushing her hair back as she catches her breath.
“Dolohov,” Draco says, and then reels off his explanation spiel. He’s gotten it down to a couple of sentences after all this practice. He even remembers to tell Granger to protect her beaded bag.
Draco doesn’t even want to know. Harry Potter: befriender of house-elves. Idiot who’ll risk pneumonia just to sit outside with Draco in the snow. Forgiver of boys who really don’t deserve forgiveness.
“You look good,” she blurts out before she really thinks about what she’s saying and then, quickly, “I saw your match against the Wasps last weekend,” which isn’t any fucking better really, but if she’s going to embarrass herself she might as well go the whole hog.
Potter makes an odd, aborted movement, hands shifting into his pockets. “I’ve been here since summer.”
“I have a house but I’m not living there.” He gestures at what must be a window below that Draco can’t see. “I’m down on the ground floor.”
He’s dragged a chair over to the window and is curled up in it, staring over in what he assumes is the direction of the lake, though it’s near impossible to tell with moon hidden by clouds, when there’s a noise from below and Draco realises he's not the only one who's back early.
Potter shakes his head, ducking it so that Draco only sees his smile for a split second before it’s hidden in shadow. “Are you always like this when you wake up?”
They go on for ages, the noises bursting in the quiet night. Draco thinks about going to bed, thinks about opening the window properly and climbing down so he could try and see them, thinks about last year when he’d sat, miserable and terrified, in the Slytherin common room and wondered if he’d make it through another year.
“Yeah.” Potter stays there, props his head up on one hand. “I should-- I’m going.”
“No,” Potter says, voice flat. “I don’t,” and then gets up and leaves, using the actual door of Draco’s room for the first time all year.
Ginny is sweating. It’s really too hot to be doing anything more energetic than lying on the kitchen floor under a cooling charm, especially with someone who’s currently too distracted to even follow a simple game of one-on-one airborne dodgeball.
It has exactly the effect she intends it to. Potter raises her eyebrows and flips them with strong hands around Draco’s middle in about two seconds, manoeuvring them up the bed slightly so Potter’s leaning against the headboard with Draco sitting between her legs, back pressed to Potter’s front and Potter’s chin hooked over her shoulder. Draco wouldn’t admit it for the all the galleons in Gringotts but having Potter manhandle her is an unexpected rush, the way she could probably easily throw Draco over her shoulder and carry her off somewhere if she wanted.
Ginny only cackles and pinches him again. “I suppose that would explain your silence. Maybe I’ve got you gagged.”
Draco blames his sleep-messed brain for the fact he almost tells Potter he’s never had to try in that regard, not where Draco’s concerned.
wrapped around his cock and—
It’s a good thing they’re in a hospital, because Draco almost opens his chest again for letting him believe in all that power of love bullshit, even for a minute.
“Anyway,” Potter says. “Both. It’s cold here, my nose is going numb and the others’ll come looking for us soon, so this—” he indicates the frozen peas — “is definitely not the time.”
“I know!” Harry cuts her off, unable to meet her gaze. “I know. It’s just.” He stares up at a crack in the ceiling. “Does he have to be so— loud about it?”
Granger overhears. “Ron, the heating.” She takes a hand off the wheel to slap at Weasley’s arm, directing him in a low, impatient voice until he finds a dial in front of him and turns it. Draco feels warm air cough out onto the side of his face from a vent set into the edge of the door and lets out a shaky breath. He doesn’t move off of Potter.
“Jesus,” says Potter, her voice going all deep and catching slightly in this way that Draco wants to hear on repeat, possibly forever. Her fingers feel good in Draco’s mouth, strong, and Draco thinks about having them inside her and shudders, suddenly impatient, pulling them out with a slick noise and shoving them back in the direction of her hips.
Draco hums and takes a sip of her own drink, thankful she’d had it with her when Pansy had pushed her over here — it gives her something to do with her hands that isn’t hook them into Potter’s belt loops like she really wants to.
As it turns out, being just friends with someone you only get to see a handful of times a year is exactly like being in love with them was, mostly, Harry suspects, because he still is. In love, that is, only now there are no more pixelated hybrid Floo/video-chat calls (he’d barely qualified for them as Draco’s boyfriend; ex-who’s-just-come-back-into-my-life-after-almost-two-years is not exactly an upgrade) and he feels guilty thinking about Draco when he’s getting off, on top of the general anger at the universe for keeping them apart that’s been there for so long it feels like a permanent fixture in Harry’s body. Nothing’s actually
Draco ducks his head, tucks a smile into the scarf he’s wearing. “Yeah, it is,” he says after a bit. “Really very stupid.”
Draco sees Granger stowing her wand away and fixes her with a look. She doesn’t even seem guilty for having cast on an unsuspecting Muggle, which just goes to show how much shit they’ve all had to get used to since this started.
Draco blinks. “Well. And you?”
And from there, well. There were only so many midnight chats under the stars, blankets pulled tight against the freezing city air, that you could have with someone before you started noticing the way your pulse reacted to the sight of them in the moonlight probably meant something.
“No,” he says now, rubbing the back of his neck. It’s a habit of his so Draco can’t tell if he’s in pain or not. “It’s fine, honestly. Sorry.”
Still, he brought it on himself. It’s technically his fault that Malfoy’s ostentatious taste (osten-taste-tious?) in food is now cluttering up the fridge — Harry’s the one who offered him the room. He’d just been complaining so much, waving a glass of wine around and talking about how his parents had cut him off and how the commute from where he was staying on Pansy’s sofa to school was an absolute bitch in the mornings. He’s studying at the Muggle uni not far from Grimmauld in fact, is already a year in, an act Harry is convinced was the only thing he could have possibly done to endear him to Hermione.
“Should we—” Weasley starts to say, hushed, prodding at some of the debris with one foot, but then there’s a noise from somewhere and Granger shushes him.
Draco slaps at his upper arm. “Did to, you arse. I only said what I said because you were too chicken-shit to say it yourself. Not because I stopped—”
,” and Potter is shouting too, there’s so much noise suddenly, and parts of Draco are definitely bleeding. The night has gone from quiet terror to outright chaos in less than a second and Draco’s confused, his ears ringing, skin smarting.
“Yeah, I mean—” Potter moves them until they’re lying on their sides, facing each other, joint hands on the pillow between them. “If you want.” She keeps her voice casual but Draco can see the uncertainty on her face.
“Er,” Potter says, and then evidently forgets where he is because he steps backwards into thin air.
“I miss you,” Harry says, wishing he could reach an arm through the Floo and touch Draco’s cheek, even if it would only really be the cold screen of the monitor under his fingers.
“Next time?” Draco asks, her pulse picking up. She hadn’t— she sort of expected this to be a one time thing.
He says
Malfoy moans again. Fuck,
“Dead,” Potter says quickly, sighing and giving her his best orphan look. Draco almost snorts, but she turns her stern gaze on him and he has to school his expression quickly.
Draco sniffs. It isn’t his fault canvas is so flammable.
“What did you do with the car?” Draco asks Granger.
If so, he ponders from the library where he’s resolutely ignoring his textbooks in order to stare out of the window, maybe it’s time to up his game.
“How did you even know he was going to
When he lifts a hand to his forehead it comes away wet.
And he’s hard, obviously. Of course he’s fucking hard, it’s practically Pavlovian at this point. Malfoy could probably knock something off his desk and Harry’s dick would perk up at the thud.
Potter laughs at him. “A gift from your old house-elf.”
“Don’t fall off the bed,” Draco says.
Draco focusses back on his work, ignoring the warmth in his chest.
Potter ignores him. “You always were, now I think about it. Was never difficult to get you riled up.”
Granger interrupts their staring. “There’s dittany in the bag, Malfoy.”
“Alright,” Draco breathes, when they reach it. “Granger.”
Draco’s expression is soft. Their time’s almost up. “Me too,” he says. “Miss you.”
Draco doesn’t get it, personally. He likes Quidditch, of course, and he isn’t above a bit of rough play, but it just seems excessive, the way the Muggles on the telly throw themselves on top of each other. The shorts are— an upshot, but still. Potter doesn’t even wear those tiny, tight ones when
He wakes up in a bed.
“I’m not
Draco cuts him off. “Oh, absolutely not,” he says, and pins Harry back against the brick.
He’d gotten sick three days later. Draco dragged himself into the library to submit his assignments because neither of them owned a computer and then he’d come straight back to Harry’s and made him eat some plain toast and helped him stick all the Get Well Soon paintings his class had sent him to the fridge with magnets.
He can read the blame on Weasley’s face, clear as day, as he helps carry Potter down the stairs. It’s obvious he thinks Draco should have been there, and Granger, too. She’s better at hiding it, but not by much.
He goes suit shopping alone. Every dressing room he stands in he’s torn between wondering what Draco would think, trying to channel his vastly superior sartorial knowledge and wishing someone would Obliviate any thoughts of blonde hair and soft, grey eyes right out of his head.
“You’re an idiot.” Draco rolled over and pressed their foreheads together so hard that the bridge of Harry’s nose hurt. “You don’t have to thank me for wanting you,” he’d said into the space between them. “It’s the easiest part of my day. Every day.”
, Ron— don’t— Harry.” Her eyes fall to the heap that is Potter on the floor.
Hermione is militant; Harry strongly suspects she’s organised the others. They rotate shifts like they’re on a babysitting rota, swapping out and handing him off to one another. Harry’s not annoyed, he knows that when it comes to Draco all his rational thinking goes out the window, but he’s amused that they think they’re being subtle. Every time they’re dragged away from each other, Draco shoots Harry this warm, exasperated look and Harry smiles back, helpless.
anything.”
Draco doesn’t say anything, just stares at him. He looks better than the last time Draco saw him, not that that’s especially surprising. His hair’s shorter, still a mess, but not the tangled length it had been during the war.
He doesn’t say anything, just slots their mouths together like it’s the last piece of a puzzle he’s trying to finish, here: shoulders align, here: lips. Draco presses his fingernails into his palms to stop himself making an embarrassing noise and pretends the lingering taste of hospital gravy on Potter’s tongue is unappealing, for the sake of his sanity.
She stares at him.
It is, of course, insane. Harry thinks he could spend as much time up here as Draco has and still not be used to it. The fact that Draco gets
Ron puts it in the trolley.
Ginny rolls her eyes. “Yeah, but he doesn’t know it’s me in here with you, does he?” She starts shifting up and down on the bed until the ancient springs are creaking.
Or, has Potter realised that he might reciprocate Draco’s—
Draco shrugs. “If you want.”
He heads off to the left, sticking close to the castle walls. It takes him longer than he would have thought to loop them but it feels good to be outside. The sun’s bright in that unexpected, cold way it sometimes is at the end of the year, and the wind chills him enough to keep his head clear.
Draco’s new room is on the third floor and he can see mountains from the window. If he leans out as far out as possible without falling, and stretches to the left, he can just see the edge of the lake, dark and still in the moonlight. It’s the first thing he does the night he arrives because everything about coming back to school feels different and strange this year and being able to watch the water is a small comfort, even hanging halfway out of the window like this instead of with his nose pressed to the glass of the Slytherin dorm windows.
Draco’s new bed is big -- not as huge as the one he has at home, but a good-sized double. The beds in the Slytherin dormitory had never felt too small, exactly, and they’d seemed to grow with the boys as they’d gotten older, but they’d definitely been built for one person. Probably some kind of deterrent, Draco assumes, not that it had ever stopped his dormmates.
“Crackers,” she says when they’re all slumped in their chairs, tired in the warm, drowsy kind of way only a full stomach brings on.
“Sorry,” he says, and Draco sees him wince because he might actually be incapable of whispering and it comes out quite loud. “Sorry.”
Granger tries a non-verbal
“What,” Harry says, wondering if he’s somehow walked into an alternate reality, “is happening?”
“No,” Potter breathes. “I never liked it, even in sixth year. I know I’m supposed to be thinking about what I should do after school, but I though, you know-- fuck it. I want to enjoy my last year here.”
to is what I.. meant. You were staring at my mouth.” He rubs his face with both hands and braces his elbows on his knees, speaking into his fingers. “I didn’t plan on falling out of the window.”
“Don’t spill it on my bed, for fucks’ sake,” Draco says when Potter sends a mug sailing over to him with a flick of his hand. Potter mutters something and then swears quietly when he trips over one of the shoes that Draco really should have learned to put away by now.
“And how’re we gonna do that?” Weasley says. “We can’t Side-Along him like this, ‘Mione.”
“Too many.”
He’d woken up the next day with a dry mouth and that morning-after feeling like your body knows you’ve done something stupid before your brain wakes up enough to remember what it is. They’d had the first (and, to this day, only) house meeting about it, which had mostly consisted of everyone telling him they hardly cared one way or the other as long as Malfoy contributed to the food budget and wasn’t a massive prick to anyone.
It’s usually busy in here, the huge, cavernous space filled with people shouting and casting and working on intricate bits of machinery, but for now, they’re alone. Everyone’s outside, ready for the lift-off Draco’s supposed to be out there orchestrating.
Draco’s sigh is small enough he knows Potter doesn’t hear it.
“Don’t,” he says through his teeth.
.” He says it like he’d pronounced
“Afternoon,” Harry says pointedly around his mouthful.
“Use a different bathroom,” Potter says. He sounds exasperated. His face is probably all frowny and flushed from the hot water. Draco bites his lip.
“Better get another couple then,” Ron says, reaching over her head to grab a bottle in each hand. “What the hell is Jägermeister?” he asks, pausing.
Draco laughs again, leaning into the camera a little.
Harry smiles in spite of himself. “It’s a date.”
He can’t imagine Potter in a club. He rather assumes he wants to avoid the wizarding ones for the same reasons Draco does, and the Muggle ones are hardly Potter’s scene. Most of them are, in Draco’s opinion, either boring or tacky, and Potter looks like he might be scared off by the kind of places Draco and his friends go to.
Potter grins. “Not really.”
“Probably.” Potter shrugs up at him, unabashed.
“Uh,” Harry says, strangled. “Come in?”
having fun makes him want to tear his hair out and shove it in his ears.
Draco gets ready for bed with a strange sense of deja vu that night. He’d followed Blaise to his new room in one of the towers after dinner, noted it was much the same as his own, and they’d talked for almost an hour. It would've felt like a normal first night back, if not for him leaving at the end of it instead of climbing into a bed next to Blaise’s.
“Potter, really.” The hairs on Draco’s arms are all standing on end in the cold air. “I said it was fine.”
“Usually standing outside barefoot instead of lying inside in a
hasn’t seen Star Wars): “Love you.”
. Someone swap with me.”
to think, even for a second, that Draco’s hunch was right, that that’s what did it, what saved them both, him leaning down and slanting their mouths together. But it seems like the only explanation. That’s the one thing he did differently.
“No!” Potter says again, louder. Draco forces himself to meet Potter’s eye, though his expression is uncomfortably earnest and it makes Draco’s stomach tense up. “I didn’t-- I meant to do
“Of course.”
Potter laughs and then sucks air in, harsh, through his teeth, his grip on Draco’s clothes tightening until his nails dig into the skin underneath. “Don’t try to be funny,” he gets out through gritted teeth.
Potter chuckles into his cup. “Mull,” he snorts.
Today had one of those days, all of them eager to take advantage of the good weather, so his head’s still pounding when he comes downstairs after a hot shower to get some food and finds Malfoy lounging alone on the sofa, book abandoned on the floor next to him. He has a headphone in one ear and Harry can hear the music, tinny but bass-filled, from the other side of the room.
bring people home, and I’m the only one in this house you’ve ever slept with.”
Harry doesn’t actually expect anything to come of it, but the next day Draco’s boss (Carter something? That’s what everyone calls him and Harry still hasn’t figured out if it’s his first or last name. Either way, he has the whitest teeth Harry’s ever seen) slaps him on the back and tells him he’s excited to have Harry on board and that’s that. Instead of leaving at the end of the week with Teddy and Andromeda, Harry stays.
“I know,” Potter mumbles, sleepy and indistinct. “S’nice. But it’d be nicer if you stopped yelling so I could sleep.”
mulled wine, Potter.”
“Don’t think people are back ‘til classes start.”
He’s on Draco’s side of the bed, standing there looking down at him and Draco absolutely refuses to move over to make room, this side’s all nice and warm from where he was happily asleep in it before Potter turned up, he can bloody well go round. Except he toes off his shoes and climbs up onto the bed instead, stepping right over Draco. His socked feet make the mattress dip and Draco stares blearily up at him, rolling over and wondering if maybe he’s still asleep and Harry Potter isn’t really falling into his bed, wriggling around until he’s under the covers, his head on Draco’s other pillow. Draco normally gravitates towards the centre of the bed, body curled inward, so their faces end up quite close.
Draco doesn’t want to have this conversation. He can deal with Potter being moody and distracted but they’re not going to sit here and talk about how Draco has no one to lean on.
“Suppose we’ll just have to make use of the time we’ve got then,” says Draco, and cups a hand over Potter’s cold nose. It’s an odd thing to do, and Draco’s hands aren’t much warmer than the skin underneath them but it makes Potter’s eyes crinkle.
Harry’s close again almost immediately, or, still close really, has been close since he thought
Potter smiles. “Does that mean--?”
Draco’s there, though, when the train leaves. His face breaks into a smile that immediately makes Harry’s kneecaps want to bail and he jerks his head back at the exit behind him. Harry hurries up the stairs so fast he almost trips.
Ron snorts. “Unless you want to be written out of her will, yeah, ‘Mione, I’d say we do.” He nudges a bishop forward to smash one of Harry’s pawns.
There’s a pause where Draco is absent-mindedly running the fingers of one hand over Potter’s skin, propped up with her chin on the other, on her front between Potter’s legs. Potter, to her credit, takes roughly twenty seconds to lie there boneless and then says, decisively, “Fuck,” and sits up, pulling Draco up with her until they’re kissing again, both up on their knees, Draco’s arms around Potter’s neck. She moans right into Draco’s mouth and tries to get them impossibly closer.
Malfoy yells. It is, as loud noises go, pretty brilliant. Harry’s always liked this, the feel of a cock on his tongue, the intimacy of his mouth on someone’s body, and Malfoy is the most responsive partner he’s ever had. He won’t — or can’t — shut up, groaning as Harry sucks hard and lifts off slowly, dragging his tongue up the underside.
Right. Because Malfoy has a surprising number of friends (yeah, Harry’s going to call them that even if the sounds some of them make when Malfoy brings them home are decidedly more than friendly) that he’s always hurrying out of the door to go and see.
Potter lifts a shoulder. “Yeah, I guess. It just sort of comes out around you.”
“I didn’t wake you up,” Potter says after a moment. “You’re not in pajamas.”
Granger makes a small noise of despair. “Can’t we just try a Side-Along—”
the dead-looking plants in the Home & Garden section, appears at the end of the aisle. “They’re done,” he calls, gesturing to the checkouts with his head.
Potter smiles, head tilted down. It’s an odd angle for Draco, staring up at the underside of Potter’s face from one side. “No, you’re probably right.”
“Finally,” he says, pushing back the covers on his bed. Draco averts his eyes, trying not to focus on the bandages that break up the smooth lines of his torso. “Let’s go. This food is terrible.”
?” Draco drawls, piling on the sarcasm.
He elbows Ginny in the side to get her to stop wiggling her eyebrows at him like that.
Granger’s face turns stern. “What are you doing?”
“Since I see her at work,” says Pansy, not really paying attention. “Gods this is taking forever, I’m remembering why we don’t come here on the weekends anymore.”
They try levitating Potter but the spell won’t hold and between them, Weasley and Draco have to hoist him up and support him with a shoulder under each arm to get him out of the house. He doesn’t make a single noise, though Draco can feel in the tension of his body how much pain he’s in. They leave a nice trail of blood all the way down the stairs.
“Wake me up for no reason and then bugger off?”
Granger blinks at him. It had been her idea — or, the her of twenty replays ago, anyway — to tell him that, something he would have no way of knowing otherwise. A quick way to prove to them all that he isn’t lying, or completely out of his mind.
“Oh, thank
“Yeah, apparently.”
“You’re— good at that,” Harry says, stilted, quiet, because the silence is making him want to do something stupid, like beg Malfoy to touch him literally everywhere else.
If he had the capacity for rational thought, he might have taken a moment to appreciate the bizarre reality of the situation, considering his and Malfoy’s history, but instead he feels like any coherency is being steadily worked out of him by the pads of Malfoy’s fingers on his skull. Malfoy combs through his hair, presses his thumbs into the tender spot behind Harry’s ears, palms carefully around his forehead, drags his nails over the sensitive skin of his scalp until Harry’s nothing but a vaguely human-shaped bunch of nerves and tingles.
“Yeah, but Harry wants a different head massaged, if you know what I mean.” Seamus snorts into his mug of tea.
“Hm?”
Potter’s eyes are still open for now, though, staring up at the roof of the car. There’s this look on his face, one Draco can’t figure out, and then his lips part and Draco’s struck with a truly idiotic idea.
“C’mon,” Ginny says, taking the magazine out of Luna’s hand and replacing it with her own so that she can tug her towards the front of the shop. “We might as well make Harry buy us this. It’s got free stickers.”
Harry shoots her a look, wonders fleetingly if it was wizards who butchered Muggle idioms, or vice versa. “I’m not finding someone to sleep with just to piss Malfoy off.”
the articles. But this is Potter, who’s always been a certain level of untouchable.
“Have a party here if you’re that bothered,” he says.
Harry doesn’t even think about it, just sucks in a breath and holds it there, chest full as Malfoy hums, this time in approval, and speeds up his hand.
, Draco thinks. Blinks down at Potter’s face, too pale.
“Right.”
Malfoy is not asleep. He wasn’t asleep when Harry brushed his teeth as loud as humanly possible, nor when he’d deliberately banged his bedroom door closed behind him, and he isn’t asleep now that Harry is in bed, the room dark and warm. But not quiet, because Malfoy isn’t asleep.
“I’ll see you at breakfast?”
“Yes, thanks. And I also remember the other forty-seven times, all of which ended with both of us covered in your blood.”
The end of December sneaks up on Draco, though he’s not sorry to be leaving this year behind him. He wonders just how pathetic it is to spend the 31st alone in his room and decides he doesn’t much care. It’s not like there’s anyone to see him; McGonagall’s already told him most of the teachers have their own plans and he’s welcome to come or go as he pleases. He doesn’t want to be at home and going to France to see Pansy seems like too much of an effort, despite the fact he can read that she wants him there in every line of her letters.
Draco snorts, gripping the bottom of Potter’s shirt so she can pull it up over her head and duck down to kiss the newly-exposed flesh. She lets her hands skim down Potter’s sides, digging her fingers in when Potter gasps and tries to wriggle away. “Ticklish,” she breathes, so Draco does it again, until Potter grabs her by the wrists and holds them behind her back, catching Draco’s lower lip between her teeth, releasing it with a soft pull back to meet Draco’s eyes.
of work goes into missions, even short trips like this one, and it’s not like Harry can do anything to help — so Harry has some time to lie around in Draco’s spare bedroom and think. It’s the summer holidays, it’s not like he has to be back for work, but he finds himself feeling guilty regardless. Not in a bad way, per se, just. There’s something indulgent about it all. The insane privilege of getting to go into fucking
Harry watches him as he shoves a couple of heavy books he’d been carrying under one arm into the bag, eyeing the familiar shade of his jumper. It’s soft and worn so thin that it’s perfect for summer, when you want something comforting that won’t suffocate you in this stupid heat.
“No.” He sighs again, dropping his hands away from his face. “I don’t want to talk about your dad.”
been the trigger to break the loop, he’d just stunned himself and left Weasley and Granger to drag both his and Potter’s useless bodies from the wreckage. Still, no time to dwell.
Draco smiles at him. He doesn’t agree, but he lets himself hope it might be ok. It’s easier to believe with Potter right there.
She puts all of her not inconsiderable skill into the kiss, nipping at Potter’s lips, licking into her mouth and then lifting off so Potter strains her head up, chasing Draco. After Draco’s done this little routine no less than three times, keeping Potter pinned to the bed all the while, Potter flops back, frustrated and pouts at Draco. “It’s my birthday,” she says, and then just lies there looking up at Draco. She must be doing it on purpose, the whole— swollen lips parted, hair fanned out around her on the bed thing, but damned if Draco isn’t completely weak for it.
“Sorry,” Potter says again and Draco can tell he’s smiling even if he can’t see it.
, he’s hard.
“Can you—” Potter says, sort of sheepishly, after she’s begun pumping her finger in and out. “Can you tell me if it feels good?” She sounds a little embarrassed about it.
“Pull your weight, slacker,” Ginny stage-whispers at him, shoving him with her foot. “Or do you want him to think you’re so shit in bed that you just lie there like a stuffed Hippogriff.”
Some idiot shoves behind Draco and knocks her so she stumbles forward slightly, catching herself on the bar-top next to Potter and getting close enough to realise Potter smells all woody and Merlin, Draco is losing her fucking mind.
Potter gets the hint quickly and moves to help, until they’re both half-dressed, Draco in her top and knickers and Potter still down to her underwear. Draco hadn’t worn a bra, she doesn’t often because she’s been cursed — or blessed, depending on her mood — with the traditionally tiny Malfoy tits, and Potter fits a hand over her chest, palming her until Draco’s nipples are hard through her shirt. Draco lets her head fall back onto Potter’s shoulder as she slips her other hand into Draco’s pants, cupping over her and letting Draco grind down.
“Shit,” Harry swears, pushing him back for a second to catch his breath. He looks indecently hot with his hair all over his red face like that. Harry feels his dick actually twitch.
“Mother of Merlin, Potter,” Malfoy says as Harry looks up at him, twists his hand up and off, following the path of his mouth until Malfoy makes a high, bright noise.
Draco shrugs, picks up a stray pistachio and cracks it open with a thumbnail. “Why not.”
Pansy looks over her shoulder and then back at Draco with an exasperated expression. “For gods’ sake Draco, will you just go talk to her for once?”
“Whe—?” Potter starts to say but he has to stop to cough, and Draco huffs, trying to be annoyed and coming up with nothing but fear.
Potter huffs out a laugh, and sounds a little self-conscious when she continues, which should not make Draco’s chest feel all full and fluttery, but it does. “I mean, like, talk to me about it.”
Draco doesn’t know why Potter’s telling him this but he’s not really paying attention so it hardly matters. He’s never cared much about Herbology, much to his mother’s despair. If he concentrates he can feel where Potter’s breath hits his own face, cooled by the time it reaches Draco, but still faintly spicy, his mouth wine-dark. Draco’s never going to be able to drink mulled wine again without thinking of Potter, which admittedly he only ever does about once a year, but it’s the principle of the thing.
The doors open then, and McGonagall enters with a gaggle of children behind her, all of them looking pink cheeked and shivering from the cold. Draco supposes they’re lucky the lake hadn’t frozen over completely.
Never mind that they’re all basically adults, Draco thinks, or that they’re on the run, wanted by the government, supposed to be looking for pieces of psychopath soul to destroy so that they can end the bloody war. Never mind that he still has stitches in his scalp, that Potter can’t walk for more than two minutes without needing to stop and rest. Never mind all that when Potter is clearly cheating with some kind of stabilising charm on his reindeer that’s making it win every time.
.” He’s horizontal, definitely, wonderfully fucking
“Here,” he says, sliding a mug over to Harry and waving his wand so that the teapot starts to pour. “You look like you need it.”
Potter smiles and it pulls at Draco’s chest. “Ok. Good.”
There’s a knock on the door. Malfoy doesn’t even give Harry time to say anything, he just opens it and comes in, shutting it behind him. Jesus, he looks— well, he looks utterly fucked out, honestly. He has a high, pleased colour about his cheeks and he’s wearing those godforsaken leggings again, with a t-shirt that hangs down to mid-thigh.
Potter makes that noise again. “We’re not very good at conversation, are we?”
That time is bad. Draco accidentally tosses his wand aside (he gets a little caught up in the moment) so Dolohov slices Potter
She’s not quiet either, making these small noises against Draco’s mouth, and Draco is in no place to judge, she keeps saying Potter’s name and she can’t seem to make herself stop. Everyone probably knows exactly what they’re doing in here, despite the general noise of drunk girls in a bathroom. That knowledge shouldn’t make Draco feel so good but it does. Potter seems to agree because she presses Draco against the wall and shoves a thigh between her legs and this is becoming a theme, Potter pushing her up against things, and Draco is absolutely 100% in support of it, except she wouldn’t mind if maybe the surfaces were a little softer.
, is not conducive to sleeping, Potter. That might explain it.”
“Shut up.”
“Alright?” Draco asks.
It keeps raining for days.
, there’s Draco an unimaginable number of miles away, not even on the same planet.
Draco says nothing. When he lifts his head to look properly at Potter it hurts his neck.
Draco snorts. “Glad to hear I’m tolerable.”
obviously, like any sane person would assume, but Potter’s already off the ground.
kind of realisation, I’d rather know sooner than later. Pansy’ll need time to get the sofa-bed ready.”
He comes to slumped next to Pansy on a sofa that’s been pushed up against the wall to clear space, trying to decide if he can be bothered to make the trip all the way upstairs to bed.
“It’s raining,” Potter says unnecessarily the next day, appearing again in Draco’s window, damp and smiling. Draco had pushed it all the way open that morning to let the smell of the rain in, so the sound and feel of it could permeate the quiet room. He’d woken up feeling more settled and he’s been lying on top of his bed all morning, half-sleeping, half-reading. He’d never been in the Muggle Studies section of the library before, but he’d been looking for a textbook the other day and stumbled across a whole shelf of Muggle literature, undetectably extended by the look of it. He’d had to lighten the pile of books with a charm just to get them all checked out and upstairs into his room.
Malfoy rolls his eyes. “
She’s brought Maltesers with her, though, and doesn’t try to take the remote from him once she’s toed off her shoes and stolen half his blanket, so Harry can’t really complain.
He hears a snort next to him and turns to find Ginny giving him a look. (He’s finally relented re: the first name situation. There really are too many of them and it was getting confusing.) She raises her eyebrows and jerks her head in a completely unsubtle way at her ex-boyfriend. Draco suppresses a wince. As much as he’s found an unexpected friend in her, he doesn’t like being reminded that they essentially have the same taste in men. He even saw her make a move on Blaise before, back when she was still figuring herself out.
“Sorry.”
” Malfoy says, looking up from under half-lowered lids when Harry finds them in the kitchen with what appears to be several hundred bottles of alcohol set out on the table.
Malfoy nods. “I already—” he breathes, chest heaving, and Harry has to suppress a groan of his own because of course, he fucking
“It doesn’t. I meant— whatever.”
“How’s your nose?” Draco asks when they break apart, the damp sound of it loud in the quiet forest.
“This is why I suggested we use my tent,” Draco says, watching Weasley try to shove the turkey into the tiny oven in their tiny tent kitchen. “It has two ovens and an aga.”
January trips forward past its halfway point and suddenly the rest of the school will be back before the end of the week. Draco’s dreading it, and not only for the reasons he was when he first got here. Those anxieties over how people will react to seeing him are still there, only they’re mixed up in this new thing with Potter.
dead. He’s half-buried under a pile of rubble and there’s snow falling in from the hole in the roof. Draco really wants to sleep, properly. This passing out and waking up a few hours earlier shit is not exactly restful, even if his body restores itself every time.
Draco rolls his eyes. “At least this way I’m not straining my neck peering down at you.”
Granger’s mouth thins. “You think You-Know-Who’s taking a night off, Ronald? You think they’re all having a nice, relaxing Christmas holiday? Have you learned nothing from the past twenty-four hours?”
“You’re forty-three points down,” she says once she’s soared back up again. Harry literally has not moved from his mid-air spot.
VHS). They eat together in the dining hall that feels like being back at school, everyone jumbled together across long tables, and people are friendly, happy to indulge Harry, answer his questions and explain what they’re working on. He feels almost sick with pride anytime anyone tells him how great Draco is, how he’s the real genius around here, like Harry has anything to do with that. He’s pretty sure everyone assumes they’re still together, but neither of them corrects otherwise.
“Perspective, Hermione,” Weasley reminds Granger. “If we don’t do this, Harry’ll—”
“Can you really think of any Professor who would have been prepared to take a horde of twelve-year-olds halfway up a mountain?” he asks when Potter stays quiet.
“It’s been known to happen.”
“Start something you can’t finish.”
She bustles around, checking the cut on Draco’s scalp which is tender, but no longer blindingly painful, lifting Potter’s blankets to inspect his dressings. They all sit there in silence whilst she works until she finishes ticking some things off on a chart and turns to them, hands on hips.
Malfoy smiles, unabashed. “Yes, I suppose so.” He pulls the door closed behind him and leans back against it. He does a lot of bloody leaning. It feels like every surface Harry looks at in this house there’s a Malfoy leaning up against it. Or, just the one Malfoy, obviously. There’s zero chance of catching Lucius all draped up against a spare door frame, and Harry thanks Merlin for it.
Potter’s wound stops repelling magic by the time lunch is over. Another foible of Dolohov’s, though he probably fairly assumed that the person on the receiving end would be dead before much time had passed, rendering the anti-healing effects unnecessary. They try simple cleaning charms around the gauze every half an hour until one of them takes and Potter whoops.
— he hasn’t been able to find them for a while, Malfoy must have stolen them and now they’re—
.” The pain is so bad his vision swims for a second and he stands, dazed, swaying, thoughts literally knocked from his mind, vaguely aware of the sound of Potter yelling somewhere to his left and a body hitting the floor.
“I suppose you’re excited to see your friends again,” he tells Potter, the pair of them curled facing each other in the centre of Draco’s bed.
Potter laughs. It’s annoying. Draco’s annoyed, he was almost sleep.
The guy is a bit short and his dark hair is messy and his eyes are green and when Harry walks into the kitchen Saturday morning in just his t-shirt and boxers he finds Ginny, Luna, Neville and Seamus sitting at the breakfast table, staring. They glance between him and the stranger, who’s busy making himself coffee, oblivious, and Harry is confronted with four sets of wide eyes and six frantically waggling eyebrows (Luna’s eyes are always wide, but she’s too focussed on painting Ginny’s nails to tell Harry with her face whatever it is the other’s are trying to communicate). Malfoy is nowhere to be seen. He probably isn’t even out of bed yet.
a shtick, that Potter was exaggerating how much of a self-critic she was all through Hogwarts and the war and her training before she went professional. Now, though, it’s impossible to see this adult Potter and not realise that it’s the truth, that she really does hold herself to that high of a standard, and how unbearably hot that is, somehow.
Harry does as he’s told, folding himself onto the carpet at Malfoy’s feet.
Granger stares at him like she’s worried for his sanity. It doesn’t matter, there’s no
“Thanks Harry,” he says, almost too quietly for Harry to hear. Harry nods, and they continue their walk in silence, hands bumping together and feet tapping in time.
“What is that?” he demands. Hermione rolls her eyes.
“So. Explain.” Hermione picks up her menu, even though Harry knows her attention is on him. He copies her movement, not really looking at the menu. He’ll probably get spaghetti bolognese.
“Remind me to never trust myself around Dean again. He sees too much,” Draco says, appearing at Harry’s side. Harry steels himself and turns, expecting his cock to harden, and finding his chest tightening instead.
“If you want to see more, just ask him. Draco will whip it out for anyone.” Pansy laughs.
He palms his cock through his pants, shivering at the sensation. Yes, that’s it. A nice rounded arse, a nice slippery hole. With no face. Nope. No face at all. He pulls his cock free and starts to tug in long slow movements, letting himself feel it in his toes. He closes his eyes tight, trying to focus on his hand, his cock, the pleasure spasming through him as he rubs.
“Harry, it’s nearly time,” Hermione says, bursting whatever bubble he’d been in. He coughs, and Draco’s hand comes to rest on his back, hot through the robes. Harry looks at him, wanting to say something, and wanting to run very, very far away.
*****
“I am fine,” he says, his voice cracking. Draco raises one eyebrow, and it looks so much like that one picture of him where he’s leaning on a desk, his arse bare, looking over his shoulder sardonically. Harry’s cock twitches. He’s getting an erection from Draco raising an eyebrow, which is a habit that Draco has. It’s something he does often. If it’s going to give Harry an erection every time he does it, there’s going to be a problem.
“You’re not fine,” Draco says, his voice low and deep. His eyes are so grey, looking deep into Harry like he is reading his soul, and something starts to stir.
Harry’s hand speeds up. He’s so close. There’s a rushing in his ears, a pounding in his head as his orgasm builds.
“Who am I in love with?” he asks, just in case. Ron looks at him like he’s insane.
He moans, his lips ghosting Draco’s. “The important bit, I think.”
Shit.
Even if he did talk to Draco, what would he say? Draco should be with someone classy and grownup, not the overgrown child that is Harry. He looks at Ron, ready to say this, and stops. Ron is staring at him, unblinking, clearly working something out.
Harry wonders what kind of day it will be today.
“How can you be sure?” Harry asks.
“I do,” Draco agrees, stepping out of his pants and pressing his naked body against Harry’s.
. He caught a glimpse of Draco cheering him on for
“Over in the corner,” Ron says, and Harry could kick him.
His friend who he has wanked over. Lots.
They should probably talk. Maybe define what their relationship is, or will be. But Harry doesn’t feel the need, because they are what they’ve always been, and what they always will be. Linked and together and dependent on each other in a way that makes this seem inevitable.
Harry’s cock twitches. He does. He wants to fuck Draco more than he’s ever wanted anything. Draco grins, winking once, and Harry growls, grabbing at Draco, lips crashing against his, hands in Draco’s hair, on his back, cupping his arse. Draco wraps one long leg around Harry’s hips, grinding his cock against Harry’s.
“We’re going to that new Italian place on Diagon, and you are going to explain to me why you refuse to support your friend and buy the damn magazine,” Hermione huffs. They get to the Apparition point and she doesn’t wait for him to prepare before grabbing his hand and spinning them to Diagon Alley.
Harry had been teaching Teddy to fly, using a training broom, and then suddenly Teddy was on the ground and Harry felt sick. Teddy’s usually turquoise hair is a muddy brown, a sure sign he’s in pain. How did he fall off the broom? Harry is the worst godfather ever.
about what he might see on the pages next to him.
“It sells more, and the magazine said they’d give twenty percent of their profit from the magazine to the charity,” Draco answers. Harry glances at him, watching as Draco worries his lip. Draco sighs. “I think I just needed someone to tell me I looked good. I’ve not been feeling… anyway.”
thing to do, but he can’t focus.
Draco is standing in his doorway, eyes bright, concern lining his forehead. He leans against the frame with both hands, his body taking up the space.
“So, what happened?” Draco asks quietly as they follow Teddy into the Healer’s room.
He could wank and not think about Draco. That wouldn’t be wrong. He could think of any of the guys he’s fucked in the past few years. He could just think about an arse, with no face attached. Just think about sliding into a hot, tight, hole.
“And now I’m in love with him?”
“I’m sorry,” he murmurs. Draco is so close to him that Harry can see the tiny flecks of blue in his grey eyes. Can smell the tang of champagne on his breath. Can feel Draco thighs, firm against his.
His cock is definitely interested, and definitely hard, by the time he gets home. He drops his kit bag by the front door and goes straight to the kitchen. His brain tries to remind him that this is a terrible idea, that he doesn’t need another reason to obsess about Draco, that wanking over your friend is a horrible,
Fuck, Ron was right. Harry is in love.
“Have you read the interview? Or just jacked off to him winking?” he finally asks. Harry feels heat rise in his neck and cheeks and ears.
He takes the magazine with him as he heads to bed. He’s just full of terrible ideas.
do that again. The fact that he did it once is awful. He takes his wand from where it fell onto the floor during his… a minute ago, and Scourgifies the floor, cleaning up the evidence of his terrible idea.
“Are you okay Harry?” Luna asks, and then everyone is looking at him, which makes everything worse.
Harry didn't miss the way Rosemary flinched back half a step. "Yes?" she said, voice remarkably steady when her posture said she’d rather like to flee.
“Er, yeah?” Ron said, giving Harry an odd look. “We’ve known that since first year, haven’t we?”
“Hm,” Seamus said. “None of your other leads are panning out?”
“Have to,” Harry muttered darkly. “They’re
"Nope, it's true." Rosemary cut in. "If you check the minutes, he's voted against the last seven motions to reduce paperwork. Got a cousin in charge of Boring Archives, Records & Filing."
Harry rolled his eyes. "Someone left a very realistic fake cock at an Apparition Point. This'll be break room gossip for a week at the most."
he remembered Rosemary telling him.
Later. He’d take a look at the report after he got back to his office. Not because he cared what Malfoy thought of this newest cock. But because it was his job. As an Auror. A temporarily displaced Auror, but Harry prided himself on his solid work ethic. In fact, he should probably read over all the other forms as well. Not that Harry particularly cared to hear Malfoy’s opinions on the other two cocks. Because Harry didn’t care about Malfoy’s opinions on
what you call trauma?"
“Imagine this,” said Harry, leaning back in his chair. He set his glass down with a decisive thunk. “I am in my office, my very tiny office. My very very tiny office that makes my Auror cubicle look bloody enormous. I am at my desk, trying to sort through Apparition Applications. Do you have any idea how ridiculous the application form is if you don’t get licensed through a school?”
Ron stared at him a moment. Then he closed his eyes, taking a biscuit off the plate and stuffing it into his mouth. "You can't just keep handing me these things and expect me to keep my mouth shut. It's not fair."

didn't want to know. Especially where penises were concerned.
Malfoy cackled, dropping the cock and reaching for the forms and his quill.
Hermione prodded the Vicious Cockmonster, tickling it in a way he did
Harry hit it with form 68-J, and kept hitting it until it stopped sparking.
The Spell Damage waiting room had a lot of posters lining the walls, cheerfully recommending that witches and wizards ought to practice safe spellcasting.
George raised an eyebrow at him, turning to look at the large Wheezes sign just beside them, and then back at Harry. "It's a sparkly penis. Next to my shop. Of course I'm here. The poor bloke who found the thing thought it was something of mine."
Without looking at any of the bystanders or reacting to the smattering of applause his stunt had earned him, Harry hauled himself out of the fountain and made his way, sodden robes dripping and wet shoes squelching with every step, over to the nearest Floo.
"You should have set a Portkey to go off at the end of the evening like I did."
"Yes, oh." Malfoy picked up the penis, and Harry noticed that it started perking up again when he touched it, and dropped it back in the shoebox. "So while this has been fun, lost sex toys are not my department."
your friend, Harry. Which is why I'm calling you on your bullshit." Hermione pointed her fork at him, lettuce dripping a bit of vinaigrette back into her bowl. "Suck it up and take your punishment. You've no one to blame but yourself."
Harry shot a Sticking Charm at the specimen jar to keep it from toppling to the ground, and then turned and walked away, feeling overwhelmed and done. Heads were popping over cubicle walls all over the department, and Seamus ran up breathlessly behind him. "What was that?"
"It's pretty brilliant, really. I've been experimenting with sex toys. Nothing ready for the masses yet, though."
get that much worse had Harry asking, “Sorry, didn’t quite catch that. Who am I taking this to?”
"It's apparently part of my job description to Apparate Mrs Periweather and Persimmon to and from their grooming appointment every Tuesday."
At the mention of Bartram, Hermione appeared, as if by magic. It reminded Harry a little of how Crookshanks could be summoned from a dead sleep by the sound of a can opener. He looked morosely down into his pint glass at the two inches of beer sloshing in the bottom. That wasn’t nearly enough to get him through this conversation. He reached out with a foot and shoved the chair to his left away from the table just in time for Hermione to slip into it.
Malfoy stared at him a moment, mouth opening and closing like some sort of exotic fish before closing with a snap. He turned and began waving his wand at the half-limp cock, ignoring Harry entirely. Harry could see the muscle jumping in his jaw, and his wandwork was particularly sharpish and prickly.
"Hopefully not literally?"
George grinned up at him, standing and brushing his hands on his trousers. "Too late."
Harry rolled his eyes. “Nice to see you too. Glad you’re looking so relaxed from your holiday.”
Malfoy gave him a flat look. “That is what the Containment Receptacles are for, aren’t they? Containing specimens?”
“You’re wearing gloves,” he pointed out childishly.
Mrs Periweather glared at him and sniffed, cuddling Persimmon closer before turning back to Li. Harry pointed at a Receptacle and waved at Rosemary before snatching it and ducking back out.
Harry was surprised it took Seamus and Ron until nearly the end of the day to stop by his office. He'd spent most of the afternoon expecting them, counting down the minutes until the three hours were up and praying they wouldn't stop by before then. He really really really didn't want to explain the erections to them.
take over teaching the classes.” He picked up the kettle and found it empty. “What the hell? You just made this.”
With that, Malfoy tipped the penis out of the Receptacle, and leaned forward, examining it closely. Very closely.
"Yes, your majesty."
"What? Striped like a Union Jack? Who'd want that?"
"Erm," said Harry. "What are you. Why are you doing that?"
Scratch that. Harry was
Harry didn’t see how informing him, ‘That had penis on it,’ could possibly do anything even remotely useful for their working relationship. Sometimes ignorance was bliss, wasn't it? He coughed once, awkwardly. “Er. Never mind. Thought it was slipping.”
“Regarding item B-5 for case number 187-245-M-72 submitted for Magical Analysis nearly two months ago via request 7258-12,” Harry said. He’d written the bloody numbers so many times in the past few days that he could probably rattle it off in his sleep.
“And speaking of penises,” Harry said, gesturing grandly to the vase.
Harry groaned and dropped his head to the tabletop. “Fucking Persimmon.”
“Here,” Malfoy said. He grabbed one of the glass canisters from the counter and dumped out the cotton swabs it held, used a stern
“You could have offered to share yours,” Harry said.
Malfoy scoffed. "Cocks hardly count as a gift. You're the one who keeps them."
Malfoy left the exam room in another swirl of robes. Harry stared at the stack of forms and shoebox, and felt the dreadful certainty that lost sex toys were about to become his department.
“Exam room 4,” she interrupted, raising her voice to be heard over the rambunctious cock in the box. She looked like she was struggling not to laugh at him. A part of Harry wanted to be upset, but honestly he couldn’t find it in himself to blame her. “Sounds urgent. I’ll send Healer Malfoy right in.”
Of course, that’s when Malfoy threw him off balance yet again.
"Thanks," Harry said with a little sigh.
“Cheer up, mate,” Ron said with a level of cheerfulness that made Harry, what with his departmental transfer and his hangover and his pitiful lack of a decent cup of tea, sort of want to hit him. “They’ve probably got tea down in Apparition.”
"Ugh, don't remind me." Harry frowned back at his office. "You're
Standing up, he gathered his things, left the paperwork on his blotter and the cock pushed to the farthest edge of his desk, and headed down to the Auror department to meet Ron and Seamus so they could head to the pub together.
Of course Arthur was happy. He hadn't just received a replica of his own penis. Because Harry had known at a glance that the penis in the hat was

Harry just smiled. The vocabulary expanding kick had actually come about two years ago, and hadn’t gone much further than word-a-day calendars for everyone each Christmas. But Hermione’s vocabulary was formidable enough that the dictionary thing was entirely plausible.
“Oh my god,” Harry said. He reached out and gingerly poked it with the tip of one finger.
Anyone. Not just Harry. See? Not paranoia. Just a healthy dose of caution.
“It likes me,” Harry said, pained. He shuffled back another few steps. “It really,
Rosemary snorted. "Just enjoy you've an actual office through the end of April, you wanker. Not sharing space with all those stinky gits in the bullpen."
Despite himself, Harry couldn’t help being impressed. That list was… comprehensive, to say the least. According to the pamphlet, the cock vibrated and thrust and pulsed, all of which were fully customizable to whatever frequency or rhythm the user desired. The cocks could be curved to ‘provide maximum pleasure!’ and the length and thickness could be adjusted to an extent, though the information card recommended ordering a product with specifications closest to those the user required ‘for the best possible experience!’
Malfoy sighed. "All right, but only because your face is so pathetic right now."
Kingsley sighed, rubbing his forehead. "You weren't paying attention to anything I said, were you?"
Harry’s hangover tapped out a staccato pulsing against the inside of his skull to match the sharp clink of silver on porcelain. “They’ve decided to stick me in Apparition for a while. It’s supposed to teach me a healthy respect for the rules or some rubbish like that, I think. Kingsley was too busy giving me stern looks to really explain his reasoning.”
Fuck. It was no wonder he missed Malfoy. The case was nothing but a frustration. And not that Malfoy wasn't frustrating, but he was exciting as well. And when he was staring at the line of penises on his desk, it was frustrating and boring. And it was amazing how much he could miss Malfoy in just a single day.
Malfoy swallowed again, his adam's apple bobbing, and Harry was abruptly aware of how close he was standing. That realization was quickly followed by another: that he didn't know what he wanted more, to punch Malfoy or snog him until he begged for mercy.
“Have you tried hitting it with a folder?” Malfoy asked.
As he spoke, the CopyCock in the vase grew harder. The tip of it peeked shyly from among the daisies, and the look on Malfoy’s face made everything about this awful morning pretty much worthwhile.
and going through every possible combination of the words
It was amazing what being confronted with an unnaturally accurate replica of one’s own genitalia did, motivationally speaking.
Harry nodded, and obediently followed the wave to the room in question.
Malfoy shot him a glare, annoyance quickly overwhelming the amusement. "I am aware of the forms needed to do my job, Potter."
"Aw, where's your sense of fun? You really don't want to give them a go?"
“I’m telling you,” said the wizard blandly, “that we’ll contact you when we have more information regarding your request.”

“Don’t you dare,” Harry told him, unable to maintain any sort of indignation about the possibility of Malfoy owling the newspaper, not when he was half-distracted by Malfoy’s smile and half-distracted by his entirely inappropriate reaction to Malfoy’s hands in those blue gloves, now that some horrible part of Harry’s brain had made the connection between

"Oh, darling, I lunch with Rosemary twice a week."
And then he'd… He had no idea. Probably drink way too much. Maybe he'd accidentally Apparate into Mr Smythe's bath again. Maybe he'd manage to Splinch himself.
“Wait,” Harry said. “That’s it? That’s all you needed to do?”
"You're the one who said I could go to St Mungo's now. Besides, I've been filling in forms all day. This sets me ready to actually start looking up Accoutrements tomorrow. And, you know, whoever ordered a giant sex toy sent to a Member of Wizengamot."
“By persimmons?” Ginny asked. “What’s that got to do with Apparition?”
Harry cleared his throat, noting a piece of cardstock resting beside it, and pulled it out. And then he gaped, because, "The Vicious Cockmonster? Really?"

a shriek and fell flat on his arse. Both cups of tea splashed all over him, and the cock flew past and out into the hallway where it bounced off the opposite wall and fell to the floor, buzzing loudly and drifting in a lazy circle, rather like a boat with one oar.
"Oh and when do
The only cloud on the horizon was large and penis-shaped. Because he had to at least make his search for whoever sent Bartram the Vicious Cockmonster seem convincing.
Damn her, she had a point.
Malfoy snorted. “Your professionalism is astounding.”
But it
Harry sighed. "No wonder someone sent him a giant cock and told him to shove it up his arse."
Malfoy blinked, swallowed, and his eyes darted between the cock and Harry's face. "If you have a new specimen, you really need to bring it to St Mungo's."
Ron keeping his mouth shut was too much to hope for. Hermione would know, which meant Ginny. Which meant George. Which meant that by the time pudding was served, the entire table would know it was
“Because the Containment Receptacles aren’t fireproof, I just discovered.” Harry gestured at the jet of sparks, which had shifted from red to orange to gold. “And believe me, I’m going to write a strongly worded letter of complaint to the arsehole who designed them.” Maybe he’d get Hermione to help him. She was always on about safety and… paperwork. And things like that. He wasn’t entirely clear on what it was she did all day, but she’d never been one to turn down a good letter-writing campaign. Harry would bring her a bottle of wine tonight and they’d make an evening of it.
"Potter." Malfoy gave a brief nod. "Something quick, Indira told me."
"Completely. Er, well, they've got a hands-free keyword, but that lasts three hours. And that's not really

“Furthermore,” Hermione began, but was interrupted by a sharp buzzing sound from inside the box.
Malfoy huffed a sigh, wiggling out of his trousers and pants, and kicking them off his ankles. "Oh, please. I've been sending you cocks by way of flirting and you're
