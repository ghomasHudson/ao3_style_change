“We only seek to begin an early introduction. When one is younger, one has a more open mind, and that eases the introduction to a whole new world. There are things to see that will be new to both Pureblood children and Muggle-borns. Things that upon integration will hold the Wizarding World’s hand to development,” Hermione continues earnestly.
“No.”
Harry’s trembling from it, shaking on the bed and when he squints to look at Draco, Draco’s expression is tight with arousal and wonder.
He’s being selfish, he knows, by not handing Harry the papers. He should set Harry free. He should let Harry leave his memories of a dead son and a dead love behind, move on and fall in love again.
Harry nods and very gently pushes further and further in. It hurts more with every second but Draco clenches his jaw and powers through, hoping it gets better. He feels Harry’s balls against his arse and knows he is all in and when the pain doesn’t recede, he says, “Wait a minute.”
“Ron and I were thinking,” Hermione says from his other side, fingers seeking his in the dark. He reaches out to clasp them with one hand, gripping Ron’s with the other. “That we should go to Australia.”
There’s an edge of desperation in Harry’s voice when he says, “Draco, please don’t hate me.”
How could I not want this? How could I not choose you? How could I not fall in love?
By the time the glass is empty, Gianni is wringing his hands together, but Draco notices with some relief he has stopped murmuring about ironing his ears.
‘Lie back, Harry,’ Draco says, and it isn’t a request, isn’t something he’s asking for. It’s a command and Harry finds his body complying even before his brain has fully processed the command.
When he approaches, he sees out of the corner of his eye the way Harry looks him up and down, focusing instead on Hermione who’s grinning at him. “You clean up well, Malfoy,” she tells him. Weasley nods behind her. “You too,” he tells her, taking in her black, embroidered robes and leaning down to kiss her knuckles. “Good to see you Weasley,” he says, politely and is surprised to find he actually means it. Weasley nods, if a bit awkwardly but its more than Draco expected anyway.
“And then…” Harry continues, and his voice sounds choked, sounds broken. “And then, when I stay the morning after, we’ll wake up to each other and you can say it then. And I will either start laughing or start crying and whatever I do, you will kiss me through it. And we’ll go out for breakfast.”
For the first time, Draco’s nerves make their presence known in the pit of his stomach.
The last time he had gone to sleep for more than half the day, he had woken up to a living nightmare.
“No,” Harry says. “I was leaving because I thought you didn’t want me.”
Not because he’s scared. Not because he’s put off by Granger’s widened eyes and ugly scowl.
“There are too many people there. You know that.”
He’s standing at the window, watching the lights of Camden flicker and dim and flare, the cigarette smoke curling from his lips into the night sky. There are no stars tonight, their fires shrouded in the a cotton candy graveyard of clouds.
Draco swallows. Harry gulps.
Whatever is in place of Scorpius’ heart drops like a stone at the words. “What do you mean?” He asks, concerned panic leaching into his words. “What on
Draco stumbles. Harry reaches out to catch him and in the process, they’re pulled towards each other, Harry’s hand on Draco’s wrist and Draco’s hand on Harry’s shoulder.
“Why here?” Potter asks. It doesn’t seem redundant the way Theo’s questions often were if Draco went off on a tangent about his slight history obsession. The words, guileless and curious, are filled with Potter’s brand of earnest genuineness that sets Draco’s teeth on edge and his soul at rest.
Another twinge in Harry’s chest. Hedwig.
When the door shuts behind her, Draco leans up on one elbow, facing Harry. He reaches out and brushes a stray lock of hair away from where it had caught on Harry’s frames.
Malfoy’s sharp jaw bunches. His grey gaze turns cooler than it had been, thawing ice freezing up again. “Well then,” he says, shrugging. “Best be on my way. Good day, Potter. Nice talk.”
“Lovegood?” He asks, suspiciously. “Everything alright?”
There’s a sound, an awful, violent, earth-shattering sound shaking the core of Harry’s soul, rocking the foundations of the stones he’s kneeling on. There’s a sound and it’s gathering, there’s a sound and it’s shattering, there’s a sound and Harry feels the vibrations of it in his chest, in his magic, in every isolated cell of himself.
“Truce,” Harry says, clearing his throat and holding out a hand.
“How many times have I told you that you and Ron should go buy an owl for yourselves?” He asks her, reminding himself to power through the pain, again. His nails are digging into his palm.
And love, without stability, Scorpius thinks, watching Harry open his wardrobe and trail his fingers over the smooth silk of the invisibility cloak, is fatal.
She smiles. “Course not.”
“I- um- I Apparated,” he says, gesturing to the gate. Malfoy shakes his head and murmurs, “The gate has an intention charm on it. It’s not supposed to let in– I put it there. Is my magic failing?”
“No,” he says. “This branch of the Malfoy line was wiped out during the Italian Wizarding War of 1876. None of them survived. Plenty of rumours around about how precisely it happened. Some say they were spies. Some say the family splintered within itself and everyone killed each other. Father always said it wasn’t as scandalous as the Malfoy line likes to maintain it is. He said they were ambushed in the middle of the night in a raid and all of them were too drunk to fight back.”
“Not to everyone,” she grins. “To me you are.”
Hermione’s laughing now, and Harry can’t hold his own laughter back and after a beat, Ron’s joining in.
The smile had wiped itself clean off.
Granger sounds apologetic,  “I’m his best friend. He won’t tell another soul but he isn’t too great at keeping things from us.” She pauses before adding, “I can see the edges of the charm. If I concentrate.” She looks at him out of the corner of her eye. “I’m not concentrating.”
, I—fuck, Parvati, fuck,
“Do you want to talk about what happened?”
But neither is Potter’s testimony enough for a full pardon.
“Those other things we were talking about before? Those sound pretty great right now.”
He was placed under house arrest with Ministry protection, and Scorpius had later discovered that when Harry Potter had been a Junior Auror, he’d been placed as Selwyn’s guard for his first mission.
The sharks of the gossip columns have learnt all too well what sort of eye it takes to find the chinks in ironclad armour. How to taste vulnerability in the air.
Standing here,
‘Cast a cleaning charm, will you?’ Draco asks, his voice hoarse from screaming, crying and loud, wanton moaning.
The sated, sleepy smile Harry gives him soothes the ache in Draco’s heart that hasn’t gone away for a long, long time.
“In any case, this happened when he came into my room one night. No Death Eater was allowed to protect their doors. Something about a trust of faith and loyalty. Locking spells were allowed, but nothing protective. The Dark Lord, Voldemort, I mean, Voldemort, Voldemort, would check on us. And one night Greyback just… broke open the door. I hexed him away but he kept coming and the one time he was close enough… he did this.”
When Weasley turns up at his door looking furious and ready to use a Killing Curse, Draco knows he is in for it. He opens the door and braces himself for a Stinging Hex or a Mutilation Spell or an exploding potion being thrown in his face but instead receives a strong sock to his jaw that makes him crash to the floor, hit his head and see stars. Weasley crouches down, heals his jaw with a rapid Healing spell, waits a few seconds for it to set and then without warning, socks him in the jaw again.
“You’re a colossal twat when you want to be—”
But the arm Glamour was a blanket Glamour that covered all of Draco’s scars and Draco, having been in the places he has been, has a lot of scars. When one is the youngest, most susceptible member of a house invaded by growling beasts and maniacs hungry and baying for blood, one becomes the obvious target.
“Okay,” Draco says. “As long as you’re sure. You don’t have to. You can take it back anytime.”
“You don’t have to tell me anything you don’t want to.”
“You know that is not what I meant.”
sexuality?”
“Harry!” Hermione says, trying quite obviously not to sound surprised and failing spectacularly.
“If there is a life after this one, let me meet you in it, Draco Malfoy.”
“And Draco?”
They lapse into steady silence after that. The effects of the Draught are already wearing off, the slight fog lifting gradually. He looks at Potter out of the corner of his eye, half expecting him to become wispy and fade away but he remains right there, in Draco’s view. Not a hallucination, Draco thinks. Then with horror he thinks again, not a hallucination. Potter is in his kitchen. And Draco has been pouring out his heart to him. He clutches at his wrist with as much force as possible, his knuckles stark against his skin, trying to calm himself down.
“You little bastard,” she says, aiming a slew of rapid French at Draco. He can’t make out what she’s saying, whether she’s berating him for being an idiot or for not telling her or potentially for both.
dead tired of this, ‘Mione? You’re the one? I just had to see Malfoy in Sirius’ house, sitting in my kitchen like he owns it and you’re the one who’s tired? I woke up this morning to blasted sunlight scorching my eyes out when all I wanted to do was sleep and you’re the one who’s tired? I have to deal with reliving every single thing every single night and you’re still the one–” he jabs at her chest, voice rising with every word, “–who’s fucking tired, ‘Mione?” He’s panting by the time he’s done.
“Why not today? Do you have something to do today?” He casts a pointed glance at the way she is sprawled all over the couch, her legs over the arm and her head on his lap.
He wonders if exile is always like this for everyone before Potter’s exasperated lectures about privilege kick in and he realises that he’s a rich boy in a white world and he’s allowed to luxuriate in exile while many people in his position with less of Daddy’s money saved up in vaults and expensive villas would probably be forced to become anonymous starving artists in dusty, forgotten attics.
The scar goes right across his torso, a careless slash of angry magic. It stretches from above his right nipple and ends somewhere close to his hip. It is a thin but prominent line, a reminder of his sixth year, his failures and shortcomings and his supposed victories which were again, failures. Perhaps greater ones because betrayal is the greatest failure of them all.
“Who? The other man?”
For a second, they lie that way, Draco vulnerable and staring as Harry’s thumb gently traces the shape of Draco’s lips– the arch of his cupid’s bow, the fullness of the parts he bites at all the time, the chapped crevices.
“Got held up at the office,” Harry murmurs back, stopping about a foot from Draco. He’s close enough for Draco to smell the peppermint on his breath, but still much too far away for his body yearning to touch and kiss and feel.
It’s Weasley who speaks, tone even and calm, “What, Malfoy?”
Harry kisses his temple again, this time slower. “I’m sure she misses you too.”
“Why?”
With a pang of guilt, Harry remembers his promise to come back home early today and Draco’s answering snort of disbelief followed by a rather acerbic, ‘I’ll believe it when I see it, Potter.’
“Specially designed, yet again,” says the elf who is still standing there. Harry looks towards him and wonders if all Italian elves have salacious smiles when they are enjoying some private jokes at their guest’s expense. “For unmarried couples.”
Harry raises his hand to the side of her neck, feeling for a pulse. Harder, harder, his frantic fingers search, pushing ruthlessly against the delicate curve of her limp throat. Even a broken thread of it would be hopeful enough—
On New Year’s Eve, they kiss at midnight.
An inclination of a brow. “And here you stand, perfectly aware that you didn’t.”
He turns uncomfortably at Weasley and Potter, both of whom are staring at him wordlessly and shakes his head. Awkwardly and without looking him in his fire-bright eyes, he tells Potter, “Thank you for letting me into your home.”
Draco stands there, unmoving and steady, cool eyes surveying the room. Scorpius tries to perceive it from Draco’s perspective and winces. What had once been a bright and cheery bedroom looks more like a private hospital room that’s recently been cleared out. The bed is pristine with white sheets. The curtains are drawn. There’s nothing personal in any part of it. Someone’s been here and cleaned it up to remove all discernible traces of Scorpius. He suspects it was Rose.
“Morning,” he mumbles thickly through the taste of dust and cobwebs in his mouth. It’s a symptom of the Wasting Curse, the Healers had told him. It won’t allow him to taste food properly.
Draco nods, throat clenching, because it does.
Mother’s daughter, that one.
It’s agonising, taking in street names and trying to avoid oncoming trams and traffic while being so thoroughly distracted by a man who seems to be completely unaware of the effect he’s having on Harry. And while Harry appreciates the fact that Malfoy seems to have no inkling of the kind of thoughts Harry harbours for him, he wishes Malfoy would tone down the lascivious and apparently completely unintentional swing of his hips if only for the sake of road safety.
It’s… not that he doesn’t want to. Merlin knows he does. He wants Draco in his bed and from the way Draco’s eyes fill with fraught longing every evening before he leaves, Harry suspects Draco wants that too. But Harry’s Gryffindor courage has deserted him the entirety of the past week and Draco hasn’t brought it up, so they’ve skirted the issue with the sort of ignorant smoothness that can only be achieved by two people trying to avoid the same discussion.
“I—” Draco starts, and discovers he doesn’t have anything to say. “I’m sorry.”
Draco’s never had any religion, none Wizarding, despite the fanatical cult he joined and none Muggle for obvious reasons. But as Harry’s tongue presses against his teeth and swipes across his bottom lip, and the lips pressing against his own bloom in a smile that tastes of forbidden hope and peppermint, he wonders if this is what faith feels like.
Ginevra’s here with Lovegood on her arm. They’re both wearing different shades of yellow and Draco marvels at the way most couples have chosen to pair their robes to suit each other. He looks down at his own green robes that match Harry’s tie and the brown cravat and wonders if the people looking at them think they’re a couple. The thought makes his breath catch and Harry looks at him with concern.
The rest of the trial passes in a blur. Potter’s testimony outweighs the feeble ones provided by others—a couple of barely legal Ravenclaws whose anger seems to be directed more towards the Carrows and Draco’s behaviour as a Hogwarts bully.
But through it all, they never lost sight of that aching, wanting, all-consuming love.
“Yes, Sir, quite,” responds Granger. Her voice comes out weary but with an undercurrent of fondness that Draco thinks is directed at him, because he knows exactly what Granger thinks of Slughorn.
“Is that a Potion bottle, Malfoy?” He asks, tone sharp. Draco opens his eyes to look at Potter and sees him staring at the spot where the bottle of Calming Draught had rolled away to when Draco had taken the last drink from it.
“Draco?” He asks, throat dry.
The feelings Harry has been trying to suppress for the last four weeks for Draco, the urge to grab him and kiss him when he smiled or rolled his eyes at Harry, the urge to take him up to the bedroom and take his clothes off gently, sweetly, to show him that the world could be better than he had witnessed it to already be, those feelings solidify and merge with the rush of gratefulness in his veins to become an aching sadness. After today, he can never even hope to have Draco near him, close to him, want him. Because Draco had to Stun him to get him to stop hurting his friends. Because Draco had to piece Ron and Hermione back together by himself when he himself was more broken than he let on. Because Draco Malfoy is becoming a better person and Harry is slowly but surely becoming a despicable one.
But if Harry isn’t here or in the kitchen, there’s nowhere else he could be, so he must have left. Confusion creeps up Draco’s spine, wrapping his brain with it. No explanations float to him from the corners of Harry’s room, no understanding dawns upon him for the coffee cup still clenched in his right hand.
“Snape was in time to save my life, not to make me look pretty,” Draco says, sharper than intended. He’s had that comment flung his way before as though being scarred is something to be ridiculed.Then knowing Harry didn’t mean it quite like that, he softens and says, “I didn’t want you to react like this. It’s alright.”
“That’s what they all call me,” they say, cutting him off. “But most don’t sit across from me and have conversations about it. There’s no melodrama involved, as you called it. Just perception.”
Knows that she catches on in a split second.
‘I just want you back.’ This time, Draco’s voice breaks over the words and a lone tear slides down his cheek.
“That’s good to know then,” Harry says with a bashful expression that Draco wants to kiss right off his stupidly handsome face. So he does.
“And if you don’t do something with this grotesque, undeserved, pathetic life of yours, I’m going to end it with my bare hands.”
“I received the letter.”
“You’re a dick, Draco,” Harry says. “Yeah, you’re not always kind and brilliant or whatever but I… you care. You’re trying and it’s made a difference and the person you are is not the person you were and I’m actually liking the person I’m getting to know. He’s funny and he’s careful and he’s honest and he’s really bloody good in bed—”
“You know it is dangerous?” Potter asks, voice lower than it has been.
Draco gapes.
“What are you doing?” He asks Draco.
Potter’s green eyes are dark with the thunderstorms of whatever righteous anger he feels. Dench’s unnaturally white teeth are clenching down on his lower lip. By the time Potter is summoned, Draco is exhausted. Watching one’s own fate be decided in this manner feels treacherous. Feels like sneaking into God’s workshop to hear his deliberations.
“She’s at Durmstrang. Getting her NEWTS. She left after Fred’s funeral. We never, we didn’t…” he trails off, looking slightly lost.
“Do you know why the Blacks named their children after constellations? Galaxies?
She cocks her head to the side. Pointedly she brings her gaze down to rest on his ring– the seven emeralds gleaming bright. “Interesting,” she murmurs. “I’ll keep that in mind.”
‘I’m sorry I asked,’ he says, quietly. ‘It’s not that I don’t trust you but…”
“He didn’t do that.”
“I had sex with people at funerals. Especially the Muggle-Born ones. They had all these distant relatives coming in, all these people who barely knew the dead body in a coffin but still felt obligated to come and say goodbye. I felt something similar. You’d be surprised to know how many people are willing to have sex in graveyards.”
“Topping? Bottoming? Who puts their dick where?”
So when Ron pulls him into a strong bear hug, it takes Harry some time to process what the bloody hell is going on. Instead of cold words or shouted insults, Ron is whispering in his ear, you bloody fool, you scared us, why won’t you just fucking talk to us, Harry, mate, we fucking love you, and Harry feels the tears come to his eyes.
All he can do is blink.
“I thought they were still together,” he eventually offers.
The corners of her lips are twitching as though she is trying to hold back a smile and Draco can’t help it but he bursts out laughing.
The man is speaking words Draco isn’t able to process and Dench is nodding along beside him, looking serious and grave with a touch of unbearable smugness about his eyes.
Draco agrees. When the guard pushes him forward, he sees no point in resisting.
(That’s something Aunt Hermione has brought up more than once with both Harry and Draco, looking down pointedly at their still gleaming wedding rings.)
Instead, Granger, Potter and Weasley are sitting in three separate chairs, each one of them staring right at him. Granger is sitting with a mildly amused expression on her face, Weasley just looks confused and slightly bored and Potter… Potter is staring at him intensely, the flames of the fire flickering in his eyes, making the vibrant green an eerie shade of yellow. If he hadn’t been on the Draught, now would be when he would be spiralling straight into one of those moments where his thoughts take over, jamming his brain, making everything inside twenty times louder and muting the outside, moments which usually end up in him blacking out and waking up disoriented and confused. But the Draught keeps his heart from racing and he does his best to reign his thoughts in. Instead of blacking out, he swallows twice, focuses on Granger and says “Thank you for inviting me.” He swallows a couple more time before nodding to Potter and Weasley.
He takes a long, deep breath. He just signed up to meet Granger on short notice in Potter’s house which is placed under a Fidelius Charm. Draco has always known something was deeply wrong with him but in the absence of anything else occupying his mind the way the Dark Lord did, it is becoming more apparent than he would like.
“No, that was Umbridge, shut up—”
“Okay,” he whispers eventually.
“Did you get your NEWTS?” Harry asks after a while.
“Come on, Malfoy,” Harry pleads. He isn’t sure why he’s here, pleading with Malfoy to join him for a drink. If it weren’t so absurd, it would probably be a little pathetic. But absurd is better than the predictable routines Harry is trying his best to avoid, and if Malfoy is the ticket to an interesting evening, Harry will take it. At fifteen, Harry would have scoffed at the idea of spending anything remotely close to a ‘pleasant evening’ with Malfoy. At seventeen, the prospect is almost mellow. “I’ve been making impulsive decisions all week. What’s one more?”
A tiny, traitorous part of Harry’s brain wonders what it would be like to share a room with Malfoy.
“What you are,” says Granger, punctuated her words with distinct chops with her knife and an air of finality, “is my friend.”
Draco seems happier here than he did in Florence or in San Gimignano. There, he had been burdened by the weight of his exile and the weight of nostalgia. Here he exists, the shell of the old Draco Malfoy falling away to reveal the man who gets excited by history, by the prospect of passing by Keats’ house, marvels open-mouthed at the marble steps and stone archways.
He doesn’t. He really doesn’t have a goddamn clue.
“Well, I’ll be seeing you around, then,” and Draco feels like a pardoned criminal, clearly dismissed.
“Sorry, just– I mean– Potter and Weasley. They’re staring at me like they would love to eat me alive. I can’t, I can’t talk with them sitting outside.”
There is still no pride.
There’s a sound outside. The warden perhaps—his empty stomach tightens and his brain prepares for the inevitable onslaught. But then the round face of his barrister is visible through the bars of his cell. He’s standing inside a protective bubble full of the light and warmth of a non-corporeal Patronus and if Draco’s envy could manifest, it would choke the man on its poisoned vines.
Harry looks away. “I thought that was you being polite.”
He needs to make it right.
Draco tries. His throat does not cooperate. He blinks again and Harry understands.
Harry’s magic seems to know him, seems to seek him out, and Draco wants to lose himself in this moment to never be found. If he died now, not only would he die happy, he would die content. It is more than he had ever dreamed of his future entailing and it is more than he deserves, but Draco Malfoy is not a man in the habit of denying himself so he indulges, luxuriating in the feel of his hands on Harry and Harry’s hands in him.
with what they’re saying.”
Draco watches the Weasleys slump over the body of their fallen brother with a sick twist in the pit of his stomach. The brood-mother—Molly, he corrects himself, wincing, is bent over her son’s chest, sobbing uncontrollably into a chest that will not swell with breath again. The father has his son’s head cradled in his lap, tears falling freely down a face lined and shadowed with immeasurable pain.
Harry scowls.
Draco isn’t certain when it happened, but by the evening of Harry’s birthday, Pansy and Harry aren’t friends, but the ice between them has thawed just enough for the day to have been enjoyable despite the awkwardness. They’d gone out for breakfast which had been derailed enough by a brief bout of rain to become brunch. Pansy had regaled Draco with stories of Blaise’s letters from the USA and Daphne’s attempts to find a job, both of which were sad if you let yourself dwell on reality. Draco finds out Astoria is doing quite well in school and that Pansy’s elder sister is engaged to be married.
That they had fallen out of love, when wands were raised in the courtroom, Draco and Harry facing each other down with jaws clenched in rage and eyes barely disguising the depth of hurt in them.
“Alright, alright” Potter says, lifting his hands in a gesture of surrender. His palms are broad, Draco notices. He’s wearing a slightly clunky watch around his right wrist and his heart line is particularly deep, visible clearly all the way across the table. “I want to come because I don’t know where I’m supposed to be going and I’m scared that I’m going to find out my drive to leave this place only lasts fifteen minutes because the rest of the world is too big and I’ve never been…” he shrugs, “Anywhere, really. If you let me come, it would help keep us both on track.”
Eventually Draco breaks it. “Look, Potter, you spoke at my trials, I will be eternally thankful for that. It spared me Azkaban. My mother still writes to me, requesting me to thank you on her behalf. Father, when he’s allowed, curses your existence but he has to admit that his wife, whom he has loved more than himself was spared his fate because of you.”
Draco backs away, stung.
Harry holds up a hand to stop Malfoy’s rushed word vomit. “She’s not my girlfriend,” he says. “She hasn’t been, since I left—for, for seventh year.”
Malfoy continues to stare.
And that was how he’d been roped into donating large sums of money to a research facility working with Wolfsbane, another fund for War orphans and investing in Lavender Brown’s up and coming skincare line for witches of colour.
“Bastard,” he says, and grins, his dimples pools of shadow in the warm curves of his cheeks. Draco pulls him down and presses a soft kiss to the left one, letting it linger. His heart races as he wonders if it’s been too revealing, too emotional and if Harry will finally draw away, but Harry’s breath hitches and his grip tightens on Draco’s arms.
Pansy leaves in three days, and Harry’s relationship with her improves significantly. By the time she’s leaving, she’s progressed to the point where the hug between them is awkward but not stiff, where a parting smile is natural, not offensively mocking.
“Is the fact that your sense of identity a lost cause Granger’s fault?”
He does not expect Malfoy to get up, knuckles white around the stem of his wine glass and disappear into the hallway that Harry knows leads to the staircase.
Harry hums.
“The first time I brought you here and that thing happened between you and Harry,  I got so mad at him.  I was fired up and angry because he barely spoke to us, kept himself locked up in his room with the curtains closed, drank continuously in the evenings, spoke awfully to me, barely spoke to Ron, stopped speaking to the Weasleys. He was angry and he would break things every time his anger spiked with accidental magic. He didn’t eat the meals we cooked, threw around the fact that it was his house and that day… that day it reached a tipping point.” She draws in a deep breath and lets it out slowly.
For one moment, time is stretched so thin, it doesn’t quite feel quite real. Draco simply stares at Harry, the contours of his face, the sharp line of his jaw, the edges of his curls violating the boundaries of his forehead to fall into his eyes. Draco raises one wandering hand and traces an arched eyebrow, marvelling at the way even this simple motion causes Harry’s eyes to fall shut and his breath to catch.
If it isn’t, well.
Harry winces at the volume of Malfoy’s words and the looks they get from the other patrons at that.
Potter sighs, an exasperated exhalation of air. “What do I do to tell you I’m not a figment of your imagination, Malfoy?”
At some point during that admission, a no doubt painful, wringing, heart wrenching admission, Harry had grasped onto Draco’s clenched hand beneath the covers, gently pried apart the fingers and twined them together. Now Harry brings their conjoined hands out and kisses Draco’s fingers where they contrast beautifully against his own skin.
Draco screams.
Draco hums softly as he moves lower, down Harry’s chest. He raises a hand and pinches one of Harry’s nipples, which leaves him arching and moaning beneath Draco. When Harry’s eyes open, he sees Draco smirking slightly.
Draco’s breath catches. When Harry turns to look at him, he finds the grey eyes fixed on him, a strange uncertainty in them.
Silence reigns.
Draco doesn’t draw attention to the fact that he still hasn’t agreed to show Potter.
“It’s my house, Hermione.” The words are out before he can stop them.
He can feel Granger’s eyes on the side of his neck. “Sometimes I think talking to you would be good for him. But he’s too stubborn and you’re too… volatile.”
Luna is sitting in a chair by the bed, wearing warm yellow robes. Her earrings, Harry thinks has moth wings on them. The serene smile on her face is contagious and before he knows it, he’s shooting her a weary smile and saying, “It’s good to see you.”
“Figures they’d disappear now,” he murmurs, and Harry wants to demand he make sense of those words, but Scorpius turns back to him with a look in his eyes so weary and exhausted that instead of sixteen, he looks centuries old.
Whatever Harry had expected of Malfoy, it hadn’t been what he immediately proceeds to do, which is smile bright enough to rival the sun at its best and bend down to lift the squawking elf into his arms and spin him around.
“Sure,” Potter says, recovering quickly, mouth twisting into a little snarl. “Your father wasn’t wrong about
Draco materialises behind Parkinson, shirtless and doing up his belt and Harry’s eyes widen. Parkinson turns to look over her shoulder and seeing Draco in his state of undress, widens her eyes too, and when Draco looks up to see them staring at him, he turns a little pink and stammers out a curse and they’re three awkward idiots standing in the doorway of an Italian hotel, staring at each other.
“I do,” he responds with a sad smile. “Very much.”
He screams again, when Harry brings the hand holding his hip down to fondle his balls. He cradles them and strokes them, gentle and firm in alternating brushes of his skilful fingers. “It’s like stroking a clit, a bit,” Harry had admitted once. Even that memory isn’t strong enough to remotely diminish the heights of pleasure he’s reaching right now.
There’s a sound and it’s devastating.
Malfoy squeezes his eyes shut. He drops his fork, nods and after clenching and unclenching his hands a few times begins, “Right then. Thank you for the meal–”
The tip of a thick finger slides into his hole gently. It hurts like hell, burns like it too and Draco gasps at the strange, foreign sensation.
“Do you need me to leave?” Harry asks, and oh, the question hurts because Draco doesn’t really want Harry to leave, but Harry staying is a trigger for the memories of a strange boy with a swollen face sitting in his living room, held at wand-point by Snatchers.
“You need to stop saying that,” says a voice to his right and Draco startles terribly.
“You won’t,” he whispers, because there isn’t much else to say, really.
“You call me Death,” they say, “but that is just the part of me that is easier to grasp.”
“Of course not,” Potter says, indignant righteousness lacing his words. “Why would you even
“Me talking about graveyard sex didn’t put you off?” Harry asks, leaning in closer. Draco tries to push him away, looking annoyed but Harry moves in, closing the gap till their eyes are so close that Harry can see the flecks of brilliant blue in Draco’s irises. “Wow, you must really like me.”
Harry’s tired. He doesn’t know what happened to him but he knows it sunk the weight of his burdens into his bones. “Back to Britain,” he says. “Don’t worry Malfoy, I know when I’m not wanted.”
To be honest, Draco has no idea how they are holding off for so long but every minute seems to be building up, seems to be setting into motion the grander scheme of things. Draco might be impatient but he knows that whatever is coming is definitely worth the wait.
Training, Harry thinks with a bitter smirk. All that pure-blood pomp and show, all the haughtiness bred into him since he was a precocious child blooming into an insufferable bastard of a teenager. He remembers the way Malfoy’s laughter sounded—high and nasty across the Great Hall. He remembers, more importantly, the cool mask of Malfoy’s superiority settling on his face when arguably, he should have been at his most vulnerable.
“Let’s go over the finer details of the proposal,” she had said, voice shaky but determined. Draco had acquiesced and they had spoken about it till they were hoarse and only had to review the whole thing once more before presenting it first to the Minister and then to the Council. When they couldn’t speak anymore, Granger had taken to staring off into space and Draco had played with the flames of the fire, changing their colours and turning them into dancing animals with magic.
“Maybe I do understand his circumstances better,” Death says. Scorpius might be imagining it, but the ever-changing eyes seem to have gone a bit wide. “Or rather, what he meant by an open, honest relationship with his son who suggested inappropriate relations.”
Harry begins to press open mouthed kisses to Draco’s straining cock through the thin material of his pants and Draco almost sobs with the urgency thrumming through his veins. His fingertips crackle with latent magic, and one of Harry’s hands leaves his hips to palm at his own cock, which Draco realises is just as hard in the confines of his comparatively loose, and yet woefully ill equipped jeans.
Who hasn’t been there for a while now.
begging for a reason.
It hurts more than he thought he would.
But right now, with the memories of the war so raw, with the nightmares of empty tents and cold pools with a necklace stringing him to death, Ron lying broken and bloody in the middle of a forest, the mere thought of going on a trip with them fills Harry with nervous anxiety.
"My friend," she gently said, "you have not heard me mourn;
The idea of a shower holds definite appeal. Cool hair, cleanliness, maybe some soap. But the effort it will take for him to stand… Harry doesn’t want to bother.
“That letter was never an apology. Do you know what was?”
Hermione shakes her head. “Luna’s not the type to hold grudges. She would be happy to help. If you want, I could get in touch with her.”
Eventually he’d given in, the image of his mother’s perfect chignon torn askew by stray hexes, the bruise on her throat purple and painful flashing behind his eyes. If for nothing else, for her sake he needs to try to come out of this dark hole he and his father have dug themselves into. For her sake he needs to try to ensure this hole is not his grave.
“What do I have to be grateful for?” Draco demands, abruptly angry. “I’m in exile. My mother won’t look at me properly because I refuse to use our dried-up well of contacts to get father out of Azkaban. When I go back, I won’t be seen as a respectable pure-blood seeking employment, I will be the disgraced Death Eater, the untrustworthy idiot. People will spit on me in the streets.”
Warm wetness floods Draco’s arse.
In a way, he supposes it does. Blaise had weathered Draco through his obsessive periods when hearing Potter’s name would rile him up, seeing him in the hallways would make his accidental magic run wild. Blaise remembers the Draco from Hogwarts who had spent six years vying for attention he claimed not to want but exulted in when provided, however negative.
“Okay.”
“What?” he asks, and cringes at how irritable it sounds. He schools his expressions into neutrality when Potter turns towards him and scowls.
Harry’s heart swells with an ache so profound, he swallows against it.
It’s the way Malfoy’s sides and face go slightly in an out of focus, the way his lips appear dreadfully chapped in the moment just before a blink. He knows that Hermione can probably see it as well and the confirmation that Malfoy steps out in public under an industrial grade Glamour Charm twists Harry’s stomach in knots he doesn’t know how to unravel.
“Still?” Lovegood asks. “I thought you spoke to him.”
“Someone agreed to testify? You said my mother couldn’t—”
He swivels his head at the painful, stretched angle required to look at Potter the best he can with his feet still shackled to the poles of the chair and says, “I would like to apologise to Harry Potter for having been a… bully and a bigot. Alongside him, I would like to extend the same apology to countless others who have been subjected to the whims and fancies and privileged rages and outright bullying of a boy who thought he owned the world. And last, but not least, I would like to… thank Harry Potter. And Luna Lovegood and Dean Thomas and Ginevra Weasley and all the others who have submitted their memories and testimonies speaking for me. I… did not… that is to say I… thank them. For it all. And regardless of the respected Wizengamot’s decision, both my apology and my gratitude stand.”
Kingsley’s eyes soften. It’s the most he’s given Draco up until now. His words, if possible, are kinder still. “Travel,” Kingsley says. “Get out of here and see the world for what it is outside your mansion and your father’s friends and their beliefs. Take this sentence as an opportunity. You have the money, Draco. You have the time. Don’t squander it on meaningless pursuits.”
Somewhere a bell tolls. Draco doesn’t know if it is the ominous nature of his memory or simply a cosmic joke. He looks away, face hot, eyes burning. There is no solace to be found in faces, so he looks down at the floor.
A Glamour so well spelled that it was undetectable.
“Leave?”
He’s taken aback by his own words because he hadn’t really thought them through- they’d just transferred themselves without his permission into the uncomfortable space between them. But Potter nods anyway and Draco feels an odd sense of both relief and finality.
When they pull apart, Harry looks slightly dazed but so pleased that Draco could perhaps replace the sun with the smile on Harry’s face. But soon enough the expression turns slightly serious and Harry asks, “Do you want to go on about the scars?”
Just as abruptly as he’d begun, Harry stops attending to his chest and brings his attention back down.
She stretches her legs out under the table, and yawns. “Are you not sleeping well?” he finds himself asking. He regrets it immediately when she shoots him a sheepish grin and says, “Oh no, nothing like that. Just last night that we–“ she blushes and Draco holds up a hand.
He knows Hermione knows because one day she brings it up in casual conversation. “Did you give any thought to taking Harry to the Ball? He still doesn’t have a date. Like last time,” she says when the conversation goes from Ginevra’s breakup with Finnegan to Potter’s improving grades.
Harry’d be lucky to last a year.
Draco heads downstairs, heart pounding. He doesn’t feel safe leaving Granger alone up there but he reminds himself that she is a capable witch who was the mastermind behind Voldemort’s downfall.
He can't help but stare at her before saying incredulously, “
“That timeline doesn’t have to be within my exile if you don’t want it to be,” Draco says. Harry still holds his breath when the word comes up in conversation—
“No one likes to be exposed as the other woman, now do they?” he drawls. It’s a weak rejoinder, weaker than anything Draco has ever thrown at Potter, a barb directed more towards himself if anything, but it makes Potter flinch.
“He looked, he looked like a bloody corpse today, ‘Mione!” Harry bursts out. Hermione’s eyes widen. “He, he wasn’t wearing a shirt and he was talking like he was on Muggle drugs… no filter, completely out of it, bloody hell, if I hadn’t known he was the only one on the property, I would have thought he was someone else!”
Harry smiles in exasperation– he knows she wants to boss around the others in the department by actually giving them something to do, assuming some power as the bloody Head Auror’s secretary and when he finds some particularly boring reports that has traditionally been the Head’s duty to fill out or look through, he relegates it to the pile to be given away simply to give her a laugh.
“No one fucking understands,” Potter mutters, shaking his head.
“Where to?” He asks bewildered and wary. He’s somewhat sure she will not lead him to a slaughterhouse, even if she does appear to be slightly unhinged with these cryptic requests and questions but in the post-war climate, one can never be completely sure.
Draco cannot stand, his hands are shackled to the wooden armrests, and his feet are weighted down.
These bedrooms are not the ones where the Death Eaters lived or where Muggles were tortured. In fact, when the Death Eaters had come to the Manor, Narcissa had shut off the East Wing entirely. With everything that has happened within its walls, the Manor is now known as Voldemort’s Headquarters but sometimes everyone, including Draco forgets how large the damn thing really is, how much of it wasn’t the abode of Death Eaters or Voldemort but instead remnants of the proud history the Malfoy lineage has always boasted. The East Wing, though extremely large and practically half of the house, was left untouched by the carnage that took place here, not because of Narcissa’s careful locking charms but because it simply wasn’t required. What was already there was enough for the thirty Death Eaters of Voldemort’s inner circle, chosen carefully to live with him. Thugs like Crabbe Sr. and Goyle Sr., beasts like Greyback, lunatics like Bellatrix and Rodolphus and crafty villains like Rabastan, Macnair and Nott. Draco shudders at the memories of some of those who had touched the walls of his house, slept in the beds, eaten at the tables.
answer?”
Harry has never been more confused in his life. “What the bloody hell are you saying?” He peers into Malfoy’s eyes, trying to discern if the pupils are blown. “Have you been drinking?”
Potter sighs and comes closer. “Can I sit on the bed?”
. He sounds coarse and rough, and exactly like he’s spent the last few minutes deepthroating Draco’s cock, and it’s delicious in ways Draco does not know where to begin to list.
“Lucky for you, I didn’t.”
“Does Harry know you’re here?” He asks.
“I like it both ways,” Harry shrugs. “It’s a different feel either way.”
“Harry, Ron and I. We’re living together you see, it’s all still a bit chaotic what with Fred… the Burrow isn’t somewhere the three of us wanted to land up in, Molly has enough on her plate after all and- I’m sure you don’t care at all but it’s, well, Harry lost his owl a while back, Hagrid gave him the owl before first year, he was quite attached, and now he refuses to buy a new one so Ron and I, we don’t–”
“India?” Ron asks, baffled before saying, “Oh wait, because you’re—oh.”
Weasley takes two very deep breaths and says, “You’ve got it all wrong. Yes, I agree, before kissing someone, you should ask them if they are okay with it, if you should do it. But you didn’t. But here’s the deal, Malfoy, Harry wanted it. He wanted it again. And again. And again. And instead, you ran away like he had burned you so he thought the worst. That you had made a bad, impulsive decision and regretted it immediately.”
“It’s
his body screams to anyone who looks.
Draco hasn’t been to the Astronomy Tower since he was in sixth year. He dropped Astronomy the first chance he got and McGonagall seemed to understand though his mother didn’t. Both the Black and the Malfoy families had been serious students of Astronomy with NEWTS in the subject. Draco didn’t care. Dumbledore’s glassy eyes as he fell haunt his nightmares almost everyday.
He pauses briefly before opening the door, the stray thought that Potter of all people should never see him like this–
Sometimes she reads at the table but he notices how her eyes keep shifting to the door as though she is hoping against hope that Potter will make an appearance. Anytime the doors swing open, her head jerks up, anytime someone brushes past her, a hopeful expression makes its way onto her face only to drop. Sometimes she notices him staring and schools her face into neutrality but it isn’t as successful as she would probably like it to be. There’s only so much someone can do to mask the depth of their emotions, especially Gryffindors used to wearing their hearts on their sleeves and their thoughts on their faces.
“I’m in love,” he whispers into the leather of the beanbag. “He’s married, planning for a family, and I’m in love with him.”
visitors.
I love him.
Narcissa hadn’t said anything.
‘Yes,’ he responds. His voice isn’t steady, it breaks down the middle.
“Woman?” Draco prompts. “No, I suppose not. Ought not to get it wrong when that’s what drew you to me in the first place, huh?”
“Why the sudden change of heart?” Ginny asks. “You’ve been fighting Voldemort since you were eleven, and now that he’s dead, you’re suddenly sick of it?”
“It’s a Saturday, Draco, spare me some time.”
The door opens and bangs shut, and finally the Silencing Charm on the room falls. Somewhere far away, an owl shrieks.
“Just a scar,” Draco whispers, meeting Harry’s eyes. Impulsively he reaches up to trace the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead with the tip of his fingers. “Just like this one.”
When they part, gasping for breath, Harry’s eyes remain closed while he chases Draco just slightly. Then a blissful smile creeps up onto his lips and his eyelashes flutter slightly. But just before he opens his eyes, just before Draco can lose himself in wave after wave of ecstasy at seeing those green, vibrant eyes look up at him, panic courses through him like a Stunner to the chest.
“You’re certain?”
“What was that?” Harry asks, when the silence grows uncomfortable.
The word is a sentence in itself, and he watches the way half the courtroom shakes their sorrowful, resigned heads at their notebooks where they jot down his plea in unison.
‘Never had any,’ Harry gasps, as Draco brings his mouth back down to suckle at Harry’s already bruised and tender collarbone. ‘Thought you knew.’
Draco turns a page of his newspaper. “Take your time,” he says. “I’ll be there.”
“I hope Padma still has her box. She has Ma’s favourite pair in it, the pretty glass bangles with the gold leaves. I wore those to the Yule Ball with you. Lavender said I looked like a princess.”
“Draco,” she finally says, looking up, exasperated. “I said we were
It frustrates Draco to no end.
Draco doesn’t smile. “Saptarshi and Arundhati. Indian names. The Blacks weren’t the biggest fans, but they accepted it, grieving mother and all.”
“When I came here,” Malfoy says and Harry is jerked rudely out of his reverie, “Father told me Firenze wasn’t done justice to by the Muggles.”
Draco nods and tries to steer clear of the line of his thought that seems to fixate on the combination of Potter and eating in the same sentence.
Realising that knocking was a no go, he clears his throat and says, “Harry, it’s me.”
“Were you?” Draco asks, expression suddenly sober and serious. He doesn’t look upset, but he looks… determined.
“Right,” says Draco faintly.
Right now, he thinks he might also be attracted to everything Potter keeps hidden under his terrible clothes, to the curves of him that seem to tease Draco when the jeans cling in the right places, to the edges of him shown off when his shirt hugs the muscles of his shoulders. He’s not muscled in the way fit Quidditch players are or the Muggles who Draco sometimes sees running in the gyms are. He’s still shaking off the awkward gangly elongations of puberty and the teenage awkwardness that Draco still finds himself succumbing to. But he is striking, a charming, off-centre elegance surrounding him with an aura of approachable attractiveness.
Oblivious.
His head snaps up at that. The guilt in her eyes, in every line of her clenched jaw, in the tightness of her mouth is evident. She sighs when their eyes meet and he wonders how half an hour has reduced the bubbly delight of a person on the sidewalk to
“I don’t understand it,” Potter says, and he sounds so lost, that if it were another man, or if Draco himself were another man, he’d have reached out to touch him. “I don’t know why I came here, I don’t know why I spoke for you. I don’t even really know why I went back for you. In the fire.”
“Indeed it is, Pansy Parkinson,” Harry says, and smirks when she catches on and winces a little. “Why are you here?”
Draco gives her a wry smile. “Potter doesn’t see someone?”
He doesn’t know why she’s treating him like a friend. They aren’t friends. They’re tentative acquaintances who know each other through Harry Potter and Hermione Granger and make small talk at social gatherings but otherwise stay out of each other’s hair.
Draco sighs. “I just didn’t think he would want to hear from me. I would have written an apology but after he had time to come back from it.”
“I want to see David,” Potter says and for a split second Draco is surprised he even knows what David is. His ever traitorous mind superimposes Potter’s face, sculpted like a dark god’s onto the fine boned grace of David’s musculature. Potter’s curling hair, his white streak of the magnificent scar, his eyes emotive and expressive behind the glasses. Draco imagines it all set in stone for the world to see and for the first time mourns his lack of artistic skill.
“But it stuck?”
“Oh!” Hermione’s hands fly up to her mouth and when she brings them away, there’s a wide, bright smile there. “Oh! Finally!” Then the situation catches up to her, Draco running away, Harry on the floor and her eyes widen. “Didn’t you want him to?!”
“I wish you all the happiness,” Harry has written. “I pray you can move on.”
“‘M hair,” he mumbles, trying to warn Draco, sure that he doesn’t want three days worth of gunk on his nails. Draco simply shushes him and keeps doing what he’s doing and the protest dies on Harry’s lips. It feels too good to give up.
“Working bathrooms?” Potter asks.
“Because you keep staring at his arse and I think you’ll find that it looks great in that Muggle suit he bought a couple of days ago.”
It’s from happier times. Scorpius is smiling, a fleck of chocolate on his chin, silver-grey eyes shining with the light of the stars that live on after his death.
“It’s not fine,” Harry says under his breath, swiping his hands through his hair, brushing errant strands out of his face. “It’s a fucking mess.”
It falls horrifyingly flat.
“Shh,” Draco says, and when Scorpius looks at him, he’s crying. He’s not even trying to hide it, simply letting the tears run tracks down his cheeks and drip onto the blue bedsheets. “Quiet, my boy, that’s not…” He trails off, unsure how to complete his sentence.
Determination seizes him. It isn’t fair. Harry has been shutting Draco out for a week without justifying it and Draco wants his friend back. He has been raised as the Malfoy scion, the only child of a wealthy, pureblood family. So when he wants something, he hasn’t been taught to be refused.
on unsuspecting children. I have firsthand knowledge of this. It led to great disappointment from all his family members except Narcissa Malfoy. At the very worst, he was a schoolyard bully but”—Potter braces himself visibly for what he’s about to say—“so were arguably my father and Sirius Black, my godfather, two of the men hailed today as war heroes and martyrs of the resistance. They were both given a chance to redeem themselves, and they did, despite Sirius’ unfortunate and unfair stint in Azkaban. How fair would this trial be if a seventeen-year-old boy isn’t offered the same chance?”
Malfoy shrugs again. He looks uncomfortable and a little embarrassed. “I don’t always know what to think but”—he points at a completely arbitrary building—“that was Domenico Ghirlandaio’s workshop.”
Draco narrows his eyes. ‘Black family cabin you say? The one you cleaned out with Bill?’
“Are you not allowed to answer, or do you just… not?” Scorpius asks again. He isn’t angry, or even upset. Death seems to have cast a film over his emotions. They’re all still there, just muted.
“Of course I’m disagreeing!” Draco says. “This is me, disagreeing. Not agreeing. Never agreeing to your absolutely bollocks plan to hang out together for a year! Is that what you want, Potter? For the kind Minister to find our bloated bodies in the English Channel and for the coroner to say that we’ve died by each other’s hand? Is that it, Potter—”
It tastes like freedom and a fate Draco does not deserve.
“But I’m dead.”
They prolong it as long as possible, mouths moving against each other’s, slotting together so perfectly that air is a secondary concern to the euphoric feel of the drag of the other’s lips. It isn’t kissing, Draco thinks, seeing stars behind his closed eyelids. This cannot just be kissing because Draco has kissed before and has been kissed before and none of it ever felt like this. This is dying, this is that split second before your soul leaves your body and your entire life flashes before your eyes, your best memories bidding you a fond farewell. This is dying and coming back to life again, knowing you have a second chance to do everything better, to do everything differently from the first time.
“It’s good to know, Draco,” is all she says though he knows by now that she probably has far more to actually tell him.
“You are the
“Love is a battlefield. Sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.”
Malfoy opens his mouth and shuts it. His eyes are a little wide and his hands are clenching and unclenching on the table. Harry knows it will take a while to break Malfoy’s conditioning, but in the brief but sincere nod he receives, there’s the sweet taste of a battle won.
Harry takes a minute to gather his thoughts. “I’m… angry,” he begins and is astounded by the weight that seems to lift from his shoulders when he says it out loud. “All the time. And when I’m not angry, I’m…” he reaches for a word before settling on, “numb. I want to break things or cast advanced spells which require magical exertion and watch things crumble because it makes me feel some sense of,” he stumbles for a word again, “satisfaction.”
He doesn’t know how to put it into words—the dual battle in his head, a war of attrition between the urge to simply do what he knows he needs to and to give himself time to get used to the ideas of it.
“So who are you taking to the Ball?” Hermione asks during Potions.
Harry has died once and if he must do it again so soon, for the last time, he wants to do it better.
Draco’s breath has long deserted him. Hs entire world has narrowed down to the feeling of Harry’s hands on his cock and Harry’s mouth whispering dirty things into his ears. With those words, if he has a choice, he can’t be the one to choose. To put Harry in that position, make him fall apart and put him back together? Or to be that vulnerable, to be that open and allow himself to be taken apart?
“So I’ll just stay here till one or both of them decide to die?” He asks, watching as Draco pours a glass out, dangerously overfilling it.
The rage vanishes from his system as instantaneously as it had encroached upon his senses in the first place. What’s the point of being angry in the face of truth? What’s the point driving a stake into a brick wall?
How no one else notices is beyond Draco. Maybe it’s just him who’s grown used to learning cues living with an insane megalomaniac in his house.
“Because you don’t want this.”
“Go home to your wife, Blaise.”
“Don’t Anne Frank me after this,” he would joke, laughing a little before coughing up blood. “I don’t want the Wizarding World judging my goodbyes. Promise me, Father.”
“Are you sure you want to know?”
This time the blush returns and Draco looks away, trying to stop the smile and not quite succeeding. Then he turns back and with a worried frown asks, “Wait. You’ve done it before?”
Harry nods jerkily.
“I went to see Malfoy today.”
If Draco is a sinner, Potter is salvation. If Draco is a wound, gaping and raw, Potter is a balm. Draco’s soul has been corrupted, he knows it, remembers it weighing heavy in his nightmares and his memories, in his instincts and his inhibitions. Perhaps it is the simple physics of magnetism that draws him—the blackened, corrupted corpse of him—like a moth to the flame of Potter’s purity.
“A week!”
They’re lounging on the armchairs on the patio, glasses of lemonade with a splash of vodka clutched in their hands. Gianni’s meticulous upkeep of the rose bushes is evident in the soft smell of them heavy in the air.
“He… he can’t tell where he is. He thinks he is still in the War. In the tent, or in Gringotts or at Hogwarts or…”
“The dead do not put stock in the signs of life,” says a voice behind him.
Potter nods, relief spreading across his features and Hermione shoots Draco a smile.
, Harry remembers Draco saying. He ought to know better now than to doubt Draco’s knowledge of his friends’ tendencies.
“I don’t… frankly, I don’t see the point of me asking for a divorce. I barely have grounds. You’re the bloody barrister, you know how to phrase these things yourself. You could just… I don’t know, write something up, sign it and hand it to me and when you move out, you’ll be a free man in every sense of the word.”
Draco’s heart skitters.
Draco’s hands have reached up to Harry’s back and he holds on there, scrabbling for purchase, gripping at Harry tightly enough for anyone to assume his life depends on it.
“You almost feel real,” Draco says. “If we weren’t us, I would believe we did that.”
He Accios a bottle of whisky from underneath the bed. It’s a Muggle brand but it burns fiercer than Firewhisky. He takes a swig straight from the bottle and revels in the way his throat seems to have been set aflame. He tries to wash away the taste of Draco from his mouth, feeling dirty, unwanted, used up but the scent of cinnamon and vanilla lingers on his upper lip and fills his nostrils with the scent. With every drink he tries to make it go away but it only gets stronger. Stronger. Stronger. Until all he can smell is Draco’s vanilla shampoo and his cinnamon shower gel, until the grey of those eyes takes over the world around Harry, until those soft hairs at the nape of his neck are all Harry can feel.
“Harry—” Percy begins, but subsides from a look his father sends his way.
“Good.”
By the time he’s loosened Harry’s jeans enough to slide them off his narrow hips, Draco is losing patience like a malfunctioning clock loses time. In one swift jerk, he pushes Harry’s jeans and pants down to mid thigh. Harry catches on, reaching down and pushing them as far they’ll go in this position and then proceeding to kick them off the last few inches until he’s looming over Draco, naked and gorgeous and glorious.
screams the way he jerks his arm upwards to test the give of the strap.
His heart drops down to his shoes and his stomach roils. Harry’s hand tightens in his and Weasley swears softly under his breath. Below, Kingsley looks to Hermione who appears completely unperturbed. “I approached Draco Malfoy with my project with the knowledge that he had been acquitted of War crimes. Crimes,” she pauses here, “against my own people, people who come from similar bloodlines as myself. Our antagonistic past relationship had led me to believe that Draco would only accept the proposal to associate the Malfoy name with something Pro-Muggle after their unfortunate War alliances but what I came to understand from our regular discussions and debates was that there was a reason that Draco Malfoy was acquitted. Seeing what he has seen, he understands better than most just how important a project like this is. Heading the Pureblood integration section of the project is his responsibility and thus far he has shown more than sufficient enthusiasm for it.”
But, breakfast.
Harry scowls, and oh, this is familiar, because within a second, the nervousness is gone and the aggression Harry keeps sequestered away is leaching into every line of his perfect form. He steps in, and the door bangs shut and Draco knows from experience that Harry has thrown up locking and silencing spells in the same gesture.
‘This gel?’ Draco asks, amused.
“I have five,” Draco says. “We could sit together some other time and finish it off. I’d read yours, you could read mine and we’d be done.”
He closes his mouth with a snap, mortified and ashamed of his eloquence deserting him in the minutes he’s required it most. This speech, possibly his last before an audience could be the determining stroke ascertaining his future. And yet, here he is, standing in the resounding echo of a fumbled apology and an assurance that he understands he is owed nothing.
“Since May, he’s been that way. A perfect nightmare, honestly. He barely talks and when he does its usually monosyllabic words. He hasn’t written to the Weasleys in months and he writes to Ron but its barely a sentence and I can tell Ron is getting more worried than he should be.”
He had laughed at her censoring herself, poking her in the ribs to remind her he’s fifteen and he hears worse on a daily basis from all his mates in the Ravenclaw Tower after Professor Longbottom sets them homework. He’d dodged the question for then.
Draco chooses not to comment on Harry’s tone or his choice of words. It’s the right decision apparently because Harry sags a little and brings his own hands to rest on top of Draco’s. “I’m sorry,” he says. “I just, I don’t know how to talk about this but I think I have to. I know I don’t have to but I much rather would. I know it doesn’t seem that way but I…” he flounders but stops stuttering over his words at Draco’s reassuring squeeze.
Draco thinks, morosely pouring himself another shot.
, the chant in his brain screams, rising with a thousand clamouring voices.
Draco is quiet for a minute before he laughs a little.
His hands fall like dead weights to the bed, but he still brings them to rub his aching, bruised wrists.
Harry who’s lower lip is trembling just slightly. Harry who leans into his touch when Draco raises a hand to his cheek.
Her voice is even, careful. It betrays no hint of what she’s feeling and Harry has no idea when Hermione learnt to be so careful. The realisation that to navigate the minefields that are him and Ron, set off at the wrong word, she must have
There are innumerable others from other Death Eaters, some taking out their frustration while others did a victory run on his skin. Some parts of his flesh have no scars, no marks but they are more tender than they should be. There’s Crucio Curse damage but that’s minor in comparison to what others have suffered. Just some trembling when he uses his right hand too extensively.
They spend their nights exploring each other.
Only by his standards, of course. Harry and Draco would probably be glad for an honest response.
When Draco hears the knock on his door, he buries his face in his pillow. He’s not in the mood to deal with more of Potter’s rage.
He drags a fingernail over the most curious of all of Harry’s scars, hex damage spreading over the centre of his chest, like bolts of lightning in the night sky.
‘I’d put something in you, but I don’t have lube,’ says Draco and Harry knows something is coming by the amused way in which Draco utters those words. ‘I guess I have to… find another way, don’t I?’
Malfoy nods, swallows and says, “Weasley and Potter didn’t.”
Granger looks up from her Potions book, a surprised expression on her face. “Harry? No! Harry and Ginny, they broke up before the War, actually.”
Potter blinks at him.
Kingsley is brusque as ever. “Because punishment must fit the crime and your faults seem to be a sequence of terrible decisions made with the intention of sparing your family the Dark Lord’s heavy hand. I understand that your perspective on judgement is skewed”— he casts a significant look towards Draco’s covered left arm—“but we have made it a point to construct our systems on justice.”
The colour, Harry thinks, love coursing through his veins for the man standing before him, looking for all the world like he has won the lottery at the prospect of teaching hundreds of Muggle-born children, does indeed bring out his eyes.
He looks up once more and yet again, their eyes meet. Draco can’t help but wonder how, through the sea of yellow and blue, they always manage to find each other so effortlessly. There’s movement towards Draco’s right, startling him out of his reverie and he jerks his head sharply, but it’s just a house-elf cleaning up spilled juice from a First Year’s lap. When he looks back, Potter’s seat at the Gryffindor table is empty. Draco turns around, surprised, and is just in time to see the doors of the Hall close shut.
he’d told her.
In dreams, there are no papers, no court cases, no journalists sending him owls trying to extract a double meaning from ‘no comment’.
He doesn’t take very long to pick up on something and once he does, he doesn’t forget. In three days he knows how not to pulverise Draco’s toes, in six he knows how to follow fairly well.
A raised eyebrow.
He reckons they aren’t. It’s a freeing thought. There are no expectations tying him down for this. He can just be and Draco will let him fall. Draco will catch him and if he can’t, they will fall together into whatever awaits.
“Have you eaten something?” Harry asks, and Draco is so distracted that he doesn’t even register the question. It’s only when Harry pokes him sharply in the rib that he actually startles and asks Harry to repeat.
He looks away.
He thinks back to the last two days, Malfoy’s careful lack of antagonism, his most offensive behaviours being astonishment at the upkeep of a Muggle establishment and his lack of understanding of Muggle money.
Scorpius opens his eyes to bright light and a sense of unfamiliar emptiness, instinctively aware that he isn’t alive.
The veil lifts, the haze covering his emotions shifts away with the gulps of drink he takes. It all hits him at once, the euphoria of having been kissed so thoroughly, so magnificently. The bliss of that one perfect moment after they had broken apart with Harry’s eyes still closed, Draco’s breath ghosting over his lips, his fingers still stroking Harry’s jaw gently.
Potter gets up and walks away.
Draco is exquisite in bed.
Draco smiles a little. Knocks back the rest of his whisky. “I don’t want Muggles or Muggle-borns dead, Potter, thank you. You needn’t worry.”
Today he sees Draco first, his head lolling back in the chair. It’s a perpetual problem every time he falls asleep by Scorpius’ bed– his frame too tall for the chair to accommodate him entirely. Draco’s taken to wincing in pain these days when he turns his head too sharply and more than once Scorpius has noticed him rolling his shoulders, trying to work out the kinks and cricks.
“I think I’ve had enough of fighting Dark Wizards, thanks Perce,” Harry interjects, cutting off what was definitely going to devolve into a lecture about why he should at least acquire the necessary qualifications for Aurorship.
When Harry’s hands finally come to rest on the hem of Draco’s shirt, it doesn’t feel like a perversion of something Draco wants but can’t have, doesn’t feel like another aggressive attempt on Harry’s part to get through his life without breaking into a million shards. It feels natural, and it feels like home, and Draco feels a pressure behind his eyelids that he blinks away rapidly.
When he has the presence of mind to race up the stairs to the bedroom she shares with Ron, he finds her pushing a Weasley jumper into the beaded purse from which the expanding charm was never removed.
Still yours, Draco. Still yours.
“Draco Malfoy’s father is Lucius Malfoy, a man known to hold deeply prejudiced, dangerous and misguided notions about Muggle-borns and half-bloods. Lucius Malfoy placed Ginevra Molly Weasley’s life, when she was eleven years old, in extreme danger by acquainting her with a Dark Artefact wherein she gained access to a part of Tom Riddle’s mind. In the well-known battle of the Department of Mysteries, where my godfather Sirius Black passed away, Lucius Malfoy displayed no qualms when attacking students far less magically proficient than him with Dark Curses. I was there. I saw the man. I am more than certain that his disregard for the lives of vulnerable children extended to the one in his own home.
The look on her face is speculative. She seems to be sizing him up, reading into his expression with a frighteningly intense gaze. At long last, when the staring contest has begun to get a tad awkward and his eyes sting from not blinking, she sighs. “Sit down, Malfoy,” she says. “ I’m going to make tea. Don’t think of going somewhere else, don’t think of drawing your wand, don’t think of anything funny, sit down and wait for me or I’ll make sure you live to regret it.”
He shouts, a litany of profanities falling from his lips and Harry reaches down and places his hand over Draco’s clenched fist.
he thinks, the word floating through his senses. It sounds mechanical when the voices in his ears whisper it, the grating harmony of the syllables unfamiliar. It feels like the moment when the shackles had been lifted from his hands, the weight of the surly guard’s justified anger cutting into him instead.
They both go on, scratching their quills against parchment, as though she hadn’t told him repeatedly that he might be able to get through to Potter if they’d both just put their stubbornness aside and have a conversation.
Undressing a partner has always been something intimate and glorious for Draco. It is no different this time as he unbuttons Harry’s black cotton shirt, each fastening falling open to reveal inch by glorious inch of brown skin that makes Draco’s mouth water. There’s the smell of the cologne Harry uses, strong and heady, filling Draco’s senses and his mouth falls open, lips parting subconsciously as his tongue flicks out to wet his lips.
“I built up a tolerance,” he explains to Potter. “I’ve been taking it regularly for so long that now it just… doesn’t work. I need a third of the bottle every day or I…” He looks up to see Potter still staring. His expression isn’t quite as hard, more curious than anything. If Draco allows himself, he sees traces of sympathy somewhere. “I have panic attacks. Granger called them that.”
“What did you say?” Draco asks because no other words are left within his brain.
“Get back to it, Potter, fuck you.”
“Go to bed,” he repeats, gently. She looks at the pillow beside Weasley, reluctant longing in her gaze.
He keeps repeating the same words, that she’s safe, that the War is over, that her friends are alright. That the War is over. He keeps at it till her breathing calms, till she stops struggling. Tentatively he removes the hand from her mouth and she takes in two deep gulps of air with her eyes closed.
“This can’t—” Draco tries, gesturing between them. “You can’t—”
He can barely think under the onslaught of Draco’s teasing yet relentless ministrations but eventually comes up with a breathless ‘Auror.’
A traitorous part of Draco rejoices. He crushes it like the venomous bug it is.
“A branch of the main family got a little tired of the Dark Arts that the main branch kept dabbling in and settled here. Pretty enough to be regal, small enough to be secluded. Simple enough for the Malfoys to reign like wealthy lords.”
“Michelangelo, right?” Potter asks. “Florence?”
Malfoy men have dragon heartstrings. Clenching his jaw, he pulls the white cover away from he ornate mirror in the living room. Before looking at himself, he focuses on the woodwork around the frame, draws in a deep breath and closes his eyes. When he opens them again, he thinks he has uncovered a portrait instead of a mirror. A portrait of some ancient ancestor who only thought to get himself painted when he was far too old and dying. But when he raises his hand, the figure in the frame raises its hand and Draco realises with dawning horror that he is in fact looking in a mirror, at himself.
Harry doesn’t say anything, but his eyes are squeezed shut, and his lower lip is sucked into his mouth.
Potter’s curls are swaying with every gust of wind and Draco notices that his hair is noticeably longer down his back than it appears from the front. He should probably think about tying it back if it gets any longer, he thinks abstractly.
He traces the edge of the tablecloth.
Potter nods in acknowledgement. Granger gets up. “I’ll get us some tea, sit down and when I’m back, we’ll go over the outlines.”
“What reason?” Harry asks and pulls Draco down for a kiss.
“I’m adding another one,” he says.
He has the upper hand of knowledge, so when he wraps his fingers around the leaking head of his dick and rubs himself fast and hard, he knows to be silent, he knows to sink his teeth into the pillow, into the meat of his palm instead of letting the sounds escape. It’s one thing to listen to Harry wank. It’s quite another to make Harry listen to him doing the same to the soundtrack of Harry’s pleasure.
His vision is turning dark around the edges, and the room is spinning until he can’t make sense of anything except the lightning-shaped crack in the plaster on the wall, it’s jagged edges cutting into his brain, until all he can see is lightning scars and lightning spells, dancing in blue and green and red before his eyes.
“Did something happen? I knew I should have gone with you, I just thought you’d do better if I wasn’t there what with your male ego and all–”
After he’s done bathing (which he decides was one of Draco’s better ideas because he feels much better) and gets under the covers of the freshly made bed, Draco who’s been hovering to ensure Harry doesn’t pass out or hit his head against something says, “I’m going to go downstairs for a bit. Do you mind?”
He lets Draco have his way, lifts his hips when he reaches over to pull the trousers off completely. He’s wearing only his briefs and though he’s still coming back up from the spectacular orgasm he had given himself with his mouth on Draco’s dick, hearing his name on Draco’s tongue over and over, his dick gives a half hearted little twitch at the feeling of Draco’s hand pressing down nervously on it.
It’s cold, and Harry is hauled into more than twelve shops to buy appropriate winter wear because apparently his coat and his jacket and his Transfiguration skills are not enough when it comes to Draco Malfoy’s posh tastes.
“Your advice is to help me process grief, not keep me from alcohol,” he says, tone mild. His fingers clench in the fabric of his pants. Her eyes drop to the gesture and dart away.
He nods, in acquiescence and Ginevra shakes her head rather adamantly. There’s perfect understanding clear in her eyes. “I’ve loved Harry, Draco. I know how easy it is.”
“I was wondering if I could talk to you for a minute?” He asks her.
There’s a crazed vulnerability in Draco’s eyes, as though he’s both determined to know and terrified of the answer he might receive; a stubbornness in his jaw that contrasts sharply with the silent, unspoken plea in the trembling of his lips.
He brushes his fingers over the strange oval shaped scar on Harry’s chest. Without saying anything, he leans down and brushes his lips against it. Even though Harry obviously saw it coming, he startles strangely.
Honestly, it will not be less than what he deserves.
“I have to clean up,” he says, not meeting Harry’s eyes.
Keeping his eyes closed, he envisions himself as he used to be, grips his wand and casts the spell, “Mutare Facies!” When he can bring himself to examine his appearance again, he thinks he resembles himself. Or who he used to be before. His cheeks have filled out, his eyes have brightened, his lips look plumper. But even as he looks at the face of the boy he used to be, something seems wrong. Something seems different, as though there’s a piece missing. If he wasn’t himself, he would have noticed nothing out of the ordinary but having spent the better part of his childhood in front of a mirror, he knows his own face and something isn’t right. But there’s only so much to be done. He fixes his hair and the collar of his robes, casts the charm again just to be sure. Then he takes a swig of Calming Draught, repeats Malfoy men have dragon heartstrings to himself over and over till the words lose meaning, takes a deep, fortifying breath and walks over towards the Floo.
In fact, in those odd, numb moments, he finds himself able to actually reflect on the conventional things people expect him to reflect on: what comes after? Where do I go? What happens to the people I leave behind?
Intense. Passionate. Toe-curling.
‘Tomorrow,’ says Draco, in a flat, low, dangerous voice.
He doesn’t know how long he sleeps but when he wakes up, there’s an arm thrown over his waist and a lean, warm body pressing into his back. Something in his chest hums contentedly, sounding an awful lot like a cheesy Celestina Warbeck song and for a split second, everything is perfect, everything is quiet. He revels in the peace, both outside and in the deepest recesses of his heart, peace that he hasn’t known in his life for longer than he cares to admit to anyone besides himself.
But Draco pulls him in again, his kisses all fire and marshmallow sweet lips and a hint of vodka underneath his tongue and Harry forgets all about inhibitions.
Harry’s answering smile is like a shooting star across the night sky.
“Harry’s having a crisis,” Ginny says with a shrug. “I’m just wondering if he needs something to help him through it.”
“He’s alright,” she says, but the smile she supplies to accompany the words is strained. “Throwing himself into work as always.”
But Harry’s memories of the Manor are tainted in grey and black, in Hermione’s screams and Voldemort’s cold smile and red eyes. Every time Harry thinks of the Manor, rain drowns his memory of it in a fevered deluge, falling in heavy sheets, obscuring all but the forbidding iron wrought gates that led to the gravel driveway.
“Are you even in charge?” Scorpius asks, annoyed. He’s met with an infuriating smile that seems to permeate the dark effortlessly.
Scorpius has taught himself to live with it.
With trembling legs, Draco raises himself off Harry’s cock with a wince and the wet squelching sound it makes when the ring of muscle finally pops free makes Draco cringe.
He thinks of refusing.
Usually, the direction of his thoughts seem to run in a hotter, heavier slide, towards more passionate activities, towards more touch and less gentleness. But this—
“I don’t want to talk about the babies right now,” he says, and his words are full of promise Draco knows all too well he’s good at keeping.
Harry’s mouth has turned to cotton. Ron speaks, “I didn’t want to.”
She nods and hiccups. “Ron tried to stop him. Ron tried to tell him that we weren’t going anywhere but he just kept shouting about how he was scared we were going to leave him. How he was terrified, how he was making an effort and it was draining him, how he just didn’t want any of this anymore. And he started saying things like I was all he had because Ron had left us in the Forest of Dean, left us and gone away and I was all he had left and how I would leave him too and he didn’t… he stopped making sense after that. And Ron, Ron just went all silent like he does when these things happen and I tried, I tried so hard to get them to calm down but I couldn’t, it was all, it was all out of order, all out of order…”
“Don’t deny it,” Harry says, because right now, he doesn’t think he can handle Draco’s affinity to cart his mistakes off on the shoulders of everyone but himself. Right now, he needs honesty. “Don’t deny what I saw and what I felt. I’m too much sometimes, I know. You don’t have to explain.”
He had stayed shut in for three months after the trials. Potter had spoken for him and though Draco hadn’t been surprised (bloke did owe him a life debt after all), he had not been brave enough to even dream that many individuals shared Potter’s perspective about his war crimes being a result of underage pressure. So he stayed in and aimed futile cleaning charms at the dining table when he could stand to be in the room, for three whole months. The dining table. The living room. The ballroom. The chandeliers. The portraits. The fireplace. He had exhausted himself by casting cleaning charms and brightening charms and none of them seemed to do much good. After three months, his inner Pansy had put her hands on her hips and said fuck it. He set the dining table on fire and watched as it burned.
Harry grins and stops picking at his olives.
“Drink the cocoa,” he tells her. “They’ll be alright. There’s a Healer with them.”
“I don’t know why I came here,” Draco says. “I don’t want to be here.”
He’s never been able to keep it.
“You still love him?”
Draco promises himself that when he wakes up, he will Pensieve this dream. Harry’s lips under his are warm and a little dry but the heat of their mouths moving together makes up for it. It’s smooth and Draco gasps a little when Harry teases his lower lip with the point of his tongue. Harry smiles against his mouth and Draco wonders how his imagination came up with something so wonderfully perfect.
Four. Five. Six.
“Why are you telling me these things?” A pleading note has crept into Potter’s voice.
of my concerns. At least Father has Firewhisky, why don’t I have Firewhisky?”
He’s looking up at Draco, frightened, as though he expects a slap to the face. Which is why he lets out a gasp when Draco only pulls him closer and kisses his forehead gently.
“Two sugars.”
Draco at seventeen deserves to be dead.
“Call me Harry,” Harry says, grinning. It will be gloriously strange, but he can’t wait.
He spears his duck with more force than strictly necessary and resolves to pack his bags and leave the next morning. Saving Malfoy from himself is not Harry’s job.
house which you’re cleaning and cooking and helping out in. Of course,
He doesn’t know who opened the curtains in his room, he makes sure to always keep them closed. It’s probably Hermione, Ron wouldn't bother.
“Why the actual fuck—”
‘I’ve got you where I want you,’ Draco says, and there’s an undercurrent in his words that makes Harry’s skin tingle.
He doesn’t want Granger to probe and as though reading his mind, she rolls her eyes and says, “You’re such an arse, Draco, I don’t know why I bother calling you my friend.”
Harry snorts. “Merlin, yes. It’s the war fucking with Ron’s head. Makes him think there’s no time for anything, that he needs to rush it, needs to fill out some checklist by the time he’s twenty-one. ‘Mione’s been trying to get through to him.”
“Why did they never heal, Harry?” He asks. He knows the answer, can deduce it from what he already knows but until Harry says it out loud, he won’t believe it. Can’t believe it.
He looks up at Draco, whose look of concentration has morphed into a look of open, blatant desire and Harry blushes under the scrutiny.
“No clue. Nothing I have of my dad’s indicates he knew about any family there. I don’t even know which state my family’s from,” he says. The curve of his mouth tilts downwards. It’s a little bitter, a little resigned, but his words are dry. “It’s all very murky and mysterious.”
“Draco, Draco, it’s alright, just take a deep breath, we don’t mind, we already knew, remember?”
“I agree with Ron for once, don’t even think about that—”
“The Aurors? Malfoy, what on earth are you talking about?”
Harry swats him upside the head but the tense atmosphere has eased considerably.
“Tell me about you,” Pansy eventually says, when she’s spoken long enough for her voice to go a little hoarse. Dessert arrives on delicate plates, and Draco watches Harry perk up a little. He digs into the treacle tart, licking icing sugar off his lips with a blissed-out look on his face and by the time Draco can steel himself enough to look away, Pansy’s picked up on the little exchange with a slowly growing smirk.
“Who cares?” Harry demands. “Who cares about the sides? Do you mean to tell me Voldemort was an angel? Paid you rent? Bellatrix never used up all the hot water—”
He doesn’t know where the words come from. He doesn’t know why he says them. He only knows that she doesn’t deserve this, doesn’t deserve what he’s done, what he’s helped Harry to do to her.
“But here—in Florence, if you were to make every place where an artist who is now world famous, where a creator who left the world a legacy set foot into a museum, the common folk wouldn’t be able to live anywhere. They’d be on the streets, but even the streets were walked by those people. Makes you think, doesn’t it?”
“Then I suggest you champion the cause of modernisation,” Draco had retorted, with a cool smile and a shrug of his shoulders. “Pardon me, Uncle Archie, but Malfoy funds are being deposited sparingly in businesses we trust to succeed. I cannot base my decisions on the past and fail to take the present into account, it would be improper.” And then, just to seal the deal, he’d added, “I’m certain Father would agree.”
“You should go,” he tells them. “Both of you. It would do you a world of good to just get away from here.”
He closes his eyes and enters the room and bangs the door shut behind him. Then he falls to the floor at that spot where they had been standing, at the spot where Draco had tracked ash into the room from the Floo. At the spot where they had been kissing and Harry had been certain that his dreams were coming true, finally.
“What you can learn is how to not trip on my feet while I lead. Now, if you don’t want to go to the Ball dateless, you will turn up in that Charms classroom beside the dungeons every single evening and spend at least an hour with me.”
“Don’t tell me you still get jealous when you’re drunk. The betrothal was seven years ago.”
“Dear Merlin, Potter, what are elves for—”
“I am hoping I might be more than just this by then,” Draco says, the honesty burning its way through his system. It’s a direction he has forced himself to take, even when his honed instincts scream at him to toss enough Galleons in the right direction and make all of this nasty stuff go away. He won’t be his father.
Draco had opened his eyes and met hers. He’d known it was answer enough.
He’s painfully hard in his pyjama bottoms and just to relieve the pressure of it, Draco slides his hand into his pants and presses the heel of it to the junction of his cock and his balls. His cock twitches, interested and alert against his warm palm and Draco has to bite his own frantic groan into the pillow which he hastily retrieves with one flailing hand.
A couple more letters back and forth and Hermione tells him Malfoy agreed to come by today. So Harry smiles, says, “That’s fantastic!” and pretends to not be losing his goddamn mind at the thought of facing Malfoy after the last time they saw each other.  Malfoy was a man looking like a ghost and to the best of his knowledge, Harry had been an elaborate hallucination. Today evening, Harry thinks with a sigh, will be absolutely fantastic.
“He ended it,” he says, and his words are rushed, fast. “He ended it, he left, he chose you. I’m nothing, I swear, he made it clear, he chose you. I was just a fling, just a stupid decision after too many drinks, it wasn’t real anyway, don’t worry, he ended it, he ended, he ended it, he left–“
“Harry?” Hermione asks again. “Didn’t you want him to?”
“If only fourteen-year-old Draco knew that before he made all those badges.”
“Are they…” Death begins, and breaks off. Scorpius looks up, wondering if it’s hesitancy or second thought, only for Death to look generally perplexed across his changing appearances, as though grasping for words that aren’t there. “Are they…” they begin again, “intimate with
“You know why I am here,” she tells him. It isn’t a question. He ought to know.
But for Harry and Draco, that sort of schedule doesn’t work. There’s no routine. That would require the couple (the couple!) to be in sync. The last time Scorpius can remember them having been in sync was three years ago, when they had their last fight in the kitchen, throwing well timed barbs at each other, baring their teeth and saying exactly the things they knew to be shards of a poisoned dagger slicing through each other’s hearts.
one of the trio to receive that level of honour given the fact that Potter has a well aimed disarming spell to his name and Weasley is… well, Weasley.
He has to pull himself together.
Except it’s not, and Sirius Black is sitting across from him– how could he have ever thought
Harry’s missing Voldemort. The smile that he knows is twisting his lips has no joy behind it.
“It’s me. It’s Draco. You’re at 12, Grimmauld Place, the War is over. It is 5th December, 1998, the War is over. You’re safe in your home, you’re safe, the War is over. It is over, you’re safe, you’re alright.”
“A man,” Granger snorts. “If you can call Voldemort a man, then yes, he killed a man.”
Harry Potter’s
Malfoy strides forward, purposeful and poised, feet striking the marble heel first. It makes a soft thudding sound that Harry focuses on to keep himself steady.
In another couple of minutes, his ankles are bound to handles at the foot of the bed that Draco must have conjured because Harry’s fairly sure they weren’t there before. He’s spread eagled and vulnerable on the bed with barely any capability to move.
“Not quite,” comes the response. “Just something that confuses me too.”
He hears noises to his right and then Potter’s indignant voice carries out, “What?!”
“Have you tried?” She is infuriatingly adamant.
When they land, he doesn’t know how to feel. Impressed by her nerve, bewildered by her willingness to disappear with him pretty much in public, indignant because she did bring him somewhere completely unknown or terrified for his- frankly worthless- life. He settles on a stony glare, hoping it conveys all of those emotions, crosses his arms and waits.
Scorpius heaves a sigh. He had known it would be difficult, but this is simultaneously harder and easier than he had expected. On one hand, he doesn’t have to placate distraught, disbelieving parents who seem to be in denial. On the other, every bit of Scorpius’ soul aches with the vulnerability in Draco’s mouth and Harry’s clenched jaw.
Malfoy looks startled, then angry for a second and then resigned. His eyes on Harry are steady, the grey of them unbearable.
He’s manhandled into the chair in the middle of the courtroom and the Wizengamot jury’s eyes are focused on him as one. Harry doesn’t have to wonder at how it must feel—the shock and terror and sheer overwhelming too-muchness of it. But oh, Malfoy.
Draco shudders and his cock thickens in Harry’s hand.
That’s when Harry notices. The more worked up Malfoy gets, the more the Glamour stabilises. In fact, at this point had he not been able to sense its presence being in such close proximity, he would say it wasn’t there. His magic seems to be… feeding off his nervousness, his excitement.
They belong here.
Scorpius isn’t alive anymore, but in dreams, he smiles– Harry’s little boy, his sweet child– like he never acquired that Wasting Curse from ‘genetic predisposition’ and Harry can touch him and kiss him and lull him to sleep without keeping one eye open for atrophy cramps.
Draco stares at Kingsley.
“Muggle,” Malfoy snorts. “Renaissance fresco artist. You see this place—it should have been a museum. This is where Michelangelo apprenticed. And yet—” He shrugs again, shoulders tight. “And yet it’s just any old house now.”
How dare you—”
“Sometimes you’re right,” he says, trailing a finger along the glass. “Sometimes, I wish you weren’t.”
Down the long, ugly Sectumsempra scar, there are hickeys lined up, red bruises and purpling skin and it is so unbelievably hot that his cock grows impossibly harder. Harry feels the change and gives an amused hum against the skin of his hipbone before pinching it with his teeth and gently nipping, causing Draco to almost arch straight off the bed at the assault of conflicting pleasure and pain on his nerves.
“You have a half empty bottle of Calming Draught in your pocket and I saw you take a drink from it like it is your favourite bottle of Ogden’s Old.”
“At this stage it’s more brainstorming than it is setting anything in stone. My vote is to write down anything that comes to anyone’s mind, regardless of whether it is an outline for the steps we will take or details of the proposal. Just, everything anyone comes up with, put it down somewhere. We can figure out where to go with it once we actually have some material.”
“Want to go see the Lake from the Dungeons?”
Hermione relaxes. Harry stares up at the darkened ceiling.
“I’ve been here almost every night since we came back to Hogwarts this year,” Potter confides eventually. “It’s quiet.”
“Waiting?” Scorpius asks, sinking down onto the familiar bed. “
Harry makes Draco feel like an unstable firework shaking and quivering. An explosive Draco is an unpredictable Draco. Dangerous. But falling apart? Draco has done that a thousand and one times and if there’s anything he knows, deep and certain, it is how to fall apart with a smile and a wink.
Harry nods. “I wouldn’t call the second time surviving. I died. I went to something in the… after. But I could come back.”
Ginny shrugs and goes back to her peas.
Potter’s face in the dirt-streaked mirror of a secluded bathroom. Potter outside his Azkaban cell. Potter forcing the guards to undo his restraints after the full pardon. Potter leaving him wrecked more times than he cares to count in myriad hotel rooms in myriad states of undress and debauchery.
“Merlin damn it, you’re a stubborn arsehole—”
Harry knows something is wrong.
No pressure. Draco can breathe.
But Harry can’t bring himself to talk anymore. He can’t bring himself to answer Hermione’s anxious questions or meet Ron’s concerned glances. He can’t listen to Teddy’s innocent babbling or endure Molly’s strange, vacant stare.
They laugh. There’s no malice in it. “Do you recall what I said about names?”
It screams money, but not the gaudy kind, the quiet kind that is made under tables and behind closed doors, the kind that hides in gilt-edged frames of ancestors and is used to pay off wands and mouths alike to do dirty bidding.
“Breathe in for me, Hermione,” he murmurs, voice even and soft. “One, two, three, that’s good, breathe out. Again, one, two three, breathe out…”
“Harry Potter isn’t keeping me busy—” Draco sputters and Harry wants to correct him, wants to point out that the week they spent, doing nothing but necking in their beds and occasionally emerging to eat, is keeping busy but Draco didn’t even tell Parkinson he was here. Of all the things Draco wants Parkinson to know, this one cannot be on the list.
“Fine.”
“Please,” Scorpius begs the hooded figure standing before him.
This almost feels like reality.
“You’re not getting out that easy,” whispers the roughened voice he’s accustomed to by now, barked orders and spewed insults blurring into each other as the overwhelming grey of his cell threatens to breach the carefully constructed barriers of his mind. “There’s more you need to suffer for.”
They’re laughing. “Shut up, Potter,” Draco says, and Harry doesn’t want to. “Dolohov probably washed your dishes, Greyback, oh Greyback, did he go hunting, put food on the table—”
“I spoke to a Healer after the War and she said I had something called PTSD. I didn’t go to her again so I never found out how to deal with it or even what it was. I just… went coasting and hoped it would be fine.” He hesitates before saying, “Maybe sometimes even hoping I would be anything but fine.” Draco’s hand tightens in his, whether in solidarity or empathy, he doesn’t yet know. Perhaps both. “I went again after what happened here. Luna asked me to. The man I went to said it was PTSD as well. Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, they call it. Almost everyone has it after that damned War, but mine manifests as the sort of extreme violence you saw the other day. I have triggers that I don’t even know about because of my… childhood. Something about repressed memories. And I still need to figure out who I am outside of Voldemort. Outside of the boy who killed him twice and fought him too many times to count and disarmed him in a battle. I need to be Harry and I can’t deal with expectations.”
It’s a long time before anyone speaks. It’s Harry who breaks the silence eventually. “Do you want me– want us to call anyone, love? To talk? We can let them know… before.”
“Brilliant,” Weasley says, kissing her on the cheek and smiling. Harry high-fives her and Draco after a moment’s hesitation hugs her tightly.
Focuses his gaze on the photograph above the mantle. It appears to be of the Weasley family. Guilt threatens to overwhelm him again.
He follows her out into the living room where Potter and Weasley are talking to each other in quiet undertones. It stops when they enter and Weasley stretches with a sigh. “As fun as it was meeting you again, Malfoy, I’d prefer not being here longer than I have to be. Even if I do believe you aren’t here to cause trouble. So I’m going to take this tea upstairs and go through some of the files from the shop I brought home with me.” He kisses Granger on the cheek and tells Potter, “Keep an eye on him, mate,” in response to which Granger utters a low, “Ron, behave.”
So Draco does.
Harry breathes like a broken dream, all shattered edges as he devastates Draco with the push and pull of his whole being and Draco clings to him, the tidal surge of want crashing over them like an ocean.
“Come for a drink with me.”
He knows it would be a waste to leave Ron anything. It would never be touched, only cried over. He knows better than to try and leave Hugo anything– he doesn’t want Draco to hate him even more in death by trying to take over his godson. Ginny probably wouldn’t even get the owl letting her know of what she’s inherited, and even if she did, she wouldn’t know what to do with it in the Amazon rainforests.
Contrary to what Draco had feared would happen, they don’t immediately strip each other and proceed to bang it out. He knows he wants to go further, but he isn’t sure he’s quite
Harry’s moving before he registers it, darting out to catch Draco’s wrist this time, his other arm curving around Draco’s slim waist until the other man is standing pressed against him, face etched into an expression of confused surprise as he stares down the three extra inches he has on Harry.
Draco won Selwyn the case. He was sent out into the Wizarding World and given the status of a free man.
After his treatment, he was lying exhausted and depleted on the narrow hospital bed, understanding with slow dawning horror that his Ravenclaw curiosity to understand what its like to live through a war– a real war!– was about to be met in the only way it could be at an unprecedented time of peace in the Wizarding World. That’s when she’s walked in again. Both Harry and Draco were asleep on either side of him, Draco’s monitoring charms still beeping faintly and Harry’s wand clutched in his loose grasp. Even in sleep they looked protective, ready to wake up and fight whatever demons were besieging Scorpius’ rest.
As for the armchairs– only Scorpius and his fathers know with certainty the strategy behind the way they have been stationed in the room– one close enough for his hair to be caressed, the other for his hand to be held.
It is the last thing Scorpius hears before he gives into the tug of dreamless sleep beckoning him closer to an eternity of it.
“I have something to ask you,” Harry tells him, when they’re back at the hotel room, lying side by side on the upturned duvet.
“If you’re still talking, I clearly have a long way to go,” Harry responds and before Draco can really process it, he’s the one flat on his back with Harry straddling his waist, intently facing him.
“Your voice. Birds. Voices. I can’t hear–”
“I’m always right,” Draco informs Blaise, waving the whisky in his general direction. “And I never wanted to
“What exactly are you saying?”
If this is what Harry wants, this is what Harry will get.
“You had sex in graveyards? Plural?!”
Harry buries his face in his hands. He looks up only when he feels a light touch on his shoulder and finds himself staring into concerned and slightly amused grey eyes.
Harry comes back up. “Hey,” he whispers. There’s a small smile on his face. “If you’re having second thoughts, we can do this later.”
“No,” he says, reigning himself in. “No,” he says louder, noticing with mounting panic that Gianni is spiralling. “No, no, I’m sorry, I’m so very sorry. Here,” he says, holding up the glass of water in Gianni’s face. “Here, thank you, I am drinking.”
“Maybe six hours?” Hermione ventures with a slight shrug.
Granger looks as though she doesn’t believe him and his heart clenches because there are reasons he can’t bring himself to call her… anything else. Reasons he doesn’t think he can intimate to Granger anytime soon. The way the Carrows laughed about the ‘Weaslette’, telling him how he ought never touch her with his bare hands lest his blood become tainted from contact. The discovery of what his father had done to her and how when Draco had confronted him, he’d merely said, she’s dispensable. He can’t tell her about those things, not yet, possibly not ever. He can’t explain how calling her Ginevra is his way of paying respect to her.
‘Never thought to tell you,’ Harry shrugs. ‘Old Black property. Only time I went there was when I was looking through all the property left to me in my inheritance and trying to weed out all the dark curses and jinxes.’
She smacks him upside the head immediately. “Attendance is compulsory, you pillock.”
Harry ignores him.
“For the war? For six years of bullying? For the Manor and the Fiendfyre and the other fucked up shite–” He pauses at Granger’s expression. She isn’t looking surprised or amused or happy but instead rather blank.
“A good bond then?” she asks instead. Her dark eyes are oddly perceptive while being almost guileless. It’s a little unnerving, looking into them. “Between you and your son? Open?
Draco’s certain Pansy notices more than she lets on from the other side of the table, but he isn’t about to confront that knowledge. This thing between him and Harry is fragile, a baby bird learning to fly, and up until he’s certain of its strength, Draco wants to shelter it with everything he has.
Harry slumps, exhausted on Draco’s chest and stays there for a while, unmoving, a breathing weight on Draco’s chest that is oddly comforting.
Draco has a mad urge to find Harry’s Muggles, hex them into oblivion, make them remember again and then slowly, torturously, kill them until their remains were unworthy of even being scavenged. He says as much and Harry shakes his head with a slight laugh. It’s strained but genuine.
Scorpius does not answer. Instead he watches Harry pull out his cup from the top shelf and after a moment’s thought, Draco’s too. Side by side, they look innocuous, a couple’s morning coffee, a touch of love, a dash of everyday romance.
“I… I don’t know what to say,” Hermione starts. “He didn’t look any of those things when he was here. He was attentive when we were talking and he had inputs occasionally and I…” she stops here. “He did have a panic attack at the beginning but I thought that was just common PTSD and anxiety. But it’s probably more extensive than we understand.”
On Wednesday, he thought that maybe he needed more time to himself and couldn’t face Draco just yet but when he misses Friday as well, Draco knows Harry is avoiding him purposefully. Slightly hurt and not entirely sure what to do about it, he firecalls Hermione and asks if Harry is in. She says no loudly but nods her head yes to indicate that Harry can hear the question and doesn’t want her to tell Draco.
He shivers a little at the cold whisper of the words echoing through his body and turns over in his bed. Sitting up, he blinks.
Draco feels the beginnings of horror creeping in. He had expected a somewhat inebriated Harry but this, this sounds like someone who has only been drinking for three days straight. He knocks again.
house where you’ve kindly let us stay.” Her anger isn’t misplaced but Harry wants to set the kitchen on fire at the unfairness of her words. When he doesn’t say anything, she shakes her head and says, “Honestly, Harry, that’s a low blow.”
There’s that word again. Granger uses it all the time, says she has it herself. Says the panic attacks are symptoms of it, extreme symptoms. He won’t deny it, her help has been invaluable in dealing with the damn spiralling in public. Breathing, focusing, concentrating on the senses.
“He said he’d think about being the Master of Death when the time came to die for the last time,” Scorpius recalls, thinking back to when Skeeter had published her piece with insurmountable proof and comments from ‘reputed resources’. Head Auror Proudfoot had asked Harry Potter to issue a formal statement regarding the claims to keep the rumours from spiralling out of control. That means…
Draco’s answering blush is probably more revealing than Draco himself would have liked for it to be.
“Oh?”
He’s startled into a laugh. “Indeed.”
Harry can feel the heat rise. ‘I wanted to try something, once. About three years ago. I bought it from a shop that… sold those kinds of things and I brought it here. I thought I’d bring you here too but then it just, um, never happened.’
After a few more moments of Harry’s fingers stroking the insides of Draco’s arse, he hits something that sends sparks up his spine and he gasps loudly, startled.
She turns. Waits. She’s probably a Slytherin. Maybe a Ravenclaw. Too composed to be anything else. If she cuts her hair right, she could be mistaken for Pansy Parkinson in the streets. He’ll never admit it, but that’s one of the reasons he hadn’t shown her out sooner.
So even when he hates Malfoy, a little part of him grudgingly admits that perhaps his presence that day had been necessary, perhaps the outburst in the kitchen had set Harry’s life to rights. And for that, he has to thank Malfoy. Even if the thanks in this case may only be delivered as an apology. So today when Hermione looked at him expectantly, he nodded and she looked so pleased that before leaving, he had kissed her fondly on the cheek. It isn’t often one finds a friend whose expectations you meet and exceed with gestures as simple as… apologising. Even if it is to Malfoy, for everything Hermione and Ron have done for Harry for the past seven years of his life, it is an insignificant price to pay.
“How dare you bring up Umbridge in my bedroom, how dare you—”
“Draco’s gay,” Parkinson blurts, suddenly, and all three of them freeze. Draco stares wide-eyed and mortified at the back of her head, Harry stares incredulous and confused at her rapidly reddening face. “I just—” she rushes to clarify, “I just know how it looked when he came out all dishevelled.”
It’s selfish, it might even be a little cruel–
They’re just Harry and Draco, on a sidewalk in Florence, shaking hands and smiling, a little hesitantly, a little euphorically, at each other.
“Ithoughtyoudidntwanttoseeme.”
But one cannot have everything one wants.
Harry whispers a Vanishing spell and the constricting sensation of the trousers around Draco’s knees disappears. He immediately spreads them wider. With another flick of Harry’s fingers, Draco’s boxers disappear and Draco is naked and vulnerable under Harry’s sharp gaze.
The pressure eases. When Draco’s eyes focus on his surroundings again, he sees Harry hovering by the bed, rage and guilt chasing each other across his features.
Draco says nothing, merely tilts his head in curious expectation.
“I know,” Granger says, almost jubilantly. “I know he isn’t better and that’s okay. That’s okay because he’s talking to me!
There was also the matter with his own mind, the struggle he’d been on the verge of losing that whispers constantly, even now, that he doesn’t deserve a shorter sentence or a gentler one, but he isn’t about to admit that to his self-righteous barrister whose condescending blinking drives Draco to teeth-grinding frustration.
—The Prisoner, Emily Brontë
He has beautiful fingers, Blaise. Long and elegant with nails filed to precision framed by manicured cuticles– fingers of a man who has never had to lift even one of them to get what he wants. No, Blaise gets what he wants through charming smiles and being at the right place at the right time and inserting himself into conversations where he doesn’t belong with practiced ease.
“Draco,” says the woman, deceptively patient. “No matter what you think, I really don’t have all day.”
“When we went on the run, it was just Ron, Hermione and me in a tent. I got used to falling asleep to just two sets of breaths. When I wake up in the dorm, if I have a silencing charm on, I hear nothing and I panic because I think they’re gone. If I don’t have a silencing charm on, I hear all those other breaths and I panic because I think it could be anyone,” Potter says. His voice is soft, almost soothing. It’s lost its sandpaper quality and Draco can only hope that’s because he’s talking more.
He misses Severus. Not in the way he did just after his death with a fierce aching in his heart and denial raging in his head but instead with the quiet nostalgia that comes with understanding sacrifice. He has watched Weasley suffer the death of his brother and yet he goes through every day with stoic calm that anchors everyone who encounters it. Hermione’s parents are somewhere in Australia and though she misses them, talks about them with a sad smile as though they are dead, she refuses to find them. The memory reversal might be too much for their brains, she claims but sometimes Draco wonders if she is only avoiding explanations. No parent would ever understand why their child erased all their memories, made them different people and sent them off to live somewhere unknown, far away from where they could ensure the safety of their child. For all that it is worth, Hermione’s parents have ceased to exist.
He moves towards them, hesitant and unsure. It seems unlikely that they can see him, given their lack of reaction, but he doesn’t know how they would react to his touch. Whether it would be some phantom cold sensation churning their stomachs like the touch of Hogwarts ghosts. Whether his hand would pass right through them. But even as he reaches out, and very gently and delicately strokes his father’s week old beard, Draco doesn’t react.
Potter pauses again. He seems hesitant.
He means it when he says that there is no place for shame in the life of a Potter-Malfoy scion– if he’d been able to remember the slightest hints of buried love that folded itself in overshadowed by the looming demon of pride, he’d have pushed his fathers with bald comments towards each other. Set them up on blind dates, locked them in a room together, that sort of thing. And if those didn’t work, he’d have sat them down and told them plain as day that they should at least talk.
“She was a habit,” he says. “A good one.”
There are dreams, there are wild dreams and then there is reality.
“Yes.”
“Just wait,” Harry pants.
Potter looks angry.
Harry doesn’t know if he wants to scream, cry or throw himself off the Astronomy Tower.
Rome is magnificence unparallelled. San Gimignano had been a watercolour painting, all soft edges and smiling people, pretty street corners and trellised windows. Florence had been a sculpture, lifelike and gorgeous, artistic and fascinating.
“Oh.”
Draco doesn’t seem inclined to ask Harry to leave, now that Parkinson’s here. Harry would be relieved by that, but he also doesn’t seem inclined to ask Parkinson to leave, and so when the matter of where to spend the night arises, both Parkinson and Draco begin to look alarmed.
Harry flushes. Hermione giggles and pats him on the head before murmuring, “One day, Harry, I have hope you’ll grow up.”
He scowls playfully at her and says, “Who’s cooking today?”
Potter’s eyes widen comically behind his lenses. He opens and shuts his mouth a few times like a particularly inept yet attractive goldfish before hissing, “Excuse me?”
for me.”
“Okay,” Draco says, leaning over to press a softly sweet kiss to his cheek. It’s vulnerability leaches through Harry’s fogged over and lust hazy brain and he smiles, a little drunk and more than a little ecstatic.
“I was. I could have, I could have gone to Dumbledore, maybe even to you but if I had done that… I would be disowned. And during the War, all I had left when all my beliefs were shattered, everything had gone to hell, was my name. And I didn’t want to lose it.”
Nothing.
“You’re planning on becoming more in your Italian villa, Malfoy?”
When their eyes meet, Scorpius shoots her a wan smile he doesn’t expect her to return. Behind the apology in her eyes, there’s a familiar frustration, one Scorpius knows intimately. He feels an uncomfortable solidarity with her anguish over the utter inability to fix the situation like she does everything else– the sheer desperation of watching what had once been beautiful collapse in on itself.
Granger is exhausted but sleepless, sitting by Weasley’s head, stroking his hair. His cuts have been healed and salve applied to the bruises on his side and arms. He hasn’t woken up since Healer Choudhury left but she assured them that this was natural sleep and he would wake up, hopefully fresh and stable the next morning.
The only person he bothered to tell was his mother, when she was lying in bed, some ‘mystery illness’ a flinty eyed Healer had told him that was wrecking her body. He’d told her in the quiet calm of twilight descending in Wiltshire, the windows darkening with every passing moment. The confession had twisted like a knife, but it had set him free from the haunting secrecy he forced himself to maintain.
“So you have family here?” Potter asks, wonder and mild alarm seeping into his tone. Draco snorts.
Draco has been asked countless times to divorce Harry. Draco has also been asked countless times by countless people why he does
“Another,” Draco demands when the burn of the first finger fades. This time Harry isn’t quite as gentle, moving faster, letting the lube and the slight stretch do half his work for him. His poisoning fingers brush against Draco’s prostate and when Draco bites into the pillow with a howl, Harry repeats the motion enough times for the pillow to be permanently pockmarked with the evidence of his agonised ecstasy.
It has been going much the same way for the last half an hour. Kingsley has presented the budgetary requirements and the legal changes to be made while Hermione has expounded on the necessity of the project. Most of the heads are nodding along in deep appreciation while a few remain obviously sceptical. Draco is sure that they will get a two-thirds majority when one old witch in plum robes with a silver S.P. embroidered on, asks in the ensuing silence of Hermione’s closing statement, “But what about Draco Malfoy?”
That makes it sound worse than it really is—admittedly, vaguely cannibalistic and definitely violent—but Harry really, really wants to taste the sharp jut of Malfoy’s collarbone, run his hands down Malfoy’s side, grope his arse a little, slide his palms up the jut of his scapulas.
Harry feels the abrupt need to glare. “Stop looking at me like that,” he hisses. “Like I’m some specimen in a—in a gay history zoo!”
This kiss fulfils some of the promises, eventually evolving into a line of hot, open-mouthed kisses being pressed down the column of Harry’s bared throat and as he closes his eyes and revels in the warm, wet heat of Draco’s mouth teasing at the sensitive skin, Parkinson’s arrival seems like a godsend.
“You didn’t deserve it,” she says. Her voice doesn’t waver, but it’s different from the one he’s accustomed to hearing from her when they brush hostile shoulders in the corridors. The sound of wind chimes and forest fires has been replaced by an intensity—dark and bloodthirsty and angry.
On Christmas Eve, when the streets are bedecked with Christmas ornaments and lights, the tree in the Square an attraction to which the children of the neighbourhood flock to, Harry presses his nose against the cold glass, holding Draco’s hand.
He had put his head in his hands for a few minutes before shaking his head and looking back at her. “What are you going to do if he turns it down?”
“I remember you sitting around in Harry’s chair and scaring the living shit out of me.” He looks away and bites down a bitter smile. “Or whatever was left of it anyway.”
‘You know you can tell me anything, right, Harry?’
The cold awaits.
He nods. She moves to leave, standing by the fireplace, a pinch of powder in her hand. He looks down at the carpet and adds, almost as an afterthought, “Ms. Richards?”
“Oh—er. Yes, yes of course,” he stutters, trying to coalesce his winding thoughts into spoken English. He sounds a little stupid but figures Malfoy is accustomed to it. Probably expects it. He doesn’t feel quite as unbalanced when he mentally adjusts to the status quo.
But for better or worse, he remains quiet—unmoving and pliable as the rough guards lock his feet and his arms into the straps on the chair.
“Where is she?” he asks, instead. Pansy Parkinson was not charged with anything, given that she was not Marked and an abrupt, panicked attempt to hand the Chosen One over to the Dark side did not a valid charge make, especially when the Chosen One handed himself over eventually.
“Okay,” he breathes out. “Okay.”
They meet outside the courtroom, Hermione clutching the papers to her chest, her hair flying around and an excited gleam in her eyes. She sees them and breaks into a sprint while Kingsley follows at a more sedate pace.
to slot his body against Harry’s and let himself drift into a mind-numbing, toe-curling kiss that the part of Draco on high alert drifts into the haziness enveloping the rest of his consciousness.
He wears grey robes, freshly laundered and pressed out. He feels better in them, more confident. He looks in the mirror and while he is still gaunt from months of eating far too little and sleeping only under the influence of Draught, he has filled out enough with his exposure to the trio to forego the Glamour.
She talks about her friends– Longbottom and Ginevra, Lovegood and Patil, Brown
Harry sees the edges of Malfoy’s Glamour flickering.
and as
“Shall we enter?” Malfoy asks, turning towards him so suddenly that Harry jumps. Set against the backdrop of the ivy and the pale pillars, he looks less human and more artwork, a watercolour painting of old money and the weight of a name. An artist’s canvas, Harry thinks, experimented on with the shades of dappled summer sunlight and royalty.
Harry had been his friend and maybe he is paying the price for wanting him to be more.
This villa is the opposite. The sun shines down on the limestone carvings above the arched windows, glinting off the regal white exterior of the building. Ivy twines its way around the girth of magnificently carved pillars that lead to an ornate doorway which seems to indicate the act of gaining entry to be more stately an affair than Harry has ever considered it to be.
He blinks once more, and the undefinable face of what he called Death is back, swirling and indeterminate.
He smushes his face into his pillow and groans, furious and more than a little hurt. It’s been almost two months of their functional relationship, and the fact that Malfoy has chosen now to be a brat feels a little like deception to Harry.
“Then pray tell how it is.”
“I am here to testify to what Draco Malfoy is,” Potter begins and Draco hears the distinct terms he’s using grate against the fragile flutters of his ill-advised hope.
“That’s a good boy,” Hermione grins.
He raises the sleeve of his robes to reveal an expanse of plain skin. It takes Harry a moment to register that it is his left arm where he should have the Dark Mark. He doesn’t. Instead, he seems to be intently focusing on it with the tip of his wand pressed to it and suddenly, the skin trembles and the black lines of the mark rise to the surface, the gruesome symbol becoming prominent.
They share a melancholy look of mirrored sadness and keep talking till dawn arrives with its new light and chirping birds in the garden at the back. Then they fall onto the repaired couch and with a satisfied sigh, look at the fixed furniture, the restored picture frames, the repaired mantel and fall asleep side by side, Draco feeling lighter than he has in what seems to be an eternity.
He looks away.
Draco had been feeding Scorpius chocolate pudding while telling him a story from work (most of those weren’t child friendly, but the ones that were, endlessly entertained Scorpius who would often ask a couple days later about what happened to Daedalus Diggory after he filed a case against a goose), and Scorpius’ eyes had been sparkling so bright that Harry had known this was a moment he needed to keep preserved forever.
Draco arches to meet Harry’s motions, too far gone in the rush of pleasure to give half a fuck about the words and sounds spilling from his mouth. He could be proclaiming Harry the Queen and he wouldn’t know, he could be spilling every last dirty secret and he wouldn’t know.
“Pardon me,” Blaise had snarked unapologetically, “I wanted to spare you some dignity. If it makes you feel better, married men do not leave their wives for the gay lover either, Draco. They have some sort of existential sexuality crisis, realise life is better with the white picket fence and 2.5 kids and the stable job and lack of scandal and send a brief apologetic letter to end the affair on a Tuesday morning.”
“Okay,” Harry breathes out, shakily. “Okay.”
Behind closed doors, there were no words exchanged, no explanations provided. What used to be a happy and carefree space created by two men in love for their little family quickly became a dilapidated ruin of memories and faint echoes of laughter.
On Fridays and Wednesdays, Harry turns up at the Manor, usually with a lunchbox packed by Ron who has taken to cooking enough food for four. Malfoy opens the door everyday, sometimes immediately and sometimes ten minutes after Harry has knocked and announced his presence several times by shouting, conjuring flying birds and then simply sitting down and waiting.
Harry lets him touch, lets him feel, and Draco is saved by the elegant bridge of Harry’s nose and the cliff’s edge of his cheekbones.
“You should schedule a meeting with him or something. Figure out where he stands,” he tells her.
to is unpleasantly chilling.
Draco’s drowning.
“You can’t just tell me I’m not allowed to—”
Harry’s jaw clenches. He looks away and runs his fingers through his hair. “Not anymore,” he says. “She isn’t my girlfriend anymore.”
“Deal,” he says, and wonders how he’s supposed to pretend for a year that Potter’s smiles don’t set him on fire.
During the next week Harry spends his afternoons at his desk, hesitating before every swish of his wand that sends some files flying into a pile marked, ‘To be delegated’. There’s another, significantly smaller pile that says, ‘For the Head Auror’ and only case files that are top priority, national security or high risk are in it alongside all communication with the Minister.
“We’re going to pretend you didn’t say that while I have divorce papers in my hand. I am going to leave them on your sofa for now, and we’re going to go to the kitchen and I am going to make you eggs, and you will complain about how I make them runnier than you like them. Then, I will come back, ignore the divorce papers on your sofa while we fuck in your bedroom, and in the evening you will take me somewhere to have dinner. And when we come back here, I will put those divorce papers on your coffee table, possibly have a breakdown, which you will hold me through and then I will sign them. And then we’ll fuck again.”
She looks so excited at the prospect of Potter even talking to her that Draco’s spirits lift. He’s as sincere as he could possibly ever be when he tells her, “I’m glad to hear it, Granger.”
“I didn’t,” Draco says, because when there’s nothing else to say, the truth works just fine. “He should have left me in the fire.”
He stops short at those words and through the fog in his sleep-heavy brain, the panic is the first thing that permeates.
So when Harry finds Draco on the couch by the fireplace, the book’s pages crumpling against his chest, he takes a minute to just take in the sight of him– peaceful and calm in his sleep, a rare sight these days.
“Pans,” Draco pleads. “Pans, it’s been a bloody week—”
, and desperation does not make a good bedfellow of love.
It’s only a moment’s weakness, though.
“Greyback, he…” he takes a deep breath before continuing, “He wanted me.”
Draco shrugs. “I’m not dead yet.”
It’s the closest Scorpius has seen them willingly be in three years.
“Or?”
He doesn’t want to be alone but he has absolutely no one to turn to right now. Hermione shouldn’t have to deal with his guilt over his own faults that had led to Dumbledore’s death. His friends… the full weight of their absence comes crashing down on him.
Harry’s hands tighten on his shoulder.
Potter. Or don’t because that’s what’s gotten him here in the first place, but seriously,
Draco is so surprised that he doesn’t know how to react.
By the time they make it to the bed, they’re so tangled up in each other that Harry can’t tell where he begins and Draco ends. He knows that his lips are kiss-swollen and heavy, he knows that his soul has been set on fire, he knows that Draco’s mouth is far too skilled for life to be fair.
Draco has never been so horrified.
The day Harry haltingly tells him about his Muggle relatives, Draco asks, voice harsh and words cutting, why, precisely, Harry doesn’t agree with Draco’s established notion that Muggles are filthy dogs. Which leads to a disappointed glare from Harry who reminds him that Hermione’s parents, who gifted him books and vouchers are also Muggle, and that his grandparents had been Muggles and the receptionist who gave them a discount on the price of their room is also a Muggle.
‘You have a cabin I didn’t know about?’ Draco asks, incredulous.
Draco sighs. Of course.
The pounding on the door gets louder with every passing second, and when stuffing his head under the pillow to block it out does not help, Draco’s resolve breaks.
Granger frowns before her expression clears. “No, I mean yes, but they are a separate department. They’re set up in Hogsmeade. And they don’t really care who you are.”
but he feels giddy with it, almost delirious with joy and agony and ecstasy and heartbreak.
And it hurts, it aches, but they’re surging towards each other, mouths meeting, lips seeking out the familiar crevices and dips to trace, mouths parting, breaths mingling.
Potter says nothing and they remain there, with Potter on his knees and Draco holding his wrist.
“I spoke at your trial, Malfoy. If I wanted you in Azkaban, I’d have let them take you.”
“I don’t know,” Harry says. He cringes when his voice comes out scratchy and hoarse, rough around the consonants, breaking on the low sounds of the vowels. “It happens.”
He wants to touch Harry, bury his fingers into the curling hair resting against his navel, tickling him ever so slightly, but Harry asked him to keep his hands out of the way, so he keeps them itching and uneasy, tucked under his head. It doesn’t stop him from arching into the sensation of Harry’s mouth and the wonderful, delicious suction it provides and Harry eventually has to hold his hips down with both hands.
“I’m not a Black,” Draco says, circling the rim of his glass with the tip of his finger. “But my mother kept with the Black tradition of naming me after the skies. Ironically enough, she was one of the few Black children for whom the tradition wasn’t maintained. Quite bit younger than both Bellatrix and Andromeda, you see, and both of them were holy terrors by the time they were twelve and ten, so my grandparents thought it best to go with something safer. It’s the Pureblood way– attributing your children’s faults to everything except yourself. They thought it was a problem with the stars.
The word is a shuddering bird in this courtroom of hostile predators, cracked down the middle and dead before it hits the ground. The word is a broken remnant of what Draco’s words were once, haughty and accented and sharp to a fault.
It ought to be familiar territory, Draco thinks. Potter has always looked at him when he’s least wanted to be seen. Memories of Sixth Year flash unpleasantly through his mind and the scar that still tingles, pulses with life down his chest. But the War has changed them all and Potter’s gaze holds something different now, something Draco can’t place.
Night progresses, and they sleep.
He whispers, “I didn’t think you wanted to hear me right now.”
“Of course,” he says, and backs away from the doorway. Scorpius shuts his eyes, and when he opens them, the door is closing, Draco’s pale hand disappearing into darkness.
The scent of woodsmoke and pine lingers in the air.
“Hey,” he says, trying to sit up. It’s alarming to find that impossible. It’s not that he can’t feel his body (the Healers had said that it might manifest as a symptom as the Curse progressed), but he can feel quite acutely just how weak it is. He knows how much strength it will require to push himself up. he knows he doesn’t have it. “I have something to say to you.”
“It would be rather hypocritical,” he confesses.
She shoots him a curious look, shrugs and leaves.
“Compassion,” Harry interrupts. “That’s what Voldemort didn’t have. He had everything else. Devotion, loyalty, hell—
Scorpius smiles, a rueful glimmer of upturned lips and bashfulness. “The very same,” he says with a shrug.
She hadn’t responded immediately, but after a brief pause she’d said, “Hey Draco, want to get coffee?”
‘Are you seeing someone else?’
Loud, unbridled shrieking, the sound followed by the splintering of glass on marble. He follows the noises upstairs, pausing in shock before what appears to be Harry’s room. Granger is sitting on the floor in front of the room, head in her hands, inhuman sounds coming from her throat. Weasley is standing in the middle of the room, looking completely blank, murmuring unintelligible words and Harry…
“If you’d rather not, it’s completely–”
Potter stops, and the courtroom is silent. Nobody had known what to expect of Potter’s testimony, but no stretch of the imagination seemed to have prepared anyone, including Draco, for
He won’t succumb.
“Yes.”
Had they looked away from each other when caught staring across the table? Had Harry fiddled with his ring? Had Draco aborted an attempt to reach for Harry when he’d seen the dead look in Harry’s eyes?
“A Muggle-born?” Harry asks. He’s never really known the Blood Status of the other house members, but he knows at least one of Justin’s parents is Muggle. From the way Malfoy is grimacing at his pizza, he’s right. “I thought he was gay.”
They had discussed it at length after Draco had gotten over his shock. It had been a pleasant if somewhat stilted discussion, given that they had skirted the War and Voldemort and Potter right up until…
“Will you be wanting this back?” Draco asks. “Or should I store it in the vaults?”
“There’s no one else, Draco.”
At this, Draco cracks a smile. He raises a hand and pushes it into Scorpius’ hair. It’s one of the things the Curse hasn’t taken– his hair. Like father, like son, he thinks wryly, immensely thankful for this one small exemption the Curse seems to have made. He doesn’t mind dying as much as he probably should, but he minds dying ugly far more than one in his position ought to. The Curse has wrecked a body that used to be muscled from Quidditch, but at least his face still remains acceptable, framed by the characteristic Malfoy blonde hair. Draco pretends to despair over the curly, untameable quality it seems to possess, but it’s often put upon– a little exaggerated. Scorpius knows that his hair, or the ruffled, messy nest it often transforms into, is a part of Harry that Draco can caress without having to examine feelings, animosity and a failed marriage up close.
Lovegood walks away, and Draco wonders what to do with his newfound knowledge that Harry hasn’t been mentally present in his relationship with Ginevra. With the knowledge that Ginevra has noticed, and that she is hurting, and that though some part of Draco, a small and evil part appreciates this turn of events, most of him aches for her.
“No,” Draco shakes his head. ‘It’s just a scar.”
The hope sheds it’s own petals.
There’s a straw held to his lips and he raises his head slightly to get a better angle at it. Cool, fresh water washes his mouth and the relief he feels almost makes up for the truly unbearable headache.
“This is why I saved you,” he says. “Spoke for you. Came with you.”
Malfoy looks away, an uncomfortable blush rising high on his cheekbones. “I leave tomorrow, Potter,” he says. “I don’t want any trouble before that. I’ll pay for your things and we’ll be on our way.” He swallows and repeats, “I don’t want any trouble.”
“There could only have been one explanation for fluffy blankets turning up in the middle of the night with D.L.M stamped into the corners.”
Hermione keeps staring so Harry says quietly, “He looked like he hadn’t eaten anything in a month. And he’s been taking Calming Draughts too often, he finishes a third of a bottle per day, ‘Mione, per day.”
Draco rolls his shoulders in his sleep. Scorpius’ hand itches for his wand. He longs to conjure a blanket to drape it over Draco, or perfect the chair so he’s more comfortable. Expressions of love aren’t frequently uttered between Scorpius and Draco, but every morning Scorpius wakes up to drapes charmed to filter in the exact amount of light he finds comfortable, and a modified Muffliato to keep all the sounds of the spells hissing around him soft and soothing. This magic, intricate and precise is as complex and intuitive as the fine arts, and definitely not Harry’s forte.
“The blood curse remained, he was always weak. Died pretty early too. But the Healers at the time thought early would be a couple years at most. He lived to be thirty six. Had about five ankle biters before he passed on too. No curses on any of them. All of them grew up to be perfectly dishonourable Wizengamot members who helped pass the House Elves Breeding Bill of 1852.”
He comes to this conclusion when he finds himself mentally cataloguing a difficult Arithmancy problem for his next conversation with her and finds himself, shockingly, looking forward to the prospect of it.
little aspect of his life, but somehow he can’t restrain it as it rises and spills out of him in an uncontrollable rush of twisted, broken emotions.
She frowns. There’s a smear of chocolate sauce or what appears to be chocolate sauce on her cheek. She swipes at it absently. “They aren’t staring at you because they would like to eat you alive or whatever it is. Maybe Ron is. No, I’m sure Ron is, just to mess with you a bit. But Harry, Harry is probably staring because he can sense the Glamour charm.”
“Slow down, Malfoy, you’ll dive headfirst into another attack.”
Some of the frowns are turning considering and Draco’s amazement skyrockets. When he looks back at Potter, the green gaze as unbearable and alluring as staring into the sun strikes Draco in the face.
She shakes her head. “It’s a known fact, of course, but the reasoning is understood to be tradition.”
“If this isn’t a good time,” she says, frustratingly calm, “then you can Floo me when you think it is. I will be, as you well know,
“Can you believe she told me she knows what it must be like to be married to a celebrity?” he had asked Harry, with his arms around Harry’s bare waist as bacon sizzled in the pan. “Just because she’s trying to divorce Anthony Filibuster doesn’t mean everyone is!”
“You don’t even like me!” Draco feels the need to point out. “You hate me, we—we hate each other, it’s a thing. And now what, you want to go backpacking across the continent with me—?”
“They’re quite alike, you know?” Harry says, latching onto the last topic of conversation he’d have thought possible in any degree of civility with Malfoy of all people. “They’d do anything for us. My mother died to keep me safe from Voldemort. Your mother lied to his face.”
After that, Harry and Hermione had bounced around a couple ideas, which appliances to introduce to Purebloods, which parts of Diagon Alley to take Muggleborns to at first.
“Malfoy,” he says instead. “Missing your mother isn’t reason enough to bring up that word. Or rail at your elves.”
“I didn’t ask—”
Most of the time, he’d answered himself in the affirmative.
“Tosser.”
“Do you want to?”
The term PTSD isn’t foreign to Harry but he has forgotten what it means. When he asks Hermione, she smiles sadly and says, “Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, Harry. The Mungo’s Mind Healer said you had it, remember?”
Potter nods again. His expression is blank, the soft lights in the library reflecting off the glass of his spectacles.
It’s bloody
“I’ve been alright,” he responds, unsure how he’s expected to meet her eyes.
He knows Harry might be lying, that Harry probably is lying. He’s always late on Tuesdays, and most of the time Draco doesn’t bother asking, preferring undressing to wordplay. But today, it feels important to acknowledge that he has noticed, that some part of him might even have missed Harry in the moments that he wasn’t here. After all, every delay is precious time lost.
He keeps his eyes on Potter’s face as his shaking hand unclenches and comes up to touch the smooth wood he has not felt against his palms in what feels like decades. The Unicorn hair core thrums with magic and the sweat on his palms dries up, as though the wand has taken that decision for him.
It’s just as well that everyone has maintained a considerable distance, choosing to leave Draco to his own devices. Merlin knows what he would have done if someone had made an attempt at either confrontation or conversation (neither of which Draco knows he can avoid forever) because anytime he even contemplates opening his mouth to speak, his tongue seems to shrivel in on itself.
Draco’d been sick to the back teeth of it. To hell and below with traditional fucking Wizarding Society.
Best wishes, Hermione.
“What now?” He asks, instead.
Draco wants to get up. Wants to fight and rage and slam Harry back against a wall and fuck him until all thoughts of Ginevra are obliterated from Harry’s mind. Draco wants to do quite a lot of things, he realises, lying upon the bed, watching tears spring to Harry’s eyes, but he doesn’t have the willpower or the energy to go through with any of them.
“Recently.”
“New recruits bothering you again?” Draco asks. Harry had complained and complained about it the last time they’d met, dark mutterings about the incompetence of the children and their arrogant attitudes. “They think they’re Aurors and just because they know the law they can break it,” he’d murmured into Draco’s collarbone and Draco pressed his fingers into Harry’s knotted shoulders. “They think they rule the world.”
“I heard you right?”
“I don’t know,” Malfoy breathes, looking at him. “I have no idea. But I think—” He hesitates. “I think I might like to find out.”
“It’s difficult,” she’d admitted after a reluctant pause. “So fuc– very difficult not to.”
Potter raises his beer mug and an eyebrow. “A year isn’t a trifle, Malfoy. You can’t just wander off beyond the border without a plan and blink at the sun.”
“That’s all you’re going to say?” Draco asks, almost indignant.
The woman—Anita Cosgrove—stands up and clears her throat. It’s rather obvious she isn’t entirely sure what to say. Not for lack of confidence or competence—Dench had buried his face in his hands when he’d heard she would be representing the Ministry—but because countering Harry Potter has become exponentially more daunting ever since the Order of Merlin, First Class has been added beside his name.
“Over drinks,” he says in an odd, high voice.
“Seems a little… inappropriate, doesn’t it? For a son so young to be bold enough to suggest such a relationship?” she asks.
“You know I am not at liberty to discuss, Hermione. If he wishes to tell you in time, he will.”
“He’s preparing to die for the last time, with no chances of coming back.”
“If you, if you have any intention of bringing harm to the House of Malfoy, to me, it, it shouldn’t let you in. It, it isn’t like other Malfoy curses or hexes. It’s simple… just a little charm to keep out unwelcome intruders.” He drags his gaze up and down, his eyes almost blank but with something flickering underneath, “Which I would have thought the Manor would think you are.” He pauses for a minute and gets a faraway look in his eye. “Unless my magic’s failing. Do you think my magic’s failing?”
There used to be a time when he wouldn’t have thought twice before looking up at Harry beseechingly, pulling on his fingers to convince him to give him a back rub. Harry would feign annoyance, and Scorpius would giggle at Draco’s pout. Then Harry would give in, smiling soppily, and Draco would sigh in relief and Scorpius would watch in astonishment at how bloody happy his fathers seemed to become just by being near each other.
But in none of his fantasies did Draco react like this after.
come back. Not in the ways that actually matter.
His over sensitised channel clenches and undulates against Harry’s brutal thrusts and within moments of his own orgasm, Harry’s chasing his own high with a guttural cry and a particularly sharp thrust that he can’t sustain, sending him shuddering and shaking straight into Draco’s arms.
“Tell me,” Draco says—pleads—and Harry can’t hold back.
A century, he’d said? A fucking
But Harry’s already shaking his head, the wistful expression on his face growing more entrenched by the second.
The vaults were a loose end.
“One beer,” Harry says. “I might be seventeen but it takes more than that to get me drunk, Malfoy. This wasn’t some drunk impulse.”
“Father,” he says, tilting up the edge of it in a question. “Come closer?”
Harry picks it up, slides it on and abruptly walks away, leaving Draco standing in the kitchen, newspaper forgotten and face pale.
They go to Rome in November.
“I found you unconscious in a room.”
Harry realises after an uncomfortable pause that both Draco and Parkinson are staring at him, twin expressions of uncertainty on their faces.
There’s a contemplative hum. Followed by a thoughtful, “Yes. You might just be.”
Harry’s eyes brighten and his expression goes from disappointed to surprised to ridiculously pleased as the light drifts into his eyes indicating he’s figured it out.
“You’re really not inspiring a lot of faith here—”
“Are we dating?” Harry asks at the diner, sandwich halfway to his mouth. Draco pauses, straw heavy on his tongue as he sips at the Coke Harry had insisted on buying. He doesn’t really know how to answer.
She talks about Ginny Weasley with a sort of hidden longing and when she catches Draco staring, admits to having been in love with her for years but never doing anything about it because she belonged with Harry. And perhaps she senses his pain at those words because the next thing he knows, he is talking about how he doesn’t understand it too well but there is something about Harry that draws Draco to him like a moth to a flame. How he had stopped wanting anything after the War but Harry had whirled his way into his life and made him desire all over again. How he is afraid that Harry’s friendship had just been residual guilt or fear or whatever drove him to this madness today. How he hasn’t been this happy since third year and all just because Hermione Granger and Harry Potter decided to make a routine for him and Ron Weasley decided to cook him lunch on Wednesdays and Fridays. How he is terrified he will lose all of it after today.
