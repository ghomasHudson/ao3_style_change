“As a child I used to wonder what was wrong with me. Why couldn’t he love me? Why wasn’t I enough? I just wanted him to see me for who I was.”
Harry clenched his hands along with his eyes. “I feel like I have to find him. Not just because I’m supposed to, not because of Lucius, not because it’s the right thing to do. But because
Painting-Malfoy looked to be already in pain, eyes on Harry but resigned, as if he was still giving up.
. I didn’t think it was possible to love something so strongly like this. Not until Harry came along and not until you were imagined. The knowledge that I will be a parent has shifted my whole world.”
“You have less than a half-hour before the snake venom begins to fight your own venom. I’d love to see which one would prevail, but unfortunately, you’ll be dead before then.”
“What?” Harry looked up, jumping a little at the intensity in her eyes. “I can’t afford to lose bits of myself in the process of finding him. I have to remain objective.”
“You know,” Ron began, lips twitching in a way that only meant trouble. “This could be another silver lining.”
It was all spiraling. Draco felt like he was having an existential crisis. His entire life the smell of people drew him in, some more than others. Potter’s scent was strong in the same way his magic was. Everything about Potter’s smell drew him in, from the soothing after-scent to the powerful aroma. He
“All of you shut up!” Harry paced back and forth in front of them. “We all know I’m good at coming up with plans.”
“I’m going to help you too,” Harry continued, clearing his throat. Talking had helped a bit, he felt lighter than he had before. “If I can’t find bring you home, then at the very least, I’m going to find some answers. Which means more journal entries.” He lifted the book with a shake of his hands.
When Malfoy waved a hand, and Harry felt a cleaning charm wash over him, he performed his own, only targeting his mouth. He may like sucking dick, but not the taste of come.
things about them that he shouldn’t. All it took was a glance or two, a moment of their time and he could discern far more than typically possible.
Potter closed his eyes when his nipples were lightly pinched. “I’d tease you a different time. One where I’d take my time, leave you wanting and aching for something, anything.”
Painting-Malfoy flipped him off before turning his back on Harry. Some goodbye. With one last look around the room, Harry left, shutting the door softly behind him.
He slumped down with a loud enough groan that Madam Picket glared at him. He had thought Madam Pince had been bad, but she had nothing on their magi-university librarian.
“Lion Valley is in need of potions for their troops, while Raven Hill is seeking rations,” Draco said with a huff. “Both offer a hefty payment in return should I side with them. Choosing one will make me enemies of the other, and I am loath to do so.”
Merlin, Harry loved Ron. He’d forever be grateful that Ron couldn’t find a seat anywhere else all those years ago on the train.
“Oh?” It was mumbled against Draco’s neck as one of Potter’s hands tilted his head to the side. “Is that another thing you fantasize about? My arse?”
“I became a writer because I wanted to educate people. No matter what I did as an Auror, there were still ignorant criminals committing crimes and using baseless excuses as their morals—
“Oh,” Malfoy whispered softly, almost too soft, as if it was just a breath of air. And for just a moment, Malfoy returned the hug with just as much force.
A whoosh preceded a stifling silence, one Harry regretted causing. With the office being an enclosed space, it amplified the smell of burning wood. He couldn’t tell if it was because of the fireplace or if that was what Ashwood always smelt like. It wasn’t the worst smell he’d come across, but it wasn’t exactly pleasant either.
“You reminded me a lot of my cousin, well, sort of. If he had been a wizard, he’d have fit right in with the rest of those who think like Malfoy used to.”
As Harry began his patrol, he noticed that most patients were asleep. Which was odd considering the time. It wasn’t until he stopped in front of the first inmate awake that it made sense.
The man pointed an accusatory finger at him. “Like that! People act like I’ve done something wrong.”
Sense of duty became warped the longer Lucius was a Death Eater. The longer it went on the more it took out of him.
Because his decision had already been made. The one to walk away. He just hoped Harry would understand.
“I would just like to point out before you do anything rash, is that all pyramids have seals on them. That’s the whole point of my job. I break curses, seals, barriers and anything else.”
Now that her confidence was fading and more fear began to seep outward, Harry closed his eyes and let himself go.
It was getting too close to home for Harry. He’d rather talk about Seamus’ issues than think about his own.
The open-mouthed kisses continued onward to each cheek and when Harry sucked a mark into his skin, he couldn’t withhold the moan if he tried.
“But,” Malfoy continued, ignoring Ron completely. “If everyone there is stolen from, there is no obvious target. No one will know that Astoria was our main mission.”
looked at him as if he was something amazing, something to behold, something special. It was nice to know that Malfoy didn’t see it that way. Even if it was just a jab amongst friends.
Potter looked at the door, and then back down at Draco before he took a deep breath and extended his hand, helping pull him up.
When Harry met Lucius outside of Malfoy’s flat, it became real. He was really doing it, really going to look for Draco Malfoy: pretentious git extraordinaire.
it, relished in their anguish, enjoyed watching their last moments slip by. Voldemort killed people because he
the kind of person that would taint the Black name, and don’t get me started on the werewolf either.”
Draco picked up the painting by the frame and set it against an unused chair to make room for the dishes that would be brought out.
Time worked against him as the more frustrated he seemed, the quicker the day passed. He ignored the questions or concerns of the other teachers, with his early class having been cancelled due to a flood, he had the rest of the day off, and he wanted to be productive.
Harry’s eyes opened when he could hear distant feet coming closer. The Mark had enough soul that he knew it would have to come out eventually. He frowned when the Mark didn’t
There was a softness to Kennedy’s eyes and he wasn’t sure he deserved that, he was only doing what he felt was right.
“Touched a nerve,” Harry coughed as he sat up on the floor, eyes watching every step Draco took toward him.
“The statement does, however, interfere with the court’s laws,” Ragnuk said, and several Goblins nodded with him. “Why change what has been written since the founding of our community?”
“No.” Harry took a step back as he shook his head. “I don’t want any part of this. It didn’t work, you tried, let’s forget it.”
Harry let out a low whistle as he eyed Pashkov who seemed proud. “White Shark. The same White Shark that abuses the inmates. That White Shark?”
“And why is that?” Malfoy wrapped his fingers around Harry’s wrist as his thumb rubbed circles on Harry’s skin. “Why is it so easy for you when no one else ever has?”
But no matter how much pain he had gone through, he couldn’t look at Nott hurting and call it justification. It went against every fibre of his being.
“After the first disappearance, I went to the vault it was placed in, but it was gone. Only the Goblins and I knew where it was.”
Malfoy sat up suddenly, so sudden that he grabbed his head and let out a groan. He truly was a lightweight.
Harry walked down the hall taking stock of the dead. Some prisoners hadn’t reacted to the destruction at all, those ones were lost causes. Most of them wouldn’t be worth the meal, but a soul was a soul.
“What title?” George was worried that Fred was going to go into shock and he debated about stunning him to stop from ranting.
“There’s no getting someone out once activated,” Harry said as he reached for one of Hold’s hands that were now struggling. “Unless, you switch who’s in it.”
Harry’s eyes stung at the realization that his parents had worn them. They were a piece of his parents. He put one of them on immediately, wishing it could have been his dad that did it.
“I love the way he throws a fist in the air when he gets an answer on the telly right. I love his stupid hair that has to be sentient at this point, never lying flat. I love the softness in his eyes when he’s happy, the way they shine so brightly. Almost as bright as his smile. I love how kind he is. I know I give him shit for that, which I should, but there’s a goodness to him that isn’t common anymore, and I love that. I love how much he cares about other people.
“Malfoy, I empathize with you,” Harry raised his hands in the air when Malfoy’s hands curled around the wand. “But
“That’s not going to happen.” Not with Hemlock as the chairman. “The rest of them are so far up Hemlock’s arse.”
The knowledge of Life Magic being required in Alchemy had always made him uncomfortable. Necromancy? Not for him but he could understand it. Soul Bonds? Scary if done wrong but the benefits were appealing. Life Magic? No.
“Not quite, but your arse is beautiful too.” The words were punctuated by hand kneading his arse cheeks and Draco knew it was his turn for the impatience to rise.
“Says you.” Harry crossed his arms. “Who gets to decide that? Who says some of these prophecies weren’t made by barmy people madder than a loon? What makes a prophecy true?”
Ambarella stood up, signalling her right to the floor. “Being with a Vampire as a Werewolf is not wrong.”
Harry sighed as he looked at Colin in what he hoped was a polite way, and not the frustration that had quickly mounted at the sight of him.
As the warm fire lulled him into a light sleep, Draco’s mind also reminded him that just being with Harry was pretty wonderful too.
That, he didn’t like. If it was a two-way thing, then what was it Draco saw? Were there flashes of his emotions too? Past things or just the present?
As he set aside the Pensieve, the contents of the box became clear and he was a little disappointed to only see one vial and a letter. He had thought that there would be more, maybe random things like the contents of Sirius’ lockbox or clues,
When Draco didn’t say anything, Harry lifted his hands, letting all but one soul escape. “Do you want to see for yourself?”
Kingsley slumped in his chair, head tilted back towards the ceiling. “We were 16 and it lasted a month, if that.”
When he knocked on the door, he expected a house-elf to answer. Seemed typical for pureblood families. What he hadn’t expected was to come face to face with Parkinson, who’s friendly smile vanished at the sight of him.
Scorpius tended to say it often enough to merit notice but not enough to become too grating. Minerva watched Scorpius make a small number of friends within his own house but none that would do him well. After the public rejection from Elizabeth, she knew that more issues would be on the horizon.
Wizard robes. Objectively they weren’t bad, might even look good on Draco, but Harry wasn’t Draco and Lucius needed to give up.
Draco’s breath caught, and it was so easy to imagine, too easy. “And if I was good and waited, then what?”
That had been the hardest part. Losing Ron had hurt more than any breakup he’d ever had. No one ever talks about the pain of losing a friend. How losing a best friend could crush him in unexpected ways.
Draco looked up and locked eyes with the painting still on the floor only now he noticed the crack in the frame and the paint that began to corrode from too much residual magic in the air. The paint would melt off the portrait and his work would have been wasted.
“I don’t bring good headlines, I don’t bring good conversations, I don’t bring good energy and I surely don’t bring good company.”
by our bodies. We are the ones dependent on souls, not the other way around. A soul can survive without a body. And I say they flourish without one.”
His breath caught when Harry’s wings spread out to their full extent. He wanted to bury his fingers in the feathers and feel the softness against his skin.
“Ambarella,” Draco said politely as he walked by her seat. There was amusement on her face, and he wondered how much she knew.
“Exploding Snap first? Or alcohol?” Ron asked, a deck of cards in one hand and Firewhisky in the other.
“You’re right,” Harry said slowly, and his words had her wand lowering a few inches. “She should be here. And the ones responsible deserve to be punished, but that’s not Malfoy. Hurting him doesn’t make up for the injustice. All it does is cause the cycle to continue.”
By the way Potter’s eyes remained fixated on the holster, Draco assumed Potter had an interesting kink, one he’d like to explore another time.
it wasn’t the best time to start a conversation, but if he hadn’t then who knows how long it would have taken him for the next one. Courage was fickle and when it came to Malfoy; Harry had little to none.
What? The Weird Sisters were having a reunion? He hadn’t ever realized they broke up. And they would do it for Nott? Harry had always known there was a reason he didn’t like them.
He wanted that, wanted what Malfoy would give him. So he moved his fingers at an achingly slow pace.
“I want you to view your grief as an outsider would. I want you to see what your grief has done to your magic.”
“You could have played along,” Malfoy frowned, and it was endearing. “Maybe my fantasies are of us meeting after years of no contact to have passionate sex and never see each other again.”
The muffled moan Harry released in response was good, almost too good. It did nothing to quench the greedy nature that Harry inspired.
But as Draco got older, he realized that love just wasn’t for everyone. People tend to be selfish, unforgiving and usually not compatible with others. At first, he figured that the problem was them. Perhaps he wasn’t meeting the right people. But each breakup took a piece of Draco with him, and he never was able to figure out how to get it back. Is there a way to tell an ex to keep their clothes, material possessions, and happy memories if he could just take back the small shattered bit of his heart? That was it, that’s all he wanted. The piece of who he had once been with them.
Indecision was so transparent the longer he looked at her and it was almost amusing. He was considering doing it himself but before he could, she pulled out her wand and a standard department paper memo flew out of the tip and zoomed out of the room.
Mina looked around the room before lowering her voice. “The Animatio Court does not fight with the same stakes, nor with bravery.”
A noise left Malfoy, not quite a moan or groan, but a jumbled mess of the two. It was a sound he wanted to hear again, and again and
“It’s going to feel weird,” Draco warned. “Don’t panic otherwise the energy might not all exit, and you
If Draco’s emotions weren’t a mess he would have responded with a mature insult compared to the immaturity that Harry clearly possessed, but his heart had skipped a beat, and then another as he stared at Harry.
His mother nodded once, eyes on her entwined fingers. “Since Regulus died and the titles went to Sirius, and that was
Harry closed one eye as he thought back to their meeting in the park. They had talked about non-wielders back then, but he never thought that Draco would have taken anything he said to heart, at least not at that time.
Harry’s eyes closed at the memory of his first time being so close to so many souls. It was dangerous in how enticing they were. If the Dementors had let him, he’d have spent years with the souls—sucking in each one until he discovered the memories and siphoned the emotions out of them.
“I believe I owe you a private dance,” Malfoy said, coming even closer. The softness from earlier hadn’t returned, but he was a lot calmer.
“I don’t have the same half-built morality that you do,” Harry yelled at Dumbledore. “You take the moral high ground now but where was your righteous morality when we were shafted, enslaved and forced into hiding? Where was your fucking morality then?
Harry was intrigued and he wanted to know more but he couldn’t concentrate with each press of lips against his skin.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” Fleur asked, accent coming through the more worked up she became. “We could have helped you, so you did not become burdened under the pressure.”
“On second thought,” he grinned at Harry, fangs poking through and eyes brighter than they were before. “I love being in management.”
“If you must stay where you are unwanted then you are held responsible,” Nott said through gritted teeth. “The rest, however, do not belong here.”
“Why isn’t Draco here?” Ron asked, suspicion all over his face. “He’s the one who can actually plan something.”
“Illegal, yes I know,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. “I think we’ve established by now that I’m not the best morally.”
“Hold your tongue!” Ron bellowed as he moved towards the fireplace and settled next to Blaise. “This is a time-honoured event and you’d be lucky to be invited.”
It took Harry a minute to realize exactly what that meant, had to rely on the memories he had glimpsed through souls.
It wasn’t until Draco moved his hands along the edge of the bed that a shift in the air had him pausing. His eyes opened before they narrowed, and he leaned forward. As far as his eyes were aware, there was nothing there, nothing to cause a shift at all.
“And Madam Pomfrey fixed it,” Sirius smiled widely, far wider than necessary as if he was attempting to show
“Five-year punishment,” Draco shrugged. “Their reasoning never made sense to me, but I think they just wanted to make me feel like less of a wizard than I did at that time.”
“You called your wife!” Malfoy hissed as he took a step back towards Neville, Dean and Seamus who had moved up.
Wizards,” Harry pointed out, not bothering to look up. “They’re going to one day turn into adults who all benefit from the suffering of Magical Creatures. None of them will lift a finger to help us, none of them will do a damn thing!”
Malfoy sighed as he did every time Harry refused to call him by his first name. But Harry wasn’t going to give in. To give in meant that there was nothing left between them, to give in meant that Harry would have given every piece of himself, and that wasn’t something he could do. There
Harry was a few shots away from being drunk when he heard the news, and it was honestly for the better.
The urge to shrug again was strong but Harry chose to be predictable and instead said, “Don’t worry about it.”
“Why do you think so?” Harry didn’t like the sound of that at all. His home wasn’t something to discover, to gawk at or visit. Their home was the only sanctuary they had; the Ministry had seen to that.
“Is that stupid?” Harry asked, not really wanting an answer. “Is it stupid of me to want to keep trying?”
“If I do this, Voldemort will have nothing tying him here. If I do this, everyone back there can take him. If I do this, there’s a shot at him actually dying.”
That had Harry peering down, and sure enough Draco’s hand was wet. He wasn’t sure if that was a bad thing or not.
“Not the first time I’ve heard that,” Draco mumbled. He quickly locked the doors, lowered his curtains, and closed up the shop. Propriety was something he prided himself on, but that went out the window as he ran up the stairs leading to the flat over his shop.
“Damnit,” he whispered when the rune vanished under the weight of the magical weather. He pulled out his wand and cast a shield, with added concentration, he was able to transfer the shield to his non-dominant hand and hold up the shield with wandless magic. With his wand, he infused a makeshift rune into the shield in the hope that he could combine a protection charm and a rune to dispel the weather.
The sound of whizzing air had him looking up to see Potter falling calmly and with a finesse that Draco certainly didn’t have on his fall. Bastard.
“I don’t know.” He could feel Harry staring, knew the concern would double if he let Harry in, but he couldn’t.
Draco’s eyes closed when the Werewolf requested a hearing that would decide if she had the right to appeal the council’s decision. It would get her nothing but pain.
The panting was just as good as the moans and he wanted to see how many other sounds he could get out of him. “There, more, I need it.”
“He didn’t want me as his replacement,” Ron shrugged as he pulled out a bunch of folders. “But I had the best closure rate, the credentials and the test scores over anyone else.”
Sirius pulled Lupin into a tight hug and kissed the top of his head. “Alright, let’s take the photo so you have something to remember me by.”
Small hands wrapped around Draco from behind and he tried to reach around and pat Teddy on the head, but it didn’t work well. The small giggle Teddy released warmed him and made him feel immensely better.
Potter’s eyes moved over his face and Draco hoped his cheeks weren’t as flushed as he felt. It wasn’t fair how lightheaded Potter could make him.
that the museum let it go for the night. I am to accompany it wherever it goes. Seems you are the one that wouldn’t know anything about being reputable.”
When Harry stepped into the doorway, he took in the destroyed room; the chair was knocked over, bookshelves smashed to the ground, books torn and haphazardly thrown around.
“But you don’t.” Draco closed his eyes and his shoulders shook. “I just—It’s not—I’m sorry.” He pulled out enough Galleons to cover both of their drinks and turned to leave.
Harry tugged on Draco’s hand, smiling at the confusion on Draco’s face as he turned around. Harry didn’t waste time as he pulled Draco closer, snogging him soundly.
was the office the only room that was tidy? It was so meticulously spotless that it reminded him of Aunt Petunia. The floor was pristine, the shelves were straight, the books weren’t half-hazardously thrown around, and the desk was neat.
“That would have been great to know before I said anything.” It came out muffled as his lips were pressed against the sleeve of his robes, but he was long past caring.
Harry was smiling far too wide when their lips pressed together, it wasn’t an ideal kiss but when he felt Draco’s smile against his own lips, he knew that it was the best kiss he could have.
When Potter narrowed his eyes, Draco lifted his hands in a challenge. If Potter wanted him to believe in Divination, then he would need something stronger than Muggle cards and salt.
Before Harry could say something, Draco whipped around, wand pulled out from his holster as a spell shot out.
“Choose your words carefully,” Sirius said, “I don’t think your house can withstand more of his anger.”
Draco’s eyes opened immediately at the sound and a breathy sigh left him when the lockbox opened. The box was filled with mostly folded parchment, a few photos, spare ink, galleons and then little things that he couldn’t decipher.
The familiar scoff that never failed to make Draco’s shoulders tense was heard, but he refused to look to the corner it came from. Refused to give any satisfaction.
Ron stood up when a team of people apparated into the room. They all wore uniforms that matched St. Mungo’s. Harry had heard of emergency apparations, but never witnessed any.
He lifted the mattress but there was nothing there. When Draco tried to place the mattress straight, it wouldn’t budge.
Moody was so strange. Something off that Harry still couldn’t put his finger on. He watched Moody grow restless, legs shifting, cane slipping, Magical eye moving around the hall as if scoping for others or maybe an escape.
“That,” mumbled Draco as Harry felt one final brush of cold dye was applied to his hair. “Is it, now we wait.”
“There was no evidence!” Sirius yelled. “Peter cut his damn finger off and disappeared. There was no body left behind, as if I could do that kind of damage. I didn’t even get a bloody trial!”
Potter regarded him with an intensity Draco wasn’t used to outside of his father. An intensity that he had never seen in Potter before. He kind of liked it. Wondered what else was hiding behind a dark gaze.
“You’d say no solely based on me having a condition? That’s discrimination, one I’m sure Human Resources would love to hear about.”
“I—” He could tell Lucius that he was at a dead-end, that there was no one left to talk to, no one left to go to, but that sounded like defeat. Harry didn’t want to do that.
Draco grabbed Harry’s wrist and held it up to his nose. He couldn’t smell anything other than the soap Harry stole from him. His fangs nicked the skin and the first hint of blood had him groaning. The groan turned into a loud moan when Harry pressed inside him.
Draco’s light laughter was Harry’s favourite sound to hear. It was elegant, beautiful and held meaning, which was all embodiments of Draco to begin with.
“I don’t mean to be harsh. I just worry about you. Every time you fail it’s like another piece of you has disappeared and I hate seeing it. I just want you to be happy.”
The way back to his department was a blur, all he could focus on was the way Malfoy had smelled. It had lingered and he could have sworn he could still smell it. He had thought the disgusting scents of his coworkers would have wilted his erection, but no—that was as prominent as ever.
“If you ring that one more time, I will burn whatever you are looking for.” Malfoy’s voice was distant.
It didn’t matter if Webb had a bigger clientele, Draco was secure enough in his own abilities that he knew who the better person was, even if society would never see it.
“You’ll have to elaborate,” Draco said as he moved his hand slowly, carefully outlining where each delicate strand of blond hair would go for the next step of his painting. “There are plenty of things that you don’t know about.”
Malfoy Manor was just as ugly as it was last time. Harry knocked on the door wishing he didn’t have to be there.
“Yes.” Harry agreed with his own smirk forming. “They are.” He sighed heavily, head falling for a moment. “Hermione is going to be an issue though.”
The longer he sat there, the more it was hard to grasp everything. It came down to three facts: 1.) Malfoy smelled amazing. 2.) The smell alone caused boners. 3.) Harry was so fucked.
Malfoy looked around the room and Harry stiffened. It wasn’t much. The desks weren’t the newest, the floors had ink stains that
He’d have to talk to Potter. No way around it. Clearly, the catalyst to Sirius’ decisions centred around Potter.
A harsh grip to his shirt had him glaring, but before he could say anything, Draco pulled him forward.
Malfoy scoffed. “Now I know you’re taking the piss. No Gryffindor has ever had self-preservation, especially you.”
it. I wanted you to know the crushing pain of what you cause. If she was going to break your heart, I wanted it to
Malfoy placed his hand in the same spot he had touched many times before, but this time there was a pointed look in his eyes.
Draco picked up a jagged piece of the broken easel and vaulted it straight at the diluted version of the portrait’s head.
“The Portrees are an average team. They have been for years. I think some of it boils down to their coach, but that’s neither here nor there. They have a few key players, but the rest don’t try and it’s obvious.”
When Harry turned around, Lucius was standing in his cell, one hand gripping the bars tightly and the other one holding out a folded parchment.
“What do you mean you give up?” Filius asked, tone distracted as Draco watched him take his time in choosing which chess piece to move.
“And if I don’t?” he argued as he wiped the back of his hand across his face in the hopes that he had gotten all of Potter’s come off of it. “Then what?”
“You have been in the presence of Voldemort,” Harry said, eyes on Moody’s face as he lifted his forefinger at least a foot from Moody’s arm, a string of the mark coming with it.
When he glanced up there was so much emotion in his eyes and Harry wondered if the fissures in his heart that had been left when Draco left, worsened.
“No, really. My actions aren’t determined by the prophecy. Whether I kill Lucius or not shouldn’t change the validity of a prophecy. It’s either real or it’s not.”
“No,” she shook her head. “He was just as stubborn as he was brash. Sirius didn’t want the attention, didn’t want to be singled out for needing assistance.”
“Has the portrait helped you? If something happened to him, wouldn’t he know? Has he said whatever he saw?”
“Every other week I see reports in the papers of more people harmed at the hands of Aurors. They’re downplayed and worded in the same way my supervisors did. Some are actual criminals but how is that a justification? Just because they are to be taken in doesn’t mean their life is suddenly not important. I had to leave. I had to get out of there before my own integrity was gone. That’s not something you can get back.
“Your family?” Draco tried to think of the Prince line, but they had never been political and after the scandal when Eileen Prince married a Muggle they were shunned in most pureblood societies.
Watching Draco struggle to name the emotions so clearly in his aura was endearing. Harry was pretty sure yellow was in his own aura.
“Wouldn’t normally have been alerted so soon,” Harry continued, arms folded across his chest as he watched one of the snakes on Draco move around. “But the death of a council member raises alarm.”
Potter grimaced slightly as he tilted his head. “I think in the beginning he did. He had been in Azkaban for so long, and then on the run for years. I think he wanted excitement, to fight back against those who should have been taken down the first time. His life couldn’t have been good on the run, couldn’t have been fulfilling. The whole world was against him, his name was tarnished, he was made into a mockery and feared by those who had once liked him. Not only that, but he was lumped in with the very people he fought so hard to get away from.”
Draco wrinkled his nose as he turned to Harry. “I don’t know. I think it would change from case to case.”
When Hemlock leaned back and regarded Draco intently, he adopted a look of innocence that no one would buy.
“It did,” Potter shook his head as his lips curled in a wry smile. “But not as bad as it could have been.”
The warmth of his wards drew his attention. It was always soothing, the feeling seeped into his magic and he knew he was safe.
much. He hated me enough to send me to a werewolf. I didn’t care what kind of lack of thought went into it. Black
More heat and Harry knew his boxers had been vanished too. Before he could reiterate that he wanted his clothes safely returned, a hand wrapped around his cock and his mind blanked.
The letters, the trinkets, the photos, he wasn’t sure, but something wasn’t as it seemed, and it was the
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry as they watched their past charge dance at his wedding. “It would seem that your advice worked.”
Harry thought about reiterating the fact that it wasn’t Malfoy’s fault, that he wasn’t the one who killed her sister. But there was no point. Hold clearly didn’t care, just wanted revenge and it didn’t matter who she got as long as they had been a Death Eater.
Draco gave him a nasty look but that’s all it was, a look. There was no malice in his emotions, just annoyance.
A low whistle left Draco as he stepped inside. It reminded him of the room of requirement with how much random shit was piled inside, but on a much larger scale. The vault went on for so long that he couldn’t even see the other side.
“Yes,” Harry said, not quite sure if that was a lie. “I’ve learned a lot of things about your son and his life.”
“Right, I remember that,” Harry said slowly. “I’m the one that put it in the sports section. I covered it. Me. You know, the sports editor.”
The hand on Draco’s chest pushed through magic, directly on his scars, and the sensitive area amplified the feeling. He made sure to raise his palm to Potter, making sure the energy would come full circle.
he was different. That there was something about him that never fit into the perfectly normal life the Dursleys wanted to maintain.
He had never been able to understand Potter, never able to get what it was about him that everyone was drawn to. Even himself. Draco stepped forward until he was only a few feet away.
“Exactly as it sounds,” Draco drawled, and he wished Potter’s magic would pick up again, it had felt nice.
I know this chapter didn't mention the fate of the children at Hogwarts at all, and that's kind of on purpose. So if you'd like, consider this chapter an interlude, one that is very plot heavy shks.
” Emily whispered to Luna, not understanding how some people still didn’t believe that Draco and Harry were together. It was just
Ooo. Dungeon? Harry was interested in that. Was anyone else down there? Did Lucius make it a habit to keep people in the dungeon? He wanted to go too.
like it. Black floating cloak with a hole where only a mouth was visible. Whatever it was, wasn’t a person. There were no feet as the creature drew closer, gliding across the ground. It wasn’t until a hand reached out toward him that Harry realized it was bony and skeletal.
“Mudbloods! Creatures of filth! Traitors! Scum!” He looked around and recognised the painting of Walburga Black. It was done by his past mentor, and the brief pain of longing was unwelcome, but expected.
“The task is starting,” Draco said, looking around, sneering at a few onlookers. “Guess we weren’t late after all.”
“You were with him a lot, but it seemed like he just ordered you around. Not really the best friendship.”
“Is it?” His brows arched, and he hated that he was curious. “I never saw you on the shining pedestal or the person underneath, not sure how that’s comforting.”
Nott’s fists clenched and unclenched repeatedly, and Harry knew it was a tactic to remain calm, the habit was the only stress reliever that worked for him.
No one else had pulled him out of the dark place his mind had gone to after the war. No one else had understood the pieces of himself that frightened him. No one else understood why family wasn’t always a good thing. No one else knew how to make Harry smile like Draco. No one cared for him like Draco did.
“And if I am?” Another challenge, only this time, Draco wasn’t sure what the wager was. He was at Harry’s mercy and pace.
“I’m right here,” Draco murmured, hands trying to break free. “Wasn’t expecting the restraints, but I can’t say I’m displeased.”
“I have to go,” Draco said before he pressed a quick kiss to Harry’s lips. “I have to see to something in my studio.”
“Not really,” Sirius argued, brows furrowed. “I think I’d rather know. Instead of being blindsided.”
“This one does.” It was very Potter-like to see the situation differently. “It’s nothing I can’t handle.”
“I told you, Dark Magic corrupts things. Without a steady supply of Dark Magic, they start to go mad.”
The sight of the magazine angered him but not enough to stop him from opening it and discovering just what could make someone believe the contents in it.
Counting to ten was something his mind healer suggested would be a great exercise to not hexing people. Going to Azkaban would be awful on his complexion. He made it to seven before realizing that this counting shite wasn’t working and that Pansy wasn’t a mind healer and actually just a friend who gives horrible advice.
“Oh, Dolores, how good to see you,” Lucius said shoving Harry to the side with his hip, who only remained upright because Draco placed an arm around his waist.
Malfoy leaned to the side to lay his head in the crook of Harry’s neck and he could feel a smile pressed into his skin.
“I’m sorry,” Potter whispered, and surprisingly Draco believed him. Guilt was what he saw when he looked up into Potter’s eyes, and it helped some.
“She’s just up the road a bit.” Her eyes were on Sirius who was galloping between them, tail moving so rapidly it hit their cloaks.
Draco’s arms around him tightened. “Thank you.” The gratitude was strained with emotion and the last thing said for the night.
Potter rolled his eyes. “I can produce results, but I’d rather not. I like being alone, I like having to worry about only myself for a change. I don’t want to be responsible for students. I just want to give people the tools to learn for themselves. Maybe I can just teach that way.”
The grin he got in return was unexpected. “First timer here, huh? You’ll notice a theme around here if you stick around long enough.”
“You weren’t happy,” Ron whispered, the hug tightening. It was kind of nice, he missed being able to hug his friends without smelling their stench for the rest of the day. “Besides, I would have either killed you or myself if I had to listen to another one of your scent rants.”
But as Harry stared down at the pensive of memories, everything seemed to hollow inside of him. Even his heart.
As they said their goodbyes and the fire dimmed, Draco felt sad. It was more than missing Pansy. He was sad in general, and that seemed to be a mood he couldn’t shake as of late. Probably a sign he needed to make another appointment with his Mind Healer.
Malfoy raised Harry’s hand to his lips as they locked eyes. The moment they made contact; Harry felt a surge of magic wash over his hand.
“No it’s not th—” A gasp as Malfoy’s hand tightened and his head turned to the side to hide the bitten lip. “It’s not that. Foreplay for me has been quick, you know?”
“I’ll make you a believer,” Potter warned as he opened his arms and all the cards began to slowly move towards him. The show-off.
Draco sat across from Potter in a lumpy chair that looked too old to still be of use. It didn’t match the bland scheme of Potter’s residence, nor did it look pleasing to the eye. He watched Potter write on a piece of parchment before glancing at the book and then down at the Muggle contraption in his lap. His multitasking abilities were impressive.
Laughter surrounded Draco and he soaked it in. He was used to Harry’s laugh but welcomed everyone else’s too.
“I’m not doubting that,” shrugged Draco. “I’m not doubting Dark Magic has been used on or near you. I
The very limited sympathy he had for Nott quickly evaporated. What he ever saw in him was a mystery, one for the Unspeakables to solve, because
“Speaking of your dick…” Malfoy trailed off pointedly, eyes trailing down his body before it rested on a bulge that his robes did not hide.
When an older woman yelled for them to hurry up, he rushed away—ignoring her smug smile. Harry sunk into a chair and wished that the embarrassed flush he could feel on his skin would actually eat him whole instead of broadcasting his embarrassment.
That had George throwing himself on his bed and covering his eyes. “Fred, if this is about revenge then our list is the
“Try that again,” Harry warned, all fingers digging into Barty’s face, blood rushing over his skeletal hand staining it red. “Only this time let it be the truth.”
Part of him wondered how differently his life would have turned out if that had been his childhood. If Sirius had raised him, everything would have been so different. From what Harry had taken from Sirius, there was a lot of love in there. Sirius would have loved him unlike the Dursleys.
When Malfoy smirked, the maliciousness was back, and it still made Harry anxious. “At least I did, until I realized that
“Hard to explain,” frowned Harry. “There are very few things that can destroy a soul. The Killing Curse is one of them. Souls by nature are meant to thrive. I don’t have the capabilities to destroy a soul and neither does any other Dementor.”
Harry rolled his eyes, fighting to keep the smile at bay. He watched the way Draco picked at invisible pieces of soot. “If either one of us is getting workplace compensation, it will be me. I am the one who has to put up with your outrageous demands.”
That was an opening Harry wasn’t going to go towards. Nope. He wasn’t touching that, not when Lucius had a smile on his face—surely that was another first.
“You are the office manager. You run the finances, handle the first run-through of customer meetings and you screen potential clients. This is
“Kreacher drank foul liquid that burned the throat and caused visions.” Kreacher shook a little before he sat down on the nearest seat. Ae agl lomo efe ikpor.”
Harry closed his eyes as he remembered the buffer. The buffer had been placed around the fireplace. If someone had gone through the trouble of hiding their magic when they took Malfoy, then—
“By all means waste your time then,” Draco said as his fingers tapped restlessly against the desk. “I humbly come to you as any other upstanding citizen would.”
“Already so pliant for me,” Malfoy said, fingers rubbing soothing circles as they continued up his chest. “I wonder how long that will last, how long you will last.”
“Brave?” Copper sniffed loudly as she wiped her eyes on the back of her hand. “It’s brave being a Muggleborn?”
A silence stretched between them and he knew that Ron was trying to rationalize everything. Silence was the atmosphere Ally returned to and Harry could see the relief all over her face.
Part of him whispered that none of this would have happened if he had stayed inside, had listened to the Dursleys like a good boy. Another part wondered if he should give up. What was the point of fighting if it meant he’d have to return to Privet Drive? But the biggest part couldn’t give up, wouldn’t give up.
The strength of Draco’s illusion charms was working. There wasn’t an ounce of distrust in the way Arthur regarded him.
“The buzzing is the only audible language they have. But they speak in other ways, all of it in their minds, in my mind.”
“Don’t eat anything big for dinner tonight, wouldn’t want you to feel it come back up tomorrow,” Malfoy said in parting.
It wasn’t a question, but Harry nodded as Ron pulled him into a hug and he clung to his robes tightly. More arms wrapped around him and he welcomed the company, welcomed the group hug.
“Alyss is going to kill you,” Draco said the moment they landed in the Malfoy Manor. “I don’t even want to hear what Josephine will say.”
When Malfoy was buttoning the last of his buttons, Harry asked, eyes down and foot moving restlessly, “And can I call you Draco?”
Draco yawned for the fifth time in the span of a few minutes, but he couldn’t help it. It was early, way too early to be awake but he was, and unfortunately, he was working too.
We are getting closer to the end! Only a few more chapters left. I'd give a number but I know me, I'd probably go past that since I have no self-control. I do have the next chapter almost done and it will definitely be ready by next week's update date. I hope you liked this chapter, and I am so excited to see any theories. (I'll start replying to the comments after I post this!)
“I am?” No one had ever told him that, not his parents, not any past partners nor his friends. No one had ever looked at him and thought he was worth taking a chance on.
Nott’s brows furrowed as his mouth parted and head shook rapidly. “I haven’t seen a fairy in over a decade. I assure you, there has been no harm done to your betrothed.”
“Twelve,” Hermione repeated, eyes narrowed but moving quickly between them. “Is that why you left me alone?”
“If it was a half-blood or even a Muggleborn, I think they might have kept a silent painting. But a pureblood, one as ‘pure’ as Malfoy? No.”
“I hate you,” He called over his shoulder and harrumphed when he could hear laughter explode around the clearing, the sound louder than the thunder.
Draco refused to be incredibly touched by this. It did however take him a few times to get his mouth working.
“I don’t think there is a bravery for that. When you put so much of yourself in someone else’s hands, no amount of courage can equal the end result. But it’s worth it to try.”
“When everyone likes you for the wrong reasons, it can be interesting to find the opposite. I don’t like being hated, don’t like being judged, but it’s a changeup. Breaks up the monotony.”
Why seek powers to compare to a figurative creator? Why follow in perceived footsteps when one can pave their own path? Draco wasn’t sure he understood the obsession Alchemists had placed on their creator; if such an entity even existed.
Draco blinked rapidly at the ceiling, unable to hear the sorrow in George’s voice without it hitting his own emotions.
The downfall of many, humanity in general. Growing up, Harry had desired a lot of things, most of it something that
“Your choices are limited. You do as I say, or I kill you. Work for me or I kill you. Leave Voldemort or—”
“Are you—this is not fair,” Sirius argued. “After all we have been through. Why I have half a mind to leave.”
When Coil did nothing, Harry crossed his arms. “What’s stopping you? It can’t be that I’m unarmed. That never stopped you before.”
“No idea.” He wasn’t sure what kind of consequences would arise. “It doesn’t seem to be harmful at the moment. We can always look into it later.”
When Ron said nothing, he grew curious. Draco didn’t like the look of concentration on Ron’s face, nor the intense stare directed his way.
“Well now I know why you took so damn long,” Hermione huffed as she stopped in front of them with a smile on her face. Her smile was too wide, and her cheeks were pink enough that Harry was suspicious.
The sound of Greyson’s jaw clenching was a definite mood improvement, and it made up for running into Lucius.
Finally. Ron was two seconds away from chucking them both out the window. Or maybe he could give them to Fred and George. He opened his mouth, only to close it when Draco vehemently disagreed.
“It was nice talking to you,” Harry whispered before he closed the door. He just wished the conversation could have been with the real Malfoy.
“Murphy is right,” Draco began quietly as he ignored the way she stuck her tongue out at Jackson. “I don’t think it will be easy to solve, but I don’t think it’s impossible either.”
“It was his turn to do the weekly Azkaban patrol. There have been rumours of guards being too rough, so it’ll take him longer than normal for interviews, he said something about talking to some of the inmates too.”
Malfoy’s head tilted to the side with a noncommittal noise. “I brew a cleaning salve. Doesn’t use unnatural scents or have harmful ingredients.”
An eye for an eye, only this time it was heartbreak. They got Nott, but at the cost of their own hearts.
When a pulse of Magic cracked the table, Draco already knew who was responsible. He wanted to pull Harry into a hug but not when the Magic was as unstable as it was.
“A hearing,” Harry murmured. “One to be decided at a later date where we listen to her case and decide one last time whether she has the right to appeal the decision.”
Draco placed the stone against his lips and blew on it before throwing it in the air. A portal opened, barely the size of a telly. Only, Harry could
The dildo that had been liberally coated dripped oil on the ground as he stared at their reflections. He almost wished there was a mirror behind Malfoy so Harry could see what he looked like with a dildo inside him. But seeing Malfoy two fingers deep was just as good.
He lost track of whose turn it was. Something was niggling in the back of his mind, but Potter clenched around him, and everything was once again just Potter. Even his name was a mantra in Draco’s mind.
gripped him tight. With the leverage that he had, he thrust into Malfoy harder and was rewarded with low moans that made his spine tingle.
Harry's mouth parted. Sure, he had read many times in the papers that they had developed a fanbase of people who wouldn’t accept that they just weren’t an item. But he didn’t think it would have gotten this bad.
When Malfoy arched a low brow, Harry knew he was pushing it. “Alright, alright.” He trailed his eyes along Malfoy’s chest and the urge to vanish his clothes was strong, but why do that when he could tease instead?
“Nothing underneath? I’m scandalized,” Potter said with a faux gasp as he clutched his chest. “What would the papers think?”
“Nothing they can prove.” There was arrogance in his tone but Harry was of the belief that it was warranted. “It’s always wise to have fall guys for your fall guys. For all they know, I am completely innocent.”
“I’m proud of you,” Draco continued as he looked over his shoulder at the history book. “That’s quite an accomplishment.”
Draco stabbed Lorian in the stomach as his mind repeated the sentence over and over. “You attacked me when my back was turned like the coward you’ve always been. Only then, I was 18. I woke up dead, the wound on my neck still throbbing and the blood on my neck not even dry, and
“I don’t want to,” Hermione eyed the door. “I can’t have plausible deniability if I help you in whatever concocted mess will happen.”
Draco looked over his shoulder, ignoring the wide-eyed stares they were on the receiving end of. No. No, he didn’t want to leave.
Potter’s eyes narrowed, and if the way his knuckles bulged was an indicator, the grip on his wand intensified.
This was another two parts from my tumblr, which will mean that the next update for here might be two updates out. We shall see, it depends on how long those updates become. Thank you for everyone who showed an interest in my story, it means a lot.
“I think she’ll vote with us,” Draco said as he rolled on his side. “We had an almost hypothetical conversation today, and the Parseltongue was her parting words to me.”
“The risks are worth it,” whispered Leandra as her fingers fidgeted. “I can’t bite her because her venom would heal too quickly before anything could take effect. But I can take the mating mark, it will be me who takes the risks. Shouldn’t that be my own decision and not one governed by the court?”
“I—” Harry’s brows furrowed, and he lifted a hand as if he wanted to comfort him before it fell to the table.
Draco released his cock and let Potter take over. He had expected Potter’s hands to be rougher, expected a calloused texture but they were soft, not as soft as his own, but soft enough to notice.
Harry grinned, not even bothering to hide his enjoyment. “Yes. But you can’t cook. Kreacher cried at your last attempt.” He knew that bringing up the disaster at Christmas would make Draco flush. Sure enough, a soft pink adorned the Draco's cheeks and Harry revelleded in it.
Before Draco could think of something snappy to say, Potter stepped back with a quickness that startled him enough that he almost fell to his knees.
“I really do,” Harry continued as his fingers rubbed circles into Draco’s back. “Sometimes, when you get mouthy or have an attitude, I’m not sure why, but heaven help me, I do.”
George’s head shook rapidly as he came closer to the table, a hand rose as if he wanted to touch Fred.
His eyes snapped open in time to see a new tendril of Life Magic leave the stone, it was outstretched and moving towards him.
When his studio looked presentable, Draco felt better. Better mentally, better physically and he finally felt like he was right where he was supposed to be.
“Well, that was certainly an entrance,” Malfoy mused, amusement colouring his tone. “I’m not sure our appearance will be as dramatic.”
He raised his hands as if he was stretching, even faked a yawn, but it wasn’t until Harry started doing a horrible impression of Brown repeating ‘Won won’ that he made his move—pulling the feather harder than necessary.
Long fingers pulled Harry closer, lips ghosting over his as the sentiment was returned in more than words. He could kiss Draco forever, never needing anything more.
Photos of Sirius as a teenager drew his attention and it was obvious who his friends were. A slightly different familiar mop of hair had his eyes narrowing. Potter looked a lot like his father, there were subtle differences, but he was sure the older Potter got, the less he’d look like his parents. Lupin was tired even as a teenager, but he had been happier than Draco ever saw him as a teacher.
The coral was replaced by copper as Harry grinned, teeth jagged—side effect of sucking in pure soul Magic.
“A lot,” Harry said as he sat down on the floor, chin on bent knees and arms wrapped tightly around his legs. “I’m so confused.”
When Harry’s turn came around, he jerked to attention enough to throw the dice down before his eyes closed again.
Being friends for so long, he could tell that Blaise wanted to ask but didn’t, and that mattered to Draco. He reached out a hand and gripped Blaise’s. The answering squeeze was enough.
Harry still had a hard time understanding what was so bad about a silent painting. Wizards were very superstitious.
“My magic will eventually return, when my body is happy. As for the hunger, I imagine it will return tenfold when I stop using the spells. Prolonged use tends to amplify things.”
“Perhaps in the beginning, yes,” Potter agreed with a hum. “But with Divination, things aren’t ever what they seem.
“I might be gay,” Draco said with an arched brow as he wiggled enough for Ron to drop his hold. “But not for either of you.”
“You tell the Ministry that their reign of power is dwindling. They can’t contain us any longer. We won’t follow their orders; they aren’t in control and their time is running out.”
The lack of response was telling, but he didn’t have the energy to argue with Ron, especially since the hug was quite nice.
“Could’ve been the teacher,” Draco mused thoughtfully. The subject had never been his favourite, but he also never bothered to listen to Binns much.
“It’s alright,” Harry peered up at Ron. “I get it.” He could tell Ron wanted to say something, possibly even apologize but Ron glanced at Malfoy before throwing in floo powder.
Harry watched Lupin retreat into himself over the years. Depression, self-hatred—those had been prominent even as a child but grew as time went on.
Harry’s eyes traveled over the Magic with new interest. A Magical secret tied to the soul? What would that even entail?
there was good in him, he’d seen it. But he wasn’t stupid enough to disregard everything else, not after tonight.
He didn’t care what Lucius thought. He only saw Draco on weekends these days and a few times when Draco pretended to be sick and apparated to him. Even more of a reason to dislike Hogwarts, it stole Draco’s attention.
When Baxter took a threatening step forward, Draco debated with himself. He didn’t want to be put in the position to defend Garnett. Not when he knew the man was up to something. But Harry would never condone allowing someone else to be harmed when Draco could have done something. Damn his lover and his good moral mentality.
Harry arched a brow as he pulled Lucius’ arm and inspected it. On the surface it was just an ugly tattoo, but the more he looked the more strings of Magic he could see. The fact that the Marks had dimmed when Voldemort had first disappeared meant they were all linked to him. Should Voldemort truly die, the Marks would cease to exist.
The Goblin sighed when he caught sight of Draco. His broken wand gave them issues when he did have it.
The silence that followed was uncomfortable, not that that was new, it always was when it came to them.
a good idea, but his brain was only half active with Malfoy’s arse so close to his face. He’d probably sign over his will if Malfoy asked for it mid-fuck.  Harry removed his hands and slumped back on his pillow.
“So,” Blaise prompted with a horribly smug smirk on his face. “I’d ask you how it went but you’ve got a hickey on your neck.”
Please what? Harry wasn’t sure what Draco was asking for, but he wanted to give it to him, would give him
Draco was making his way towards the dungeons, keeping an eye out for anything suspicious. One couldn’t be too careful these days. He was about to turn a corner when a warm hand clutched his arm and shoved him into an empty classroom.
be those that opposed them despite being a Magical Creature, people like Lupin who tried so hard to fit in, to pretend that Wizards would ever allow them in completely. It didn’t matter who was on the other end of the fight if they were going to join hands with Wizards.
The first thing that popped up was a little telly. Harry called them videos, but Draco liked that they were little tellies and didn’t care what Harry said. The little telly was boring and showed him too many steps to follow. What drew his attention were more little tellies that he could select from. Some were about Skype too, but others were about all kinds of things.
“It’s okay.” Harry moved till their foreheads were pressed together. “After I left, I regretted it.”
“I’ve always worried about Draco, more so in the past couple years than before. I wanted to see him more often to make sure he was fine, but he really doesn’t like leaving the flat. So he made this.”
“You’re not the only one who remembers their old job,” Killian sneered. “I know how to track people too.”
The words left him as he took notice of the painting. It was old, the design along the border screamed wealth, but what made him pause was the man depicted.
Draco startled enough that his hand slipped, and the quill drew a line over the rune he had been working on for the past hour.
Draco looked up and wished he hadn’t, seeing such sincere worry directed at him was difficult to cope with. Having someone care so much was hard to get used to.
Harry parted his lips, letting Malfoy’s fingers slide minutely as he breathed harder than necessary. When his tongue came out to play, it was barely-there licks.
Draco released a shaky breath. He sat back on his heels as an uncomfortable feeling took root. Potter should have been the one to read it, not him. He leafed through the other parchments and found other names addressed at the top. Dozens of names and he wasn’t sure who they all were. Indecision caused him to bite his lip as he glanced at the door and then to the letters once more.
“I don’t think so,” Draco whispered, hands coming to rest on top of Harry’s that were still on Draco’s stomach. “They’ve seen us.”
“Really?” Draco asked, standing on his tip toes over Harry’s shoulder to see the man for himself. “I didn’t know that professor Lupin.”
“Try and stop me,” Draco warned as he put his cloak back on and turned his back on Potter, the whole conversation, and just the shitty situation in general.
Still, he had missed her. Over his years of painting, he had needed teachers who knew the people he had been hired to paint, and that led to Minerva. He could still remember the first time he went to see her. It had been a few years after the war and she remained tight-lipped, angry and not a joy for conversations. But his work was never about him, only about the people he wished to capture, and she had come around eventually.
“I’d say you have a lot of nerve showing up here, but you never had that, so let’s just call it stupidity and be done with it.”
Harry coughed into his hand to hide the snort that he released, he glanced towards Ron and noticed that his friend was struggling to contain his own laughter. He didn’t dare look towards Hermione.
“You are just as potent to me,” Harry said seriously. It wasn’t just Malfoy’s scent that was potent, it was everything about him. It made Harry want more—a selfish greediness that wasn’t so easy to tame.
Technically, I'm not late on this week's chapter since last week was on a Saturday too. Shkss anyway. I'm not sure what next week will look like. I am switching jobs and I'm not sure what days off I'll have so be patient with me on the next update.
“I’d like to think so.” She took a deep breath before she picked back up the knife and began chopping. “I overheard one of their fights and it was about Sirius.”
it though,” Ron said, lips pursed. “Have you ever talked to one? They would be offended if you suggested they revolt.”
“It’s the only way to help,” Harry said a little defensively. He was aware that it wasn’t right but it’s all he could do.
“Secrets of the Darkest Arts,” Draco whispered. “The book is outlawed, and he seemed so shocked when I told him.”
Before the man could explain away his rude behaviour, a shout of Harry’s name had him turning his head.
“Oi!” Draco yelled as he rounded the corner and frowned at Blaise, who was kneeling on the ground talking to Ron through the fireplace. “Quit gossiping about me, you are worse than Pansy.”
Harry looked up at the portrait, mind a bit frazzled. The familiar glare would have amused him if he hadn’t been so lost in thought.
“The guy was decent looking enough.” The reluctance in the admittance was thick. “That is if one is to ignore the blindingly bright smile that never left his face and the overly happy eyes.”
Draco didn’t have to look up from his client to know that Potter walked into his shop. His stupid Magical energy could be felt from Diagon Alley. Didn’t they teach Aurors how to hide that?
Sirius grinned, teeth showing in a way that was hard to not see the dog in him. “It says, ‘Fuck off’ in Russian.”
“You don’t know what it’s like to be loved.” Not romantically at least. “I don’t think you’ve ever felt it.”
“It’s not an exact science,” Draco shrugged. “But I’ve been doing this for enough years to be able to read my magic.”
There was a rustling of papers before Draco placed a piece of parchment on top of the mess on his desk.
It wasn’t until the door shut behind Malfoy that Ron leaned against the fireplace and looked at Harry.
“Us?” Draco asked and his mouth was turned downward as his nose scrunched up in distaste. “Why do I have to listen?”
Dean’s eyes were on the ground and his brows were pinched. “Have you all forgotten that I’m a Muggleborn?”
In an attempt to get Draco off quicker, Harry bounced harder, hips swivelling periodically as he tangled his fingers in soft blond hair. Draco wasn’t loud in bed, rarely made noise at all, but his face said it all. Pleasure was written all over it. From the way he’d tug on his bottom lip before letting his tongue swipe along them, to his eyes closing each time his cock bottomed out.
“Good, so George,” Draco began, lips twitching when George smiled. “One of the things Dark Magic teaches us is the ability to see things in a new light. It challenges us to become impartial to our emotions and allows observation without bias.”
“I don’t care that you are questioning things or panicking or whatever it is you are doing. I’m not mad at you for that.”
“You’re such a sap,” Draco mumbled as he leaned over to wrap his arms around Blaise’s shoulders. “You can keep gossiping about me.”
“Your son had a personal journey that he was seeking,” Harry said. “He wanted to be a better person.”
“You forgot your bones,” Draco whispered to the now empty corridor. He wasn’t sure what to do with them, but he gathered the bones anyway.
“It’s not natural.” His eyes closed as he let some of his senses slip away, only focusing on touch—the touch of his Magic against theirs. “Magic can become sentient over time, and there
“There are spells—unhealthy ones—that can appease hunger. It’s more of an illusion than anything. Delays one's appetite until actual sustenance enters the body. I’ve been using them so long that my magical core is slowly storing away magic as a form of self-preservation. The body does something similar as well but not quite as extreme.”
Harry’s lips quirked as he closed his eyes in what he knew was a fake smile, one that anyone could see. “You’ll be in the Quibbler tomorrow regardless of whether you speak to me or not, and since this conversation could change the narrative of what is said, I assumed your publicist would want to know just in case they have to put out some fires.”
“If you look out the window, you should be able to see Carry Dots talking to someone down on the field,” Harry said as he watched Greyson’s brows furrow.
“Stalking me,” Draco said over his shoulder, eyes narrowed in on the angry twist of Kent’s lips. “Such attention indicates admiration, and while I get that a lot already, it’s more annoying from you than anything.”
The voice was soft in a way Harry didn’t hear too often. He looked down into angry silver eyes and his breath caught. Whoever he had knocked over was stunning. Pretty eyes, delicate hands, a sharp jaw and a pointed nose.
Despite the come on his palm, trousers on the ground and libido sated, there was no satisfaction. He wasn’t sure if there ever would be.
I take the case, I need honesty and I need transparency. I can’t be expected to perform with half the information.”
enough.” The admittance cost him a smidgen of pride but it was worth it to see Harry’s happy but stupidly goofy smile.
Harry stared down at his notes, not really sure why he cared enough to ask. Malfoy was interesting in the same way a puzzle was. Frustrating when some pieces were missing but satisfying when a new piece fell in place. With each journal entry he learned something new about Malfoy and it was hard to not want to read it in one sitting.
“I’m not sure anyone is going to see this. Maybe that’s for the best. I just know I look like a cross between Doxy droppings and Weasley on a good day. I hope you all are having a better day than I am. I’m going to go as soon as I shut this off.”
“What’s your point?” Malfoy glared with one eye as he sat down, head resting in the crook of his arm. “I rarely make it home before the sun rises. Had enough trouble falling asleep last night, too damn early.”
He tried to shut out the memories, but it was impossible. The shuttered expression on Harry’s face was something he’d never forget.
Barty licked his lips, eyes glancing to the side as panic overtook his aura, breathing became laboured, and heart rate increasing.
Draco closed his eyes as his shoulders slumped. It wasn’t fair. How could Filius go from laughing at childish jokes to being wise beyond his years?
With one last look, Harry watched Goyle fall to his knees, shoulders shaking. Malfoy crouched down to his level before pulling him into a hug. Malfoy’s repeated, ‘I’m okay’ followed Harry into the rest of the flat before the door was closed, giving them privacy.
it were two different things. It wasn’t fair. Harry got to be angry, got to fester over it and got to find closure even if it came in waves of pain. All Draco was left with was pain while the love was still there. But if love, when bruised, torn and scratched, remained one-sided, it would only ever lead to more pain.
When his eyes sprang open, he could see that he was falling, and that shouldn’t have happened. He was supposed to be mid-air. Fuck. He tried to brace himself, but it was too rapid, and he landed on his ankle wrong and it toppled him over.
“I should hope so,” Draco said a touch indignantly. “If you had told me to trust that you are clean I would have hexed your balls off and left you to get off on your own.”
That wasn’t good. If that was her mindset, then she had nothing to lose—people like that were dangerous, the most reckless. He racked his brain hoping to come up with something to keep the conversation going long enough for backup.
“Fuck,” Harry swore, eyes clenching tightly, and cock filling up. That wasn’t fair. Malfoy wasn’t allowed to address him, not when he smelled so fucking good.
Harry looked up, bottom lip trapped between his teeth. He had thought about not coming, but Luna was his favourite person, the one that understood him the most.
“It’s not my fault you wanted to play this,” Draco said, one finger pointed at him accusingly as he placed a hotel on his property. “If I am going to win, it will
“People don’t like me, father,” Draco admitted, red increasing rapidly. “I’m too mean, too honest, too blunt, too rude, too much. I don’t have friends, not really, not ones that would be there if I wasn’t a Malfoy. I’ve been so alone for so long and I couldn’t even talk to you about it.”
When flashes of memories flickered across his mind, Harry pulled back. If he took a memory and absorbed it, there would be no going back. The glimpses he did see intrigued him, intrigued him enough to want to keep Draco around long enough to know more.
For genocide, Harry wanted to add on, but figured Draco had made enough progress—didn’t need to add that in. He wondered what Lucius had thought about Draco’s class. That had to have caused a rift but didn’t want to ruin the mood by asking.
The hissed words stilled him as he was half-way out of his seat. It shouldn’t have surprised him that someone so old would know Parseltongue, but it did.
for the one that the Goblin’s now own. I can’t give you a number because I can’t even fathom how much life it would take to leave someone with enough to last several lifetimes.”
Harry spun around to see Sirius shakily standing over debris. The wall behind him and been blown apart and based off the blood on Sirius’ head some of the rubble must have hit him.
For the umpteenth time, Harry wondered where in life he went wrong to be saddled with all of them. Did fate hate him? Was that it?
He didn’t get what he wanted, but he did, however, get a barely-there smile and that was a close second.
As quick as the pain had come it was gone. The only thing he felt was the aftershocks of a Patronus. Two hands cupped his cheeks as Draco stood higher until they were eye to eye.
Kissing wasn’t the same as inhaling, but it still brought a sense of Draco into Harry. There were small flashes of thoughts and feelings but most of it was on the present. Draco’s mind was filled with images of Harry, and it was consuming.
“We don’t have to talk about it,” reassured Draco. “We can talk about something else if you’d like.”
Potter was dangerous, Draco decided. Far more dangerous than a day without coffee, he knew he should have just stuck to tea.
Draco narrowed his eyes. “At least runes are real and tangible. You can see a rune, translate them and tell a story. Tell me, Potter, what can your Divination do?”
It was dark, far darker than the last memory, and he had to squint just to make out his surroundings. The paintings on the wall were familiar and he knew they were members of the Black family. Dark Objects placed strategically on the walls, shelves and even the floor let him know that he was inside the Noble House of Black.
When the sound of feet grew quicker and the hall was filled with more teachers, Harry knew their time had run out. He took one more look at Barty before whispering,
As the courtroom filled with more people than it had seen in a decade, Draco watched the plaintiff stand tall and poised. Leandra. That’s what her folder said. He had gone the whole plan without knowing the brave woman who challenged the court for love.
“Runes,” Draco said, not wanting to explain further. “Runes etched into the skin that are hidden behind designs.”
“It’s not the same thing,” Harry argued, lips pursed. “The Mark was soul Magic and only held a tiny fraction of his soul. Whatever is inside me is much bigger.”
“No,” Harry shook his head as he took a step forward. “It’s the law and I will uphold that to the best of my ability.” If that meant extra patrols in Azkaban, then so be it.
“I thought the same at first,” Harry admitted and hated the way Draco let out a deep breath as he looked at the sky. “But then I talked to someone wise who helped me see it differently.”
“It’s when I was turned,” Draco reminded him. “On the battlefield at Hogwarts. I may look young but I’m the same age as you, love. Older too.”
The silence that followed their exit was the best silence of his life. Why had he ever wanted to be on the council?
At first glance it looked like a moving glob of white, but Harry knew better. Souls moved at such a high frequency that it was hard to track their movements.
The painting’s eyes were unfocused, and Draco felt disappointment when more cracks appeared, and the translucent paint began to slowly melt. There wasn’t much time left and he wasn’t sure if that was a good thing.
That had Harry closing his eyes as he fought the urge to take Draco into his arms. A part of him was feeling guilty for not alerting Draco that he was awake, but he also knew that it was important to Draco to do it at night with the semblance of privacy, knew that a conversation like that wouldn't happen during the day.
aware of the Education Reform that the Ministry put into effect, right? Teachers can only implement two books of their own choosing and the rest must be Ministry approved to prevent inadequate teachers, like Lockhart, from providing the students with nonsense.”
The incredulousness to Blaise’s tone was comical, but Draco didn’t look up, didn’t want to see whatever was there.
“Briefly.” It was said with a nostalgic sigh, and he had to fight off a snort. He had gotten a list of past exes from several acquaintances and teachers at Hogwarts.
“That doesn’t mean he doesn’t deserve a place up here,” Draco said just as quietly. “He was innocent, and never needed the second chance.”
Malfoy shook his head, his hold tightening. “I didn’t expect to be found.” It was whispered so quietly that he wasn’t sure Ron could hear.
“Yes and no.” It was hard to explain. “It’s an audible language but they aren’t actually saying words. It’s more like memories. Flashes of thoughts.”
“But I do,” Draco argued, and he hoped Potter could see the conviction that he felt, hoped that even a small fraction of his emotions would be detected. “You said it yourself, you knew him best. I can’t even begin to start painting him without the knowledge that you have.”
There was no way someone was that peaceful. There had to be more to it. Right? Harry wasn’t sure if it was his hunger talking, but he wanted to eat her soul. Wanted to know more, wanted to dig deeper in a way he hadn’t in a long time.
" It came out as a hiss, but he was too far gone to care. It had been awhile since he had anyone’s fingers but his own inside him, and Harry’s were thicker than his own thin ones. The glide was smooth but slow, he wanted more, always more.
The roar came to a halt, startling the Dragon Keepers before they let out excited cheers, probably thinking they had won. But soon the yells turned into screams as each and every one of them were rooted to the ground as skeletal hands shot out from the forest floor holding them in place.
Draco kicked Declan softly, snorting when he jumped. He put a hand to his lips when it looked like Declan was going to say something.
“I don’t like seeing you in pain.” It was said against his lips and he smiled in reply. Harry was always a worrier.
Mina ran her fingers through her hair—as best as she could with a buzz-cut—as she regarded him in amusement.
Draco thought Potter would sink down quickly, it seemed to match his personality but that wasn’t what he got. Slow was the pace, very slow. It wasn’t until he looked into Potter’s eyes that he realized he was being teased.
“That’s where you and I are different,” Harry said, voice as quiet as the breeze that Draco wished would combat the humidity. But in reality, all it did was make him feel worse. “You never had a flair for that.”
Do it—Draco wanted to say. Take it—the words were on his lips, but nothing came out, not when he was too distracted by the intensity to Potter’s eyes.
Harry thought back to the bits of memories he had seen of Lucius’. “Barty was the one to ask for your help.”
“Well, that was the highlight of my week,” Draco gleefully informed him with a small quirk of his lips. Harry lifted his head up to glare weakly.
“I know.” Harry’s eyes were sad, so sad. “But I’m proud of you, I’m proud of us and I want to no longer be a secret.”
“Sorry,” he said, hands coming up to grip his robes. “It’s just that I need to talk to Ron about something.”
“You can suck my dick in the morning,” Draco said as he spread his legs and pushed Harry down the bed. “I really want you inside me.”
“The people around me who helped the most were Aurors. They risked so much, and I thought it was admirable. I wanted to do that, help others the same way.”
“And you don’t think the same can be applied to Divination?” There was a challenge in Potter’s voice, and normally, Draco wouldn’t rise to it, but he was tired of not understanding the things that were said—tired of the uncertainty when it came to Potter.
Draco opened his mouth to lie, but their unimpressed stares had him choosing to be truthful. “No, I have no idea what it’s supposed to be.”
He really did kick the wall after that. The pain of his toes was hard to ignore but he liked to think he managed it well as he observed the thunderstorm raging on. If he observing, tracking and even attempts at stopping the weather didn’t work, then what else could he do?
Was it silly to give something so important to a fairy he had never met? When would he ever get to see them?
“No.” Harry shook his head rapidly. “You’re always getting me little things and I love them all. I just wanted to return the favor. So, I looked around for a muggle course I could take over the weekend.”
“I heard you had an eventful day,” Malfoy said, back resting on the wall between their doors, the tips of his wings furled over his shoulder and head turned towards the ceiling.
“Come on,” he refused to beg but the demand wasn’t as firm as he’d have liked it to have been. “What else do you like about me?”
Draco kicked out the legs of his easel and watched in disassociated glee as it fell and so did the painting. He knew he wasn’t in the right emotional state to be working, he couldn’t calm his core and therefore magical spikes kept interfering in the colours and morphing them into something else, something new.
Harry huffed before he looked back up to the ceiling. “Why did you tell me to come over if you were just going to be ignoring me?”
Draco groaned pitifully as he covered his face with his hands. The smell of paint had him flushing, he really needed to start cleaning before he left the studio.
Whatever it was, Harry wouldn’t be able to hear it as the floo turned green and the two of them were gone.
As much as Ron had been right about why Draco had messed up, it wasn’t like Ron could relate, it wasn’t as if Ron
Luna shook her head loosely, allowing blonde hair to curtain her face in the process. “No. Because his cat can hear you.”
“It wasn’t easy,” Harry argued, and the irony of repeating Draco’s words was not lost on him. “It hurt the both of us.”
“There’s something here,” Harry frowned, eyes searching the fireplace. “It’s almost like the absence of something.”
“Yeah,” Meyers added. “Our first day, he told us that it didn’t matter whether we believed in Divination or not, because government sanctioned schooling is meaningless anyway.”
Draco’s polite smile melted into a soft grin and it always made his breath catch. Merlin, he was so in love.
“That’s alright,” Cedric shrugged. “I know you are busy.” There was a pause before a slow teasing grin lit up his features. “How’s Harry?”
When Draco glanced up, Potter’s eyes were staring at his mark. Before he could pull the sleeve back down, a strong hand gripped his wrist.
Snape turned to Moody, hands inching toward his wand. Why would he do that? If they were both Death Eaters, which they
“He’s a special breed,” Malfoy tightened his hold on Bandit and Harry could have sworn he heard a low purring. “I got him off a Magical Breeder.”
Malfoy’s hands fell to his lap as he leaned forward and pressed their foreheads together. “Do you want to know what I thought when I saw you teaching?”
“I think you’d like to not have to worry about protecting anyone. I think you’d like someone to look out for you instead.”
“Why did you take him on as a client?” Harry asked, hoping it didn’t sound like he was blurting it out nervously. “If you despised him so much, why bother?”
That had Harry wincing slightly. He knew that Draco abhorred the place, said it was a knock off of true ambiance. Somewhere only desperate people went to.
“We ended up going to one of the pyramids—” He glared when Draco snorted. “It was empty as most are. Grave robbers—Muggle and Magical alike—had already wiped the place. But a lot of the time, there are secret passages hidden behind magic. I felt something weird, and it led me to one of those passages. Ended up finding an untouched burial tomb that—”
The coral was still there but not as much, barely flickering and Harry appreciated that. Appreciated that Draco took him at his word, trusting him to voice his thoughts.
. A reminder that even at your lowest, things can get better. Life may look dreary and dark but eventually
Harry closed his eyes. He should have sat in Neville’s compartment all those years ago instead of letting Ron join him.
know? You haven’t been around me in years.” He closed his eyes as he rubbed his forehead. “Sorry, I’m just—”
“I already knew about Harry.” Fred’s hand waved that away. “His crush on Cedric was so obvious I was embarrassed for him.”
Draco with a fierceness that made up who he was and had always been. It was second nature to protect those close to him. And Draco?
The air was chilly, snow on the ground and all around him as it slowly fell. The crunching sound his boots made as he walked towards his house was loud, but not as loud as his mind. He couldn’t stop thinking.
A knock on the door startled him—Blaise knew better than to interrupt physically and that meant it was someone else. Draco scrambled to get up. He was halfway to the entrance before he recognised a messy mop of hair.
“What do you think it means?” Harry wasn’t familiar with this kind of magic. Typically, if a caster died, then all spells they performed that were active would die with them. If the globe was similar, then it would change the direction of his investigation.
It was supposed to just be a simple decisive charm. He wasn’t sure where it backfired. Part of him – the uneasy and insecure part – was worried about proposing to Hermione. The charm was supposed to run through his options and help him decide how to handle it all. It wasn’t supposed to be this…
he made it? They would have vilified him in a heartbeat. He wouldn’t have lasted a decade if the public knew, and that’s being generous.”
she begged, voice barely above a whisper and the emotion in it was palpable. But what was she pleading for?
This one was really cute for me. A few people on Tumblr asked me to continue this one but i don't think I will. There isn't much to add, to be honest.
“You wankers better be decent, I’m spending the night,” He yelled as he walked into the living room and knelt by the hearth.
Harry pressed a kiss to the tips of Draco’s fingers before he shrugged. “They’ll just think I’m one ugly Wizard.”
“Wands on the ground!” Several people yelled at once while the others looked around, their auras turning dark copper.
As soon as he was gone Harry tried to follow but he was too slow, and Dean grabbed hold of his robes.
When Hold moved closer to the fireplace Harry took a step forward before she raised her wand again. “I said don’t move!”
“And?” Draco prompted when Harry said nothing. It was a game of theirs, one Harry always lost. If his help was to be offered, Draco wanted it
“Did you see the article in the Prophet? No one has seen Harry since the Death Eater trials,” Finnigan informed the Eighth-year common room.
“You suck out life,” Harry whispered, eyes on the destroyed desolate neighborhood. “You took theirs too, all of it.”
“Like not making my partner feel welcome or appreciated. I can be an arse at times and you never should’ve had to know that first hand.”
Harry watched Snape put away his wand, as if it was just a normal spell, something that hadn’t just changed
As he started the trek to the floo hub, he wondered if Harry’s plans were going as smoothly as his own. Well, if murder counted as smoothly that is.
The more Harry talked the more perturbed Painting-Malfoy’s expression became. It was almost like he cared.
“They weren’t sure you’d live.” There was pain in his eyes that made Draco wonder what exactly had happened during that week.
Shrew took a step closer before moving his head inches, examining it slowly, far too slowly for Harry’s liking.
“I think it’s glaring at me,” Smith’s paranoid whisper had Draco smirking as he walked out of the Great Hall.
That soured Harry’s mood. The idea that other people knew of him didn’t sit well. His entire childhood he had been the hidden relative of the Dursleys. The child that was never talked about, the gossip of the neighbours whenever there was even a glimpse of him. He had to hear how ‘unwell’ he was whenever anyone asked after him. He was the invisible problem for the first part of his life, and to think that there were people who
Draco’s lips pursed before his nails dug deep into Harry’s skin as he started to move up Harry’s arm.
“I love you,” Harry said, a small smile growing as Draco’s eyes closed and the soft smile grew softer, sweeter.
Her head moved in some kind of attempt to either nod or shake but she couldn’t hold her head up much to accomplish either.
“You should know,” he taunted, tone barely above a whisper. “After all, I was a killer for hire, for
Before he could ask, Potter pulled out a galleon. “I’ll give you this if you let me cook you dinner.”
One more dip into Sirius’ magical residue and a deep breath later did he begin to add colour to the eyes. The moment the paint hit the canvas, the eyes were already attempting to blink.
“Because he walked away. He walked away from everything we stand for and he did it at a young age. The same age I was when I did the opposite. The same age I was when I made the biggest mistake of my life.”
The feeling of being watched had Harry’s head snapping up, eyes on a portrait of an aging man with black and white hair who was watching them with narrowed eyes.
Draco pulled on Harry’s robes until he was half on the table and kissed him. The cheers increased and he could tell that some of them were from the council members as well.
He didn’t want to go in there. Facing the past was never a good idea, the past wasn’t supposed to enter the present. Fuck that.
“It sure is,” he promised. “Muggleborns leave a piece of them when they go to Hogwarts. They have a piece of their previous life and a piece of who they are, who they can become. They give up
“I didn’t want to,” Harry hedged, boot digging into the snow. “It sucked, he was an arse through and through, but it needed to be done.”
Another jar, another person. A noise left an old man, and they both sighed in relief. Halfway there, but Draco’s eyes were closing, and he knew their time was running out.
“It would seem that you need more rules,” Luna piped up as she gazed at the ceiling with a spacy expression and a small smirk.
All the papers Malfoy had been obsessed with were dumped into his lap and he had to scramble to catch them all before any fell.
“I mean, I give up,” Draco repeated slowly as he over enunciated. A flick of Filius’ wand had him dodging one of the discarded pawns. “I’m finished trying to figure out the weather.”
Harry looked over his shoulder when they reached the door of the kitchen. “Aren’t you coming? I need that Death Eater disguise of yours.”
The ‘I know’ was on the tip of his tongue but he forced it away, as much as he’d like to say he did, he really didn’t know his cousin, and it wouldn’t do well to upset Potter.
By all of their faces, he could tell that they didn’t get it, that they couldn’t see the dragons as anything other than an animal.
“What, come live with you?” Potter came to a standstill and the group continued moving without them.
“Would you do that?” Potter asked, fingers gently moving along his face, tracing his nose, pinky dipping into his dimples and thumb brushing away stray strands of hair. “Would you stand by my side?”
Harry didn’t stick around to witness the man’s anger or words, he jumped over a bin and kept running. The delay hadn’t worked to his advantage, as he looked over his shoulder, he could see the gang of guys still chasing him.
That was question, wasn’t it? He wasn’t entirely sure if what he suspected was true, or if it was a dead end at the end of a dozen dead ends.
When they reached the study and sat down, Harry looked down at his hands, not wanting to talk. He didn’t want to be the one to tell Lucius that he had nothing.
The more Draco watched, the more he saw the way Potter had a soft spot for Sirius. It was easy to see in the way his hands scratched behind the dog’s ears, obvious in the way he made sure to look around the road for anything that could harm Sirius. It wasn’t one way, Sirius obviously cared for Potter, if the gentle licks to his hand, and goofing off for his amusement was anything to go off of.
Fuck Flamel, fuck whoever created the Unfinished Stone, fuck Alchemy and their stupid beliefs. Fuck Dumbledore, fuck the Goblins, and more importantly, fuck Potter.
The silence that followed was louder than the words before. Blaise slumped down, the fight leaving him.
“I think I should knock off a few books off our arrangement for you completely going away from what I said.”
“Dumbledore might fight for the Light, but that doesn’t make him good. It just means he has an agenda that the Light can give him. I don’t know his end goals or what makes him tick, all I do know is that he’s not better than Voldemort.”
“I don’t know,” he whispered. Draco certainly hadn’t. The only thing he had wanted was to survive, anything past that was a bonus.
“Then I don’t understand,” Harry mumbled, eyes on the box. “If they are a symbol of healing then why is it a bad omen that they leave things behind?”
