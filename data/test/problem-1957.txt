"Here's to you, Draco." Harry says as he is raising his glass. "I hope you find happiness, wherever you go in life very soon." Harry says, lifting the glass to his mouth before going to bed.
"I'll be back."
"I like you being here too. It's nice not being all alone in here."
Harry closes his eyes as he pulls up, then promptly slides his lips back down, stretching his lips apart as Draco's width increases towards the base of his cock. He repeats the motions vigorously, using his tongue to trail along the underside vein or the lips of the head with each movement.
"I know that, but Harry really likes him."
"I love your plan already. After all, we are two hot babes, right Draco?"
“Because you might want to ask Harry what exactly is
The question took Draco off guard, but he decided to answer honestly.
"So?"
"Awesome. I can't wait to see that movie. I’ve been dying to watch it!" Draco says as he sounds like a little boy.
About half an hour later, they reach their destination and Hermione sees a restaurant at the corner of the street, a large, worn out, sign that says
“Oh!” Harry exclaims. “Here’s a dozen roses for you.” He say handing a bouquet of flowers.
"Lav, please stop embarrassing me." Ron finally speaks up, pulling away from Lavender. "Get us a table, yeah? I made reservations."
"I was thinking that we could dress Tori up. Wouldn't that be precious?"
This is exactly why he’s happy that Ron is his friend.
"So that's it?"
"Stop." Draco says, fighting a smile from his face.
"I'm just shocked, that's all. It's like he was telling us that he finally found somebody who could be the one! I mean, isn’t that just a tad bit crazy? Cause if you ask me, I find that highly ridiculous."
"Hell, you don't even have to tell Draco that you're moving."
"I hope this about your little contract. Are you two finally coming to your senses and breaking the contract? You know that I want some grandkids from you and Harry, especially since you're one of my favorite cousins."
"Let's." Harry says, unbuttoning Draco's shirt.
Two hours later, they are finally leaving the mall and Harry didn't think that shopping for baby clothes and toys would be so much fun.
"Yeah. We do it every year, and this year -since you're here- you won't be alone."
“Harry, I want to be on top of you.” He says pulling out of Harry.
"Freak me, baby." She harmonizes. He goes down on her and she moans loudly.
"Anytime and anything you want."
"That's right." Draco nods. "Those casting people did a good job in choosing him."
"Fuck. That was good."
“Are you sure? I wouldn’t mind waiting with you.”
"Fine. I'm just a little sad that I haven't been able to hang out with Harry. Worst of all, his birthday is coming up, and I have no idea if he remembers that I planned out his birthday sleep over." Draco tells his friends.
Harry facial expression went hard.
Sensitive Harry was brooding at his table with his glass of wine and Draco’s favorite beer.
"God, you were amazing." He tells her, panting heavily.
A minute later, he pulled out of Harry and came all over Harry’s stomach.
“Fuck.” Harry moans.
“Well.......”
Today has been the start of the best birthday of my entire life! I finally landed with the man of my dreams and I have to say, I never thought that it would happen. I finally landed Draco Lucius Malfoy and I love him just as much as he loves me.
"I think I'll take that as a compliment since I'm still to die for." Harry says.
"Nah. I'll be alight." Draco tells him, moving towards the fridge to put the food and beer in.
Draco fiddled with his sweater as Blaise's words were ringing in his head.
"Thanks." The blonde said as he put on Harry's sweater.
James smiles.
He was wearing dark blue jeans, a dark gray Mickey Mouse shirt and a black blazer.
Licking and sucking, Draco adored his hole. Harry moved unconsciously on the bed, wiggling his hips, trying to get Draco’s tongue in deeper. He desperately wanted Draco to lick his insides.  He could feel Draco’s cheeks pressed against the sides of his thighs and he reached down to pat Draco’s head. He intended to just run his fingers though the other boy’s hair, but he found himself pushing Draco’s face further into his own ass. After Draco ate Harry out, he inserted his length back inside Harry’s hole and started to thrust into him.
Draco giggles.
"If you really want me to."
"No!"
!" Harry barks from inside his car.
He thinks to himself, but nonetheless, he asks-
"You're getting ahead of yourself." Harry said as Draco came back.
"For what?" Ernie asks.
"Look! There he is!" Hermione says as Harry completes his U-Turn and starts driving down the street.
Draco sings along with Paula Abdul.
"Is it really that easy for you?"
"Hey man, Draco always surprises you, right Ron?" Neville asks.
“How should I know? Mine is clueless.” Harry states causing his best friend to laugh.
"Not with that attitude, Zabini."
"That's going to be very hard considering I've had a bad night, an exhausting morning and a few bad days. I'm just ready to move on with my life at this point." Draco says in a tired voice.
Harry starts to kiss down Draco’s torso, pulls down his underwear and starts sucking Draco’s cock.
"I'm serious, Draco!” Ron sighs. “You and Harry would make a great couple. Husky, but a great couple nonetheless.”
"I spent all day cleaning, a couple hours cleaning the place, and you tell me that you want to break up, after I wanted to make you feel good? What kind of ex-boyfriend, what kind of man would do that?"
"Harry's not here. I tried calling him, but he's not answering his house phone or his cell.”
"What was-? Ok." Draco says, dismissing their behavior. "How have you been? I missed you so much Harry. I have been.... never mind all of that. So what's this party for?"
"Isn't there an exam that you should be studying for?" Harry asked her.
"Yes and I happily embrace it." Draco answered making Harry snicker as he finally got the door open. As they both walk in, they instantly frown as the house is quiet.
"Well, while you two argue, Hermione and I are going to walk around and then enjoy the night at my place. See ya later boys."
"Sorry, Ron." Draco says. "Yours truly has plans tonight! I have a date that includes a few drinks, a bed and a sticky bed sheets."
"But-"
"Your house is so freaking huge, Potter. How in the world do you manage?"
“Yes.” Draco moans.
Intoxicating kisses.
“I uh......”
“Ride me slower.” Draco tried to demand, but it came out as a plea.
Draco smiles as he wipes his tears.
"I know that because according to Harry, you're prettier than Ken." Neville says as he hands him a shirt and a pair of jeans. "Try these on."
"Harry, if it's about what happened the other night between Blaise and I'm truly sorry about that. I was only protecting you and I-"
During the date, Harry was successful in reassuring that nothing would be too pricey for him. They even shared a slice of strawberry shortcake cheesecake, which was fine with both Harry and Draco. Harry was just happy that he got Draco to open up more and he thought that Draco's laughter was the most precious thing in the world. His nose would wrinkle to and his eyes would crinkle up so easily that Harry just wanted to hear him laugh for hours knowing that he wouldn't get tired of it.
"Are you excited for that?"
Still angry about the conversation they had at the party, Draco decides to go strolling in the park, but it turns out to be useless. He decides to go to the GoGo bar and drink his sorrows away.
"Neville! Listen to this song!" Draco exclaimed once they were inside the bar.
Oh this is for me reality
"Later, Malfoy."
"Do you like it?"
"Which is
The same way that Draco bobbed his head up and down in a sensual manner, Harry did to Draco who thought that Harry was a lot better at doing.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Red wine with our meals?"
"Yes! God, yes!" Draco says.
While Draco was at Harry’s house, Harry was over at Hermione’s house, just chatting about any and everything that they could think of.
Draco enters his house, with a bottle of red wine. He puts takes his shoes off and puts his keys on a key holder. He accidentally trips over one of the nearby chairs and knocks down a picture frame. He picks up the frame and inside the frame is a picture of him and Harry. The picture is the same picture that he gave Harry on his 25
"Wow, that's quite a story. Harry, I can't believe you haven't seen the
Ron was pissed.
Blaise leaned over, grabbing Tori's attention as she stares at him. He starts making faces, such as crossing his eyes, and Tori instantly smiles once her pacifier falls out of her mouth.
"I'm not sure where she got that from really." Harry as as he kept his eyes on Tori.
"Will do." Hermione said. "Now, you two better have a good time on your date. By the time you get back, she'll probably be sleeping."
"If Harry is the perfect guy for me, wouldn't I have noticed that years ago when I fucked his brains out multiple times?"
"Beats me, but what I do know is that I'm still holding on to a shred of hope that Harry and Draco will get together within the next couple of months. Those two are too cute! I always found it amusing that Draco looks like Harry hung the moon whenever he talks about him, to anybody who’ll listen to him. I find that their contract is highly useless."
"She was good. I changed her diaper, fed her, and she kept me company while I made breakfast."
Harry's face drops a bit.
"I don't bite you know." Inferno tells Harry in a deep, seductive tone.
"I have something to tell you." Seamus says.
"I want to." He says, helping her get on the bed.
“It’s Hermione.”
"Get out of here you crazy youngster. Good luck bro." Ron replies, also putting his thumbs up.
"Wow."
Draco simply shrugged, feeling completely miserable for keeping a secret from his best friend.
“Sure your not.” Hermione says dismissing his comment.
"Hi!" Draco greets happily.
Draco is fiddling with his hands in hesitation, and Harry can see the wheels in Draco's head turning.
"Thanks, Ron, but I'm fine. I can get home on my own."
Draco tries to get back into his book.
Here's Draco's Realization, Y'all!! So, This Chapter Is A Dream Sequence Y'all. Bear With Me Cause I Think It's A Bit... Predictable.
Nothing.
As Draco finished dressing her, Tori stopped crying, smiling a little bit as she moved her arms at the sound of her father’s voice.
"Oh, that’s ok. I think I could actually be friends with her once I look past the fact that she can seem like a…somewhat silly and sentimental girl."
"Are you alright?" Harry asked the blonde as he placed the mug in front of the man. "Do you need to go to the hospital or something?"
"You do look cute in it."
Ron arrived at Hermione’s house in fifteen minutes time, and he was proud of the feat. It had been just over a year since he had been in a relationship with anyone and he was striving to make a good impression on Hermione. He examined himself in the rearview mirror, popped a mint in his mouth, grabbed the fresh bouquet of flowers that sat in his passenger’s seat, exited his car and walked towards Hermione’s front door.
This Is Another Back In The Day Chapter.
Draco frowns slightly as he follows Neville through the mall.
"Let's see. There's trust, love, honesty, companionship, respect......"
"Thanks."
"You're going to be a very good baby today, aren't you?" He asked his daughter, who simply smiled at him and kicked her legs.
"Me either. I love you Harry James Potter!" Draco says, rubbing his nose with Harry's nose.
"Ha-ha." Hermione fake laughs.
"Okay, carry on."
"Ernie!"
"I sure did, Blondie. I can't believe I finally got to hang out with Ron tonight after so long. What other secrets are you hiding from me,
"She's mingling with the other guests."
"Are you sure? I mean, really sure about this? What if she stresses you out or-"
"Harry's leaving." He bluntly tells Ron. "And I'm fucking mad at you."
"I’m sorry about her." Ron says.
"No, thanks." Draco says.
"Awesome, I- oh! I gotta go! I'll see you soon." Ron said as he hung up.
"I do." He honestly responds.
"Alright, one peck and one peck only."
"Alright, Tori. We're going to do a little bit of exercising." Harry says picking up Tori, who was currently gurgling. "You're gonna have your own tummy time while I have my own time, ok?" He asks, kissing her forehead before placing her on her little, plump purple pillow.
"It could have been amazing if Ron would stop eating." Hermione says as she hits Ron's arm with her book.
"Welcome to Casa De Potter." Draco heard.
"That sounds good.”
It’s all or nothing.
The answer to all of the questions that I asked myself had been one answer: Yes. It was an easy answer really because they've always pushed and supported me when I felt like giving up. They are the best support system that I could ever ask for, and I wouldn't trade that for anything in the world. Harry, you've always made me feel attractive and that's something that I thought I had a long time ago, but you've managed to change to change my perception on things. On top of all of that, spending time with anyone of you makes me feel so good because it feels like home.
Harry chuckles as Draco is still eating strawberries.
"New York."
Another rule I love to live is to
"Then Mac and Cheese it is. What kind of wine shall we have with our food?"
"Isn't she precious?" Harry asks before he hands her Draco before grabbing her small stuffed animal.  "I never thought that having a baby would be so fun, you know?"
"Are you sure that this is a good idea? I mean, I don't want you getting hurt or-"
"So, you know how it's Halloween this month?" Harry asks Draco as he wags his eyebrows.
"Oh, stop it. Stop it!" Hermione gushed as she smiled at Tori who continued smile at Hermione as Draco out A pacifier in Tori's mouth.
"Really?" Draco asks as he's wiping his tears away that fell when Blaise was talking to him.
"You know."
"And the burger for the cute and handsome, young man." Luna says with a pretty smile while giving Harry his food.
“You do? What is it?” Draco asks his friend.
"You're making me hate him." Ron replied playfully, shocked that he wasn't catching on to all the sarcasm he's been throwing for the last few minutes.
There’s a black guitar hanging on the wall along many paintings on a Thai tea colored walls.
"Thanks." Draco responds.
Once he's done, he puts his clothes back on and kisses Ernie on the cheek.
"You really want it?" He repeats, teasing her with his dick.
"No problem.
Harry laughed a bit.
"Awesome. You ready?" Harry asks him.
"Oh yeah, babe. I'm gonna- I'm gonna-"
“Next time, could you see to it that I’m awake whenever you decide to fuck me?”
“Oh yeah!” Harry moaned loudly.
"Anytime." Draco says smiling at the other man.
"Fine. But you only get one chance to do so, Malfoy. Talk."
As Harry got into the staffroom, Hermione was waiting for him.
“Well, right now, I’m a little bit scared. I mean, I haven’t had a relationship like this last this long in the past ten years, with anyone romantically and to tell you the truth Sirius, I’m totally nervous because sometimes it fells too good to be true. The longest relationships I ever had with someone else both lasted a month and a half, and it terrifies me because-” He tells his godfather sounding unsure of himself.
"Sorry, it just- Harry, getting '
statement is crazy!" Draco tells him.
“You- going to my goddamn house ringing my motherfucking buzzer? Talking about me being someone’s ideal
which is damn good.” Harry and Ron state in unison with a smile.
"That's because you don't know Draco at all. He's a really nice guy." Harry said as he playfully hit Blaise on the arm with his rag before going to the staff room with the rest follow him. "He doesn't even want any of my money. In fact, he gets upset when I buy things for Tori."
"Well, in that case, let me turn up the heat." Draco said seductively. He took out his phone and resumes the song that was playing on his phone. He proceeds to sing it and gives Harry a lap dance.
"Say cheese, you hot, sexy, specimen." Draco says flirtatiously, while holding Harry's phone up.
"I just don't think that he sees me in that way at all.” Harry says dejectedly. “I mean, I know what he’s been through, and I’ve proved to him that he is capable of being in love, admitted that I want to be with him, but I think he’s still scared. I keep hoping that things will change, but I doubt that’ll ever happen.”
"Really?"
“I love you more.” He says, peppering Harry's face with kisses.
"Don't forget to use the gifts I gave you. If you need more, I can bring some over tomorrow. We can't have you being bent over by Inferno and not enjoying your toys." Draco smirks, even though he's feeling lonely.
"Stop what?"
"Draco has something very important details that he needs to tell you, Harry." Hermione tells him.
"Morning!" Harry chirped, making Draco want to smack and kiss the man at the same time. "Are you alright?
Harry simply smiled as he made a right onto his street, feeling happy to be home.
"I’ve already had this discussion with Sirius already, so I’ll tell you what I told him. I need to do this for me. I have literally given all of Los Angeles the best of me and it's officially time to move on with my life. I need to go and explore other aspects of this business and explore my own avenues as well. Please, trust me on this." He pleads with Hermione, and she sighs.
"Nope. This is way more fun. Besides, it must be my clingy date." He says as he is kissing Draco’s neck.
Tori just stares at him as she in cuddled up on the couch with a new, big teddy bear.
coming up." Harry says while putting the disc into the player.
"Well, it's great. It feels like you're on top of the world and you feel invincible." Draco answered as he started to lie down on the pull out bed. "It's amazing to have someone that you'll love unconditionally, no matter what. I think that's one of the best highlights I can tell you right now.
"Does someone have some emotional baggage from a past relationship?" He asks Ron.
"Damn, I hate you." Harry says, with a scowl on his face.
"Of course I am! I'm truly lucky to have you around so that you can buy the best TV movies on DVD. Besides, that one dude from
Draco thinks to himself.
"What's wrong?" He asks while Draco is scrambling to get out of Inferno's bed.
"No need." Draco says. "But just know I am proud of you."
"More like a week or two. You cook too much sometimes." Draco says with a smirk on his face. "I'll leave the food in your fridge and I'll come back another day so that we can tackle the food. Besides, everyone but me is busy tonight."
“Well, I just broke up with the latest one.” Hermione states. “What is wrong with men?”
"I'm uh- This shirt is so comfy and it's a good size on me." Draco says.
"Hermione-" Harry starts as he looks up at her taking a break from his legal briefs.
"Do you really want to know?" Justin asks.
“Harry, I’m gonna cum, so don’t stop what you’re doing.”
"You're like Mr. Deeds or something, you know that?"
"Get home safe, Draco." Ron tells him.
"Alright. What are you in the mood for, hot stuff?"
"Sirius." An irritated Draco starts.
Harry lies on top of Draco and starts kissing him.
Harry gets cutoff by the sound of Draco’s alarm on his phone.
"You too." Ernie says. "You're handsome."
"I would, but I don't think you'd want to eat burned bell peppers." Harry says rushing off to the kitchen.
"Sorry." Harry said as he took out his keys, clearly embarrassed about what just took place.
"No." Draco answers looking at his phone. "It's Ernie."
He looks at the phone and it's a picture of Draco.
"It's only a few hours, besides Tori is in good hands with Hermione, Ron, Neville and Blaise."
"OPEN THIS DAMN DOOR, MALFOY!" Ron bellowed as he was banging on the door. When Draco didn't open the door, he simply used the spare key that Draco gave him and entered the house. When he stepped inside, he spotted Draco in the couch, passed out clutching a bottle of wine.
Ron sighed as he shook his head. He was tempted to take a picture  on his phone to show it to their coworkers and Hermione, but he decided against it. Besides, he'd probably show it to Draco later on, but strangely enough, he didn't have it in him to kick his best friend while he was down. He picked up a pillow that was on the ground, and he hit Draco in the face with it.
“Justin just slipped out the door with another man holding hands.” Harry says sadly.
"Come on, Ron. She doesn't need hear a grown man yelling. She's still fragile." Blaise said.
For about half the night, they were sitting and drinking wine since their food wasn't ready yet.
Neville sings the song as well, trying to dance like Paula Abdul.
"Well I for one, am happy that I stayed back."
“Hey, Sirius! How are you, you beautiful soul?”
"There's uh....more." Draco says, but he gets cut off by Harry.
, and then went to sleep.”
At this point, Draco turns and stared at his little three month old daughter moving around happily in her swing, cooing at the stuffed animal hovering above her.
"I think she's taking a liking to you. I'm jealous."
Hermione giggles as Ron pouts. "I'm Hermione, Ron's friend." She offers a hand to shake and the girl takes it with a grin.
"No, it won't cost too much." Harry reassured him causing Draco to nod at him.
"What? I'm confused. Run this by me one more time." Ron said as he put his sandwich down. "Why didn't you tell Harry what happened the other night with that asshole?"
Harry was currently moving around the coffee shop as he cleans up the dirty tables, making sure that there wasn't any trash under the tables. He really loved his job at the coffee shop and he considered it one of his best jobs ever aside from watching his best friend's two children. He loved hanging around his friends, drink coffee on the job (who favored him and his best friend Hermione), and kill time when business was slow. If you were to ask him, Harry would say that his life was great, however, he was a single man. Hermione and a couple of his other friends would tell him that he was easy-going, and that they would take advantage of him.
Draco on the other hand, grinned as he snapped pictures of his daughter smiling widely, moving her arms around happily.
"Hmm... I could definitely go for the Mac and Cheese." Draco responds.
"That's what everyone says, but I always settle for less. I thought that he was different, but I was clearly wrong. When I told him that I was pregnant, he was so happy, but by the end of my pregnancy, he was distance. When she was born, he acted as if she didn't even exist. All he did was cheat on me, drink and did who knows what. I didn't even care taht he cheated on me as I was going to break up with him, but he did that to me in the most shittiest way possible. It sucks that I always find my heart in pieces in the grass because of dumbass people, you know?"
"That's right." Hermione says as she shakes Draco’s hand.
"You have no idea how much I want to." Inferno says.
"My pleasure."
"Enough with the bad puns." Draco laughs as Ron starts driving.
Once he’s on his knees, Draco teases Harry’s hole with the tip of his cock.
"Got it."
Harry opens, then closes his mouths two times.
"So how's your current hookup going?" Harry asks.
Ron shakes his head.
Hermione thinks to herself as she watches Draco’s cheeks turn red.
Harry smiles.
"I want you to meet my parents."
"Call us when you get home." Hermione Says.
"Here's to us." He says lifting his glass.
"Goodnight." The guys said.
"Weee!" Ron says, and Tori moves her hands, gurgling happily. "Hermione, can we have a baby?"
“Ahh.” Harry moaned contently.
"Well, aside from that kiss, I had a good time." Ron says. "I gotta run."
“Before we burn it, can we say the contract to each other?" Harry asks.
"I think you mean the love of his life, Neville." Blaise told him. "I think you should get it right before Harry kills you."
"What?! No! Don't be ridiculous! I'm just shocked, that's all." He denied.
"He has a hickey?!" A jealous Draco’s asks.
horrible! I can see why guys would
that about him."
He collapses on the bed as his come hardens and dick softens. The vibrator is still on, nudging insistently at his prostate, but Harry only turns the power down to low, enjoying the sensations and subtle feel it has to offer. It's nice, okay, especially when he's pretending it is Draco’s cock. He's smiling blissfully in the dark, sleepy and content with fantasizing Draco and him in sexual context.
It goes quiet for a few moments.
"What's going on, Potter?" Draco says, rubbing at his eyes as he saw his baby girl on her pillow, cooing loudly at her toy.
"We're not in a movie. What do we do now?"
“That sucks.” Harry supplies.
"Hey, Draco." Harry says in a sad tone.
"Are you sure?"
“Well, I took your advice and I'm out on a date."
“But-”
"Thank you." A blushing Draco said as Harry pushed him in before sitting across from him.
Draco simply looked away with a smile on his face.
"Really?"
"Now, I'm off to comfort Harry." He says grabbing his keys as he leaves his house.
"Yeah, because we know you." Neville says, causing Blaise to chuckle.
"Don't spoil her." Draco said with a smile on his face.
"What would you like to drink?" Harry asked the shivering man.
“Of course.” Draco says. “Now, sit on my face so that I can eat you.”
“See you in a bit.”
Harry chuckled and came out of his room. "Would you like a drink?"
"Thanks, Draco. I'm really lucky to have a friend like you." He tells him with a smile on his face.
"Something like that." Harry answered. "I actually have something to tell you both."
“You know what?” Draco says several minutes later. “I need you on your knees, babe.”
"Yeah, but that was too fast."
"Boys really suck sometimes." Draco says almost three hours later in the empty coffee shop. Within those three hours, Harry found out why Draco was walking in the freezing, cold rain with his two month old daughter. His ex-boyfriend had kicked them out of their apartment for reasons that Draco didn't know, and when Draco went back to the apartment an hour later, Draco's ex was gone. The only thing that Draco knew was that his ex had left him a note saying that he didn't care for him nor their baby.
“Yes.” Harry moaned as Draco placed his forehead on Harry’s forehead, looking into his eyes. They continued to kiss as Draco kept up his thrusts for a good while.
"Thank you!" They replied.
, and Ron is drinking Grey Goose with a splash of Pom.
“What’s wrong with me?”
"Yeah?"
"Ugh, this is so fucking frustrating. It been days, shit weeks, since I've tried to fix things with Harry, but he's just not listening to me anymore." Draco tells Luna as he is currently moping in Ron's house.
“Take off your clothes.” Draco says as he pulls away from Harry.
"Who's my little girl?" Harry asks as he kisses Tori's chubby cheeks. "Who's my little cutie pie?"
"Maybe you'll work something out with Harry." Ron tells him, and Draco nods in agreement.
He has been so sarcastic to everything, while Draco was being oblivious to the whole thing. Ron decided not to explain the absurdity of the situation at all because clearly, Draco didn't see it. It was as clear as day, and Draco had missed it, even when it was right in front of his face. It was clear to Ron that Draco didn't see it, and that he would never get it. What mad Ron sad was the fact that Harry spent so much time trying to show that Draco was capable and worthy of finding love. He's heard stories and even witnessed it himself, but he just didn't know what to do or say anymore.
"You should hear him talk about you. He's always mentioning you and Tori. He loves that little girl to death."
“Oh yes.” Harry moans as Draco is thrusting into him. “Fuck me.”
Both men continue to moan as Harry puts his head on the pillow.
"Anyway, I'm inviting the gang over."
It's been nearly 10 years later, and not much as changed. Harry is now a successful lawyer, who's still looking for Mr. Right. He might not look it with his glittery apron, but he is a rich man, who is completely modest about nearly everything in his life. He is ready to settle down, and live a life with someone who wants a quiet life with him.
"It's great, here. I promise." Ron says, bringing Hermione out of her thoughts.
"Exactly! Harry just wants to find his happy ever after. He just wants to be happy, and have someone to take care of and I just want him to be happy." Draco tells his friend with tears in his eyes.
"And don't forget the extra Honey BBQ wings!"
“Please, hear me out!" Draco begged as he felt his heart breaking. "I know what I did was wrong, but I thought that I would tell you-“
Draco nods as he took Tori out of her seat and put her on his lap.
"Well, in that case, let’s not drink anything strong. Let's just drink Harry’s favorite brand of wine, juice and water. Is that ok with you?"
He carries her to the bed and proceeds to kiss almost every inch of her body. As he gets to her clitoris, Ron looks up at her.
"You know I always have to call you when I'm in the middle of a hookup. I know it's your birthday and you're getting old, but you didn't forget already, did you?"
Draco didn't take the bait.
"Great, my friend. I had a meeting with some potential partners today."
Throughout the whole ride from the coffee shop to Harry's house, Draco had glanced from the window to his daughter several times.
"What? I was hungry." Ron said.
"Oh, babe. We go against the odds." Ron chuckles and Hermione finds herself joining in after.
"Like Harry as in "like-like" you know? Because he likes you too. "
"You asked Ron to tell me?" Draco asked.
“I just came in a little late.” Harry says in defense.
They take a sip of their respective drinks.
"What?"
"Red. It'll go best with the cake we’ll have later anyway." Draco says through his laughter while he retrieves wine glasses from the cupboard.
“Oh, Malfoy.” Harry moans as Draco throws him on the bed.
"I just want—" Harry tried to say. But then he cut himself off with moan. "Oooohhhhh yes!" Draco’s tongue had pressed inside of him, causing all thought to leave. He, in fact, did want this. "More!" he cried.
"Dammit!" Draco says. “What am I gonna do?”
Lavender rolls her eyes. "Okay, this way please." She guides them to a table for two with a lit candle and a small flower set on top. She takes out the reserved sign and gestures for them to sit. "Oh, and you better say hi to Dean. He'll be properly cross with you if you don't. Now, I will be back to take your order." She says before leaving.
Suddenly, Draco pulled out of Harry.
"Well, excuse me for being so flexible!" Draco grinned, grabbing his fork while wiggling his eyebrows.
"Ok, calm down. I'll call Sirius and see if he's seen or heard from him, alright? Hermione says, trying to calm Draco down.
"Drop your pants." She demands as she pulls her shirt over her head.
"Well, maybe this will cheer you up. Hermione is throwing a party and Harry will be there."
"I don't know. This usually isn't the way how it turns out." Ron says. "Anyway, I want to eat a good hot dog or get a couple pieces of pizza because yours truly is hungry. Speaking of which, have you eaten?"
"I guess the only way for that to happen would be for Harry to remove you from his life." Ron says.
"You look like me." He exclaimed and she squirmed with excitement as he spoke to her. "We should get a Christmas tree really soon, Draco."
Once they got to Draco's house, they decided to get a drink from the bar.
"What about you? Did you know about their contract?"
Every time someone would ask me if you were taken, or would ask me to hook them up with you, I would lie and say that we were together. Don’t ask me why, but it just came out so unexpectedly, and people would back off. I guess that should’ve told me something but I guess it had to take a contract to tell me that what we were looking for was right in front of us (well, right in front of me at least.)
"You knew that party was a going away party." Draco snarled. "I can't believe that you made me go to that party with my hopes being raised."
"I am one and you know it!" He snapped.
Seamus doesn't respond.
"Thanks buddy. See you soon." Harry tells him before disconnecting the call so that he can dry off and put some clothes on.
Suddenly, Neville appears next to him.
"Want to meet my friend?" He asks Ernie.
Ron sighed.
Ron looks at Hermione, giving her the choice.
"Are lips even desirable?"
The door opens.
"Stop!" Draco shouts as he runs into Harry's vehicle, stopping Harry's car.
Why? Tomorrow is never promised, so when I do something, I make sure that it makes me happy. When I enjoy my days spending time with you on the other hand, I enjoy it a lot more because you're there to experience the day with me. I get to spend my precious time with you in ways that I never do with Aunt May. I want to have Sunday dinners with you, and have a real life relationship with you because I need to cherish every single moment in my life with you. There are days that I am nostalgic about and those days are the best days I’ve ever spent in my entire life with someone. I will never forget those days as long as I live because you always manage to make my day a lot better and you always make me happier.
Harry rushes behind the counter and made a cup of cocoa for the young father. After a few moments, he had a big mug that was filled with hot chocolate with whipped cream on top with marshmallows on top with a spoon in the mug. As he was walking back towards the occupied table, Harry noticed the man hunched over in the chair, pushing his hair back with his hand.
"A room is a room, and it literally lasts forever."
"So what's the surprise?" Draco asked as he took a bite of the sandwich.
“Now, I’m gonna make you feel good, Potter.”
“No!” Harry says.
He takes as much of Draco's cock as he can, ending with his nose pressed flush against Draco's blonde pubes. Draco's dick is inching down his throat and Harry hums around it, loving the fullness of Draco's hard cock in his mouth.
"It's called working out, Malfoy."
"Sure." He says holding his arms close as Draco placed his daughter in Harry's arms.
"Which part?"
"Yeah, you always start off your stories like that, but I digress. Why exactly are you telling me this story, Draco? I mean, you're kinda kicking me while I'm down here."
"It's a bit to quiet in here." They say in unison.
Hermione gasped in realization.
"Fine."
' Draco thinks to himself before he says, "I'm so sorry about that, Harry."
"Hi. Is there anything else you want,
As Draco is on top of the birthday boy, Harry cups Draco’s face and kisses him gently after taking of the blonde’s button up shirt.
"Damn, you've really thought about my contract with Draco haven't you?"  Harry asked, amused by his friend's statement. "Plus, what makes you think that I want children?"
"Ok, I'm going to see what I can do for you guys!"
Take strolls at the beach late at night.
"Another one." Harry said once more.
"You know it. The night is still young and we still got tons of food to eat." He says before kissing Draco on both cheeks.
"How about we do something fun after the movie?" Draco asks.
Harry smiled at the two month old who was currently kicking her feet.
"I can honestly say that he's the most beautiful man I've ever met, who's kind, caring and great. He really brings out the best in me, and sometimes I feel that he completes me. Sometimes I feel like it's me and him against the world, you know? Like he's my one and only soul mate." Draco says without even thinking, sounding as if he is in love. "Well, it's a genuine hypothetical answer, isn't it?" Draco tells him, trying to sound normal.
"Shut up, Draco!" Harry blushes madly. "See ya tomorrow." Harry says, kissing Draco before he leaves the house.
ass time." Ron says.
"That's- I don't want you to waste your money. We're already staying here, and I think that's enough."
“I don’t know.” He desperately responds.
"But this is going to be very hard!" Draco whined. "I can't take it."
Draco smiles happily as he puts the dress in a little basket.
Draco nods as he watches Harry feed Victoria. He noticed that Harry was gentle with his daughter and in that moment he noticed something. Marcus never held their daughter like that, like she was wanted. He only held her when Draco forced him to.
Ron thought to himself.
"Maybe, maybe not, but it won't hurt to try and do something." Ron told him.
"Which is....?"
"No! I'll call you later!" Harry said in a cold tone, and hung up on Draco.
"Come on you guys. Let's get out of here. If we stay here too long, these two will rot our teeth! I believe they have some things to discuss with one another." Ron jokes.
"Please, don't make this any harder than it is for me Hermione. You've known for quite some time that I've been dying to get out of Los Angeles and go to the other side of the coast for quite sometime. The expansion of the company makes it the perfect time to do so!"
“Thanks for your help Ron. I really appreciate your help. I'll let you know how it goes." Draco says putting his thumbs up.
Draco smiled.
"I’m sure I will." Hermione says once he's completely hard. "Would you like an appetizer?"
Harry smiles, tickling Tori's feet which makes her giggle.
"Potter-"
"What am I doing? This isn't me at all. Honestly, I don't even know why I agreed to this. I've got to delete this, immediately. I’ll just deal with Draco’s consequences when I tell him that I deleted my account."
Thank God for Draco.
See, when I was three, I met someone who became my very best friend in the entire world. What I didn't know was how that friendship would....evolve into something much greater than that. We went through a shit ton of food, emotions, arguments, tragedies, boyfriends,
“Draco? What’s going on?”
"Hermione, thank you for inviting me. I'm honored to be here!" Draco says with a smile on his face. "It's good to see you again."
"Yeah. It’s the best idea you’ve had in years when it comes to me finding a man." A cheerful Harry tells him off the bat.
"Harry. He told me all about it, precisely nine years, and some months ago. Besides, he had Neville give me a copy of the contract." Sirius told him. "Besides, I didn't really see the need for you two to write that contract. You know, I never told you this, but I always approved of Harry being the one for you, since you two were hanging around here a lot a couple of years after college."
"Alright. So what'll she be?"
Harry smiles as he picked up the stuffed animal, slightly dusting it off. He looked up when the doorbell went off, wondering who it could be. He placed the teddy bear back on the couch before he walked towards the door. He then rubbed his eyes a little before he opened the door.
"I'm not mad about it anymore." Harry honestly states. "But I want to thank you for looking out for me. I'm no longer a
“Alrighty. Have a good one Harry.”
“Let’s go!” Draco says perking up.
"Don't worry about that, babe. I've got a plan all set up."
"Yeah." She moans. "Let me bend over so that you can spank me." She begs bending over. He compiles to her wish and spanks him.
"Do you know what's going on?"
, which is pretty damn good, if you ask me." Harry says.
"Jinx, you owe me a soda, Potter!"
"Screw it. Let's leave in about twenty minutes." Draco says as he's unbuckling Harry's pants.
“Beautiful.” Draco manages to get out through his moans.
"What? That made my day! Do you think he actually got screwed against Inferno’s bedroom wall?" Sirius says while wagging his eyebrows.
"Will you forgive me?" Draco asks his friend after a few minutes of silence between them "I'm just glad that you mean well."
"Well, I know that you and I are free tomorrow. So how about we set up the double date for tomorrow?" Ron asked Draco.
Draco sighs.
"Is it?"
While he was waiting for a smack or a scolding, it didn't come as Draco simply laid his head on Harry's shoulder, making Harry's insides jump with excitement. He only wanted Draco to be comfortable around him. He knows that they're taking it slow like a slow dance, so he doesn't expect anything from Draco now, and he's absolutely fine with that because all he wan't to do is love him like he truly deserves.
“I forgot how big you are.” Harry whispers against Draco’s lips.
"Yeah. Tori works on tummy time and I got to work on my push-ups."
"Ron, oh Ron." He hears as she buries her fingers in his hair.
"Yeah they do, but my friends are very protective of me because of it."
Draco stalls.
"How come?"
"Come on in! Let me give you a beer."
He can't stop fantasizng about Draco at all.
"Give me your phone. You wanted to find a man, and I've got the perfect idea."
"If you say so." Draco answered with a smile on his face.
"Can you give Hermione a smile, baby girl?" Draco asked as he played with the little booties on her feet, causing her to smile at Hermione.
"Cheers, buddy." Clinking his beer against Harry's drink.
"Oh. That's awesome." Draco tells Harry, hoping that he doesn’t sound disappointed.
"Not that, you dumb fuck! The pity party of the year that you're having! It's been going on for way too long now!"
"You should probably get that." Draco tells him.
Harry gags, making Draco giggle at him as people were glancing at them when they passed them by.
“Yeah, Malfoy?
“Fucking prick.” Inferno says on the other side of the door.
"Why did you fuck me while I was asleep?" Draco asked when they woke up a few hours later.
Harry moves to sit on Draco’s face.
Still no answer.
"It's 1:16."
"You are?"
"Is this.... too much? I mean, the Mac and Cheese, German Shepard's pie, Red Velvet Cake, wine and the whole ambiance, is awesome but do you think that it's-"
"You weren't going tell me anything and you know it! Someone else told you to tell me! You know what you can do, Malfoy? Take your ass back down to this guy's house, since you have to have everybody's man! What the fuck do you think this is? So I guess you think you're cute now right? You’re a goddamn bitch. You should have kept your fucking mouth shut! Just because he gave you more attention than he gave me that night, you think you're something fucking special, Malfoy?! Fuck you and fuck him! God, I can't believe you! Just when I met a great guy, you- you know what? You aren't worth my time anymore."
"Oh, hush. They're taking their time to get to that point in their relationship." Hermione says as she plays with Tori's feet, making her squeal in delight.
"Well I always take a couple and then send them to my parents to see how she's growing."
"Fo' shizzle mi nizzle!"
"You are." Malfoy says as he rides his hard on out. “Just like the last time, babe.” Harry starts to feel giddy again.
"So, how did you and Goyle meet? If you want to tell me, I'm all ears, but you don't have to tell me right now."
"So, really, how'd you find this place?"
Tori simply gurgles at Harry.
Harry nods and kisses his cheek.
"Oh. That's fine.” A crestfallen Inferno says to him. “We'll just talk or whatever." Inferno says able putting on his shirt back on.
Harry licks beneath the foreskin, around the head of Draco's cock as he bobs his head up and down, hollowing his lips to suck on the knob. Below him Draco is restless, though still asleep, alternating between whimpers and quick breaths. Harry smiles around Draco's cock as he uses a hand to pull Draco's foreskin down and suck him properly.
"What?"
"Alright, baby. You do that while I do some push-ups."
“You’re amazing.” Harry says after they are spent.
"Are you serious?"
"Really?"
"You are supposed to be sleeping, Princess." Draco told his daughter as he took her from Neville's arms and peppered her face with many kisses. "Thank you, Longbottom, but where is Hermione?"
"Great." He says sarcastically.
"I don't think you should do that on a first date." Hermione teases.
“Well…..”
"I love this boy but don’t worry about me because he's like a brother. He's a great guy. He would never play with your feelings like that. But if he does, I will hunt him down."
"Huh?"
"It's because you're here." Harry says, leaning in to kiss Draco.
Body and Dinner Plans
"Aww, Draco." Ron sympathizes with Draco.
“Take that cock, Potter.” Draco says.
“Oh, Harry.”
Draco forces a chuckle. “We practically live there. Sure I’ll meet you there at about……8:30 tonight?”
"Ah, finally something that I've done in a long time to turn you on. Score one for the blonde boy! Like what you see?" Draco taunts.
Hermione nods. "Okay, I'll trust your judgement then."
“And remember how you told me about your friend Hermione?”
"Where is he?" She asks herself, worried.
"Yeah." Draco said as he put Tori's diaper on.
Fanfiction."
He stops, puts the mirror down and leans back in his seat as he looks at his friend, impressed with her words.
"Ron, you don't have to-"
Potter?" Draco asks his best friend.
Name.
"Shh, I'm thinking." Justin says as Ron stands Tori on her feet.
Hermione smiles at the waiter, "Yes, please."
"Haha! She likes me better than Harry!" Ron teases.
"Look, just to dinner and have a talk with Harry. I think I’m wasting both of our time by being here, doing….this." Draco tells Inferno as he waves his hand between the both of them.
As getting home, Harry checked the time and noticed that it was 7:56, which is almost an hour later than he anticipated. They had been standing near the front door for the better part of three whole minutes when Harry decided to stand on his tippy toes, moving in for a kiss. Draco on the other hand, wasn't sure if he should back away or not as he didn't want to kiss Harry yet. Finally, he moved his head so that Harry's lips met his cheek.
"Thank you so much, Sirius! Bye!"
Draco laughs softly.
“Aww.” Harry coos.
Be his hero and strength. Anything he needs, I will be there for him.
"Ron, I really think that I should have called him." A dejected Draco told him as they were out in Nevada.
"Good choice." Ron says. "And I'll try one of the things new on the menu, um - pan-seared salmon?"
"What's wrong?" Harry asks.
"I'm ready." Draco said as he grabbed his bag that had both his and his daughter's things.
"Thank you for being a shoulder to cry on." Draco says. "I'm sorry that I got your shirt wet."
"Well, it helped that you have unique sense of style." Draco said with a smile on his face.
"Your wish is my command." He tells her, as he enters within her. They both moan in unison.
Harry considered kissing Draco at this moment in time, but he decided against it. He ate his sandwich and heard Tori squeal in total delight at the toys.
"Good, because I like you're smile too."
, fell asleep, took a shower, and-"
"So I was at work and it was raining badly when Draco came into the shop with his daughter."
Draco waits a moment before he starts moving.
Draco smiles like crazy enjoying this moment.
I hope you receive this
Neville's eyes widened.
"May I get a Corona, please?" He asks the bartender, while placing a $5 bill on the bar.
"See you later, Ron."
is in there and he’s fucking hot on-"
"That's great! I'm so proud of-"
"Yeah." Draco says quietly.
Ron simply sighs.
"Working out?" Draco says as he leans against the banister as Tori stuffed the toy in her mouth.
"Careful, I don't want you drunk on our first date." Ron warns playfully.
"Potter, why are you so tempting?"
"I won't hurt you."
"Well, I'm small."
Rex barked.
"Harry, Harry, Harry." Draco starts. "These boys will help you find a man. Besides, that bar has four of my favorite things."
"That's shocking."
"Happy 35
Harry shook his head and took a seat at a table with a candle in the middle of the table, raising an eyebrow. Internally, he's hopping that his friends didn't set him up on a blind date. The last time he did that, he ended up with a guy who ate like a ferocious animal, played with his food, spit food into Harry's drink, make a hat with the napkin and put on Harry's head, ordered a cake and proceeded to eat the whole cake with his hands.
Tori's head lifted a bit before she resting her head on his chest once more as she was sucking on her pacifier.
Draco arrives at Hermione's house with a 24 pack of Heineken. "I can do this." He tells himself before stepping into the house.
is really good!"
"How's this one?"
birthday. The picture is of a cake covered Harry and a pristine Draco are standing with their backs together, making goofy faces at the camera.
“Ooh, you’re gonna love this.” Hermione says with glee.
Hermione sighs.
"Thanks. I'm going to look for her."
Harry sighs as he thinks about what Hermione said. He does play a ton of love songs when he meets someone in the office.
Draco makes sure that he fixes Tori's little outfit.
“Because you’re the husband.” Ron automatically supplies, very nonchalantly.
"Didn't you say that you got over your fears of spiders?" Neville asked.
“I told you that Harry would be fine.” Ron says.
"Yup?"
"Anytime."
"Two?"
“But what if he doesn’t forgive me?”
"Draco?"
“Harry, don’t stress yourself out, my boy. And stop doubting yourself, James. I’ve seen you grow from a little boy to a marvelous young, good looking man, Harry. Honestly, Harry, anyone would be lucky to have you as their husband.” Sirius tells him, trying to calm his nerves.
"Well, you wouldn't mind if we got together and get to know him. I'll see if he's good enough for you or if he can leave. Are you happy with that?"
“So where the hell happened to you last night?” Draco asks.
Harry turns and Justin is walking out of the restaurant with another man.
"That was one second!"
Draco is fiddling with the shirt that he's wearing, compliments of Harry as his daughter is being pushed by Harry. At least he's wearing his own pants because Harry's pants were a tad bit to short on him. Now on the other hand, Draco was checking out Harry.
“Ugh.” Ron says as he rolls his eyes at him. “You really need to get out more and stop sleeping around.”
"Draco here took a picture of me, and he posted it on Grindr. At first I wasn't fond of the idea at all, because I wasn't comfortable with having a dating profile. After begging and pleading with me on trying to find someone to hookup with, I finally agreed to try it out. When I left his house, I decided to change into my pajamas, and stayed up for a while, just to look through Grindr. At first I was going to delete my account, until Inferno's profile popped up, asking if I wanted to hookup. I decided why not go for it, and I went to his house."
"Not a chance.” Draco says trying not to blush.
"Hermione says that you're invited. Harry is going as well." Ron tells his friend, hoping he'll go to Harry's going away party.
Harry wipes his lips as Draco takes a deep breath. They lean in and one second later, Draco pulled away.
until their contract is due. No questions asked!”
"She's definitely a cheeky little girl." Harry said.
"I know, Draco. You're lucky I got this movie today." Harry teases Draco.
"Thank you!" Ron and Hermione respond as they blush like crazy.
"If it'll shut you up, then I will."
"Just remember, no matter what happens, no matter where life takes us, just remember that I love you." Draco says. "Food, here we come!"
“That’s a promise.” Draco says as he kisses Harry.
all because an ex of his cheated on him with someone who was a carbon, wannabe copy, of a cheap ass model. Fuck 'em.
." He repeats, while Sirius laughs uncontrollably.
"Inferno, I'm so sorry about that. That was my friend who called just now."
"Your baby is really adorable." Harry says causing Draco to smile.
“A German Shepard and a Boston Terrier.” Harry answers coyly. “Where are you anyway?”
"Wow."
"This was a great dinner." Seamus says.
Harry frowns as he was looking around the dimly lit coffee shop, running his hand on his leather jacket. Hermione made him shower, put on some nice clothes and drove him to the coffee shop.
series in a different way that Ron and I have seen." Draco responded with a blush on his face.
"Alright you can stop smiling now, Potter." Draco said as he turned his attention back to his book.
"You are so cute! So what's your name?" Hermione asked as Tori was smiling her.
Harry pecks him.
"Great! Now, lunch is in a little while, so I'll be back in a few minutes." Harry said.
"I want so many things. As stupid as this may sound, I want all types of hate to be over. I never thought that I would see the day where I would say this, but, I want quiet days and loving days. I want to have kids, eventually. I want to hold someone in my arms when he's depressed. As for Harry, I just love putting a smile on his face. I love when he hugs me from the back. I love that he gives me massages when I'm stressed or feeds me when I'm sick. I love holding him in my arms and feeling like it's me and him against the world. I love that he gives me something to believe in when I'm feeling down. I love how he can tell you or do things without actually saying the words ‘I love you’ on a regular basis. He’s just so… he’s amazing. His mind is beautiful."
"I'm not trying to be." Draco said with a huff.
"Enjoy." She says.
"Ah, yeah. You won't regret it." Draco cheers as he steps towards Harry, unbuttoning Harry’s pants. “And I know that you won’t regret this either.”
"A surprise. Just walk and talk with me, Malfoy." Neville says as he dragged him to an apparel store.
“Ok.” Harry says getting of Draco’s cock, giddy that Draco called him babe.
Draco lets out a string of curse words as Harry’s mouth is on his balls.
"Sirius!" Draco says all scandalized.
Harry just basks in the silence.
“And what about you?”
“Aw, yeah! Go-Go bar, here we come!” Draco cheers. “Now, I hope you are ready for round two because you’re a huge turn on for me.”
"I'll go find something." Luna says, walking towards their friend’s kitchen.
"Aww, don't be." Harry said with a grin on his face. "Nothing can compare to her amazing father at all."
Hermione starts squealing.
"I do." The blonde says. "I need to take my mind off of things for a while."
"Hey, I'm not stopping you from finding it. I'm just happy being from one bed to he next, hooking up with a hot guy." Draco says happily.
Are you guys ready to order?"
"Two pizzas, coming up!" She says brightly.
"I don't want to be a burden, or-"
Ron didn't tell Draco about Harry's plans.
"Well, all I know is that he's probably left for New York already. We've looked everywhere." Draco says.
"I am." Hermione says. "Thank you for taking me here."
"Nothing's wrong." Draco tells him.
“Alright, Draco. It’s a date. I can’t wait to see you guys. Now, I don’t know about you, but I gotta get back to work.”
"Maybe we can do something tomorrow if you aren't busy?" Draco asks. "I am dying to see
He licks Harry’s nipples, Adam’s apple and when Harry is about to open his mouth so that Draco can lick into his mouth, Draco licks Harry’s lips before licking his nipples once more, causing Harry to pout a bit.
“Draco.” Harry warned once he was getting close a few minutes later after Draco’s slow and sensual bobs.
Draco whimpers as they are kissing because he enjoys Harry’s touch that is currently tingling through his body. He enjoys Harry running his hands all over his torso, arms and the soft touch on his neck.
I'd love you to love me
"I concur." Draco replies while they step back into the bar.
"I know, but at least let me do this one thing for you."
"Harry, you're very sweet, but no."
Draco is in shock while Ron is waiting for Draco to make his decision.
*Sigh* So... Who's Pissed After Reading This Chapter?
Suddenly, Draco feels weak when Harry says New York.
"Which is....?"
"No."
Draco looks up from patting Tori's back, burping her, hums in response.
Now, Harry guessed that he had been lying to himself for years, thinking that he and Draco had something special. Somewhere along the way of their friendship, he just fell in love with Draco, and he didn't even know how it happened. All he knew was that he fell in love with him quite sometime after they made their contract, but he couldn't pin point when exactly. Since then, Harry secretly wished that Draco would love him the same way that he loved Draco, but at last, it wouldn't happen. The idea to be a happy couple was squashed.
"Good." Draco said.
"Yeah, right." Draco snorts.
“Ready?” Harry asks as he settles on Draco’s cock.
Ron smiles at her. "Well, you told me you didn't like fancy restaurants and the typical date thing." He starts, "I'm trying to make a good impression here, and I agree with you so we're going to an old restaurant that serves the best homemade stuff, ever."
Harry gives his friend a puzzled look.
"Fine." Says Harry while writing the agreement.
"Fine. I'll talk to him." Ron says in defeat. He can't continue to live life like this. His relationship with Harry was built on trust and honesty. That was something that he wanted keep in this relationship for a lifetime no matter how scared he was. As soon as he was finished eating, he called Harry.
Harry simply shakes his head fondly at his friend as he chuckles.
"Yeah, and we can even teach Tori how to swim when she's big enough so she can play in it."
in bed." Draco says angrily. "That Inferno knew how to take care of him in ways that no one has ever known how to, and he made Harry feel very loved." Draco says in a single breathe. "He literally said "
"Well, remember when I went over to your house with food and beer, the other day?"
"No, but I wish I had!" Draco honestly tells him through his laughter. "Thank you for the idea though. Maybe I'll tell them to give you another type of shot."
"Reminder, everyone is coming over today."
You’re a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Your mind is beautiful, your body is so…..mouth watering, and that’s something that I never get tired of. I really want to share this life with you, and protect you as Draco Malfoy, the blondie in your life. I love thinking about you on hours on end and I am willing to do anything for you.
"My pleasure." Harry said. "Since the others are staying over tonight, we're probably going to watch a movie or some tv. Care to join us?"
"What your favorite part about it?"
"Guys, Tori is sleeping." Luna said quietly.
Draco nodded his head as he took off his shoes, placing them on the mat by the door. Ince his shoes were off, he then took the car seat out of the stroller, took Victoria out of it and proceeded to take off her little jacket.
“But-”
Seamus takes a few cheese sticks from the platter.
"Fuck, that was good." Ernie pants.
"I don't know how to repay you."
How they became friends?
Harry internally sighed.
Draco opens his eyes and he shuts his alarm off.
“Well don’t blame me.” Hermione says. “I’m just working on my future maternal instinct skills.”
"You're such a child."
“Yeah.”
"I know. I can tell."
“It's nice to finally see you again." Harry says. “This is my best friend, Hermione.”
"No, we wasn't, Harry. Please, trust me.” Draco says, sounding hesitant. “Thank you." Draco tells the bartender.
“Oh, don’t cry my little munchkin. You’re too pretty to cry.” Draco said as he was sliding Tori’s yellow sweater on her arms as she was wailing. “You look pretty, my baby girl.” Draco said as he was kissing her little button nose. “You’re my little princess, right? Aren’t you my little princess?”
"Great minds think alike." Sirius tells him. "Vegetable lasagna it is."
"Aw, Tori would you like this?" Harry asks as Draco hovers over the babbling baby. She looks at the dress and simply stares at it before smiling. "I think she likes it."
Neville thinks to himself. "Yup. Aren't you lucky that you're going to be a bachelor for life?"
Hermione nods.
Hermione was trying so hard to get Harry’s attention, but she was as baffled as to why he ignored her advances. One night after a long shift at the office during their first year as an official employee at
"I guess this date is going well." Harry says. "Over a whole hour has passed and no food."
"Because I was supposed to be out of there at 4, but my friend really needed the help." Harry said. "Besides, had I not stayed, I wouldn't have met you or this little cutie pie."
"Yup, you know it." Neville said as they walk to the dance floor to dance.
"That sounds awesome, but I don't really feel like being around anyone else today." Draco tells her ruefully
"I know you're tired of all this, but please hear me out." Draco begs Harry.
He licks them before scraping his teeth against one of them as Draco's legs move to wrap around his waist and push him back in.
"Likewise, Harry."
"Then Harry proceeded to tell us that Inferno such a good kisser." Draco says with venom in his voice. "How his kisses are very
"Sure."
"And we'll take care of Tori." Neville says.
“See, I think that when you’ve found someone, you can spend the rest of your life with them, you know what I mean?” Harry asks.
"Malfoy, why are going a Go-Go Bar? I doubt I'll find anyone to date there." A miserable Harry states.
"Let's go, Malfoy!"
well. I have good news I have to share with you and I think you'll love it. I hope you're ready for it because I'm excited to share it with you. First I have to tell you something that happened between my best friend and I.
"So, how do you feel about what happened with Harry last night?"
"I can't wait to have that because it sounds wonderful." Harry said.
"I like when you look me in the eyes. When you try to avoid my eyes, makes me sad." Harry says as he caresses Draco's chin.
"I promise you that if they do something wrong, then you have permission to kill me with your bare hands."
“Then take your blonde colored hair, gray eyed, skinny ass over there again, and work this out. Knock his door down if you have to.”
"Well where is Draco? We'd like to meet him."
“It’s my birthday, Malfoy.” Harry reminds him. “I can cry if I want to. Besides, I haven’t seen or heard from you all week, so this gift made my night.”
"I think I would love that.” Draco replies, kissing Harry on the neck.
"I don't understand." A confused Harry states.
"Three days." Draco repeats, still in shock. "Where are you going?"
"Since I have spare rooms, Tori can stay in one of them."
Malfoy chuckles, but nonetheless, he complies with Harry’s wish.
birthday, I think that this occasion calls for a toast.” Harry says as he raises his glass. “Here’s to us for dating each other for three years.” He says.
"Thanks." Draco says trying to smile at Hermione.
"You heard him, Ron. He met some guy off of Tinder, had sex all night and showed up later to work. If I know him as well as I think I do, then Harry is smitten with Inferno."
"She was born July 26th at 2:47 in the afternoon. She loves to look at her reflection, snuggling, and sleeping."
"That's crazy, Malfoy. You need someone to take care of you." Harry responds after pulling away from the kiss.
“Ok. Bend over sweetheart.” Harry whispers in Draco’s ears. Draco complies. He lines himself up with Draco’s open hole, and slowly enters within him.
As Harry was going to pass out, he noticed that Draco was sleeping, making him smile a bit.
"What kind of appetite?"
“Well, what is it to you that he has a hickey? Ron asks as Hermione is trying not to laugh as Draco’s expression.
Lifting his head, Draco popped up between Harry’s spread thighs. "You want me to stop? I don’t think so." He dipped his head down once more and lavished Harry’s hole with his mouth.
"You know he's looking for the gold digger." Blaise said, causing Harry to glare at him.
"Are you positive about this?" His friend asks him, referring to getting home on his own.
"I'll have the……. grilled chicken pasta."
Draco leaned forward an he started to kiss Harry’s back and when Harry lifted his head, the blonde slightly turned Harry’s head and kissed him passionately.
"Are you sure, Malfoy?"
"Well, in that case, let's hang out tomorrow. Just me, you and a shit ton of food and watch a movie or two."
"Oh, that long huh? You're ditching me for Harry
"I'm off to make a sandwich. You want one?"
Back at Harry’s three bedroom house, Draco is carrying the birthday boy all the way to his room with their lips attached the whole entire time.
Draco stares blankly at him.
"Likewise." Draco said as he places several kisses on Tori's cheek. "I was born on June 5th 1980, this is my natural hair color, I love green apples, reading and creating looks."
“Aaaaahhhh.” Harry moans causing Draco to smile.
"Wait." Hermione says. "Before you say anything, I better call Draco to let him know that you're still alive."
"I know, Draco. You don't have to worry about me all the time. Like I told you before, I can take care of myself." He says wiping Draco's tear away.
Tori simply gurgled at him as Harry picked up the baby bag.
"From what Draco has told me, that is definitely true. Harry has had lots of bad luck trying to find
"Well, you've made my shift a lot easier. Four strawberry lemonades coming up!” Luna states.
"You're such a cutie." Draco says and Tori wrinkles her nose, smiling at him.
"I'm fine." The blonde responded. "Have you seen the hostess?"
"You see that? She's happy. Tori's practically telling you to have fun with me." Harry said as he took her out of the swing. He kissed Tori's chubby cheeks watching her react before he does it again several times as she giggles happily. Draco smiles as he watches them together. It has now been two months since he and Tori has stayed with Harry and it's been more than amazing. Harry was taking care of Tori like she was his own daughter and it made his heart burst with immense fondness because Harry has been attached to his daughter.
"Is there a specific reason for that?" Hermione wonders.
"She's so quiet." Draco said with a smile as he moved Tori's arms a little after he gave Tori her purple binky.
Draco rolled his eyes.
"Great! I've been dying for a beer since this morning."
"Hey there, beautiful." He says to the naked figure under the sheets.
Harry’s annoyed, but he finds that he wants to know what the blonde has to say.
"I'm sick of being under appreciated." Harry tells Draco.
“Get on your back.”
"I mean, I'm no fool at all. I am not one to be subtle, but I can't be that oblivious to miss out on the most perfect guy that has been brightening up my world for over well over a decade."
He lifts his gaze from the candle and his jaw almost dropped at the appearance.
"Ditto for me!" Ron says brightly.
"Is this a wall of shame?!" She asks in realization, now excited.
“I’m going to show you what real men do, bitch. See, you don't know what real motherfucking couples do, Draco! And FYI Draco, real motherfucking couples sacrifice! Your parents should have aborted your motherfucking ass! You’ve made me feel like I’m a worthless piece of shit! I bet your parents knew it when the doctors put you in their goddamn hands, that you weren’t a goddamn thing, but a fucking whore. And you’re going to have that pathetic look on your face, bitch?” Harry asks. “Get it off your fucking face!” He says while slapping Draco on the face. Draco falls down to the ground from the force of the slap that he has just received. The whole entire bar gasps at Harry’s sudden action.
"Harry, please, I know you're mad, but-"
"Thank you."
"Well, I can say the same about you, right?" Harry asks Draco with his head buried in the crook of Draco's neck, with the tears slowing down.
His distracted thoughts end when Draco tries to push down more on Harry's length, despite the fact he's already full and isn't relaxing. Since he's asleep, he has no control over his muscles, and can't will them to relax and take it easier.
She gasps.
Harry kisses the contract and Draco giggles.
“Thank you, Sirius. You really are the best. I think I’ll go shower now. I don’t want to look like a mess for Inferno, even though it feels so good.”
"Oooooh, finally to branching out then?"
“Sure thing, Draco. I’ll see you later.” Harry tells him before hanging up his phone.
A Date And A Sleepover.
' is. And that is a great name for a drink like this." Harry says while taking another drink.
“What did you do that for?” Draco pants. Harry wraps a hand around Draco’s dick.
“One martini, extra dirty, coming up.” The bartender says, before he scurries away from Harry.
Draco knew that Gregory Goyle wasn't going to be a good father the moment they found out that Draco was pregnant. He simply checked out and virtually ignored Draco for majority of the pregnancy. Since then, Draco vowed  to be everything that Victoria would need.
"I sure did."
"Well sue me for being aware of things."
"Let's go, Tori."
“Ah! Ngh! Gah! Oh my- Jesus-Fucking-Christ, Draco. This feels so good!”
It's officially Harry's last moments in his house, and he's looking around the empty living room. He spots the picture of him and Draco still hung up on the wall. He wants to leave it behind, but he decided to take it with him. He was actually sad to leave, but it was time for him to move on. He took the picture from the wall and put it in the last box that he had near the door before he picked up the box and left his house. He put the box in his car and sped off towards a new life, where new adventures were awaiting for him.
"That's sweet."
"Yes, I am. Could you trust me on this?"
Harry smiles.
“Yes! Yes!” Harry screams out loud as he throws his head back with his hands on Draco’s pecks.
Harry smiles making his eyes crinkle, and Draco decided not to smile back because he'd look crazy.
"Me too."
"Not tonight you aren't, got it?" Hermione asks and Draco laughs at Ron's crestfallen look.
“Malfoy!” Harry says flirtatiously as Draco pulled him into the bathroom.
He screams out of frustration. “Sorry.” He says when the bystanders look at him as if he’s lost his mind. “It’s now or never.” He says as he takes a deep breath and decides to walk towards the door.
"I wasn't worrying." Hermione says.
"I don't care if you were joking or not, but that wasn't funny." Harry snapped.
"But I am."
“Night, Draco.” Harry says pecking his cheek. “Thank you for an amazing 25
"Wait a minute, are you rich?"
As the kiss gets steamier, Harry is going crazy.
Draco's cock softens, just barely, but doesn't go down, and after spending a minute still sucking Draco off, even when Draco has already finished coming, he pulls off, noticing his own hard on. Harry frowns, just slightly, but then Draco's legs are spreading on their own accord and Harry's frown curls upward into a wicked grin, which gives Harry an idea.
"Don't worry about it. I got it."
Blonde hair and grey eyes.
"Night, Ron. I guess I'll be seeing you on...Monday?"
“I uh- I have a problem and I think you’re the best person to talk to about this.” Draco tells him. “Can we meet up later? I need to talk to you about something really important.”
No response.
"If I didn't know you any better Draco, I'd say that you are very jealous."
"You think that kissing me would change my mind?" A hysterical Harry asked him. “Did you honestly think that kissing me would achieve anything at all?”
“Yeah. Let’s go.” Draco says.
As Draco was asleep half an hour later, Harry started singing to him.
"Neville, you do realize that I'm not a Ken doll or something, right?" Draco says as he is watching his friend rush around the store grabbing clothes and accessories.
I can’t wait to sing our song to you!! I can’t wait to make sweet, memorable, passionate love to you with the song playing with some candles lighting our bedroom. I also can’t wait to sing
"No problem. I'll let you know if I find or hear of anything." Sirius told Hermione.
He really couldn't believe this at all.
"What? You know that I've been dying to see you get married. Draco seems like a good guy and you two look cute together. People would probably whip you as Drarry."
"Friend of the owners." Ron smiles, "it's been a while since I went there, I know the chefs there so we're in good hands."
"Alright." Draco said. "Her bottles are in the fridge, and if she gets hungry, just warm one up, but not too hot. Her diapers are in the bag by her crib, and if she cries, put her in the swing or play with her."
Hermione entered his office and paused the song that was playing.
cheated on me." Ron chuckled lightly.
"I think you're hookup name should be
"All is forgiven."
Draco smiles.
Draco looked down to see Tori smiling ath them.
“Hermione here said that you didn’t come to work today and she had us all worried.”
"After one hour?"
Sadly, Draco didn't notice it as he is staring at his hands.
Draco kisses him.
"My friend here likes the ladies." Draco tells him through his giggles.
Harry simply shook his head before he chuckled. As they stepped into the living room, they found Ron spread out on the floor with a big bag of Lays on his chest and fork with half a sausage on it. Blaise was currently on the couch cuddling with a throw pillow, laughing randomly in his sleep. Before Draco could ask what happened, Neville came out of the kitchen with Tori in his arms cooing at the baby who was eating.
Harry texted back.
“That mixed with a
Draco starts crying for another 10 minutes.
"Oh, no! No grandkids to take care of if Harry remains missing?" Sirius asks.
"I know." Harry responds cheekily. "Anyway, I was having a great night."
After a long day at the office, Harry finally got home at 8 pm, dead tired from all the cases he had taken care of for the past week.
"Yeah, I live in a huge house." Harry said. "You can stay as long as you need to until you are ready to see your parents."
"Well actually, there is another thing. Someone’s been getting a lot of smack-down, scream all night, bed-breaking, neighbor-banging-on-the-wall type of sex."
"As long as I get to do that for you as well." Draco said with a smile on his face as Tori started to coo loudly.
“Thanks.” Draco says running towards his car.
"Me too."
"What the-"
"Me too." Ron says as he kisses Tori's chubby cheeks.
"Tori left you a little thank you gift for all the clothes that you bought for her, Potter."
"In your dreams, Harry." Hermione says. "I'm in the mood for nachos. Hermione. what will you have to eat?"
." They both say in unison.
“Harry! Harry!” Draco shouts frantically on Harry’s house door. “Harry, where are you?!”
"That's fine. I'll do anything you want, ok?"
"Can you imagine me, Draco Lucius Malfoy, in a relationship with Harry James Potter, Ron?" He asked Ron. He was trying to wrap his head around that concept. In his head, it seemed ridiculous, but his heart was telling him something that he couldn't quite figure out yet.
"Do you ever stop eating?" Hermione asks causing Neville and Blaise to laugh hard.
Harry tilted his head a bit to the side in confusion.
"You know, you could still give her the world, and I could help."
Draco rolls his eyes. He is not the person who wants to be in bed at 10 pm, even if he has an early shift in the morning at the hospital.
Draco was about to accept as he typed
I need you to need me
"I need to go, now!" Draco says, putting his shirt back on. He has to leave now.
"I love kids. I always wanted to settle down and start my own family."
"Is New York really the answer as the key to your happiness?"
“Harder, Potter.” Draco moans.
"Hey, it's just one of those days!" He tells her.
"Where did you get wine from?" Draco asks. "I mean, this is a coffee shop after all."
I'm begging you to beg me
"I know you don't want to talk about Inferno right now, but anyone who is as stupid as him has the time to break up with you, are the worst people on earth. If they knew you like how I know you, they would adore you in a heartbeat. You are someone’s happy ever after." He tells Harry while untangling their hands to cup Harry's cheeks.
“Y-yeah.” He replies before he kisses Draco.
"No. Why do you ask?"
"You are crazy if you believe that." Neville said causing Blaise to laugh at the state that Draco was giving Ron.
"Great music, sexy male dancers and delicious drinks."
"Come on, Victoria. Let's go find your daddy a nice, warm blanket." Harry quietly told the baby that was in his arms. He smiled as she was cooing and buming her little fists against his chest. Harry opened the lenin closet, grabbing a nice, thick, warm blanket for Draco. Once he got the blanket, he closed the door with his foot and walked back into the living room. He dropped the blanket next Draco's sleeping figure and placed Victoria in her car seat. Once the baby was in her seat, Harry opened the blanket and covered Draco's sleeeping figure with it, placing a soft kiss on his forehead.
Draco shakes his head.
Draco starts to push hid tongue into Harry’s hole and Harry starts to writhe and whine like crazy.
"I must agree with that." Blaise says.
Harry wants to chuckle at it, but thinks in doing so would make him choke around Draco's length, and he's enjoying himself too much to let that happen. Instead, he laughs mentally at Draco's insistence, even in his sleep.
"Really?" Draco asks with a huge grin on his face.
“Goddamn, that felt good.” Harry says. “Best birthday ever.”
"We wanted to surprise you." His dad, James, said. "Can we come in?"
"Cheers." They say in unison, clinking their glasses together.
"I had fun tonight. Thank you." Draco tells them as he rocks his daughter to sleep.
"Sure." Draco says happily, knowing Damon well that he was going to drag his friend out to a gay bar.
Tori sates at Lily for a moment longer before she moves her fists, smiling at them.
"I can't do that to him. He'll think that I'm jealous and that I don't trust him at all." Draco says gloomily. “I’d never forgive myself if something bad ever happened to him. I mean, people only want to date him because of his last name! I just want what’s best for him, and support him, you know?"
"Until tomorrow my friend. And Harry?
"How can you make a decision like this and not tell me?" Draco quietly asks as his tears are falling.
Draco scoffs.
“Wimp.”
"Why are you all doing this to me, on a day like this?" Harry demands, trying to keep his tears at bay. "Why?" He demands.
“I won’t.” He says, picking up speed in both thrusts and strokes. Six strokes later, Draco is spilling all over himself and Harry is in awe of this. Harry spills his load into Draco a minute later. He collapses on top of Draco, and Draco simply runs his hand through Harry’s hair.
He thinks to himself.
in good spirits. As for me, I am doing
"No, but I can't imagine my life without him. I- I couldn't ruin our friendship like that at all. It's hard enough functioning everyday about my parent’s wellbeing and the only father figure Harry has ever known."
movies before! Draco, what do you want me to take?" Hermione asks.
"Maybe I am sugar daddy, but who knows." Harry said as he shrugged.
“Cum inside of me!” Harry demands, and Draco spills a large load of cum, deep inside of Harry. Draco rides out his erection until he pulled his dick out of Harry, watching his cum leak out of Harry’s used hole.
"Hey there, Draco." Flames greeted Draco when he gets to his house. "Wanna a beer?"
“Will you please excuse me?” Justin asks. “I need to go to restroom.”
"Well, I don’t need a visual of you and Hermione in my head for the rest of my life, but congrats to you."
Draco actually laughs at this.
"Man, you are making this so confusing."
"Hey, guys." Neville says as Blaise waves at her.
And Harry is in disbelief.
“Oh fuck.” Draco moaned as Harry is sucking him off.
"Well, I could make breakfast for you all the time. That is, if you want me to."
"I've been good. Now, let's go in. I love the drinks here."
Harry kissed Draco's hand before he started to drive.
!" Draco said excitedly as he kissed Tori's forehead and rubbed her back. Harry smiled as he got up from his bed.
"How about our favorite American Idolist’s latest album?" He tells her, putting away his wallet, reaching for his bag.
vibe from him. Now be honest with me, how do you feel about this hookup?" Hermione asks.
See, it was always for you to attract people because of your last name, but not because they personally knew you. For me, it was a lot easier to attract people with my confidence because it was easier to get what I want and just forget about all my past experiences that hurt. Confidence is something I can exude because it's a shield. It's the best shield that worked in my favor because being emotionally attached to someone after last time scarred me in ways that I never thought was possible. You never played coy or played games with anyone’s heart, which is extremely hard to come by. It was….....anyway confidence was a must I my life, but now I can only be confident with you because you're my equal and I never have to try so hard to be liked or put on a high pedestal by you, and it makes me super happy.
"How about
made me appreciate her even more because they’re very catchy." Hermione states after dancing along to Kelly's
“Hey, babe. What’s wrong?” Harry asks Draco over the phone, panicking. “You don’t sound too good.”
"Anyway, I can be Santa."
“Wait! I haven’t-Are you gonna-” Harry starts, but his ass is quickly filled with Draco’s cock. “Oh My God!" He says. Draco starts moving in and out of Harry, which makes Harry groan more and more. After a while, Harry starts to feel comfortable.
"Alright. I'll talk to you later,
"Yeah."
He was going to send the message, but he stopped. He couldn’t send it at all. He took a moment and wondered what he was doing.
"Hey!"
"Night." The new couple responded.
"You, Harry James Potter, are two minutes away from being a thirteen-year old girl who’s crushing on the football jock at school." Hermione tells him as she examines the picture. "I will say though, he’s hot. He’s a tall, dark skinned boy with high cheekbones and long, slanting eyes. He looks good in that silver vest. Just look at his abs!"
Draco gets on his knees beside him, watching her smile as Harry ran the rag on Tori's little head.
"I mean, I am happy that Harry is dating other people again even though he still wants Draco, but I didn't get the greatest vibe from Inferno at all when Harry was telling us his story. I mean, what kind is hookup name is Inferno? I don't trust his motives. Something tells me that there's more to this Inferno character. I just can’t put my finger on it right now, but I don’t trust him." Ron seriously states.
"It's too early to get drunk." Justin says. "But I am hungry considering it's 10:30 in the morning and we haven’t eaten yet."
“Wha-”
"Hey!" Hermione says, standing outside the car on the passenger’s side. "Where are you two coming from?"
"Harry?"
"Alrighty." He says while he takes the photo. "Don't you just......like it?"
“Shh.” The blonde man said, placing a finger on Harry’s lips before he resumed kissing his friend passionately. He continues for about another ten minutes before he takes off the rest of Harry’s clothes and his own clothes. Once every article of clothing is off, he kisses up and down Harry’s body. When he covers Harry’s hard length with his mouth, Harry starts going crazy.
"Hmm, Longbottom dragged me down here too. I- Weren't you watching Tori?"
“Sure,
"And Harry?"
"Aww, Draco that is a very sweet gesture." Harry tells him, appreciating the small gesture. "But, I'm having Inferno over for dinner. I decided that I wanted to cook a special dinner for him since we've been dating for a while. I cooked Mac and Cheese with lobster and I also made German Shepard's pie. Right now, I’m just waiting for the dessert to finish."
"Of course you would bring it." She laughs.
He lived a few miles from Harry, but at this rate, he felt as though it would take forever because, today of all days, traffic was a hot mess. It was like a nightmare come true for him because a few minutes later when he was on Harry's street, a truck was blocking the road. As he put his car in reverse, a car pulled up behind him.
"Ehh, maybe you could make breakfast tomorrow?"
"Well, the good news, I'm glad that your date was a success Harry." Hermione said. "Bad news, you're going to have to take my afternoon meeting as soon as you can as repayment for me taking your meeting."
“Harry, I- Oh. Hey, Ms. Figg. How are you doing today?”
Harry moved closer towards the stroller to look inside of it to catch Tori's attention. Tori looks from Hermione to Harry, and when Harry smiled at her, she moved her little fists around and gurgled happily at him.
Draco finally sighs.
"Another one." Harry repeated.
After Blaise left, Draco sat in silence, simply thinking about what Blaise said. He was so busy thinking that he missed when Harry came up to the table, kissing Tori's forehead.
Harry faces the wall, and starts to ride Draco like crazy.
," Harry starts.
"Thanks, Ron. You truly are the best." Draco tells him, while giving Ron a hug.
"Alright. You crazy kids go have fun now." Hermione says as she follows Harry and Draco into the living room. Harry dragged Draco outside after their goodbyes and helped him into the car, buckling him up.
This is it.
"What?"
or something? Nope. It was just him and Harry. His Harry who was standing inches away from him with his eyes swelling up, visibly upset.
"Thank you, sweetheart." The woman says. "You're an adorable little family."
He thinks to himself.
Harry's eyes widen.
"Did what?"
"He's a grown ass man."
"Whatever." An agitated Draco says. "What happened after you got
"I never knew she liked dabbing so much." Draco said causing Harry to snort making Tori laugh.
"Yeah. I wouldn't do it any other way." Flames responded while taking Draco's hand, leading to his bedroom.
"I don't have that much money on me."
"Thank you." Draco said.
"There's come in my ass," Draco states breathily, then punctuates his next question with Harry’s forceful thrusts. "Did you fuck me?"
"Don't think I didn't see the Catwoman outfit you bought online."
"But I don't think that he'll find out." Draco says. Well that's what he's hoping for at least. After all, how could Harry find out about this? He wasn't going to tell Harry about
"I wasn't that loud."
I'm too sexy for my shirt
"Whatever, Malfoy." Ron said, while rolling his eyes.
"I still don't know why though. What's happening?"
"Yes." Harry stated proudly. "I bought her some pink sunglasses, and a purple one too."
"Oh, I know because I always here that on a regular basis, which is strange because I detest that movie."
“Get on all fours.” Draco says.
and a
"No problem, bro. Now let's go back inside and have a good time! Let's get crazy!"
Once they are seated, a waitress comes to their table.
Draco thinks to himself, as he walks towards the bar.
"He's just so... He's like a penguin. He'll bond with you, he's dependable and trustworty."
"I was actually thinking about going to a hotel since my parents live in Great Britain."
And finally, "May I have the double cheeseburger please?" Harry asks.
"So, what are you in the mood for? She asks him teasingly, knowing that he'll be in the mood for pizza and some wings.
At this point, he didn't give two shits about anything at all. It felt like he had lost the will to go on. He just stopped caring about any and everything, and it wasn't helping that he was miserable.
"Oh don't worry, Harry. We're going to be awesome." Neville says as he and Blaise plop on the couch.
"Hey, Draco." Harry says, feeling jealous that it wasn't him in the bed with Draco. "Nice to meet you, Ernie."
"You ate the food." Justin said, causing the others to laugh.
Draco smiled.
"Draco." Harry greets formally as he wonders why in the world Draco could be happy.
Harry was in shock and so was Hermione.
Harry is surprised. “Maybe he had a family emergency.” He says to himself, knowing that the unexpected can happen. He gets another message.
"I am not cute." Draco shyly tells him.
“Looks good.” Draco says before he signs the contract.
Does if he's honest, except he wasn't exactly sure how it happened. He honestly didn't know. All Draco knew was that there was never a time when he didn't love Harry at all. Perhaps he fell in love with Harry when they met during their college careers. Maybe he fell in love when Harry would try and build his confidence in himself when he was feeling down or try to show him otherwise. Perhaps he fell in love when he and Harry first fucked when they were at Draco's birthday party without using any condoms and proceeded to have mind-blowing sex for years without using condoms at all. All he knew was that Harry made him feel things that he never felt before and that Harry was the best person to ever come into his life.
"Here you go." James said. "I'm too old to be changing diapers now."
at all since he was out the picture. As long as he was in Harry's company again, he was content about how things were going.
"Hey, Har!" Draco rings as Harry accepts the Facetime call. "This is Ernie."
"Well, I for one, am glad that you had a good time. I hope we can have more of these. Seeing as how we're taking it slow, I only have one question."
Harry blushes, then proceeds to answer his phone.
"Hmmm, maybe some kind of wine. I need him to stay awake for at least four of the movies."
"How about," She starts, dropping to her knees. "I start here." She says.
I know him better that anyone else.
"Harry!”
"I'll catch you later."
"Ron is going to be late." Hermione told Harry, who's currently sitting at her table. "Anyway, what kind of burritos would you like to eat this morning?"
"I had a lot of fun tonight, Potter."
“What the fuck happened to you last night?!” Draco asks, completely worried.
which is far from the truth. What would dad or Sirius say or do?" He asks, hyperventilating over what happened at Inferno’s house. As soon as he sits down on the couch, Draco's phone ring. It's Harry.
"It's just that these clothes cost you a lot of money. Plus all the other things you bought at Target.... it's just too much."
Harry sighs contently.
"Harry!"
"Really?"
"Alright, alright. I'm coming!" Ron says, running to the couch. Neville laughs at him.
“He just snuck on by, thinking that I wouldn’t see him, but he left with another man.” Harry tells his friend.
“Later, Draco.” Neville says as Draco leaves Harry’s house.
"How on earth am I going to pay you back?"
"I don't understand." He said.
"But how can that make anybody satisfied with their life?" A confused Draco asked Neville.
Body.
"I was thinking....."
"I have something to tell you and I don't know how you'll take it, but here it goes. I uh- well today I had a meeting and I left fro their with some good news. Umm, with that being said, I'm getting the hell out of town and I'm going to New York." He tells her in a calm voice.
Harry pulls out the lube from the night stand and applies a good amount on Draco’s length before applying some on his one hole.
better in bed!" Draco says happily. "I don't know what's gotten into me!"
“Har…” Draco moaned, running one of his hands all over his own torso while the other is behind his head.
"I know. I'll let you know how it goes in the morning."
Draco chuckles.
"Got it." Draco said, and with that, Harry went back to work. He took Tori out the the stroller and rested her against his chest, massaging her back as they were waiting for Harry and his friends. "We're going to meet some new people today, baby girl."
Harry at all." Inferno sneered at him.
"Ms. Rhythm Nation." Harry says in approval. "I love her!
He just loves how Harry can take his dick in both his mouth and ass.
"Honestly though, these past few weeks have been great! The sex with Hermione is out of this world! I should have asked Harry introduce her to me a long time ago. Which reminds me, I need to ask him where I can get some handcuffs since you won’t tell me where you get both get them from."
“Thank you, Ms. Figg. You’re the best.” He says leaving the compound.
"No way."
"Sure. Can we make vegetable lasagna? It’s been a while since we’ve cooked a meal together.” Draco says.
"True. You could never overlook something so obvious for such a long ass time." Ron says.
"I actually think that your decision is a good one, Potter."
"Aw." Draco says. "I'll be there in about half an hour.”
"The salad for the young man."
As I ring in the start of my 35th year in bed, naked with the man of my dreams, I will always be the one to protect him, just as he always protected me.
"Harry? Draco? I think Tori left a present for you in her terms of a diaper." They hear James say, making Harry laugh. "I think that gift is a gift for you two guys."
"Our friend here wanted to talk to Harry before he left, but we were unlucky."
The contact says with Draco's picture on it.
"So, where are we going?"
Draco blushes.
"What is it like having a baby?" Harry asked him as he picked up Victoria.
A few minutes later, Draco can’t stand it anymore.
"So, what's the occasion of the party? Did you guys get a promotion?"
Draco raises and eyebrow.
"Incriminating the evidence on your body? Shame on you!"
Justin Finch-Fletchley was the man that Harry had always dreamed of marrying. He was hard working, loyal, caring, smart and educated. He looked good and he was going nowhere but up. In other words, Justin was the man that Harry Potter wanted to marry and share his life with. After three years, Harry felt like it was time to settle down and start a family with this man.He pulls out his phone and calls his best friend of six years that he met in college in the entire world.
"Lead the way, love." Lily tells him.
"Harry told me about it years ago." Hermione tells him.
“Shit.” Harry moaned contently as Draco is within him.
"I am going to find you a man!" Draco says, totally excited.
playing.
“But Harry-” Draco says while more of his tears are falling down his cheeks.
Hermione bits her lip, but nonetheless, she nods her head.
"Great!"
Several minutes later, another man comes and stands next to Ron. He ordered a shot of vodka, drank it, grabbed Ron by his neck and made out with him with a mouth full of vodka.
"Cool. And Tori?"
"Yeah, you're right." Draco answered with a smile on his face.
"I got some Magnums." She says.
"Actually, he's never seen the movies at all. Since his birthday is about two months from now, we're going to have a
"Really?" Harry replies with a bright smile on his face.
The question stumped Harry. He really didn't know how he was going to tell Draco about his decision. In fact, he automatically assumed that Draco wouldn't care that much at all since their fight that took place at the bar. If, Harry was being honest with himself, he wasn't sad about Blaise and his whorish ways. He wasn't even mad that Draco had hooked up with him at all. Harry was actually sad that he couldn't stop blaming himself for being so damn gullible for far too long, thinking about achieving his happily ever after that he's been wanting for so long. Gullible for believing that something was there between he and Draco, even after showing him that someone is capable of giving him love in ways that Draco was capable of receiving.
At this moment, Ron didn't answer as he didn't know what to say. He felt sad that he couldn't help his friend out. They knew that nothing could be done at this point to cheer Draco up.
I never thought that anyone would love me after all these years of failed dates and being so uptight about things. When I met Draco all those years ago when we were young men in college, I never thought that he would be my knight in shining armor.
"How was she?" Draco asked as he took Tori from Harry's arms, causing her to whine a bit.
Draco chuckles.
"I'm Harry. Harry Potter. It's nice to meet you, Draco."
Harry smiles as he's going up the stairs of his home as Draco is following close behind him with Tori cooing in his arms.
"We all know that, but Draco wants to take things slow. He's been there with a guy who literally up and left him. For all we know, he's just unsure since this little cutie pie is in the picture." Hermione says.
"I’m in the mood for some nachos myself. Denny's nachos are my favorite, so why not have some?"
"Which are?"
Right now, though, he collapses, exhausted, on top of Draco's chest. Both boys are breathing heavily, and there's a poking in Harry's stomach, so as soon as he gathers the necessary strength, forces himself out on his arms, only to see Draco's cock pressed into his stomach, hard.
"He's an idiot."
Draco ponders for a minute.
When Harry turns the ignition on, his phone rings.
“What’s wrong, sweetheart?”
"Really?!" Draco happily exclaims as he quickly gets off the couch, almost tumbling over due to his hangover.
"Sure." Draco nods.
“Yeah.”
"Likewise." She says with a smile on her face.
Harry considers this for a moment.
." Harry said before putting the first movie into the DVD player. As soon as he pressed play, he walked right over and sat right next to Harry.
"Aww, why not?" Hermione frowns.
Suddenly, Draco grabs his phone.
"It was fun, as usual." Ron says as they give each other a bro hug. He gives the guy behind the bar a bill to get Draco whatever he wants. "Later, Draco."
After feeding their food to each other, they went back to her house where things got steamy. Once the door was closed, they were wrapped up in each other’s arm with their lips pressed firmly against one another. Within moments, they were in the bedroom where clothes were flying off of their bodies.
"Since he's a fucking deadbeat, I have to take care of my baby all by myself. I just know that my parents are going to say 'I told you so' because they knew that Marcus was wrong for me. I should have trusted their judgement based on my previous ex-boyfriends, but apparently I never learned my lesson." Draco said as his tears were rolling down his cheeks. "If I'm being honest, I guess that deep down inside I knew that they were right, but I wanted to prove them wrong. I can't go back and face them right now. Nothing good ever happens to me."
in a low, soft voice.
"What if you and Draco are actual soulmates? I mean, you two are practically inseparable. What is taking so long?"
While he doesn’t have an ovary of eggs, he understands where Hermione is coming from because he wants kids as well.
Neville stops in his tracks, causing Draco to stumble into him.
"It's nothing I can't handle, so don't worry about it, pretty boy." Harry says. Draco smiles as he nods, and he picks up the menu looking at the high priced meals. He decided to find the cheapest meals so that Harry wouldn't have to pay for a big meal.
"Good, because I like complimenting you."
"Oh fuck! Stop teasing me, babe." She moans. "Let’s get on with it!"
Truth is, he did however, it didn't connect right away until today.
"Sounds good to me, Malfoy. I can't wait to meet your
"I'll get him a cup of coffee." Hermione said as she left the room
"Fine" Says an irritated Harry.
"If you call giving me a tablespoon that barely had chocolate frosting on it sharing, then you're an angel!" She playfully retorts.
Harry watches as Draco stomps towards his bedroom before he took the plates to the kitchen. Once he was in the kitchen, he pulled out his phone, found the number he needed, pressed call and pressed it against his ear.
“Yup. He snuck past the girl at the front and left with another man.”
And with that, Draco starts to pound into Harry like there’s no tomorrow and Harry really enjoys this.
Hermione agrees with Ron’s sentiment.
Harry runs his fingers through his own hair as Draco continues to bob his head up and down.
"I don't drink a lot, but I really wanted a beer this morning."
' or what a ‘
"I haven't the slightest clue what this party of two needs." He tells her distractedly.
“Sure, babe.”
"I'm sorry. I don't know what I was- it was just the heat of the moment. You're just very hot and your lips look so beautiful and luscious - I think I should stop talking now." Harry said as he was trying to get his door open.
“You do, huh?” He hears, not realizing that Draco is undoing the buttons on his pants.
"I only ever went there at night to be honest. When Goyle left that afternoon, that was the first place that I thought of going."
"Are you fucking serious!?!" Draco yelled in frustration as he was honking his horn, conveniently blocked.
"You're welcome."
A few minutes later, Lavender approaches them and takes their order. "Would you like some wine?"
Ron laughs so loudly at that the other patrons turn to look at them.
"Sure."
"You can say that again."
And I just know we'll have a good time, ooh
“That my friend, is a deal. Until then, later.”
“Wow! This is-wow!”
"Thank you. Well, now that our search for Harry is over, I have to go home and sleep for this procedure that Ron and I have tonight.” Draco says. “Can we talk about this later when we have the time to hang out again?”
"You want to watch a movie? I have a lot of them on my shelf."
"That's right. I wanted to talk to Harry because I don't want him to leave without telling him how I feel, but the whole plan was a bust." Draco says in a sad tone.
Happy Birthday To Harry James Potter AND Happy Birthday To Me!
"This is some good shit!" Draco says. "When did you start fucking Martha Stewart?"
“It just sucks that I won't be going to your possible wedding to one Draco Malfoy in the future, where you'd become Mr. Harry James Potter- Malfoy, or Mr. Harry James Potter-Malfoy, and taking care of my future niece and nephews."
Draco grabbed his hands, effectively stopping his actions.
"On the outside, he is a grown man." Draco starts. "However, on the inside, he's like.... he's like... he's the light that shines from the sun. He's the kind of guy that you'd want to spend the rest of your life with, and he deserves every bit of it."
"Ho- what do you mean?"
"Harry?"
"Harry-"
" while pouring his heart and soul out to the three to us." Draco snorted.
"Thanks, Draco." Harry tells him before kissing Draco.
"I'm going to clean up." Harry said, ignoring Draco's last statement. Draco gets up and picks up Tori and gets up from the couch.
"Yes." Draco said. "It's been a long time since I've been on a proper date."
“Oh Harry.” Draco says sympathetically.
"Shhh." He tells her, taking off her underwear. After all her clothes are off, he simply stares at her body.
"Draco!" Harry shouts when he comes undone a few minutes later on his torso. After he's done, he notices that he is still so hard, so he decides to turn on the vibrator which instantly starts vibrating against his prostate, making him moan out in complete bliss as he is still fantasizing that Draco is currently fucking into him at the moment.
"Let's just sit and eat, before we move to the couch."
He bends down to lick around it every few moments, spitting into it to add more lubrication and help his finger slide in and out easier. As soon as Draco starts bucking his hips down on Harry's hand, he adds another finger, quickly scissoring him open. Draco throws his head back and moans out a groan, his eyes shut tightly together despite still being asleep. His cock is fully hard again and already leaking, and Harry considers that a personal win.
“Well, I could probably do this.” Draco says as he moves closer to Harry’s face.
Harry is just lying in bed, fantasizing about Draco and how he is a take-charge kind of guy in bed.  He loves listening to Draco's heartbeat whenever he lays his head on the blonde's chest. He loves when Draco runs his hand through his hair, flesh-to-flesh.
"That's my baby." He encouraged, making her move her tiny little hands before laying her back on his chest and tickled her stomach, causing her to squeal.
"Well, I've tried reaching out to him and I've failed miserably." Draco sighs miserably. "I've accepted the fact that he's going to New York without even telling me goodbye, accepted that I'm going to be miserable without him and I've also accepted that I'll be a gay spinster who patrols the streets at night as a 'Menace to Society' on a daily basis. I've accepted the fact that I've screwed up each and every opportunity that Harry gave me, and now that I'm ready to commit to him, he's gone."
"Yes." Harry said. "I like you too, and I know that you've been through a lot, so since I don't want to pressure you, we can take it slow."
"Hey, beautiful." He cooed making Tori smile a little. "Look at you!" He said as he put her on his lap and held her head up.
"Where's the food?" A confused Harry asks as she popped up at their table.
“And I believe in this
Hermione gives him a sad smile.
“But why is it that they always cheat on me?”
Anything.
"Yes, Draco?"
The color form Harry’s face drains.
nobody wants you, and
"Great. Now, hurry up so you can make it up to me. And don't forget to bring medical equipment."
"Aww, that was so cute." Hermione says.
"Anyway, what's in this drink?" Harry asks, while taking a sip of his drink.
"Ooh, take a look at this one!" Draco squealed as he took a blue dress with a braided belt off of the rack.
"Yeah! Bachelor for life! Now, let's stop talking about love and let's drink the night away." Draco tells him.
"Shut up." Harry says before he and Draco disappear into the kitchen.
"It's just that- Well- This might sound odd, but I wanted to make breakfast for you as a way to thank you for letting us stay."
Harry giggles.
“I’m looking for Harry. He hasn’t left yet, has he?” He asks Harry’s neighbor, hoping he’s still around the house somewhere, but the old woman simply shakes her head.
A smell that just makes you miss home, even if your home didn't smell this way. The place has a rustic design to it and a homey mood, it's dimly lit with candles on each table. It's not full packed but there are still a lot of people in the seats as Hermione looks around. A girl with wavy blonde hair and high cheek bones, who Hermione assumes is the receptionist, because of her uniform and all, approaches them with a smile.
Draco’s standing outside of the bar looking at the door, freaking out. ‘
As he is walking towards Hermione, he is stopped several times by different men asking him if he remembers their hookups, which irritates him. In his opinion, they are wasting his time because he wants to get to Harry, now.
He wonders to himself.
Draco hesitates for a moment. "Yeah. I guess that's what I wanted."
"That's deep, Draco!" Ron remarks.
“Wha-”
"Well, we are officially back in front of your girlfriend's house and I am going home."
Suddenly, Draco feels a pair of lips on his lips, and he groans and moans in pleasure as he kissed Harry back.
"I just guess that I'm assuming things and they just randomly showed up."
"So how come we're taking pictures?" Harry asked.
“Yes! Oh fuck!” Harry yells out as he’s riding the blonde man.
I have to admit, when he brought up the idea of making a contract, I thought that he was crazy. I mean, I thought that he was simply joking about being a couple at the age of 35 and that he was willing to be tied down to someone.
"Very descriptive, but very delicious for a drink. You're lucky I drink a bit, so I don't need to ask what a '
"Cocoa, if you have any, please."
"I like you too."
"You're a lying  piece of shit, Draco. I know this has something to do with Harry because anything concerning Harry always makes you anxious or sad. Right now you don't look anxious about anything, so you're sad about something." Ron says.
"He's not poor or anything, but I just didn't want them to be alone. He needed an extra hand and I wanted to be that person to give it to him. I really like him and his daughter means the world to me."
"So, how do you think she'll look like when she's older?"
“Do you know what it’s like to have an ovary of eggs just waiting to be fertilized?”
Suddenly, Draco starts laughing like crazy.
During the ride to the restaurant, Harry kept talking to Draco in order keep him from worrying so much about Tori. As soon as they got to the restaurant, Draco felt a bit insecure. The restaurant that Harry had taken them to was fancy, and Draco couldn't afford to eat there with people who were dressed up in fancy suits and dresses. He snapped out of his thoughts when Harry pulled out his chair for him to sit in.
"And he's the biggest people pleaser. It's all he ever thinks about when he's with a guy."
"You're really good with kids."
"What's wrong? Did I kiss you wrong or-"
"You could have said no, but you kissed me back."
....yeah, that one is very hard to do, mainly because it is easy to put the blame on someone else's. I know it's super easy to make petty excuses for something that doesn't happen or to conform to something that you aren't, but it's human nature, and I always learn how to take a cue from you when it calls for it. Seeing you own up to your mistakes....it's a huge turn on.
"For starters, he cheated on me, and mind you, I stopped caring because I was going to break up with him. When I confronted him about everything, he acted like I was stupid and it made me furious. I got all my clothes, Tori's things and left. I was in the park for a few hours when I decided to go back home and apologize-"
"I'm Hermione Granger, the smart one out of all of us." She said as she extended a hand out.
"Three years is too fast?" Harry challenges.
“You know what, Malfoy? Don’t.” Harry says while pulling away from Draco’s touch. “Don’t think about me. Don’t talk to me. Don’t even look at me, ok?” Harry turns to the bartender. “One martini-extra dirty for this dirty, conniving, snake in the grass.” He tells him while putting money on the bar.
"Nope. I'm a bachelor for life. You and I are total opposites. You're the better catch out of the two of us."
"We would be a great family." Draco said to himself.
"Ok, is that all?"
"I know." Ron bragged. "So, you'll be at the party?"
Ron thought to himself.
"Potter, can we stop?" Draco asked as he pulled away from Harry.
"Maybe." Flames says seductively.
"You already did, three times." Draco tells him.
"Wow." Harry says as he looks at the clock. It's after 11. He makes his way to the kitchen and washes his plate and throws the empty bottle of wine away. After all that is done, he takes a shower and relaxes under the pulsing water hitting his skin. Ten minutes later, he's in his bed just wearing his black underwear and a tank top.
“Well, she didn’t follow the rules to her restraining order, so the police shot her arm after she shot at them.” Ron says.
He starts wondering what he's going to do if Harry is actually missing because he can't picture life without Harry at all.
"Nine inches." Harry supplies quickly without even thinking about it at all.
"Aww, you like the water don't you?" He asks. "I think she really likes the water."
“I’m going to take care of you tonight.” Draco promised.
Hermione calls Draco as Harry remembered that he was supposed to call him back last night.
"Well, I had to check! The last time you said that you didn't want a pizza, you ended up eating an entire box of pizza without sharing and a container of frosting, which you ate in less than half an hour." Hermione deadpans.
"I was just trying to cheer him up!” Draco says defending his actions. “Harry broke up with his latest boyfriend. I would think that anyone would want to be cheered up after breaking up with someone."
"Sorry. It's just- I've never done anything like this before. I don’t really know what to do at all." Harry admitted in a shy voice.
Harry simply shrugs.
"You lady, are evil." Harry says through his laughter.
"Wow." Harry said as he looked at Draco before standing up. "You look amazing."
“Yes! Fuck-yes!” Harry shouts failing to realize that he just spilled his load all over the sheets.
"Hey, besides being a goddamn man whore, I finally found something that I'm fucking great at besides working at the hospital."
“Hey there.” Draco says to Harry’s length.
"Apparently, Harry just met somebody new." Draco begrudgingly admits.
"May I get strawberry lemonade please?" The four ask.
"Actually I was thinking about getting a bunny costume or a little princess."
"I think it's perfect, so don't stress yourself out, babe." Draco tells him while walking up to Harry. "Knowing you for…..practically all my adult life, you’ve never done anything half-assed or small. You love making big gestures, taking care of everybody and making sure that everything is perfect. It's one of the things that I love most about you." Draco tells him, while cupping Harry's cheeks.
"Wait! I need to hear this myself, just as soon as I put this chicken in the oven." Ron says from the kitchen.
Ernie lays his head on the pillow after he cleaned Draco's cum off of his chest with Draco's shirt.
Harry sighs again.
"I know I am. Now get out of here you lonely man." Ron says.
"Here's to you, Draco." Harry says as he is raising his glass. "I hope you find happiness, wherever you go in life very soon." Harry says, lifting the glass to his mouth before going to bed.
Draco simply feels his cheeks warm as he watches the old, cute couple leave, trying not to be too awkward as he glances at the raven-haired man. Harry on the other hand, was trying to conceal the grin on his face, nodding to himself.
The moment he parked his car in front of Draco's place, he turned the car off and knocked on the door.
"You- you want to help me raise her?"
"It's a pity that you think that I don't know you." Ron said. "You're acting as though we've never met."
"I promise you that it won't hurt as much if you can just try."
This Is A Back In The Day Chapter.
He wants to see Harry get off.
You guys, I can't cry anymore. I'm really tired of crying. When Harry leaves, he'll be taking all my tears with him."
"You kissed him?! You actually
"Harry, what's with all the toys?" Lily asked as she sat on the couch along with James.
drink?"
Draco giggled.
On one hand, he’s sad that he didn’t get so talk to Harry, but on the other hand, he was happy that he didn’t get to talk to Harry because he didn’t even know where to start apologizing from.
“Whatever.” Draco snorts.
"We'll have a good time. I promise." Harry tells him.
Harry sighs. He knew it was too good to be true.
"Go away, Harry."
"Cause you are now on Grindr." Draco replies.
Tori stops crying and she smiles at her father.
“You like that?”
“Right.” Ron says, not believing a word out of his friend’s mouth.
"Yeah. Like, my mum always said that having a baby at a young age would be hard, but it's not that bad."
Draco smiled.
"Thanks, Draco. How do you always know what to say to make me feel better?" Harry asks with a bright smile on his face.
"I just couldn't." Draco says sadly. "If you knew how upset he'd get, then you wouldn't have told him either. I just... I couldn't bear to hurt his feelings anymore than what they were."
"All I want for him is to be happy. I mean, I love making him happy and - God, I don't know how to describe it."
Draco ignores him and lifts his phone to his ear.
It rings once and Draco answers.
"Thanks, Lavender." Ron says, putting his arms around both Hermione’s and Lavender's shoulders. "Now, can we please be lead to our table?"
Harry takes off his shirt.
Draco smiles before shrugging.
The guy paled sensing Ron's sense of violation.
"Because I don't want to be alone for the rest of my life. I want the boring live, where I get married, have kids, grow old and share my life with someone who loves me in return."
"Anyway, back to work with you." Hermione says with glee as she gets off of his desk. "Bye, love!"
“Draco….” Harry moans.
Harry guessed that Gregory was the baby father, so he nodded as he was listening to Draco, who was currently putting his spoon in the empty mug.
"Anytime."
"Got off." Draco finished.
"Ok. I'll go grab the movie, and you can head down to the living room."
"As much as I hate it, I'll support your decision." She concedes.
Harry moans as Draco runs his hands through Harry’s raven hair.
"Your wish is my command, papí." He says reaching for his phone out his pocket. Once he retrieves his phone however, it slips and Draco sees Harry's picture on Inferno's phone.
"Thanks." They all say.
"Honestly? Yes I am because that contract is almost up. I'll tell you more about the wedding plans I have for you and Draco's wedding, at lunch." Hermione stated.
“So, since you also had a failed hook-up, why don’t I repay you by giving you the orgasm that the wimp didn’t give you?”
"That is true." Neville agrees.
"So what's the plan, Harry?" Ron asked his best friend.
"Inferno, you really have a nice place." Harry said shyly, while looking around Inferno’s house.
Hermione's eyes widened and she left the table in a rush.
Draco smiles at the nickname that Harry has given his daughter.
"Hey, Harry. How are things going?" Asks, while Draco sitting down next to him at the bar.
"Cool. I'll put in a surprise." Harry said as he went to the kitchen.
So he goes on and explains the details of the slumber party, while they eat out of each others food. By time they are done, they decide to get some milkshakes for their desserts. Once they were done, Harry was going to pay for their bill, but Draco stopped him.
"So, let me get this straight, I'm not a good enough reason to stay here anymore? Is that what you are telling me?" Draco asks Harry, waiting for an answer, but Harry doesn't answer him.
"Can't say that he's called or dropped by." Sirius said worriedly.
"What's wrong? Inferno asks him.
"I swear, what is the point of Ron having a key?" Harry asks himself as he rolls his eyes. "He's worse than Neville."
They are left in their underwear and they resume kissing.
"Because I don't want to be with anyone who has the same unit as I do, I really do love the drinks here, and the music is out of this world!"
Hermione blushes.
Hold you.
"Well, you seem to sweet to be a murderer."
"You of all people should know that it's not how life works." Ron tells him. "This dude cheated on Harry, and I know your stance on cheating. If you don't tell Harry now, then he's going to find out some other way. Trust me. If you don't, you'll always have that thought in the back of your head screaming
Harry turns back to Tori, who's currently sticking her bottom lip out for a pout before she starts to cry.
"You're a riot." Harry responded. "Anyway, I have some news…..”
Since he wasn't expecting a response, he gently placed her in the water as she squirmed a bit. Harry smiles as he's rubbing Tori's stomach as she smiles at him.
"Ron ate your food. I swear, Ron never stops eating!" She said, completely irritated. "So for dinner, you'll be having red velvet cake with some ice cream."
“I’m fine, Sirius. I was actually calling to thank you for the Red Velvet Cake recipe. I thought it would have been hard, but it was a piece of cake. No puns intended.” Harry tells him.
“Find your own eye candy.” Harry says.
Harry sighs.
"And you didn't even invite me?"
"THE BABYSITTERS HAVE ARRIVED!" Ron said loudly, causing Tori to jump a little in her father's arms from being startled. Draco looked down at Tori, and noticed that she poked her lip out and she began to cry.
"About what?"
"Ouch! So rude!" Harry says playfully.
Harry knows the feeling all too well. Like his friends told him, people only used him for their own beneficial needs. It hurt Harry to know that people would use him just to gain materialistic things instead of loving and having feelings for him.
“Sure.” Justin says.
It was lunch time at the hospital, and Ron and Draco were at the nearest diner eating some sandwiches and talking to one another.
He gets a Grindr notification on his phone.
"That was too fast. I want another one."'
"Well, I charge $1000 pro bono."
"So......Harry, did you have fun tonight?" He asks while pouring his drink.
It's quiet for a moment between the two men.
“You could at least feel a little bad for me.”
"Someone was hungry for a bottle." Harry said as he sat down. Draco dug into the bag and he handed him a bottle. He watched as Harry began to feed Tori, who was clinging onto Harry's thumb. Draco simply smiled at the sight, wondering how life could be beautiful at this moment.
"And how did you find this restaurant?" Hermione teases, even though she feels warm all over.
"Well, remember how I told you about Ron wanting to hang out with us?”
"That's so adorable." Harry cooed as he pinched Draco's cheek, causing the blonde to scoff as he unwrapped Tori from the towel.
"Sure." Neville responded as Draco took Tori's bag and made his way to Harry's room. Now, Draco has never slept in Harry's room as he usually slept in one of the other rooms that was available. When he finally got to Harry's room, he put the bag down on the bed, and laid Tori down and changed diaper and into PJs. He chose the onesie with little hearts and stars on it. Draco then noticed that his daughter was yawning and fisting her eyes.
"Ugh, please don't even go there!" Draco said angrily.
“I don’t care.” Draco says as they make their way back into the lounge room. “If people didn’t cheat on their significant others, then bad things wouldn’t happen to them.”
"Just what Harry?" Draco asks while moving to pull Harry into a side hug.
Draco took a bit of the waffle and pancake.
"Let's eat then." Harry chuckles, while grabbing Draco's hand. "What are you on the mood for?" He asks while tangling their fingers together and putting his head on Draco's shoulder, waking to the kitchen.
"Thank you."
"We're probably gonna help you too." Blaise says.
"It's not enough for me, Draco." Harry says, shaking his head silently crying.
"All of it."
Tori was looking around the room, sucking on her pacifier.
“God, this felt good. You're amazing, Malfoy." Harry pants.”
"That doesn't help me at all, Neville. All I know is that he's going away and I won't see him anymore." Draco tells him dejectedly.
Harry's breath almost hitched as cool grey eyes met his own green eyes and if Harry was honest with himself, they were beautiful.
"You and your plans."
When Draco got there about fifteen minutes later, he spotted Harry. Harry was wallowing and singing one of Draco’s favorite song to himself.
Aside from Tori's gurgles, it's quiet for a few minutes.
"Sure thing." Gwen exclaims happily.
Harry gets in position right in front of her and does about fifty push-ups before stopping for a break, watching Tori smile and gurgle at him. He grins and grabs one of her toys.
"As much as I'm mad at you for fucking me while I was asleep," Draco pouts, "And not letting me enjoy it as much as I would when I'm awake, I have to admit, waking up to you is really good.”
“You’re the amazing one.” Harry says before placing a kiss on Draco’s spine. He grabs Draco’s hips and starts pounding into him at a hard, but gentle pace. The deeper he gets into Draco, he can here Draco’s moans which starts to get louder and louder.
“I tried calling him, texting, emailing him, and showed up to his place, but he isn’t talking to me. I am not the smartest guy around, but I sure can take a hint when someone is ignoring me.” Draco whines.
"Really? I never saw you there."
"You never know. This weather is crazy."
"To men," Hermione toasts, lifting her glass. "Fuck 'em!"
"Draco, Tori won't smile for me at all."
"That's adorable. You two are so cute." Harry says as he now lies flat on his stomach.
“It doesn’t work.” Draco says regrettably.
"Alrighty then. Now that that's settled, we have to make sure that you're gonna look perfect."
"Like it? I love it, Mr. Photographer. Now I can see why you're a photographer you nerd. But why did you take my photo?"
"Save it, Malfoy." Harry sneers shaking his head, putting his hand up hoping that Draco will stop talking.
"You grabbed my chin and - Don't blame this on me. I said a peck not a full make out session with my daughter is on the floor."
They are fighting for dominance, and that is just how they are for the better part of 36 seconds.
"A bit." The blonde said as he shivered as he pulled the stroller closer towards him after he dropped his bag near his feet.
"I think your daddy is very cute and brave for taking care of you and being a songle father. That's amazing. Even though we just met today, I feel like we'll be a great little trio, don't you think?"
Draco smiles.
“Count me out!” Ron says.
"It's time for bed, my little princess. You're past your curfew." Draco joked as he grabbed her pacifier.
I love that you always manage to
"Please, Harry?" Draco begs while moving towards the driver’s side of Harry's car as Ron stands in front of Harry's car.
“It sure was.” He agrees.
"Yeah." Harry agreed as he moved closer to the blonde haired man, waiting for any reaction from him. "She get's that from yours truly."
"Are you sure?"
He rang the doorbell.
"Pleasure's all mine, Hermione." He smiles and then turns to Ron. "She's so pretty, you sure she's just a friend, Ronald?"
"Of course I will." Draco says. "It's great to have something to look forward too."
"Well, is that a yes I smell in the air?" Draco teases.
Harry blushes.
"Fuck. Say that again." Draco moans.
"Malfoy, can I ask you a question? Strictly hypothetical?"
Draco sobs, getting up from the floor, grabbing a hold of Harry’s right wrist. “I’m so sorry, Harry. I’m so, so sorry, but you don’t understand, Harry. I thought that if I could tell you the whole story, maybe we-”
Hermione picks up the phone on Harry's desk and dials Draco number.
"To hang out, but I know that's just a cover up. They're coming to see Tori."
"That’s great!" Ron says. "Congratulations!"
"Because I've always heard you say that you want kids. Preferably three kids: 2 boys and one girl."
"Thank you." Draco said with huge smile on his face.
This time, Ron laughed.
Both men are fighting for dominance, but Draco decides to let Harry take the lead as it is his birthday.
"That makes me feel even more worried." A freaked out Draco says.
"Thank you. Her name is Victoria." Draco says as his daughter was moving her tiny fists around. "You want to hold her?"
"Hey, hey, hey! Calm down, babe." Harry says grabbing Draco's hands as Draco starts whimpering, wondering where his baby girl is.
"You're daughter is really cute." Neville says as he coos at her.
Harry took off his hat and put it on Tori's head.
"Well, there's nothing wrong with that, Malfoy. I mean everybody needs someone, even you. I will say though, you certainly know what's best." Ron says, slighly mocking him.
nobody needs a man like you! You’ve fucked around for years, and now you’ve fucked my motherfucking man? Screwed all the gay men like ourselves? I’m surprised that you aren’t a goddamn escort.”
"Don't push it."
"Man, that's rough. Well, if you're good and you trust him, then I trust you. Just be very careful, alright?"
“Please don't let me die alone.”
"Well, I have a backyard."
“What have we been doing for the past 10 years of our life? I may not be your ideal Prince Charming Harry, but you know that I would slay a dragon for you." Draco tells him.
"I think it's great that your plan worked." Ron says, even though he's still rooting for Harry and Draco to get together.
“Plea-” Draco’s voice cracks, trying to reach for Harry’s hand but Harry’s not having it.
"I think you should hang out with him tonight." Ron suggests to Draco.
"Alright, I'll see you tomorrow, Malfoy. I can't wait to see Ron again."
"Wai- no promotion?" The blonde asks. "I don't understand."
"Something like that." Hermione says. "Ron, can you help me with the karaoke machine?"
Going To Harry's House
If Harry were to describe his best friend, he would says that Hermione is very clever, exceptionally talented, levelheaded, book-smart, and very logical. He could also say that she is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends—a person who can be counted on. Harry values that Hermione never strays off the path and that she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done. For all the positive things that he can say about her, the only flaw that he finds interesting is the fact that she is afraid of failure, which was evident when she lost a case in court when her client lied on the stand causing her to lose. She was pissed for three and a half weeks because that was the first and last case that she ever lost in her career.
“I saw you picture on his phone. I unintentionally hooked up with Inferno, Harry.” Draco told him.
“I brought you lunch.” He tells her holding up a bag of food for her.
"No. I met him a month or so ago, and his name is Draco."
"Did you have fun, princess?" He asked and Tori drops the toy, smiling widely at Draco, showing her gums. "You have such a beautiful smile." He coos, rubbing his nose on hers.
"Thanks." Harry smiles. "So how was work today?"
As Draco was rushing to the Harry’s office, he thought back to his younger days before his relationship with Harry.
Ron's mouth drops.
"Are you absolutely sure that you don't want something to eat? You should at least take a nap." Ron kindly offers while Draco parks Ron's car in the driveway.
"Oh, you know your mum would say the same thing!" Dean laughs as he pours each of them a glass, takes their order and walks away.
Justin gave Harry a small smile.
This time, Draco frowns.
I’ll be the ying to his yang, his sun to the sky and all that.
Harry was suspicious by Draco's tone. On one hand, he was wondering if the blonde was trying to weasel his way out of the contract, and on the other, this plan could help him get out of his comfort zone. Their contract was going to be up very soon, which would make them a couple that everyone, and literally everyone, was root for. Hell, even Harry was rooting for it.
"Draco, you can have anything you want from the menu. I promise that it won't cost a lot."
“Oh yeah.” Draco moans lowly as Harry is stroking him through his underwear.
"Thanks." Harry said with a smile on his face. "Make yourself at home. Are you hungry? I could make something that's quick and easy."
"Let's go outside where you can hear me." Draco says, leading them out of the bar.
"Yeah, but I don't have red hair. That honor belongs to one of my other friends." Harry stated.
"You know I want it, so just destroy me already."
"I guess she didn't like bath time."
No need to hurry, we've got everyday
"So, how's the dating life with Hermione going?" Draco asks his friend as they get back to Ron's car.
“You know, I still have some clothes here, so I think it’s best that I get ready here. Go-Go Bar, here we come."
"Thanks?"
"No she doesn't." Harry said.
, Malfoy.” Ron tells him as Hermione laughs.
"You knew that we were sleeping together all those years ago?"
"You must have been to South America." She says as she pumps his member.
Harry continues to writhe as Draco bobs his head up and down in a slow manner. He swore that he would just die from getting his dick sucked by the man that he loved so much. What took Harry out for a moment was the fact that Draco looked at him as he was bobbing his head up and down all while running his right hand all over his chest. When Draco finally pulled away, he got back on top of Harry and went back to passionately kissing Harry as if his life depended on it. They kissed for a good minute or two, Draco inserted his hard, leaking cock inside of Harry.
Love always,
Harry smiles waving the bear in front of the cooing baby.
We’re always together and it feels so good.
Harry ignored him as he walked out of the room. As he was nearing Draco and Tori, he was Hermione beside the stroller, cooing him Tori.
They pull away from each other and Harry takes off Draco’s pants.
Ron looks around the room doubt, shaking his head at his friend once more. "In theory."
“I wanted to go somewhere special tonight.” Harry starts. “I think that when you have met someone, you should spoil them a little, right?”
He is so happy that Harry came untouched, all because of him.
There was no use getting to him.
"Eight pm on the dot. I like a man who is on time.” Hermione greets.
"You dick! You planned this, didn't you?!"
"Tori, that is despicable on all levels." Harry told the two month old, chuckling when she sent him a toothless smile. "Be happy that you're a cutie."
"You shouldn't have been the one to apologize. He should be to one to do that for cheating on the both of you."
“So, when you get married to Justin, what kind of dog are you going to get?”
Draco rolls his eyes playfully and moved towards Tori and picked her up.
"You got that right!"
"Night." Harry says.
"Since I started to look for a man." Harry laughs. "I guess the cognac wasn't going to help either since I soaked the strawberries in it."
Harry smiles triumphantly as that is one step closer to being with Draco. Now, Harry knows that even though they met, he has to fulfill the goal of getting Draco to let him in so that he can take care of him and Tori.
"I think the better I should ask you should be this: Do you think it's crazy that two people who wrote a promissory note to each other a decade ago, who actually care for one another, would actually be in a committed relationship?"
"I'm sorry!" The guy says as he quickly flees.
"Alright, rich ass. I'll pay." He tells her not minding that he has to pay for the food.
"There's come in my ass," Draco states breathily, then punctuates his next question with Harry’s forceful thrusts. "Did you fuck me?"
Draco takes in the sight of Harry’s toned body, and he certainly enjoys the view, hoping that he can ingrain the image in his head for life.
"Fine." She says.
"You truly are the best."
"Later, Draco."
"Well that's too bad because she's staying with me." Harry teases.
Ron blushes as Hermione shyly looks down at her lap, smiling a bit.
"I'd rather not-" Harry cuts him off.
"Can I have that in writing?"
After he finished cleaning himself off, he simply lied in bed not even bothering to put his underwear back on.
Draco nods unsurely before watching Harry motion to his parents. He smiles seeing a middle aged couple walking in with warm smiles on their faces.
"Yup. Especially since you two were pretty much inseparable."
"Let's." He says as he lets Harry take his hand.
"That's highly surprising, considering you guys missed him." Hermione says.
“I know I am.” She jokes. “Now, go find him and tell him that you love him. I’ve got to get my place ready for my friends.” She says encouragingly, pushing Draco away from the house. “Good luck!”
Harry nods his head and leads his parents to the kitchen.
"Well, if you want, we could still go slow and still kiss."
birthday from the man that he loved. The picture is of a cake covered Harry and a pristine Draco are standing with their backs together, making goofy faces at the camera. Harry smiled at it.
He sighs.
"No, just stay with your baby girl. You've had a long day." Harry said as he went to the kitchen.
"It just that..." Harry sighs, and breaks down in tears.
“No, I haven’t bottomed before. Have you topped?”
"So, it's just me and you, cutie." Harry told the whining baby as he picked her up. He turned down the volume of the TV before sitting down next to Draco, but not too close to scare him away. As he laid down, Harry dug through Draco's baby bag, looking for a pacifier. He slipped it in her mouth gently before laying her down on his chest with her eyes gazing at him.
"Great. I can't wait to see you dress up again."
"Where?"
Harry cries in pleasure, when Draco starts stroking Harry’s cock. It doesn’t take long for Harry to spill cum in Draco’s hand and on his stomach. A few moments later, Harry is clenching around Draco. “I’m gonna-”
"Well, forgive me for not wanting to bitch about deceitful people tonight, alright?"
"All Harry wants is to be loved."
, Malfoy. I mean you are fond of them." Harry smirked. “After all, it is your favorite way to-“
Draco Lucius Malfoy is the man that I plan on marrying one day and I want to have kids with him.
"I know that, Draco, but it's the least I can do for tonight. Is it a crime to let me pay for our meal, when I'm giving you the chance to throw me a party without any kind of help at all from yours truly?"
Draco hadn't showed up to his shift, again. This has been going on for the past two weeks, and honestly, he's over it. Usually, he would carpool with Ron to the hospital, but lately, he had to drag his best friend out of the house to get to work. He had no doubt that Draco was hungover, again.
"And what's that?" Harry demands.
I will always be here as his rock.
"You're lucky that you got an hour." Ron says. "I could have bailed on your ass after one drink."
A couple minutes later, the rest of the crew came out.
"You know what this party of two needs?" She asks him.
"Don't you know how much money that's gonna cost? A crib, changing station- it's just too much. I don't want you to spend anymore money on us."
"Your house is gorgeous!"
"Thank you. May I ask what exactly am I drinking?" Harry asks Inferno. As Inferno was about to answer Harry's question, Harry's phone rang.
"Hey!" Luna says, flipping the channel. "An old episode of
"I'll let you decide." He tells her while pulling the CD out of his bag.
Harry simply starts going faster, thrusting his hips with fluid movements as he bottoms out and pulls back out, only to slide back in with powerful force. He wants to make Draco feel really, really good just as Draco makes him feel good. The thought makes his dick twitch as he snaps his hips back in, his balls slapping against Draco's skin. He bends down as he continues thrusting, and not being able to kiss Draco properly in his dazed state, sucks on his nipples, which are already hard and firm from horniness.
"Enough about me and my boyfriend though. Judging by all the love songs, I’d say that your love life is going well for you too."
"None whatsoever.” Draco says, taking a seat next to Harry. "Did you see how Hermione kept looking at Ron when I was telling her about your birthday party? I've never seen someone so in love like that before."
“And if you sigh like that one more time, I’m going to request a frontal lobotomy to be done on you.” Ron warns.
The blonde looks up at Harry and shook his head.
"Really?" He asks Draco with a distant glimmer of hope in his eyes.
"Very comfortable." Draco answered honestly with a smile on his face and his insides fluttering.
“If my hunch is correct, then he probably said something along the lines of
“Are you sure that all you wanted to tell him, Draco?” Ms. Figg wants to know.
"Correction, Hermione Granger, it is a stride of pride."
"Yup." Harry says as he takes the keys out of the engine, getting out of the car. He opened the door to the back of the car, grabbing a hold of the car seat that Victoria had been in. Draco took the car seat, attached it to the stroller and followed Harry up the couple of stairs. As soon as they stepped into Harry's house, Draco was in awe of what he saw.
“Do you want this? Do you really want this?” A naked Harry asks Draco twenty minutes after their first round.
"Yeah, yeah, Draco. We knows What happens next. You start off by going "Hey there. I'm Draco. You're hot. Where do you want this, and how do you like it?" Harry responds.
"I better get going." Draco tells him while removing his hands from Harry's cheeks.
I'd tell you about money, but I don't think you'd care much babe. I guess all I have to say on the matter is to save up for a rainy day because anything can happen.
"How do you know about their contract?" Ron asks.
"I know I am, and I know that I'm moving a little bit.... forward, but I would rather have you here with me than being at some other place."
After their fuck fest, and a three hour long nap, both men wake up.
He thought to himself. “God, I love that man. I better call him.” Harry says to himself while pulling out his phone.
"Really, Malfoy." Harry says, before he pulls Draco by his neck and starts kissing Draco senseless.
“Anytime.”
"What the hell possessed you to do that without telling anybody about this hookup?!" A freaked out Draco asks him. Draco is not pleased with Harry’s decision at all, especially at this hour of the night.
He smiles as Harry does this and positions himself behind Harry, pulling out the lube from the nightstand.
“It’s all for you.” Draco says in a light tone before he places his mouth on Harry’s length once more.
Draco looked around, until he spotted Ron going to the kitchen.
"Can I get a laugh, Tori?" Harry asks, smiling at her before he blows raspberries in her neck which causes her to smile widely at him.
"Draco! How, are you? Is Harry with you?"
Harry pulls away from Draco’s cock and starts to take off the rest of his clothes seductively.
"He's a good lay."
Draco sits on the toilet seat, sitting his daughter up.
I want to grow old with him.
"I forgot my keys. I was going to pick the lock, but Sirius let me in. He used the spare key you gave him to unlock the door. I'm sorry for almost picking your lock."
“I don’t know yet.” Harry sighs. "I do know that I miss him a lot though."
"Just remember, no matter what happens, no matter where life takes us, just remember that I love you." Draco says. "Food, here we come!"
“Yeah.” Harry moans throwing his head back as Draco puts his hands on Harry’s waist. “Oh yeah.”
Inferno resumes kissing Draco. After the third ring, Draco says "I think you should get that because it's fucking with my thoughts and it's distracting us from going all the way."
"Don't degrade yourself like that, Draco. You know you're not a man whore at all."
Draco simply looks at him, smirking like an idiot.
"True. You could
They both start cackling like loons.
"I agree with that." Harry told him.
"What?!" Hermione asks. "I just never thought that you've been feeling some kind of way about your love life. You can’t just give up!”
"You guys are sweet." Draco said.
"I need to." Harry says, feeling equally as sad as his friend.
birthday.”
"They're here." Harry said with a smile as the door opened, snapping Draco out of his thoughts. Draco took Tori from Harry and sat on the couch, kissing her forehead.
"Fine. Here." Harry passes his phone to the blonde.
Draco enters his apartment, and puts his keys down on the coffee table.
He’s always had my heart.
“Ugh!” He yells, and lies down on his bed, still wet from his shower only covered in a towel.
"So how did you rent out the whole cafe?" Harry asked as he shoved a spoon of ice cream in his mouth.
"Oh, how I wish someone would look at me like that." Said Harry, sounding sad and heartbroken. "Why can't I find my one and only?"
"Just go over to his house and see if he's down to hang out with you. If I were in your position, I'd take some pizza and some beer and just hang out with him."
"That's what I've been trying to tell you! I mean, you keep thinking that one guy is exactly what you need to be happy! Harry, you can still have-" Draco says but Harry cuts him off.
, plus
"Oh, I'm sorry. I was just really excited for this date of yours." She says smiling at Hermione who gives her a small smile back. "I expect an invitation to your wedding!"
“I'm tired of having my heart broken by assholes who don't appreciate me. Sometimes I feel like it just isn't worth it looking for love since Draco is…..Draco." Harry says.
Later that night, Draco reaches Harry's door and hears something interesting on the other side. He opens the door and immediately smiles. Harry's so busy dancing and singing to himself, that he doesn't notice Draco watching him putting utensils on the dinner table.
"Okay. I hope he has some sort of information or something." Draco says to her as he tries not to break down and cry.
Harry moans as he nods his head in agreement.
"So you can drool?"
"Seriously, how are you straight, but like going to GoGo bars? Just give a reason why?" Draco asks Neville as they enter inside the bar.
"I think we've been going to fast."
“Likewise, Harry.” Ron says shaking Harry’s hand.
"Aww, don't cry, Tori." Harry says with a pout as Draco grabs a towel.
Harry snorted as he grabbed Draco's coat and went to the kitchen.
“I just wanted to say goodbye to him, that’s all.”
Draco’s nerves start to spike.
He thinks to himself.
Harry shoots his load all over his stomach.
"Yup, and after aboutt a decade, it doesn't get old. Shall we get a couple beers after we go dance on the dance floor?" Draco asked his friend.
“I love when you get li-”
"Likewise." A blushing Hermione says.
Taste.
"Well, it's your loss." Draco shrugs. "I love people with same unit as I do. Sometimes I love it when it's bigger and thicker than mine."
"It'll dry, so don't worry."
"I know but-" Draco starts again.
"Yeah, yeah. If you say so." Ron says as he smirks.
"She's fine. It was just a little sneeze." Draco says, laughing a little bit. He sits his daughter up and she's looking around the room.
Draco smiled at the fog before he stretched for a little bit before he looked for Tori's whereabouts. He found the stroller, but the car seat was missing which instantly caused him to get out of the bed. Once he as on his feet, Rex was running around in circles around him excitedly, but the man couldn't play with the dog right now as he wasn't sure where Tori was. Draco's first instinct was to look upstairs, but instantly stopped when he heard the sound of a timer going off in the kitchen. He quickly walked towards the kitchen with Rex following him. When he got into the kitchen, he saw Harry hold Tori in his arms. Tori was drooling on Harry's shirt as Harry was placing two plates on the table.
on repeat for an hour.
"What should I do?" Draco says, while thumbing his eyelids.
"And I wanted a cuddle."
"I can't do that. He'll think that I'm jealous, which I'm not."
"I'll see you in a bit." Draco says as he hangs up.
“Are you going to be that asshole who’s going to be riding people on their cheating way or what?
No answer.
"Truthfully, Draco. Do you like Harry? As in “like him” like him?" Luna asks him.
Harry smiled as he saw Draco chew his bite of the sandwich.
“Draco, that is totally crazy.” Harry says trying to keep his mixed emotions under control.
When I’m with you, the world stops and I just let myself stop, be me and just think about you. It is so hard picturing a life without you, and when I thought that I was going to lose you…. I would have lost an important part of me. It's still so hard to believe that I almost lost you. You, the most important person of my life. When times get rough, no one would ever be able to take your place at all, and that scares me. All I know is that I’m happy that you will always be there for me, just as I’ll always be there for you. No matter what happens in life, I’m happy to have met such an amazing man like you. From childhood to now, it’s been an amazing ride that I’ve been on and I am happy to be on that ride with you. Thank you for being my every thing. You are the best and I love you, always and forever. I can’t wait to marry you, Harry Potter.
"Harry, it was a pleasure seeing you again. Do me a favor, and see that this nerd doesn't trip on his own feet? I mean he is pretty clumsy." Ron jokes.
"I’m talking about Ron and myself."
"I have no reason to stay here." Harry tells him.
"Oh. I was dreaming." He said while he put his hands on his head. "What time is it? And why does my head hurt? Am I late?"
"Please." She moans. "Let me have it."
He isn’t shocked, but at this rate, Ron doesn’t understand why he can’t tell Harry all of this at all. It’s truly baffling to him.
"What do you think?"
“Oh my God, have I been this fucking stupid?!” He angrily asks himself.
"You're the one who's leaving?" A hurt Draco asks him. "When are you leaving?"
Draco chuckles. "Well, at least you now know that Inferno is a dirty dog. Inferno is-"
"Yeah."
“Actually, you were the only one who was truly worried.” Ron states.
"Uh- I think I'll get a bowl of pasta." Draco said.
"Ronald, don't be so loud!" Hermione snapped rushing over to Tori. "She's only three months old, and she's not prepared to hear any hollering from you yet.
"What?! On the first fucking date?!" An outraged Draco asks.
Suddenly the charms chimed when the door opened and Neville glanced out of the staff room.
"Come on!" Draco yelled in frustration as he's driving to Harry's house.
"It shows?!" He says, completely embarrassed as he pulls out a mirror out of his desk drawer, thinking that the songs had given him away.
"Hey! I disagree with that statement!" Draco argues with a pout on his face.
Bonding As A Family
"What?" Draco countered. He wasn't expecting that question at all.
“Is something wrong?” Draco asks, worried that he’s hurt Harry.
This goes on for a full six minutes, until Draco pulls out Harry’s leaking cock out of his briefs.
"Yes you can, Draco. Don't let it scare you."
because it's a mixture of a
Ron pouts.
"Not at all." Harry laughs. "I just wanted to brag, since he always calls and brag about his hookup, at the end of his romp."
"That certainly is true." He conceded. "I need to find a job."
"Have you seen Harry at all?" Hermione asked Sirius.
They go at it for a while until
“You love him, don’t you?” She kindly asks him and waits for Draco’s response.
"Being so damn cute."
"Let’s take them down, my friend." Harry says.
"Hi, cutie pie." Harry said making Tori smile and coo loudly at him. Tori moved her arms wildly, so Harry gives her the stuffed animal. "So, what kind of dresses did you see?"
"Here." Harry says bringing out a platter.
“That never works anymore.” Draco says with a pout on his face. “Anyway, what do you say to hanging out with Harry again?”
"Hermione, hi! What's going on?" Sirius says from the other side of the line, with a smile on his face.
"I know I am." Hermione says in total glee.
"Awesome." She says hugging him. "So how will you tell Draco the rest of the story after he finds out that you're leaving?" She asks him, pulling away from the hug.
"Draco, I can assure you that the guy that you were with was a total douche nugget. Harry is different. He's just like you to be honest. He simply wants someone to love him for him and not just for his bank account. You just want someone to love you, truly love and take care of you and Tori. I promise you that Harry isn't like that and he's one of the sweetest guys in the world."
"I get off in a few minutes, so we'll be leaving in a little but." Harry said a few minutes later when she fell back asleep.
"Thanks." Dean says humbly. "And who is this lovely one?"
"Awesome!" Ron says ignoring the argument. “Maybe he knows a girl he can set me up with since your wingman game is……rubbish. I keep on forgetting to ask him if he knows someone.”
He leans down and gives Draco a filthy kiss as he is riding him like there’s no tomorrow.
"Oh, I'm well aware of that." Hermione says as she's trying to mask her sadness. After all, she's going to be at a job without her best friend. "I can't believe that you're doing this to me. Driving across the country without me."
"Welcome and good evening." Justin greets. "Tonight will be the best date of your-"
"I do!" Draco said earnestly. "I just have a hard time letting people in. The last guy I let in literally left me. He just vanished without a trace, leaning Tori and I to fend for ourselves. I'm just scared that I'll get hurt again, and I definitely don't want Tori to get hurt like that either."
is a mixture of a
"Really?" He asks with an eyebrow raised.
“Thanks.” Harry replies, hoping he sounds like a normal 34 year old businessman. While Inferno goes to make Harry his drink, Harry pulls out his phone, and calls Draco. Draco answers on the first ring.
"The cooking, movies, eggnog and the occasional mistletoe."
"First of all, I said that you were invited to Hermione's party. I never said that you had to go. No one forced a gun to your head and make you go to the party. Secondly, I'm sorry that I didn't tell you, but I thought that you deserved to hear it from Harry himself. If I had told you the truth about that party, you never would have gone."
“Draco.” Harry greets.
"She really likes you. Are you helping Draco take care of him?" Lily asks.
"Draco?" He hears, snapping him out of his thoughts.
"What am I doing?" He asked himself. "Why am I doing this?"
"Why not?" He asks himself, with a small smile on his face, and he gets out of his bed. "It's only 12: 17 in the morning. I'm pretty sure that no single person sleeps at 12 in the morning anyway."
She was his rock.
"In a moment." Draco said as he was burping his daughter. As he was burping his daughter, Victoria smiled at Harry.
"But it was cute." Draco said.
"Hey, Potter. What's going on with you?"
"Yeah."
"That's only three things. What's the fourth?" Harry asks.
“God, you’re so amazing.” Draco groans.
"I'm Draco Malfoy, and thank you for the muffin." He said shaking her hand. "You've already met Victoria."
“No problem.” Draco says as he lets Harry lay his head on his shoulder.
"So......where's your lover boy tonight?" Harry inquires.
"I'm back." Harry said as he held two plates.
from Harry himself." Ron jokes as he winks at Harry.
"Really? You think that'll work?" He asks Ron hopefully.
"Newsflash, Draco: It didn't change anything at all! I really don't want to play this stupid game anymore. I don't want to play this game of cat and mouse with you anymore either. Look, I have to do what's best for me right now, and that's getting away from New York and living my life on my own terms without any distractions or problems."
Dear Diary,
“See you later. It was nice meeting you, Ms. Granger. I hope we can hang out again soon!" Draco says while hugging her.
"Whatever it is, I bet you that Harry here wanted one from Inferno himself, better yet,
"Alright!" Draco said as he hopes that the surprise was a good one.
"And we don't have all of that?" Draco dejectedly asks. "You're honestly going to tell me that we don't have all of those things?"
"How about we eat?" Draco suggests. "I'm dying to eat some of your cooking. It's been a while since I've eaten your cooking."
"Awesome!" Draco says throwing his hands in the air as if he's won the lottery.
I could go on and on, but I think that’s good enough because you’re a constant/permanent part of me. What I love about our relationship is that it’s never truly been complicated. It was always a give and take, like an unofficial couple that were meant to be. My favorite memory of us…..it was when Mariah Carey’s
That doesn't sound like the Draco that Ron knows at all.
“Sorry, Hermione.” Draco says apologetically in a small voice.
Draco nods his head.
"Anyway, I came to ask you if Harry called or dropped by. Apparently, he's been missing since last night, and his friend Hermione, said that he missed a critical meeting at firm today." Draco says in a single breath.
"I promise that I won't yell anymore." Ron said, but the moment he turned, he saw a little spider crawling on the walk and he shrieked loudly causing Tori to cry again. At that moment, Hermione pulled Tori into the kitchen as Draco glared at the red haired man.
"Of course because you are the size of Santa." Draco said sarcastically.
I'd love you to love me
“Thank you for a wonderful birthday.” Harry says after they’ve calmed down.
"So, how do you think Tori will look when she grows?"
"Draco, tell me more about this party you're throwing for our dear old Harry here." Hermione says.
"Yup. It's not my cup of tea."
"I'm going to set them up on an amazing date."
"It won't cost too much, will it?"
“I called in the middle of your fuck fest didn’t I?”
"Tori, give me that pretty smile of yours." Draco said as Harry made funny faces. As Harry was making funny faces, Tori moved her fists happily in a quick motion.
A moment later, Harry is running his hands on Draco’s ass cheeks as they are heavily making out.
"He went out with Neville. He needed help planning something for his twin brothers."
"Yup, and it's tomorrow at 2."
"Enjoy your food." Luna says, smiling directly at Harry before she turns away.
He disconnects the call and turns off his phone.
"Harry." Ron says.
He didn't give a fuck about any of the guys that he was sleeping with at all. In that moment, Draco came to a realization. Meeting up with these men, sleeping with them, and leaving them never to contact them again, only made him feel bad about himself. This wasn't the life that he wanted, especially at 35. He just turned 35 a couple of weeks ago, and this is not how he pictured his life. Years ago, he believed that he would be married and living a great life with Cormac, but now, he thought that it was time to stop hidding from himself in the beds of strange men. He wasn't a fan of that person and he knew deep down that things needed to change ASAP.
And I hope that we’ll never part.
"Muy caliente!" Ron answers in Spanish as he sports a devilish smile while wagging his eyebrows.
