Slowly, Draco does everything he knows he likes. He pulls on Potter’s ballsack, gently, then firmly, then – seeing what strong positive responses this receives – hard. He tries a touch of gentle tooth play. He varies the pressure in his mouth. He uses his nails gently against Potter’s sensitive skin. He hums multiple times, using it as a way to indicate that he is moving to show off a different technique.
“Not that, not anything in particular,” Harry said, petting back Draco’s hair. “Just, I dunno, anything. Some crisis I don’t know how to handle.”
The Healer shivered, and Harry cringed. So far he hadn't bothered sharing his slaves around. Truthfully, he hadn't given the idea much thought. And while he loved the idea of fucking lots of pretty girls and boys he met out in Hogsmeade or Diagon, he wasn't quite ready for that yet. There was, after all, the not unimportant matter that - in comparing his dick with porn stars, and Malfoy's, and that ugly yellow dildo Scrivener had brought, he'd learned that his cock wasn't very big. He was thinking surely magic could fix that, but he'd never happened upon a spell that would enlarge his dick, and he was loathe - unsurprisingly with this one - to ask Hermione for help.
and a door slightly ajar. Then he started scrambling eggs and woke his client via carefully directed scents.
Adjusting to the real Harry was something Draco had never once thought to fantasize about. It was simultaneously heartrendingly amazing, and utterly bizarre. It felt like apparating somewhere new, with no map, where no one spoke any of the languages he knew.

Stripping down to nothing, Draco pulled that extra blanket from the hamper and put it back on his bed — careful to put the same, dirty side up. Then he picked up his very best dildo and slicked the ribbed, tempered glass slowly and generously with his wand. He’d come so recently, it was worth the extra care this dildo required. Then he lay down in the center of his large bed and started to work the glass shaft into his body. Stroking his cock as he pressed the dildo in and pulled it out, Draco closed his eyes and pictured Harry over him. “Mmm…” he hummed, trying to choose what Harry should say. Maybe “Open for my cock, Draco. I need to come, and your arse is just the right place to shove my dick, isn’t it?”
Draco sniffed. “I know.” But the snap of his neck and shoulders softened, and the blush high on his cheekbones went from sharp to flattering.
seriously. You know what matters to me, Draco? My time. My happiness. My work. But my built-up, media-made reputation? With random wizards? People I’ll never meet? Pfft. Like I’d turn you away because of something one or a dozen or even a thousand strangers

"Two sets of labia, the inner and outer lips," Afelgate said, showing Harry what these were. "Clitoris. As sensitive as a cockhead, but the rest of that cock-like tissue is inside her body, not outside, like you and I." He rubbed tentatively at Mouth's clitoris, and when she sighed slightly, he rubbed harder. "This is where women get sexual pleasure," he told Harry seriously. "The nice thing about a sex slave is that while you certainly don't have to care about her sexual pleasure, you can nonetheless learn from her body. I assume the Wizengamot explained that they want you to eventually father a lot of babies."
Mother paused and poured herself more wine. She drank some, then still did not speak. Draco squeezed her hand and waited.
“As always, your penis is very handsome, and your erection is more than large enough to keep you in my service.” Draco strokes him wistfully, and – unable to resist – reaches around to caress Finnegan’s muscular arse.
"Jewelry," the Merchieftainess said with authority. "He has many wives." She made a tiny snorting noise and shook her hair, which waved gracefully behind her. Some of her warriors frowned, and two or three swam a foot or two closer to her. This appeared to be some sort of strong political or cultural disagreement. Harry noted it, but didn't have any idea what it might mean for him and Malfoy, now or later.
"I've been thinking about all the things we were both saying," Harry confessed, not able to look at Draco. Instead he looked at his own hands, clasped earnestly -- almost ridiculously -- in front of himself. "I haven't been willing to quit my job because, well, basically, what the hell else would I do? I know from when they make me take holiday, I go a bit nutty without work." He felt himself blush, but Draco murmured something encouraging sounding, so he kept bumbling forward.
Soon Bisky had them settled with tea, their greetings and other pleasantries had been dispensed with, and they were ready to hear one another.
Too soon, Potter makes a trembling sound, and Draco knows Potter is on the verge of coming. Coming hard into Draco’s nearly virgin arse. Potter speeds his thrusts, and Draco feels his arse accept and welcome Potter’s beautiful brutality.
“Quite so,” Mother agreed, “therefore, Dizon will be meeting me at Cellenina’s home, in Rabat. We plan to slowly portkey southward together, through Africa.”
Draco woke up a short time later, judging by the height of the sun in the sky. Sighing with pleasure and regret, he pulled the dildo from his arse. That had been satisfying, but now his extra blanket was completely disgusting, and he needed a shower. He cast a short series of spells to sterilize his dildo and return it to its box under the bed. He pulled the extra blanket off, again, and wrinkled his nose at it. No time for laundry right now, if he was going to get anything else done today. Shoving the blanket to the bottom of the hamper, he made do with a few spells and soon his bed at least looked pristine and freshly neatened.
“I have been taught all my life that homosexuality is a horror. My son has… a boyfriend. The most desirable young bachelor in the nation. And I am realizing I was taught things that are, simply, wrong.
They waved at him distractedly and he waved back, then filled his Muggle travel carafe (spelled to never spill) with hot Earl Grey and milk and got to work on the Goblin Security Situation, as he had come to think of it.
"Well," the healer said slowly, staring at Harry now, apparently feeling him out on this, "I looked over their medical records before I came here, and there are no thorough physical examinations on record for either of them since before they reached this stage of life. Her last thorough exam was when she was eleven, from just before she began Hogwarts. It no longer holds much medical value.
Draco felt his eyes nearly bug out. He’d been holding back words like that for weeks, terrified Harry would not be able to return them.
around except Minerva McGonagall. That crap Snape's wraith was spewing about my reputation? All true."
"I know all that," Draco said with a forced calm, "but when we finally get there, bring the ring to McGonagall, what the hell do we do next?"
As Severus had warmed to his subject, he easily dismissed all of Draco's concerns and reservations, while at the same time, chilling him deeply.
“I want to be there with you for that,” Harry stated calmly, like he was merely suggesting a new brand of tea.
Malfoy stared into Harry's eyes for another long moment. Harry didn't know what Malfoy was looking for, but he tried to project an air of confidence and sincerity. He assumed the arousal was so present he wouldn't need to do anything to help Malfoy see it. Malfoy was quiet and Harry didn't have any grasp on what the other boy was thinking. Then Malfoy nodded, and to his surprise, Harry felt a small spike of fear mingled in with his relief. No turning back, now. But what were they going to do?
"He began to push hard all around Mouth's belly. Then he took up his wand, waved it, and frowned at the result.

"As you can probably infer from the historical record, Lily refused my ring. Furious at her stupidity, I threw it into the Black Lake. That night I left Hogwarts forever and swore myself in service to the Dark Lord himself." The Hat seemed to sigh, then straighten. The pointy tip stood taller for a moment.
Draco couldn’t afford a permanent laboratory setup in his little flat, but he was a very careful brewer and he didn’t bother much with cooking, so he was willing to share his kitchen with his passion. He assiduously cleaned up his breakfast and got to work laying out everything he needed to experiment with Prazosin again. He’d finished separating out all ten of the inactive ingredients last month. He was pretty sure he’d determined just last Saturday which part of the molecular structure of the Prazosin hydrochloride was blocking its efficacy for magical patients. Now he needed to find a substitute. He had done a lot of applicable research on this before he had discovered Prazosin existed, so he was hopeful he might be close to a breakthrough already.
“Yes,” Mother said, looking at her plate. She spread her napkin over her lap again, though Draco would’ve bet a galleon it had already been perfectly aligned.
"It would depend primarily on the slave's innate magic. Only a fairly strong witch or wizard could sustain as many as three magical components to a slave tattoo. Since through history few strongly magical people have landed themselves in sexual slavery, it is rare for one to be capable of sustaining three. However, with your slaves, it would certainly be worth an attempt, if you wished. Historically speaking, their situation is quite unusual. Their age is a factor in your favour as well."
“She’d have loved you,” Aunt Andromeda said. She looked a little sad, and a little happy. Draco couldn’t quite understand.
Narcissa seemed oblivious to Harry’s thoughts. She also seemed unaware of her sister’s feelings. Harry could see Andromeda starting to bristle. Narcissa — and she had seemed so
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Draco yawned discreetly behind his other hand and then pressed himself a bit more closely into Harry's naked skin. "Sadly, there will be no morning quickie. I have to be downstairs for breakfast in a little more than an hour, or Mother will be in here and wanting to know why the room reeks of sex. And you have to look for the damn relic with me. I have quite a few old metal things in here. I really have no idea which one it could be."
Even after everything that had already happened that day, he was still a bit shocked that she simply winked, gathered the guards, and left. He took a deep breath and looked at his new slaves. He knew exactly what he wanted first.
"Then we shall offer him jewelry in exchange," Malfoy said with assurance, and Harry felt oddly comforted by it.

Harry knew he was a short man, but Mouth was shorter than he was, and he liked that. She was short enough that her arse actually fell below his hand, when they stood next to each other shoeless. He put a hand on her waist and caressed her. "We're keeping this," he declared, and motioned for her to remove it. Dudders had finished strapping Hole into his costume, so Harry told him to put the nightie into a "keep" pile and he turned to examine his other slave.
He didn’t turn around when he heard Draco stir. Instead, he spoke, looking down at the careful circles he’d drawn, illustrating Janzorti’s Geomantic principle. “Sleep well?”
Harry liked it. It gave him excuses to punish Malfoy, for one thing, but more importantly he loved that Malfoy hated being here.
Harry’s man was an arse, and Harry was tired of it. Draco was possessive and dismissive. Solicitous, yet rude as hell. A homophobic arse-fucking machine.
Harry watched the bankers work, murmuring to each other in German, checking, cross-referencing, noting.

He wants to scream, either at the injustice or to express his physical pleasure, but no matter why he might, he cannot. And so, silent, Draco bears the theft of his virginity with tremendous grace and the fattest, hardest erection possible. It is wrapped up in the pad Potter has inadvertently made of Draco’s prison robes, pressed hard against the heavy table.
"I'm not gay, though," he blurted without thinking. "I mean, I'm… I might be bi?" He cringed again. He could see he was hurting Malfoy's feelings. It was written all over the other boy's face. But he wasn't gay! Surely he wasn't gay. Was he? He couldn't be gay if he didn't want to be gay! The hate-filled things Uncle Vernon used to say had always made it seem….
Harry wasn't wanking himself with his hand anymore. His left hand held him up a bit, and his right was stroking Draco's face. Then Harry pulled away just enough to whisper "I am going to come like a centaur any second, Draco. You still want to watch?"

“Then I’ll be testing your father’s assertions the old fashioned way,” the King said, and he moved to stand directly in front of Draco. “Unfasten my breeches, get me hard, then please me with your mouth. Your goal is to swallow my entire release.”
The King walked closer, and Draco finally found the fear needed to drop his eyes back to the floor. The King’s boots approached. He wore battle breeches, but the wool looked light and fine, and as black as the King’s deliciously wild hair.

The memory faded as Harry heard Mrs. Malfoy, walking from the nursery with Draco still in her arms, trying to explain to her husband how cute the shoes were.
“Dora,” she said, waving his fear away. “We can talk about her. I want to talk about her. Nothing’s quite so terrible as thinking she’s been forgotten.”
He tried the library. Sadly, “diffusion door” brought him nothing of use, and looking for spells regarding magical doorways and pass-thrus and other generic indicators brought him so

. A dull silver ornament that looked, perhaps, a bit like a knife, or - oddly enough - a Muggle letter-opener, wended its way through the air from a shelf on the other side of the room, falling dully into Harry's protected hand. It had a pattern with ten wands. It didn't look familiar.
Harry felt Draco’s cock firm swiftly against his own, so he grabbed Draco’s arse and rubbed their lengths together.
Draco admitted his fears. His disgust. His loss of place in the world. His ignorance in how to find or make a new one but for the surety that it required obtaining the perfect wife.
And it seemed to work. A few days went by without any annoying Malfoy nonsense. Harry continued his surreptitious but technically acceptable Pensieve wanks every night, and tried to look haughty every morning when he entered places where Malfoy might be looking at him.
“Draco,” Potter said quietly. “Even though there have been a lot of rumours and talk, I really was a virgin. I haven’t had sex with Ginny, or Neville, or anyone else you think I’ve had sex with. I was a virgin until we, er… made love last night.” Potter’s face bloomed bright rose red as he spoke the words ‘made love,’ but his eye contact didn’t waver once.
Harry revised so hard, so often, so seriously, even Hermione would sometimes put a hand to his forehead, worried. Harry would scowl, but allow it. Everyone would move on.
So he needed to decide whether or not to invite Harry in. Scratch that. He needed to decide whether or not to
As had swiftly become their custom, they held hands all the way down to breakfast. Harry observed some Hufflepuffs noticing their clasped hands as they approached a staircase that was slowly settling into place. One of the Hufflepuffs whispered something to a blonde head, and Harry suddenly felt sure they were talking about him and Neville.
But Draco stopped; made eye contact. “What… are we doing?” he whispered, sounding afraid to make noise, as though some authority might notice.
Draco pulled his face back enough to look Harry in the eye. He said nothing, just looked into Harry's eyes and thought, or something. If he was using Legilimency Harry couldn't feel it. "Okay," Draco finally said, and got up from the little bed. "I'll shower and dress," he said. And he stepped into the tiny bathroom and closed the door.
It is only in the desire to protect law and order that the Wizengamot grants Mr Potter this boon of a sexual slave in lieu of the standard and traditional reward of a national savior. And it is in humble gratitude that we accept his signature on this parchment and willingness to forgo his long-established and time-honored rights to otherwise take temporary sexual custody of anyone and everyone of age that he might choose.
Instead of continuing, Draco’s mother glanced around. Though she’d been quiet, Draco cast his own privacy spell.

"Fucking hell, Malfoy. You feel amazing, hot and tight, wet and wanting… you feel better than anything else. It's a good thing I just came a few minutes ago, or I'd be coming right this second."
Finishing a second cup, Harry looked over everything he’d written. Between Draco’s hellishly incriminating diary, bolstered by some things he’d written or said out loud, Draco wasn’t exactly coming across as heterosexual. No matter what he might be constantly declaring to anyone who would listen. What straight boy found girls revolting? And not particular girls: not mean ones, or exes, or even Muggleborns. Draco apparently thought all girls ‘gross’.
And thank Merlin for that, too, because with this being NEWT year, no one had time for all the detentions that would have arisen from them attempting to share the eighth year common room.
-" Severus had fairly hissed the name, "-was a bastard. May the gods eat his soul. Don't you know why you have no siblings?"
“If we’re stuck here for at least two days, we should explore multiple pleasant ways to pass the time. As you can see, I’ve thought of several already.”

“I have had little romance in my life,” Draco eventually murmured. “I would like to change that. But Mother… interferes. So does my history. Though I suppose if anyone could disregard my past, it would be you, hm?”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"Indeed," Harry said, grinning. He'd not really considered polyjuicing Hole into anyone, let alone a girl. That was a fairly brilliant idea. He could tell the healer knew he liked it, and that the healer had given it to him. Harry grinned conspiratorially at Afelgate, deciding the man deserved a nice tip at the end of all this.
“Draco explained how he and Harry both apologized, for all the terrible things they did to one another as boys.”
He’d had a promising start with vampire bat blood, so Draco decided to start there. He had already taken a week to slowly infuse thirty grams of Prazosin hydrochloride with it, so he set up simultaneous experiments for the changed substance to interact with his blood, his saliva, his stomach acid, and a small amount of distilled liquid magic he’d shelled out entirely too much cash for at a dodgy little shop just off Diagon. This took a solid hour, because Draco was nothing if not precise. When you were as skint as he, you had to be, as he often reflected. He simply couldn’t afford to waste a blessed drop of anything.
As they sat near the surveillance display eating stew, Draco flipped open a chart, and Harry’s eyes nearly bugged out.

He couldn't speak anymore, and Malfoy was pulling at him, kneeling up far higher, pulling Harry to a standing position, keeping a hand wrapped firmly around Harry's cock to keep from getting his throat filled but still, it was the rest of what Harry had said and he fucked enthusiastically away at Malfoy's pretty red mouth and gripping fist and came and came a gallon of come so hot and deep that his balls were going to be empty for days.
Nervous, Harry scuffed a foot against the baseboard as he walked. “We might have to just… lock both sides and forget it.”

“That’s right,” imaginary Harry said in a self-assured, demanding voice that was completely unlike the imaginary Harry who brought muffins to Draco’s kitchen. “I’m the King, and you’re my convenient, tight little fuck-hole.”
"Thanks," Harry mumbled, and reluctantly handed half the bar to Malfoy, who unpeeled a bit of the wrapper, took a bite and put it on his lap. Then both his hands went right back onto the steering wheel and his eyes stayed rigidly forward. He drove carefully, as though it required tremendous concentration. Harry couldn't think of a thing to say.

“Hm,” Neville tried, and he finished his scone. “What about that handsome blond guy in Ravenclaw, the seventh year. I think his name is Willem?”
Harry opened the door and Draco let Harry usher him inside, request a table, choose Draco’s chair and push it in.
warrior, Ma’am. I will wipe the courtroom clean with his past, his wrongdoings. He will go to jail, and he will stay there.”
"Potter, is that you?" Malfoy was sitting sideways at a desk looking out the window, wearing a rich-looking cream dressing gown over soft pyjamas. Harry was looking at his profile. The room was shadowy, but the moon was full.
“Y’know,” Harry mused as they read in bed before turning off the lights, “I think I’m honestly going to miss your Mum while she’s in South Africa.”
Mother flitted away, apparently willing to ignore his emotions as long as he complied. “Tomorrow, darling,” she called as she wandered off. “I will not attend dinner tonight. Too much to do before we go to Azkaban tomorrow. Emotional preparation. I highly recommend it.” Then she was gone, and Draco braced himself to enter Harry’s personal space and reclaim his mother’s stupid platter. If it even existed.
Unconcerned by Harry's question, the Hat continued. "I had not only purchased this ring for Lily, I had prepared it beforehand with potions and tinctures. They were designed to make the ring impervious to all damage, to protect your mother from harm, and to prove to the wearer, and all who observed her that she was… loved."
Relieved that Malfoy seemed to have at least some skill, Harry watched as the Merchieftainess nodded at Malfoy to continue. There was a magnanimity about her. Harry felt like she was so fully in charge that no one ever needed question it.
Dear Harry, I’m sure I am being quite ridiculous, but I can’t seem to do any potions work because I keep thinking you’ll stop by again. I’m sure you have far better things to do, so if you would please just let me know that, I can quiet my anxious mind and get back to work on this potions project.
Harry pulled his feet back under his own chair and gave Draco a far more intent, serious look. "That's not… tell me more, Draco."
Smiling wryly at his plate, Draco chewed his salmon. “That it was,” he eventually agreed, watching Harry cut up steak.
Harry was grateful for her sensitivity. He needed the break from their serious conversation, and he was impressed by Andromeda’s ability to read him and know, without him having to force out the words.

“After that Dizon wanted to show me Lake Nakuru, in Kenya. His friend Merlin Mwangi lives near there and is apparently very eager to meet me? So kind.”
“I was an arse,” Malfoy murmured to the floor. “But the sex was… brilliant. I miss it, even though we only had one night.” He looked shyly through his lovely pale fringe. Harry felt his resolve slip slightly.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Guard, dismissed,” the King said. Jonathan bowed once, clicked his heels and slipped away swiftly. Draco got the impression he didn’t want to be anywhere near the two of them any longer.
Rushing through the words he’d practiced, almost too fast to be heard, wand still raised, Harry stuttered out an apology he was afraid he wouldn’t say if he didn’t force it out immediately: “I’m so sorry I almost killed you I didn’t know what that spell did and that makes it worse I should never have done that I’m so sorry.”
“I hardly believe this night was real,” Draco said. “But to borrow your phrase, I feel we have started building something. Together.”
Draco stared at Harry, unable to respond. So Harry slipped down off the bed and, humming, pulled off Draco’s shoes and socks, one by one. He carefully inserted the socks into the shoes, as promised, then he stood and held out one hand. “Cuddle?” he asked.
“I’m serious!” Harry said, laughing. He pulled his cock out, slowly, sighing with pleasure as Draco’s tongue swirled lewdly around him. “This was just the only way to get all the other men to agree. Plus Bergum felt it would help you have the right attitude about all of us. You know, getting down on your knees for each and every one of us like this, once every week. Mmm. Love your mouth so much. Since you agreed, of course I take advantage of it. The other Aurors would never stop teasing me if I didn’t, and besides….”
As Draco spoke to Harry he unbuttoned his shirt. Harry felt his emotions clashing. Petulance at not getting his way was losing to lust and curiosity. What was Draco planning? What had he picked up in Whisper Alley? Was it those vials? What was in them? Harry suddenly realized while he was distracted, Draco had managed to completely remove his shirt and was now working on his belt.
Standing tall, Draco looked Harry in the eye and took a calculated risk. “I value your professional skills, but I hope you won’t feel offended if I admit my nervousness remains.”
At first he attempted to distract himself with magazines, but that didn't work at all. He didn't have a telly, which he thought perhaps he should do something about, but not today. Today he was so randy and jumpy he'd probably try to fuck any Muggle sales clerk that made to sell him a telly, and that might be a bad scene.
Harry though, began to kiss down Draco’s chest, his belly, his cock, and Draco couldn’t seem to find a way to stop him from taking Draco’s cock into his mouth. Again. Which was just wrong except that it felt so ridiculously wonderful.
Draco had sat in perfect, shocked horror. Severus seemed unaware of Draco's emotions and barreled onwards.

bad, Neville,” Harry said, walking between their beds and nudging at Neville’s foot with his knee. “Everything is easy now that you’re a big war hero.” Harry and Neville both rolled their eyes, and Harry sat down on his own bed and laughed quietly.
Eventually, finally feeling satisfied with his work and his week, Draco slipped the last form into an envelope which he marked for the attention of Auror Singh. As he sent it floating off to Singh’s work station, a shadow paused over Draco’s desk. Looking up, Draco was pleased to see Auror Potter, looking handsome as always, his face opening up with a satisfied, even greedy smile.
“You’ll see me in a fortnight, you mean. If you think I’m disappointing your mother and skipping Boxing Day tea, you are out of your tiny little mind.”
“Of course, darling,” his mother said, maddeningly nonchalant. “I am your mother. I rocked you to sleep, then I checked on you, then I set spells to watch over you.” She sipped at tea he hadn’t noticed.
with an odd mingling of bashfulness and relief. He tried to wipe it off his face before he turned and caught Malfoy's eye.
“Mu ha ha,” he joked to Draco when he eventually returned from International Portkey Departures. “This installation will take
“It isn’t your usual,” Draco said, calmly packing dishes. “But yes. My surveillance spells recorded the criminals and then ensnared them. Red-handed. Pity not all enemies engage in behavior my spells will capture, mm? But these fools? Putty in my hands.”
Casting his best privacy spell, Harry relaxed into his warm bed and slipped his pyjama bottoms down just enough to afford himself good access to his cock. He spat into his hand and began to slowly stroke the head of his own cock. Something was obviously very wrong with him, but he would worry about that later. Right now all he wanted was to forget everything the headmaster had said, and instead remember the way the blood had rushed into his cock when Draco Malfoy had pressed him into the wall and growled at him.
“Really?” Draco said, looking up from the desk he’d been searching. “But you said you were just reading it, and we left my house right after breakfast.”
Draco’s Grandfather Abraxas had been a man of action, as well. His track record, though, was perhaps a bit more checkered than even that of Regulus. He’d reportedly managed to help depose a Minister solely for being Muggle-born. But he had also been a respected Potions Master and scholar. And Draco knew that designation was definitely true. The other thing was an old rumour.
Draco woke shortly after Harry did, and went from cuddled close to Harry’s back, to leaping away and rushing to the shower with hardly a word spoken.
“Of course I do,” Draco sniffed. “Who wants to trouble with anti-STD spells all the time? It’s unsavoury. I’m too straight for fag diseases. I wouldn’t want Pomfrey to get the wrong idea.”
Draco insisted on stumbling upstairs on his own feet, but he wasn’t going to refuse Harry’s arm around his waist or the chance to put his own arm around Harry’s neck. At least one house-elf (possibly both?) followed behind discreetly, and it was Bippy that dressed Draco in silk nightclothes while Harry was in the loo.
“The house-elf?” Draco picked up the tomato, looking like he wanted it on his sandwich but didn’t understand how it became slices.
“Having you wait with me in the Auror department is reassuring. But I worry someone might enter the Manor,” Draco murmured back.
“Because the more I think about all this,” Harry said, his voice gentle, “the more I realize you impress the hell out of me.”
“I see,” McGonagall said, as inscrutable as ever, and pushed the plate of biscuits toward Harry, who thought

Harry was surprised to see that at this, Malfoy blushed a bit. “Thank you,” he said primly, and straightened his spine.
Dropping the replacement ring they had brought from Hogwarts, Draco grabbed Harry's arm, and without a word of explanation, Harry side alonged them directly into the submarine tent, splattering water and mud all over the inside. "We have to get out of here
“You said something,” Harry realized, trying to be mature about the situation, “about wanting Teddy to have allies?”
“Turning you down? Would make me a fool,” Harry continued. “After all, as I told you back at camp, I’ve had my eye on you for months. Merlin, Draco, you’re exactly my type. I even pointed out, just before we went home, how much I enjoy having sex with you.

"So not after that Yule Ball, then." Malfoy stayed silent. "You said you were gay. Why did you fuck her?"

Weasley comes with a small grunt of pleasure, and the slave takes his cock and come quietly, just as she should. She stumbles away when Weasley pats her head once, and – following orders – Weasley turns to face his Lord and display himself again, before putting his cock back inside his uniform and setting it all back to rights.
"I did ask, actually," Draco said, sounding despondent. "But she said that right now the only position she could justify filling was Binns' job, and we both agreed that I wasn't even remotely qualified to teach history."
“Or he made an assumption,” Neville said, understanding spreading across his face like a calming draught poured on a plate. “Yeah.” Neville stood up too, and walked to stand next to Harry at the window. The sun was coming out. “People make assumptions.”
He stared at Malfoy, whose blush rivaled his own. Harry stood tall. This was much more familiar ground. A girl? At his sexual mercy? For ten years? That was some sort of… porn movie. Exciting, but hard to believe.
“I knew that,” Draco scoffed unconvincingly. He finished his beer and stood, moved to peek over Harry’s shoulder. “I won’t learn anything all the way over there.”
Harry’s grin broadened. “Got it at a muggle home store and charmed it myself,” he said, and Draco looked into Harry’s mischievous, sparkling eyes and restrained himself from proposing marriage.
Weasley calls the men and they file in. His top twelve Guards, nude from the waist down, and most of them hard.

Finally, Draco was getting to see Harry’s cock! He touched it, and Harry sighed out, gustily. He gripped the shaft, planning to take the head right into his mouth, but he paused, unintentionally, just to look. He’d long imagined Harry’s dick as a great deal longer and fatter than his own. It was not. Judging by how it fit into Draco’s hand, it seemed it was probably the same width. If it was longer than his own, he didn’t yet have proof, but just from the look, he thought it might be. Just a little.
Harry allowed Draco to caress his arse, but he was still completely in charge of the movements of his hips. He fucked his cockhead over Draco’s lips and flat tongue over and over, carefully avoiding the entrance to Draco’s throat. He grasped his own shaft with his hand, perhaps to keep Draco from doing it, but did nothing to stimulate himself. He didn’t squeeze himself or rub. He took his goal of making this blowjob last very seriously indeed.
"But, regrettably, we cannot allow you to open that storefront, as much as we all might like you to. It would disturb the rebuilding, you see. We would
“I almost believe you,” he said, then wondered if that had been a good idea. Potter looked very surprised.
“The salient point is you have that space. I hereby claim it for myself, as well. Harry and I… are becoming quite serious about one another. He is everything I could ever want in a man.”
Harry stretched in self-satisfaction. He'd never felt so confident, sexually or otherwise. He liked it. "Frankly, not only does this seem like more fun, but I don't really doubt my ability to convince damn near anyone to bend over for me. Not after you
“Then we’ll have all the memories we need, and we’ll stay apart because we can get a Pensieve fix whenever we want.”
it, as such. Someone with his OWLS and NEWTS, not to mention background, language skills, and magical strength, should be an Auror (or a Healer or a Potions Master, etc.) not an office manager. But it was a truth he was forced to live with. He’d been on the wrong side of a terrible war, and high marks and brilliant test scores were nothing against that. So a lonely, underpaid office manager he was, and would be for the foreseeable future.
Sighing, Draco looked down at his straining trousers. That’s what he got for fantasizing at work again. He’d have to Floo home like this. He certainly wasn’t going to wank off in the loo. Not when his vibrator, dildo collection, comfy bed, and (best of all) the ability to strip off all these cheap, itchy work clothes awaited him in his tiny little London flat. At least he really was done for the week. He could stay up half the night masturbating, if he wanted.
Malfoy took the scroll and unrolled it gently. It was ancient, and parts were a bit hard to make out. Harry wasn't touching it, but if he'd been asked to guess, he'd have said it was probably made of some type of leather. Malfoy was holding it gingerly. The merpeople mostly looked like they trusted him not to damage it, but one or two seemed to be looking at Malfoy with real suspicion, despite the approval he'd received from the Merchieftainess. Harry made sure his wand was still firmly in his hand.
They drank sweet wine and lingered in the tub, talking over their experiences of the crime, investigation and trial and considering possible aftermaths.
Harry shook his head ‘no.’ Draco’s eyes had adjusted enough to see the confusion and… was that a little dismay on Harry’s face? Draco kissed him once, petted his hair. “I can’t believe how… easy-going you are,” Draco explained.
The King liked when Draco coordinated his mouth and hand to simulate a slow fuck. He also liked it when Draco sped up.
“You’re sad!” Draco exclaimed, twisting his hands like an old grandmother on the telly. Harry stared at the motions.
“I’d say…” Harry pretended to think. “I can’t come until you’re done looking them over. And you come second. After I come, then kneel in front of you.”
But how the hell did he point this out to Draco when he couldn’t admit to snooping into Draco’s private diary?
Then Draco reaches forward with both hands and grabs Potter’s arse, wordlessly encouraging him to let go and fuck Draco’s throat until he comes down it.

“I suppose.” Draco said calmly, like the answer meant nothing. “Finding out could be a fun diversion.”
"I was asking for a private room, as payment for doing this. Dumbledore agreed. He actually said prefects used to get them as a matter of course, and there was enough space for me to have one. I also asked to have a room that I could enter through the hallway as well as through Slytherin, because, I said, I was afraid of how my housemates might react to my change of loyalties. He said I could have that as well, and he seemed most concerned for my safety. So you see what this means, Harry? We'll be back at school, for the entire rest of break, and I'll have a private room. You will be able to just knock on my door."
Harry had claimed to have a lot of pent up adrenaline, but so far he wasn’t at all interested in showing it. Instead, he’d slid his enormous cock into Draco beautifully deep, then pulled out, but only slightly. He crowded even closer to Draco, pressing Draco’s whole body into the wall. His strokes resumed, short and deep, like he was trying to burrow into Draco’s core. “Mmm,” he hummed into Draco’s ear. “I’m further in than usual, aren’t I?”
"But if Potter's undeserved reputation can enhance Draco's, then all the better. Draco has enough stacked against him these days. And don't even try to tell me he can overcome it! Nothing you say, no N.E.W.T. scores, no 'highest honours' certificate from stupid Hogwarts will overcome what Lucius saddled that boy with!"
Harry couldn't stand it anymore. In a strangled voice, he managed "Bloody hell, Malfoy…" and carelessly yanked off his remaining clothes. Malfoy looked a bit disappointed and Harry, now nude, grabbed the other boy around the torso and rubbed their warm chests together.
"I am glad to see you gentlemen." She was looking up from her desk, sounding stern and stressed. Harry recognized the attitude. Robards tended to adopt it when a case was going badly.

are nothing but trouble,” Draco said, pointing at Harry, warming to his subject. “You’re feminine, unnatural, you don’t have children! Men like you are… girly, simpering cowards!”
Harry kissed Draco one more time. This time on the mouth. His cock was starting to slip from Draco’s arse and Draco kissed Harry back as intently as he wanted. He gave no thought whatsoever to the next moment, only poured his satisfaction and joy into Harry’s mouth the way Harry had poured come into Draco’s arse.
The silence felt like it was choking him, and Harry decided that he was supposed to be a fucking Gryffindor and opened his mouth abruptly.
"Would you please clean yourself, sir?" She was blushing slightly. "You were napping, not showering."
. He wanted to pounce on Harry’s invitation, and he wanted to calmly reach out and take the blueberry muffin, but he wanted to hide and hyperventilate in a cupboard almost as much.

"We'll be doing that again," Harry said happily, and both slaves giggled. Giggled! "I love this reward system," Harry said happily. "I want a nap. Nap with me. If I like having you in my bed, I'll reward you."
“You’ve been through a horrible experience for which you were wholly unprepared. Your mother is at sea in a post-war world. Your father is not only not a source of guidance, your association with him damages your reputation. You need counsel you trust. Not only to put you first, but to know what direction in which to point you. For career, life-planning, politics, reputation, even a suitable match. Is this a good beginning?”
“Oh,” Harry said after a moment, and concentrated on cleaning around the new sofa for a moment, before he sat down and pressed himself against the arm on the left side.

Narcissa finished her tea and poured herself some more. She stared out the window. She traced the pattern on the chair’s upholstery once again.
Draco stomped out of his flat, locking the door behind him. He stomped down the hall to the lift and stomped four doors down the street to the owl rental place. It would have been easier to borrow Mrs Kishar’s owl, like he had when he had come over ill, but he didn’t like to overstep. That morning had been an emergency.
“And dinner was more than ‘edible’,” Harry continued, pulling Draco around to stand right in front of him. He held onto both Draco’s hands and looked him right in the eye. “I want you to know, I’ve noticed how the menu around here has changed since I moved in. We had Shepherd’s pie Tuesday, Beef stew last week, most nights we have brown rice or potatoes, there was Spag Bol, chicken with noodles….”
"I don't accommodate the call for a particular auror very often. There has to be a damn good reason." Robards unlaced his fingers from behind his head just enough to look Harry in the eye again. Harry made sure he saw a junior auror, sitting up straight at the edge of his metal folding chair, exuding eagerness and obedience. Robards sighed and looked up the ceiling again.
The Litigator was taking notes. “Can you think of anyone, student or teacher, who might have similar memories of him?”
Draco seemed stunned by this unexpected explanation. He sat, silent and staring, still holding the tomato.
So, he did not date. He did not have sex, either, for that matter. He was, obviously, too busy. And he didn’t need that. And it was just too painful anyway. Things like dating offered only opportunities for mistakes.
“Then why would I be jealous? What I actually am, is surprised. Parkinson doesn’t seem to be any more likely to enjoy something that Muggle than I thought you were.”
Harry couldn't have told you what colour it was, some sort of pink, maybe. But in his opinion it was a good colour for
“Harry,” barked Neville’s Newfoundland patronus, coming through the wall. “We caught the perpetrator. Please bring Malfoy downtown.”

kitchen – Draco poured some cold milk into the tea for something to do. Then he stared at the sugary muffins instead of looking into Harry’s face.
He looked… interested. “You like what you see?” he asked, and Draco integrated this into his mind. Did the King… care? What he thought? It seemed that he did. He nodded and was thrilled to see the King smile.
Harry managed not to do a fist pump in front of his boss, but he could feel a vibration of excitement start in the soles of his feet, and he tried not to bounce and jiggle. He forced himself to sit still and listen.

Entering, Draco saw Harry’s room and bed were the same size and shape as the guest’s. “A poor master bedroom,” he murmured, then blushed deeply.
Draco looked at his nails briefly, then put the hand on the opposite edge of the door. He suddenly looked like a photograph in a frame and Harry wondered where that idea had come from.
"So if you want a girl who isn't a virgin, you can add her to your program yourself. That's not law, that's just… a honor for you. The virgins, I mean. But the babies? We want your bloodline all over these Isles, Mr Potter. It is understood that a man like you, well." Afelgate spread out both his hands. "Your magic, your courage, your abilities… we want dozens and dozens of children to inherit your qualities, Mr Potter. The ministry will give each mother a large stipend, and they will keep careful track of all the babies as they grow. They might even choose to set up a special school just for your children, should you father enough. At least, I've heard gossip about that around Mungo's."

Putting down dinner so he wouldn’t choke on it, Harry devoured Draco’s list with his eyes. He knew already, they would try everything.
Harry followed, pressing fingertips into his thighs, bobbing his head. He was hard. He craved Draco’s smell, shape, getting pounded. But sucking him was good. Their bargain of a cock-sucking for every arse-pounding was smart. Even if this position tired his neck.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Instead, slowly stroking himself root to tip, Draco sank into one of his favourite fantasies. Which, he took pains to explain to himself on a semi-weekly basis, was purely a fantasy and said nothing of any importance about Draco’s reality.
“No more cumbersome trips because we left behind a damn umbrella or cloak or whatever in our other house,” Harry added.
was pathetic. The parchment was smudged, the handwriting messy, and the missive itself pitiful. Harry read it once, then had to sit to read it again, slowly, just to believe.
Soon Harry slowed down his thrusts and pounded Draco’s arse really hard, staying all the way inside Draco’s arse for long heartbeats before pulling out and slamming back in again.
think it’s time for us lie down and come together,” Harry husked into Draco’s ear, and Draco could only nod and lie down. The cushioning charm was perfect and Draco knew this could finally be his first proper fuck. They were alone, they weren’t expected, and Harry deserved to fuck him. He spread his legs and pulled Harry onto his chest, between his legs, over him, dominating him, as was proper.
She shuffled through and pulled out a bit of parchment. She muttered and tapped it with her wand, and through the thin vellum Harry saw that a few more words appeared.
Draco smoothed out his expression quickly, then nodded. “I’d be pleased,” he said with little inflection, and Harry felt his shoulders drop in relief.

“But you’re really… fit. Everywhere.” Harry said, looking directly into Draco’s eyes. “Your legs, your chest, your neck….”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“I have pleasured only one man with my mouth,” Draco admits. “But that man is myself, and that has given me the opportunity to learn everything you require in an employee.”
“So,” Draco said, buttering his bread, “First I went to the Three Broomsticks to speak with Madame Rosmerta….”
“I suppose it isn’t rational, but… earlier, when you declared me the perfect boyfriend… you know that is actually you, do you not?”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“Good?” Potter asked, his voice low and dark. Draco nodded. He didn’t know exactly what he looked like, but he was wearing tight, white trousers and a shiny, silvery shirt that seemed more like shreds than clothing. Yet, it did not come off. He moved tentatively to the music Potter had chosen, and Potter grinned widely at him. One wall of the office had become a large mirror, and they both faced it. Draco blushed to see how Potter had lined his grey eyes with kohl and accentuated his sharp cheekbones with glitter. Potter, on the other hand, wore no makeup at all, and his clothes were all quite simple and black. And tight. Extremely tight.
Then Draco’s mother burst into a deluge of tears, and, helpless, he took her in his arms and let her cry.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Draco’s perfect blowjob fantasy faded as he contemplated knocking on Harry’s front door. What if Harry wasn’t home? Worse, what if Harry wasn’t alone? It was hard enough to long for the same man half of magical Britain wanted when you were never, ever going to do anything about it. Doing something about it? Why, the very idea filled Draco’s guts with leaden butterflies. No, nothing would be done, no matter what he wanted. Working near Potter was going to have to be enough.
Nonetheless, Draco was quite surprised to find Harry Potter waiting for him in the hallway outside Slytherin when he and Pansy stepped out the next morning.
“It’s been over a dozen years, Draco. I’m not who I was at nineteen. Back then, I thought I needed a man. I was wrong. I’ve excised that part of myself. It’s gone. My life is full without romantic love. I’ve no need of it, and I’ve lost the will to risk my heart, or what’s left of it.”
Harry watched the tight spheres of his boyfriend’s arse flex in his well-fitting trousers as he walked away. Then, chuckling at himself, he shook off the distraction to follow Draco into the sitting room.
“Of course I do,” Draco said, and now he sounded… annoyed? “It’s a big, beautiful house, and it’s mine. Where else would I live?”
"You want to be rimmed?" Hole asked, back to stroking Harry's dick now that he was naked and under the covers.
“I thought I’d play a bit, see if I could hold you off temporarily. But Merlin if you aren’t the coolest cucumber… ever. I can’t wait another moment. Bedroom?”
“I won’t say no,” Harry said, grinning wide as he pulled off his long-sleeved top. “But after fucking your brains out, I could’ve run a marathon. Staying awake for seven extra hours was easy.”
“She loved almost everyone,” Andromeda said, and winked at him. “She was rather the perfect Hufflepuff.”
Harry breathed heavily, as Draco continued to tease him. A tongue touch here, a fingertip there. “But I’m keeping you from your chores,” he eventually whispered.
Worse, the damn Sorting Hat was there too, still speaking with Snape's pinched mouth. McGonagall, despite her usual kind firmness, seemed almost eager to get rid of the two young men, and Harry felt a bit powerless to stop the rollercoaster. So he learned how to use the tent, how to use the tiny kitchen, how to operate the emergency hatch and where the chocolate was.
She smiled gently. “I think the first sleeptalk I heard from you was lyrics to your favourite lullaby.”
Harry couldn't do anything but moan and then nod into Malfoy's neck. He took a moment to gather a bit of composure, then pushed up on one hand and looked Malfoy in the eye. "Just tell me how, Malfoy."

Thank you, Ms Granger,” Narcissa said, shaking hands and smiling for the first time since the attack.
Robards leaned back in his swivelly chair. He seemed, for once, to be in no hurry to run roughshod over Harry's objections. Harry tried to come up with some.
“Harry,” Lavender said quietly, leaning across the table. “I’d like to introduce you to my dear friend William.”
Harry returned to his room and felt himself deflate, suddenly exhausted all over again. He put his recordings in his Pensieve, put the DADA notes he barely remembered on his desk. Then he fell onto his bed, still fully dressed, and did not wake until Ron and Hermione banged on his door, just before lunch.

"Indeed," Draco said. Then he straightened his back and stood a bit closer to Harry. He spoke, however, to McGonagall.

"I feel awful now that I understand how much the people at Hogwarts are really suffering," Harry said, turning to Draco. "I'm glad we were able to get to the Mediterranean faster, but McGonagall thought we were going to find the ring in the Black Lake, which means the wraith would have been gone a few days ago already. She didn't say anything about trips to hospital in the letter she sent Robards."
Harry was as beautiful as Draco reluctantly recalled. He was as responsive, as eager, as good at kissing as he had been from the beginning. His ability to get Draco so hard he couldn’t think had only improved while they had been apart.
Harry should probably have taken a deep breath. "Don't you think this is weird?" he demanded instead, then flushed. They sat side by side in cramped captain's chairs. They were surrounded by dials, cupboards, shelves, stacks and displays. Malfoy perched in front of a small wheel, Harry in front of a set of somewhat interactive maps and view screens that showed all the other sides of the ship. They both had a good view of what was right in front of them. Nonetheless, the little drivable swimming tent thing felt claustrophobic already.
"Marvelous!" the Merchieftainess exclaimed, and dropped her end of the scroll. She swam forward enough to take Malfoy's left hand and Harry's right into her own hands, dragging the two wizards closer to one another. "And now you will make a copy for yourselves!" She declared, sounding joyous.
Harry sighed and stepped closer to the Floo. Draco waved his wand and murmured a reopening spell, and Harry knew nothing was keeping him there except his own manners.
“No, ma’am,” Draco said, heart sinking deep into his belly. No advantageous lie came to mind. “Grandfather Abraxas,” he admitted.
He had a sudden vision of her serving him dinner in the dress, and him turning her into the second course, right there over the table.
Draco’s sweat pooled. His brain slowed down. This wasn’t actually happening.  Draco couldn’t be here, right now, with
“More than,” Harry said, and now he was grinning ear to ear. “Though walking will be a little uncomfortable for a moment. But I can handle it, if it means a repeat of last night, and getting to walk into the Great Hall with you, holding your hand.” He squeezed Draco’s hand and looked up into Draco’s eyes, hope in his eyes and pink in his cheeks.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Draco climbed down. “I apologize, Mother,” he said, without elaborating. “I trust tea was pleasant?”
Harry lay on his back and gestured for both slaves to stand and remove their chains and loincloths. "Thanks, Kreacher. I'll want to eat eventually, but for now, just go back to the library, all right? I really want that spell I asked you to find."
“I am sorry,” he finally said, wondering if he would even be heard over the increasing volume of his mother’s fury.
Next in line is Justin Finch-Fletchley. His erection is thick and hard, and Draco caresses it with some pleasure. “A fine cock for my Guard,” he says with approval. “I suggest you go find someone to help you enjoy this.”
“Marvelous,” Narcissa said, her smile soft. “I am proud of you, son.” She finished her own tuna steak and patted her mouth with her napkin. “I shall soon be bragging about you to Dizon.”
He heard his mother forcefully regulate her breathing as the man who’d longed for years to physically and sexually assault her, blathered on about what a shame it was that he’d been unable to do so. And how much he “loved” her.
“Your attitude has certainly done a 180,” Harry said, choosing to see where an aloof pose might get him.
The Merchieftainess turned her head and nodded at a merman near her, who swam off and entered the largest building in the village. "He will fetch my map," she said. Then she frowned. "Will you be able to duplicate it? It is my only copy." The merman emerged again almost immediately, holding a rolled scroll.
He supposed it wasn't a good sign that he was already so accustomed to their sexy, ridiculous, little outfits. He preened internally then, realizing that the annoying little healer had an erection now that Harry could see even though those awful lime green robes. For
“Indeed,” Draco sighed, now staring at the table. He’d straightened his pajamas while Harry – facing away – had plated the eggs. Harry felt the lack of that little glimpse of skin, even as he strove to maintain professional distance.
“This was a terrible error and it must never happen again!” Draco declared imperiously, searching his mind for his imaginary crown.

She took his hand and put it on her naked waist. "Mr Potter was asking you before, you know, how I measure up? But I didn't really hear your answer." She pouted at him, and he melted a bit. Harry reached for his own crotch, then decided to cast his own blurring charm. Sufficiently obscured, he walked over to the couch and called Hole over to fondle his balls and breathe on his cock. He was going to do his best not to come until the healer had left the house.
“Be real,” he said, firmly. “Not the façade you put on to pacify Father, to satisfy his social climbing. You want a grandchild? I’ve long dreamed of fatherhood. I don’t know how, without a wife, but it is a goal. I promise.”

Harry would not be capable of a sincere apology at Malfoy’s fucking torture mansion. Not even for almost slicing Malfoy to death. Accidentally! Which at first Harry thought was a mitigating factor, until he decided it made everything far worse.
Did Harry feel, like a lot of Muggles apparently did, that being gay was outside the norm, strange, even hard to accept? Draco remembered how Harry had explained the Nazis and the pink triangles and forced himself to breathe carefully and deeply, so as not to vomit.
Harry came so fast he thought he might deserve an award. Snorting at his stupidity, he washed his hands, pulled up his pajamas, brushed his teeth and tiptoed back into his bedroom.
Bippy laid out silk nightclothes for Harry as well, and Draco was quite miffed to see, when Harry returned to check on him, that he clearly intended to leave the house instead of put them on and climb into Draco’s bed.
? He brushed his hand against Draco’s but he didn’t make a move to hold it. Was he subtly suggesting he would like to hold Draco’s hand? Did he want Draco to do the rest? Or, perhaps, was it an accidental touch, and he was bothered by it? Was he, therefore, really glad that Draco made no move to follow up and take Harry’s hand? Or was he outright rejecting the option of holding Draco’s hand? Was he, perhaps, intentionally communicating “I am not willing to hold your hand and that is why I touched you there. So you would know I am not trying to hold your hand.” Was that it?
He was contemplating goblins and Auror security options for Gringotts when a loud rap came upon the door to his flat, startling him. Sighing out “
Everyone looked in a different direction, so Snape spoke again. "Over here, behind the curtain. You have successfully banished my wraith and therefore my portraits have awakened. Would someone please open this curtain? This is quite unpleasant."
Silently, Draco watched Harry pay the bill. He felt a bit odd, not even offering to help pay for his own lunch, but it was a date! Besides, not only was Draco chronically strapped, but he was pretty sure no one at work had any idea that Draco had — via necessity — learned how to carry Muggle money to shop at Muggle grocery stores. Their food was no better, but at the right shop, most of it was a great deal cheaper. Even better, it often came with instructions written right on the box! At any rate, he didn’t think Harry had any expectation of Draco helping to pay this bill. He still squirmed a little though, watching Harry pay. He hated being poor.
Harry still never visited a gay bar, neighborhood, volunteer group. He told himself he had learned that lesson without having to suffer for it.
"By insisting on those two I use the one to boost the other's reputation. The irony! Since only Draco deserves even a
"No need to apologize," McGonagall said, smiling warmly. A house elf let me know you were having some lunch. When you're done eating, I hope you will catch me up on your quest. Did you obtain the ring?"

Draco hung his robes carefully in his wardrobe, making sure they were smooth, that they were fastened properly at the neck, that the shoulders weren't wrinkled. Then he turned, still wearing socks and underthings, and looked at his bed, where Harry lay back against the pillows. Harry, beautiful Harry, was completely nude and tied to Draco's bed by both wrists and both ankles. The ropes had just enough slack that Harry's whole body appeared to be relaxed and comfortable, except his cock, which throbbed a little with every beat of Harry's heart.
consideration," Draco said, with a sudden, intense formality. Startled, Harry looked at him, and Draco looked back, intent. Then he giggled, almost silently. Harry started to laugh, and the two of them cracked up laughing together again, sitting at a dirty picnic table in a crowded train station.
Harry sat quietly, his emotions unreadable, but his countenance calm and his eyes open. He was, at least, still listening.
“I… probably,” Draco admitted. “And no, she doesn’t deserve my anger for wanting to go visit her… friend.”
"I do, actually," Draco said, and he turned his head and gave Harry a genuine smile. Harry felt his heart skip a beat, and smiled back, feeling goofy.
Draco turned to see Mother in the doorway, superficially composed, but touching the string of freshwater pearls at her throat, a unique nervous tell Draco had discerned during the war.
Draco came hard while Harry fucked him hard. Harry wasn’t done, so Draco just held on and marvelled at how good it all felt, even though he’d come and he was pretty sure that he would be sore tomorrow.
He nearly regretted his choice when, turning away from the Floo toward Andromeda and Teddy, he saw the ire in Andromeda’s eyes. “I’ll take him out to the garden!” Harry said, putting off the inevitable as he scooped Teddy out of his grandmother’s arms.
Draco did so enjoy giving head. He’d been shocked when they had explained this would be a requirement, but he could understand their reluctance to hire him. Certainly no one else wanted him around, or to entrust him with anything important.
-smart–” He blushed as Neville laughed warmly. “–but a bloke who isn’t dumb, who doesn’t need me to explain stuff. And can maybe explain stuff to me, sometimes.”

“Two-part authentication,” Harry said, striding toward the tent. “They needed to hear from both of us.”
Draco swallowed, afraid to imagine who might be at his door. He stood, and walked the few steps there. He unlocked it and pulled the door open.
Malfoy laughed again, looking even less in control now. Harry stole Malfoy's wine bottle and drained it, then made a horrible face. That shit was foul. "Seriously," he said again. "When do we cross into Italy?"
“Thank you, my Lord!” Finch-Fletchley says, and he strides off toward the harem. He is headed for the girls this month, Draco notes. He’d chosen boys two months in a row. Draco is pleased to see that the trend has not continued. He prefers his men to enjoy variety. He does go to some trouble to offer it.
Finally, Draco moaned, low and desperate. “Fuck me. Fuck me Harry, then drop to your knees and suck my cock!”
“Mother remains, however,” Draco said. He sighed. “I honestly do aspire to be her dutiful son. I also wish to live my own life and make my own fucking choices. She’s actively making those contradict, and it’s really starting to piss me off.”
Draco and his mother awaited Rosscot’s trial as sedately as they were able. They took long walks, ate delicious food, shared a fully mature wine or two, even went into London. First to enjoy a ballet and then, two days later, for the opera.
“Oh fuck,” Draco said. It was the only thing that came to mind, hopelessly muddled into circles of “yes.” “Please.” “Harry.”
"One of these junior Death Eaters is to be your reward, Mr. Potter." She must have seen the confusion on his face, or perhaps she simply expected it after the bad start to their conversation, for she launched immediately into an explanation.
"Oh," Afelgate half moaned, and he pushed her down hard to lie flat on the table, and began to quickly grip and press at her breasts in sections.
"I want you to be most thorough," Harry told Afelgate, grinning nastily at Mouth, who was nearly snarling at him. "I'd like more than a health check on her tits, actually. I'd really like your opinion on them as a man, as a man who has touched and looked at a lot of tits. You should check her health, but then I want to know what else you think."
"Er," Malfoy said, sounding uncomfortable. He stared straight ahead and kept both hands on the wheel even though Harry could see absolutely nothing in front of them but water.
Harry thought, then dismissed it. He wanted to give this a try. Spending time with Neville had been wonderful. They had this room for the whole night. The whole school thought they were fucking. He’d yet to kiss a bloke. Kissing Neville now was sort of the obvious next step.
“Still,” Mother pressed. “Harry does not see you as inferior? Not the way your father felt about me. Not the way wizards like Rosscot feel. And in return, you treat him like an equal?”
“Mm,” the King said, cupping the back of Draco’s skull in both hands in order to take charge and actively fuck Draco’s face, “I am going to love taking your virgin arse. Look at that erection. Listen to those moans. And I love the way your mouth just drips for me. You want me, don’t you? You love this. All you want is my come. You’re going to be my favourite whore, because you are going to love having my cock inside you.”
Leaning against the closed door, Draco took a few long, slow, deep breaths. Raising his head, he surveyed his modest little flat. His kitchen table was spotless, nothing out of place. No cardboard cups remained, and his creamer and sugar were clearly away where they belonged, because he couldn’t see them. The floor was spotless, the room smelled of nothing at all.
Kreacher had brought home a trunk full of slutty, humiliating clothing options for Harry to try on his slaves. A trunk
On Wednesday Draco woke up with an aching throat, a splitting headache, and a nasty, wracking cough. With the help of a neighbor, he managed to owl Head Auror Bergum a sick note before he collapsed back into bed. He finally felt well enough to head downstairs and Floo to a drop-in Healer’s office at 11am, where he was sold multiple potions and sent directly home to sleep. He woke Thursday morning feeling a million times better as well as ravenously hungry. He ate twice as much breakfast as usual (perfectly affordable, after a full day of eating nothing more nutritious than milky tea) and Flooed off to work, grateful not to be sick any longer.
“Course,” Harry said, easily. “Hell, it can even be a real date, if you want. But either way, we should spend the night in Hogsmeade. Rent a room. Everything.”
. Every expectation, every societal barrier, every ‘polite’ rule meant to keep you inside lines that only harm you. When I fail to celebrate the man you truly are, remember this: it is on me, I am trying, and I am sorry. I have spent your life wanting things for your future that I now see are meant to be your choices, not mine.”
“Matthew Rosscot? Perhaps I do remember him from school,” Narcissa mused slowly, drinking more tea and looking closely at the old, mended photo. “He was an entitled little brat back then, I recall. Constantly trying to sneak into the girls’ dormitories.”
Harry's eyes were mirthful. "So that's what you've been doing for two months? Failing to properly cook tofu?" Then Harry stretched his legs under the table and tangled his shoes with Draco's.
“Of course, Sir,” Draco said, kneeling on the floor next to his desk. “I never forget, no matter whose turn it is.”
“So you know the facts!” Parvati laughed. “But what’s changed?” She made room for Lavender, who took her arm and looked avidly toward Harry, still grinning.
“You spoke with Draco already?” Harry was pretty sure he’d hidden at least most of the misery that wanted to come out with his question, but McGonagall frowned anyway.
Draco felt himself relaxing, comforted. They were going to have a serious conversation, he knew they were; but it was good to do this, first.
"No, no," Harry said, still under the covers but now up on one elbow. He thought his erection might be losing a bit of steam, so he gestured for Hole to stick a hand under the covers and stroke him. "Something else entirely. I have noticed that these two are only enthusiastic about obeying when they are under
Malfoy gave Harry a meaningful look, so Harry raised his wand and, in quick succession, cast and then ended the Gemino Curse. A second map peeled slowly off the first, falling onto the bed of the lake. Malfoy stepped forward and picked it up.
Draco swallows once around Potter’s cock, saliva dripping everywhere. Nothing matters but pleasing Potter, getting him off, swallowing his come.

Draco walked Harry to the conservatory’s doorway. He took Harry’s hands and kissed Harry chastely. He asked Bippy to show Harry out.
“No, Sir,” Draco admitted, and sitting in a large wingback chair, he had Dybbin bring tea. Slowly, seeking feedback throughout, he began to explain.
“Love you, Harry,” Draco murmured into Harry’s neck. “Yr so fuckin’ sexy. Always. M’so gay, Harry. Want you always, y’know.”

“All of them, you prat,” Draco sighed, wrapping an elbow around Harry’s neck and pulling him in for a cuddle.
“Of course,” Draco said, smiling. He finished his wine. “I suppose I’m glad to know that my great sexual sacrifice was not in vain.”
Afelgate plucked his wand from his robe pocket and added odd metal contraptions to the end of the table.

“Sometimes I wonder what the hell I did to deserve you,” Draco whispered after they’d turned off the lights and said their goodnights.
on Mouth's upper half, and the healer seemed to appreciate it. He withdrew his finger from within Mouth and showed Harry a tiny crystalline rock on the end of his finger. It looked a bit like a chunk of nasty granola, or rock candy gone the colour of piss.
Harry kissed like Draco possessed something vital, something Harry had to have — immediately. He tasted of coffee and hope, and Draco was more lost than he could remember being.

Sighing, Harry cleaned the come off his belly, got up and cleaned it off the sheets as well. Then — not feeling clean enough to dress — he conjured a flimsy towel, put it down on the captain's chair, sat down and turned the engine back on. As far as he could tell, they should make it to the castle by morning, if they drove through the night. The Mediterranean got a lot more light than the Black Lake, and especially more than the trench they had followed to the ocean. It was easier to tell day from night here than anywhere else they had been under water. But the submarine tent had good headlights, so Harry felt they could drive all night here, as well.
“I didn’t mean I’d take advantage!” Harry’s embarrassment leaked all over his face. “I’m only saying no one’s ever found HillSide, or broken my wards. People have tried, but they always do a poor job. You’re safe here.”
Malfoy whispered seductively. "I'd love to watch you wank, you know that? Wish I could sneak into your dorm, hide somehow so you couldn't see me, wouldn't know I was there." Malfoy got close, wrapped an arm around Harry's waist, kissed the side of Harry's neck just under the ear, and kept his face there while he whispered the rest. "I'd love to know the little details. Do you take everything off? Do you just push your pyjamas out of the way? Do you touch your bollocks? Roll them? Stroke them? Maybe slip a finger into your arse?" Malfoy's voice was so quiet, his breath on Harry's neck was warm. "Do you get off fast, so your friends don't suspect? Or do you like to make it last?"
"I hate following stupid rules, though. And I have to admit, I'm not always good at telling stupid rules from good ones. I hate paperwork. I can hardly tell you what a relief it is to know that I don't have to sit down and write up what just happened back there, in fucking triplicate, no less.
“Then why do you talk in your sleep about wanting me?” Harry demanded. He could hardly remember anymore that this was, in all honesty, a lie. The way Draco’s mum had reinforced it had affected Harry’s perception.
“Need…” Harry choked out. Draco slowly pulled off, leaving Harry’s erection dangling — ignored, damp and throbbing in the warm air of Harry’s kitchen.

“I’m not sure I need bother with Living Wards,” Draco said, pouring their tea. “Neville was very reassuring. Both that he caught the singular criminal involved, and that said villain would indeed be swiftly convicted.”
Draco, though, had nearly killed Katie and Ron, let killers into Hogwarts, and, well, hadn’t killed Dumbledore, but didn’t take his sanctuary offer. He’d then run back to the Death Eaters.
Harry sent his patronus to Draco right away. “Contact your mother immediately. She needs dogged safeguarding. I’ll contact the Aurors. Narcissa Malfoy is in danger.”
“A little,” Draco admitted. “I hate that I’m the one doing it, but the only one who’ll never hear it.”
The compact olive drab submarine tent seemed to have -- if not a lot of space, then at least everything they could expect to need: torches, cots and blankets, food, some spell books, a painfully incomplete map of the lake, and a parchment detailing everything the headmistress had learned. They were to report back as they saw fit, and were instructed to come back and think through the facts with McGonagall should they hit an impasse. They learned how to operate the submarine tent without speaking to one another even once. Harry felt a nagging need to clear things up with Malfoy somehow, but they were all being so efficient, so
“As you are,” Mother said. She looked up at him, straightening her already straight spine. “And I neglected to treat you as such for far too long. I hope that I… I have attempted to correct that error, of late,” she said.
“You repeat that constantly,” Harry growled, “but you ‘doth protest too much!’ You don’t just like fucking me, you like to kiss. You like fucking face-to-face. You love sleeping next to me, touching me. You guide me by the small of my back when we walk together. You pat my arse in front of people. You insist on being exclusive!”

Draco arrived at work 45 minutes early on Monday morning, which meant he arrived before all the Aurors except Head Auror Bergum and Auror Bērziņš, who were in the Head Auror’s office with the door open, quietly discussing a case that seemed to involve a lot of maps.
"I could, er, go or something," Malfoy said, and Harry looked up at him again. Malfoy looked uncomfortable. Harry realized that although Snape had been far nicer about Malfoy than about him, he'd nonetheless insulted Malfoy pretty viciously, and Malfoy's dad, too.
He tentatively took the end into his mouth, and Harry made a small, helpless noise in response. Draco allowed himself to feel some pride. Then he dismissed it, in favour of trying to give Harry pleasure.
Malfoy took his indecision as a challenge. He spread his legs, then bent one at the knee. He stroked his cock, and Harry felt his own respond to the sight. Such a beautiful man, hard and eager. For him.
Draco stood and then he stared at Harry's outstretched hand. He was going to do this. He was going to tie Harry up. He was going to have a naked, beautiful man in his bedroom, tied to his bed. There was absolutely no denying this anymore. He was attracted to men. He was homosexual.
"I know you mean well, Harry." Robards leaned forwards and clasped his hands together. "No one could doubt that. But you don't seem to believe, deep down, that the rules exist to protect the general public. Every time you come up against something that constrains you, it is as though you view it as a… a personal affront. I've never seen an auror with that attitude who managed to succeed in the long term."

“Ronald Weasley,” he said, serious and sad. “I owe you an apology, from the depths of my magic and the center of my soul.
So, cursing his weakness, Harry threw a random recording of Draco into his Pensieve and went in after it; prepared to simply masturbate, come, fall asleep.
He saw the relief break over Andromeda’s face, but had no idea it was for two reasons, not just the one she had revealed to him.
The elder seemed completely uninterested in Harry's silent discomfort and turned to the guards again. "Gentlemen?" She nodded at them and one of the four figures was prodded forward. This one was large and ungainly under the billowing cloak, and somehow Harry was unsurprised to see Gregory Goyle emerge. He shook his head quickly, "No," and one guard took Goyle back through the door, his leg irons clanking as the guard hurried him away.
I hope you will find my son’s mind and body become a source of benefit, pleasure, and reassurance. As long as he lives in my Lord’s castle, and perhaps even sleeps occasionally in my Lord’s bed, I will be clearly and logically constrained by mind, heart, soul and magic, from opposing my Lord King. As long as Draco lives, I will remain your obedient servant and will obey your orders without hesitation.
“I don’t want anyone else to define this for us,” Harry said, sounding determined again. Draco loved the way Harry could sound like nothing in the universe would keep him from his goals.
Harry's discomfort was making him jumpy. "And you checked all the shrunken stuff, right? We'll return everything to McGonagall just the way she gave it to us, right?"
Harry sighed in contentment. This really was wonderful. He hoped he wouldn't fall asleep before it was over. He wanted to be conscious enough to enjoy it.
“I understand,” Harry rushed to reassure. “You’ve genuine concerns. People really are out to get you. But we’re out here, alone, completely cut off from the world, just the two of us. I promise you that.”
“I shall keep that in mind,” he says as dismissively as he knows how. But he is looking down into Potter’s eyes and smiling.
Potter looks at Draco shrewdly for a long moment, and Draco holds the eye contact calmly, silently. “Assuming you are both, then,” Potter finally continues, “I should explain what I need. I have a very demanding schedule these days. I spend nearly every evening at some sort of event, memorial or ball. I field many requests for dates from the most beautiful and eligible young men and women. Basically, I require an extremely competent cocksucker to keep my testicles drained at all times so I don’t get erections at embarrassing or compromising moments.
Harry’s arse. He grabbed. Pinched. Spread Harry’s cheeks wide for one thrust, then pushed them together for the next.
After his nap, Harry awoke with a prodigious erection. Stroking it lazily, he contemplated pissing, eating, fucking a slave, or possibly just going back to sleep.
"Yes," he frowned. "There is a slightly increased risk of magical or even physical scarring to the slaves, but it shouldn't affect their ability to please you sexually."
“But if your apologies were sincere, and you make amends, you can oust that stain, and avert the consequences.”
Three days later, Harry cleared his throat in the entry to Draco’s lab. “So, with your mother away, there’s only so much I can test, but, I’m pretty sure the door’s done.”
"I said," Harry said, now feeling quite magnanimously patient, "how does this work? How do you test them for these injuries and venereal diseases and such?" He grinned, watching a look of horror bloom on Mouth's face. She couldn't hide hers nearly as well as Hole hid his. Though Harry - who knew him pretty well - could still sort of see the anger there.
“Look,” Malfoy tried. “I want to bury the hatchet with you. Very much. It will be good for me, my Mum, Teddy, Aunt Andromeda… everyone. But I can’t just stroll casually into Hogsmeade, the Leaky, or Diagon. Not even with you. We’ve switched places, Potter. Now I’m… sort of… Undesirable Number 1.”
"Hm," Draco said, and they drove in silence for a long stretch, just admiring the fish and looking for angry, armed merpeople. They didn't see any, and eventually Harry couldn't resist asking Draco something he'd been wondering for hours.
He’d waited by himself for an entire hour and a half; watching Muggles arrive, greet each other, smile and laugh. He was relieved to realize he didn’t feel intimidated at all. A month or two ago, he’d have been nervous and overwhelmed to sit alone in a park filling with Muggles. Today, he felt like he was doing just fine. He wasn’t even bored. Mostly because he was considering the promising results he’d seemed to have with Prazosin and armadillo bile the weekend before, and writing down possible ways to continue testing that as a combination.

Harry thought Malfoy might be smiling. "Well, it was quite a while ago," he answered the other boy. "Perhaps you had better take charge, then, eh?"
Draco sniffled and Harry reached behind him, grabbing at a supply of tissues and handing Draco a few.
"Normally I'd be uncomfortable with the headmistress' request," Robards admitted slowly. His chair was tipped back and his arms were behind his head. He was looking up at the ceiling.
"Of course, Mr. Malfoy." Dumbledore nodded gravely at Harry, who stood, picked up his bookbag, and left the room. Once the door closed he could hear nothing, so he waited outside the door, wondering if he was expected to stay or go. He feared that, whichever he did, he'd get in trouble. And he was terribly curious. The room was thin and long, a corridor, almost. Ideal for pacing.
Swallowing hard, nodding, deciding, Harry rose, pushing down on Draco’s shoulders, but keeping his secret. Then he rolled away, feeling simultaneously stupid and clever, and snuck into his bathroom to wank hurriedly. This would take no time at all.
Harry stroked Draco’s fringe off his forehead gently before he started to speak. “That’s a wonderful list of ways I’m good to you, and I can agree. I do try to do all of that. But I work hard to be good to you because I really want this relationship to work. Because you are….” Harry paused. “Merlin, man, you are amazing.”
Mouth squirmed under his hand and cock. "Yes, Sir," she breathed out huskily, "please? I'll know you meant it all when you come in me. That's how I'll know I'm sexy."
Malfoy arranged himself slowly over the coffee table, obviously uncomfortable. He lay nude over a hard, rectangular table, arse up and dick dangling. Harry smiled at his slave's ridiculous posture before turning to Scrivener again. He carelessly dropped one hand onto the small of Malfoy's back.
They set off, and Draco didn’t know what to say, but Harry seemed to. He launched into chatter about the reconstruction of Hogwarts, talked a bit about how his friends had needed to go all the way to Australia to rescue Hermione’s parents from some sort of self-imposed exile Draco didn’t fully follow, and then asked about Draco’s friends.
Smiling sadly at himself, Draco sat at his desk. If he no longer had the concentration for potions research today, he could nonetheless write a letter. “Dear Blaise,” he began. Then he stared out the window. He didn’t want to bore Blaise with talk of his dragging potions research. As for his job, he’d already told his old friend all the basic details plus every possible entertaining anecdote in the last letter he’d sent, almost a month before.
Then Draco turned to speak. "I truthfully do aspire to be your dutiful son,” he began. “However, I also need to live my own life and make my own choices. You have been actively making those contradict. This distresses me.
“I have been thinking,” Narcissa began, “about the connection between men like Rosscot, and men like Lucius. I have been considering things I have heard, and questioning their truth.”
Draco sat on his couch. He really didn’t think he was dreaming, but how could he not be? He wondered how he was meant to check. (Should he pinch himself? He would look like a moron.) He looked up at Potter, who looked back at him. They were clearly both lost.
. But elegance? He’d always been too aggressive. Even in the air. And yes, there was grace to some of his movements now, especially while weaving Living Wards. Draco had seen and forgotten it. That was just… work.
"But now… I feel a little sick, frankly. Will you please take that thing directly to the headmaster and destroy it? I… I need some time alone or I'm going to fall apart in front of my mother. I'll see you as soon as I get back to Hogwarts. Mother knows I'm only planning on staying a few more days. She knows… she knows the task the Dark Lord has set for me. She knows why I was planning to stay only a few days. I have to decide if I'm going to tell her I've changed sides. I can't prepare for all of this with you naked in my bed. You're far too distracting."
“I think she’s seeing Luna Lovegood,” Neville said, and he looked down at the windowsill and sighed.
"Many years ago, shortly before I left Hogwarts, I attempted to bring Lily Evans to her senses, one last time. I offered her a ring, an
,” Draco snarled when he had everyone’s riveted attention. His hand still controlled Harry’s collar, and would until he let go, or Harry recovered from shock. “But Potter has an itch up his arse that can only be scratched by my big cock.  So we’ve an arrangement, which no one is to fuck with.”
At the very least, the Aurors did seem to appreciate what he was doing for them and their department. Bergum had praised Draco twice already: first for how quickly he was learning the ropes, and second for how well he’d accomplished a specific task Bergum had apparently expected to have to rescue him from. When he had knocked on Bergum’s door to let him know the Goblins had agreed to the meeting about additional (human) security at Gringotts, and they had accepted Bergum's proposed agenda and location with only two modifications, Bergum had told Draco straight out what a good job he’d done. He’d even shaken Draco’s hand!
"Dobby seemed a likely source for memories that could be helpful, and he's been extremely cooperative. It did not take long before I discovered a section of his mind that had been repeatedly walled off with

Harry cast a couple of cleansing charms, leaned over Draco, stared into his blissed face for a long second, then — clearly pleased with what he saw — waggled his eyebrows ridiculously.
Draco went home full, even relaxed. And with Mum none the wiser about the “date” he’d gone on with Harry Potter. One Draco could not possibly have explained.
“I know,” Harry said, nodding hard. “But I had to throw out most of the furniture. Some was rotting. Rest was cursed.”
“She didn’t go to Hogwarts. She went to Beauxbatons, like her mother. I recall she married a Spanish boy? At any rate, sadly, we lost touch years ago. But I suspect I can find her nonetheless. Give me a day or two?”
“Fuck me. Really hard. Please,” Draco said, and pulled himself to a better angle by tightening the leg he still had around Harry Potter’s naked, wet waist.
Harry took a moment to smile winningly at Draco, and as he did, he watched a bit more tension unwind from Draco’s shoulders, a bit more of Draco’s pallor get replaced by an adorable pink flush.
) Then, nude and clean and still just the slightest bit damp, he stood in his bedroom wondering what the hell to wear.
The sea air ate light. And sound. They rocked, he and Mother, alone in their thoughts, and the mist, and the twilight.
"Come and sit over there with me?" he asked Draco. He nodded toward a small table with his head, and looking surprised but agreeable, Draco followed him.
Draco peered at the bakery box. “It’s full of coffee,” he said, sadly. He’d been looking forward to trying the cranberry one, he realized.
“I can pay my own bills, Harry, but I need you to travel to Switzerland to collect these funds. Ted put them in a Muggle bank when things started to look really frightening.”

he was. He was quite sure that he simply longed to find a time, a place, and a way to explain these pathetic inadequacies to Potter.
“You, er, still forget?” Draco asked, a bit astonished. How odd it must be, to live in two worlds at once. He wondered if he should sit again, but Harry was still standing.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"So what the fuck are we doing here, anyway?" He spread his hands out, palms up. "How the hell do we find this ring? We know
Harry leaned in to the gargoyle and carefully pronounced "Bubble Bees." He didn't want Malfoy to think he didn't trust him. He didn't, of course, but it seemed like a bad meeting for starting out on the wrong foot.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“It would be a shame to turn down an offer that tempting.” Harry said, approaching Draco slowly. He was smiling.
“Did he, now,” Mother said, still using that uniquely delicate tone that Draco didn’t quite know how to interpret.
Harry didn’t think the bloke deserved Azkaban, but Malfoy still owed quite a few people a heartfelt apology.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
What, exactly, had Malfoy ever done to Andromeda, Teddy, Tonks or Lupin? Harry remembered Riddle bullying Malfoy about “babysitting cubs,” but that was hardly something
They asked their waiter — his name tag said Calvin — about the Pride celebration, and he frowned. “There’s no committee this year, gents,” Calvin told them. “Everyone’s decorated, of course, but the thing fell apart. Don’t be buying any tickets. My flatmate bought a ticket but it’s a scam.” When he saw their faces fall, he tried to cheer them up. “Lots of people will be throwing their own parties, of course, you know! Even if there isn’t a march or a music festival this year, there’s plenty of ways to celebrate. I’m sure a lot of people will be found relaxing in Soho Square. Not to mention, you should come back again, eat here!” He winked hugely and Harry and Draco both laughed.
"Yeah?" Draco said sleepily. He should be napping now, Harry realized, so that they could drive night and day nonstop until they got to Lecce again. But perhaps his sleepiness was an advantage. Harry suspected Draco wasn't going to be crazy about this question. "How long have you fancied me?" Harry said quietly.
should, I mean… because...” Draco muttered and mumbled and gave up on words. His mouth could still suck cock, though, so he manhandled Harry off him, turned himself around, and took one of Harry’s balls into his mouth.
Draco alternated between reading an old novel, and watching intently. He truly had no idea what Harry was doing, how it would facilitate the creation of Living Wards, or even what language Harry was casting in.
Draco looked into Harry's eyes for a difficult moment. "When you began to pursue me, I was at first flattered, then I was disdainful, and then I was terrified." Draco looked away, unable to sustain the eye contact along with the words and hating himself for it.

"Of course, Mr Potter!" he said, looking horrified at the idea that he'd even considered judging the way Harry Potter chose to use, or abuse, his sex slaves. "I didn't mean to imply anything at all! Simply to say that you should be able to request whatever Healer you like, and any of us should be able to fix practically anything: any disease, any injury; that one of your slaves might turn up with. Any exceptions could be taken care of at St Mungo's, but those exceptions would be very rare, indeed."
They lapsed into silence as Draco used his hands to render Harry finally ready for sleep. Eventually Draco switched to light scratches and Harry took the hint. He stood, stretched, then captured and kissed Draco’s hand.
“Dizon said we would visit with the Mwangi family for just two or three days, because he very much wants to show me his house in the Okavango Delta, in Botswana.”

“Neville is a very fine Auror,” Harry agreed, and sipped his tea before adding milk and sugar. “But I am still worried about you and your mother.”
at Draco, patted his desk, and turned to leave before Draco could manage to squeak out a proper “Thank you, Sir.”
Draco really did, so he pulled Harry upwards a bit, and Harry rutted frantically into Draco's covered stomach. Draco had a perfect view as ejaculate erupted from the slit at the tip of Harry's beautiful cock.

"Magical underthings." Draco blushed. "They're designed to protect me from certain lower-lever spells. They were woven magically, from fibers of some magical plant or other, I can't remember much about it. Herbology was never my strong suit."
Harry leaned in, placing a hand over Malfoy's tight, tense stomach, and spoke into Malfoy's ear, watching his breath disturb Malfoy's fine hair. "Have you ever had a cock in your mouth?"
Eventually he realized he didn’t want to need another wank, so he snuggled down to await his dreams.
He managed to write down a pleasant introduction. Draco was fine, work was fine, Mother was fine, Blaise’s last letter had been a delight to read. He scratched down a couple of lines about Pansy, hoping Blaise had seen her or knew what she was up to in her flight from her old and ugly husband. He managed, he thought, to suggest that he’d given Pansy a great deal of money while not actually directly saying how much. Blowing at the ink contemplatively, Draco hoped Blaise would feel duty-bound to try and best Draco’s implied sum. Wherever she was, a good owl should still be able to find her, and she almost certainly needed money again.
“Draco,” she said, turning to face him head on. She took both his hands into her own. “I owe you a tremendous apology. I have suffered all my life from a deluge of strictures meant to keep me in line, and now I see I have attempted to rein you in with similar nonsense.
“S’more than,” Harry said, making careful eye contact. “I like sharing beds. Super cosier this way.”
is the only one who's done it in decades?" He sounded angry. He was sitting ramrod straight and gripping the wheel tightly. "Maybe the part where Snape still can't believe a pretty Muggle born girl would turn him down, when he was the sort of guy who would turn to the Dark Lord the minute she said 'no'?"
Harry put away his Map and chose to leave his bag behind. Malfoy was easy to find, as he was walking out of the Great Hall with Crabbe and Goyle when Harry was about to enter. As he always did these days, Malfoy looked terrible. Tired and far too thin.
“Thank you for coming so quickly,” Draco finally said, pulling himself from Harry’s uniquely comforting arms. He spelled his face clear of tears and puffiness surreptitiously as he walked toward the parlour doorway, so Harry couldn’t see. Then he looked across the hallway and through the spellwork guarding Mother, who was still, thank Merlin, fast asleep in her most comfortable chair.

Draco looks at Weasley, who nods. Draco continues to stroke the shaft of his Guard’s massive silken cock.
“The new Living Wards have already been adjusted to exclude you from the space once you leave,” he explained. “I have complete control of them now. But I can readmit you easily. All you have to do, is fully, truly accept me, Mother. Just the way I am. Queer.”
Harry turned his head and stared at Neville with some horror, but Neville was still looking at the ceiling.
Looking up after he’d filled the page front and back, he was honestly surprised to find himself in the Slytherin wing.
"Harry, there's a difference between thinking and knowing…. Before you summoned it, I sort of… thought it was here. Maybe. Now I know it is. And I played with that thing as a kid. All the time. I'd told myself… I was sure there wouldn't be anything at all. That your search would come up empty. Or that you might, possibly find something, but that I wouldn't recognize it, whatever you found.
“Werewolves do not often have children,” Andromeda began, pouring herself tea. “For quite a few reasons. Including societal stigma.”
"Want to hold your head with my hands, and feel your soft hair, and stand up, and pull you up with me, and fuck your mouth so hard. Like a hole, like an arse, like a tight, wet hole that sucks in my dick and takes my come." Harry panted and slowed down Malfoy's hand. "Gonna come soon," he managed. "Still want to swallow?"
“For which I feel guilty and responsible. He wanted that, so I encouraged it. He cared to have your adoration, wanted your love and sought your admiration. But I do not so much feel….”
Striving to appear cool, Harry strolled to the display, where Draco was checking surveillance spells and magical devices. “No fair starting without me,” he murmured.
His ejaculate, as promised, soothed her irritated vaginal walls, and for a while, Mouth slept as well.
But this did not preclude Draco pressing his (clothed, dammit) arse against Harry’s prominent erection. It did not stop Harry from breathing hard in Draco’s ear. It did not mean Harry couldn’t grip Draco’s hips – hard – and pull.
wardsmiths,” Harry said, deliberately calming himself with tea and deep breaths, “in the past, have crafted wards that sloppily. But I never have.”

“I want a chance, Draco.” Harry put an arm around Draco. Pulled him in. Squeezed the hand trapped between their bare chests. Kissed Draco’s cheek.
"No. I want them both. They'd just be… picking up garbage on Diagon Alley or something, I don't know."
Harry grimaced downwards, then sipped his Ice Vodka. “She wants to know if you or your mother will attend.”
Harry let Neville see the shiver that took his spine. “Ugh,” he said with vehemence. “No. That’s why Ginny and I broke it off.”
Draco liked to open doors for Harry. He liked when Harry smiled at him, though he rarely smiled back.

He'd been thinking about this almost nonstop since his first night home with two sex slaves. He felt clear that "permanent marks of slavery / sexual servitude" needed to be attractive, representative and creative. And while it should reference Harry's reasons for having two slaves in the first place, it must not overtly reference Voldemort himself. No lightning bolts or snakes. No yew or Master wands. He'd finally woken from a dead sleep the night before with an image pressed against his mind's eye. He'd quickly scribbled the basics of it onto a scrap of parchment and after breakfast called on the tattooist the Elder had raved about.
“We have a fish wall,” Draco said, still sullen. “Father installed it in his lounge, to entertain him during his… house arrest. It is enormous.”

“I wasn’t looking for a lover when you asked me to check your wards.” Harry continued. “I wasn’t hoping for a boyfriend because I was fine on my own. As, I believe, you were. Neither of us
Finally, he had downed enough to justify Vanishing the rest, and began to mechanically set up for a day of brewing. Every bump, though, every knock and bang and every noise in general — no matter how far away or soft — convinced him all over again that Harry Potter had arrived, unannounced again, at his front door.
Helplessly, Harry swallowed and stood there, on (Draco’s?)  white carpet, where the Floo had succeeded in spitting him out. Staring at Draco. All was soundless but for the horrible smashing of his heart, fast against his ribs.
February became March. Draco had thirteen short, awkward, useless interviews before he finally found himself, his stomach sinking, shaking the head Auror’s hand in greeting. Potter fidgeted on the other side of the interview room. There was no way this would go well. Potter had always hated Draco.
“I wouldn’t normally recommend we go this far, but under these circumstances, your mother having been so viciously and personally targeted…” Harry couldn’t look Draco in the eye.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Potter sighed, but he looked resigned, not annoyed. “I can understand that,” he said. “I’ve been dealing with gossip since I first got here.” Then a gleam came into his eyes. “But, you know, an awful lot of that gossip came from you. Didn’t it?”
"Which?" Harry asked, stroking his hand indulgently across Malfoy's clenching abs. His skin was silky there, Harry decided. He wondered if it was silky like that all over Malfoy's body.
Draco was still uncertain that Harry could really mean that. Had he given this any thought at all? Harry's impulsiveness was famous. "Despite who I am? Despite our history? Despite what I've done to you in the past?" Draco dropped his voice to almost a whisper. "Despite… despite my own childhood tuition?"
"I have questions for you, Malfoy, and you will answer them as humbly and as simply as possible. A simple yes or no is best. Do you understand?"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"I'm not surprised you've not seen this before, Mr Potter. This is how we give women an internal pelvic exam. When I need to examine a man internally, I have him stand and bend over."
The spell obviously worked on the Dobby in the memory, but of course had no effect on Harry. Harry instead suffered the disorientation of Dobby rapidly shaking his own head in response to the spell, and then he felt Dobby cower as he reacted to being under his Master's wand.
Since Draco was a prickly bastard, Harry let him control the movements between scenes. They kissed for longer than Harry’d expected, but undressed quickly once Draco realized he was being presented with a free hand within their agreed upon script.
“All yours,” Draco said, sounding casual, but he lowered his trousers and, with one silent spell, hung them just under his arse, baring heat Harry thirsted to possess.
“Your Mum,” Harry mumbled back. Reluctant, he nonetheless stood and walked toward his Floo. Draco followed him slowly.
Harry stood closer than necessary as he hung his wet hat next to his wet cloak. "You always were the man for wines."
Draco considered that. Could he fix Harry’s unhappiness? By giving him something that didn’t exist? Besides, he was unhappy too. That, though, he could do something about.
Harry and Draco sat across from Narcissa on a small, flowered loveseat. They had tea, made small talk regarding the slowly progressing trial, and spoke not a word about the way Harry and Draco were holding hands, cuddled thigh to thigh, and smiling private smiles at one another in between bites of their tiny sandwiches, sips of their tea.

“My Lord,” Potter growls, and Draco shivers and rolls them both over without letting his lover’s cock slip free. “Pound me, Harry,” he says. “As hard and fast as you can. Show me your strength.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“So,” Harry said, adjusting little Teddy more comfortably on his hip, “I see you and Teddy have made friends?”
Hermione looked at him very seriously, clearly thinking her answer through. Draco silently tapped his fingers in patterns on the knitted rainbow blanket, willing himself to be patient while she carefully formulated her answer.
"I want you to find him. I believe you have a most helpful Map for this purpose?" The Headmaster twinkled at Harry, who could not believe that anyone, even Dumbledore, could twinkle at a moment like this.
“We record tonight,” Draco panted. He was trying to rip off his shoes, but his trousers were in the way. “Sex, sleep talk, everything.”
It made Draco wonder how receptive Harry would be to offers of more opportunities to practice his self control. He could send an owl, perhaps. Or he could stop by Harry’s desk some evening after everyone else had gone home, or drop by Harry’s front door someday….
“Aunt Andromeda,” Draco said. It all made so much more sense now. Chastened, Draco nodded and followed Weasley back around.
Finally Malfoy motioned to his companions, and the four of them walked to the Headmaster's office. Malfoy seemed slightly surprised to actually arrive there.
Harry's face fell. It was true that his methods sometimes failed spectacularly. Mr Rellujier had, or so he claimed, forgiven Harry for mistaking his mentally ill wife for a true vampire, and Harry had insisted on paying for the funeral. He squirmed in his chair like a child as he remembered telling Robards the terrible guilt he'd been forced to admit. "If I had followed the proper procedures for containing even the most powerful of vampires, Mrs Rellujier would still be alive and getting the help she needed."
. All this foreplay stuff is nice, it’s good! But Harry, you’re a top, and I’m a bottom, and it’s time. You keep buying me food! And you want everyone to know! What, I mean...
Draco comes hard, riding Harry’s cock and kissing Harry. Ineptly kissing Harry, he can admit, but he is so focused on that pillar in his arse that he doesn’t mind. He collapses onto Harry’s chest and snuggles down for a moment. His handsomest Guard puts his arms around Draco and holds him close. Draco sighs happily and reaches into Harry’s thick black hair to play and tangle.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Harry thought about this for a moment. He'd told the Wizengamot elder he wanted his slaves to attend to his arsehole, but he hadn't actually done anything about it.
“The tribute from Lord Lucius,” the guard mumbled. “It’s his, er, his son, your Majesty. He sent his
"I just do, Draco. I learned to trust you with my life when we were soldiers together. That hasn't changed."
He had wiped his dick on the tee shirt and indicated that the room needed to be tidied and the clothing cleaned, but asked Dudders and Kreacher to wait a bit before they got to work on those things.
“I brought two blueberry muffins, this time!” he said. Harry sounded sort of stupidly hopeful and Draco’s resolve simply broke inside him.
memories! The sex had been lousy, but he could still wank to memories of sucking Malfoy’s beautiful cock. With permission.
While Draco didn’t mind his job at all, and sometimes even felt a real sense of accomplishment from it, he didn’t really
“Tonight I want to implement a night-long recording charm,” Draco declared as he arrived for his and Harry’s standard Friday fuck date.
With Harry’s dick still firmly in his hand, Draco turned just enough to capture Harry’s lips with his own. They kissed for a long moment.
Harry nodded, frowning. “That’s not how I would have put it,” he said slowly, “but I guess I see what you mean.”
No longer distracted by Draco’s mouth, Harry did his best. Draco came quickly, and hard. Harry eagerly swallowed every drop, barely tasting it because he’d pulled Draco’s erection so far down his throat.
"No," Harry said slowly, "no. You should stay and eat. I'm not trying to make you leave. You're right. Snape's wraith is unhinged and even when he was alive he always treated me unfairly, always hated me. I should have known better than to think death would improve his personality." He stopped suddenly, realizing that was a bizarre way to word it.
Harry started up the stairs. "Follow me to my room, both of you. I plan to find out how many times I can come in one day without magical assistance."
“If you wish?” Draco said, sheepish. “This is awfully nice of you. I’m sure I could sleep now. This was very smart.”
“—keep you waiting,” Harry finished as Draco gripped the display he was facing. He stayed silent, however, and made a good show of continuing to check the spells.
Harry came to rest against Draco’s side, leaning on an elbow, other hand splayed wide, high on Draco’s belly. He inched that hand down.
"Over there, against the wall," Harry barked at them, and they shuffled toward a bare space where he now often had them wait.
“Oh!” Harry said, and he stood up and walked to the window, clapped Neville on the shoulder and smiled. “Luna has a boyfriend in London! She’s seeing this total whack job, Rolf Scamander. He’s perfect for her! Ron introduced them.”
"What!" Harry felt his cheeks prickle painfully as he sat up hard and spluttered in shock. Wizengamot elders weren't supposed to talk like that!
Grinning enormously, Kreacher opened the book for Harry to read, but Harry indicated he wanted Kreacher's summary, so - looking a bit puffed at the attention - Kreacher began to explain what he had learned from the ancient tome hidden at the very bottom of a far, dusty shelf.
Green eyes were tightly shut, and Harry was forcing himself to breathe normally. After inspecting his face for a moment, Draco decided Harry would be fine and returned to examining Harry's shins.
First thing, he realized, was probably to check the tent's rumbling movement forward, since no one was driving. He sat in the driver's seat and looked through the front window. It was clear for as far ahead as he could see. The spells and view screens indicated that they should be able to move ahead on autopilot for quite a while, and if he was going to go back there and tell Malfoy… something, then they wouldn't have to slow down their trip in order to have that conversation.
“If I recall correctly, the trial is a week from Thursday. I suggest that, until then, you and I take a holiday, only right here at home. Vissy and Bippy will take care of us. We can get a great deal of rest, we can enjoy the lovely views.... After the trial ends, and a verdict is pronounced, we can decide together if you should contact your South African friends and ask to return to their hospitality.”
“I don’t know for sure,” Harry said, finally putting the spoon down to take Draco’s hands in his again. “I’m just making a conservative estimate. The extra day is there if I have to redo the Living Wards. See, this way, if it takes me only
“I liked the way you shot that arse, Zacharius, down – just with words. I suck at that. And that you didn’t need reassurances from me. I wouldn’t want to go out with someone who was constantly asking me if he was good enough for me. Ginny did that once or twice and it absolutely drove me mad.”

Harry missed Draco’s intelligence, beauty, physical grace and that secret little smile he hid from everyone but Harry.
Harry, however, did accept two dinner invitations, and managed to keep them both in stitches for much of the evening, spinning yarns from his work about all manner of amusing mishaps and silly errors.
Potter’s dick is so far down Draco’s throat that he won’t taste Potter’s come, which is unfortunate. As for Potter, he is thrashing a bit, his hands gripping the arms of his desk chair hard as he jerks forward into Draco’s wet and welcoming mouth over and over.

“Just opening doors might be inadequate. Someone talented’s clearly after you. Extra caution’s not wrong.” Harry looked sideways, apparently worried how Draco might respond.
Draco picked the damp rabbit up off the floor, cleaned it briskly with his wand and handed it to Teddy, who immediately shoved it back into his mouth.
Together they walked out and around to the Floo Harry had installed outside his home for added protection. They flooed to the Manor and waited while the wards squirmed, then settled.
