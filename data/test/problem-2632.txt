“Well, mine, but…”
“What can I say? It was Wine and Whiskey Wednesday.” Harry grinned lopsidedly back at him, only to be distracted by the arrival of a neatly folded memo. Malfoy snatched it out of the air before Harry could reach for it, quickly scanning it.
“Good God, Malfoy, are you always this neat and tidy?”
“You’re one of them, are you? One of them bastards what tried to put her away on that hellish island when she never did nothing wrong?” Jeremiah was enraged now, spittle flying from his mouth, but still no sign of his wand, to both Harry and Malfoy’s confusion.
“He went home right after his speech.” Pansy said apologetically, shrugging slightly. “Everybody was saying you’d had a fight with him, you know. It was quite the spectacle – I think it even beat our surprise wedding.”
Lupin frowned.
“Would it be possible for you to make another one of these as a takeaway? And some tea if you can? I probably shouldn’t go back to the cottage without food!”
“You’re going to be an excellent father, Draco.”
“No, only once she was already in Northumberland. She wrote to me and explained that she’d come across something I needed to know about, and I should let her know when I was available to meet her.”
“OK, moving on. We need to ask Granger a few things, so start writing a letter. I’ll dictate.”
“Where’s Malfoy?”
“Well, I was hardly going to tell you that, was I?” Malfoy looked desperately embarrassed, but Harry grinned widely back at him. Harry was pleased – just because he’d only just found out about his feelings for Malfoy it didn’t mean they weren’t strong feelings. The framed photo was reassurance that perhaps Malfoy felt as strongly.
There was a couple of seconds where Harry took a hasty gulp of champagne while he tried to think of something else to say.
He remembered something Ron had said in his wedding vows to Hermione: “Marrying you is the great happiness of my life – this is the joy I’ve been waiting for forever.” It had been a remarkably poetic phrase from someone who had, just an hour before, eaten six chicken legs and then thrown them back up from nerves, but it had brought a tear to Harry’s eye.
The sound of the muggle curse coming out of Malfoy’s pureblood lips, and the irony that it was Christ he’d chosen, made Harry smile, and then, uncontrollably, he laughed. Either Malfoy understood the joke, or Harry’s laugh was contagious, because Malfoy started to laugh too, and they stood there, laughing, in front of the war portrait until they heard Seamus’ magically magnified voice rattling through the maze, starting the auction.
“All those times I was so awful to you…I always thought…you know, the Chosen One, you’d have grown up being told how brilliant and special you were.”
“Right, we can’t make any assumptions at this point.” Malfoy paused. “Although we should probably know more than we do right now…It’s been almost a week since we first got the case.”
“We need to get back to the Ministry and tell Granger and Weasley.”
Both Harry and Malfoy laughed, thinking of all the secrets Pansy had been delighted to spread in the past. Nothing truly important, of course – she was a trusted and valued member of the Ministry, but she did always love to gossip.
“Anyway, there are quite a few Hogwarts alumni named Herman, but one was of particular interest to me.” Hermione held out a piece of parchment with a school photograph clipped to the top. “Herman Bellchant, Slytherin. He was several years younger than Snape, but it says here they served a few detentions together.”
“What do you want to do today? We can do anything.”
“I’ve never had a boyfriend before.”
Malfoy laughed and kissed Harry squarely on the lips, and then kissed Harry Frederick’s forehead.
“I’m not a betting guy, but if I was, I’d put money on her.”
“Harry! What’s wrong?” She cried, rushing over to Harry, who looked, bewildered, at Malfoy.
The theme was always a surprise – the invitation always said roughly to dress in elegant, fancy muggle clothes and come prepared for anything. The event this year was set for Friday 19th, just over a week away.
“What’s the theme, then?” He spoke through the mouthful of crisps, and although Hermione rolled her eyes, she read out the letter. The theme wouldn’t be officially announced until everybody arrived tomorrow, but Pansy always caved and told Hermione beforehand, knowing she would tell Harry and Ron.
He held out a hand to Malfoy, who grudgingly took it, standing up awkwardly. Harry grabbed his other hand and started dancing about wildly, forcing him to move along or fall over. After a few moments, Malfoy started to smile, and then full on grin as he started to dance in time with the music.
“We’re partners.” Malfoy said matter-of-factly, not looking up from the meal he was rapidly devouring.
“I had to give Savage our report by myself.” Malfoy scowled at Harry over his cup of coffee, who frowned back, guiltily remembering the memo on his calendar.
But there was no denying it now as Molly Weasley fussed around him. Ginny had forced her brothers to keep her mum away until the start of the ceremony, and so Molly’s maternal instincts were overflowing to anybody within arms’ length.
“Yeah, I thought I’d surprise you by making pasta from scratch, but I’m not sure I’m doing it right!” Neville gestured to the several pots and pans that surrounded him, and Harry chuckled. Harry had been giving Neville muggle cooking lessons for roughly two years, and Neville was as slow a learner as he had been at Potions. But Harry was a patient teacher, and Neville was more than eager to learn, and so it was an enjoyable experience for them both.
“And?”
“So who else do you know here, then?”
“Oi!” Harry laughed. “My moves are brilliant, thank you very much.”
“Salazar, what’s with all the mess?” Malfoy gingerly picked his way across the room towards the table, followed by Harry, both of whom tried, unsuccessfully, to avoid stepping on any of the papers and books strewn across the floor.
Instead Harry stood against the railing, trying to calm himself and slow his heart. That kiss had been perhaps the most electrifying moment of his whole life to date, and Malfoy had just walked away without a word.
Harry waited.
“Oh, that reminds me – I’m looking forward to celebrating tomorrow.” He put extra emphasis on the word celebrating, hoping Malfoy would catch his hint.
“She looks perfectly normal, Potter.”
“Will they be worried?”
As promised, there was an empty seat, and enough food to spare, so Malfoy slotted in neatly between Harry and Hermione. Malfoy politely greeted everyone around the table, shaking hands with Neville’s girlfriend Calliope. Harry, grinning, subtly did a thumbs up at Neville – Calliope, tall and blonde and slim, was certainly attractive, and, judging by the way she looked at Neville, infatuated. Neville winked back, placing an arm around her shoulders proudly.
“She does this all the time, you get used to it.”
Neither said anything for a long time. Harry didn’t know what Malfoy was thinking, but he couldn’t help but feel responsible – someone must have known they’d interviewed Susan again, and had killed her before she could talk. She had suffered for a long time before she’d died – there had been an immense amount of pain, he was sure. Finally, he forced himself to look away.
To the left was Ginny and Luna, sat on a bench, bodies bowing in towards each other, both weeping, and Neville, still hopelessly clutching the bloody sword that had killed Nagini. Further out behind them was the rest of the Weasley clan, crowded around a motionless ginger body on the floor, Mr Weasley curved into Mrs Weasley’s warm embrace as they both sobbed.
“Wow, my baby sister, engaged! Can you believe it?” Ron was delighted, grinning widely. Harry agreed cheerfully, starting to pour out white wine into half the glasses as Ron did the same with red into the other half.
To the right of Harry, was the rest of the DA and the Order, more jubilant than those on Harry’s other side – relieved the war was won, they hugged and checked each other for injuries. Lavender was slumped, bleeding, on the ground, being tended to by the Patil twins, but there was a faint smile on her face, like she was glad to be alive. Behind them, shackled with silver chains, was Malfoy’s frail figure, face pale and miserable, and his mother beside him, statuesque, and the other surviving members of the other side.
As Bellchant bought his coffee from a muggle-born Auror in disguise, Malfoy faked a phone call to his girlfriend and Ron aimed his apple core at a bin, threw, and missed. The six year old girl kicked it merrily as she passed by with her mother on the way to drop some change in Scratch’s cup. As planned, he grinned at her, and she shied away at the sight of his teeth.
“It’s part of what we’re investigating.” Another lie, this one from Malfoy. “Can you tell us anything about your lost time?”
“My turn to talk, sorry!” He joked. “I love you too, Malfoy. You’ve changed my life for the better in so many ways, and these six months have been the best of my life. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.”
“I couldn’t tell Hermione – she’s on the case too, and if there’s any doubt about me, I have to be arrested, you know that.”
Harry stared at him in surprise.
“You don’t want to be disarmed.” Malfoy realised, eyes widening as he looked between Harry’s pained face and the wands on the table. Harry hadn’t realised it, but his hand had crept across the table to lay protectively over the Elder Wand, and he almost gagged – the whispering of the Elder wand rang through his mind all the time, even sang in his dreams. It took every ounce of his self-control not to succumb, not to finally wield it. He lived in perpetual fear that one day, he’d fail.
Harry actually laughed at that, and just as he did, Malfoy appeared over Connor’s shoulder, smiling. He saw who Harry was talking to and the relaxed, casual smile fell off his face. He frowned and turned away, and as he did, Harry noticed he was holding two champagne glasses. He felt guilty for some reason, and he couldn’t shake the feeling until he took another sip of his drink.
Harry couldn’t help but look for signs of Greyback on her skin, but her white skin was unblemished everywhere he could see, and he thought back to Malfoy’s broken voice saying “He did worse to Pansy” and realised he probably would never know quite what happened to her.
He turned to his own face, strong and almost square, scar on his forehead, half hidden by messy black hair, green eyes behind circular glasses. He closed his eyes, passed one hand slowly over his face, and then the other, right to left, then left to right. Then, without opening his eyes, he tapped his glasses with a fingernail, and then opened his eyes. His face was now framed by short, spiky blond hair. His eyes were a piercing blue, behind rectangle glasses, and the only marking on his face was a slight birthmark below his left eye. He frowned, and watched as a stranger frowned back.
“Harry!” Ron cried out, frustrated, and heads started to turn. Harry was still gawking at Malfoy, hearing every word he’d ever thought about him ringing in his ears.
“Oi, Harry, tell Ron his Chudley Cannons are shit!”
“Don’t need one, do I? I’m a Squib.” He spat, and Malfoy relaxed beside Harry. This cleared Jeremiah as a suspect, and additionally it suggested some strange, unpleasant things about his relationship with his sister, who so publicly had denounced Squibs as true wizards.
“She’s lucky it’s not Azkaban!” Harry barked, surprised at himself. The scar on his hand was tingling.
“This is something more, Draco.” He said softly, and leaned in, hand placed gently over the bloody imprint from before.
“Alright, mate, it’s not a date.”
Dean, trotting at a fast speed, led Harry away, into the maze of artwork in the centre of the room; he always earmarked a piece or two that he thought Harry would like, and he was always right. Dean slowed to a stop in front of a small painting of Hogwarts in its heyday, before the war and the renovations that had followed.
“So it’s Dark magic.” Harry agreed, trying to ignore some strange familiar feeling that was rising up inside him – he felt slightly off-kilter, like the world was upside down. He shook his head, dog-like shaking off water, and turned back round to face Malfoy, who said what they were both thinking.
“When did you first realise you liked me?” Harry asked, wondering privately when he’d first started to like Malfoy, even though he hadn’t realised it.
“I’ll make note of that for the future.”
“Can you spare the photo of Ron and Hermione? I doubt you’ll want that hanging up in your flat.”
“Yes. I’m dreaming that I’m killing people. I’m afraid.” He knew he couldn’t tell her about the Elder Wand, of course, but anything else was fair game.
“Yeah, and we have to make some sort of progress on either who took Cressida or who’s killing the werewolves, assuming they aren’t the same person.”
“Bellchant doesn’t care about blood purity, Harry, or at least it isn’t his priority – he seems uniquely focused on magical creatures, like werewolves.”
“Do you reckon they’ll be ginger?” Ron mused aloud.
They stood in comfortable silence for a moment, watching the remaining Aurors returning to their natural selves while Hermione hugged Ron tightly, loudly scolding him for his stupidity and kissing him for his bravery.
Malfoy looked briefly surprised, and then he nodded.
“I’m the master of the Elder Wand.” He didn’t know what else to say – how to explain the terror he felt every single day that he’d get disarmed, that he would condemn the world by being weak; how to describe his nightmares about seeing someone use the Wand to carry out unspeakable acts.
There was a knock at the front door. Harry, who’d been half asleep, shook himself awake. None of his spells had triggered, so it wasn’t a reporter or a muggle – must be a friend, then. Most likely Neville, or perhaps Ginny. He found himself hoping it was Malfoy, and then hoping it wasn’t.
Malfoy was looking pale, or at least paler than usual.
“I think we might be looking for a body.” Hermione agreed, peering through the darkness into the wide stretches of field surrounding them.
Thankfully, before his thoughts could spiral any further, Malfoy reappeared, gently knocking on the door before entering. Without any talking, both men got under the covers, Harry on the side closer to the door.
Harry rolled his eyes and kissed his boyfriend squarely on the lips before knocking on Ron and Hermione’s front door.
“Aw, cute, matching.” Harry said sarcastically, and Hermione smacked his arm, but all three were laughing.
Perhaps fifteen or twenty minutes later Hermione ran back into the room clutching several large envelopes. She distributed one each to Harry, Ron and Malfoy, keeping the largest for herself, looking pleased with herself as she sat back down.
“What about you?”
“Yes, of course. I’ll be outbidding you this year, Potter, just you wait!” Malfoy smirked a hollow smile at Harry, who smiled back.
“Beer. Dealer’s choice.”
“You know what we have to do next, don’t you?” Harry didn’t say it like a question, but Malfoy answered anyway.
He cast a Tempus charm in the mirror, obscuring his face as he brushed his teeth with vigour. Only five hours until he was due at Ron and Hermione’s – it was tradition that the three of them had a drink before heading to Pansy and Blaise’s party. But until then, he was at a loose end with nothing to do.
“I didn’t inform anyone, but perhaps my assistant may have known. I’ll ask her, if you like?”
Malfoy, smiling fondly at his niece, knelt down to adjust her grip.
The man interrupted, face melting into barely controlled rage. Malfoy flinched.
“You’re not…expecting…”
“Nothing, ‘Mione. Didn’t you read my note?”
“Your first Hogwarts letter?”
Harry darted down an alley and turned on the spot, appearing by his bed. He fell face first onto it, passed out.
“Ah, no surprise there then. Of course Lucius would like this shit.”
“And why she didn’t recognise me just now.”
“I’ll do that on Monday then, and if you send over all your Cressida notes I’ll have a look this weekend.”
He knew he was meeting Malfoy later that day, to write the first draft of their report for Savage, and, he supposed, to have a drink. It felt strange, the thought that he and Malfoy would drink alone, as they rarely spent time together, alone, outside of work. In fact, now he was thinking about it, he wasn’t sure if he’d ever spent time with just Malfoy when work wasn't involved.
“Some American witch? God, don’t let Hermione hear you saying that! Cressida Boone is famous for her campaigns for magical creature rights in America, you know.”
“Careful, Malfoy.” Hermione called out, unable to help herself, but she didn’t put down her plate of cake or move from her seat - the broom only flew three meters above the ground, and Roseanne was clearly having the time of her life.
Scratch’s long messy hair was tied back now, but his nails were as long as they had been before. He smiled this time, and Harry felt Malfoy flinch at the sight of his yellowing, sharp teeth, although Malfoy’s face remained pleasantly blank.
“To making the world a better place.” Harry said, thinking of the case they’d closed and the awful man they’d put behind bars.
Both her eyes were missing, and her throat had been slashed in the same way Susan’s had. It was impossible to tell in the dark if she’d been subjected to the Sectumsempra too, but Harry would bet she had. As he caught Malfoy’s eye in the gloom, he knew Malfoy was thinking the same.
Harry didn’t even say goodbye to Pansy, just turned on the spot and spun away, appearing outside Malfoy’s front door. He stood there for a long while, working up the courage to knock on it or to go home.
“That wasn’t a lie, it was just…an omission?”
“Oh, Draco darling, don’t you look lovely?” She tugged him into a tight hug, ruffling his hair. “So smart, so handsome…”
Harry sat silently for several long hours, a half-finished report abandoned in front of him, seemingly unaware of the tears streaming down his cheeks.
“Actually, I reckon it was that kidnapping case in Wales – I hated that French witch so much for no reason.”
“Try to look casual, Malfoy – we’re not going on a catwalk.” Harry called out as Malfoy left, laughing at his mock offended face as he stepped through the fireplace.
Harry and Malfoy appeared on the edge of a large wooded area. Although it was early morning where they stood, further in between the trees it appeared to be twilight, and Harry shivered automatically. Malfoy looked over at Harry, mouth slightly open as though he planned to say something, before he turned and strode into the forest. Harry quickly cast a location spell and, following him, adjusted their course slightly – Hermione had told them it was likely the pack would reside in the centre of the forest, but that they should approach from the west.
They returned to Malfoy’s bedroom, and Harry sat awkwardly on the edge of Malfoy’s bed. Smiling, Malfoy got Harry a t-shirt and a pair of trackies, and then vanished into the bathroom while Harry got changed in his room.
They swayed in silence for some time, peaceful and happy, until Luna appeared beside them.
“Are you serious?”
The distance allowed Harry to release the breath he’d been holding. Harry didn’t reply – he was too busy looking at Malfoy as he’d never looked at him before. His white blond hair, silvery in the moonlight, was slicked back sharply, framing his angular face. His eyes, grey, peered out at Harry from under pale eyebrows. His lips were contorted into a grimace of concern at Harry’s state.
“I don’t believe anything is inevitable, Harry.” Luna said disapprovingly. “Besides, you’ve got the strongest will of anyone I’ve met. Nothing can control you if you don’t want it to.”
“So we need to get her alone, then?”
“These are all Hogwarts students?” Gobsmacked, Ron poked his envelope with dismay, looking as though it might combust spontaneously. Harry viewed his own package with similar suspicion.
“Hi, Susan. We have a few questions for you, if you don’t mind?”
“Nah, haven’t found the right person yet.” Malfoy seemed to be falling asleep and Harry, feeling the effects of the wine, thought perhaps they should return to their homes.
“I have a guest!” Harry cried out as he stepped through the fireplace just ahead of Malfoy, hoping it would help contain Ron and Ginny’s weekly madness. It was a futile hope, he realised, as Ginny immediately called out to him, trying to get him involved in some sibling bicker she was having, energetically, with Ron as they served up.
“Thanks. Thought he rather deserved it.”
Susan’s eyes flicked up and looked straight at Harry for the first time since sitting down, caught off guard. Harry’s voice had been to sharp, too keen - Harry imagined a dog with its hackles raised – that was the feeling he got as Susan stared at him, defensive.
He hated feeling like he treated them as emotional guard dogs, keeping out his most negative thoughts, but they both constantly reassured him that it was normal for friends to look out for each other – that’s what love was, after all, and didn’t they all love each other? Harry could never disagree with that.
“So did Severus teach the killer the spell before he died? Or did he learn it the same way you did?”
“Wait a second. We’re still wearing our robes.” Malfoy said at the same time, pulling out his wand.
“Oh, I’m sure you are, he’d be mad not to date you.” Hermione smiled at him as Ron enthusiastically nodded his head.
“He talks about me?” Harry asked, surprised, absurdly pleased.
Harry moved on, and noticed Ron’s inelegant form slouched against a tree, eating an apple. He looked totally unrecognisable as the famous war hero, with his nondescript brown hair and a birthmark scrawled across his cheek.
“Hermione, what on earth are these?”
Harry realised he was stood alone, lost in thought as he had been, and turned to find a friend or, failing that, a drink. Instead, he found himself facing a tall, dark blond man who was reaching out to tap Harry on the shoulder.
“Nah, I reckon we’ll find out when she gets back.”
“That’s the Resurrection Stone, isn’t it? The third Deathly Hallow.”
“Hermione, we’ve got nothing, we’ve got to try something else.”
“What do you mean, Potter?” Malfoy said tiredly, rubbing his hand across his eyes, leaning against the doorframe.
“Ah, go on, mate. Hermione’s been nagging me to eat more healthy crap, but if you’re eating some, she won’t mind.”
“I’m going for a drink to celebrate the end of this case. Don’t suppose you’d be interested?” Malfoy asked, resolutely not looking at Harry.
The light revealed a ditch roughly thirty feet ahead of them, and the four hesitantly made their way towards it, expecting the worst but hoping for the best. As they drew close, Ron recoiled, covering his nose. The other three were slower to recognise the stench, unable to separate it from usual countryside smells, but they soon caught on.
“Not my fault you take hours to get ready.” Harry snapped.
Harry relaxed against the small kitchen table and smiled. Since moving in, he’d given up his second bedroom as a guest room for any friend who might need a place to stay in London – Neville, who travelled almost constantly when he wasn’t working at Hogwarts as Herbology Professor, didn’t rent in London and therefore was Harry’s most frequent temporary flatmate.
“I…broke a glass.” He felt dazed, like he was in a dream. Malfoy moved towards him, fast, and Harry flinched backwards, collapsed into a seat, wincing as his arm hit the railings.
“He’s on the run. He’s the one that did this.”
“Merlin, Potter, give it a minute, we’ve only just got here!” He threw himself into the seat opposite Harry, adding “wish you were this keen to work at the office.”
“Harry Potter, will you do me the honour of marrying me?”
For once, he noticed Ron and Hermione sharing a half-amused, half-exasperated glance.
“Why?” Harry couldn’t understand – he’d been the opposite of scared – he’d been on top of the world with Malfoy’s lips on his.
Harry spent a few more precious minutes in bed before, grumbling all the while, he made his way into the bathroom, where he kept a small stock of Hermione’s various patented potions. He took a heavy dose of her hangover remedy and finished getting ready for work, leaving just in time not to be late.
The man was silent, observing, for a long time.
Harry stepped out of the green fire into the large living room of Ron and Hermione’s flat, greeted by the delicious smell of curry. He could hear Ron and Ginny chatting in the kitchen as they cooked, and sat on a large red sofa was Hermione and Luna, laughing merrily at something Luna had just finished saying.
“It’s charmed with the same spells on the ceiling of the Great Hall at Hogwarts.” Dean said, proud of his find, and Harry saw it in a different light – the dark blues of the sky and the shimmering silver of stars would be gone in the morning, replaced with the burning oranges and pale blues of dawn.
“Malfoy, are we…” he paused. Malfoy continued making pancakes, twisting his wand in circles above the pan. “Are we dating now?”
“Thanks for helping, you two, I know it isn’t officially your case.”
Harry and Malfoy quickly made their apologies and left the house. They made their way back to the cottage and sat at the table, writing up their notes. Harry checked his watch, and saw that he would be expected at Ron and Hermione’s soon.
“What the fuck, Potter?”
The village was peaceful and picturesque, with little brick houses and tiny, winding lanes. Screaming seagulls flew in circles high above them and the salty scent of the sea filled the air. Harry and Malfoy chatted quietly as they walked, Harry cheerily pointing out an old sweet shop and declaring that before the case was over he’d buy one of everything in there. Malfoy laughed, as though he was joking, but Harry was serious – it had been a long time since he’d lived with the Dursleys, but he’d never quite gotten over that sickening feeling that he was missing out.
Everybody clapped and cheered, Harry included.
He crawled out of bed in search of Malfoy, who he found already dressed and showered, eating breakfast at the kitchen table.
Fifteen minutes later (Luna always ran late) she let him into her office and they sat on beanbags together.
“So you’re not dating that French witch anymore?”
“We always go to muggle London. Less chance of being recognised.”
“Forensics are on the way. We should get back to Ministry.”
Harry thought back to a case about six months ago, when a young French witch had made multiple obvious passes at Malfoy, and coincidentally Harry had instantly hated her.
“Yes! Yes, I’ll marry you, Draco Malfoy.”
“Right, we have to discuss yesterday’s meeting with the Northumberland pack.”
Harry would find himself getting distracted, thinking about what his next case would be, or how Ginny’s wedding planning was going, or if Neville had taken the next step with Calliope. Then he’d remember Malfoy’s mocking voice saying “You’re full of shit” and suddenly he’d be raring to go again, ready to punch through his bedroom wall.
“Probably shouldn’t spend any more of my salary in one night!” Harry joked, and everyone around them laughed. Malfoy smiled brightly at him as he signed the paper Seamus held out to him.
“Yes, Potter, we’re boyfriends, partners, gay lovers. Pancake?” Malfoy flipped a pancake onto a plate and pushed it towards Harry, who was grinning widely.
Harry stuck his tongue out at Malfoy, half elated to finally have gotten a joke out of him, and half embarrassed it had taken such a stupid comment to do it. Malfoy rolled his eyes back at him, cracking a tiny smile. Preoccupied with each other, neither man saw Hermione and Ron sigh and share a glance.
Both Harry and Malfoy had been to every single gala Dean and Seamus had hosted, each donating obscenely large amounts of money to their charity, Help for War Orphans; Dean and Seamus had become singularly dedicated to helping innocent people who had suffered during wizarding wars, and they now travelled the world to help anyone affected by any magical skirmishes and find artwork to sell at their charity galas.
Harry and Malfoy made their way through the thronging crowd to the front, joining Ron and Hermione, who shared a smirking glance before greeting them with smiles. Dean and Seamus worked their way through countless pieces of artwork, one of which included a portrait of Diagon Alley, which Ron and Hermione bought, before reaching a beautiful set of magical photographs taken at the previous art gala, just a few months ago.
Back at the cottage, Harry returned their clothes to their natural state as Malfoy put their pasties on plates. He’d split the spare one in half without discussion, and Harry couldn’t help but smile.
Malfoy laughed, a quick burst of noise, and his whole body relaxed. Harry smiled up at him, glad that he’d cut the tension and told the truth at the same time.
Thinking quickly as Malfoy made his next bid, Harry shrugged when Dean and Malfoy turned to him, waiting for him to wave his paddle.
“He cast the killing curse on me. Again. Except this time, it worked.” Harry’s voice shook with the memories, and he instinctively put his fingers to the pulse point on his throat (as he always did when he remembered that night), reassured only by the beating of his heart. You came back, he said to himself, as he always did. You came back.
There was an awkward silence that spoke of all the years they’d spent hating each other at school, each believing the other had it better, and was a worse person for it. Harry didn’t want any more silence – he was tired of it.
“Oh, shit, I just realised Ron and Hermione don’t know where I am.”
“Hang on, mate…those clothes aren’t yours.” Ron narrowed his eyes at Harry’s clothing – Malfoy’s trackies and t-shirt, both of which were a little long on him, and designer to boot.
They had ruled out the three before, deciding they were incredibly unpleasant, but unlikely killers. Each unsuccessful visit had put Harry more on edge, as though something was on the tip of his tongue and he couldn’t quite remember what. A dark, unnerving thought was stirring inside him. Trying to shrug off the feeling, Harry reach out and knocked.
“Do you know why I always have so much stuff nowadays? I wasn’t allowed to own anything with my muggle relatives. I had to sleep in a cupboard under the stairs, actually.”
“Don’t worry, Harry, I’m staying with Calliope tonight – flat’s all yours again.” Neville winked at Harry and walked through the fire with Calliope.
“Let me fix your hand.” Ron said, stepping into his line of vision.
He held the stone gingerly, as though it might explode, and turned it over three times in his palm. A shadow appeared before him, slowly transforming into the grey wispy figure of Remus Lupin.
Harry left the Department of Magical Transport with more questions than he’d had going in – he’d spoken to four people in the last few hours, and three of them had seemed totally unaware that Cressida was missing, or what she’d been doing in the UK. He would check them out anyway, of course, but he was pretty sure they weren’t involved.
Harry stood up, furious. It had been a long time since someone he cared about had believed the lies the Prophet told on a regular basis – since fifth year, in fact, when people had refused to believe Voldemort was back. It hurt more than he would have expected, not to be trusted.
“I was scared.”
Harry did try writing Savage’s report, spending at least an hour sat at his desk clutching a dripping quill, but he couldn’t write more than a few words without getting distracted. Sat neatly in the trash was a short letter from Connor Johnson, saying he’d be at the party and was looking forward to seeing Harry. He kept taking it out and reading it, and then throwing it away again in a flash of annoyance.
If Malfoy was concerned by Harry’s implication that the Elder Wand could want things, he didn’t say, instead choosing to return to their notes on werewolf etiquette. Harry carefully stowed away his wands and breathed a deep sigh of relief.
“Yes.”
“You’re ridiculous.” He told Harry, but he was smiling too. “Also, if we’re late for the party, I’m going to let Granger castrate you.”
“Right, well, let’s see what we can do.” Harry rolled up his sleeves and snagged the second apron from behind the kitchen door. As he carefully instructed Neville on what to do, they caught up on each other’s news from the last few months, from travelling to work to friends, eventually landing on the topic of dating.
Harry nodded thoughtfully, remembering all the emotions that he’d felt in the moments after killing Voldemort – he’d felt so tired, and hollow, and alone, and so fucking afraid.
Harry flinched. Malfoy looked curiously over at him.
“We are not trusting creatures. We are not forgiving. But we will grant you one chance. Work with us and find our killer. If you betray us, we will rip you to shreds.” He growled and turned away, bored of the conversation.
“I’m not. I’m not sorry.” In for a dime, in for a dollar, Harry figured. Things would be awkward at work now anyway, no harm in making it worse.
“Merlin, I love you.”
“You’ve got muggle money, right?” Harry asked, suddenly afraid Malfoy was going to produce a sickle at the bar.
Harry didn’t say anything – it was Malfoy’s turn to start whatever difficult conversation was about to be had. There was a long silence – Harry refused to speak first, and it seemed Malfoy had come only to stare at him sullenly from several feet away, so Harry started to close the door.
“Not really interested, I guess. Haven’t met anybody worth it.”
“Yes, I think you do. I haven’t seen you this relaxed in weeks.”
Ron and Hermione embraced, and Harry realised again that, surrounded as he was by all his friends, he was the only single one amongst them. But although that thought tugged at his heart, he couldn’t help but feel the same joy that Pansy and Blaise, spinning in circles in each other’s arms, were clearly feeling.
He couldn’t believe he hadn’t known how he felt about Malfoy – it was a constant drumbeat in his heart now, he wasn’t sure he’d ever forget. How long had he felt that way? How embarrassing, to be told by Ron he was in love with someone.
There was a pause.
“Malfoy, get back in here! Luna needs your help.”
“Where did you stay last night?” Ron said shrewdly, and Harry felt his face heat up slightly.
Harry, shocked, reared back, suddenly indignant. How dare Malfoy demand all of his deepest secrets? How dare Malfoy demand transparency and truth when secrets had saved Harry’s life and won the war?
Neville and Calliope stood, hand in hand, and headed to the fireplace.
The conversation turned to news about friends and colleagues, as Pansy eagerly shared any gossip she’d acquired in the last few weeks since she’d been back in London. Pansy was an excellent story teller, and was even better at piecing together facts to create the story.
“Only on Friday?”
Phase one of his plan was complete, then. He could only hope the second phase went as smoothly. He crossed his fingers.
“You’re right. I should talk to him. Right?”
Shucking on a jacket Hermione had gifted him last year, he glanced in a mirror on his way to the door, helplessly patting the black shock of hair that sat atop his head.
Hermione sipped her sparkling water and rested her head against Harry’s shoulder for a moment, smiling up at him.
“Did you hear that?”
“To a night we won’t remember!” Ron cheered. Hermione blushed and rolled her eyes, embarrassed – last year she’d gotten so drunk she’d lost large chunks of the night, a fact that neither Ron nor Harry were willing to let her forget.
“Sorry, sorry, I overslept.” He replied, throwing himself into the uncomfortable chair behind his desk. He glared over at Malfoy, who lounged so casually that Harry thought he must have spelled his chair into shape somehow.
“I’m not wearing even remotely the sort of clothes I should wear if I’m going in there, Malfoy…”
“Yes, I am. I am very glad to be a guest to their wedding – it is an honour.”
He left Luna’s shop and, checking the time, swore – early afternoon already and he’d done nothing he’d agreed with Malfoy. Malfoy was checking out other werewolf murders in the country, so Harry had to interview anybody who’d known Cressida Boone was in England. That included Hermione, but he figured he’d check in with her last – he knew it was biased, but he couldn’t ever imagine suspecting her for something like this.
“Do you realise how much this could have change everything? We can solve all our cases so much quicker!” Malfoy reached out his hand to touch it, but Harry panicked, pulling his hand away, suddenly pale and sweating.
“Of course she did – don’t you know yet there’s nothing she can’t do?”
“What the hell happened?”
Harry didn’t say anything, but he leant his head on her shoulder as she leant against the railing beside him.
Harry and Malfoy hurriedly made their polite goodbyes and followed their original guide to the edge of the forest, where they promise to return in several days with more news. Then they apparated into the cottage where, to Harry’s horror, Malfoy fainted.
“Nah, mate, it sounds like a date.”
Harry had never thought about it before, but Malfoy’s face was striking – the sharp angles of his jaw and cheekbones, the softer inward curves of his cheeks – it wouldn’t be considered handsome (beautiful, perhaps?) but there was something about it. His face was almost hard to look at it – you’d have to learn it to love it. But then, isn’t that exactly what Harry had done? Without even realising it, he’d fallen in love with Draco Malfoy.
“Harry, you git, where were you last night? You missed out on a banging night, mate! Katie and Oliver got so drunk they staged a Quidditch match without brooms! And you should have seen Cormac! He put on the karaoke and started dancing to Celestina Warbreck! Reply ASAP that you’re coming tonight or I’ll come and find you, idiot!”
Harry gasped. He’d never have guessed that this was coming, but he couldn’t be happier that it had. He stared at Malfoy for several long seconds, unable to voice his delight.
They arrived outside Pansy and Blaise’s country manor, lit up by the bright coloured lanterns strung up along the driveway. There was a hum of noise, of laughter, coming from ahead of them as the three followed other well-dressed people towards the house.
“Jesus Christ.” Hermione whispered as she stared down into the ditch, carefully pushing several bramble bushes out of the way to reveal Cressida Boone’s dead and decaying body.
“Two o’clock.” Harry hissed in his ear. “That’s Susan, the woman I mentioned yesterday.”
Malfoy stood, frozen, half in, half out the room, carefully taking stock of each person present. Harry realised he’d forgotten to mention that Neville and his latest girlfriend would be coming to dinner too, rounding out the number at eight, counting Malfoy. Malfoy took a deep breath and stepped fully in, smiling round at everybody. Neville and his girlfriend were already sat at the table, listening with amusement to Ron and Ginny’s bickering about the Chudley Cannons.
“I think this is news he should hear of first, if that is acceptable to you.”
“Stop staring and get on with it, Potter.” Malfoy snapped, and Harry started.
There was a couple of seconds of silence where Harry’s friends watched him, knowing he had something to say.
Harry added the date of Pansy’s event (with ‘REMIND RON’ written next to it in large letters) and sent the letters through the flames to Hermione’s office.
“Mine, too. Reminds me of going back to Hogwarts.”
Malfoy agreed, but said he had to return home to change clothes before they could leave for the park.
Harry smiled gratefully at Malfoy as he stood up.
Jumping out of bed, he rooted around under his bed for some time, studiously and passionately ignoring the heavily charmed box at the back, and finally came up to breathe with a huge stack of papers, tied together with bright red string.
“What do we do, Hermione?” Harry implored her for an answer, and was surprised when Malfoy asked Ron for his advice.
“I’m sorry, Harry. I’m sorry I said those things, I’m sorry I didn’t trust you.”
“Voldemort lost the war, and when he fell, the old Ministry fell too. The people who lead it now are just and fair, and unbiased.” Still silence, so Harry continued. “Hermione Granger, she’s the Head of Magical Creatures, and she’s a good person. She wants to make your lives better for you, in whatever way you want it. She doesn’t want to control or regulate werewolves – she’s trying to legalise you as people, not creatures.”
“I’ve seen countless of my friends and family die right in front of me! My parents, Sirius, Dumbledore, Cedric, Dobby, and that’s all before the war really even started! I was abused and tortured by my muggle relatives, by Umbridge, by Voldemort himself! I was on the run being hunted for a year! I was forced to become a cold blooded murderer! I died! I sacrificed myself because I trusted Dumbledore and he led me like a lamb to the slaughter! The only people in the world I could trust to have my back were Ron and Hermione. After all that, why should I believe it’s any different now?”
Harry rolled his eyes and ducked under Malfoy’s arm, trying to contain his smile.
“Ron told me on Friday night how I felt, I’m glad I’m not the only one who had to be told!”
“Stylish.” Malfoy smirked, and Harry rolled his eyes.
He double checked his appearance in the mirror again, and Apparated to Ron and Hermione’s – they always went to the galas together – they knew how miserable these events made him, and they always did their best to make sure he was OK.
“Alright, boys, this is very important. You’ll have to act as diplomats first, Aurors second. Please remember that.” She implored both of them as they stood in in front of her dressed in formal black robes in Cressida’s cottage.
“That’s the third time, Potter.”
And so Harry turned up at Luna’s shop in Diagon Alley, praying she’d be there – and she was. She greeted Harry with a wide smile and told him if he waited ten minutes she’d be able to chat.
“Severus once mentioned a house mate of his named Bellchant, said he was a real piece of work.” He looked horrified, turning to face Harry with wide eyes. “If I’d known he was still around….”
“Connor Johnson from the Falmouth Falcons asked me out, but I said no, obviously. He’s not really my type.”
They were late to the party, by a solid hour, but before Hermione could even make her trademark face of disappointment and disapproval, Harry waved a large wrapped present in the air. Roseanne leaped off her chair and almost threw herself on the floor in her hurry to greet her uncles.
“You told him it was mine, actually, and that you’d won it off me.” He paused. “Is that it?” He gestured to it, laying harmlessly on the table, looking so unlike the weapon of war and death and madness that it was.
“We’ll have to redo it anyway, so I can’t see the harm in that.”
Suddenly, as though startled out of a daydream, Malfoy turned his cool gaze to Harry.
Malfoy had pretended to be offended, but really he was delighted to be included in the wedding. Six months of dating Harry and he could still hardly believe he was now a part of the family.
But the fourth person he’d interviewed, the Deputy Head of the Portkey Office, Susan Darling, had left him feeling uncomfortable. All her answers had been exactly what Harry wanted to hear, and she’d been perfectly polite and helpful, but something in her eyes had unsettled him. He hadn’t asked anything about werewolves, which, in hindsight, was a blessing – whether or not she was involved, it was safer to keep the two cases separate in the public eye.
“Not sure yet, somewhere muggle. Malfoy said to meet him at his and we’d apparate together.”
“Potter, I don’t think I can do this.”
Harry was pleased – this was a subtle way to find out what Malfoy was into, as well as who he was into.
“You don’t have a wand, do you?” Harry realised aloud. Jeremiah sat back down suddenly, face blank.
“Does that mean the rest of the Deathly Hallows are real?”
“I’ll need an answer at some point, but no rush, Potter.” Malfoy added sarcastically, but the smile on his face told Harry he wasn’t worried – Harry’s larger than life grin had to be a dead giveaway of what his answer would be.
Amused that Hermione thought she’d ever get Ron to stop eating constantly, Harry took a handful of crisps and started to munch on them. He felt something stir at the thought of having somebody to nag him about his eating habits, but he forgot about it when Hermione appeared in the living room, towelling her hair. She looked surprised, then pleased, to see him sat on their sofa.
“Very polite, for an American, she is. Said she’s researching something in the area, needed access to books and the internet.”
“I didn’t need the blanket, you know.” He said sourly as he sat down beside Harry, looking surprised as Sue served up a large English breakfast and a tea almost immediately. Harry thanked her, handing her a tenner and telling her to keep the change.
“Ok, so we need to do deep background on her.”
Hermione didn’t bother to reply, instead continuing to flick through the files of Hermans with criminal records, to no avail.
The dragon suddenly came to life, flying on cloth wings into the middle of the room, coughing up smoke and sparks. It flew for some minutes around the impressed and excited group, landing on Ron’s ginger head and Harry’s shoulder, and Malfoy looked pleased as it flapped its wings in his face for a moment. It finally completed its cycle around the room, stopping in front of Ginny, where it coughed up bright red sparks spelling out “Will you marry me?” Everyone turned to look at Luna, who held out a beautiful silver ring to Ginny, who burst into happy tears and leant down to kiss her, saying “Yes, yes, yes!” Over and over again.
“Go see Luna.”
“He’s certainly a cold-blooded killer – Susan and Alison mark the 13th and 14th of his kills that we know about. The first ten are werewolves from the Northumberland pack, and another two that you two believe are his, but haven’t identified yet.” Hermione resurfaced from under the table, face pale, sweaty, but determined.
“Surprise!” She laughed. “You’re invited to our wedding!”
“Hello, Harry. You looked a bit awkward over there.” Luna stated, airily kissing both his cheeks.
“But seriously, I just need to know a few things for the Cressida Boone case.”
As Bellchant offered Scratch a pastry, making friendly small talk, Harry knew that Hermione, watching from the clock tower, was quickly casting an anti-Apparate spell. They couldn’t make their move until she’d finished and given them a signal, and so Scratch patiently accepted the pastry, grunting as he scarfed it down.
Several days later Harry and Malfoy sat around Cressida’s little table, reading and rereading the notes on werewolf etiquette that Hermione had sent through. Malfoy had been quieter than usual, and Harry knew what was coming.
“I talked about the Elder Wand. I told him it was mine.”
“Right.” Hermione agreed. Harry sat there, not moving. “What are you waiting for, Harry? Go on.”
“I cracked her code! Took me most of the night, but I worked out a spell that would decipher it.” He pushed a stack of paper towards Harry and waved his wand, muttering under his breath. As Harry watched, the letters and words rearranged themselves on paper. It reminded him vaguely of something Ron had said once, about how letters never seemed to stay in the right places when he was trying to read. He wondered if this spell could be adapted to help him.
“No. But I know of you, boy. Returned from death itself. The stench clings to you. And beneath that, I smell your burning power.”
Malfoy had no time to recover, however, as Hermione immediately appeared behind him, looking ready to burst – her due date was almost upon her, but of course that didn’t slow her down.
“She hasn’t been here.” Malfoy paused to sip his drink. “I haven’t been here with anybody else – I didn’t think they’d feel the same way about it as I do.”
“Of course! We love you, Harry, and we couldn’t think of a better namesake.” Hermione replied, smiling at him.
“So you’re my boyfriend?”
“I love you too.”
“So would I! She’s fearsome on the pitch.”
Harry slept late again the next day, waking up just after midday. His head was throbbing as he slowly opened his eyes, and his mouth was disgustingly dry. He blindly groped for his glasses and the small vial he always kept on his bedside table. He swallowed a couple of swigs of Hermione’s hangover remedy, feeling a tingle as the fog in his head cleared away.
Harry stood beside him and stared at the painting, looking at each detail until he thought he knew it by heart. There was Ron and Hermione, faces tired and sad, but relieved, hands tightly clasped as they looked towards Harry, centre frame, on his knees on the dirty floor, face terribly pained. Just behind him was the shadow of Voldemort’s dead body, still crumpled where it had fallen.
As though to prove his point, the bartender, a dark haired, tall, tattooed man, called out Malfoy’s name. Malfoy grinned back, waving, as he led Harry to a small table in the corner. Harry sat down but Malfoy remained standing.
He knew it would look shabby compared to Malfoy’s pressed shirt and slacks, but Malfoy had been his partner for years now, he knew what to expect when it came to Harry. Besides, it was just a work meeting, so there was no reason to dress up, really.
After a few more minutes of discussing details, Hermione left, saying she’d thought of a perfect prank to get back at Ron, and Harry left quickly after. Unlike the day before, though, he instead stepped straight into his own two-bedroom flat in central London. He, Ron and Hermione had lived together in Grimmauld Place for two years after the war, until they’d gotten married and moved out. Harry, unwilling to live there alone, had also moved out, into his current flat.
Hermione made him a cup of tea and the three sat around the kitchen table, chatting about the night before. Ron and Hermione tactfully avoided the topic of Malfoy, and Harry realised that Pansy was right – they probably thought they’d fought.
He wasn’t doing a very good job of not thinking about Malfoy.
“Why’d he wink?” Malfoy, almost slurring, addressed Harry, who shrugged, equally confused. Malfoy nodded, as though he’d got an answer, and leaned back into the chair, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. Harry didn’t bat an eyelid, surprised at himself for how casual it felt.
Harry nodded, understanding – he had passed so many nights sat alone in his living room just watching the night sky turn orange and pink.
There was a few seconds of tense silence.
Harry looked suspiciously at the bacon and cheese flavoured crisps, and shook his head. Ron was continuously finding new, disgusting junk foods that no-one else was willing to risk trying.
“Hmm, probably about a year and a half ago – you got injured when we stopped that Gringotts bank robbery. I was so worried about you and couldn’t work it out until Pansy told me why.”
“Don’t be stupid, Potter. I never say anything I don’t mean.”
“What? In love with who?” Distracted, Harry turned back to Ron, feeling heat in his stomach.
“Not my fault you still haven’t learnt that after three years of marriage.” Malfoy replied, one arm resting on the doorframe, and leaned in to kiss Harry on his pouted lips.
“Wait!” Harry stood too, ignoring Malfoy’s panicked hand grabbing his robes.
Then there were the ones about his career – “Harry Potter – addicted to the thrill of the kill?” “Potter – a boy in a man’s world” (when he joined the Aurors), “Chosen One – not chosen?” (This one came after Ron’s promotion, which Harry himself had suggested).
“Hermione brewed me this amazing Pepper-up potion, worked wonders.”
After an hour of talking, Luna suggested a second therapeutic tattoo – rather than using normal ink, it would be spelled and charmed with a particular purpose. Harry agreed, and held out his arm – she’d chosen each of his previous tattoos (the silver lily, the Deathly Hallows symbol on his right shoulder, and the Sirius star he’d had done after the war) and so he trusted her to choose right this time too.
“Nice touch with the pigeon.”
Malfoy nodded, looking almost amused, and they returned to Ron and Hermione’s conversation.
“Pansy mentioned the theme to Hermione in a letter.” Harry gloated, grinning and sipping his beer.
And behind them all were the countless rows of the shadowy bodies of the fallen, Tonks and Lupin among them.
“Ronald, you can’t call him Vicky forever, you know.”
“Of course I do, Potter. My nannies used to read the tale of the Deathly Hallows to me when I was a child. I just always assumed it was a bedtime story, a ghost story of sorts.”
For the first time ever, Harry saw Blaise wipe away a solitary tear as he smiled back at Pansy.
“Can you do me a favour?” Harry whispered to Malfoy as the bidding for the next item started.
“Malfoy? I’m back.”
“Are you experiencing memory blanks? Losing periods of time?” Malfoy’s voice was soft and sympathetic, non-judgemental.
“Oi, Ginny, get back in here, we’re not done!” Ron bellowed from the kitchen. “Actually, I might need someone else too.”
Malfoy shot Harry’s receding back with a helpless glance and followed Hermione away. Although Harry had warned him, he hadn’t believed in Ginny and Luna’s wackiness, or in Hermione’s perfectionism. She had said at least five times so far today “it has to be perfect, or you’re doing it again.” It was almost enough to drive a man mad, except how could he be mad when they loved him enough to want him there?
This made sense to Harry. “I guess I’m an easier target if I think I’ve already given in…”
“Don’t be silly, Harry. Anyone who can love someone else’s child that much definitely wants to be a father. I mean, look at him.” Luna gestured to Malfoy, who had taken over Harry Frederick duty so Ron could have two slices of cake.
“I’ve always been wise, Harry!” Hermione replied as Ron, Ginny and Luna burst into the room carrying pots and pans of curry and rice and naan bread. Everyone settled around the table and started to eat, talking loudly and merrily.
“Aurors Potter and Malfoy! What happened?” Susan’s voice finally rang out, echoing through the small room.
“Yeah. They’re normally about the war.”
“I’m going back to my flat. You know where to find me if you feel like growing up.”
Harry stared at Hermione for a second, gobsmacked, before he caught himself.
Both faces were the excellent transfiguration work of Headmistress Minerva McGonagall herself early that morning, as were countless others around him. In fact, as he surveyed his surroundings, he saw that Hermione and Shacklebolt had done as they’d promised: there was not a single muggle in the entire courtyard, including the people working in the shops. Instead, there were thirty odd wizards and witches, transfigured to be unrecognisable, ready and waiting for Herman Bellchant; even the six year old girl begging her mother for a chocolate bar was an Auror, wand tucked in her pink wellies.
“Going for a drink with Malfoy later.” He said. “Gonna write Savage’s report.”
“Nice?! You don’t want someone nice?”
Harry and Malfoy took a seat at the table and began to rustle through the papers. Malfoy worked in silence, carefully taking notes with his left hand as he read, but Harry, as always, felt the silence closing in on him and instead twisted his hands in the air, charming a quill to take notes as he spoke aloud anything interesting that he read.
Malfoy leaned down, kissed him, gently. Their kisses before had been heated and intense, but this kiss was softer spoken – it was more honest, more brave.
“I thought your mum might have told you what happened that night.” He said quietly.
Harry was surprised.
Harry opened his eyes to see Malfoy standing over the body, looking like he might throw up. Harry unwillingly joined him and stared down at Susan’s naked dead body. Deep wounds marked her abdomen, arms and legs, blood pooled and congealing on the sheets beneath her. One eye had been cut out, placed on the pillow beside her, and her throat had been slashed. Harry ran his fingers through the air above her body, identifying the Sectumsempra curse on most of the wounds except her throat and eye, which had seemingly been done by a knife.
“Malfoy, when have I ever had flings?” It was true – Harry hardly even went on dates, and everyone knew it. Harry reached out, turned Malfoy’s face to him gently.
Francoise seemed proud to have met Hermione, and Harry smiled – she was a famous war hero and a prominent Ministry figure dead set on making the world a better place – there really wasn’t a better person to be found, except perhaps her husband, who Harry thought fit the bill just as well.
Malfoy flicked to the next page – a photo of Harry from this afternoon, walking home from Ron and Hermione’s (he figured he needed the exercise) – the caption described Harry coming back from ‘yet another’ one night stand. It was true that he looked messy, with his wild hair and ill-fitting clothes, but Harry didn’t think it warranted a whole article.
Dinner passed in a blur of noise and laughter, with Ginny and Luna telling everybody about some bizarre adventure they’d had a few months ago while travelling, and Harry and Neville countering with their wildest experience in Mexico a few years ago. Hermione was, of course, horrified by their “stupid, reckless behaviour”, which only made everyone laugh more – even Hermione, who, after spending years with Ron, could now happily be the brunt of a harmless joke without being offended.
Harry thought for a second.
“I am Francoise Benoit, a colleague of Pansy and Blaise’s from the French Ministry. You are Harry Potter, correct?”
Harry chuckled as Ginny leant down to give Harry a tight hug, glad to see her. Ginny was often away travelling with the Harpies, and recently he’d only been seeing her about once a month. Luna, too, had been away a lot – she’d recently started travelled with Ginny, using the opportunity to give her tattoos to people across the world. He was glad to see both of them.
Baffled by Ron’s strangely sincere behaviour, Harry left, followed by Ron.
They were silent for a long while, each imagining the horror Susan must have felt to realise the man she trusted was using her, and the pain she must have felt before she died.
“Can I come in?”
Malfoy didn’t reply, instead aggressively turning the pages of the paper, although he clearly wasn’t reading it at the pace he was going.
“And how is that my problem?” Malfoy finally looked up, annoyed. He crumpled the newspaper between his hands and threw it, with more force than necessary, at the bin.
Malfoy’s face was frozen in shock. It was the most open and honest Harry had ever been with him about the war – usually Harry brushed off his questions, or made a passing comment but refused to explain it.
Malfoy’s dig shook Harry out of his surprise, returning them to what felt like familiar ground.
“Did I see you two coming down from that old cottage on the hill?” Without waiting for a reply, she continued. “We thought it was being rented by that lovely American woman, didn’t we, George?”
Harry pulled away from Malfoy, embarrassed and awkward, but Malfoy had already turned away, picking up the Portkey and holding it out to Hermione and Ron. Trying not to feel disappointed for some reason, Harry reached out and they all spun upside down.
Without thinking about it, Harry reached his own hand out to still Malfoy’s shaking hand. He relaxed and loosened his grip on his wand, allowing Harry to pluck it out of his hand and tuck it gently into the pocket of his jacket. Harry felt on fire where he’d touched Malfoy, and he coughed awkwardly to cover up his embarrassment.
“Good. I’m not in the mood to sign any autographs today.” Or ever, Harry added mentally, grimacing at the thought of hordes of people all crying out his name, crowding closer to touch him. Six years had not diminished his fame or popularity with the general population, much to his dismay.
Harry felt a tap on his shoulder and spun around, coming face to face with Connor Johnson. He felt his heart twist and he forced a smile.
Once they’d eaten their fill, and drank an entire bottle of wine between them, they slumped back on the sofa, feeling lethargic, until Harry suddenly had an idea.
Scratch stood with a huge growl.
“You won’t like what I’m about to suggest. But I think you’d better agree.”
But Harry wasn’t a brave man anymore, not when it came to this – he could and would throw himself head first into a fight without a second thought, but he couldn’t listen to his own heart.
And so it was less than ten minutes later that Harry stumbled into Ron’s office, pale and shivering. Ron opened his mouth, prepared to make a hangover joke, but he stopped short at the sight of Harry’s tearstained face. Ron swung the door shut and pulled out a chair, forcing Harry into it.
He didn’t feel brave enough to pick a beer, unsure if he even could name one, and so he left that to Malfoy.
He knew the spell, and he’d cast it before, but Malfoy’s body hadn’t featured in his dream. He needed to talk to someone. His mind flitted to the possibility of asking Dumbledore, but he faltered at the thought of using the stone, and so he checked the time; Hermione would be in a meeting, but he knew Ron would be working on his paperwork in his office.
“What’s that got to do with anything?” His voice was rough.
“We’re going to be late, Potter.”
Delighted, Harry pulled Malfoy in for a kiss.
As Harry stood at the edge of the town square, hidden by his cloak, watching Scratch linger outside of a small bakery, he prayed that Scratch would be able to play his part – that of a lonely, homeless werewolf, hiding from the magical world, unable to fit in with the muggle one. Scratch usually stood tall, stood proud, broad shoulders and furrowed eyebrows, but even as Harry watched, he shook himself apart, head drooping, wilting in on himself.
“Don’t you worry, we’re very understanding here; we get all sorts visiting.” Suzanne smiled at him and winked. Harry decided not to cause a fuss by contradicting her and instead asked about Cressida again.
“Yeah. I love Malfoy, and I want a family, but we’ve never talked about this. What if he doesn’t want kids?”
Both men were relieved, but Ron’s face was still grave.
“What about you, Harry, seeing anyone yet?”
Malfoy looked horrified.
It was a scathing review of a really rather nice bloke, but Harry felt particularly ruthless in that moment – Connor had moved from America several years before, and hadn’t been involved with the war that had so affected Harry. Harry knew he could never be involved with somebody that didn’t truly understand what he’d been through.
“Bloody hell, this case is getting more complicated by the day, isn’t it?”
“Nonsense, Harry, we’re always here to help. Besides, anything to do with werewolves is my job.”
Harry sat silently eating his breakfast for some time, thinking of Hermione and Ron – he’d been delighted when they’d gotten married, and he was just as delighted now that they were expecting. But he couldn’t help feeling down in some way – they were becoming parents, and he was still living the same life he’d been living for years. He wondered if he would spend the rest of his life as a single, lonely man who hunted bad people for a living. He hadn’t dated anyone seriously since he and Ginny had broken up five years ago – she’d wanted to start her career without any distractions or complications, and he had no longer been in love with her, so it had been an easy break up. And now he wondered if it had been a mistake to reject the various offers he’d had since then.
It hadn’t been long ago that Pansy and Blaise gotten sick of living alone in their family homes, haunted by the memories of the war, and they’d both sold their vast family estates, choosing instead to buy a large muggle manor together. It had been a brave move, but one that Harry respected them for – they’d shed the war like old skins, and they’d moved forward into a brighter future.
“Potter, I don’t know how you manage to do anything in this kitchen, it’s terribly crowded.”
“It’s not hurting you, is it, Malfoy? Then chill out.”
“No! You didn’t! You didn’t tell me about it for three years, Potter!
“You said you didn’t know anything about it.”
“I always write.” Harry grumbled as he produced a new piece of paper and waited for Malfoy to start talking. It was true that Harry could charm a quill to write as either one spoke, but Harry had to admit that he enjoyed this effort at teamwork.
Monday morning came and went with no sign of Susan Darling, and Harry and Malfoy grew worried. They ate lunch in their office, hoping she was just late, but with no luck. They’d received no message from the Auror stationed outside her home since the night before, and after checking the entry logs for the building they discovered Susan hadn’t come into work that morning.
“So are you, Harry.”
This was the flakiest part of his plan, and it had caused Harry a sleepless night – if they were wrong, the whole operation would be for nothing – Scratch would refuse to work with them again, and Herman Bellchant would remain at large.
“Potter.” He greeted warmly. “Nice to see you.”
Malfoy stood making pancakes in only a pair of trackies, and Harry felt his heart stop for a moment. Blushing, trying to get himself together before Malfoy noticed, Harry sat at the table.
“Yes, but not just that. Look at this bit – she says she thinks werewolves are being murdered.” Malfoy replied. “Actually, she calls them people with lycanthropy, which I think is a term she’s trying to get legalised, but that’s beside the point.”
Harry didn’t know what else to say, and so he waited with bated breath for Scratch to reply.
“Why what?” Harry snapped.
“We kissed, at the party, and then he left to give his speech. So after, I went to his flat.”
Harry, shocked at Malfoy’s tone and unpleasant words, stared at him for a second.
The drinks were made and the two brought them to the table in the corner, where Malfoy and Blaise were having an animated conversation about something in French. Malfoy looked flustered, and Blaise looked almost bored, although that wasn’t much of a change, Harry thought. Pansy scooted into the booth and quickly kissed Blaise before turning to Malfoy.
“That’s the wand he used in the final battle, isn’t it?”
“Really? You wouldn’t mind?”
“No, Malfoy. You can pretend you aren’t reformed if you have to in order to save your lives. Harry doesn’t have that option.” Hermione’s voice brooked no arguments, and Malfoy, having argued with her in the past, obviously reaslied he wasn’t going to win this one.
“This is all new to me, too.”
“Apparently she was so embarrassed she ran out before Luna could finish her tattoo!” Ginny grinned as she entered the room, still dressed in her Holyhead Harpies Chaser uniform. Ginny had spent two years as a reserve with the Wimbourne Wasps before a particularly successful game had garnered her a trial with the Holyhead Harpies. Only five years after leaving Hogwarts, Ginny Weasley was one of the Chasers with the Holyhead Harpies, and she was very popular with the fans.
“What’s the theme, do you know?”
“And you think I do?”
Harry quickly wrote out a note on some scrap paper and tossed it into the green fires of the Floo, knowing Hermione would come when she could.
Harry, finished, turned to return to the living room, but Ron caught his arm gently.
“I bet my father is turning in his cell.” Malfoy stood behind Harry, gently wrapped his arms around his waist, and rested his chin on Harry’s head. Harry had never thought Malfoy was any taller than him, but clearly, he was. It was an odd thought, that they were still learning things about each other so many years after their first meeting as children.
“Ron’s suit is the same colour.” Hermione said proudly, gently hanging the dress over a chair and returning the sofa, this time wriggling in between the two boys.
“You’re right, Potter, we should expect better from serial killers in the future.”
“No, she didn’t.” Malfoy sounded put out, and Harry wondered if he resented that his mother had this connection with Harry that she hadn’t shared with him, her own son.
Malfoy looked up, surprised, almost pleased. He agreed, much to Harry’s relief, and they finished packing up, walking together towards the fire.
Ginny produced a bottle of white wine and began pouring for everyone.
Ron was quiet, thinking. Then he leaped up and closed the shutters of his office window. Then he locked his door and turned to face Harry.
“I said I was sorry!” He rolled his eyes. “Was she awful?”
“OK. I get that.” Harry said, nodding. He did get it, but he couldn’t help wondering if that was all Malfoy had come to say.
“No. There will always be someone like Voldemort or Grindelwald, who want more and will do anything to get it. I have to stop them – I have to protect it.” Harry’s voice broke, and he turned away, embarrassed to cry in front of Malfoy.
“Sorry, Harry. The International Magical Flower and Fauna convention ended a day early and I had nowhere else to go till the weekend.”
“Yeah, I would probably have enjoyed it more if I hadn’t been involved with some sort of disaster every year.”
He rustled some more, and produced a large map of northern England.
“When’d you get so wise?” Harry teased, smiling again.
“Dickhead! There’s no emergency, we’ve got a case we think you’ll want to be involved with.” Harry patted the top of her head awkwardly as she panted, and she snorted slightly.
A small man with a pinched face swung open the door, and he glared suspiciously out at Harry and Malfoy, who both still wore their glamours. Malfoy quickly flashed his Auror badge at the man, and he grunted and walked into the house, giving no indication whether they should follow him or leave. Harry shrugged at Malfoy, and followed Jeremiah into the gloom.
Harry couldn’t help laughing at that, and soon both men were chuckling slightly, more relaxed.
“Really though, did you?”
They stared at each other, neither backing down – Harry refusing to speak about the Horcruxes, and Malfoy refusing to accept more secrets. After long minutes of a silent and tense standoff, Malfoy nodded, looking unhappy but resigned.
Ignoring them, he punched a third time and felt something crack inside his fist. He raised his fist to punch a fourth time. Hands grabbed his shoulders and span him around, pulling him into a rough embrace.
“Wait.”
“Quiet!” Harry snapped. “She’s been cursed with the Imperius recently, and more than once. And some kind of memory charm, too.”

Harry had noticed Malfoy and Hermione whispering during his speech, and passing something between the two of them, but before he’d been able to ask either of them about it, Ron had whisked him off to talk to his parents.
Harry prepared himself to answer, unsure of what exactly to tell her, when she wailed. Her silvery form collapsed in half, and Harry realised she’d dropped to the ground in a crouch. She’d remembered what had happened to her.
“Oh, of course. I anticipated this, actually, so I’ve written out a few things that you might need.” She handed over a large pile of parchment.
“Do you think it would be weird if I went to his flat? I want to talk to him.”
He’d missed out on his weekly Wine and Whiskey Wednesday with Ron and as many old Gryffindors as they could round up each week (he knew he’d receive a Howler from Ron about it sometime this morning) and by God did he regret it – he’d never have gotten that drunk with Ron and their friends around to prank him. Strange, he thought, that he trusted ex-Slytherins more than his old housemates not to mess with him when smashed.
“Thank Merlin, I wasn’t looking forward to writing it for a third time!” Harry relaxed into his chair and instantly regretted it, wincing away from a particularly sharp corner. He looked jealously again at Malfoy.
Harry stayed with the three ex-Slytherins for hours, drinking merrily as the sun dropped behind the city skyline and the bar filled with noisy muggles. The bar grew warm, and Malfoy rolled up his shirt sleeves, and Harry saw he hadn’t glamoured his Dark Mark, as he usually did in public. Harry understood – here in muggle London, nobody would spare a second thought for what looked like an edgy tattoo – there would be no shame in Malfoy baring his arms.
“Well, slandering me is nothing new, is it?” Harry replied bitterly, recalling every terrible thing the Daily Prophet had ever printed, remembering all the hate mail he’d received after the Triwizard Tournament.
Ron joined them on the sofa, holding out a full bottle of wine, much to Neville’s delight. Neville hiccupped and made a blind swing for it, and Ron chortled, telling him he’d never been able to hold his alcohol well. Harry switched his TV on, to the glee of both Ron and Neville, and they started to watch a game of football, each taking a swig when they didn’t understand the game. It wasn’t long before they were totally hammered – Ron curled on the floor hugging a pillow, Neville still wearing his cooking apron and Harry’s glasses somewhere in his lap, hair stuck up straight.
It wasn’t until Wednesday morning, two days later, that Hermione signed off on their excursion to find the Northumberland pack. She’d spent that time communicating with werewolf representatives and ensuring Harry and Malfoy would cause no harm or offence, and their time had been split between obsessively learning werewolf etiquette and learning new defensive spells. Hermione had quizzed them, much to their dismay, but had been satisfied they’d behave appropriately.
“Harry, I have something I need to say. Please just hear me out.”
“I don’t know, he seemed too…nice.”
The door swung open almost immediately, and Hermione gave both men large hugs. Ron lurked in the background serving something delicious-smelling.
“They always lie about me, Malfoy. I literally can’t go a week without reading some bullshit story about me.”
“What are you doing in our forest?” He snarled. Harry frantically thought back through everything he’d learnt, but Malfoy answered first, voice trembling ever so slightly.
“Yeah. She might be the one killing werewolves, but without even knowing it.”
“Hang on…are you…?”
“Oh yeah, I’ve met him. He’s a bit…well…” Harry didn’t know how to put it politely. Malfoy didn’t bother troubling himself with that.
“Alright, alright, give the man some space!” Dean appeared amid the paparazzi, gently pushing them away, towards more willing subjects (Ron and Hermione loved giving interviews at these events, and only partly because it saved Harry from having to do the same).
“Hermione’s convinced you’re just being difficult, but I actually think you don’t have a clue.” Ron said, watching Harry watching Malfoy. “I don’t think you know you’re in love with him.”
Malfoy nodded his head in agreement, too busy thinking to even make a dig about Ron, and watched as Harry flagged Ron and Hermione down – they’d been chatting with Neville and Luna, but had stopped to watch Harry and Malfoy fly across the room away from Susan.
“I guess we’ve worked out roughly where the pack is, then.” Harry said, looking down at the map. He then turned to the newspaper clippings Malfoy was flicking through.
“Without my death, the war wouldn’t have been won.” Harry paused. “There was a prophecy, the one your father tried to get at the end of fifth year, at the Ministry. ‘Either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives.’ It had to be me. I had to die so he would.”
After the war, Luna had invented magical tattoos, and had also pioneered a new style of therapeutic healing, which incidentally often used her tattoos. Harry himself had three of her tattoos, and he knew Luna had gifted Hermione and Ron matching ones that glowed when they were together for their wedding present. Luna’s non-therapeutic tattoos were famous around the world, and she always had an entertaining story about her work.
“Oops!” Pansy put her hand over her mouth jokingly, but she clearly wasn’t going to elaborate. It would be up to Harry to ask Malfoy.
“You mean all those times people called you an arrogant show-off, or a stuck-up wannabe superman, you just put up with it?”
“I don’t care about the bloody stone, Granger.” His voice was calm and quiet, but both Harry and Hermione could feel the anger underlying. Harry winced, and Hermione made a sympathetic face as she darted out the room to follow Ron, who was whistling, obliviously, down the hall.
“This isn’t a good sign.”
“I know. It’s just…I see her, too.”
Harry let himself into Malfoy’s flat several hours later – the door was unlocked, although Harry was sure there were spells in place to prevent intruders.
“And even more important – you must not get offended by anything they say. They haven’t had contact with wizards in several decades, and we don’t know how receptive they’ll be.” Although she’d swear otherwise, all three adults knew she was looking at Malfoy.
“God, I really don’t want to have to tell her this…but I don’t think we have a choice.”
“Let me fix it.” Malfoy said, softly, kneeling in front of Harry and taking his hand.
“I like to collect things.” Harry said, embarrassed. He looked around at all the cooking books and different spices in pots, all the random souvenirs that overflowed from his living room. “Sorry it’s a mess.”
“Yes! I’m pregnant!” Hermione cried out, reaching out to hold Ron’s hand. Everyone erupted into cheers, crowding round the couple for a group hug. Harry patted Ron on the back, who looked absolutely delighted, and kissed Hermione on the cheek. In the confusion Luna ended up patting Harry’s unruly hair, although she didn’t seem to notice. There was a lot of talking at once, until Hermione clapped her hands and everyone settled back down into their seats and continued eating.
“Are you OK?” He asked, sounding impatient, as though he was repeating himself.
“Why are you reading that crap, Malfoy?” Harry sat down beside him, only to see his own face splashed across the front of the page.
After the war, Harry had refused to use his wand in public ever again, and had gone to great lengths to ensure he was more than proficient in wandless magic. Although many people had hazarded guesses at why in the six years since the war (the Daily Prophet had called him an ‘arrogant show off’, which had sent Ginny into a blind rage), only Ron and Hermione knew the truth – Harry was terrified of being disarmed and relinquishing the Elder Wand to anyone who could be dangerous.
“Oh, no, sorry, Ron, you’ve got Durmstrang, Harry, you’ve got Ilvermorny and Malfoy has Beauxbatons.” Without waiting for them to reply, Hermione buried her head in the large pile of parchments and began rapidly flicking through them, making notes.
There was movement behind him – the curtains being pushed aside.
There was a few moments of grunting and sharp movement between Scratch and a few men surrounding him, and then Scratch nodded.
“What? Malfoy, of course you can.”
Malfoy’s face softened momentarily as Harry’s voice broke.
Harry smiled. She had quite a reputation for not only being an excellent flyer but also incredibly fiery on and off the pitch.
“Good god, Granger, your hair has a life of its own!” Malfoy snapped, waving her frizzy hair out of his face.
He and Malfoy hugged, awkwardly, and Harry waved at the bartender as he left the pub. There was a smile on his face as he headed into the darkness – the night had been tremendously enjoyable, and he was comfortably buzzed. He was glad he’d accepted Malfoy’s offer of a drink.
“Obviously, Potter. But I’ll have to teach you how to dance – I’m not being seen anywhere near your horrible dance moves.”
“So you didn’t explain why you were going wandless?”
Harry nodded.
“Yeah, sorry, I was asleep.” Harry sat down on their sofa (thankfully not the same one from all those years ago), reassured that he wasn’t interrupting anything.
“I want kids. I want to be a father.”
“Hello, Harry. Hello, Draco.” Luna smiled serenely at them from across the dinner table, where she appeared to be showing Hermione how to fold a napkin into a tiny dragon. Hermione looked surprised, but not displeased, to see Malfoy, and she gave Harry a strange, knowing look as Harry ushered him towards the table.
They’d had this jokey conversation many times throughout their years working together, and always the other person replied “You wish”, but this time, Malfoy just looked at Harry, eyes wide open. Harry, surprised, stared back. It occurred to him for the first time that he should probably be scared, or at least cautious, but he wasn’t. He was, at the most, nervous. He felt the burn of the Elder Wand in his pocket, and heard its whisper, and shuddered to realise it may be affecting him more than he thought.
“He was asleep, ‘Mione.” Ron mumbled through a mouthful of crisps, and Harry nodded.
Scratch glared at him, but remained standing still, apparently giving him permission to continue talking. Harry thought fast.
“No Hermans went to Durmstrang, although I did see our dear old Vicky’s file.”
“They look good.” He said, already turning away as Malfoy locked the door to his flat.
Malfoy’s face froze.
“Agreed. We should change our appearances – we don’t want to publicise to any wizards that we’re investigating.”
Reluctantly, Harry opened his eyes again, noticing that it was, again, past midday – he was getting into some bad habits, he thought, but he couldn’t bring himself to care when he realised where he was. He’d spent the night with Malfoy!
“I said I’ll fucking sort it, Ron!” He snapped.
Harry was just debating whether to get a third glass of champagne when a large gong sounded. Attention turned to Blaise, clad in a smart colourful suit.
“You didn’t think she might have just forgotten?” Even as he asked, he knew what she would say.
“Pansy sent me a letter with the theme for tomorrow.” She snagged the letter off the coffee table just as Ron, predictably, cried out.
He heard Malfoy gasp, and opened his eyes. Before them stood a silvery, shimmery figure of a woman.
Malfoy held out his arm for side-apparition, and they turned on the spot, arriving in a small, dark alley in Camden. Malfoy quickly directed Harry towards a fancy bar, but he hesitated.
The three of them were quickly joined by Ron and Hermione, and all five tried to work out the reason for the vague theme.
“Merlin, Potter, what’s all the pomp and circumstance about? You told me you had a lead, so get on with it!”
The two wizards were still sat quietly, perhaps three or four hours later, when Harry’s stomach rumbled loudly, and Malfoy sighed, putting down his quill.
“And the Resurrection Stone?” God, Malfoy was shrewd – he’d noticed Harry’s omission. Harry panicked, shrugging casually as if to say ‘no clue, not a clue about that one, no ideas here’. Malfoy bought it, or at least decided not to push someone who looked like they might be sick at any moment. It struck Harry as bizarre he was so worried about someone finding out he had the least useful of the three, but it was the only one that couldn’t be connected to him, and he wanted to keep it that way.
Time passed in a blur of paper cuts and ink stains, until finally Ron spoke up, looking unimpressed.
“And to think we once thought it would be you marrying her!” Ron joked, and Harry laughed out loud, amused by the memories of their relationship – it had been a pleasant and amicable break up when it had become clear to both members that neither was interested in the other’s gender. And on top of that, she’d wanted to start her career without any distractions or complications, and he had no longer been in love with her, so it had been an easy break up.
Harry interrupted her.
“There’s nothing cuter than a little ginger baby!” Ron crowed.
“She’s totally different tonight. I know people are different out of work, but this is ridiculous.” Harry gestured, small hand movements, to Susan, who was now trying to catch pieces of food in her mouth that her friends were throwing to her.
“Couldn’t sleep, I suppose. Wanted some fresh air.”
“Death gave it to the second brother to ensure his eventual demise. The stone lured him to his death, and countless since. Using it is highly dangerous - I believe it is partly to blame for Dumbledore going to his death so calmly – he wished to reunite with his sister.”
Molly looked like she was about to burst into tears, and so Harry and Ron stepped forward, carefully untangling Malfoy from her grips and leading her back to her seat at the front of the hall.
“I know the feeling.” Malfoy muttered under his breath before finally looking up at Harry.
“How the hell do a bunch of Slytherins drink harder than Gryffindors?” He grouched as he rolled over in bed and almost fell off, swearing under his breath as he righted himself.
“Um, no?”
Harry and Malfoy held hands as they walked through the park; they talked about nothing in particular, enjoying what was technically their first date.
“A few?” Harry asked incredulously, looking in horror at all the paperwork she’d compiled. “Did any of your subordinates know about Cressida’s presence in the country?”
Harry shook his head, not sure how to explain that he wanted someone witty and sarcastic and a little bit mean. Ron looked like he knew what Harry couldn’t say, and he didn’t like it. Harry turned away and caught sight of Malfoy on the other side of the room, laughing at something Pansy had said.
“What’s the case?” Harry asked eagerly, keen to take a break from the endless paperwork he had on his desk. Malfoy didn’t reply, instead reaching into a drawer and pulling out an old file, memo still clasped between his long fingers. Harry sighed impatiently and twitched the fingers of his right hand, which shot the memo across the room towards him, garnering him a frown from Malfoy.
That night had shown him the true danger of using the stone, and it had terrified all three of them. Hermione and Ron hated being near the stone – they were only here now to make sure neither Harry nor Malfoy got caught in its spell.
“That’ll be… seven fifty.”
“I can’t let you use it, though. It has to be me. I’m sorry.”
“Fine.” He snapped. “I’ll be a monster if need be. How should we contact them?”
And then he was at the glass doors, pushing his way through flimsy curtains, finding himself standing on a balcony in the brisk night air. He slapped both hands on the railing, leaning out into the open, breathing deeply. His heart was racing – he vaguely wondered if he was going to faint.
“I love you, Harry. I know we haven’t been dating for very long, but we’ve been a big part of each other’s lives for such a long time, and I can’t imagine my life without you anymore.” Malfoy babbled. “You mean so much to me, and you’ve made me a better man.”
“Blaise, darling, show Draco to the table while I get another round.” Pansy pushed Draco gently into Blaise’s direction, and firmly took Harry’s arm as she led him to the bar. She ordered four gin and tonics, and then turned to Harry with a wide smile on her face.
“Well, I suppose I can manage that. That’s the only photo you’re getting for free, though!” Malfoy teased, and Harry smiled back, pleased – Ron and Hermione would love the photo, and this way Malfoy got to keep whatever photos had so inspired him.
“They’re not reunions! Well, not really – it’s every week, same pub, and anyone who is free comes along.”
Harry went back to his flat, agreeing to meet Malfoy at work at 9am the next morning.
“Wait!” Malfoy reached out, whip-fast, and grabbed Harry’s wrist. “I’m not sorry. I thought you would be.”
Malfoy quickly returned with two pints of beer and looked in mock horror at the notes Harry was laying out.
After all, wasn’t he a cold-blooded murderer? Hadn’t he systematically hunted down and murdered pieces of Tom Riddle’s soul? The man had been a monster, and he’d been barely human by the time Harry had faced him down in the wreckage of their first true home, but that didn’t change what Harry had done. The fact that he’d only destroyed the diary himself didn’t matter – he’d encouraged Ron to stab the Locket and Hermione the Cup, he’d told Neville to kill Nagini – he was the moving force behind those acts.
“I think we need to tell Granger.”
Seamus announced that the painter had requested to remain anonymous, which Harry could understand – it was a slightly controversial thing to paint. But Harry couldn’t help but notice Seamus wink at Malfoy as the next item was being brought out, and Malfoy flushed slightly, seemingly nodding his thanks back at Seamus.
It’s bloody inconvenient, he thought, that the one person I actually have romantic feelings for is the most fucking annoying man in the world.
They stared at each other for a long moment, silent and still in the silver shine of the moon, and then finally Malfoy moved. More graceful than Harry had been by far, he leaned forward, carefully pressing his cool lips against Harry’s warm ones.
“Well, Mrs Granger-Weasley, I’d like to ask you a few questions.” Harry answered in an overly formal voice, knowing she’d laugh, which she did, amused.
Hermione’s frown faded as Roseanne opened her present – a toy broom. Ron cheered from across the room, where he was chatting to Ginny and holding his son, Harry Frederick. Ron’s cheer, however, had nothing on Roseanne’s scream of joy as she immediately jumped on it.
“We’re here because we heard about a series of murders in the area.”
“Will you be bringing your wand, Potter? Do you even have a wand anymore?”
“Shit, Malfoy, I’ve got to go or I’ll be late to dinner at Ron and Hermione’s.” He paused, and asked, as always, “Want to join?”
“Hey, why don’t we get Ron round here? It’s been ages since our last bloke’s night!”
“Hermione!” Harry said, embarrassed that she’d dived straight in, not bothering with small talk. Ron was snickering behind his forkful of food.
“Yes. Fenrir Greyback.” Malfoy said the name with equal parts disgust and fear, looking as though he may vomit. “It was torture. He was allowed to do whatever he wanted, except kill us. I got off easy – I’d taken the Mark, and even Greyback was afraid of the Mark. But Pansy…” Malfoy’s voice broke. “He did worse to Pansy.”
“If everyone could stand in two groups and face me…” He said, and everybody obeyed, each privately thinking, where is this going? Pansy and Blaise’s parties were infamous for their crazy invented games.
When Harry woke, he was still dressed in his clothes from yesterday, surrounded by piles of newspapers and red string. He didn’t have the energy to tidy up or shower, and certainly not to cook, and so he sat on his sofa, mindlessly watching a cooking show on his TV.
“He’s staying here, Granger.”
“It’s OK, Susan. You can trust us.”
“And I don’t! Why are you reading this, anyway? They’ve never printed anything factually correct, ever.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What if it’s inevitable, and I’m just holding out pointlessly?”
He made himself breakfast (eggs and bacon) for the first time in what felt like ages, musing on what to do with his afternoon. Savage had, unwillingly, given him and Malfoy the rest of the week off, meaning he had a four day weekend instead of two. Savage rarely gave permission days off, even for Harry Potter, the Chosen One – only Shacklebolt’s insistence had persuaded her.
“I did not!” Malfoy retorted, settling into the chair Ron gestured to, the other three following suit.
There he is! Harry thought to himself, relieved to finally have spotted the elusive Malfoy again. He couldn’t help but smile as Malfoy laughed so much he spat out his mouthful of champagne. Malfoy rarely fully relaxed, and it was nice to see him looking so happy.
“You’re awfully jolly for someone who threw up after one too many pints last night!”
“Well, a young French witch asked for a tattoo of Ginny blowing her a kiss on her shoulder. I didn’t mind, of course, so I agreed. She didn’t seem to realise anything until I was half-way done and she saw a photo of us kissing on my wall!”
Harry swore as he launched forward to catch Malfoy’s prone body and lay it gently on the old sofa in the corner of the room. Then, as he waited for Malfoy to wake up, he carefully withdrew a copy of his memories of the meeting and stored the silvery shimmer in a small vial. He wrote and attached a note to it and rolled it through the green flames to Hermione’s office. And then he sat, cross-legged at the base of the sofa, quietly waiting.
“Oh, all that crap again, is it?” He grumbled, adjusting himself in his chair. “Why can’t you lot just leave me alone? I’ve not done anything to harm no-one, so can’t you lot just bugger off?”
“Aha! A bakery, perfect.” Harry led Malfoy into a small shop smelling strongly of fresh bread and sweet jam, where they were cheerily greeted by a large blonde woman smiling brightly from behind the counter.
“Ha. They got that wrong, then. I was at yours, not with some random hook-up.” Harry was triumphant, glad to have proved the Prophet wrong, even though he was long past the stage where he’d write in to complain.
“Oh, isn’t it beautiful!” Hermione gasped, and even Ron, who’d once told Harry he didn’t understand why people bothered with how things looked, looked impressed.
Harry and Malfoy made eye contact, just for a moment, and Harry realised he didn’t have to finish his sentence – both men knew exactly which spell he meant. Malfoy wasn’t going to make him say it, and Harry was grateful. Whoever had cast this spell had meant it to be a slow and painful death, and they both knew it.
Harry looked up, towards the end of the room, where Malfoy stood, and felt something unfamiliar and scary tighten his heart to see Malfoy looking back at him.
Harry didn’t really know what to say. He wasn’t as eloquent as Malfoy, and he didn’t know how to say what he felt. He wasn’t angry anymore, obviously, but he felt dangerously close to saying something he would regret.
Hermione actually did throw up after they all watched their memories of the scene, and Harry couldn’t blame her.
“I only found the one memory of casting the Sectumsempra, and that was of Malfoy. The dream was, as far as I can tell, just a dream.”
“It’s the most powerful wand ever created. It could make a bad wizard far, far worse, and it could make even a good person bad. If I don’t use it, no-one can.”
“You lied to me. Again.” Malfoy’s voice was sharp and cold, and very intentionally flat.
“Oh. Potter.” Malfoy looked miserable, for some reason, as though it wasn’t the question he’d been expecting, or hoping for. “I’m sorry about that.”
“Did she say what she’s researching? We’re all pretty keen to find out before we get the shock of a lifetime.” Harry tried up to play the role of friendly younger cousin who was keen to stop his older cousin getting into trouble, but he was distracted by the arrival of Malfoy. Malfoy looked rugged and tired, unlike his usual poised self, and Harry supposed it was because of his uncomfortable sleeping arrangements the night before.
“Tortures her and then kills her.” Harry corrected. “Perhaps he wanted to know what she told us. And then he killed her to shut her up. Or perhaps she just outlived her usefulness.”
“Hello, Harry!” Hermione, surprised to see him, made no motion to stand up, instead just waving vaguely at the chair opposite her desk as she finished signing some document. “What can I do for you, Harry?”
“Why did you do that?” He asked, one singular eyebrow raised coolly.
Malfoy hesitated, and for a moment Harry thought he’d offended him. He winced as Malfoy disappeared through one of the doorways out of the main room.
“Don’t you talk about Dolly to me! Locking her up in that loony bin! It’s a crime against humanity, it is!” He leapt up, hands curling into fists.
“I didn’t know you owned jeans.”
“I don’t know.” It was true – despite owning all three, by blood, by law and by war, Harry didn’t know what it meant for him. “They become the Master of Death, I guess. That’s what the story says, anyway.”
Malfoy said nothing, and Harry, too, was silent as they hugged, until Ron reluctantly cleared his voice.
Before Harry could process his words, he vanished out the door and down the hallway, leaving Harry to sit on his own, still clutching the whispering stone in his tightly clenched fists. Although the whispering had never been louder, Harry couldn’t hear it, instead hearing over and over Malfoy calling him Harry.
“Yes... how did you know?”
It felt strange to be sitting with Malfoy chatting about boys, but it was a natural part of any friendship, he supposed.
“What?” Malfoy, horrified, spoke too loud.
Ginny darted back into the kitchen, followed by Luna; Hermione, who was universally recognized as terrible at cooking, stayed where she was.
The sun was shining, although it wasn’t very warm, and the leaves on the trees were just starting to redden.
And so Harry and Malfoy found themselves standing, side by side, in front of the small mirror in Cressida’s bathroom. Harry, distracted, watched as Malfoy pointed his wand at his silvery hair, which was usually slicked back sleekly, and was now falling softly around his face. The tip of Malfoy’s wand spread a dark brown flowing through his hair, like an oil spill. At the same time, Malfoy’s grey eyes darkened, and his high cheekbones faded away beneath rosy cheeks. Harry stared – in all their time working together, he’d never seen Malfoy in disguise – usually there was no need, instead using Disillusionment Charms, or, in Harry’s case, his Cloak.
“Nor have I, Potter. Are you going to eat that pancake?”
“I read the Daily Prophet because it’s the closest I’ll ever get to my father again.”
Harry got up and walked towards Malfoy, who held out Harry Two (as he was sometimes affectionately known) towards him.
“And me.” Malfoy added. “Why don’t you date, then?”
“Sorry I almost ruined your party.” Harry said sheepishly to Pansy, who laughed.
Having settled that, Hermione changed the topic.
He hoped Malfoy wasn’t expecting sex. Harry had never slept with a man before, although of course he’d thought about it (a lot), and the thought of doing it tonight made him nervous.  Besides, he really was tired, and he thought that would probably have an effect.
“Malfoy said to say hi.” Harry said to Hermione, relaxing into the comfortable sofa, looking pensive. Hermione didn’t reply, waiting for him to say whatever it was she knew he was thinking about.
“I’m not going without having a shower.” Harry stripped off his t-shirt and boxers and stepped into the shower defiantly.
Harry left soon after – Ron and Hermione were visiting the Burrow, and he needed to shower, change and return to Malfoy’s.
Malfoy seemed to know what he was thinking.
“Yeah, my first Hogwarts letter had ‘Cupboard under the stairs’ as my address.”
Harry didn’t know what to say – he’d always known Lucius Malfoy was a bastard, of course, but he hadn’t realised how awful he’d been even to his own family. He didn’t know if he’d be allowed to call Malfoy’s father a bad name, though, or if that would be a step too far. Instead he decided to share something personal about himself, so Malfoy didn’t regret telling him.
Malfoy’s suggestion was a good one, and they all knew it was their best bet, so with Hermione’s permission he and Harry started to create a plan to take to the werewolves that afternoon.
“Alright, mate?” Ron greeted him as Harry appeared in their living room, turning around as Hermione fussed over his navy robes. Hermione’s robes, a pale lilac, complemented perfectly, and Harry smiled.
“I always keep a spare set of clothes here, Potter. I like to be prepared for anything.” Malfoy replied primly. “And besides, the techs will probably need help setting up the potions and charms, and I’m best qualified for that.”
“I’m so glad Luna and Ginny wanted me in their wedding.”
“Not the Killing Curse, then.” Harry brushed his fingers through the air above the blood soaked ground and stiffened in confusion. “It’s the Sectumsempra. The one I used…”
“I think I’m going to go home now, if that’s alright. I’m rather tired.” She finally said, standing up, smoothing down her clothes, rearranging her hair, wiping away dried tears.
“It doesn’t say. I guess we should go check out where she was staying, then.” Malfoy looked forlornly at his half-finished mug of coffee, and then stood, slinging on his cloak and sliding his wand into his sleeve. He tapped his feet impatiently as he waited for Harry to do the same, who quickly sent a memo to Savage about their field trip before joining Malfoy at the door.
“Like wife, like husband, I suppose it shouldn’t be a surprise.” Malfoy said, but he was half-smiling as he bent over the book. Harry curled his head in beside him and flushed as he could feel the warmth of Malfoy’s breath against his cheek – it felt strangely intimate and almost uncomfortable, although Harry couldn’t work out why.
Malfoy thought for a moment.
“Is that really relevant right now?” Harry snapped back, mostly joking, but he was surprised, and for some reason pleased, to realise Malfoy had been paying attention to him back then.
“What?”
Harry stepped outside Malfoy’s flat and apparated, doubting that Malfoy would have a direct Floo link to Ron and Hermione’s flat.
Harry continued, heart in his throat, ringing in his ears. He could already feel the compulsion to call up his parents, Sirius and Remus. He shook his head like a dog shaking off water, but the feeling didn’t lessen.
“Let’s visit them together. I’m not very keen to meet Umbridge’s brother alone.” Harry admitted, and Malfoy nodded gratefully, clearly feeling the same. Harry wondered what these people would do when they came face to face with Harry, who had been a staunch, vocal supporter of Hermione’s work since day one.
“No-one knows. Well, Ron and Hermione, obviously, but no-one else knows. People probably think I was mad, talking about a children’s story to a murderous megalomaniac. No-one ever asked, and I never told.”
Somewhere in the back of his mind Harry was hearing a commotion just inside – raised voices, perhaps – but it seemed so disconnected from the electric elation he was feeling that he ignored it, forgot it immediately.
“What do you need?”
“Some American witch has been missing for three days now – Missing Persons sent over her file to us because she’s high profile and she worked with Dark objects sometimes. Want us to take a look.” Malfoy finally answered Harry even as he read the memo for himself.
“He made me kill all those people! And then he made me forget!”
“You can’t just use it whenever you want. It infects you. It…I dream of it at night, I think about it all day.” Harry clenched his fists together and rubbed his eyes. “You’ve heard the story, Malfoy. It wasn’t a gift, it was a curse!” Harry turned to Hermione, imploring her to step in.
“Harry, those bits aren’t bad. They might be messy, but they’re not bad - everything you did, and still do, is for the good of other people. Don’t you want him to know that?”
Malfoy made to stand up, but Harry held out his hand.
“Fine, Potter.” Perhaps because Malfoy’s parents lived in Azkaban and France respectively, and because the friends he’d lost in the war were long dead, Malfoy seemed sincere. He had no interest in using the stone himself - he was watching Harry now, not the stone. His eyes were still cold.
Malfoy stood in the middle of Harry’s living room and turned to face him.
“There are fifteen clippings here. Ten of them are about murders, three are about muggings with serious injuries and these last two are…hmm. They’re about animal attacks, which I guess is relevant to the werewolf pack’s activites, rather than the crimes committed against them.” Malfoy was very matter of fact – it was one of his strongest talents in this job, Harry thought, comparing it to his own habit to connect emotionally to anything possible. It was part of the reason they worked so well together.
He couldn’t stop staring at Malfoy, standing across the room, talking and gesturing energetically, totally unaware of the chaos going on inside Harry’s head.
Reaching the front, Pansy took Blaise’s hand and addressed their flabbergasted friends.
“Well, no. We didn’t know about it, but Cressida Boone did, and she’s gone missing.”
An hour and a lot of disgust later and the four knew everything there was to know about Herman Bellchant.
“He’s a bloody psychopath, whoever the hell he is.” Ron spat as he carefully tied Hermione’s hair out of her face as she retched, his words and facial expression at odds with the gentleness of his actions. His ease at handling her mane of hair as she vomited spoke volumes of how the first months of her pregnancy were treating her.
“How many times have you been here, then?”
He was always better at this than Harry – he knew the right words to say, the right tone of voice to use. Harry was relentless (Malfoy had once called him a bloodhound) – he’d do anything to find the truth, to stop the bad guys – emotions, his or anyone else’s, rarely came into it. This difference in character was partly why they worked so well together.
“She’s sent a list of names and addresses for four vocal werewolf haters. Oh, look at that – Jeremiah Umbridge. Her brother, apparently.” Hermione had written several unpleasant words about Umbridge and her brother, but Harry didn’t relay them to Malfoy, remembering fifth year. Malfoy’s face looked pinched and uncomfortable, and it was such a Malfoy-esque facial expression that Harry could suddenly see through the stranger to Malfoy’s true face.
“Everyone decent?” He called as he stepped through the green fire, keen not to repeat a mistake he’d made early on after Ron and Hermione had moved in together – he’d burst into the flat only to find them in varying stages of nakedness on their sofa. They had all screamed, and he hadn’t been able to look Hermione in the eye for several days afterwards.
Moments later she returned clutching a beautiful, long dark blue dress.
Before Harry could say anything as they sat down, Malfoy burst out.
The kiss lasted nothing longer than a second before Harry pulled himself back, mortified.
“You should probably go let them know you’re alright, shouldn’t you?”
“Have you told anyone else?”
“You know what this means, don’t you?”
Harry saw Malfoy’s face light up as Dean flicked through the photos, and smiled to himself – the game was on; this was the piece he and Malfoy would playfully fight over.
“I’m just repeating what the papers say, Potter. And they say you’re full of shit.”
Hearing the words come out of his mouth, he darted out of the door, grimacing and repeating the words to himself in a silly voice.
“I don’t let anyone in. All my friends are people I met when I was eleven, when everything was new and shiny and exciting. I’m terrified to let anyone in in case they’ll see how broken I am.”
Harry returned to the table and his notes, only to notice that the light in the room had faded away as the sun slipped beneath the ocean. Harry suddenly swore, casting a tempus charm.
Harry reluctantly nodded. He didn’t want to think about the case, but he didn’t know how else to talk to Malfoy. He thought for a moment, watching as Malfoy quickly and efficiently packed all the notes into a small pile at the end of the table. He watched Malfoy cast a quiet notice-me-not charm on the papers – if a muggle got their hands on the notes, it would be a huge clean up job for the Obliviator Squad.
The rest of the evening was joyful as they celebrated well into the night.
“Do you kiss all of your friends and then run away?” Harry snapped, annoyed that he was having to explain himself.
“There was a moment today, in the field, where we heard a noise.” He paused. “I think he’s going to ask me about why I use wandless magic.” Hermione nodded in understanding.
Neville and Calliope were also on the dancefloor, trying to imitate Dean and Seamus’s bizarre chicken dance. Everyone in the vicinity could hardly control their laughter at the sight of four adults clucking like chicken.
Malfoy looked at him with wide, grey eyes, his pale lips tightly pressed together.
“Boys, you’re late! I thought you might not be coming.”
“Draco, are you – oh!” Pansy’s voice broke off with a high-pitched gasp, and both men pushed each other away, breathing hard, avoiding eye contact. Harry was staring, stone-still shocked, at Pansy. Malfoy had turned away, leaning over the railings, face invisible in the dark.
“Have you ever been to a place like this before, Malfoy? This is what they’ll be wearing, not Armani or whatever other fancy shit you wear.”
The crowd fell back into a low rumble of noise as soon as Pansy and Blaise, now husband and wife, started to make the rounds, greeting all their friends individually. Some looked terribly upset not to have gotten them a wedding gift; Hermione was included in this group, of course, although Ron did his best to persuade her they wouldn’t mind.
“Well, I’m glad you’re alright, anyway.” Hermione perched herself on Ron’s lap, facing Harry. Had anyone else displayed the same level of affection publicly, he might have been uncomfortable, but she was just as likely to have sat on his lap if Ron’s had been unavailable – it was just the way the three of them were, had been since the end of the war.
There was a strange thumping sound in the next room and both men jumped up – Malfoy whipped his wand out of his sleeve holster and looked on curiously as Harry, panicked, double checked that his wand was still stuffed in his pocket under his robes. Both wizards approached the door and Harry stepped back as Malfoy carefully eased it open. Malfoy let out a loud laugh and Harry stuck his head into the room, coming face to face with an elderly grey cat that had clearly just knocked over a large stack of books.
“Don’t be absurd. It’s for work.”
Malfoy finished their weekly ritual by replying, as he always did, “Not tonight, Potter, but thanks.”
“This seems very complicated. We never had to do any of this with Lupin.” Harry complained.
It was crossing the line, Harry knew, but he couldn’t help himself – Malfoy still read this shitty paper that his shitty father had read so many years ago? What the hell was wrong with him?
“His name is Herman. I met him a few years ago.” Susan continued to explain, in great detail, everything she knew about him.
“Please, be careful.” She added just as they turned on the spot and vanished, leaving her alone in the silence of the cottage.
“Oh, thanks; it’s coming along slowly. You know what Luna’s like – so full of ideas, not so great at the planning.”
“Is that what goes on at your reunions?”
Harry looked at Malfoy, surprised, as Susan nodded and left the room, saying a quiet goodbye to Hermione and Ron.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and waved his wand discretely, and Harry’s baggy jeans and large t-shirt transformed into black slacks and a white button down shirt, similar to Malfoy’s own clothes. Muttering a quick word of thanks, Harry followed Malfoy across the road and into the bar, where they were greeted by a loud squeal of joy.
“Harry, mate, you’re bleeding!” Ron reached out again, and this time Harry pushed him away.
“If you guys ever want any advice or anything…” Ron offered. “Hermione’s got a few folders with all our wedding information in it.”
The event was never pleasant for Harry – he struggled with the guilt and shame of causing the war, and he was reminded that Malfoy felt similarly about his part in it as he watched Malfoy flinch slightly.
“But I want to let you in, Draco.” Malfoy had been looking at his hands, but at that he glanced up, eyes wide. Harry continued. “I’m sorry, too. What I said about your father was cruel, and what you said to me was cruel. But I want to move past that.”
“Yeah, but he’s boring. He makes too much noise and doesn’t say anything important.”
“To the best of friendships.” Hermione spoke softly, smiling at both Ron and Harry, who both grinned back.
“Aye, we did. Very nice lady she is.” A lanky, dark haired man popped his head out from the kitchen to chime in.
“I’m sure you will.” He replied sarcastically, before adding. “Well, I look forward to seeing you there.”
Malfoy stiffened, and Harry stepped closer towards him. The man turned his dark eyes towards Harry.
An hour later found Harry and Malfoy watching men and women dressed in white taking away Susan’s body while others collected samples from the scene.
“No. But since you are, I’ll see you at work.” Embarrassed that he’d come to see Malfoy for no reason, Harry turned away.
“So are you two an item now?”
Ron finished serving up, jokingly telling everyone “Don’t worry, this is all me, Hermione just watched!” Everyone laughed as Hermione, blushing and smiling, slapped his arm gently.
“Only two of the murders seemed to match our MO – one in Edinburgh two years ago, which was coded as a mugging gone bad, and one in London last year, which was coded as an unsolved murder.” Malfoy held out his small black notebook. “I made notes, if you want to copy them.”
Malfoy laughed out loud at that.
Malfoy didn’t sound upset, he seemed amused.
“What on earth does celebrations mean?”
Harry paused at the fireplace, looking back into the rapidly darkening room at Malfoy, sat alone at the table, and flicked his fingers, lighting the lamps in the corners of the room. Not waiting to see how Malfoy reacted, he stepped through the green fire.
“Have you heard of Cressida Boone?” Harry asked. It was a risky question, and Malfoy’s glare showed he thought so too, but he didn’t say anything, perhaps still shaken by the guide’s keen attention to his Dark Mark. His face was paler than usual, and he was breathing deeply – Harry could see his chest moving from where he sat.
“Oh yeah, what happened?” Harry looked forward to every story she told.
“No point in keeping it a secret now, is there? I’ve fancied you for ages.”
Before Harry had a chance to even think of what to say, Malfoy spoke.
Harry probably deserved it (he hadn’t been especially kind to the recently deceased Susan) but he was fairly sure he didn’t deserve the sharp kick under the table that accompanied it.
In each corner of the ballroom was a huddle of gold and silver balloons, streaming a shower of tiny stars that didn’t seem to puddle on the floor – an impressive piece of spell work. Streamers hung from the high arched ceiling, coloured silver and pale pink, shimmering gently. Huge bouquets of white and pink flowers were dotted around the room, and Harry could smell their sweet fragrance.
“Can you tell us anything about these dates? Perhaps you noticed something or somebody strange around the Ministry?” Malfoy pushed a slip of parchment across the table to Susan, and Harry caught a glimpse of the paper as Susan picked it up – it was a list of the dates of the werewolf murders.
The four ate at a leisurely pace, discussing everything from Hermione’s pregnancy to Ginny and Luna’s wedding. Harry had been right – Ron and Hermione did like Malfoy, and in fact liked him even more now that he and Harry were an item.
Harry sat alone in his flat all Saturday evening, too numb to cry. Or perhaps he was too angry to cry, he couldn’t tell.
“I like that he doesn’t know about all that mess. You and Ron are the only people who know really about the Deathly Hallows and the Horcruxes. I don’t know if I’m ready for anyone else to know. I like that he knows the good bits of me, and not the bad.”
“That’s very unwise. Their alpha is a nasty piece of work. But you wouldn’t ask if you had any other options, I’m sure, so I’ll tell you if you promise to be careful.”
“Ron always cooks more than enough, you hungry?” He couldn’t explain it, but he really wanted Malfoy to say yes. He’d been polite enough to ask Harry yesterday, after all – of course Harry had to do the same tonight.
“It’ll take a while to get the ingredients ready for the spell, so I suggest you three go home, collect a change of clothes, maybe get some sleep.”
Both Ginny and Luna had wanted to walk down the aisle, and so they’d come to a typical Ginny-Luna compromise – both women would walk down the aisle to meet Ron and Harry. Hermione would accompany Ginny down one aisle, and Malfoy would lead Luna down a parallel aisle.
“No, we’re not. I wrote to Savage and told her we’d be taking the day to meet with the Northumberland pack for a mission debrief. She wasn’t best pleased but I highly doubt she’ll take the time to check.”
“He’s an arrogant twat, but he’s good enough in bed. Couldn’t stand talking to him, though, so obviously it didn’t work out.”
“So, we’ve worked out what Cressida was doing here – researching the murders of supposed werewolves.”
“Harry, mate…I’m glad you brought Malfoy tonight. He’s a good guy.”
“I’ve met Draco several times in the past, and I was introduced to Hermione Granger just a few minutes ago.”
“You reek of death, boy. What business do you have with our leader?”
Ron nodded, satisfied, but Hermione looked as though she was realising something crucial.
Burning inside, Harry placed his hands on Malfoy’s face, heart aching. Malfoy’s hands found their way to Harry’s mess of hair, twisting the dark strands between his pale, thin fingers.
“This is my favourite time of year.” Malfoy said, smiling as he ran his fingers across a tree trunk.
“I’m not sure. I can do some research but I don’t think Lupin ever wrote about that…”
Harry’s fist twitched, like he wanted to hit him, but he refrained, possibly because he was also debating throwing himself forward to kiss him.
The two men didn’t say anything to each other, instead communicating through a series of grunts and movements. Their guide loped off and the new man knelt on the floor, gesturing for Harry and Malfoy to do the same. They followed his actions immediately, waiting for him to speak first, as custom dictated. The tone of this meeting would be set by his first speech.
Malfoy had sounded perhaps a little upset, but Harry was angry now – it was one thing to read the newspaper that had it out for Harry, but to read it and believe it? Unacceptable, and incredibly hurtful.
“What was that about?”
“Bloody hell, Neville, I thought you were coming tomorrow? You scared the shit out of me!” Harry cried, feeling embarrassed and relieved as the red glare around his fists quickly faded. Neville, taller and broader than Harry now, blushed wine-red, seemingly unaware of how lethal Harry’s curse would have been, or even that he’d been about to cast one at all.
Malfoy didn’t reply, just stared at Harry with wide, grey eyes. Harry gestured with his hands as if to say ‘well, get on with it!’, and Malfoy nodded. Hesitantly, he rolled up the sleeve of his left arm, the one with the Dark Mark. Harry flinched as he saw the blackness, and then froze as he saw what was above it – a silvery, human bite mark scarred into the skin just below Malfoy’s elbow.
“Of course I have, Potter, what do you take me for?” For a moment Malfoy looked as though he was going to say something else, but instead he pulled open the door to The King’s Head and ushered Harry into the warmth.
“Out of their minds, probably.”
“What is it, Malfoy?”
“We know who’s been killing your people. He’s killed a few of ours, too. We have a plan to catch him, but we need your help.”
Harry was rapidly trying to work out the correlation between wolves and murders when Malfoy spoke up.
He knocked hesitantly, clutching the notebook and case notes he’d forgotten and had to double back and collect. The door swung open almost immediately, as if Malfoy had been standing behind it, just waiting. Perhaps he was feeling nervous too, Harry mused, feeling a strange shock jolt through him at the sight of Malfoy.
“And both bedside tables are used.” Malfoy slicked his finger across the left table, showing Harry the lack of dust. He pulled open the drawers and gingerly held up a pack of condoms, eyebrow raised as he met Harry’s gaze. Harry felt himself flushing inexplicably as he poked around. There was surely something inappropriate in the way Malfoy had held out the condoms to him, suggestively, Harry felt, but he couldn’t bring himself to vocalise that thought.
“Yeah, thanks for that, you two. You look great, by the way.”
“Are you serious?” He asked, feeling full of emotion.
“Right, read out the dates and places of each murder or other crime mentioned, and I’ll write it on here.”
Hermione looked pleased that Ron had remembered the folders (although he had rather undersold them, Harry thought – there were at least ten) and nodded along with him.
They chatted about Pansy, and by association Blaise, for some time, before moving on to Hermione and Ron and their pregnancy, and then Ginny and Luna and their wedding planning.
“So, you’re finally dating, then.”
Harry tried to answer, but Malfoy interrupted him again.
Sat alone in his flat, Harry wondered: Where was his own great happiness? Where were his rewards for his efforts and sacrifices during the war?
“Yeah, that’s me.” Harry paused. He didn’t want to seem rude, but he really didn’t want to make any new friends right now. Even tall, attractive men didn’t hold much of an interest for some reason.
Malfoy stared at him.
Shuddering, he leapt away from the darkening thread and soldiered on, finding himself watching as Voldemort pointed his wand at Harry and…Harry fell, everything going black. Ron panicked, threw himself out, found himself watching Malfoy’s pale face crying in a bathroom mirror. Curiosity getting the better of him, Ron followed this thread, flicking through countless memories of Malfoy frowning, smirking, casting spells, ending at a memory of Harry and Malfoy watching each other as people crowded around Luna and Ginny. Last night, Ron realised, and finally withdrew from Harry’s mind.
“I’m not surprised – doesn’t seem a fancy enough name for them, does it?”
Ahh. That made sense. Pansy was matchmaking, again. Every year she sent over a friend or colleague to chat him up, and every year she was unsuccessful.
Hermione made a small sound of impatience and patted Ron’s leg.
“That’s because Snape created it when he was at Hogwarts. I found it written in my sixth-year Potions textbook.”
“Do you want it to be a date?” Her gaze, somehow, got sharper, and Harry wriggled uncomfortably under the microscope of her stare.
“Well, either way our clothes will fit in well.” Hermione replied, already getting up to go and get it, keen to show Harry, or perhaps just keen not to exclude him on account of their relationship.
“Pansy…You and everyone know I’m not normally one for showing my heart on my sleeve, but I think we can both agree this is a special occasion.” He paused, and Harry was amazed to see that he, usually so cool and calm, was collecting his thoughts. “We have survived more than I ever thought we could, but you didn’t just survive – you thrived. You shine like no-one else, Pans, and I’m going to show you every day how much I love you.”
“Cheers, lads, Hermione’s working late again tonight and I was getting pretty bored at home!”
“Uh, no, that’s fine. Um, who are you?”
“I don’t know why Pansy is so keen to set me up!” Harry groaned, downing his drink in one large gulp.
Malfoy stepped impossibly closer, pushing Harry further against the railings, and it was Harry’s turn to make a strange, strangled sound.
“Pansy suggested I come over and introduce myself to you, I hope you do not mind?”
“What the hell happened in there, Potter?” Immediate emergency sorted, Malfoy stepped back, sat in the other chair, several feet away.
Harry twisted in his arms, kissed him on the lips, revelling that he could. He still couldn’t believe he’d gone from having no idea he wanted to kiss Malfoy, to always wanting to in such a short space of time.
“We should have somebody outside her home, too, so we know where she is.”
“You all know the theme is celebrations, but what are we celebrating? Well, I don’t want to ruin the surprise, but…today is a good day.”
“There’s no third body, so we can assume he wasn’t killed. We were the first to find this crime scene, so we know it hasn’t been reported by anybody. And it’s, what, seven, seven-thirty? Work day is long finished, but no-one’s interrupted us. The contents of the drawers and wardrobe suggest he lives here. So where is he?”
Harry nodded, no longer surprised, now cautious. He wondered how much to tell Malfoy – his knowledge on the subject was more considerable than he had realised – he could piece together the details if Harry wasn’t careful. And he had to be careful – every single day, every single night.
“Oh, sorry, I was not sure if I should disturb you. You looked very deep in thought.”
“It’s work! We’re writing the report, aren’t we?”
He wanted to run back to Malfoy’s flat and punch him in his stupid, smug face; he wanted to apparate to the Daily Prophet offices and cause a huge fucking scene about their awful article; he wanted to find his friends and cry into their shoulders.
Harry did as he was told, unoffended by Malfoy’s sarcasm – it was part of the reason Harry liked him, after all. The sarcasm had made Harry’s questions more light-hearted – an honest but easy conversation.
There was no answer. Harry banged his fist on the door, shouting out several choice swearwords. After a short moment, the door opened up so suddenly Harry almost fell into the bathroom.
Malfoy shook his head frantically at Luna, who simply smiled and bounced off to join Neville on the dancefloor.
“Celebrations, apparently. Pansy says here to think of fireworks, balloons and streamers. Dress code is the same as always, though.”
Harry wanted to interrupt, to say he didn’t give a shit, or that he was sorry for bringing up his father yesterday, but Malfoy held up his hand.
A thought occurred to him, one that before now had only surfaced in the deepest dark of night, when he woke sweating and sobbing. What if he didn’t deserve a great happiness? What if there never was a moment where Harry realised everything had been for a reason, and all his trauma had led him to some wonderful thing? What if everything he’d done, all the terrible and monstrous things he’d had no choice but to do, had condemned him?
“Ugh. There’s a used condom in the wastepaper bin. Looks recent – must have been here in the last twenty-four hours or so.” Harry grimaced. “So we know she was having a sexual, and perhaps romantic, relationship with someone. And we can guess by the condoms that it’s a man, although there’s no significant other listed in her file.”
“Is she serious? She managed all that in under twenty minutes?” He hissed, wide-eyed. Harry saw Hermione smile to herself through all her hair. Triumphant with Malfoy’s eyes finally on him, Harry replied.
She nodded and pushed two thick pieces of paper over the counter towards them.
Not saying anything, Harry caught Malfoy’s eye, waiting to see him smile weakly back before they ventured into the gloom of the forest.
Both men stared for a second, and then, slowly, afraid of what they might find, they made their way up the stairs, stepping over the body. They walked through the hallway towards the only open doorway. Pausing at the doorway, they snapped on latex gloves – Harry had strongly campaigned for better on-scene conduct for Aurors, taking cues from Muggle police. Aurors actually used fingerprinting and DNA evidence now, which Harry considered a minor miracle.
And so Harry and Malfoy found themselves in the outskirts of London as the afternoon drew to a close, knocking on Susan’s front door. There was no answer, and the door swung open when pushed, no longer locked. Sharing a worried glance, both men cautiously stepped inside the house, Malfoy drawing his wand, Harry letting a spell bloom in his fingertips.
“Yeah, I always do, you know that.” He did – Hermione had forced him the first year, saying somehow both sarcastically and earnestly that the great Harry Potter attending such an event would go a long way to repair relations after the war. He’d grumbled, but it had been so much fun that he promised to go every year.
Harry laughed, loudly, caught off guard by Malfoy’s openness and lack of embarrassment when talking about sex – it was still something Harry couldn’t talk about much. Vernon’s disparaging and offensive comments about ‘fancy men’ and ‘faggots’ had obviously had a lasting impact.
Without waiting for a reply, Harry stormed out of Malfoy’s flat, slamming the door behind him, and apparated home.
“Alright, I get your point.” Harry laughed, tucking into the meal. “When did you become such a good cook?”
“How did you contact the werewolf packs when you were underground, Lupin? We need to get in contact with the Northumberland pack.”
“It’s not a date.”
“Tell Granger I say hello.” He added as he returned to his papers.
For someone who had grown up in the muggle world, Harry knew very little about the muggle world – his childhood with the Dursleys had left him somewhat lacking, and he was still catching up. He’d been learning about the magical world during his time at Hogwarts, and now he was learning about the muggle world.
The end result was a sort of lopsided circle around several towns and villages and a small forest.
Busying himself with collecting up papers, Malfoy replied. “I don’t tell you everything, you know, Potter.”
“Not dancing?”
“Blaise, dearest, this really is a day for celebrating. You are the bravest, most wonderful man I’ve ever met. You have always been by my side and I couldn’t be happier to be standing here with you, with the rest of our lives ahead of us. I can’t wait to be your wife.”
They ate in comfortable silence, until Harry suddenly dropped his fork with a gasp.
Harry didn’t know how to explain it without mentioning the Horcruxes, but he had to try. “I died. I saw Dumbledore. And then I came back, and your mother lied to him. She saved my life by telling him I was dead, and all because she wanted to save you.”
“That’s different. I had to know you could be trusted.” Even as he said it, Harry realised it was a mistake. Malfoy’s pale cheeks reddened and his voice almost squeaked as he fought to keep it low and even.
“What the hell do we do?”
“What’s wrong with you?” He blurted.
“It’s not about trusting him. I’d trust him with my life – I do every time we’re out on a mission. I just…don’t want to talk about it.” He paused, and Hermione waited patiently. She was used to his way of speaking about personal things – slowly, and painfully, but always relieved afterwards.
Her crying petered out and she started to speak, telling them about the times she’d ‘woken up’ in a strange place, no idea how she got there, or when she’d realised she was missing hours of her life, or, the worst, when she’d found blood on her hands but didn’t know whose it was.
“What does that have to do with us? We will solve our problems as we always have – by ourselves.”
“Vicky?” Malfoy whispered under his breath to Harry, who replied with a smirk.
This time Harry woke in his own bed, and Malfoy was still lying there beside him, sleeping softly. Harry smiled and moved to kiss him gently on the forehead before getting out of bed to shower.
“Agreed. It says here he almost got expelled from Hogwarts for attacking a fellow student. He claimed she was part Veela, although her heritage was never proved. She nearly died, apparently.”
Malfoy nodded, thinking. He didn’t speak for a long time.
“Yeah, it was alright, I’ll tell you all later. What’s so funny?”
“You seem happier.” Ron told Harry as they put away the plates, Malfoy and Hermione chatting in the living room.
“I saw these yesterday, but I didn’t realise they might be important.”
“That’s tomorrow? Bugger! I’ll have to cancel drinks with my team, then.”
“Only just got here, actually, but yeah.”
“Well, you can explain to Granger and Weasley why we’re late for Roseanne’s birthday.”
“That’s OK, Potter. I do, too.” Malfoy reached out to gently stroke Harry’s cheek softly with his finger, looking like he thought Harry might not let him. It felt terribly intimate, and Harry almost blushed and turned away, but he stuck it out, feeling fire where Malfoy’s finger touched his cheek.
“I always read the Prophet, it was my father’s favourite newspaper.”
Contrary to Harry’s belief, neither Ron nor Hermione had been terribly worried about him (Pansy had tipped them off that he was fine, although she clearly hadn’t told them everything).
Harry nodded. He didn’t refute Ron’s claim about his Occlumency skills – it was one of the few skills he’d been totally unable to develop, despite more training in recent years.
Harry had barely leaned in when Malfoy (Draco? Harry thought, wondering how weird it would be to call him that) pulled Harry into his flat, pushing the front door shut with his foot. Malfoy pushed him up against the door and kissed him, hard. Harry let out a squeak of surprise as his back hit the door and Malfoy broke the kiss to laugh, resting his forehead against Harry’s.
Harry was saved from having to answer by the arrival of a bright red Howler. Malfoy finally looked up, seeming amused as Ron’s voice bellowed out.
“Well, we don’t know the gender yet, but for a girl, we were thinking of Roseanne Molly Granger-Weasley, after our mothers.”
“You’re right, it doesn’t. There’s more, but I can’t, and won’t, ever tell you. If you want to be my partner…and my friend, you’ll have to accept that.”
“Don’t worry, Hermione, we know what to do.”
“I was just telling Hermione about someone I worked on this morning.” Luna replied airily, beaming at Harry as she reached across Hermione to pat his leg in greeting. He grinned back.
Harry sat back down. Malfoy was upset about the lie, clearly, and the best thing to do was sit it out.
“That’s not the point, Malfoy! I know we couldn’t have saved her life but we could have saved her from this!” Harry gestured wildly to her body lying in the murky ditch water and, to his horror, burst into tears. Embarrassed, he wiped his tears away angrily, refusing to look at Malfoy. Hermione and Ron had drawn away to contact forensics, and to give them some much needed space.
The conversation moved on, and Harry was on his fifth beer when he realised it was almost midnight.
Harry stood out there, in the rapidly cooling darkness, as the evening ended and people started to head home. Nobody came to check on him – they probably thought he’d stormed off home.
Malfoy’s flat was minimalistic – mostly black, white and grey, with a large sofa in front of…was that a muggle TV? The main room was open plan, with the living room spreading seamlessly into a kitchen that looked so unlike Harry’s own cluttered, chaotic kitchen that he couldn’t help rolling his eyes.
Harry startled, uncomfortable. He resisted the urge to sniff for this apparent stench, instead focusing on dampening the fire inside of him. Ginny had once mentioned that his magic felt like fire when it spilled over, and he’d been self-conscious ever since.
“Plus it’s easier to do common clothes than designer clothes.” Malfoy added, stepping neatly out of the way of Harry’s jokey kick as they closed the cottage door behind them and started the walk towards the village.
“You had his textbook? No wonder you were suddenly a Potions prodigy that year!” He sounded jealous, and Harry was reminded of his obsessive love for Potions back in school.
“You’re dreaming of causing violence again?” Luna’s voice was without emotion, as it always was when someone came to her with troubles, and it reassured Harry. She knew which part of his nightmares worried him the most – he hated that the war had changed him, that hunting and hurting people now came easily to him.
Harry frowned at having to work on the weekend, but he had nothing better planned, and he knew he couldn’t complain.
Harry joined Hermione and Luna at the table, watching his husband twirling Roseanne around in circles.
Trying to ignore Hermione’s shrewd glances, Harry suggested a toast to the happy couple, and he and Ron vanished into the kitchen to get glasses and a bottle or two of wine. Although it would be just as easy to do it with magic, they often did this to catch up, just the two of them.
There were countless about his relationship with Ginny – “Poor Weasley shacks up with arrogant Potter”, “Potter cheats his girl and his best friend” (a photo of him and Hermione), “The Boy Who Lived can’t love” (after their break up).
Hermione’s eyes shot to the stone clenched in Harry’s fist.
Harry was still thinking about the painting several minutes later as a brief break was announced. Harry was about to ask Malfoy about it when he saw Susan Darling across the crowd, cheerily downing a glass of wine while chatting to the people beside her. Harry was struck by how casually she was behaving, compared to the prim and almost restrained woman he’d met the day before. He grabbed Malfoy’s arm, ignoring the sour look Malfoy gave him as he spilled his champagne slightly.
“Hey, mate! Hey, Malfoy.” Ron greeted cheerily, breezing across the room to sit on Harry’s desk.
“Alright, coming up! And your cousin will be wanting her ham and cheese toastie, will she?”
“I can teach you the muggle way, if you want?”
“Alright, that’ll probably take Granger an hour or two, max, to do, so I suggest we head to the latest crime scene.”
Something about the look on his face (concern? pity? affection, even?) struck a chord in Harry, set something alight, and thoughtlessly he lunged forward, almost falling into Malfoy’s lap as he kissed him.
Harry was about to speak when there was a growl behind them. Both men spun around, but were careful not to raise their wands or their hands, as Hermione had instructed them. They came face to face with a naked bearded man, at least six feet tall, towering over them. His body was streaked with mud and his nails were long and yellow.
“Oh, he’s still asleep.” He tucked into the food happily, feeling better with each mouthful. “I thought I’d go see Suzanne today, is she in?”
“Thanks, mate.”
“I’ll be helping Pansy and Blaise set up the house, of course.”
“That explains the behavioural changes.”
“That reminds me – after her wedding, she accidentally let slip that you talk about me to her.”
“Um, I don’t know. We didn’t talk about that, really.”
“How are you going to research something that Granger can’t?”
Then Ron and Harry had given speeches. Ron’s had been, typically, full of jokes and stories, but there was no denying the strength of his emotion. Harry, who was a more nervous public speaker, chose not to say too much, but instead read out a beautiful poem about love and marriage (Malfoy had helped him choose it).
“Excellent show of house spirit.” Ron chortled, and Harry rolled his eyes, gesturing at Ron’s own ginger hair as though to say, “Look who’s talking!”
“Because she realised what he was doing to her. It’s the only explanation.” Harry felt sick, he could feel his stomach roiling at the thought of what she’d experienced. Malfoy closed his eyes, imagining the scene before him.
Aha! Harry thought. He’s into guys! He was triumphant for a short second, before thinking, why do I really care who he dates? It’s not like he brings them into the office, so it doesn’t affect me.
“Rabnott was so embarrassed he took a week off work to hide from everyone!”
Harry couldn’t help smiling at the thought of Malfoy being distracted by their kiss, although he felt bad Malfoy had ruined his reputation of giving the best speeches.
Harry didn’t reply, instead choosing to blast Malfoy with the shower head, already laughing even before Malfoy let out a shriek of horror.
“Nothing important.” Malfoy replied, shrugging as he pulled Harry back towards him, into his arms.
“She didn’t let that slip, she’s been threatening to tell you for ages.”
“You know Hannah Abbott’s cousin, James? I went on a few dates with him a couple of years ago, but we never clicked.”
“I…Well…None.” Harry’s panicked lie wasn’t believable, though – Malfoy could see right through him.
“Why don’t you have any of this stuff out there?” Harry hooked a thumb behind him, towards the main room.
“Scared, Malfoy?”
“Yeah, it was shit, mate. He forgot half of it and had to get his notes out.” Ron looked delighted at the thought of perfect Draco Malfoy having to read his speech from his notes, although he wisely kept that thought to himself – Hermione, who never used notes, wouldn’t hear any criticism of memorisation.
“What’s wrong? Another nightmare?” Ron asked, voice uncharacteristically quiet – it was the voice both he and Hermione reserved for when Harry had another episode.
“I want to go to muggle London.”
“How do you know about that?”
Harry quickly joined her, removing his cloak as he commended her.
Glad he’d been to see Ron first, he replied “No, of course not.” She nodded, and waited for him to speak again.
Worried, Harry drew back, but Malfoy didn’t look upset – he looked nervous, perhaps.
He’d used the stone twice since his conversation with his parents and the rest of his family in the Forbidden Forest, and each time he swore he’d never use it again. Both Ron and Hermione had been willingly sworn to secrecy, vowing never to tell an outsider that Harry had kept the three Deathly Hallows, and neither knew where it was hidden – Harry had cast a Fidelius Charm and had become the Secret Keeper to the location. It had taken weeks for them to come to the decision unanimously - Harry had been adamant he didn’t want them, but Ron, and then Hermione, had convinced him he was the only hope of ensuring they stayed safe and secret.
Malfoy sought out Harry in the chaos that followed, his own small smile shining out at Harry.
Harry couldn’t breathe – his whole hand was on fire, and he could feel Malfoy’s chest resting up against his knees. Malfoy didn’t look up at him once as he traced the wound with his wand, carefully sealing the cut and siphoning away the blood. The moment seemed to last forever – Harry’s hand clasped in Malfoy’s, his warm breath feathering against the soft, new skin.
“Uh, yes, please, that would be great.” Harry answered.
“I’d like to give it a try, certainly.”
“Is this about Connor Johnson? Did Neville tell you I rejected him? It wouldn’t have worked out, he’s not my type, and you know that.”
“Malfoy. You have to understand…this is confidential. It’s a secret, it’s...”
Harry quickly explained his nightmare and the generalities of his and Malfoy’s case – Ron had been an excellent Auror before heading up the Strategic and Tactical Analysis department, and if anyone could understand, it would be him. Ron listened in silence to Harry’s worries and fears, face unusually grave.
The sun had set by the time the plans were made, and they agreed to meet at the edge of the forest early the next morning to set everything in motion.
“Don’t be sorry. It feels more homely than my flat does, but I don’t see why you can’t keep it tidy.” Malfoy was smiling (he clearly wasn’t trying to be offensive) and so Harry smiled too.
“You could have done that without involving us.”
“That level of torture…” Malfoy hesitated. “It wasn’t just for information – Susan wasn’t an Auror, she wasn’t trained to resist torture, she would have cracked long before he needed to cut out her eye.”
Harry relented, wrapping his arms around his husband, but Malfoy pulled back.
Susan’s face was blank for a long moment, and then, as though surfacing from deep under water, her face cleared and she nodded, relaxing into her chair, more at ease, but still not making eye contact.
“Of course – ask anything you want. But can I ask about Teddy, first?”
The room slowly darkened, until it was only lit by the flickering electric bulb above their heads, and Harry leant back in his uncomfortable seat, stretching. Malfoy watched out of the corner of his eye, presumably to see if he’d return to work or if he intended to finish for the day.
Harry stopped short, feeling the buzz, feeling his heart catch. At the end of the little corridor was a large painting of the minutes after Voldemort’s death, and standing in front of it, stock still, was Malfoy.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of course you are! It’s just the Resurrection Stone, Malfoy. I told you about the Wand, didn’t I?”
“Well, I’d just died, so I think it’s understandable.” Harry joked, and could have slapped himself – it was the sort of joke he’d make with Ron or Hermione – people who knew the truth about the night in the forest.
“And we kissed again, and then we shared a bed, and that’s it.”
“Oh, sorry! I spoke to McGonagall and she sent me the files of everybody who studied at Hogwarts in the last thirty years.”
Susan looked at it a long time, working her way down each date and thinking hard about each one. Her face grew more pinched as the seconds dragged on, and both men watched her fingers start twitching.
“That bastard! That slimy, disgusting evil bastard!” Susan shouted, and Harry as amazed to hear her raise her voice for the first time in their interactions. She clearly remembered everything, or at least enough.
“I heard on the grapevine that Hermione is pregnant! How exciting!”
Harry pictured Pansy, beautiful and charming, smiling her knife-sharp smirk. She worked in the Department of International Magical Cooperation as a diplomat, along with her boyfriend, Blaise. She was sarcastic and funny and surprisingly cheerful, and Harry felt sick to think of the horrors she could have been subjected to.
“That’s a good idea, actually, Weasley. We could do with the extra manpower since this case seems to be spreading in several directions at once.”
“Hello, hello! What would you like today?”
They ate as they discussed what they had each found so far – Harry had been going through some of her notes on her magical creature rights campaigns in America, which were very detailed but had nothing to do with her presence in England. Malfoy hadn’t had better luck – he’d found a stack of papers that seemed to be in code, but he was fairly sure they were about werewolf packs in Britain.
“Hello, Professor. Sorry to bring you back, but I have a question.”
“Jesus, Potter, calm down. If you wanted a shower you should have gotten up earlier.”
“I’ll have the same, thanks.” Malfoy added.
“I stayed at Malfoy’s.”
Harry rolled his eyes at Malfoy, adding the date of the event to his note to Ron, reminding him to keep the night clear. Every year, he forgot and scheduled some team meeting or drinks with friends, despite, every year, Harry and Hermione reminding him multiple times. Harry suspected it was a little bit of Ron’s subconscious prejudice against Slytherin acting up, because Ron always enjoyed the event more than anybody else when he actually got there.
“Well, I need to write my part of Savage’s report, for a start!” Harry gestured to the papers that had lain untouched all night. “And I’ll need to sleep off this hangover, too.”
“I don’t suppose Cressida mentioned what she’s doing here, did she? She’ll only tell us it’s a surprise, but, well, we like to be prepared for anything!” Malfoy was all smiles and sweetness, and Harry had to twist away to turn a snort into a fake sneeze at the sight of Malfoy’s bright, innocent smile.
