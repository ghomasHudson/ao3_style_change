“Some point in the next week or so.  I don’t actually know the date, but it wasn’t straight away if what he told me when I was younger is true.”
Ginny, Ron and Hermione try and search for Harry in the immediate aftermath of his disappearence.
“I know you would have.  I just…”
“No.  No you are not.”  Cissa snapped back.  There was denial in her voice, but Andi was fairly certain her sister had believed her words, even if she didn’t want to accept them.  Andi hadn’t wanted to accept them either when the healers first told her.
“We’re not using that one!” Harry went wide eyed in horror.  “It involves flesh of the servant.  Draco… Wormtail cut of his hand… you’re not doing it.”
“Did he do his scary calm thing?”
“They’re gone.”  Harry whispered.  “Do I just…?”
“The cloak… It was given to me anonymously on my first Christmas in the wizarding world.  It was Dumbledore.  It had a note saying that dad had left it with him, and he was returning it to me.  The map… Yes, I know it’s a map… It was given to me the year you escaped from Azkaban.  By the Weasley twins… they’re three I think right now… they stole it from Filch’s office in their first year at Hogwarts.  I know this all sounds like nonsense.  But look… I know how to open it… I solemnly swear I’m up to no good.”
Scorpius’s thumb was trailing over her nipple.  It went hard under his caress and she felt a warm, pleasurable feeling low down between her legs.   He started kissing her again, her mouth, her ear, her neck.  Then his tongue found the nipple he’d be stroking.
“You could do some of the holiday homework with me.  I still have Snapes essay for potions to finish.”
“See you tomorrow.”
“Me too.”  It was said softly.  Without inflection.  Hermione knew Ron so well now, after all these years and two kids together, how important this small confession was.  It was the first time in years that Ron had admitted out loud to missing Harry, and it made Hermione wish that there was some way that Harry would let her bring Ron in on their tentative steps at becoming, if not friends again, but at least acquaintances.   She also knew she couldn’t force it.  Harry had shown her a degree of trust.  Trust she hadn’t seen from him since before he walked into the forest to die, and she knew that if she pushed it, then whatever was building between them would shatter, and be lost forever.  They had waited twenty-three years for this step.  They didn’t have to rush it.
“That was what, eight, nine years ago now.”
Draco pondered what Harry had said before responding.  “So we take Sirius with us to the Potter place and leave him to sleep the drink off there.  We can talk to him later about what role he wants to play.  But if he puts either us or little Harry at risk, I won’t hesitate to obliviate him and leave him to his grief.  We’ll leave the country if that happens and no one will see us, or little Harry again.  I’m sure mother will be on board if we have to do that, so it would just be a matter of timing.”
Harry snorted at the blunt sarcasm.  He’d heard Malfoy use words like that as a defence mechanism before, for once he was in on the joke though.  It felt nice.  “Dumbledore it is then.  I don’t really fancy dying right now, nor making you feel guilt ridden about leading to me to my death, either.”  He said, shaking his head.  He clambered to his feet and then helped pull Malfoy up.  He kept hold of Malfoy’s hand even when the other boy was standing. Both of them were scared and having a physical connection between them was comforting.  Harry led Malfoy towards Privet drive.  At the edge of the park Harry felt resistance from Malfoy.  He looked back and saw Malfoy had stopped by the bin and was looking down into it.  The expression on his face was strange and he kept on looking between the paper and the watch on his right wrist.
“Not really.”  Harry replied as he finished emptying his bladder and flushed the toilet before washing his hands.
“He said that she shouldn’t say anything.”
Harry beamed at Draco, unable to contain his joy.  “Guess.”
“Yes and no.  At the beginning, it was easy to ignore the problems, but after being together as long as we were, we ended up just friends, not husband and wife.  Then she met Daphne at a friend’s not long before that scathing article of Skeeter’s about the Leaky Cauldron.  She found what she was missing with me and I’m happy for her now”
“It was so wrong.  So wrong.  He shouldn’t have been in your head.”  Draco whimpered into Harry’s neck.
“We’ve gone over it with Remus too, and he seems to think it’s safe.  Well as safe as it gets when dealing with soul fragments.”
“Probably not.”
“Sorry to interrupt you guys, but you’re both wanted in the Headmistress’s office, as soon as possible.”
Harry couldn’t move.  He was frozen to the spot in shock at what had just happened.  Ginny seemed to be in the same position.  It wasn’t often he saw her speechless.  The silence built between them until Harry could no longer bear it.
He apparated out of the Ministry lobby, not caring that it was only lunch time.  It wasn’t like he was the only one who ever took liberties with their lunch breaks.  If anyone said something about his unauthorised absence, he would just have to put up with Robards shouting at him.  It’s not like they’d ever do anything to actually discipline him for skipping work.  He was still the Golden Boy.  Too special to have to abide by all of the usual regulations.  The thought left a bitter taste in his mouth.
“Yes… Well…” Draco stammered.
“Anything specific?”
“And who exactly would buy from me.  No one trusts me.  I don’t even really know why you’re still here at all…”
“It’s probably going to scar, but my hair will cover it soon enough.  And besides, it’s only a scar.  It doesn’t matter.”  Harry tried to reassure Draco, unsuccessfully, with his words.  He went with a different tact, pulling Draco down onto his chest, stroking the soft blonde hair gently, not caring that the pressure on bruises hurt, or that his arms felt like lead weights.
They arrived in the village at lunch time.  They left James’ trunk at the station to be taken to the school with the others when they arrived later.  Rather than going straight up to the school Harry decided that they should go for some lunch first.  James looked uneasy at the suggestion, evidently assuming he was in some kind of trouble.  They went to one of the newer coffee shops that hadn’t been there when Harry was a school.  Ordering at the counter found a table at the back and waited for their order.
“Do you think you can move now?” Harry asked, when Malfoy’s breathing seemed to have settled back to a more regular pattern.
Ginny was the first to speak after the three of them had waited in silence for several minutes.
“Well this whole thing is meant to be about showing you the wonders of muggles and the like.”
“Once the link wasn’t strained when you touched me, it stopped feeling just… not wrong, but started feeling right.”
Harry left feeling better.  He decided he would walk to Diagon Alley.  It was a nice day and it wasn’t so far from this part of London, even with his aching leg.  Doris hadn’t bothered going over the simple exercises he’d learnt with her previously that worked so well with his drinking before.  She correctly assumed that he remembered them and that when he needed to, he utilised them, usually.  There was no judgement from Doris about the episode of drinking that lead him to Malfoy’s the other night. She saw it for what it was, a brief loss of control in an extreme circumstance, not the undoing of nearly 20 years’ worth of work.  It had taken him a few tries before he managed to stop his destructive behaviour, and there was never a hint of disappointment from her, even when he decided that abstinence wasn’t necessary for him.  He’d investigated a few muggle programmes before he found Doris, thinking they might be a bit more discrete.  He found the focus on complete abstinence and that every drink was a failure, unbearable.  Telling himself he was powerless against it didn’t really help him either.  He trusted her when she said that avoiding alcohol completely whist his head wasn’t focused was a good idea though.  He’d barely walked 5 minutes, not even reaching Holborn station, before changing his mind about where he wanted to go.  It was almost the same distance to Grimmauld place as it was to Diagon Alley.  He had moved out of his house when he’d married Ginny.  She hadn’t wanted to live there, but he hadn’t wanted to sell it.  Besides it wasn’t like they needed the capital between the Black and Potter vaults he’d inherited.  Instead they’d rented it to a variety of wizards and witches over the years.  He couldn’t remember whether it was occupied presently, the estate agent near Kings Cross dealt with that, but he could stop by on the way.  He would have to talk to them anyway to find out if he could move back in anytime soon.  He thought it was probably easier if he let Ginny have the family home.  He turned around and made his way back the way he came. Then onwards, through the streets between Bloomsbury and Kings Cross, passing small bookshops, cafes and the Royal Institute for the Blind.
Harry couldn’t help the grin that spread across his face and threw his arms around Draco.
“Care to elaborate.”
“I know it hurts… here take this…”
“We can tell from the look on your face we know you think you’ve got a big story with that photo, and you’re also petrified that we’re going to stop you.”  Harry Potter states, matter of factly, when he comes close enough that they don’t need to shout.
“No.  Ron told me that he’d managed to get an emergency portkey arranged.  In theory he should be arriving soon.  At least Gin has Molly and Hermione in there with her.  Still I couldn’t imagine not having been there for any of my kids being born.”  Harry noticed Draco’s expression change and remembered what he’d said earlier about Scorpius’s birth.  He guessed Draco hadn’t been allowed in the room.  “Hey, come on.” Harry continued trying to change the subject.  “Let’s go have a smoke and leave this lot to their fretting.”
“Thank you, Harry.”
“What about?  What earthshattering news do you have to tell me today that requires gracing me with your presence?  I’ve already had a crap day trying comfort my distraught son and I really don’t see why I need to deal with you right now” The tone was harsh with a hint of familiar sarcasm, but now Harry was actually thinking and analysing the situation, rather than running from it, he knew that it was primarily fuelled by guilt and worry, rather than disdain.
“I never expected you to do any less.  I’m surprised you didn’t just blast apart the court room and apparate him away there and then.”
“Gran!  Are you here?”  He said, his panic coming through clearly in his voice.  His hair had turned its natural, slightly mousy, brown.
“You look like shit.”  Potter said, entering the classroom.
“No you don’t.”  Harry said, rather harshly.  “You no more deserved to be despised than I did when I was a child.”
“Yeah, we had a huge fight and broke up at the end of the Easter holidays.  I had barely been holding it together for most of the year and he wasn’t much better.  We just about managed to keep each other whole up till that point.  Then it all went wrong.  After that fight I kind of lost it… when you found me in that bathroom… I was a complete mess…”
It also meant, to Draco’s delight, that they were able to go clothes shopping.  Shopping in muggle London with Draco was an interesting experience, to say the least.  They had decided to limit their time in the wizarding areas to only absolute essentials until they had credible fake identities. Harry wondered why they didn’t just shop in Cheltenham and get the whole process over and done with quickly, but that would not do for his blond companion.  Draco insisted on the absolute best of everything for little Harry.  Things that Harry couldn’t have pictured Aunt Petunia ever buying for him.  Not that he thought she ever bought anything for him.  He spent his life in Dudley’s hand me downs.  Worn and too big.  Never anything new, and certainly never anything of the cost and quality Draco bought.  They also bought new wardrobes for the two of them.  Draco had complained and whined far too much about wearing an outfit of Sirius’ that morning, to put off new wardrobes for the two of them for very long.  Harry found he really enjoyed watching Draco get excited over baby things and muggle clothes.  Finding clothes Draco would actually wear was interesting.  He kept on insisting everything was out of date and unfashionable.  Harry had never realised that Draco and about half of the Slytherin girls had a thing for muggle fashion.  That there was an underground trade in fashion magazines that was kept secret from all of their parents.  Draco had never actually been able to just shop for muggle clothes before though.  He’d always just been put in something his parents deemed appropriate when he’d been around muggles when he was younger.  Before Draco asked for something that wasn’t around yet, Harry bought him a few magazines to look through and things went much smoother after that.  Draco was in his element, even going so far as to buy a bunch of makeup to try out, though Harry was slightly baffled as to why.  Harry didn’t really care for fashion.  All he cared for was that he had something that fit to wear.  If Draco got his way both Harry and little Harry were going to be fashion icons.  Harry was feeling very grateful by the time they finished for the undetectable extension and featherlight charms on his school rucksack.  There was no way they’d have been able to carry everything they’d purchased without it.
Draco kicks Zabini's foot in silent retort, melancholy gone and the red in his face back on high.
“I've been
“Tomorrow,” Draco murmurs above him a few silent moments later. “Same time.”
It's not sadness or jealousy or loss for the couple. Draco knows Potter and Ginny have been apart for years, quite amicably. But it

“Please tell me you don't actually fancy Luna or someone like that.”
Of course Malfoy wouldn't have stopped doing whatever he was up to doing.
Nonetheless all Potter's done since is toss his wand back to him with great, visible gratitude and eyes loaded with questions, and Draco's done well avoiding him with just a few routine snipes when they grow too near one another to let things seem normal on the outside to the rest. But on the inside he's draining to the point of wondering why he's still here, still enduring glares and arguments, still being distrusted by Potter's friends.

It pisses him off, but he gets it, and that's why he's even stopped glancing Potter's way at dinner when he sees Weasley's sister sitting so close to the person he wants more than anything.
It's not the same redness that sometimes shows itself when Draco gets Potter too riled up.
Draco snickers. His sympathy is so deep that it has no end. He boldly reaches and pats Harry's leg once before resting his hand to his right knee. “I understand. I mean...why do you think I'm stuck?”
, and it makes him laugh inwardly.
“Tell him, for one,” Draco mutters, heart aching. “Who's to say he wouldn't

Draco adjusts on the chair, leans so their shoulders touch over the small gap between them. “Harry, you and I...we'll always have our secrets. You know that. I know that.

And each time Draco endures the Charms class he shares with Potter, feeling those green eyes squarely upon his back
“I know.  I did.  I do want you to go.  It’s why I told you to earlier.   I don’t think you should give things up for me and logically I know that you’re perfectly safe there.  But it’s like…  It wasn’t that bad when you left, but the closer it got to when you’re supposed to be back, the worse I started feeling.  It’s like something is trying to eat at my insides and I kept imagining that the worst has happened, and you won’t step through the fireplace like you’re supposed to.”  Harry felt like shit when Draco said that.  He felt so guilty.  Because that was exactly what had happened.  He was the one that had caused this new source of anxiety for the man who already had enough triggers in his life.  Harry had known before that him going to work made Draco feel anxious and he and Tara had spent hours working on coping mechanisms, but Blaise going to work never did that before.  Harry also felt guilty that he hadn’t noticed that Draco had gotten anxious, normally he would have.  He’d have to work out which of the potions he’d taken had made him feel so lethargic that he hadn’t even noticed his lover’s stress and hopefully stop taking it.
“Nope.”  Harry grinned widely.
“Not talking about the music.  But that was pretty amazing too, and don’t pout at me about wrong notes.  I was talking about how you’re managing with the funeral and your mother turning up.  As well as introducing Andi and Teddy into our lives.  I know none of this has been easy for you.”
“Well, you won’t hear me complaining.”
They spent the next hour happily chatting about Grimmauld, University, Healer training and James’ fast approaching NEWTs.  Harry loved hearing James so excited about everything, telling Harry every detail about the combined muggle and magical medical degree he’d been accepted on from UCL.  Harry wished opportunities like this had been available when he was James’ age, but it had only been in the last 10 years that mixed magical muggle programmes became common place.  Harry knew that Hermione’s campaigning had been a significant influence on this area of progress.  It was definitely one of the better causes she’d become passionate about and used her significant influence to change the historical model into something more progressive and modern.
“Wasn’t it?”
“I haven’t noticed the feeling sick thing.  Although Blaise touching me to help me get to you didn’t seem to bother me.”  Draco paused.  Then he remembered.  There was one time he had felt sick.  “There was something on that last day of term.  Before everything else happened.  Maybe a couple of hours earlier.  I felt wrong and threw up.  No one was touching me at the time, but it sounds like a similar thing to what you’re describing.”
So I'm stuck in 12 weeks of isolation.  Hopefully I can use my time to finally finish this story.
“Maybe you can show me later.”
“Did you cheat? Because if you did, you being my best friend wouldn’t stop me from hurting you.”
“I know, but I want to be close to you tonight.”
“Sod off, Malfoy.”  Harry chuckled in amusement, glad that Draco had bounced back from his near panic attack.  He heard Draco leave the room, and Harry continued putting the breakfast together, grabbing the smoked salmon from the magically cooled cabinet that served as a fridge.  Until he had moved in with Blaise and Draco, Harry hadn’t really understood the magical adaptations to kitchens.  He’d never bothered using the one at Grimmauld place, and usually relied Kreacher, takeaways or going to the Weasleys.  There was something depressing about cooking for one, so he’d avoided it.  Living with Draco and Blaise though, he found his love for cooking.  Making food for people you cared about and seeing them enjoy it was a very different experience to being forced to cook for the Dursley’s as a child.  Draco reappeared dressed smartly in a pair of grey trousers and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up, just as Harry laid the two plates on the counter.  He eased himself up onto one of the stools with only a slight wince where the movement sent a jab of pain through slowly healing ribs.  After they had finished Draco went and grabbed some towels and a bowl of warm water and set up one of the stools so that he could try and fix Harry’s hair.  Harry relaxed as Draco’s skilled fingers washed his hair and massaged his head.  Harry hadn’t noticed how bad the headache had gotten until it started to ease under Draco’s ministrations.   When his hair was clean and conditioned, Draco proceeded to use his wand to carefully style Harry’s hair into something that hopefully didn’t resemble a train wreck.  Grooming charms were some of the few pieces of magic Draco ever did these days.  When he was done applying the final product of what felt like a hundred to Harry, Draco took a step back, nodded in satisfaction, before kissing Harry on the forehead.
“Very well, Mr. Malfoy. Have a seat. I will have you pour and drink your tea in a moment.”
Panicked at the thousand questions entering his mind as a result of seeing and feeling evidence of
Nothing will ever come from it. He knows that. Nothing ever can.
As Draco curses the apparent costs of being a good mate to someone, Potter murmurs, “I know. That's...one reason I didn't, too.”
Potter cackles loudly next to him, one broad palm smacking a thigh. “Damn, I forget how funny you are sometimes.”
“You know, real or not, I think that look was

Harry's eyes round behind his glasses, and he stares, looking anywhere else in the nearby vicinity of the Maurader's Map, like he has each time before, wondering how Malfoy is doing it.

With a tight swallow, Draco looks back to his book...but under the table he rubs his leg against the one currently wrapped around his, and across the table Potter sighs.
So what if Potter had caught himself falling as Draco had expected of the athlete, rolling for a moment and bending with his robes shifted to the side for Draco to see something he's been growing more and more curious about each passing day?
He's not sure what Zabini's true motive is, but the Slytherin in him
. Not here. Not here, not anywhere.
“I know.  But the resentment is.  Lily and I have spoken about that a lot.  Sometimes we talk about keeping her.”
“Is it now.” Draco heard rather than saw the cheeky grin he remembered as Harry said this.
“Fuck.”
“Say something Draco.  Please.  It was a fucked-up mistake and it never should have happened.”
“Sorry.  It’s just, I finally talked to Draco last night.  Properly.  Everything else around me, the both of us really, is falling apart.  But somehow, the two of us have finally decided to try and make this thing work.  It’s Draco’s son that got my daughter pregnant and I’ve spent most of the last two days on a downward spiral, but his friend finally kicked some sense into me. Now I just feel like a huge weight has been lifted from me and I can finally breathe again.”
“Not like they’d invite you anyway.”
_____________
The last two weeks of Harry’s sick leave were almost exactly like a holiday, with Christmas falling in the middle of it.  Draco was back to how he’d been before Harry’s accident, much to all of their relief.  They knew Harry’s first day back at work would be hard on him, but between them and Tara they had a plan for the day to try and make it as easy as possible.  Harry spent time a lot of time with Teddy, taking him out to parks, and the zoo.  Even to a funfair one evening.  Andi was still looking very tired and seemed incredibly appreciative of the break from the toddler.  Harry had been increasingly tempted to ask her what was wrong, but each time he went over he put it off.  Harry had even spent a couple of evenings at Ron and Hermione’s, having dinner with the couple and talking about the baby.  He still hadn’t told Ron that he was seeing two men, rather than one woman, and Hermione gave him increasingly pointed glares every time his partner came up.  Christmas day had been split between the Weasleys, Andi and Teddy, and home.  Overall, life was really good.  His first day back at work came all to soon though.  Saying goodbye to Draco that morning was particularly hard.  Blaise had left for work before Harry, kissing both of them goodbye whilst they sat and ate breakfast together.  Blaise was planning on popping by to see Draco at lunchtime to make sure everything was okay at home.  Tara was also due to come for a session whilst Draco was by himself.  Harry eventually dragged himself out of the house with less than two minutes to spare.  He hugged Draco tightly before he left, and it was only with numerous reassurances from the blonde man that he managed to step into the fireplace and head to the Ministry.
“Only the basic versions?”  Hermione was shocked that there were multiple versions of whatever it was they did.  Against what she thought was her better judgment, she actually did want to talk to Draco about it.  Magical advancements, no matter who made them, were worth investigating.
“If you’re…”
“Mine…”  Draco whispered and then fell into a more restful state of sleep.  Harry and Blaise eased him down onto the pillows between them.  They didn’t need to say anything to know that any discussions about what had happened should wait till the morning.  Harry didn’t think he’d be able to sleep, but with Draco pressed into him and his hand tangled with Blaise’s he eventually drifted off.  The room didn’t wake them with an alarm in the morning, and it was nearly noon before they started to stir.
“Draco….”  Harry whined.
“What about a password?”  Blaise said.  “That way, the person who’s trying to get in not only needs to know what the room is being used for, but also a specific word phrase to get the door to open. Can you do that?”
“Right away sir” and with a crack the elf disapparated into the house.
“What else was I supposed to do?  The look on his face when he saw the elf disappear with an armful of wallpaper as he stepped out for a cigarette.”
“How many…?”
Harry grinned. “I’ll go ask for a room.”
“I think I got pretty lucky too.  I love you.”
“Now I have your number too.”  Teddy said with a grin.  “I’ll see you around soon, okay.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I was just asking what you wanted to do now?”
“Fine” Harry replied, but he wasn’t happy.  “I’ll only try it when you think it’s safe, but on two conditions.”
“That was lovely.”  Harry said as Draco lifted his fingers off the keys with the final chord ringing out.
“All the Kings horses and all the Kings men…”  Harry muttered.  Draco looked at him confused. “Nursery rhyme.  It’s not important.  We can’t just put him together.  God knows how much stronger he’ll be with his soul intact.”
“Sorry.  Shouldn’t have doubted you.”  Draco apologised and grabbed up the book.
“You probably shouldn’t.”
“Look at the date.”  Malfoy said glaring at Harry, as if Harry was being unbelievably stupid.
“I got rather good at modifying spells in 6
The Autumn term is moving quickly for Scorpius and Lily, both happily wrapped up in their new relationship.  Then a surprise visitor arrives to potentially rock the boat.
“Lucius…”
“You’re really okay?”  Harry asked.
“Yeah mate, you’ve been married for what, 20 years now, of course you‘re going to have the odd rough patch.  Me and ‘Mione have had our fair share, but we’ve managed to get through them by talking to each other” added Ron.
“None.  The only two options seem to be Basilisk venom and Fiendfyre – and none of us are suicidal enough to try either.  We have found a spell that allows you to see path links between horcruxes.  The only problem is that it might alert the snake faced b…monster.”  Draco just about stopped himself swearing with the babies in the room – they were rapidly becoming notorious for copying every word they heard from the adults. “We think because of how fractured his soul is that won’t happen, as long as we only use the spell for the briefest time.  Just to see if there are any others.  Not to find them.”
Draco grinned as the exquisite man, who was somehow his, wriggled out of his swimming trunks and made his way over to him.
“We should probably….”  Ron was cut off by the silver bear flying to their table. “What…?!”
“You said there was an alternative to the purple one.”
“Yes.  Only okay.  I’m not happy that you kept this from me.  Not just the quitting work but that the reason you’ve nearly died so many times recently is because you decided that you knew better than our mind healer.  But okay.  I can accept what you said.  I’m still angry though.”
“Designs coats.”
“I know love.  It sucks.  But we talked about this.  And you know why it’s important to try.”  Lucius’ funeral had been arranged for the following week, and this trip was an important test run to see if Draco stood any chance of leaving the Manor to get to there.   They all knew it was possible that Draco wouldn’t make it to the funeral.  “This will be a nice fun day out with your little cousin and the two people who love you most in the world.”
“We’re going to Tescos.  Don’t you think you’re being a little…”?  Harry tried to distract Draco, but knew as soon as he’d started, all he was doing was digging himself into a hole.
“So we have to organise the funeral?”
Apparating to the Manor gates Harry felt a sense of déjà vu.  It was the same as the day before. Walking straight through the gates and up to the large house Harry’s nerves started to kick in.  Why was he doing this again, and after what had happened yesterday?    Sighing he pushed forward.  He felt obliged for some reason to return the wand, and he was also curious about that potion hat had turned Malfoy into a decidedly needy kitten.  He was greeted by the same house elf in the entrance hall.  This time rather than trying to send him away, it directed him to a room near where the potions mishap had happened.  Malfoy was sat in an armchair reading.  His long legs curled up underneath him.  He’d gotten changed out of the clothes Harry had given him that morning, and Harry had to do his best not to stare at the other man. The trousers, shirt and waistcoat, though looking decidedly less comfortable than Harry’s usual attire of jeans and t-shirt certainly looked good on Malfoy.  Harry wasn’t exactly sure why a man would wear a tie whilst lounging in their own house, it wasn’t something he himself would do, but then he wasn’t Malfoy.  Harry watched as Malfoy put down the book and uncurled himself before looking straight up at him.
Blaise looked undecided for several long moments and Draco was sure his friend was going to refuse and he’d have to somehow make his way out of here by himself.  Then Blaise looked down at him, and clearly saw something in Draco’s eyes.  The other boy sighed.  “I don’t know what you’re talking about Draco, but I’ll help if that’s what you really need.”
“Can you pack my Mother’s and little Draco’s things.  We’re leaving the Manor for the time being.  Hopefully we’ll be back in a few weeks.  Will you and the other elves be okay here?  My father should not be returning.”
“I’m Blaise Zabini.  I’m one of Harry’s friends.”  Blaise introduced himself.
Harry sniffed loudly.  He wanted to speak to Blaise; before they went to the home they’d been living in together for the last eighteen months.  He felt Blaise lift him and he wrapped his legs around his waist, his arms clinging to the other man’s neck.  They started moving towards the floo.
Astoria snorted.  “And I thank Merlin every single day that that happened.”
“Oh…”
“I don’t want to eat an olive right now okay.”
“You shouldn’t have stayed up.  I just needed to be alone.  Dumbledore is gone.”  Harry said, by way of explanation.
“I like listening to Draco play or bake.  And hearing Blaise talk about his day.  I like reading books, sometimes, and doing the crossword on Sundays with the two of them bickering about the answers.”
“Jam tarts?”  Draco asked with a grin and accepted Harry’s hand to haul him off the bed.
“I’m not.”
“I don’t know why you’re being so difficult, but I will get you to tell me eventually.”
“I wanted to talk about us, actually.”
“I know.”  Harry felt completely disheartened.  He didn’t know what he could say to make this better.  This was the entire problem with their relationship.  It worked perfectly within their little bubble, but any hint of the outside world and it cracked.
Blaise didn’t want to continue this conversation.  He was only out here because Harry was being an idiot and had managed to work himself up into a complete state.  Again.  “I need to get back to them.  I hope you enjoy your cake.”  His voice came out much harsher than he really meant.
He went back up to the tower after the call had ended, to spend some time with his Gryffindor friends, whilst Blaise and Draco did the same in Slytherin.  They all had appearances to maintain.  When he entered the tower Hermione rushed at him and apologised for not believing him when it came to his progress in occlumency.  Ron had given her a talking to.  Usually it was the other way round, so it made a change.  She then complimented him on his improved work ethic since Christmas.  They still spent a lot of time in the library, and his marks in all of his classes had improved as a consequence.  He was much more confident that he would pass his OWLs with good grades than he had been before his relationship with his two Slytherins’ had started.  The three of them had stayed up in the common room late, just talking like they used to.  Harry realised he’d probably been neglecting his two first friends with all the other commitments he had.  He just couldn’t bring himself to care enough to do anything about it.  So, that night, like every other since Christmas, he placed the mirage on his bed and snuck out to his true home in the Room of Requirement.  He thought it probably wasn’t necessary to spend every night their now, the bond never seemed to tug at them anymore in the castle, but sleeping next to the two other boys wasn’t just what he needed anymore.  It was what he wanted.
“He certainly knows how to keep you on your toes.  Just say when you need to go home.”
Narcissa was disappointed but she had accepted over the years that he and Harry weren’t going to produce any Grandchildren for her, and she doted on Teddy.
“Hermione, give it a rest.  I’m perfectly comfortable with being gay.  I came to terms with it when I decided to move in with them.  It’s not that.  I probably should have told you guys sooner, but then I would have had to explain how I knew, and that was a whole thing I didn’t want to get into.  Its…I’m living with and in love with two men.  Not just one.  And that’s all you’re getting from me.  I’m not telling you who they are.  It’s not just me that needs to keep this a secret.”
“And then what happened…?”
“You looked pretty wiped this morning in the Great Hall.”  Again, Draco was surprised.  He knew he paid what was probably too much attention to the scruffy dark-haired boy, but he didn’t for a second think it went two ways.
In the kitchen he started searching the fridge and cupboards for something to eat.  He could also do with a cup of coffee.  There was a crack behind him, and he turned to see Kreacher.
“Mmmm….” Harry can’t think much beyond the kisses and Draco’s lithe fingers, which have made their way into Harry’s joggers.  Draco’s tongue lays a trail down from Harry’s belly button, his hands easing his trousers down.  Harry gasps as he is embraced in warm wetness.
“Harry and Cussin Cake too.”
“It’s only Teddy.  And we’re going muggle, so there won’t be any wizards who might see you.  Both me and Blaise will be there, so the second you decide you can’t cope, one of us will take you home.”  Harry reassured.
“He stopped joining in with the backyard quidditch matches.” Ron said nonchalantly, as if this was something she ought to have realised too.  She was always amazed at how much better Ron’s memory than hers when it came to everyday events.
Draco wanted it.  He really wanted it.  But he knew, realistically he couldn’t.  He couldn’t allow himself to imagine a future with a miniature version of him or Harry running around.  Still, he couldn’t help the small seed of hope that had started to take root.  Before he was able to get too lost in his own head a shudder came through the wards, distracting him and effectively ending the conversation.
“Yeah, do you know if your mother ever speaks to her?”
It was a no-nonsense statement.  She wasn’t going to accept anything less than the whole truth from him.  She never did.  It was one of the reasons why he trusted her.  Trying very hard not to let fear of the truth take control, Harry took a deep breath and told Doris everything that had happened at the New Year’s party between with him and Draco, right up to Angelina catching him.
“Because we were both idiots on opposite sides of a war. That we were used to fight other people battles.  All because the grownups around us didn’t protect us.  Why the fuck should we care about any of that now?” Harry was fuming.  At Draco for giving up on them, and at the whole world for forcing them into this situation.

it is. Rivals can know someone better than friends might. We don't wear rosy glasses to color you with, yes?”
Blaise finds himself keeping notes during moments in the Great Hall or the library. Little marks under Draco's name appear for each smirk or sneer that seem to rattle Potter over dinner, in the halls, or

It's nice to feel like things are getting back to where they used to be. Should be.
Draco stares at him, not even trying to hide it as he attempts to comprehend the action and its meaning and the heat of Potter's leg to his own. And it's only with his own staring that Potter finally breaks a little, glances away and grows rosy through his cheeks, slumps in his chair and bends his knee to Draco's slightly.

Because this is about being a friend, and because no one but Lovegood's ever even considered that Draco's held a torch for the Gryffindor.
Near one-thirty in the morning, Malfoy's little feet begin to move in the dorms on the Map. Harry quickly spells it shut and tucks it away under the cloak, holding his breath with anticipation.

Like every prior instance of it happening, Draco feels the heat sizzle between them, and some part of his mind wonders how
he'd caught Potter doing it. He'd been curious, naturally, as to if that was just a random coincidence at first, but when Potter followed Draco three times after that, Blaise could confidently pat his own shoulder in a job well done.
Draco waits with a cocked brow, taking another sip. “So, what is it? What's got you so caught up in your head that you can't pretend like me, for instance, that you want to still be here and dance and partake in wedded mirth with the couple?”
Merlin, how embarrassing.

He watches Malfoy's little feet strutting through the dungeons toward the dorms just like they have the last few times he's done this private investigation, and when Malfoy reaches a certain point between the dorms and Snape's old rooms, his feet vanish right off the Map.
Harry Potter, of course, is glaring at him with his sharp green eyes.
“Yeah.” Potter licks his lower lip, and Draco grows paranoid, forcing his eyes up away from the action to keep his fucking cock calm. “Did you fancy anyone back in school, then?”
Because some part of Harry Potter's heart honestly doesn't believe it's something

“Why, Potter?” Draco questions, entirely skeptical even as his heart races with excitement.
Draco reclines his head as much as possible and lets his fingers trace Potter's bicep down to his wrist of the free hand resting on his thigh. “Yes,” he breathes out with a sigh.
Draco closes his eyes again. “I don't know, Potter. It's all so...difficult.”
By day he stares at Malfoy across the Great Hall, ignoring the demands from Ron and Hermione as to what the bloody hell is going on with him. By afternoons he walks by Malfoy's side, feeling excitement in the new little routine and magically enhanced somehow in confidence as everyone stares at them. Twice a week he still plays footsie under the table, grinning to himself when he slides into his chair and Malfoy's already got the tip of his foot around Harry's ankle and rubbing it.
Harry gasps, his free hand gripping Draco's hair as well, and the bottle gets dropped between the chairs so Harry's arms can go around him tightly.
They're both up to something. He just knows it.
But Malfoy slowly turns, Harry feels him revolve, and then long fingers reach right over his face, grab the cloak, and yank it down.
Potter
Harry's getting exhausted from waking to run to the bathroom and deal with the results of such dreams, shocked the first time he touches himself and whispers Malfoy's name, lost to the sensations that arise from the combination and have him coming and hissing through his clenched teeth.
“Volunteers? Come now, your section is very engaging at times. Ms. Parkinson, would you care to try the special leaves?”
Fucking close. Too fucking close.
Potter's loud gasp in the hall behind him makes the entire morning and anything yet to come worth it while Draco sighs to himself, striding happily away with his robes thankfully covering the awareness of just
“Mine,” Draco murmurs instinctively, nails scratching over the muscle there as he feels the heart pounding against his fingers.

, putting out the light. He leans back until he can sit down on the little bench that he's spent so much time in here upon, touching himself to thoughts of the person right before him now, and Draco smiles in the dark when he feels Potter bend down to kneel between his legs, warm palms spreading themselves over Draco's thighs.
The whimper below him is hot, and Draco strokes him well, almost breaking his concentration and desire to go
It's Draco's turn to fidget, and he does so while staring at that moon. “So.”

“What's wrong?” he asks, never afraid of the directness.
He carefully adjusts, pretending to be bored, and makes sure his robes cover his front where he's possibly visible and panicking over it.
It almost sounds like relief, and to Draco's drunken mind, it sounds more like
So what the fuck could it be that
Draco rolls his eyes, still feeling the heat in his cheeks, and he can't help but wonder for a single moment just what Potter's cup might tell him. Despite its chances being utter shit at likely being real, it is still a strangely melancholic thought to imagine some girl in Potter's future, and his face falls slightly.
“You...! I
He'd also waited, laughing to himself, as Draco had emerged that first day after using the alcove, looking entirely embarrassed but also
“I haven't...haven't seen

Because it would be disastrous for himself and these stupid feelings inside of him to walk out of the room thinking Potter was

“Let's not go there right now,” Draco advises, knuckles tapping the glass Potter lazily holds still. “Bad road to take, Potter.”
Draco shifts for a moment, and then there's a soft light again from the tip of that wand Harry knows so well, and Harry stares upward. He sees the grey eyes become gentle and anxious and then grow bold like he loves before they
“Shut
there, sticks the tip of his tongue out and grabs the bottle again as he bluffs Potter. “Don't look at me like that. You know what the fuck I meant.”
“Yep.”
trust me.”
When Malfoy suddenly changes direction far ahead, breaking off from the small group he'd been walking with and going elsewhere alone, Harry grunts in annoyance. If he follows now, people will notice what he's doing. After all, there's no reason for him to head towards the Slytherin dorms.
But not now. Not when he's been burning in a unique way when he's caught those grey eyes staring at him softly while no one else is paying any attention.
Hermione would call it his ridiculous bravery making him play footsie with
“Friendships, perceptions, all of it backfiring possibly...awkwardness would abound, wouldn't it?”
Potter grins and takes it from him, downing his own coughing gasp even as he sighs in appreciation for the prized liquor. Draco receives it back when the bottle is held out again, and he settles against his chair, long legs crossing at the bottom.
When he leaves class this time, debating if he should even try for the alcove for his slotted appointment at all now, he hears the steps behind him, muffled, but firmly following.
“Nothing. Nothing is why you're sitting out here alone.”
Draco goes pale and then red. Very, very red. Redder than before when Blaise was such a shit.
“So, what is it?” Draco asks eyeballing the hollow space with its built in bench.
The rest of the guests continue dancing and laughing mutely behind them, and Draco blinks rapidly, trying to deal with a drunken body and a brain struggling to be rapidly sober in its shock all while Potter grows to fidget beside him uncomfortably.
The smile eases his panic, though his nerves still dance, and Draco takes what air he can get. “Harry?”

He sees the flowers in front of him on the balcony wall and groans. “Oh,

does. It's as if the bloody rooms have gone up another few degrees of temperature already, and Draco holds his sneer perfectly, bouncing his brows up and down twice until Potter gets a shoulder jerk from Weasley, who merely scowls towards the Slytherins.
Potter's mouth leaves his to travel down his neck, sucking and licking, and Draco gasps, slides his fingers inside Potter's thin shirt to touch hot skin, digs them into a muscled back.
Potter shoots him a tight little glare, and it almost makes Draco reminisce. “Because, Malfoy. I have reasons. Anyway, what about
Harry is about to snap as a result.
He huffs and looks away, then lifts the pot and pours the tea. One sniff tells him it's nasty stuff, and Draco scrunches his face, but takes a sip and then another. His eyes close as he decides to ignore the rest of the room, and he actually finds himself doing as the professor suggests without meaning to do so as the magic of the tea works: Draco tunes everyone out for a moment and just imagines himself in a vastness of space and time, and something inside of him reaches out, feeling a pulse. He grabs it in his mind, pulling it like a string, fascinated by the warmth and humored loving feeling it gives off.
A cool palm takes hold of heat between his legs that starts to harden more.

. Harry kisses him enough to distract the gorgeous snake, and when Draco starts to let go of him to hold his face and deepen the kiss, Harry smirks and backs away, bending lower to kiss a path across Draco's throat to the open buttons of his shirt.
The final match is approaching.
And Draco's heart pounds as they sit there for another almost forty minutes, silent, yet talking loads with their legs and feet constantly rubbing one another.
But the melancholy hits again, stealing the smile away.
personality. But you must be careful, Mr. Malfoy. Lightning is as destructive as it is empowering. Be cautious with your love, but unafraid. Embrace their wildness and enfold yourself into their energy with trust,” Trelawney predicts across from him, sitting his cup down and clapping her hands. “Another volunteer?”
For a moment his entire face reddens; he can feel every bit of his skin flush, can feel his mouth open in shock and his eyes widen in panic that the very deep, worrisome thoughts he's been having manifest into his dreams lately about Potter have somehow made themselves known.
Draco nods as he tips his glass back, finishing the last sampling of wine he wanted to try. The party breaks up for dancing, and grey eyes cleverly follow the dark head as it weaves through, only stopping to briefly twirl Molly Weasley about for a moment before it heads outside onto the balcony.
“Oh?”
“I’m staying here.”  Blaise said, sounding almost as stubborn as Harry did when he got in a snit.
“I just…”  Harry could hear in Draco’s voice that he was trying to hold back tears.  He sat up and pulled Draco into a tight hug.  The next words were muffled against Harry’s shoulder, but Harry thought he could make them out.  “I was scared.  I was so scared.”
When Kingsley handed Harry the sealed letter, and he knew he wouldn’t be taking it to the post room.  This letter wouldn’t turn up at the Manor with some random owl, impersonally informing Draco that he was finally a free man.
“Yes.”
“Hello, to you too.”  Blaise replied and stepped forward, dumping the bag he was holding on the counter and leaning in, to kiss Harry and Draco in turn.  “You look much better, love.  Your work I assume, Draco.”
That was the last thing he wanted.  Not that they could investigate anyway.
“And who’s that and what do we do if that happens?”
“I’m not planning on abandoning you.  Certainly not because of the rubbish the Prophet writes, or because of what a bunch of strangers think about the two of us being together.  They don’t have any right over how we live our lives.  And as for Lily and Scorpius, I don’t think you’re doing too badly.  No worse than I am.”
“Hey.  You got there.  No point going on about what ifs.  And Harry?”
“I know I do… I just…”
“And you won’t leave.”
“Harry! Why didn’t you tell us? Didn’t you think we’d be happy you’ve found someone.  No one’s upset about the fact that you and Ginny aren’t together anymore.”  Hermione sounded over the moon at the prospect of him finding someone.  Then she had been going on about him getting back out there and meeting someone for a while.
“Sure, sure, Draco, whatever you say.” Blaise replied, with a dismissive wave of his hand.  “Are you two just going to stand around here all day or are you going to come in and have some food.  Your mother’s here and waiting in the morning room.”
“If Harry told Malfoy to write to us, and there is no way that he didn’t – Malfoy wouldn’t have done this by himself, it must really be important.  It doesn’t tell us exactly what they think is so big they think that we need warning, but I’m fairly certain we can safely assume the public is soon going to know about their relationship.”
Harry pulled a stool out for him and he sat.  Harry did the same next to him. The smell of the fish and chips was almost overwhelming.  They were still hot, and Harry was eating them straight from the bag.
Harry winced.  Draco seeing him and Ginny touching like that.  In public. Like they never could.  Of course it hurt him.
“My appointment next week is at 3pm.  I will meet you here at 2pm.  Just you, I’m not dealing with an irate Ron as well.”
‘Fidelus?’
Draco wasn’t sure whether he had had four or five cocktails before he finally dragged Pansy into a taxi.  He manged to bundle her in and send her off to Charing Cross road and therefore safe into the Leaky Cauldron not long before midnight.  He knew that was usually where she ended up staying when she got drunk out in London.  They rarely drank in any of the wizarding pubs around Diagon Alley.  They’d not been welcome for the first few years after the war and the stares used to trigger awful panic attacks for him. Although the stares had stopped and nobody would say anything now, they had gotten into the habit of using the bars and pubs in the rest of London, sometimes branching out to the Southbank, but mostly sticking to Soho and the West End.  It particularly pleased him when he was younger to think of the expression on his father’s face if he knew his pure blood son, was drinking in muggle clubs and grinding up against a variety of muggle men.  Draco got on the tube and sat on the Piccadilly line till he reached Kings Cross.  There was train in about 15 minutes that would get him back to Wiltshire from platform 4
“Harry.  Why in the hell did you do that?”  Draco snapped at him.
“But what Lily?” Hugo’s voice was gentle and soothing as he said this.
“Urrhh… Yeah… Thanks… Look, I mean it about having you guys over.  I know he’s got some super weird complex about letting people know about you, but… He’s my best friend.  I just want him to be happy.”
“Not really sure.  When we got in the bathroom, the shower we saw earlier had disappeared and this giant bath was here.  Now join us, Zabini.”  Harry said, the conspiratorial look was back.  Harry was definitely hiding something.
“I don’t think you can, but you have to do it.  Don’t tell her you were with some girl last night though, that would be cruel.  But you do have to tell her you don’t want a relationship with her.  You’ll both be better off in the long run than if you keep avoiding her.  Or maybe you could just set the kitten on her to scare her off.”
“I’m scared.”
“Scorpius.  I know I have a tendency to bottle things up too.  I have tried to hide it from you as much as I could over the years, but I know you’ve seen some of it.  You know I see a therapist.  You’ve seen one too in the past.  You know it helps and I don’t like how much your resisting it now.  But, persuading you to talk about your feelings isn’t exactly why we wanted to talk to the two of you today.  We actually had a proposition for both of you.” Draco said, and Harry was so proud of him for opening up to his son, even in this small way, about his struggles.  It was something they’d discussed with Doris together.  Being less closed off about their emotions with the people they cared about.
Both Harry and Draco knew that Draco was being more than a little irrational about this.  But it was one of Draco’s little quirks that he always had to be impeccably dressed when he left the house.  Even if was just to go to the supermarket.
“Snape said not.  In fact he called me an imbecile with no brains or common sense for even considering it. He really doesn’t like me.  He did let me know that Voldemort is now aware of the connection and may use it to try and get to me somehow, so that’s great.”
At that moment, Al’s Dad walked through the door and nearly bumped straight into his Father who was stood impatiently, looking reproachfully at the two boys.
Someone wrapped their arms around him up and they felt warm and comforting, but they weren’t they right person.  Harry felt tears starting to prickle in his eyes.
“Here Miss Potter, do you want to take her?”
“Come on, one drink will be fine.”
“Have you been keeping something from me?”  She asked her husband.
“That’s great news.  I can see your cousin has taken to you.”
“Neither do I.  But we decided running wasn’t the solution this time.  However much I want to go home, we made the choice to stick this out, and it’s the right thing to do.  For both of us.”
“No.” Harry admitted sheepishly.
“Aristocats?”  Draco asked.
Its 6 months later and Draco's wedding is rapidly approaching
“It is amazing.”  Harry replied, still maintaining a calm exterior, despite the rising panic he felt.  “It’s a little cold to be outside though.  Why don’t you come in and tell me everything they’ve been saying?”
Draco snorted at that before moving back to the more serious topic. “We are going to have to tell the kids about this.  I have no idea how their going to take it.  If it wasn’t for the Scorpius and Lily situation, I wouldn’t have been too worried.  But it’s going to be seriously weird for them.  Even if they weren’t having a baby it would be seriously weird for them to have their respective parents dating.”
“I can see she’s a good friend.”
“You were definitely irritating.  You managed to irritate two of my friends quite significantly in relatively short interactions, I’ll have you know.  You’re dislike for things Weasley seemed to stick around in your smaller, fluffier form.”
“His maturity probably stagnated at the age he currently is.  And I do have another reason for going with the Black naming tradition, but it’s a fairly horrible idea and I want to discuss it with Mother first.”
“Pans, we don’t talk about that.  And anyway, last night he didn’t do anything wrong.  Well nothing that wasn’t at least partially my fault.  I turned up at his New Year’s party.  Therapist thought it might be a good idea to try talking to him, and Scorpius was there, so I thought I could make up some excuse for being there that involved seeing him.”

But he does know it has to indicate a hell of a final match is coming soon, and he, for one, can't wait for it to be over, preferably with the two bastards off somewhere alone and keeping their nonsense out of his damn face the rest of the year.

Draco moans, and the sound nearly
it in his ears.
“Can you deal with his effects long enough if we just move the time down an hour or two?” he offers, hoping that might be enough to throw Potter off sniffing after Draco until he can discern Potter's real motivation.
When he backs away for the alcove to cover again, Malfoy panics and tries to stand, nearly bashing his skull against the small space. “Wait! What are you doing, you prick? You can't just wall me up in here!”
He blows his dark, unruly hair from his glasses and stares off, thinking of how tall Malfoy is and how shiny his pale hair is and how nice he looks in his robes.
It's agitating his waking mind and doing weird things to his constantly racing heart.
Draco's eyes narrow upon his parchment as he thinks about the timing of it all, about possible motives each idiot might have.
Blaise grins and gives him a shove, laughing as Malfoy tumbles inside and catches himself against the wall with a hot glare. “It's for

And then he hears something that changes the nature of his game entirely.

“Look, I just work the books, Draco. It's nothing personal.” Blaise exhales. “Someone else has asked for it. He's not been able to make his earlier times lately, and your slot happens to work a lot better. You can move yours a day, can't you?”
A simple bittersweet, pleasant summer morning's dew
When Potter stops kissing him and sounds off a little bit of displeasure in his throat, Draco sighs and pulls his wand from his pocket, calling a soft
The smile that crosses Harry's lips is dazzling. Blinding. And it holds Draco's gaze without any mercy, refusing to let him look away.

expression, sees Draco's eyes widen dramatically, and steps forward long enough to add as the spell begins to take effect on the wall, “I imagine it'll be over quick if you think about Potter. Don't forget to clean up.”
Draco flushes and eyes his nails distractedly.
“You love him,” Harry infers, just as softly.
!” Malfoy almost cheers him on with racing, breathy words. “So
Draco glares back, smirking as Potter turns it into a staring contest.
The old sense of nagging curiosity stirs in him, and Harry quickly folds the parchment back into his robes and decides to take a fucking stroll to the library, too.
“I’m to bind you too me to ensure you don’t try anything stupid.  If you try to move more than three steps from me, you’ll find yourself writhing in agony on the floor and quickly locked away again.”  To the other guards his words would sound like a threat.  Harry knew that Draco would understand that it was a message.  To stay close to him.  The bond between them all but prevented doing anything that would cause physical pain to the other, and certainly wouldn’t allow the tethering charm to be effective.
“I wanted it to be you.”  He tried to insist, knowing it was futile.
“So maybe they tried to end it after Harry got married.”
“That would be perfect Harry,” Angelina looked relieved, “I’d almost forgotten you had some experience at this”
Gossiping with Pansy and another trip down memory lane
The elf disappeared and was back in a second with two glasses full of amber liquid.
“At the raid.”
“I don’t know.” Malfoy looked thoughtful.  “If it was completely off and just turned everyone into kittens that would be one thing, but this is close.  I think I should be able to tweak it so that the person at least gets to keep their memories, but I’m not sure what good that would do.  I don’t think I can make it work like I wanted to.”
“Draco are you there…?”
“You’re dodging my questions, Harry.”
Harry leant around Draco to give Blaise a kiss, then stood up.
“Blaise.  You holding Draco’s hand feels nice.  If he didn’t want to do it, then it would be making at least one, if not both, of us feel ill.”  Harry answered.
It was pouring with rain the day he made his way to her office.  His mood, that already wasn’t brilliant that morning, was further depressed by the prospect of getting cold and wet walking through London.  In an attempt to minimise his exposure to the weather, rather than apparating into one of the wizarding areas nearby, he apparated straight into Bloomsbury, aiming for one of the alleys opposite the hospital.  The alley he apparated into was empty as he cracked into the space under a disillusionment charm.  He was lucky and there were no smokers there to disturb.  The weather had obviously dissuaded them from that particular habit.  Removing the charm, he exited the alley and walked across the street into the hospital.  Even the short walk had soaked Draco through to his underwear.  He hated the feeling of wet socks in his shoes.  Draco was already starting to feel like the day was against him.  To sour things further it took nearly a quarter of an hour before the 3
It's highly amusing to see all the questions in Granger's and Weasley's matching faces when they encounter he and Potter side by side, not speaking at all but always looking at one another as if conversing in an entirely different way only they could understand.
Such thoughts nag Blaise as he sleeps and bat at him through class the next day, and he decides, silently, to perhaps just let things be. Blaise doesn't want to see Draco break, but his friend
