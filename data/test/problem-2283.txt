I try to stay composed so I can gather all the facts, but even to someone who’s known Draco for such a long time this news is entirely unexpected.  “How would the two of you define your relationship?”
“It’s not my responsibility to make this easier for you,” Draco said, entirely reasonably. “You were one hundred percent in the wrong and I am still waiting to hear a proper apology, and preferably a valid reason why you acted like the world’s biggest twat.”
Draco threw his hands in the air.  “Okay, fine, a bit of both. I don’t like when she marches into this house as if she owns the place saying she’s ‘just popping in for chat’ and then kicks me off my spot on the settee for hours, and I certainly don’t like how much anxiety she gives you just by showing up, but that’s hardly grounds for a smear campaign.”
“The hospital houses many patients suffering from the long-term effects of spell damage and other maladies, especially in the aftermath of the Second Wizarding War, and our Healers have long asserted that many of those would make better progress outside a strictly clinical setting.
Harry wasn’t surprised that no one argued with her, and he didn’t have the energy to fight his corner against all three of them.  “Well?” he asked, “What should I do next?”
“First, this is a huge undertaking, and to get it finished on schedule means working ridiculous hours. That not only means I’m likely to be in a foul mood, but also that your sleep will be disturbed, which is unfair given how busy your job is at the moment.   Second, if you’re here while I’m getting it ready then you’ll ruin the surprise.”
I’ll try and drop by if I get these mood boards done - I would love to gouge my eyes out to avoid all this hideous fabric but will try to hold off so I can critique some fashion faux-pas for Lisa.  The sacrifices I make for you people are immeasurable.
I ponder my findings as I descend the stairs, ready to interview Potter.  While the decor is remarkable, more interesting to me, and to
“Still, I know that when she was young my mother loved visiting her cousins at that house. You’ve probably earned a few favours, so yes, I will help you. Where would you like to start?”
“A bloody nightmare is how he is,” Ron added.  “I put some Quidditch magazines in there for safekeeping and he tore them up and put the pieces in a giant pile on the middle of the bed, just to mock me.”
She stared at him, clearly trying not to cry, and he felt awful that one of the toughest people he knew had been reduced to tears by his words.
recent stories, including his former girlfriend Ginny Weasley’s whirlwind romance with her Quidditch coach and his friend Hermione Granger’s (suspiciously rapid) rise to power within the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.  I was keen to give him a chance to go on the record and give our readers some exclusive insights into his home life.
Malfoy’s glare deepened.  “You were made to be an Auror, you know.  The rest of the population would say it’s too early for you to be questioning me like this.”
Draco, infuriatingly, just raised an eyebrow.  “I assume you’re here to beg me for forgiveness.  With lavish gifts.”
A few hours and an ill-advised amount of champagne later, Harry found the courage to catch Malfoy alone.  “So, um, I was wondering if you could do me a favour,” he started, before he could chicken out.  As soon as the words were out of his mouth he regretted them, especially as Malfoy’s lip curled in a familiar disdainful gesture.
“If you die of starvation while making me a dining set I’ll never live it down.  Not to mention that I still need you alive to tackle the rest of the house. Get your stuff and meet me outside in ten minutes.”
Draco lay down, still smiling, and stretched like a satisfied cat.  “I think I left my wand downstairs,” he said eventually, gesturing between the two of them  “Do you mind?”
“When I asked him to move in, I really didn’t expect us to get along this well,” Potter tells me. “I just thought it was ridiculous that he was travelling to and from his mum’s every day when I had so many spare rooms so close to his work.  But I’ve got to say, it’s worked out brilliantly.”
The two of them would have laughed at that image once.  Now Harry didn’t know how to respond.  He stood awkwardly, hands in his pockets, trying to bring himself to look Draco in the eye.
In an unexpected twist at the Wizengamot today, victims who were detained and tortured at Malfoy Manor spoke out in favour of leniency at the trial of young defendant Draco Malfoy.
“I told you we should have put some jinxes on the stairs,” Potter tells Draco.  I remind them that I can (and probably will!) print everything they say.
“I think it’s a very kind gesture,” Hermione said, “I can’t imagine how exhausting it is to commute all the way from Bordeaux.  Remember when I went to Belgium for the Summit on Werewolf Migration?” Ron rolled his eyes at Harry; they’d heard about the conference at great length. “We used the Floos to visit some of the settlements over the German border, and even that felt like being stretched too thin.”
Harry let Draco push him back onto the bed and climb on top of him, and this was far, far better than before, feeling the weight of Draco’s whole body pressed against him, but it still wasn’t enough.  He started trying to open Draco’s shirt, but the tosser always wore these expensive faerie-made things with stupidly tiny buttons.
Harry Potter’s evidence during the trial itself may also have come into play.  On the record, he gave damning testimony about Malfoy’s role in the prior invasion of Hogwarts, but also claimed, “When [Hermione Granger, Ronald Weasley and I] were brought into Malfoy Manor, he refused to identify us to his father, to save us from being handed over to [You-Know-Who].  The whole time we were there, he was completely terrified.”  When questioned about Malfoy’s role in the Battle of Hogwarts, Potter stated, “Malfoy was clearly hiding from the whole thing...he even told his friends not to kill me.  He may have said it was because [You-Know-Who] didn’t want me dead, but it was clear to me that he was in over his head from the beginning and wanted no part of it.”
It had to mean something, though, that every fibre of his being would much rather spend the evening getting slightly pissed and listening to Draco Malfoy’s commentary on Muggle cinema.
When the Wizengamot handed down the sentence, representative Elphias Doge stated, “While we cannot deny that Malfoy made the choice to become a Death Eater and follow in his father’s footsteps, it is clear that the full implications of this decision were beyond his understanding as he was not yet of age.  Indeed, many adult wizards might well have acted in the same way, had they been threatened with torture by He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.  We must not take Malfoy’s actions lightly, especially as there is no dispute that he gave Death Eaters access to Hogwarts School, but we must also remember that he is still very young.  To sentence him to Azkaban would be to remove any opportunity for rehabilitation.”
“I think part of you is very uncomfortable with him knowing you so well, Harry,” Luna stated matter-of-factly, stirring her tea precisely seventeen and a half times.  “I don’t think you were cross with him about
“I’d much rather keep my hair back while I’m doing that, you know,” Draco said with no real reproach.  He pulled off his own underwear, and Harry took a moment to admire the view before tugging Draco back down on top of him so they were pressed together, skin on skin, from head to toe, and this was what Harry wanted, not quite as good as Draco’s mouth - how could it be, really? - but amazing in its own right; every inch of him against every inch of Draco, perfectly matched.
P.P.S. You do not have five million bedrooms; you have eight.  If I can renovate a sprawling mansion with multiple whole wings (not to mention the grounds), you can sort out the Black house without unnecessary hyperbole.
“Impossible, when she gets going.” Ron was gazing at Hermione fondly. “Why don’t you just ask Malfoy to stop winding her up?”
“No one answers.  We go in, super cautious - the guy may have owled us but there’s still some dodgy shit going on down in Knockturn.  Harry’s all, ‘Aurors, come out with your wand in the air!’  The whole place is dark and covered in dust sheets, really suspicious, like.  Then suddenly there’s this scream like a banshee, and this thing falls on Harry, like out of nowhere.  When the lights finally come on,  Harry’s lying in the middle of the floor with this massive Kneazle sitting on his chest, and he’s covered in bright green paint!
Harry felt as if his heart were going to beat its way right out of his chest.  Somehow it was different to hear the words themselves, even though Draco had already sort of told him.
The smile vanished from Malfoy’s face.  “Unfortunately, yes.  Something from that experience has turned out positive, at least.”
“Perhaps - but Luna has a point,” Hermione agreed.  “Maybe it would have been better if you’d showed up at his mother’s house yourself with the chocolates.  He’d probably find some satisfaction in the extra mile you went to see him at - how did his design brochure describe it? - ‘an unplottable hideaway in the heart of French wine country’.”
Harry was torn, as he pulled Draco back down, between wanting to get his hands and lips on every inch of skin and the need to look into Draco’s eyes, kiss his lips, reaffirm that this was actually happening between them; and every time they made eye contact, Draco was smiling that rare, fond, beautiful smile.
There is a traditional, somewhat archaic, pureblood hierarchy of guest rooms, with which I doubt you’re acquainted. It’s less clear in Muggle-built houses like yours, but it can be helpful to know where to start, and which floors are likely to house which visitors.  Dare I ask which room you’ve selected for yourself, and how you’re getting on with that?  Or are you sleeping in the drawing room, as you reportedly did during the war, and avoiding dealing with the bedrooms entirely?
bad a job,” he replied, unconvincingly.  “Besides, that’s why they pay me all those tons of Galleons.  I can take any client’s wishes, even if they are for red and gold, and make them into something spectacular.”
Ollivander stated, “I can tell when a wand and its user are reluctant, and every harmful spell cast on us by Malfoy was done under duress.”
“Don’t worry,” Harry interjected quickly, glaring at Draco for springing this on them.  “I can just sleep in a different room.”
“Oh, mate, it was hilarious,” Jasper began, “we were all called out on a bust at some antique dealer’s in Knockturn.  Someone owled to report a shoplifter and they sent a squad of us, just in case we could nab the owner for dealing in contraband at the same time.  So we all show up, and there’s Harry, at the front, because he can’t help himself.  He knocks on the door, all serious-like, and Ron and Terry go round the back alley just in case.
Harry was unintimidated, and passed the bag of pastries over by way of an apology.  “Yeah, okay, that too.  My shift starts in half an hour and you said you’d have the kitchen and dining room stuff ready today, so I thought I’d see if you were in.  I’m on patrol so I’ll be knackered by the time I’m done.  You did sleep here, didn’t you.”  It wasn’t a question: Harry could see pillows piled onto a sofa in the corner, and Malfoy’s shirt was crying out for one of Molly Weasley’s extra-strong ironing charms.
“It’s brilliant,” he said eventually.  “Really, I don’t have the words… I knew you were good but this is… how did you know exactly what I wanted when I did such a rubbish job of explaining it to you?”
Harry sipped his wine and stared at the door.  He knew Draco was right about Ginny - and so were Hermione, and the guys from work, and Pansy sodding Parkinson… even Ron, though he only spoke up when his sister had particularly annoyed him - but he wasn’t ready to admit it to himself.  He’d loved her so much, back then, and he
“Potter,” Draco said coldly, standing up so they were eye-to-eye, “Go fuck yourself.”  He walked over to the fireplace, took a pinch of Floo powder, and stepped into the flames, heading for his mother’s house.  Every movement felt like a punch in the gut to Harry, and the worst thing was that he absolutely deserved it.
Ron jumped - Harry thought Hermione must have kicked him under the table.  “Well, you definitely won’t be getting back together if you’ve got him skulking around.”
P.S. If you are doing that, please don’t tell me. If you’ve faced the Dark Lord but can’t face a townhouse you should be retroactively sorted into Hufflepuff.
“Whatever you say, mate. He’ll always be Ferret Face to me,” Ron replied. “Now, can we go and find that buffet?”
Malfoy waved his wand and a box flew over to land - unnecessarily heavily - in Harry’s lap.  When he opened it, he saw a stack of incredibly detailed miniature dining tables, each one not only a different type of wood, but different in style and detail, right down to the tiny carvings.  He picked up a particularly intricate example and held it up to the light.  “Bloody hell, Malfoy.  These are incredible.”
, our source claimed, “Harry and Ginny have been friends for a long time, and Ginny still dreams of them spending the rest of their lives together.  She’s been making a real effort; going to visit him as often as possible with their packed schedules, and even giving him a season ticket to her games.”  They went on to allege, “Ginny’s been so intent on getting him back on the same page that she’s been bringing love potions with her on their dates in the hopes of slipping some into his drink.  She thinks a few sips will help him remember just how great they are together, and their genuine love and connection will take it from there.”
He was getting close again now, and he wanted Draco right there with him, so he reached one hand down between them and curled it around Draco’s dick. The angle was awkward, and Harry was vaguely aware that he had no idea what was doing, but he didn’t let that bother him as he followed his instincts, touching Draco as he would himself, and he was rewarded with gasps and a litany of, “Please, please, please...”
Luna smiled indulgently at them, then turned back to the painting, tilting her head.  “It looks like you, Harry.”
‘Rear of the Year’ in action in those shorts. Did they come from the Aurors’ clothing supply or a prep school’s spare games kit?”
P.S. I received forty equally hideous samples of brocade for the Clearwaters’ front room today.  My eyes are bleeding.
Eventually, Malfoy lowered the chair down onto the ground and cast some protective spells before banishing it gently into a corner.
Before Draco could reply, Sapphy appeared with a crack.  Harry never would have pictured himself as a dinner party person, but with her as guest-chef and dining tables that felt a bit too big with just two of them, he actually didn’t mind hosting every now and again.  Draco had to stay well away from the kitchen, though: his last and only attempt to cook something more elaborate than a stir fry ended when he launched a tray of potatoes across the room at Harry, yelling, “This is nothing like Potions, you absolute bastard!”
“Work smart, not hard, Granger,” Draco said smugly.  “I just tore out that part of the wall and had it replaced.  Great Aunt Walberga’s sitting in Gringotts with some of the portraits from the Manor, probably having a lovely time.”
It is reported that when the transfer is final, Draco and Narcissa Malfoy will relocate to one of the family’s numerous properties in France, though rumour has it Draco has also purchased premises on Laburnum Way, from which he intends to run his up-and-coming interior design business. The formerly notorious thoroughfare just east of Diagon Alley has become a hub for magical artisans in recent years, housing, among others,
Harry knew he could capitalise on this.  “Yeah, actually.  Maybe I’ll tell you about it if you give me a hand with the house in London I inherited.”
Oh thank goodness, I need all the help I can get.  I can do Thursday after work if that’s okay?  Should I bring flowers or something for your mum?
Luckily for our readers, as you’ve doubtless seen on this week’s cover, the inimitable Derek returned from the master bedroom just in time to capture this tender moment.
“I know you love yourself,” Harry replied automatically, trying to adjust his pillows without dislodging Draco, who had made himself comfortable against Harry’s side, as if he were exactly where he belonged.
“That was the point, Weasley,” Draco said, smugness radiating from him as he stood at the end of the hall and watched Harry usher his friends in.
Harry brushed his hair back and sighed.  He felt as if they had the same conversation every time he saw Ginny.  “I know you don’t get it, but it feels like the right thing to do.  Yes, maybe part of her does want us to get back together, but I can’t just refuse to see her.  We’ve been friends for a really long time.”
Harry should have known this was a bad idea: it was usually better to ask forgiveness than permission with Ron.  All he had to do was buy a round at the pub and do a bit of Ron’s paperwork for him, and even breaking up with Ginny was forgiven, if not forgotten.  “You’ve been loads of help, thanks.”
Harry wasn’t really paying attention to the rest of the table, though, because now Draco was focused entirely on him, his gaze flicking down to Harry’s lips, and how they had thought they could keep this to themselves for even a few hours was beyond him.
“St Mungo’s firmly believes that this transition will be of tremendous benefit to a large number of patients, and we are grateful for the Malfoy family’s overwhelming cooperation and support.”
contains twenty-six pages of high-quality images of the home, and there is very little my descriptions can do to reflect Draco’s extraordinary success in creating a space that is functional yet elegant, comfortable yet refined. It speaks to Draco’s ability to work with difficult clients that the house manages to retain the spirit of Potter’s notoriously relaxed style but also reflects Draco’s own, more elevated aesthetic.
“Well, I do, you know.”  Draco brushed back a lock of Harry’s hair, which promptly flopped back over his face.
“Harry, do shut up, please.”  Draco must have got closer while Harry was talking - well, babbling - and he put his hands on Harry’s arms, holding him in place, while he looked him in the eye and asked slowly.  “Are you trying to tell me that under that brown paper is an original work by Georgianna Moonstone?”
“I was going to, but by the time I’d gone and found a sodding box the damage was already done.  Can’t have been more than ten minutes.  All four parts of the Cannons Spotlight Special, shredded into tiny pieces,” he said sadly.
He was relieved, yes, but the adrenaline rush of finally saying the words, finally standing up for what he wanted - or didn’t want - wore off quickly and he just felt empty.  Tired, drained, sad that someone so important to him for so long had drifted so far away.
Draco tightened his grip on Harry for a moment.  “I must admit that I’m impressed,” he murmured eventually.  “I was a little afraid I’d have to spend most of tonight nursing you through some kind of sexual identity crisis.”
“Nice?” Draco replied, with barely concealed irritation. “It’s beyond nice.  It’s a masterpiece.  It’s possibly one of Moonstone’s greatest artistic accomplishments to date.”
Harry’s team laughed uproariously, and Harry tried to keep his face firmly planted on the table until they’d stopped talking about it.  He chanced a glance up at Draco, who was clearly trying to find a balance between wanting to laugh at Harry’s expense and wanting to be on his side. The traitor chose the first option, but not before passing a pint Harry’s way.
“A favour.”  Perhaps it wasn’t disdain?  Amusement, maybe? Harry had rarely - if ever - seen Malfoy amused when it wasn’t at his expense; maybe that was just what his face did.
While some rumours are quick to put this hope to bed, claiming Potter has moved on with various lovely ladies (see
are so desperate to see where I live.  Wasn’t chasing me round to get a picture of my arse for ‘Rear of the Year’ intrusive enough for them?!  I’m not crazy about the thought, to be honest, especially if she wants to get into my bedroom: the letters from crazy fans are inventive enough without them knowing what colour my sheets are.
“I assume you have no clue, and since I’m stuck here for a little while longer, why don’t you just send me an owl with any questions you have, and when I’m free to leave I’ll come round and tackle the big decisions?”
I was lucky enough to get a look inside the Manor before its official unveiling, and I must say the results are breathtaking.  Gone are the intimidating heavy hardwoods and walls of portraits. Instead, we have brighter wallpapers and large-scale art pieces: in fact, all the previously dark spaces are now flooded with light, which is not only a strong political statement but also a strong aesthetic.
“It wasn’t him,” Dudley’s voice was barley heard and his mother’s eyes snapped to him.  Her face become paler at what he just said.
He looked at the sign again, its words still written boldly across the wood.  He lent down and picked up one of the knives.
Now here they were, Harry splayed out on the living room floor, staring wide-eyed at his uncle.  The purple faced man was waving around his thick belt, bringing it too close to the Harry than either child was comfortable with.  Harry could already feel the throb of a welt across his back from being hit previously.
Considering it was high in the back, she would have to go around because she would fit though the space like they did.
“I always wanted to try cooking.” the silence broke with that almost whispered confession, “but mom always said that I could hurt myself so I should just make you do it.”
“Believe me Dudley, I’m as confused as you are!” Harry defended himself, putting his hands up in a placating gesture, “but this was where it brought me, and it’s never been wrong before!”
“Come back here!” her voice was shriller, if that were possible, “Everything will be fixed very soon, I’ll make sure of it.”
Dudley grabbed him by the arm.  In the few instances that Harry was extremely angry something ended up being destroyed, his abilities going haywire with the need to fix what was wrong with their environment.
Harry looked around the field that they were in and Dudley was right, there was nothing here.  This was confusing as they’ve never been led astray by following a distinct pull in their senses.  Though all in all the field was beautiful and filled with multiple flowers and tall grasses, but nothing to indicate anything that could help them.
“I never want to be a bully like my dad.” Dudley said as they played with some kittens, “but both him and mom get these looks on their faces when I’m too nice, like I’m an alien to them.”
He doesn’t remember moving but he does remember the spike of pain that came from taking the hit that was meant for Harry.
“It’s not your fault, “Dudley sighed along with him as he kept an ear out for footsteps, “But I’m worried about how angry she looked, I have a bad feeling.
‘If they think Harry shouldn’t have been born.’ his mind was numb, ‘then they will think the same about me too.’
Then that lightning turned into a hook that tugged his senses into a specific direction.  He tried to resist the unexpected pull, but a sense of dread followed his rebellion, making him sick to his stomach.
In a darkened room where only candles lit up the stone walls, a small figure touched a large table in the middle.  Its shoulders shaking with silent sobs as being in that room caused innumerable amounts of pain.
“Yeah, mom always makes me eat,” Dudley shrugged as he dipped the corner of his sandwich into the soup and nibble on it, “I don’t know why but I can usually distract her before she piles more food on my plate.”
“I, uh, yeah if you want.” he replied, bewilderment coloring his voice, “help me pick up the little decorations and put them of the coffee table, then we’ll throw away the trash and straighten the furniture.”
Harry turned to look at his cousin, Dudley was staring sadly at the tabletop.  He was hesitant but what could go wrong with something this simple?  If he was clear there shouldn’t be an issue with the other boy helping him out.
“I know it’s never been wrong before!” Dudley began to pace in a small circle, “but there’s nothing here and now what are we going to do for food and shelter now?!”
He pushed the board to the side and pushed Harry through the opening.  He heard his mother coming closer and they both knew the needed to be faster, there wasn’t much time left.
“I don’t know but let’s see what’s written” he pointed to the words, “maybe there’s some directions on where we can go.”
‘When did that get there?’ he thought, pretty sure the field had been empty just a moment before, “Hey Dudley come here, I’ve found something.”
He saw Dudley stoop down and pick up the second knife.  Harry went to stop him, but his cousin held it out of his reach, “No Harry, it’s about time I’ve spilled some blood to make up for how much my family took out of you.”
Harry went through the fence and Dudley quickly reached into the bushes to it and pulled out their schoolbags.  He had taken the time while his mother was distracted waiting on his father’s return to pack some clothes and supplies for them.
“You can go wash up if you want while I clean this.” he dropped the other’s hand and turned to survey the damage.  It would take him a bit, but he could probably finish before the adults came back from their party.
“Does it feel wrong or just different?” Dudley’s head tilted in question has he gave him two water bottles; sunlight was glinting off a surprising collection of red hair at the top of his head before it transitioned back to brown.  Harry found that weird as he never thought Dudley had any other hair color but brown.  He just shrugged it off, figuring it was because they were out in the sun more than ever.
“Do…do you want to help me?” the look that lit up Dudley’s face made it worth any hassle that would come about.
About thirty minutes, and one small soup explosion later, both sat at the table to enjoy the comforting meal.  Harry was ravenous as he hadn’t eating since yesterday and couldn’t help but take quick and large bites out of the food.
“Diddykins come away from there!” his mother’s shrill voice pierced his ears.  He never noticed how much her voice would just dig into his brain.  He couldn’t imagine listening to it every single time like Harry did.
“Now let me clean up before Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon come back and all the yelling starts.”  Harry stood up, bringing Dudley with him.
Dudley felt Harry stiffen behind him and heard a small whimper and anger coursed through his body and the edges of his vision darkened again.  He felt like his world was standing still.
Dudley was sat at the table watching Harry search through the refrigerator.  The black-haired boy settled on toasted ham and cheese sandwiches with some soup to help with the emotional roller-coaster they were just on.
Warm brown hands grabbed trembling pale ones; the contrast that always made the black-haired boy feel more isolated from the Dursleys, and gave them a reassuring squeeze.  His green eyes locked onto frightened brown, he hoped that he could reassure his uncertain cousin.
Shaking his head, he gave the other boy an encouraging smile, “I will never hold against you something that makes us the same, it actually makes me feel less alone.”
Right as he turned to see how far Dudley was done with his task, a feeling sparked through his entire being.  It felts as though a lightning bolt shot from the top of his head to the soles of his feet.
As he worked, he could feel his cousin’s stare on the back of his neck but didn’t say anything, if Dudley wanted to talk then he would wait until the other was ready.
He knew she was talking about Harry and by this point Harry picked up on it as well.  They picked up their pace when they heard footsteps stumbling after them.
In contrast, weirdly enough, Dudley was taking small bites and Harry almost chalked it up to Dudley having eaten already.
“I have never seen him do anything that would make you hate him so much!” he continued, “I’m tired of standing there, not doing anything to help my only cousin!”
Dudley would “steal” Harry’s clothes from him saying that he wanted them back and then push his “ugly” clothes at him.  Vernon and Petunia would encourage the behavior and would force Harry to wear the clothes, thinking that it would embarrass him or make him uncomfortable.
And that’s how it played out, just as Dudley said it would.  He took any extras he had up to his room, shooting Harry a “smug” expression, to the amusement of his gloating parents, and the next day would have something for Harry to eat.  He had taken to cooking quickly when he and Harry could manage it.
He looked back up the stairs, uneasiness still ringing through his body, and bit his lip.  He needed to do something, and it was probably going to be drastic but right now that’s exactly what would be needed.  He thought of a plan and hoped that it would work, it had to.
He knew she was calling his father on the phone in their bedroom, so he didn’t have much time.  He ran to the door and slid open the grate so he could talk to the other child.
“He’s done nothing to deserve you being mean to him!” he yelled back at her.  He felt Harry stand up behind him and grab the back of his shirt, giving him support and strength.
“Come back Diddykins!” his mother called out but her voice sounded off, it sent a chill down his spine, “Come back and I’ll make sure the source of all of this trouble disappears from our lives!”
Right now, they were in a public park that had water fountains available for those that were visiting.  Harry was on look out while Dudley took out their four water bottles to replenish their supply, Harry was to inform his cousin if anyone decided to head in their direction.
Then is father was laid out on the floor, one of the many ugly vases his mother collected was shattered next to him.  The remaining three stared at the scene in shock, they had no idea what just happened, but it dawned on Dudley what happened, and dread fill his body.
“I don’t get it.” Dudley rubbed at his hair then pulling out a hair tie to pull it back, it’s what he always did when trying to figure something out.  Harry realized right then that they needed haircuts badly, but shelter came first and maybe later they could find some scissors to give themselves a trim.
About a month back Dudley convinced his parents that he needed a small refrigerator in his room where he could put extra snacks and drinks.  He told them that he didn’t feel like walking down to the kitchen whenever he was hungry.
Dudley’s face was crumpled with despair, a look that Harry never associated with his loud and obnoxious cousin, almost scared as he stared back into surprised green eyes.
The table dimmed and this worried them, holding their breath as they waited for an answer.  Then they felt the pull from their core and the table lit up bright than before and it began to spin into a column of light.  It spun for a few moments exploding outward.
He walked forward a little more, maybe it was just his “bad feelings” telling him they needed to leave their town to avoid being caught. they were probably being watched in that park and the person was just waiting on for the perfect time to talk with them.
They kept it a secret from Vernon and Petunia because they knew the adults would accuse Harry of trying to hurt Dudley, ultimately punishing him.
“Where did that come from?” Harry agreed with his confused cousin, that was just the question he’d been wondering.
“That child is a freak!” Vernon’s face had returned to its purple color, anger causing spit to fly from his mouth, “He should have never darkened our doorstep all those years ago or been born for that matter!”
“But I knew that we were the same, that we ARE the same,” Dudley squeaked, “and I never tried to stop them!”
“You will have to be satisfied with my blood only.” he saw Dudley’s head snap over to look at him, mouth hanging open.
“I understand why you didn’t,” Harry chanced putting a hand on the other’s shoulder, “but I’m kind of glad I found out.”
Dudley, who had been in the living room, watched in horror as his mother all but threw his cousin into the small space and slammed the door after him.  She swiftly locked it before walking up the stairs with a familiar sneer.
Of course, his parents agreed that he shouldn’t have that struggle and they went down to the department store to pick one out.
"What's so special about him? He's quite pretty, but... Is it the sex? Is it because he's a man? Is it because he's filthy rich?"
"Oh my! How the world has changed. Good for you, children. Good for you. If it had been like this at my... Wait, wait! I have to go get someone."
"Yeah, sure," Ron responded in Draco's place. "You mean to say that since you've had a taste of the Malfoy way of life, you've been settling for nothing but the best."
"Get up, Harry." Callum said, his voice tinged with pleasure. Potter shifted his feet to the seat where he had been sitting, his erection raised to the level of their faces. Draco was about to take it in his mouth, but Callum was quicker. Draco whimpered, and Callum grabbed his neck, "What? Are you that desperate to be filled through both holes?"
"It's a way for him, and for us, to protect him. We need his magic to regenerate and he needs to rest."
Harry wanted to shout to the whole platform that he was going to be a dad, but he didn't. He didn't, because he didn't know. Draco had said yes, but that didn't make Harry's sperm any more effective. He'd never succeeded, with Ginny. And his brief hope that he could carry their child himself had quickly faded after the test he'd done.
Draco noticed, on the upper floor of one of the houses, a little out of the way, the long figure of a young adult watching them. He looked too juvenile to be working here.
Harry wanted to protest, wanted to say that the wizard's face wasn't so bad, that people should accept it, but it wouldn't have been honest. Objectively, his face was hard to look at, and yet Harry's tolerance was high - he worked with Aurors every day. He could imagine how ordinary people and more sensitive people - children - would react. He could see why the wizard didn't want to become the village freak, or to scare anyone. His heart sank for him.
Molly didn't know how to respond. She'd never really felt that her opinion mattered to Draco, let alone that it hurt him.
Harry decided to save Scorpius's presents for the evening, in case he was in particular need of distraction after the day. They ate and Harry put on their coats. "We're both going out today," Harry explained. Madeleine had taken the baby for a walk a few times in the last few days, but Harry hadn't left the house with him.
“No need to sound so surprised,” he replied, nudging her with his elbow.  “I’ve spent enough time trying to figure out how to unfuck this up: that’s just one of many fascinating thoughts I’ve had when I should have been working or sleeping.”
“I highly doubt it,” Draco muttered, and Harry thought - or perhaps just hoped - he could hear some affection in Draco’s voice, and decided to go for it.
“Yeah.  Since I’m here for Halloween, making you look reputable and keeping Parkinson at bay, instead of doing something worthwhile like mourning my parents’ death.”
wanting to get into your house and into your pants.  I used to think you wanted all of the fame and attention.  I didn’t realise it was like this.”  Draco made a sweeping gesture.  “I can make all the excuses I want about being young and an idiot, but sometimes it just hits me how awful I was to you because I was a jealous brat, and I can only admit it when I’ve had a few.  So…”
Draco answered, his face a blank mask, as if he’d known exactly who it would be.  He stepped out and pulled the door shut behind him.  “I hope you understand that I’m not inviting you in.  Mother is very protective of me, and if you took one step into her house she would probably have you castrated with a single flick of her wand.”
‘Famous Flings’ section will know how closely we’ve been documenting the ups and downs of the relationship between war hero Harry Potter and rising Quidditch star Ginny Weasley.
“Oh, I have grounds.  You live here; I’m sure you’ve overheard some of my conversations with Ginny.  I’ve also confided in you because I thought you were my friend, but apparently your relationship with Parkinson trumps that.”
“What. The Fuck. Is this?” he ground out.  Draco, the slimy bastard, looked genuinely confused for a second as he picked up the magazine.
“You don’t have to go, you do realise that, don’t you?” Draco asked, handing Harry a glass of wine then pouring one for himself.  “You don’t owe her anything.”
Malfoy - how should I be cleaning the fireplaces? Every time I think I’ve got the soot off the tiles they turn black again, whether I’ve lit the thing or not.
Living with Ron and Hermione was nice for a bit, but I thought I should give them some space to be a couple.  It seemed silly to try and find my own place when I have a house (or at least, I have a house somewhere under all the dust - I swear we actually made a dent not too long ago but it’s just getting worse).
“Even if that’s the case, you didn’t have to be quite so nasty about it,” Hermione pointed out.  “I never thought I’d say this, but I miss having Malfoy around, especially on pub nights.  He’s the only person who’s even remotely useful at the quiz.”  She put down her mug and looked at Harry.  “Have you had any more ideas what to do to solve this?  Clearly you need a new approach.”
Draco just laughed, and Harry found himself laughing too - had he ever felt this joyful in bed with someone before? - stopping only to gasp when Draco pressed a proprietary hand onto his dick.  Draco’s expression turned more intense, and he squeezed again with a smirk before bending down to pull Harry’s pants off completely.
“That’s it.  I’m popping over to the shops to get some food.  You are coming to my place, because at least it has heating spells set up, you are going to eat a proper meal, and then you can Floo back to your mum’s if you’re not too shattered, or you can use one of my five million bedrooms to get an actual night’s sleep.”
When they finally broke apart - Harry was proud of them for finding the willpower to stop before things got too far, though he still found himself having to remove his hand from up Draco’s shirt - everyone at the table was staring.
“Turn it into a masterpiece of modern wizarding design?” Draco finished for him, with no small amount of pride.
Harry’s anger abandoned him just when he needed it, and was replaced by blind panic.  All he could do was try to play it off as a terribly misjudged joke.  “Yeah, you admitted to admiring my arse the other night.  Maybe you want a piece of me for yourself.”  He immediately realised there was no way Draco would think he was joking.  His words were cruel: hollow at best, a betrayal at worst.
Harry tried not to laugh.  It had been like this ever since Draco had moved back in: he suspected that in a matter of weeks, everyone they knew would have been forced to traipse up the stairs to Draco’s room and admire his painting.
“Do you think the last one might be your conscience keeping you awake, rather than some kind of house-wide vendetta?” Draco asked, unable to hide his amusement now.
He was surprised to find that the faded Dark Mark on those amazing arms didn’t really bother him; but the feathery Sectumsempra scars down Draco’s chest did, and he took his time to kiss them, as if in penance.
He made it about two steps before somehow – did he Apparate? - Draco was in front of him, arms folded.  “I’m not trying to be pushy.  But this thing with Ginevra – I don’t even want to call it a friendship – is making you miserable, and not only does that make the mood in this house oppressive and uncomfortable for me, but also -” Draco paused, put his hands on Harry’s shoulders to stop him from pushing past and running away- “every time you come home you just seem sadder and sadder, and I can’t sit back and watch anymore.  She’s holding you hostage, and you deserve better.”
Harry pushed his hair back from his face and sighed. Ron’s scrutiny was less intense than Hermione’s, but he wouldn’t let go of a topic if he felt strongly about it, especially after a few drinks. “He’s hardly a penpal.  I sent the same kind of thing: thanks, tell your mum I said thanks as well.  I just, sort of, wrote again when there was all that stuff in the news.  Wanted to make sure he wasn’t actually going nuts.  Malfoy may have been a nightmare at school but I thought I at least owed it to him and Narcissa, after everything that happened.”
Last week they made a rare public appearance together, sharing a cosy dinner at Diagon Alley’s popular vegetarian bistro, Dittany + Snowdrops (see p.74 for an exclusive voucher offering 5 Galleons off your meal!).  Although they claim that they are now ‘just friends’, we know that our readers, and even some members of the
“I assumed you’d want to keep using this one, so I tried to clear it out a bit,” Harry said, manoeuvering an impossibly large trunk full of shoes into the corner of Regulus’s room.  “I hope you don’t mind sleeping on the same floor as me - I know you said I should be using the master bedroom but it still smells like hippogriff, and I’m just more comfortable in Sirius’s.”
Luckily, they were sitting next to each other, so it was easy to press their legs together under the rather cramped table with no one raising an eyebrow, but Draco looked especially gorgeous in the afternoon sunshine, and some of his shiny blond hair had come out of its ribbon on the walk over from the Leaky. It was taking all Harry’s willpower not to reach out and tuck it behind his ear: he absolutely couldn’t do that, though, because if he did he’d end up caressing Draco’s face, and then kissing him, and then trying to climb onto his lap and finish what they’d started this morning, before they heard Hermione’s shrill voice from the Floo downstairs telling them off for being late.
“Not that it’s any of your business, but yes.”  Malfoy rearranged the sofa cushions quickly and gestured for Harry to sit down.
“Well done, Malfoy.  Ten points to Slytherin.  Though I’ve got to say, after lugging this thing through Customs and the Portkey Bureau, not to mention trying to find this place, I’m hardly in the mood to throw myself at your feet.”
“Yeah, sorry, didn’t mean to interrupt - whatever you’re doing,” Harry replied lamely.  Draco had clearly abandoned film night - it was rubbish by yourself anyway - and surrounded himself with dozens of seemingly identical fabric swatches. At that point Harry neither knew nor cared what so much yellow was doing in his drawing room.
Harry’s embarrassment returned in full force.  “It’s a bit much, really, but Luna kept going on about grand gestures, and I know you’ve wanted this - well, something like this - for ages.  It took a lot of negotiating but it’s yours.  Kind of a gift to the house, too.  I figured maybe it’d start to like me as much as it likes you.”
I’d also recommend keeping the fire lit as much as possible while you’re there, even if you’ve got your Floo closed to visitors, because the fireplace may start to take lack of use as an insult and be deliberately uncooperative.
“Not that I don’t want to - because I very, very much want to,” Draco replied, stroking Harry’s cheek, “but are you sure?  You’ve had a stressful evening, and I understand if you’re not ready for anything else right now.”
“For crying out loud, Potter.  No, it is not the first time I’ve slept here.  Yes, it is a pain in the arse.  However,
“Teeth behind your lips, breathe through your nose. Beyond that, it’s all down to practice. Trust me, I’m willing to let you dedicate many long, hard hours to practice.”
Harry wanted to tear his hair out.  “You know what, I’m just going to find somewhere to stay tonight and come back tomorrow.  There’s no point talking to you when you’re like this.”
“I can’t believe they’ve been going on about this for an hour already,” Zabini added in despair. “Weasley, can’t you call her off?”
Just a few days later, Harry was standing at the end of Narcissa Malfoy’s drive, wondering why he ever asked his friends for advice.  The carefully-wrapped package levitating next to him, which had made Customs a total bloody nightmare, suddenly felt like overkill, like desperation.  Another couple of hundred on chocolates would have done the trick, probably, along with a healthy amount of grovelling, but it was too late now.
The table lit gold and red again and the figure stared into the light, “Great ancient magics of this house I offer my magic so that last of this great family can be found, I beg of your help!”
Whoever thought that sneaking into stores and libraries would be so easy or useful?  Harry sure didn’t and they weren’t being particularly sneaky, but he and Dudley did make it a point of keeping their senses alert just in case.
Squaring his boney shoulders Harry made his way to the still crying brunette, who flinched when he noticed Harry’s closeness, and drooped as the bespectacled child kneeled next to him.
Harry knows that look, it always made him feel less than dirt, so he understood why Dudley didn’t want the look directed at him.  Vernon was well known for his bullying tactics and held no respect for anyone who did not wear a suit and tie daily.  Petunia was known to do the same to the other wives of the neighborhood when they made her angry.
“Yeah, I just feel like we need to leave town soon,” he replied as he rubbed at his chest, “I don’t think I’ve ever felt something like that before.”
‘celebrity divination analyst’ (and Hermione’s not-so-secret guilty pleasure), Madam Mimosa, wrote a double-page spread about the alignment of the planets and the soil in Wiltshire.  Apparently, these were causing residents to be ‘ravaged by a desire for change’.  “The plight of the Malfoys is a desperate one,” she concluded, “but if they bury black tourmaline crystals on the four corners of their property while the planets are in their grand cross alignment in August, this malady will pass, and they will be able to restore the former dignity of their name.”
He pushed his hair off his face and forced himself to look at her.  He knew that he owed her a proper explanation, something definitive and final, as much as he hated the idea of hurting her.  “We’ve already tried and it’s not right between us.  Our lives, our jobs, everything - they don’t work together.  And neither do we, any more.  I thought we agreed on that.”
Ginny.  Shit.  Harry banged his forehead against the wall a couple of times, then dashed the rest of the way upstairs.
Harry gave Malfoy what he hoped was a scornful look.  “First off, I spent just as many of my teenage years in shared dorms as you did; my silencing charms are excellent.  Second, don’t you read your friend Parkinson’s magazine?  Ginny and I broke up ages ago.  I’ve been on a couple of dates here and there but haven’t exactly had the time for anything much, what with work and everything.”  Malfoy nodded, though he still looked a bit sceptical - and why shouldn’t he, when
.  You all know her; I don’t suppose I could ask you to head her off if she tries to sneak away and look round the rest of the house? It’s off limits for a reason.”
Draco’s face closed off, and he suddenly looked too much like the horrible, entitled little boy he’d worked so hard to leave in the past.  Harry felt his stomach sink.
Harry grinned.  “Shut up, Malfoy.  If this is what I get for trying to be nice to you I’m not sure I should keep bothering.”
“You’re lucky this place is so crap,” Zabini pointed out.  “If there were any photographers around, you two would be toast.”
Harry was acutely aware that  he was just standing there blinking like a moron.  The place was such a nightmare that finding somewhere to begin seemed impossible, not to mention the fact that he’d assumed Malfoy would need a lot more persuading before he had to work out the logistics.
,” with no real idea what he was asking for other than for this not to end.  He reached one hand down to push through Draco’s hair, pulling it out of its tie so it fell loose around his face.  Though his eyes kept trying to close with all the sensations racing through him, all Harry wanted to do was keep watching: the sight of Draco, messy and gorgeous, sucking Harry’s dick with single-minded focus, just turned him on even more.  He was practically hyperventilating, hips thrusting up into that warm, wonderful mouth almost of their own accord, and just when it was all getting to be overwhelming Draco sat back up, and Harry practically whined with disappointment.
“I’m well aware of all that.  What I want to know is, where is she getting all her misinformation?”  Harry leaned over and unerringly prodded the phrase ‘sources close to the couple’, probably so easy to do because he’d spent a lot of the afternoon running his finger over the words, getting more and more worked up.
“I don’t know what you want to hear.  I don’t know if anything can excuse what I said.  What I do know is that I was wrong, and I’m sorry, and I miss you.  The whole sodding house misses you!  And I’m certainly not going to be able to make amends if you’re hiding all the way out here.”
Harry laughed, slightly indignantly, but Luna didn’t.  She just looked at Draco intently.  “What’s it like to the trained eye?” she asked.
You have to deal with the bureaucratic nightmare that is the Department for Magical Transportation to switch over the main Floo.  Much easier to open it as a new fireplace and tell your friends which to use.  I have proposed a cleaning product containing murtlap to several major producers, but alas, they do not see it as cost-effective and would rather continue to waste people’s time with sub-par potions.
They both laughed, and Harry, feeling oddly exhilarated, put down his drink and held out his hand for Malfoy to shake.  He didn’t know why shaking hands with Malfoy felt so meaningful.  Probably because he could count on said hand the number of times they’d offered each other any respect... or maybe Harry’d just had rather a lot to drink on what was always an emotional day for him.  Oh well, if nothing else he was now one step closer to stopping fresh paint from sliding off the walls of Grimmauld Place.
“Mate, you’ve skipped tons of Ministry things to avoid being the token war-hero. He just wants to show off that he knows you. It’s all about pushing his social standing back up by flaunting the fact that he has Harry Potter at his party.”
Also, Kreacher’s the house-elf you’re thinking of - he went to work at Hogwarts and became a sort of leader there in the Battle; I think he quite liked feeling important. I felt bad asking him to move back here by himself after all that.
This is the single greatest thing anyone has ever done for me, was what Harry thought.  This is the first time in my life I’ve ever really, truly had my own place and it’s perfect.
Malfoy - murtlap essence worked; you’re a genius!  Why isn’t it in any of the cleaning products already?  That would’ve made my life easier.  I’m trying to use the living room fire more for the Floo but the network defaults to the kitchen. Is there a way to change that?
Ron just shook his head and looked back at Harry.  “What about when you want Ginny to move in?  You can’t just have Malfoy swanning about the place.”
Malfoy chose to respond to the court and his victims with unexpected grace, saying in his prepared statement, “I sincerely regret my actions during the war, and am very grateful to everyone who offered their support, however little I deserve it.  I know many people would like me to be sent to Azkaban, but I hope they see there is poetic justice in the fact that I will be imprisoned in the house where the Death Eaters imprisoned so many others.”
between them for so long that sometimes Harry was sure it was all in his head. He just stared at Draco, watched as he licked his lips, swallowed, and repeated, more confidently this time, “I can make you happy.  If you’ll let me.”
“Don’t be too hasty, mate,” Ron argued. “She’s nearly done with the initial training, now; things’ll calm down a bit when she makes the Harpies’ team and then you’ll be able to - ow!”
“Potter,” he said, finally turning his attention to Harry, “thanks for writing.  Mother’s very pleased that I’m ‘starting anew with some good influences’, and I’ve been relieved to have someone to talk to other than the house-elves.  Not that your grasp of grammar is much better than theirs,” he added with that familiar smirk, but he didn’t sound entirely malicious, which felt like progress to Harry.
“I’m pretty sure dozens of letters and sixty Galleons’ worth of chocolates tick some of those boxes, and he’s still not budging,” Harry pointed out, finishing his sentence over Ron’s choked whimper of, “You spent
“To answer your question,” Draco murmured as he started to usher Luna towards the stairs, “if you know what you’re looking at, it’s spectacular.”
Harry wanted to protest, but it was a depressingly accurate rendition.  He also had to admit that it was good to be in on Draco’s jokes now, even if he was still the butt of most of them.
Most of the snake-themed decor was history, though Draco kept saying the word ‘heritage’ and shaking his head so Harry consented to keeping a few bits here and there: he’d actually become quite fond of the coat hooks, which responded to Parseltongue and never once let his robes and jackets fall on the floor.
“You mean the Malfoy Wing,” Draco put in, smugly.  “My family have been patrons of the arts for generations.”
“I’m trying to narrow down the curtains for Greg and Millie’s nursery, and you are a welcome distraction.” Draco put down the sample he was holding and looked at Harry for an uncomfortable moment.  “You look like hell; what happened?”
“Yeah, you complain to my face - but I’ve got my doubts about you claiming not to care about your social status.  Maybe being an anonymous source keeps you in the pureblood loop without you having any accountability.  Sounds like just the kind of thing you’d do.”
wants to nose around this place is because you’ve made it amazing.  It was barely a house before you came along, let alone a home.  Give yourself some credit.”
Hermione smacked Ron on the arm, hard, and Harry didn’t have to admit that he too had spent some of Sunday poring over the pictures of the unrecognisable Manor, wondering whether Malfoy could use his newfound decorating skills to get some of the more stressful paintings out of Grimmauld Place.
“Art is not pointless,” Draco replied.  “If you think that, you just haven’t been exposed to the right kind.  I love my mother more than anyone else in the world, but if I had to choose between her picture on my wall and something by Georgianna Moonstone, it would be a nearly impossible decision.”
He fumbled with Draco’s fly, and once again Draco took pity on him and undid it himself, climbing back off the bed to pull his trousers off and tugging at Harry’s, raising an eyebrow at Harry’s ratty old boxer shorts.
“Not worth it, if you ask me.”  No one had asked Ron. “I bet he’d bloody love knowing that you’d come all that way only for him to slam the door in your face.”
“Just one of the many, many reasons you’re lucky to be with me,” Draco announced, “is that you don’t have to worry about things like that: I’ve come up with a strategy for you.  You’re not going to like it, though.”
Trying to do this by owl is ridiculous.   Are you free to come and visit us for tea next week?  Bring paint samples, fabric swatches, and whatever other rubbish has been foisted on you, as well as photographs of the rooms if you can get them.  I would be delighted to make as many decisions as you will allow, because I have a feeling you will mess up terribly without my help.  While that would be enjoyable to witness, it would be even more satisfying for me to know I was able to save you from yourself.  Consider it just another installment towards our life debt - if you don’t, I may have to start charging you for my time, and I highly doubt you can afford me.  That was a joke.
“Which means I can interpret it however I like,” she pointed out, “and it reminds me of Harry.  How did the song go, again?  ‘His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, his hair is as dark as a blackboard’... those colours are here, and here, and there, and it shines like you.”
At least, Harry reasoned, Draco knew how to win over his colleagues.  They hardly ever made Death Eater comments these days - and Harry was willing to be the butt of the joke (pun intended, he thought miserably) if that was what it took.
“Not really, sorry.” Harry shrugged.  “We always end up getting Chinese so I zoned out after the first five or six options.”
She wiped the tears from her face and lifted her head up - Harry was proud, if he had any right to be, that everything they’d been through hadn’t diminished her strength.  “I just… it all seems so perfect, in my mind.  Like our future’s mapped out for us. I know it feels like ages ago that the war ended and you had to suddenly be an adult really fast, but it wasn’t.  We’re only just starting to figure out who we are and who we can be together, and I think you’ve been too quick to write us off.”
Don’t you have a house-elf for that sort of thing? I seem to recall Mother being especially fond of it.  If you do insist on cleaning them yourself, you should be using a squeeze of murtlap essence in your solution.
“Yes,” Harry replied, glumly.  “I spent a fortune in the Honeydukes Gourmet section.  He kept the gift but didn’t read the letter.  That was three days ago and I’ve still heard nothing.  Before that I even tried to ask Narcissa, but she sent me the most polite and beautifully handwritten ‘fuck off’ note I’ve ever read.”
