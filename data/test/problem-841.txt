“Please, it is hardly fair for me to pass judgment on others when it comes to keeping up appearances as a teacher.”
“Yes, indeed.” Severus poured himself another glass, only doing so, because it was still considered alcohol despite the awful taste. “We must regard the subject of your behavior around school.”
“Have you seen any of the international Quidditch games this summer?” Malfoy asked.
“No, no, dear, they are attached to the sweet fruity scent they release.”
Chapter twenty-six
“I could see you as a healer.” Jason encouraged him.
“Every day.”
“Jay… god! I’m gonna cum, naAh!” Jason quickly pulled out to get a finger wet before hurrying back to the desperate mess laying in front of him. He couldn’t believe this gorgeous creature could feel so good around him, in him. Jason knew he was close, even without the warning. The member in his mouth pulsed and bounced against his tongue. Not wishing to let this rare opportunity go to waste, he used his hands and pulled the pants further down, until he could sneak in a finger beneath the cock. Trying to keep from touching the balls, he instantly headed for the wrinkled temple of pleasure. He wished to touch it so badly, knowing he could store it as masturbation material for weeks.
As they finished, the boys got ready for bed and Harry couldn’t help but envy how Seamus and Dean got to share a bed, be so open and comfortable sleeping beside one another.
The croaking continued as Harry petted him.
The emotions that overcame him was devastating. He barely heard Dumbledore tell them to leave and continued their day as if nothing had happened. Harry had to teach and Harry had lessons to get to. The pair of grieving friends left the office together.
Shrugging, Harry pretended it was nothing. “I’m not sure. It just seems like it’s more than old rivalry from their schooldays. Remus also seems different around him, more than he used to.”
“Yes, why?”
Malfoy looked... different today. Up close, anyway. Perhaps it was the fact he didn’t look at harry like he was about vomit. He almost looked
Instead of answering, Harry removed his hand from the broad shoulder and to Draco’s confusion, loosened his tie. As he was able to reach underneath his shirt, he took out the pendant hanging around his neck. Draco gave him a sincere smile as gently turned the pendant over between his fingers.
Finally stopping the ranting, Snape took a deep breath.
Reaching out a hand, Harry hurried to take it in a firm grip. As they shook hands, a deep chuckle from behind Harry, reached them. Turning, he saw Draco Malfoy, leaning casually against the wall. Finally grabbing their attention, he slowly approached the trio.
“Ron…”
“Did your friends leave you behind? Oh, poor Potter.” Pansy cooed.
“No,” she said absently. “Not since last night.” She continued to curl her waving blonde hair around her wand.
“Hey.” The group of fourthyears were startled at the seventh year Slytherin talking to them. “Where did you see Melck last?”
A chimming doorbell rang as he opened the door. Severus tried desperately to keep the sneer of his face from the off-putting ensemble. The walls were covered in beige and mintgreen stripes, with giant paintings of dukes and duchess’ posing in golden frames and the cups and teakettles on the table against the disk, were in real shiny tin as if something had just polished them.
“He was in his right to hate me for what I did to him.” Remus cleared his throat.  “Either way, it is in the past and I’m truly grateful we can still work in the same place without him bringing it up at every time we see each other.”
After being shushed by Madam Pince for scraping the chair against the floor, Harry sat down at a corner table, away from prying eyes. Getting out his things, he started reading chapter twenty-one and twenty-two. This would be a good place to start, according to Jason. Underlining a few paragraphs he took extended notes on the parchment next to him. For a long time, the only sound he heard was a few whispering students or books when they were pulled from the bookcases. He had almost finished the first chapter when something shadowed his book page. Looking up to glare at whoever was staring at him, Harry was surprised to see the Slytherin boy.
(See the end of the chapter for
Students were starting to fill the large hallway Harry had to lower voice.
Dean had – with Seamus’ permission of course- offered to be Harry’s first kiss, to see if anything happened ‘down there’.  Thanking the boys for the generous offer, he declined. He did think his friends were good-looking, but it would feel terrible awkward for him afterwards and it surely wasn’t worth it.
“Mr. Potter!”
Draco should have known Blaise wasn’t trying to anger him but right now the angry green monster had eaten his way through his chest and unfortunately, Blaise stood in the way.
“What?” He had been so close to moaning, so what could have been so funny all of a sudden?
“Sit.”
“Actually,” Jason stopped him by grabbing his elbow. “Can we talk? Somewhere private?”
Soon, Harry was far away in dreamland.
He nodded and finally had a chance to see whom this new guy was. The tanned skin looked sunkissed as if he had just come home from a long vacation. Toned, but not overly muscled the boy stood taller than him, almost as tall as professor Snape. His thick brown curly hair reached his shoulders, covered a side of his forehead and a part of his right eye. Just by looking, he seemed at bit over the ordinary student but nothing you would notice enough to turn your head after him on an open street. Although one characteristic was rather out of the mundane. Being so much shorter than others, Harry could see his left eye rather clearly and he noticed right away how different it was. As the left eye was a deep sea blue, the other was darker hazelnut.
“Great. At least, I think so. He is always quite difficult to read but he barely put up a fight when I asked him to go out on a date next Hogsmead trip.”
The gang settled for some lunch and a cup of coffee at the Three Broomsticks. The rush-hour was almost over by now and it wasn’t too difficult to find a table for all of them. Sitting in the back at one of the round tables, Harry quickly got up to place their order.  He still had a few coins left over from shopping – since the suit wasn’t as expensive as he had predicted- and he knew Ron and Neville would have trouble paying for everything. After a very nice chicken and mozzarella sandwich and a warm latte, the Gryffindors went out into the cold air once more.
“No.” Draco interrupted him. “I should probably get used to being around them. They are your friends and I’ll certainly be seeing more of them even after graduation.”
“I was wonderi-“
The brown head beside Blaise, looked up and Harry was suddenly grateful that Jason had such a good hearing. Smiling, the boy waved at him. Signaling him to step out of the hall, he got a confirming nod and said ‘see you later’ to his friends. They were starting to get used to the fact that Harry had a tendency to disappear occasionally and no one took extra notice beside Hermione, whom looked rather tightlipped but didn’t say anything. Not giving her the chance to change her mind, Harry almost skipped out of the hall, ignoring the many stares he got passing by the long table.
Finally arriving at Hogwarts’ grounds, the seventh years’ departed the carriage. Draco couldn’t help but notice how Potter’s eyes lingered on the front of the carriage for a moment before he started walking towards the darkened castle. Perhaps Draco was imagining things. Mentally shrugging to himself, he and his friends started walking as well. Potter was clearly trying to escape them and rapidly increased his speed.
“Erhm… it’s very-“
“I know. It will take the time it requires.”
“Let’s just go.”
“Loose him?” Harry wondered perplexed.
“Draco, it still isn’t too-“
“So, ‘you tired?” Dean asked while gentle running his hand through Seamus’ hair. The boy nodded sleepily. As they were about to get up, harry interrupted.
Annoyed by the lack of understanding, Pansy took another turn. “Potter. Slytherins. Do not. Change.”
“How is your friend doing?”
Smirking encouragingly, Draco laid back down on the pillow, popped up so he could still see him. Harry took a deep breath, nervous, as he felt watched. Continuing to stroke it, he waited until more liquid had gathered before leaning in to lick the head. The taste wasn’t good, in any way, he hated salt, but licking the head a few times more, he knew he could get used to it. Tiny licks, turned bigger as Harry felt his way down. He mouthed the long string on the underside and couldn’t help but inhale the musky scent of sweat and Draco from the blond short hair surrounding the cock. As the member felt wet enough, Harry felt ready too.
The almost-smile on Malfoy’s face quickly turned to a cruel smirk. Harry could feel the cringe creeping up on him, knowing whatever Malfoy was about to say only could make things worse.
“Great. So maybe we could go to Hogsmeade at some point. Whenever the dates appear on the headboard, we could discuss it further?” Malfoy suggested.
“Oh no, please don’t! The ferret, really?” Ron whined. “No. no, I veto this one! Anybody else, ANYBODY.”
Malfoy’s patience finally snapped and he left Harry’s hand cold as he got up from his chair.
“I can’t claim to not have been loved, but it was probably in a different way than yours would have.”
Smiling, Harry carefully took the slytherin’s hand, almost fearful he would avoid the public affection. Without commenting it, Draco grabbed his hand firmly and gave a gentle squeeze.
“Merlin… Harry, please, love, just- I didn’t know-“ Obviously thrown off guard, Harry interrupted him. His voice was almost hysterical as he yelled;
Then air.
“What in Heavens name could possibly have motivated you to do such reckless, insane antics? To bring your lives and the entire school in such danger!”
Thank you for all the support this story has gathered! I’m so grateful for every review, even a simple ‘good story’ has truly made my day.
to be with me. It was just for fun.”
Approaching the man, Harry instantly felt relaxed enough to greet him. “Good evening Professor. Are you enjoying the party?”
But thank goodness we are still going to follow the characters outside of Hogwarts. Let’s see where our favorite pairs are heading in the next chapter.
“In a way.” The girl tensed. “-Pansy, I want us to be friends again, but you have to understand, Potter is staying.”
Quickly catching on the two jokesters continued their teasingly manner. Fred faintly touched his heart as George pretended to catch him.
And it was. Using his front arm, he moved the tight branches from a shriveling bush and turned his face to the side to protect his eyes from twitches. He pulled Blaise in behind him, easing them through. Getting passed the plants, they moved into the sun once more as they arrived at a small pond. Letting go of Blaise’s hand, he let the olive skinned boy move closer to the frozen beauty.
“What is it?” Draco seemed suspicious.
… Yes, looking didn’t hurt…
“I did.” A quiet sniffle sounded underneath the covers before a head reappeared. “He found out, Blaise. About everything.”
Laughing at his enthusiasm, Harry nodded.
“So?”
Draco might as well have slapped her.
“And then what? What am I supposed to do with that? Say ‘thank you for coming back’?” Harry almost laughed tragically at the pain he felt.
Oh god.
The scenarios in his head played like a record as he imagined Draco telling his friends everything. Sitting with every Slytherin that bothered to listen, about how pathetic Potter had given him a second chance, what a loser he had been giving him any sort of gift for Christmas… what whorish noises he had wringed from virgin Potter…
Harry smiled and thanked her for the advice. Flitwick continued through his lesson, but Harry couldn’t focus. Was it because he and Luna kept talking or perhaps because he forgot his homework? Probably both.
“Still getting yelled at by Professor Snape.” Zabini sighed.
Nodding, Harry vanquished the used tissue, picked up his bags and waved goodbye; Hurrying upstairs to change, as he refused to be sick in the infirmary on Christmas.
“Do not worry about Mr. Lupin. He is, for now, on a special task for our cause. He will be back before you know it.” Harry wondered why Remus would be on a mission. After all, Voldemort was gone. But not to disagree with the older man, he nodded along.
Smiling like an idiot, he nodded and kissed him once more.
“Nmm… Draco. Now.”
“Where have you been?”
DM POV
Merlin, was he getting a crush on Potter?
Harry blushed and hurried to look if anyone had heard them.
Harry had to bite his cheek from the pain of seeing him. Looking into the gray steel eyes, he was overcome with homesickness and for a second, he could feel any anger melt away. Malfoy was paler than usual, his eyes seemed dull and desperate. And then it passed. Malfoy had passed him, and the moment was over. Harry had to remind himself of his self-worth to keep from reaching out.
Smiling sadly, Harry nodding in understanding as tears started itching in the corners of his eyes.
He waited for most of the students to walk past him. A smaller group of girls – probably fourth years’ – smiled and giggled as they passed him. It felt like forever as he awkwardly waited for Malfoy to step by. Finally, the Slytherins started passing and the group gave him very weird looks as he tried to ignore them.
“But if there is something you-“
He had finished packing his bag and everything was ready to go, except him. Severus had never before wanted to stay away from England a badly as now. Even when he had to leave Hogwarts with the train to go back to his disgraceful parents. No, he wished to stay here, maybe start over. H couldn’t leave the deatheaters of course, but maybe have a slightly smaller role to play. Just by bringing potions and finding rare ingredients…
“Because I believe you knew my dad.”
As Harry continued to write down his notes and thoughts on the various potions and their properties, something landed on his desk. A small origami bird gentle sat on his table; the second Harry touched one of its wings, the little bird unfolded. Scribbled inside was a small note;
Looking away quickly hoping to avoid the sneering banter, Harry turned his gaze to look at the bare stonewall in front of him. Concentrating so hard on the wall, Harry’s eyes started to water from not blinking to long. He almost jumped when a warm body sat down next to him.
Understanding Dumbledore was always a riddle. He never truly said what he meant, but by what he could decipher, he knew about Malfoy and him, which was pretty obvious, since the headmaster probably read the paper. But more importantly, he approved. Unlike Mr. Malfoy.
“Potter, have you by any chance lost you mind?” Zabini spurted as he escaped the fistful and started smoothing out his wrinkled shirt.
“Please.”
The tiny professor went past their table with a small huff.
“Great, I’ll go get it.” Harry went to the kitchen before loudly announcing the ‘tragedy’
“Okay, that’s great.” Dean smiled encouragingly.
“You seem very quiet today, my boy. Anything troubling on your mind?”
“Quite alright Potter. We should get going but we’re probably going to be seeing each other from time to time from now on.” At this, he turned to smirk at Malfoy. Malfoy in return, just chuckled under his breath and winked at Harry. Well, if he wasn’t blushing before, he certainly was now. As much as he hated the Slytherin’s attitude no one could deny the obvious attraction, Malfoy had.
A gentle cough separated the arguing pair and they turned to listen to their headmaster. “I believe it will be in everyone’s best interest – including… Aodhan’s – if we settle this in a calming manner back at my office. Severus, Minerva, have you both left your classes with a prefect?”
Theodore had obviously found the whole ordeal most amusing. His mocking laughter didn’t do anything besides piss Draco off, even further.
“I suppose. But it is always good to know people in different departments of careers. In case they are needed.”
Because of the deep calming silence beside Hagrid’s voice, it wasn’t very surprising that Harry noticed the sound of footsteps behind them. Turning to look, he realized Malfoy was joining the group and he desperately tried to get eye contact with the boy. But as Malfoy turned away from him, Parkinson latched herself on to him and pulled him closer to the unicorns. Harry tried to push down the feeling of disappointment and another feeling, a rather stomach eating one, he didn’t wish to focus on. Seeing another shadow move behind him, his eyes widened as Professor Snape stood behind them in silence. He quickly turned back to the lecture.
“Alright, if you are certain…” The man took something from beneath the counter and gathered a small notebook with shaking hands. Preparing to write, he asked Harry for the design details.
Jason thanked the group for the offer but as already heading for some chess play in the dungeon. Nodding understandingly the Gryffindors’ headed upstairs, while Harry stayed to chat.
Unfortunately, Aodhan didn’t think he was quick enough to provide or simply didn’t care because the next second a large ripping sound was heard, and the treats fell to the floor. The dragon – upon seeing the treasure – let go of the offending piece of cloth and started gathering.
Finally, they had finished and Seamus promised to get him something nice from Hogsmeade next time as a thanks. He shrunk the presents and left the room with his trunk behind him. Drying away the invisible sweat from his forehead, Harry sank down on his bed almost landing on the giraffe. The paper crunched beneath him and he picked it up. The present was actually rather heavy for a stuffed animal and he wondered what the old man had used as stuffing. Sitting up, Harry slowly moved the paper out of the way and a tiny giraffe was revealed.
Of course. Of all people, he had to run into Potter. The most Annoying golden child, who only lived to be a pain in the ass.
They had already brought their jackets so they didn’t have to go back to the Gryffindor tower. A lot of the students followed their example and left their table. Harry discreetly turned to see if Malfoy had left as well and he hadn’t. Still eating, the teen was discussing something with his friends and had probably not even seen that Harry had gotten up. A disappointing feeling settled on over him. Why did this bother him so much? Malfoy was nice and all, but he hadn’t really gotten to know him well enough for this to be so important. Clearly, Malfoy didn’t think so….
The magical hotel room was indeed beautiful. Cherry flowers and white lilies were decorating the walls and vases, whilst a white tableclothed table was filled with small chocolates and chilled champagne. Both untouched.
Glancing towards the happy couple once more, Jason tried convincing him to tell.
“Ignore them, Harry.” Dean discreetly squeezed his arm reassuringly.
“Nhn!” Harry couldn’t hold back anymore. His erection shook and come was painted across both their stomachs. It was incredibly erotic to watch their stomachs as they pushed against one another. Harry loved knowing that all those pants and gasps was because of him. It was a completely different type of warmth spreading inside his stomach. But no matter how much he loved it, his body was getting tired now. He was already beginning to feel the burn of his used body.
“Fine! Then you can decorate!” Harry threw his arms in admission of defeat.
“Hagrid? What is in that cauldron?” Harry asked accusingly.
For a second the entire classroom rung after her words ended. It took another minute before Harry found his voice;
Toys? Well, Draco was certainly to grown up to get a toy. But perhaps… if he was so grown up, he might see the irony in getting him one. ‘Either way’ Harry thought, ‘He will surely want to exchange it, no matter what I get him. So why not?’
“Lauris. His name was Lauris and no, I don’t wish to discuss it further.” Severus intervened, feeling it necessary to use the man’s real name.
At the mention of Potter, Draco felt a certain anger flare in his chest. He wasn’t a fan of Potter –
The member twitched underneath him as Harry carefully grasped it in his hand. It was warm and firm. The cock was already oozing with clear liquid and Harry really wanted to try it.
“Now? Why?” Dean wondered.
Turning back to his half empty plate, he distracted himself from looking at the others by pilling on peas and gravy. Unfortunately, he couldn’t stop from looking across the table, wondering what Ron’s reaction to his sister was. The boy was looking as red as his sister had been, but he only gave Harry a rather nasty look before turning back to his own lunch. None of his friends mentioned the little outbreak and Seamus quickly ended the awkward silence by asking about the upcoming snowball fight.
Shaking his head, Harry answ ered; “It’s just a really sucky day.”
“Oh.”
Snape squatted down next to the couch, not pressuring, but simply waited for him to talk.
“-therefore you simply focus on the object – in this case the Christmas ball, and picture the transferring imagine in your mind; thus.”
“Really? Zonkos?” Malfoy complained.
“I know you think he is heartless, but he only dealt with a difficult situation.” He quickly hurried to continue as Harry snorted in disbelieve. “He did. I didn’t see it that way for many years, but I realized when I would have to see these people again, they would have eaten me alive. My father tried to toughen me up at a young age.”
“What are we supposed to say?! Everyone sees you walking around with Slytherins lately. People are talking!”
“I think you’re confusing ‘adorable’ with ‘terrifying’.” Draco mumbled, obviously trying to make him laugh. It did work and Harry chuckled.
“And perhaps a wonderful night.” Harry didn’t know what came over him, but the loving silver eyes, suddenly turning hungry was worth it. Leaning over him slightly, Draco leaned in to whisper;
“If you don’t want to sit with us I completely und-“
Hermione truly did an amazing job at not rolling her eyes.
“Mr. Malfoy, stay after class.”
Slowly wakening, he turned his head trying to fall asleep again. He kept his eyes closed but still he sensed it was in the middle of night. The room had turned slightly colder as the sunrays had left the room. About to tuck his arms under the covers a small hand touched his shoulder, shaking him. Drowsily he opened his eyes and had to blink to get used to the darkness. As his eyes adjusted, a small figure appeared beside his bed. It was hard to see but the neon colored clothes was hard to miss.
“I will.” Crabbe and Goyle chorused. Placing their coins into Theodore’s open palm.
“That is the bathroom and in here…” He opened the second door down the small hall. “-is my bedroom.” He gave a shy smile and entered; leaving Severus to stand in the doorway. The tan man sat down on his bed and faced him.
“Guys, I think I should buy a present for Draco but I’m not really sure what he would like. I mean, he has kind of a different taste-“
“Still, she could have told him.” He grumbled.
At the first set of steps towards freedom, a female voice stopped him. Glancing back, he saw Pansy Parkinson hastily making her way towards him. Even though he didn’t have anything against the girl per say, she did give him an odd vibe. Especially since she and Draco seemed to be in constant glaring contest whenever they were together.
As the Professor proceeded to tell the class about the Flutterby bush - which had bloomed- Draco tried to keep his focus on her instead of the flower. Looking at the blooming bush, the blood red flower almost breathed. If Draco kept his eyes on a single flower, he could see the petals move in and out from the centre. Potter would probably like this flower as well, considering the Gryffindorish color. Reaching out he almost touched a flower.
Laughing, Harry told her how the closest thing to a snowball fight he had ever tried was when his cousin and his friends were chasing him and throwing muddy snow at his face.
“Oh please! You have been after me
“Darling, please,” his mother raised a hand, stopping the coming outrage his father was surely to embark. “While Mr. Potter isn’t completely of pureblood status, the Potter family is very well respected, not to mention financially secure. And Mr. Potter could certainly be a benefiting member of the family.”
He waited until he could no longer hear the potion Professor and then slid out. Making sure Snape wasn’t going to jump out from somewhere and surprise him, Harry continued outside. The sun had lowered over the land and was shining its last rays of the day. Harry jumped a few times trying to catch up with Remus. What if he had already apparated? Hurrying even faster, Harry ran the last way to the Quidditch pitch, almost running straight into it, but the gates were securely locked.
DADA was still Harry’s favorite class. He always imagined how rusty he would feel getting back from a summer at the Dursleys, but his wandwork and agility had stayed just the same as he had left it at Hogwarts. Dueling with his teacher was the closets he would come to a true challenge at school. He didn’t mean to brag but having fought against the dark lord and practiced with Professor Snape as well as the headmaster, Harry couldn’t find competition amongst his peers.
Harry suddenly got startled out of daydreaming as Jennifer got up from her seat. He realized half the class did the same and was about to get up as well, when a strong hand landed on his shoulder and pushed him back into his seat.
Harry quickly pulled completely into the embrace and almost stood on his toes to get closer. Draco captured him even harder and spread his large hands across Harry’s back, bringing their chests in so tightly. Feeling troubling breathing Harry took a deep gasp away before latching on to him again.
“He became my friend! I told you how much Harry liked that prat. You just kept on this charade, as if it wouldn’t even affect you. You lied to me… for so long…”
The students in the hall roared and whistled as Harry tried not to hide himself underneath the table. More than a few got up on their feet to congratulate him. Looking up at the podium, Dumbledore was smiling at him and proudly clapping his wrinkled hands together. The teachers behind him joined as they rejoiced the wonderful fall of the dark lord. Harry was sure he even saw Professor McGonagall wipe away a tear.
While he waited for Hagrid to open the door, he hurried to loosen the robe wrapped around him. It was genuinely always hot inside the cabin since Aodhan had hatched. How many times had Harry not had to throw off both shoes and shirt? Keeping up with a playful dragon inside a hut barely 3 feet long was certainly hard work.
“Why?” Harry looked at him in what was hopefully an innocent manner.
“I don’t-“
“Hey.” Blaise came in, looking quite handsome in his dark azure suit. That was the one thing Draco was glad about this wedding; Blaise had immediately agreed to be his best man. “Just came to see how you were doing.” As the man entered the room, his bodyguard stood behind him, leaning against the doorway. He didn’t seem even remotely interested in being here and Draco was certain he was only here because Blaise had forced him. Tiny pale scars were still prominent on his face and left hand, but his hair covered most on his forehead nicely.
Finally, at the great hall Draco turned straight left and headed for the Slytherin table. Most of the proud house had already shown up and finished eating. They had Herbology in the first class so he would have to make time for getting down to the third greenhouse. He had barely sat before the mail soared through the hall. White, brown, black and red owls tossed packages and letters down over the heads of students. Landing near his cornflakes was his family owl. Not used to getting letters this early in the week, Malfoy unwrapped the paper from the black-banded and orange-beaked owl and gave it a piece of bacon before it flapped and left the table. Opening the Daily Prophet from behind he flipped to page ten for the sport section.
“Have you and Jason talked a lot about his father?”
“I… wondered, if perhaps you had been to Australia at some point back in ’79?”
“Perfect! Just a bit more…”
“Jason,” Harry tried to seem as apologetic as he could. “It wasn’t just Draco. They all knew… they were all a part of it.” He whispered.
“It’s sticky.”
“Right.” The bushy girl blushed slightly at the mention of their little conversation that had taken place earlier this month. Trying to deny the obvious awkwardness between his best friend and him, Harry turned to Neville and asked him about holiday plans.
Finally arriving home, he threw his soaking bag and sneakers on the floor. The water already dripped down and hit the pinewood floor. Dragging his feet behind him, he landed on his red wine-colored couch. He wandlessly started the coffee maker, trying to keep his mind on the sound of the old kettle.
“Really? May a curious old man ask what?”
For a while, Draco just watched the empty pit, waiting for his father to jump out, changing his mind. The fire pit remained hollow. He had been so convinced his parents wouldn’t approve of the relationship, he hadn’t even begun to wonder what would happen if they did. Well, his mother approved. He imagined his father tolerated the change because of his wife. But now, he wouldn’t only have to withstand a relationship with Potter, but if he broke it up, he would still have to marry that hissy fit of a woman. What should he do?
“No.”
‘That‘s just great’. Malfoy tried not to look too exhausted and annoyed. Dealing with Snape was never easy, but the best strategy was to remain calm and collected.  Letting his companions know they could go on without him, Draco sat back down in his chair.
“Then I saw him. Sitting just a few feet away, looking at the museum in front of us. There was so many people, tourists, crowding the place and taking hundreds of pictures, but I just had to look at him once to know he was there for me.” Jason pleasantly laughed. “Seemed so strange. For the first time in almost two weeks, I wanted to talk to someone. To explain my pain, my sorrow to him. For I knew he would understand. Sitting there, alone, was no coincidence. I knew he was waiting for me, as I had waited for him.”
“I don’t know if it is too strange to talk ab-“
“Wait a second.” Grabbing the brown paper bag next to him, Malfoy quickly unfolded his new gloves. “Stretch your hand.” He said while holding the left glove up.
“It’s fine.” Malfoy said shortly.
A sinking feeling, cold as ice, were sinking into his gut and but Blaise would not be stupid enough to show any sort of emotion before he was certain Jason even knew the truth.
“I fear to say it out loud, Potter, but purebloods have a tendency to take such engagements very strictly.”
“Don’t expect the sword of Gryffindor.” Snape said as busied himself with his eggnog.
“I hope you do not mind walking me back to the office.” Dumbledore gently smiled. “I fear someday in my older age, I will simply forget how to get there.”
“In a way.” Jason said thoughtfully. “Staying near him definitely increases the power of protection intended in our genes. We are supposed to protect our family with everything we got. But since we haven’t bonded or anything, I don’t think anything more will happen than my magic becoming more robust.”
It didn’t last long before the group heard the approaching sounds of footsteps in the crisp snow. Green and Black- dressed in cloaks, the Slytherins joined them. Harry only recognized a few, such as Draco, Zabini and Knott. The rest seemed to be friendly enough, just a little withholding. The minute Draco was close enough he quickly but gently swooped in for a kiss. Even the smallest contact from Draco still sent a tingling feeling down his spine. Letting go of his lips, Draco leaned back with a smirk. His eyes quickly turned cold though, looking at something behind Harry. Harry also looked and realized Hermione was watching them with narrowed eyes.
He was floating or flying… one or the other.
DM POV
As the wrapping paper revealed soft fake hair, Draco froze. He had no idea he was gabbing like fish before he felt his lips turning slightly dry from his own breath. In his hands, he held a small stuffed giraffe. The hair was short and natural coloured and the brown glass eyes looked friendly and warm, staring back at him. He squeezed the toy a few times and felt the heavy filling move inside it. He had to swallow a few times to remove the big lump within his throat as he thought of the only person who could have given him such a gift.
“I believe we should give young Mr. Melck a chance to explain himself, don’t you?”
Stupid Potter would think this wonderful gift was a good idea.
“Yes…. Merlin,” Draco started biting his neck, maybe feeling embarrassed by the sounds he was making.
The Slytherin smirked around him as he teased and gently bit his nipple. A finger joined the fun and pinched the other. While Harry had played with himself before, it was almost unbelievable how good it felt to have them sucked. The tongue and finger synchronized quickly. Both teasing, centering before a sudden rap of pain erupted. Every time Harry cried out Draco would let go and begin caressing him again.
Understanding the Slytherin mind, Draco knew this was Pansy’s way of apologizing. And to be completely truthful, he had missed her a little as well. Their relationship had always been so intense so full of understanding yet they annoyed the hell out of each other. He had missed her snarky comments when they were heading towards someone else.
Nodding without looking at him, Jason said they should be returning to the common room. They silently walked back to the Slytherin common room, were Jason immediately threw himself on the bed. Harry hid his cloak and went to the bathroom to brush his teeth.
“What is wrong with him?” Zabini silently wept as he sought out the Professor for an explanation. The professor simply shook his head and continued to stare at his son. Sniffling, Zabini leaned in and stroked the faltering brown hair.
“But you’re not in love with me, Draco.” Pansy finally looked at him. “And I deserve to be with someone who is.”
“Yes. Now come, there are some people I want to introduce you to.” Laying a light hand on his lower back, Draco led him to other tables across the room where multiple girls were dressed in emerald green. Harry ironically imagined what house they were possibly from. But these were Draco friends and he quickly put on a smile he remembered Hermione had said was charming.
Watching Potter, Draco got rather curious seeing the boy writing something furiously before looking up and around the hall, before then again, writing down. What on earth, was the boy doing? Suddenly a bosom blocked his vision, and his poor nose was invaded by a strong smell of synthetic roses. The smirk he was met by, resembled to a cat getting away with eating a goldfish.
Harry dared to raise his eyes slightly from where they had been planted on Draco’s chest. Fearing the worst, he held his breath, knowing that, however Draco reacted would inflict the future of their relationship. If Draco didn’t feel the same way… what would he do then? Would he just be okay with Harry saying it or would he freak out, saying ‘this is too fast’? What if he never even got to hear Draco say it back? Shou-
“We talk.”
Remaining at the top of the stairs, Harry discreetly peered around the hall, searching for a blond head of hair. At last he noticed the teen, standing with his back turned, already drinking what Harry assumed was champagne. He stood amongst his friends, chattering. Beside him, Pansy was twirling her hair around a finger, restlessly. Theodore looked rather calm, while the two oggers seemed rather out of sort as they pulled on their tight robes.
“Everything will be explained soon enough. For now, I think you could use some help with this game.” Smiling teasingly, the older man pulled out his bent wand, flicking it in a complicated pattern. The second he began, the students could only watch with their jaws dropped as the snow around them began folding like clay. Tall walls, triangle buildings, staircases, tunnels underground and icy patches formed itself, creating a giant battlefield. Two giant piles of perfect snowballs were laid out on each side of the field.
'But I know life can be beautiful, I pray for a better way.  If we changed back then, we could change again! We could be beautiful..."
"Um.  Let me sit at your table, at lunch.  Just once?  No taking necessary.  If people think that you guys tolerate me, they'll leave me alone..."
"Shut up, Pansy!"
'Dear Hermione,
"What the fuck, Harry! Why did you do that?" Caitlyn yelled at him, she looked like she was going to murder someone and Harry knew it would probably be him.
they've left me a myriad of scars.'
"If we changed his clothes, he might...Might look good enough to hang out with us?  We have green, red, yellow...Blue! He could be blue!  C'mon Dracock!" Pansy said happily.
"Holy shit, I was your first time? I'm, well, honoured...I've always thought of you as sex on legs." Harry brushed his hair back awkwardly.
"Let's rub each other's backs while watching porn on cinemax!" He felt sick, Harry then saw Draco, Caitlyn and Pansy.
"I'm worried. Worried about you. Please, if you can, tell me what's wrong? You look almost sickly." Harry explained, placing his hand on top of Draco's. He made himself seem less scared than he truly was; he felt as though he needed to stay strong for the both of them.
"Sorry, Draco." She said.  Draco walked closer to Harry, getting on his tiptoes and inspecting his face.  Potter smiled and leaned down, the blonde cupped Harry's cheek with a curious look on his face.
"... I love you.  So, so fucking much."
Draco Potter.  Fuck, that made his stomach sink.  He should've proposed to him, but his nerves got the best of him.  He hated this constant feeling, it wouldn't go away! Harry couldn't believe he had killed the love of his life -- well, really, it wasn't intentional.  He had tried to kill himself, but Draco stopped him.  He needed this dreadful feeling to end; he couldn't wait anymore.  The longer he was awake, the more miserable he felt.  Harry felt dead inside. His tongue felt dry. His throat felt as if someone thrust a handful of itching powder inside. His eyes were scruffy. He had been laying in his bed for twelve hours straight. He wasn't in the mood to move.  He was so upset, but he didn't want to be happy.  He just couldn't.  The only time he felt even slightly positive was when he read the notes Draco had written him.  But even those hurt.
"Baneberry Potion," Harry stated, his throat feeling as though it were closing.  He was about to choke.  "it's a poison that'll probably kill you easily."
"I forgive you! Now kiss me!"
"Feel!"
"There's no alcohol in here! Are you trying to poison me?" She screamed, throwing the bottle and smashing it into a million pieces.  Hermione down at the group, embarrassed.
"No, look.  Here's a suicide note." Another said, picking up the piece of paper that Harry once touched.
"Even closer?" Draco raised an eyebrow, closing his eyes.
"Like... like what?"
"Look, are we gonna have a problem?" Draco said.  "You've got a bone to pick?" Harry shook his head, oh fuck, what has he done? "You've come so far, why now are you pulling on my dick?"
"Can I call you daddy?" Malfoy asked, taking off his own shirt and completely ignoring what he'd just said.
Mourn not the passing of my life well lived, yet celebrate. Count the times our souls smiled together, reached out so invisibly yet tangibly and touched. Death is only the end of a chapter, Harry, my love. And so as my body makes ready to return to the soil, my spirit will watch over you and live in your heart. It will bring sadness as we transform to this new way of connecting, yet this is part of living.
'Box up my clothing for Goodwill; and give the poor my Nordic Track.
"Yeah, he is."
"Caitlyn, shut up." He said, Harry could feel his hot breath against his face.
He thing he wanted most in life was in Heaven, so, he'd go after it -- he'd go after him.
"Out children are dying! I suggest we get everyone into the cafeteria and just talk and feel together." McGonagall cried.
"Tonight I'm yours, I'm your dead boy walking!" Draco said as Harry took off his pants. "Get on all fours, kiss this dead boy walking!"
"Who is that babe?" Daphne asked, resting her head on her hands.
Maybe that the me inside of me.'
"Grow up, Parkinson.  That makeup was from '87!" Draco muttered, reapplying his lipstick.
"Harry! Harry Potter?" Hermione yelled at him.  Everyone gasped.  His name was being chanted through the hallway, he'd never felt this way before.  He liked it.
"Hm?"
"Sad" sounded so childish, like something flimsy, something one should be able to cast off with a happy reflection or the smile of a friend. But "sad" is nothing of the sort. It sits inside like the germ seed of depression, just waiting for the right conditions to grow, to send out roots to choke the hope out of your heart. It is the trough in which we struggle to return to the peak, always afraid that this time the rungs will be too slippery, too far apart or simply not there at all.  It's like a void. A dark void. A never ending dark void that consumes everything, so your left feeling nothing. Empty. Nothing to subside your hollow soul that creeps in the shadows, away from any other human life because it's emptiness is so consuming it cannot bare to pretend that everything is okay. Nothing is okay! People walk around this earth each day and pretend that everything is okay, and it always will be. Why can't we all just admit that we are just hollow plastic dolls with a painted happy face revealing no guilt, sadness, emptiness - emotion.
"H-Harry...I-I..." Draco stuttered, wiping his lips, which smudged his lipstick. "Were you using me for popularity?" He yelled, Pansy and Caitlyn rushed to his side, glaring at him.
"Hermione Greasy in the flesh." Caitlyn snickered.  Harry walked over to 'Mione, who didn't notice people calling her names.
But just underneath was a terrified boy
"September 1st, 1989." He said to himself, doodling it down on the top of his lined book.
"Yes please, Pansy darling.  I brought him a quite manly looking sweatshirt, he'll look lovely in it.  Draco, it's in your bag." His mother said.  Draco turned to Harry, who had his bag on his back.  As he unzipped it and searched for the pants, Narcissa raised an eyebrow.  "Who is this? Why is he carrying your things? No slaves, Draco!"  Harry laughed at that.
"Get a room, you two!" Caitlyn laughed, high-fiving Pansy.
"I've been thinking about it for a while now..." Harry sighed, unable to look back. "I could simply use 'Avada Kedavra', but it feels too -- I don't know -- quick?"
He wanted more, more money, more popularity, more attention.  As the two girls and two boys walked down the hallway, people stared at them but it wasn't anything special.  They entered the cafe, Harry whispered to Draco;
"Not without a hall pass, you're not. Week's detenti-" Harry got up from behind the door, interrupting her.
"How?"
"I'll always be watching over you.  And, just so you know, I've left some things in my dorm for you." Draco told him.
"Who's that with Draco?" Seamus asked, everyone's attention went to the doorway.  Pansy walked in first, striking a pose.  Next, Caitlyn, who went over to Pansy.  She winked at Blaise who finger-gunned.  Then Draco stepped in, his cheeks redder than usual.
"Well, um-" Harry began but he wasn't even listening as flashbacks started to flood his mind.  Fight.  Party.  Alcohol.  Harry.
"Hey, hey, I still have a week.  So, lets spend it together, okay? Maybe then you can tell me?" Draco comforted, cupping his face and wiping the tears away with his thumb.
A lot of people will be hurt with my passing, disappointed even, or maybe it won't matter. But I'd like to believe, no matter how much of a fucked up person I am, I died for a cause greater and bigger than myself. That's the only consolation that I have right now.  And don't worry about me, I'll be with Draco by the time you are reading this. "
"What note? Why'd you gotta be so weird all the time? People wouldn't hate you so much if you acted normal." Draco took the bottle away from her, giving it to Caitlyn.  She flicked the lid off and took a sip, spitting it out.
'Draco.'
"It's exciting, right?" Hermione said happily. "Oh, I wanna say hi to Draco.  I brought him sparkling cider." Harry, forcing himself not to speak, chugged a shot.
"I can't believe you actually came." Harry said awkwardly to her, avoiding eye contact.
Harry sat on the benches, writing in his diary.  His jeans were uncomfortable, but they were the only thing that went with his blue hoodie.  He sighed, flipping to the next page and checking his phone for the date.
Harry ended up leaving the party early.  As he laid down on his bed, only one thing was left in his brain.
'But oh, the world, it held me down;
I'm inviting you to the party tonight.  It's at Pansy's house, dress well.
"Darling, I never stopped loving you... I'm sorry I made you do that." She cried, wrapping her arms around him.
"Yeah, Caitlyn, maybe I should.  Or maybe Dean and Seamus need to stop fucking each other behind the bleachers!" She yelled in reply, puking again.  Draco snickered, before Professor McGonagall walked in.
Ron Weasley, a kid that played the drums yelled at the guitarist:
"I'd normally slap your face off and everyone here could watch! But I'm feeling nice, here's some advice - listen up biotch!" Draco yelled, he grabbed Harry by the collar of his shirt and whispered; "Welcome to my candy store." Draco then pushed him, stared directly into his eyes, then walked out of the room.
"What?" Harry growled angrily. Draco watched Harry's eyes. Then he knew. The anger was nothing but a shield for pain, like a cornered soldier randomly throwing out grenades, scared for his life, lonely, desperate. He breathed in real slow. What if nothing blew up? What if there were no consequences? Wouldn't Harry have to calm down? Wouldn't the shield clatter to the ground and let the pain tumble out? Harry was rigidly clutching his jeans, his eyelids shut so tightly they began to fidget and shudder from the bullish force, as if the very corner of his eyes were being pricked with a needle, crying silent tears that ran past his cheeks and over his knuckles until finally dripping onto the floor with as much a sound as the man's hushed agony. "Oh." He finally choked out, unable to say anything else. Draco could see him. He could. He saw pain in those emerald eyes. It had sat there for his life time, trapped in the confusion we all carry. Draco saw love too, the love you would have given were it not for the scars. Once again Malfoy's emotions turn jagged and his insides tight.
"Don't you dare touch me! Get away pervert!" Astoria and Daphne yelled.
"I - I told my mum I was gay and she said she'll kick me out if I bring it up again."
"Pansy wasn't feeling well, we're helping her." Draco said, examining his nails.
Harry imagined Draco saying this, singing it, whispering it in his ear.  Tears stung his emerald eyes as he continued to write.
'No one thinks a pretty boy has feelings.
"Draco died, so we could all be free!"
"Burnout!"
'They couldn't see past my rockstar mystique,
"Draco touching me..." Hermione gushed, her head in the clouds.
"Yeah, I guess.  But, I think I have a better way." Harry had been to the library several times, trying to find something perfect.  Whenever he'd turn a new page, his hand just felt heavier and heavier until he couldn't turn anymore.  He'd keep getting distracted, with every technique he'd read the more he fell into a fantasy.  Imagining the now non-existent dream of his and Draco's wedding, the kids they were supposed to have -- God! They were supposed to grow old together!
"Harry, stay happy for me." Draco hiccuped, tears rolling down with the same quietness. Harry sighed, wiping his own tears, watching as Draco's hand curled around his stomach and he staggered in mental and physical pain. His breathing would stop for a time only to reemerge like a drowning victim coming up for one last breath.  Harry held him in his arms, leaning over as he sobbed.  Tears stained his cheeks, making his eyes glassy as he whispered goodbye to his love.  Draco took one final glance at him who clutched his lifeless body and smiled an ambivalent smile before walking into the deep abyss.
"Maybe you should see a doctor, Pansy."
Death is a body or shadow that lurks in the dark, he crawls under little children's beds and he is always there. He is always there, following you and the closer he gets the sooner he will take you as his own. He is the ghost that people fear and he is the tormentor of the many corpses claimed by death. You know when your time is nearing its end because you can feel the chill of his icy breath as it tickles the hairs on the back of your neck. Death wasn't kind. Draco knew that. It snatched where it could, taking people who were far too young, far too good. It didn't pretend to care, it didn't pretend to distinguish. The hooded vale of death had hung over the world for a long time, always threatening. It had never touched Draco quite so close. Death had ripped away a part of him, the part of him that was most loved. Now Draco would sit staring for hours. His face sunken and haunted, his mind cold and empty. All his life he had feared death, suppressed dealing with the notion, never ready to depart. Always for him there would be tomorrow and the day after. Time was no longer his casual acquaintance, but leading him steadily onward whether his feet wanted to follow or not. Many say that when you die, you will meet a robed skeleton holding a scythe. Some say you go to Heaven or Hell. Some say that you are reincarnated. Some say you turn into a ghost, while some say you sleep for eternity. Draco was unsure if he believed any of that, or if it was just 'lights out'.
"You know... You-know-who has demanded that I'm to be killed."
In class, Harry took out a pen and paper and decided to copy some people's handwriting for practise.  He looked at Draco's; cursive and very pointy.  Harry scribbled it down on the paper.  Then he looked at Hermione Granger, an idea popped into his head.  What if he invited Hermione to the party?  He could slip her a note, maybe?
Harry leaned down and kissed him.  This felt better than the time at the cafe, it felt like it had more reason, more emotion.  Harry was addicted to Draco's lips, like a little boy who loves candy.
"I'm bigger than John Lennon!" The professor cried, Harry wished he had died instead of Draco.  A bunch of students had gotten a massive picture of Draco and stuck it at the end of the hallway, reminding Harry everyday of what he had done.
"Are y'all coming to the party tonight?" Pansy asked the group as they walked to English.
"No one thinks a pretty girl has substance. That's the curse of popularity." The first cop read from the page, feeling honestly - quite sad.
"Draco cried, our sins fell on him shoulders!"  Every single person was singing now, apart from Harry.
"My God. Look what we've done. We're breaking through! Draco would be so proud of you!" The Professor said happily, the image of his dead body stuck in his mind like glue.
"Where the hell are those freshmen?" Draco said, annoyed.
"Draco, you don't need to be rude all the time.  You know?" Harry said, stepping in front of Granger.
"I'm going to miss you so fucking much.  I already do -- it burns." were was the words of Harry's. Thirteen simple words constructed of simple letters, spoken quietly through his soft English accent, that cut through Draco. His eyes burned with an ache to sob as his stomach rock back and forth on the harsh waves of fear. Why are we taught to fear it, he asked himself. Why? Whether deaths is an eternal abyss of darkness, a fiery pit, of a clouded castle, we fear it. Whether it comes as a relief or a surprise, we fear it. Draco couldn't remember anyone teaching him to fear the inevitable, yet he did, but why?
"Shut your mouth and lose them tighty whities!" Draco whispered.  Harry obeyed, taking off his shirt.  That would be the last time Harry obeyed Draco, though. "Are your parents home?" The blonde asked.
'We were so tiny, happy and shiny, playing tag and getting chased...' He continued, ignoring the screams and names coming from every mouth in the room.
"I have nothing else to do, so might as well." Draco shrugged.  Harry, who was holding Malfoy's books and his own because he insisted that Draco shouldn't hurt his arms, nodded.
"No! Mother, please- Mother, it was a dare! Right, Pansy?" He panicked, turning to Pansy with a pleading look on his face.
Finally, Harry stepped into the room.  He had a blue bomber jacket, blue converses, black jeans and a white shirt.  He grinned.
"Yes! My boy's a homosexual and that don't scare me none.  I want the world to know..." She smiled slightly. "I love my dead gay son!"
"...Thanks? I guess.  I've like, made out with people and given handjobs but I haven't had it up the arse.  So, uhm, was I good?" He asked innocently.  "Sorry, trying to get memories back."
Draco couldn't bare to look at Harry. He felt so guilty. He couldn't imagine how Potter would feel about this. The more he thought about it, the more tears began to fall. Oh god, he couldn't stop himself anymore.
Potter grabbed the other boy's red jacket, pulling him upwards.  They kissed.  Harry Potter was kissing Draco Malfoy and it felt like fireworks on the fourth of July.  That kiss, he realized, he wanted more than he wanted the attention.  He couldn't handle it, letting go and stepping back.
"Do you even care?"
Some would say Harry was a fool to keep yearning for Draco. He had reached out his hand, stretched his fingers into the sunlight in every season, hoping that Draco's would come from the shadows once more. There are days Harry could almost hear his feet walking by his side, his soft words echoing in the trees, the way Draco used to laugh, though "giggle" might be a better word. Harry would care for him and consider it his honour; Harry would cherish him all the days they were blessed to be given; Harry would defend him with his life and love. So call Harry a fool and put the jester's hat on his head, he'll wear it with pride.  He'll be a fool for Draco's love anytime, anyplace, anywhere.  The difference is Harry could be happy with just your love, whole and well, yet chaos alone would kill me. One day Harry could find the right road, the one that leads to him home and pray the door will be open.
Harry couldn't stop the tears now, his eyes already beginning to sting with pain. His body trembled as he nodded, frowning hard.
Neville Longbottom, the nerdiest kid in school, crashed into Blaise Zabini, the kid who wants to be a wrestler.  Harry shut his eyes, scared to see what would happen to Neville.
Harry's hands venture over her curved body, exploring. They pull apart and open their eyes. They stare at each other, deep into each other's eyes. Harry's full of wonder and love, Draco's full of curiosity and passion.
They wouldn't dare look in my eyes.
––– fin.
Oh shit, he killed Draco Malfoy.
"You're boy's a pansy, Narcissa!"
"Draco? I made you coffee, sorry, I don't really know a hangover cure." A voice said, Draco instantly knew who it was.
"Aw, hell.  Long weekend for everybody!" Dumbledore said into the intercom, cheers were heard apart from three students.  Pansy Parkinson, Caitlyn Gold and Harry Potter.  The bell rang and they walked outside, where McGonagall yelled;
but I weep for all I failed to be.
"Do you have a girlfriend? I bet anyone would love to have someone as fit as you!" She smiled at Harry.
"Harry, what's in this? It tastes- disgusting...Like soap? Or- bleach!" At that, Draco fell off the bed, blue and red dripping out of his mouth.  Leaving Potter in a state of state and shock.  What happened? Did he mix up the cups or something?
"I'm telling you we all misjudged Draco Malfoy.  This is the loveliest suicide note I've ever read."
I've written countless suicide notes before some pages long, some barely a paragraph but I've never specified the root of my miseries. This is addressed to you but I want everyone who has known me to read this and become aware as I'm sure they'll assume and reach their own wrong conclusions.
"Draco? What are you doing in my room?"
"Slut!" The guy yelled back.
"Ah, Draco and Caitlyn"
It is an understatement to say that I'm disgusted with myself. What hatred people might feel for me pales in comparison to what I think of myself. As much as I love my friends with every fibre of my being, I hate myself with every atom that is myself.
Then, a boy walked through the doorway.  His clothing was red, a short skirt, knee high socks and a small jacket.  Harry had always had a crush on him, he was sex on legs.  His name was Draco Malfoy, the almighty.  His red lipstick made his lips look so kissable.  Harry blushed, the same shade as the Draco's socks.  He imagined a life where Draco liked him, too.  A life where Harry was popular, never harassed, a cute blonde swooning over him...
"Are you okay?" Draco asked, almost whispering.
"Fuck you, Potter.  You don't know anything about me.  You don't know about my family, I can't love you!"
"Nobody will ever replace Father.  Now, Harry and I will be leaving." Draco turned around, grabbed Harry and walked towards the classroom, ignoring Narcissa calling his name.  The two girls followed him, waving goodbye to his mother.
"I was alone, I was a frozen lake...But then you melted me awake - see, now I'm crying too. You're not alone and when the morning comes; we'll burn away that tear, and raise our city here." Harry sang, a tear slid down Draco's soft, pink face.  Potter stepped closer to him, Draco did the same.  "You know, Draco, I've liked you since kindergarten."
"I'll try..."
"Here comes the cootie squad." Pansy rolled her eyes.  "We should-"
I believe I'm a good person. You know, I think that there's good in everyone, but; here we are! First day of senior year! And... I look around at these kids that I've known all my life and I ask myself; what happened?'
He snapped out of his deep thoughts as he heard a firm knock against the door of his dorm. He already knew who it was, based off the way the pupil knocked. It was Harry.
"Hi Draco, I wasn't gonna come but since you took the time to write that sweet note..." Hermione smiled, tapping him on the shoulder.  He looked her up and down and snatched the note out of her hands, ripping it up.
Draco walked away, pushing through crowds of people.  He decided he was going to drink his thoughts away, swallow his worries.
How could he get out of this? He could pretend it was a suicide...Harry took out his notebook and wrote in cursive.
"Really? Cause I feel great!" Draco said, jumping and falling into Harry's arms.
"I'm not ready for that, Caitlyn.  Besides, my mother wouldn't approve."
"Why n-" Harry was cut off by a woman's voice.
"Before you answer, I also do report cards, permission slips and absence notes."
"Going to?"
"Lard-ass!"
Draco snapped Harry's window lock, climbing through the window and landing on the carpeted floor.
"Mum!" She cried, ripping off a wig and a blonde head of hair appeared.  The guests seemed startled,  confused and terrified.  "That- that was a mannequin, I faked my death! I was scared so I was going to change my name and..." He stopped, looking for his mother's reaction.  She burst into tears, running to where her son stood.
"It doesn't hurt as much as other spells." Draco reminded.
"No one sees the me inside of me." They said in unison.  They took the paper and put it in a plastic bag, deciding to give it to the school.
I am more than shoulder pads and makeup.
"I love you, Draco Malfoy.  I hope you can forgive me..."
No one sees the me inside of me.'
Maybe I can help the world by leaving;
"What? No!" Harry yelled back, regretting that the moment he did it.
Draco stared into Harry's eyes, knowing that the pain was tearing him apart but he couldn't feel it, he had made sure of that. Instead he just sat, patiently awaiting his demise, contemplating.
'Dear Diary,
"Mother, I'm going to be late for English.  Why are you even here?" Draco said rudely.
"How about prescriptions?" Pansy butted in.
"You're doing it wrong!" Caitlyn yelled, taking the cup off Pansy and doing it herself.
'No one thinks a pretty boy has feelings;
"And I want..." He lamented. "I want you to kill me."
"See, why did you call me that? I thought you loved me."  Everyone stared at Draco, waiting for an answer.
"You're a cunt, you know that?"
"Do you want to be more popular?"
"She lets you wear skirts." said Harry
"Uh, maybe Draco realized that in order to be happy he had to give up his power and the only way to do that was... death." He stuttered.
"Somebody hug me! Somebody fix me! Somebody save me! Send me a sign, God! Give me some hope, here! Something to live for!" The lights seemed to dim.  He heard the click-clack of high-heeled shoes.  A girl wearing yellow clothing entered the room, Pansy Parkinson.  She's head cheerleader, her dad is loaded - he sells engagement rings.  Next, another girl entered the room, Caitlyn Gold, also known as "The most beautiful".  She runs the yearbook, she's a matchmaker, her dad also paid for implants.
– Draco M̶a̶l̶f̶o̶y̶ Potter.
I learned to kiss boys with my tongue.'
"I see you're all listed.  Hurry up and get where you're going." At that, she walked out of the bathroom.  Leaving Harry with the trio.  Harry forced himself not to smirk as he stared at Draco's legs, so hot.  He bet if he touched them they'd be so smooth, so soft.  The blonde coughed.
"Harry? Am I at your house? Fuck, what happened?"
"- and a symmetrical face. If I took a meat cleaver down the center of your skull, I'd have matching halves. That's very important." She gave Harry the nod.  The nod which meant; my best friend totally has a crush on you and he definitely wants your cock up his arse so just go along with whatever he says.
"Harry...-- Harry, I'm so sorry." Draco spluttered, letting out a sob. Harry immediately, as though it were a reflex, wrapped his arms around his boyfriend; Draco's face pressed into his chest.
I hid behind smiles and crazy hot clothes;
"What did you say to me, skank?" Draco replied to him.
"Awh, you could've been my kindergarten boyfriend!" Malfoy joked as Harry held both his hands, kissing his knuckles.
Harry wondered into the house.  There were flashing lights, making him blind.  He looked around to try and find Draco.  Every room was utter chaos, ripped curtains, spilled drinks, people grinding against each other - what you would expect at a highschool party.  He turned the corner and saw Caitlyn and Blaise Zabini making out.
"I mean, I guess?"
"Jesus Christ!" Caitlyn cheered.
"Go on."
"I am more than just a source of handjobs." The other scanned the page.
"I don't, but I am talking to someone..." Harry glanced at Draco, who looked like he was going to pass out when he saw the pants.  Potter remembered how he went on a rant about how much he hated pants and that they made him feel trapped.
"Are you gay?"
My looks were just like prison bars;
"Woah! Is it murder?" The cop said, staring at Draco's dead body on the floor.
"Yes!" Draco grinned, throwing his arms around Harry.
'Dear world...
"What?" Harry thought this might've been just the last of the alcohol leaving his system.
Draco woke up with a massive headache.  As he slowly opened his eyes, he realized he wasn't at home, nor with Pansy.
Pansy gasped, covering her mouth with her hand.  Harry noticed that her hand looked a little more paler than usual.  Caitlyn whispered something into her ear and she stood up suddenly.
"Ow!" He screamed.  Potter stood up, closing his diary.  He was confused to say the least, everyone was singing.
"Yeah, I thought it would be funny.  Sorry, Narcissa.  I can take it off him now, if you like." She offered, placing her hand on Draco's shoulder.
I knew the way loneliness stung.
"Out of my way, geek!" Ron Weasley screamed at a poor girl.
" To whoever ends up reading this,
"So, where's the real Pansy?" Ron asked from the back row.  A woman wearing all black stood up, who turned out to be her.  Harry was awfully confused, why did nobody tell him?  His world had fallen apart for twenty-four hours and now, it was mended.  Harry stood up as Narcissa let go of her son.
who clings to his pillow and cries!
"Imagine the worst nightmare you've ever had, take a moment to recall it. Then imagine you were unable to wake up from it because you are already awake. All those bizarre ideas that make so much sense when you're asleep start to make sense with your eyes wide open. My brain is like... like an extinguished fire. Once it burnt bright and I knew of happiness and light; I could see a future... Now my mind is dark and ashy. I had so much hope, with my future with you. We were going to get married, have a family... But now, I'm going to--" Draco rambled, stopping himself in his tracks.
"Shh..." The drunk giggled and held his finger against Harry's lips. "Sorry, but I really had to wake you.  See; I decided I must ride you 'till I break you!" He winked at the boy, who was sitting on his bed with a million thoughts racing through his head.  "Mother says I've got to go, you're my last meal on death row."
"Deep down he wasn't cruel or vain - " Hermione said.
- Draco Malfoy x'
"We- we had sex! Oh my god, oh my god, you took my virginity! I lost my virginity while I was drunk to a hot looking guy.  Is this good or bad?"
"Look who's with her, oh my god." Caitlyn gasped, what was Harry doing?  The trio walked away, trying to find freshmen to bully.
"Please tell me." Harry stated, in an almost demanding tone.
The boy on the floor was lifeless. Lifeless. His blonde hair was scattered in multiple places. His gray eyes were wide open, but his jade irises held a sudden sadness. His clothes, a dark, black robes with hints of green, were covered in the potion. Almost seeming as though Draco had tried to spit it out. His body was slumped over, half-sitting, half-laying on the cold floor. It almost looked like he was just sleeping. Harry's heart pounded as one question continued to race through my mind: Why did he do this? Harry held the lifeless body in his arms, unable to do anything else. He would've killed for one more minute.  Please, Merlin, just one more minute.  Draco's body was still so warm, he thought that there would be a slight possibly that he was still alive.  Perhaps his poor potions skills could've helped for once? Harry just waited and waited, minutes turning into hours.  He just sat there in silence, wanting something to happen.  Draco's body eventually turned cold, his face becoming violently blank.  This damaged Harry so fucking much.  He wanted to leave, but he couldn't move.  His body trembled.  He didn't even know what to do with the body; he couldn't just leave it there, that would be disrespectful.  Harry never, ever wanted to let go.
my pumps and my flats, my three TVs!'
"I told you not to call me that, pots and pans.  I suppose he could, he's already too unnaturally attractive - I mean - he already looks okay." He said, looking into the mirror and applying mascara to his eyes.  Harry grinned, maybe he'd get the life he wanted after all?
"You know, Harry, I think I'm actually in love with you." Draco admitted.
"I told you I'm not ready for that, Potter." He screamed.
"I swear, I'll try.  But you know I hate being bossed around, doll-face."
"Holy crap! This is awesome!" Pansy said, wiping her tears.  She knew Draco would be proud of her.
"I never knew about his pain." Caitlyn said between whimpers.
"But he's made us better than we were. Draco's dead, but he will live inside me, and I'll be the me inside of him..." They all sang, looking at the sky.
He knew he shouldn't be dreaming about killing everyone, but each dream had been so deliciously sweet. Making their blood run until their flesh was ghostly, cold, had filled him with such exquisite pleasure.  Everyone gets dehumanized, Harry, everyone. It can be for your race, gender, age, education, religion... so many reasons. But here's the rub, the real one: teaching us to dehumanize one another induces psychopathy into us. It takes normal folks and makes them not care if others live or die. We aren't born to be that way, we aren't. The creator gives us a soul of pure love so that we can hold on to truth and honour. We are supposed to fight back, stay noble, be kind, think critically and be brave. The only other option is to be complicit in psychopathy with our eyes open; if you do that, my love, not even he can save you. Being the angel of your better nature is your only true defence, there is no manual for this stuff, there can't be one. Psychopaths subvert written rules, yet the power of love is creative and flexible; that's how we win. That's how we were always going to win.
"For a nobody, you're really hot- I mean, you have good bone structure." Draco looked away awkwardly, Harry raised his eyebrow confidently.  He had got Draco into submission.  Caitlyn pushed Draco out of the way and looked at the boy.
"I mean, yes? What do you mean?" He asked, giving a lunch tray to Caitlyn.
"Bug-eyes!"
"Wh-"
"I did it on my free will, Miss.  I don't mind." He said.
Donate my car to crippled kids, or to those ghetto moms on crack.
No one gets his insecurity.
"Draco! What's wrong with you?"
"Why not?"
"I...I wanted an excuse to kiss him."
"My mum's dead and yes, my dad is home."
He stood in front of Draco, who looked at him confused.  He leaned in...
"Draco Malfoy is not your everyday suicide, we should cancel classes." Snape offered, staring at Dumbledore.
"You're gonna die at three PM!" Dean Thomas chimed in, pushing her into another group of people.
"Thank you, McGonagall. Call me when the shuttle lands." Dumbledore laughed along with Snape, but this was no laughing matter
"Blurh!"
'Crush' was such an infantile word, one that must have been invented by older folks, the ones with an interest in belittling young love. Draco hated it. He didn't have a crush on Harry, he loved him with the passion hotter than a thousand suns. He was the one. He knew it. He was all that was in Draco's mind; he was his true north, his everything. One day they were supposed prove everyone wrong, run away together, start a family of their own. But now, he couldn't. Today was the day Draco would admit the truth to Harry, about Voldemort's wishes.
"Yeah, I wanna do that more." Harry said, watching as Draco drank the coffee.
And Harry woke up. It hit him hard. Draco's final words like nails and hammers breaking Harry's heart apart. Today didn't even feel real. A nightmare come true, maybe. He found myself waiting to wake up. But that never happened. Harry just cried and cried. He cried out to God, Merlin, whoever was out there; wondering how it was possible for Draco to inflict so much pain inside his chest. Harry was alone. Completely, utterly alone, without Draco to comfort him. Who will wipe away his tears now? Who will hold his hand? Who will surprise him with hugs from behind? Who will tell him they love him and call him handsome? Not Draco. Not anyone anymore. Harry now lacked that someone who had been with me for over a year. That same someone who promised me a forever only to get killed. By Harry! And now Draco's gone. Gone like the ink leaving Harry's pen as he writes his heart out onto parchment. Did anyone else cry at all? Did it hurt them at all... when Draco was found dead? When they saw the warm blood on Harry's hands? After Harry explained to them why he had done it? They got him food. They took him back to his dorm. Harry let them look after him that night. The night when it happened. Oh, the night before the manslaughter was traumatic. Draco kissed him that night. He told him he loved him that night. Harry still worried for him, even though he was in Heaven now. Harry wished the best for him. Harry just wants Draco to have happiness again, even if that means Harry has to sacrifice his own. Potter would have done anything for Malfoy, you know? He loved him. Harry wants to be the very best for Draco. He was the very best for him, but now he wasn't there to watch over him anymore. Maybe that's what hurts the most.  He had went to Draco's dorm immediately after his friends had found him, sobbing.  He had tried to find comfort, but Malfoy's words were far more relaxing whilst spoken instead of read.
"You're the one I chose..."
"Draco..." Harry said breathlessly. "I want to wake up to your beautiful face every morning, you mean the world to me and without you I-" He looked Draco in the eyes. "I would be nothing.  Draco Malfoy, will you be my boyfriend?"
I've done many unthinkable and unspeakable things in the 16 years of my life. Even, as much as I'm ashamed to admit.  But the worst, by far, is the fact that I murdered the love of my life. I couldn't even attend his funeral. I can't go on living like this. The guilt is too much to bear. I'm afraid there will be others who'll become subjects to my twisted being if I don't disappear. I want to kill everyone I see; that's the reason I haven't left Draco's dorm.  Everytime I think about anybody, I think of a way to kill them.  Hermione? I'll drown her in the Great Lake. Ron? I'll drug his dinner and use a chainsaw to cut up all his limbs.  I believe no form of help can change me, no amount of medication can control my urges. There is no sickness within me because I'm the disease itself. With my passing, I'm doing the whole world a big favour-- ridding it of a depressed, homicidal sociopath.
