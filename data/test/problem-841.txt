I would have liked to edit it a little more, but screw it, happy Easter to those who celebrate, and a happy weekend to those who don’t xxx
It was a long and drawn-out moment before Draco finally did as he asked, his head rising slowly to reveal bleary eyes and a trembling bottom lip.
The Alpha’s eyes flashed suddenly, his lips curling into a smile as he chimed in over Draco’s stumbled words.
“Well, it seems there’s nothing wrong, the blood is nothing to worry about in this case– it can sometimes happen in the early stages. Still, we'll need to keep an eye on it over the next coming months to be safe.”
Draco asked, a hand coming up to rest under his chin, his attention now fully on the Beta. Ron’s smile faltered a little as he let out a small sigh.
Harry continued, moving both his and Draco’s wands up high, holding them side-by-side under the glint of the full moon peeking through the mauve drapes.
When he finally saw it he blanched, his trembling fingers rushing to the spot and brushing up against the wet material.
The sound of Harry’s knife and fork scraping against his plate was torturous, and Draco groaned at the back of his throat.
When Mrs Malfoy had warned him of her son’s demeanour, Harry hadn’t really believed the boy would pose much of a challenge. He had worked with teenagers before, from the down beaten beta following the wrong path, to the worst of the alpha delinquents the purebloods had thrown at him.
Draco sighed wearily as he pushed around his scrambled eggs, not missing the look that passed between Hermione and Ron.
Borsk’s voice broke through Draco’s muddled thoughts, the brashness of it yanking him to the forefront of his mind. Draco looked down to where the healer’s eyes were, his own eyes widening in shock when he saw an amber light emerging from his belly.
Draco scowled, rolling his eyes and turning away from Ron as he tried to save his hair, hiding the flush that ran up his neck.
Someone was coming into his room, someone whose scent sent a fresh wave of panic roaring through his body.
The Beta mumbled under his breath, his scent spiking with a bristling agitation. It went straight to Draco’s head, the heavy smell wafting over to him quickly and encumbering his concentration. The Omega grit his teeth, pressing his body further into the wall to keep his stance strong.
Of course, his father, Lucius, had been the same— he too had been taught from a young age by his own parents to control his scent.
Draco let Blaise’s fingers stray down to the curve of his ass before he finally pushed the alpha off with a smirk.
He murmured, reaching his fingers out to graze softly across Harry’s cheek... Harry could barely feel it, yet somehow the heat of the boy’s body infiltrated every single cell in his body, calling out to him in a cruel and crippling song.
”You can tell me anything, Draco, you don’t have to be afraid to talk to me, ever. I want you to think of me as a safe place.”
“Alright lad, I need you to answer some questions while the potion takes effect, then we can see what we’re dealing with here.”
“My daughter, Rose, is around your age, she graduated Hogwarts a few years back and she’s now training to be an Alchemist. I heard that that is an interest of yours as well, Draco?”
Borsk grunted, pulling open his briefcase and swiftly uncorking the stopper of a moss-green potion bottle.
Draco sighed, pushing himself to his feet, leaving his bag behind and following the direction that the Alpha had disappeared in. The room he entered was much like the last; simple, dated… and oddly cosy. So different to the dark looming walls of Malfoy Manor.
for it, his stomach grumbling noisily as he made his way into the dining room, blushing when both Hermione and Ron dropped their jaws at his arrival.
She said happily, a zing in her step as she opened the door and left him with one last wide smile... then she was gone.
, Harry had tried to give the boy space, only to knock on his door a few hours later and check on him. Draco never answered him and the door was of course locked, so he decided the best course of action was to just leave him alone for the night.
What do we think? 👀 I’m not the biggest fan of this chapter just because it gave me such a hard time, but I hope it was ok on your end! I feel like my writing has been really lacking lately and I’m a big ball of insecurities right now— so please ignore my ramblings, it’s late and I still haven’t packed lol 😩
“It doesn’t matter. You crossed a line, darling, and the Ministry was all too happy to have a Malfoy’s head on the chopping block.”
Yes I may or may not have used a little wand-penis joke. When I was googling Draco and Harry’s wands I saw that Harry’s was supposed to be an extra inch longer then Draco’s. Forgive me, I couldn’t resist 🤧
Hermione asked, her voice flickering with a note of concern. This wasn’t the first time she had asked him, and it most likely wouldn’t be the last. It had been almost two weeks since
His mother used to touch him, but not often. His father, of course, would never, especially after Draco had presented… like he would catch some kind of disease from his Omega son.
“To tutor you, yes, but you’re going to be a part of our family during your stay here, Draco, and everyone has to pitch in, which includes
Draco gave an embarrassed nod before he grabbed the forgotten banana and started peeling it, asking Ron how he wanted it prepared.
But, no. He couldn’t do that, because that would be the end of his life here for good. Harry had reminded him of that before he left, had given him the choice to choose, as if he already knew what Draco would do.
He patted down his robes, turning to grab his case so he could drag it in front of him before settling himself on the floor with a huff, his eyes scanning the empty room.
She smiled when her son looked up at her abruptly, his wide eyes suddenly so young, suddenly so alike the child he was not so long ago.
Draco cut her off, his voice cold and quiet, his throat already constricting at the scent of that man on the witch he had come to adore.
I’m soooo sorry about the wait 😭 After the last chapter I actually got a new full time job— which, in itself, ate up a
“Can you make him a potion? It would kill him to miss dinner tonight, we were going to try a new recipe for dessert.”
The night continued on easily after that, a strange warmness nestling around the trio as they ate, casual conversation commencing shortly after. The uneasy tension between Ron and Draco had mostly dissipated, much to the boy’s relief, his heart now beating at a steady pace for the first time that night.
He already felt uneasy in this room, with this boy, without a scent to attach to him. Harry didn’t know how he had smelt him that day of their first meeting, not when he had just sat through an entire dinner with him and not picked up a whisperer of a scent at all.
Harry was dressed within a matter of minutes before he hastily transported himself to Hermione and Ron’s place, his breath coming fast and heavy as he called out to the witch.
There was a long and stunned silence before Harry finally snarled out a curse, his chair screeching back as he grabbed Draco roughly by the wrist, a growl rumbling through his chest as he manhandled him into the corner and shoved him down by his shoulders, grabbing his wand.
“He won’t be aggressive, it won’t be like that, he’s promised that it was an honest mistake… and that is the only reason why I’m letting him back into my house, kid, understood?”
, recklessly so, and if Harry didn’t nip that in the bud right at the start, it was going to take a lot longer than a few months before Harry was out of this shithole… and
What do we think? Things are about to get crazy me thinks 👀 any guesses on what’s to come next? What’s Ron gonna do? ✨
Hermione started, smiling at Draco in encouragement when he shuffled on the spot awkwardly, not knowing whether she was actually genuinely interested or if she was just trying to make conversation.
, and after that, Draco would be sent to his room to do his revisions for what he had learned that day… before washing up and going to bed.
Draco asked, stabbing his fork through the creamy pasta before he brought it to his mouth, his eyebrows raising when the taste hit him.
Ron suddenly said, his voice unusually gentle, his eyes shining. Draco held his gaze, his gut twisting again.
The Alpha’s face split into a wide smile at that, and Draco had a hard time trying to keep himself from getting sucked into it. Had anyone ever smiled at him like that before?
The witch giggled, petting him fondly before commanding him to sit over in the corner of the room. He did, his tail drooping a fraction as he followed the orders.
as he watched the Alpha flail on the ground, like a fish that had been pulled from the sea and left to die on the sand.

“Umm...yeah, yes please. That would be a good idea considering I’ve been in various states of undress around muggles,” Harry agrees, to which Aby just frowned remembering the club.
"I take it fairly often so that way if I get too drunk I don't have to manage apparating. Also some blokes don't live close to the venues I go to and they seem to be worth a tube ride for a shag," he chuckles, and reminds Potter how to get a fare card.
"No I don't throw people into foursomes without asking permission first. Besides, I think my friend, Liam, is starting to get serious with their boyfriend so best not intrude on that. And you aren't awkward. You chatted up the bloke at the bar last time I saw you pretty easily," he points out.
Getting up to stretch, Harry walks over to the mirror and examines his side, admiring the art that now adorans him. “Oh Aby...it’s beautiful. I can’t wait to fill it in. This is going to look incredible.”
Harry can’t help but wish it’s him being given attention like that, but in an effort not to ruin another chance at lust for Aby he meanders off to find something to do on his own.
“And don’t you even think for one second that you’re a burden. I’m getting paid handsomely to be your new tutor, and with my daughter gone, you’re helping a poor mother with her empty-nest-syndrome.”
Ron grinned, raising a hand to ruffle the Omega’s hair. Ron knew Draco hated it, knew he always spent at least half an hour in front of the mirror fixing it into a perfectly imperfect style that required more attention than it was supposed to appear… and Draco hated how much he liked it. How much he liked the older man’s hands in his hair.
The whole room filled with the obscene sounds of flesh slapping against flesh, Harry’s grunting matching the Omega’s own pleasure-soaked cries.
Draco said, his face mirroring Hermione’s own expression. She quietly moved forward, setting the wooden tray carefully on his lap, plumping a pillow behind his back so that he could sit forward comfortably.
Draco just cocked his head to the side in mock confusion, stabbing the soaked pancake with his fork and ripping off a piece to shove in his mouth.
Draco seemed to stiffen under him for a brief second before he was struggling again, letting out a frustrated growl when his efforts proved fruitless.
Harry scoffed, holding himself back from stepping towards the boy, not even sure where that odd impulse had come from.
Draco nodded in understanding, his shoulders relaxing a little. His eyes dropped to his feet as he thought back on what Hermione had said this morning.
“We don’t expect you do a lot, really, we just want you to help out a little, do your part, you know? Our Rose is a good girl and she happily tended to the animals when she was here, never once complained. She’d spend all day with the horses if she could, she loves horses…”
Hermione just chuckled, too used to his games, one hand coming to rest under her chin as the other reached out and tapped him on the nose teasingly.
“In the eyes of the law, Draco, you’re still a child. An omega isn’t considered an adult until the age of twenty-five years, and you’ve only just turned nineteen, you little brat. So, like it or not, you’re under my care now. I would advise you to be very careful not to push me anymore.”
The Beta said gruffly, shifting an unimpressed gaze to Hermione. The Alpha frowned at her mate, shaking her head quickly before looking back to Draco.
The Alpha roared victoriously into his Omegas throat as he came, sinking his teeth into the tender skin of the boy’s scent glad.
Draco hadn’t noticed that his hair was no longer in the man’s grasp, only realising when his head slumped and the man’s eyes were no longer in his line of vision.
Draco was dressed to the nines, his delicate frame dazzling in a shining silver blouse that seemed to flow down over his shoulders like a molten waterfall. The shirt was tucked in at his middle where a pair of high-waisted black leather shorts fit snugly over his hips.
That was the worst of it all, that unsheathed feeling of something other than terror cutting through his defences. It made him feel dirty…
The Beta had tried a few things, the supportive friend, the warm father figure, the overly happy uncle… today it seemed he was trying out a crisp strict-dad routine.
Hermione scoffed, and Draco was too preoccupied with his food to bother asking what a microwave even was.
She said carefully, her eyes crinkling in a small smile as she gave his hand one last reassuring squeeze and let go. Draco cleared his throat, blinking quickly when he felt that humiliating sting prickle at his eyes.
Draco murmured, shakey hands clasping firmly over his knife and fork before he looked up at the Alpha.
. Each new breath filling his lungs with the sweet scent still permeating off the creature he had claimed. Harry smiled with a hum, nuzzling into the boy’s slender neck and pressing his nose to his newly marked scent glad.
Hermione stepped forward, quickly pulling Draco into a hug which strangely, he seemed to sink into, a strained sigh escaping his lips at the contact.
“Anyway, ah, we’ll try you on a few different chores, and you can see what you like most. It doesn’t have to be something you hate, we’d prefer it if you could enjoy your time here.”
She smiled, one hand drifting up to tuck a stray strand behind his ear, smiling when he didn’t try to stop her.
Draco’s scream vibrated against the floorboards that his face had been pushed into, his body jerking as his Alpha lapped at the wound, a bitter-sweet tang of blood flooding into Harry’s mouth.
Someone was yelling but he didn’t know who, and soon insistent hands were tugging at him, leading him over to the warmth of the lounge room fire. He was sat down on a chair and covered in a blanket, and even after he mumbled something about ruining the couch, gentle fingers continued to brush through his hair.
, younger than Harry had anticipated, with a shock of snow-fallen hair that fell just above his shoulders.
It hit Draco like a punch to the stomach, that look, transported him back to two months ago when Ron had looked at him with barely hidden distaste, that same look of worry directed at Hermione, as if to say, ‘
Draco raised his eyebrows, reaching out to grasp the cup, cautiously bringing it to his lips before taking a weary sip. It was good, really good, and strangely refreshing after such a big meal.
Draco had never seen another man’s genitals before, only his own flaccid cock that he had peered at sometimes in the shower, itching to touch himself out of sheer curiosity to see how it felt, but never ever indulging the thought.
His skin was burning by the time he turned the water off, the inside of his thighs scrubbed raw and his usual pallid complexion now a blushing pink.
“Great, you’re done with the walls. I’m going to start on the painting, I picked up this really lovely colour a while ago.
“Of course, dear, you’ve had a big day. I’ve sent your bag to your room and there’s a towel on your bed if you want to take a shower. Let us know if you need anything at all.”
He said, bringing his glass to his lips and taking a large gulp, letting the liquid sit in his throat for a moment before he swallowed. He flicked a glance to Draco before his eyes met Hermione’s again, pulling on another warm smile.
He didn’t reply or turn back to look at her, and with a sinking feeling of unease, the Alpha walked out of the room, gently closing the door behind her.
The Alpha slung an arm around the boy’s waist, chest against back, each laboured breath mirrored by the other.
Draco sneered, grabbing at the suitcase that was currently being hauled away by a skittish house-elf, only to hurl the bag right into his bedroom wall. The case crashed with a deafening sound, flinging open with a crack and spilling the contents across the plush carpet.
He sniffled, wiping his face with the back of his arm, closing his eyes briefly as he curled up on his side, his bottom lip trembling.
He slowly made his way to the chickens, checking their water trough and feeder before he threw in the food scraps. He left the bin there to collect on his way back and started the long hike to the stables.
, better than good, better than amazing. It was like a heavy weight he hadn’t even know had been holding him down, suddenly lifted… and he was floating.
orders that I follow, not yours. She has left you in my capable hands, so you will listen to me now and you will listen well.”
Harry asked softly, pulling away from her so that he could see her face. She had stopped crying, which was a good start.
When Harry had gotten this gig, he had assumed that he had signed up for a recluse omega teenager in need of a little guidance. He hadn’t exactly thought to heed the woman’s warning.
I’m so sorry about the updates delay! I had my dad visiting and could not find the time to sneak away and write 🤧
, Ron, of course I insisted, but he was quite adamant that he didn’t want one. I can’t exactly force him to take it, can I?”
“Oh, don’t sound so surprised. I can’t cook as well as Ron, but I can still boil a jug of water and use a microwave.”
He poured them both a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, then magicked the steaming plate of fluffy pancakes over to the table, along with two sets of cutlery and plates for them both.
“I was just surprised, that’s all, and his scent is… it’s just so, it’s disgusting, so, you know I’m sensitive to that…”
His pants were pulled down swiftly, hot skin greeting the chilly morning air, Harry’s fingers soft and insistent as they ran down the curve of a cheek and started to spread him open.
That didn’t buy him more than a wasted second though and the alpha was quick to pull his flailing body back, fingers winding around Draco’s throat once more.
By the time Harry had made it back to his room, it had already been a good few hours. Ron had been late, which didn’t exactly
Breakfast was lingering in the air when he finished, and for the first time in a long time… Draco was
The man growled then, harsh fingers winding into Draco’s pale hair and painfully yanking him up by the roots.
let Ron into his room, he couldn’t let either of them into this place. What if it changed them too? What if Ron could
She sighed, a heavy silence filling the room as her scent spiked in an uncomfortable sorrow. She spoke again, her voice once more back to her sing-song tone.
She went to fuss over his now rumpled clothes, but Draco shrugged out of her grip quickly, her uninhibited scent already clinging to him and turning his stomach.
I hope you liked the chapter, I had a really small window today to write and post this so I hope it’s alright!
When the Alpha had walked in, it had taken all of his strength not to turn on his heel and run out of the room. He
“I noticed… that some of my special ingredients from the cupboard are missing, kid, do you know anything about that?”
Harry’s nose wrinkled as something unpleasant drifted through the fog that had captured his brain, something misplaced in the honeyed air… something
His parents were both Alphas, as were all of his tutors, but it was custom in Malfoy Manor— as in most esteemed families— to subdue one’s scent. Lucius never stood for anyone carelessly releasing their pheromones, it was, after all, the absolute height of incivility.
*Warning* a quick reminder to please please reread the tags if you need ♥️ It’s not too late to turn back now xx
Ron sighed, straightening up and stretching out his shoulders before he started walking back to the house, motioning for Draco to follow.
Harry’s fingers suddenly grasped his hair, twisting his head to the front and rolling Draco’s body over so that he was once again on his back.
Harry murmured, flicking his gaze over to the omega, watching him wearily as the boy pulled out a chair and sat himself down.
Once they were alone, the Healer pushed the potion bottle to Draco’s lips, not giving him a chance to pull away.
Draco cut her off, yanking himself out of her arms as he looked up at her wildly, his teeth clenching at the disappointment in her eyes.
Draco’s mind was a merciful blank, and he stayed lax in Harry’s arms as he was carried up the stairs and into his room. He was then dropped softly on his bed and Harry quickly pulled the covers up over him before he tucked it around his body.
“Your parents told us what happened, Draco. I’m so very sorry you had to go through all that. No matter what happened in the past, no child should be subjected to that kind of treatment.”
Then, he would probably dream of pumpkin-butterbeer soup and wait until his father threw him at the next available Alpha.
Before Draco could even blink, his body was suddenly grabbed by an invisible force and dragged into the room, thrown down at the feet of a large Alpha.
“Hard on whom, mother? I’m the one being shipped off to some fucking half-bloods farm while you and father make merry with the rest of bloody London!”
The Alpha growled lowly as the scent of it lingered in his nostrils, interrupting the smell of his mate resting in his arms… only…
Harry just smiled, his eyes drifting over the panting Omega, his gaze dropping to the boy’s plump pink lips, catching the way they parted ever so slightly with each laboured breath.
She assured him, her mouth twisting up in a gentle smile as her eyes grazed across the young Omega’s frozen body, his expression oddly pained.
Sorry its been so long, I've been in such a funk lately and I haven't been able to write anything. At all. Nada.
Draco’s mind continued to reel, the entirety of what had just happened swimming through his head in a swirling fog. The more he tried to make sense of it, the less
— plagued with horrible symptoms like nausea and weakness. It wasn’t deadly, but it wasn’t for the fainthearted either.
… he... they weren’t even close! That kind of scent-marking wasn’t something you did with a practical
Draco asked, the disbelief evident in your tone. Ron just shrugged, leaning against the barn with a yawn.
“Ah, well, I think that’s a story for another day, dear. Let’s just get you settled for now. Feel free to make yourself comfortable, you can take a nap if you like and I’ll call you when dinner is ready. Ron’s cooking tonight, and he’s surprisingly brilliant at it.”
”There’s only one reason why those two ingredients would be used together, Draco, and I just don’t understand why? Why would you do it? Why make yourself sick like that? How long has this been going on, since the start? Have you hated being here that much— that you would actually—“
All sense of reason evaporated into the honeyed air as instinct coursed through his veins, reaching every cell, capturing every fibre of his being.
The Alpha leapt forward with a growl, strong fingers instantly reaching out to wrap around the Omega’s right ankle before he dragged him back.
He said, trying to keep the agitation out of his tone. From Hermione’s expression, he hadn’t been so successful.
. Before he even knew it, he was back in the corner again, face to the wall with his mouth shut and his body frozen into position.
tight it felt like he was simultaneously trying to push him out and suck him back in. The Alpha roared as he felt himself coming to his end, a coursing rage of pleasure so strange and unique it felt like it was ripping him apart.
At first, he thought it was Ron or Hermione making their way into the kitchen for a drink of water… but the sound of the footsteps weren’t familiar at all, too heavy to be the witch… too even to be the Beta’s.
When he was done, he groaned, leaning back in his chair to relieve some of the pressure in his belly. Had he ever been that full before in his life?
He fought it, a rising panic prickling up his spine as he tried to wriggle away, ignoring the sharp flash of pain that warned him to keep still, holding him, stretching him wide and leaving him filled.
Draco stared out into the darkness, his breathing coming out strained as his mind tried to sluggishly string his thoughts together into something coherent.
He dropped his eyes, his shoulders slumping as a sudden tiredness overtook him, his anger sizzling back down into the pit of his stomach, replaced now by an overwhelming helplessness.
He had only been here for two months now, but even that had gone too fast. He knew that eventually, two months would turn into three, then four, and before he knew it, his year would be finished and he would leave this place forever.
His eyes flashed alert as he quickly scrambled back on his bed, clutching his blanket impossibly closer as memories of the morning flooded back inside his head.
Hermione’s freighted voice rang out, instantly making him turn quickly on the spot and flick his gaze over his trousers.
A chill ran down Draco’s back and more slick started to trickle down his legs, making him squeeze his thighs together desperately, as if that would stop it.
"You want me more. I don't believe you when you say I don't mean anything, I do and you know it. There is another way here Harry,
They were barely out of the door when they were suddenly in Harry's private room and Draco barely had time to understand that Harry had apparated them inside the castle before Harry was driving him to the ground, a hand painfully twisting in his hair. "Who do they think they are?"
Training with his mom was much easier. They sat together, heads nearly touching as she went over some details with him, and when she explained how to control himself it made so much sense.
Harry sat on the other side of the room, watching them, but really his attention was on the senior Malfoy who stood on the opposite side, moving between glaring at Draco and glaring at him. Only when Harry wasn't looking though, the minute he glanced that direction the older man looked away, pretending something caught his attention.
He knew that the shock showed on his face, he had always heard that Harry Potter knew nothing of magic before he came, but he hadn't really believed. Not when it would have meant that someone that was brand new to magic bested him when he had been studying since he could remember. "It won't fix anything Harry."
Harry had been set on sucking on Draco's neck and didn't pay the question much attention, "Yeah." He tried to go back to what he was doing but Draco raised one hand to touch his shoulder, pulling it away quickly as he looked away.
"More, please, more." He wasn't even sure if Harry understood him, wasn't sure if he was even really saying the words, but he let his body rock in time with Harry's movements, hoping that would be invitation enough.
To be honest he was surprised the gentleness lasted as long as it had as suddenly Harry let go of his waist to grab at his hair with both hands, fisting it. It jerked his head backwards and he whimpered and struggled for a moment, but all it did was make it hurt more so he finally settled.
Draco had barely gained his equilibrium when Harry was on top of him, his hard dick rubbing against his ass, and lubed fingers pushing roughly into him. He couldn't help the squeal, it had been awhile since they had sex and he wasn't ready for it. Harry chuckled at the sound, fingers twisting until they pressed against that spot that had Draco wantonly shoving backwards, body writhing.
Draco stuffed down his anxiety, instead dragging his best ‘Lucius Malfoy’s smile-that-wasn’t-really-a-smile’ onto his face, before swishing around swiftly and marching into the dining room.
He was suffocating on the artificial aroma of a fruit he usually didn’t care for, but it was better than the thick and heady scent of that
Ron asked, suddenly walking forward out of Draco’s reach and into the room. Draco slunk back behind the door frame and out of sight as he heard Ron take the mystery visitor into a hug, both men chuckling fondly at each other.
“I don’t care… if he, if you both want to see him it’s fine by me, he should just be more careful with his scent, or whatever.”
Draco tried to pull his face away but that only made Harry's grip tighten. They stared each other down for a heated moment, neither of them giving in until finally, Draco let slip a soft chuckle, a flicker of amusement settling in his gaze.
… feel the mess between his legs. One of his hands reached down before he could stop it, his fingers grazing across something wet.
He could smell the change in her scent, the calming wave of Alpha pheromones that instantly eased his nerves and made him sigh. He hated when she did that.
They had done that a lot, that look, so much so that Draco had to try and just tune it out… otherwise he truly
Sometimes when Hermione gave him one of those searching looks, he was so painfully tempted to spill his guts, to tell her everything that had happened… so that she could fix this.
He scowled, the earlier heat in his voice from before simmering to a low flame, his body moving down Draco’s form until he was just above his crotch.
It made her upset, to imagine a child devoid of the very thing that was imperative to their development.
Draco frowned, his hand reaching up slowly to touch his cheek, jolting when he felt a wetness there. He was crying.
Harry snarled, his teeth sinking into the boy’s ear with a growl. Draco didn’t seem to even notice, his body strangely slumped against the wall, his weight only held up by Harry’s own heavy form.
But, that didn’t stop Harry’s clothes from smelling like him, the heavy royal-blue coat that Hermione had taken for him so strongly stinking of Alpha, Draco had wondered if he had somehow managed to inject his scent into every fibre.
Harry growled, his lip twitching when Draco just chuckled softly, picking up his fork again and digging in.
Ron nodded absently as he checked over his stock again, before he finally shut the cupboard with a sigh.
It was only really when the adrenaline finally stopped coursing through his system and the heavy hand of sleep threatened to pull him under, did he
Rubeus panted, his tongue rolling out the side of his mouth as he padded in front of him and dropped down between Draco’s legs, his big head resting on his left knee.
He said cheerily, ignoring Harry’s look as he moved a single pancake to his plate and started spreading butter over it, before dousing it with a generous serving of golden syrup.
Harry was quick, using his larger frame to hold the Omega down, his scent swirling around him, unleashed like a vicious rapture…
What the fuck was wrong with him? He could already feel the shocked faces of Hermione and Ron staring at him, the weight of a heavy atmosphere crushing his ribcage with every steady breath.
Draco gasped, stumbling back when he saw the man who had haunted his every waking nightmare standing in front of him.
Draco started to struggle then, using what little he had left of his strength to yank himself away, the force of it surprising the Alpha enough that he let go, his answering roar melding with Draco’s own cry when the half-deflated knot was ripped from his hole.
He heard Draco’s soft footsteps coming down the stairs and he straightened his back before turning to meet him.
When there was no more food to bring, Ron, at last, came back with a cooling pad, awkwardly handing it to Draco with a kind smile.
Hermione sighed, narrowing her eyes at her mate in warning before directing her gaze back to Draco. She seemed to notice Draco’s blooming unease, his distress seeping through his well-guarded scent. Before she could say anything, Draco spoke up, his tone clipped to keep his voice from wavering.
The alpha paused for a moment, standing over the omega for a beat longer before he finally turned and walked out of the room without another word, closing the door quietly behind him.
should learn some manners, Mr Potter, it’s not very cordial to offer a gift only to take it back again.”
Before the woman could finish, Draco was bowled over by a huge mass of teeth and fur. Before he could even scream though, the beast had been pulled off him, the creature whining sadly as Hermione held it’s collar taut, effectively keeping them both separated from the trembling Draco.
Hermione finally answered, wringing her hands together as an awkward silence followed. She finally continued on when she realised Draco wasn’t going to say anything.
Draco sang, blowing a kiss in a quick farewell before he skipped out of the room, swinging his hips as he did, his ass swaying just so inline of Harry’s vision.
the sound of his claws scratching softly at his door almost giving Draco a heart attack at the time.
“Don’t apologise. I have no shame about my past. I loved my parents and they loved me. That’s all you can really hope for when you’re growing up.”
Draco snipped, the edge in his voice all but swallowed by an artless moan that escaped from his lips when Harry’s other hand rubbed circles across his back.
He almost jumped when he heard a small whine carry under the gap of the door then, his heart stuttering for a beat before he shuffled around and opened it enough for Rubeus to slip through.
Draco blinked, clutching the blanket closer to his body, the scent of Harry’s piss now all through his sheets.
Ron asked, flicking his head to the side when Draco didn’t move. The Beta bumped his shoulder playfully, making Draco blink out of his daze and look up at the older man.
Just as Draco had commanded, Harry had hidden his scent, amazingly well, for someone who wasn’t from a pureblood line.
Ron had made Draco follow him around the whole damn property, showing him the wheat fields and rolling emerald hills before he toured them both around a small heard of noisy sheep and smelly goats.
Harry started, his grip on the Omega’s wrists tightening again in warning when he had started to move once more. He didn’t miss the flash of fear that took the boys eyes, but it was gone in an instant, replaced only by that same glare.
The Alpha breathed in a satisfied breath, rolling his shoulders back as he smirked at the trembling boy bowed down at his feet.
Narcissa shushed him easily, her hand once more coming up to comb through his hair. She was going to miss that.
Hermione chirped happily, glancing at Ron who was still watching him in barely hidden shock. The Beta stood up quickly, his chair scraping across the floor.
“It’s stopped.” Draco leaned against the back wall of the Cabinet, then let himself slide down it until he was sitting on its floor. He picked up the cup, which was empty again, and looked at Harry. “I love you, Harry,” he said, and looked expectantly into the cup. His face shuttered in pain. “It fills for you,” he said. “Not me.”
“Oh?” Draco wiped at his wet face and tried to remember if this were something he was supposed to know. His hands were still shaking and he felt entirely lost.
to like them, I don’t want to do this with you.” Potter sat all the way up, running a hand through his hair in agitation. “I spent the first half of my life with people who didn’t really want me, people who were made to be with me because something terrible would happen to them if they didn’t. And I can’t--” he shook his head.
Draco could have said if it were still Sunday, when he was lying in Harry's arms in the Lumi hotel, wrapped in Harry's love and protection and magic. That had been his life, his real life. For one brief hour, before everything went to hell.
"I never would have thought it," his father said slowly, as if it hurt to speak. "My own son, attempting to dethrone me in the most cowardly way possible."
Sirius grinned right back and took a long swallow of tea, biscuit and all. “Not to mention that you stink like a distillery. What have you been getting up to, Moony?”
“Draco? It’s okay just like this. This is so fucking good.” Harry moved his hand, his knuckles brushing against Draco’s arse as Harry took hold of himself, wrapping a hand around himself to keep from thrusting. “I love how you feel on my cock,” Harry said, his voice hoarse and low. “You feel so good around my cock. Draco. Just like this, I...Oh fuck, I’m so close already, I--” He broke off, his face tensing in an effort to stave off his orgasm. “Just from this,” he continued after a few breaths. He touched Draco’s cheek, his chest. “From you. I want you so fucking much, I...”
Draco laughed out loud. It echoed warmly in the mist. He’d ended up on the wrong side of the Veil after all. He wasn’t dead, though, so that was another thing his father had been wrong about. He could feel his heart thudding in his chest and taste the mist in his mouth. The Ministry had called this room the Death Chamber. He stepped forward, bonked into an invisible barrier, and bounced back.
Draco swallowed as his cock surged embarrassingly in Potter’s grasp. Potter released him and tugged at the waistband of Draco’s trousers. Draco wriggled out of them, feeling all the hairs on his legs stand up in a shiver at the cool of the room. Or maybe it was the heat of Potter’s bare leg flung over his again, sliding up and down as Potter’s warm hand began stroking him.
Harry stared at him. “Today is Sirius’s birthday? But you didn’t--when I saw you earlier, you didn’t--”
“Okay.” Harry swallowed hard. “I think you’re right. We need the pressure of the water to break the rest of the way through the barrier.”
"Potter?" A little tenseness had crept back into Malfoy's body. "So, I was thinking about what I wanted to ask. My question."
Harry stood up too, unwilling to let Remus leave with that sad droop to his shoulders.“You didn’t deserve that. You shouldn’t have thought that about yourself.”
“Sir, why are you here? State your business or leave the phone box.” The Welcome Witch seemed personally unbothered, judging from the unhurried scrape of emery board across fingernails. She was probably reading from a script, Harry thought as she continued, “Other witches and wizards may need to access the Ministry. You have until the third beep to comply.” A metallic beep sounded from the phone. Then a second one.
It was too late though. As Harry watched, Zabini gave out a hoarse cry and came. Malfoy swallowed and sucked, moving now, taking the arrhythmic thrusts that Zabini couldn't seem to control. Come spilled over Malfoy's lips and he sucked it back in with eyes closed with pleasure. He pulled off at last and sat up, his own cock red and stiff between his legs.
"If he needs a good kicking, Potter, you don't have to get your own hands dirty." Theo strolled forward, stopping with his shoes nudging Draco's bottom lip. "We're happy to do it for you. We'll hurt him as much as you like, mate."
"I never did understand why Snape hated you so much. Don’t get me wrong, it was desperately amusing especially when it came to Potions, but I didn't get it." It was silly but Draco was glad to hear it--at least this wasn't the standard Potter apology package. It made him feel a little daring and he flicked his fingers peremptorily. "Also, keep undressing. I didn't tell you to stop."
A bright line of silver shoots from the end of the boy’s stick and breaks into a shower of silver drops as it hits a broken hinge on one of the cabinet doors.
Draco felt a surge of gratitude toward Flint, and then hated himself for it. If he was so grateful to be treated with the barest minimum of humanity, how was he going to survive the rest of the year? The rest of his life? At the moment he wasn't even sure how he was going to survive the rest of the evening. He hurried down the corridor on the far side of the common room before Nott could stop him.
He heard the door open and footsteps crossing the room. The bed squeaked behind him as someone sat down on the edge of it. Harry waited for someone to pull him out of the jacket and make him come downstairs and talk—that would be Hermione. Or come downstairs and eat—that would be Ron. Nothing happened. He could keep breathing into the leather as long as he liked. Whoever it was would give him time and knowing that, he didn’t need to look, he knew who it was.
“Oh, yes, that was very good of you,” Cassiopeia said, skipping a little in place, smile back on her face. “Octans down on the first floor said things were quite horrible and oh, everyone knows about poor Asselus, his canvas slashed to pieces! He barely got out alive and he had to move into his son’s portrait and now they’re always squabbling.”
Harry pushed cock down his throat almost frantically at the thought of seeing himself on his knees in Ron's old bedroom, Chudley Cannons posters flapping on the walls while he waited for the door to open, to see who it was he had to suck off next.
A hundred flowery phrases tried to form in Harry’s mouth all at once. His tongue twisted. “Er,” Harry said. “Yeah. I did.”
"Eloquent as always, Potter." Zabini turned back to the wall, facing a complicated series of curlicues that had just started to smoke. He sighed. "This really would be a conversation best conducted with Draco. Still, I suppose I should be delighted that you're asking anyone at all. Stopping to ask questions was never your forte."
His eyes darted to the snake wrapped around the apple tree’s trunk, as green and bright as the leaves on the tree. Each tree had one, its own resident serpent and if you knew where to look, you could find the fang marks on each apple, just by the stem, where their venom was injected. Wasn’t symbiosis sweet? Nature at her bloody finest--animal and vegetable, coming together to share a kill.
Harry rolled his hips, the denim of his jeans rough against Draco’s bare skin. “I liked you telling me what to do,” he said, with a grin whose heat came from deep in his eyes. “How about you tell me how I should get off now?”
"It's not enough that you mock me by attempting to fight my battles for me?" Father's head tilted up and away, as if he couldn't bear to keep his eyes on the sight before him.
“You daft idiot,” Draco said. “I just told you I want to be here. You want me to show you how much?” He reached for Potter’s hip to pull him back down on the mattress, but Potter batted his hand away.
Or exciting. It didn't feel good, that was a fact. It felt like retching with a full mouth, which was what it was, he supposed. It just—well, there was also something inside himself that took in the male smell and the tickle of curly hair against his nose as Seamus thrust deep—and said it fucking loved this.
"Yes?" Draco said hesitantly, finally answering the question. He might as well. Potter already knew this part of it, thanks to bloody-fucking-Blaise. "Yes. They did it to me."
Draco shook his head. His cock was flagging and Harry was watching him with a worried expression on his face.
"I wanted—blinkered—you flooded—" There were a half dozen complete sentences inside Harry's brain, each of them articulate and cutting, explaining exactly how welcome Malfoy was in his bed, and how he hadn't forced Harry into anything, and furthermore how the twins's stupid prank had nearly killed the pair of them. They all collided on his tongue, tripped over each other, and fell incoherently out of a mouth gone tight with rage.
Draco froze. Literally, it felt. He suddenly felt cold all the way from head to toe, chilled against Potter's heat. "What else did Blaise tell you?"
He turned back to Dawlish, watching as he pulled a miniaturized holdall from somewhere in the folds of his Auror robes. A tap of his wand expanded it to the size of a carpet bag; Dawlish then removed a large, leather-bound book from its interior, its ancient cover worn to suede at the edges. The grimoire. It was held shut by a thin slab of iron that connected the entire front cover to the back, sealing in the pages on all three sides.
For the second time that day, Harry climbed the steps of Grimmauld Place and stood before the heavy oak front door. This time however, the door didn’t swing open at his approach. Harry raised his hand to the serpent knocker, a shiver of apprehension running through him. He pounded the heavy knocker against the brass plate and after a long moment, the door was opened by Kreacher.
“That would be preferable, yeah. Things get done more effectively when you enjoy it, but, nothings guaranteed. If you hate everything then you’ll just have to do the thing the hate the least, or just, you know, learn to love it. I don’t know, kid, we’ll figure it out.”
, but in that moment... he really didn’t give a shit, he could handle it just fine. Stomach be damned!
Harry leant forward, the scruff of his stubbled cheek brushing across the soft flesh of Draco’s neck, making the omega suck in a strained breath around the ever-tightening hand.
Now... that burden had insulted that friend and Draco didn’t have to wonder whose side they would take.
The days before Harry had befriended Ron and Hermione had been his darkest in the school, filled with the scentless torment that had been Lucius Malfoy.
of course, we can’t forget the best part! That I was left there to sit in a puddle of my own cold piss... because I refused to trade pleasantries for food like a trained chimpanzee. But thank you, thank you so very much for this lovely meal.”
Draco had only managed to make it halfway across the room before Harry was on him again, slamming his slender body hard against the closest wall, the Alpha’s large form curling around him as he pressed his face next to the Omega’s ear, blood already smudging across the pale skin.
Harry ripped himself away from his thoughts with a frustrated growl, a satisfied little rumble rising in his throat when he saw the boy flinch.
“There’s just a lot of history there, dear, nothing for you to worry about. I promise, if you wish it so, I can make sure that Harry doesn’t come to the house anymore if you’re scared of him.”
Draco answered in reply, his head nodding readily as he spared a glance to Ron. The Beta met the boy’s eyes before drifting back to his own plate, clearing his throat before he spoke.
Draco whined, trying to hold Harry’s hulking body against him as the Alpha continued to force his huge length inside, stretching him, taking him, using him, making him
Draco finally asked, kicking himself at the way his voice came out breathy and strained. Hermione leant forward, pulling him into a half hug and patting him on the back, her hair sticking to his wet skin.
So, this chapter gave me HELL. I kept rewriting the first half so many times before I just gave up and decided to stop touching it lmaoo ugh
Draco grinned, his hands immediately running through the beasts fur, groaning when the dog licked a slobbery stripe across his cheek.
Draco was still on the floor, a horrified expression on his face as the creature’s tongue flopped from his oversized mouth, whining again before turning to slobber all over Hermione’s face.
He spoke so strangely, almost entirely monotone except for the way he smiled at the end— a tiny twist of his lips that wasn’t convincing in the least.
She asked softly, grabbing the pepper before liberally shaking it over her eggs. Draco scrunched up his nose.
Hermione said, waving her hand in front of his face to get his attention. Draco blinked, frowning for a moment before he slipped on a smile.
Ron replied, the sound of cupboards opening and things being put away. Draco grimaced, ducking his head to rest on Rubeus’s back. He had forgotten about tonight, forgotten his promise to work on the dessert. It felt like so long ago that they had even had that conversation.
The voices were definitely coming from the lounge room, which meant someone had probably come by floo.
The potion was one thing, recognising the slight variants in colours was another. It took a skilled eye and Draco had no idea what this one meant.
Harry hadn’t even realised he had stopped blocking his scent, hadn’t noticed the sour turn of his pheromones pumping heavily into the small room.
Harry tried to find himself through the fog of his rut, trying to grasp onto something concrete, but all he could smell was that
Then two more hard smacks that had Draco lurching forward, the stinging heat in his ass bringing tears to his eyes.
The Alpha didn’t give him a chance to answer, instead, she flicked him one last grin before she swished around and headed out the door. Draco waited for a few moments, closing his eyes briefly and letting out a long breath as his mother’s words drifted through his mind.
“You’re not my first omega client, and you’re certainly not my first wayward charge either. If it eases your mind, I am on suppressants and I can assure you that I have
Harry smirked, his eyes holding the Omega’s incensed gaze for a heated moment before he pivoted the boy’s wand in his hands and snapped it right in half.
Draco spat out, shoving in another mouthful as he glared at Harry. He only chewed it twice before he started speaking again, his words half muffled between each bite.
Draco went rigid, slowly pulling himself away from the Alpha with a frown, his arms holding the towel tighter to his body.
Draco said, still laughing as he made to push himself up off the floor. He didn’t get far though when Harry stepped forward and pushed him back down with a grunt, his fingers winding into Draco’s soft hair and forming a tight fist, making the omega gasp.
She trailed off, her face screwing up as a sob escaped her lips. Harry pulled her into him, wrapping his arms around her as he let her cry into his chest.
She remembered how he used to react to them, almost cowering away when either Ron or her got too close.
She winked, her disposition changing so quickly and severely that Draco almost lost his breath. They chatted for a while after that, the Alpha lighting up at any talk of academics. He could feel her excitement through her expression, through her voice, her scent shifting into an oddly sweet and airy aroma.
It was despicable, and no matter how set in their ways the elite of the wizarding world were, what the Omega’s parents had done to him was just plain
Ron’s grunted after her. Draco did a half-wave behind him as he disappeared, shaking his head when he felt a small smile spill onto his face.
Draco groaned into his hands, slumping forward as he willed himself not to cry. He was so damn sick of crying.
before he went and grabbed the rest of the condiments, settling an array of toppings on the small table in front of Draco’s watchful eyes.
His own groan drowned out Draco’s high pitched keen before he thrust forward again, one arm wrapping possessively around the boy’s middle as the other wrapped around his chest, using his new hold to pound into the moaning Omega.
It was true, in comparison to before he felt like he was walking on air. There were no more cramps, no more pain… he felt
whip up a selection of food to drop off at the boy’s door, feeling a little less worried when he passed by Draco’s room an hour later to find the tray empty.
Something deep and foreign inside of him perked up at the fact that his own scent was now covering the Omega in front of him...
Draco sighed again, ignoring the cold chill that ran up his spine as he slowly opened the door, wincing as it let out a groaning creak.
in that moment, so entirely devoid of a way out… just like that night with Harry, just like… the time with his Alpha tutor.
Draco whispered, before turning on his heels and marching to his room. He didn’t shower, didn’t brush his teeth, didn’t even change, just flung off his shirt and dived under the covers, his mind going over the mess that had been the last few hours.
It had worried them, Hermione and Ron, seeing Draco’s pale face after he had finished with the healer, the eery silence of his blank eyes and shaking hands…
She said, reaching over and snagging a piece of cheese covered macaroni before popping it in her mouth. Draco nodded his head slowly, his brows pulling together in thought before he finally spoke, his words unmatched to the thoughts swirling around in his skull.
Draco muttered under his breath as he got up out of his chair and turned to leave, the sound of Ron’s voice behind him making him pause.
Harry was sleeping soundly but Draco was having trouble, his head resting on Harry's chest as he listened to his heartbeat. Mating with Harry had not been what he thought… had not been what he expected.
"Harry…" He struggled to figure out what was going on and grasped at straws, "The secret, what is it?"
Despite the scowl on Draco's face Aidan didn't falter as he smiled, "I'm Aidan, it's a pleasure to meet you."
"No, I don't think so." He reached down to pull at Draco's pants, and despite his words Draco lifted his hips to let him pull them off. "Oh you want me, Draco." He pressed over him, wrapping his fingers in his hair to hold him still. He moved until his lips were just above Draco's, "I'm gonna tell you a secret."
Before he could answer Ron made an annoyed sound, "See, this is what we are talking about Harry, you need to look at what you are doing. You're screwing everything up!"
Harry's grip finally loosened enough Draco could pull away, though he didn't go far. He turned to face him, shocked at the tear streaks down Harry's face, the desolate look in his eyes. He wrapped his arms around him, pulling him close. "Harry…" What could he do, he held tighter as he felt his own tears, "It's okay Harry…"
He laughed again, and now Draco could hear the pain in it,  realized Harry was nearly hysterical. He tried to sit up, but Harry held him down, "No, no, I said stay down." His voice was strained now though and when Draco struggled to get closer again he let him, let Draco kiss him. When he pulled back he ran his hand through Harry's hair and he let him, which was unusual.
Draco was already light headed, too much aparating when he wasn't used to it. Trying to comprehend that he really did love Harry Potter, trying to wrap his mind around that it had been him that had pulled Harry away from killing those muggles.
Harry only rolled his eyes and pushed Draco away. "I told you what I was going to do Draco, I knew you wouldn't have the stomach for it."
"Like I said." Harry's voice was relaxed, affectionate, but Draco still felt like he was waiting for the other shoe to drop.
Draco sat on the floor, rubbing his wrists where the restraints had cut into them. When Harry looked over at him he wiped at his face quickly, trying to erase the tears. Harry approached him and he cringed, but Harry only laughed before backing off.
Draco struggled with that. Everything in their house had been his father's, including him and his mother. "It's your bed, isn't it? Just like I'm yours."
He nearly gave up at that, but Harry's eyes were too intent, too focused and he didn't buy it. He grabbed one of Harry's wrists and pulled him closer, nudging him until an arm went around his waist and he could press against him. "You're not crazy Harry. You're trying to act like you don't care, like you're enjoying this, like you've lost it but… you're still in there."
"Maybe." He rolled his hips again, pulling Draco into another brutal kiss, holding him there until it was almost too much and Draco struggled away, gasping for breath. "Maybe if you beg me Draco, beg me to fuck you."
"I know you don't!" He grabbed Draco's robe and yanked him to his feet, crowding him against the wall.
He really shouldn't have been surprised when he got an owl back in record time, but from his father instead. He recognized the handwriting on the outside immediately and his shoulders hunched, and even he knew how sad it was that his dad could make him this afraid from so far away. He waited until he was in his own room before he opened it, not entirely sure what to expect.
It took Harry longer than Draco. Draco's eyes widened and his hands grabbed tightly over his stomach. Harry looked confused and moved his gaze from her to Draco, glancing down at his stomach and he knew the moment Harry understood.
"It should be rather obvious, shouldn't it?" Harry's eyes narrowed a little and he quickly continued, shoving down the sarcastic tone of voice. "Sorry. My father made me."
At the end his father told him if he had any more problems he should contact him, not his mother, and if there was a problem with that he would be happy to come and discuss it with Draco in person. The threat was barely veiled and Draco sighed, setting the letter on his desk. He was relieved, at least it meant he could probably be in the same room as Harry and the other Veela, but it didn't necessarily make things easier.
"Cherished? Loved? Why was I hidden away like a dirty little secret?" He slammed the door hard enough that it hit with a crash and bounced open, and Harry angrily hit it again.
It must have been because one moment he was begging Harry to fuck him and the next the wind was nearly knocked out of him when Harry did just that, sinking all the way to the hilt in one hard thrust. For a moment nothing happened, so abrupt that Draco's entire body froze, but it only lasted long enough for them each to take a breath and then Harry was moving. Hard, fast, one hand pressed over Draco's where he was clenching his fingers into the carpet and other hand mercilessly tugging on Draco's dick, bringing him to orgasm too fast, too hard.
That was even more confusing. It wasn't what he had pictured when he thought of how the "golden boy" must have grown up. It was terribly common. "Your family lives here?"
The words were insincere but it was good enough for now. Harry wrapped Draco in his arms again, smiling at his visible relief.
Draco didn't miss the change in tone, in the other's body language, and he recognized the correction for what it was and he didn't push. Instead he uneasily glanced around, surprised no one had come into the room yet. "They are muggles?"
He shifted his weight and even in his sleep Harry mumbled something and pulled him closer, arms locking around his waist tight enough that even if he wanted to get up he couldn't. Draco had been prepared that when he mated it would be painful, vicious and instead it had been… incredible.
He knew Harry was watching him as he stripped off his clothes and did a quick cleansing spell on himself to get rid of the stickiness. He pulled new clothes on as quick as possible, Harry's gaze on him making his body react again.
Draco was mostly boneless but Harry pulled him to his feet, directing him to the bed, chuckling when Draco practically collapsed on to it. He pushed him over, curling protectively around him. When they settled Harry couldn't help but add, "I missed you."
"Harry… please." Harry could hear the pain in his voice and the sneer slowly softened into a smile, unable to hide his fondness at the desperation.
His mom was watching intently and there was surprise on her face but Harry only looked to Draco who shrugged his shoulders. "I'm… I'm not sure. It just… felt weird."
He weighed his options, but knew that he needed to be honest. Harry would see through anything else and he was already working on borrowed time, the muggles could be home any minute and right now if they walked through the door, Draco was sure it would be the last thing they ever did.
and it made Draco hesitate, unsure. Harry had been mellow the last few days but he couldn't forget that Harry was
"Yes." He was looking in the adjoining rooms, a frown on his face. "Though they don't seem to be home."
Draco found himself suddenly rolled onto his back, Harry over him. He spread his legs, Harry's weight settling between them and looked up to meet his eyes and tried to snark, "I smell like you."
" Draco cringed at the tone and realized what had brought on Harry's bad mood. Didn't his friends realize they were pissing him off?
"Harry please, it's been too long, please." It was true, he missed Harry for a lot of reasons, he cared about him, but he missed getting fucked too. Missed his possessive hands on him. He responded with pressing his hips into Harry, his breath coming in short pants.
His attention was caught though as suddenly Draco made a small sound, face scrunched up in pain, and he was at his side in seconds. "Draco?" For a moment he couldn't answer, and slid his hand over his abdomen. "Draco, are you okay?"
"I'm in love with you?" It was supposed to be a question but the moment the words came out of his mouth he realized it was true and repeated, much softer, "I'm in love with you."
He was cut off mid-sentence as Harry grabbed him just under his thighs, lifting him up and slamming him against the wall. Their mouths were instantly pressed together, tongues battling while Harry rolled his hips against Draco in a slow grind.
"The people I grew up with. In fact, come here, let me show you something." He grabbed Draco's hand and dragged him down the stairs, making him stumble and almost fall.
Harry hesitated and ground out, “Safeword?”  Draco didn’t have to think about it before he shook his head.
you beat him." He didn't really mean that, not really, he didn't want Voldemort around, even before he had killed Snape and his mother.
Draco hated him instantly. They stood inside the entrance, on opposite sides, watching a small blonde boy walk up, flanked by his parents. Harry had a charming grin on his face and Draco spared the energy to send him a scowl, sure his attention was on the other boy enough that he wouldn't risk getting a beat down in the middle of the room. After a few moments he turned the scowl to Aidan, fists clenching when the other boy only had eyes for Harry.
Hermione made a small sound at that, eyes darting to Ron and back to Harry, the look daring him to say anything. How oblivious his friends were. Harry let go of Draco and dropped both hands on the table, words rumbling out of his throat, sounding painful with the restraint, "You can't tell me who to be with Ron. Maybe you should give a damn about what I want instead of what you think I should do."
They stared at each other, shocked into silence, even as a grin started to cross Harry's face. He finally managed to get out, "A baby? It's possible?"
The other boy was attempting to rub against him, finally managing to get one leg wrapped around Harry's waist. The closeness letting him rub harder against Harry, desperation in every movement.
"Me. You have me." He held his breath waiting, not relaxing even when Harry's full attention finally turned to him and he could see the wards disappearing as he lost interest in them.
He pulled against the grip again, even though it hurt, until Harry relented a little and let him tilt his head down a bit so he could breathe. "You keep this up and I'll lose you. You're more to me than sex-"
"Quiet now." Harry's voice was low, flat, and whatever they heard in it was enough to make them fall silent, watching as Harry stalked towards them. "I get to talk."
He could tell the moment Harry tried something, Aidan seemed to stumble, but quickly picked up his smile again, lowering his eyes and looking up through his eyelashes at Harry. It made the corner of Harry's mouth go up as he tilted his head in acknowledgment as Aidan continued towards him.
He got it then, Harry wasn't excited, he was angry. Should he be angry too? He thought about that while Dumbledore prattled on. "Mr. Potter, we've talked about this."
Potter and he couldn't help being struck by a sharp pain of regret that he was kind of one of them. "Always have to be in the spotlight, don't you Potter?"
Dumbledore made the closest to an impatient sound that Draco had ever heard, "This is the alternative to hundreds of Veelas showing up Harry. It isn't something that we could keep quiet."
Desperate Draco tried to push back but Harry wasn't using his pull and he couldn't do anything. He decided to use more physical means and reached out, wrapping his hand around Harry's dick, moaning at the feel of the hardness in his hand.
For a long time they stayed where they were, catching their breath and feeling each other close. Finally Harry leaned back, both of them making a discontent sound as he slid out. "Come on."
The fingers were gone, Harry had been quick and though more preparation probably could have been good but Draco didn't notice it as Harry was pressing inside. "Oh." His body froze, concentrating on the feeling of Harry pressing inside of him instead of his own pleasure and when he was pressed fully against him he trembled, just a little, at the power. He pressed his front further down, rolling hips back against Harry, trying to take him in as far as he could.
He didn't expect Harry to reach up and grab his jaw hard enough to hurt, nothing friendly in his eyes. "I told you to sit with me, where the hell did you think you were going?"
"I thought about using the cruciatus curse but I don't think it's hands on enough. I mean, I'm not sure they would really understand what was going on. They would be in pain, sure, but do you think they would be
"We'll be there in a minute." He offered no explanation further than that and for that Draco was grateful.
His tone was serious enough that Harry did pull back, holding himself up on his arms, "Draco, what's wrong?"
"Harry, I would like to talk about this new development. Would you and Mr. Malfoy please come to my office?"
Harry hinted that he thought his father was less than dominant, but Draco didn't think that was right either. If he hadn't been dominant he wouldn't have been able to woo his mother, after his own attempts to pretend he was sure of that. There was something odd going on though he wasn't sure that he wanted to know. His mother wouldn't leave him, he was sure even past the veela that she loved him, but it was something to think about.
Draco shifted uncomfortably, torn between pushing Harry away and pressing up against him. He tried to lean up to kiss Harry but he held him down, "No Draco, you're gonna listen."
"You know me so well, do you Draco? You think that you suck my dick a few times and you know me? That being my fuck toy gives you some kind of insight into what I'm doing?"
Draco was edging towards the door, Harry was scaring him. He was halfway there, watching Harry mutter to himself. Draco froze when Harry turned towards him, "That is far enough Draco." He stalked towards Draco, making the other press against the wall, anxious. It seemed to only make Harry upset as he snarled out, "Why are you so afraid of me?"
