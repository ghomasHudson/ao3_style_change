Neville reached across the table to hold her hand, which caused more whistles and giddy laughter.
The blond swallowed slowly, “We’ve gotten too deep into this.”
“To ‘Arry!” Hagrid bellowed, spilling his bucket sized glass mug of wine.
“So how do you feel now?” Harry asked, grinning.
“That’s a great idea! What would you do?”
“I hate you,” Harry murmured between aggressive kisses.
“I gotta admit, you freak me out a bit when you doze off with your eyes open,” Ron said quietly, “You know, considering whenever you did that last year a certain someone was usually in your head.”
It was only then that she looked up.
She returned his smile, “Nope.”
As they sat down, Harry shifted closely to Draco and threw his hands around his neck.
But the boy had already laid face down in the opposite direction bringing the doona up around his shoulders. There was still a space of neck though exposed to Harry, and, not wanting to waste any chances, he slowly reached out and ran the back of his hand down the back of Draco’s neck, in a caressing motion. As Draco didn’t move away, Harry then began to run his fingers through Draco’s hair, and the soft texture reminded him so vividly of Hedwig. He found himself never wanting to let go.
“Well...I’ve got little to no chance getting a job anywhere due to my track record. But...McGonagall’s the only one who believes in me, so...Maybe try to get a job here, in the castle?”
Harry turned to him, looking pained.
“I’m awake now aren’t I?
Harry fidgeted with the sleeve of his hoodie. If he was honest, having the option to return to Hogwarts greatly outweighed his invite into the Auror office. He needed a break from Dark Arts, how long for though, he still didn’t know.
But it faded as soon as it appeared as Draco continued, “Harry I…” He looked away, “I have to go to the Ministry tomorrow.”
He found the office empty, but the emptiness wasn’t what caught his eye.
Then Harry wordlessly cast Muffliato and returned to face Draco.
“So are you two coming to Hogsmeade with us tomorrow?”
“They weren’t happy about it,” Draco said smiling, “Kept trying to push us out of the kitchen, saying they’ve got it all under control.”
Ron shook his head, “Last time I saw her she was rushing off to the library after Transfiguration.”
Draco had put his skivvy back on, but Harry was wearing one of Draco’s Slytherin T-shirts one might wear at a Slytherin Quidditch match.
“Yep.
Draco’s letters usually arrived in the late evening. The same grey owl went from Malfoy manor to Hogwarts and back again, and its feathers seemed to get thicker and thicker the further they proceeded into December. Harry made sure to provide the owl with adequate quantities of chocolate before he left once more to make the journey back to the manor.
Draco laughed. Harry wished he could listen to the sound over and over.
“I’m gonna travel,” Blaise said first, “I wanna see Europe, and the eastern side of the states.”
Blaise obliged calmly, smoothly lifting his T-shirt above his head to reveal a toned chest, shoulders and stomach. ‘Yep, I definitely like boys,’ Harry thought to himself.
Harry was now unashamedly rutting against Draco, causing Draco to cling to Harry’s shirt as his head fell back at the friction.
Draco flinched at the name, but then pushed Harry even harder into one of the desks, causing him to topple over it. But as he did so, Harry laughed.
Hermione shrugged, “I think we can get away with it.”
Blaise threw back his shot, then looked back at everyone with their full glasses in their hands, “Blimey you’s are innocent!”
“God Ron you’re a mess,” Ginny said from behind the couch.
Nobody seemed to be discussing this new seating arrangement. It seemed to Harry, to come under that umbrella of things teenagers did but never talked about, and everyone obeyed the agenda knowingly.
“I’ll talk to him.”
The Slytherin’s voice had a smugness to it, and the boiling anger Harry had felt all day suddenly reached its peak.
Harry beamed. The mere fact that Draco had at one point noticed what he was wearing was enough to surge him on.
Draco choked, “You’re joking?”
Harry didn’t want to move. He knew that Draco would be taken away today and Harry could only pray to the stars that the Ministry wouldn’t keep him for more than a day.
“Blimey! This is brilliant innit!” Ron said beaming. “Yours is pretty much the same as mine Harry, course, just a few extra Quidditch posters.”
“Right. Thanks.”
Harry, having never cared about his appearance before, didn’t plan on starting tonight. He wore a dark navy hoodie, black straight leg jeans and black trainers.
“Harry,” he felt Hermione’s hand on his wrist. “We’re with you whatever happens.”
Caring about ourselves!”
“What?!” Hermione and Ron said together. Draco turned to look at him fondly.
“I wasn’t thinking that!”
“Hey Pansy,” Harry slurred.
“U-ugh that f-feels so good Draco. Y-you’re so good a-at this.”
Draco raised his eyebrows.
All the anger and sadness that had been pumping through Harry’s veins suddenly subsided. All he felt was overwhelming gratitude and love choked up in his throat for the people who stood staring hesitantly around him. He still wasn’t able to speak. Tears were now leaking down his face and dripping onto the yearbook that he held in his hands.
“Last I heard we were just discussing Quidditch, then we must’ve fallen asleep. Right Potter?”
After they’d realised they were the only ones left in the common room and the embers in the fireplace were just about burnt out, the four of them made their way up the boys staircase, Hermione having resolved to sleep in Ron’s bed.
“At least Blaise is here,” Harry told him reassuringly, “And Luna. You’ll be fine, trust me.”
Harry looked at him sadly, taking his hand.
He licked his lips, “Then you left and it made me realise how much sooner I should’ve told you.”
Harry sobbed shamelessly into his chest as the blond held him and stroked his back slowly.
“You’re shivering Potter.”
“Just stay close to me,” Harry half whispered and half hissed to the seemingly invisible space behind him.
“At first, I was like, nah no way, there’s no way I’d let that git near Harry! But you make ‘im happy don’t ya?”
The blond’s voice was quiet and raspy.
“I know you’re thinking the worst, Harry, but there a million other good reasons as to why Draco isn't back yet...Perhaps his Mother had come to London to visit him?”
“Oh Harry! These photos,” Hermione said as she picked up the one of Sirius and Lupin.
“Are people being nice?”
It was Tuesday evening now and Harry was sitting in the library with Ron and Hermione, looking utterly depressed.
“Put your wand down you git! What the hell are you doing?” At this, Ron looked between Harry and then down at the couch, where Draco Malfoy was sleeping peacefully. Harry looked around then and saw all of the other eighth years surrounding him and Draco on the couch, some looking shocked, some looking curious, and others, (Hermione, Pansy and Blaise), with smirks on their faces.
“What in the devils is going on here?!” An important looking wizard with a Ministry of Magic badge pinned to his robes said as he stepped forward.
“Don’t, I was an ass back then. I know you think it’s a cop out but I really didn’t deserve your friendship. I would’ve used you the way I used…” Draco paused and swallowed, “The way I used Crabbe and Goyle. I mean, I know you never would’ve let me boss you around, but I only wanted to be your friend because you were Harry Potter, not for the person you really are.”
As they laid down, they turned to face each other. Harry placed his hand on Draco’s hip and snuck his fingers underneath his sweater, caressing Draco’s soft skin.
In regards to inter-house unity, the eighth years were improving. The Hufflepuffs were learning to not take serious offence to the crude sense of humour issued by the Slytherin’s. The Slytherin’s, instead of making a fuss over the often reckless and uninhibited choices played out by various Gryffindor’s, simply watched them and laughed. The Ravenclaws were also beginning to open up and relax a little, thanks to Hermione’s kindness. They warmed up to her quickly simply because she was so smart and they were continually appalled as to why she was never sorted into Ravenclaw.
Draco, still gripping Harry’s hair, whispered into his ear, “Yes. Come for me Harry.”
Harry plonked down in an armchair sighing, shoving his head in his hands.
Draco chuckled, “Are you kidding Potter? I want nothing more.”
Harry could only stand there trying to catch his breath. OK, even if he hadn't admitted to himself he liked boys, he could definitely admit to himself that he liked Draco Malfoy.
The boys nodded and they all turned to trudge back through the snow up the main street. Gold and red scarves obscuring their faces.
“Alright alright,” Blaise said, “Me again. Never have I ever slept with more than three people.”
When their bodies met Draco growled hungrily, slamming the door behind him and switching them around so that he pushed Harry roughly up against the door.
Harry watched as Neville’s breath hitched, but no sooner had the Gryffindor got up and sat in front of Hannah. Neville tentatively placed his hand on the side of her neck, and then slowly leaned in. Hannah seemed to welcome the kiss, and soon the two had fallen into a dance of lips, Hannah’s hands pulling at Neville's hair and Neville’s hands gripping her hips.
“Nevermind that. How in Salazar’s do you even know all this about the eighth years ‘Mione?” Ron asked.
Draco’s fingers began caressing Harry's throat. His voice was still sexily raspy, and Harry realised whenever he heard it, it was during moments where Draco was uninhibited, when he was comfortable and free, when they were cuddled together like this in bed.
Then Draco lifted his head and shifted his body up beside Harry to level their faces.
Blaise grinned, “Go ahead Miss Lovegood.”
“Yep,” Neville said, “And McGonagall’s speech.”
“Thank you Draco,” Harry said as some of the first years were murmuring, “Did you see that?!” “How did he do that?”
“And what about Draco’s NEWTS?!” Harry said angrily.
“Harry,” Hermione cut him off, “Have you actually tried talking to him about this?”
“Alright Luna?” Harry asked as the long blond sat down on Ron’s other side and Neville sat down beside Ginny.
Harry sighed, “I’m sorry Hermione.”
“What about Draco?”
“Hmm, thought so.”
The quieter students just eyed him with curiosity.
“As you perhaps already know... your rooms,” She gestured to the archway behind her, “will not be shared among your previous dormmates. You will occupy your own room. Two spiral staircases sit behind me, girls on the right and boys on the left, and don’t worry Mr. Weasley, the girls staircase isn’t bewitched.” The eighth years laughed as Ron stood red faced. “Furthermore, due to the magic we have embedded into this tower, as well as the castles own ancient magic ingrained in the walls, your rooms seemed to have formed impressions of their owners once we placed your names upon the doors.” At this, many of the eighth years gasped. “Of course, this shouldn’t stop you from rearranging and transfiguring your room into the way that suits you, in fact, myself as well as the other staff encourage you to express yourself as much as you can. So, plainly, you have free reign toward the design of your bedroom.”
“Of course not, Harry, but that doesn’t change anything,” Hermione said. “Love potions are incredibly dangerous and immoral pieces of magic. Frankly, I think they should be made illegal.”
“Alright then, what’s your answer?” Pansy narrowed her eyes at Blaise.
aren’t going to do anything with him,” Draco said. “
?” Harry asked, almost spitting out his tea.
Blaise muttered something and the door to the Room materialized in the wall. Draco followed him inside, flinching when the door slammed shut.
“How could you, Malfoy?” Potter wailed, writhing in midair. Granger cast Silencio on and subsequently ignored him, which Draco both approved of and highly disapproved of because it meant all her attention was focused on himself, and she looked as though she was quite ready to cut off his penis and shove it down his throat.
“Forbearance, thy name is Malfoy,” Harry said drily.
“Just out of idle curiosity, what kinds of games are we talking about?” Boot looked apprehensive.
She shook her head. “I’d bet he’s gotten a summons from the Dark Lord. Madam Isolde has been trying to keep him safe but perhaps something happened to her?”
“Even if I were completely incapable of analyzing the empirical evidence of who’s usually to blame when things like this happen to us,” Granger said, “I’d still have some basic knowledge of love potions, you complete sodding nimrod.”
“Clearly Draco couldn’t bring himself to do the same.”
“I charmed Potter’s tea at dinner and Disillusioned myself to follow him to McGonagall’s office,” Boot said. “I then cast the charm on the stairs and alerted Summerby.”
At least, he thinks he is.
Attributing his sudden stupidity to sleep deprivation was the best thing to do. Otherwise Draco’d have to face that he’d picked a dud of a Ravenclaw as his minion.
“Do you know what this is?” Granger asked him, one eyebrow cocked.
“What?” Draco asked, looking at her askance. They’d agreed not to talk about what’d happened with Weasley, and from Pansy’s flushed face and darting gaze he could tell she was trying to deflect.
“Not exactly,” Boot said, “but...it can be hard to get Hufflepuffs in on mischief. They tend to stick together and follow rules. But that’s exactly why you need one, I get it. I’ll start working on it. And I’ll have those plans ready tomorrow.”
“Hello, everyone,” Draco said, pretending he hadn’t just begun to sneak out the door and attempting to defuse the situation by swaggering in and ruffling Theo’s hair. “Clearly the correct answer is to fuck Dumbledore, Blaise. He’s the most powerful wizard in history, you’d be sure to get something good out of it.”
McGonagall came sweeping in in that ridiculous hat (when had she bought that thing, 1933?), and Draco fully expected her to smack them over the head as she’d done to him and Pansy many times, but instead she just walked on by, giving them a small smile.
When Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle got back to the common room, it was near dark. Theo, Pansy, and Blaise were in the common room playing Fuck Kill Torture Then Kill as the three of them took off their shoes and cloaks and put on the pajamas they’d kept in their bags—on Friday evenings everyone had to wear lingerie or nightwear in the common room.
Draco groaned inwardly.
“What?” Harry asked, giving him a dubious look.
“You call him Teddy?” Harry asked incredulously.
“I’m a Ravenclaw. We make it our job to know things,” Boot said, adjusting his glasses. Draco wondered if that had been purposeful or an excellent coincidence.
“Let me know what Dumbledore says,” Ron said. “I’ll be up in a minute.”
Draco sighed. “Perfect. Absolutely perfect. And you’re sure the charm will last a week, Boot?”
Harry considered arguing with him, but his hand still read
Harry stormed in, disregarding Dumbledore’s double-take at his paint-covered form.
“But I have another mission,” he said, “and it’s even more important, the Dark Lord told me. I have to guard something here, in this room.”
Draco scoffed. “Only the usual ones—you know, Fuck Kill Torture Then Kill, strip poker—oh, and Candyland.”
“Who’s been putting this bullshit in your head?” Blaise asked furiously, his face red.
“I know it was you who did this,” Harry said, indicating his body, which was still covered in paint.
5. Enjoy. Please.
It had been a long time since Draco had really cried, had felt fragile, since before his mother had come home ash-faced to tell him his father was dead, before Moody had broken his ribs Transfiguring him, before he’d been hit by that bloody hippogriff, before all of it. He had a sudden memory of his mother’s embrace when he’d broken his wrist falling off his broom as a child, of the house-elves bustling around him. A feeling of safety, not despite his vulnerability, but because of it.
Harry went to the Room of Requirement to take some time to think where no one else (read: Hermione) could barge in and talk some sense into him, because he didn’t
Harry watched him, suspicions dancing on his tongue, and decided not to press the issue.
It was later that evening when he finally had the chance to approach Hermione. She was bent over a book in an isolated corner of the common room, scribbling furiously on a piece of parchment, with at least four quills entwined in her fluffy curls.
“Yes.”
Ruffling his once-again-although-not-so-naturally-this-time-but-keep-it-hush-hush-platinum-blond hair, Draco stretched.
“You absolute menace, Headmaster Dumbledore asked me to meet him here, isn’t that what I’ve told you? Biased against Slytherins, the whole lot of you—”
Over her shoulder, Harry could see Malfoy smirking into his sleeve. He got up and stormed out of the Great Hall, glancing around before giving Malfoy the finger on his way out. He’d explain to Luna later. For now, he needed to find someone who’d be able to unstick him.
But as she ducked back to her other parchment, scribbling away at it, Harry stared at the top of her head. He did what she would’ve done: he evaluated the empirical evidence, and concluded that the likelihood that Hermione was wrong was slim to none.
“Fine, fine,” Draco grumbled, waving off his hands, which seemed determined to grab hold of Draco’s shoulders. He was very warm. Of course Potter would be.
Blaise swallowed, straightening. “Draco, I want to believe you, but—”
He’d forgotten about the three percent chance she’d do that, and immediately resolved to get a Ravenclaw minion to keep track of these things.
Malfoys always knew when to grovel, and besides that it was on the Slytherin curriculum. Draco commended Flint for his excellent orientation planning.
“Quite right, indeed, Harry,” Dumbledore said. They went down the hall a ways until they found an unoccupied broom closet. Dumbledore and Harry went inside, and Dumbledore said, “Hold on tight, Harry,” and then there was that horrible twist of Side-Along, and they were outside Grimmauld Place.
“Yes, of course,” Harry said. “What—now?”
“And you used that to make him stop being a git.”
Potter was beside him before Draco could say anything. “Are you alright?”
“Oh, Theo!” Hermione turned to Nott, her face radiant. “You really got Malfoy to agree?”
As weirdly arousing as that was, he decided he’d rather not, but just as he opened his mouth to begin talking his way out of the situation, Granger interrupted him by pulling a tiny beaded bag out of her robes, which he had to assume contained many pockets.
Blaise’s face relaxed a bit. For a moment he looked like Draco’s childhood friend, when they’d chased each other around the garden on toy brooms while their mothers laughed over cold glasses of wine. Now Narcissa Malfoy was in hiding and Lady Isolde was...well, who knew.
But Draco was the son of Death Eaters and an evil Slytherin, yada yada yada, and so inevitably would be given no leeway if someone managed to actually produce evidence of his wrongdoing. Which they never had so far. He smirked, remembering the Great Cover-Up of fourth year, but his smirk soon faded. There was no way of covering up anything he could do to escalate the War on Potter. Draco would be given no leeway.
He looked up and gasped. The Room was an endless dark space, filled with mountains and heaps of things, discarded and broken things, new and gleaming things, secret things that were never meant to see the light of day. Draco spotted a pair of underwear with his name and a heart inscribed on them in rhinestones and raised an eyebrow.
“Then why’d you come in here?”
Malfoy rubbed the space between his eyebrows. “You have no proof of that. And, besides—I—”
“That’s a new one,” said Malfoy. “I haven’t heard those words since the time I tried to seduce Professor Snape while asleep.”
“Perfect,” Hermione said. “What a wonderful solution, Harry. Nice to know that you’re dealing with your feelings well.”
“I—well. I’d just never thought about it that way before.” Potter attempted to remove his hair from his face and failed. “It must be hard, when he has your family against you.”
“Draco,” Theo said, and against his better judgment, Draco turned to him. Theo’s dark blue eyes were fixed on him, and his slim frame looked delicate in the low greenish light of the common room.
Malfoy’s sneering face came to his mind of a sudden, and Harry remembered he was Sirius’s first cousin once removed. He’d been on the tapestry when Sirius had shown it to him last year. Would Sirius’s mother have burned him out as well, for spying for Dumbledore? Or was Malfoy really a spy for Voldemort? Harry’s skin crawled. Why did Malfoy do this to him—send him into this tailspin of confusion and worry? Why did he even care?
Potter spread his hands. “To be fair...I did just keep you from getting hexed, so I was sort of right.”
“Finite incantatem,” Granger said. “Really, we need to find a way of getting around the stacked spell issue. That will be my next Charms paper, I think. Come on, Harry.”
“Where are we going, Professor?” Harry asked as he and Dumbledore went out of the headmaster’s office and down the corridor.
“What happened?” Potter asked, glancing around him as though coming out of a trance. “I had the weirdest dream…oh no.” He was staring up at Draco in sheer revulsion.
“Potter, you have to stop,” he said, backing up against the wall, whipping out his wand, and abruptly staring at it and realizing that he didn’t know any spells that could stop the Amortentia. If he Stunned Potter now, the effects would just resume when he awoke.
“I just...the Legilimency always takes more out of me than I expect,” Draco grudgingly admitted. “Now...will you Levitate Blaise?”
As his moment of lucidity passes, Harry plunges into his body, feeling a desperation to find Malfoy, a need, like hunger or thirst. A pull. He’s finally escaped Hermione and is racing through the Great Hall, where everyone seems occupied. He doesn’t care. His chest feels tight and tears are stinging at his eyes. He needs Malfoy. His feet are rushing along the stone floor of the dungeons, under the Invisibility Cloak he slips into Malfoy’s room and waits for Malfoy, and when he finally enters Harry feels relief, and joy, wash over him. He leaps at Malfoy, wanting his skin and teeth and tongue and hands, wanting his beautiful hair and silvery eyes, wanting all the things he’s never allowed himself to want, and—
Harry almost turned tail and ran when he saw the back of a familiar white-blond head in front of the griffin staircase, arguing with it in hushed tones.
When he woke it was five-thirty, and he was groggy and clammy and even crosser with Malfoy than he had been earlier. Dumbledore had asked him to come to his office at six o’clock that evening, and Harry, figuring he was close enough and too pissed off to bother waiting, went up the griffin-guarded stairs and knocked on the door.
Draco whistled as he left the library and fully ignored Madam Pince’s glare. He had a Ravenclaw minion, Daphne Greengrass was not, as it turned out, pregnant, and soon he’d be able to torment Potter while pretending to be a little angel. Today was a great day.
“But Malfoy, how could I? You know we were meant for each other…” Potter said, and before Draco even had time to process that even in the throes of Amortentia, Potter still called him by his last name, Potter had lunged forward and taken his face in his hands and was kissing him.
Draco had spent much of his life wondering why exactly Granger always looked so happy in the library by herself. Now he had his answer.
Malfoy turned to him. “We went to Dumbledore and told him we’d spy for the Order if he made sure to protect Slytherins and our families.”
Harry’s dreaming.
Not much to say this week other than I hope you're doing well and taking care of yourselves! Thank you to everyone who's reading, commenting, kudos-ing, and any other applicable gerunds. Enjoy. Please.
“I was so scared,” Blaise whispered, gripping the back of Draco’s head. “He—Draco, he—”
Boot just stared at him. “What?”
“I have one. The Golden Trio.” Draco snickered, but let it peter out when Theo’s shoulders suddenly got tense again.
Except that when he got there, he found a silver-blond head just visible over a table in the corner. Of course when he stopped looking, that was when Malfoy decided to show up. It took only a few moments to cross the room, sliding between pulled-out chairs and stepping over curled-up Ravenclaws on the floor, and stand as menacingly as possible over Malfoy.
“Okay, Harry, let’s just go from the beginning to fully understand your reasoning here,” he said. “Retrace our steps, so to speak.”
“My point is,” Harry began firmly, “that I am in a position of power here.”
“He called Hermione...well, you know.”
He surveyed his minions with glee. Boot stared at a wall until a bookshelf manifested, then went and grabbed a book from it, angling his head up every time Goyle held a sweet up to him. It’d do him good; the boy was too skinny. Summerby had her eyes closed and looked as though she was getting a nap in.
Draco’s parents had been serving the Dark Lord for decades but had fallen out of favor in recent years for making a life for themselves once he’d been defeated the first time. His father had been...in danger...for quite a while now. Luckily the Dark Lord found Draco himself useless enough, and Draco had shown little enough interest in the Death Eaters (he preferred bullying small children and having unprotected sex in a disorganized fashion, and not at the same time), that the Dark Lord had left Draco alone thus far. If his mother was in hiding, then the Dark Lord would presumably come after Draco next. It was only a matter of time, and the amount of that time depended on how well his parents had bargained for his safety.
choice. Boot had done his job well, and also looked considerably better-rested and happier after Draco had helped him get some sleep.
“Ron,” Harry said. “If Malfoy is really being a decent person, he’s not well. Something is wrong. And I know just how to fix it.”
Theo muttered, “Muffliato,” and Draco filed that spell away to ask him about later; he’d never heard of it before.
This current fight, however, was not his fault as far as he could tell. It had quite literally been there when he arrived in the Great Hall fifteen minutes before. But what had happened before he'd gotten
No, he must be, because he’s never done this in real life. Never done anything close to this, never even considered this.
But as Draco watched his minions, a warm feeling permeated his body. A feeling of purpose, of camaraderie. Perhaps...he could have friends, even friends who were—he shuddered a bit—Hufflepuffs. Perhaps he could respect someone and have their respect in return.
Was it just him, or did Malfoy look...hurt?
“Okay—Dumbledore, Slughorn, Sprout,” Pansy said, taking a swig of butterbeer. She was lying on her stomach on the ground, her upper body held up by her elbows, and wearing a blue satin nightgown. Draco decided he did not, in fact, have a kink for the color blue. Pansy, despite their opposite looks, she short, curvy, and dark-haired, he tall, slim, and silvery-blond, was like his sister. The idea of having sex with her, even for someone as admittedly sinful and perverted as he, was disgusting.
“Why?”
“What’s so funny?” Draco huffed.
Whatever was going on in Harry’s personal life, which was definitely feeling more and more like a dumpster fire with every passing hour, he had his priorities straight. Dumbledore had given him a mission, and he was going to fulfill it. That was why he walked over to the Ravenclaw table at dinner that night and sat down next to Luna.
“Will you promise never to tell me what Slytherins get up to ever again?” Boot asked. “And make them stop hitting me?”
“What is it?” Draco asked, leaning closer.
“So let me get this straight.” Ron was rubbing his temples. “You’re mad that Malfoy’s not being a git.”
“I’m sure you speak from experience,” Draco said.
“I’m sure you are,” said Malfoy, flexing his biceps. “How could you resist?”
“Well, we alter it a bit so that everyone wears an anal plug and when you go forward you get real candy, and when you get sent backward you get a few spanks from the player of your choice with our special paddle that says Loser,” Draco said.
This was a very thin line to walk. If Blaise told the Dark Lord, both Uncle Sev and Draco would surely be crucified. But if he bought the bluff…
Harry could work within those parameters, he thought, and bracing himself for the nightmares, he crushed his pillow to his chest and closed his eyes.
“Voldemort won’t do anything good for any of us,” Theo said. Draco had barely ever heard him say this much at a time when in a group. “He says he’ll take care of pureblood legacies but he won’t. The man’s a menace, and I know he’s scaring you into thinking otherwise, Blaise, but we’d all be better off without him, even us purebloods.”
“Why are you looking at me like that, Potter? Not going to try and jump me again?” Malfoy muttered as they shoved their way up the stairs.
She paused. “What are you feeling in the dreams?”
Draco got to his elbows and started to army-crawl out of the room.
“I don’t have the dossier quite ready for you yet,” Boot said, clenching his teeth as they took a seat. “I need to do a few more interviews.”
“Oh sure,” said Draco, not looking at his broad shoulders and bright eyes and full mouth and easy posture. “Bad genes, definitely.”
Blaise’s hands jerked, and then one came to his face. Potter turned away, and Draco crawled on the bed beside his friend, looking away from his tears.
“He’s a git.”
“I did
Draco constantly ran cold.
“But...why? Weren’t you just talking about how you’d used illicit methods to take down someone else’s marks?”
“Borgin and Burkes, yes,” Blaise said, looking at it with a mixture of disdain and proprietary pride. He placed a hand on it, inhaling deeply. “I’ve been fixing it.”
“We’ve hated Malfoy for years.”
“I really do want to hit you,” Harry said ruefully as he left the room.
Hermione scribbled down something else and frowned. Harry knew that frown. It meant she’d just figured something out and she didn’t like it.
Of course, he’d never tried to sleep with Hermione. Perhaps she needed someone more subtle than Ron, more clever and perceptive. But as he lay there, he thought of the way Parkinson cheered at Quidditch games and her fierce loyalty to Malfoy, dedicated to being his right hand the same way that Ron was for Harry, and he thought he understood.
Boot jumped at the noise. “Draco,” he said, pressing a hand to his chest, and Draco wondered if all Ravenclaws routinely called people by their first names just to prove they knew them. “You scared me.”
Blaise glanced around them, then leaned in to whisper in Draco’s ear. “Meet me outside the Room of Requirement at five o’clock.”
“So that they can enter the school,” he said, hunching. “It should be ready in a few weeks.”
The two offenders turned like they were trying to Apparate and failing, and the four of them stared at each other for a minute. Then Malfoy marched over, grabbed Pansy by the arm, and dragged her away from Ron.
“Good, Crabbe,” he said, craning his neck. “Just there. A bit harder.”
Seeing the expression on Boot’s face, Draco added, “Or anyone else! Lots of connections with non-Dark wizards as well. Equal opportunity, we Malfoys are.”
Draco looked at him askance. “What do you have against Potter?”
Ok. Well. I need to just say I'm going to update Fridays, I suppose. So excited about this chapter! Thanks for all your love on this story, as well as my others (please check them out if you're new to this fic!), and enjoy. Please.
Dumbledore nodded.
He caught a furtive, suspicious glance from Boot before he ducked back to his plate.
“Have you seen Potter anywhere?” he asked casually as he crawled past Lovegood’s feet.
“Yes.”
He stopped before he could say the full horrible words.
“I never confirmed that,” Draco said. “And besides, it’s different. He’s a teacher. Teachers have been discriminating against Slytherins for years. Uncle Sev should know better.”
In the yellow artificial light of the parlor he looked almost jaundiced, monochromatic and weathered. Harry took the trembling hand and gave a last glance to the parlor table, still sliced open.
In an instant they were back in the broom closet, and Dumbledore stumbled. Harry steadied him, and the two of them exited into the hall, which was blessedly empty and dim.
She was complicated, Hermione, the kind of person who had so many layers and nooks and crannies that it was difficult to know what she’d do. But Harry had always found her so simple to be with, so simple to love.
“So, we hate Malfoy,” Ron said, launching into a cross-examination Harry bet any barrister would've been proud of.
Of course, if he were a betting man, he’d have put Malfoy and Quidditch somewhere around neck and neck on his list of concerns in general, so it wasn’t that surprising.
“Protecting us from the Dark Lord?” Blaise said, snorting. “Theo—”
“Crabbe. Shoulder massage.”
Cocking his head, Harry said, “Oh, the usual.”
“Love you too,” Harry said. “I’ll take care of this. I just...I want to talk to Malfoy about it. Dumbledore doesn’t need to know. I can just beat Malfoy up.”
Dumbledore nodded. “And I want you to do it, Harry. I think it will be best.”
Still, she was a Slytherin. And she’d been awful to them. And Hermione couldn’t know.
“A lot’s happened,” Malfoy said, moving toward Harry and speaking softly. “We can’t talk here. Come on.”
Hello everyone!
“Thanks,” said Boot, cracking his neck.
Besides, they were going to beat the hell out of Hufflepuff and no one thought any different.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Listen, what you did was stupid and I could report you to Dumbledore and probably get you expelled.”
“Oh—I don’t know,” Hermione replied, finally tearing her eyes away from the book. “Haven’t seen him. Probably out flying or something. But you two should really both be studying. We’ve less than a month until finals.”
His own words rang in his ears.
Against every instinct his tutors had drilled into him as a child—
Kingsley produced from a pocket inside his robes the locket, which he set on the table and then recoiled from as though it were a snake that was about to bite. Just seeing it set a buzzing in Harry’s ears, a weird sensation that made him shiver, as though his body was reacting viscerally, simultaneously pulling him closer and screaming to run. Dumbledore took out a little pouch, which Harry reached inside, feeling for all the world as though he was once again choosing his dragon in the Triwizard Tournament, and felt a pang of relief when he caught the handle of the sword of Godric Gryffindor. The pouch must have been Charmed.
“Now, Draco,” she said. “I’m sure the Headmaster does care very much about us. Perhaps he’s merely too busy with other things to perform his duties to the school to the full. Now that your father is gone, don’t you take his place on the board of governors?”
Draco made a face. “I was mostly concerned with not getting slept with at the time.”
“Is that all, sir?” Harry asked, bracing himself to stand.
They were silent for another long minute before Harry remembered the scene in the Great Hall when he’d been un-potioned.
5. Enjoy. Please.
“Very well played making it wear off of his face first,” Draco said to Potter. “Now we have to listen to him blathering on for a half hour before we can hit each other and get it over with.”
Harry nodded, his heart hammering, and hefted the sword in both hands.
That was when a whisper of, “Hello, my dearest,” came from his right and Draco shrieked, leaped from the bed, and remembered in a surge of utmost horror the rumors that Potter had an Invisibility Cloak.
He led Malfoy into the nearest classroom, where Harry perched on the desk in the front of the room. Malfoy stayed standing, one hand on his wand.
Harry adjusted his glasses, rubbed his temples, and went to the meeting.
Damn the man’s heroic exploits and obsession with Quidditch, and Draco’s recent weight loss. Damn it, damn it. Draco writhed like a snake, trying to shake himself loose from Potter’s grip. He wondered what his eleven year old self would have said upon seeing this. Probably would’ve died on the spot.
“Malfoys have very sharp hearing,” Malfoy said with an idiotic tilt of his head that he must have thought looked aristocratic. Well, it didn’t.
“Which makes your attempted sexual conquest of me even less ethical,” said Malfoy, who looked gleeful.
Elspurn Summerby had been the
“No,” Ron said quickly. “Not at all. Just meaningless and kinky sex.”
He tried to take advantage of the moment by doing his best Troubled But Devastatingly Handsome Young Nobleman look, but his concentration was broken by Dean Thomas throwing a pie into Seamus Finnegan’s face.
“But he didn’t mean to make me attracted to him, right?” Harry said. “I mean, there’s no way Malfoy would ever want to—”
“Yes.”
It was somehow mid-May already, and Quidditch finals were, for once, not Harry’s number one concern.
Of course, if he got out of this alive, he’d apparently owe Granger a life debt, but as far as Malfoys were concerned one could repay a life debt by not betraying someone and getting them killed, and Draco supposed grudgingly that he could restrain himself. Her teeth weren’t so big as they used to be. He was nearly out of the Great Hall now, and if he could just make it down to the dormitories and into his bedroom, and if he performed some good charmwork on his door, he’d be safe.
“It’s Veritaserum,” said Granger, who was looking even more annoyed with him than usual, if that was possible. Her large dark eyes had narrowed to slits. “Which means that I have the power to make you tell the truth. Now, wouldn’t you rather tell me what really happened to Harry rather than having some of this and not only spilling the truth about that but also having to truthfully answer any other question I ask you?”
Besides, Ravenclaws were usually very good in bed.
“In this case, I believe I should append to my original sentiment the truth that I myself, in my many years of life, have too often forgotten,” he said. “It is the truly wise man who can admit that he was wrong.”
Logically, he knew Hermione was right and he should probably go to Dumbledore. But did he have to??
“For the most part,” Harry said, grimacing.
“Turn around, Malfoy,” Harry said, turning himself and pressing his forehead against the wall.
“What’s this about Malfoy being given asylum?” he said. “It’s absolute rubbish, we can’t trust him, Professor.”
A few seconds later, Harry tripped over an invisible wire and rolled down a flight of stairs. He landed at the bottom with a bump, shaken but unhurt, and sat up to find that his entire person was covered in paint. He looked up at the stairs, and found them dripping in a rainbow of color, most of which had somehow transferred to Harry.
“If my plan had gone as I intended you’d be much worse off,” Draco told him, although his vision was starting to blur. “You’d probably have gotten detention for months.”
Granger shot him a disdainful look and pointed her wand at Potter.
He considered faking illness and going to the hospital wing, but Pomfrey had been eyeing him with skepticism quite often lately and he didn’t know how well that would go. Instead he just went off to Transfiguration, resigning himself to a day of drudgery and a bit of fear.
Harry supposed he had known for a long time that Ron and Hermione would be together at some point, and that everything would change, that they wouldn’t be the balanced triangle they had always been. But he hadn’t been expecting them to break up the way they had the day after winter holiday, with Hermione crying and telling Ron she needed someone who understood her feelings, and Ron bellowing that he didn’t know how to deal with her, she was too complicated.
emblazoned on your arse. But serve me well...and you’ll be treated like a king.”
Boot gave him a thumbs up without lifting his face. “By Tuesday, boss.”
Draco sighed. He’d seen this coming a mile away.
...he’s thinking these things to distract himself from the fact that his body is currently rushing around the castle trying to find Draco Malfoy. It’s blurry as it often is in his dreams. This must be a memory.
Well. Sort of.
“Perhaps we should find an unlocked closet, Headmaster,” Harry said, not looking at Dumbledore.
As Boot was mouthing
“Why did he do that? I didn’t hear anything about any extra credit assignment,” Draco said.
Malfoy turned, and his face looked drawn and pinched, white as a sheet. “You’re here, Headmaster,” he said, only taken aback for a moment. “What was it you wished to discuss with me?”
Sneering at him, Draco said, “Oh, good morning, Potter. Sorry I haven’t got around to replying to your love note, I was writing my mum instead. But I suppose you haven’t got that to fill your time.”
Harry shook his head, but the voice was overpowering, cloying, like it was soaking him with some viscous fluid, making his vision blurred. Hermione was replaced with a wandless Ron, who cried out in fear, lifting his hands to his face, and Harry braced himself, but then—
Malfoy, looking terrified and cold, huddled into himself, wearing only rags, and on his bare left forearm the Dark Mark seethed and glowed, and he screamed—
“G-god Harry I’m so close.”
Lastly, he’d received a golden snitch from Draco. Which had personalized engraving on it; adorning a small snake and a small lion carved next to each other on the Snitch’s center.
He sighed, “Yes…?”
“Oh-” Hermione stopped short.
Just as he felt Draco smile through their kiss, there was a knock on the door.
Ron spoke from his other side.
Harry clung to Draco, knowing full well that the pleasure coursing through his body made him unable to sit up right. Draco held him back, his face still nuzzled into Harry’s neck, placing soft kisses below his ear.
Ron, Harry and Neville beamed at him.
Both ideas seemed mental in Harry’s mind.
“Right my go, I pick Neville,” As he turned to him, Ron asked, “Truth or dare?”
“That’s great,” Hermione said smiling, “I personally want to get into the Ministry as soon as I can, especially after Harry told us what happened to you Draco. There’s still a long way to go, I don’t want to waste any time.”
“Humble as ever,” Pansy said, rolling her eyes. “Honestly Potter I don’t think it’d make a difference. Even if that git did set them off, which he definitely did, Draco and Blaise reacted, and that’ll count for something.”
“It’s alright Potter, I admit, you have every right to be suspicious.”
“Mum please!” Ron’s face had turned a shade of pink from both embarrassment and suffocation, as he looked nervously around him.
Harry felt Draco’s erection rub against his own through their thin layer of boxer shorts.
Harry’s green eyes blazed.
There was Blaise, holding the dark haired man's hands behind his back as Draco punched him hard in the stomach. The man groaned and Blaise let go of him as he fell clumsily into the snow. Blaise kicked him hard so that the man rolled over onto his back. Then Draco was on him again. The blond straddled him, then started punching mercilessly into his face.
“So school unity? Where does that leave us?”
“How would they even fit that many separate rooms in one tower?” Harry asked.
“Harry,” Draco’s voice was barely a whisper as wide grey eyes turned to him.
Draco must have sensed Harry’s hesitation, because the blond squeezed his hand and led him towards his perfectly made bed that lined the wall that was furthest away from the entrance.
The thin layer of Harry’s boxers provided an ample feeling of Draco’s erection rubbing against his own.
“Shhh!” Madam Pince hissed from her desk.
“Pfft! At this hour?”
“I have a natural remedy for neck pain.”
Before he knew it, Harry’s breathing had quicked and his head had lulled back onto his own pillow. His eyes were squeezed shut as he faced the ceiling, rubbing his hand against himself more quickly.
“Uh, I’m close.”
He found himself sitting irritably; the clear sunny sky shining on his face, but his shoes dug uncomfortably in a layer of snow on the ground.
Draco folded his arms, but then Harry looked at him properly, regaining his defiance.
“I also got a good sleep in.”
Her voice was soft and understanding, it reminded him of Molly.
And not a moment later, did he feel Draco come as well. The blond had released Harry’s waist and gripped his hair instead, as he growled into Harry’s neck.
Harry moaned and threw his head back at the touch. Draco chuckled, then swiftly undid Harry’s fly, pushing down his trousers slightly and gripped his palm around Harry’s cock.
Potter’s hair gave a vague whimper of shape and then flopped back down into his face again.
The Great Hall was nearly empty but for Draco, Crabbe and Goyle, and a few others late that evening, and he sat there looking moodily off into the distance, but making sure he was still pretty. He leaned back on the bench, looking aesthetically pleasing as he nibbled at a muffin, when he saw Susan Bones and Justin Finch-Fletchley over at the Hufflepuff table snogging. He gagged and looked away.
Madam Pince glared at Harry, but Malfoy still didn’t look up. Harry couldn’t even see the top half of his face, which was obscured by the draping ridiculous fringe that Malfoy probably thought looked elegant and debonair. Well, it
“Shall we away back to school, Harry?” Dumbledore asked him, extending an arm. “I think we can have a cup of tea together there.”
“You should’ve been a Slytherin, sir,” Draco said, sneering with about half his usual force.
“Sort of,” Hermione said. “Close enough for now. But how Amortentia functions is that it makes the brewer closer, in the mind of the victim, to their ideal of attraction. It makes their magics and themselves more compatible. And...well, it has a stronger effect the more compatible the two people are. Usually, if two people are very attractible, Amortentia doesn’t ever come into play, because they’ll just find their way together on their own, with their magic as a guide, so there aren’t a lot of examples of what happens when a pair of highly compatible witches or wizards use it. Do you know what I’m saying?”
Harry went down into the groove again. It was nearly a foot deep. He muttered something about his steps being retraced enough.
“Well—I mean, Blaise—Dumbledore’s all that’s protecting us from the Dark Lord, and—”
“No,” he said, and set off, out of McGonagall’s office and down the hall. Summerby, the Hufflepuff Seeker, passed him, and they exchanged waves.
Harry wished he didn’t feel so chastised. “Yes,” he said. “Of course.”
“I know that neither you, Ms. Parkinson, nor you, Mr. Malfoy, are yet seventeen. While Mr. Nott is of age and can do whatever he likes for the war effort, the two of you will need to be kept safe and hidden from the end of the school year until your seventeenth birthdays.”
“I don’t know,” Blaise said, his hand remaining possessively on the Vanishing Cabinet.
an easy question,” Pansy said, making a face. “Fuck Potter and the other two can just go wherever the hell they want, I don’t even care.”
“Yes.”
“You’ve been so busy messing with Potter I don’t think you’ve been paying much attention to what’s going on in your own House, Draco,” Theo said. “Everyone is terrified. The Dark Lord is threatening them, their families. They’re—well,
To Ron and Pansy Parkinson, who were emerging from a broom closet with what looked like an entire tube of lipstick on Ron’s face.
“Are they actually about the events that occurred?” Hermione said.
“But anyway,” said Draco, “the reason we need to recruit is that our group isn’t finished yet. Before we can pull anything we need a cover, someone to make sure we’re beyond suspicion.”
Harry recoiled. “Hermione, what—?”
Potter had the audacity to grin at him when he took off the Cloak, leaning back against a huge tower of stuff, which squeaked alarmingly. Potter didn’t appear to notice. Probably too busy with his visions of sugarplum fairies.
“No,” Harry snapped. “I don’t want to have sex with you!”
“Five points from Slytherin,” Granger said.
“Malfoy!”
“I understand that you’re upset, Harry, but it doesn’t really seem like you’re upset in the right way. This was a serious breach of your rights, and—”
“Yes.”
Harry opened his mouth and found himself unable to speak.
“Are you ready?” Dumbledore asked him, still holding tight to Harry’s arm.
Draco sank down in his seat at the Slytherin table. Since the Dark Lord had killed his father the summer before, somehow getting into Azkaban to exact revenge on an unsatisfactory servant, his mother was all he had. Bizarrely, the first thought that came to mind was that he wasn’t going to be getting any more packages of sweets.
The end conclusion of all of this thinking he was doing, Draco decided while stamping from Potions to the greenhouses and tossing his newly red hair, which he was ABSOLUTELY going to pull off and would REFUSE to let wash out his alabaster complexion, was that he needed to stay at Hogwarts. As much as he hated this school, with its Harry Potter-worship and Dumbledore’s blatant partisanship toward Gryffindors and Hagrid, he...well. It was the place he was safest.
. Otherwise Potter’d tell on him.
...okay, maybe he had let Baddock convince him to watch
“Petrificus Totalus!” came an all-too-familiar voice from behind him.
“Why?” Draco said. “I was fearing for my life and you were in the library? Merlin’s sagging balls, woman! Have a little compassion!”
“I know something about that, I suppose,” said Potter with a wry smile.
“I’ve been looking all over for you,” Potter said, pouting at Draco (the pout was...not terrible. Draco could’ve given him a few pointers. He was not using the green eyes to his advantage) and hopping off the bed himself. He moved forward slowly, in an awkward gait that Draco realized in a moment of terrible clarity was his attempt at a seductive sashay.
“Well...yes.”
His tutors had never been in this situation.
Harry shook his head, mystified. Slim, quiet Theo Nott, whose father was rumored to be a Death Eater who’d make Lucius Malfoy look like a kindergarten teacher, wasn’t someone he knew much about, let alone someone he’d think to approach about a Horcrux.
“What’s going on with him?” Draco asked, furrowing his brow.
Draco gave her his best winning smile, which curved up (or he supposed down at this exact moment) on the left side and had a 93 percent success rate of making women immediately give him whatever he wanted.
“Are you trying to get me to fight you?”
Look at me, actually posting on time?? Incredible.
“Sounds good,” Boot said.
“It’s going to be okay now,” he whispered, and after a beat added, “Do you want to hit me?”
“I’ve been having these...dreams,” Harry said, and at Hermione’s questioning look, added, “Not like usual, these are different. They’re...well, I think they’re about what happened when I was under the Amortentia last week.”
"I came down here to fight you,” Harry told him.
“What are you doing that to me for?” he asked, widening his eyes and hoping that his pout would be half as effective if viewed from the wrong direction. “I didn’t do anything.”
“Hermione is the one with the plans,” Ron said desperately. “It’s not your job, Harry, you’ll...overextend yourself.”
“I’ve already hit him twice,” Granger said. “You don’t need to do it again. At least not now. You should take a shower, wash the ferret off.”
“Well, as my designated Ravenclaw minion, you would mostly stick around to provide me with necessary information at opportune times. Mostly on Harry Potter, and ways to make his life miserable,” Draco said.
“That sounds nice enough,” said Boot. “I like Candyland.”
“Well, usually it’s mostly just a replay of what I did, at least as far as I know. I feel—” Harry paused, his face hot— “I feel a need, like I’m chasing after something I need to live.”
“And what the fuck are you doing here?” Draco crossed his arms.
“I can hear you thinking something ridiculous and inadvisable,” Hermione said, not looking up from her book.
“You wish,” Harry said, and leaped through the door to the office first.
Well. Two somethings.
“We didn’t know you were in here!” Harry said.
“I’m sure,” Draco said, indicating his body. “No one can get enough of this.”
“So this is what it feels like to be ‘Arry Potter,” Seamus said as he looked back at all the prying eyes. He patted Harry roughly on the back, “Sorry mate.”
At the mention of his name, Draco turned. He was frowning, but Harry could’ve sworn he saw curiosity creep onto his expression. Urged on by this fickle fact, Harry spoke again.
As Draco’s head had fallen back onto Harry’s shoulder and his face was turned into the crevice of Harry’s neck, Harry softly whispered.
“So wait, you’ve liked me all this time?! So...So when you say, you’ve worked out what our gravitational pull means, you mean-”
“Potter?”
Harry rolled his eyes, “Yeah, yeah. Well, I’m making an effort now.”
When Harry and Draco entered Draco’s room, Draco practically slammed Harry up against the wall, immediately devouring his neck.
He kissed her on the cheek before excessive amounts of food suddenly appeared on silver platters all around their table.
“But we’re here to fly. So if you could all stand in a line please.”
Harry hummed into it, suddenly needing friction as he began to grind down into Draco.
Harry shrugged, “I admire what you’re doing Hermione, you know, wanting to change the system from within, but working in the Ministry just isn’t for me.”
Draco grunted in frustration, following his friend into the common room. The door slamming behind them, leaving Harry alone in the corridor, utterly perplexed.
Harry swallowed, “We’re not good for each other Hermione… We’re alright from afar, but not this close.”
“Does it really matter anymore? We’re here now...I think this was the way it was supposed to be...You and me, coming together after everything.”
“Hey!” Neville interrupted him.
Harry’s inside swam with overwhelming warmth and guilt. He didn’t believe he deserved such acceptance.
Harry then thought, since they were already on the topic of discussion, he’d better tell Ron and Hermione the news about his sudden change of career plan.
Draco could only laugh lightly, “No. I think it was just the expectation of our houses. For some reason we were made to believe that Slytherin’s and Gryffindor’s weren’t allowed to get along. But we’re past that now.”
“Oh dear,” Hermione mumbled.
As Harry’s eyes returned to his path ahead, he noticed a figure sitting in front of the old beech tree that he, Ron and Hermione had claimed as rightfully their own.
“Only one way to find out.” Seamus said.
Harry shrugged, “I’m sure when Lucius gets wind of it my life’ll probably be ended anyway.”
Dumbledore smiled sadly. Harry pressed on.
At that moment, Draco pushed Harry back off of him and tackled him to the ground.
My Mother isn’t doing so well being in this huge house by herself, so I’m planning to stay here for a bit longer.
“Is that bad?”
Ron just shrugged.
Harry groaned involuntarily at the sudden friction and gripped Draco’s hair tightly.
Some adult wizards had broken into the middle of the circle. One grabbed Draco by his arms and pulled him roughly back. Another pulled Blaise’s hands behind him, as he struggled to break free. And then another two wizards were kneed in the snow, slowly helping the beaten man up. His mouth and nose were bloody.
“Draco, I… I don’t want to but,” Harry swallowed, “I need to get out of here before your friends see me.”
‘To Draco,
Draco choked. Harry didn’t think Blaise’s eyebrows could rise further up his forehead.
Harry shrugged, “Maybe.”
After the initial shock had eventually subsided, and prominent drinks had been drunk, everyone became a lot more comfortable.
“But it says we’re only allowed two per subject.” Harry said.
“Why are you two still up?” He shot back.
There was a slight pause, before Draco continued.
After a few minutes of pushing, shoving, punching and rolling about each other, Draco sat back quickly to remove his sweater, revealing a plain white T-shirt underneath. Harry’s breath hitched at the sight of Draco’s toned arms. Then, realising he was also uncomfortably hot in his own clothes, moved to also pull his own hoodie over his head but Draco caught him in his distraction.
That night in the common room, Harry and Draco sat alone by the fire.
When Draco eventually rolled off of Harry, he cast a wordless Cleaning charm and they both settled under the covers, seemingly sleepy, blissful and content.
As Harry looked, he saw faint white scars painted across Draco’s middle, and Harry suddenly felt sick with guilt.
“So I guess I missed the sorting?” Harry asked. He really didn’t feel like he was gone for that long, but it appeared as though the first years had been sorted and McGonagall had already delivered her Welcome Feast speech.
Harry shook his head. All images of blond hair and Slytherin ties floating away from his mind.
“U-Uh…I just needed to walk off the dinner, was feeling a little full.” Harry said as he scratched the back of his neck.
“Yep.”
----------------------------
Harry felt Draco snap turn his head toward him at the mention of him and Draco being friends.
It felt so good, Harry couldn’t deny it. He had fully succumbed to the strangeness and yet utterly satisfying moment.
Harry choked out a breath at the sudden friction.
“It’s complicated Potter,” Draco breathed, “I just… I just want you to sleep with me. I haven’t been getting much sleep lately.”
Harry looked at him seriously, “I am.” So the truth serum was still stirring in his bloodstream then.
Draco instinctively grabbed Harry’s hair, hissing and letting his head fall back against the wall.
“Oh G-god, Draco.”
Harry dug his head into Draco’s neck and breathed in his delicious scent, before running his tongue up his neck just below the blond’s ear.
“What are you talking about Parkinson?” Ron burped looking at her, obviously still too hungover to be engaged in civilised conversation.
As the trio walked further toward the back of the train so as to escape the attention, Harry saw three familiar Slytherin’s heading toward them, also trying to find a compartment. Pansy Parkinson led the way with her head held high, followed by Draco Malfoy and then Theodore Nott at the rear.
He shrugged, “It’s written across Weasley’s Wizard’s Chess board.”
“Ron!” Hermione said shrilly.
She turned and stood, “Took you long enough.”
“This is mental. We’re really sitting here discussing Harry’s future with a git we’ve hated for five years. Merlin things just get stranger and stranger as the years go on.”
Again, they stared. And it was as though all of the unsaid feelings they were afraid to admit were being conveyed silently between the two.
Not having you around has made me realise how much I need you Draco, how much you mean to me.
“Yeah it’s all sunshine and daisy’s for you!” Neville’s face contorted with annoyance, “I knew I should’ve just stayed at Hogwarts, my Gran’s a nightmare, even more so at Christmas!”
“He did?” Harry asked, slightly shocked.
The two started laughing again, leaning on each other as they tried to catch their breath. Even Crabbe had started to giggle as he caught onto the reality of the situation.
, nearly the entire summer.
Draco stood and brushed himself off. “Well. Thank you, Granger.”
Of course, Potter had broken any number of school rules for years and years, more than Draco had, but he wasn’t getting expelled, and even if he did, he wouldn’t be immediately killed by the Dark Lord.
Ron flushed, and in the firelight his whole body looked pink and red and orange like a sunset.
“What you said about Zabini…” Potter began.
“In general dreams mean that your subconscious is trying to process what’s been happening to it. In instances where you’ve been influenced by magic, perhaps it’s merely another attempt to process,” Hermione said. “But I’ve never heard about anything like this happening to Amortentia victims.”
Since he’d already slept with him, the first potential Ravenclaw minion Draco approached was Terry Boot.
“Cho, Michael, good to see you,” he said. “Terry. Anthony.”
“Yes.”
“Harry, my boy,” Dumbledore said upon Harry’s entry to his office. His blackened hand was cradled close to his body but he outstretched the other to Harry, smiling. “Have you been sleeping well?”
You moved fast, Harry, didn’t you? Well, you’re going to have to go find a broom closet or something, because--”
“Besides,” he said, “you’re my minion now. And if there’s one thing Slytherins know how to do, it’s protect their own. I’ll deal with it. You go to the hospital wing and tell Madam Pomfrey you’re feeling sick and need some rest. I’m sure she’ll buy it, since you look like a freshly-passed bezoar. I’ll take notes for you in class.”
“Ah, the food is better here?” Luna asked. “I’m not sure how that’s possible, Harry. I think the house-elves put the same thing at every table.”
Before he could take it all in, Blaise was forging ahead, between the piles and under bridges of objects unknown. Draco followed as quickly as he could, and after a few minutes of trekking in silence through the Room they came to a large black cabinet. It looked vaguely familiar, and it only took Draco a few seconds of observation to realize why.
On balance, it was certainly better than his usual mysterious dreams, which usually involved bestiality and disembowelment (sometimes concurrently) and ended with him screaming. Ron’d been asking questions about why Harry was sleeping so quietly of late. Harry was seriously considering discussing it with Hermione, who might have some idea what was going on. He’d ask Dumbledore, but...yeah. No.
all looking to you.”
“Well—”
“Agreed,” Harry and Ron said at the same time, and proceeded back to Gryffindor Tower.
“What do you want, Potter?” he hissed, looking for all the world like a pale, nervous cat.
“What do you think they mean?” Harry asked impatiently.
“That’s certainly not true,” Boot said. “If you’d wanted a beautiful face to look at you’d have gone and looked in the mirror.”
“I’m not going anywhere with you,” Harry said, but when Malfoy started to walk away he followed. Maybe he was just a glutton for punishment.
“Yes.”
“Look, Potter,” he said as they left the Room. “I—when I said that thing earlier, about your mum...that was just to get Blaise to trust me.”
“You can look now,” she said finally, and when they turned she had her arms crossed and was blowing a loose curl from her face. Nott beside her was looking resolutely at the floor, his face bright red.
“How long is this parchment?” Draco asked.
As his world collapsed around him, Draco Malfoy reflected that everything had been going just fine until Goyle dropped the wrong damn hair into the potion.
“Kinky,” Pansy said.
Once he got inside, he sat down on a squashy sofa to try and think about things, but he hadn’t slept well the night before, his rest punctured by The Dream, and found himself drifting off.
“So why don’t you?” Malfoy said. “Are you trying to extort me for sex? Because that’s been done. Multiple times.”
Harry stared at Hermione, who looked...almost a little bashful. “You can’t choose who you’re compatible with, Harry. Your magical core does. I could be wrong.”
"What—” Malfoy asked from behind him and followed Harry’s gaze.
“Yes,” Harry said automatically, looking to Dumbledore. They’d entered a room he hadn’t been in much before—the parlor. Around them stood Lupin, who gave Harry a reassuring smile, Mad-Eye Moody, and—Harry’s lip curled despite himself—Snape. The harsh yellow light from the overhead lamps seemed wrong for the occasion, like a strange intrusion of reality into a dream.
“Harry?” came Granger’s voice, and Draco had never been more relieved to hear it. He immediately took back all the times he’d inwardly thought of it as shrill. And called it shrill out loud. And yelled that it was shrill across any room the two of them happened to be occupying.
2. I have another album rec this week: Never Gonna Dance Again, Act 2 by Taemin. It's a perfect album, he's art, period. I did also write some of this chapter to it and there's a song called Pansy, which is oddly apropos.
“NO!” Harry and Malfoy shouted simultaneously.
“I figured,” Potter said.
“Yes.”
“You shall see in a moment, my boy,” Dumbledore said, releasing Harry’s arm and opening the griffin-guarded staircase. Malfoy sneered at Harry. Harry sneered back, but he feared it wasn’t much of a competition both because of his relative lack of experience and the fact that he was still a little rattled from the vision the locket had given him, where Malfoy had been even thinner and paler than he was now, where the Dark Mark had lurked on his arm.
Draco gave a delicate little shiver, which until that point had been reserved solely for instances in which Potter got within six feet of him.
A few things:
“I’ve been helping him for years, and he doesn’t even know who I am or care about what I’ve done for him,” Boot said. “I wouldn’t mind teaching him a lesson about the value of Ravenclaws. I’ll stop short at killing him, but roughing him up a bit wouldn’t go amiss.”
“RON?” Harry asked at the same time as Malfoy squawked, “PANSY?”
“Fine,” Potter said, watching Draco with some concern as he got shakily to his feet. “But I’m coming with you. You could pass out, you know.”
One of the greatest strengths of Slytherin House was its members’ ability to waste time with great efficacy.
“Because I changed my mind.” Harry sighed. “Why did you do that? With the love potion?”
3. I'm not sure how to TW this chapter, since there's nothing specific that happens to warn against, but it's a bit darker than some of the others, so please keep that in mind. If you have any concerns or questions feel free to let me know.
No one.
He glanced out of the corner of his eye at Potter.
Potter had already moved from his mouth to his jaw, and then to his neck, kissing beside his ear, and the squeak of alarm and...arousal? that Draco somehow heard come out of his own mouth woke him up. He slipped under Potter’s grip and with Potter still grasping at his waist, bolted for the door and aimed his wand at it, attempting to dismantle the wards as Potter began mouthing at the back of his neck and Draco shivered. He almost let himself relax into it, not because he wanted Potter kissing his neck but because, well...it felt good to be touched, to have the comfort of human contact. It had been a while since he’d been touched any way but violently.
He grimaced as he subtly pointed his wand at Blaise and whispered, “Legilimens.”
“I don’t know,” Harry said. “Malfoy here was being awfully cryptic.”
“That’s absurd!” Pansy exclaimed. “I can help too. I’m nearly seventeen, God knows I’m more competent than either of these numbskulls—Professor, isn’t there anything I can do?”
made—include growing his tongue, making him crash his broom, and Portkeying him to America. I also need you to help me recruit.”
Harry thumped down on the sofa opposite Ron, who startled and looked over at him with wild eyes.
He sat bolt upright. So Hufflepuffs did have a use after all. And it was one that could solve all Draco’s problems.
” Draco straightened. “What do you mean, ‘go to Dumbledore?’”
“Seeing as I’m the one who has to defeat Voldemort, it does actually seem like it is my business, a bit,” Potter said.
Draco shrugged. Someone had to make sure Granger didn’t come top in every subject. He was just looking out for the little people.
But Dumbledore shook his head. “I’m sorry, Ms. Parkinson. However, we can allow you to be housed at Order headquarters, where your...abundant competence can aid in strategy and intelligence work remotely. Does that satisfy?”
She placed his hand over his beneath the table and squeezed, “It’s alright Harry. Besides, you’re right. They can’t keep Draco away for much longer considering he’s a NEWT student. That’s unfair.”
“Pansy, Blaise, sit here,” Harry said as Theo had sat down with Ernie and Neville.
Draco snorted, “Yeah, right, like the whole wizarding world’s gonna believe that? Surely you know better Potter.”
