I'm not as much as sucking, as caressing the cock with my tongue and lips for several minutes without even touching it with my hand; both of my hands are holding his thighs. I'd rub his thighs as well, but I can't. Because he is Malfoy. And that would be too much.
Draco long ago acquiesced and stopped considering himself straight, but he still had not dared to try it with a man. Mostly because it seemed that the only man he was drawn to was Harry. Draco was not even sure whether he found Harry attractive, at least attractive the same way as women. He was only certain about his own desire that Harry's suggestive or outright pornographic thoughts never failed to ignite within him.
"Well... Anyway, I didn't say that I stopped liking women all of a sudden. And who said that they were witches? Some were muggles. At least one."
I grab the shaft and start stroking it slowly. Merlin, how good if feels in my hand. I close my eyes to cut off as much sensory information as possible and to just better feel how it throbs between my fingers. Amazing... I as always feel the urge to take it into my mouth straight away. But no. Not yet. I have to let him simmer.
"Pff... It's so... It doesn't even count really. Don't break the law and read ONE book a month that Hermione gives me? When I was six or seven there was much more that was expected of me. The expectations were different, sure, but the pressure was already there."
"Statistics says the former is far more likely. I just want you to weigh all the consequences first. Carefully. Because IF, as you stressed, we're going to break up, it going to be a bitch for you to get a girlfriend. At least if she's not a muggle."
After rinsing the shampoo from Harry's head, Draco grabbed the sponge and soap, and started to wash Harry's body. Slowly and deliberately rubbing Harry's back, his sides, his arms, thanking gods that Harry at least for the past few minutes hasn't made any comments. For many years Draco has been thinking that nothing could bring him out of poise, until he got to live with Harry.
Draco picked up his books and stepped into the long poorly lit corridor. He almost stumbled out of the surprise from seeing Harry leaning on a wall right beside the bathroom. It looked as if Harry was waiting for him. But Draco right away dismissed that thought as completely nonsensical. He tried to look as if he hadn't almost tripped over nothing and continued onward, but only managed to make a few steps before he heard Harry call him.
I shift a bit closer and breathe in deeply. I do it slowly, as to not to be obvious in case Malfoy watches. I like the smell. It's faint and barely there. But I'd recognize it everywhere. Malfoy's smell.
I know that he's getting there by his breathing and how much often his muscles start to contract. Particularly on his abdomen. I don't even think about slowing down. I make his cockhead hit the back of my mouth on each stroke, even though I'm at my limit and barely hold myself from gagging. I want him to enjoy it... No! I do it only to get his cum! His pleasure is incidental and completely irrelevant! ... If he would only grab my head and force me to deep-throat him... I'd take a face-fucking. Even through gagging. I can take it if he wants me to.
"Indeed, Draco, why am I?" Draco huffed, on what Harry grinned. Draco never called him by his last name besides on moments like that. As if that helped him to distance himself on some level. "We're gonna get you rid of your pent-up stresses..."
Done with Harry's back, Draco asked him to turn. Harry did and Draco started to rub the sponge over Harry's chest in circles, slowly going lower and lower.
"W-what is it?" mumbled Harry opening his eyes and looking at Draco's outline in the light from the corridor. He glanced at the clock - it showed almost two in the morning.
A sharp pain from a slap to his left cheek brought Harry back into reality. "W-what?!" stammered Harry.
Ministry lifts were slow. But that had been the case for ages, and almost everybody, including Draco, was so used to it that a thought that it might be different never crossed their minds. His, and by extension Harry's, floor was on the minus seventeenth level, so the ride there, with a multitude of stops along the way, took a good five minutes as usual. During which at first Draco went through an imaginary spanking and then fucking.
If only it didn't happen in such inconvenient moments! Nobody would pull out an issue of Playwizard while eating! At least nobody of sound mind. Which, once again, proved that Potter was at least a little insane...
Draco's face once again got red, but he managed to hold himself in check and show no other reaction, mainly by staring at the ceiling.
"And don't forget to clean the dishes like yesterday." Draco motioned back to the lots of dirty pots and plates strewn all over the counter and sink area. "I'm not going to do it with my hands again when it costs you a wave of your wand. I'd rather go to Azkaban."
"Where is the famous Gryffindor courage? Don't you have any left?!" said Draco somewhat resentfully as he heard the sound of running water after Harry opened a tap, in full confidence that silencing charms wouldn't let it out of the cubicle; venting his frustration verbally always helped him more than seething silently. Even knowing that he had a tendency to blame an unchanging status quo on somebody else, Harry in this case, than on his own inaction, he could not help but continue in the same vein, "Why wouldn't you ask something already?! Fuck, Potter, Fuck!" He repeatedly hit the back of his head against the wall. With a dejected voice, believing that he was speaking into the void, he finished with, "I would do anything... Just ask... Ask, damn you to hell!"
"- for you to talk to men. Heard it a hundred times already. For that case there are toys. Magical ones, I mean. They can do a pretty decent job on their own if you into that kind of thing. I never liked them though and rather just wank. I'm sure Hermione, like most witches, knows what's best. Ask her."
Finally I feel satisfied with it and part my lips. But then stop. No, first with the tongue... I pull my tongue out and start to caress the glans with its tip. Barely touching it at first. I finally able to taste his precum. It spurs me on. But then I pull my tongue as far as possible, thought it isn't too different, and start swirling it around the cockhead. I wish I had a longer tongue. With my hand I pull on the shaft away from my mouth, making the ridge of skin holding the foreskin stretch and then start tickle it with my tongue. I hear the first indication that Malfoy likes it as he lets out barely perceptible slow exhale through his nose. I hope he's desperate for me to finally take it into my mouth. But I'll go on my pace. As always. So it's just incidental. I am, in fact, deciding that right now is the time.
The lift was gradually getting emptier and emptier all the while the imaginary-Draco was pressed, but gently, as always, cheek-first into the lacquered wooden wall of the cabin and fucked from behind. The imaginary-Draco seemingly enjoyed it more than the imaginary-Harry.
Draco froze mid-bite and his cheeks got a bit pink. He put his fork down and as calmly as he could muster said, "So what if I was? I finished my shift. I was back here on time. Nobody said that it wasn't allowed. What laws did I break exactly?"
What for Draco was still a burning mystery was how Harry knew how his erection looked like. Because it was spot on. Draco had no doubt that Harry had seen him naked, most likely in showers, a small birthmark at the top of Draco's left thigh being present in the fantasies proved that. But that did not answer the question. Draco never wanked at public showers and Harry hardly could've extrapolated what Draco's erection would look like from his flaccid cock with such accuracy.
When their imaginary-selves switched places Draco was simply holding his cock, with his wet thumb gently brushing its glans. Anything more and he would cum. With his eyes closed watching imaginary-Harry slobber all over imaginary-Draco's dick. This was the only kind of first person view Draco not just was able to tolerate, but actually liked - when Harry sucked him off while concentrating on the sensations of it with his eyes closed. This way Draco was able to pretend with ease that it was he who was sucking off Harry instead. All Draco had to do was to keep his mind clear, making it a blank canvas onto which Harry would project his thoughts.
What Draco liked the most about his ability to read Harry's mind was to not just know that he was desirable in that way, but to actually feel it. If only Potter held himself in check more, and didn't indulge in it so damn much! Sometimes, especially when those visions happened when Draco saw Harry with Ginny, not that over the years it had happened more than a handful of times, he wanted nothing more than to grab Harry by his shoulders and shout in his face, "What the fuck, Potter?! Don't you have any shame whatsoever?? Hold yourself in check!"
Harry smiled and wiggled his eyebrows, making Draco blush. "All you have to do is to ask. Or to order."
Draco did not forget that Harry had an invisibility cloak. But so what? With Draco's self-consciously-driven paranoia there hardly could have been a possibility for Harry to spy on him wanking. Even back in Hogwarts, or more so in there, since Draco had been even more uptight back then. But overall Draco did not think that Harry spying on him wanking was something Harry would do. Draco thought that the most plausible option was for Harry to pay some of Draco's past girlfriends to get a memory to see in a Pensieve. And if so, Harry, of course, would've paid handsomely on top of that for a magically binding non-disclosure clause, so there was no point of contacting them to inquire.
"Gimme," said Harry holding out his hand. Draco gave him the remote and Harry turned back to the channel Draco wanted to watch. "Mmm... They aren't even all that good-looking. The pair in a blowjob is way hotter." Harry switched back to the blowjob. "And besides, remember how two months ago you were happy to have a Playwizard with ten-seconds-long moving pictures?" Harry tried to imitate Draco's voice as he added, "And with no sound!"
Snape grabbed Harry by his shirt and slammed him against the wall. Not hard, but it had a similarly sobering effect as a slap a minute before. "I would've taken it from you by now if for not one crucial detail - it HAS to be given willingly!"
"But I like having sex!" said Harry standing beside Draco's bed, clutching a pillow he brought along hoping to get in bed with Draco for the first time without having any prior discussion about it.
"There's no more left." Harry looked at him pointedly, waiting for an explanation. Draco shrugged not meeting his eyes. "What do you expect?! Your new house-elf isn't too good at cooking yet." Harry grinned. "Although with this" - Draco pulled his right leg from under the table and made his ministry-issued magic-blocking bracelet on his ankle jingle - "I hardly can be called even a house-elf."
"You see this?! Incredible, right??" said Draco, almost jumping on the balls of his feet. "And with the sound! Wicked!"
A minute later Draco stopped mid-stroke as he heard somebody walk into the bathroom. Then the door of the adjacent cubicle clicked shut and once again there was total silence. Just like in most places, all Ministry bathroom cubicles had a multitude of standard charms for increased comfort and privacy, including outgoing silencing charms that didn't let sounds out, only in. Draco huffed, not trying to be discreet. He absolutely hated to be disturbed while wanking. He needed peace of mind for that, and it was difficult as it was to be doing it in a stall of a public bathroom instead of the safety of his own home. There was an easy solution for that, but he never dared to cast two-way silencing charms fearing that it might interfere with the existing ones and trigger a cascading effect that might lead to all kinds of unforeseeable consequences; ever since the incident with his first Arithmancy project it was a phobia of his.
"First of all, chances are, this hypothetical girlfriend wouldn't agree. And second - I already have a boyfriend."
"Exactly. Just say that I should go to my knees and choke on your cock. ... Or to lie on the couch with my head hanging over the armrest so you can go around and fuck my throat."
"I might've found a tiny bit of sense in all your nonsense when Draco was still on parole. He's a free wizard now. He did not leave Harry."
"Not as easy without your hero status, right?" Draco said smirking. "You have to do more than just show your face to get witches fall all over you?"
At first Draco hated the whole mind-reading thing. He felt almost violated watching Harry do all those things with or to him in his own head. It was like unavoidable sexual harassment for which Draco could not complain because he had zero proof. And who knew what Ministry officials would do to him, a pardoned convict, if it came out that he was able to read the mind of the holiest of holies - Harry Potter's?! Gradually Draco began to consider Harry's fantasies not more than a nuisance. After a bit more he accepted them the same way he accepted the weather. He was living in Britain, so not infrequently it rained and he could not do anything about it. So with time Harry's fantasies, just like rain, grew on him. And before long, without him even noticing how it happened, Draco started liking them.
The only thing that annoyed Draco a little was that Harry, as was not unusual for him to do while masturbating, seemingly was incapable of sticking to one thing and constantly switched scenarios. This time between fucking Draco and sucking him off. And, to his luck, for the first few minutes Draco was watching everything from a third person view. Masturbating to the visuals of fucking himself was weird no matter how many times he had seen it. Not that Draco never came to that though.
Harry's left leg was slung over Draco's right, a cock in each hand as he was working for both of them. Each has come already an hour earlier, so Harry wasn't even sure if he were able to bring himself or Draco to completion in their state once more. The program was unusual though. They showed close-ups of women making out. That what got Harry thinking that Draco might agree.
Their one-way connection was abruptly cut seconds later - Harry's climax always did that. As if the magic that sustained the transmission of thoughts was used up and had to recharge. And Draco once again was left one-on-one with himself.
"I... I..." stammered Draco, berating himself for succumbing to the sensations. "I meant to say just STOP that."
"No. Me saying all that shouldn't affect any potential jealousy on my behalf in case you're not a complete moron. And if you are a moron, then, given that I would know whether you are by now, me saying all that should only lessen any potential suspicions. Though depends on which levels we're thinking, if there's an even divide between us, then we might play ourselves. But since I'm probably higher up, means I can adjust my thinking to odd number and -"
"Well, I'm sorry that I can't leave your flat still! If you'd forget your ridiculous rule and find a witch... You are Harry Potter. Witches are going -"
Draco hands the vials back to him, then gets dressed slowly and deliberately, like he already knows which memories these are and he’s as anxious about it as Harry is.
Harry is faintly alarmed to discover that his cock, smeared all over with his own come, is already hardening again.
, in Auror parlance—and he’s found mostly that the gulf of his experience is too big, too deep to bridge.
Harry swallows. This is, unfortunately, really not helping his raging boner situation. “Right,” he says. “Carry on.”
Draco sighs like a shrug. “Too much tea after dinner, I imagine.” His eyes drop to the bag in Harry’s hand, then lift back to his face, amused. “Been out jewelry shopping, have we? I didn’t know anywhere was open this late.”
Ginny, when he’d finally staggered back to the flat, didn’t seem to have noticed he’d been missing. There’d been some gala, some charity something or other that night that all the Harpies had to attend, and she’d been fluttering around the flat in high heels and sparkling blue dress robes, hair spilling around her face in sheer waves while Harry lay flat on the floor next to the couch and tried to summon up the effort to go get a pepper-up potion.
Harry tosses and turns. Around one in the morning he wakes from a dream about Voldemort, and it takes him a good half an hour to convince himself that he killed him—that it’s not a mind trick, just because he remembers the aftermath but not the actual killing.
To here: avoiding Draco Malfoy’s gaze, everything he owns crammed in his pockets, his heart dragging heavy towards the floor like it wants him to collapse here, in the sanctum of Draco’s study, and not get up.
hate it, after all. “I don’t understand why you do the work, if you don’t enjoy it. It’s not as if it’s the easiest thing in the world.”
In the morning Draco’s owl lands in the middle of the breakfast table with an envelope for Harry. It’s magically encoded; Harry presses his thumb to the wax seal and startles back as a missive that must be five or six feet long unravels in his lap and spills onto the floor.
Even after he lost Ginny he kept the tradition of getting blindingly drunk after an Animagus assignment, which he views as an effective if not very elegant way to facilitate his crashing back into human society. Unfortunately, though, the moment he lands in the arrivals hall in the Ministry, the customs witch takes one look at him and screams for an emergency Portkey to St. Mungo’s.
“There you are,” says Draco, shoving in and staying so that Harry can shake apart endlessly on his cock. “There you are, Harry. Gorgeous. Perfect.” He takes hold of Harry’s cock to help coax the last few spurts of come from him, getting his hand all messy with it, hushing Harry’s harsh, guttural moans.
“These were my parents’,” Harry tells him. He reaches out and takes Draco’s hand. It’s a thin hand, thin fingers, delicate bones. On a whim he tries his mother’s ring. It fits. “They’re not magical rings, or anything,"  he says. "They’re just normal. But I—if it’s alright with you—I’d really like for us to wear them.”
He thinks he manages to get a sweater on before either of them can see it, but he’s not sure; Hermione’s giving him a look as she puts his kettle on like either she’s frustrated with him for the stack of unwashed dishes in the sink or she thinks he’s hiding something. Either way, Harry doesn’t get a chance to find out, because Ginny plants herself at his kitchen table and announces, “My agent called this morning.”
Harry pauses for a moment on the threshold, staring at the bed with its pretentious silk hangings. It’s still unmade, and it’s easy enough to imagine Malfoy slipping out of it not that long ago—rolling over, stretching, waking up by degrees. Harry wonders if the sheets are still warm. He wonders if Malfoy would let him climb in again if he asked, if he would lie on top of him and hold his face and call him
He stands over her shoulder while she makes the changes, then marches her down to the Ministry in her pajamas to swear an Unbreakable Oath before the notary in the Aurors’ office. It takes the better part of a day, but by the time Harry leaves her flat he’s got two silvery vials tucked in his inner robes pocket, and Rita Skeeter can only print anything about him and Draco, in any context, on pain of death.
Ron and Hermione are hot on his heels—making lots of noise, Harry’s sure, about what the hell is going on and why the hell Draco sodding Malfoy is romping through their flat in the middle of the night—but Harry barely knows they’re there.
The matter isn’t helped by the fact that he hates being in his snake form. When Kingsley’s predecessor, Robards, had asked Harry to become an Animagus, back when every decision from the Head Auror seemed to be some sort of crazy last-ditch effort to actually solve cases, he’d agreed mostly because he’d been expecting to turn out as a stag, like his dad, or at least a bloody big dog like Sirius. The first time he’d actually managed a transformation, after a month of carrying a mandrake leaf around under his tongue, he’d changed back immediately and spent the next week or so getting blindingly drunk at a string of Muggle pubs across London.
The door behind them bangs open. Harry barely has time to register a woman’s voice—a familiar voice, a voice that once saved his life—before Narcissa Malfoy rushes past them in a whirlwind of silken robes and white hair. She kicks off her high heeled shoes on the edge of the porch and goes barefoot into the grass, at her son’s side in a moment. Harry can’t make out many words; that’s what happens, with a memory this old. But he watches Draco cling to her and cry, watches her heal his scraped knee and soothe her hand over his hair, murmuring nothing words, calling him
Gradually and then all at once, Harry loses his battle with propriety. “Yes,” he says, with enough force that it comes out sounding sort of angry, and grabs Draco and pulls him down hard, so that they’re all tangled together in the sheets, in their clothes, “yes, Draco, yes,” kissing him over and over, fervently, and eventually Draco loses his vest and his belt and the fire sputters low in the hearth, and eventually again—kisses growing longer and longer, obscenely luxurious—they slip down a slow, shallow ramp into sleep.
“I don’t know,” Zabini says, in a tone of voice that Harry does not care for at all. “What’s in it for me, Draco?”
He lifts almost all the way off him, thighs shaking, and lowers back down. Draco makes a noise in the base of his throat, gutted, and says, “
Harry doesn’t fight it as Draco pulls his shirt over his head for him, as he helps him wriggle into the pants and the trousers and a thick pair of socks. He’s been freezing since he got back to London, and it’s a relief to finally be warm.
He chugs it all in one go, alcohol burning in his chest, and as the empty teacup floats itself back to its saucer, he finds Draco frowning at him from the end of the table.
. Harry feels like he should remember something about love, and Draco—he’s got that same itchy feeling in the back of his head he used to get thinking near his removed memories, and he wonders with alarm what he’s missing. What he could possibly be missing, when he’s already so in love with this man he’s sure it must be written in giant letters on his face.
“You,” Harry interrupts, face hot, bewildered and frustrated that Draco could think he would want anything else when Draco is
had portions of memory missing—that they were sitting in his safe at home, where they couldn’t terrorize him every waking moment. Malfoy might’ve signed an NDA to keep their cases confidential, but that didn’t prohibit him from reporting things to Harry’s boss, especially not things that might pose a danger in the field.
Eventually Harry pulls away—as far away as Draco will let him get, at least—and finds Ron and Hermione staring at him like he’s grown a second head. “Er,” he says, “I did tell you I was staying with Malfoy.”
He gets dressed on his way through the Manor’s cold, echoing halls, nearly trips down the marble stairs trying to get his right leg in his jeans—he’s still missing a toe from his last deep cover assignment, he’s been putting off going to St. Mungo’s to get it grown back and it’s fucked his balance—and emerges into the cold October night. The robes he put on this morning aren’t warm enough for the weather, and for a long moment he stands shivering on the front step, the only lights lit in the Manor too far away to reach him here, thinking that maybe he’s overreacted in the wrong direction, that if he goes back now and crawls into bed with Malfoy he can pass his absence off as needing the loo, that Malfoy will hiss and give him shit for his cold feet but will let him burrow his way back in, wrap himself around him, bury his face in the warmth of his neck. It’s a golden thing to imagine, and Harry wants it very badly.
Draco shakes his head. “Not exactly. Blaise was close, but he wasn’t quite there—he got lucky with his case, because she’d only been missing the memories a week. You’ve been missing yours months. Years.”
Only it wasn’t a danger, really. Harry never pulled memories that had to do with work, and he’d found that pulling memories of, say, learning to cast a Patronus didn’t actually take away his knowledge of how to cast a Patronus—just his memory of who’d taught him, where he’d been, what they’d said. Memory permeated too much, like spilling water on a tile floor. It got into the grout, into the tiny cracks. It filtered down through your whole life. You couldn’t remove it cleanly.
, really, like a house scheduled for demolition, tilting and about to fall over, except that doesn’t make any sense to say.
” Harry echoes. The sun is only just now coming up; the idea that things have been happening today, before this very second, is insane and unfathomable.
They wander mildly through Harry’s less dramatic vials, lingering at the back of the jostling Christmas-shopping crowd to watch that awkward moment with Cho, listening to Ginny’s shrill accusations ring through Diagon Alley.
“Ex-chaser for the Harpies,” Ginny tells her, but she’s making significant eyes at Harry over Hermione’s shoulder.
Harry follows cautiously, the bouncer’s eyes locked on his scar. As the door swings closed behind him, muffling the sex and grape-eating noises from outside, he turns and sees—“
, and the eyes of every witch and every wizard in the room seem to follow him, magnetized, like he’s a prize they all want to win.
his hindbrain declares emphatically, and anyone else that wants to touch Malfoy will have to go through him.
Harry remembers lying in the bathroom in Grimmauld Place, after he shoved Sirius’ funeral back into his head. He’d felt as if he’d just put his godfather in the ground all over again, ramrod spine, cold sweat and hands that wouldn’t stop shaking, the cold certainty that
Rita is standing on the other side, blinking owlishly at him from behind the thickest glasses he’s ever seen. Her corkscrew curls shoot off in a million directions, and she’s wearing fuzzy pajama trousers and slippers under a robe with unicorns chasing each other round and round on the hem.
Draco lets out a sharp breath, like he’s relieved too, and holds him tight. He feels like sunlight spearing through dark clouds, and he doesn’t seem to mind Harry digging his fingers into his back and clutching him pathetically, which is good because Harry doesn’t feel capable of much else at the moment. He just buries his face in Draco’s shoulder, breathing deep, and
All at once Harry is furious. He’s twisted up inside with the unfairness of it all, in a way that is really not befitting an Auror, because last night in bed they laughed for ages, almost deliriously happy, and now Draco is frowning at him and he’s got to go be a fucking snake for a month in fucking Guatemala.
in his head like the echo of something he’s supposed to remember, but the truth is that he’s never been a very good liar. Not with girls, at least. He can lie to Ron all day and into next week, but Hermione and Ginny have always been able to see right through him.
Draco looks like he hasn’t been sleeping. He’s dressed like he came straight from the Ministry, three-piece suit and a cravat and heavy winter robes cinched close around his waist, his cheeks dusted with pink and his nose bright red from cold, and Harry starts shaking as soon as he sees him.
, why is there anger stirring in his chest just hearing Ron say his name—why does he want to go into the loo and curl into a ball and pull Draco’s sweater up over his head and breathe in his scent and maybe cry a lot, why does telling his friends they’re
Potter, I’m going to have to tie you up!” Malfoy exploded, when he had to jump over the eighth jelly-legs jinx of the day. “You’re meant to defend yourself with your
, expecting some sympathy over the business with Nagini and her father or at least that horror fest they’d both been through with the Basilisk, but Ginny’d just said absently, “Oh, well, that sort of makes sense, doesn’t it?” and leaned down to pat him on the head, and then he’d been alone.
Somehow they’d retained the ability to push each other’s buttons like no other. Harry could rile Malfoy up from zero to one hundred in six seconds flat, and Malfoy knew exactly what to say to take Harry out at the knees, just like he had in school, even if he was more poised about it now, less obviously desperate to land a hit.
Harry scowled. He was doing a lot of scowling lately, and most of it was to cover up that somewhere in the last seven years his childhood hatred of Malfoy had turned into something alarmingly hungry. He did very much want to be tied up by Malfoy, actually, but he didn’t think it would be helpful to say so, unless it threw Malfoy off his game enough that Harry could—but no, probably not. Probably it would only make Malfoy look at him coldly some more, and say
Harry wanted to say, but it came out, “Mngrh.” Malfoy’s thigh was warm and very firm under his face. He wanted to nuzzle it.
Before he can figure it out, Draco slides his other hand up the back of his neck, into his hair to cradle his skull, pressing a kiss to his forehead. “Tell me what you want, turtle.”
It’s not so much a porch as a pavilion, large enough that Harry can imagine it hosting parties of a hundred people, three hundred. Clearly it hasn’t done anything like that in a while—the stone steps that lead down to the lawn are crumbling in disrepair, and fat little birds are splashing around in the still waters of an enormous fountain, tumbling over each other, chirping sweetly.
he holds on as Harry loses his fingernail-grip on existence, as he goes tumbling into the afterlife.
“You know,” Malfoy says, “we wouldn’t be in this mess if you’d just dealt with your trauma like a normal person.”
-greatest) to peruse his mind unimpeded. He finds himself wandering unintentionally into childhood—the Gryffindor boys’ dorm, curtains drawn on his four-poster bed,
They watch Ginny for a while in silence, as she runs out of pads and starts launching objects pilfered from passerby—a reporter’s camera, a toddler’s sippy cup (the pumpkin juice had been hell to get out of the carpet), an old man’s top hat. Harry remembers, distantly, how much the things she’s saying had hurt at the time, but now there’s only a dull ache. Draco’s presence at his back certainly helps.
A fleeting smile crosses Draco’s lips. “No,” he says. He meets Harry’s gaze and holds it. “I meant more in the marital sense.”
tirade again, but he catches himself before he can. “These are important, then,” he says. “What are they?”
They convene in the study, where Draco tips both vials into his Pensieve and then—with a look at Harry to check he doesn’t have any objections—draws them carefully into his own head. Harry watches him sway, eyes flickering behind closed eyelids, that odd serenity coming over his face for barely a minute before he’s blinking back awake.
Harry turns back to face her, wrestling down a swell of hatred. “No,” he says. “I’ve come to negotiate.”
Harry sits down, shuffling case files around so Hermione has room to pour three cups of tea. “I still don’t get it. So Rita Skeeter’s printing a lies about me, what else is new?”
Ginny ignores him. “Rita Skeeter’s writing a book about you, and it’s coming out in a week. She’s kept the whole thing very hush-hush, but she contacted one of the other Harpies for comment, and Stacie told Gwenog, and Gwenog told me, and I Floo’d my agent. Apparently it’s some sort of tell-all.”
, even if it’s only in his mind. Also she’ll probably never set foot in this place again, after the last time she was here, so he should stop thinking how peaceful it feels here now, and how it’s far too big for one person, and how he’d like to stay.
Draco’s eyes are red. He pulls Harry into a kiss, hands rough on the front of his shirt, then pushes him back almost immediately so he can look him in the eye. “You could’ve died,” he says.
he breathes, as cool air hits Harry’s skin, “oh, I should’ve given you a pair of my pants”—and then Harry finds himself face-first against the bookshelf, Draco kneeling behind him.
Malfoy’s still breathing hard. He raises his head, hums, drops a lazy kiss on Harry’s hip. “I always knew you could come on just my fingers,” he murmurs. “You’ve got that look about you.”
“That’s not what I said,” Harry tells Draco, as Ginny dumps her Quidditch kit bag on the cobblestones and starts shooting stinky kneepads through the open window of their flat with highly aggressive levitation charms. “I told her I wished she was home more, that was all.”
“No,” Harry says, feeling ill. “No, I didn’t know what it was. Did you think I did? And you let me—?”
Harry’s whole body is shaking. He’s so turned on just from Draco pressing against him that he thinks he’d probably come if he looked at him wrong,
“I’m looking,” Harry promises. His laugh fades to a smile, then melts away completely. Draco looks really serious. “What is it? Is something the matter?”
Harry had known, in an abstract sort of way, that Malfoy occasionally consulted for the DMLE. He remembers thinking
Malfoy raised a skeptical eyebrow, looking up over the rim of his glasses. “That’s not how Occlumency works, Potter.”
and handling him gently, maneuvering them beneath the covers so that Harry’s legs are around his waist, so that he can slide back inside, only half-hard but Harry so ruined still that there’s no resistance. Harry makes a strangled sound, clinging to him, and lets Draco gather him up, peppering kisses over his face, his hair, plastered front-to-front, so much skin that Harry’s heart is trying to beat out of his chest and into Draco’s.
s, the short cut-off sounds of people getting fucked, but the architecture seems to have taken on a shape that’s impossible, carpeted floors sloping up and down like steep hills, brilliant daylight shining through one of the curtains, the colors of the beads refracted and dancing on the far wall. They pass an honest-to-God centaur, hunching to keep from hitting his head on the ceiling, and what Harry thinks based on his admittedly limited experience must be a Veela, dressed mystifyingly in a lot of very tiny silver bells and nothing else.
as having been there when she lost her virginity—but anyway, Blaise was present for the deflowerings of half of London, so that hardly matters.”
Zabini’s nodding, with a look on his face that suggests that was a particularly tricky night and Malfoy’s a son of a bitch for bringing it up. “Right,” he says. “Bridget Baddock. We managed to track her down a week or so after the fact. Had a hell of a time reintegrating the memories, but we managed it.”
“I didn’t start this,” Harry laughs. He’s been laughing a lot in the last twelve hours, actually. The things that used to weigh on him just don’t seem so heavy with a lapful of Draco Malfoy.
So there he was, living through another moment he suspected he’d probably have to relegate to his wall safe, except Malfoy had lowered himself carefully to sit on the floor next to him, sweeping his coat out of the way, and he was lifting Harry’s head to rest on his thigh, and actually Harry might not want to forget this at all.
"Potter, no IFs! You hardly have much more than a minute or two to decide before you would be able to add a Murderer to the list of your titles. After which expulsion from Hogwarts would be the least of your worries. Does the word Azkaban ring a bell?" Harry nodded. "Is that a yes to giving your blood or merely you remembering what Azkaban is? You have to say it properly!"
"And what about this?" Harry rubbed with his foot Draco's ankle on which previously was a black bracelet, that dissolved with the end of his sentence three months ago.
"I guess the same thing you say to women? It would be useless to complement their tits, but I doubt that's the first thing you say to women, right?"
"My dignity doesn't allow me to wank to a measly blowjob when there is an actual fucking a press of a button away. I have standards."
"Thanks. But I would've seen him cumming even if they shown him doing it with HER in the frame for the whole time. ... Okay. They are done. May I switch to the good stuff?"
"I mean cheating." Harry looked at him aghast, to which Draco only smirked. "We become boyfriends, but you fuck however many women you want behind my back. It's going to be over if I find out. Naturally. But you still can try your luck."
He shut his eyes and shook his head, momentarily forgetting that it wouldn't help one bit. He didn't have to look around to know that Potter was somewhere in the vicinity. Draco was only half-way through his pie and he hated eating fast, but thinking that he had no choice he began to inhale the rest of it, barely chewing, and instead washing it down with tea. He had to get out of there before it had gotten worse!
I squeeze his bum with my left hand, forgetting that I wanted to keep myself from doing this, and start to bob my head more vigorously, wringing my right hand over the base of the shaft. I don't know whether he would like me to moan, but I sure would like to, and not just that, I have to consciously keep myself in check and not do it. Nothing over the top, just a few light moans or almost hums. But no. I can't show him how much I like blowing him. No! Sucking on a cock in general. The cock being his has nothing to do with this. Or anything at all. It's just an accident that he happened to have such nice cock. Most definitely.
Harry sat down on a small stool and was greeted with Draco's hard cock covered with foam. Draco as always, when he was put in such awkward and at the same time quite pleasurable situations, looked up. Trying to pretend nothing was happening.
"Again?!" Draco exclaimed and Harry nodded simply. "You're being ridiculous. There's a simple charm for this."
No matter what Draco had tried. No matter all the Occlumency specialists he had consulted. Nothing had ever helped. Multiple healers, who had found nothing, had asked him to bring Harry along to check everything more thoroughly and from other possible angles. Not that Draco had ever mentioned that it was Harry's thoughts that he had been tuning in on a regular basis. Or the precise and limited nature of those thoughts.
"Are there any other stupid questions you want to ask? ... You know I like hearing stuff. But I want to hear it from you sober."
"I'm sure you can... But this feels better, right?" Draco huffed. "Admit it. ... Not going to?" Draco kept pretending he didn't hear that. "Maybe then I should just stop?" Draco still gave no reaction. "Alright then." Harry pulled his hands away and waited for a few seconds for a reaction, but got none. Harry sighed and patted Draco's back. "Don't worry. I'll finish you off. But first things first. Turn."
Draco stared up at Harry with wide eyes. When Harry had tried to mention something about one condition, Draco from the excitement didn't even want to listen and agreed blindly. "There's no way I'm going to do it!"
Harry didn't pull back and let Draco finish in his mouth. After seeing him cum so many times, he was a bit curious as to its taste. Which turned out to be not too bad. He pulled back from the cock and swallowed.
I pull back a bit and concentrate my mouth on the cockhead, stroking his wet shaft with my hand. I know there are only seconds before he cums. His breathing also becomes erratic, as if his body forgets if it wants to breath in or out; but he still breathes through his nose and I'm sure it's to keep himself from making any other noises. I wouldn't mind him making some. On the contrary, I'd welcome it. But it isn't a surprise that somebody as uptight as him always tries to keep himself like that even during a blowjob; it's almost funny. I DEFINITELY wouldn't be like this.
"So that means that when you will have served your sentence and get your magic back, you'd give me one?"
Just as he was about to step through the main gilded doors he breathed out in relief as his head cleared from foreign thoughts. The last of which being of disappointment mixed with irritation, confirming that Harry saw him leave.
"Just because. I'd let you fuck me though," said Draco. Harry was taken aback. When Draco had said that he did not want to fuck him, Harry had thought it was the same thing like with the blowjobs at first. But they were way past that. After a drawn out silence between them Draco said, "You do fuck women though, so what's -"
"No," said Draco and put the bottle at the opposite end of the table. "And why do you need to drink to do it? Nobody's making you go down on me. If dicks disgust you, you shouldn't even try..."
"He doesn't need much more than a pint, but still, drink this," said Snape holding out an uncorked vial to Harry. Harry without a word took the blood-replenishing potion, wondering how many vials of it Snape had on himself, and dawned it in two gulps. "I strongly suggest that you refrain from telling anybody what curse you used. Not to your friends, nor even to Dumbledore, if he asks." Harry nodded unthinkingly, staring at Malfoy with anticipation, for some reason expecting that at any second Malfoy would sit up and say that he felt fine. "In case somebody asks say... Mmm... Say it was Sectumsempra."
"I just hope your Playwizard journals weren't discovered by muggles. You could've at least considered that muggles don't have something like that before throwing all of them into the garbage bin."
Harry sighed. But then felt that Draco's cock started to fill out once again. Harry grabbed the shaft with a soft grip and started to stroke it. "I've never given you two blowjobs in a row. You want me to do it again?"
With clean hands and dirty mind Draco stepped into the rightmost cubicle. He did not even remember when exactly he had stopped fighting himself and began to wank to Harry's fantasies completely guilt-free, replaying the ones that he liked most in his head, but it was a long while ago. In rare times it was not enough because never felt attracted to Harry the way he was to women, but it hardly mattered after having a fresh image from the ride in the lift. So there was no question as to what he would be imagining this time.
Harry pulled back a little. "Yep, you shouldn't... Although you're hardly doing anything besides being busy just standing."
"My blood?!" asked Harry, alarmed by the strange request, knowing that blood of witches or wizards was known to be used only in the darkest of rituals, and that blood transfusions were decidedly not a thing in the wizarding world due to the blood-replenishing potion. More so because the potion that Snape poured into Malfoy's mouth had quite a distinct odor, which Harry was able to smell and identify as such. His eyes momentarily darted left to Malfoy's body, whose clothes were soaked with blood, and more of it, though not as fast as before, was still visibly seeping out through numerous lacerations. Then he looked back at Snape, who had his wand out and was conjuring something midair.
A wall of water slams down from the ceiling, drenching him and turning the entire flat into a waste of soggy black char. “Fuck,” he says again, this time pushing wet hair out of his face, extraordinarily unhappy.
Much later, after they’ve made their way down to eat in the dining room (“The Coralina dinner service gets grumpy if I don’t use it every once in a while,” Draco says), after they’ve ascended lazy and full back up to bed, after Draco’s manhandled Harry down to lie on his chest and spent hours kissing every bit of him he could reach, chatting idly about the rest of the contents of
“Harry.” Draco nudges him so all four chair legs are back on the ground and crouches next to him. “Look at me.”
“Any luck?” Harry asks. He did end up sending Ron a note eventually, once he'd gathered up all the vials. He hasn't got high hopes that the Aurors' office can turn anything up, but he figures it's worth a try.
Draco kisses him once, lazily, and murmurs, “I thought it was very Shakespearean of me, at the time. Suffering gallantly through puberty whilst tortured by rapturous visions of my arch nemesis.”
pace around the Room of Requirement—later, asleep, the Marauder’s Map folded beneath his pillow, imagining he can still hear the deliberate tap-tap-tap of snakeskin wingtips—peering through the sea of bent heads in the Great Hall in the morning, looking for platinum blond hair at the Slytherin table, Hermione following his gaze and slumping with a sigh,
“I don’t hate it,” he says, but the words sound weak and false even to his own ears. “It’s just…some assignments…”
Draco’s breath catches again. “I know what you need, Harry,” he says. “Don’t worry, I know exactly what you need…”
He ends up sitting mostly-naked on the front staircase as the coffee tray floats breakfast accommodatingly to him from the east sitting room, flipping through it. The idea of actually
He shoves Harry’s robes off his shoulders and onto the floor, so they’re standing in a pool of fabric. His fingers open Harry’s belt and his fly deftly, with barely any pressure—“
Malfoy sighed. “When you can walk again, we’re going down to the Apparation point, and we’re going to the Manor. I’ve got a poultice that will cool you down enough to actually focus on your session.”
“Here,” Harry says decisively. When he makes up his mind to do something he finds it’s better to do it straight away, so he doesn’t have time to psych himself out about it. “Here’s fine.”
He spends the earliest hours of the morning alone with the Manor, his robes from yesterday pulled tight around him to keep out the chill. Separated from the grimy horrors of the war, it’s the sort of place he might’ve imagined when he was a kid and his history teacher started talking about
“She hasn’t worked here in a long time,” the man reminds Harry nervously, as he scrawls out the address on a scrap of parchment, dabs it with blotting paper, and hands it over. “Not since that business with the Triwizard. She was lucky she didn’t end up in Azkaban, being an unregistered Animagus, but they told her she could never work in journalism again. Revoked her press credentials.”
“You said your flat burned down,” Malfoy says. His voice sounds rough, probably from the firewhiskey. “You can stay here, then. There are eighteen guest bedrooms; you’re welcome to any of them.”
He stares at it for a long minute before he does anything about it, feeling rather like he’s come in and found a bomb. The photo on the cover isn’t one he’s ever seen before, but he thinks it’s from one of the funerals after the war—Remus and Tonks’, probably, or Fred’s. His eyes are red; he’s lifting his eyes to glare at the camera on endless loop, and the overall effect is standoffish, menacing. He looks scary.
They’ve been talking for a while, in between rounds of vigorous fucking, and now Harry hums in answer. “Yeah. I used to wonder if he could see my dreams, as well. I thought that would be pretty funny—Voldemort having nightmares about showing up naked to his OWLs.”
Draco reaches out and touches his face. “Of course that first night, you dollop,” he says. “I’ve wanted you for as long as I’ve known what wanting someone meant.”
there, since Malfoy’d probably put him out on his arse and he doesn’t have a good reason to go anyways. Somehow, though, he pulls himself back to his feet, through the bathroom door, and the next thing he’s aware of he’s standing in the Manor’s foyer.
Ron crouched by his head for a few seconds, then laughed when he heard it was only a Stinging Hex—“Meant for Malfoy, I’d imagine?” he asked, turning to the Auror who’d cast it, “Bad aim, Choudhury, you need to visit the firing range”—and moved on. Choudhury, Harry later found out, was given a stern talking-to and one day’s suspension, and was back on Tuesday without so much as a sheepish expression.
“Good morning, Harry,” says Hermione, with a flustered smile, at the same time Ron blurts, “‘Mione’s pregnant.”
“You could’ve talked to your friends,” Malfoy suggests, going around the mind map and starting to prod it into shape with his wand. “You know,
Never in his life has Harry come three times in one night—not even when Ginny convinced him to go to that thing with all the Holyhead Harpies—and by the time Malfoy gets him there again, what feels like several sweaty hours later (Harry sobbing and exhausted like he’s running a marathon and Malfoy murmuring like a devil as his fingers rub inside him, “Look at you, Harry, so needy”—shifting on the bed, coming up on his elbows for leverage—“I’ll give you what you need,” with a surprising, tender kiss to Harry’s knee, “I’ll give you what you need, turtle”) all Harry can manage is an explosive shout and a few sad dribbles of come.
They cross through a room full of velvet futons and people doing ridiculous things like eating grapes from each other’s fingers, Amortentia’s lustier cousin
His cock finds that spot that makes Harry’s vision light up like fireworks, and Harry nearly swallows his own tongue with how fast he comes.
Draco stands with him as he passes through the Forbidden Forest, going to meet his death. His grip on Harry’s hand tightens to the point of pain as Voldemort turns in that clearing, as he says,
All at once, Harry is back in the training room, Malfoy leaning hard against the desk in front of him, wand hand falling to his side. “You didn’t know,” Malfoy says, shocked. “You really didn’t know what it was.
Malfoy stares at him for another minute. If Harry hadn’t spent the last few weeks—the last decade of his life, if he’s being honest—obsessing over his face, he wouldn’t be able to tell that he’s conflicted. His expression is a perfect mask. But Harry knows him, so he can tell.
, the first one is called, and seems to be about Fred. That’s alright—Rita could’ve got information about Fred from loads of places.
, and miracle of miracles, only one of them is cracked. It’s still three less than he’s meant to have, though, which means that whoever broke in also made off with three of his memories. He wishes, in hindsight, that he’d marked them. At least then he’d know what he was missing.
Draco’s breath catches. “Alright.” His hand soothes back through Harry’s hair, petting him. “Alright, darling, I’ve got you.”
. He takes huge, greedy handfuls of his poncy velvet robes, tugging him close. “I just want you, Draco, please.”

They tumble into a dim, deserted room—one with a door instead of a curtain, a door that Draco pulls closed behind them, pointing his wand at the lock with a quick

unfolding itself neatly in the air in front of him, and as the bird flutters over to him he says absently, without looking up from his reading, “Thank you, you may go.”
Harry staggers into the bathroom and vomits up the cheesy pasta Kreacher made him, then vomits up the curry he had for lunch and the frozen waffle he zapped with a heating charm this morning.
Still, he supposes he can live with it. Ginny warned him, after all, and she’s probably right about letting it blow over.
He sends a quick note through the Floo to Ron to let him know someone’s set his flat on fire so he probably won’t be in for the rest of the day, then sets about the tricky business of figuring out who could’ve fucked his wards so badly they decided to set his things on fire instead of function properly. Harry’s never been good at this intricate sort of magic—it’s more Hermione’s thing, or Malfoy’s—but halfway through his perusal of the damage he realizes that most of the wall in his bedroom has sloughed away to the floor, and that his supposedly goblin-rated wall safe is standing open and empty, so he can’t exactly call them.
“I used to go to Hogwarts just to talk to the ghosts,” Harry confesses, while they wait in that strange in-between Platform Nine and Three Quarters. “About dying, you know. But none of them had ever been here.”
Kreacher, because he wishes he could murder Harry but is prevented by the magic of the house, cooks him a bowl of very watery cheese pasta and levitates it ominously up to Harry’s room like a strange ghost. Harry’s not really bothered—he’s too hungry to care much what he’s eating and he’s seen much worse than a ghostly pasta bowl—so he wolfs it down in about thirty seconds while he’s rummaging around in his enlarged robe pockets looking for his Pensieve. It takes him a while to find it, and once he does it takes him a while to maneuver it out, knocking down what sounds like a stack of china as he does, until the big ugly bowl is sitting on the desk in front of him.
Malfoy circles the sphere, inspecting it. “This is a mind map,” he says. “Think of your missing memories like dark spots on a Muggle road map. In order to fill them in properly, I’ve got to figure out what roads connect through where, so to say, and what route they prefer to take—it’s very delicate magic.”
It’s the stress leaving his body, he realizes. Stress he hasn’t felt safe enough to let go, rushing out of him all at once.
Harry shakes his head. “I’ve got to report in,” he says, pushing his chair back to stand. “And I need real clothes, and I’ve got to figure out how to get a new Portkey passport since mine went up in flames, and I’ve got to learn Spanish—”
“My agent thinks we should let it blow over,” Ginny says. “Let it be news for a week or so, before people find something else to gape at.”
know. Malfoy’d testified, at the Wizengamot, that he’d been tortured while Voldemort was living at his house, that he’d resisted the Imperius curse and mind control, that he’d suffered days of

bigger, of how huge it would feel spearing him open. He has to breathe open-mouthed through the intrusion, like he’s running a marathon, and by the time Draco makes it fully into him, his hip bones flush with Harry’s ass, Harry can hardly get enough air. It feels like all the blood in his body is either in his cock or in his face, and he turns to hide his blush in his upper arm, in Draco’s sweater.
and how nice it was to be understood without words and whether it’s possible to care for someone and not really want to go to all the actual trouble of caring for them at the same time.
Goosebumps break out on his skin as Draco stares at him. He unclasps his robes and lets them fall to the floor, then toes out of his shoes and knees up onto the bed with Harry, both shuffling back awkwardly until Harry’s propped up against the pillows with Draco straddling him.
“Why didn’t you come to the Manor?” Draco says against his ear, soft enough that only Harry can hear.
Harry wants to brace against the bookshelf and fuck himself back on Draco’s cock, but whatever strain of Futortentia he inhaled is making him feel weak and lazy and insatiable, so he just hangs his head—at least until Draco gets a hand around his throat, palm flat and warm, pulling his head back up.
“Thank you,” Draco says flatly, but his eyes are dancing in a way Harry’s never seen. He’s in his element, with this. He’s one of only a few people in the world who could possibly solve this problem, and he knows it. He’s energized by his own genius, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and Harry wants very badly to shove him back against the desk and fall to his knees. “
Kreacher appears, pointy and hunched over in the shadows at the end of the hall. His eyes shine hatefully in the dark. “Yes, master,” he says. “Master will be wanting to rummage through the attics again, such a mess…”
The sun is low in the sky, a rare orange sunset in the city of London. Harry takes a detour through Diagon Alley to stop at Gringotts on the way back to the Manor, and leaves his vault with a small velvet bag added to the day’s haul.
Rita blinks at him for a moment, then grins ruefully and shakes her head. “No, not a chance. Scandal
Granted, he’s not in the building at the time, but what wakes him—slumped over at his desk in the DMLE—is his wand glowing red-hot in his pocket, alerting him to the fact that someone’s been mucking about in his wards. He races down to the lobby half-awake and Apparates with a crack into the middle of his flat, which is burning.
Around dinner time he gives up on the wards—whoever it was covered their tracks very well, he can’t find a trace of them. His Hogwarts trunk is burnt to a crisp, but he enlarges the pockets of his robes with one of Hermione’s charms (the Tardis charm, she calls it, which Harry knows has something to do with
Harry-in-the-present feels all the blood rush to his face, heady with voyeuristic arousal as Harry-in-the-past comes with a noise like the opposite of a shout, all the sound rushing back into his body. A moment later, Draco-in-the-past drops a kiss on his Harry’s hip, humming, and murmurs, “I always knew you could come on just my fingers. You’ve got that look about you.”
, pulling his pince-nez down onto the chain. “You know,” he says, casual in a way that Harry can hear is fake, “the only other person with access to the Manor’s wards is my mother. Me, my mother…and you.”
Kingsley, who had never been at Hogwarts with Harry and thus was not aware of the epic heights to which his rivalry with Malfoy had soared, looked unimpressed. “Your ‘training’ was nearly a decade ago," he said. "And it was hardly comprehensive. You’re going to sit down with Malfoy, and you’re not going back in the field until he gives you a rubber stamp. Besides, hating your teacher should be good incentive to keep him out of your head.”
Manor?” Ron explodes, loud enough that Hannah Abbot spills tea all over her desk halfway across the room. “Are you mental? Have you been Imperiused? Is he blackmailing you?”
“Oh, God,” Harry says, sort of panicked all of a sudden—how can this be happening, how can he be actually getting this, how can anyone, especially this man, be willing to give it to him—but Draco presses a kiss to his forehead again and says, “Shh, turtle, I’ve got you. It’s alright. I’m not going anywhere, I promise.”
Harry sits, watching as Malfoy tinkers around with a strange wooden sphere. The surface is thousands of tiny scales, less than a millimeter, and when Malfoy murmurs to it they extend, so Harry can see they’re actually thousands of thin wooden pins, all sticking out of a central, glowing orb of magic.
He was also unreasonably gorgeous, like a drawing of a fairy in a children’s storybook, and he dressed like he’d stepped neatly out of the eighteenth century, pocket watch and pince-nez and collars that buttoned up to his chin, and sometimes Harry caught himself staring at him—not at any piece of him in particular, just the proud, strong lines of the whole, the capable way he held himself, speaking with an Auror on their way out of a session or marching down to the holding cells for an interrogation or standing with his back to Harry in the training room, pulling thought after filament silvery thought from his head and letting them fall gently to the Pensieve.
, he doesn’t say, but it looks like Malfoy hears it anyways. He drains the rest of his firewhiskey in one swallow and sends the glass dancing back over to the drinks cart, cloth rising to clean it as it approaches.
Harry shrugs. “I dunno. The last one maybe six months ago?” He neglects to mention the memory he remembers removing two nights previously. Until he finds out if it’s one of the vials here, or one of the vials that’s been stolen, he doesn’t see any reason to raise the issue.
“I know you Gryffindors love to rush out and get yourselves killed, Potter,” Malfoy informed him, sweeping through the halls of the Ministry in a very elegent aubergine coat, “but I’ve been hired to do a job, and I’m not going to do it badly just because you’re a champion whinger.”
he missed their Occlumency session today, but actually that’s a pretty good question for a whole other reason, because: “Did you add me to your wards?”
“So,” Malfoy says, circling around the bureau to pick up the glass of firewhiskey he’d evidently set down to go meet Harry, “what have you gotten yourself into this time, Potter?”
(“The Wizengamot’s punted on the Heritage Land Use Act again, if you can believe it, stodgy old Hawkworth—you could probably get a seat if you wanted, wasn’t your great-great-grandfather or something a member?”) and leads him up a winding staircase through the interior of the house to the master bedroom.
“It’s a sex thing,” Ginny says at last, caving. “I—told—Rebecca—some stuff about our relationship, that she could blab.”
, his fingers bruising on Malfoy’s flanks and his mouth open against Malfoy’s throat while the other man gasps and shudders and comes all over his stomach.
He thought maybe he would’ve gotten out of those, having been cleared for field work and all, but he can’t say he’s too put out to have to keep going. After all, the moment he’s inside the room, Draco steers him into his chair and helps himself to a seat on his lap.
But Harry couldn’t figure any reason Kingsley wouldn’t let him out of it unless he’d had a mental break, so he marched into Kingsley’s office to tell him as much.
The t-shirt and pajama trousers he’s wearing are brand new. They haven’t even been washed yet, because all his clothes burned to a crisp and they banished the ones he wore to Guatemala—Draco’s clothes—at St. Mungo’s. He’s sleeping on his married friends’ couch because he hasn’t got a bed. He can hear them puttering about in the other room, carrying out all the little domestic rituals to get ready for bed, talking about him, maybe, or about the baby. In here he feels very alone.
Malfoy makes a soft sound of disagreement. “Not exactly. It’s an imperfect metaphor.” He makes one last circuit of the mind map, then turns to Harry, taking out his wand. “Right. Don’t try to fight me this time—just let me in. I need to take a look around and see what I’m dealing with.”
It’s not an unfamiliar feeling, but right now it’s spilled over every other thought in his brain, and it’s—heavy. He wants to crawl into bed and sleep it off, but he doesn’t want to do it in the wrong bed, and all the beds in this house are nothing but wrong. Above all he wants to go home, but his flat is a pile of charcoal and for some bloody reason the only other place he wants, the only place he feels a pull towards, is Malfoy Manor.
Harry shakes his head, not quite awake enough to joke. He unties the drawstring on the bag and tips two copper bands out onto his palm. One is small, thin. The other is thicker, a man’s ring. They’ll probably have to transfigure them. He hopes Draco doesn’t mind.
He remembers that night, the first Christmas after Ginny dumped him, how he’d only managed to go round to the Burrow for about fifteen minutes before fleeing. It’d felt like the guilt was eating him alive, the same feeling he’d had that awful, sleepless night after Arthur Weasley was attacked by Nagini, when he’d been sure they’d blame him and had spent long hours sitting up with the Weasley children and Sirius in the kitchen at Grimmauld Place, skin prickling with the sensation that he was an intruder, that he was unwelcome in this moment of private family grief. For all the kindness they’ve shown him over the years, he’d never
"Do you see me laughing? There's your answer... We're having a pretty good time with just oral and handjobs anyway. Why spoil it?"
Only after the bill had been passed Hermione in the Daily Prophet read that the lawmakers completely misunderstood her initiative and what Restorative Justice meant, twisting it into something that barely had anything from her initial proposal. After stripping all the legal gobbledegook it came down to just being an extension of parole with some caveats that had several things from what she wanted.
As I stand up, I try to seem oblivious to my own hard cock that is clearly straining my pants. Nonchalantly I start to unfold the cuffs of my shirt that I always roll up before a blowjob.
Leaving the mess behind for the inbuilt cleaning charms to take care of it, Draco got out and stepped to a sink. He meticulously washed his hands, looking at himself in the mirror. His cheeks were still a bit pink, but gradually were reverting back to their unassuming pale color. With him being alone he allowed himself to smile widely at his reflection, feeling content as the happy chemicals once again took dominion over his brain. That small outburst of frustration followed by doubt as if had not happened a minute prior; drastic mood swings were not uncommon for him when he felt overwhelmed with emotions.
In the lift Harry was just fantasizing. It was nice, but it paled in comparison with the current thing. Draco just stood there, not touching himself, feeling powerful, almost burning sensations coming from Harry in waves accompanied by no less stimulating visuals. As if he was plunged into a special Pensive that, unlike normal ones, was able to transmit everything that a memory-creator felt. At moments he felt like he was about to have an orgasm just from that alone. On rare but lucky occasions he was able to cum just like that; for that Harry had not just to fantasize, but to wank. And catching Harry wanking was something that, to Draco's chagrin, did not happen as often as he would've liked. He absolutely loved to be able to just ride along.
Soon Draco saw his-fantasy-self break the kiss and keep planting kisses all over while slowly going downwards, until he ended up on his knees with Harry's cock in his mouth. Draco shuddered, thinking how he was ready to do just that in the real world that very second; Harry's cock looked so darn delicious. All Harry had to do for that was to knock on his door and ask for a permission to enter. Draco never in his life touched another man's cock. But in Harry's fantasies he saw himself do it constantly and it almost came like second nature to him.
"And? If you think that such an argument might sway me in any way, you're more drunk than I thought."
"Surely madam Pomfrey has more of blood-replenishing potion," said Harry, but it sounded hollow even to his own ears.
So Potter was waiting for me! he thought as he stopped. He slowly turned and looked at Harry with his most impassive, bordering on bored, expression. Internally he was panicking. They as good as never talked about anything that was not work-related. But the report was due May, meaning that he still had plenty of time, and Harry never bothered him with overbearing supervision. What else Potter might want from me?!
Draco has never done anything like this with anybody. Several weeks ago he and Harry have seen almost the exact same thing. That time to Draco the man seemed so much in control, the woman basically did nothing but lay there and let him do what he wanted. Draco shook his head, realizing that for the past half a minute his eyes were glued to Harry stroking his cock, as he waited for the answer.
Then, when they were past the minus sixth level, to not much of a surprise, it turned into fucking. No preamble. With Draco once again being clad in the outfit from the cafeteria.
"No! Tomorrow might be late! Come on!" said Draco bursting with excitement and yanked the blanket off Harry. "This is something else! I'm telling you!"
After inhaling deeply Draco held his breath, knowing that this would prevent his already waking up dick from hardening further, musing where to go to spend the rest of his lunch break.
Ever since Harry introduced Draco to the concept of television, which was three weeks ago, Draco has been spending a lot of time before the screen. Which was understandable, considering that he wasn't allowed to leave Harry's flat and had to sleep on the couch right before the TV-set. With Draco generally going to bed later than him, Harry even bought him headphones, so Draco wouldn't bother his sleep.
"No. ... I can rub your shoulders if you want." Draco barely contained himself, completely baffled by his own utterance.
Jane pulled her mouth off Harry's cock without stopping to stroke it. "Honey, Harry is totally bi, but you seem to be fully gay."
"Wow..." let out Draco as Harry pressed the Next button on the remote repeatedly, going up the list of channels. "I can choose different things?" Harry nodded. "I can't believe muggles have such magic!"
"Just being honest, I guess... I'm in Hermione's program and I am actively trying to become a better person, right? At least officially. So it all might be an act to make you let your guard down. Who knows? Definitely me. But there's no possible way you would ever know for sure."
I keep slowly sucking him off. Nothing fancy. He doesn't deserve anything fancy. Just letting my lips slide back and forth over the glans as I work the shaft with my hand. If he doesn't appreciate my attempts at deep-throating to at least say something, then he won't get more of it. At least today. I hold this monotonous tempo for close to a minute. But then I can't go on like that. Too mechanical. So what if he likes if I apply myself? Since when I started to care what he thinks?! His opinion means nothing to me!
Draco came back to the Ministry ten minutes past his lunch-break, figuring being a bit late would help him avoid running into Harry, who seemed to be particularly horny today.
Harry sighed. "I don't have time to explain now. Just don't touch anything that seems too muggle. Stove in particular."
For the past seven months Malfoy led the most normal law-abiding life. The most normal muggle life that is. Because he, just like others who were involved with Voldemort and were known to espouse pureblood views, had to go through muggle assimilation before they would be allowed all their freedoms back. Since his release Draco worked at muggle restaurant and every week went to the Ministry, where Hermione led a weekly meeting with other RJ subjects like him.
"You really want to wank to this?" asked Draco with an unconcealed derision in his tone. Harry nodded unperturbed. "But it's just a blowjob!"
I pull his shirt over his shoulders and leave it like that. If he wants, he's free to take it off himself. The button-loving bastard.
When Harry spoke with him in his fantasies he was so tender, so caring. Especially when they weren't engaging in anything strictly sexual. Even women weren't as gentle with him as Harry was in his imagination. Harry caressed and patted him, he showered him with compliments and his undivided attention. Draco felt wanted for just being himself and desired like with nobody else. Over the years some witches also had said that they liked or even loved him, that they wanted him and his body. But Draco always thought that those were just words, and that words not just could be faked, but were faked most of the time. There was no fakery or deception in Potter's thoughts. There was nobody to deceive, after all; Draco had done several experiments proving that Harry was not aware about his fantasies being available for Draco to tune in on. That was why he feared that one day he would experience it for the last time and that would be it. That he would lose the ability in the same inexpiable way he got it. Without leaving him any physical proof that it actually happened.
Draco skidded back and lay inbetween Jane's legs. He started lapping her up quite eagerly, as if trying to prove something.
God, why is his cock looks so damn gorgeous?! I'm glad that it is, but... Maybe it's because I haven't had it in my mouth for a while now. No! I have to wait and stroke it for a bit longer. But should I really? What if he's pent up and cums too quickly? No, he never does. Stroke it for another minute. Just a minute. Thirty seconds. Yes. Just like that. ... Are the thirty seconds gone yet? No? Yes! They definitely are! Fuck it!
"Ehm... Stop playing with your balls and concentrate on your cock, or stop altogether?" Draco huffed and looked up at the ceiling. "I guess I did spend too much time with your two little bells."
More buttons... I fight the urge to just grab the sides of the shirt and rip it apart with all of these damn buttons. But no. I tried it once. That time his buttons were magically bound to the fabric, so I'd just embarrass myself if I try again. I start to undo them hastily. From bottom to the top.
"No-no-no. It's not going to cut it. You weren't against it for the first time. For the second blowjob you'd have to ask for it."
Draco would've rolled his eyes at that small exchange if not for Harry's emotions accompanying it. Harry as always went all in on his role. Draco sensed that faux-Harry wanted to be benevolent to faux-Draco, that he wanted to acquiesce and let faux-Draco finish however he wanted, but he also felt that he had to be firm and insist on dolling out his nominal punishment. Sex in itself, after all, was not always the main thing in Harry's fantasies even during wanking. Sometimes it was just a small part in a much bigger nebulous scheme that tended to evolve on the go.
"Is this the time when you rehash the same arguments? Or came up with some new ones? I'm all ears..."
Draco knew, because he sensed it in Harry's thoughts pertaining to him, that there was no ridicule in that, but it still was quite unnerving to see flashes of himself in all kinds of suggestive posses and inappropriate outfits for the Ministry setting. At times Draco was barely able to distinguish reality from Harry's fantasies. While his conscious mind was able to understand that those visions weren't reality, his body didn't see the difference. So when Harry in the middle of a serious discussion would start imagining something like matter-of-factly unbuckling Draco's pants, pulling out his cock, and starting to give him a handjob in the exact same circumstances they were in, Draco's body reacted. And getting erections in the middle of an open office with loads of people roaming around, even with a concealment charm hiding his arousal, was not his cup of tea.
Harry slowly stroked his cock and noticed that Draco was not moving - his arms still folded over his chest, but his cock was no less hard. Harry chuckled. "Not going to wank out of spite?"
"Ouch! Be more careful!" said Harry theatrically as the sponge grazed his crotch. "Or should I better say to be more gentle?"
"Really? Hm... Well, that still doesn't mean that you had a good blowjob. Want me to show you what a good one is?"
Harry shuffled behind Draco, squinting at the corridor lights. As he stepped into the living room, he saw Draco with both hands, one of which held the remote, pointing at the TV in agitation. Draco then switched the sound from the headphones to the main speakers and immediately an obnoxiously fake moaning filled the room.
"Not like this. Look!" - Draco pointed at the TV - "His cock literally takes up half of the screen."
Harry grinned. "Porn as means to fight bigotry. Nice..." Draco chuckled as well. "I bet your horny teens would've been livelier."
He was about done licking his hand clean as he heard the door to the adjacent cubicle open, reminding him where he was and bringing him back into reality. He as usual planned to wait until Harry would be gone.
"Nah... He tells like he means. It's just nerves. He hasn't seen another human besides me in a year. Can't leave the house and all."
When the fantasies were visual, Draco either had to watch everything from Harry's point of view, or saw both of them together as if they were on a stage and he and Harry, of course, were the only spectators. Actors and spectators at the same time. With Harry also being the director of those raunchy plays.
The rest was cut off with a distinct whoosh-sound of Muffliato charm. And a second later, with Harry's attention taken, his stream of thoughts stopped being available to Draco as well. Draco did not expect to be able to hear Harry's thoughts much longer anyway - the distance between the offices, where Harry no doubt headed, and the lounge was enough to break the connection.
"You do remember that several months in I did say that you may bring women as long as they are muggles, right? So you may bring him here."
"Yes, Potter, your blood," said Snape with his usual derision, not sparing him a glance and instead looking at the darkening cloudy mass that his wand was producing. "YOU cast the curse, so I need YOUR blood to -"
"Take whatever you want from the kitchen," said Harry motioning to the small kitchen. He gestured to the living room. "TV, couch... Bathroom is there." Harry pointed to the left. "I don't have a lot of space as you see, but I think we'll manage. Anyway, I'm off to work. Hope my place is going to be still there when I return."
"S-E-C-T-U-M-S-E-M-P-R-A," said Snape slowly. "Outwardly it would look virtually indistinguishable to the one you used. And don't think of using it on anybody either! Unless you want to kill them off, of course."
"Assuming that Harry did it on his own." Hermione groaned with frustration. "Even putting bewitchment aside. Malfoy might be just playing Harry. No potions or charms. Nothing like that. Just straight up manipulation."
I've no idea where he likes to cum. And I don't care. He has no other choice but to finish in my mouth. As always. This is part of the deal. Even though we haven't discussed the terms. I came for this and I'm going to get it. There isn't going to be a warning. There's never one. And I don't need it. I know when he gets close maybe even before he does.
"Don't call me that!" Harry only smiled. "Get off me," said Draco pushing Harry to the side. Harry complied and Draco turned on his side with his back to Harry.
Draco's face got even redder as he with shame was staring at his semi-hard cock and he mumbled, "I'm not even bi!"
What Draco never could understand was why faux-Harry never let faux-Draco fuck him. Harry had pertaining fantasies about it, which were not exactly about fucking, but more about faux-Harry trying to persuade faux-Draco to fuck him, and faux-Draco refusing each time. Giving some ridiculous and evasive reasons or without any at all. Acting all capricious about it. Draco knew that Harry wanted to be fucked - he felt it. But it turned Harry more to watch faux-Draco refuse, turn around, presenting faux-Harry his bum, and ask faux-Harry to do him instead. As if imagining them temporarily switching roles would disrupt the established order of things after which there would be no going back. Not that Draco was miffed about it - those were Harry's fantasies, so he had every right to imagine whatever he pleased. But when Draco wanked on his own while thinking about Harry, he was not as strict about it and sometimes fantasied about reversing their roles. Especially he liked imagining fucking Harry while wearing at least something from his special wardrobe, which always made him giddy from the naughtiness of it.
Draco blushed looking down at Harry, who had his cock lying across the face as he sucked in both of his balls into his mouth. Maintaining suction Harry pulled back a tiny bit, then sucked the balls back deeper into his mouth. He repeated that again and again.
I slowly slide my lips off the cock, my eyes are closed, and make a gulp. It's nasty. It's disgusting. And I love it beyond measure. But my body seems to be of the other opinion. But no matter. I manage to suppress its urge as I make another few swallows of mostly saliva.
"That's not my problem. I'm not cuddling with you, and more so not sleeping in one bed with you when you just want to get an occasional blowjob from me. Or give one."
After hearing that Snape once again kneeled beside Malfoy, put a hand onto his chest and began saying something incomprehensible.
"I told you about it," said Harry. "That kind of special closeness when I was in somebody. That is what I miss." Draco raised an eyebrow. "Not that we're not close! I just... Ehm..."
"Sorry," mumbled Draco flustered as he got off a curvy brunette and sat on his haunches between her legs. "I... Ehm... It's just I've never been in a threesome before."
As Harry left that morning with the TV on, he completely forgot to mention the remote and Draco has been watching a news channel all day, which still captivated him.
He pushed that train of thought aside and tried to concentrate on the thing that would make him cum and kept on wanking, imagining how nice it would feel to have Harry's cock up his bum and visualizing it. The imaginary Draco always enjoyed it so much...
Draco tried to quell his misplaced vexation at somebody using the bathroom at the same time as him. He hated how he still felt entitled about such petty things and had been actively trying to better himself, with not much success though.
"Wanking with Potter is always so much better, isn't it?" he muttered almost inaudibly and wiggled his eyebrows at his smiling reflection, as if speaking to it. Mainly because he did not have anybody else who he was able to tell it to. "If only you were able to go straight home and have a good nap instead of doing that damn report... This red tape is going to be the end of you some day!"
Draco felt his whole body becoming uncomfortably stiff as he understood the implications. Now he was not only not sure what exactly he said after the wank, but whether he said anything in the process of it that might have been even more incriminating and what other unbecoming sounds he might have unintentionally made. Second after second ticked by, underscored by his steadily increasing heartbeat thumping in his ears, as Draco did not dare to tear his eyes away from the sign and look at Harry. His mind feverishly worked on possible explanations with desperate hope that in the cubicle Harry had cast the conventional silencing charm that cut off sound in both directions and heard nothing before he came out.
Draco huffed and gestured to the clock that showed five minutes before midnight, though Harry did not raise his eyes to see that. "I am on time!"
"I bet you simply haven't gotten a good blowjob... That's where the problem lies." Draco huffed. "With you sequestered away for years you must have -"
The thoughts about work rekindled a deep-seated germ of resentment towards Harry that lately seemed to show its ugly head more and more often. Draco hated himself for feeling that way, about Harry no less, but he could not help himself. Harry was the sole reason Draco still kept toiling away in the Ministry. Last February Draco rejected a private offer to a much more interesting position with a significant reduction in drudgery of pointless paperwork. Not to mention a different salary. Though monetary aspect was the least important to him. Harry's fantasies on the other hand... They were like a drug to him. A drug which he was not able to stop using.
Draco had no doubt that Harry had some experience with men because it felt so real. He did not care how exactly Harry got the experience - whether it was in the past, or Harry was cheating, or he and Ginny had some sort of an arraignment. It was irrelevant. What mattered was that Harry had given blowjobs. For Draco even the idea of Harry sucking somebody off who was not him for some reason was a thrill. Maybe because it differed from Harry's fantasies, in which even when they were not alone, Harry engaged sexually only with him. So Draco liked to wank imagining Harry blowing some bloke in a dark alley, especially with that imaginary Harry thinking that that bloke was a substitute for the real Draco.
"Tomorrow..." muttered Harry and turned away. Unlike Draco, Harry had to wake up early in the morning.
"Ah, yes. You do like to be a bad boy. I forgot." Draco hit Harry lightly. "Fed your boyfriend some cum even if he wasn't even there..."
"Big surprise. You never know. That's why you have to actually say that you want me to blow you again."
"Had sex with my mouth..." Harry continued while slowly stroking his own cock and playing with Draco's balls.
The lift did not even switch from horizontal to vertical movement as Draco felt an inexplicable rush of excitement. It took him just a second to realize that among at least a dozen people was also Harry. Who, apparently, did see Draco come in. Seconds later the visual part came and Draco watched stepping behind himself in the free of other people lift, reaching around with Harry's hands and starting to undo his own pants. Draco cursed his luck.
Enough! I don't own this bathroom! Other people are allowed to use it any time they want! he scolded himself in his thoughts. Nobody knows that I'm wanking, so stop fretting! Even if they knew, there's nothing wrong with getting off like this! Besides, nobody's going to find out what I'm thinking about while I'm at it!
"Thanks, Malfoy," I mirror back. I know that me thanking him might make me seem needy, but I just can't not say it back after he thanks me. And I hope that it helps him to understand that I do it for myself, thus the thanking. He gave me a favor! Not the other way around.
Aberforth Dumbledore, being the last close relative of Albus Dumbledore, had been the first choice of the program for Malfoy. It was nobody's surprise that Aberforth did not even came to the meeting, lest gave any indication that he wanted to be involved in Malfoy's release on parole in any capacity.
And there it is - a poorly stifled dry groan from above is followed by a surge of cum hitting back of my mouth. Several more spurts follow. He cums a lot in comparison to others and, Merlin, how I love it. I want to ask if he drinks enough, because of how thick and sticky his cum as always is. But it's not my place to ask such questions.
Finally I think it's time for the main course. I tug the foreskin back, revealing the pale pink glans. They look glossy from the precum and so smooth that I almost can see my distorted reflection in them. Merlin, his cock looks fine... Thank god, Malfoy accidentally learned by dirty little secret. Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten a chance to do this.
I keep going until only one button left, which I decide to ignore. I pull his pants down. Slowly. There's no reason to be hasty. No, it isn't true. There is of course. And not one reason. But I keep all such reasons under control as I try not to show my longing for Malfoy's goods. No! Not HIS goods, goods in general. At least not to show too much of it to him. He surely knows what I came here for. His cock sprangs up from the bulge that I several times "accidentally" brushed with my fingers as I was undoing his fastenings.
Draco hesitated for a second, but not finding an excuse to take his offer back, grabbed Harry still soaped up shoulders, and started to massage them slowly.
"We? We don't do anything. But if you want to experience how it is to get fucked in the arse, I suggest you go and find somebody who would do it. There are several charms that might be of help, so I can teach you if you want."
As he stepped into the packed lift he glanced at the tableau, only to see that the button to his level was already glowing. He sidestepped to the other side of the cabin, knowing that most of the people behind him would come out earlier. With his single free hand, because his other one was holding two newly-purchased books, he grabbed one of the handles dangling from the ceiling a moment before the lift started moving backwards.
With all the tension evaporated Draco slumped against the wall, feeling relaxed and content; no normal wank ever compared to the one like this. Without thinking he began sticking cum-stained fingers into his mouth one by one, sucking off that meager amount that ended up on them, revelling in the salty bitterness of it and pretending that the cum was not his but Harry's.
"First, I don't know what virgin life you've been leading in Hogwarts, but I've had it all still in school. And second - it's in here I'm celibate. Believe it or not, but house arrest back then didn't mean I wasn't allowed to have witches over."
"Found much?" Ron shook his head avoiding her eyes. "Then let me help you" - she pointed at one of the gravy boats. "This definitely contains either Draught of Living Dead or Kaspian Nightmare. And this" - she pointed at cheese - "is full of some exotic deadly toxins. Looks suspiciously yellow and stuff! Don't you think?! And see all these holes?? They must be from how exceptionally corrosive the poison is. Beware!!"
So soon after lunch all stalls of the bathroom stood empty, which was perfect for Draco. He dropped his books on the table with auto-replenishing rolled-up towels and stepped to a sink to wash his hands. He never understood why people washed their hands only afterwards, and not before as well. He sure was not going to be touching his dick, especially touching it so thoroughly, with dirty hands.
"Nah... It's not like I was the only one among purebloods. A fertility potion and a quick fuck solves the problem. It's not like I'm physically unable to have sex with women. I've never told him, but I'm sure that because I'm with YOU in particular would make his brain implode."
Snape stared at him intently and Harry realized that he was waiting for a confirmation. "Got it. Sectumsempra. Also very dangerous."
Without waiting Harry turned and left. Draco for several seconds stood dumbfounded as if waiting for Harry to understand what he was missing and return.
They were the only ones left in the lift when it finally reached their level. Draco was able to see Harry's distorted reflection in the wide strip of polished brass that framed the doors. But he without looking back, still pretending that he hadn't noticed that Harry was behind him, stepped out. Even though his trousers had an inbuilt concealment charm that wouldn't let his erection show, he still decided to hold the two newly-bought books in front of himself; he knew it was exceptionally rare, but some gifted people were able to see through such charms with their bare eyes, and if one were to encounter somebody like that, it was more plausible on deeper levels of the Ministry. Draco suspected that Harry had the same charms on his own pants. With all the unceasing fantasies it was a must. There was also an option of magical underwear that physically restrained erections, but Draco hated those - it felt unbearably uncomfortable to get hard in them.
"Hm? What part?" Harry put his legs wider, his cock standing at attention. "You were doing fine. I just asked to be more gentle."
Though Azkaban had no more Dementors, it still wasn't all that pleasant place to be in. And Harry agreed with Hermione, which was no surprise, that Malfoy, of all people, had to be given a chance. Especially after he had spent three years behind bars, plus two and a half under house arrest before his trial.
Draco hated to be played with. It was always him who played with others. Careful not to make any direct skin contact with Harry's privates, Draco slowly rubbed the sponge all over. Even THERE. All the while trying to imagine that Harry was a witch, but failing.
"Harry, there you are!" Draco heard the voice of Ada Lovelace exclaim after he made just a few steps from the lift. "I've been looking all over! We need to decide about Puvo-"
Draco stared at Harry completely speechless, in shock; his mind barely started to process Harry giving him a handjob as it turned into a blowjob. Everything happened so quickly. The sensations that Harry's mouth provided washed over him in waves and blanked his mind, so the idea of stopping Harry didn't even enter his thoughts. Through the confusion he had one thought - it felt good. Such sensations he hasn't had in a while.
Harry was standing on his knees over Draco's chest and playfully tapping his cockhead on Draco's tongue. Each time Draco tried to capture it with his lips Harry would pull it up with an impish smile and giggle.
Harry himself thought that a curfew for Malfoy was a silly idea. But he agreed to the terms and had to follow them. Though he did not plan on running to the Ministry to tell-tale on Malfoy even if he was an hour late once in a while. But Malfoy, who did not know that, almost never came home without having at least an hour to spare.
I stand on my knees and with my trembling from anticipation fingers undo the belt. Anticipation?! My hands are a bit cold. Nothing more. After the main button I start fumbling with the damned buttons of the fly. Couldn't Malfoy have bought trousers with a simple zipper?! Of course not... Too muggle for him probably. But it's not like I'd ever enquire on the reason. One by one I undo the ridiculously small buttons that barely fit through their damned holes. Malfoy never wears underwear and soon I start seeing his pubes. All my life I despised pubes. My own in particular. But Malfoy's always make me shudder with desire just at their sight. Maybe it's due to his them being blond, or maybe it's because of the promise of what's to come after and I just learned to associate one with the other...
In that half-a-minute Draco did not see or hear any more thoughts that were not produced by his own mind. He slowed down feeling that he was on the verge of a hiccup and downed the rest of his tea. Maybe Potter was just passing by and it was safe to ...? But before he managed to finish that thought he saw another vision, this time of himself sitting sideways on Harry's lap, wearing the same scant outfit, while Harry was feeding him a chocolate cake.
Harry wasn't surprised as Draco came after barely a minute - he was told before, and not once, that he was good at it. Also even if Draco's dubious claims about having witches over in his old house were true, Draco certainly hasn't had any action in a while besides his own hand.
"Currently? Stroking your cock. But in a second I'm going to be sucking on it," he said simply. Then leaned down and enveloped the tip with his lips.
Harry stopped before he finished asking whether he had to give his verbal agreement in a specific way because after barely noticeable twitch of Snape's wand one end of the tube soared through the air and jammed its needle into Harry's neck, the other, moving like a snake, got into Malfoy's wrist. Ignoring the sharp pain that no doubt would've been much more mild if Madam Pomfrey did the transfusion, Harry watched his blood rush through the transparent tube out of him and straight into Malfoy.
"Why not?" asked Harry trying to remain impassive, but there still was a bit of surprise in his voice.
"Yes! About women!" Draco turned around to face Harry. "When are you finally going to bring somebody over?"
"Don't talk as if I'm not here!" he said, barely containing himself from going into tirade about Harry telling her about his house arrest.
"One dead french guy. Doesn't matter. Even if you're right, and don't believe for a moment that I would even entertain the idea, what all your checking of the food can bring? Afraid that Draco wants to get into your pants as well?"
Harry was about to refill his glass as Draco grabbed the bottle and yanked it out of Harry's hand. Which he wouldn't have dared to do just months ago.
"I am DEAD serious! And you were bummed that Harry told me about getting together with Draco ten months before you? Harry asked me not to tell you, but it just has to be said - it was ME who persuaded Harry to finally tell you. Understand? That's what your attitude does! Your best friend wanted to keep you in the dark because he knew you wouldn't accept it. You should be ashamed of yourself!"
With the shirt for all intents and purposes gone, I again lower down to my knees. His cock at my eye-level. I gulp as I stare at it motionless as the tip of the glans peek out from under the foreskin. It is all for me alone. All I have to do is reach out and grab it with my hand. No matter how many times I've done it, it still exciting and a bit scary. I know that Malfoy won't stop me, in all past times he never gave an indication that he would, but a tiny possibility of it never failed to get into my mind right before the fun begins.
"Merlin, Potter, third time since morning!" he said with exasperation; his heart beating faster than it would've from just a short spry walk. "Can't you keep yourself in check even during lunch today?!"
I stare at the closed door with disappointment and then without any conscious input I swing my leg back to kick it, but stop myself at the last moment. With my teeth gritted I take a deep breath, grab my hard cock from within my left pocket so it wouldn't show, turn, and head to my own office.
Faux-Draco looked ashamed and said nothing, only nodded, to which faux-Harry gave an approving smile and gave the tip of his cock a playful kiss, signifying his forgiveness, which not necessarily meant acquiescence, and resumed stroking the shaft.
Ever since, things only escalated. Harry's fixation on cumming on food, and then usually Draco eating it, was one of several most recent additions. Chocolate desserts being his Harry's favourite because on them semen was most visible. Overall Draco was never able to understand Harry's fascination with semen that bordered on obsession. And because the realm of unreal had no constrains, the amount of cum one of them produced for Harry to play with sometimes exceeded what even the strongest male fertility potions were able provide.
"All done," said Harry. He grabbed the showerhead and rinsed off the soap. "There... Nice and smooth. Perfect. ... Now come closer."
Ron stopped muttering while pointing his wand at the stew and quickly hid his wand in the left sleeve the second Hermione walked back into the room.
"I don't. I'm just saying what already should be obvious to you. Hm... I think I said the same thing just a minute ago."
They argued for another minute before hearing a muffled pop in the corridor. Ron was first to rush out of the living room. He was about to wish Harry a happy birthday when he saw him hugging Draco as their faces were glued to each-other.
Maybe Malfoy would ask for me to..? No! I got what I came here for! I don't even want for him to suck me off. He probably isn't even good. Yes! Most likely he's lousy. But maybe he wants it, but embarrassed to ask me to help him learn? I'd be patient... And it's not like he has to exert himself with me being so damn horny. I'd be happy for just a handjob... Or even through my pants... No! What am I thinking again?! ... Not again! Those are DEFINITELY new thoughts. Very unlike-me ones. Probably because I didn't sleep well last night. Yes, that's the explanation.
"Not bad..." mumbled Harry while chewing, exaggerating his approval a bit, but noting a drastic change from yesterday's chum. Draco has taken to cooking as well, but wasn't good at it what-so-ever.
Draco snorted. "So? Is that supposed to be an argument? Muggles are superior in all this thing. There's no point in denying the obvious. I mean, had I known about this, I would've stopped being a shithead way-way earlier."
I lean forward and rub the tip over my lips. At first gently, then more and more forcefully, almost mashing the cockhead into my lips. His soft part against my soft part.
I tried to give blowjobs to strangers. And I hated it. Every single time. So even Malfoy, relationship with whom I hardly even can call friendly, is by orders of magnitude better than some stranger. I just can't do it with strangers for some reason; I always have to know a person well. I don't know any muggles; all of my my friends and acquaintances are from the wizarding world. Malfoy is the only one who knows that I'm bi. At least he's the only one with a cock who knows it. If only she knew who I'm doing it with... But carte blanche means she doesn't have to know.
Harry tried to hold himself in check and waited for a reply, instead of lunging forward. He saw Draco look his face over a few times and then lick his lips. Deciding that was his cue, Harry leaned a bit and pressed his lips to Draco's.
They were lying on the bed, both came not long ago, and Draco was spooned. It was the fourth month since both have woken up on the bed after an evening of heavy drinking. Afterwards Harry offered and Draco agreed to stop bunking on an uncomfortable couch while Harry had a big and comfortable bed that was enough for the two of them.
Harry expected to steal maybe a few nibbles on Draco's lips, but instead Draco tilted his head left and opened his mouth against Harry's. Harry felt electrified as their tongues connected and started to caress each other softly - this was far more that Harry hoped for seconds before.
Harry grinned. He leaned to Draco and sniffed his hair, knowing Draco's penchant to take long baths in the middle of the day. "You took a bath not long ago, right?"
Draco grinned. "Did you just say that dicks don't discuss you? It looks like you already had too much."
"That bloke I saw you snogging with that night in the alley, what about him? You said you met him that very day. And with me you refuse to -"
Harry without a word pointed at the bathroom door, drawing Draco's eyes to it and to a standard-sized piece of paper that was taped to it. The paper was not even simply white, but seemed to glow, which made it seemingly impossible not to notice. And yet, somehow Draco had missed it when he, in his horny state, had rushed to the bathroom no more than twenty minutes ago. It stated in big letters that were easily readable from where he stood: "Unidirectional silencing charms are taken down until further notice. Use your own. - Administration."
There was also one other way for Draco to stop reading Harry's mind, but it was virtually inaccessible to him. Two years prior Draco accidentally discovered that direct skin-to-skin contact cut everything off the same way disapparition to another part of the country would. But it lasted only as long as they remained physically in contact. It had happened only twice. First time by chance, when somebody stumbled and fell upon Harry, propelling him right into Draco, temporarily cutting off Harry's stream of salacious thoughts he happened to have at that moment. And second time a month later, when Draco finally gathered enough courage to test the hypothesis, which he confirmed. Not that it changed anything.
Draco bit his lip as he felt it becoming too much even without touching himself, and next second he felt Harry's orgasm wash over him. Which triggered his own. At last! He immediately grabbed his cock and began pumping it furiously, intensifying the already powerful sensations even more. Forgetting that there was no need for it, Draco pressed his left hand against his mouth, muffling his grunts, as he painted the opposite wall with his cum, watching faux-himself doing the same to faux-Harry's face and feeling it from Harry's point of view, as if hot gooey streaks were covering his own face.
All throughout the descend deep underground Draco tried to keep his face neutral, which was difficult. He never had trouble appearing calm while in distress, but when a smile tried to break out, it wasn't as easy. Especially because the bulk of positive emotions Draco felt came from Harry. Draco tried to use different mind tricks that sometimes helped to detach himself from what he was seeing and feeling. But, as it was the case most of the times, it was barely of any use. Draco's cock had woken up even from that imaginary light spanking, and now it was rock hard. Arousal was arousal, and his body was never able to differentiate its own from Harry's. More so because Harry's seemed so much more intense, easily overshadowing its own.
Harry sighed and turned to sit on the edge of his bed, contemplating cursing Draco. But that was the first time he was woken up like that, so he decided to go and see what Draco wanted; he always had an option to curse him afterwards.
It took some convoluted justifications, but Hermione managed in the end to persuade the panel that Harry Potter was the second victim to Draco's crimes. So since Aberforth did not show any willingness, Harry came in. Harry also was not that enthusiastic about the idea. But he wanted to support Hermione, so after several mediated meetings with Draco in the Azkaban, Harry agreed to give it a try.
He as for the first two times they have taken showers together, felt a bit indebted for the blowjob and agreed to wash Harry the same way Harry washed him before. After all, washing meant nothing.
Draco knew that Harry liked the feeling of a cock in his mouth, and Draco had learned to like it by proxy. Watching his own cock slide back and forth through Harry's lips while feeling as if that cock was sliding through his own lips produced a little dissonance, but Draco long ago learned to ignore it and simply enjoy it the way Harry was able to. Almost no women Draco had been with, or maybe none at all, he was not sure, enjoyed giving head. They did it out of reciprocation, turning it into quid pro quo. But Harry did it for its own sake, or at least he imagined doing it like that. That seemingly insignificant tidbit was an incredible turn on for Draco.
"Hate him? What gave you that idea? I just think it would be NEAT, as you like to call it. I don't hate him now. He was raised the same way I was. Only he didn't have his own Hermione the way I have. I more like pity him."
"Not in the slightest. I wasn't in contact with either of them since the day after the Dark Lord fell. I only want to remind you how it might affect you specifically. You haven't even told Weasley yet. Why? Because he will freak out just like I my ex-freinds would've. And he's not alone."
As Harry's second foot got back down, Draco looked up, mindful not to stare at Harry's very much hard cock that was closer to his face that he felt comfortable with, and asked, "Happy now?"
"Well... Maybe a little. Oh, finally some tits!" A moment later Draco hit the throw cushion in exasperation. "And now we have to see her squeezing HIS arse on the whole screen?!"
On the minus eleventh level Draco briefly considered to come out along with two witches and go to the Ministry Library, even though he did not really have the need to. Just to mess with Potter! Draco even happened to hold two books that would make it look like it was his intention all along, not that he expected to be questioned on that. But before he came to a decision the doors closed and they went further down.
Harry stared at the drain, watching as milky strands swirled in a whirlpool for a few seconds before disappearing. He looked up and saw Draco looking up right away, pretending that he wasn't staring at his cum vanishing into the plumbing.
Besides being a Death Eater, which was mostly accepted that Draco Malfoy became one under duress, he was convicted for his direct involvement of smuggling Death Eaters into Hogwarts which ultimately lead to Albus Dumbledore's death and some other minor injuries that some of the students and others sustained.
Harry's fantasies weren't strictly visual. Most of the time they were more like ideas, notions, feelings. Usually when they turned visual meant that Draco was in Harry's field of view, or when they were about sex. The most inconvenient part was not the visual one, it wasn't that difficult to ignore it, but the feelings and emotions that were also transmitted to him. It was impossible to ignore them no matter how hard Draco tried. Occlumency technics were completely ineffective. The arousal, the desire, the need... All those emotions sometimes outright overwhelmed Draco, who himself barely ever had such strong feelings about anybody.
At first Harry was surprised at how uncaring Draco was about wanking so openly, but then, after thinking it over, decided that there was no harm in it, and started joining from time to time if he felt like it.
Draco chuckled. "I meant Kant with an A. Doesn't matter. Anyway, I just showed you a way out because you seem not to be able to live without pussy."
"None. I only wish I'd be able to see my father's face if the word ever gets to him that I'm in love with you and like my muggle life."
"Don't worry," said Harry lying beside Draco an hour after Jane has left. "Jane said she had fun and wants to do it again."
"What?!" asked Draco in a defensive tone after Harry's greeting. He was standing in the living room unbuttoning his jacket while trying to look like he wasn't out of breath and that he hadn't run all the way there.
There was also one other option - Draco's brain constructing all visuals from basics or incomplete information that was transmitted to him from Harry. After all, Draco still did not know the mechanism by which he was able to read Harry's mind. But Draco did not like it because of its implications. In Harry's fantasies Harry's dick was noticeably bigger than Draco's. Which was the most apparent during frotting that on occasion Harry imagined them engage in. Draco doubted that Harry would fantasize about having a bigger dick. That would've been outright pathetic. In Draco's mind 'Harry Potter' and 'pathetic' did not seem like something that could be said in a single sentence, so Draco dismissed that possibility. So if all visual details were a pure construct of Draco's mind, it meant that size discrepancy originated from his own insecurity. And THAT was for sure the most embarrassing thing, which Draco was not able to accept. In comparison, something seemingly impossible like Harry sneaking into Slytherin dungeons and into his room back in the day, or into his current warded flat, to spy on Draco, seemed much more acceptable.
Ron's face got red and he almost knocked Hermione off her feet when he abruptly stopped and turned around. He grabbed her wrist and led her back.
The words barely registered in Draco's mind as Harry grabbed his cock and started to stroke it, all the while looking up completely nonchalantly with a small, almost wicked smile. Draco stared not believing his eyes. The feeling of somebody else's hand wrapped around his cock, what he hasn't had for a while, hampered his thinking.
The spanking was not rough and was done in a playful manner, looking more like Harry was patting Draco's naked, obviously, bum - Potter wasn't a sadist. The reason? Draco leaving the cafeteria when apparently he shouldn't have. It wasn't said in words, but it did not have to be, Draco was just able to understand the reason. He felt it. He was able to disassociate from that emotion to a degree, but partially it still felt like self-flagellation, as if he was unhappy with himself for leaving. Luckily it soon was overshadowed by Harry's arousal. The whole thing was erotic and amusing at the same time. Who else would call Draco a bad boy in a reproachful tone while giving him soft pats on his bare behind? The approach on its own was a turned on for Draco.
Draco was feeling like he was on the verge of cumming when once again the vision changed and Draco saw them kissing. Knowing that it was Harry's way to put it on the back burner, Draco just relaxed and with a silly smile plastered on his face and his mouth half-open imagined kissing Harry back.
Harry nodded and got down onto the carpet inbetween Draco's legs. Draco was as always already slumped way down, but Harry grabbed him under the knees and yanked him to himself even more, so that his bum ended up just at the edge of the couch.
Harry grinned. "I like finishing while in a bathtub. Cum looks so ethereal in water. Almost like swirling memories in a Pensieve."
"Yep," said Harry, who was no less inebriated. Harry released his own cock, though continued to play with Draco's. He stroked Draco's cheek with his knuckles and nodded towards the screen. "They are having so much fun, aren't they?"
I pull back and press his cock to the abdomen. Then I start to lick the underside of the shaft. Go from the balls up to the tip in long slow strokes. Almost like a cat. Sometimes I curve my tongue to caress sides of the shaft. As always I keep fighting with myself, split between doing everything slow and gently, and the other option...
Jane shrugged and put her mouth back around Harry's cock. She tapped the back of Draco's head, prompting him to return his mouth back to her crotch.
I don't even roll off the foreskin at first as I finally take his cock into my mouth. I make it nice and wet and gently suck over it. I stopped pulling off the foreskin at the start of blowjobs only recently. I don't even know whether Malfoy likes it like that or not. In my own experience it still feels nice, just not as good. But who cares what Malfoy thinks? It is fun to do it. So I keep going. Slowly.
Draco remained in the cubicle for another minute after he heard the door swinging as Harry left. He ignored that intrusive thought, that gnawing doubt that plagued him from time to time, the one that wanted to convince him that those were not Potter's thoughts. Never were. That it all was a product of his own mind. That he just was deranged. Went off his rocker. From all the shit that the Dark Lord made him see and do. Or from that unknown curse that Potter hit him with back in Hogwarts from which he still had some thin scars, predominantly over his left ribs.
With his pants gone, and his hard cock pointing straight into my face I grimace as I'm forced to raise back up. I should've started with the shirt, but sometimes I just forget about it and as if in a rush go straight for the pants. And the shirt obscuring the view grit on my nerves. A naked abdomen... No, naked everything is much better.
"Me? No." Harry squinted at him in mixture of confusion and disbelief. "I just stated the obvious way out for you. I like being fucked, but it's not like I can't live without it. And overall, people cheat. Lots of people. If you're going to be smart about it and don't get caught, then chances are you'd get away with it."
From those words Harry had a flashback to what had happened at the graveyard almost two years prior. Which not in the slightest helped him remain calm and think rationally. Snape shook a coil of thin transparent tube with short glinting needles at both ends that he just finished conjuring, drawing Harry's attention to it, as if emphasizing that Harry had no choice but to comply. In the background Harry wandered if Snape becoming physical for the second time in the past minutes, which Snape had never done before, was connected with Snape's allegedly fictitious Unbreakable Vow that nobody seemed to take seriously besides Harry.
"Harry's might be impaired and you're not impartial because if Malfoy plots something, it would mean your RJ program isn't as successful."
Harry gave him a few playful strokes before pressing the cock to the abdomen and starting with the underside of the shaft, going a little to the ballsack with each pass of the razor, shaving off the month-long pubes. Harry was more careful than he would've been with himself, knowing that if he accidentally nicked him, Draco might be not as agreeable next time.
"I have nothing against the fact that it turned out that he likes blokes as well." At Hermione piercing gaze he added. "Now, I mean. But there are a whole lot of them whose last name isn't Malfoy!"
Harry’s heart beats very fast. The sweater smells like Malfoy, and he was thinking as he walked in that it was a good thing no one else in the Auror’s office was likely to have been paying enough attention to their Legilimency consultant to know what he smelled like, but now
His sudden appearance in the newsroom causes a bit of a stir, but it’s early enough that only a few of the desks are occupied. The night editor is still on, and happily he's intimidated enough by Harry’s presence that he gives up Rita Skeeter’s home address without complaint.
Then they’re in the master bedroom. The transition is jarring, to go from the sort of grief that felt like a hand twisting in his chest to this: shivering wonderfully on Draco’s fingers, both of them smeared with sweat and spunk, rapturous.
Kreacher doesn’t come. No one comes. Harry feels like he’s fifteen again, like he’s just lost his godfather not even two years after he got him. Like he’s been hit in the stomach with a baseball bat and he can’t let it show on his face.
“Alright,” Harry says, alarmed. He lets Draco manhandle him, like he’s checking to make sure he’s still all there, then smothers him in a crushing hug. “Alright, Draco, I’m alright.”
giving it to him, sliding in slow to let him feel every inch, and Harry already knew Draco’s cock was bigger but he didn’t really have an appreciation of
Ron continues to be shocked and appalled all the way down the stairs to the flat, where he pulls Harry aside and asks him very seriously if he’s being mind controlled.
His body arches up off the chair, nearly unseating Harry, every muscle pulled taut. Harry holds his face, peppering kisses over his cheeks, over his thin, aquiline nose, over the sweaty lock of hair plastered to his ear, holding him as best he can in this position, while Draco clings to him and shivers delicately and pumps him full of come.
“By talking to everyone who’s ever so much as bumped into you on the street,” Hermione says, snatching the kettle off as soon as it starts to whistle. “It’s going to be a load of crock, is what it is. Tabloid rubbish.”
going round to the pub with some of the other Aurors, but most of them kept their heads down during the war—didn’t even
been a Weasley—never would be, now that him and Ginny had split—and it had been awful to sit there feeling like he was inflicting himself upon their happiness, this boy their daughter had dumped, who’d forever be stuck in their family photos, immortalized hovering awkwardly on the edge of things.
Futortentia isn’t as strong as Amortentia, Harry knows—it can’t make you want things you wouldn’t normally want. It only makes you want them more—more urgently, more desperately. A wizard, for instance, who wants to know what sex is like with a mermaid will still want to know what sex is like with a mermaid, he’ll just want to take his sweet time finding out; a wizard who only loves one man will still only love one man, he’ll just want to make love to him for hours, extravagantly, insatiably, hungrily.
Some time later, his mug empty, dregs going cold on the ledge beside him, he becomes aware of a commotion in the flat below. Someone’s pounding on the door, Ron’s shouting in tired confusion about it being common bloody courtesy to use the Floo at this bloody hour, and with an electric jolt, Harry recognizes Draco’s voice.
“What have you been doing to yourself?” Malfoy asked him after one session, a month or so into the training. “You’ve got big empty spots in your mind, like something’s missing, but it doesn’t follow a trauma pattern.”
“Blast,” Draco repeats. “What do you want? Zabini’s got every wizarding toy under the sun, there are about a dozen willing sacrifices in the next room, one of them’s probably got red hair—”
“Yes, Potter, hello,” says Blaise Zabini, sounding bored. He’s wearing something that’s almost a kimono, sheer and clinging to his body. He pours a glass of deep purple liquor and drapes himself across a plush chaise, where Harry can see literally every inch of him. “It’s been a while, et cetera, you look awful, I look fantastic, can we just get on with whatever it is and leave the small talk to the regular people?”
Malfoy’s mask of haughty imperviousness doesn’t disappear, but it does shift, the longer Harry stays quiet. For a moment Harry almost thinks he’s
She’ll always be a part of him, Harry thinks. Obviously she will. She was his first everything—first love, first time, first love lost. She put her fingers in him when he asked even though she didn’t really see the appeal, went out and bought a “Real Thing” strap-on at a wizarding sex shop; she was his partner in crime for so many years, sly knowing smiles exchanged over dinner at the Burrow, pick-up quidditch on Sunday morning, waging a years-long war of which-is-the-better-takeaway over the Thai restaurant on the corner and the Indian place on the next street. As much as he doesn’t really trust her not to hurt him, anymore, he does trust her with this.
The morning after he leaves Malfoy in bed, memory of his second and third orgasms stored neatly away in his safe, Harry wakes to someone pounding on the door like the building’s on fire. He mutters a quick spell as he levers himself out of bed, sending all the scraps of paper taped up around his flat skittering into hiding, and makes it to the door just as the last
Let it blow over, she says, but Harry wonders if this sort of thing ever really blows over. It’s going to be in a book, on a shelf, available for anyone to read, for the rest of his life. All those parts of himself that only Ginny was ever supposed to know; that only the person who shares his bed is supposed to know.
Would it have been the sort of party with kids? Would Draco have been down here, tumbling with the other children on the lawn, his mother catching him by the elbow as he tore past, scolding him not to ruin his robes? Or would he have been relegated to the house, haunting the kitchens, maybe, sneaking away with a tray of tiny cakes (Harry, when he imagines the childhood he might’ve had with his real parents, mostly thinks of cake), watching the musical hubbub of the party out the window of the room Harry slept in last night, gossipping with the snakes.
“Alright,” Draco says. He takes Harry’s face in his hands, smoothing his hair back, and bends to kiss him on the forehead. “As long as you’re sure.”
Looking back, remembering what Draco called him, what he did to him, Harry feels like he could die from embarrassment, which makes him want to hit something, and more than a few Guatemalan snakes end up as the undeserving targets of his ire; in between climbing trees and curling around branches eavesdropping on scorched, sickly-green potions makers, Harry lies wide awake in his bigger-on-the-inside hanging tent and wanks furiously, thinking of Draco. Naked and covered with sweat in the humidity, because wizards might’ve got some things down to a science but they really haven’t mastered climate control, hand stripping his cock, Draco the morning after the Futortentia, cleaning Harry off in the bath—the
Draco kisses his ear, the side of his head. One of his hands skates under Harry’s shirt, under the sweater, to run through the hair on his chest. “Don’t hide from me,” he growls, with a
“Really?” Draco worms his way down underneath him, so they’re face-to-face. He’s blurry, Harry’s glasses are sitting on his nightstand, but it’s clear enough that he’s grinning. “I had plenty of those kind.”
The issue is decided for him when Ron and Hermione arrive, laden with bags from Mme Malkin’s and the Gap. They’re talking to each other in low voices as they come through the door, windswept and harried. Hermione under her knit dress is starting to actually look pregnant, and the emotions Harry feels when he notices are complicated—happiness, of course, because he knows they’ll be great parents, he knows how much they’ve been wanting this, but also a sick sort of anticipation, a souring of the simple, familiar contentment he normally feels when he sees them, because he knows that with every day that passes they’re only going to drift further away.
Malfoy looks like he’s had a hellish morning, by which Harry means he’s got a few hairs out of place and he’s rolled up his sleeves, but he doesn’t say anything about it as Harry enters the training room. He gestures for Harry to sit down. “Take a seat, Potter, we’ve got a lot of work to do.”
ing shut and Draco turning back to him, that they’re in a library, that he can hear faint sighs and moans drifting out of the books, that one left open on the reading table shows a drawing of what could either be a naked game of Quidditch or a complicated Victorian-era threesome, with the legend HIS HUGE PENIS MENACED THE SKIES…
It’s not until the next morning, hurrying down the stairs in a pair of Draco’s pants to retrieve his wand from his bag by the front door, that Harry remembers about Rita Skeeter’s book.
He reunites with the first a few hours later, after spending his lunch hour with Finch-Fletchley poring over import records down in the Office of Magical Revenue & Customs.
Draco shakes his head, hand squeezing Harry’s knee. “Nothing’s the matter. I just want you to know that you’re never going to owe me anything for looking after you. You don’t owe people for loving you.”
What’s so humiliating and so devastating that he can’t even think of voicing it, is this: he wants to be fucked to sleep.
obsessed—following surreptitiously through corridors, quiet noise of staircases grinding somewhere behind him, stone against stone, sick hot throbbing of heart, wand in clenched fist, cold sweat of anticipation, doorway of boys’ bathroom, blond head and red eyes in reflection and the shock—
him—he wants Draco to ruin him, he wants to be held down and made to take it, kissed and touched and wound slowly excruciatingly tighter until he comes dry.
It was a good thing it was just a Stinging Hex, because the wizard who’d shot it off had juiced it with much more power than it needed. As a result Harry hit the floor in a very undignified manner and spent the next five or so minutes staring at the ceiling with tears in his eyes commenting, “Ow,” to a vast number of people who stopped by to see if he was alright.
“Also,” Ron says, when Hermione’s done answering all the normal questions that Harry doesn’t know to ask (how far along are you, do you know the sex, have you got names picked out), “I checked out St. Mungo’s to see if anyone came in last night with burns from a ward fire.”
Harry might not remember the very end of his and Ginny’s relationship, but he remembers the rest. He remembers the first wobbly, unfamiliar days in sixth year, finding their legs together like newborn foals—the growing pains of life after the war, how she spent weeks resenting him after Fred’s death, how she’d cried most of the way through that first year even when they were making love, the bubbly happiness of coming back from tryouts for the Harpies with a letter of commitment to bear Harry down onto the couch in their flat and kiss him and kiss him. He’d been ecstatic at first, ecstatic for her, ecstatic that everything was falling neatly into place, like he’d expected it to, like he knew it was supposed to.
Harry made a marked effort not to start any fights, after that. But he couldn’t exactly admit to Malfoy that he had portions of memory missing because he
Ginny stares at him like he’s an idiot. Hermione stares at him patronizingly. Harry would blame the lack of sleep, the incident with the milk, and the fact that he can still hear Malfoy saying
He can feel come dripping down his shin from where Malfoy rutted off against him, and privately he’s having a very difficult time convincing himself it’s not the hottest thing that’s ever happened to him.
” Draco shouts, like Harry’s a child who’s just announced he spent the day running around with a knife. “Of all the idiotic—Why didn’t you bloody
So Harry tells him. “I realized I was in love with you,” he says, scooping the words out of his chest. “And I knew it was too soon. That it might always be too soon, that you might not want that at all…”
, something—or at least would’ve tried their luck while he was actually home, not during work hours. But he doesn’t want to send the DMLE after Rita Skeeter, not if she’s actually got his memories, because then they’d be logged as official evidence. Having his dirty laundry—whatever dirty laundry it turns out to be, and he
“Yes, I’d have guessed as much,” Zabini says, with a significant look at Harry. “I mean, the only other possibility was that you’d finally managed to bugger Potter—”
Ron looks like he’s passing a particularly large and unruly kidney stone, but he reaches out to clap Harry manfully on the shoulder. “Well. I’m glad you’re happy, mate. We were getting worried there, for a while—you know, that you’d never find someone.”
Before he can figure out what to do—Apparate back to Grimmauld Place for a depressing seven-hour wank? Try to tough it out? Hold Zabini at wandpoint and demand an antidote that doesn't exist?—the door to Zabini’s office opens and Malfoy comes out.
Not a risky estimation, given that they’re approximately the same height. Harry might be a bit broader across the shoulders, but that’s nothing a simple alteration charm can’t fix.
Harry trots up the steps, legs wobbly, and follows him down the hall towards his study. He only knows where the study is because it opens into the bedroom and he wandered through it on his way out, the other night; it’s a stately, oak-paneled room with bookshelves most of the way to the ceiling and lanterns floating just above head height that sputter and brighten as they enter.
because his face and neck suddenly feel very cold, but then Draco kisses the base of his spine, just above his arse, moving his own sweater out of the way to do it, and Harry feels a bead of precome weep out his cock, and he thinks: oh, fuck, I love him.
“I don’t understand,” Harry says. He’s still standing in the doorway, his hair sticking up in all directions, dazed even though he didn’t sleep a wink last night after leaving the Manor. “How can she write a book about me without even talking to me?”
“I spoke with my mother, myself,” Malfoy offers. Most of his attention is on the mind map, now, like Harry’s not even in the room. “And a professional. I couldn’t risk it in London, of course—they’d have sold the transcripts of our sessions to the press and retired wealthy. But I found a witch in Russia.”
. It was about being worthy of respect, because of his name, yes, because of his lineage, but also because of who he was. Who he’d grown into. No matter that he would’ve landed on his feet. Harry didn’t want him to have to.
The chair moves underneath them, scooting in centimeters across the polished wood floor as Harry makes every attempt to fuck Draco straight through it. Blunt, manicured fingernails rake up his sides, dig into his shoulders. Draco pulls him down to kiss him, just holding his mouth against Harry’s, like he wants to say something to him but has forgotten what words to use to do it. Harry rakes one hand through his hair, messing it up even more, and braces the other against the back of the chair so he has leverage to shove down onto him in a hard, twisting grind. His glasses fog up between their faces.
His hands slide up Malfoy’s back, over his shoulders to bury in his hair and pull him down into a hard, affirmative kiss. Draco shudders some more, striping Harry’s stomach with another thick rope of come, then bites Harry’s lip, rolls off him, and falls promptly asleep.
memories, not yours. They’ll have come from a foreign source, genuinely.” He stops, looking unsure of himself for the first time since he began. “It won’t be perfect, of course,” he says. “They’ll feel like something you read in a book, or saw on stage—not something that happened to you. But you’ll remember, and you won’t risk killing yourself trying to get them back in.”
Draco has figured out how to get Harry’s brain to accept his wayward memories without rejecting them—“Because I am brilliant and deserving of every award wizarding England could possibly bestow,” according to him—and as he spills each of Harry’s vials carefully into the Pensieve, he explains:
. It’s not somewhere Harry’s ever had a tongue before, and it’s a good thing Draco’s got a firm, bruising grip on his hips, because if he didn’t Harry’s fairly sure he would’ve shot forward away from his mouth like a rocket. It feels
Draco stops him with a sharp shake of the head. He takes out his wand and draws the memories back into the Pensieve. His hand is shaking. Harry wants to hold him around the waist, but he gets the sense it wouldn’t quite be welcome, so he doesn’t. He goes to stand next to him, as close as he can get without touching, and together they lean over the basin and into the past.
Which is how he ends up following a flying ball of fluff through the halls of the Manor to the east sitting room, a charming, pale green room on the far side of the house, which he’d never have found on his own. Malfoy is just sitting down to a vast breakfast spread when he arrives, the
him to leave, per se. He’d rather he could do something like get down on one knee, or abduct Malfoy to his flat in Diagon Alley, where he could putter around the kitchen for the next several decades, insulting Harry’s Muggle appliances and frowning at the telly. But somehow he doesn’t think Malfoy would be amenable to either.
Happily, Malfoy dispensed with the pretense the moment they were behind the Manor’s wards. “I trust we can both be adults about this,” he said, waving his coat into a closet in the front hall, shooting his cuffs with their pearl cufflinks and turning to face Harry with a sharp step. “No strings attached, obviously—”
“And the first one?” Malfoy asks. His voice is pinched, alarmed. “How long ago did you start this nonsense?”
“Look at you,” he says, warm and appreciative, as he banishes each piece of Harry’s clothing one by one, until Harry is standing there in his glasses and nothing else. He’s breathing hard, like he’s been running; he skates one hand up the side of Harry’s arm, raising goosebumps as he skims over his shoulder, and takes hold of the nape of his neck to draw him into a hard, speaking kiss. “You really were made for me.”
They are, at best, tepid work acquaintances. They’ve barely just gotten on speaking terms. Malfoy still mostly hates him, never mind that he just came all over him twice. As usual, Harry’s heart has gotten ahead of itself.
wishes he’d marked those bloody vials—aired for all his colleagues is hardly better than having it aired for all of wizarding Britain.
. She’s included so many embellishments—he wanted to drink their blood, he told them he was a vampire, he begged to suck their toes—that Harry hopes the true stuff will ring as false. Still, he feels nauseous at the idea of people reading this. People knowing this about him. The only person who’s supposed to know that Harry Potter is a needy bottom is upstairs, faceplanted in silk pillows, sleeping off several glorious orgasms.
Malfoy stares at him for a long moment. Harry has a sudden sense-memory of Malfoy holding his eyes while he worked his fingers into him, something between them pulled tight like a string.
Then he’d started coming home more and more to an empty flat, Ginny away at matches or away at practice or out with the rest of the Harpies getting photographed at wizarding clubs in rundown shopfronts in Muggle London, and in the quiet and the cold bed and his reflection in the inky black windows he’d started to resent her. He wanted someone to come home to, he told her eventually, and she accused him of wanting a housewife, and wouldn’t listen when he said no—he just wanted a home, someone who was there, someone who wasn’t always gone, and she’d fired back that she didn’t want that, that it wasn’t enough for her to sit at home waiting for him, and that wasn’t what he was saying at all and basically they’d had such a schism of understanding, such a split in what they were saying, what they were hearing, that they never really talked to each other again. Not the real way, not how they’d talked in those long nights at the end of the war, curled up together whispering with their faces close together in her room at the Burrow, Ginny playing with his hands, her hair a riot of flames against the pillows.
"Given that we already established that we're not progressing to anal, that is what I meant by going further. Snogging is that further. Cuddling as well."
Harry parted his lips and finally put them around the cock. Harry knew that Draco wasn't going to last long after all the edging he has done over the past half-an-hour, but he didn't expect to have his mouth to be filled with cum after barely a few hearty sucks. Harry grabbed the shaft just as the first spurt hit his tongue and stroked it for a few seconds as spurts kept coming. And when he deemed Draco to be done, Harry turned to the drain and spit the cum into it.
"You know? I hadn't up until the last thing that came out of your mouth. That was just teasing. But now I really have. We're definitely not doing anything tonight." Draco grabbed the bottle and with a thud put it back right before Harry. "So drink away."
Draco had to interact with Harry from time to time because he was Draco's immediate chief. Not that Draco worked for him, but because his small newly-formed, by the Ministry standards, department had no oversight, it was delegated to Harry. Through some of the interactions with Harry Draco had difficulties keeping composure because not infrequently Harry out of the blue would let his fantasy loose right in the middle of conversations and imagine doing all kinds of things with Draco being in various states of undress. Or dressed up in scanty women's clothes.
"Don't be ridiculous. I meant reintegration into society. Harry wouldn't have gotten into a relationship with Draco if he didn't -"
"You want a real answer? Okay... If I don't want to get back to Azkaban, I have to live under your supervision for another... How much is it now? A year and a half? A bit more. Blowjobs are okay. No complains there. Besides, you became much better as of late. Anyway, if I -"
"No. I already said that. And that's a stupid thing to ask. Of course I'm going to say No irregardless of my intentions. I might be completely honest, or be a lying bastard. How would you know? We're both trained a bit in Occlumency, so even a statement under Veritaserum can't be trusted. Besides, I might think one way now and change my mind over time. Honestly, Harry, you are not a child. Why do I need to say all this self-evident crap?"
All his previous grievances at the disturber of peace immediately forgotten, Draco resumed wanking, revelling in the steadily growing in intensity sensations, stroking his cock at a significantly slower pace than usually. His own arousal mixing with the one from Harry made it a lot stronger and within a minute he had to let his cock go lest he finish right that moment.
"I'm curious," began Harry with a smirk, a semblance of which Draco did not remember ever seeing on Harry's face. "What exactly should I be asking you? You sounded desperate almost..."
"Well..." Harry skidded closer to Draco and pressed his fully naked body to Draco's pyjamas-clad one. "Either way, my-sober-self has enough love for the two of us."
Hermione shrugged and said also in a hushed tone, "Good for them. It just means that in Draco's case my program has worked as intended."
"Potter, I shouldn't be doing this..." mumbled Draco as Harry was sensually sucking on his balls, his arms wrapped around Draco's thighs.
It’s not the first time he’s come tonight, to be exact about it, but the first time he came he wasn’t quite
Draco notices. He nuzzles Harry’s face with intent, his hand drifting south. Harry’s cock has been through so much tonight that he almost wants to angle his hips away, but also he never wants Draco to ever stop touching him. He wants—he wants things that gut him, things he can’t even articulate, things that make him feel like the child he never was, a child throwing a tantrum and gorging himself on cake.
Harry looks out through the pass-through window into the living room, where Draco is inspecting the magical pull-out couch in much the same manner one would inspect a dead rat in the yard. “I’m not being mind controlled,” he says. “I think I’ve been in love with him since I figured out what my cock was for, actually.”
Truth is, he thinks it’s a pretty spot-on theory. Anyone who broke in to hurt him would’ve left something behind—a trap, a curse meant to go off as soon as he cast
“It always made me feel very safe, when she called me that,” Draco says beside him, voice thick with tears, “and very loved.”
“Of course I came for you, you tosser,” Draco says, tipping him back into bed. “A month is too long. A month is much too long, and I expect you to tell Kingsley Shacklebolt as much the next time you see him.”
The Astronomy Tower is first. They watch from beneath the stairs as the drama unfolds like a stageplay in front of them. Dumbledore, Snape, sixteen-year-old Draco’s voice thick and nasally with tears. Or rather,
He lets them fuss over him, though—or rather, exchanges exasperated eyebrow-raises with Ron while Hermione fusses over him. He puts on the clothes they brought him, trying not to wince as all the new skin he’s just grown tugs painfully, and stands by while Hermione handles all the business of checking him out of the hospital. He goes along with Ron Side-Along Apparating him to the phone booth entrance to the Ministry, and when he comes out of his debriefing nearly six hours later, he doesn’t protest Ron Side-Along Apparating him again, this time back to his and Hermione’s flat.
His mouthful of scone suddenly tastes like ash. He swallows thickly, and says, “I’m staying with someone already, actually.”
“Ah,” Zabini says, leaning back with his hands folded over his stomach. “Having trouble with the reintegration?”
Draco looks up at his entry. He’s sitting in one of the armchairs by the fire, wrapped in a house coat, pince-nez on and a roll of parchment in his lap. “Harry,” he says, in a voice low enough for the hour. “Sorry. I didn’t want to wake you, but I didn’t want to go far, either.”
Some time later, they wash up out of the sea of pleasure onto the shore of Draco’s bed, sprawled out tangled together on the cool expanse of his silken sheets. Harry has come twice dry, on top of all the times he came wet. He feels like a raw nerve, more exhausted than he has since the war ended, but in a fantastic, luxurious sort of way, as if Draco has taken his body apart piece by piece and massaged each of them thoroughly before putting him back together. Draco’s thumb moves back and forth over the bone behind Harry’s ear, his chest rising and falling under Harry’s head, and says, “You saw his dreams?”
, obscenely, beautifully wrong, to have the bony, aquiline bridge of Draco’s nose pressed against his cleft, Draco’s hands hauling him back onto the warm, wet muscle of his tongue.
idea of what’s in it, before it’s released to the public and people start hassling him about it on the street.
Malfoy moves to the bookshelf that lines the far wall, a candle floating away from Zabini’s desk to follow him. “I remember you had a party a while back—one of those born-again virgin affairs. There was a woman who wandered off without getting her memories back.”
, after they’ve slipped off gradually to sleep—Harry jolts awake out of a dream about hostile dinner service to find the bed next to him empty.
, Harry thinks as he follows him through the dark, smoky halls of the club, among other uncharitable thoughts. The furnishings are all dark wood, the hangings crimson, and behind beaded curtains are shadowy, entwined forms whose low, desperate noises Harry tries hard not to hear. He wishes he’d had the foresight to drink some Polyjuice, or at least bring his cloak along—if there’s not something about him being here in the
Malfoy looks a little startled. He also looks very regal in the velvet house coat he’s wearing, now that Harry has a chance to notice, like the heir to some nineteenth-century nation-state. He looks warm, and competent, and Harry wants to bound up the stairs and slide his arms around his waist and bury his face in his neck, but instead he says, “I need your help, Malfoy.”
“Take out everything about Draco Malfoy,” Harry cuts in, voice hard, “and I’ll let you see the memory of when Voldemort killed me.”

They’ve turned the guest room into a nursery (“Sorry, mate,” Ron says, with a tired smile, “we should’ve known you’d get yourself nearly-killed again before the baby came”) but Hermione transfigures the couch into a bed (“I wanted to get one of those pull-outs, you know, the Muggle kind, but Ron wouldn’t stop giggling”) and they leave Harry, so exhausted at this point he feels like he’s been hit by a lorry, to lie down and stare at the ceiling.
“KREACHER!” he bellows, the moment he’s over the threshold. He doesn’t like Kreacher sneaking up on him any more than Kreacher likes being snuck up on, and he’s found the best way to avoid both is to move around with the approximate noise level of a herd of blast-ended skrewts.
, because Malfoy bloody Manor hasn’t got any showers—and slipping those silk pants up his legs, over his hips, not quite big enough to fit Harry’s width so they’d ended up stretched obscenely, leaving nothing to the imagination, and Draco had mouthed him through them and then pulled them down under his balls and sucked him off mercilessly until he cried and came, his arse clenching spasmodically even though there was nothing in it, just the sense memory of Draco’s cock having been there all night, and—“
He doesn’t wait for Harry to answer. He taps his wand to his temple and pulls out a pearlescent thread of memory, letting it fall into the Pensieve. Then he turns to Harry expectantly and holds out his hand.
Harry eases out of bed as Malfoy snores beside him. Even his snore sounds well-bred, and Harry gathers his clothes up fast to avoid inviting any more affectionate feelings.
But Hermione doesn’t answer. She’s staring at the emerald green sweater Harry’s wearing, realization dawning slowly on her face.
“Honestly, Potter, I’m not sure what your problem is,” he says, when Harry expresses shock and anger at having Apparated into a crowd of mostly-naked people without warning, “it’s not as if he’s a
was as alone as he’d ever been, more alone than he was before he knew Sirius existed, because at least then Sirius had been out there somewhere, breathing.
Harry’d done his best, though, to get rid of the stuff that really plagued him, that made it hard for him to function. Dumbledore’s death. Sirius’. Cedric Diggory’s. His own. The Inferi. The Battle. A few funerals—Sirius’, Fred’s, Remus and Tonks’. Some things that embarrassed him, too, those quiet mortifications that bit his feet in the black insomniac hours of the night: Ginny yelling up and down Diagon Alley during their breakup, airing all of their dirty laundry, a fight so apocalyptic that it ended up not only in the
Instead he stays standing. “Someone did a good enough job breaking into my flat that they set the whole place on fire,” he says, “and made off with a few of the, uh, vials I had stashed away. I figure I should probably…put the rest back. You know, for safety.”
The delicate lines of him, his pointy nose and the red indentations of where he’s had his pince-nez on at work all day, this face that Harry knows so well—this face he’s obsessed over, hated, dreamed about, been sneered at by, wanted to punch, said unforgivable things to, misunderstood, seen in a thousand different lights, cool winter and warm candlelight and the shadows of the Hogwarts dungeons, this face that he has now kissed—Harry feels something massive swell in his chest, like a heart which is much too large has taken up residence in place of his normal one. Malfoy might be a snot and a stuck-up ponce on a good day, but somehow he has bitched and slandered his way straight to a post somewhere behind Harry’s sternum, and despite all attempts to oust him he is refusing to leave.
He’s never put back one of the memories from his safe—if he needs to remember something he just pours them in the Pensieve and watches like they aren’t his, but he can’t imagine it’s much different than a temporary removal, like Malfoy does during every session and like Dumbledore did back when Harry was a kid.
Rita lives in a walk-up flat in a wizarding building near Picadilly Circus. When Harry approaches the closed door, he can hear the clack of magically-operated typewriters working furiously inside, no doubt inventing more fictional descriptions of his haunted eyes and terrifyingly short temper. Well, he thinks darkly, as he knocks hard on the door and shouts,
Harry banishes Draco’s clothes wandlessly and wordlessly while his mouth is still occupied, then gathers Draco to him in an armful of naked limbs. Something inside him goes quiet, sated by the heat of his skin. He opens his mouth to bite Draco’s lips, messy and wet, and gets an emphatic noise of agreement in return.
He gets Harry’s arm around his shoulders; vaguely, Harry is aware of walking deeper into the building, past more beaded curtains, through a hazy miasma of moans and
“Why not?” Hermione shoots back. “That woman is hateful, Ron, don’t pretend you don’t know it. The extremes she would go to in order to embarrass Harry on a public stage. I reckon she found something in your flat, Harry, that she’s going to add to her book.”
Malfoy swears and crouches in front of him, reaching out to hold his head up. “Potter?” he says. “Harry?”
What did he see fit to remove, Harry wondered. Was it different for each session? Did he not bother taking things out of his head with other Aurors—was it just Harry he didn’t trust? Malfoy’d signed a nondisclosure agreement with the DMLE, he knew, but that didn’t go both ways. Did he think Harry would use something he saw, if he ever managed to see anything? Didn’t he know Harry had grown up, too—that he didn’t think Malfoy was necessarily up to something just because they were currently occupying the same room?
Draco gives him a hard look. “Harry, it hardly matters who I’ve slept with in the past, when the only person I intend to sleep with for the rest of my life is you.”
“What look?” Harry asks. He thinks he should feel indignant, maybe, but the combination of Malfoy sprawled out between his legs like a contented panther and the word
“Don’t be dramatic,” Harry says, but he hasn’t, actually, forgotten who he’s talking to, so he spends the next ten minutes explaining, trailing after Draco as he goes bustling about the gardening shed and then striding through the Manor up to the master bath, where he flings all his clothes onto the floor and sets about casting
Harry was busy raging internally at the fact that Malfoy had refused, yet again, to rubber-stamp him to go back in the field, so at first he wasn’t paying enough attention to feel a lurch of alarm at the words—but then he heard them, a moment late, and he did. “Nothing,” he said quickly. “I don’t know what you’re on about. Maybe I’ve managed to block you out of those parts.”
Harry swallows thickly. The eggs he just scarfed down are suddenly a cold hard mass in his stomach, like a load of fresh concrete. He’s not sure
Malfoy has clearly taken great pains to rehabilitate it; the great hall where Hermione was tortured all those years ago is open and airy, the windows dressed with pale linens, ceilings transfigured to high, vaulted arches. Harry’s footsteps echo around him like falling rain as he crosses through pools of soft morning sunlight, into a humid greenhouse room and out onto the sprawling back porch.
Given the nature of his position, Harry spent most of his time as Remus Lupin had during the war—embedded in deep cover, limited contact with other Aurors, dirty and cold and fearing for his life twenty-three hours out of every twenty-four—so he didn’t run into Malfoy until seven years after he’d testified at his Wizengamot hearing, when Head Auror Kingsley Shacklebolt had a mental break.
He’s pacing a tight circuit in the hall outside and trying not to think about Malfoy being alone in a room with Blaise Zabini’s magnificent cock when it happens—from behind one of the beaded curtains comes a cloud of acrid pink smoke that engulfs his head and sends him, sneezing, against the wall.
yet that he was in trouble—he had a sneaking suspicion, maybe, but he wasn’t sure. Now, having come for a second time, feeling rather damp and wrung out and like he’s just woken up from an exceptionally good nap, refreshed and invigorated and still somehow a little sleepy, Harry looks down at Malfoy’s pale blond head resting against his hip, his body still clenching and unclenching spasmodically around Malfoy’s long pianist’s fingers, and thinks: oh, fuck, I love him.
She has, Harry thinks as an ocean of rage bears down on him, conveniently left out the fact that he’s in love.
Harry is up early the next morning, not having slept much. By some stroke of terrible luck he ended up in what he thinks must’ve been Malfoy’s childhood bedroom, with green and silver linens and bedposts shaped like cobras that hissed and whispered at him all night. He wouldn’t have guessed that Parseltongue would extend to snake-shaped furniture, but at this point there’s very little in his life that surprises him; he’d asked them as politely as he could manage to please shut the bloody hell up, but they’d been chattering all night about how it was so nice to finally meet him, after all they’d heard about him, which Harry figured meant Death Eaters had done some strategizing in here, or something.
As soon as they’re alone, Draco takes Harry’s head in his hands and kisses him. “I’m sorry,” he says, tight against Harry’s mouth, as they stagger back toward the bed. “I didn’t hear you were back until an hour ago, and your ridiculous bloody friends have got a Muggle address—”
He wants to go to the Manor. He doesn’t know why (he ought to know why, he thinks, he’s missing something huge here) but all he wants in this moment is to talk to Malfoy. For Malfoy to roll his eyes and say,
It was nothing that he needed to do his job, when it came down to it, and so Kingsley didn’t need to know, and neither did Malfoy.
“You’re not special, Potter,” Kingsley informed him, not looking up from the file he had open on his desk.
Someone else comes into the bullpen, Justin Finch-Fletchley chatting animatedly with Hannah Abbot over cups of coffee from POTATO, and before they can come in sight of his desk Harry shoves
Malfoy’s eyes flick up over the rim of his pince-nez. “Potter,” he says. “Help yourself to whatever you like. And weren’t you wearing those robes yesterday?”
Harry Potter, savior of the bloody wizarding world, the Boy Who Fucking Lived, wants Draco Malfoy to let him fall asleep on his cock. And the worst part is that Draco is going to let him. Draco is calling him
“But it’s true,” Draco contends, cradling Harry’s head back against his shoulder with his hand still wrapped over his throat, chest pressed flush to Harry’s back, only his hips moving. “You were made for me, turtle, Harry, sweetheart—”
When he comes round a couple of hours later, lying in the closed DMLE ward with one other Auror whose whole head is swaddled in foul-smelling bandages, he’s in the sort of pain that makes it difficult to know whether he wants to get pissed or never get within twenty paces of firewhiskey ever again.
“Kingsley’s overridden you,” he says distantly. “I’m cleared for field work. They’re sending me to Guatemala for a month.”
